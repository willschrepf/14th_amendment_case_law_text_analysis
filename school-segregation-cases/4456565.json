Standards of Review .......................................................................................................... 1\nB.     Either the Commission weighed the evidence and concluded that it\n       was not sufficient to allow a determination as to what portion of the\n       storm expenses were due to the negligent state of the Company’s\n       system, or the Commission did not weigh the evidence and decided not\n       to address the issue based upon the irrelevant factor of the passage of\n       time. Either way, the Commission committed reversible error by\n       failing to hold ETI to its burden of proof under PURA § 36.006 and\n       allowing one hundred percent of the $13,014,379 1997 storm restoration\n       expenses to be included in the storm reserve and reflected in rates. .................. 4\nC.     Indisputably, the issue of determining what amount of 1997 storm\n       restoration expenses was prudent, appropriate, and includable in the\n       storm reserve and rates was an issue to be decided in Docket No.\n       39896. That fact does not render the Commission’s Orders in Docket\n       Nos. 18249 and 16705 irrelevant or properly disregarded........................................ 8\nD.     The Commission inappropriately focused on only one aspect of the\n       prudence question and ignored the genesis of the expenses. ................................. 11\nE.     The 60-basis-point reduction to the Company’s return on equity\n       assessed in Docket No. 18249 was not intended to be in lieu of\n       identifying and accounting for the portion of the cost of cleaning up\n       and repairing the damage caused by the Company’s imprudent\n       vegetation management. The Commission acted arbitrarily and\n       capriciously by considering this irrelevant factor and including the\n       entirety of the $13,014,379 in ETI’s storm reserve reflected in rates. .................... 13\nF.     The Commission erred in approving the recovery of imprudent costs. ............... 16\n\n\n                                                                 i\n\fG.      Some of ETI’s storm costs were “reasonably anticipated,” and it was\n        reversible error for the Commission to fail to consider this statutorily\n        required criterion. The Commission’s Order violates PURA § 36.064\n        and is the result of the Commission acting arbitrarily and through\n        unlawful procedure. ........................................................................................................ 20\nH.

(ETI).\n\n                            ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nA. Standards of Review\n\n          Several standards of review are implicated by the Commission’s Order and\n\neach, standing on its own, provides a sufficient basis for reversal. Contrary to the\n\nPUC’s and ETI’s focus on the substantial evidence standard, the Commission’s\n\nOrder is subject to reversal under additional standards of review listed under\n\nSection 2001.174 of the Administrative Procedure Act.1 The six standards of\n\nreview listed in Subsection 2001.174(2) offer independent grounds for reversal as\n\nevidenced by the use of the word “or” in the subsection. Texas law is clear that\n\nthese standards of review are separate and distinct. For instance, the Supreme\n\nCourt has expressly stated that “instances may arise in which the agency’s action\n\nis supported by substantial evidence, but is arbitrary and capricious nonetheless”\n\nand that the Legislature intended to “distinguish between agency action that is\n1\n    Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 2001.001-.902.\n                                               1\n\fnot supported by substantial evidence and agency action that is arbitrary and\n\ncapricious.” Texas Health Facilities Comm’n v. Charter Medical-Dallas, 665 S.W.2d 446,\n\n452 (Tex. 1984).\n\n       In addition to the substantial evidence standard, and the arbitrary and\n\ncapricious standard acknowledged by the Commission as having been invoked in\n\nthis appeal, Appellant OPUC’s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the\n\nadministrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions violate statutory\n\nprovisions, are made through unlawful procedure, and are affected by other error\n\nof law.2 The Commission has violated PURA and the APA by failing to consider\n\nand set forth findings on statutory criteria for the inclusion of storm costs in the\n\nself-insurance reserve and rates.3 The Commission also committed reversible error\n\nin making its decision through unlawful procedure by failing to include underlying\n\nfindings of fact in support of statutorily required criteria.4 Additionally, the\n\nCommission’s Order is affected by other error of law in that it failed to give effect\n\nto the plain, unambiguous language of the Commission’s rules.\n\n       The arbitrary and capricious standard applies as well; however, in its\n\nAppellee’s brief, the Commission improperly mixes the arbitrary and capricious\n\n\n2\n  APA § 2001.174(2)(A)(D)(E) and (F). APA Section 2001.174 is submitted as Appendix 2.\n3\n  Public Utility Regulatory Act, PURA, TEX. UTIL. CODE ANN. §§ 11.001-66.017. PURA Chapter 36,\nSubchapters A and B are submitted as Appendix 1.\n4\n  OPUC also notes that this standard of review is applicable to ETI’s “conditional cross point”\nbecause ETI’s challenge is procedural in nature, i.e., the exclusion from evidence of an exhibit.\n                                                 2\n\fstandard with the substantial evidence standard of review. The Commission\n\ncontends that under the arbitrary and capricious standard, “Courts must uphold a\n\nCommission decision if ‘some reasonable basis exists in the record for the action\n\ntaken by the agency.’”5 However, the quoted language from City of El Paso comes\n\nfrom the Court’s discussion of the substantial evidence standard, not the arbitrary\n\nand capricious standard of review. OPUC’s Appellant brief includes a discussion\n\non pages 37-39 as to how the Commission’s Order was arbitrary and capricious or\n\nresulting from an abuse of discretion in three of the four ways possible under the\n\narbitrary and capricious standard of review.6 Under the standards articulated in\n\nAPA § 2001.174, the Commission’s Order should be reversed and the case\n\nremanded for determination based upon the existing evidentiary record to\n\ndetermine rates consistent with the Court’s decision.\n\n\n\n\n5\n  PUC’s Brief of Appellee at 11, quoting City of El Paso v. Public Util. Comm’n, 883 S.W.2d 179, 186\n(Tex. 1994) (City of El Paso is submitted as Appendix 10).\n6\n  An administrative agency’s decision is arbitrary or results from an abuse of discretion if the\nagency: (1) failed to consider a factor the legislature directs it to consider; (2) considers an\nirrelevant factor; or (3) weighs only relevant factors that the legislature directs it to consider but\nstill reaches a completely unreasonable result. City of El Paso v. Public Util. Comm’n, 883 S.W.2d 179,\n184 (Tex. 1994). Also, when an agency fails to “follow the clear, unambiguous language of its\nown regulation,” it acts arbitrarily and capriciously. Public Util. Comm’n v. Gulf States Utilities, 809\nS.W.2d 201, 207 (Tex. 1991).\n                                                3\n\fB. Either the Commission weighed the evidence and concluded that it was\n   not sufficient to allow a determination as to what portion of the storm\n   expenses were due to the negligent state of the Company’s system, or the\n   Commission did not weigh the evidence and decided not to address the\n   issue based upon the irrelevant factor of the passage of time. Either way,\n   the Commission committed reversible error by failing to hold ETI to its\n   burden of proof under PURA § 36.006 and allowing one hundred percent\n   of the $13,014,379 1997 storm restoration expenses to be included in the\n   storm reserve and reflected in rates.\n\n       In their respective Appellee’s briefs, ETI and the PUC focus on the evidence\n\npresented in the Commission proceeding related to the processes ETI went\n\nthrough in repairing damage and restoring service following the 1997 ice storm.\n\nTheir arguments focus on the “substantial evidence” supporting the Commission’s\n\ndecision to include one hundred percent of the 1997 storm restoration expenses\n\ninto the storm reserve reflected in rates, and assert that OPUC seeks to have the\n\nCourt reweigh the evidence to reach a different result. Their contention misses\n\nthe mark.      The weighing of the evidence was indisputably done during the\n\ncontested case by the Commission and the Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) who\n\nauthored the Proposal for Decision (PFD) adopted by the Commission. The result\n\nof their weighing of the evidence on the issue of what costs were caused by ETI’s\n\nnegligent, imprudent or deficient quality of service,7 is encapsulated in the\n\n\n7\n  The service quality deficiencies related to the costs at issue in this appeal included inadequate\ndistribution maintenance policies, inadequate vegetation management practices, distribution\npoles in poor condition or in need of comprehensive vegetation clearing, and inadequate pole\ninspection and repair work cycles. See Docket No. 18249, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. Service Quality\nIssues (Severed from Docket No. 16705), Order on Rehearing at 8-19 (Apr. 22, 1998); OPUC’s\n                                                4\n\fCommission-adopted PFD’s statement that, “[i]t is not feasible to accurately\n\ndetermine now what portion of ice storm damage that occurred 15 years ago was\n\ncaused by preventative maintenance issues.”8          With this statement, the\n\nCommission, through its adopted PFD, acknowledged the issue of what part of the\n\nstorm damage was caused by ETI, not solely by an Act of God, and not caused by\n\nratepayers. With this statement, the Commission also concluded its weighing of\n\nevidence on the issue, and found that with the evidence presented, it was not\n\n“feasible” to determine what portion was caused by the negligent state of the\n\nCompany’s preventative maintenance, including vegetation management.\n\n\n       Upon arriving at this conclusion, after having weighed the evidence on the\n\nissue, the Commission had to then decide what to do with the proposed\n\n$13,014,379 in 1997 ice storm costs. The Commission had several options, but one\n\noption it did not legally have was to allow the inclusion of the entire requested\n\n$13,014,379 in the storm reserve reflected in rates. When faced with no feasible\n\nway of determining what part was due to the Company’s action or inaction, the\n\nCommission had a duty under PURA § 36.006 to disallow the expenses. ETI had\n\nthe burden of proof on the issue and the Commission expressly stated that it could\n\nnot determine what portion was caused by the Company’s “preventative\n\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 5-7 (Submitted as Appendix 5).\n8\n  AR, Binder 5, Item No. 185, PFD at 56.\n                                             5\n\fmaintenance issues” that the Commission earlier had found to be a “major factor”\n\nin the outages and to have “greatly exacerbated” the extent of the damage.9 If the\n\nevidence cannot be shown to support the Company’s case, ETI fails to meet its\n\nburden of proof necessary to include the entirety of the 1997 storm expenses. The\n\nCommission committed reversible error by approving the inclusion of one\n\nhundred percent of the 1997 storm costs.\n\n\n        Alternatively, if the quoted passage from the Commission-adopted PFD is\n\nnot a determination based upon the weight of the evidence, then it should be\n\ninterpreted as discussed in OPUC’s Appellant’s Brief10 as a refusal, based on an\n\nirrelevant factor - the passage of time, to hold ETI to its burden to prove that\n\neither one hundred percent of the costs would have been incurred, regardless of\n\nthe state of the Company’s system at the time of the storm, or provide evidence on\n\nwhat portion should be disallowed. Contrary to the PUC’s implied argument,\n\nOPUC does not argue that the Company was required to break out, line by line,\n\neach imprudent cost. Rather, as noted in OPUC’s Appellant’s Brief, there were a\n\nvariety of ways available to the Company in which to propose an appropriate\n\ndivision between the costs that would have occurred regardless of the state of its\n\n\n9\n  Entergy Gulf States, Inc. Service Quality Issues (Severed from Docket No. 16705), Docket No. 18249, Order\non Rehearing at 18-19 and 47, FoF No. 97 (Apr. 22, 1998) (Submitted as Appendix 4)\n(Hereinafter, “Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing”).\n10\n   OPUC’s Appellant’s Brief at 25-27, 31-32, 38.\n                                                       6\n\fsystem, and what was actually incurred. The Company did not, and it was error to\n\nallow the entirety of the $13,014,379 in the storm reserve and rates. Likewise,\n\nOPUC does not contend that the Company had to disallow all or require a line by\n\nline accounting.     Instead, as discussed in OPUC’s Appellant’s Brief,11 if the\n\nCommission wished to grant the inclusion of the prudent portion of the costs, the\n\nCommission had multiple options available to it, including but not limited to\n\nusing a third party review and basing a disallowance on the third party report, or\n\nremanding the case back to SOAH for further evidence in a supplemental hearing\n\nphase. However, the one option not legally available to the Commission was the\n\npath the Commission chose to take. If, as argued in the PUC’s Appellee’s Brief,\n\nthe Commission did weigh the evidence, it concluded that there was not sufficient\n\nevidence to allow a determination as to what portion of the storm expenses were\n\ndue to the negligent state of the Company’s system. On the other hand, if the\n\nCommission did not weigh the evidence and refused to address the issue based\n\nupon the passage of time, Commission considered an irrelevant factor. Either way,\n\nthe Commission committed reversible error by failing to hold ETI to its burden of\n\nproof under PURA § 36.006 by including unreasonable, unnecessary and\n\nimprudent costs in the storm reserve reflected in rates.\n\n\n\n\n11\n     Id. at 18-19.\n                                        7\n\fC. Indisputably, the issue of determining what amount of 1997 storm\n   restoration expenses was prudent, appropriate, and includable in the\n   storm reserve and rates was an issue to be decided in Docket No. 39896.\n   That fact does not render the Commission’s Orders in Docket Nos. 18249\n   and 16705 irrelevant or properly disregarded.\n\n       At various points in their respective briefs, Appellees ETI and PUC allege\n\nthat OPUC contends that the prudence of these storm restoration expenses was\n\ndecided in Docket No. 18249.             The Appellees’ briefs minimized what the\n\nCommission stated in Docket No. 18249; however, the Commission in its Order in\n\nthat docket does not mince words. The Commission expressly stated that a\n\n“major cause of the outages during the storm” were trees overhanging wires.12 The\n\nCommission also stated “[t]ree limbs in ROW overhanging distribution lines pose\n\na threat to system reliability, and are largely within EGS’ control.”13                    The\n\nCommission continued and stated that the “Company’s failure to clear the limbs\n\nbefore the storm was a major factor in the number and duration of outages\n\nexperienced by customers” and that “vegetation management failures greatly\n\naggravated the situation.”14 The Commission wasn’t done discussing how ETI’s\n\nnegligent or poor quality of service impacted the extent of the storm damage. The\n\nCommission found that the “impact of the January 1997 ice storm was greatly\n\nexacerbated by the Company’s failure to maintain its ROW clear of excessive\n12\n   Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing at 18-19.\n13\n   Id. at 18-19 (emphasis added). “EGS” is Entergy Gulf States, Inc., the predecessor to ETI and\nwas the name the Company operated under during Docket Nos. 16705 and 18249.\n14\n   Id. at 18-19 (emphasis added).\n                                             8\n\fvegetation.”15 These statements very clearly address the cause of a portion of the\n\ndamages which ETI was obligated to repair and restore. ETI presented testimony\n\nthrough its witness Shawn Corkran on the processes ETI used in repairing and\n\nrestoring the system. While the issue of the prudence of the $13,014,379 in\n\nrestoration costs and the question of their inclusion in the storm reserve was not at\n\nissue in Docket No. 18249, the Commission did make a determination that impacts\n\nthe prudence review of those costs in this case; the Commission in Docket\n\nNo. 39896 was not free to disregard the finding in its prior order that a portion of\n\nthe storm damage for which the restoration expenses were incurred was caused by\n\nthe Company’s unacceptable actions or inactions. Likewise, once the Commission\n\nmade its findings that the Company was responsible for greatly exacerbating the\n\ndamage, ETI knew or should have known that it must address the issue when\n\npresenting its storm restoration costs for inclusion in the storm reserve and rates.\n\n\n          The Commission’s Order in Docket No. 16705 also made it clear that the\n\nissue of what amount of 1997 storm restoration costs are properly includable in the\n\nstorm reserve and reflected in rates remained in Docket No. 16705 and was not\n\nsevered into the separate quality of service docket, Docket No. 18249. The final\n\norder (Second Order on Rehearing) in Docket No. 16705 very plainly shows that\n\nthe Commission considered the Company’s proposal to include a post-test-year\n15\n     Id. at FoF No. 97.\n                                        9\n\fadjustment for the January 1997 ice storm expenses. The Docket No. 16705 final\n\norder, which was issued after Docket No. 18249’s final order, stated in pertinent\n\npart in Finding of Fact No. 147 that, “EGS did not prove a reasonable post-test\n\nyear level for its existing reserve fund or that the amount expended in 1997 to\n\nreduce the fund was prudent or appropriate.”16 The Commission continued and\n\nexpressed its intent for the issue to be addressed in the Company’s next rate case:\n\n“Reserve fund levels following the test year in this case can be addressed in EGS’\n\nNovember 1998 rate filing when all parties will have the opportunity to evaluate\n\nthe reasonableness of changes to the reserve fund.” Clearly, the Commission’s\n\nDocket No. 16705 final order anticipated that the issue of what amount of 1997 ice\n\nstorm costs was prudent and appropriate and includable in the storm reserve fund\n\nwould be addressed in the next rate case. Docket No. 39896 was the next fully\n\nlitigated rate case and the first opportunity to give effect to Docket No. 16705’s\n\nexpectation and address the prudence of including the 1997 storm costs in the\n\nCompany’s storm reserve reflected in rates. On this issue, the parties in Docket\n\nNo. 39896 effectively stood in the same position as if it was November 1998, and it\n\nwas error for the Commission to treat the issue, and the parties, as if it were\n\notherwise.\n\n\n16\n  Application of Entergy Texas for Approval of its Transition to Competition Plan and the Tariffs Implementing\nthe Plan, and for the Authority to Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705, Second Order on Rehearing\n(Oct. 14, 1998) (An excerpt of this order is submitted as Appendix 5).\n                                                    10\n\fD. The Commission inappropriately focused on only one aspect of the\n   prudence question and ignored the genesis of the expenses.\n\n       ETI did not address the issue of what amount of 1997 ice storm costs was\n\nprudent and appropriate and includable in the storm reserve fund, despite the\n\nCommission’s prior findings that the Company caused much of the damage.\n\nInstead, ETI presented its case on the 1997 storm restoration costs as if the damage\n\nand the resulting restoration costs were incurred in a business as usual manner.\n\nETI presented testimony on its storm preparation and processes in general to\n\nsupport its requested storm costs for the entire period of 1996-2011, including\n\ntestimony about practices that were put into place in 1998 and thereafter; ETI also\n\noffered the rebuttal testimony of Shawn Corkran to specifically address how the\n\n1997 ice storm restoration process was carried out, including what damage was\n\nrepaired and restored. However, none of this evidence went to the issue of what\n\namount of the damage and resulting costs were due to the “preventative\n\nmaintenance” issues or negligent state of the Company’s system.17\n\n\n\n17\n  The PUC asserts on pages 27-29 of its Appellee’s Brief that substantial evidence supports the\ninclusion of the expenses. However, the evidence cited by the PUC goes to the undisputed fact\nthat once the system was damaged and down, it needed to be restored and repaired. OPUC does\nnot dispute that the clean-up process was done properly; however, it is not the sole issue to be\nconsidered when determining what amount of the 1997 ice storm restoration costs are\nincludable in the storm reserve and rates. Nor can the evidence cited by the PUC in its brief be\nconstrued to be evidence on the question at issue, given Mr. Corkran’s statement that he was\nunaware of any attempt by the Company to identify or quantify the portion of damage and\nexpenses related to the poor vegetation management. AR, Binder 43, Vol. D, Transcript at\n579:15-19. The transcript of Mr. Corkran’s cross-examination is submitted as Appendix 6.\n                                             11\n\f          Proof that ETI did not present evidence on the issue is found in the\n\nadmission by ETI’s expert witness, Shawn Corkran during cross-examination\n\nduring the hearing on the merits in Docket No. 39896. Asked if the Company had\n\nidentified or quantified the level of expenses attributable to ETI’s negligence, Mr.\n\nCorkran stated that he is not aware of any attempt by the Company to try and\n\nquantify which costs or how much were attributable to the Company’s poor\n\nvegetation management.18 Under PURA § 36.006, the Company holds the burden\n\nof proof and it was error for the Commission to include the entirety of the\n\n$13,014,379 in 1997 Storm Restoration costs in the storm reserve based upon the\n\nexisting evidentiary record. It was not feasible, based upon the case presented by\n\nthe Company, to determine what portion of the $13,014,379 was due to the\n\nexacerbated level of damage and what portion would have been incurred\n\nregardless. The Company failed to carry its burden of proof that would allow the\n\nCommission to legally find that the entire amount is properly included in the\n\nstorm reserves and rates.\n\n\n\n\n18\n     AR, Binder 53, Vol. D, Transcript at 579:15-19.\n                                                 12\n\fE. The 60-basis-point reduction to the Company’s return on equity assessed\n   in Docket No. 18249 was not intended to be in lieu of identifying and\n   accounting for the portion of the cost of cleaning up and repairing the\n   damage caused by the Company’s imprudent vegetation management. The\n   Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously by considering this\n   irrelevant factor and including the entirety of the $13,014,379 in ETI’s\n   storm reserve reflected in rates.\n\n       As noted in OPUC’s Appellant’s brief, the Commission imposed a 60-basis-\n\npoint reduction in Docket No. 18249 pursuant to PURA § 36.062 expressly\n\nintended to reflect the poor level of service provided by the Company, to\n\nincentivize the Company to improve its service quality, and to provide the\n\nratepayers a remedy for such things as billing rate error and call center response\n\ntime.19 As acknowledged by ETI during the hearing on the merits in Docket No.\n\n39896, the 60 basis point reduction levied in Docket No. 18249 was used by the\n\nCommission as part of an incentive plan created to help the Company achieve\n\nmuch needed service quality improvements.20\n\n       Moreover, the Company’s quality of service was a statutorily required\n\nconsideration under PURA § 36.062 when determining the Company’s return on\n\nequity (ROE). The 60-basis-point reduction was more of a penalty in nature and\n\nwas not intended to be a cure-all for the attendant impacts of the poor service.\n19\n   See Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing at 1-2; See also Id. at 28-29, 35 and Ordering\nParagraph 8.\n20\n   AR, Vol. D, Transcript at 570:22-572:2; See Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing at 28 and\n28-31. The plan also allowed the Company the opportunity to “earn back” some of its basis point\nreduction going forward, if it met certain specific performance targets. Id. at 29.\n                                              13\n\fSpecifically, contrary to the statement on page 57 of the Commission-adopted PFD\n\nand the Appellees’ argument, the 60 basis point reduction was not intended as a\n\nremedy in whole or in part for the extra restoration costs the Company expended\n\nin cleaning up the exacerbated damage caused by the imprudent state of its\n\nsystem.\n\n           First, the issue of the recovery of the 1997 storm restoration costs through\n\nthe storm reserve was not one of the issued severed out of Docket No. 16705 into\n\nDocket No. 18249.21 Therefore, the issue was not before the Commission at the\n\ntime it assessed the 60 basis point penalty. Second, the Order in Docket No. 16705\n\nwas issued six months after the Order in Docket 18249 in which the Commission\n\nordered the 60-basis-point reduction. The Commission was clearly aware of its\n\nown order reducing the Company’s ROE and yet, the above-quoted Finding of\n\nFact No. 147 from the later order clearly indicates that the Commission anticipated\n\nthat the prudence, propriety and reasonableness of the 1997 storm costs and their\n\ninclusion in the storm reserve would be litigated in a future rate case. The\n\nCommission would not have made such a finding if it considered any imprudence\n\nto have been remedied by the 60-basis-point reduction.\n\n           The PUC and ETI seem to be arguing that the 60-basis-point reduction\n\n\n21\n     Id. at 2-3.\n                                           14\n\ftrumps the regulatory and statutory requirements that storm costs included in the\n\nplan be “reasonable and necessary” and “not reasonably anticipated.”22 Such an\n\nargument is without merit and contrary to law. Reducing the Company’s ROE\n\nunder PURA § 36.062 does not absolve the Company or the Commission from\n\nPURA’s requirements that imprudent costs not be charged to ratepayers. Nor\n\ndoes the reduction to the ROE convert unreasonable costs into reasonable costs,\n\nand anticipated costs into unanticipated costs.                  The requirement in\n\nPURA § 36.062 that the Commission address the Company’s service quality when\n\nsetting its ROE does not negate the statutory requirement that only reasonable\n\nand necessary expenses be charged to ratepayers under PURA § 36.051 and\n\n36.064.23 Courts “should not give one provision a meaning out of harmony or\n\ninconsistent with other provisions, although it might be susceptible to such a\n\nconstruction standing alone.”24       Courts must “presume that the Legislature\n\nintends an entire statute to be effective and that a just and reasonable result is\n\nintended.”25\n\n      Although PURA § 36.052 authorizes the Commission to take the quality\n\nof a utility's services into     account in establishing a reasonable return, the\n\n\n22\n    PURA §§ 36.051 and 36.064; 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 25.231(b)(2)(J). Rule 25.231(b) is\nsubmitted as Appendix 3.\n23\n   See 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 25.231(b)(2)(J).\n24\n   Helena Chem. Co. v. Wilkins, 47 S.W.3d 486, 493 (Tex. 2001) (Submitted as Appendix 11).\n25\n   Id. citing Tex. Gov't Code § 311.021(2), (3).\n                                                 15\n\fprovision should not be interpreted to negate the requirements of PURA §§ 36.051\n\nand 36.064(c) that only reasonable and necessary expenses are permitted for\n\nrecovery through rates.             In other words, a penalty imposed upon a utility's\n\nauthorized return for poor service quality should not be viewed as a license to\n\npermit the utility to now charge customers for the portion of the damages\n\nresulting from the Company's poor service quality.26                          The end result of the\n\nCommission's decision is that unreasonable and unnecessary expenses are being\n\ncharged to customers through the storm reserve and rates. The Commission’s\n\nOrder violates PURA, is arbitrary and capricious and is affected by other error of\n\nlaw.\n\nF. The Commission erred in approving the recovery of imprudent costs.\n\n        The PUC in its Appellee’s Brief asserts that a utility is not obligated to carve\n\nout imprudence from its request, and specifically, that ETI was not obligated to\n\nidentify the portion of its requested storm expenses that were due to the\n\nexacerbated damage caused by its imprudent system management.                                         These\n\ncontentions are incorrect. First, it is indisputably the Company’s burden to prove\n\neach element of its case, including the reasonableness and necessity of including\n\n\n\n26\n   Application of Entergy Texas for Approval of its Transition to Competition Plan and the Tariff Implementing\nthe Plan, and for the Authority to Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705, Second Order on Rehearing at\nFoF No. 147.\n\n                                                   16\n\frestoration costs into the storm reserve.27 Imprudent costs are neither reasonable\n\nnor necessary; imprudently incurred costs may not be recovered in the utility’s\n\nbase rates.28 Moreover, prudence is a statutorily required criterion.29 The utility\n\nbears the burden of proving the prudence of costs it seeks to recover, and if some\n\nbut not all of the requested costs are imprudent, the imprudent costs must be\n\nremoved either by separating them out, adopting another reasonable method to\n\naccount for the imprudence, or disallowing the intermingled requested costs.30 In\n\nthe 1992 City of El Paso decision, the court addressed a case in which imprudence\n\nhad been found. The court stated that the Commission should “generally disallow\n\nproject costs to the extent of the imprudence.”31 The court continued, stating that\n\na “determination that an expenditure is imprudent carries the legal consequence of\n\nits exclusion from rate base” and that prudence question “embodies one of the\n\n\n\n\n27\n   PURA §§ 36.006, 36.051 and 36.064.\n28\n   See Entergy Gulf States, Inc. v.

In\n\nTexas Utilities Electric Company, the Texas Third Court of Appeals found that, where\n\na portion of the utility’s $537.90 million in costs for the Comanche Peak nuclear\n\nproject were imprudently incurred, the Commission acted properly in disallowing\n\nsome but not all of the costs due to imprudence.33 In the originating Commission\n\ndocket, the utility had argued that all of its Comanche Peak costs were prudently\n\nincurred, while intervening parties had argued that the costs should be disallowed\n\nentirely, line by line.34 The Commission had then brought in a third party to\n\nevaluate the prudence of the costs. The court rejected the contention that if the\n\nCommission were to disallow some but not all of the costs, it must require a\n\ndetailed breakdown.            Instead of doing so, based upon the third party\n\nrecommendation, the Commission disallowed part of the costs because they were\n\nimprudent but allowed other costs.35 In particular, the Commission made a $90.5\n\nmillion disallowance for the response team, a $79.9 million disallowance related to\n\nthe corrective action program, plus other disallowances due to delays in licensing,\n\n\n32\n   Id.\n33\n   Texas Utilities Electric Company v.

Admin. Code § 25.231(b)(2)(J), based on\n\nthe inability to segregate imprudent costs.\n\n       As discussed on pages 17-20 of OPUC’s Appellant’s Brief, the instant case is\n\ndistinguishable from Texas Utilities Electric Company because it was already\n\nestablished as a matter of fact that imprudent conduct caused much of the storm\n\ndamage.       Finding of Fact 97 from PUC Docket No. 18249 provided the\n\nCommission with the starting point in its decision-making process, and it was the\n\nCommission’s job at that point to either deny ETI’s requested 1997 storm expenses\n36\n   Id. at 404-405. In total, the Commission disallowed $316.5 million as imprudent expenses.

Consequently, the imprudent\n\ncosts became part of the approved rates through their inclusion in the storm\n\nreserve.\n\nG. Some of ETI’s storm costs were “reasonably anticipated,” and it was\n   reversible error for the Commission to fail to consider this statutorily\n   required criterion. The Commission’s Order violates PURA § 36.064 and is\n   the result of the Commission acting arbitrarily and through unlawful\n   procedure.\n\n       PURA Section 36.064 allows storm costs to be included in a self-insurance\n\nplan to the extent they are “not reasonably anticipated.”                   PURA Subsection\n\n36.064(a) states that, an electric utility “may self-insure all or part of the utility's\n\npotential liability or catastrophic property loss, including windstorm, fire, and\n\nexplosion losses, that could not have been reasonably anticipated and included\n\nunder operating and maintenance expenses.”39 In a prior Commission Order in\n\n38\n  Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing at 47, FoF No. 97.\n39\n  The Commission’s substantive rule on self-insurance plans, 16 Tex. Admin. Code\n§ 25.231(b)(1)(G), states in pertinent part: “The reserve accounts are to be charged with\n                                               20\n\fDocket No. 18249, the Commission found that the damage resulting from the 1997\n\nice storm was much greater than it would otherwise have been due to the\n\nCompany’s imprudent vegetation management.                  Vegetation management is a\n\nprogram designed to keep the rights of way surrounding power lines clear; the\n\nvery purpose of vegetation management is to anticipate and prevent or mitigate\n\nstorm damage and outages in bad weather.40 The Commission’s Order in Docket\n\nNo. 39896 fails to demonstrate that the Commission considered the imprudent\n\ngenesis of the storm damage and the fact that much of the damage and\n\ncorresponding expenses were reasonably anticipated and preventable.\n\n       Both the PUC and ETI defend the Commission’s order by claiming that the\n\n“not reasonably anticipated” requirement for inclusion of storm costs in the self-\n\ninsurance reserve and rates was considered by the Commission either because the\n\nPFD mentioned a witness’s discussion of the severity of the storm or because a\n\nsingle Q&A that appeared in another witness’s rebuttal testimony said so (despite\n\nnot being cited in the PFD or Order). Neither contention even if read in the best\n\nlight would be sufficient. The “not reasonably anticipated” requirement is a\n\nstatutorily required consideration that requires support by underlying findings of\n\n\n\nproperty and liability losses which occur, and which could not have been reasonably anticipated\nand included in operating and maintenance expenses, and are not paid or reimbursed by\ncommercial insurance.”\t\t\t\n40\n   Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing at 14.\t\n                                              21\n\ffact in order to show that the Commission properly gave consideration to the\n\nstatutorily required criterion.41 It is not enough to merely infer consideration\n\nthrough other findings of fact or statements; clear, specific findings are required in\n\norder to prove that the Commission fulfilled its duty under the statute.42                     The\n\nCourt in Charter Medical explained that underlying findings of fact have\n\n“substantial statutory purpose” and serve to “restrain any disposition on the part\n\nof the agency to grant [a certificate] without a full consideration of the evidence\n\nand a serious appraisal of the facts.”43 Such findings of fact also serve to inform the\n\nparties and the courts of the basis for the agency's decision so that the parties may\n\nintelligently prepare an appeal and so that the courts may properly exercise their\n\nfunction of review.44\n\n       The Commission’s Order fails to show the statutorily required\n\nconsideration that storm costs included in the self-insurance plan only be those\n\n“that could not have been reasonably anticipated,” and further fails to provide\n\nunderlying findings, either in the findings of fact or in the body of the Order, that\n\nconstitute material basic facts that relate to the statutory finding of “not\n\nreasonably anticipated.”         The failure to include underlying findings of fact to\n\n41\n   See Texas Health Facilities Comm’n v.

Texas courts will reverse\n\nan agency order when underlying fact findings are legally insufficient.45\n\nAdditionally, the omission of an ultimate finding (or statutorily required criteria)\n\nwhen underlying findings are absent violates PURA § 36.064, APA § 2001.141(b), is\n\narbitrary and capricious, and the resulting order is made through unlawful\n\nprocedure.      An expressly stated factor in determining whether the agency’s\n\ndecision is arbitrary or results from an abuse of discretion is whether the agency\n\n“failed to consider a factor the Legislature directs it to consider.”46\n\n       Finally, the Commission’s own regulation, 16 Tex. Admin. Code\n\n§ 25.231(b)(1)(G), requires that only those property and liability losses which\n\ncould not have been reasonably anticipated may be included in the self-insurance\n\nplan. Failing to give effect to its own unambiguous regulation is reversible as\n\nother error of law and is also arbitrary and capricious. This Court has stated that\n\nan agency decision is arbitrary when its final order “fails to demonstrate a\n\nconnection between the agency decision and the factors that are made relevant to\n\n\n\n45\n   See Texas Health Facilities Comm’n v.

As noted in OPUC’s Appellant’s brief, the very purpose\n\nof vegetation management requirements is to prevent or mitigate foreseeable\n\ndamage after storms due to vegetation in the rights of way coming into contact\n\nwith conductors and wires, causing wire breakage or ground faults. The Order is\n\nlegally deficient to support the inclusion of the entirety of 1997 ice storm costs in\n\nthe storm reserve as “not reasonably anticipated” costs; to the contrary, the record\n\nshows that the 1997 storm costs were in fact reasonably anticipated. It was\n\nreversible error to include these costs in the storm reserve and rates.\n\n\n\n\n47\n     General Motors Corp. v. Bray, 243 S.W.3d 678, 684 (Tex.

ETI’s 420-page spreadsheet was properly excluded from the evidentiary\n   record. (Response to ETI’s Conditional Cross-Point)\n       ETI offers as a conditional cross-point that the Commission erred by\n\nexcluding from evidence a 420-page spreadsheet ETI produced in discovery. ETI’s\n\ncomplaint is procedural in nature and falls under the “made through unlawful\n\nprocedure” standard of review.49 ETI’s conditional cross-point is meritless. First,\n\nthe excluded spreadsheet was not controlling on a material issue but was instead\n\nmerely cumulative and thus, its exclusion from evidence, if error, was harmless and\n\ndoes not warrant reversal under APA § 2001.174(2)(c).50 Here, the spreadsheet\n\nonly shows that expenditures were made. Five pages are in evidence as part of\n\nOPUC’s Exhibit No. 6; these pages show the nature of the information provided\n\nand, because the accounting itself is not challenged, the remaining 415 pages are\n\nunnecessary to the rendition of a proper order.51\n\n       ETI contends it was error to deny the admission the 420-page spreadsheet\n\non the basis that ETI failed to reserve its right to exercise optional completeness.52\n\nETI attempts to support its contention by citing to Gilmore v. State, which was a\n\n\n49\n    APA § 2001.174(2)(c).\n50\n   Mentis v. Barnard, 870 S.W.2d 14, 16 (Tex. 1994); Office of Public Utility Counsel v.

R. Civ. P. 197.3. See AR, Binder 43, Vol.\nK, Transcript at 1705-1706.\n                                              25\n\fcriminal case wherein the Dallas Court of Appeals held that a party does not have\n\nto exercise optional completeness at the time the document being “completed” is\n\nadmitted; a party can wait until “cross-examination, or during the development of\n\n[its] own case.”53 However, there is a difference between having the right to\n\nexercise    optional      completeness       later   in    the    proceeding      rather     than\n\ncontemporaneously with the document being completed, and failing to reserve the\n\nright to do so later. The “permissive grant” language quoted by ETI deals with the\n\nfact that Appellant in Gilmore had argued that the language of Rule 107 of the Texas\n\nRules of Evidence required the court to admit the complete document\n\nimmediately.54\n\n       SOAH ALJs have been charged with the duty to conduct the contested case\n\nhearing on the merits when referred from the Commission.55 When the SOAH\n\nALJ acts as the presiding officer, he has “broad discretion in conducting the course,\n\nconduct, and scope of the hearing,” including the power to “rule upon the\n\nadmissibility of evidence and amendments to pleadings.”56 When conducting\n\nhearings referred from the Commission, it is the established practice that parties\n\nare required to reserve the right of optional completeness if not exercising it\n\n53\n   Gilmore v. State, 744 S.W.2d 630, 631(Tex. App.- Dallas 1987, pet. ref’d) (Submitted as Appendix\n13).\n54\n   Id.\n55\n   16 Tex. Admin. Code § 22.207.\t\n56\n   16 Tex.

In the\n\ncase below, Docket No. 39896, ETI itself “reserved” optional completeness nine\n\ntimes over the course of the hearing on the merits and exercised that right once.57\n\nNotably, seven of the times the Company reserved optional completeness for later\n\nadmission occurred prior to the ALJ’s ruling on the spreadsheet. ETI knew what\n\nwas required to exercise optional completeness in a PUC case at SOAH and\n\ncannot properly complain now that the spreadsheet’s exclusion from evidence was\n\nerror.\n\n         Further, the purpose behind optional completeness would not apply to the\n\nspreadsheet and OPUC Exhibit No. 6. The purpose behind the rule of optional\n\ncompleteness is “to reduce the possibility of the fact finder receiving a false\n\nimpression from hearing the evidence of only a part of a writing.”58 There are two\n\nthreshold requirements to invoke the rule of optional completeness: (1) an\n\nincomplete statement was introduced into evidence, and (2) the party offering the\n\n57\n   ETI reserved optional completeness on the following exhibits: Cities Exhibit No. 7\n(Transcript (Tr.) at 69, ll. 1-2); TIEC Exhibit No. 9 (Tr. at 183, ll. 17-21); OPUC Exhibit No. 10\n(Tr. at 282, l. 21-283, l. 1); Cities Exhibit No. 41 (Tr. at 968, ll.14-17); Cities Exhibit No. 43A (Tr.\nat 1456, ll. 4-5 and 15-20); Cities Exhibit No. 43B (Tr. at 1456, l. 21-1457, l.4); Cities Exhibit No.\n48 (Tr. at 2082, ll. 19-22); and OPUC Exhibit No. 35 (Tr. at 2095, ll. 1-25). ETI exercised its\nreserved right to optional completeness as ETI Exhibit No. 98 (Tr. at 1505, l. 16- 1507, l. 15).\nCities also reserved optional completeness on one ETI Exhibit (ETI Exhibit No. 83, Tr. at 1190, l.\n22-1191, l. 5) and exercised that reservation as Cities Exhibit No. 49 (Tr. at 1686, l. 15-1687, l. 7).\nThese transcripts are found in the Administrative Record in Binder 43, Volumes B, C, F, G, I, K,\nand M, and the cited excerpts are submitted here as Appendix 7.\n58\n   Gilmore v.

Minyard Foods, the Dallas\n\nCourt of Appeals found that the Defendant, Minyard Food Stores, may have\n\nsatisfied the first requirement but failed to meet the second. The court concluded\n\nthat, “Minyard clearly failed to meet the second requirement. . . . Minyard has\n\nmade no attempt to show how Rayshell's testimony could have confused or misled\n\nthe jury regarding the contents of Kern's affidavit or its meaning. . . . [T]he trial\n\ncourt erred in admitting the document.”60 Like in Crosby, admitting the remainder\n\nof the writing (here, the spreadsheet) would not serve to correct any false\n\nimpression or otherwise add to the Commission’s understanding. The five-page\n\nexcerpt was included as part of OPUC’s testimony to illustrate the naked\n\ngranularity of the data.       Five pages of line-by-line accounting entries paint the\n\npicture with sufficient clarity. Since the accuracy of the entries was not in\n\ndispute, “completing” the spreadsheet with the remaining 415 pages would not\n\nserve the purpose for which the optional completeness rule was intended to\n\naddress.\n\n\n\n\n59\n   Crosby v.

Title 2 of the code is properly cited as the Public\nUtility Regulatory Act.\n\n       This edition of the Public Utility Regulatory Act contains amendments adopted through\nthe 83rd Legislature, Third Called Session.\n\n        In general, the effect of amendments has been clear and the resulting text changes were\nstraightforward and did not require any editorial discretion. Except as explained below, editorial\ndiscretion was exercised in reconciling multiple amendments to the same section. In the majority\nof these cases, there was no irreconcilable conflict and all of the amendments could be given\neffect. In some cases, an act expressly amended a provision as added or amended by another act.\nIn the few cases where an irreconcilable conflict was found, the act with the later date of\nenactment was given effect, with the other provisions italicized below. In addition, a note\nexplaining the conflict is provided following the section annotation.\n\n        The annotations following each section have two components. The first annotation\nshows the derivation of the section, either citing to the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1995\n(V.A.C.S. Art. 1446c-O), Acts 1997, ch. 166, or showing the section as added to the code and\nciting the relevant act. The second component identifies subsequent amendments, cites the\namending act (and originating bill), provides a brief summary of each of the amendments, and,\nwhere appropriate, provides a reference to related provisions or material.\n\n       This publication is maintained by the Commission Advising and Docket Management\nDivision of the Public Utility Commission of Texas. Suggestions or corrections may be\nsubmitted to that division.\n\f                                           CHAPTER 36. RATES\n\n                            SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSec. 36.001. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH AND REGULATE RATES.\n    (a) The regulatory authority may establish and regulate rates of an electric utility and may adopt\nrules for determining:\n      ( 1)   the classification of customers and services; and\n      (2)    the applicability of rates.\n   (b) A rule or order of the regulatory authority may not conflict with a ruling of a federal regulatory\nbody.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-0, Sec. 2.201.)\nSec. 36.002.

JUST AND REASONABLE RATES.\n    (a) The regulatory authority shall ensure that each rate an electric utility or two or more electric\nutilities jointly make, demand, or receive is just and reasonable.\n   (b) A rate may not be unreasonably preferential, prejudicial, or discriminatory but must be sufficient,\nequitable, and consistent in application to each class of consumer.\n   (c) An electric utility may not:\n      (1) grant an unreasonable preference or advantage concerning rates to a person in a\n   classification;\n       (2) subject a person in a classification to an unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage concerning\n   rates; or\n      (3) establish or maintain an unreasonable difference concerning rates between localities or\n   between classes of service.\n  (d) In establishing an electric utility's rates, the commission may treat as a single class two or more\nmunicipalities that an electric utility serves if the commission considers that treatment to be appropriate.\n    (e) A charge to an individual customer for retail or wholesale electric service that is less than the\nrate approved by the regulatory authority does not constitute an impermissible difference, preference, or\nadvantage.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-0, Sees. 2.202, 2.214 (part).)\nSec. 36.004. EQUALITY OF RATES AND SERVICES.\n   (a) An electric utility may not directly or indirectly charge, demand, or receive from a person a\ngreater or lesser compensation for a service provided or to be provided by the utility than the\ncompensation prescribed by the applicable tariff filed under Section 32.101.\n  (b) A person may not knowingly receive or accept a service from an electric utility for a\ncompensation greater or less than the compensation prescribed by the tariff.\n    (c) Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (b), an electric utility may charge an individual customer\nfor wholesale or retail electric service in accordance with Section 36.007.\n\n\n                                                         79\n\f   (d) This title does not prevent a cooperative corporation from returning to its members net earnings\nresulting from its operations in proportion to the members' purchases from or through the corporation.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-O, Sees. 2.215(a), (b).)\nSec. 36.005.

BURDEN OF PROOF ..\n   In a proceeding involving a proposed rate change, the electric utility has the burden of proving that:\n       (1)   the rate change is just and reasonable, if the utility proposes the change; or\n       (2)   an existing rate is just and reasonable, if the proposal is to reduce the rate.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-O, Sec. 2.204.)\nSec. 36.007. DISCOUNTED WHOLESALE OR RETAIL RATES.\n    (a) On application by an electric utility, a regulatory authority may approve wholesale or retail\ntariffs or contracts containing charges that are less than rates approved by the regulatory authority but not\nless than the utility's marginal cost. The charges must be in accordance with the principles of this title\nand may not be unreasonably preferential, prejudicial, discriminatory, predatory, or anticompetitive.\n   (b) The method for computing the marginal cost of the electric utility consists of energy and capacity\ncomponents. The energy component includes variable operation and maintenance expense and marginal\nfuel or the energy component of purchased power. The capacity component is based on the annual\neconomic value of deferring, accelerating, or avoiding the next increment of needed capacity, without\nregard to whether the capacity is purchased or built.\n    (c) The commission shall ensure that the method for determining marginal cost is consistently\napplied among utilities but may recognize the individual load and resource requirements of the electric\nutility.\n    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the commission shall ensure that the electric\nutility's allocable costs of serving customers paying discounted rates under this section are not borne by\nthe utility's other customers.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-O, Sees. 2.001(b), (c), (d) (part), 2.052(b), (c).)\nSec. 36.008. STATE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM.\n   In establishing rates for an electric utility, the commission may review the state's transmission system\nand make recommendations to the utility on the need to build new power lines, upgrade power lines, and\nmake other necessary improvements and additions.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-O, Sec. 2.051(w) (part).) (Amended by Acts 1999, 76th Leg., R.S., ch. 405 (SB 7), § 23.)\nSec. 36.009. BILLING DEMAND FOR CERTAIN UTILITY CUSTOMERS.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, the commission by rule shall require a transmission\nand distribution utility to:\n      (1) waive the application of demand ratchet provisions for each nonresidential secondary service\n   customer that has a maximum load factor equal to or below a factor set by commission rule;\n      (2) implement procedures to verify annually whether each nonresidential secondary service\n   customer has a maximum load factor that qualifies the customer for the waiver described by\n   Subdivision (1);\n                                                           80\n\f      (3) specify in the utility's tariff whether the utility's nonresidential secondary service customers\n   that qualify for the waiver described by Subdivision ( 1) are to be billed for distribution service\n   charges on the basis of:\n      (A) kilowatts;\n      (B)    kilowatt-hours; or\n       (C)   kilovolt-amperes; and\n      (4) modify the utility's tariff in the utility's next base rate case to implement the waiver described\n   by Subdivision (1) and make the specification required by Subdivision (3).\n   (Added by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., ch. 150 (HB 1064), § 1.)\n\n                          SUBCHAPTER B. COMPUTATION OF RATES\n\nSec. 36.051. ESTABLISHING OVERALL REVENUES.\n   In establishing an electric utility's rates, the regulatory authority shall establish the utility's overall\nrevenues at an amount that will permit the utility a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable return on\nthe utility's invested capital used and useful in providing service to the public in excess of the utility's\nreasonable and necessary operating expenses.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-O, Sec. 2.203(a).)\nSec. 36.052.

I446c-O, Sec. 2.208(b).) (Amended by Acts I999, 76th Leg., R.S., ch. 405 (SB 7), § 25 (amended\n   subsec. (d)); Acts 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 4I3 (SB I668), § I (amended subd. (c)(2)).)\nSec. 36.059. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS.\n   (a) In determining the allocation of tax savings derived from liberalized depreciation and\namortization, the investment tax credit, and the application of similar methods, the regulatory authority\nshall:\n       (1)    balance equitably the interests of present and future customers; and\n       (2)    apportion accordingly the benefits between consumers and the electric or municipally owned\n   utility.\n   (b) If an electric utility or a municipally owned utility retains a portion of the investment tax credit,\nthat portion shall be deducted from the original cost of the facilities or other addition to the rate base to\nwhich the credit applied to the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. l446c-O, Sees. 2.I5I(c), (d).)\nSec. 36.060. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RETURNS.\n    (a) If an expense is allowed to be included in utility rates or an investment is included in the utility\nrate base, the related income tax benefit must be included in the computation of income tax expense to\nreduce the rates. If an expense is not allowed to be included in utility rates or an investment is not\nincluded in the utility rate base, the related income tax benefit may not be included in the computation of\nincome tax expense to reduce the rates. The income tax expense shall be computed using the statutory\nincome tax rates.\n    (b) The amount of income tax that a consolidated group of which an electric utility is a member\nsaves, because the consolidated return eliminates the intercompany profit on purchases by the utility from\nan affiliate, shall be applied to reduce the cost of the property or service purchased from the affiliate.\n   (c) The investment tax credit allowed against federal income taxes, to the extent retained by the\nelectric utility, shall be applied as a reduction in the rate-based contribution of the assets to which the\ncredit applies, to the extent and at the rate allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. I446c-O, Sec. 2.208(c).)     (Amended by Acts 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 787 (SB I364), § I\n   (amended subsec. (a)).)\nSec. 36.061.

A regulatory authority shall allow as a cost or expense a cost or expense of the bill\npayment assistance program. The electric utility is entitled to:\n      (1)    fully recover all costs and expenses related to the bill payment assistance program;\n      (2) defer each cost or expense related to the bill payment assistance program not explicitly\n   included in base rates; and\n      (3) apply carrying charges at the utility's weighted average cost of capital to the extent related to\n   the bill payment assistance program.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-0, Sees. 2.152(b), (c), (d), (e).)

CONSIDERATION OF PROFIT OR LOSS FROM SALE OR LEASE OF\n   MERCHANDISE.\n    In establishing an electric or municipally owned utility's rates, the regulatory authority may not\nconsider any profit or loss that results from the sale or lease of merchandise, including appliances,\nfixtures, or equipment, to the extent that merchandise is not integral to providing utility service.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-O, Sees. 2.151(b) (part), (d).)\nSec. 36.064. SELF-INSURANCE.\n   (a) An electric utility may self-insure all or part of the utility's potential liability or catastrophic\nproperty loss, including windstorm, fire, and explosion losses, that could not have been reasonably\nanticipated and included under operating and maintenance expenses.\n    (b) The commission shall approve a self-insurance plan under this section if the commission finds\nthat:\n\n                                                          84\n\f      (1)    the coverage is in the public interest;\n      (2) the plan, considering all costs, is a lower cost alternative to purchasing commercial\n   insurance; and\n      (3)    ratepayers will receive the benefits of the savings.\n   (c) In computing an electric utility's reasonable and necessary expenses under this subchapter, the\nregulatory authority, to the extent the regulatory authority finds is in the public interest, shall allow as a\nnecessary expense the money credited to a reserve account for self-insurance.

(EGS or the Company). The Commission concludes that the quality of EGS'\nelectric service to its customers in Texas has been less than adequate, specifically sin9e\nEntergy Corporation acquired Gulf States Utilities, Inc., in 1993. The record evidence\nreveals a lack of effective and prudent maintenance policies, uneven spending in the area\nof operations and maintenance (O&M), cuts in experienced personnel, and consequent\ndeterioration in the quality of service. The management of EGS is structured in a way\nthat fails to link resource availability with appropriate performance accountability.\n\n\n           The Commission further concludes that the difficulties EGS has experienced with\nits quality of service are not simply \"customer perception\" problems, as claimed by the\nCompany. 1 The problems are real and must be addressed by the Company in a timely\nand serious manner.             To motivate the Company to revise its current approach and\npromote long-term commitment toward service quality and reliability, the Commission\norders a two-part solution designed both to deal with past problems and implement\nremedies for the future. First, the Company's authorized return on equity (ROE) that\notherwise would be adopted in Docket No. 16705 2 will be reduced by 60-basis points and\ninitially refunded to distribution-level customers. Second, going forward, the Company\n\n1\n    EGS Initial Brief (IB) at 4 (Dec. 2, 1997); see also, Tr. at 231.\n\n2\n  Application of Entergy Texas for Approval of Its Transition to Competition Plan and the Tariffs\nImplementing the Plan, and for the Auth~rity to Reconcile Fuel Costs, to Set Revised Fuel Costs, to Set\nRevised Fuel Factors, and to Recover a Surcharge for Underrecovered Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705\n(pending).\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                              Page2\n\n\nwill have an opportunity to earn back a portion of the ROE reduction, depending on\nwhether its service quality meets specified benchmarks. These benchmarks will establish\nservice reliability standards (outage frequency and duration) and customer service\nstandards (billing errors, call-center performance, service installation, line extension, and\nstreet light replacement). The margin achieved above the benchmarks will reflect the\nlevel of improvement (or, if below, a lack thereof) and will be used to determine whether\nthe Company is entitled to recoup a portion of the ROE reduction.\n\n\n\n\n                                      I.          Procedural History\n\n\n          EGS filed its transition/rate case in Docket No. 16705 on November 27, 1996.\nThe Commission referred the case to the State Office of Administrative Hearings\n(SOAH) on December 5, 1996.                  On January 24, 1997, the Commission issued a\npreliminary order in Docket No. 16705 directing parties, among other things, to \"address\nspecific service quality standards that will apply after the transition [proposed by EGS].\"3\n\n\n          On March 7, 1997, the Commission issued a supplemental preliminary order in\nDocket No. 16705 that dealt specifically with service quality issues. This order required\nthat Docket No. 16705 address, in addition to others, the following issues: (1) Does EGS\nhave an effective and prudent management policy in place that devotes sufficient\nresources to ensure adequate and reliable service to its ratepayers? (2) Are there patterns\nof variable service quality in EGS' service territory, and if so, what is the cause and\npotential resolution of these variations? and (3) What procedures can and should the\nCommission implement to monitor service quality on EGS' system, and to respond to\nsituations in which EGS' service quality falls below the service quality benchmark\nlevels?\n\n\n\n3\n    Preliminary Order at 12 (January 24, 1997).\n\f    PUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                 Page3\n\n         Proceeding with EGS' rate case, SOAH established a four-phased hearing\nschedule to address the numerous transition and rate issues in Docket No. 16705. The\nservice quality issues were to be dealt with in the \"Competitive Issues\" phase, scheduled\nto begin in early November 1997.\n\n\n        After EGS and interested parties had filed written testimony and exhibits, 4 but\nbefore the Competitive Issues phase commenced at SOAH, the Commission determined\nthat it would itselfhear and resolve the service quality issues. Accordingly, on November\n4, 1997, the Commission issued an order severing the pending service quality issues from\nDocket No. 16705, establishing Docket No. 18249 to deal with those issues, and\nestablishing procedures by which the Commission would hear and rule on the case.\n\n\n        The Commission convened a hearing on the merits of EGS' service quality on\nNovember 20 and 21, 1997.            Chairman Pat Wood and Commissioner Judy Walsh\npresided over the hearing. The participating parties included the Company, the Cities, the\nHigh Load Factor Commercial Customer Group (HLFCCG), and the General Counsel, all\nof whom presented their direct cases and conducted cross-examinations. Chairman Wood\nand Commissioner Walsh also directed questions to the witnesses. Observers from the\nOffice of Public Utility Counsel (OPUC) and the Attorney General's Office attended the\nhearing. The active parties filed initial and reply briefs on December 2 and 9, 1997,\nrespectively. OPUC filed a statement on December 2, 1997, supporting the briefs of the\nCities and HLFCCG, and the Attorney General's Office filed a statement on December 9,\n1997, in support of the same briefs.\n\n\n        The Commission issued the final order in this docket on February 13, 1998. On\nMarch 5, 1998, EGS and General Counsel filed motions for rehearing. The replies to the\nmotions were due on March 16, 1998, but based on parties' request, the Commission\n\n\n4\n  Some of the testimony, particularly from the Company's witnesses, was originally pre-filed for the\nRevenue Requirement phase.\n\f    PUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                  Page4\n\n\ngranted an extension for filing of replies until March 25, 1998. On March 19, 1998, the\nCommission ratified the extension of deadline to file replies and also extended until May\n    14, 1998, the time to rule on the motions for rehearing pursuant to Gov'T CODE\n2001.146(e).\n\n\n           On March 25, 1998, the parties filed a joint reply to motions for rehearing and\nmotion for entry of order consistent with the parties' stipulation and agreement (the\nStipulation). General Counsel, EGS, OPUC, and lll.-FCCG signed the Stipulation. At\nthe April 1, 1998 open meeting, the Commission granted rehearing and approved the\nStipulation.

Discussion and Analysis of Issues\n\n\nA. General Concept of Reliability\n\n\n           Electricity plays a vital role in our lives. Most, if not all, aspects of our society,\nincluding industrial production, commerce, and individual lifestyles, are built around a\nreliable and adequate supply of electrical energy.                  People have come to depend on\n\n7\n  Entergy Arkansas (including the Arklahoma Corporation), Inc., Entergy Louisiana, Inc., Entergy\nMississippi, Inc., and Entergy New Orleans, Inc. These companies, together with EGS, form the\n\"Operating Companies.\"\n8\n     Ice Storm '97 Field Investigations, Project No. 16301, at V-25 (June 24, 1997).\n9\n     General Counsel Ex. 5, Burrows Direct Testimony at 33, Attachment JDB-2.\n10\n     General Counsel Ex. 24.\n11\n     General Counsel Ex. 1, Ethridge Direct Testimony at 6.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                   Page6\n\nel<~ctricity   being available when they need it. In fact, for most customers, delivery of\nelectrical power and reliability of its delivery have become two inseparable expectations.\nElectric utilities generally recognize and accept this dependence and have responded to it\nby constructing and operating generation and delivery systems of superior reliability. 12\nState law formalizes the utilities' obligation to provide reliable service in PURA\n§ 37.151. Reliability, however, is not a static concept. As customer bases grow and\nsystems age, utilities face new challenges that must be acknowledged and resolved to\nmaintain reliable service.\n\n\n          In addition to sufficient generating capacity, transmission and distribution\nfacilities are built so that a specified degree of reliability is achieved. The goal is to\nprovide required amounts of energy with no, or few, interruptions, while maintaining a\nreasonable cost of the overall system. Smooth and continuous interaction of the various\nelements of the electrical system results in reliable performance of the overall system.\nFor consumers, this reliability is reflected in uninterrupted power supply, the degree of\nwhich may be measured by the frequency, duration, and magnitude of adverse effects on\nconsumer service.\n\n\nB. Legal Standards\n\n\n          PURA imposes various obligations on utilities and the Co:mrtlission regarding the\nprovision of electric service to Texas consumers. Specifically, PURA § 37.151 requires\nthat a regulated utility provide continuous and adequate service in its certificated service\nterritory.     PURA § 38.001 directs utilities to furnish service, instrumentalities, and\nfacilities that are safe, adequate, efficient, and reasonable. Parallel responsibilities rest\nwith the Commission. In accordance with PURA § 36.052(3), the Commission must\nconsider the quality of a utility's services in establishing a reasonable return on invested\n\n\n\n\n12\n     NORTH AMERICAN ELECTRIC RELIABILI1Y COUNCIL, RELIABILITY CONCEPTS 1-2 (Feb. 1985).\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                            Page7\n\n           13\ncapital.        This same section of PURA directs the Commission to consider the quality of\nthe utility's management and the efficiency of its operations when establishing a\nreasonable return. Moreover, PURA § 38.071 authorizes the Commission to order an\nelectric utility to provide \"specified\" improvements in its service.\n\n\nC. Analysis of Issues\n\n\n           The Commission's analysis of the issues in this case is divided into five general\ntopics: (1) physical facil,ities, maintenance, and monitoring; (2) vegetation management;\n(3) emergency preparedness, response, outage restoration, and treatment of storm data;\n(4) personnel levels, management practices, and spending levels; and (5) pockets of\nunreliable service and overall customer service.                 The following narrative lays out\nessential points of the relevant issues; with additional, specific information contained in\nthe Findings of Fact in Section IV.\n\n\n1. Physical Facilities, Maintenance, and Monitoring\n\n\n           a. Condition of Poles\n         As stated above, EGS' transmission system does not pose serious concerns since\nit has performed adequately over the last few years, during which only a minimal number\nof transmission-related outages or circuit-breaker operations occurred. EGS' inspection\nand treatment programs relating to its transmission system seem to be working\n\n\n\n13\n     There are several precedent cases in which the Commission reduced ROE to address inadequate quality\nof service. See, e.g., Application of General Telephone Company of the Southwest for Authority to\nIncrease Rates, Docket No. 3094, Final Order, 6 P.U.C. BULL. 92, 123 (Aug. 8, 1980) (imposing penalty\non company for inadequate service quality); Application of General Telephone Company of the Southwest\nfor Authority to Increase Rates, Docket No. 3690, Final Order, 7 P.U.C.

The remainder of this Order will address the\nCompany's distribution system and related services.\n\n\n            Primary evidence for the condition of EGS' distribution system, including wires,\npoles, pole appurtenances, and transformers, comes from the Osmose Wood Preserving\nCompany (Osmose) inspections conducted in 1995 and 1996, a report filed by Drash\nConsulting Engineering, Inc. (Drash), and limited Staff surveys. 15 In general, most of the\npoles in the Texas portion of the Company's distribution system are in good condition.\nThere are, however, numerous poles with physical deficiencies or in need of extensive\nand comprehensive vegetation clearing. 16\n\n\n            The Osmose inspectors, contracted by EGS in 1995 and 1996, examined\napproximat~ly       37,000, or 10 percent, of the poles and crossarms and found that on\n                                                                                              17\naverage 17.9 percent of poles in eight different areas showed structural decay.                    The\nactual percentages, however, varied greatly, with one area having more than 37 percent of\nthe poles with some decay, a condition clearly impermissible for any transmission and\ndistributi~n (T&D) system. 18 While the Osmose inspections were not random, and in\nfact, as the Company asserts, focused on particularly troubled spots, the results show that\nthere are many poles in unsatisfactory condition.\n\n\n\n\n14\n     General Counsel Ex. 1, Ethridge Direct Testimony at 6-8, 41-43.\n15\n  General Counsel Ex. 1, Ethridge Direct Testimony at 15; General Counsel Ex. 4; General Counsel Ex. 5,\nBurrows Direct Testimony, Attachment JDB-3.\n16\n     /d. at 5.\n17\n     General Counsel Ex. 5, Burrows Direct Testimony at 17.\n18\n     Id, Appendix Workpapers at 2.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                               Page9\n\n\n            The purpose of the Drash report, contracted for by the Commission, was to collect\ndata regarding the condition of EGS' overhead distribution system. The survey was\nbased on a sample of33 uniformly distributed substations from the Texas portion of EGS\ndistribution system. 19 The Drash inspectors examined 582 poles on various feeders\noriginating at these su'Qstations. 20 The Drash survey found 59 poles with structural\ndeficiencies and 72 poles with ROW encroachments? 1 During the hearing, EGS raised\nquestions about the accuracy and statistical reliability of the Drash report.            The\nCommission concludes that the Drash study lacked specific evaluation criteria and\nnecessary randomness to draw conclusions about the entire EGS Texas system. The\nCommission, however, does not reject the Drash report, as requested by the Company;22\nrather, the Commission relies on the report to the extent that its findings have been\nconfirmed by the Osmose inspections and Staff surveys.             Considered together, the\ncollected data persuasively indicate that numerous poles show decay, are in need of repair\nor replacement, and that vegetation growth poses a serious problem on some ROW.\n\n\n            b. Pole Inspection Program\n            The Company conceded that it does not have a traditional pole inspection\nprogr~ in place.23 Since the Osmose inspections in 1996, there have been no pole or\ncrossarm inspections on Texas territory. 24 Post-merger, EGS reduced the number of\ninspections; for example, in 1995, 29,294 poles and 43,941 crossarms were inspected, but\n                                                                           25\nin 1996, only 7,939 poles and 11,908 crossarms underwent inspections.

Maintenance Practices\n           A review of maintenance records shows that line maintenance and vegetation\ncontrol are reactive in nature;27 there is a lack of written, specific, and preventive\nmaintenance policies;28 and priority is given to capital additions to the detriment of\nadequate maintenance practices. 29 For example, total line-miles actively maintained by\nthe Company's employees dropped 30 percent from 1994 to 1996?0 The Company's\ninternal risk assessment study points to an absence of a strategic plan, and consequent\ninadequacies in resource sharing and work planning. 31                  Based on the evidence, the\nCommission concludes that EGS has failed to establish and carry out distribution\nmaintenance policies in a manner sufficient to ensure adequate and reliable delivery of\nelectric service.\n\n\n           d. Data Collection\n           The Company presented a variety of data to support its claim of good\nperformance; however, the accuracy of its data collection practices came under a great\ndeal of scrutiny during the hearing, bringing into question the ability of the Company to\n\n26\n     Tr. at 751-52.\n27\n     General Counsel Ex. 4, Gonzalez Direst Testimony at 6-8, Drash Report at 45-46.\n28\n     Tr. at 59; HLFCCG Ex.

The parties debated at length the merits and mechanics of\nvarious system monitoring tools and reporting standards. These include: (1) System\nAverage Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), a measure of the number of interruptions\nper year for the average customer;32 (2) System Average Interruption Duration Index\n(SAIDI), a measure of the total interruption time experienced by the average customer; 33\n(3) Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI), defined as the ratio of\nSAIDIISAIFI; 34 ( 4)         Distribution Interruption System (DIS), a database to capture\nreliability performance and indices for individual feeders; 35 (5) Average System\nAvailability Index (ASAI)/ 6 a measure of the total time of service availability to the\naverage customer; and (6) TACTICS, which captures data on every device        ~own   to the\ntransformer level to measure each device's operational performance and impact on\ncustomers. 37 In addition, the Company utilizes a System Control and Data Acquisition\ndevice (SCADA) to measure data for large interruptions such as feeder breaker outages/ 8\nand the new Automatic Mapping and Facilities Management System (AMJFM),\ndeveloped in order to determine where an outage occurred and what device caused it,\nwhich will be completed by the year 2000. 39\n\n\n            General Counsel, Cities, and HLFCCG argued that the number of customers\naffected by outages and the duration of such outages are difficult to determine because\n\n\n\n32\n     HLFCCG Ex. 1, Patton Direct Testimony at 9-12.\n33\n     Id. at 10.\n\n34   !d.\n3S           .\n     !d. at 11.\n36\n     General Counsel Ex. 3, Eckhoff Direct Testimony at 20.\n37\n     Tr. at 448-450.\n38\n     Tr. at 238, 443.\n39\n     Tr. at 429-30.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                     Page 12\n\n\nEGS excluded relevant information between 1994 and 1996.4° For example, for the first\nsix months of 1996, the Company reported 35 to 40 percent fewer outages than were\nreported on average during the first six months of the years 1991-94.41 In trying to\nexplain the discrepancies in the data, Company officials described changing data\ncollection standards applied to the various outage-causing events. At different times, the\nCompany excluded outages caused by equipment failures; outages affecting feeders with\nfewer than 500 customers; storms, generation or transmission outages; or trees falling\ninto the ROW (\"non-preventable\" trees). 42 The Company data is generally confusing\nand comparisons over a period of several years are difficult to make because of changing\nstandards; 43 in addition, the inaccuracies are further compounded because, for example,\noutages on feeders with fewer than 500 customers can nevertheless result in very long\noutage durations, especially when those feeders are energized last. 44\n\n\n           The evidence shows that Company linemen sometimes made subjective\ndeterminations as to the cause, duration, or effect of an outage, thus causing the\nCompany's SAIFI and SAID! numbers to be unreliable. 45 The evidence also revealed\n                                                                            46\nthat most historically deficient feeders serve rural customers.                  This observation is\nsupported by EGS' testimony that it prioritizes restoration of feeders serving the greatest\nnumbers of customers, thus leaving those in lower-density areas (most likely rural) to\n                                                                       47\nexperience recurring and longer service reliability problems.\n\n\n40\n     See HLFCCG Ex. 2, Entergy Southwest Reliability Report 1.994-1996; Tr. at 41-43.\n41\n     HLFCCG Ex. 3 at slide 9.\n42\n     Tr. at 41-44, 54, 62-66.\n43\n     Id; HLFCCG Ex. 2 at Bates Stamp 0232514.\n44\n     Tr. at 67.\n45\n     Tr. at 47-48.\n46\n     Tr. at 707, 821\n47\n  The Rebuttal (redacted) Testimony of Dereck Hasbrouck on behalf of the Company contains this quote:\n\"One important fact to keep in mind when considering a customer or group of customers who consistently\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                            Page 13\n\n\n            General Counsel, Cities, and HLFCCG asserted that the Company has\nmanipulated information to show better performance. 48 A significant problem with the\nCompany's use of performance and reliability indices is that they reflect outage\nfrequency and duration on a system-wide rather than feeder-by-feeder basis which can\nmask poor performance of individual.feeders. 49 For example, EGS reported a syst_em-\nwide SAIDI of 133 minutes for 1996,50 but this measure failed to reveal that 83 feeders or\nprimary circuits experienced outage times in excess of 200 minutes. 51                        The average\ncustomer on these circuits experienced an outage duration of 3.3 hours. 52 More notably,\ncustomers on feeder Tamina encountered 41.3 hours of outage time in one year. 53 It is\napparent that system-wide averages used by the Company cannot be relied on to disclose\nmany of the localized service difficulties.\n\n\n           The historic data presented by the Company is not accurate and consistent as the\nCompany itself admitted to not collecting all relevant data, 54 changing the standards for\n                                                                      55\ndata collection, and submitting inconsistent data for ASAI and SAIFI.                             Even the\n\n\n\nreceive less reliable service than the average customer is that there are geographic and environmental\nconditions beyond the utility's control. These conditions, in combination with the construction cost\nconsiderations may effectively limit the realistic reliability expectations for customers in certain areas.

The\nCommission finds that the level of EGS' service quality and reliability, as documented\nthrough the Company data, is unreliable because the data fail to record and report all\nevents accurately and consistently. Pockets of inadequate service are ignored by system-\nwide measures, and such measures do not identify recurring individual-feeder problems.\n\n\n2. Vegetation Management\n\n\n           Vegetation management is the catch-all description for programs involving the\nremoval of trees, bushes, or vines that overhang, grow into, or toward conductors strung\nalong the Company's ROW. The purpose of vegetation management is to ensure, to the\ngreatest extent possible, that vegetation in, or near, the ROW does not come into contact\nwith the conductors and thereby cause wire breakage or ground faults. 58 During the\nhearing, Company witnesses referred to scheduled tree trimming, carried out on a three-\nyear cycle in urban. areas and a six-year cycle in rural areas. The evidence presented,\nhowever, was not clear on whether EGS actually followed the stated cycles. 59\nNonetheless, the Company argued that its vegetation management has been adequate and\n\n\n\n\n56\n     Cities Ex.

The majority of incidents included in the evidence involve three\ntypes of vegetation-related damage: wires expanding down into vegetation due to\nincreased load or lack of under-clearance; overhanging limbs breaking or growing into\nwires in non-inclement weather; and limbs or trees bending or breaking onto wires due to\nwind, ice build-up, or other adverse weather conditions. These parties also argued that\nthe ROW surveyed were in need of extensive clearing and that vegetation encroachments\nposed unacceptable risks. 62           Cities claimed that neglected vegetation management\nmultiplied the severity of the ice storm in January 1997. 63 The number and duration of\n                                                                                           64\nvegetation-caused service interruptions almost doubled in the last four years,                  and\n                                                                            65\nvegetation-related SAIDI and SAIFI have worsened since the merger.\n\n\n           The author of a vegetation management study, commissioned by the Company,\nobserved that there were areas where maintenance clearing had been deferred until brush\nreached the conductors. 66 The study proposed specific and comprehensive ways for\n\n\n\n60\n   EGS Ex. 10, Ervin Rebuttal Testimony at 55, 59.

An e-mail sent in August of 1997 by an EGS network manager in\nBeaumont identified trees touching· conductors as one of the preventable root causes of\nseveral recent outages. 67\n\n\n            The Commission concludes that the level of the Company's vegetation\nmanagement is unacceptable and has significantly affected the reliability of the\ndistribution system in recent years. While such a deficiency may not in itself impact a\ntypical system severely, this deficiency is magnified when the inadequacy of the\ninfrastructure and the nature of the weather in the Company's service area are taken into\naccount. 68 The lack of preventive vegetation control efforts, by the Company and neglect\nof regular vegetation clearing have led to the creation of unnecessary risks.                The\nCommission does not suggest that \"ground-to-sky\" tree trimming is necessary, but the\nCompany clearly has significant room for improvement. The recent hiring of 30 new\nvegetation clearance crews, while welcome, confirms the existence of an unacceptable\nbacklog in vegetation control. 69 As will be discussed below, the Commission is also\nconcerned that managers in Texas have no clear line of authority or resources necessary\nto implement effective vegetation management policies.\n\n\n\n\n66\n    General Counsel Ex. 27, Environmental Consultants, Inc., Report on Distribution Line Clearance\nProgram (Jul. 1994) at 1-2-3.\n67\n     HLFCCG Ex. 6.\n68\n     Tr. at 308.\n69\n     Tr. at 730-31, 787.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                         Page 17\n\n3. Emergency Preparedness, Response, Outage Restoration, and Treatment of\nStorm Data\n\n\n            a. January 1997 Ice Storm\n            In mid-January 1997, many parts of Texas experienced a severe ice storm;\n                                                                                         70\ndisruptions of electric service were sustained by most utilities in the state.                The impact\non EGS' territory was particularly hard. At one time, up to 120,000 of EGS' customers\nwere without power and it took seven days to complete the restoration process. 71\nUtilizing help from other utilities and contract workers, EGS had more than 2,700\npersonnel working to restore service. 72 In assessing the Company's performance, EGS\nofficials compared it to that of other utilities and concluded that its efforts were not only\nadequate, but even \"very good.'m They blamed most of the damage on excessive ice.74\n\n\n           This view was not shared by the other parties. 75 HLFCCG played excerpts from\ntaped conversations conducted by the Company's dispatchers during the storm, which\nhighlighted insufficient numbers of personnel and initially inadequate efforts to repair the\ndamage.76 The Cities asserted that they had to use their own employees for repairs,\nincluding the handling of live wires, 77 and that in some instances they were unable to\nreach Company employees at a11. 78 One of the Cities' exhibits was a letter, dated August\n\n\n70\n     General Counsel Ex. 2B, Hughes Workpapers, Ice Storm '97 Field Investigations Project 16301 at 11-1.\n\n71\n     EGS Ex. 8, Ervin Supplemental Direct Testimony at 53.\n\n72   Jd.\n\n73\n     Jd. at 74.\n74\n     Id. at 74-75.\n15\n     Tr. at 379; Cities Ex. 1, Lawton Direct Testimony at 12.\n76\n     Tr. at 87-92.\n77\n     Tr. at 376.\n78\n     Cities Ex. 2, Kimler Direct Testimony at 2.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                         Page 18\n\n\n17, 1995, from several fire chiefs in EGS' service territory to the Company describing\nvarious problems with emergency procedures, such as not being able to reach the\nCompany's 1-800 telephone number, and, apparently, this problem persisted. 79 Some\nother cities' representatives testified, however, that the Company's restoration efforts\nwere good. 80 The significant disparities in the Company's response to the qamage caused\nby the ice storm suggest a need for greater and clearer communication between the\nCompany and all cities, including development of contacts before an emergency occurs.\n\n\n           The Company has an emergency plan on file with the Commission; the plan\ncontains no obvious deficiencies. 81 As is industry practice, EGS also has agreements\nwith other utilities for emergency cooperation; those agreements, however, are not in\nwriting. 82\n\n\n           The January 1997 ice storm was certainly a severe storm that would have\nadversely affected even the best-maintained distribution system.      EGS' distribution\nsystem, however, is not the best-maintained. A major cause of the outages during the\nstorm were broken or bowed ice-laden tree limbs overhanging the wires. Tree limbs in\nROW overhanging distribution lines pose a threat to system reliability, and are largely\nwithin EGS' control. The Company's failure to clear the limbs before the storm was a\n                                                                               83\nmajor factor in the number and duration of outages experienced by customers.        While\nCompany's initial efforts to mobilize and deploy additional non-EGS personnel were\nslow and cause concern, 84 vegetation management failures greatly aggravated the\n\n\n79\n     Cities Ex. 2, Kimler Direct Testimony at 7.\n80\n     Tr. at 377, 381, 391.\n81\n     General Counsel Ex. 2, Hughes Direct Testimony at 21.\n82\n     Tr. at 676-77.\n83\n     General Counsel Ex. 2, Hughes Direct Testimony at 17.\n84\n     Tr. at 379.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                Page 19\n\n\nsituation. The Company has experienced major storms in 1994, 1995, and 1997. 85 The\nweather, however, cannot be an excuse for poor service.

Treatment of Storm Data\n            The Commission has required utilities to report the causes of interruptions,\nincluding the extreme storms. EGS, however, excludes outage duration and frequency\ndata from its SAIDI and SAIFI reports if the data are attributable to a \"major storm.\"86\nAs defined currently by the Commission, major storms include situations in which there\nis a loss of power to 10 percent or more of customers in a region over a 24-hour period\nand full restoration is not achieved within 24 hours. 87 EGS' definition of a major storm\ncounts any event in which 10 percent or more of a region's customers are interrupted for\n                                                                       88\n24 hours or more, and is similar to the Commission's definition.\n\n\n            HLFCCG argued that interruptions associated with major storms should be\nincluded in the computation of reliability indices. HLFCCG maintains that the design\nand maintenance of lines, and therefore their condition under the stress of severe weather,\nis within the control of the utility. 89            Exclusion of major-storm interruptions from\nreliability indices could encourage reduced preventive maintenance, including vegetation\n                                                                            90\nmanagement, and reductions in force needed for restoration efforts.\n\n\n\n\n8S\n     Tr. at214, 377.\n86\n     Tr. at 54.\n87\n     EGS Ex. 10, Ervin Rebuttal Testimony at 30.\n\n88   /d.\n\n89\n     HLFCCG Ex. 1, Patton Direct Testimony at 14.\n90\n     /d. at 15.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                      Page20\n\n\n           The Commission is reluctant to allow the Company to exclude major-storm data\nfrom its overall reports because such reports may be incorrectly perceived as an\nindication that overall service quality is better than it actually is. Also, leaving major-\nstorm data out may obscure the fact that poor management and maintenance, and not just\nthe severity of the weather, contribute to or cause a weather event to become serious\nenough to be classified as a \"major storm.\"                 Despite a great deal of controverting\ntestimony by customer groups, the Company continues to assert that the acknowledged\nproblems during the 1997 ice storm were a \"storm-of-the-century\" aberration. 91\nAllowing the Company to carve out major storms from its outage-reporting data would\nmask the seriousness of service quality problems that occur on its system under all\nconditions.\n\n\n           The Commission understands that if a truly major storm affects the system, the\nCompany cannot be expected to restore power and respond to increased customer calls as\n                                                       I\n\n\nfast as it would in a more \"normal\" or day-to-day situations. Therefore, the Commission\nwill allow the segregation of major from non-major storm data in outage frequency and\nduration reports. The major storms, defined by the severity of the weather conditions,\nrather than by the outage duration, will be reported and evaluated separately, as discussed\nin the \"Remedies\" section below.\n\n\n4. Personnel Levels and Management Practices; Spending Levels\n\n\n           a. Personnel Levels\n           All parties agreed that post-merger personnel cuts were executed, ostensibly, in\norder to save costs. The Company asserted that cuts were possible because of increased\nefficiencies and that the permanent employees were simply replaced with contract\nworkers. 92 The other parties maintained that cuts were not only too extensive, but\n\n91\n     Tr. at 225; EGS Ex. 10, Ervin Rebuttal Testimony at 32-35.\n92\n   Tr. at 160, 236; EGS Ex. 8, Ervin Supplemental Direct at 19; EGS Ex. 10, Ervin Rebuttal Testimony at\n51.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                        Page21\n\n\nresulted in a loss of many years of worker experience that could not be compensated for\nby contract workers who may lack knowledge of the system or loyalty to the Company.\nFor example, General Counsel witness Ethridge cited the forced departure of 66\nemployees with an average of 18 years of experience each. 93 A precise number of lost\nemployees was not conclusively proven: the Company maintained that total net loss was\nonly 23,94 but HLFCCG, for instance, asserted that in the space of three years, the jobs of\n671inemen were eliminated. 95\n\n\n           A related issue concerned the Company's ability to evaluate contract workers'\nperformance: while the Company felt confident about increased efficiency of its hiring\npractices, it did admit to not having performance measures for contract workers. 96\nGeneral Counsel presented Company documents showing that controls over contract\nworker management were not effective.97 An internal risk assessment audit, conducted\nby the Company, also concluded that no formal and consistent process existed to monitor\ncontractor performance, that management employees did not generate necessary reports\nto allow proper monitoring, and that distribution contracts were not competitively bid. 98\nAn additional concern presented by Cities dealt with the decrease in the number of\noperational staff while regulatory staff increased; this led Cities to conclude that the\n                                                                             99\nCompany had insufficient focus on system maintenance matters.\n\n\n\n\n93\n     General Counsel Ex. 1, Ethridge Direct Testimony at 37.\n94\n     Tr. at 236; EGS Ex. 10, Ervin Rebuttal Testimony at 52.\n95\n     HLFCCG m at 6 (referring to General Counsel Ex. 16 at 2, and Ex. 17 at 2).\n96\n     Tr. at 249-50.\n97\n     General Counsel IB at 14 (referring to HLFCCG Ex. 13, Entergy Internal Audit and Risk Assessment).\n98\n     HLFCCG Ex. 1, Patton Direct Testimony, Risk Assessment Attachment at 3-4, 6.\n99\n     Cities Ex. 1, Lawton Direct Testimony at 12; Tr. at 164.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                       Page22\n\n\n            The Commission concludes that, post-merger, EGS cut many experienced\nemployees, some of whom were consequently replaced by contract workers.                            The\nCommission, however, will not prescribe what personnel levels the Company should\nmaintain. It is up to EGS to make sure it has enough workers to carry out proper\nmaintenance and necessary emergency responses, along with having well-defined\nperformance measures for both regular and contract employees.\n\n\n            b. Management Practices\n            Because the various operational entities under the holding company are split both\nalong functional and geographic lines, tracing management structure poses some\ndifficulties. According to Company witness Johnny Ervin, a network manager is located\nin Beaumont, along with a reliability supervisor. 100 There are two levels of customer\nserVice managers located in Beaumont; the vice president of customer service is located\nin Jackson, Mississippi. During the hearing, however, the Company presented its director\nof performance measurement, located in Little Rock, Arkansas, to speak on customer\nservice issues. The network manager and reliability supervisor report to a franchise\ndirector (in Beaumont) and reliability director (in New Orleans, Louisiana), respectively.\nBoth of these directors report to a senior vice president of distribution operations, who is\nlocated in New Orleans and is actually employed by Entergy Services, Inc. The senior\nvice president answers to a utility group president, who has above him the chief operating\nofficer and, fmally, the chief executive officer of Entergy. According to Mr. Ervin, this\nreflects a new and \"flatter\" organizational structure, designed to promote better\ncommunication. 101 None of the managers in Beaumont reports to the EGS president, who\nhas offices in Beaumont and Austin, Texas.\n\n\n\n\n100\n     Tr. at 789-794; the entire description of the management structure is taken from these pages of the\ntranscript.\n\n101   !d.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                    Page23\n\n\n           The Commission has concerns regarding the Company's management structure.\nIt is not clear from the evidence that managers actually have the authority and matching\nresources to supervise their specific areas. 102 Those responsible for system reliability\nhave little control over the vegetation management area, even though vegetation\nmanagement has a major impact on how well the T&D system functions.                             The\nCompany's internal audit concluded that there was no overall strategic plan in place to set\nperformance strategies, and that hindered management in accomplishing business\nobjectives and goals. 103 While EGS' representatives explained that recent changes in\nmanagement structure were aimed at increasing communication, they also revealed that\nthere was no structured way for the management to track and resolve problems reported\n                       104\nby the employees.      In addition, managers' bonuses are tied in part to cost-cutting which\nmay confl1ct                   ·\n         .

The managers in the\nTexas territory must have clearly delineated powers and should be accountable to a\nunified higher management. The current, bifurcated management structure, under which\nlocal Texas supervisors report to multiple supervisors, is an obstacle to effective and\nreliable operation ofEGS' Texas system .\n\n\n          .c. Spending Levels\n           An issue addressed at length in this docket involved the Company's record of\ninvestment in the T &D system, particularly in maintenance. While there is hardly a\n\n\n\n102\n      Tr. at 791-92.\n103\n      ID..FCCG Ex.

Also, EGS internal risk assessment studies for vegetation\nmanagement and distribution maintenance list cost-cutting as a major business goal.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                       Page24\n\n\nsubstitute for sufficient O&M expenditures, the Commission will not prescribe a specific\nlevel of spending that may guarantee adequate service quality, and, at present, is not\nkeenly interested in past expenditure levels. The Commission is primarily interested in\nresults. As noted in the March 7, 1997 Supplemental Preliminary Order in Docket No.\n16705, the Commission recognizes \"that there may be a point of diminishing returns\nabove which the dollars or resources allocated to service quality become unreasonable\n                                    106\nand fail to be cost effective.\"           That crossover point is not set in this docket, and it is not\nintended to be set. EGS is responsible for determining sufficient spending levels and for\nthe appropriate allocation of resources to O&M, distribution capital additions, and other\ncategories in order to meet its obligation to provide adequate service quality.\n\n\n           In the hearing, EGS witnesses maintained that the Company had increased T&D\nspending since the 1993 merger; that inspection and measurement standards had\nimproved; and that its spending on service quality programs equaled or even exceeded\nthat of other utilities. 107 It is not certain, however, that EGS actually increased spending\nbecause expenses were not categorized clearly. Increased spending, if any, shows just\nthat--increased spending; it does not measure how the quality of service has improved, or\nwhether the service is adequate in accordance with PURA. Nonetheless, EGS is required\nto provide continuous and adequate service in accordance with traditional reasonable and\nnecessary cost standards. 108\n\n\n           In a memo dated October 31, 1995, a Company official discusses vegetation\nmaintenance spending in the Southern Region and points to a recently implemented 20\npercent reduction in allocations which, he expresses, cannot be sustained by any region\n\n\n\n\n106\n      Supplemental Preliminary Order at 2, Docket No. 16705 (Mar. 7, 1997).\n107\n      Tr. at 760; EGS IB at 7-10.\n108\n   The Commission would expect some increases in spending since the 1993 merger because GSU, facing\nbankruptcy, would have presumably reduced even the necessary expenses.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                    Page25\n\n\nwithout an adverse effect on customer service. 109 The parties generally agreed that\nspending on O&M decreased, while distribution capital additions slightly increased. 110\nThe Internal Audit department of the Company in its distribution risk assessment study\nidentified the budget process which allocated dollars to the regions based on past history\nrather than system needs as one of the problems that needed to be resolved. 111\n\n            After evaluating the record evidence, the Commission concludes that expenditure\nlevels for O&M are confusing and unclear, and pose a problem regarding tracking and\naccountability. While the Commission declines to state specific amounts to be spent,\nproper tracking and accounting of expenditures, both by type and jurisdiction, are\nessential. For example, the Company was unable to explain a 50 percent increase in the\n                                                                                           112\nmiscellaneous Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Account 588.                           It is\nvirtually impossible to ascertain how much of the O&M budget is actually spent in the\nTexas jurisdiction or for distribution capital additions as compared to system\nmaintenance.\n\n\n            The Commission concludes that expenditures for O&M must be readily available\nand verifiable. The same applies to the oft-mentioned, but never specified or quantified,\n\"increased efficiencies\" used to justify cutting costs. 113 For such claims to have any\nweight, the Company must have a ready and reasonable explanation together with\nsupporting documentation.\n\n\n\n\n109\n      General Counsel Ex. 28 at 2.\n110\n   Tr. at 134, 248; 353-54; General Counsel Ex. 1, Ethridge Direct Testimony at 20, 27; Cities Ex. 1,\nLawton Direct Testimony at 8.\n111\n      General Counsel Ex. 30 at 7.\n112\n      Jd. at 9; Tr. at 153-54.\n113\n      EGS Ex. 8, Ervin Supplemental Direct at 16, 19-20.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                      Page 26\n\n5. Pockets of Unreliability; Customer Service\n\n\n            a. Pockets ofUnreliability\n            One of the issues identified in the Supplemental Preliminary Order in Docket No.\n16705 involves pockets of particularly unreliable service, 114 such as the feeder Tamina,\nwhich had 41.3 hours of outage time in one year. 115 Rural customers are more likely to\nexperience outages and wait longer for restoration. The Company admits to areas of\nlower reliability 116 and agrees that \"outliers\" must be improved. 117              The Company's\npractice--seemingly logical--of first restoring and clearing areas with most customers has\nled to the same customers experiencing repeated lower-quality service. In addition, the\nCompany maintains a list of \"politically sensitive\" accounts, which suggests that some\ncustomers may receive preferential treatment. 118\n\n\n           The Commission concludes that there should be a high standard of service for all\ncustomers, including a set minimum standard below which no customer would fall, and\nthat the Company needs to bring all of its worst performing poles and feeders into\ncompliance with that minimum standard.\n\n\n           b. Customer Service\n           The Company has maintained, from the outset of this case, that its service is not\ndeficient, but that it simply faces a \"customer perception\" problem. The Company knows\nthat it has a large number of customers who are not satisfied with their electric service. 119\n\n114\n    Supplemental Preliminary Order at 3, Docket No. 16705 (March 7, 1997); see also, General Counsel\nEx. 7 at36.\n115\n      General Counsel Ex. 3, EckhoffDirect Testimony, Appendix H.\n116\n      Tr.at122,223,652.\n117\n      Tr. at 223-24.\n118\n      Tr. at 396-97.\n119\n   Tr. at 219.

The same concerns were reflected in the testimony of city officials chatged\nwith protecting the health and safety of their citizens. Of particular note was the evidence\nthat a municipality was compelled to call upon its volunteer firefighters to disconnect live\nelectric wires because the Company's personnel were not available to perform this highly\ndangerous task. 120\n\n\n            The Company's inadequate service quality is not necessarily an outgrowth of a\nlack of \"money\" or \"expenditures.\" The Company has available funds that should be\nsufficient to provide higher-quality service, as may be gathered from the fact that the\nentire O&M budget was not spent. 121 It should be noted that the internal risk assessment\nstudy on distribution line construction and service restoration lists as the first priority\nimprovement in customer perception of energy delivery and improvement in reliability\nonly as a secop.d priority. 122\n\n\n           EGS' customers and the Commission believe that the Company has an obligation\nto provide continuous and adequate service, and that significant improvements in EGS'\nperformance are needed. Section D, below, outlines the outcomes EGS must attain for\nthe Commission to be satisfied that those improvements have been made.                  An\nimprovement in EGS performance will eventually lead to more favorable perceptions and\nevaluations by the Company's customers.\n\n\n\n\n120\n      Tr. at 376.\n121\n      Tr. at 468-70.\n122\n      General Counsel Ex. 30 at 1.\n\f PUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                      Page28\n\nD. Remedies\n\n\n         Based on the foregoing analysis, the Commission concludes that the Company's\nservice quality must be improved. The following incentive plan lays out remedies to help\nEGS achieve such improvements. The five essential components of the plan are as\nfollows:\n\n      1. A reduction in the return on equity divided into two parts: an adjustment\n         component that recognizes EGS' current service quality is not adequate, with\n         amounts to be refunded to customers, and            an\n                                                        incentive-pool component to\n         encourage future improvements in service quality;\n      2. Adoption of minimum and target levels for SAIDI and SAIFI as\n         recommended in General Counsel's testimony, including improvement in the\n         worst- feeder performance; establishment of standards for major-storm data;\n         and reporting requirements;\n      3. Partial adoption of customer service performance benchmarks as\n         recommended in General Counsel's testimony;\n      4. Establishment of a quality assurance requirement to ensure improved\n         performance through the hiring of an independent consultant consistent with\n         the amended, non-unanimous stipulation; and, to guarantee the accuracy of\n         all data, hiring by the Company of an independent auditor to review all\n         reports. 123\n      5. A customer information and notification requirement.\n\n\n1. Reduction in the Return on Equity and Incentive Pool\n\n\n        Drawing from the recommendation in the testimony of Cities' witness Lawton,\nthe Company will be assessed a 60-basis point reduction in its ROE adopted in Phase II\nof Docket No. 16705.           This reduction shall be implemented in recognition of the\nhistorically inadequate performance of EGS' distribution system. The Company will be\nrequired to refund current overcollections, including all appropriate taxes, for the period\n\n\n\n123\n    EGS had filed an amended, non-unanimous stipulation regarding the hiring of an independent\nconsultant to assess Company's distribution system, including a review of the service quality processes.\nThe Commission approved the stipulation with modifications on January 15, 1998.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                        Page 29\n\n\nstarting with June 1, 1996, the effective date of any rate reductions ordered in Docket No.\n16705, up to the effective date of this order. 124\n\n\n\n         Going forward, the Company will collect the amount equal to one-half of the 60-\nbasis point reduction, plus appropriate taxes, and deposit that amount in an interest-\nbearing escrow account to create an incentive pool.                 The Company may earn this\nescrowed amount back by achieving specific performance targets. The other one-half of\nthe 60-basis point reduction, plus appropriate taxes, will be retained by the ratepayers.\nThe performance evaluation year will be a 12-month period, commencing on November\n1, and ending on October 31. For SAIDI and SAIFI minimum level compliance, SAIDI\nand SAIFI target level compliance, and compliance with the billing-error rate and call\ncenter performance targets, the initial evaluation period shall commence on November 1,\n1997, and end on October 31, 1998. For service installation, line extension, and light\nreplacement customer service performance measures, the initial evaluation period shall\ncommence on May 1, 1998, and end on October 31, 1998. Thus, EGS' performance\nduring the initial measurement year for these three performance measures shall be based\non only six months of customer service performance. During subsequent years, EGS'\nperformance shall be based on twelve months of customer service performance. At the\nend of each performance evaluation period, if the Company fails to achieve stated\nperformance benchmarks in any of the three areas (SAIDI and SAIFI minimum levels,\nSAIDI and SAIFI target levels, and customer service), a corresponding portion of the\nincentive pool will be refunded to distribution-level customers, divided on a pro-rata\nbasis within each customer class, except as noted below. If the Company successfully\nreaches all of the benchmarks, the full amount of the incentive pool will revert back to\nEGS.\n\n\n\n\n124\n    The effective date of this order for the purposes of the requirements set forth herein is the date on\nwhich this Order is no longer subject to rehearing.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                              Page30\n\n\n        The performance evaluation year is intended to coincide with the filing\nrequirements of the Commission's Electric System Service Quality Report (ESSQR)\nforms. If the Commission were to change the ESSQR form time periods to a calendar-\nyear basis, the performance evaluation periods discussed above for EGS shall change to\nbe consistent with the Report form periods.\n\n\n        Performance will be evaluated, and the incentive pool will be divided, according\nto three measures: (1) improvement in the minimum performance levels for SAIDI and\nSAIFI for worst feeders; (2) improvement in the target performance levels for SAIDI and\nSAIFI for average feeders; and (3) improvement in customer service performance, which\nhas five components: (a) billing-error rate, (b) connection rate at the call center, (c)\ntimeliness in completing service and meter installations, (d) timeliness in completing line\nextensions, and (e) timeliness in replacing and/or repairing service and street lights.\n\n\n       For the purposes of determining what amount, if any, the Company will earn\nback, the portions of the incentive pool will be represented by the following benchmarks:\nSAIDI and SAIFI minimum value improvements for the \"worst\" feeders (described\nbelow) will count as one-third of the pool; SAIDI and SAIFI target value improvements\nwill count as one-third of the pool; and customer service improvements will count as one-\nthird. Failure to achieve a measure will result in refunds to the affected customers based\non the requirements for that specific measure. SAIDI and SAIFI will be calculated on a\nfeeder-specific basis.\n\n\n       The Company has stated it does not have the ability to measure customer-specific\nfeeder performance, and thus cannot calculate customer-specific refunds. For the first\nmeasure, however, refunds shall be provided to all customers taking service from a feeder\nthat fails to meet the SAIDI and SAIFI minimum acceptable levels as recorded over a\none-year period. These refunds are more customer-specific than currently contemplated\nby the Company, but because only a small number of feeders is expected to fall into this\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                            Page 31\n\n\ncategory, the refund calculations should not pose an insurmountable problem. 125 For the\nsecond measure, if the Company fails to achieve the specified SAID I and SAIFI target\nlevel improvements, refunds shall be made to all Texas, distribution-level customers. For\nthe third measure, failure to meet the standard for any of the customer service\ncomponents will result in pro-rata refunds to each of the distribution-level customers.\nDistribution-level customers are meant to be those Texas, retail residential and small\ncommercial ratepayers whose contract demands are less than or equal to 100 k W.\n\n\n            Feeder-specific refunds shall be distributed in a single billing period in proportion\nto and limited by each customer's total annual electric usage (i.e., no customer shall\nreceive a refund greater than the total amount paid by that customer for the service in that\nyear). If any money remains in the pool, the amount shall be refunded to all distribution-\nlevel customers on a pro-rata basis.              All refunds shall be labeled \"Service Quality\nRefund\" on the customer's bill and shall be directed to the current customer receiving .\nservice at a given premise.\n\n2. Minimum and Target Performance Levels\n\n\n            a. Frequency and Duration of Interruptions\n\n            The performance benchmarks are drawn from General Counsel's testimony with\nsome adjustments. General Counsel proposed that the Company measure the duration of\ninterruptions using the Average System Availability Index (ASAI). The ASAI index and\nthe SAIDI index are closely related. Since the Company is required to report SAIDI\nunder the Commission's service quality rules, that index will be used as the duration\nmeasure. General Counsel, HLFCCG, and Cities agree that performance should be\nmeasured feeder-by-feeder rather than through a system average. EGS has accepted a\nfeeder-by-feeder approach for outage frequency. 126                 General Counsel's proposal for\n\n125\n    The Company states that it does not have the ability to tie specific feeders to specific customers; it is\nexpected, however, that the number of feeders involved is such that manual calculations will be possible or\nthe Company can use its TACTICS program.

The\nCommission adopts the following performance targets for use by EGS as its reliability\nperformance standards.\n\n\nTable 1: General Counsel's Proposal for Interruption Performance Measures\n\nIndex Value                          Minimum Acceptable Value                Target Value\n                                                 (annual)                      (annual)\nSAIFI                                        3 .8 interruptions             2.6 interruptions\nSAIDI                                    315 minutes (5.25 hours)       158 minutes (2.63 hours)\nSource: Eckhoff Direct Testimony at 7.\n\n\n\n         General Counsel's testimony indicates that distribution feeders serving\napproximately 90 percent of EGS' Texas customer meters met the minimum acceptable\nvalues for SAIDI and SAIFI in 1996. 128 Distribution feeders serving approximately 75\n                                                                                129\npercent ofEGS' Texas customer meters met the target values in 1996.\n\n\n         b. Minimum Performance Benchmark\n         General Counsel presented testimony to show that a certain percentage of EGS'\nfeeders fall below the minimum acceptable values for SAIDI and SAIFI. As part of the\nremedial plan, the Company must achieve 95 percent compliance with the minimum\nacceptable values in 1998, so that no more than 5 percent of distribution feeders serving\nEGS' Texas customer fail to meet the minimum acceptable values for SAID! and SAIFI.\n\n\n\n\n127\n   General Counsel Ex. 3, Eckhoff Direct Testimony at 7. HLFCCG recommends an annual feeder-by-\nfeeder standard for SAIFI of 3 interruptions and for SAID I of 200 minutes. HLFCCG Ex. 1, Patton Direct\nTestimony at 29.\n128\n    General Counsel reported that feeders serving 89.97 percent ~f EGS' Texas customer meters met the\nSAIFI minimum value, and 90.84 percent met the ASAI minimum value. General Counsel Ex. 3, Eckhoff\nDirect Testimony at 33-34.\n129\n    General Counsel reported that feeders serving 75.6 percent of EGS' Texas customers met the SAIFI\ntarget value, and 76.86 percent met the ASAI target value. Id\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                            Page 33\n\n\nFor the following year, the compliance level will be raised to 98.5 percent. In addition, in\nyear 2 and thereafter, EGS must also meet the following conditions: (1) two or more\nfeeders served by the same substation may not fail to attain any minimum acceptable\nvalue; (2) no feeder may fail to attain the minimum acceptable value for two or more\nconsecutive years; and (3) 98.5 percent of all meters must receive service at a level\nmeeting or exceeding both minimum acceptable values. Feeders with 5 or fewer meters\nshall not be considered in determining whether EGS has met these compliance standards.\nThe Company will maintain or exceed the 98.5 percent compliance with these standards\nin the subsequent years.\n\n\n       To document and track this improvement, the Company shall identify the worst-\nperforming feeders as discussed herein. EGS shall file SAIDI and SAIFI performance\ndata for all feeders in the following way: (1) exclusive of storm effects and using the\nSAIDI and SAIFI definitions of major events as contained in the Commission's Electric\nSystem Service Quality Report filing (PUC Project No. 15013), and (2) inclusive of all\nsuch storm effects and defining major weather events as an ice accumulation of at least\none inch of ice within the period of 24 hours, or winds greater than 80 miles-per-hour.\nFurther, EGS shall rank all of its 431 Texas distribution feeders from best to worst\naccording to SAIFI numbers calculated as described above. A list of the worst I 0 percent\nshall be submitted as a part of the June 15, 1998 ESSQR filing. Because the report asks\nfor data on the worst 5 percent of the feeders, the Company shall supplement its filing for\nthe purposes of this docket. If the Company fails to meet the minimum acceptable value\nbenchmark or the major-storm restoration measure for that year, as described below, one-\nthird of the incentive pool amount, plus appropriate taxes, will be refunded to customers\nserved by all non-complying feeders.\n\n\n       c. Target Performance Benchmark\n       In 1998, for all feeders, the Company must achieve 85 percent compliance with\nGeneral Counsel's recommended target levels for SAIDI and SAIFI to retain the\ncorresponding portion of the incentive pool (i.e., the Company must improve up to the\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                               Page34\n\n\ntarget levels an additional 10 percent of its feeders, from 75 to 85 percent). In the\nfollowing year, SAIDI and SAIFI compliance with the target levels will be raised to 90\npercent of feeders, and this level will be maintained or exceeded in the future. If the\nCompany fails to meet the target performance benchmark, one-third of the incentive pool,\nplus appropriate taxes, will be refunded to all Texas distribution-level customers.\n\n\n       d. Treatment of Major-Storm Data\n       The record shows that extreme weather events can cause major outages. For the\npurposes of record-keeping and performance evaluation, it is necessary to define extreme\nevents according to actual weather conditions rather than the effect weather has on the\nT&D system. For the purposes of its supplemental filing, EGS shall define extreme\nweather as an ice accumulation of at least one inch of ice within the period of24 hours, or\nwinds greater than 80 miles-per-hour. The Company shall keep its records in a way that\nincludes all weather events, and a separate set that includes only the major-weather\nevents. The determination of the Company's performance regarding SAIDI and SAIFI\nbenchmarks shall be calculated based on the all-inclusive data.             In addition, the\nCommission adopts as the performance measure for major-weather events the complete\nrestoration of all customers' electric service no later than 120 hours after the initiation of\nsuch an event (i.e., when an accumulation of one inch of ice or 80 mph wind have been\nrecorded). Failure to achieve this measure will preclude the Company's recovery of the\none-third of the incentive pool, plus appropriate taxes, associated with the SAID! and\nSAIFI minimum acceptable level compliance for that year.\n\n\n       If an extreme-weather event occurs on the system, and the Company believes it\nhas a detrimental effect on the overall performance for that year, the Company may\nsubmit a good cause exception filing for the Commission's consideration on whether to\ninclude such an event in the annual evaluation of compliance with set benchmarks.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page35\n\n\n          e. Reporting Requirements\n          As discussed above, the Company shall file collected data regarding performance\nmeasures on a semi-annual basis, which filings shall coincide with the filing dates of the\nCommission's ESSQR form.          In addition to that filing, on March 1 of each year\nbeginning in 1999, the Company shall file a proposed reconciliation statement showing\nthe level of achievement with the established benchmarks to qualify for any part of the\nincentive pool. The filing shall be audited by an independent auditor prior to filing, and\nthe auditor's report shall be filed with the proposed reconciliation statement. If and when\nthe Commission approves the filing, the Company shall retain the appropriate portion of\nthe pool or refund the corresponding portion, plus appropriate taxes, to its Texas\ndistribution-level customers, as directed by the Commission.           SAID! and SAIFI\nperformance data shall be reported according to the following schedule: May through\nOctober data due on December 15; November through April data due on June 15 of each\nyear.\n\n3. Customer Service Performance Benchmarks\n\n\n          The performance measures listed below in Table 2 are drawn from General\nCounsel's recommendations, with the exception of security and street light replacement,\nwhich is based on a recommendation made by the Company . 130 In its reply brief, EGS\nadopted many of the components of General Counsel's recommended performance\nmeasures for customer service. 131 For the purposes of this remedial plan, each customer\nservice measure will be computed for the time interval noted in Table 2, and reported to\nthe Commission every six months, consistent with the filing dates for the service quality\nreports, as a separate Customer Service Report. If all five targets are achieved by EGS in\none given year, the customer service portion of the incentive pool will be retained by the\n\n\n\n130\n     General Counsel Ex. 7, Goodman Direct Testimony; General Counsel Ex. 5, Burrows Direct\nTestimony, Attachment JBG-8.\n131\n      EGS Reply Brief at 17-21.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                                 Page36\n\nCompany for that year; otherwise, that portion of the incentive pool, plus appropriate\ntaxes, will be refunded to distribution-level customers on a pro-rata basis.\n\n\nTable 2: Performance Targets for Customer Service Measures\nCustomer               Performance Target\nService Measure\nBilling-error rate    The Texas system average monthly rate of actual customer over-billing errors per\n                       1000 customers shall not exceed five.\nCall center           Seven days a week, 24 hours per day, on a monthly basis, in every EGS call\nperformance           center, 85 percent of the time, calls shall be answered within 30 seconds.\nService               In any distribution substation service area, 90 percent of applications for new\ninstallation          electric service and meters not involving line extensions or new facilities shall be\n                      filled within five working days, excluding those orders in which a later date is\n                      specifically requested by the customer. Service installation compliance will be\n                      measured on a quarterly basis.\nLine extensions       In any distribution substation service area, 85 percent of requests for line\n                      extensions or new facilities shall be completed within 60 working days, excluding\n                      those orders in which a later date is specifically requested by the customer.

No earlier\nthan April 1, 1999, any party may petition the Commission to revise these three customer\nservice measures and targets.            In its December filing each year, EGS shall, for the\npurposes of this docket, provide an annual, audited summary of customer service\nperformance data.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                           Page37\n\n\n4. Quality Assurance Proposal; Independent Consultant; and Independent Auditor\n\n\n         According to the terms of the amended, non-unanimous stipulation, the Company\nshall hire an independent consultant to assess the distribution system, develop strategies\nfor improvement, revise data collection practices, and set up evaluation criteria\n                                                                                          132\nprocedures spelled out in the order approving that stipulation as modified.

Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n\n       The preceding discussion explains the Commission's factual and legal\nconclusions with regard to the issues presented in this docket. In accordance with TEx.\nGov'T CoDE ANN. § 2001.141, the Commission separately states the following findings\nof fact and conclusions of law.\n\nA. Findings of Fact\n\nProcedural History\n\n1.     On November 27, 1996, EGS filed with the Commission its transition/rate case in\nDocket No. 16705.\n\n2.      The Commission referred the case to SOAH on December 5, 1996. The\npreliminary order issued by the Commission on January 24, 1997, in Docket No. 16705\ndirected that the docket \"address specific service quality standards that will apply after\nthe transition [proposed by EGS].\"\n\n3.      On March 7, 1997, the Commission issued a supplemental preliminary order in\nDocket No. 16705 that focused specifically on service quality issues. That order\ndelineated three questions which must be addressed: (1) Whether EGS has an effective\nand prudent management policy in place that devotes sufficient resources to ensure\nadequate and reliable service to its ratepayers; (2) Whether there appear patterns of\nvariable service quality in EGS' service territory, and if so, what is the cause and\npotential resolution of these variations; (3) Whether the Commission should implement\nprocedures, and if so, what procedures can it implement, to monitor service quality on\nEGS' system, and to respond to situations in which EGS' service quality falls below the\nbenchmark levels.\n\n4.     SOAH segmented the hearings in Docket No. 16705 (SOAH Docket No. 473-96-\n2285) into four phases to address numerous transition and rate issues separately. The\nservice quality issues were scheduled for hearing in early November 1997, in the\n\"Competitive Issues\" phase of the case.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page39\n\n\n5.     At the November 4, 1997 Open Meeting, Chairman Pat Wood, III, and\nCommissioner Judy Walsh voted to sever the service quality issues from Docket No.\n16705 and determined that the Commission itselfwould hear and resolve these issues.\n\n6.     An order issued on November 4, 1997, established Docket No. 18249 to address\nthe service quality issues. The order also established procedures by which the\nCommission would hear and rule on the service quality issues directly.\n\n7.      Chairman Wood and Commissioner Walsh convened and presided over a public\nhearing on the merits on November 20 and 21, 1997, to address EGS' service quality\nissues. EGS, Cities, HLFCCG, and General Counsel submitted their testimony and\nexhibits into evidence and conducted cross-examination.       The Chairman and\nCommissioner Walsh also directed questions to the witnesses.\n\n8.     EGS, Cities, HLFCCG, and General Counsel filed post-hearing briefs in this\ndocket on December 2, 1997. Reply briefs were filed by these same parties on December\n9, 1997. The Office of Public Utility Counsel and the Attorney General's Office filed\nstatements on December 2 and 9, 1997, respectively, supporting the briefs of the Cities\nandHLFCCG.\n\n9.       The Commission issued its Final Order in this docket on February 13, 1998.\n\n10.      On March 5, 1998, General Counsel and EGS filed motions for rehearing.\n\n11.    At the March 19, 1998 open meeting, the Commission granted extensions to rule\non the motions for rehearing until May 14, 1998, and to file replies until March 25, 1998.\n\n12.    On March 25, 1998, a joint reply to motions for rehearing and motion for entry of\norder consistent with the parties' stipulation and agreement (the Stipulation) was filed\nand signed by General Counsel, EGS, HLFCCG, and OPUC.\n\n13.    The Commission granted rehearing at the April 1, 1998 open meeting and also\napproved the Stipulation.\n\nNotice\n\n14.    Hearings held on November 20 and 21, 1997, were properly noticed in accordance\nwith TEX. Gov'T CODE ANN.§§ 551.041, 551.043,2001.051, and 2001.052.\n\n15.    This matter was scheduled for discussion in open meetings convened on\nDecember 17, 1997, January 14, 1998, and April 1, 1998, for which notice ~as given\npursuant to TEx. Gov'TCODEANN. §§ 551.041 and 551.043.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                         Page40\n\n\n\n\n16.    EGS is a public utility subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission in\naccordance with PURA §§ 14.001, 31.001, 32.001, 33.122, and 36.001 through 36.156.\n\n17.    EGS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy, a holding company incorporated in\nDelaware and registered with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission in\naccordance with the Public Utility Holding Company Act.\n\n18.  Entergy acquired Gulf States Utilities, Inc., to create EGS, effective as of\nDecember 31, 1993.\n\n19.      EGS operates in Louisiana and Texas, and through its parent holding company is\naffiliated with investor-owned electric utilities located in Louisiana, Mississippi, and\nArkansas. Entergy's headquarters is located in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n20.    EGS' Texas service territory covers the southeastern part of the state. EGS'\nprincipal office in Texas is located in Beaumont.\n\nManagement Structure\n\n21.    In Beaumont, EGS employs, among others, a network manager and a reliability\nsupervisor. These managers report to a franchise director, also located in Beaumont.\n\n22.   The network manager's and reliability supervisor's responsibilities include\nmanaging and dealing with system reliability, outages, restoration, and vegetation\nmanagement.\n\n23.     The network managers report to the franchise director located in Beaumont, who\nreports to the senior vice president of distribution operations, employed by Entergy\nServices, Inc., and located in New Orleans.\n\n24.    In New Orleans, the vice president of distribution operations answers to a utility\ngroup president, who reports to a chief operating officer, and ultimately the chief\noperating officer of Entergy.\n\n25.     The network manager, reliability supervisor, and franchise director do not report\nto the EGS president, who has offices both in Austin and Beaumont.\n\n26.     The Company management structure is ill-suited to assure best supervision of the\nT&D system in the Texas territory. The supervisors in Texas answer to multiple directors\nin Louisiana, do not have all the necessary resources at their disposal, and their bonus\nincentives are tied in part to successful cost-cutting.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page 41\n\n\nTransmission System\n\n27. · The construction of EGS' transmission system started in 1924. Half of the\ntransmission lines currently in service were added in the 1950's and 1960's. Since 1977,\n12 percent of the lines have been newly built or rehabilitated.\n\n28.    The Commission finds that the physical state of EGS' transmission system is\nadequate; few transmission-related outages or circuit breaker operations occurred.\n\n29.    Transmission line ROW appear to be clear.\n\n30.     The EGS transmission system appears to provide adequate, continuous, and\nreliable service.\n\nPhysical Condition of Distribution System and Pole Inspection Program\n\n31.    EGS serves approximately 318,279 customers in Texas. The distribution system\nin the state is comprised of 11,472 miles of electric lines; 394,865 poles; and\napproximately 431 feeders.\n\n32.  EGS contracted with Osmose Wood Preserving Company to perform inspections\nofEGS poles and crossarms in Texas for the years 1995 and 1996.\n\n33.     In 1995 and 1996, Osmose field inspectors inspected a total of37,233 wood poles\nin eight different areas. The poles reviewed account for 9.4 percent of the total number of\npoles in EGS' Texas system.\n\n34.     Although the Osmose inspections focused on particularly troubled spots of the\ndistribution system in Texas, certain areas revealed a number of deficient poles that was\nexcessive by any measure.\n\n35.    Osmose survey results show wide fluctuations in percentages of poles with decay,\nfrom 8 to 37 percent, with the average percentage being 17.9 percent.\n\n36.     EGS proposes to implement a new pole inspection program, through which\napproximately 35,000 poles will be inspected annually, so that all poles in the Texas\njurisdiction will be inspected by the end ofthe lOth year.\n\n37.    General Counsel selected Drash Consulting Engineering Inc. to survey 33\nuniformly distributed substations from the Texas portion of the EGS distribution system.\n\n38.     General Counsel recommended that Drash inspect a representative sample of 591\npoles on feeders originating from these 33 substations, of which Drash visually surveyed\n582, or 98.42 percent, of poles.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                         Page 42\n\n\n39.     The Drash report picked for inspection approximately every 5th, lOth, or 15th\npole from the substation. The age of the poles was determined by visual inspection.\n\n40.    Drash filed its report on August 11, 1997, in which it identified 59 of 582 poles\nwith structural deficiencies, such as rot,· decay, or leaning, and 72 poles with\nencroachments by tree limbs and vegetation build-up.\n\n41.     The Drash survey did not use specific criteria by which to evaluate the condition\nof the poles, but relied on the inspectors' experience.\n\n42.     Beginning on May 12, 1997, the Commission Staff performed limited, random\ninspections of EGS' poles in the Vidor, Orange, Bridge City, Port Arthur, and Port\nNeches areas. The Staff inspections also encompassed the northern portion of the system\nto the western limits of EGS' service area.\n\n43.    By August 1997, the Commission Staff surveyed 60 poles, and found that 6.7\npercent had equipment deficiencies and 63 percent had ROW problems.\n\n44.     In general, the distribution system is in adequate condition; however, there are\nnumerous poles with decay, in need of repair or replacement, and many lines and poles\nthat need vegetation clearing.\n\n45.    The inspection program carried out by the Company has not been sufficiently\nextensive or adequate to fulfill its purpose of securing reliable service.\n\n46.    The Company's distribution system maintenance practices have failed to assure\ncontinuous and adequate service to EGS' customers.\n\nReliability Indices and Performance Standards\n\n47.     EGS uses the following standards and systems to collect and record performance\nmeasures: System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI); System Average\nInterruption Duration Index (SAIDI); Distribution Interruption System (DIS); TACTICS;\nand a System Control and Data Acquisition devise (SCADA). General Counsel also used\nthe Average System Availability Index (ASAI) as an outage measure.\n\n48.  EGS begins to record a specific outage only after a customer calls in to the\nCompany to complain. Timing of the outage duration starts after the customer alerts the\nCompany.\n\n49.     System-wide, the average customer in EGS' Texas territory experienced outages\ntotaling 133 minutes (as recorded in SAIDI) in 1996. The system-wide SAIFI in Texas\nfor 1996 was 2.648 interruptions.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                           Page 43\n\n\n50.     Fifty of 431 feeders (11.6 percent) in the EGS' Texas system were below the\nminimum ASAI standard recommended by General Counsel (99.94 percent or 157\nminutes), while 37 (8.58 percent) feeders missed the minimum SAIFI standard of 3.8\ninterruptions per year.\n\n51.    Eighty-three feeders or primary circuits experienced outage times in excess of 200\nminutes during 1996.\n                                                                                           134\n52.    Eighteen feeders, serving 9,457 meters, are \"historically deficient\" for SAIFI,\nand seventeen feeders, serving 10,835 meters, are \"historically deficient\" for ASAI.\n\n53.    Nine percent of the meters did not meet minimum ASAI standards. Similarly, 10\npercent of the meters fell below minimum SAIFI benchmarks.\n\n54.    Customers on several feeders suffered significantly more interruptions than the\naverage customer, and with lengthier outages: feeders Tamina and China recorded SAIDI\nscores of 2,477 minutes and 934 minutes, respectively, while feeder Dobbin reached a\nSAIDI value of 699 minutes. Feeder Pleasure scored 10.2 interruptions, feeder Crystal\nhad a SAIFI of 8 interruptions, and Cordrey scored 7.56 interruptions.\n\n55.     Sixty-five feeders with approximately 58,000 customers have a SAIFI rating less\nthan the 10-year Company average.\n\n56.   EGS testified that it restores first those feeders with the highest numbers of\ncustomers. Likewise, it clears vegetation first on the feeders with the most customers.\n\n57.    EGS excluded certain data in calculating its reliability indices. In 1994, the\nCompany ceased counting outages in areas with less than 500 customers. For the first six\nmonths of 1996, the Company reported 35 to 40 percent fewer outages than were reported\non average during the first six months ofthe 1991-94 time-frame.\n\n58.    The average outage duration during the first three years after the merger went up\nto 2.4105 hours, from the average of 1.8220 hours during the seven years preceding the\nmerger.\n\n59.    By September 1996, the number of outages reported increased by 80 percent from\n1995, due to a greater number of small outages recorded.\n\n60.    EGS prepared a Reliability Report for the Southwest Region, issued in May 1994,\nthat summarized reliability performance for the year, compared actual performance with\nCompany goals, identified problem areas, and reported corrective actions.\n\n\n134\n   Historically deficient feeders are those with consistently poor performance over a period of several\nyears.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page44\n\n\n61.    Equipment failures were excluded from the May 1994 Reliability Index, as were\noutages attributed to public damage, non-preventable trees, load curtailment, transmission\nline outages, instantaneous outages, and planned outages. EGS began reporting these\ntypes of outages again in September 1995.                         ·\n\n62.     EGS excluded from its performance measures and reliability indices data\ncollected during episodes of extreme weather conditions in February 1994 and January\n1997.\n63.     The measure of outage duration does not take into account either the number of\ncustomers who fail to alert the Company to an outage, or the length of time a customer\nhas suffered an outage prior to notifying the Company.\n\n64.     Linemen working for or on behalf of EGS make subjective determinations as to\nthe cause, duration, or effect of an outage, which may hinder true and accurate reporting\nof the outage causes.\n\n65.    EGS records and reports its reliability and performance data based on system-\nwide measures. This method of reporting overlooks recurring individual feeder problems\nand pockets of disproportionately low service quality.\n\n66.     EGS is not technically equipped at the present time to measure SAIDI and SAIFI\nperformances at the individual customer level. The Company, however is able to\ncalculate performance indices on a feeder-by-feeder basis.\n\n67.     The Company's data and compiled indices are unreliable because of changing\ndata collection standards, failure to report all relevant information, and manipulation of\nthe data.\n\nVegetation Management\n\n68.     The purpose of vegetation management is to ensure to the extent possible that\nvegetation in or near ROW does not come into contact with the conductors and either\nbreak the wires or cause ground faults.\n\n69.      Many of the outages in EGS' service territory result from trees or tree limbs\nfalling into EGS' ROWs or distribution lines.\n\n70.    EGS stated that it has a six-year, rural tree-trimming cycle; it calls for a 20-foot\nclearance. Trees in urban areas, according to the Company, are trimmed on a three-year\ncycle. The Company did not offer persuasive evidence that these cycles were actually\nfollowed.\n\n71.   The Company stated that 80 percent of EGS' vegetation management\nexpenditures are allocated to cyclical tree trimming.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page45\n\n\n72.    Texas vegetation management expenses in the post-merger period were $4.99\nmillion in 1994, $5.09 million in 1995, and $4.735 million in 1996. The decrease in\nspending between 1995 and 1996 is attributed by the Company to unexplained efficiency\ngains.\n\n73.    The total line-miles actively maintained by the Company dropped approximately\n30 percent in 1996 from the 1994-1995 levels; EGS witnesses did not explain this\ndecrease.\n\n74.     Vegetation management spending increased by 34 percent in 1997, a significant\npart of which went towards the January 1997 ice storm cleanup costs.\n\n75.    Vegetation-related SAIDI and SAIFI values have worsened since the merger.\nSystem-wide SAIDI values for Texas have increased from 21.17 in 1994 to 40.36 in\n1997. SAIFI values have also increased from 0.31 in 1994 to 0.63 in 1997. As·of\nSeptember 1997, the SAIDI level for 1997 exceeded the SAIDI value for the entire year\nin 1996.\n\n76.     Network managers in EGS' Texas territory have the responsibility to ensure\nadequate service reliability. Network managers, however, do not directly supervise or\nfully control the vegetation management program.\n\n77.    A 1994 study by Environmental Consultants, Inc., (ECI) proposed specific\nrecommendations for EGS' vegetation management to include herbicide and tree\ntrimming based on plant species, equipment scheduling in the planning process,\naggressive pursuit of tree removals, and performance measures for contractors. EGS has\nnot implemented the recommendations proposed by ECI.\n\n78.     Entergy's Internal Audit department conducted a comprehensive risk assessment\nstudy of the vegetation management program in 1996, and concluded that sufficient\nstrategic planning had not occurred to ensure that Entergy met its objectives. The study\nalso found that the Alliance Agreement between Entergy and vegetation management\ncontractors was not being consistently applied in the various regions, and did not meet\nbusiness objectives.\n\n79.   Power lines cannot be shielded 100 percent from all contact with vegetation;\nhowever, the Company's inability to develop and carry out prudent vegetation\nmanagement policies has resulted in major service disruptions.\n\n80.     EGS' management structure does not provide those responsible for ensuring\nservice reliability with direct authority to address or prevent vegetation-related outages.\n\n81.      The Company does not have a strategic plan to guide vegetation management\nefforts.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                          Page 46\n\n\n82.     Neglect and backlog of vegetation management projects has posed unacceptable\nrisks of increasing and recurrent service outages, especially during major storms.\n\n83.    The Commission finds that the Company's vegetation management efforts have\nnot been adequate, have led to a backlog in vegetation clearing, and have resulted in an\nunacceptably high risk to the system.\n\nEmergency Preparedness, Response, and Outage Restoration\n\n84.      In June 1996, EGS conducted a drill simulating an emergency situation in order to\ntest its emergency response and restoration plans.\n\n85.    EGS' emergency plan and procedures are on file with the Commission, and were\nreviewed by the Commission Staff after the ice storm in January 1997.\n\n86.    In Docket No. 16301, Ice Storm '97 Field Investigations Project, the Commission\nStaff concluded that EGS had a good emergency plan in place before the ice storm of\nJanuary 1997.\n\n87.     The Commission defines \"major storm\" as a weather-related event in which there\nis a loss of power to 10 percent or more of the customers in a region over a 24 hour\nperiod and with all customers not restored within 24 hours.\n\n88.   EGS defines major storm as any event in which 10 percent or more of a region's\ncustomers are interrupted for 24 hours or more.\n\n89.    Many parts of Texas experienced an ice storm of significant magnitude that began\nearly on January 12, 1997, and lasted through the afternoon of January 13, 1997.\n\n90.     Most utilities in Texas experienced disruptions in service during the January 1997\nice storm.\n\n91.    EGS should have been better prepared to deal with the January 1997 ice storm,\ngiven that it had experienced major weather events in 1994 and 1995, and that it had\nsuccessfully conducted emergency drills in 1996.\n\n92.   During the ice storm in January 1997, up to 120,000 of EGS' Texas customers\nwere without power. Restoration took seven days to complete, with temporary\nemergency crews mobilized from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas.\n\n93.     By January 16, 1997, EGS had more than 2,700 personnel deployed to restore\nservice on various parts of its Texas system.\n\n94.   At the public hearing on November 20, 1997, city officials from the towns of Port\nNeches, Orange, and Nederland described numerous episodes in which the numbers of\n\f PUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                          Page 47\n\n\n EGS workers, equipment, and materials were insufficient to deal adequately with\n emergency situations. Other officials from Cleveland, Dayton, and Port Arthur gave\n favorable reports ofEGS' performance during the January 1997 ice storm.\n\n 95.    Mr. Dick Nugent, representing the city of Nederland, testified that after several\n attempts to reach EGS personnel, city officials had to retrieve an EGS supervisor from his\n house in Nederland to help them with power restoration efforts.\n\n 96.    Mr. A.R. Kimler, from the city of Port Neches, testified that local firefighters\n were deployed to cut down live power lines because EGS stated there were not enough\n employees to respond at the time.\n\n 97.  The impact of the January 1997 ice storm was greatly exacerbated by the\n Company's failure to maintain its ROW clear of excessive vegetation.\n\n 98.     While the Company has emergency plans in place, not all personnel are familiar\n with the plans, a fact that may have accounted for the Company's uneven and delayed\n restoration efforts during the January 1997 ice storm.\n\n· 99.     It may be uneconomic for EGS to build, operate, or maintain a 100 percent storm-\n  proof system. The January 1997 ice storm, however, revealed that EGS must implement\n  a better preventive maintenance program and faster customer response initiatives.\n\n 100. Segregation of major-storm data from non-major storm data in outage duration\n and frequency reports provides a more accurate method to evaluate EGS' performance on\n a day-to-day basis, as well as during crisis events.\n\n101. The standard for classifying major storms is to be defined in terms ofthe severity\nof the weather-related event, rather than in terms of the impact on the T&D system.\nFeeders subject to major storms can be defined as those experiencing an accumulation of\none inch of ice or more within a 24-hour period, or those exposed to winds of at least 80\nmph.\n\n102. EGS' outage restoration efforts during the January 1997 ice storm would have\nbeen more effective if: (1) EGS had been more diligent in its preventive vegetation\nmanagement practices; and (2) it had a better communication and management program\nin place to deal with emergency situations.\n\n103. The effect and incidence of lightning strikes did not matet;ially affect the quality\nof service offered by the Company.\n\nSpending Levels\n\n104. System-wide transmission spending followed a generally increasing trend since\n1992. No data was presented for transmission O&M expenditures on the Texas portion\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page 48\n\nof the system.\n\n105. Between 1994 and 1996, distribution maintenance spending decreased by $4\nmillion each year. Half of these cuts ($2 million each year) came from the overhead line\nmaintenance spending.\n\n106. Miscellaneous distribution expenses recorded in Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission (FERC) Account 588 increased from just under $3 million in 1991-1993, to\n$10.3 million in 1995, and $12.4 million in 1996, an increase EGS could not explain.\n\n107. FERC has designated Account 588 for mapping, records, communications, and\nother miscellaneous expenses such as clerical, stenographic, and janitorial work at\nbuildings.\n\n108. EGS decreased its level of spending for pole and appurtenance replacements by\n50 percent during the years 1995 and 1996.\n\n109. EGS' O&M spending has been uneven, lacks clear accounting, and\nproportionately more is spent on distribution capital additions than on distribution system\nmaintenance.\n\n110. In 1995, most of the spending for distribution capital additions was in the\nLouisiana area.\n\n111. Efficiency savings have not been identified nor proven in areas where spending\nlevels had been reduced.\n\n112. The Company witness could not explain whether any of the savings from the\nunspent T&D budget were credited according to the Entergy/GSU merger agreement\n(PUC Docket No. 11292).\n\nPersonnel Levels\n\n113. The Company has carried out substantial cuts in the number of employees\nassigned to T&D operations: 95 distribution employees in 1995-1996 and 26 in 1997.\nEGS has increased its use of contract workers during the same periods for a total net\ndecrease of 42 permanent linemen and servicemen since the merger.\n\n114. Since the merger, most the terminated T&D employees were replaced with\ncontract workers. Sixty-six of the terminated T&D employees had on average of 18 years\nexperience with the Company.\n\n115. The Company has no performance measures to evaluate contract-worker\nefficiency.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                      Page 49\n\n116. The ratio of contract employees to permanent linemen and servicemen is now 2:1.\nThe Commission does not oppose the use of contract employees. The present ratio of\ncontract employees to permanent staff, however, is high, particularly in light of the\nextensive experience lost when many of the permanent employees were laid-off.\n\n11 7. EGS is expected to structure its line maintenance and vegetation management\nprograms in such a way that adequate numbers of properly trained and supervised\nemployees are promptly available.\n\n118. EGS hired 30 additional contract crews in October 1997, specifically to remedy a\nbacklog of vegetation management projects.\n\n119. The Company lacks a clearly stated strategic plan for vegetation management, and\npriorities are driven primarily by budget considerations.\n\nCustomer Service\n\n120. An EGS customer survey reveals that satisfaction results decreased among all\nclasses of ratepayers and for all components of service from 1995 to 1996, as more\ncustomers classified EGS service as \"fair\" or \"bad\" than \"very good\" or \"helpful.\"\n\n121: EGS did not track customer complaints prior to 1995, nor did it track customer\nservice performance standards. EGS began a complaint management system in January\n1997 to document every complaint called in to the Company.\n\n122. The Company's automated voice response unit, substituted for live employees,\nhas not led to increased customer satisfaction.\n\n123. EGS has failed to implement sufficient customer service procedures and has a\nhigh number of dissatisfied customers.\n\n124. The Company also has, by its own admission, pockets of particularly inadequate\nservtce.\n\n125. In a letter dated September 19, 1997, State Representative Mark Stiles wrote to\nthe Commission expressing concern over an increase in the number of EGS customers\nwho contacted him to complain of poor service by EGS.\n\n126. EGS acknowledges that it has a large number of customers who remain\nunsatisfied with their customer service.\n\n127. EGS' customer service quality is clearly deficient based on the numerous\ncomplaints to the Commission and Texas Legislature, and as indicated in the Company's\nown survey data.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                            Page 50\n\n\nStipulation\n\n128. In the Stipulation, filed by parties on March 25, 1998, and approved by the\nCommission at the April 1, 1998 open meeting, the parties, among other provisions,\nagreed to: (1) lower the compliance level for SAIDI and SAIFI minimum acceptable level\nto 98.5 percent; (2) make the reporting and evaluation periods consistent with the Electric\nSystem Service Quality Report form; (3) provide for a possible review of customer\nservice targets; (4) change the selection process of the auditor; and (5) change the due\ndate of the quality assurance proposal to August 16, 1998.\n\n129. The Stipulation addressed only some of the issues raised by the parties in the\nmotions for rehearing. However, at the April 1, 1998 open meeting, the EGS\nrepresentative indicated that if the Commission adopted the Stipulation as drafted, the\nparties would not appeal the Order.\n\n\nB. Conclusions ofLaw\n\n 1.     Entergy Gulf States, Inc., (EGS) 1s a public utility as defmed in PURA\n'§ 31.002(1).\n\n2.     The Commission has jurisdiction over issues addressed in this Order in\naccordance with PURA §§ 14.001, 31.001, 32.001, 33.122, 36.001-36.151, and 38.071.\n\n3.     The Commission has jurisdiction over all matters relating to the conduct of a\nhearing in this case, in accordance with PURA § 14.051.\n\n4.     This Order is issued in accordance with TEX. Gov'TCODEANN. § 2001.141.\n\n5.       PURA § 37.151(2) requires that EGS provide continuous and adequate service in\nits certificated service territory.\n\n6.     EGS is obligated, pursuant to PURA § 38.001, to furnish service,\ninstrumentalities, and facilities that are safe, adequate, efficient; and reasonable.\n\n7.    EGS has failed to provide continuous and adequate service to many of its\ncustomers, as required by PURA §§ 37.151(2) and 38.001.\n\n8.     In establishing a reasonable return on invested capital, the Commission is\nrequired, among other things, to consider the quality of the utility's service. PURA\n§ 36.052(3).\n\n9.      The Commission, after notice and hearing, may order an electric. utility to provide ·\nspecified improvements in its service and in a specified area if (a) service in the area is\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                       Page 51\n\ninadequate or substantially inferior to service in a comparable area; and (b) requiring the\ncompany to provide the improved service is reasonable.

The remedies proposed in the Stipulation are tailored to achieve the desired result\nas contemplated in the Final Order; implementation of such remedies is in the public\ninterest.\n\n\n                                  V.       Ordering Paragraphs\n\n      1. Upon issuance of a final order in EGS' pending rate case in Docket No.\n         16705, the Company shall calculate the revenues equal to 60~basis points,\n         and appropriate taxes, of the ROE established in Docket No. 16705.\n\n      2. Within 30 days after issuance of the final order in Docket No. 16705, the\n         Company shall submit to the Commission its calculation of the revenues\n         equal to 60~basis points, and appropriate taxes, for Commission review and\n         approval.\n\n      3. If a rate reduction is ordered in Docket No. 16705, the Company shall refund\n         to its customers an amount equal to 60-basis points of its ROE authorized in\n         Docket No. 16705, plus appropriate taxes, for the period from June 1, 1996,\n         through the effective date of this Order. 135\n\n      4. As of the effective date of this Order, the Company shall reduce collections\n         from customers by an amount equal to 30-basis points, and appropriate\n         taxes, of the ROE authorized in Docket No. 16705.\n\n      5. As of the effective date of this Order, the Company shall establish an\n         interest~bearing escrow account into which it shall deposit, on an on~going\n         basis, the amount equal to 30~basis points, and appropriate taxes, of its ROE\n         authorized in Docket No. 16705.\n\n      6. The Company shall hire an independent consultant, according to the\n         conditions set out in the amended, non~unanimous stipulation regarding the\n         hiring of consultants, as approved with modifications by the Commission in\n         this docket. The consultant shall assess the distribution system, develop\n         strategies for improvement, revise data~collection practices, establish\n         evaluation criteria, and perform any additional work as set out in the\n         amended, non~unanimous stipulation.\n\n\n\n135\n    If the fmal order in Docket No. 16705 does not mandate any refunds to customers, there will not be a\nrefund of 60-basis points to customers based on this Order for the period from June 1, 1996, up to the\neffective date of this Order.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                       Page 52\n\n\n  7. The Company shall file a quality assurance proposal governing the\n     collection, recording, and reporting of SAID! and SAIFI, and any other\n     relevant service quality measures by August 16, 1998. This filing deadline\n     shall be extended one day for every day the consultant's report addressing\n     the EGS distribution system is filed beyond July 16, 1998.\n\n  8. Twice annually, and starting on June 15, 1998, the Company shall file the\n     Electric System Service Quality Report, including its supplemental filing, to\n     document SAID! and SAIFI feeder-by-feeder data for each six-month\n     period, calculated in the manner discussed in this Order. The Company shall\n     also submit a listing of the worst performing 10 percent of the Company's\n     feeders, twice annually along with their performance data. Beginning on\n     December 15, 1998, and twice annually thereafter, at the same time as the\n     Electric System Service Quality Reports, the Company shall file its\n     Customer Service Reports, relating to service installations, line extensions,\n     and light replacements. Initial Customer Service Reports related to the\n     remaining customer service measures (billing-error rate and call center\n     performance) shall be· due on June 15, 1998. In its December filing each\n     year, the Company shall provide an annual, audited summary of customer\n     performance data.\n\n  9. Beginning in 1999, and no later than March 1 of that and each subsequent\n     year, the Company shall file with the Commission its reconciliation proposal\n     for the funds held in escrow according to this Order for the prior calendar\n     year. The Company's annual filing shall be audited by an independent\n     auditor, and the audit shall be filed with the reconciliation proposal.\n\n  10. If the Commission determines that the Company has achieved the\n      performance s~dards set out in this Order for a minimum acceptable level\n      of improvement for SAIDI and SAIFI for the 10 percent of worst feeders\n      and, if applicable, major-storm restoration process, the Company may retain\n      one-third of the amount in escrow for that year; otherwise, the Company\n      shall refund that amount, plus appropriate taxes, to its Texas distribution-\n      level customers taking service from the non-complying feeders, as explained\n      in section D(1) and D(2)(b) of this Order. If the Commission determines that\n      the Company has achieved the performance standards set out in this Order\n      for the target level improvement for SAID! and SAIFI, the Company may\n      retain one-third of the amount in escrow for that year, otherwise, the\n      Company shall refund that amount, plus appropriate taxes, to all its Texas\n      distribution-level customers, divided on a pro-rata basis within each\n      customer class. If the Commission determines that the Company has\n      achieved the performance standards set out in this Order for customer\n      service, the Company may retain one-third of the amount in escrow for that\n      year; otherwise, the Company shall refund that amount, plus appropriate\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                            Page 53\n\n\n      taxes, to its Texas distribution-level customers divided on a pro-rata basis\n      within each customer class.\n\n   11. In conjunction with its annual reconciliation filing, the Company shall\n       submit a proposal for customer notification. At a minimum, the proposal\n       shall include the content and format for a billing insert that explains the\n       service quality requirements, the Company's performance for the preceding\n       year, street light reporting instructions and telephone number, and the\n       amount of the escrow pool retained by the Company and/or refunded to\n       customers.\n\n  12. The Company shall develop and implement, within the six months of the\n      effective date of this Order, a media campaign to inform and educate\n      customers in its Texas service territory about the importance and proper\n      procedure for reporting to the Company malfunctioning or broken street\n      lights.\n\n  13.

(EGS_or the Company) on November 27, 1996, in accordance with Paragraph 9b of\n                                                                                                  1\nthe Stipulation and Agreement approved by the Commission in Docket No. 11292.                         1brough\nthis Order, the Commission adopts in part and modifies in part the Proposal for Decision (PFD)\nas corrected and the Supplemental Proposal for Decision (SPFD) issued by the State Office of\nAdministrative Hearings (SOAH) Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) in late March 1998.2\n\n                                           I.       Introduction\n\n        The SOAH ALJs conducted separate evidentiary hearings on the four component parts of\nthis docket: fuel, revenue requirement, cost allocation/rate design, and competitive issues. After\ncompletion of the hearings and review of the record evidence, the ALJs recommended that the\nCommission order EGS to reduce its current Texas retail base rates by $137 million, which\n\n        1\n         Application of Entergy Corporation and Gulf States Utilities Company for Sale, Transfer or Merger,\nDocketNo.11292, 19 P.U.C. BULL. 2040,2041 (Ordering Paragraph 5) (Dec. 29, 1993).\n        2\n            The ALJs issued the PFD on March 25, 1998, as revised by clarifications, revised text, and revised\nschedules filed on June 4, 12, and 16, 1998. The ALJs issued the SPFD, which addresses supplemental fuel-related\nissues, on March 27, 1998. The Commission considered the matters addressed in this Order at its open meetings\nconvened on June 30, July 8 through 10, July 13, July 16, and July 22, 1998. The Commission issued its \"fmal\"\norder in this docket on July 22, 1998. The Commission considered motions for rehearing at its open meetings\nconvened on August 26, and October 8, 1998. A more detailed procedural history of this case is contained in\nAttachment A to the PFD and the Findings of Fact (FoF) and Conclusions of Law (CoL), as modified, contained in\nthis Order.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                       Second Order on Rehearing                                Page2 oflSS\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\nrepresents a 29% reduction from current base rates.                   The rationale for this recommended\nreduction is set forth in detail in the PFD and SPFD which, together, total over 800 pages.\n\n         In this Order, the Commission directs EGS to reduce its Texas retail base rates in\nconformance with the attached schedules (approximately $111 million, or $26 million less than\nthe reduction recommended by the ALJs). This base rate reduction, and the Commission's\nrationale for modifying portions of the PFD and SPFD, are explained in detail in the Discussion\nsection of this Order. In this Introduction, the Commission focuses primarily on the three most\ncontentious issues in this docket: (1) treatment of EGS' claimed affiliate expenses; (2) the\ntreatment of EGS' \"excess costs over market\" (referred to either as \"ECOM'' or \"potentially\nstranded investment\"); and (3) interruptible service.\n\n                                          A.       Affiliate Expenses\n\n         The ALJs concluded in the PFD that EGS failed to meet its statutory burden of proof to\njustify recovery of approximately $86 million in Texas retail affiliate expenses. The ALJs\ntherefore recommended that the Commission disallow all of these claimed costs.3 This $86\nmillion in recommended disallowed expenses is comprised of $49 million billed to EGS by its\ncorporate service affiliate, Entergy Services, Inc. (ESI), or allocated to EGS by its nuclear service\naffiliate, Entergy Operations, Inc. (EOI), plus an additional $37 million direct-billed to-EGS by\nEOI. 4 In the alternative to a full disallowance, the ALJs recommended that the Commission\ncould potentially justify allowing EGS to recover the direct-billed EOI affiliate expenses ($37\nmillion), but that the record clearly required disallowance of the $49 million in ESI and EOI\nallocated expenses. (To avoid confusion, this Order refers to the ESI billed and EOI allocated\nexpenses as the $49 million in disallowed \"ESI\" expenses; the $37 million in EOI direct billed\nexpenses are referred to as the \"EOI'' expenses.) In this Order, the Commission adopts the ALJs'\n\n\n\n         3\n            For convenience, this Introduction refers only to the Texas retail affiliate expenses claimed by EGS. The\nCompany's application and the PFD actually refer primarily to \"system-wide\" affiliate expenses in the range of\n$200 million. The system-wide expenses include affiliate expenses allocable to EGS' services in Louisiana,\nservices in the Texas wholesale market, and services in the Texas retail market.\n         4\n           The complexity· of the affiliate transactions affecting EGS (previously Gulf States Utilities, Inc. (GSU))\nsignificantly increased when Entergy Corporation purchased GSU in 1993, thereby creating EGS.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                         Second Order on Rehearing                          Page t 1 nf 155\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\nare now declining. By allowing the Company to surcharge the AOD expense over a three-year\nperiod, the Commission moves closer to intergenerational equity than would occur if future\ncustomers are required to pay the AOD over the remaining life of River Bend. Thus, the\nCommission's treatment both mitigates EGS' ECOM and better matches the recovery period for\nthe AOD to the time period in which the AOD would normally have been expensed.\n\n                                        C.       Interruptible Service\n\n        The Commission concludes that the current demand charge credits provided to the\ninterruptible service (IS) customers will not be subject to partial imputation as recommended by\nthe ALJs. The current IS demand and energy charges also will not be reduced in tandem with the\nbase rate reductions applicable to firm customers. Instead, the demand and energy charges to IS\ncustomers, under the IS rider, will be frozen at current levels. This treatment results in the IS\ncustomers continuing to receive interruptible service at rates below firm service, but narrows the\ndemand charge credit as base rates for finn customers are reduced. Also, by freezing the energy\ncharges billed to IS customers under the IS rider, the Commission is ensuring that IS customers\nare allocated their fair share of transmission costs and, where applicable, distribution costs.\n\n                                   D.         Overall Effect of this Order\n\n        The Commission affirms the majority ofthe PFD, but concludes that the record evidence\nrequires modification to a number of findings and conclusions reached by the ALJs. In addition\nto the modification summarized above, the Commission modifies the ALJs' recommendations to\nconclude that (1) EGS' wheeling expenses and revenues should be subject to base rate treatment,\nrather than fuel reconciliation and fuel surcharges; (2) in recognition of the remedies established\nin EGS service quality case,45 the Company's rate ofreturn on equity (ROE) will be set at 11.1%\nfor the period June 1, 1996 through May 12, 1998, and at 11.4% from May 13, 1998 through the\n                                                                           26\nremainder of the effective period of the rates in this docket;                  and (3) the Company is also\n\n\n        25\n           Entergy GUlf States, Inc.

Thus, the ROE reduction remedy will also apply in at least some portion ofEGS' next\neffective rate period.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                Second Order on Rehearing                      Page 12 of 155\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\nentitled to recover approximately $1 0 million more in fuel expense than recommended by the\nALJs.\n\n        The following discussion addresses each of the Commission's modifications to the PFD\nand SPFD. The discussion does not track the sequence of the SOAH recommendations, but\nbegins with the larger transition items arising in the competitive issues and revenue requirement\nphases. Discussion of the cost allocation/rate design and fuel issues follows in that sequence.\nThis Order also includes a separate section addressing how refunds will be treated in this docket,\nincluding refunds resulting from a companion order on rehearing issued on September 2, 1998 in\nGulfStates Utilities Company Remand ofActual Taxes Paid Issues, Docket No. 18290.\n\n        Also attached to this Order are schedules detailing (1) the Company-wide Revenue\nRequirement and Invested Capital (Commission Schedules I through VI); (2) the Revenue\nRequirement and Revenue Deficiency (Commission Schedule KS-Jl); (3) the Texas Retail Class\nRevenue Requirement Assignment, the Texas Retail Class Revenue Requirement Allocation, and\nthe Texas Retail Class Rate Base Allocation (Commission Schedules KS-TX/1 through KS-\nTX/3, respectively); and (4) the Calculation of the Fixed Fuel Factor and the Allocation of Fuel\nOver/Under Recovery by Rate Class (Commission Schedules KP-Fuel/1 and KP-Fuel/2,\nrespectively).\n\n        To the extent not addressed below, the Commission affirms the ALJs' discussions and\nproposed findings of fact (FoFs) and conclusions of law (CoLs) without substantive\nmodification.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                       Second Order on Rehearing               Page 29 of 155\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\nthe ALJs in effect are recommending an improper double disallowance because, in the SPFD, the\nALJs recommend disallowance of certain natural gas expenses related to fuel burns in February\nof 1996. As stated by General Counsel, \"[t]he Commission therefore should not disallow\nimprudent fuel costs related to EGS's failure to burn fuel oil, on the one hand, and refuse to\ninclude the fuel oil in inventory, on the other.\"60\n\n        The Commission agrees with General Counsel and EGS; if the February 1996 natural gas\nexpenses are to be disallowed as imprudent (which they are, as discussed below), the Company\nshould be permitted to recover the costs of the No.6 fuel oil that it should have burned in lieu of\nthe disallowed high cost natural gas. Accordingly, to reflect the preponderance of evidence in\nthe record, FoF 117 is modified and F oF 117A is added to fmd that the fuel oil working capital in\nrate base is $5,110,085, rather than $2,085,630.\n\n5.      Return on Equity\n\n        The Commission affirms the ALJs' recommendation to set the Company's ROE at 11.7%\nin this docket with the following modifications. First, the Commission acknowledges that an\nappropriate range for EGS' ROE is 9.65% to 13.94%. This range is based on both the constant\ngrowth and the multi-stage non-constant growth discounted cash flow (DCF) analyses. As the\nALJs recognized, using both of these models more closely resembles the balance employed by\nthe Commission in Docket No. 14965. Accordingly, FoFs 128 and 129 are modified, New FoF\n128A is added, and FoFs 130-132 are deleted. Additionally, the Commission modifies FoF 134\nto reflect that, although adjustments to EGS' ROE were not modified in this case for poor\ndemand-side management and affiliate transactions, the Conunission retains full discretion to\nmake such adjustments in a future case.\n\n        Second, a new FoF 128B is added to reduce the 11.7% ROE by 60 basis points to 11.1%\nfor the period June 1, 1996 through May 12, 1998, and by 30 basis points to 11.4% from May 13,\n1998 through the remainder of the period in which the rates subject to this docket are in effect.\nThis bifurcated ROE reduction is required by the Commission's determinations in the related\n\n        60\n             See General Counsel's Brief on Exceptions at 18.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                       Second Order on Rehearing                       Page 30 oft 55\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\nEGS Service Quality proceeding (Docket No. 18249), which concluded that the ROE ultimately\nauthorized in this docket (Docket No. 16705) would be reduced permanently by 60 basis points\nfrom the date refunds become effective in this docket \"through the effective date of [the final\norder in Docket No. 18249].\"61 After the effective date of the fmal order in Docket No. 18249\n(that is, May 12, 1998), the authorized ROE in Docket No. Hi705 is increased by 30 basis points\nto 11.4%, but the Company must escrow that 30 basis points of ROE. As provided in EGS\nService Quality, the Company will be pennitted to retain up to the full amount of the escrowed\n30 basis points if it meets certain service quality benchmarks established in that proceeding. 62 If\nit does not meet those benchmarks, some portion or all of the escrowed amount will be refunded\nto customers, thus effectively resulting in a minimum ROE of 11.1 %. These ROE reductions are\nnot predicated on a finding that the ALJs erred in recommending the 11.7% ROE. Rather, they\nare based on the Commission's rulings in EGS Service Quality. Accordingly, new FoF 128B is\nnot a modification to the ALJs' ROE recommendation subject to APA § 2003.049(g), but rather\nis made to conform the ROE in this docket to the rulings in Docket No. 18249.\n\n        Third, the reduction to the Company's authorized ROE also results in a reduction to the\nALJs' recommended return on invested capita1. 63 This authorized overall return dollar amount is\ntherefore reduced as reflected on the attached Commission Schedules I and IV. In addition, FoFs\n134 and 135 are modified respectively to clarify that only the direct-billed EOI expenses are\napproved in this docket, and to reflect the adjustment to the overall cost of capital as a result of\nthe Commission's decisions in EGS Service Quality.\n\n6.      Amortization Expense\n\n        The amortization expense reflected on Schedule I must be decreased to reflect the\nremoval of $9 million in annual amortization expenses related to the AOD discussed in the\n\n\n        61\n             EGS Service Quality Order on Rehearing at 51 (Ordering Paragraph 3).\n        62\n             Id at Ord~ring Paragraph 5.\n        63\n              This figure is the corrected amount reflected in Schedules I and IV of the ALJs' June 12, 1998\nclarification. The original PFD recommends a slightly higher figure. PFD at 317.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                Second Order on Rehearing                     Page 54 of 155\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\nbefore the next fuel reconciliation. Therefore, EGS is not required to file a fuel reconciliation\nwith the November 1998 rate case, and a good cause exception to the rate case filing requirement\nis granted accordingly. The SOAR ALJs assigned to the next case will address the procedural\nissues raised by EGS.     Otherwise, EGS- should be prepared to address any other revenue\nrequirement and major rate design issues in the November 1998 rate case. Accordingly, FoFs\n96R through 96U are added to clarify this issue.\n\n        Finally, EGS has not proposed to recover its rate case expenses or the Cities' rate case\nexpenses in this docket. The question remained whether the Company might attempt to recover\nthese expenses in a future docket.     At the Commission's open meeting on July 10, 1998,\nrepresentatives of EGS committed orally on the record that the Company will not seek to recover\nCities' or its own rate case expenses in this proceeding or any future proceeding. Accordingly, a\nFoF 164 is modified and a new FoF 164A is added to reflect this commitment.\n\n                       IV.    Findings ofFact and Conclusions ofLaw\n\n        The section consolidates the FoFs and CoLs contained in both the PFD and SPFD, as\nmodified in accordance with the foregoing discussion. The numbering sequence contained in the\nPFD is retained; the SPFD FoFs and CoLs are integrated into this sequence by placing them in\nthe proper location and changing the SPFD number to a corresponding numbered and lettered\ndesignation. The designation \"SFoF\" refers to the fmdings in the Supplemental PFD. The\nreferences to \"Revised PFD\" refer to the corrected pages to the PFD filed by the ALJs on June 4,\n1998.\n                                      A. Findings of Fact\n\n1.

No expenditures necessary to produce cost savings related to the merger between EGS\n       and Entergy Corporation should be reflected in rate base consistent with the decision to\n       disallow all such costs.\n\n\n123.   From April 1994 through the end of the test year, June 30, 1996, EGS collected\n       $36,205,679 on a total Company basis for post-retirement expenses other than pensions\n       (OPEBs). This amount should not be reduced by EGS' OPEB trust funds, as EGS has\n       not had access to the funds with which to fund rate base.\n\n\n124.   The following are appropriate adjustments to EGS' requested level of invested capital:\n       Accmmt                        13 Mo. Ayg.            Adjustment           Total Level\n       Injuries and Damages           ($5,543,000)           $643,000              ($4,899,000)\n       Coal Car Maint. Reserve        ($4,071 ,000)             ($91,000)          ($4,162,000)\n       Customer Deposits             ($21,510,000)          ($g60,000)           ($22,370,000)\n       Contractor Retainage             ($455,000)               11,000              ($444,000)\n\n\n       Cost of Capital\n125.   EGS' cost of capital should be based on a capital structure consisting of 48.06% long-\n       term debt, 2.16% QUIPS, 6.52% preferred stock, and 43.26% common equity.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705               Second Order on Rehearing                      Page 83 of 155\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n       Employee Pensions and Benefits\n142.   Total electric pension expense should reflect a 3.5% assumed salary escalation factor, an\n       eight percent discount rate, and an adjustment to reflect the declining employee levels\n       through January 1997.\n\n\n143.   EGS' reasonable and necessary pension expense through January 1997 is ($3,161,011).\n       (See Revised PFD.)\n\n\n144.   Post-retirement benefits other than pension should be $8,800,267 for total electric. This\n       includes a medical cost trend rate of 7.9%, an eight percent discount rate, and employee\n       levels through January 1997. It is not reasonable to permit a utility to recover estimated\n       costs that exceed by any large degree the actual costs experienced in the test year. The\n       $8.8 million level of expense reasonably approximates EGS' test year OPEB expense.\n\n\n       Production Operation and Maintenance Expense\n\n145.   EGS included $136,327,381 in production O&M expense, of which $51,491,665 relates\n       to fossil plants. Production O&M expense for its Big Cajun II Unit 3 plant should be\n       $6,428,935, which amounts to a $5,921,024 reduction from EGS' requested O&M\n       expense for this plant.    Using EGS' revised figures based on the FERC Form 1\n       methodology achieves a reasonable total fossil plant O&M expense of$45,570,641.\n\n\n       Insurance Expense\n146.   EGS' reasonable insurance expense is $1,651,321 per year for current losses.          With\n       regard to current losses, EGS should accrue only enough each year to cover typical storm\n       damage. (See Revised PFD.)\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                 Second Order on Rehearing                     Page 84 of 155\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n147.   Any reduction to the reserve fund occurring after the test year should not be considered in\n       this case because EGS did not prove a reasonable post-test-year level for its existing\n       reserve fund or that the amount expended in 1997 to reduce the fund was prudent or\n       appropriate. Reserve fund levels following the test year in this case can be addressed in\n       EGS' November 1998 rate filing when all parties will have the opportunity to evaluate\n       the reasonableness of changes to the insurance reserve fund.\n\n\n       Mfiliate Expenses\n148.   Under PURA § 11.003(2), a utility's affiliates include any entity owning five percent or\n       more of a utility and any entity in which the holding company has a five percent\n       ownership interest. Accordingly, Entergy Service, Inc. (ESI) and Entergy Operations,\n       Inc. (EOI), subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation, are EGS' affiliates. Entergy Services,\n       Inc. provides numerous services ranging from administrative functions to providing fuel\n       supplies to Entergy's various affiliates. Entergy Operations, Inc. is responsible for the\n       management, operation, and support of the five nuclear generating units owned by the\n       Entergy operating companies.\n\n\n149.   EGS provided evidence of ESI expenses based on the total of all expenses charged.\n       Neither proof by an aggregate finding as to total expenses nor total expenses for that\n       affiliate is viable in this docket--because so many services are provided by ESI, the\n       quantity and diversity of these costs is enormous and involve thousands of items billed\n       during the test-year period.      For this reason, EGS must provide evidence of the\n       reasonableness and necessity of its affiliate expense in strict compliance with Section\n       36.058 of PURA. That is, it must provide evidence supporting the reasonableness and\n       necessity of these expenses by class of costs. It failed to do this.\n\f             Appendix6\n\n\n         PUC Docket No. 39896,\n   Hearing on the Merits Transcript:\nExcerpts of Direct and Cross---Examination\n    of ETI Witness Shawn Corkran\n\f               SOAH DOCKET NO.

Thank you.\n 8                          CROSS-EXAMINATION\n 9   BY MR. MACK:\n10       Q    Good afternoon, Mr. Corkran.        My name is\n11   Stephen Mack.     I have a few questions for you about the\n12   1997 ice storm that Entergy is requesting recovery from\n13   customers.     Okay?\n14       A    Okay.\n15       Q    But before we get to that, I want to talk a\n16   little bit about an order you reference in your rebuttal\n17   testimony, and that's the order in Docket 18249.          Do you\n18   recall referencing that order?\n19       A    Yes, I do.\n20       Q    And Docket 18249 was a case established by the\n21   Commission to address the service quality issues of\n22   Entergy Gulf States.     Isn't that right?\n23       A    That's my understanding.\n24       Q    And in that case, the Commission ultimately\n25   determined that the quality of Entergy's electric\n\n                    KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                              512.474.2233\n\f                                                              Page 570\n\n 1   service to its customers was poor.          Isn't that right?\n 2       A       Yes; I understand they identified deficiencies.\n 3       Q       Okay.     So in order to remedy the Company's\n 4   service quality issues, the Commission ordered an\n 5   incentive program to encourage the Company to fix its\n 6   problems.     Isn't that right?\n 7       A       By \"incentive program,\" are you referring to\n 8   the 60 bases point reduction and then the ability to\n 9   limit some of that?\n10       Q       There was -- yeah, we'll get to that, but there\n11   was an incentive plan, wasn't there, ordered as part of\n12   that case?     And if it helps you, I can bring you a copy\n13   of the order and point you to the page, if you'd like.\n14       A       Okay.     Yes, sir, I'd like to see that just to\n15   remind me and refresh me.\n16                       JUDGE BURKHALTER:   And, Mr. Corkran, I'm\n17   having a hard time hearing you.\n18                       WITNESS CORKRAN:    Okay.\n19                       JUDGE BURKHALTER:    Thank you.\n20                       MR. MACK:   May I approach the witness?\n21                       JUDGE BURKHALTER:    Yes.\n22       Q       (BY MR. MACK)       And I'm directing you to Page 28\n23   of the Final Order on Rehearing in Docket No. 18249.\n24   Okay?\n25       A       Okay.\n\n                    KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                              512.474.2233\n\f                                                                  Page 571\n\n 1       Q      And could you just -- and basically what it\n 2   says is,   11\n                     The Commission concludes that the Company's\n 3   service quality must be improved.           The following\n 4   incentive plan lays out the remedies to help EGS achieve\n 5   such improvements.      11\n                                   Isn't that correct?\n 6       A      Yes, that's correct.\n\n 7       Q      And that's the incentive plan I'm referring to.\n 8       A      Okay.     And I'm familiar with that, yes, sir.\n\n 9       Q      Okay.     And I think you just mentioned as part\n10   of that incentive plan the Commission ordered a\n11   reduction to Entergy's ROE.           Is that right?\n12       A      That's my understanding.\n13       Q      And if Entergy met some of its              some of the\n14   goals in this order, it could earn some of that back.\n15   Isn't that right?\n16       A      Yes, sir.         That's what I understand.\n17       Q      All right.         But you understand that this\n18   incentive program was only meant to fix the problem of\n19   Entergy's service quality.           Is that right?\n\n20       A      Yes.      As I understand, it was focused on a\n21   number of areas of service quality that touched into the\n22   reliability areas, call center performance.              There were\n23   several areas in that service quality area.\n\n24       Q      And nothing in this order determined who should\n25   be responsible for paying for the damage and outages\n\n                       KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                 512.474.2233\n\f                                                                       Page 572\n\n 1   caused by the service quality issues.              Isn•t that right?\n 2           A    I•m not aware, no.\n 3           Q    Are you aware whether the order addressed the\n 4   1997 ice storm?\n\n 5           A    I•m aware that it was referenced in some of the\n 6   findings, but I don•t know specifically when you say\n 7   11\n          addressed 11 what you mean by   11\n                                               addressed.   11\n                                                                 I mean, I\n 8   understand it was referenced in the order and in the\n 9   project.\n10           Q    And you said you read the order and you•re\n11   familiar with it?\n12           A    I have read it, yes.\n13           Q    Well, one issue that the ALJs and the\n14   Commission will have to address in this case is who\n15   should be responsible for paying for the damage caused\n16   by the 1997 ice storm.         Isn•t that right?\n\n17           A    Yes, I believe so.\n\n18           Q    And in this order that you reference in your\n19   rebuttal testimony, I believe the Commission found that\n20   the damage caused was greatly exacerbated by the\n21   Company•s service quality issues.              Isn•t that right?\n22           A    That•s -- I understand that finding, yes.\n23           Q    And the expense we•re talking about for this\n24   1997 ice storm in this case is 13 million?\n\n25           A    That•s correct.\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                         Page 573\n\n 1       Q    And that's what the Company is requesting\n 2   recovery for from its customers?\n 3       A    Yes.\n 4       Q    And I believe it's your position in the\n 5   rebuttal that even though the Company's service quality\n 6   issues was a major factor in the number and duration of\n 7   outages, it's the customers that should have to pay\n 8   100 percent of these costs.     Is that right?\n\n 9      A     That's my position, yes.\n10       Q    Now, since this case, has Entergy improved its\n11   quality of service?\n12       A    Yes, sir, we have.\n13       Q    So would it be true that the expenses incurred\n14   ln the 1997 ice storm, if that same storm were to happen\n15   today, would not be as great?\n16      A     I'm not certain.     I mean, you know, the finding\n17   of fact that was in the docket indicated that probably\n18   would be the case.\n19       Q    Okay.   And if we can rely on that finding of\n20   fact of the Commission to be accurate, if the same storm\n21   were to occur now or in the future, the expense level\n22   wouldn't be as great.   Is that right?\n23       A    I mean, it's difficult to say.     You know, there\n24   was a lot of information given with respect to\n25   vegetation in particular exacerbating the issue, but I'm\n\n                 KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                           512.474.2233\n\f                                                           Page 574\n\n 1   also aware that we had icing in the range of one to\n 2   three inches, which was very significant and exceeded\n 3   our design criteria and also exceeded the design\n 4   criteria of the NESC, the National Electric Safety Code.\n 5                    So, yes, while there were things that did\n 6   exacerbate the damage, it's difficult for me to say\n 7   that, you know,    it would be -- you know,   I can't tell\n 8   you how much worse.     I understand it exacerbated it and\n 9   made it somewhat worse, but it's difficult to say.\n\n10       Q    But it's your testimony that Entergy has\n11   greatly improved its quality of service issues since\n\n12   that case?\n13       A    We have.\n\n14       Q    All right.     Are you aware of a Company witness\n\n15   named Gregory Wilson?\n\n16       A    Yes,    I'm aware of the name.\n\n17       Q    And in this case, I'll submit to you he\n18   performs a study to estimate an annual level of expense\n19   for projected storms.     Are you aware of that?\n\n20       A    Yes.\n\n21       Q    Okay.     And to the extent he were to include the\n22   full amount of the 1997 ice storm in his analysis, that\n23   would not be correct, would it, since the Company has\n24   improved its service quality issues -- quality of\n25   service issues?     I'm sorry.\n\n                  KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                            512.474.2233\n\f                                                                 Page 575\n\n 1       A      I'm not sure I understand your question.          Help\n 2   me understand the question.\n 3       Q      All right.\n 4       A      Are you saying that his analysis is based on\n 5   the performance from the early --\n\n 6       Q      Do you know whether he has included in his\n 7   analysis for estimating future storms the full amount of\n 8   the 1997 ice storm?\n\n 9       A      I really do not know.        I'm aware that he\n10   testified in this case, but I'm not familiar with his\n11   testimony.       I mean, you know, particularly I was focused\n12   on the costs associated with the recovery and, you know,\n13   how they -- how they really tied to what we saw in the\n14   field.     I'm not real familiar with Mr. Wilson's\n15   testimony --\n16       Q      All right.        I think I put ln\n17       A       -- in what he proposed.\n\n18       Q       I think I put in front of you an excerpt of his\n19   testimony.\n20       A      Okay.\n21       Q      Do you have that?\n22       A       I   do.\n23                         MR.

MACK:     Yes.\n 4       Q     (BY MR. MACK)       And on Page 7 of his testimony,\n 5   Lines 15 and 16, he recommends an amount for annual\n 6   expected losses of 4.89 million.           Is that right?\n 7       A     Yes.     On Lines 15 and 16?\n 8       Q     Yes.\n 9       A     Yes, that's the number I see.\n10       Q     Okay.     And on Lines 19 through 21, he says he\n11   calculates that number \"using a Monte Carlo simulation\n12   run on the loss history,\" which he references as being\n13   on Exhibit   GSW~3.    Do you see that?\n14       A     Yes, I see the statement.\n15       Q     Okay.     And can you turn the page to Exhibit\n16   GSW-3?   And can you verify for us that the 1997 ice\n17   storm was included in his analysis?\n18       A     I can't verify it.           I see a large number there\n19   of similar magnitude to the 13 million.\n20       Q     And that large number has been trended to\n21   increase quite a bit, hasn't it?\n22       A     Yes, it has.\n23                     MR.

You're asking if a successful\n15   restoration means that the costs were prudent,\n16   necessary?\n17       Q      Does a successful restoration effort for a\n18   given storm mean that all the -- all the costs related\n19   to that storm were prudent necessarily?\n20       A      I mean, I'm not sure.     I can't speak to the\n21   definition of \"prudency,\" where it would fall.\n22       Q      Fair enough.\n23                    I wanted to ask you a little bit about\n24   that order from the Docket 18249 that Mr. Mack asked you\n25   about.\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                             512.474.2233\n\f                                                               Page 578\n\n 1                    MS. FERRIS:    May I approach, Your Honor?\n 2                    JUDGE BURKHALTER:    Yes.\n 3                    MS. FERRIS:     I have an excerpt from the\n 4   hearing, and I will not be offering this as evidence\n 5   because it will speak for itself.        It's merely a\n 6   demonstrative.\n 7       A    Okay.     Thank you.\n 8       Q    (BY MS. FERRIS)        Could you turn to Page 18 of\n 9   the order on.rehearing for Docket 18249?\n10       A    Okay.\n11       Q    There is a sentence that begins at the very end\n12   of the third line from the bottom, and it continues to\n13   the top of the next page.        Could you read that sentence\n14   for us, please?     It begins with the word \"While.\"\n15       A    The sentence reads,       \"While Company's initial\n16   efforts to mobilize and deploy additional nonEGS\n17   personnel were slow and caused concern, vegetation\n18   management failures greatly aggravated the situation.\"\n19       Q    Thank you.     And just above, I guess this would\n20   be three lines down in the middle of the line.           There's\n21   another sentence that begins with the word \"A major,\"\n22   could you read that sentence?\n23       A    Yes.     The sentence reads,    \"A major cause of the\n24   outages during the storm were broken or bowed ice-laden\n25   tree limbs overhanging the wires.\"\n\n                 KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                           512.474.2233\n\f                                                                    Page 579\n\n 1          Q      Further down the order states that \"The\n 2   Company's failure to clear the limbs before the storm\n 3   was a major factor in the number and duration of the\n 4   outages experienced by customers.\"                Is that right?\n 5          A     Yes   1   that's correct.   That's what it says.\n 6          Q     Thank you.       Did the cost to restore the system\n 7   after the 1997 ice storm 1 was it increased as a result\n 8   of EGI's imprudence?\n 9          A      Imprudence?\n10          Q     Or was it -- let me rephrase.            Were the costs\n11   of the 1997 ice storm 1 to recovery it 1 were those costs\n12   increased due to the state of the vegetation management?\n13          A     My understanding is that was a finding 1 was\n14   that it did exacerbate the storm damage.\n\n15          Q     Did the Company          or excuse me -- has the\n16   Company made any attempt to quantify the extent to which\n17   restoration costs were increased as a result of the\n18   state of their vegetation management?\n\n19          A     Not that I'm aware of.\n20          Q      Okay.

The load has        well, there has been some years\n18   when load did not increase very much, but overall on the\n\n19   average since I became president, it has grown.\n\n20          Q      Okay.

There's energy,\n\n23   ~hich       is the sales, the megawatt-hours that we sell, and\n\n24   theie•s also the need for additional resources for\n\n25   reliability, which would be the capacity that we would\n\n                      KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                512.474.2233\n\f                                                                    Page 183\n\n    1    that time.

I meant to point that out\n15   earlier.\n16                  JUDGE BURKHALTER:    Well, I tell you what,\n17   if there's no objection to it, I'll go ahead and admit\n18   it as an exhibit.

And to the extent that we-don't\n12   understand   whethe~   something is missing or not, it would\n13 .be up to the company to provide optional completeness go\n14   that.   This is an admission by a party-opponent.\n\n15                   JUDGE ARNOLD:     If I can see the\n16   originally-supplied        I .don't know what the company\n17   gave you in discovery.

And what I was saying,\n\n21   he was say1ng -- if we look go Page 201, which is the\n\n22 . one with the shading, the first one with shading, we can\n23   see that the form has shading the same place that we\n\n24   have shading, the 18 has shading.\n\n25                    JUDGE ARNOLD :    No.    I understand that.

FERRIS:       Your Honor, if the form had\n 4   shading, it indicates you're not supposed to fill it ln\n 5   go your 10     -~   I mean, you don't fill in go shading.             I\n 6   can show you an example.              On Page 102 of the form go\n 7   Line 68 there is a title in black, \"Current and Accrued\n 8   Liabilities.\"        It's shaded in.       And then things that\n 9   fall below it are not shaded in, because that's where\n10   you fill in.\n\n11                       JUDGE ARNOLD:        Given the fact that this\n12   has been supplied in response to a discovery request,\n13   I'm going to go ahead and let it in.                 If the company\n14   believes there is something hidden in the blacked-out\n15   areas, they can supply it.\n\n16                       MR.

It's not an\n     6    excerpt?\n      7                      MR~   MACK:   That is an excerpt. ·Also\n      8   attached, or attached with the original was a highly\n      9   sensitive cost/benefit analysis.\n     10                      MR.

In this question,\nr\nI    20   the City of Rose City asked the company to provide any\n     21   studies or analysis to support the statement that call\n     22   options provide the necessary degree of reliability for\n     23   fuel supply at a lower cost than alternative means.

And a third factor\n\n 5   is when the amount of the expenses can be substantial\n 6   enough that they can actually impair the company's\n 7   integrity or its financial wholeness.\n\n 8       Q      So rate case expenses, those impair the\n 9   company's financial integrity if they're not included in\n10   a rider?\n\n11       A      Well, I think that they could.    I mean, they\n12   could hurt it.\n\n13       Q      What's that based on?\n\n14       A      Well, the fact that. rate case expenses these\n15   days are in the many multimillions of dollars.       And, in\n16   fact, in this case, I guess you're asking for\n17   12 million.\n\n18                    MR. WILLIAMS:    Linda tells me I neglected\n19   to offer ETI Exhibit 83.      I offer that exhibit at this\n\n20   point.\n\n21                    JUDGE WALSTON:    Any objection?\n\n22                    MR. MACK:   Your Honors, Mr. Williams kind\n23   of made the insinuation that Schedule A from the last\n\n24   case, Docket 37744, was not -- were not retail numbers.\n\n25                    I think we would like to object as far as\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                              512.474.2233\n\f                                                          Page 1191\n\n1    optional completeness so that we can provide documents\n\n2    to show that these are retail numbers ..\n\n3                    JUDGE WALSTON:    Any other objections?     All\n\n4    right.    Then, Exhibit ETI-83 is. admitted subject to\n\n5    showing of optional·completeness.\n\n 6                   (Exhibit ETI No. 83 admitted)\n\n 7                   MR. WILLIAMS:    Thank you.\n\n 8         Q    (BY MR. WILLIAMS)     Let me go back to the rider.\n\n 9   Are you aware of any Commission ruling indicating that\n\n10   financial integrity is a necessary showing to get a rate\n\n11   case expense rider?\n\n12         A    No, I'm not.\n\n13         Q    So putting that to one side, the main basis you\n\n14   have for approving of riders is that costs are volatile,\n\n15   costs are beyond the Company's control.       Correct?\n\n16         A    Those are the main ones.      I think the courts\n\n17   have looked at and I think commissions have approved or\n\n18   based their decisions on.\n\n19         Q    Also, . when you say· \"beyond the control,\" it• s\n\n20   not       the Company is not going to be able to reduce its\n\n21   costs or make those costs smaller by the way of managing\n\n22   them.     It's just sort of stuck with them.     Correct?\n\n23         A     I don't understand your question.\n\n24         Q     Well, if there's a cost that you can manage\n\n25 . you_r business in a way to reduce it, in your view that\n\n                    KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                           Page 1456\n\n 1   admiss.ion of Cities Exhibits 43A and 43B.\n\n 2                 JUDGE BURKHALTER:     Any objection?\n\n 3                 MR.

Co~ld   I direct your attention to what's\n14   been Bates stamped page No. TIEC 4-2 BB414?\n15                     Are you there?\n\n16       A    BB414?\n\n17       Q    Yes, ma'am.\n\n18       A     Okay.\n\n19       Q    And the second·paragraph· from the bottom, the\n\n20   second. sentence of that paragraph, could you read that\n\n21   and tell me whether the costs of -- I'm sorry, Entergy's\n\n22   costs are allocated to Brazos based on the 12CP\n\n23   allocation method?\n\n24       A     The sentence that starts, \"The ETiproduction\"?\n\n25        Q    Yes.\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                            Page 1505\n\n l       A      Yes.\n\n 2       Q      And we've done that in this case?\n\n 3      A       Yes.\n\n 4       Q      Now, let me show you Schedule 041 from the rate\n\n 5   filing package.      This is in evidence.    Let me ask if you\n 6   can identify the amount of the weather normalization in\n\n 7   this case in terms of dollars.\n\n 8       A      Yes.    According to this schedule, base revenues\n 9   were reduced by 22.4 million.        This is the weather\n10   adjustment.\n\n11       Q      Okay.    And other things equal, the utility's\n12   earnings would be $22 million higher than they otherwise\n13   would be during normal weather on account of the\n14 . weather.    Correct?\n\n15       A      Pretax, yes.\n\n16       Q      Okay.    Now, let me show you the 10-K for the\n17   Company for 2011.       This is in evidence already.    Let me\n18   just point to you the net income for ETI for 2011 and\n19   see if you can read that and identify that.\n\n20       A      So for Calendar Year 2011 the report shows net\n\n21   income of 80,845,000.\n\n22       Q      Okay.     And what\n\n23                      MR. VanMIDDLESWORTH:    May I ask -- because\n\n24   I don't have the 10-K with me.\n\n25                      MR. WREN:    Oh, I'm sorry.\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                512.474.2233\n\f                                                                      Page 1506\n\n       1                    MR. VanMIDDLESWORTH:         I was wondering if I\n\n       2    could either see it or know what exhibit it was.\n\n       3                     MR. WREN:    We reserved for optional\n\n       4    completeness.\n\n       5                     MR. VanMIDDLESWORTH:        Until we know that\n       6    it's in the record we would object on asking this\n\n       7    witness to recite from'a company document that hadn't\n       8    been introduced yet.\n\n       9                     JUDGE WALSTON:     I believe the Cities had\nI\nI .\n~     10    offered portions of it, and I think the Company had\n      11    reserved the right for optional completeness.\n\n      12                     MR. WREN:    Correct, Your Honor.        I didn't\n      13    think this would be controversial.           The Cities clearly\n      14    offered the 10-K and I clearly reserved optional\n      15    completeness.\n\n      16                     MR. VanMIDDLESWORTH:        So are you\n      17    offering -- so if he wants to offer the full 10-K 1n,\n      18    then I think that would be appropriate.\n\n      19                     MR. WREN:     I'll be glad to do that.       I\n      20    think that's unnecessary.         It burdens the record, but if·\n\n      21    that's the wish I can do that.\n\n      22                     JUDGE WALSTON:      Okay.\n\n      23                      MR. VanMIDDLESWORTH:        I may be persuaded\n      · 24 ··otherwise, but if you're crossing him on a page that-\n\n       25   hasn't yet been introduced, then I think we would need\n\n                            KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                         512.474.2233\n\f                                                           Page 1507\n\n 1   to see whether it's something that is appropriate for\n 2   optional completeness and --\n\n 3                 MR. WREN:   I'll let you reserve on\n 4   optional completeness.\n\n 5                 JUDGE WALSTON:    I think it would be best,\n 6   since we have had bits and parts and pieces referred to,\n\n 7   I would recommend you go ahead and just offer the whole\n 8   thing in unless you have some problem with that.\n\n 9                 MR. WREN:   So, Your Honor, then I think\n10   this would be ETI Exhibit 98,.because I've reserved 96\n11   and 97.\n12                 JUDGE WALSTON:    Okay.   Then ETI Exhibit 98\n13   will be admitted, and you can get additional copies\n14   bring the additional copies later, obviously.\n15                  (Exhibit ETI No. 98 marked and admitted)\n\n16                 MR. WREN:   Thank you, Your Honor.       The\n17   reference in.question is to Cities Exhibit 8 and 7 that\n18   include excerpts from the 10-K.\n\n19                 JUDGE. WALSTON:   Just for our convenience,\n20   can you refer us to the page number you were questioning\n21   the witness about?\n\n22                 MR. WREN:   Yes, Your Honor.    May I\n23   approach the witness?\n\n24                 JUDGE WALSTON:    Yes.\n\n25       Q     (BY MR. WREN)   Can you tell me the page number\n\n                 KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE,.

NEINAST:      I don't -- no.\n\n    5                   JUDGE ARNOLD:         Doctor, thank you so much.\n    6     You're excused.\n\n     7                  WITNESS SZERSZEN:         You're welcome.    Thank\n     8    you.\n     9                  JUDGE ARNOLD:         And we've reached the time\n    10    for our afternoon break.      Let's come back at 3:35.\n    11                      (Recess:   3:17p.m. to 3:36p.m.)\n    12                  JUDGE ARNOLD:         We're back on the record\n    13    following a break.      Mr. Mack, I understand you have some\n    14 ·matters you want to.discuss.\n    15.                 MR. MACK:       Yes, Your Honor.     Thank you.      A\n    16    couple days ago during the testimony of Mr. Brazell,\n\n    17    Entergy introduced ETI's Exhibit 83, which showed\n\nI   18    Schedule A of the Company's rate filing from the last\n\n    19    case, and I think he was being asked whether that was a\nr   20    total Company number or a wholesale number, and we\n\n    21    reserved the right of optional completeness on that\n\n    22    exhibit.\n\n    23                      And we'd like to introduce Cities\n\n    24    Exhibit 49, which is Schedule A-1, stating that there\n    25    was not a wholesale class in the filing.           The second\n\n                       KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                 512.474.2233\n\f                                                           Page 1687\n\n 1   page to it is Schedule Q from the same filing showing\n 2   what Mr. Brazell noted as his bottom-line number there\n 3   on a retail basis.    So we offer Cities- Exhibit No. 49\n 4   for optional completeness.\n\n 5                   JUDGE ARNOLD:    Any objections?\n\n 6                   MR. NEINAST:    No objections.\n\n 7                   JUDGE ARNOLD:    Admitted.\n\n 8                   (Exhibit Cities No. 49 admitted)\n\n 9                   JUDGE ARNOLD:    Ms. Ferris --\n\n10                   MS.

Correct?\n\n    11                 A       It is Attachment 4.       That's correct.\n\n    12                 Q       And that's where the responsibility ratios are\n    13       calculated?\n\n    14                 A       There are two sets of responsibility ratios\n    15       calculated on that page.

The\narbitrary and capricious standard of review histori-\ncally has been construed narrowly, and we do not\nthink that the legislature intended it to be interpreted\nas a broad, all-encompassing standard for reviewing\nthe rationale of agency actions. Under the foregoing\ndefinition of the arbitrary and capricious standard of\nreview, we hold that the Commission's orders in this\ncase are not arbitrary nor do they constitute an abuse\nof discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The district court found, and\nthe Commission agreed, that the Commission made a\nmathematical error in its calculation of the cash working\ncapital. On appeal, Texas Utilities argues that there is no\nevidence that the Commission made a mathematical error\nand that in any case the district court could not address the\nissue because it was not raised in the motions for rehearing\nfiled with the Commission. See APA § 2001.145. We do\nnot address this point of error.

Kern's opinions were directly chal-\nlenged by Rayshell, however, when he stated that\nhis treatment of Crosby was appropriate and Kern's\ndiagnosis of Crosby was not consistent with her test\nresults. Indeed, the jury could not have relied on\nKern's assessment of Crosby's medical condition\nwhen it rendered its verdict because it awarded her\neven less money for past medical care than what\nKern stated was reasonable and necessary.\n\n     Crosby also complains she had no opportunity\nto cross-examine Kern about his credibility, bias,\nmotive, education, training, and experience. All of\nthese topics, however, were discussed by Rayshell\neither directly or by implication. Moreover, because\nKern was never called as a witness, he had no op-\nportunity to dispute Rayshell's statements that, as\nan expert hired for trial, Kern was careless and\n\n\n\n\n                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Standards of Review .......................................................................................................... 1\nB.     Either the Commission weighed the evidence and concluded that it\n       was not sufficient to allow a determination as to what portion of the\n       storm expenses were due to the negligent state of the Company’s\n       system, or the Commission did not weigh the evidence and decided not\n       to address the issue based upon the irrelevant factor of the passage of\n       time. Either way, the Commission committed reversible error by\n       failing to hold ETI to its burden of proof under PURA § 36.006 and\n       allowing one hundred percent of the $13,014,379 1997 storm restoration\n       expenses to be included in the storm reserve and reflected in rates. .................. 4\nC.     Indisputably, the issue of determining what amount of 1997 storm\n       restoration expenses was prudent, appropriate, and includable in the\n       storm reserve and rates was an issue to be decided in Docket No.\n       39896. That fact does not render the Commission’s Orders in Docket\n       Nos. 18249 and 16705 irrelevant or properly disregarded........................................ 8\nD.     The Commission inappropriately focused on only one aspect of the\n       prudence question and ignored the genesis of the expenses. ................................. 11\nE.     The 60-basis-point reduction to the Company’s return on equity\n       assessed in Docket No. 18249 was not intended to be in lieu of\n       identifying and accounting for the portion of the cost of cleaning up\n       and repairing the damage caused by the Company’s imprudent\n       vegetation management. The Commission acted arbitrarily and\n       capriciously by considering this irrelevant factor and including the\n       entirety of the $13,014,379 in ETI’s storm reserve reflected in rates. .................... 13\nF.     The Commission erred in approving the recovery of imprudent costs. ............... 16\n\n\n                                                                 i\n\fG.      Some of ETI’s storm costs were “reasonably anticipated,” and it was\n        reversible error for the Commission to fail to consider this statutorily\n        required criterion. The Commission’s Order violates PURA § 36.064\n        and is the result of the Commission acting arbitrarily and through\n        unlawful procedure. ........................................................................................................ 20\nH.

Standards of Review\n\n          Several standards of review are implicated by the Commission’s Order and\n\neach, standing on its own, provides a sufficient basis for reversal. Contrary to the\n\nPUC’s and ETI’s focus on the substantial evidence standard, the Commission’s\n\nOrder is subject to reversal under additional standards of review listed under\n\nSection 2001.174 of the Administrative Procedure Act.1 The six standards of\n\nreview listed in Subsection 2001.174(2) offer independent grounds for reversal as\n\nevidenced by the use of the word “or” in the subsection. Texas law is clear that\n\nthese standards of review are separate and distinct. For instance, the Supreme\n\nCourt has expressly stated that “instances may arise in which the agency’s action\n\nis supported by substantial evidence, but is arbitrary and capricious nonetheless”\n\nand that the Legislature intended to “distinguish between agency action that is\n1\n    Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Tex.

APA Section 2001.174 is submitted as Appendix 2.\n3\n  Public Utility Regulatory Act, PURA, TEX. UTIL. CODE ANN. §§ 11.001-66.017. PURA Chapter 36,\nSubchapters A and B are submitted as Appendix 1.\n4\n  OPUC also notes that this standard of review is applicable to ETI’s “conditional cross point”\nbecause ETI’s challenge is procedural in nature, i.e., the exclusion from evidence of an exhibit.\n                                                 2\n\fstandard with the substantial evidence standard of review. The Commission\n\ncontends that under the arbitrary and capricious standard, “Courts must uphold a\n\nCommission decision if ‘some reasonable basis exists in the record for the action\n\ntaken by the agency.’”5 However, the quoted language from City of El Paso comes\n\nfrom the Court’s discussion of the substantial evidence standard, not the arbitrary\n\nand capricious standard of review. OPUC’s Appellant brief includes a discussion\n\non pages 37-39 as to how the Commission’s Order was arbitrary and capricious or\n\nresulting from an abuse of discretion in three of the four ways possible under the\n\narbitrary and capricious standard of review.6 Under the standards articulated in\n\nAPA § 2001.174, the Commission’s Order should be reversed and the case\n\nremanded for determination based upon the existing evidentiary record to\n\ndetermine rates consistent with the Court’s decision.\n\n\n\n\n5\n  PUC’s Brief of Appellee at 11, quoting City of El Paso v.

Either the Commission weighed the evidence and concluded that it was\n   not sufficient to allow a determination as to what portion of the storm\n   expenses were due to the negligent state of the Company’s system, or the\n   Commission did not weigh the evidence and decided not to address the\n   issue based upon the irrelevant factor of the passage of time. Either way,\n   the Commission committed reversible error by failing to hold ETI to its\n   burden of proof under PURA § 36.006 and allowing one hundred percent\n   of the $13,014,379 1997 storm restoration expenses to be included in the\n   storm reserve and reflected in rates.\n\n       In their respective Appellee’s briefs, ETI and the PUC focus on the evidence\n\npresented in the Commission proceeding related to the processes ETI went\n\nthrough in repairing damage and restoring service following the 1997 ice storm.\n\nTheir arguments focus on the “substantial evidence” supporting the Commission’s\n\ndecision to include one hundred percent of the 1997 storm restoration expenses\n\ninto the storm reserve reflected in rates, and assert that OPUC seeks to have the\n\nCourt reweigh the evidence to reach a different result. Their contention misses\n\nthe mark.      The weighing of the evidence was indisputably done during the\n\ncontested case by the Commission and the Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) who\n\nauthored the Proposal for Decision (PFD) adopted by the Commission. The result\n\nof their weighing of the evidence on the issue of what costs were caused by ETI’s\n\nnegligent, imprudent or deficient quality of service,7 is encapsulated in the\n\n\n7\n  The service quality deficiencies related to the costs at issue in this appeal included inadequate\ndistribution maintenance policies, inadequate vegetation management practices, distribution\npoles in poor condition or in need of comprehensive vegetation clearing, and inadequate pole\ninspection and repair work cycles. See Docket No. 18249, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. Service Quality\nIssues (Severed from Docket No. 16705), Order on Rehearing at 8-19 (Apr. 22, 1998); OPUC’s\n                                                4\n\fCommission-adopted PFD’s statement that, “[i]t is not feasible to accurately\n\ndetermine now what portion of ice storm damage that occurred 15 years ago was\n\ncaused by preventative maintenance issues.”8          With this statement, the\n\nCommission, through its adopted PFD, acknowledged the issue of what part of the\n\nstorm damage was caused by ETI, not solely by an Act of God, and not caused by\n\nratepayers. With this statement, the Commission also concluded its weighing of\n\nevidence on the issue, and found that with the evidence presented, it was not\n\n“feasible” to determine what portion was caused by the negligent state of the\n\nCompany’s preventative maintenance, including vegetation management.\n\n\n       Upon arriving at this conclusion, after having weighed the evidence on the\n\nissue, the Commission had to then decide what to do with the proposed\n\n$13,014,379 in 1997 ice storm costs. The Commission had several options, but one\n\noption it did not legally have was to allow the inclusion of the entire requested\n\n$13,014,379 in the storm reserve reflected in rates. When faced with no feasible\n\nway of determining what part was due to the Company’s action or inaction, the\n\nCommission had a duty under PURA § 36.006 to disallow the expenses. ETI had\n\nthe burden of proof on the issue and the Commission expressly stated that it could\n\nnot determine what portion was caused by the Company’s “preventative\n\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 5-7 (Submitted as Appendix 5).\n8\n  AR, Binder 5, Item No. 185, PFD at 56.\n                                             5\n\fmaintenance issues” that the Commission earlier had found to be a “major factor”\n\nin the outages and to have “greatly exacerbated” the extent of the damage.9 If the\n\nevidence cannot be shown to support the Company’s case, ETI fails to meet its\n\nburden of proof necessary to include the entirety of the 1997 storm expenses. The\n\nCommission committed reversible error by approving the inclusion of one\n\nhundred percent of the 1997 storm costs.\n\n\n        Alternatively, if the quoted passage from the Commission-adopted PFD is\n\nnot a determination based upon the weight of the evidence, then it should be\n\ninterpreted as discussed in OPUC’s Appellant’s Brief10 as a refusal, based on an\n\nirrelevant factor - the passage of time, to hold ETI to its burden to prove that\n\neither one hundred percent of the costs would have been incurred, regardless of\n\nthe state of the Company’s system at the time of the storm, or provide evidence on\n\nwhat portion should be disallowed. Contrary to the PUC’s implied argument,\n\nOPUC does not argue that the Company was required to break out, line by line,\n\neach imprudent cost. Rather, as noted in OPUC’s Appellant’s Brief, there were a\n\nvariety of ways available to the Company in which to propose an appropriate\n\ndivision between the costs that would have occurred regardless of the state of its\n\n\n9\n  Entergy Gulf States, Inc. Service Quality Issues (Severed from Docket No. 16705), Docket No. 18249, Order\non Rehearing at 18-19 and 47, FoF No. 97 (Apr. 22, 1998) (Submitted as Appendix 4)\n(Hereinafter, “Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing”).\n10\n   OPUC’s Appellant’s Brief at 25-27, 31-32, 38.\n                                                       6\n\fsystem, and what was actually incurred. The Company did not, and it was error to\n\nallow the entirety of the $13,014,379 in the storm reserve and rates. Likewise,\n\nOPUC does not contend that the Company had to disallow all or require a line by\n\nline accounting.     Instead, as discussed in OPUC’s Appellant’s Brief,11 if the\n\nCommission wished to grant the inclusion of the prudent portion of the costs, the\n\nCommission had multiple options available to it, including but not limited to\n\nusing a third party review and basing a disallowance on the third party report, or\n\nremanding the case back to SOAH for further evidence in a supplemental hearing\n\nphase. However, the one option not legally available to the Commission was the\n\npath the Commission chose to take. If, as argued in the PUC’s Appellee’s Brief,\n\nthe Commission did weigh the evidence, it concluded that there was not sufficient\n\nevidence to allow a determination as to what portion of the storm expenses were\n\ndue to the negligent state of the Company’s system. On the other hand, if the\n\nCommission did not weigh the evidence and refused to address the issue based\n\nupon the passage of time, Commission considered an irrelevant factor. Either way,\n\nthe Commission committed reversible error by failing to hold ETI to its burden of\n\nproof under PURA § 36.006 by including unreasonable, unnecessary and\n\nimprudent costs in the storm reserve reflected in rates.\n\n\n\n\n11\n     Id. at 18-19.\n                                        7\n\fC. Indisputably, the issue of determining what amount of 1997 storm\n   restoration expenses was prudent, appropriate, and includable in the\n   storm reserve and rates was an issue to be decided in Docket No. 39896.\n   That fact does not render the Commission’s Orders in Docket Nos. 18249\n   and 16705 irrelevant or properly disregarded.\n\n       At various points in their respective briefs, Appellees ETI and PUC allege\n\nthat OPUC contends that the prudence of these storm restoration expenses was\n\ndecided in Docket No. 18249.             The Appellees’ briefs minimized what the\n\nCommission stated in Docket No. 18249; however, the Commission in its Order in\n\nthat docket does not mince words. The Commission expressly stated that a\n\n“major cause of the outages during the storm” were trees overhanging wires.12 The\n\nCommission also stated “[t]ree limbs in ROW overhanging distribution lines pose\n\na threat to system reliability, and are largely within EGS’ control.”13                    The\n\nCommission continued and stated that the “Company’s failure to clear the limbs\n\nbefore the storm was a major factor in the number and duration of outages\n\nexperienced by customers” and that “vegetation management failures greatly\n\naggravated the situation.”14 The Commission wasn’t done discussing how ETI’s\n\nnegligent or poor quality of service impacted the extent of the storm damage. The\n\nCommission found that the “impact of the January 1997 ice storm was greatly\n\nexacerbated by the Company’s failure to maintain its ROW clear of excessive\n12\n   Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing at 18-19.\n13\n   Id. at 18-19 (emphasis added). “EGS” is Entergy Gulf States, Inc., the predecessor to ETI and\nwas the name the Company operated under during Docket Nos. 16705 and 18249.\n14\n   Id. at 18-19 (emphasis added).\n                                             8\n\fvegetation.”15 These statements very clearly address the cause of a portion of the\n\ndamages which ETI was obligated to repair and restore. ETI presented testimony\n\nthrough its witness Shawn Corkran on the processes ETI used in repairing and\n\nrestoring the system. While the issue of the prudence of the $13,014,379 in\n\nrestoration costs and the question of their inclusion in the storm reserve was not at\n\nissue in Docket No. 18249, the Commission did make a determination that impacts\n\nthe prudence review of those costs in this case; the Commission in Docket\n\nNo. 39896 was not free to disregard the finding in its prior order that a portion of\n\nthe storm damage for which the restoration expenses were incurred was caused by\n\nthe Company’s unacceptable actions or inactions. Likewise, once the Commission\n\nmade its findings that the Company was responsible for greatly exacerbating the\n\ndamage, ETI knew or should have known that it must address the issue when\n\npresenting its storm restoration costs for inclusion in the storm reserve and rates.\n\n\n          The Commission’s Order in Docket No. 16705 also made it clear that the\n\nissue of what amount of 1997 storm restoration costs are properly includable in the\n\nstorm reserve and reflected in rates remained in Docket No. 16705 and was not\n\nsevered into the separate quality of service docket, Docket No. 18249. The final\n\norder (Second Order on Rehearing) in Docket No. 16705 very plainly shows that\n\nthe Commission considered the Company’s proposal to include a post-test-year\n15\n     Id. at FoF No. 97.\n                                        9\n\fadjustment for the January 1997 ice storm expenses. The Docket No. 16705 final\n\norder, which was issued after Docket No. 18249’s final order, stated in pertinent\n\npart in Finding of Fact No. 147 that, “EGS did not prove a reasonable post-test\n\nyear level for its existing reserve fund or that the amount expended in 1997 to\n\nreduce the fund was prudent or appropriate.”16 The Commission continued and\n\nexpressed its intent for the issue to be addressed in the Company’s next rate case:\n\n“Reserve fund levels following the test year in this case can be addressed in EGS’\n\nNovember 1998 rate filing when all parties will have the opportunity to evaluate\n\nthe reasonableness of changes to the reserve fund.” Clearly, the Commission’s\n\nDocket No. 16705 final order anticipated that the issue of what amount of 1997 ice\n\nstorm costs was prudent and appropriate and includable in the storm reserve fund\n\nwould be addressed in the next rate case. Docket No. 39896 was the next fully\n\nlitigated rate case and the first opportunity to give effect to Docket No. 16705’s\n\nexpectation and address the prudence of including the 1997 storm costs in the\n\nCompany’s storm reserve reflected in rates. On this issue, the parties in Docket\n\nNo. 39896 effectively stood in the same position as if it was November 1998, and it\n\nwas error for the Commission to treat the issue, and the parties, as if it were\n\notherwise.\n\n\n16\n  Application of Entergy Texas for Approval of its Transition to Competition Plan and the Tariffs Implementing\nthe Plan, and for the Authority to Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705, Second Order on Rehearing\n(Oct. 14, 1998) (An excerpt of this order is submitted as Appendix 5).\n                                                    10\n\fD. The Commission inappropriately focused on only one aspect of the\n   prudence question and ignored the genesis of the expenses.\n\n       ETI did not address the issue of what amount of 1997 ice storm costs was\n\nprudent and appropriate and includable in the storm reserve fund, despite the\n\nCommission’s prior findings that the Company caused much of the damage.\n\nInstead, ETI presented its case on the 1997 storm restoration costs as if the damage\n\nand the resulting restoration costs were incurred in a business as usual manner.\n\nETI presented testimony on its storm preparation and processes in general to\n\nsupport its requested storm costs for the entire period of 1996-2011, including\n\ntestimony about practices that were put into place in 1998 and thereafter; ETI also\n\noffered the rebuttal testimony of Shawn Corkran to specifically address how the\n\n1997 ice storm restoration process was carried out, including what damage was\n\nrepaired and restored. However, none of this evidence went to the issue of what\n\namount of the damage and resulting costs were due to the “preventative\n\nmaintenance” issues or negligent state of the Company’s system.17\n\n\n\n17\n  The PUC asserts on pages 27-29 of its Appellee’s Brief that substantial evidence supports the\ninclusion of the expenses. However, the evidence cited by the PUC goes to the undisputed fact\nthat once the system was damaged and down, it needed to be restored and repaired. OPUC does\nnot dispute that the clean-up process was done properly; however, it is not the sole issue to be\nconsidered when determining what amount of the 1997 ice storm restoration costs are\nincludable in the storm reserve and rates. Nor can the evidence cited by the PUC in its brief be\nconstrued to be evidence on the question at issue, given Mr. Corkran’s statement that he was\nunaware of any attempt by the Company to identify or quantify the portion of damage and\nexpenses related to the poor vegetation management.

The transcript of Mr. Corkran’s cross-examination is submitted as Appendix 6.\n                                             11\n\f          Proof that ETI did not present evidence on the issue is found in the\n\nadmission by ETI’s expert witness, Shawn Corkran during cross-examination\n\nduring the hearing on the merits in Docket No. 39896. Asked if the Company had\n\nidentified or quantified the level of expenses attributable to ETI’s negligence, Mr.\n\nCorkran stated that he is not aware of any attempt by the Company to try and\n\nquantify which costs or how much were attributable to the Company’s poor\n\nvegetation management.18 Under PURA § 36.006, the Company holds the burden\n\nof proof and it was error for the Commission to include the entirety of the\n\n$13,014,379 in 1997 Storm Restoration costs in the storm reserve based upon the\n\nexisting evidentiary record. It was not feasible, based upon the case presented by\n\nthe Company, to determine what portion of the $13,014,379 was due to the\n\nexacerbated level of damage and what portion would have been incurred\n\nregardless. The Company failed to carry its burden of proof that would allow the\n\nCommission to legally find that the entire amount is properly included in the\n\nstorm reserves and rates.\n\n\n\n\n18\n     AR, Binder 53, Vol. D, Transcript at 579:15-19.\n                                                 12\n\fE. The 60-basis-point reduction to the Company’s return on equity assessed\n   in Docket No. 18249 was not intended to be in lieu of identifying and\n   accounting for the portion of the cost of cleaning up and repairing the\n   damage caused by the Company’s imprudent vegetation management. The\n   Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously by considering this\n   irrelevant factor and including the entirety of the $13,014,379 in ETI’s\n   storm reserve reflected in rates.\n\n       As noted in OPUC’s Appellant’s brief, the Commission imposed a 60-basis-\n\npoint reduction in Docket No. 18249 pursuant to PURA § 36.062 expressly\n\nintended to reflect the poor level of service provided by the Company, to\n\nincentivize the Company to improve its service quality, and to provide the\n\nratepayers a remedy for such things as billing rate error and call center response\n\ntime.19 As acknowledged by ETI during the hearing on the merits in Docket No.\n\n39896, the 60 basis point reduction levied in Docket No. 18249 was used by the\n\nCommission as part of an incentive plan created to help the Company achieve\n\nmuch needed service quality improvements.20\n\n       Moreover, the Company’s quality of service was a statutorily required\n\nconsideration under PURA § 36.062 when determining the Company’s return on\n\nequity (ROE). The 60-basis-point reduction was more of a penalty in nature and\n\nwas not intended to be a cure-all for the attendant impacts of the poor service.\n19\n   See Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing at 1-2; See also Id. at 28-29, 35 and Ordering\nParagraph 8.\n20\n   AR, Vol. D, Transcript at 570:22-572:2; See Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing at 28 and\n28-31. The plan also allowed the Company the opportunity to “earn back” some of its basis point\nreduction going forward, if it met certain specific performance targets. Id. at 29.\n                                              13\n\fSpecifically, contrary to the statement on page 57 of the Commission-adopted PFD\n\nand the Appellees’ argument, the 60 basis point reduction was not intended as a\n\nremedy in whole or in part for the extra restoration costs the Company expended\n\nin cleaning up the exacerbated damage caused by the imprudent state of its\n\nsystem.\n\n           First, the issue of the recovery of the 1997 storm restoration costs through\n\nthe storm reserve was not one of the issued severed out of Docket No. 16705 into\n\nDocket No. 18249.21 Therefore, the issue was not before the Commission at the\n\ntime it assessed the 60 basis point penalty. Second, the Order in Docket No. 16705\n\nwas issued six months after the Order in Docket 18249 in which the Commission\n\nordered the 60-basis-point reduction. The Commission was clearly aware of its\n\nown order reducing the Company’s ROE and yet, the above-quoted Finding of\n\nFact No. 147 from the later order clearly indicates that the Commission anticipated\n\nthat the prudence, propriety and reasonableness of the 1997 storm costs and their\n\ninclusion in the storm reserve would be litigated in a future rate case. The\n\nCommission would not have made such a finding if it considered any imprudence\n\nto have been remedied by the 60-basis-point reduction.\n\n           The PUC and ETI seem to be arguing that the 60-basis-point reduction\n\n\n21\n     Id. at 2-3.\n                                           14\n\ftrumps the regulatory and statutory requirements that storm costs included in the\n\nplan be “reasonable and necessary” and “not reasonably anticipated.”22 Such an\n\nargument is without merit and contrary to law. Reducing the Company’s ROE\n\nunder PURA § 36.062 does not absolve the Company or the Commission from\n\nPURA’s requirements that imprudent costs not be charged to ratepayers. Nor\n\ndoes the reduction to the ROE convert unreasonable costs into reasonable costs,\n\nand anticipated costs into unanticipated costs.                  The requirement in\n\nPURA § 36.062 that the Commission address the Company’s service quality when\n\nsetting its ROE does not negate the statutory requirement that only reasonable\n\nand necessary expenses be charged to ratepayers under PURA § 36.051 and\n\n36.064.23 Courts “should not give one provision a meaning out of harmony or\n\ninconsistent with other provisions, although it might be susceptible to such a\n\nconstruction standing alone.”24       Courts must “presume that the Legislature\n\nintends an entire statute to be effective and that a just and reasonable result is\n\nintended.”25\n\n      Although PURA § 36.052 authorizes the Commission to take the quality\n\nof a utility's services into     account in establishing a reasonable return, the\n\n\n22\n    PURA §§ 36.051 and 36.064; 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 25.231(b)(2)(J). Rule 25.231(b) is\nsubmitted as Appendix 3.\n23\n   See 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 25.231(b)(2)(J).\n24\n   Helena Chem. Co. v.

In other words, a penalty imposed upon a utility's\n\nauthorized return for poor service quality should not be viewed as a license to\n\npermit the utility to now charge customers for the portion of the damages\n\nresulting from the Company's poor service quality.26                          The end result of the\n\nCommission's decision is that unreasonable and unnecessary expenses are being\n\ncharged to customers through the storm reserve and rates. The Commission’s\n\nOrder violates PURA, is arbitrary and capricious and is affected by other error of\n\nlaw.\n\nF. The Commission erred in approving the recovery of imprudent costs.\n\n        The PUC in its Appellee’s Brief asserts that a utility is not obligated to carve\n\nout imprudence from its request, and specifically, that ETI was not obligated to\n\nidentify the portion of its requested storm expenses that were due to the\n\nexacerbated damage caused by its imprudent system management.                                         These\n\ncontentions are incorrect. First, it is indisputably the Company’s burden to prove\n\neach element of its case, including the reasonableness and necessity of including\n\n\n\n26\n   Application of Entergy Texas for Approval of its Transition to Competition Plan and the Tariff Implementing\nthe Plan, and for the Authority to Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705, Second Order on Rehearing at\nFoF No. 147.\n\n                                                   16\n\frestoration costs into the storm reserve.27 Imprudent costs are neither reasonable\n\nnor necessary; imprudently incurred costs may not be recovered in the utility’s\n\nbase rates.28 Moreover, prudence is a statutorily required criterion.29 The utility\n\nbears the burden of proving the prudence of costs it seeks to recover, and if some\n\nbut not all of the requested costs are imprudent, the imprudent costs must be\n\nremoved either by separating them out, adopting another reasonable method to\n\naccount for the imprudence, or disallowing the intermingled requested costs.30 In\n\nthe 1992 City of El Paso decision, the court addressed a case in which imprudence\n\nhad been found. The court stated that the Commission should “generally disallow\n\nproject costs to the extent of the imprudence.”31 The court continued, stating that\n\na “determination that an expenditure is imprudent carries the legal consequence of\n\nits exclusion from rate base” and that prudence question “embodies one of the\n\n\n\n\n27\n   PURA §§ 36.006, 36.051 and 36.064.\n28\n   See Entergy Gulf States, Inc. v.

In\n\nTexas Utilities Electric Company, the Texas Third Court of Appeals found that, where\n\na portion of the utility’s $537.90 million in costs for the Comanche Peak nuclear\n\nproject were imprudently incurred, the Commission acted properly in disallowing\n\nsome but not all of the costs due to imprudence.33 In the originating Commission\n\ndocket, the utility had argued that all of its Comanche Peak costs were prudently\n\nincurred, while intervening parties had argued that the costs should be disallowed\n\nentirely, line by line.34 The Commission had then brought in a third party to\n\nevaluate the prudence of the costs. The court rejected the contention that if the\n\nCommission were to disallow some but not all of the costs, it must require a\n\ndetailed breakdown.            Instead of doing so, based upon the third party\n\nrecommendation, the Commission disallowed part of the costs because they were\n\nimprudent but allowed other costs.35 In particular, the Commission made a $90.5\n\nmillion disallowance for the response team, a $79.9 million disallowance related to\n\nthe corrective action program, plus other disallowances due to delays in licensing,\n\n\n32\n   Id.\n33\n   Texas Utilities Electric Company v.

Finding of Fact 97 from PUC Docket No. 18249 provided the\n\nCommission with the starting point in its decision-making process, and it was the\n\nCommission’s job at that point to either deny ETI’s requested 1997 storm expenses\n36\n   Id. at 404-405.

Consequently, the imprudent\n\ncosts became part of the approved rates through their inclusion in the storm\n\nreserve.\n\nG. Some of ETI’s storm costs were “reasonably anticipated,” and it was\n   reversible error for the Commission to fail to consider this statutorily\n   required criterion. The Commission’s Order violates PURA § 36.064 and is\n   the result of the Commission acting arbitrarily and through unlawful\n   procedure.\n\n       PURA Section 36.064 allows storm costs to be included in a self-insurance\n\nplan to the extent they are “not reasonably anticipated.”                   PURA Subsection\n\n36.064(a) states that, an electric utility “may self-insure all or part of the utility's\n\npotential liability or catastrophic property loss, including windstorm, fire, and\n\nexplosion losses, that could not have been reasonably anticipated and included\n\nunder operating and maintenance expenses.”39 In a prior Commission Order in\n\n38\n  Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing at 47, FoF No. 97.\n39\n  The Commission’s substantive rule on self-insurance plans, 16 Tex. Admin. Code\n§ 25.231(b)(1)(G), states in pertinent part: “The reserve accounts are to be charged with\n                                               20\n\fDocket No. 18249, the Commission found that the damage resulting from the 1997\n\nice storm was much greater than it would otherwise have been due to the\n\nCompany’s imprudent vegetation management.                  Vegetation management is a\n\nprogram designed to keep the rights of way surrounding power lines clear; the\n\nvery purpose of vegetation management is to anticipate and prevent or mitigate\n\nstorm damage and outages in bad weather.40 The Commission’s Order in Docket\n\nNo. 39896 fails to demonstrate that the Commission considered the imprudent\n\ngenesis of the storm damage and the fact that much of the damage and\n\ncorresponding expenses were reasonably anticipated and preventable.\n\n       Both the PUC and ETI defend the Commission’s order by claiming that the\n\n“not reasonably anticipated” requirement for inclusion of storm costs in the self-\n\ninsurance reserve and rates was considered by the Commission either because the\n\nPFD mentioned a witness’s discussion of the severity of the storm or because a\n\nsingle Q&A that appeared in another witness’s rebuttal testimony said so (despite\n\nnot being cited in the PFD or Order). Neither contention even if read in the best\n\nlight would be sufficient. The “not reasonably anticipated” requirement is a\n\nstatutorily required consideration that requires support by underlying findings of\n\n\n\nproperty and liability losses which occur, and which could not have been reasonably anticipated\nand included in operating and maintenance expenses, and are not paid or reimbursed by\ncommercial insurance.”\t\t\t\n40\n   Docket No. 18249 Order on Rehearing at 14.\t\n                                              21\n\ffact in order to show that the Commission properly gave consideration to the\n\nstatutorily required criterion.41 It is not enough to merely infer consideration\n\nthrough other findings of fact or statements; clear, specific findings are required in\n\norder to prove that the Commission fulfilled its duty under the statute.42                     The\n\nCourt in Charter Medical explained that underlying findings of fact have\n\n“substantial statutory purpose” and serve to “restrain any disposition on the part\n\nof the agency to grant [a certificate] without a full consideration of the evidence\n\nand a serious appraisal of the facts.”43 Such findings of fact also serve to inform the\n\nparties and the courts of the basis for the agency's decision so that the parties may\n\nintelligently prepare an appeal and so that the courts may properly exercise their\n\nfunction of review.44\n\n       The Commission’s Order fails to show the statutorily required\n\nconsideration that storm costs included in the self-insurance plan only be those\n\n“that could not have been reasonably anticipated,” and further fails to provide\n\nunderlying findings, either in the findings of fact or in the body of the Order, that\n\nconstitute material basic facts that relate to the statutory finding of “not\n\nreasonably anticipated.”         The failure to include underlying findings of fact to\n\n41\n   See Texas Health Facilities Comm’n v.

Texas courts will reverse\n\nan agency order when underlying fact findings are legally insufficient.45\n\nAdditionally, the omission of an ultimate finding (or statutorily required criteria)\n\nwhen underlying findings are absent violates PURA § 36.064, APA § 2001.141(b), is\n\narbitrary and capricious, and the resulting order is made through unlawful\n\nprocedure.      An expressly stated factor in determining whether the agency’s\n\ndecision is arbitrary or results from an abuse of discretion is whether the agency\n\n“failed to consider a factor the Legislature directs it to consider.”46\n\n       Finally, the Commission’s own regulation, 16 Tex. Admin. Code\n\n§ 25.231(b)(1)(G), requires that only those property and liability losses which\n\ncould not have been reasonably anticipated may be included in the self-insurance\n\nplan. Failing to give effect to its own unambiguous regulation is reversible as\n\nother error of law and is also arbitrary and capricious. This Court has stated that\n\nan agency decision is arbitrary when its final order “fails to demonstrate a\n\nconnection between the agency decision and the factors that are made relevant to\n\n\n\n45\n   See Texas Health Facilities Comm’n v.

See AR, Binder 43, Vol.\nK, Transcript at 1705-1706.\n                                              25\n\fcriminal case wherein the Dallas Court of Appeals held that a party does not have\n\nto exercise optional completeness at the time the document being “completed” is\n\nadmitted; a party can wait until “cross-examination, or during the development of\n\n[its] own case.”53 However, there is a difference between having the right to\n\nexercise    optional      completeness       later   in    the    proceeding      rather     than\n\ncontemporaneously with the document being completed, and failing to reserve the\n\nright to do so later. The “permissive grant” language quoted by ETI deals with the\n\nfact that Appellant in Gilmore had argued that the language of Rule 107 of the Texas\n\nRules of Evidence required the court to admit the complete document\n\nimmediately.54\n\n       SOAH ALJs have been charged with the duty to conduct the contested case\n\nhearing on the merits when referred from the Commission.55 When the SOAH\n\nALJ acts as the presiding officer, he has “broad discretion in conducting the course,\n\nconduct, and scope of the hearing,” including the power to “rule upon the\n\nadmissibility of evidence and amendments to pleadings.”56 When conducting\n\nhearings referred from the Commission, it is the established practice that parties\n\nare required to reserve the right of optional completeness if not exercising it\n\n53\n   Gilmore v.

In the\n\ncase below, Docket No. 39896, ETI itself “reserved” optional completeness nine\n\ntimes over the course of the hearing on the merits and exercised that right once.57\n\nNotably, seven of the times the Company reserved optional completeness for later\n\nadmission occurred prior to the ALJ’s ruling on the spreadsheet. ETI knew what\n\nwas required to exercise optional completeness in a PUC case at SOAH and\n\ncannot properly complain now that the spreadsheet’s exclusion from evidence was\n\nerror.\n\n         Further, the purpose behind optional completeness would not apply to the\n\nspreadsheet and OPUC Exhibit No. 6. The purpose behind the rule of optional\n\ncompleteness is “to reduce the possibility of the fact finder receiving a false\n\nimpression from hearing the evidence of only a part of a writing.”58 There are two\n\nthreshold requirements to invoke the rule of optional completeness: (1) an\n\nincomplete statement was introduced into evidence, and (2) the party offering the\n\n57\n   ETI reserved optional completeness on the following exhibits: Cities Exhibit No. 7\n(Transcript (Tr.) at 69, ll. 1-2); TIEC Exhibit No. 9 (Tr. at 183, ll. 17-21); OPUC Exhibit No. 10\n(Tr. at 282, l. 21-283, l. 1); Cities Exhibit No. 41 (Tr. at 968, ll.14-17); Cities Exhibit No. 43A (Tr.\nat 1456, ll. 4-5 and 15-20); Cities Exhibit No. 43B (Tr. at 1456, l. 21-1457, l.4); Cities Exhibit No.\n48 (Tr. at 2082, ll. 19-22); and OPUC Exhibit No. 35 (Tr. at 2095, ll. 1-25). ETI exercised its\nreserved right to optional completeness as ETI Exhibit No. 98 (Tr. at 1505, l. 16- 1507, l. 15).\nCities also reserved optional completeness on one ETI Exhibit (ETI Exhibit No. 83, Tr. at 1190, l.\n22-1191, l. 5) and exercised that reservation as Cities Exhibit No. 49 (Tr. at 1686, l. 15-1687, l. 7).\nThese transcripts are found in the Administrative Record in Binder 43, Volumes B, C, F, G, I, K,\nand M, and the cited excerpts are submitted here as Appendix 7.\n58\n   Gilmore v.

Minyard Foods, the Dallas\n\nCourt of Appeals found that the Defendant, Minyard Food Stores, may have\n\nsatisfied the first requirement but failed to meet the second. The court concluded\n\nthat, “Minyard clearly failed to meet the second requirement. . . . Minyard has\n\nmade no attempt to show how Rayshell's testimony could have confused or misled\n\nthe jury regarding the contents of Kern's affidavit or its meaning. . . . [T]he trial\n\ncourt erred in admitting the document.”60 Like in Crosby, admitting the remainder\n\nof the writing (here, the spreadsheet) would not serve to correct any false\n\nimpression or otherwise add to the Commission’s understanding. The five-page\n\nexcerpt was included as part of OPUC’s testimony to illustrate the naked\n\ngranularity of the data.       Five pages of line-by-line accounting entries paint the\n\npicture with sufficient clarity. Since the accuracy of the entries was not in\n\ndispute, “completing” the spreadsheet with the remaining 415 pages would not\n\nserve the purpose for which the optional completeness rule was intended to\n\naddress.\n\n\n\n\n59\n   Crosby v.

Title 2 of the code is properly cited as the Public\nUtility Regulatory Act.\n\n       This edition of the Public Utility Regulatory Act contains amendments adopted through\nthe 83rd Legislature, Third Called Session.\n\n        In general, the effect of amendments has been clear and the resulting text changes were\nstraightforward and did not require any editorial discretion. Except as explained below, editorial\ndiscretion was exercised in reconciling multiple amendments to the same section. In the majority\nof these cases, there was no irreconcilable conflict and all of the amendments could be given\neffect. In some cases, an act expressly amended a provision as added or amended by another act.\nIn the few cases where an irreconcilable conflict was found, the act with the later date of\nenactment was given effect, with the other provisions italicized below. In addition, a note\nexplaining the conflict is provided following the section annotation.\n\n        The annotations following each section have two components. The first annotation\nshows the derivation of the section, either citing to the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1995\n(V.A.C.S. Art. 1446c-O), Acts 1997, ch. 166, or showing the section as added to the code and\nciting the relevant act. The second component identifies subsequent amendments, cites the\namending act (and originating bill), provides a brief summary of each of the amendments, and,\nwhere appropriate, provides a reference to related provisions or material.\n\n       This publication is maintained by the Commission Advising and Docket Management\nDivision of the Public Utility Commission of Texas. Suggestions or corrections may be\nsubmitted to that division.\n\f                                           CHAPTER 36. RATES\n\n                            SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSec. 36.001. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH AND REGULATE RATES.\n    (a) The regulatory authority may establish and regulate rates of an electric utility and may adopt\nrules for determining:\n      ( 1)   the classification of customers and services; and\n      (2)    the applicability of rates.\n   (b) A rule or order of the regulatory authority may not conflict with a ruling of a federal regulatory\nbody.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-0, Sec. 2.201.)\nSec. 36.002. COMPLIANCE WITH TITLE.\n   An electric utility may not charge or receive a rate for utility service except as provided by this title.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-O, Sec. 2.153 (part).)\nSec. 36.003. JUST AND REASONABLE RATES.\n    (a) The regulatory authority shall ensure that each rate an electric utility or two or more electric\nutilities jointly make, demand, or receive is just and reasonable.\n   (b) A rate may not be unreasonably preferential, prejudicial, or discriminatory but must be sufficient,\nequitable, and consistent in application to each class of consumer.\n   (c) An electric utility may not:\n      (1) grant an unreasonable preference or advantage concerning rates to a person in a\n   classification;\n       (2) subject a person in a classification to an unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage concerning\n   rates; or\n      (3) establish or maintain an unreasonable difference concerning rates between localities or\n   between classes of service.\n  (d) In establishing an electric utility's rates, the commission may treat as a single class two or more\nmunicipalities that an electric utility serves if the commission considers that treatment to be appropriate.\n    (e) A charge to an individual customer for retail or wholesale electric service that is less than the\nrate approved by the regulatory authority does not constitute an impermissible difference, preference, or\nadvantage.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-0, Sees. 2.202, 2.214 (part).)\nSec. 36.004. EQUALITY OF RATES AND SERVICES.\n   (a) An electric utility may not directly or indirectly charge, demand, or receive from a person a\ngreater or lesser compensation for a service provided or to be provided by the utility than the\ncompensation prescribed by the applicable tariff filed under Section 32.101.\n  (b) A person may not knowingly receive or accept a service from an electric utility for a\ncompensation greater or less than the compensation prescribed by the tariff.\n    (c) Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (b), an electric utility may charge an individual customer\nfor wholesale or retail electric service in accordance with Section 36.007.\n\n\n                                                         79\n\f   (d) This title does not prevent a cooperative corporation from returning to its members net earnings\nresulting from its operations in proportion to the members' purchases from or through the corporation.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-O, Sees. 2.215(a), (b).)\nSec. 36.005. RATES FOR AREA NOT IN MUNICIPALITY.\n   Without the approval of the commission, an electric utility's rates for an area not in a municipality\nmay not exceed 115 percent of the average of all rates for similar services for all municipalities served by\nthe same utility in the same county as that area.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-O, Sec. 2.213.)\nSec. 36.006. BURDEN OF PROOF ..\n   In a proceeding involving a proposed rate change, the electric utility has the burden of proving that:\n       (1)   the rate change is just and reasonable, if the utility proposes the change; or\n       (2)   an existing rate is just and reasonable, if the proposal is to reduce the rate.\n   (V.A.C.S. art. 1446c-O, Sec. 2.204.)\nSec. 36.007. DISCOUNTED WHOLESALE OR RETAIL RATES.\n    (a) On application by an electric utility, a regulatory authority may approve wholesale or retail\ntariffs or contracts containing charges that are less than rates approved by the regulatory authority but not\nless than the utility's marginal cost. The charges must be in accordance with the principles of this title\nand may not be unreasonably preferential, prejudicial, discriminatory, predatory, or anticompetitive.\n   (b) The method for computing the marginal cost of the electric utility consists of energy and capacity\ncomponents. The energy component includes variable operation and maintenance expense and marginal\nfuel or the energy component of purchased power.

(EGS or the Company). The Commission concludes that the quality of EGS'\nelectric service to its customers in Texas has been less than adequate, specifically sin9e\nEntergy Corporation acquired Gulf States Utilities, Inc., in 1993. The record evidence\nreveals a lack of effective and prudent maintenance policies, uneven spending in the area\nof operations and maintenance (O&M), cuts in experienced personnel, and consequent\ndeterioration in the quality of service. The management of EGS is structured in a way\nthat fails to link resource availability with appropriate performance accountability.\n\n\n           The Commission further concludes that the difficulties EGS has experienced with\nits quality of service are not simply \"customer perception\" problems, as claimed by the\nCompany. 1 The problems are real and must be addressed by the Company in a timely\nand serious manner.             To motivate the Company to revise its current approach and\npromote long-term commitment toward service quality and reliability, the Commission\norders a two-part solution designed both to deal with past problems and implement\nremedies for the future. First, the Company's authorized return on equity (ROE) that\notherwise would be adopted in Docket No. 16705 2 will be reduced by 60-basis points and\ninitially refunded to distribution-level customers. Second, going forward, the Company\n\n1\n    EGS Initial Brief (IB) at 4 (Dec. 2, 1997); see also, Tr. at 231.\n\n2\n  Application of Entergy Texas for Approval of Its Transition to Competition Plan and the Tariffs\nImplementing the Plan, and for the Auth~rity to Reconcile Fuel Costs, to Set Revised Fuel Costs, to Set\nRevised Fuel Factors, and to Recover a Surcharge for Underrecovered Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705\n(pending).\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                              Page2\n\n\nwill have an opportunity to earn back a portion of the ROE reduction, depending on\nwhether its service quality meets specified benchmarks. These benchmarks will establish\nservice reliability standards (outage frequency and duration) and customer service\nstandards (billing errors, call-center performance, service installation, line extension, and\nstreet light replacement). The margin achieved above the benchmarks will reflect the\nlevel of improvement (or, if below, a lack thereof) and will be used to determine whether\nthe Company is entitled to recoup a portion of the ROE reduction.\n\n\n\n\n                                      I.          Procedural History\n\n\n          EGS filed its transition/rate case in Docket No. 16705 on November 27, 1996.\nThe Commission referred the case to the State Office of Administrative Hearings\n(SOAH) on December 5, 1996.                  On January 24, 1997, the Commission issued a\npreliminary order in Docket No. 16705 directing parties, among other things, to \"address\nspecific service quality standards that will apply after the transition [proposed by EGS].\"3\n\n\n          On March 7, 1997, the Commission issued a supplemental preliminary order in\nDocket No. 16705 that dealt specifically with service quality issues. This order required\nthat Docket No. 16705 address, in addition to others, the following issues: (1) Does EGS\nhave an effective and prudent management policy in place that devotes sufficient\nresources to ensure adequate and reliable service to its ratepayers? (2) Are there patterns\nof variable service quality in EGS' service territory, and if so, what is the cause and\npotential resolution of these variations? and (3) What procedures can and should the\nCommission implement to monitor service quality on EGS' system, and to respond to\nsituations in which EGS' service quality falls below the service quality benchmark\nlevels?\n\n\n\n3\n    Preliminary Order at 12 (January 24, 1997).\n\f    PUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                 Page3\n\n         Proceeding with EGS' rate case, SOAH established a four-phased hearing\nschedule to address the numerous transition and rate issues in Docket No. 16705. The\nservice quality issues were to be dealt with in the \"Competitive Issues\" phase, scheduled\nto begin in early November 1997.\n\n\n        After EGS and interested parties had filed written testimony and exhibits, 4 but\nbefore the Competitive Issues phase commenced at SOAH, the Commission determined\nthat it would itselfhear and resolve the service quality issues. Accordingly, on November\n4, 1997, the Commission issued an order severing the pending service quality issues from\nDocket No. 16705, establishing Docket No. 18249 to deal with those issues, and\nestablishing procedures by which the Commission would hear and rule on the case.\n\n\n        The Commission convened a hearing on the merits of EGS' service quality on\nNovember 20 and 21, 1997.            Chairman Pat Wood and Commissioner Judy Walsh\npresided over the hearing. The participating parties included the Company, the Cities, the\nHigh Load Factor Commercial Customer Group (HLFCCG), and the General Counsel, all\nof whom presented their direct cases and conducted cross-examinations. Chairman Wood\nand Commissioner Walsh also directed questions to the witnesses. Observers from the\nOffice of Public Utility Counsel (OPUC) and the Attorney General's Office attended the\nhearing. The active parties filed initial and reply briefs on December 2 and 9, 1997,\nrespectively. OPUC filed a statement on December 2, 1997, supporting the briefs of the\nCities and HLFCCG, and the Attorney General's Office filed a statement on December 9,\n1997, in support of the same briefs.\n\n\n        The Commission issued the final order in this docket on February 13, 1998. On\nMarch 5, 1998, EGS and General Counsel filed motions for rehearing. The replies to the\nmotions were due on March 16, 1998, but based on parties' request, the Commission\n\n\n4\n  Some of the testimony, particularly from the Company's witnesses, was originally pre-filed for the\nRevenue Requirement phase.\n\f    PUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                  Page4\n\n\ngranted an extension for filing of replies until March 25, 1998. On March 19, 1998, the\nCommission ratified the extension of deadline to file replies and also extended until May\n    14, 1998, the time to rule on the motions for rehearing pursuant to Gov'T CODE\n2001.146(e).\n\n\n           On March 25, 1998, the parties filed a joint reply to motions for rehearing and\nmotion for entry of order consistent with the parties' stipulation and agreement (the\nStipulation).

The EGS service territory in Texas is located in the southeastern part of the\nstate, and contains industrialized areas in the vicinity of Beaumont and Port Arthur, as\nwell as a coastal zone.            The differing geographic and climatic characteristics of the\nCompany's service territory have led to the creation of three distinct sectors: Western I\n(suburban with dense trees), Western II (rural with fewer trees), and Gulf (both rural and\nurban).\n\n\n            Entergy's headquarters is in New Orleans; EGS' principal office in Texas is\nlocated in Beaumont. In Texas, the Company serves approximately 318,279 customers8\n                                                                                       9\nand has 11,472 miles of distribution lines.

Discussion and Analysis of Issues\n\n\nA. General Concept of Reliability\n\n\n           Electricity plays a vital role in our lives. Most, if not all, aspects of our society,\nincluding industrial production, commerce, and individual lifestyles, are built around a\nreliable and adequate supply of electrical energy.                  People have come to depend on\n\n7\n  Entergy Arkansas (including the Arklahoma Corporation), Inc., Entergy Louisiana, Inc., Entergy\nMississippi, Inc., and Entergy New Orleans, Inc. These companies, together with EGS, form the\n\"Operating Companies.\"\n8\n     Ice Storm '97 Field Investigations, Project No. 16301, at V-25 (June 24, 1997).\n9\n     General Counsel Ex. 5, Burrows Direct Testimony at 33, Attachment JDB-2.\n10\n     General Counsel Ex. 24.\n11\n     General Counsel Ex. 1, Ethridge Direct Testimony at 6.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                   Page6\n\nel<~ctricity   being available when they need it. In fact, for most customers, delivery of\nelectrical power and reliability of its delivery have become two inseparable expectations.\nElectric utilities generally recognize and accept this dependence and have responded to it\nby constructing and operating generation and delivery systems of superior reliability. 12\nState law formalizes the utilities' obligation to provide reliable service in PURA\n§ 37.151. Reliability, however, is not a static concept. As customer bases grow and\nsystems age, utilities face new challenges that must be acknowledged and resolved to\nmaintain reliable service.\n\n\n          In addition to sufficient generating capacity, transmission and distribution\nfacilities are built so that a specified degree of reliability is achieved. The goal is to\nprovide required amounts of energy with no, or few, interruptions, while maintaining a\nreasonable cost of the overall system. Smooth and continuous interaction of the various\nelements of the electrical system results in reliable performance of the overall system.\nFor consumers, this reliability is reflected in uninterrupted power supply, the degree of\nwhich may be measured by the frequency, duration, and magnitude of adverse effects on\nconsumer service.\n\n\nB. Legal Standards\n\n\n          PURA imposes various obligations on utilities and the Co:mrtlission regarding the\nprovision of electric service to Texas consumers. Specifically, PURA § 37.151 requires\nthat a regulated utility provide continuous and adequate service in its certificated service\nterritory.     PURA § 38.001 directs utilities to furnish service, instrumentalities, and\nfacilities that are safe, adequate, efficient, and reasonable. Parallel responsibilities rest\nwith the Commission. In accordance with PURA § 36.052(3), the Commission must\nconsider the quality of a utility's services in establishing a reasonable return on invested\n\n\n\n\n12\n     NORTH AMERICAN ELECTRIC RELIABILI1Y COUNCIL, RELIABILITY CONCEPTS 1-2 (Feb. 1985).\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                            Page7\n\n           13\ncapital.        This same section of PURA directs the Commission to consider the quality of\nthe utility's management and the efficiency of its operations when establishing a\nreasonable return. Moreover, PURA § 38.071 authorizes the Commission to order an\nelectric utility to provide \"specified\" improvements in its service.\n\n\nC. Analysis of Issues\n\n\n           The Commission's analysis of the issues in this case is divided into five general\ntopics: (1) physical facil,ities, maintenance, and monitoring; (2) vegetation management;\n(3) emergency preparedness, response, outage restoration, and treatment of storm data;\n(4) personnel levels, management practices, and spending levels; and (5) pockets of\nunreliable service and overall customer service.                 The following narrative lays out\nessential points of the relevant issues; with additional, specific information contained in\nthe Findings of Fact in Section IV.\n\n\n1. Physical Facilities, Maintenance, and Monitoring\n\n\n           a. Condition of Poles\n         As stated above, EGS' transmission system does not pose serious concerns since\nit has performed adequately over the last few years, during which only a minimal number\nof transmission-related outages or circuit-breaker operations occurred. EGS' inspection\nand treatment programs relating to its transmission system seem to be working\n\n\n\n13\n     There are several precedent cases in which the Commission reduced ROE to address inadequate quality\nof service. See, e.g., Application of General Telephone Company of the Southwest for Authority to\nIncrease Rates, Docket No. 3094, Final Order, 6 P.U.C. BULL. 92, 123 (Aug. 8, 1980) (imposing penalty\non company for inadequate service quality); Application of General Telephone Company of the Southwest\nfor Authority to Increase Rates, Docket No. 3690, Final Order, 7 P.U.C. BULL. 11, 39 (June 18, 1981)\n(sustaining penalty due to persistence of poor service); Application of General Telephone Company of the\nSouthwest for Authority to Increase Rates, Docket No. 4132, Final Order, 7 P.U.C.

The remainder of this Order will address the\nCompany's distribution system and related services.\n\n\n            Primary evidence for the condition of EGS' distribution system, including wires,\npoles, pole appurtenances, and transformers, comes from the Osmose Wood Preserving\nCompany (Osmose) inspections conducted in 1995 and 1996, a report filed by Drash\nConsulting Engineering, Inc. (Drash), and limited Staff surveys. 15 In general, most of the\npoles in the Texas portion of the Company's distribution system are in good condition.\nThere are, however, numerous poles with physical deficiencies or in need of extensive\nand comprehensive vegetation clearing. 16\n\n\n            The Osmose inspectors, contracted by EGS in 1995 and 1996, examined\napproximat~ly       37,000, or 10 percent, of the poles and crossarms and found that on\n                                                                                              17\naverage 17.9 percent of poles in eight different areas showed structural decay.                    The\nactual percentages, however, varied greatly, with one area having more than 37 percent of\nthe poles with some decay, a condition clearly impermissible for any transmission and\ndistributi~n (T&D) system. 18 While the Osmose inspections were not random, and in\nfact, as the Company asserts, focused on particularly troubled spots, the results show that\nthere are many poles in unsatisfactory condition.\n\n\n\n\n14\n     General Counsel Ex. 1, Ethridge Direct Testimony at 6-8, 41-43.\n15\n  General Counsel Ex. 1, Ethridge Direct Testimony at 15; General Counsel Ex. 4; General Counsel Ex. 5,\nBurrows Direct Testimony, Attachment JDB-3.\n16\n     /d. at 5.\n17\n     General Counsel Ex. 5, Burrows Direct Testimony at 17.\n18\n     Id, Appendix Workpapers at 2.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                               Page9\n\n\n            The purpose of the Drash report, contracted for by the Commission, was to collect\ndata regarding the condition of EGS' overhead distribution system. The survey was\nbased on a sample of33 uniformly distributed substations from the Texas portion of EGS\ndistribution system. 19 The Drash inspectors examined 582 poles on various feeders\noriginating at these su'Qstations. 20 The Drash survey found 59 poles with structural\ndeficiencies and 72 poles with ROW encroachments? 1 During the hearing, EGS raised\nquestions about the accuracy and statistical reliability of the Drash report.            The\nCommission concludes that the Drash study lacked specific evaluation criteria and\nnecessary randomness to draw conclusions about the entire EGS Texas system. The\nCommission, however, does not reject the Drash report, as requested by the Company;22\nrather, the Commission relies on the report to the extent that its findings have been\nconfirmed by the Osmose inspections and Staff surveys.             Considered together, the\ncollected data persuasively indicate that numerous poles show decay, are in need of repair\nor replacement, and that vegetation growth poses a serious problem on some ROW.\n\n\n            b. Pole Inspection Program\n            The Company conceded that it does not have a traditional pole inspection\nprogr~ in place.23 Since the Osmose inspections in 1996, there have been no pole or\ncrossarm inspections on Texas territory. 24 Post-merger, EGS reduced the number of\ninspections; for example, in 1995, 29,294 poles and 43,941 crossarms were inspected, but\n                                                                           25\nin 1996, only 7,939 poles and 11,908 crossarms underwent inspections.

Maintenance Practices\n           A review of maintenance records shows that line maintenance and vegetation\ncontrol are reactive in nature;27 there is a lack of written, specific, and preventive\nmaintenance policies;28 and priority is given to capital additions to the detriment of\nadequate maintenance practices. 29 For example, total line-miles actively maintained by\nthe Company's employees dropped 30 percent from 1994 to 1996?0 The Company's\ninternal risk assessment study points to an absence of a strategic plan, and consequent\ninadequacies in resource sharing and work planning. 31                  Based on the evidence, the\nCommission concludes that EGS has failed to establish and carry out distribution\nmaintenance policies in a manner sufficient to ensure adequate and reliable delivery of\nelectric service.\n\n\n           d. Data Collection\n           The Company presented a variety of data to support its claim of good\nperformance; however, the accuracy of its data collection practices came under a great\ndeal of scrutiny during the hearing, bringing into question the ability of the Company to\n\n26\n     Tr. at 751-52.\n27\n     General Counsel Ex. 4, Gonzalez Direst Testimony at 6-8, Drash Report at 45-46.\n28\n     Tr. at 59; HLFCCG Ex.

The parties debated at length the merits and mechanics of\nvarious system monitoring tools and reporting standards. These include: (1) System\nAverage Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), a measure of the number of interruptions\nper year for the average customer;32 (2) System Average Interruption Duration Index\n(SAIDI), a measure of the total interruption time experienced by the average customer; 33\n(3) Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI), defined as the ratio of\nSAIDIISAIFI; 34 ( 4)         Distribution Interruption System (DIS), a database to capture\nreliability performance and indices for individual feeders; 35 (5) Average System\nAvailability Index (ASAI)/ 6 a measure of the total time of service availability to the\naverage customer; and (6) TACTICS, which captures data on every device        ~own   to the\ntransformer level to measure each device's operational performance and impact on\ncustomers. 37 In addition, the Company utilizes a System Control and Data Acquisition\ndevice (SCADA) to measure data for large interruptions such as feeder breaker outages/ 8\nand the new Automatic Mapping and Facilities Management System (AMJFM),\ndeveloped in order to determine where an outage occurred and what device caused it,\nwhich will be completed by the year 2000. 39\n\n\n            General Counsel, Cities, and HLFCCG argued that the number of customers\naffected by outages and the duration of such outages are difficult to determine because\n\n\n\n32\n     HLFCCG Ex. 1, Patton Direct Testimony at 9-12.\n33\n     Id. at 10.\n\n34   !d.\n3S           .\n     !d. at 11.\n36\n     General Counsel Ex. 3, Eckhoff Direct Testimony at 20.\n37\n     Tr. at 448-450.\n38\n     Tr. at 238, 443.\n39\n     Tr. at 429-30.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                     Page 12\n\n\nEGS excluded relevant information between 1994 and 1996.4° For example, for the first\nsix months of 1996, the Company reported 35 to 40 percent fewer outages than were\nreported on average during the first six months of the years 1991-94.41 In trying to\nexplain the discrepancies in the data, Company officials described changing data\ncollection standards applied to the various outage-causing events. At different times, the\nCompany excluded outages caused by equipment failures; outages affecting feeders with\nfewer than 500 customers; storms, generation or transmission outages; or trees falling\ninto the ROW (\"non-preventable\" trees). 42 The Company data is generally confusing\nand comparisons over a period of several years are difficult to make because of changing\nstandards; 43 in addition, the inaccuracies are further compounded because, for example,\noutages on feeders with fewer than 500 customers can nevertheless result in very long\noutage durations, especially when those feeders are energized last. 44\n\n\n           The evidence shows that Company linemen sometimes made subjective\ndeterminations as to the cause, duration, or effect of an outage, thus causing the\nCompany's SAIFI and SAID! numbers to be unreliable. 45 The evidence also revealed\n                                                                            46\nthat most historically deficient feeders serve rural customers.                  This observation is\nsupported by EGS' testimony that it prioritizes restoration of feeders serving the greatest\nnumbers of customers, thus leaving those in lower-density areas (most likely rural) to\n                                                                       47\nexperience recurring and longer service reliability problems.\n\n\n40\n     See HLFCCG Ex. 2, Entergy Southwest Reliability Report 1.994-1996; Tr. at 41-43.\n41\n     HLFCCG Ex. 3 at slide 9.\n42\n     Tr. at 41-44, 54, 62-66.\n43\n     Id; HLFCCG Ex. 2 at Bates Stamp 0232514.\n44\n     Tr. at 67.\n45\n     Tr. at 47-48.\n46\n     Tr. at 707, 821\n47\n  The Rebuttal (redacted) Testimony of Dereck Hasbrouck on behalf of the Company contains this quote:\n\"One important fact to keep in mind when considering a customer or group of customers who consistently\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                            Page 13\n\n\n            General Counsel, Cities, and HLFCCG asserted that the Company has\nmanipulated information to show better performance. 48 A significant problem with the\nCompany's use of performance and reliability indices is that they reflect outage\nfrequency and duration on a system-wide rather than feeder-by-feeder basis which can\nmask poor performance of individual.feeders. 49 For example, EGS reported a syst_em-\nwide SAIDI of 133 minutes for 1996,50 but this measure failed to reveal that 83 feeders or\nprimary circuits experienced outage times in excess of 200 minutes. 51                        The average\ncustomer on these circuits experienced an outage duration of 3.3 hours. 52 More notably,\ncustomers on feeder Tamina encountered 41.3 hours of outage time in one year. 53 It is\napparent that system-wide averages used by the Company cannot be relied on to disclose\nmany of the localized service difficulties.\n\n\n           The historic data presented by the Company is not accurate and consistent as the\nCompany itself admitted to not collecting all relevant data, 54 changing the standards for\n                                                                      55\ndata collection, and submitting inconsistent data for ASAI and SAIFI.                             Even the\n\n\n\nreceive less reliable service than the average customer is that there are geographic and environmental\nconditions beyond the utility's control. These conditions, in combination with the construction cost\nconsiderations may effectively limit the realistic reliability expectations for customers in certain areas.

The\nCommission finds that the level of EGS' service quality and reliability, as documented\nthrough the Company data, is unreliable because the data fail to record and report all\nevents accurately and consistently. Pockets of inadequate service are ignored by system-\nwide measures, and such measures do not identify recurring individual-feeder problems.\n\n\n2. Vegetation Management\n\n\n           Vegetation management is the catch-all description for programs involving the\nremoval of trees, bushes, or vines that overhang, grow into, or toward conductors strung\nalong the Company's ROW. The purpose of vegetation management is to ensure, to the\ngreatest extent possible, that vegetation in, or near, the ROW does not come into contact\nwith the conductors and thereby cause wire breakage or ground faults. 58 During the\nhearing, Company witnesses referred to scheduled tree trimming, carried out on a three-\nyear cycle in urban. areas and a six-year cycle in rural areas. The evidence presented,\nhowever, was not clear on whether EGS actually followed the stated cycles. 59\nNonetheless, the Company argued that its vegetation management has been adequate and\n\n\n\n\n56\n     Cities Ex.

The majority of incidents included in the evidence involve three\ntypes of vegetation-related damage: wires expanding down into vegetation due to\nincreased load or lack of under-clearance; overhanging limbs breaking or growing into\nwires in non-inclement weather; and limbs or trees bending or breaking onto wires due to\nwind, ice build-up, or other adverse weather conditions. These parties also argued that\nthe ROW surveyed were in need of extensive clearing and that vegetation encroachments\nposed unacceptable risks. 62           Cities claimed that neglected vegetation management\nmultiplied the severity of the ice storm in January 1997. 63 The number and duration of\n                                                                                           64\nvegetation-caused service interruptions almost doubled in the last four years,                  and\n                                                                            65\nvegetation-related SAIDI and SAIFI have worsened since the merger.\n\n\n           The author of a vegetation management study, commissioned by the Company,\nobserved that there were areas where maintenance clearing had been deferred until brush\nreached the conductors. 66 The study proposed specific and comprehensive ways for\n\n\n\n60\n   EGS Ex. 10, Ervin Rebuttal Testimony at 55, 59.

An e-mail sent in August of 1997 by an EGS network manager in\nBeaumont identified trees touching· conductors as one of the preventable root causes of\nseveral recent outages. 67\n\n\n            The Commission concludes that the level of the Company's vegetation\nmanagement is unacceptable and has significantly affected the reliability of the\ndistribution system in recent years. While such a deficiency may not in itself impact a\ntypical system severely, this deficiency is magnified when the inadequacy of the\ninfrastructure and the nature of the weather in the Company's service area are taken into\naccount. 68 The lack of preventive vegetation control efforts, by the Company and neglect\nof regular vegetation clearing have led to the creation of unnecessary risks.                The\nCommission does not suggest that \"ground-to-sky\" tree trimming is necessary, but the\nCompany clearly has significant room for improvement. The recent hiring of 30 new\nvegetation clearance crews, while welcome, confirms the existence of an unacceptable\nbacklog in vegetation control. 69 As will be discussed below, the Commission is also\nconcerned that managers in Texas have no clear line of authority or resources necessary\nto implement effective vegetation management policies.\n\n\n\n\n66\n    General Counsel Ex. 27, Environmental Consultants, Inc., Report on Distribution Line Clearance\nProgram (Jul. 1994) at 1-2-3.\n67\n     HLFCCG Ex. 6.\n68\n     Tr. at 308.\n69\n     Tr. at 730-31, 787.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                         Page 17\n\n3. Emergency Preparedness, Response, Outage Restoration, and Treatment of\nStorm Data\n\n\n            a. January 1997 Ice Storm\n            In mid-January 1997, many parts of Texas experienced a severe ice storm;\n                                                                                         70\ndisruptions of electric service were sustained by most utilities in the state.                The impact\non EGS' territory was particularly hard. At one time, up to 120,000 of EGS' customers\nwere without power and it took seven days to complete the restoration process. 71\nUtilizing help from other utilities and contract workers, EGS had more than 2,700\npersonnel working to restore service. 72 In assessing the Company's performance, EGS\nofficials compared it to that of other utilities and concluded that its efforts were not only\nadequate, but even \"very good.'m They blamed most of the damage on excessive ice.74\n\n\n           This view was not shared by the other parties. 75 HLFCCG played excerpts from\ntaped conversations conducted by the Company's dispatchers during the storm, which\nhighlighted insufficient numbers of personnel and initially inadequate efforts to repair the\ndamage.76 The Cities asserted that they had to use their own employees for repairs,\nincluding the handling of live wires, 77 and that in some instances they were unable to\nreach Company employees at a11. 78 One of the Cities' exhibits was a letter, dated August\n\n\n70\n     General Counsel Ex. 2B, Hughes Workpapers, Ice Storm '97 Field Investigations Project 16301 at 11-1.\n\n71\n     EGS Ex. 8, Ervin Supplemental Direct Testimony at 53.\n\n72   Jd.\n\n73\n     Jd. at 74.\n74\n     Id. at 74-75.\n15\n     Tr. at 379; Cities Ex. 1, Lawton Direct Testimony at 12.\n76\n     Tr. at 87-92.\n77\n     Tr. at 376.\n78\n     Cities Ex. 2, Kimler Direct Testimony at 2.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                         Page 18\n\n\n17, 1995, from several fire chiefs in EGS' service territory to the Company describing\nvarious problems with emergency procedures, such as not being able to reach the\nCompany's 1-800 telephone number, and, apparently, this problem persisted. 79 Some\nother cities' representatives testified, however, that the Company's restoration efforts\nwere good. 80 The significant disparities in the Company's response to the qamage caused\nby the ice storm suggest a need for greater and clearer communication between the\nCompany and all cities, including development of contacts before an emergency occurs.\n\n\n           The Company has an emergency plan on file with the Commission; the plan\ncontains no obvious deficiencies. 81 As is industry practice, EGS also has agreements\nwith other utilities for emergency cooperation; those agreements, however, are not in\nwriting. 82\n\n\n           The January 1997 ice storm was certainly a severe storm that would have\nadversely affected even the best-maintained distribution system.      EGS' distribution\nsystem, however, is not the best-maintained. A major cause of the outages during the\nstorm were broken or bowed ice-laden tree limbs overhanging the wires. Tree limbs in\nROW overhanging distribution lines pose a threat to system reliability, and are largely\nwithin EGS' control. The Company's failure to clear the limbs before the storm was a\n                                                                               83\nmajor factor in the number and duration of outages experienced by customers.        While\nCompany's initial efforts to mobilize and deploy additional non-EGS personnel were\nslow and cause concern, 84 vegetation management failures greatly aggravated the\n\n\n79\n     Cities Ex. 2, Kimler Direct Testimony at 7.\n80\n     Tr. at 377, 381, 391.\n81\n     General Counsel Ex. 2, Hughes Direct Testimony at 21.\n82\n     Tr. at 676-77.\n83\n     General Counsel Ex. 2, Hughes Direct Testimony at 17.\n84\n     Tr. at 379.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                Page 19\n\n\nsituation. The Company has experienced major storms in 1994, 1995, and 1997. 85 The\nweather, however, cannot be an excuse for poor service. While the Commission does not\nexpect 100 percent reliability, the system must be built and maintained taking the local\ngeographic and weather conditions into account.\n\n\n            b. Treatment of Storm Data\n            The Commission has required utilities to report the causes of interruptions,\nincluding the extreme storms. EGS, however, excludes outage duration and frequency\ndata from its SAIDI and SAIFI reports if the data are attributable to a \"major storm.\"86\nAs defined currently by the Commission, major storms include situations in which there\nis a loss of power to 10 percent or more of customers in a region over a 24-hour period\nand full restoration is not achieved within 24 hours. 87 EGS' definition of a major storm\ncounts any event in which 10 percent or more of a region's customers are interrupted for\n                                                                       88\n24 hours or more, and is similar to the Commission's definition.\n\n\n            HLFCCG argued that interruptions associated with major storms should be\nincluded in the computation of reliability indices. HLFCCG maintains that the design\nand maintenance of lines, and therefore their condition under the stress of severe weather,\nis within the control of the utility. 89            Exclusion of major-storm interruptions from\nreliability indices could encourage reduced preventive maintenance, including vegetation\n                                                                            90\nmanagement, and reductions in force needed for restoration efforts.\n\n\n\n\n8S\n     Tr. at214, 377.\n86\n     Tr. at 54.\n87\n     EGS Ex. 10, Ervin Rebuttal Testimony at 30.\n\n88   /d.\n\n89\n     HLFCCG Ex. 1, Patton Direct Testimony at 14.\n90\n     /d. at 15.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                      Page20\n\n\n           The Commission is reluctant to allow the Company to exclude major-storm data\nfrom its overall reports because such reports may be incorrectly perceived as an\nindication that overall service quality is better than it actually is. Also, leaving major-\nstorm data out may obscure the fact that poor management and maintenance, and not just\nthe severity of the weather, contribute to or cause a weather event to become serious\nenough to be classified as a \"major storm.\"                 Despite a great deal of controverting\ntestimony by customer groups, the Company continues to assert that the acknowledged\nproblems during the 1997 ice storm were a \"storm-of-the-century\" aberration. 91\nAllowing the Company to carve out major storms from its outage-reporting data would\nmask the seriousness of service quality problems that occur on its system under all\nconditions.\n\n\n           The Commission understands that if a truly major storm affects the system, the\nCompany cannot be expected to restore power and respond to increased customer calls as\n                                                       I\n\n\nfast as it would in a more \"normal\" or day-to-day situations. Therefore, the Commission\nwill allow the segregation of major from non-major storm data in outage frequency and\nduration reports. The major storms, defined by the severity of the weather conditions,\nrather than by the outage duration, will be reported and evaluated separately, as discussed\nin the \"Remedies\" section below.\n\n\n4. Personnel Levels and Management Practices; Spending Levels\n\n\n           a. Personnel Levels\n           All parties agreed that post-merger personnel cuts were executed, ostensibly, in\norder to save costs. The Company asserted that cuts were possible because of increased\nefficiencies and that the permanent employees were simply replaced with contract\nworkers. 92 The other parties maintained that cuts were not only too extensive, but\n\n91\n     Tr. at 225; EGS Ex. 10, Ervin Rebuttal Testimony at 32-35.\n92\n   Tr. at 160, 236; EGS Ex. 8, Ervin Supplemental Direct at 19; EGS Ex. 10, Ervin Rebuttal Testimony at\n51.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                        Page21\n\n\nresulted in a loss of many years of worker experience that could not be compensated for\nby contract workers who may lack knowledge of the system or loyalty to the Company.\nFor example, General Counsel witness Ethridge cited the forced departure of 66\nemployees with an average of 18 years of experience each. 93 A precise number of lost\nemployees was not conclusively proven: the Company maintained that total net loss was\nonly 23,94 but HLFCCG, for instance, asserted that in the space of three years, the jobs of\n671inemen were eliminated. 95\n\n\n           A related issue concerned the Company's ability to evaluate contract workers'\nperformance: while the Company felt confident about increased efficiency of its hiring\npractices, it did admit to not having performance measures for contract workers. 96\nGeneral Counsel presented Company documents showing that controls over contract\nworker management were not effective.97 An internal risk assessment audit, conducted\nby the Company, also concluded that no formal and consistent process existed to monitor\ncontractor performance, that management employees did not generate necessary reports\nto allow proper monitoring, and that distribution contracts were not competitively bid. 98\nAn additional concern presented by Cities dealt with the decrease in the number of\noperational staff while regulatory staff increased; this led Cities to conclude that the\n                                                                             99\nCompany had insufficient focus on system maintenance matters.\n\n\n\n\n93\n     General Counsel Ex. 1, Ethridge Direct Testimony at 37.\n94\n     Tr. at 236; EGS Ex. 10, Ervin Rebuttal Testimony at 52.\n95\n     HLFCCG m at 6 (referring to General Counsel Ex. 16 at 2, and Ex. 17 at 2).\n96\n     Tr. at 249-50.\n97\n     General Counsel IB at 14 (referring to HLFCCG Ex. 13, Entergy Internal Audit and Risk Assessment).\n98\n     HLFCCG Ex. 1, Patton Direct Testimony, Risk Assessment Attachment at 3-4, 6.\n99\n     Cities Ex. 1, Lawton Direct Testimony at 12; Tr. at 164.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                       Page22\n\n\n            The Commission concludes that, post-merger, EGS cut many experienced\nemployees, some of whom were consequently replaced by contract workers.                            The\nCommission, however, will not prescribe what personnel levels the Company should\nmaintain. It is up to EGS to make sure it has enough workers to carry out proper\nmaintenance and necessary emergency responses, along with having well-defined\nperformance measures for both regular and contract employees.\n\n\n            b. Management Practices\n            Because the various operational entities under the holding company are split both\nalong functional and geographic lines, tracing management structure poses some\ndifficulties. According to Company witness Johnny Ervin, a network manager is located\nin Beaumont, along with a reliability supervisor. 100 There are two levels of customer\nserVice managers located in Beaumont; the vice president of customer service is located\nin Jackson, Mississippi. During the hearing, however, the Company presented its director\nof performance measurement, located in Little Rock, Arkansas, to speak on customer\nservice issues. The network manager and reliability supervisor report to a franchise\ndirector (in Beaumont) and reliability director (in New Orleans, Louisiana), respectively.\nBoth of these directors report to a senior vice president of distribution operations, who is\nlocated in New Orleans and is actually employed by Entergy Services, Inc. The senior\nvice president answers to a utility group president, who has above him the chief operating\nofficer and, fmally, the chief executive officer of Entergy. According to Mr. Ervin, this\nreflects a new and \"flatter\" organizational structure, designed to promote better\ncommunication. 101 None of the managers in Beaumont reports to the EGS president, who\nhas offices in Beaumont and Austin, Texas.\n\n\n\n\n100\n     Tr. at 789-794; the entire description of the management structure is taken from these pages of the\ntranscript.\n\n101   !d.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                    Page23\n\n\n           The Commission has concerns regarding the Company's management structure.\nIt is not clear from the evidence that managers actually have the authority and matching\nresources to supervise their specific areas. 102 Those responsible for system reliability\nhave little control over the vegetation management area, even though vegetation\nmanagement has a major impact on how well the T&D system functions.                             The\nCompany's internal audit concluded that there was no overall strategic plan in place to set\nperformance strategies, and that hindered management in accomplishing business\nobjectives and goals. 103 While EGS' representatives explained that recent changes in\nmanagement structure were aimed at increasing communication, they also revealed that\nthere was no structured way for the management to track and resolve problems reported\n                       104\nby the employees.      In addition, managers' bonuses are tied in part to cost-cutting which\nmay confl1ct                   ·\n         .

The managers in the\nTexas territory must have clearly delineated powers and should be accountable to a\nunified higher management. The current, bifurcated management structure, under which\nlocal Texas supervisors report to multiple supervisors, is an obstacle to effective and\nreliable operation ofEGS' Texas system .\n\n\n          .c. Spending Levels\n           An issue addressed at length in this docket involved the Company's record of\ninvestment in the T &D system, particularly in maintenance. While there is hardly a\n\n\n\n102\n      Tr. at 791-92.\n103\n      ID..FCCG Ex.

Also, EGS internal risk assessment studies for vegetation\nmanagement and distribution maintenance list cost-cutting as a major business goal.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                       Page24\n\n\nsubstitute for sufficient O&M expenditures, the Commission will not prescribe a specific\nlevel of spending that may guarantee adequate service quality, and, at present, is not\nkeenly interested in past expenditure levels. The Commission is primarily interested in\nresults. As noted in the March 7, 1997 Supplemental Preliminary Order in Docket No.\n16705, the Commission recognizes \"that there may be a point of diminishing returns\nabove which the dollars or resources allocated to service quality become unreasonable\n                                    106\nand fail to be cost effective.\"           That crossover point is not set in this docket, and it is not\nintended to be set. EGS is responsible for determining sufficient spending levels and for\nthe appropriate allocation of resources to O&M, distribution capital additions, and other\ncategories in order to meet its obligation to provide adequate service quality.\n\n\n           In the hearing, EGS witnesses maintained that the Company had increased T&D\nspending since the 1993 merger; that inspection and measurement standards had\nimproved; and that its spending on service quality programs equaled or even exceeded\nthat of other utilities. 107 It is not certain, however, that EGS actually increased spending\nbecause expenses were not categorized clearly. Increased spending, if any, shows just\nthat--increased spending; it does not measure how the quality of service has improved, or\nwhether the service is adequate in accordance with PURA. Nonetheless, EGS is required\nto provide continuous and adequate service in accordance with traditional reasonable and\nnecessary cost standards. 108\n\n\n           In a memo dated October 31, 1995, a Company official discusses vegetation\nmaintenance spending in the Southern Region and points to a recently implemented 20\npercent reduction in allocations which, he expresses, cannot be sustained by any region\n\n\n\n\n106\n      Supplemental Preliminary Order at 2, Docket No. 16705 (Mar. 7, 1997).\n107\n      Tr. at 760; EGS IB at 7-10.\n108\n   The Commission would expect some increases in spending since the 1993 merger because GSU, facing\nbankruptcy, would have presumably reduced even the necessary expenses.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                    Page25\n\n\nwithout an adverse effect on customer service. 109 The parties generally agreed that\nspending on O&M decreased, while distribution capital additions slightly increased. 110\nThe Internal Audit department of the Company in its distribution risk assessment study\nidentified the budget process which allocated dollars to the regions based on past history\nrather than system needs as one of the problems that needed to be resolved. 111\n\n            After evaluating the record evidence, the Commission concludes that expenditure\nlevels for O&M are confusing and unclear, and pose a problem regarding tracking and\naccountability. While the Commission declines to state specific amounts to be spent,\nproper tracking and accounting of expenditures, both by type and jurisdiction, are\nessential. For example, the Company was unable to explain a 50 percent increase in the\n                                                                                           112\nmiscellaneous Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Account 588.                           It is\nvirtually impossible to ascertain how much of the O&M budget is actually spent in the\nTexas jurisdiction or for distribution capital additions as compared to system\nmaintenance.\n\n\n            The Commission concludes that expenditures for O&M must be readily available\nand verifiable. The same applies to the oft-mentioned, but never specified or quantified,\n\"increased efficiencies\" used to justify cutting costs. 113 For such claims to have any\nweight, the Company must have a ready and reasonable explanation together with\nsupporting documentation.\n\n\n\n\n109\n      General Counsel Ex. 28 at 2.\n110\n   Tr. at 134, 248; 353-54; General Counsel Ex. 1, Ethridge Direct Testimony at 20, 27; Cities Ex. 1,\nLawton Direct Testimony at 8.\n111\n      General Counsel Ex. 30 at 7.\n112\n      Jd. at 9; Tr. at 153-54.\n113\n      EGS Ex. 8, Ervin Supplemental Direct at 16, 19-20.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                      Page 26\n\n5. Pockets of Unreliability; Customer Service\n\n\n            a. Pockets ofUnreliability\n            One of the issues identified in the Supplemental Preliminary Order in Docket No.\n16705 involves pockets of particularly unreliable service, 114 such as the feeder Tamina,\nwhich had 41.3 hours of outage time in one year. 115 Rural customers are more likely to\nexperience outages and wait longer for restoration. The Company admits to areas of\nlower reliability 116 and agrees that \"outliers\" must be improved. 117              The Company's\npractice--seemingly logical--of first restoring and clearing areas with most customers has\nled to the same customers experiencing repeated lower-quality service. In addition, the\nCompany maintains a list of \"politically sensitive\" accounts, which suggests that some\ncustomers may receive preferential treatment. 118\n\n\n           The Commission concludes that there should be a high standard of service for all\ncustomers, including a set minimum standard below which no customer would fall, and\nthat the Company needs to bring all of its worst performing poles and feeders into\ncompliance with that minimum standard.\n\n\n           b. Customer Service\n           The Company has maintained, from the outset of this case, that its service is not\ndeficient, but that it simply faces a \"customer perception\" problem. The Company knows\nthat it has a large number of customers who are not satisfied with their electric service. 119\n\n114\n    Supplemental Preliminary Order at 3, Docket No. 16705 (March 7, 1997); see also, General Counsel\nEx. 7 at36.\n115\n      General Counsel Ex. 3, EckhoffDirect Testimony, Appendix H.\n116\n      Tr.at122,223,652.\n117\n      Tr. at 223-24.\n118\n      Tr. at 396-97.\n119\n   Tr. at 219.

The same concerns were reflected in the testimony of city officials chatged\nwith protecting the health and safety of their citizens. Of particular note was the evidence\nthat a municipality was compelled to call upon its volunteer firefighters to disconnect live\nelectric wires because the Company's personnel were not available to perform this highly\ndangerous task. 120\n\n\n            The Company's inadequate service quality is not necessarily an outgrowth of a\nlack of \"money\" or \"expenditures.\" The Company has available funds that should be\nsufficient to provide higher-quality service, as may be gathered from the fact that the\nentire O&M budget was not spent. 121 It should be noted that the internal risk assessment\nstudy on distribution line construction and service restoration lists as the first priority\nimprovement in customer perception of energy delivery and improvement in reliability\nonly as a secop.d priority. 122\n\n\n           EGS' customers and the Commission believe that the Company has an obligation\nto provide continuous and adequate service, and that significant improvements in EGS'\nperformance are needed. Section D, below, outlines the outcomes EGS must attain for\nthe Commission to be satisfied that those improvements have been made.                  An\nimprovement in EGS performance will eventually lead to more favorable perceptions and\nevaluations by the Company's customers.\n\n\n\n\n120\n      Tr. at 376.\n121\n      Tr. at 468-70.\n122\n      General Counsel Ex. 30 at 1.\n\f PUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                      Page28\n\nD. Remedies\n\n\n         Based on the foregoing analysis, the Commission concludes that the Company's\nservice quality must be improved. The following incentive plan lays out remedies to help\nEGS achieve such improvements. The five essential components of the plan are as\nfollows:\n\n      1. A reduction in the return on equity divided into two parts: an adjustment\n         component that recognizes EGS' current service quality is not adequate, with\n         amounts to be refunded to customers, and            an\n                                                        incentive-pool component to\n         encourage future improvements in service quality;\n      2. Adoption of minimum and target levels for SAIDI and SAIFI as\n         recommended in General Counsel's testimony, including improvement in the\n         worst- feeder performance; establishment of standards for major-storm data;\n         and reporting requirements;\n      3. Partial adoption of customer service performance benchmarks as\n         recommended in General Counsel's testimony;\n      4. Establishment of a quality assurance requirement to ensure improved\n         performance through the hiring of an independent consultant consistent with\n         the amended, non-unanimous stipulation; and, to guarantee the accuracy of\n         all data, hiring by the Company of an independent auditor to review all\n         reports. 123\n      5. A customer information and notification requirement.\n\n\n1. Reduction in the Return on Equity and Incentive Pool\n\n\n        Drawing from the recommendation in the testimony of Cities' witness Lawton,\nthe Company will be assessed a 60-basis point reduction in its ROE adopted in Phase II\nof Docket No. 16705.           This reduction shall be implemented in recognition of the\nhistorically inadequate performance of EGS' distribution system. The Company will be\nrequired to refund current overcollections, including all appropriate taxes, for the period\n\n\n\n123\n    EGS had filed an amended, non-unanimous stipulation regarding the hiring of an independent\nconsultant to assess Company's distribution system, including a review of the service quality processes.\nThe Commission approved the stipulation with modifications on January 15, 1998.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                        Page 29\n\n\nstarting with June 1, 1996, the effective date of any rate reductions ordered in Docket No.\n16705, up to the effective date of this order. 124\n\n\n\n         Going forward, the Company will collect the amount equal to one-half of the 60-\nbasis point reduction, plus appropriate taxes, and deposit that amount in an interest-\nbearing escrow account to create an incentive pool.                 The Company may earn this\nescrowed amount back by achieving specific performance targets. The other one-half of\nthe 60-basis point reduction, plus appropriate taxes, will be retained by the ratepayers.\nThe performance evaluation year will be a 12-month period, commencing on November\n1, and ending on October 31. For SAIDI and SAIFI minimum level compliance, SAIDI\nand SAIFI target level compliance, and compliance with the billing-error rate and call\ncenter performance targets, the initial evaluation period shall commence on November 1,\n1997, and end on October 31, 1998. For service installation, line extension, and light\nreplacement customer service performance measures, the initial evaluation period shall\ncommence on May 1, 1998, and end on October 31, 1998. Thus, EGS' performance\nduring the initial measurement year for these three performance measures shall be based\non only six months of customer service performance. During subsequent years, EGS'\nperformance shall be based on twelve months of customer service performance. At the\nend of each performance evaluation period, if the Company fails to achieve stated\nperformance benchmarks in any of the three areas (SAIDI and SAIFI minimum levels,\nSAIDI and SAIFI target levels, and customer service), a corresponding portion of the\nincentive pool will be refunded to distribution-level customers, divided on a pro-rata\nbasis within each customer class, except as noted below. If the Company successfully\nreaches all of the benchmarks, the full amount of the incentive pool will revert back to\nEGS.\n\n\n\n\n124\n    The effective date of this order for the purposes of the requirements set forth herein is the date on\nwhich this Order is no longer subject to rehearing.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                              Page30\n\n\n        The performance evaluation year is intended to coincide with the filing\nrequirements of the Commission's Electric System Service Quality Report (ESSQR)\nforms. If the Commission were to change the ESSQR form time periods to a calendar-\nyear basis, the performance evaluation periods discussed above for EGS shall change to\nbe consistent with the Report form periods.\n\n\n        Performance will be evaluated, and the incentive pool will be divided, according\nto three measures: (1) improvement in the minimum performance levels for SAIDI and\nSAIFI for worst feeders; (2) improvement in the target performance levels for SAIDI and\nSAIFI for average feeders; and (3) improvement in customer service performance, which\nhas five components: (a) billing-error rate, (b) connection rate at the call center, (c)\ntimeliness in completing service and meter installations, (d) timeliness in completing line\nextensions, and (e) timeliness in replacing and/or repairing service and street lights.\n\n\n       For the purposes of determining what amount, if any, the Company will earn\nback, the portions of the incentive pool will be represented by the following benchmarks:\nSAIDI and SAIFI minimum value improvements for the \"worst\" feeders (described\nbelow) will count as one-third of the pool; SAIDI and SAIFI target value improvements\nwill count as one-third of the pool; and customer service improvements will count as one-\nthird. Failure to achieve a measure will result in refunds to the affected customers based\non the requirements for that specific measure. SAIDI and SAIFI will be calculated on a\nfeeder-specific basis.\n\n\n       The Company has stated it does not have the ability to measure customer-specific\nfeeder performance, and thus cannot calculate customer-specific refunds. For the first\nmeasure, however, refunds shall be provided to all customers taking service from a feeder\nthat fails to meet the SAIDI and SAIFI minimum acceptable levels as recorded over a\none-year period. These refunds are more customer-specific than currently contemplated\nby the Company, but because only a small number of feeders is expected to fall into this\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                            Page 31\n\n\ncategory, the refund calculations should not pose an insurmountable problem. 125 For the\nsecond measure, if the Company fails to achieve the specified SAID I and SAIFI target\nlevel improvements, refunds shall be made to all Texas, distribution-level customers. For\nthe third measure, failure to meet the standard for any of the customer service\ncomponents will result in pro-rata refunds to each of the distribution-level customers.\nDistribution-level customers are meant to be those Texas, retail residential and small\ncommercial ratepayers whose contract demands are less than or equal to 100 k W.\n\n\n            Feeder-specific refunds shall be distributed in a single billing period in proportion\nto and limited by each customer's total annual electric usage (i.e., no customer shall\nreceive a refund greater than the total amount paid by that customer for the service in that\nyear). If any money remains in the pool, the amount shall be refunded to all distribution-\nlevel customers on a pro-rata basis.              All refunds shall be labeled \"Service Quality\nRefund\" on the customer's bill and shall be directed to the current customer receiving .\nservice at a given premise.\n\n2. Minimum and Target Performance Levels\n\n\n            a. Frequency and Duration of Interruptions\n\n            The performance benchmarks are drawn from General Counsel's testimony with\nsome adjustments. General Counsel proposed that the Company measure the duration of\ninterruptions using the Average System Availability Index (ASAI). The ASAI index and\nthe SAIDI index are closely related. Since the Company is required to report SAIDI\nunder the Commission's service quality rules, that index will be used as the duration\nmeasure. General Counsel, HLFCCG, and Cities agree that performance should be\nmeasured feeder-by-feeder rather than through a system average. EGS has accepted a\nfeeder-by-feeder approach for outage frequency. 126                 General Counsel's proposal for\n\n125\n    The Company states that it does not have the ability to tie specific feeders to specific customers; it is\nexpected, however, that the number of feeders involved is such that manual calculations will be possible or\nthe Company can use its TACTICS program.

The\nCommission adopts the following performance targets for use by EGS as its reliability\nperformance standards.\n\n\nTable 1: General Counsel's Proposal for Interruption Performance Measures\n\nIndex Value                          Minimum Acceptable Value                Target Value\n                                                 (annual)                      (annual)\nSAIFI                                        3 .8 interruptions             2.6 interruptions\nSAIDI                                    315 minutes (5.25 hours)       158 minutes (2.63 hours)\nSource: Eckhoff Direct Testimony at 7.\n\n\n\n         General Counsel's testimony indicates that distribution feeders serving\napproximately 90 percent of EGS' Texas customer meters met the minimum acceptable\nvalues for SAIDI and SAIFI in 1996. 128 Distribution feeders serving approximately 75\n                                                                                129\npercent ofEGS' Texas customer meters met the target values in 1996.\n\n\n         b. Minimum Performance Benchmark\n         General Counsel presented testimony to show that a certain percentage of EGS'\nfeeders fall below the minimum acceptable values for SAIDI and SAIFI. As part of the\nremedial plan, the Company must achieve 95 percent compliance with the minimum\nacceptable values in 1998, so that no more than 5 percent of distribution feeders serving\nEGS' Texas customer fail to meet the minimum acceptable values for SAID! and SAIFI.\n\n\n\n\n127\n   General Counsel Ex. 3, Eckhoff Direct Testimony at 7. HLFCCG recommends an annual feeder-by-\nfeeder standard for SAIFI of 3 interruptions and for SAID I of 200 minutes. HLFCCG Ex. 1, Patton Direct\nTestimony at 29.\n128\n    General Counsel reported that feeders serving 89.97 percent ~f EGS' Texas customer meters met the\nSAIFI minimum value, and 90.84 percent met the ASAI minimum value. General Counsel Ex. 3, Eckhoff\nDirect Testimony at 33-34.\n129\n    General Counsel reported that feeders serving 75.6 percent of EGS' Texas customers met the SAIFI\ntarget value, and 76.86 percent met the ASAI target value. Id\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                            Page 33\n\n\nFor the following year, the compliance level will be raised to 98.5 percent. In addition, in\nyear 2 and thereafter, EGS must also meet the following conditions: (1) two or more\nfeeders served by the same substation may not fail to attain any minimum acceptable\nvalue; (2) no feeder may fail to attain the minimum acceptable value for two or more\nconsecutive years; and (3) 98.5 percent of all meters must receive service at a level\nmeeting or exceeding both minimum acceptable values. Feeders with 5 or fewer meters\nshall not be considered in determining whether EGS has met these compliance standards.\nThe Company will maintain or exceed the 98.5 percent compliance with these standards\nin the subsequent years.\n\n\n       To document and track this improvement, the Company shall identify the worst-\nperforming feeders as discussed herein. EGS shall file SAIDI and SAIFI performance\ndata for all feeders in the following way: (1) exclusive of storm effects and using the\nSAIDI and SAIFI definitions of major events as contained in the Commission's Electric\nSystem Service Quality Report filing (PUC Project No. 15013), and (2) inclusive of all\nsuch storm effects and defining major weather events as an ice accumulation of at least\none inch of ice within the period of 24 hours, or winds greater than 80 miles-per-hour.\nFurther, EGS shall rank all of its 431 Texas distribution feeders from best to worst\naccording to SAIFI numbers calculated as described above. A list of the worst I 0 percent\nshall be submitted as a part of the June 15, 1998 ESSQR filing. Because the report asks\nfor data on the worst 5 percent of the feeders, the Company shall supplement its filing for\nthe purposes of this docket. If the Company fails to meet the minimum acceptable value\nbenchmark or the major-storm restoration measure for that year, as described below, one-\nthird of the incentive pool amount, plus appropriate taxes, will be refunded to customers\nserved by all non-complying feeders.\n\n\n       c. Target Performance Benchmark\n       In 1998, for all feeders, the Company must achieve 85 percent compliance with\nGeneral Counsel's recommended target levels for SAIDI and SAIFI to retain the\ncorresponding portion of the incentive pool (i.e., the Company must improve up to the\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                               Page34\n\n\ntarget levels an additional 10 percent of its feeders, from 75 to 85 percent). In the\nfollowing year, SAIDI and SAIFI compliance with the target levels will be raised to 90\npercent of feeders, and this level will be maintained or exceeded in the future. If the\nCompany fails to meet the target performance benchmark, one-third of the incentive pool,\nplus appropriate taxes, will be refunded to all Texas distribution-level customers.\n\n\n       d. Treatment of Major-Storm Data\n       The record shows that extreme weather events can cause major outages. For the\npurposes of record-keeping and performance evaluation, it is necessary to define extreme\nevents according to actual weather conditions rather than the effect weather has on the\nT&D system. For the purposes of its supplemental filing, EGS shall define extreme\nweather as an ice accumulation of at least one inch of ice within the period of24 hours, or\nwinds greater than 80 miles-per-hour. The Company shall keep its records in a way that\nincludes all weather events, and a separate set that includes only the major-weather\nevents. The determination of the Company's performance regarding SAIDI and SAIFI\nbenchmarks shall be calculated based on the all-inclusive data.             In addition, the\nCommission adopts as the performance measure for major-weather events the complete\nrestoration of all customers' electric service no later than 120 hours after the initiation of\nsuch an event (i.e., when an accumulation of one inch of ice or 80 mph wind have been\nrecorded). Failure to achieve this measure will preclude the Company's recovery of the\none-third of the incentive pool, plus appropriate taxes, associated with the SAID! and\nSAIFI minimum acceptable level compliance for that year.\n\n\n       If an extreme-weather event occurs on the system, and the Company believes it\nhas a detrimental effect on the overall performance for that year, the Company may\nsubmit a good cause exception filing for the Commission's consideration on whether to\ninclude such an event in the annual evaluation of compliance with set benchmarks.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page35\n\n\n          e. Reporting Requirements\n          As discussed above, the Company shall file collected data regarding performance\nmeasures on a semi-annual basis, which filings shall coincide with the filing dates of the\nCommission's ESSQR form.          In addition to that filing, on March 1 of each year\nbeginning in 1999, the Company shall file a proposed reconciliation statement showing\nthe level of achievement with the established benchmarks to qualify for any part of the\nincentive pool. The filing shall be audited by an independent auditor prior to filing, and\nthe auditor's report shall be filed with the proposed reconciliation statement. If and when\nthe Commission approves the filing, the Company shall retain the appropriate portion of\nthe pool or refund the corresponding portion, plus appropriate taxes, to its Texas\ndistribution-level customers, as directed by the Commission.           SAID! and SAIFI\nperformance data shall be reported according to the following schedule: May through\nOctober data due on December 15; November through April data due on June 15 of each\nyear.\n\n3. Customer Service Performance Benchmarks\n\n\n          The performance measures listed below in Table 2 are drawn from General\nCounsel's recommendations, with the exception of security and street light replacement,\nwhich is based on a recommendation made by the Company . 130 In its reply brief, EGS\nadopted many of the components of General Counsel's recommended performance\nmeasures for customer service. 131 For the purposes of this remedial plan, each customer\nservice measure will be computed for the time interval noted in Table 2, and reported to\nthe Commission every six months, consistent with the filing dates for the service quality\nreports, as a separate Customer Service Report. If all five targets are achieved by EGS in\none given year, the customer service portion of the incentive pool will be retained by the\n\n\n\n130\n     General Counsel Ex. 7, Goodman Direct Testimony; General Counsel Ex. 5, Burrows Direct\nTestimony, Attachment JBG-8.\n131\n      EGS Reply Brief at 17-21.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                                 Page36\n\nCompany for that year; otherwise, that portion of the incentive pool, plus appropriate\ntaxes, will be refunded to distribution-level customers on a pro-rata basis.\n\n\nTable 2: Performance Targets for Customer Service Measures\nCustomer               Performance Target\nService Measure\nBilling-error rate    The Texas system average monthly rate of actual customer over-billing errors per\n                       1000 customers shall not exceed five.\nCall center           Seven days a week, 24 hours per day, on a monthly basis, in every EGS call\nperformance           center, 85 percent of the time, calls shall be answered within 30 seconds.\nService               In any distribution substation service area, 90 percent of applications for new\ninstallation          electric service and meters not involving line extensions or new facilities shall be\n                      filled within five working days, excluding those orders in which a later date is\n                      specifically requested by the customer.

On November 27, 1996, EGS filed with the Commission its transition/rate case in\nDocket No. 16705.\n\n2.      The Commission referred the case to SOAH on December 5, 1996. The\npreliminary order issued by the Commission on January 24, 1997, in Docket No. 16705\ndirected that the docket \"address specific service quality standards that will apply after\nthe transition [proposed by EGS].\"\n\n3.      On March 7, 1997, the Commission issued a supplemental preliminary order in\nDocket No. 16705 that focused specifically on service quality issues. That order\ndelineated three questions which must be addressed: (1) Whether EGS has an effective\nand prudent management policy in place that devotes sufficient resources to ensure\nadequate and reliable service to its ratepayers; (2) Whether there appear patterns of\nvariable service quality in EGS' service territory, and if so, what is the cause and\npotential resolution of these variations; (3) Whether the Commission should implement\nprocedures, and if so, what procedures can it implement, to monitor service quality on\nEGS' system, and to respond to situations in which EGS' service quality falls below the\nbenchmark levels.\n\n4.     SOAH segmented the hearings in Docket No. 16705 (SOAH Docket No. 473-96-\n2285) into four phases to address numerous transition and rate issues separately. The\nservice quality issues were scheduled for hearing in early November 1997, in the\n\"Competitive Issues\" phase of the case.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page39\n\n\n5.     At the November 4, 1997 Open Meeting, Chairman Pat Wood, III, and\nCommissioner Judy Walsh voted to sever the service quality issues from Docket No.\n16705 and determined that the Commission itselfwould hear and resolve these issues.\n\n6.     An order issued on November 4, 1997, established Docket No. 18249 to address\nthe service quality issues. The order also established procedures by which the\nCommission would hear and rule on the service quality issues directly.\n\n7.      Chairman Wood and Commissioner Walsh convened and presided over a public\nhearing on the merits on November 20 and 21, 1997, to address EGS' service quality\nissues. EGS, Cities, HLFCCG, and General Counsel submitted their testimony and\nexhibits into evidence and conducted cross-examination.       The Chairman and\nCommissioner Walsh also directed questions to the witnesses.\n\n8.     EGS, Cities, HLFCCG, and General Counsel filed post-hearing briefs in this\ndocket on December 2, 1997. Reply briefs were filed by these same parties on December\n9, 1997. The Office of Public Utility Counsel and the Attorney General's Office filed\nstatements on December 2 and 9, 1997, respectively, supporting the briefs of the Cities\nandHLFCCG.\n\n9.       The Commission issued its Final Order in this docket on February 13, 1998.\n\n10.      On March 5, 1998, General Counsel and EGS filed motions for rehearing.\n\n11.    At the March 19, 1998 open meeting, the Commission granted extensions to rule\non the motions for rehearing until May 14, 1998, and to file replies until March 25, 1998.\n\n12.    On March 25, 1998, a joint reply to motions for rehearing and motion for entry of\norder consistent with the parties' stipulation and agreement (the Stipulation) was filed\nand signed by General Counsel, EGS, HLFCCG, and OPUC.\n\n13.    The Commission granted rehearing at the April 1, 1998 open meeting and also\napproved the Stipulation.\n\nNotice\n\n14.    Hearings held on November 20 and 21, 1997, were properly noticed in accordance\nwith TEX. Gov'T CODE ANN.§§ 551.041, 551.043,2001.051, and 2001.052.\n\n15.    This matter was scheduled for discussion in open meetings convened on\nDecember 17, 1997, January 14, 1998, and April 1, 1998, for which notice ~as given\npursuant to TEx. Gov'TCODEANN. §§ 551.041 and 551.043.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                         Page40\n\n\n\n\n16.    EGS is a public utility subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission in\naccordance with PURA §§ 14.001, 31.001, 32.001, 33.122, and 36.001 through 36.156.\n\n17.    EGS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy, a holding company incorporated in\nDelaware and registered with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission in\naccordance with the Public Utility Holding Company Act.\n\n18.  Entergy acquired Gulf States Utilities, Inc., to create EGS, effective as of\nDecember 31, 1993.\n\n19.      EGS operates in Louisiana and Texas, and through its parent holding company is\naffiliated with investor-owned electric utilities located in Louisiana, Mississippi, and\nArkansas. Entergy's headquarters is located in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n20.    EGS' Texas service territory covers the southeastern part of the state. EGS'\nprincipal office in Texas is located in Beaumont.\n\nManagement Structure\n\n21.    In Beaumont, EGS employs, among others, a network manager and a reliability\nsupervisor. These managers report to a franchise director, also located in Beaumont.\n\n22.   The network manager's and reliability supervisor's responsibilities include\nmanaging and dealing with system reliability, outages, restoration, and vegetation\nmanagement.\n\n23.     The network managers report to the franchise director located in Beaumont, who\nreports to the senior vice president of distribution operations, employed by Entergy\nServices, Inc., and located in New Orleans.\n\n24.    In New Orleans, the vice president of distribution operations answers to a utility\ngroup president, who reports to a chief operating officer, and ultimately the chief\noperating officer of Entergy.\n\n25.     The network manager, reliability supervisor, and franchise director do not report\nto the EGS president, who has offices both in Austin and Beaumont.\n\n26.     The Company management structure is ill-suited to assure best supervision of the\nT&D system in the Texas territory. The supervisors in Texas answer to multiple directors\nin Louisiana, do not have all the necessary resources at their disposal, and their bonus\nincentives are tied in part to successful cost-cutting.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page 41\n\n\nTransmission System\n\n27. · The construction of EGS' transmission system started in 1924. Half of the\ntransmission lines currently in service were added in the 1950's and 1960's. Since 1977,\n12 percent of the lines have been newly built or rehabilitated.\n\n28.    The Commission finds that the physical state of EGS' transmission system is\nadequate; few transmission-related outages or circuit breaker operations occurred.\n\n29.    Transmission line ROW appear to be clear.\n\n30.     The EGS transmission system appears to provide adequate, continuous, and\nreliable service.\n\nPhysical Condition of Distribution System and Pole Inspection Program\n\n31.    EGS serves approximately 318,279 customers in Texas. The distribution system\nin the state is comprised of 11,472 miles of electric lines; 394,865 poles; and\napproximately 431 feeders.\n\n32.  EGS contracted with Osmose Wood Preserving Company to perform inspections\nofEGS poles and crossarms in Texas for the years 1995 and 1996.\n\n33.     In 1995 and 1996, Osmose field inspectors inspected a total of37,233 wood poles\nin eight different areas. The poles reviewed account for 9.4 percent of the total number of\npoles in EGS' Texas system.\n\n34.     Although the Osmose inspections focused on particularly troubled spots of the\ndistribution system in Texas, certain areas revealed a number of deficient poles that was\nexcessive by any measure.\n\n35.    Osmose survey results show wide fluctuations in percentages of poles with decay,\nfrom 8 to 37 percent, with the average percentage being 17.9 percent.\n\n36.     EGS proposes to implement a new pole inspection program, through which\napproximately 35,000 poles will be inspected annually, so that all poles in the Texas\njurisdiction will be inspected by the end ofthe lOth year.\n\n37.    General Counsel selected Drash Consulting Engineering Inc. to survey 33\nuniformly distributed substations from the Texas portion of the EGS distribution system.\n\n38.     General Counsel recommended that Drash inspect a representative sample of 591\npoles on feeders originating from these 33 substations, of which Drash visually surveyed\n582, or 98.42 percent, of poles.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                         Page 42\n\n\n39.     The Drash report picked for inspection approximately every 5th, lOth, or 15th\npole from the substation. The age of the poles was determined by visual inspection.\n\n40.    Drash filed its report on August 11, 1997, in which it identified 59 of 582 poles\nwith structural deficiencies, such as rot,· decay, or leaning, and 72 poles with\nencroachments by tree limbs and vegetation build-up.\n\n41.     The Drash survey did not use specific criteria by which to evaluate the condition\nof the poles, but relied on the inspectors' experience.\n\n42.     Beginning on May 12, 1997, the Commission Staff performed limited, random\ninspections of EGS' poles in the Vidor, Orange, Bridge City, Port Arthur, and Port\nNeches areas. The Staff inspections also encompassed the northern portion of the system\nto the western limits of EGS' service area.\n\n43.    By August 1997, the Commission Staff surveyed 60 poles, and found that 6.7\npercent had equipment deficiencies and 63 percent had ROW problems.\n\n44.     In general, the distribution system is in adequate condition; however, there are\nnumerous poles with decay, in need of repair or replacement, and many lines and poles\nthat need vegetation clearing.\n\n45.    The inspection program carried out by the Company has not been sufficiently\nextensive or adequate to fulfill its purpose of securing reliable service.\n\n46.    The Company's distribution system maintenance practices have failed to assure\ncontinuous and adequate service to EGS' customers.\n\nReliability Indices and Performance Standards\n\n47.     EGS uses the following standards and systems to collect and record performance\nmeasures: System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI); System Average\nInterruption Duration Index (SAIDI); Distribution Interruption System (DIS); TACTICS;\nand a System Control and Data Acquisition devise (SCADA). General Counsel also used\nthe Average System Availability Index (ASAI) as an outage measure.\n\n48.  EGS begins to record a specific outage only after a customer calls in to the\nCompany to complain. Timing of the outage duration starts after the customer alerts the\nCompany.\n\n49.     System-wide, the average customer in EGS' Texas territory experienced outages\ntotaling 133 minutes (as recorded in SAIDI) in 1996. The system-wide SAIFI in Texas\nfor 1996 was 2.648 interruptions.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                                           Page 43\n\n\n50.     Fifty of 431 feeders (11.6 percent) in the EGS' Texas system were below the\nminimum ASAI standard recommended by General Counsel (99.94 percent or 157\nminutes), while 37 (8.58 percent) feeders missed the minimum SAIFI standard of 3.8\ninterruptions per year.\n\n51.    Eighty-three feeders or primary circuits experienced outage times in excess of 200\nminutes during 1996.\n                                                                                           134\n52.    Eighteen feeders, serving 9,457 meters, are \"historically deficient\" for SAIFI,\nand seventeen feeders, serving 10,835 meters, are \"historically deficient\" for ASAI.\n\n53.    Nine percent of the meters did not meet minimum ASAI standards. Similarly, 10\npercent of the meters fell below minimum SAIFI benchmarks.\n\n54.    Customers on several feeders suffered significantly more interruptions than the\naverage customer, and with lengthier outages: feeders Tamina and China recorded SAIDI\nscores of 2,477 minutes and 934 minutes, respectively, while feeder Dobbin reached a\nSAIDI value of 699 minutes. Feeder Pleasure scored 10.2 interruptions, feeder Crystal\nhad a SAIFI of 8 interruptions, and Cordrey scored 7.56 interruptions.\n\n55.     Sixty-five feeders with approximately 58,000 customers have a SAIFI rating less\nthan the 10-year Company average.\n\n56.   EGS testified that it restores first those feeders with the highest numbers of\ncustomers. Likewise, it clears vegetation first on the feeders with the most customers.\n\n57.    EGS excluded certain data in calculating its reliability indices. In 1994, the\nCompany ceased counting outages in areas with less than 500 customers. For the first six\nmonths of 1996, the Company reported 35 to 40 percent fewer outages than were reported\non average during the first six months ofthe 1991-94 time-frame.\n\n58.    The average outage duration during the first three years after the merger went up\nto 2.4105 hours, from the average of 1.8220 hours during the seven years preceding the\nmerger.\n\n59.    By September 1996, the number of outages reported increased by 80 percent from\n1995, due to a greater number of small outages recorded.\n\n60.    EGS prepared a Reliability Report for the Southwest Region, issued in May 1994,\nthat summarized reliability performance for the year, compared actual performance with\nCompany goals, identified problem areas, and reported corrective actions.\n\n\n134\n   Historically deficient feeders are those with consistently poor performance over a period of several\nyears.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page44\n\n\n61.    Equipment failures were excluded from the May 1994 Reliability Index, as were\noutages attributed to public damage, non-preventable trees, load curtailment, transmission\nline outages, instantaneous outages, and planned outages. EGS began reporting these\ntypes of outages again in September 1995.                         ·\n\n62.     EGS excluded from its performance measures and reliability indices data\ncollected during episodes of extreme weather conditions in February 1994 and January\n1997.\n63.     The measure of outage duration does not take into account either the number of\ncustomers who fail to alert the Company to an outage, or the length of time a customer\nhas suffered an outage prior to notifying the Company.\n\n64.     Linemen working for or on behalf of EGS make subjective determinations as to\nthe cause, duration, or effect of an outage, which may hinder true and accurate reporting\nof the outage causes.\n\n65.    EGS records and reports its reliability and performance data based on system-\nwide measures. This method of reporting overlooks recurring individual feeder problems\nand pockets of disproportionately low service quality.\n\n66.     EGS is not technically equipped at the present time to measure SAIDI and SAIFI\nperformances at the individual customer level. The Company, however is able to\ncalculate performance indices on a feeder-by-feeder basis.\n\n67.     The Company's data and compiled indices are unreliable because of changing\ndata collection standards, failure to report all relevant information, and manipulation of\nthe data.\n\nVegetation Management\n\n68.     The purpose of vegetation management is to ensure to the extent possible that\nvegetation in or near ROW does not come into contact with the conductors and either\nbreak the wires or cause ground faults.\n\n69.      Many of the outages in EGS' service territory result from trees or tree limbs\nfalling into EGS' ROWs or distribution lines.\n\n70.    EGS stated that it has a six-year, rural tree-trimming cycle; it calls for a 20-foot\nclearance. Trees in urban areas, according to the Company, are trimmed on a three-year\ncycle. The Company did not offer persuasive evidence that these cycles were actually\nfollowed.\n\n71.   The Company stated that 80 percent of EGS' vegetation management\nexpenditures are allocated to cyclical tree trimming.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page45\n\n\n72.    Texas vegetation management expenses in the post-merger period were $4.99\nmillion in 1994, $5.09 million in 1995, and $4.735 million in 1996. The decrease in\nspending between 1995 and 1996 is attributed by the Company to unexplained efficiency\ngains.\n\n73.    The total line-miles actively maintained by the Company dropped approximately\n30 percent in 1996 from the 1994-1995 levels; EGS witnesses did not explain this\ndecrease.\n\n74.     Vegetation management spending increased by 34 percent in 1997, a significant\npart of which went towards the January 1997 ice storm cleanup costs.\n\n75.    Vegetation-related SAIDI and SAIFI values have worsened since the merger.\nSystem-wide SAIDI values for Texas have increased from 21.17 in 1994 to 40.36 in\n1997. SAIFI values have also increased from 0.31 in 1994 to 0.63 in 1997. As·of\nSeptember 1997, the SAIDI level for 1997 exceeded the SAIDI value for the entire year\nin 1996.\n\n76.     Network managers in EGS' Texas territory have the responsibility to ensure\nadequate service reliability. Network managers, however, do not directly supervise or\nfully control the vegetation management program.\n\n77.    A 1994 study by Environmental Consultants, Inc., (ECI) proposed specific\nrecommendations for EGS' vegetation management to include herbicide and tree\ntrimming based on plant species, equipment scheduling in the planning process,\naggressive pursuit of tree removals, and performance measures for contractors. EGS has\nnot implemented the recommendations proposed by ECI.\n\n78.     Entergy's Internal Audit department conducted a comprehensive risk assessment\nstudy of the vegetation management program in 1996, and concluded that sufficient\nstrategic planning had not occurred to ensure that Entergy met its objectives. The study\nalso found that the Alliance Agreement between Entergy and vegetation management\ncontractors was not being consistently applied in the various regions, and did not meet\nbusiness objectives.\n\n79.   Power lines cannot be shielded 100 percent from all contact with vegetation;\nhowever, the Company's inability to develop and carry out prudent vegetation\nmanagement policies has resulted in major service disruptions.\n\n80.     EGS' management structure does not provide those responsible for ensuring\nservice reliability with direct authority to address or prevent vegetation-related outages.\n\n81.      The Company does not have a strategic plan to guide vegetation management\nefforts.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                          Page 46\n\n\n82.     Neglect and backlog of vegetation management projects has posed unacceptable\nrisks of increasing and recurrent service outages, especially during major storms.\n\n83.    The Commission finds that the Company's vegetation management efforts have\nnot been adequate, have led to a backlog in vegetation clearing, and have resulted in an\nunacceptably high risk to the system.\n\nEmergency Preparedness, Response, and Outage Restoration\n\n84.      In June 1996, EGS conducted a drill simulating an emergency situation in order to\ntest its emergency response and restoration plans.\n\n85.    EGS' emergency plan and procedures are on file with the Commission, and were\nreviewed by the Commission Staff after the ice storm in January 1997.\n\n86.    In Docket No. 16301, Ice Storm '97 Field Investigations Project, the Commission\nStaff concluded that EGS had a good emergency plan in place before the ice storm of\nJanuary 1997.\n\n87.     The Commission defines \"major storm\" as a weather-related event in which there\nis a loss of power to 10 percent or more of the customers in a region over a 24 hour\nperiod and with all customers not restored within 24 hours.\n\n88.   EGS defines major storm as any event in which 10 percent or more of a region's\ncustomers are interrupted for 24 hours or more.\n\n89.    Many parts of Texas experienced an ice storm of significant magnitude that began\nearly on January 12, 1997, and lasted through the afternoon of January 13, 1997.\n\n90.     Most utilities in Texas experienced disruptions in service during the January 1997\nice storm.\n\n91.    EGS should have been better prepared to deal with the January 1997 ice storm,\ngiven that it had experienced major weather events in 1994 and 1995, and that it had\nsuccessfully conducted emergency drills in 1996.\n\n92.   During the ice storm in January 1997, up to 120,000 of EGS' Texas customers\nwere without power. Restoration took seven days to complete, with temporary\nemergency crews mobilized from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas.\n\n93.     By January 16, 1997, EGS had more than 2,700 personnel deployed to restore\nservice on various parts of its Texas system.\n\n94.   At the public hearing on November 20, 1997, city officials from the towns of Port\nNeches, Orange, and Nederland described numerous episodes in which the numbers of\n\f PUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                          Page 47\n\n\n EGS workers, equipment, and materials were insufficient to deal adequately with\n emergency situations. Other officials from Cleveland, Dayton, and Port Arthur gave\n favorable reports ofEGS' performance during the January 1997 ice storm.\n\n 95.    Mr. Dick Nugent, representing the city of Nederland, testified that after several\n attempts to reach EGS personnel, city officials had to retrieve an EGS supervisor from his\n house in Nederland to help them with power restoration efforts.\n\n 96.    Mr. A.R. Kimler, from the city of Port Neches, testified that local firefighters\n were deployed to cut down live power lines because EGS stated there were not enough\n employees to respond at the time.\n\n 97.  The impact of the January 1997 ice storm was greatly exacerbated by the\n Company's failure to maintain its ROW clear of excessive vegetation.\n\n 98.     While the Company has emergency plans in place, not all personnel are familiar\n with the plans, a fact that may have accounted for the Company's uneven and delayed\n restoration efforts during the January 1997 ice storm.\n\n· 99.     It may be uneconomic for EGS to build, operate, or maintain a 100 percent storm-\n  proof system. The January 1997 ice storm, however, revealed that EGS must implement\n  a better preventive maintenance program and faster customer response initiatives.\n\n 100. Segregation of major-storm data from non-major storm data in outage duration\n and frequency reports provides a more accurate method to evaluate EGS' performance on\n a day-to-day basis, as well as during crisis events.\n\n101. The standard for classifying major storms is to be defined in terms ofthe severity\nof the weather-related event, rather than in terms of the impact on the T&D system.\nFeeders subject to major storms can be defined as those experiencing an accumulation of\none inch of ice or more within a 24-hour period, or those exposed to winds of at least 80\nmph.\n\n102. EGS' outage restoration efforts during the January 1997 ice storm would have\nbeen more effective if: (1) EGS had been more diligent in its preventive vegetation\nmanagement practices; and (2) it had a better communication and management program\nin place to deal with emergency situations.\n\n103. The effect and incidence of lightning strikes did not matet;ially affect the quality\nof service offered by the Company.\n\nSpending Levels\n\n104. System-wide transmission spending followed a generally increasing trend since\n1992. No data was presented for transmission O&M expenditures on the Texas portion\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                           Page 48\n\nof the system.\n\n105. Between 1994 and 1996, distribution maintenance spending decreased by $4\nmillion each year. Half of these cuts ($2 million each year) came from the overhead line\nmaintenance spending.\n\n106. Miscellaneous distribution expenses recorded in Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission (FERC) Account 588 increased from just under $3 million in 1991-1993, to\n$10.3 million in 1995, and $12.4 million in 1996, an increase EGS could not explain.\n\n107. FERC has designated Account 588 for mapping, records, communications, and\nother miscellaneous expenses such as clerical, stenographic, and janitorial work at\nbuildings.\n\n108. EGS decreased its level of spending for pole and appurtenance replacements by\n50 percent during the years 1995 and 1996.\n\n109. EGS' O&M spending has been uneven, lacks clear accounting, and\nproportionately more is spent on distribution capital additions than on distribution system\nmaintenance.\n\n110. In 1995, most of the spending for distribution capital additions was in the\nLouisiana area.\n\n111. Efficiency savings have not been identified nor proven in areas where spending\nlevels had been reduced.\n\n112. The Company witness could not explain whether any of the savings from the\nunspent T&D budget were credited according to the Entergy/GSU merger agreement\n(PUC Docket No. 11292).\n\nPersonnel Levels\n\n113. The Company has carried out substantial cuts in the number of employees\nassigned to T&D operations: 95 distribution employees in 1995-1996 and 26 in 1997.\nEGS has increased its use of contract workers during the same periods for a total net\ndecrease of 42 permanent linemen and servicemen since the merger.\n\n114. Since the merger, most the terminated T&D employees were replaced with\ncontract workers. Sixty-six of the terminated T&D employees had on average of 18 years\nexperience with the Company.\n\n115. The Company has no performance measures to evaluate contract-worker\nefficiency.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                      Page 49\n\n116. The ratio of contract employees to permanent linemen and servicemen is now 2:1.\nThe Commission does not oppose the use of contract employees. The present ratio of\ncontract employees to permanent staff, however, is high, particularly in light of the\nextensive experience lost when many of the permanent employees were laid-off.\n\n11 7. EGS is expected to structure its line maintenance and vegetation management\nprograms in such a way that adequate numbers of properly trained and supervised\nemployees are promptly available.\n\n118. EGS hired 30 additional contract crews in October 1997, specifically to remedy a\nbacklog of vegetation management projects.\n\n119. The Company lacks a clearly stated strategic plan for vegetation management, and\npriorities are driven primarily by budget considerations.\n\nCustomer Service\n\n120. An EGS customer survey reveals that satisfaction results decreased among all\nclasses of ratepayers and for all components of service from 1995 to 1996, as more\ncustomers classified EGS service as \"fair\" or \"bad\" than \"very good\" or \"helpful.\"\n\n121: EGS did not track customer complaints prior to 1995, nor did it track customer\nservice performance standards. EGS began a complaint management system in January\n1997 to document every complaint called in to the Company.\n\n122. The Company's automated voice response unit, substituted for live employees,\nhas not led to increased customer satisfaction.\n\n123. EGS has failed to implement sufficient customer service procedures and has a\nhigh number of dissatisfied customers.\n\n124. The Company also has, by its own admission, pockets of particularly inadequate\nservtce.\n\n125. In a letter dated September 19, 1997, State Representative Mark Stiles wrote to\nthe Commission expressing concern over an increase in the number of EGS customers\nwho contacted him to complain of poor service by EGS.\n\n126. EGS acknowledges that it has a large number of customers who remain\nunsatisfied with their customer service.\n\n127. EGS' customer service quality is clearly deficient based on the numerous\ncomplaints to the Commission and Texas Legislature, and as indicated in the Company's\nown survey data.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                            Page 50\n\n\nStipulation\n\n128. In the Stipulation, filed by parties on March 25, 1998, and approved by the\nCommission at the April 1, 1998 open meeting, the parties, among other provisions,\nagreed to: (1) lower the compliance level for SAIDI and SAIFI minimum acceptable level\nto 98.5 percent; (2) make the reporting and evaluation periods consistent with the Electric\nSystem Service Quality Report form; (3) provide for a possible review of customer\nservice targets; (4) change the selection process of the auditor; and (5) change the due\ndate of the quality assurance proposal to August 16, 1998.\n\n129. The Stipulation addressed only some of the issues raised by the parties in the\nmotions for rehearing. However, at the April 1, 1998 open meeting, the EGS\nrepresentative indicated that if the Commission adopted the Stipulation as drafted, the\nparties would not appeal the Order.\n\n\nB. Conclusions ofLaw\n\n 1.     Entergy Gulf States, Inc., (EGS) 1s a public utility as defmed in PURA\n'§ 31.002(1).\n\n2.     The Commission has jurisdiction over issues addressed in this Order in\naccordance with PURA §§ 14.001, 31.001, 32.001, 33.122, 36.001-36.151, and 38.071.\n\n3.     The Commission has jurisdiction over all matters relating to the conduct of a\nhearing in this case, in accordance with PURA § 14.051.\n\n4.     This Order is issued in accordance with TEX. Gov'TCODEANN. § 2001.141.\n\n5.       PURA § 37.151(2) requires that EGS provide continuous and adequate service in\nits certificated service territory.\n\n6.     EGS is obligated, pursuant to PURA § 38.001, to furnish service,\ninstrumentalities, and facilities that are safe, adequate, efficient; and reasonable.\n\n7.    EGS has failed to provide continuous and adequate service to many of its\ncustomers, as required by PURA §§ 37.151(2) and 38.001.\n\n8.     In establishing a reasonable return on invested capital, the Commission is\nrequired, among other things, to consider the quality of the utility's service. PURA\n§ 36.052(3).\n\n9.

Upon issuance of a final order in EGS' pending rate case in Docket No.\n         16705, the Company shall calculate the revenues equal to 60~basis points,\n         and appropriate taxes, of the ROE established in Docket No. 16705.\n\n      2. Within 30 days after issuance of the final order in Docket No. 16705, the\n         Company shall submit to the Commission its calculation of the revenues\n         equal to 60~basis points, and appropriate taxes, for Commission review and\n         approval.\n\n      3. If a rate reduction is ordered in Docket No. 16705, the Company shall refund\n         to its customers an amount equal to 60-basis points of its ROE authorized in\n         Docket No. 16705, plus appropriate taxes, for the period from June 1, 1996,\n         through the effective date of this Order. 135\n\n      4. As of the effective date of this Order, the Company shall reduce collections\n         from customers by an amount equal to 30-basis points, and appropriate\n         taxes, of the ROE authorized in Docket No. 16705.\n\n      5. As of the effective date of this Order, the Company shall establish an\n         interest~bearing escrow account into which it shall deposit, on an on~going\n         basis, the amount equal to 30~basis points, and appropriate taxes, of its ROE\n         authorized in Docket No. 16705.\n\n      6.

The Company shall file a quality assurance proposal governing the\n     collection, recording, and reporting of SAID! and SAIFI, and any other\n     relevant service quality measures by August 16, 1998. This filing deadline\n     shall be extended one day for every day the consultant's report addressing\n     the EGS distribution system is filed beyond July 16, 1998.\n\n  8. Twice annually, and starting on June 15, 1998, the Company shall file the\n     Electric System Service Quality Report, including its supplemental filing, to\n     document SAID! and SAIFI feeder-by-feeder data for each six-month\n     period, calculated in the manner discussed in this Order. The Company shall\n     also submit a listing of the worst performing 10 percent of the Company's\n     feeders, twice annually along with their performance data. Beginning on\n     December 15, 1998, and twice annually thereafter, at the same time as the\n     Electric System Service Quality Reports, the Company shall file its\n     Customer Service Reports, relating to service installations, line extensions,\n     and light replacements. Initial Customer Service Reports related to the\n     remaining customer service measures (billing-error rate and call center\n     performance) shall be· due on June 15, 1998. In its December filing each\n     year, the Company shall provide an annual, audited summary of customer\n     performance data.\n\n  9. Beginning in 1999, and no later than March 1 of that and each subsequent\n     year, the Company shall file with the Commission its reconciliation proposal\n     for the funds held in escrow according to this Order for the prior calendar\n     year. The Company's annual filing shall be audited by an independent\n     auditor, and the audit shall be filed with the reconciliation proposal.\n\n  10. If the Commission determines that the Company has achieved the\n      performance s~dards set out in this Order for a minimum acceptable level\n      of improvement for SAIDI and SAIFI for the 10 percent of worst feeders\n      and, if applicable, major-storm restoration process, the Company may retain\n      one-third of the amount in escrow for that year; otherwise, the Company\n      shall refund that amount, plus appropriate taxes, to its Texas distribution-\n      level customers taking service from the non-complying feeders, as explained\n      in section D(1) and D(2)(b) of this Order. If the Commission determines that\n      the Company has achieved the performance standards set out in this Order\n      for the target level improvement for SAID! and SAIFI, the Company may\n      retain one-third of the amount in escrow for that year, otherwise, the\n      Company shall refund that amount, plus appropriate taxes, to all its Texas\n      distribution-level customers, divided on a pro-rata basis within each\n      customer class. If the Commission determines that the Company has\n      achieved the performance standards set out in this Order for customer\n      service, the Company may retain one-third of the amount in escrow for that\n      year; otherwise, the Company shall refund that amount, plus appropriate\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 18249 ORDER ON REHEARING                                            Page 53\n\n\n      taxes, to its Texas distribution-level customers divided on a pro-rata basis\n      within each customer class.\n\n   11. In conjunction with its annual reconciliation filing, the Company shall\n       submit a proposal for customer notification. At a minimum, the proposal\n       shall include the content and format for a billing insert that explains the\n       service quality requirements, the Company's performance for the preceding\n       year, street light reporting instructions and telephone number, and the\n       amount of the escrow pool retained by the Company and/or refunded to\n       customers.\n\n  12. The Company shall develop and implement, within the six months of the\n      effective date of this Order, a media campaign to inform and educate\n      customers in its Texas service territory about the importance and proper\n      procedure for reporting to the Company malfunctioning or broken street\n      lights.\n\n  13.

Introduction\n\n        The SOAH ALJs conducted separate evidentiary hearings on the four component parts of\nthis docket: fuel, revenue requirement, cost allocation/rate design, and competitive issues. After\ncompletion of the hearings and review of the record evidence, the ALJs recommended that the\nCommission order EGS to reduce its current Texas retail base rates by $137 million, which\n\n        1\n         Application of Entergy Corporation and Gulf States Utilities Company for Sale, Transfer or Merger,\nDocketNo.11292, 19 P.U.C. BULL. 2040,2041 (Ordering Paragraph 5) (Dec. 29, 1993).\n        2\n            The ALJs issued the PFD on March 25, 1998, as revised by clarifications, revised text, and revised\nschedules filed on June 4, 12, and 16, 1998. The ALJs issued the SPFD, which addresses supplemental fuel-related\nissues, on March 27, 1998. The Commission considered the matters addressed in this Order at its open meetings\nconvened on June 30, July 8 through 10, July 13, July 16, and July 22, 1998. The Commission issued its \"fmal\"\norder in this docket on July 22, 1998. The Commission considered motions for rehearing at its open meetings\nconvened on August 26, and October 8, 1998. A more detailed procedural history of this case is contained in\nAttachment A to the PFD and the Findings of Fact (FoF) and Conclusions of Law (CoL), as modified, contained in\nthis Order.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                       Second Order on Rehearing                                Page2 oflSS\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\nrepresents a 29% reduction from current base rates.                   The rationale for this recommended\nreduction is set forth in detail in the PFD and SPFD which, together, total over 800 pages.\n\n         In this Order, the Commission directs EGS to reduce its Texas retail base rates in\nconformance with the attached schedules (approximately $111 million, or $26 million less than\nthe reduction recommended by the ALJs). This base rate reduction, and the Commission's\nrationale for modifying portions of the PFD and SPFD, are explained in detail in the Discussion\nsection of this Order. In this Introduction, the Commission focuses primarily on the three most\ncontentious issues in this docket: (1) treatment of EGS' claimed affiliate expenses; (2) the\ntreatment of EGS' \"excess costs over market\" (referred to either as \"ECOM'' or \"potentially\nstranded investment\"); and (3) interruptible service.\n\n                                          A.       Affiliate Expenses\n\n         The ALJs concluded in the PFD that EGS failed to meet its statutory burden of proof to\njustify recovery of approximately $86 million in Texas retail affiliate expenses. The ALJs\ntherefore recommended that the Commission disallow all of these claimed costs.3 This $86\nmillion in recommended disallowed expenses is comprised of $49 million billed to EGS by its\ncorporate service affiliate, Entergy Services, Inc. (ESI), or allocated to EGS by its nuclear service\naffiliate, Entergy Operations, Inc. (EOI), plus an additional $37 million direct-billed to-EGS by\nEOI. 4 In the alternative to a full disallowance, the ALJs recommended that the Commission\ncould potentially justify allowing EGS to recover the direct-billed EOI affiliate expenses ($37\nmillion), but that the record clearly required disallowance of the $49 million in ESI and EOI\nallocated expenses. (To avoid confusion, this Order refers to the ESI billed and EOI allocated\nexpenses as the $49 million in disallowed \"ESI\" expenses; the $37 million in EOI direct billed\nexpenses are referred to as the \"EOI'' expenses.) In this Order, the Commission adopts the ALJs'\n\n\n\n         3\n            For convenience, this Introduction refers only to the Texas retail affiliate expenses claimed by EGS. The\nCompany's application and the PFD actually refer primarily to \"system-wide\" affiliate expenses in the range of\n$200 million. The system-wide expenses include affiliate expenses allocable to EGS' services in Louisiana,\nservices in the Texas wholesale market, and services in the Texas retail market.\n         4\n           The complexity· of the affiliate transactions affecting EGS (previously Gulf States Utilities, Inc. (GSU))\nsignificantly increased when Entergy Corporation purchased GSU in 1993, thereby creating EGS.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                         Second Order on Rehearing                          Page t 1 nf 155\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\nare now declining. By allowing the Company to surcharge the AOD expense over a three-year\nperiod, the Commission moves closer to intergenerational equity than would occur if future\ncustomers are required to pay the AOD over the remaining life of River Bend. Thus, the\nCommission's treatment both mitigates EGS' ECOM and better matches the recovery period for\nthe AOD to the time period in which the AOD would normally have been expensed.\n\n                                        C.       Interruptible Service\n\n        The Commission concludes that the current demand charge credits provided to the\ninterruptible service (IS) customers will not be subject to partial imputation as recommended by\nthe ALJs. The current IS demand and energy charges also will not be reduced in tandem with the\nbase rate reductions applicable to firm customers. Instead, the demand and energy charges to IS\ncustomers, under the IS rider, will be frozen at current levels. This treatment results in the IS\ncustomers continuing to receive interruptible service at rates below firm service, but narrows the\ndemand charge credit as base rates for finn customers are reduced. Also, by freezing the energy\ncharges billed to IS customers under the IS rider, the Commission is ensuring that IS customers\nare allocated their fair share of transmission costs and, where applicable, distribution costs.\n\n                                   D.         Overall Effect of this Order\n\n        The Commission affirms the majority ofthe PFD, but concludes that the record evidence\nrequires modification to a number of findings and conclusions reached by the ALJs. In addition\nto the modification summarized above, the Commission modifies the ALJs' recommendations to\nconclude that (1) EGS' wheeling expenses and revenues should be subject to base rate treatment,\nrather than fuel reconciliation and fuel surcharges; (2) in recognition of the remedies established\nin EGS service quality case,45 the Company's rate ofreturn on equity (ROE) will be set at 11.1%\nfor the period June 1, 1996 through May 12, 1998, and at 11.4% from May 13, 1998 through the\n                                                                           26\nremainder of the effective period of the rates in this docket;                  and (3) the Company is also\n\n\n        25\n           Entergy GUlf States, Inc.

As stated by General Counsel, \"[t]he Commission therefore should not disallow\nimprudent fuel costs related to EGS's failure to burn fuel oil, on the one hand, and refuse to\ninclude the fuel oil in inventory, on the other.\"60\n\n        The Commission agrees with General Counsel and EGS; if the February 1996 natural gas\nexpenses are to be disallowed as imprudent (which they are, as discussed below), the Company\nshould be permitted to recover the costs of the No.6 fuel oil that it should have burned in lieu of\nthe disallowed high cost natural gas. Accordingly, to reflect the preponderance of evidence in\nthe record, FoF 117 is modified and F oF 117A is added to fmd that the fuel oil working capital in\nrate base is $5,110,085, rather than $2,085,630.\n\n5.      Return on Equity\n\n        The Commission affirms the ALJs' recommendation to set the Company's ROE at 11.7%\nin this docket with the following modifications. First, the Commission acknowledges that an\nappropriate range for EGS' ROE is 9.65% to 13.94%. This range is based on both the constant\ngrowth and the multi-stage non-constant growth discounted cash flow (DCF) analyses. As the\nALJs recognized, using both of these models more closely resembles the balance employed by\nthe Commission in Docket No. 14965. Accordingly, FoFs 128 and 129 are modified, New FoF\n128A is added, and FoFs 130-132 are deleted. Additionally, the Commission modifies FoF 134\nto reflect that, although adjustments to EGS' ROE were not modified in this case for poor\ndemand-side management and affiliate transactions, the Conunission retains full discretion to\nmake such adjustments in a future case.\n\n        Second, a new FoF 128B is added to reduce the 11.7% ROE by 60 basis points to 11.1%\nfor the period June 1, 1996 through May 12, 1998, and by 30 basis points to 11.4% from May 13,\n1998 through the remainder of the period in which the rates subject to this docket are in effect.\nThis bifurcated ROE reduction is required by the Commission's determinations in the related\n\n        60\n             See General Counsel's Brief on Exceptions at 18.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                       Second Order on Rehearing                       Page 30 oft 55\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\nEGS Service Quality proceeding (Docket No. 18249), which concluded that the ROE ultimately\nauthorized in this docket (Docket No. 16705) would be reduced permanently by 60 basis points\nfrom the date refunds become effective in this docket \"through the effective date of [the final\norder in Docket No. 18249].\"61 After the effective date of the fmal order in Docket No. 18249\n(that is, May 12, 1998), the authorized ROE in Docket No. Hi705 is increased by 30 basis points\nto 11.4%, but the Company must escrow that 30 basis points of ROE. As provided in EGS\nService Quality, the Company will be pennitted to retain up to the full amount of the escrowed\n30 basis points if it meets certain service quality benchmarks established in that proceeding. 62 If\nit does not meet those benchmarks, some portion or all of the escrowed amount will be refunded\nto customers, thus effectively resulting in a minimum ROE of 11.1 %. These ROE reductions are\nnot predicated on a finding that the ALJs erred in recommending the 11.7% ROE. Rather, they\nare based on the Commission's rulings in EGS Service Quality. Accordingly, new FoF 128B is\nnot a modification to the ALJs' ROE recommendation subject to APA § 2003.049(g), but rather\nis made to conform the ROE in this docket to the rulings in Docket No. 18249.\n\n        Third, the reduction to the Company's authorized ROE also results in a reduction to the\nALJs' recommended return on invested capita1. 63 This authorized overall return dollar amount is\ntherefore reduced as reflected on the attached Commission Schedules I and IV. In addition, FoFs\n134 and 135 are modified respectively to clarify that only the direct-billed EOI expenses are\napproved in this docket, and to reflect the adjustment to the overall cost of capital as a result of\nthe Commission's decisions in EGS Service Quality.\n\n6.      Amortization Expense\n\n        The amortization expense reflected on Schedule I must be decreased to reflect the\nremoval of $9 million in annual amortization expenses related to the AOD discussed in the\n\n\n        61\n             EGS Service Quality Order on Rehearing at 51 (Ordering Paragraph 3).\n        62\n             Id at Ord~ring Paragraph 5.\n        63\n              This figure is the corrected amount reflected in Schedules I and IV of the ALJs' June 12, 1998\nclarification. The original PFD recommends a slightly higher figure. PFD at 317.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                Second Order on Rehearing                     Page 54 of 155\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\nbefore the next fuel reconciliation. Therefore, EGS is not required to file a fuel reconciliation\nwith the November 1998 rate case, and a good cause exception to the rate case filing requirement\nis granted accordingly. The SOAR ALJs assigned to the next case will address the procedural\nissues raised by EGS.     Otherwise, EGS- should be prepared to address any other revenue\nrequirement and major rate design issues in the November 1998 rate case. Accordingly, FoFs\n96R through 96U are added to clarify this issue.\n\n        Finally, EGS has not proposed to recover its rate case expenses or the Cities' rate case\nexpenses in this docket. The question remained whether the Company might attempt to recover\nthese expenses in a future docket.     At the Commission's open meeting on July 10, 1998,\nrepresentatives of EGS committed orally on the record that the Company will not seek to recover\nCities' or its own rate case expenses in this proceeding or any future proceeding. Accordingly, a\nFoF 164 is modified and a new FoF 164A is added to reflect this commitment.\n\n                       IV.    Findings ofFact and Conclusions ofLaw\n\n        The section consolidates the FoFs and CoLs contained in both the PFD and SPFD, as\nmodified in accordance with the foregoing discussion. The numbering sequence contained in the\nPFD is retained; the SPFD FoFs and CoLs are integrated into this sequence by placing them in\nthe proper location and changing the SPFD number to a corresponding numbered and lettered\ndesignation. The designation \"SFoF\" refers to the fmdings in the Supplemental PFD. The\nreferences to \"Revised PFD\" refer to the corrected pages to the PFD filed by the ALJs on June 4,\n1998.\n                                      A. Findings of Fact\n\n1.      Entergy Gulf States, Inc. (EGS) is an electric utility serving southeast Texas and south\n        central Louisiana and is one of five wholly-owned operating companies of the Entergy\n        Corporation, an investor-owned public utility holding company headquartered in New\n        Orleans, Louisiana.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                Second Order on Rehearing                    Page 79 of 155\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n       Property Insurance Reserve Balance\n120.   The reasonable and necessary reserve balance in rate base for property insurance should\n       be ($15,572,000).\n\n\n       Other Adjustments to Invested Capital\n121.   Based on an amortization period ending January 31, 2000, the test year amortization\n       expense for deferred fmancing costs would increase by $5,903,700, and amortization\n       expense for property cancellation loss for River Bend 2 would decrease by $1,365,396,\n       for a net increase in test year amortization of$4,538,304.\n\n\n122.   No expenditures necessary to produce cost savings related to the merger between EGS\n       and Entergy Corporation should be reflected in rate base consistent with the decision to\n       disallow all such costs.\n\n\n123.   From April 1994 through the end of the test year, June 30, 1996, EGS collected\n       $36,205,679 on a total Company basis for post-retirement expenses other than pensions\n       (OPEBs). This amount should not be reduced by EGS' OPEB trust funds, as EGS has\n       not had access to the funds with which to fund rate base.\n\n\n124.   The following are appropriate adjustments to EGS' requested level of invested capital:\n       Accmmt                        13 Mo. Ayg.            Adjustment           Total Level\n       Injuries and Damages           ($5,543,000)           $643,000              ($4,899,000)\n       Coal Car Maint. Reserve        ($4,071 ,000)             ($91,000)          ($4,162,000)\n       Customer Deposits             ($21,510,000)          ($g60,000)           ($22,370,000)\n       Contractor Retainage             ($455,000)               11,000              ($444,000)\n\n\n       Cost of Capital\n125.   EGS' cost of capital should be based on a capital structure consisting of 48.06% long-\n       term debt, 2.16% QUIPS, 6.52% preferred stock, and 43.26% common equity.\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705               Second Order on Rehearing                      Page 83 of 155\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n       Employee Pensions and Benefits\n142.   Total electric pension expense should reflect a 3.5% assumed salary escalation factor, an\n       eight percent discount rate, and an adjustment to reflect the declining employee levels\n       through January 1997.\n\n\n143.   EGS' reasonable and necessary pension expense through January 1997 is ($3,161,011).\n       (See Revised PFD.)\n\n\n144.   Post-retirement benefits other than pension should be $8,800,267 for total electric. This\n       includes a medical cost trend rate of 7.9%, an eight percent discount rate, and employee\n       levels through January 1997. It is not reasonable to permit a utility to recover estimated\n       costs that exceed by any large degree the actual costs experienced in the test year. The\n       $8.8 million level of expense reasonably approximates EGS' test year OPEB expense.\n\n\n       Production Operation and Maintenance Expense\n\n145.   EGS included $136,327,381 in production O&M expense, of which $51,491,665 relates\n       to fossil plants. Production O&M expense for its Big Cajun II Unit 3 plant should be\n       $6,428,935, which amounts to a $5,921,024 reduction from EGS' requested O&M\n       expense for this plant.    Using EGS' revised figures based on the FERC Form 1\n       methodology achieves a reasonable total fossil plant O&M expense of$45,570,641.\n\n\n       Insurance Expense\n146.   EGS' reasonable insurance expense is $1,651,321 per year for current losses.          With\n       regard to current losses, EGS should accrue only enough each year to cover typical storm\n       damage. (See Revised PFD.)\n\fPUC DOCKET NO. 16705                 Second Order on Rehearing                     Page 84 of 155\nSOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n147.   Any reduction to the reserve fund occurring after the test year should not be considered in\n       this case because EGS did not prove a reasonable post-test-year level for its existing\n       reserve fund or that the amount expended in 1997 to reduce the fund was prudent or\n       appropriate. Reserve fund levels following the test year in this case can be addressed in\n       EGS' November 1998 rate filing when all parties will have the opportunity to evaluate\n       the reasonableness of changes to the insurance reserve fund.\n\n\n       Mfiliate Expenses\n148.   Under PURA § 11.003(2), a utility's affiliates include any entity owning five percent or\n       more of a utility and any entity in which the holding company has a five percent\n       ownership interest. Accordingly, Entergy Service, Inc. (ESI) and Entergy Operations,\n       Inc. (EOI), subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation, are EGS' affiliates. Entergy Services,\n       Inc. provides numerous services ranging from administrative functions to providing fuel\n       supplies to Entergy's various affiliates. Entergy Operations, Inc. is responsible for the\n       management, operation, and support of the five nuclear generating units owned by the\n       Entergy operating companies.\n\n\n149.   EGS provided evidence of ESI expenses based on the total of all expenses charged.\n       Neither proof by an aggregate finding as to total expenses nor total expenses for that\n       affiliate is viable in this docket--because so many services are provided by ESI, the\n       quantity and diversity of these costs is enormous and involve thousands of items billed\n       during the test-year period.      For this reason, EGS must provide evidence of the\n       reasonableness and necessity of its affiliate expense in strict compliance with Section\n       36.058 of PURA. That is, it must provide evidence supporting the reasonableness and\n       necessity of these expenses by class of costs. It failed to do this.\n\f             Appendix6\n\n\n         PUC Docket No. 39896,\n   Hearing on the Merits Transcript:\nExcerpts of Direct and Cross---Examination\n    of ETI Witness Shawn Corkran\n\f               SOAH DOCKET NO.

I have a few questions for you about the\n12   1997 ice storm that Entergy is requesting recovery from\n13   customers.     Okay?\n14       A    Okay.\n15       Q    But before we get to that, I want to talk a\n16   little bit about an order you reference in your rebuttal\n17   testimony, and that's the order in Docket 18249.          Do you\n18   recall referencing that order?\n19       A    Yes, I do.\n20       Q    And Docket 18249 was a case established by the\n21   Commission to address the service quality issues of\n22   Entergy Gulf States.     Isn't that right?\n23       A    That's my understanding.\n24       Q    And in that case, the Commission ultimately\n25   determined that the quality of Entergy's electric\n\n                    KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                              512.474.2233\n\f                                                              Page 570\n\n 1   service to its customers was poor.          Isn't that right?\n 2       A       Yes; I understand they identified deficiencies.\n 3       Q       Okay.     So in order to remedy the Company's\n 4   service quality issues, the Commission ordered an\n 5   incentive program to encourage the Company to fix its\n 6   problems.     Isn't that right?\n 7       A       By \"incentive program,\" are you referring to\n 8   the 60 bases point reduction and then the ability to\n 9   limit some of that?\n10       Q       There was -- yeah, we'll get to that, but there\n11   was an incentive plan, wasn't there, ordered as part of\n12   that case?     And if it helps you, I can bring you a copy\n13   of the order and point you to the page, if you'd like.\n14       A       Okay.     Yes, sir, I'd like to see that just to\n15   remind me and refresh me.\n16                       JUDGE BURKHALTER:   And, Mr. Corkran, I'm\n17   having a hard time hearing you.\n18                       WITNESS CORKRAN:    Okay.\n19                       JUDGE BURKHALTER:    Thank you.\n20                       MR. MACK:   May I approach the witness?\n21                       JUDGE BURKHALTER:    Yes.\n22       Q       (BY MR. MACK)       And I'm directing you to Page 28\n23   of the Final Order on Rehearing in Docket No. 18249.\n24   Okay?\n25       A       Okay.\n\n                    KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                              512.474.2233\n\f                                                                  Page 571\n\n 1       Q      And could you just -- and basically what it\n 2   says is,   11\n                     The Commission concludes that the Company's\n 3   service quality must be improved.           The following\n 4   incentive plan lays out the remedies to help EGS achieve\n 5   such improvements.      11\n                                   Isn't that correct?\n 6       A      Yes, that's correct.\n\n 7       Q      And that's the incentive plan I'm referring to.\n 8       A      Okay.     And I'm familiar with that, yes, sir.\n\n 9       Q      Okay.     And I think you just mentioned as part\n10   of that incentive plan the Commission ordered a\n11   reduction to Entergy's ROE.           Is that right?\n12       A      That's my understanding.\n13       Q      And if Entergy met some of its              some of the\n14   goals in this order, it could earn some of that back.\n15   Isn't that right?\n16       A      Yes, sir.         That's what I understand.\n17       Q      All right.         But you understand that this\n18   incentive program was only meant to fix the problem of\n19   Entergy's service quality.           Is that right?\n\n20       A      Yes.      As I understand, it was focused on a\n21   number of areas of service quality that touched into the\n22   reliability areas, call center performance.              There were\n23   several areas in that service quality area.\n\n24       Q      And nothing in this order determined who should\n25   be responsible for paying for the damage and outages\n\n                       KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                 512.474.2233\n\f                                                                       Page 572\n\n 1   caused by the service quality issues.              Isn•t that right?\n 2           A    I•m not aware, no.\n 3           Q    Are you aware whether the order addressed the\n 4   1997 ice storm?\n\n 5           A    I•m aware that it was referenced in some of the\n 6   findings, but I don•t know specifically when you say\n 7   11\n          addressed 11 what you mean by   11\n                                               addressed.   11\n                                                                 I mean, I\n 8   understand it was referenced in the order and in the\n 9   project.\n10           Q    And you said you read the order and you•re\n11   familiar with it?\n12           A    I have read it, yes.\n13           Q    Well, one issue that the ALJs and the\n14   Commission will have to address in this case is who\n15   should be responsible for paying for the damage caused\n16   by the 1997 ice storm.         Isn•t that right?\n\n17           A    Yes, I believe so.\n\n18           Q    And in this order that you reference in your\n19   rebuttal testimony, I believe the Commission found that\n20   the damage caused was greatly exacerbated by the\n21   Company•s service quality issues.              Isn•t that right?\n22           A    That•s -- I understand that finding, yes.\n23           Q    And the expense we•re talking about for this\n24   1997 ice storm in this case is 13 million?\n\n25           A    That•s correct.\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                         Page 573\n\n 1       Q    And that's what the Company is requesting\n 2   recovery for from its customers?\n 3       A    Yes.\n 4       Q    And I believe it's your position in the\n 5   rebuttal that even though the Company's service quality\n 6   issues was a major factor in the number and duration of\n 7   outages, it's the customers that should have to pay\n 8   100 percent of these costs.     Is that right?\n\n 9      A     That's my position, yes.\n10       Q    Now, since this case, has Entergy improved its\n11   quality of service?\n12       A    Yes, sir, we have.\n13       Q    So would it be true that the expenses incurred\n14   ln the 1997 ice storm, if that same storm were to happen\n15   today, would not be as great?\n16      A     I'm not certain.     I mean, you know, the finding\n17   of fact that was in the docket indicated that probably\n18   would be the case.\n19       Q    Okay.   And if we can rely on that finding of\n20   fact of the Commission to be accurate, if the same storm\n21   were to occur now or in the future, the expense level\n22   wouldn't be as great.   Is that right?\n23       A    I mean, it's difficult to say.     You know, there\n24   was a lot of information given with respect to\n25   vegetation in particular exacerbating the issue, but I'm\n\n                 KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                           512.474.2233\n\f                                                           Page 574\n\n 1   also aware that we had icing in the range of one to\n 2   three inches, which was very significant and exceeded\n 3   our design criteria and also exceeded the design\n 4   criteria of the NESC, the National Electric Safety Code.\n 5                    So, yes, while there were things that did\n 6   exacerbate the damage, it's difficult for me to say\n 7   that, you know,    it would be -- you know,   I can't tell\n 8   you how much worse.     I understand it exacerbated it and\n 9   made it somewhat worse, but it's difficult to say.\n\n10       Q    But it's your testimony that Entergy has\n11   greatly improved its quality of service issues since\n\n12   that case?\n13       A    We have.\n\n14       Q    All right.     Are you aware of a Company witness\n\n15   named Gregory Wilson?\n\n16       A    Yes,    I'm aware of the name.\n\n17       Q    And in this case, I'll submit to you he\n18   performs a study to estimate an annual level of expense\n19   for projected storms.     Are you aware of that?\n\n20       A    Yes.\n\n21       Q    Okay.     And to the extent he were to include the\n22   full amount of the 1997 ice storm in his analysis, that\n23   would not be correct, would it, since the Company has\n24   improved its service quality issues -- quality of\n25   service issues?     I'm sorry.\n\n                  KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                            512.474.2233\n\f                                                                 Page 575\n\n 1       A      I'm not sure I understand your question.          Help\n 2   me understand the question.\n 3       Q      All right.\n 4       A      Are you saying that his analysis is based on\n 5   the performance from the early --\n\n 6       Q      Do you know whether he has included in his\n 7   analysis for estimating future storms the full amount of\n 8   the 1997 ice storm?\n\n 9       A      I really do not know.        I'm aware that he\n10   testified in this case, but I'm not familiar with his\n11   testimony.       I mean, you know, particularly I was focused\n12   on the costs associated with the recovery and, you know,\n13   how they -- how they really tied to what we saw in the\n14   field.     I'm not real familiar with Mr. Wilson's\n15   testimony --\n16       Q      All right.        I think I put ln\n17       A       -- in what he proposed.\n\n18       Q       I think I put in front of you an excerpt of his\n19   testimony.\n20       A      Okay.\n21       Q      Do you have that?\n22       A       I   do.\n23                         MR. MACK:   And this has not been admitted\n24   into evidence yet, but I expect it will be tomorrow by\n25   Entergy.\n\n                      KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                512.474.2233\n\f                                                                 Page 576\n\n 1                     JUDGE BURKHALTER:       So you're just offering\n 2   this as a demonstrative?\n 3                     MR. MACK:     Yes.\n 4       Q     (BY MR. MACK)       And on Page 7 of his testimony,\n 5   Lines 15 and 16, he recommends an amount for annual\n 6   expected losses of 4.89 million.           Is that right?\n 7       A     Yes.     On Lines 15 and 16?\n 8       Q     Yes.\n 9       A     Yes, that's the number I see.\n10       Q     Okay.     And on Lines 19 through 21, he says he\n11   calculates that number \"using a Monte Carlo simulation\n12   run on the loss history,\" which he references as being\n13   on Exhibit   GSW~3.    Do you see that?\n14       A     Yes, I see the statement.\n15       Q     Okay.     And can you turn the page to Exhibit\n16   GSW-3?   And can you verify for us that the 1997 ice\n17   storm was included in his analysis?\n18       A     I can't verify it.           I see a large number there\n19   of similar magnitude to the 13 million.\n20       Q     And that large number has been trended to\n21   increase quite a bit, hasn't it?\n22       A     Yes, it has.\n23                     MR. MACK:     I pass the witness.\n24                     JUDGE BURKHALTER:       Mr. Nortey?\n25                     MR.

FERRIS:\n 7       Q      Good afternoon, Mr. Corkran.\n 8       A      Good afternoon.\n 9       Q      I'm going to try not to duplicate Mr. Mack's\n10   efforts.\n11                    Does a successful restoration effort for a\n12   given storm mean that all costs related to the storm\n13   restoration effort were necessarily prudent?\n14       A      Let's see.     You're asking if a successful\n15   restoration means that the costs were prudent,\n16   necessary?\n17       Q      Does a successful restoration effort for a\n18   given storm mean that all the -- all the costs related\n19   to that storm were prudent necessarily?\n20       A      I mean, I'm not sure.     I can't speak to the\n21   definition of \"prudency,\" where it would fall.\n22       Q      Fair enough.\n23                    I wanted to ask you a little bit about\n24   that order from the Docket 18249 that Mr. Mack asked you\n25   about.\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                             512.474.2233\n\f                                                               Page 578\n\n 1                    MS. FERRIS:    May I approach, Your Honor?\n 2                    JUDGE BURKHALTER:    Yes.\n 3                    MS. FERRIS:     I have an excerpt from the\n 4   hearing, and I will not be offering this as evidence\n 5   because it will speak for itself.        It's merely a\n 6   demonstrative.\n 7       A    Okay.     Thank you.\n 8       Q    (BY MS. FERRIS)        Could you turn to Page 18 of\n 9   the order on.rehearing for Docket 18249?\n10       A    Okay.\n11       Q    There is a sentence that begins at the very end\n12   of the third line from the bottom, and it continues to\n13   the top of the next page.        Could you read that sentence\n14   for us, please?     It begins with the word \"While.\"\n15       A    The sentence reads,       \"While Company's initial\n16   efforts to mobilize and deploy additional nonEGS\n17   personnel were slow and caused concern, vegetation\n18   management failures greatly aggravated the situation.\"\n19       Q    Thank you.     And just above, I guess this would\n20   be three lines down in the middle of the line.           There's\n21   another sentence that begins with the word \"A major,\"\n22   could you read that sentence?\n23       A    Yes.     The sentence reads,    \"A major cause of the\n24   outages during the storm were broken or bowed ice-laden\n25   tree limbs overhanging the wires.\"\n\n                 KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                           512.474.2233\n\f                                                                    Page 579\n\n 1          Q      Further down the order states that \"The\n 2   Company's failure to clear the limbs before the storm\n 3   was a major factor in the number and duration of the\n 4   outages experienced by customers.\"                Is that right?\n 5          A     Yes   1   that's correct.   That's what it says.\n 6          Q     Thank you.       Did the cost to restore the system\n 7   after the 1997 ice storm 1 was it increased as a result\n 8   of EGI's imprudence?\n 9          A      Imprudence?\n10          Q     Or was it -- let me rephrase.            Were the costs\n11   of the 1997 ice storm 1 to recovery it 1 were those costs\n12   increased due to the state of the vegetation management?\n13          A     My understanding is that was a finding 1 was\n14   that it did exacerbate the storm damage.\n\n15          Q     Did the Company          or excuse me -- has the\n16   Company made any attempt to quantify the extent to which\n17   restoration costs were increased as a result of the\n18   state of their vegetation management?\n\n19          A     Not that I'm aware of.\n20          Q      Okay.

We'd\n\n 2   reserve optional completeness.\n\n 3                         JUDGE WALSTON:   Cities Exhibit 7 is\n\n 4   admitted.\n\n 5                         (Exhibit Cities No. 7 admitted)\n\n 6          Q       (BY MR. LAWTON)     Okay.   Now; is Entergy Corp --\n\n 7   and keep that exhibit with you.            Keep it handy.    Okay,\n\n 8   sir?\n\n 9          A      I will.\n\n10          Q      Is Entergy Corp -- as seen from the president,\n\n11   Entergy Texas, Inc., is Entergy Texas, Inc. a growing\n\n12   company?\n\n13          A      It has been slowly growing.\n\n14          Q      .It has been slowly growing?\n\n15          A      Slowly growing.\n\n16          Q      So your load is growing each year?\n\n17          A.     The load has        well, there has been some years\n18   when load did not increase very much, but overall on the\n\n19   average since I became president, it has grown.\n\n20          Q      Okay.     And so there's a difference when I say\n\n21   load and sales, I guess.           Do you understand that?\n\n22          A      Let's talk -- good point.       There's energy,\n\n23   ~hich       is the sales, the megawatt-hours that we sell, and\n\n24   theie•s also the need for additional resources for\n\n25   reliability, which would be the capacity that we would\n\n                      KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                512.474.2233\n\f                                                                    Page 183\n\n    1    that time.     Is that accurate?\n\n    2        A     That's correct.\n\n    .3       Q     All right.      And ETI's corporate credit ratings\n     4   remain the same, even though that settlement resulted 1n\n\n     5   a lower than requested revenue requirement and an ROE\n\n     6   and none of the alternative ratemaking mechanisms that\n\n     7   ETI~had   proposed in that case.         Correct?\n\n     8       A       Yes.\n\n     9                       MS. GRIFFITHS:     I need to move for the\n\n    10   admission of TIEC -- let's see -- Exhibits 9 and TIEC\n\n    11   Exhibit 8.     And I think I've already asked for 6 and\n\n    12   7 -- or I did not ask for 6 but just for 7.\n\n    13                       JUDGE ARNOLD:     Six has already been\n\n    14   admitted.\n\n    15                       MS. GRIFFITHS:     Okay.   I would ask for the\n\n    16   admission of both of them, Your Honor.\n\n    17                       MR. OLSON:     With respect to 8 and 9, just\n\n    18   reserve optional completeness.\n\n    19                       JUDGE ARNOLD:     Okay.    Seven, 8 and 9 will\nI\nI        be admitted.        I think 9 is subject to optional\n    20\n\n    21   completeness.\n\n    22                        (Exhibit TIEC Nos. 7, 8 and 9 admitted)\n\n    23       Q        (BY MS. GRIFFITHS)        Could you turn to Page 35\n\n    24   of your testimony.         Okay.     Now, on Page 35 of your\n\n    25   testimony, you testify regarding the fact of ETI's\n\n                            KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE' INC.\n                                      512.474.2233\n\f                                                            Page 282\n\n 1                  MS.

CYR:    No objection -- well, Your\n 5   Honor, generally we don't have court opinions as an\n 6   admitted exhibit, but -- I mean, we don't have an\n 7   objection if Your Honors want to have them, but counsel\n 8   normally cites --\n\n 9                  JUDGE BURKHALTER:    I   understand~   We can\n10   take notice of it and --\n11                  MS. FERRIS:    Your Honor, actually, I also,\n12   just for you notice as well, the last page'·is the\n13   Supreme Court status sheet.     So it's one page in\n14   addition to the case law.     I meant to point that out\n15   earlier.\n16                  JUDGE BURKHALTER:    Well, I tell you what,\n17   if there's no objection to it, I'll go ahead and admit\n18   it as an exhibit.    I agree we can take notice of it,\n19   but -- so 9 is admitted.\n20                   (Exhibit OPC No. 9 admitted)\n\n21                  MS. CYR:    Your Honors, as to 10, the\n22   highly sensitive, we will want Your Honors -- what\n\n23   counsel has provided is the actual response, but there\n24 · is the question to be asked, and we would like for\n\n25 ·optional completeness to provide the question that was\n\n                  KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                            512.474.2233\n\f                                                                 Page 283\n\n1    actually asked and then the response thereto.\n\n2                    MS. FERRIS:     Your Honor, I actually have\n3    the question and I could offer that as lOA if Entergy\n4    would prefer.\n\n5                     MS. CYR:   If I can just confirm that 1s\n6    our response.\n\n 7                    MS. FERRIS:     This is the question itself.\n\n 8                    MS. CYR:   With the --\n\n 9                    MS. FERRIS:     With the Addendum 1.\n\n10                    MS. CYR:   Okay.       Together with the highly\n11   sensitive\n12                    MS. FERRIS:     Yes.\n\n13                    JUDGE BURKHALTER:        Why don't we just\n14   combine it and make it into -- make· it all 10?             Well,\n\n15   no, let's don't do that, because we've got the stuff in\n16   the envelope.     I think it would probably be cleaner to\n17   make it lOA.\n\n18                    MS. CYR:      So with that, Your Honor, we\n19   would have no objection to\n\n20                    JUDGE BURKHALTER:        All right.   So I'm\n\n21   hearing no objection to. 10 and lOA.          So they are both\n\n22   admitted.\n23                     (Exhibit OPC Nos. 10 and lOA admitted.\n\n24                    MS.

FERRIS:     Okay.\n\n 2                  JUDGE ARNOLD:      I've looked at 18 where\n 3   there are dark blackouts.       They're shaded.   I don't know\n 4   if something is supposed to go in there or not.       And I\n 5   sure as heck can't tell from 18 whether there is\n\n 6   anything there.\n\n 7                  MS. FERRIS:      Well, can I ask you this\n 8   question, ·Your Honor:    This is an RFI response provided\n 9   by the company, sponsored by this witness.        The company\n10   has provided it to us in response to the question·that\n11   asks for their forms.     And to the extent that we-don't\n12   understand   whethe~   something is missing or not, it would\n13 .be up to the company to provide optional completeness go\n14   that.   This is an admission by a party-opponent.\n\n15                   JUDGE ARNOLD:     If I can see the\n16   originally-supplied        I .don't know what the company\n17   gave you in discovery.      I do know that sometimes when\n18   you run something through a copy machine, it comes out\n19   black when it's highlighted.\n\n20                   MS. FERRIS:     Your Honor, I'll be glad to\n\n21   pull it up on the interchange right now go my iPad.           I\n22 .have the complete FERC Form 1 and·FERC Form 60 pulled up\n\n23   right now, if you would like to review that document.\n24   You go onto Page 201 to see that there. are shades there\n25   on the blank form and that should resolve any\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                             512.474.2233\n\f                                                              Page 945\n\n1    authentication questions that are involved.\n2                    Your Honor, would you like to see?\n3                    JUDGE ARNOLD:     I apologize.    I'm just\n4    trying to find something go my computer, and I've lost\n5    it.\n 6                   Just found it.     Are you saying this is go\n 7   the interchange?\n 8                   MS. FERRIS:     The responseq -- and I\n 9   actually have go the FERC website, their Form 60\n10   document, the pdf form.       And I could give you the link\n11   or I could let you use my iPad.\n12                   JUDGE ARNOLD:     Give me the link.\n13                   MS.

And what I was saying,\n\n21   he was say1ng -- if we look go Page 201, which is the\n\n22 . one with the shading, the first one with shading, we can\n23   see that the form has shading the same place that we\n\n24   have shading, the 18 has shading.\n\n25                    JUDGE ARNOLD :    No.    I understand that.   I\n\n                 KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                           512.474.2233\n\f                                                                     Page 946\n\n 1   don't know if something is·supposed to go in there or\n\n 2   not.\n\n 3                       MS. FERRIS:       Your Honor, if the form had\n 4   shading, it indicates you're not supposed to fill it ln\n 5   go your 10     -~   I mean, you don't fill in go shading.             I\n 6   can show you an example.              On Page 102 of the form go\n 7   Line 68 there is a title in black, \"Current and Accrued\n 8   Liabilities.\"        It's shaded in.       And then things that\n 9   fall below it are not shaded in, because that's where\n10   you fill in.\n\n11                       JUDGE ARNOLD:        Given the fact that this\n12   has been supplied in response to a discovery request,\n13   I'm going to go ahead and let it in.                 If the company\n14   believes there is something hidden in the blacked-out\n15   areas, they can supply it.\n\n16                       MR.

And a third factor\n\n 5   is when the amount of the expenses can be substantial\n 6   enough that they can actually impair the company's\n 7   integrity or its financial wholeness.\n\n 8       Q      So rate case expenses, those impair the\n 9   company's financial integrity if they're not included in\n10   a rider?\n\n11       A      Well, I think that they could.    I mean, they\n12   could hurt it.\n\n13       Q      What's that based on?\n\n14       A      Well, the fact that. rate case expenses these\n15   days are in the many multimillions of dollars.       And, in\n16   fact, in this case, I guess you're asking for\n17   12 million.\n\n18                    MR. WILLIAMS:    Linda tells me I neglected\n19   to offer ETI Exhibit 83.      I offer that exhibit at this\n\n20   point.\n\n21                    JUDGE WALSTON:    Any objection?\n\n22                    MR. MACK:   Your Honors, Mr. Williams kind\n23   of made the insinuation that Schedule A from the last\n\n24   case, Docket 37744, was not -- were not retail numbers.\n\n25                    I think we would like to object as far as\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                              512.474.2233\n\f                                                          Page 1191\n\n1    optional completeness so that we can provide documents\n\n2    to show that these are retail numbers ..\n\n3                    JUDGE WALSTON:    Any other objections?     All\n\n4    right.    Then, Exhibit ETI-83 is. admitted subject to\n\n5    showing of optional·completeness.\n\n 6                   (Exhibit ETI No. 83 admitted)\n\n 7                   MR. WILLIAMS:    Thank you.\n\n 8         Q    (BY MR. WILLIAMS)     Let me go back to the rider.\n\n 9   Are you aware of any Commission ruling indicating that\n\n10   financial integrity is a necessary showing to get a rate\n\n11   case expense rider?\n\n12         A    No, I'm not.\n\n13         Q    So putting that to one side, the main basis you\n\n14   have for approving of riders is that costs are volatile,\n\n15   costs are beyond the Company's control.       Correct?\n\n16         A    Those are the main ones.      I think the courts\n\n17   have looked at and I think commissions have approved or\n\n18   based their decisions on.\n\n19         Q    Also, . when you say· \"beyond the control,\" it• s\n\n20   not       the Company is not going to be able to reduce its\n\n21   costs or make those costs smaller by the way of managing\n\n22   them.     It's just sort of stuck with them.     Correct?\n\n23         A     I don't understand your question.\n\n24         Q     Well, if there's a cost that you can manage\n\n25 . you_r business in a way to reduce it, in your view that\n\n                    KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                           Page 1456\n\n 1   admiss.ion of Cities Exhibits 43A and 43B.\n\n 2                 JUDGE BURKHALTER:     Any objection?\n\n 3                 MR.

Did you\n 8   wish to have them admitted?\n\n 9                 MR. BOEHM:     Thank you, Your Honor.      Kroger\n10   would move for the admission of KRO 3, KRO 4 and KRO 5.\n11                 JUDGE BURKHALTER:      Any objection?\n\n12                 MR.

You have the\n19   right to supplement under the rule of optional\n20   completeness for 43A.\n\n21                 MR. NEINAST:     And can I also ask for 43B.\n22                 Mr. Mack, is there every other page\n23   missing in the.-- looks like the ·original sheet 1 and\n24   the next one is original sheet 3, 5, as well as 6 ..\n\n25                  MR.

Mack) Now     I   Ms. Talkington, would you\n\n6    agree that this Brazos contrac·t, which has been\n 7   attached -- has been partially attached -- to Cities\n\n 8   Exhibit 43B is a contract that allocates costs on a 12CP\n\n 9   basis?\n10       A    This is the first time I've ever seen this\n11   contract, so I could not tell you that without reading\n12   the entire thing.\n\n13       Q    Okay.      Co~ld   I direct your attention to what's\n14   been Bates stamped page No. TIEC 4-2 BB414?\n15                     Are you there?\n\n16       A    BB414?\n\n17       Q    Yes, ma'am.\n\n18       A     Okay.\n\n19       Q    And the second·paragraph· from the bottom, the\n\n20   second. sentence of that paragraph, could you read that\n\n21   and tell me whether the costs of -- I'm sorry, Entergy's\n\n22   costs are allocated to Brazos based on the 12CP\n\n23   allocation method?\n\n24       A     The sentence that starts, \"The ETiproduction\"?\n\n25        Q    Yes.\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                            Page 1505\n\n l       A      Yes.\n\n 2       Q      And we've done that in this case?\n\n 3      A       Yes.\n\n 4       Q      Now, let me show you Schedule 041 from the rate\n\n 5   filing package.      This is in evidence.    Let me ask if you\n 6   can identify the amount of the weather normalization in\n\n 7   this case in terms of dollars.\n\n 8       A      Yes.    According to this schedule, base revenues\n 9   were reduced by 22.4 million.        This is the weather\n10   adjustment.\n\n11       Q      Okay.    And other things equal, the utility's\n12   earnings would be $22 million higher than they otherwise\n13   would be during normal weather on account of the\n14 . weather.    Correct?\n\n15       A      Pretax, yes.\n\n16       Q      Okay.    Now, let me show you the 10-K for the\n17   Company for 2011.       This is in evidence already.    Let me\n18   just point to you the net income for ETI for 2011 and\n19   see if you can read that and identify that.\n\n20       A      So for Calendar Year 2011 the report shows net\n\n21   income of 80,845,000.\n\n22       Q      Okay.     And what\n\n23                      MR. VanMIDDLESWORTH:    May I ask -- because\n\n24   I don't have the 10-K with me.\n\n25                      MR. WREN:    Oh, I'm sorry.\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                512.474.2233\n\f                                                                      Page 1506\n\n       1                    MR. VanMIDDLESWORTH:         I was wondering if I\n\n       2    could either see it or know what exhibit it was.\n\n       3                     MR. WREN:    We reserved for optional\n\n       4    completeness.\n\n       5                     MR. VanMIDDLESWORTH:        Until we know that\n       6    it's in the record we would object on asking this\n\n       7    witness to recite from'a company document that hadn't\n       8    been introduced yet.\n\n       9                     JUDGE WALSTON:     I believe the Cities had\nI\nI .\n~     10    offered portions of it, and I think the Company had\n      11    reserved the right for optional completeness.\n\n      12                     MR. WREN:    Correct, Your Honor.        I didn't\n      13    think this would be controversial.           The Cities clearly\n      14    offered the 10-K and I clearly reserved optional\n      15    completeness.\n\n      16                     MR. VanMIDDLESWORTH:        So are you\n      17    offering -- so if he wants to offer the full 10-K 1n,\n      18    then I think that would be appropriate.\n\n      19                     MR. WREN:     I'll be glad to do that.       I\n      20    think that's unnecessary.         It burdens the record, but if·\n\n      21    that's the wish I can do that.\n\n      22                     JUDGE WALSTON:      Okay.\n\n      23                      MR. VanMIDDLESWORTH:        I may be persuaded\n      · 24 ··otherwise, but if you're crossing him on a page that-\n\n       25   hasn't yet been introduced, then I think we would need\n\n                            KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                         512.474.2233\n\f                                                           Page 1507\n\n 1   to see whether it's something that is appropriate for\n 2   optional completeness and --\n\n 3                 MR. WREN:   I'll let you reserve on\n 4   optional completeness.\n\n 5                 JUDGE WALSTON:    I think it would be best,\n 6   since we have had bits and parts and pieces referred to,\n\n 7   I would recommend you go ahead and just offer the whole\n 8   thing in unless you have some problem with that.\n\n 9                 MR. WREN:   So, Your Honor, then I think\n10   this would be ETI Exhibit 98,.because I've reserved 96\n11   and 97.\n12                 JUDGE WALSTON:    Okay.   Then ETI Exhibit 98\n13   will be admitted, and you can get additional copies\n14   bring the additional copies later, obviously.\n15                  (Exhibit ETI No. 98 marked and admitted)\n\n16                 MR. WREN:   Thank you, Your Honor.       The\n17   reference in.question is to Cities Exhibit 8 and 7 that\n18   include excerpts from the 10-K.\n\n19                 JUDGE. WALSTON:   Just for our convenience,\n20   can you refer us to the page number you were questioning\n21   the witness about?\n\n22                 MR. WREN:   Yes, Your Honor.    May I\n23   approach the witness?\n\n24                 JUDGE WALSTON:    Yes.\n\n25       Q     (BY MR. WREN)   Can you tell me the page number\n\n                 KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE,.

Let's come back at 3:35.\n    11                      (Recess:   3:17p.m. to 3:36p.m.)\n    12                  JUDGE ARNOLD:         We're back on the record\n    13    following a break.      Mr. Mack, I understand you have some\n    14 ·matters you want to.discuss.\n    15.                 MR. MACK:       Yes, Your Honor.     Thank you.      A\n    16    couple days ago during the testimony of Mr. Brazell,\n\n    17    Entergy introduced ETI's Exhibit 83, which showed\n\nI   18    Schedule A of the Company's rate filing from the last\n\n    19    case, and I think he was being asked whether that was a\nr   20    total Company number or a wholesale number, and we\n\n    21    reserved the right of optional completeness on that\n\n    22    exhibit.\n\n    23                      And we'd like to introduce Cities\n\n    24    Exhibit 49, which is Schedule A-1, stating that there\n    25    was not a wholesale class in the filing.           The second\n\n                       KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                 512.474.2233\n\f                                                           Page 1687\n\n 1   page to it is Schedule Q from the same filing showing\n 2   what Mr. Brazell noted as his bottom-line number there\n 3   on a retail basis.    So we offer Cities- Exhibit No. 49\n 4   for optional completeness.\n\n 5                   JUDGE ARNOLD:    Any objections?\n\n 6                   MR.
