Munchus and Strain, proceeding pro se on behalf of\n\nthemselves as class members, appeal the district court’s approval of ten settlement\n\nagreements ending that litigation.\n\n                                Prudential Standing\n\n      The State of Alabama and the State Board of Education Defendants (“SBE\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fDefendants”) argue that Munchus and Strain lack prudential standing under Devlin\n\nv. Scardeletti, 536 U.S. 1, 122 S.Ct. 2005, 153 L.Ed.2d 27 (2002), because they fail\n\nto assert any individual right as class members or any personal stake in the\n\noutcome of the class action settlement or appeal.\n\n       Non-named class members who object in a timely manner to approval of a\n\nsettlement in a class action may appeal from the final judgment approving the\n\nsettlement. Devlin, 536 U.S. at 14, 122 S.Ct. at 2113; AAL High Yield Bond Fund\n\nv. Deloitte & Touche LLP, 361 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir. 2004). “[A]ppeals by\n\nnonnamed class members [do not] raise the sorts of concerns that are ordinarily\n\naddressed as a matter of prudential standing.” Devlin, 536 U.S. at 7, 122 S.Ct. at\n\n2009. As the Supreme Court stated in Devlin:\n\n      Because petitioner is a member of the class bound by the judgment,\n      there is no question that he satisfies [the prudential standing]\n      requirements. The legal rights he seeks to raise are his own, he\n      belongs to a discrete class of interested parties, and his complaint\n      clearly falls within the zone of interests of the requirement that a\n      settlement be fair to all class members. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(e).\n\nId.\n\n      Munchus and Strain are nonnamed class members who filed timely\n\nobjections to the settlement agreements. Therefore, they satisfy the prudential\n\nstanding requirements.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                      Approval of the Settlement Agreements\n\n      We review for abuse of discretion a district court’s approval of a class action\n\nsettlement agreement. Leverso v. SouthTrust Bank of Ala., 18 F.3d 1527, 1531\n\n(11th Cir. 1994). Our limited review reflects a strong judicial policy favoring the\n\nresolution of disputes through settlement. United States v. City of Miami, 614\n\nF.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1980). We review for clear error a district court’s finding that,\n\nunder United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 112 S.Ct. 2727, 120 L.Ed.2d 575\n\n(1992), an education system is no longer in violation of the Constitution and is\n\ntherefore unitary. NAACP, Jacksonville Branch v. Duval County School, 273 F.3d\n\n960, 966 (11th Cir. 2001).\n\n                      Legal and Economic Interests of the Class\n\n      Munchus and Strain argue that the district court applied an incorrect legal\n\nstandard in determining whether to approve the settlement agreements, and, in\n\ndoing so, the district court failed to “fairly and adequately represent the legal and\n\neconomic interests of the class.” They specifically assert that the settlement is\n\nunfair and inadequate in two ways: (1) funding for historically black colleges and\n\nuniversities is contingent upon legislative approval; and (2) the court is without\n\njurisdiction to enforce the agreements. They argue that the mediation provisions of\n\nthe settlement agreements “require[] the class to engage in the legal and economic\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\fburden of [enforcing] the settlements.”\n\n      They further argue that the district court should have applied the six-factor\n\napproach in Ayers v. Thompson, 358 F.3d 356 (5th Cir. 2002) (persuasive\n\nauthority). Munchus and Strain appear to argue that not only is Ayers the proper\n\nlegal standard, but that the substance of the settlement agreements in this case\n\nshould include certain key provisions of the settlement agreement in Ayers. They\n\npoint to the following features of the Ayers settlement agreement: (1) state fund\n\nappropriations were approved by the state legislature prior to approval of the\n\nsettlement; (2) the notice to class members was widely circulated for several\n\nmonths; (3) the fairness hearing extended over three days, during which the court\n\nreceived evidence, rather than relied upon reports; (4) the objectors were allowed\n\nan opportunity to participate in the fairness hearing; (5) the district court retained\n\njurisdiction; and (6) the remedial standard was the elimination of vestiges of\n\nsegregation, not the promotion of diversity. With regard to this last feature,\n\nMunchus and Strain argue that “the class is entitled to more than diversity\n\nprograms and measurements for which defendants will pay no penalty for\n\nviolations or non-achievement.”\n\n      Munchus and Strain also argue that “[t]he district court did not give\n\nadequate consideration to whether this settlement is a mantle of oppression that\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\funfairly and unreasonably impinges on the rights and interests of the absent class\n\nmembers.” They contend that the court-ordered notice to class members—once a\n\nweek for two weeks in designated newspapers in Alabama—was insufficient to\n\nsatisfy the legal and economic interest of absent class members. They note that the\n\ntwo weeks notice did not provide absent class members time “to obtain appropriate\n\nlegal review” of the settlement agreements and that “[t]he fairness hearing was\n\nscheduled within one week of the time to file objections.”\n\n      Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) requires judicial approval of all class\n\nsettlements. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(1)(A). In that approval process, absent class\n\nmembers are afforded both substantive and procedural protections. Holmes v.\n\nContinental Can Co., 706 F.2d 1144, 1147 (11th Cir. 1983). A “[d]istrict [c]ourt\n\nmust find that the settlement is fair, adequate and reasonable and is not the product\n\nof collusion between the parties.” Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir.\n\n1977); see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(1)(C). In evaluating settlement proposals, six\n\nfactors are generally considered: (1) whether the settlement was a product of fraud\n\nor collusion; (2) the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation; (3)\n\nthe stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the factual\n\nand legal obstacles prevailing on the merits; (5) the possible range of recovery and\n\nthe certainty of damages; and (6) the respective opinions of the participants,\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fincluding class counsel, class representative, and the absent class members. See\n\nCotton, 559 F.2d at 1330-31. Accord Ayers v. Thompson, 358 F.3d 356, 369 (5th\n\nCir. 2004). Additionally, “individual class members whose interests may be\n\ncompromised in the settlement process” are accorded special procedural\n\nprotections, including notice. Holmes, 706 F.2d at 1147; Pettway v. Am. Cast Iron\n\nPipe Co., 576 F.2d 1157, 1219 (5th Cir. 1978).\n\n                                        Notice\n\n      As a threshold matter, there is an issue as to whether Munchus and Strain\n\nfailed to preserve the issue of notice by not submitting a written objection to the\n\ndistrict court. See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., 385 F.3d 1324,\n\n1331 (11th Cir. 2004) (holding that, generally, we will not consider an issue not\n\nraised in the district court.). In their brief, Munchus and Strain frame the notice\n\nissue as one regarding the legal and economic interests of the class. Their\n\nobjections below do assert that “[t]he proposed settlement agreement does not\n\nfairly and adequately represent the legal and economic interests of the members of\n\nthe class.” Construing the objections and brief of Munchus and Strain, who are\n\nproceeding pro se, liberally, Munchus and Strain appear to understand the notice\n\nrequirement as part of this broader objection regarding the interests of the class.\n\nSee Lorisme v. I.N.S., 129 F.3d 1441, 1444 n.3 (11th Cir. 1997) (noting that we\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fliberally construe pro se briefs). Therefore, they have not failed to preserve the\n\nissue for appeal. Regardless, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nfinding that notice was sufficient, as discussed below.\n\n      Rule 23(e) requires that the district court “direct notice in a reasonable\n\nmanner to all class members who would be bound by a proposed settlement.”\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(1)(B). We have not determined what constitutes reasonable\n\nnotice of a proposed settlement agreement under Rule 23(e). Those of our sister\n\ncircuits that have addressed the issue have required that the notice apprise class\n\nmembers of the terms of the settlement agreement in a manner that allows class\n\nmembers to make their own determination regarding whether the settlement serves\n\ntheir interests. See Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace, and Agric. Implement\n\nWorkers of Am. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 497 F.3d 617, 630 (6th Cir. 2007)\n\n(persuasive authority) (explaining that notice must “fairly apprise the prospective\n\nmembers of the class of the terms of the proposed settlement so that class members\n\nmay come to their own conclusions about whether the settlement serves their\n\ninterests.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      “In addition to the requirements of Rule 23, the Constitution's Due Process\n\nClause also guarantees unnamed class members the right to notice of . . .\n\nsettlement.” DeJulius v. New England Health Care Employees Pension Fund, 429\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fF.3d 935, 943-44 (10th Cir. 2005) (persuasive authority). Accord Adams v.\n\nSouthern Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co., 493 F.3d 1276, 1285 (11th Cir. 2007) (“Class\n\nactions, as other cases, are subject to the requirements of due process.”) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). In the context of notice for class certification and class\n\nmember opt-out, we have stated that “it is not only necessary that the notice reach\n\nthe parties affected but that it convey the required information.” Adams, 493 F.3d\n\nat 1285-86 (internal quotation marks omitted). Likewise, we have stated that, “[i]n\n\nreviewing the class notice to determine whether it satisfies the[] requirements [of\n\ndue process], we look solely to the language of the notices and the manner of their\n\ndistribution.” Id. at 1286.\n\n      The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that notice was\n\nsufficient. The content of the notice apprised the class members that the settlement\n\nagreement with the State was available for their review on the websites of the\n\nStates of Alabama, the Governor, and the Alabama Commission on Higher\n\nEducation and that the settlement agreement with each of the defendant\n\nuniversities was available on the university’s website. It also apprised the class\n\nmembers that they could view the settlement agreements on the plaintiff’s website\n\nand at the main library of every state university in Alabama. The notice appeared\n\nin newspapers in the geographic areas of the universities involved in the suit and in\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fthe north, south, east and west of the state. The notice was published in ten\n\nnewspapers, twice in each, at week intervals. Regarding the amount of time the\n\nnotice was published prior to the deadline for objections and the fairness hearing,\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in providing for two weeks’ notice\n\nbefore objections were due. Although Munchus and Strain argue that two weeks’\n\nnotice did not allow class members adequate time to secure counsel for filing\n\nobjections, Rule 23 and due process only require that class members are provided\n\nnotice of the terms of a settlement agreement in a manner that allows them to make\n\na determination about whether or not the settlement serves their interests. Nothing\n\nin Rule 23(e) or its attendant jurisprudence indicates that hiring counsel is\n\nnecessary to meet the requirements of Rule 23(e) or due process.\n\n      Fairness, Adequacy, and Reasonableness of the Settlement Agreements\n\n      In approving a settlement, the trial court must “undertake an analysis of the\n\nfacts and the law relevant to the proposed compromise” and “support [its]\n\nconclusions by memorandum opinion or otherwise in the record.” Cotton, 559\n\nF.2d at 1330. “A mere boiler-plate approval phrased in appropriate language but\n\nunsupported by evaluation of the facts or analysis of the law will not suffice.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We “must have a basis for judging the exercise\n\nof the district judge’s discretion.” Holmes, 706 F.2d at 1147 (quoting Cotton, 559\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fF.2d at 1330) (reversing and remanding where the district court approved a\n\nsettlement based upon a deficient record). However, as the former Fifth Circuit\n\nexplained, “[d]ifferent problems are posed by class action settlements [than district\n\ncourt judgments]. Lacking a fully developed evidentiary record, both the trial\n\ncourt and the appellate court would be incapable of making the independent\n\nassessment of the facts and law required in the adjudicatory context.” Pettway,\n\n576 F.2d at 1169. We explained in Cotton that:\n\n      [i]n determining the fairness, adequacy and reasonableness of the\n      proposed compromise, the inquiry should focus upon the terms of the\n      settlement. The settlement terms should be compared with the likely\n      rewards the class would have received following a successful trial of\n      the case . . . Yet, in evaluating the terms of the compromise in relation\n      to the likely benefits of a successful trial, the trial judge ought not try\n      the case in the settlement hearings.\n\nCotton, 559 F.2d at 1330. Therefore, “[i]t cannot be overemphasized that neither\n\nthe trial court in approving the settlement nor this Court in reviewing that approval\n\nhave the right or the duty to reach any ultimate conclusions on the issues of fact\n\nand law which underlie the merits of the dispute.” Id.\n\n      In evaluating whether the settlement agreements in this case were “fair,\n\nadequate, and reasonable,” the district court considered nine factors, which\n\nincluded the six factors enumerated in the standard asserted by Munchus and Strain\n\nand generally considered in evaluating settlement proposals. Therefore, the district\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fcourt did not apply an incorrect legal standard, nor did it abuse its discretion in\n\nfinding that the settlement agreements were fair, adequate, and reasonable.\n\n                    Fordice: The Vestiges of De Jure Segregation\n\n      Munchus and Strain argue on appeal that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in finding that the vestiges of de jure segregation had been removed\n\nfrom the Alabama university system to the extent practicable and consistent with\n\nsound educational practices. They assert that the traditionally white universities in\n\nAlabama have not met the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in United\n\nStates v. Fordice. They further assert that the district court’s determination that\n\nAlabama’s university system had attained unitary status was unsupported by the\n\nevidence at the fairness hearing and that the record did not show that the vestiges\n\nof racial segregation had been eliminated. They contend that the remaining\n\nvestiges of de jure segregation cannot be remedied through diversity programs, as\n\noutlined in the settlement agreements. Munchus and Strain further contend that\n\nimmeasurable “diversity” is an erroneous legal standard in desegregation cases,\n\nand therefore, by applying a diversity standard, the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion. They note that “[a]ll agreed that the vestiges of racial segregation\n\ncontinue” and that, even with monitoring and court oversight, Alabama’s\n\nuniversity system failed to comply with the consent decree.\n\n\n\n                                           12\n\f      “A State does not discharge its constitutional obligations [to dismantle its\n\nprior dual university system] until it eradicates policies and practices traceable to\n\nits prior de jure dual system that continue to foster segregation.” Fordice, 505 U.S.\n\nat 728, 112 S.Ct. at 2735. “If policies traceable to the de jure system are still in\n\nforce and have discriminatory effects, those policies too must be reformed to the\n\nextent practicable and consistent with sound educational practices.” Id. at 729, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 2736.\n\n      A district court “should retain jurisdiction until it is clear that state-imposed\n\nsegregation has been completely removed.” Green v. County Sch. Bd. Of New\n\nKent County, Va., 391 U.S. 430, 439, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1695 (1968). However,\n\n      The Supreme Court intended [the] federal supervision of local school\n      systems to be a temporary measure. Since the legal justification for\n      such supervision is a constitutional violation by local authorities, a\n      district court must divest itself of jurisdiction when the constitutional\n      violation has ceased and when local authorities have operated in\n      compliance with a desegregation decree for a reasonable period of\n      time.\n\nLockett v. Bd. of Educ. of Muscogee County Sch. Dist., Ga., 11 F.3d 839, 842\n\n(11th Cir. 1997) (citing Board of Educ. of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237,\n\n247, 111 S.Ct. 630, 637, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991)). “To be entitled to the end of\n\nfederal court supervision, a formerly dual school system must be able to prove that\n\nit has (1) complied in good faith with the desegregation decree, and (2) eliminated\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\fthe vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent practicable.” NAACP,\n\nJacksonville Branch v. Duval County School, 273 F.3d 960, 966 (11th Cir. 2001)\n\n(citing Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 88, 115 S.Ct. 2038, 132 L.Ed.2d 63\n\n(1995)).\n\n      We have “stress[ed] the temporary nature of federal judicial supervision\n\nover local school systems.” Lee v. Talladega County Bd. of Educ., 963 F.2d 1426,\n\n1430 (11th Cir. 1992). The Supreme Court noted in Freeman that:\n\n      Returning schools to the control of local authorities at the earliest\n      practicable date is essential to restore their true accountability in our\n      governmental system. When the school district and all state entities\n      participating with it in operating the schools make decisions in the\n      absence of judicial supervision, they can be held accountable to the\n      citizenry, to the political process, and to the courts in the ordinary\n      course.\n\nId. “[T]he ‘end purpose’ of every court that supervises the disestablishment of a\n\nracially dual school system must be to remedy the [constitutional] violation and in\n\naddition to restore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that\n\nis operating in compliance with the Constitution.” Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      To the extent that Munchus and Strain argue that the district court applied\n\nthe incorrect legal standard under Fordice, the district court did not err. It identified\n\nand applied the standard under Fordice. To the extent Munchus and Strain argue\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fthat the district court abused its discretion in finding that the vestiges of\n\nsegregation had been eliminated to the extent practicable and consistent with sound\n\neducational practices, the district court did not clearly err. The district court was\n\nwithin its discretion to determine, based upon the evidence documented in progress\n\nreports and prior opinions, that it had exhausted its role and efficacy in continuing\n\nto desegregate Alabama’s higher education system. The district court had a record\n\nconsisting of reports of a special master, an oversight committee, and the\n\ndefendants that spanned the life of the consent decrees, upon which to base its\n\nfinding. Additionally, the settlement agreement between the class plaintiffs and\n\nAlabama provides increased academic grant funding, continued funding for\n\nprograms required by the remedial decrees, and capital funding, and it provides for\n\ncourt enforcement of the agreement. To the extent that Munchus and Strain argue\n\nthat diversity is immeasurable—or that desegregation is immeasurable through the\n\nimplementation of diversity initiatives—the record of desegregation in this case\n\ndemonstrates otherwise.\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n      AFFIRMED.1\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Appellants’ request for oral argument is denied.\n\n                                                15\n\f",

They argue that the mediation provisions of\n\nthe settlement agreements “require[] the class to engage in the legal and economic\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\fburden of [enforcing] the settlements.”\n\n      They further argue that the district court should have applied the six-factor\n\napproach in Ayers v.

Munchus and Strain appear to argue that not only is Ayers the proper\n\nlegal standard, but that the substance of the settlement agreements in this case\n\nshould include certain key provisions of the settlement agreement in Ayers. They\n\npoint to the following features of the Ayers settlement agreement: (1) state fund\n\nappropriations were approved by the state legislature prior to approval of the\n\nsettlement; (2) the notice to class members was widely circulated for several\n\nmonths; (3) the fairness hearing extended over three days, during which the court\n\nreceived evidence, rather than relied upon reports; (4) the objectors were allowed\n\nan opportunity to participate in the fairness hearing; (5) the district court retained\n\njurisdiction; and (6) the remedial standard was the elimination of vestiges of\n\nsegregation, not the promotion of diversity. With regard to this last feature,\n\nMunchus and Strain argue that “the class is entitled to more than diversity\n\nprograms and measurements for which defendants will pay no penalty for\n\nviolations or non-achievement.”\n\n      Munchus and Strain also argue that “[t]he district court did not give\n\nadequate consideration to whether this settlement is a mantle of oppression that\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\funfairly and unreasonably impinges on the rights and interests of the absent class\n\nmembers.” They contend that the court-ordered notice to class members—once a\n\nweek for two weeks in designated newspapers in Alabama—was insufficient to\n\nsatisfy the legal and economic interest of absent class members. They note that the\n\ntwo weeks notice did not provide absent class members time “to obtain appropriate\n\nlegal review” of the settlement agreements and that “[t]he fairness hearing was\n\nscheduled within one week of the time to file objections.”\n\n      Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) requires judicial approval of all class\n\nsettlements.

In the context of notice for class certification and class\n\nmember opt-out, we have stated that “it is not only necessary that the notice reach\n\nthe parties affected but that it convey the required information.” Adams, 493 F.3d\n\nat 1285-86 (internal quotation marks omitted). Likewise, we have stated that, “[i]n\n\nreviewing the class notice to determine whether it satisfies the[] requirements [of\n\ndue process], we look solely to the language of the notices and the manner of their\n\ndistribution.” Id. at 1286.\n\n      The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that notice was\n\nsufficient. The content of the notice apprised the class members that the settlement\n\nagreement with the State was available for their review on the websites of the\n\nStates of Alabama, the Governor, and the Alabama Commission on Higher\n\nEducation and that the settlement agreement with each of the defendant\n\nuniversities was available on the university’s website. It also apprised the class\n\nmembers that they could view the settlement agreements on the plaintiff’s website\n\nand at the main library of every state university in Alabama. The notice appeared\n\nin newspapers in the geographic areas of the universities involved in the suit and in\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fthe north, south, east and west of the state. The notice was published in ten\n\nnewspapers, twice in each, at week intervals. Regarding the amount of time the\n\nnotice was published prior to the deadline for objections and the fairness hearing,\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in providing for two weeks’ notice\n\nbefore objections were due. Although Munchus and Strain argue that two weeks’\n\nnotice did not allow class members adequate time to secure counsel for filing\n\nobjections, Rule 23 and due process only require that class members are provided\n\nnotice of the terms of a settlement agreement in a manner that allows them to make\n\na determination about whether or not the settlement serves their interests. Nothing\n\nin Rule 23(e) or its attendant jurisprudence indicates that hiring counsel is\n\nnecessary to meet the requirements of Rule 23(e) or due process.\n\n      Fairness, Adequacy, and Reasonableness of the Settlement Agreements\n\n      In approving a settlement, the trial court must “undertake an analysis of the\n\nfacts and the law relevant to the proposed compromise” and “support [its]\n\nconclusions by memorandum opinion or otherwise in the record.” Cotton, 559\n\nF.2d at 1330. “A mere boiler-plate approval phrased in appropriate language but\n\nunsupported by evaluation of the facts or analysis of the law will not suffice.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We “must have a basis for judging the exercise\n\nof the district judge’s discretion.” Holmes, 706 F.2d at 1147 (quoting Cotton, 559\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fF.2d at 1330) (reversing and remanding where the district court approved a\n\nsettlement based upon a deficient record). However, as the former Fifth Circuit\n\nexplained, “[d]ifferent problems are posed by class action settlements [than district\n\ncourt judgments]. Lacking a fully developed evidentiary record, both the trial\n\ncourt and the appellate court would be incapable of making the independent\n\nassessment of the facts and law required in the adjudicatory context.” Pettway,\n\n576 F.2d at 1169. We explained in Cotton that:\n\n      [i]n determining the fairness, adequacy and reasonableness of the\n      proposed compromise, the inquiry should focus upon the terms of the\n      settlement. The settlement terms should be compared with the likely\n      rewards the class would have received following a successful trial of\n      the case . . . Yet, in evaluating the terms of the compromise in relation\n      to the likely benefits of a successful trial, the trial judge ought not try\n      the case in the settlement hearings.\n\nCotton, 559 F.2d at 1330. Therefore, “[i]t cannot be overemphasized that neither\n\nthe trial court in approving the settlement nor this Court in reviewing that approval\n\nhave the right or the duty to reach any ultimate conclusions on the issues of fact\n\nand law which underlie the merits of the dispute.” Id.\n\n      In evaluating whether the settlement agreements in this case were “fair,\n\nadequate, and reasonable,” the district court considered nine factors, which\n\nincluded the six factors enumerated in the standard asserted by Munchus and Strain\n\nand generally considered in evaluating settlement proposals. Therefore, the district\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fcourt did not apply an incorrect legal standard, nor did it abuse its discretion in\n\nfinding that the settlement agreements were fair, adequate, and reasonable.\n\n                    Fordice: The Vestiges of De Jure Segregation\n\n      Munchus and Strain argue on appeal that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in finding that the vestiges of de jure segregation had been removed\n\nfrom the Alabama university system to the extent practicable and consistent with\n\nsound educational practices. They assert that the traditionally white universities in\n\nAlabama have not met the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in United\n\nStates v. Fordice. They further assert that the district court’s determination that\n\nAlabama’s university system had attained unitary status was unsupported by the\n\nevidence at the fairness hearing and that the record did not show that the vestiges\n\nof racial segregation had been eliminated. They contend that the remaining\n\nvestiges of de jure segregation cannot be remedied through diversity programs, as\n\noutlined in the settlement agreements. Munchus and Strain further contend that\n\nimmeasurable “diversity” is an erroneous legal standard in desegregation cases,\n\nand therefore, by applying a diversity standard, the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion. They note that “[a]ll agreed that the vestiges of racial segregation\n\ncontinue” and that, even with monitoring and court oversight, Alabama’s\n\nuniversity system failed to comply with the consent decree.\n\n\n\n                                           12\n\f      “A State does not discharge its constitutional obligations [to dismantle its\n\nprior dual university system] until it eradicates policies and practices traceable to\n\nits prior de jure dual system that continue to foster segregation.” Fordice, 505 U.S.\n\nat 728, 112 S.Ct. at 2735. “If policies traceable to the de jure system are still in\n\nforce and have discriminatory effects, those policies too must be reformed to the\n\nextent practicable and consistent with sound educational practices.” Id. at 729, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 2736.\n\n      A district court “should retain jurisdiction until it is clear that state-imposed\n\nsegregation has been completely removed.” Green v.

The Supreme Court noted in Freeman that:\n\n      Returning schools to the control of local authorities at the earliest\n      practicable date is essential to restore their true accountability in our\n      governmental system. When the school district and all state entities\n      participating with it in operating the schools make decisions in the\n      absence of judicial supervision, they can be held accountable to the\n      citizenry, to the political process, and to the courts in the ordinary\n      course.\n\nId. “[T]he ‘end purpose’ of every court that supervises the disestablishment of a\n\nracially dual school system must be to remedy the [constitutional] violation and in\n\naddition to restore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that\n\nis operating in compliance with the Constitution.” Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      To the extent that Munchus and Strain argue that the district court applied\n\nthe incorrect legal standard under Fordice, the district court did not err. It identified\n\nand applied the standard under Fordice. To the extent Munchus and Strain argue\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fthat the district court abused its discretion in finding that the vestiges of\n\nsegregation had been eliminated to the extent practicable and consistent with sound\n\neducational practices, the district court did not clearly err. The district court was\n\nwithin its discretion to determine, based upon the evidence documented in progress\n\nreports and prior opinions, that it had exhausted its role and efficacy in continuing\n\nto desegregate Alabama’s higher education system. The district court had a record\n\nconsisting of reports of a special master, an oversight committee, and the\n\ndefendants that spanned the life of the consent decrees, upon which to base its\n\nfinding. Additionally, the settlement agreement between the class plaintiffs and\n\nAlabama provides increased academic grant funding, continued funding for\n\nprograms required by the remedial decrees, and capital funding, and it provides for\n\ncourt enforcement of the agreement. To the extent that Munchus and Strain argue\n\nthat diversity is immeasurable—or that desegregation is immeasurable through the\n\nimplementation of diversity initiatives—the record of desegregation in this case\n\ndemonstrates otherwise.\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n      AFFIRMED.1\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Appellants’ request for oral argument is denied.\n\n                                                15\n\f</pre>",
