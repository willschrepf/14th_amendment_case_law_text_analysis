The lease called for a security deposit of $2,500, which Nelson and Mitchell (collectively \"the tenants\") paid in cash. McGee put the money in a strongbox &#8212; a misstep, as an ordinance requires landlords to invest security deposits in segregated, interest-bearing accounts. When a dispute arose about the condition of the premises, McGee launched an eviction proceeding in state court; the tenants moved out and filed a counterclaim seeking return of the security deposit. McGee's lawyer in that action counseled her to bank the security deposit in compliance with the ordinance, and she did. Before the state court had resolved the litigation, however, McGee withdrew and spent the money. McGee says that she anticipated that the state court would rule in her favor, so that there was no need to wait for \"her\" money. The state judge saw things otherwise, determining that the tenants had complied with all of their obligations and that McGee owed double damages plus interest (a total of $5,207.50) for failing to return the security deposit after the tenants quit the premises. Unable (or at least unwilling) to pay this judgment, McGee filed a federal bankruptcy proceeding and sought a discharge. Bankruptcy Judge Squires ruled in McGee's favor, but District Judge Shadur reversed. See 2003 WL 1989641, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7208 (N.D.Ill. Apr. 30, 2003). He found that withdrawal of the security deposit while the state litigation was pending amounted to \"defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity\" and foreclosed the debt's discharge. See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As far as we can determine, neither this circuit nor any other has addressed the question whether a landlord's improper retention of a security deposit amounts to \"defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity\" for purposes of &#167; 523(a)(4). Perhaps no general answer is possible, for some jurisdictions (or leases) may treat the landlord's position as \"fiduciary\" while others do not. (There can be no doubt that, if McGee was the tenants' fiduciary, withdrawal and spending the money during the eviction litigation was an act of defalcation. See <i>Meyer v. Rigdon,</i> 36 F.3d 1375, 1383-85 (7th Cir.1994).) It is not hard to imagine arrangements that entitle landlords to treat security deposits as their own while tenancy continues, much as insurance companies may commingle prepaid premiums with general corporate funds even though they must repay any unearned premium to an insured who cancels the policy before the end of its term. If the lease or governing statute treats the deposit as a form of loan to the landlord in order to create the possibility of a setoff if the tenant later incurs a debt to the landlord, then the tenant becomes an unsecured creditor in bankruptcy. On this understanding, each side's obligation &#8212; the tenant's to pay rent and cover any damage, and the landlord's to repay the deposit &#8212; is unsecured, which makes the debts \"mutual\" and readily offset. Likewise, however, it is easy to imagine arrangements, created by contract or statute, that require landlords to treat security deposits as trust funds and thus create fiduciary duties. That is how the district judge read Chicago's ordinance. (As the ordinance supersedes inconsistent terms of any lease, we confine attention to the legislative language.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chicago Municipal Code &#167; 5-12-080(a) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A landlord shall hold all security deposits... in a federally insured interest-bearing account in a bank, savings and loan association or other financial institution....

Subsection (d) requires the landlord to provide an accounting and return the deposit (less deductions for unpaid rent and damage to the premises) promptly after the tenant vacates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsection (a) contains five distinct rules: (1) the money must be deposited in an insured account in a financial institution; (2) the account must earn interest; (3) the funds remain the tenant's property while on deposit; (4) every tenant's deposit must not be commingled with other assets; and (5) the funds \"shall not be subject to the claims of any creditor of the landlord\". The second requirement &#8212; that each account earn interest &#8212; is not relevant to analysis under the Bankruptcy Code. Nor is the fifth requirement. Federal law preempts any effort by state and local governments to determine which assets may be reached, for what purposes, by particular creditors. See, e.g., <i>Perez v. Campbell,</i> 402 U.S. 637, 91 S.Ct. 1704, 29 L.Ed.2d 233 (1971). The meaning of the words in &#167; 523(a)(4) is a question of federal law, see <i>In re Frain,</i> 230 F.3d 1014, 1017 (7th Cir.2000), which state and local governments cannot influence by attaching the word \"trust\" or any equivalent label to arrangements that lack the normal attributes of those devices. That is why we held in <i>In re Marchiando,</i> 13 F.3d 1111 (7th Cir.1994), that a state law calling the proceeds of lottery-ticket sales \"trust funds\" had no effect in bankruptcy, for the state had not required retailers to use normal trust devices. The law at issue in <i>Marchiando</i> amounted to little more than an effort by the state to prefer its claims as a creditor over those of the retailer's other creditors. Bankruptcy law depends on, and implements, entitlements defined by state law, see, e.g., <i>Butner v. United States,</i> 440 U.S. 48, 54, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136 (1979); <i>In re Wayco,</i> 947 F.2d 1330, 1332 (7th Cir.1991) (applying this principle to ascertaining whether a trust had been created), but which of these entitlements is subject to discharge or a trustee's avoiding power is beyond state control. (Unless, of course, Congress decides to recognize local rules, as it has done in providing that debtors may choose between the exemptions provided by federal and state law.
