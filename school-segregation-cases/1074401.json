The referendum held\n\non   dissolution     failed,      and    plaintiffs   did        not    pursue    the\n\nstatutory processes for withdrawal and modification of the tax\n\nallocation method for Central Regional.                   Plaintiffs have not\n\nasserted a cognizable constitutional or other claim that would\n\nprovide any legal or equitable basis for judicial intervention\n\nand relief.     Moreover, even if we held that plaintiffs exhausted\n\ntheir administrative remedies and are subject to a substantially\n\ninequitable tax allocation, they would not be entitled to the\n\nextraordinary       equitable     relief      afforded      in     Petition       for\n\nAuthorization to Conduct a Referendum on Withdrawal of North\n\nHaledon    School    District     from    the   Passaic     County       Manchester\n\nRegional    High    School    District,      181   N.J.    161     (2004)    (North\n\nHaledon).    Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n\n\n2\n  Cross-appellants only sought dissolution of Central Regional,\nand the Seaside Heights Board of Education additionally sought\nto withdraw along with Seaside Park.\n\n\n\n                                         4                                  A-0743-10T4\n\f    We    place    this     appeal    in    context    by    first     reciting      the\n\nhistory of regional school districts, including the history of\n\ntheir funding, and the statutory mechanisms for dissolving or\n\nwithdrawing      from   a   regional       school   district.          We   will   then\n\ndiscuss   the     specifics      of   Central       Regional     and    the    subject\n\nlitigation.\n\n                                           I.\n\n    In    l93l    the     Legislature      authorized      the   establishment         of\n\nregionalized school districts.                  L. 1931, c. 275, § 1.              Costs\n\nwere to be apportioned among constituent districts \"upon the\n\nbasis of ratables.\"          L. 1931, c. 275, § 8.             The \"average daily\n\nenrollment\"      method     of   apportionment       was    introduced        in   1953,\n\ni.e., per pupil basis, as an alternative to the existing ratable\n\nmethod and was made available to all regional school districts\n\nin 1955 subject to approval by the electorate.                          See Berkeley\n\nHeights Twp. v. Bd. of Educ., 23 N.J. 276, 283 (1957).\n\n    In a series of decisions in the 1970s, the Supreme Court\n\nheld the existing system of public school funding in New Jersey\n\nunconstitutional based upon discrepancies in dollar input per\n\npupil, denying a thorough and efficient education, and required\n\nthe Legislature to adjust the funding methods.

Cahill, 62 N.J.\n\n473 (1973).\n\n    In      response,      the    Legislature          passed        an     amendment      to\n\nN.J.S.A.    18A:13-23      in    l975   that        altered   the         means   by    which\n\nregional school districts were to be funded from a per pupil\n\nbasis to an equalized value of real estate situated in each\n\ndistrict,    which   shifted       costs       to    municipalities          with      higher\n\nproperty values.3          N. Haledon, supra, 181 N.J. at 165.                            The\n\nLegislature also adopted procedures for initiating withdrawal\n\nfrom a limited purpose regional school district,4 including an\n\napplication    to    the    county      superintendent          to    investigate         the\n\nadvisability of withdrawal or dissolution, N.J.S.A. 18A:13-51; a\n\nreport from the county superintendent, N.J.S.A. 18A:13-52 and -\n\n\n3\n  In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that the 1975 Act was\nunconstitutional as applied as it did not provide a thorough and\nefficient system of education to pupils residing in poorer urban\ndistricts, and ordered the Act to be amended or new legislation\npassed in order to ensure proper funding for those districts.\nAbbott v. Burke, 119 N.J. 287, 295, 384-85 (1990) (Abbott II).\nThe Abbott litigation continues to this day.      See Abbott v.\nBurke, 206 N.J. 332 (2011).\n4\n  Limited purpose regional school districts operate one or more\nof the following:     \"elementary schools, junior high schools,\nhigh schools, vocational schools, special schools, health\nfacilities or particular educational services or facilities.\"\nN.J.S.A. 18A:13-2(b).\n\n\n\n                                           6                                        A-0743-10T4\n\f53; a petition to the Commissioner of Education (Commissioner)\n\nfor permission to conduct a referendum, N.J.S.A. 18A:13-54 and -\n\n55;    a    report      from    the    Board     of       Review   (Board)     granting   or\n\ndenying      the       petition,      N.J.S.A.        18A:13-56;     and   a    referendum,\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:13-57 to -59.                  L. 1975, c. 360.\n\n       In 1993, the Legislature again amended N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23\n\nto allow regional districts to choose among equalized valuation,\n\nper pupil enrollment, or a combination of the two through voter\n\napproval at an annual or special election.                         L. 1993, c. 67, § 1;\n\nN.     Haledon,        supra,    181    N.J.         at    166.      The   goal    of   this\n\nlegislation was to \"encourage[] the formation of regional school\n\ndistricts          by       allowing          school          districts         considering\n\nregionalization greater freedom in determining how costs should\n\nbe apportioned among the constituent districts.\"                               Statement to\n\nAssembly Substitute for A. 1822 and 1063 (Feb. 8, 1993).                                   In\n\nthis regard, the Legislature acknowledged that the requirement\n\nof cost apportionment based on equalized valuation acted as \"a\n\ndisincentive to regionalization for certain districts which have\n\nhigh       property      values       and    a       small   pupil    population,       when\n\nconsidering joining with a municipality that has low property\n\nvalues      and    a    large   pupil       population.\"           See,    e.g.,   Assembly\n\nEducation Committee Statement to A. 1822 (Oct. 1, 1992); Senate\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7                                 A-0743-10T4\n\fEducation Committee Statement to Assembly Substitute for A. 1822\n\nand 1063 (Dec. 10, 1992).\n\n    Also        in    1993,   the    Legislature            revised       the    law   which\n\nprovided    a    procedure     for    withdrawal            from    a    regional      school\n\ndistrict by adding a parallel procedure for the dissolution of a\n\ndistrict.        L.   1993,   c.     255.       This    amendment         set    forth    the\n\nfollowing standard for determining if a referendum on withdrawal\n\nor dissolution was successful:\n\n            For withdrawal from a regional district, the\n            question shall be deemed adopted if it\n            receives an affirmative vote of a majority\n            of the votes cast within the withdrawing\n            constituent district and it receives an\n            affirmative vote of a majority of the\n            overall votes cast in the entire regional\n            district.    For dissolution of a regional\n            district, the question shall be deemed\n            adopted if it receives an affirmative vote\n            in a majority of the individual constituent\n            districts and it receives an affirmative\n            vote of a majority of the overall votes cast\n            in the entire regional district.\n\n            [L. 1993, c. 255, § 8; N.J.S.A. 18A:13-59.]\n\nThe Legislature also authorized the State Board of Education to\n\npromulgate regulations to effectuate the provisions of the Act.\n\nL. 1993, c. 255, § 14.\n\n    In 2004, the Supreme Court decided North Haledon.                                  There,\n\nNorth Haledon, Haledon, and Prospect Park had formed a limited\n\npurpose     regional      school      district         in     the       1950s,    providing\n\nsecondary education at Manchester Regional High School using a\n\n\n\n                                            8                                       A-0743-10T4\n\fper pupil method for apportioning costs; however, in l975 the\n\nfunding method was changed to an equalized valuation.                          Supra,\n\n181 N.J. at 165.           Consequently, because North Haledon had the\n\nhighest tax base of the three municipalities, its share of the\n\noperating costs significantly increased disproportionally to the\n\nother two districts.         Id. at 165-66.\n\n       After       the   1993      amendment,       North    Haledon       pursued     a\n\nreferendum that would return the district to per pupil cost\n\napportionment, which failed because it did not garner a majority\n\nof voters in Haledon and Prospect Park.                     Id. at 166.      By 1994,\n\nNorth Haledon was paying over half of the district's operating\n\ncosts and more than two to three times per pupil than that paid\n\nby Haledon and Prospect Park, respectively.                        Ibid.     In 2001,\n\nNorth Haledon was paying $18,400 per pupil, while Haledon was\n\npaying $5300, and Prospect Park was paying $3400.                    Id. at 169.\n\n       In 1998, North Haledon initiated the process of withdrawal.\n\nAlthough the county superintendent's investigative report did\n\nnot favor withdrawal, North Haledon petitioned the Commissioner\n\nfor permission to hold a referendum pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:13-\n\n54.          Id.   at    166-67.       The       Board   granted     the    petition,\n\nnotwithstanding that North Haledon's withdrawal would result in\n\na     nine    percent     reduction    in        white   students    in    Manchester\n\nRegional's student body.              Id. at 167-72.         The Board found the\n\n\n\n\n                                             9                                A-0743-10T4\n\fracial impact negligible because, based upon demographic changes\n\nin the three sending districts, whether North Haledon stayed or\n\nwithdrew,     the    minority       population    at    the    high     school    would\n\ncontinue to rise and the white population would continue to\n\ndecline.

Ibid.        The    voters    approved       the\n\nreferendum at a special election, and the Commissioner set a\n\ndate for North Haledon's withdrawal from the district.                        Ibid.\n\n      We reversed the Board, 363 N.J. Super. 130, 144 (App. Div.\n\n2003), disagreeing that the anticipated nine percent decrease in\n\nthe   white    student       population    of     Manchester      Regional       was    a\n\nnegligible impact.           The Supreme Court affirmed, holding that\n\n              the constitutional imperative to prevent\n              segregation in our public schools applies as\n              well to the Board within the ambit of the\n              exercise   of  its   responsibilities  under\n              N.J.S.A. 18A:13-56(b)(4), which requires the\n              Board to deny a withdrawal petition for\n              \"[a]ny other reason, which it may deem to be\n              sufficient.\"\n\n              [N.

We conclude that the Board's\n         decision permitting a referendum on the\n         question of withdrawal is not sustainable as\n         a matter of law, and affirm the decision of\n         the   Appellate   Division  reversing   that\n         decision.\n\n         [Id. at 184.]\n\n    However, the Court acknowledged North Haledon's justifiable\n\nconcern about the disproportional tax burden shouldered by its\n\ncitizens as compared to the other constituent municipalities,\n\nid. at 184-85, so it modified the judgment and remanded to the\n\nCommissioner \"to develop, in consultation with the constituent\n\nmunicipalities, an equitable cost apportionment scheme for the\n\nRegional District.\"   Id. at 186.    In so ruling, the Court held:\n\n         the constitutional imperative to address\n         racial segregation requires the Board to\n         compel North Haledon to remain in the\n         Regional District despite the tax burden on\n         its citizens. . . . [W]hen a constituent\n         municipality is compelled to participate in\n         a Regional District, N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23 is\n         not applicable and the Commissioner may\n         determine cost allocations among and between\n         Haledon, Prospect Park, and North Haledon.\n\n         [Ibid.]\n\n    On remand, by letter dated September 21, 2004, the Attorney\n\nGeneral's office advised the Commissioner:\n\n         You have requested advice concerning whether\n         the authority granted to you by the Supreme\n         Court in [North Haledon] to equitably revise\n         the    cost     apportionments    among   the\n         constituent districts in the Manchester\n         Regional   High    School  District   may  be\n\n\n\n                                11                          A-0743-10T4\n\f          utilized in other situations.        You are\n          advised that such power may be exercised by\n          the Commissioner where the relative tax\n          burden of the constituent districts in a\n          regional district is inequitable and the\n          Board of Review (or a reviewing court)\n          denies   dissolution    or    withdrawal   of\n          constituent districts from the regional\n          school    district    because    dissolution/\n          withdrawal would result in deficiencies of a\n          constitutional dimension.\n\n               . . . .\n\n               In sum, the Commissioner is authorized\n          to    act   notwithstanding      the    statutory\n          provisions governing apportionment of costs\n          among constituent school districts of a\n          regional school district as set forth in\n          N.J.S.A.     18A:13-23,    in      a    situation\n          substantially similar to that present in\n          [North    Haledon].        Specifically,      the\n          Commissioner may determine cost allocations\n          among and between the constituent districts\n          where    there   is    the   presence     of   an\n          inequitable tax burden -- which could be\n          demonstrated    by   a   constituent     district\n          unsuccessfully     seeking    to     change   the\n          apportionment methodology -- and due to a\n          constitutional imperative such as addressing\n          racial segregation, the Board of Review (or\n          a court reviewing the Board's determination)\n          determines that the regional district must\n          remain intact.\n\n          [(Emphasis added).]\n\n    By letter of January 18, 2005, the Commissioner advised\n\nthat cost apportionment in North Haledon would be sixty-seven\n\npercent   equalized    valuation   and    thirty-three   percent   pupil\n\nenrollment,   phased   in   over   four   years.    In   so   doing,   he\n\ncautioned:\n\n\n\n                                   12                           A-0743-10T4\n\f           I stress that the apportionment methodology\n           [adopted] is a unique response to the\n           circumstances   existing  in    the  present\n           matter, and that it is neither binding on\n           the regional district in the event that the\n           voters of the district and its constituents\n           subsequently   elect   to  approve  a   cost\n           apportionment method of the regional board's\n           own devising pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23,\n           nor intended to be precedent-setting in any\n           other situation where cost apportionment is\n           at issue among the constituent members of a\n           regional district.\n\n    On numerous occasions both before and after North Haledon,\n\nthe Legislature has considered issues involving regional school\n\ndistricts,    including      its    funding      and     the    procedures         for\n\nwithdrawal    from     or   dissolution     of    such    districts,         but    no\n\nsignificant changes have been made.               Seaside Park has been an\n\nactive participant in those discussions.\n\n    For example, in 1994, the Senate introduced S. 1313, which\n\nwould have made it easier for a district to withdraw from a\n\nlimited    purpose     regional    school     district,        but    it    was    not\n\nenacted.     In   1996,     the    Legislature     established        a    panel    to\n\ninvestigate regionalization.          L. 1996, c. 138, § 31.                The New\n\nJersey Regionalization Advisory Panel issued its final report in\n\nJanuary 1998.        See N.J. Regionalization Advisory Panel Final\n\nReport        (Jan.          1998),         http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/\n\nPropertyTaxSession/OPI/FinalReport.pdf.                  It     recognized         the\n\ndisincentives     to    regionalization,         including,      in       part,    tax\n\n\n\n\n                                       13                                    A-0743-10T4\n\fapportionments, and encouraged regionalization and the increased\n\nuse   of   shared   services     to    improve     efficiency         and    maximize\n\nfacilities    and     professional       resources       available          to      local\n\ndistricts.      Id.    at   2,   6-7.        The   Panel       also    recommended\n\n\"legislation that would direct and empower the Commissioner of\n\nEducation,    supported     by   the     county    superintendents               and    in\n\ncooperation     with      the    local       boards       of    education              and\n\nadministrations, to identify school districts that might benefit\n\nfinancially   and     educationally      from    either    regionalization              or\n\nconsolidation of services with other school districts[,]\" and\n\nlegally mandated regionalization where appropriate.

See Assembly Task Force on School\n\nDistrict    Regionalization     Findings   and   Recommendations,\n\nhttp://www.njleg.state.nj.us/legislativepub/reports/school.pdf.\n\nIt found, in pertinent part, that:\n\n           4.    The disproportionate distribution of\n           costs among constituent municipalities in\n           regionalized    districts   is   a    major\n           disincentive to regionalization.   However,\n           any formula change designed to bring parity\n           in the per pupil costs of the constituent\n           municipalities will result in \"winners\" and\n           \"losers.\"\n\n           5.   Smaller, more affluent communities in\n           regional school districts, which are locked\n           into   paying   based   on   their  equalized\n           valuation, as opposed to on a per-pupil\n           basis, may wind up paying more than what\n           they   otherwise   would   pay   in  a   non-\n           regionalized district.\n\n           6.

Many districts exhibit concern over\n             regionalizing because the deregionalization\n             process proves rigid and difficult.   Major\n             issues relating to division of debt service\n             and assets, personnel retention policies,\n             and the ability of each resulting district\n             to adequately provide for the education of\n             their students, must be considered.\n\n             9.    Withdrawal   from    a   regionalized\n             arrangement by a constituent municipality\n             may prove overwhelming since the current\n             procedures require a majority of voters\n             across the regional district in addition to\n             a majority of voters in the constituent\n             municipality which wants to exit from the\n             arrangement.\n\n       The   task    force    recommended,             in   pertinent         part:     (1)\n\nrestructuring        of   regionalization                agreements        \"to        allow\n\nreassessment of cost distribution if the per pupil cost deviates\n\nby more than 10% between any two constituent municipalities of\n\nthe    regional     district\";       (2)    modification          of    the     equalized\n\nvaluation method for apportioning costs to a \"fairer formula\"\n\nthat     would       \"provide        more         equity        among         constituent\n\nmunicipalities,\"       with     \"a    realistic         mechanism       which     compels\n\nequitable     adjustments        in        the        distribution        costs       among\n\nconstituent      municipalities       for       the    small    number     of    existing\n\nregionalized      districts      which      currently          evidence    an     extreme\n\ndisproportionate distribution of costs\"; and (3) amendment of\n\n\n\n                                           16                                     A-0743-10T4\n\fthe    withdrawal    statutes,      allowing    a     municipality   to   opt   out\n\n\"without major obstacles when a specified threshold deviation in\n\nthe per pupil amount paid by each constituent municipality is\n\nreached, perhaps 10%\" and providing a mechanism \"to join another\n\nregional district or enter into a sending/receiving relationship\n\nwith another regional district.\"              Ibid.\n\n       In 2002, the Legislature considered S. 295, which would\n\nhave    reduced    per-pupil     cost    disparities      in   certain    regional\n\nschool districts and increased state aid to those districts to\n\noffset    the     reduction    in    municipal        contributions.      Central\n\nRegional supported the measure, but it did not pass.\n\n       In 2005, the Office of Legislative Services (OLS) issued a\n\nBackground Report, Regional School Districts:                   Apportionment of\n\nCosts in the Constituent Municipalities (July 20, 2005).6                       The\n\nOLS acknowledged the disincentives to regionalization, including\n\nthe    perception    of   inequity      felt    by    wealthier   municipalities\n\npaying based upon equalized property value.                    It also noted the\n\ndifficulty in altering the funding method for currently existing\n\nregional school districts:\n\n                 A referendum on a change in the\n            apportionment method must be approved \"by\n            the voters of each municipality.\"    Because\n            of this voting requirement, a change in the\n            method   of  cost  apportionment  is   quite\n\n6\n    http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/PropertyTaxSession/OPI/bg123.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                         17                               A-0743-10T4\n\f             difficult to accomplish. Such a change will\n             always create \"winners\" and \"losers\" among\n             the constituent municipalities, and those\n             municipalities slated to \"lose\" will not\n             vote in favor of a change that will result\n             in increases in their tax levy.              The\n             constituent   municipalities    which    benefit\n             from the current apportionment method are\n             granted   effective   veto   power    over   any\n             possible change.\n\n       In   2006,    the     Legislature      created      four    joint    legislative\n\ncommittees to make recommendations regarding proposals to reform\n\nproperty     taxes,    including       the    Joint     Legislative     Committee       on\n\nPublic School Funding Reform and the Joint Legislative Committee\n\non   Government      Consolidation       and      Shared   Services.

Pertinent to the present appeal, the\n\nCommittee recognized the value of regionalization as well as the\n\nfinancial    disincentives    to    the    creation    of   regional    school\n\ndistricts,       and   recommended     adopting       the    Department       of\n\nEducation's recommendations regarding the apportionment of costs\n\nin regional districts as follows:\n\n            Under the revisions, State aid and local\n            property    tax     contributions    would    be\n            calculated separately for each constituent\n            municipality in a regional district.       [And]\n            [n]o jurisdiction in a regional school\n            district would pay a tax levy per pupil\n            which    exceeds    the    actual   per    pupil\n            expenditures     of    the    regional   school\n            district.\n\n            While some may be concerned that this change\n            would artificially cap the burden of some\n            taxpayers who have a greater ability to pay\n            under the measures employed, it is believed\n            that the policy and educational benefits of\n            having regional school districts outweigh\n            this concern.\n\n    Also in 2006, S. 1585 was introduced, 212th Leg.,8 which\n\nwould have provided for the reduction of per pupil expenditures\n\n\n8\n  S. 1585 can be traced back to A. 2623, from the 209th Leg.\n(2000-2001 Legislative Session).    In 2001, A. 2623 was\n                                                  (continued)\n\n\n                                      19                               A-0743-10T4\n\ffor     certain     constituent     municipalities     of   regional    school\n\ndistricts.        It apparently was designed to eliminate the funding\n\ncomplained about by Seaside Park.            It would have reduced the tax\n\nburden    for     municipalities    that    are   constituents   of    regional\n\nschool districts but: (1) comprise less than 10% of the regional\n\nschool district enrollment; (2) have a tax levy to support the\n\nregional school district of more than $1 million; and (3) have a\n\nper pupil expenditure that is more than 200% of the average per\n\npupil    expenditure     of   all    constituent    municipalities      of   the\n\nregional district.        State aid would have been provided to the\n\nregional school district to compensate for the loss of revenue\n\nfrom the constituent municipality.                The bill, however, never\n\nproceeded beyond introduction, and it was not carried over or\n\nre-introduced in any more legislative sessions.\n\n      Additionally, A. 3261/S. 2289 and A. 3422 were introduced\n\nin 2008, 213th Leg., which were carried over or reintroduced as\n\nA. 1327/S. 1638 in 2010, 214th Leg.                 These bills would have\n\nrevised the voting requirements necessary for the dissolution of\n\n\n\n(continued)\nintroduced, referred to two assembly committees, and also\nreported out of committee with a second reading and fiscal\nestimates (with Seaside Park identified in the 2001 fiscal\nestimate as one of the municipalities that would experience tax\nsavings).   However, it did not pass, and was carried over in\nlegislative sessions through 2006, introduced as S. 1585, but\nnever went anywhere.\n\n\n\n                                       20                              A-0743-10T4\n\flimited purpose regional school districts.                     They would have made\n\ndissolution easier by eliminating the requirement that there be\n\na majority of the overall vote as cast; instead, dissolution\n\ncould    occur   with      an   affirmative     vote     in    a     majority    of    the\n\nindividual constituent districts.                However, the bills did not\n\nprogress past introduction in either legislative session.\n\n                                          II.\n\n    We turn now to the specifics of our case.                           In the early\n\n1950s,    Seaside     Heights,        Seaside   Park,    Island       Heights,     Ocean\n\nGate, Berkeley Township, and Lacey Township sent students to\n\nToms River schools on a tuition basis.                   In 1953, however, Toms\n\nRiver    advised      that       it     could    no     longer        continue        that\n\nrelationship.         By    public     referendum       held    in    1954,     the    six\n\nmunicipalities      formed      Central    Regional      as     a    limited    purpose\n\nschool district to educate their junior and senior high school\n\nstudents (grades seven to twelve).9                   Central Regional's school\n\nbuildings are located in Berkeley Township, which is the largest\n\nmunicipality     in     terms     of     geography,      population,       registered\n\nvoters, and student enrollment.\n\n\n\n\n9\n  The boards of education of the constituent municipalities\npassed resolutions to hold July 1 and September 1, 1954\nreferenda to allow voters to decide whether to create the\nDistrict. The first referendum did not pass; the second passed.\n\n\n\n                                          21                                    A-0743-10T4\n\f      In    the    1954    referendum        by    which    Central     Regional      was\n\nformed, the voters agreed to apportion costs based on per pupil\n\nenrollment.          However,     the   1975       legislation        altered   Central\n\nRegional's funding mechanism to an equalized property valuation\n\nbasis.      L. 1975, c. 212.          Although the 1993 legislation allowed\n\nfor   changes      to   the   funding    structure         of   regionalized     school\n\ndistricts, no such change has ever been effectuated at Central\n\nRegional.\n\n      In 1976, Seaside Heights, Seaside Park, and Lacey Township\n\npetitioned        the   Department      of        Education     for    permission      to\n\nwithdraw from Central Regional.                    On May 20, 1977, the Board\n\npermitted Lacey Township to conduct a referendum, but rejected\n\nthe petitions of Seaside Heights and Seaside Park on the ground\n\nthat the proposed alternative to Central Regional, a sending-\n\nreceiving relationship with the Point Pleasant School District,\n\nwas   not    viable.          Lacey   Township's         withdrawal      from   Central\n\nRegional was approved by voter referendum held in 1977.10\n\n      In     1981,      Island    Heights         and    Seaside      Heights    passed\n\nresolutions         requesting        that         the     county      superintendent\n\ninvestigate the advisability of their withdrawal from Central\n\nRegional.       Island Heights later withdrew its petition after a\n\n\n10\n  The withdrawal became effective on July 1, 1978, but for ease\nof reference in this opinion we will use the 1977 date.\n\n\n\n                                          22                                    A-0743-10T4\n\fjoint meeting of the constituent communities, and the county\n\nsuperintendent issued his report regarding Seaside Heights.                                     In\n\nl983,    Seaside       Heights       then       petitioned         the    Commissioner         for\n\npermission        to     conduct       a    referendum            regarding        withdrawal.\n\nSeaside Park objected, and the Board denied the petition.\n\n       In   1985,      the    Berkeley      Township         Board       of   Education       (the\n\nrespective Boards of Education will hereafter be referred to as\n\nBOE) commissioned a feasibility study regarding its potential\n\nwithdrawal      from      Central       Regional.                The   author      recommended\n\nwithdrawal, but there is no record of any further action.\n\n       In November 1995, the Seaside Park BOE approved withdrawal\n\nfrom Central Regional and pursued a send-receive relationship\n\nwith    Point     Pleasant         under    a    pilot       program.          However,       this\n\nattempt to withdraw was unsuccessful.\n\n       In   October          1998,     Seaside            Park     passed      a     resolution\n\nrequesting that Central Regional consider the resolution \"as a\n\npetition     seeking         an    alteration        in    the    formula      for    municipal\n\ncontributions to the District, so as to return to a per pupil\n\ncost formula[.]\"             The resolution otherwise reflected an intent\n\nby    Seaside     Park       \"to    seek    all      appropriate         legal     redress      to\n\nwithdraw\" from Central Regional.                          The resolution also directs\n\nthe     Borough     Clerk-Administrator               to     promptly         forward    it     to\n\nCentral Regional.                 The record reflects that Central Regional\n\n\n\n\n                                                23                                      A-0743-10T4\n\freceived the resolution and discussed it, but does not reflect\n\nany decision by Central Regional or further action by Seaside\n\nPark regarding the resolution.\n\n      In 2003, Seaside Park adopted a resolution requesting that\n\nCentral Regional place a referendum on the ballot for voters in\n\nthe   constituent      municipalities              authorizing      a   change       in   the\n\nfunding formula for Central Regional to sixty percent equalized\n\nvaluation and forty percent per pupil.                     In contrast to the prior\n\nresolution, this resolution contained no provision directing its\n\nsubmission to Central Regional and the record does not reflect\n\nanything    further     with     respect       to     this    resolution,       including\n\nwhether it was sent to Central Regional.\n\n      In    April     2005,     at     Seaside       Park's    request,        Donald      E.\n\nBeineman,    Ed.D.,     and     James     L.       Kirtland,     C.P.A.,    prepared        a\n\npreliminary    feasibility           study,    opining       that   Seaside      Park     was\n\nsubsidizing     the     other        constituent         municipalities        and     could\n\nrealize    significant        cost    savings       by    withdrawing     from       Central\n\nRegional and entering into a sending-receiving relationship with\n\nnearby Toms River or Point Pleasant, or by Central Regional\n\nbeing   dissolved      and    Berkeley        Township       creating    its     own      K-12\n\ndistrict.     Accordingly, in June 2005, Seaside Park and its BOE\n\npassed resolutions formally instituting the instant process by\n\nrequesting    that     the     Ocean     County          Superintendent    of        Schools\n\n\n\n\n                                              24                                  A-0743-10T4\n\fconduct an investigation into the advisability of Seaside Park's\n\nwithdrawal        from,      or     the     dissolution        of,      Central     Regional\n\npursuant   to      N.J.S.A.        18A:13-51.           Seaside      Heights      and    Island\n\nHeights    and       their        Boards     of    Education         passed       resolutions\n\nrequesting      an    investigation           as    to    only       the    dissolution        of\n\nCentral Regional.\n\n      Central        Regional           retained        its      own       school       finance\n\nconsultant, Melvin L. Wyns, who authored a report in November\n\n2005.      He      recommended          opposition        to     both      dissolution        and\n\nwithdrawal based on the adverse tax impact it would have on the\n\nconstituent municipalities.\n\n      In March 2006, the county superintendent issued a report\n\nadvising against dissolution.                 He found the following advantages\n\nto dissolution: reduced administrative costs by consolidation,\n\nanticipated       increases         in     state        aid    for     select     districts,\n\nreallocation of the tax levy, and the ability of each school\n\ndistrict     to      assess       and     evaluate       their       present      educational\n\nconcerns     during        the       process.            He      found      the     following\n\ndisadvantages:            possible         lack    of    continuity         of    educational\n\nprograms, need to establish new relationships between sending\n\nand receiving districts, effects on staff at Central Regional\n\nand   Berkeley       Township       elementary       school      regarding        tenure      and\n\nseniority, negative tax levy impact on Berkeley Township and\n\n\n\n\n                                              25                                        A-0743-10T4\n\fOcean   Gate,     potential     increased        cost    per     student     ratios    in\n\nBerkeley Township, and lost ability to share unique costs among\n\nall   constituent      districts.      The       superintendent        concluded      the\n\ndisadvantages of dissolution outweighed the advantages.                              Most\n\nnotable was the negative impact on the taxpayers of Berkeley\n\nTownship and Ocean Gate, \"who represent over 80% of the resident\n\npopulation.\"\n\n       In April 2006, Seaside Park and its BOE filed a petition\n\nwith the State Department of Education seeking permission to\n\nconduct a referendum on withdrawing from or dissolving Central\n\nRegional pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:13-54.                   They requested, in the\n\nevent the Commissioner denied a referendum or the referendum was\n\ndefeated,       that   she    \"use   her        inherent       power   to   create    an\n\nequitable tax apportionment formula, based in whole or in part\n\non a per-pupil formulation, to fund the Central Regional School\n\nDistrict.\"      Central Regional opposed the petition.\n\n       The Board held hearings in July and August 2006.                       It voted\n\nto grant Seaside Park's petition for a referendum on dissolution\n\nof    Central    Regional,      memorialized        in     a    written     opinion   of\n\nSeptember 1, 2006.           See N.J.S.A. 18A:13-56.             The referendum was\n\nheld on March 13, 2007, and was defeated by the voters because\n\nalthough the majority of the constituent municipalities favored\n\ndissolution, a majority of the overall voters in the District\n\n\n\n\n                                           26                                  A-0743-10T4\n\fdid not.       See N.J.S.A. 18A:13-59.               The referendum passed in\n\nSeaside    Park,    Seaside      Heights,      and   Island   Heights,       but   was\n\ndefeated in Berkeley Township and Ocean Gate.11\n\n                                      III.\n\n      In May 2007, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Chancery\n\nDivision, commencing this litigation, and a month later filed a\n\nfirst amended complaint.           Defendants and cross-appellants filed\n\nresponsive pleadings, and the Seaside Heights BOE filed a third-\n\nparty complaint.         Island Heights and its BOE and the Seaside\n\nHeights BOE sought dissolution of Central Regional, consistent\n\nwith the expressed desire of the majority of the voters in their\n\nmunicipalities.         Alternatively, the Seaside Heights BOE sought\n\npermission to withdraw with Seaside Park, but Island Heights did\n\nnot   seek    to   withdraw.       Both     municipalities         opposed   Seaside\n\nPark's unilateral withdrawal.             Moreover, neither Seaside Heights\n\nnor Island Heights, or their respective Boards of Education,\n\nsought alteration of the current funding formula.\n\n      In     December    2007,     plaintiffs        filed    a    second    amended\n\ncomplaint seeking an order:           (1) compelling the Commissioner to\n\nexercise     her   inherent      equitable      powers   to       dissolve   Central\n\n11\n   At that time, Berkeley Township had about seven times the\nnumber of registered voters of Seaside Heights, Seaside Park,\nand Island Heights, combined.    Moreover, Berkeley Township had\n1709 pupils in the District while Seaside Heights, Seaside Park,\nand Island Heights had a total of 311 pupils in the District.\n\n\n\n                                          27                                 A-0743-10T4\n\fRegional, permit Seaside Park to withdraw, or change Central\n\nRegional's funding method because the current allocation system\n\nis inequitable as applied to them (count one); (2) declaring the\n\nl975   and     l993   school   funding    legislation        unconstitutional        as\n\napplied to plaintiffs because it impairs their contractual right\n\nto per pupil funding (count two); (3) declaring the subject\n\nlegislation unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs because it\n\nconstitutes      a    taking   of    their    property      right    to   per    pupil\n\nfunding without just compensation (count three); (4) requesting\n\nthe    court    exercise    its     equitable    power      to   dissolve     Central\n\nRegional, permit plaintiffs' withdrawal, or change the funding\n\nmethod    for    Central   Regional      because      the   statutory     remedy     is\n\nillusory due to the larger number of voters in Berkeley Township\n\n(count four); (5) declaring the subject legislation violative of\n\nplaintiffs'      procedural due process because it provides Berkeley\n\nTownship with the absolute power to block any change in the\n\nallocation      method     (count    five);     (6)    declaring      the     subject\n\nlegislation      violative     of   plaintiffs'       substantive      due    process\n\nbecause the amendments are not rationally related to any alleged\n\nlegislative objective and deprive them of their property (tax\n\ndollars and contract rights) (count six); and (7) declaring the\n\ncurrent      allocation    method     does      not   provide       Seaside     Park's\n\nstudents with an efficient system of education because of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         28                                   A-0743-10T4\n\fdisproportional monetary burden on its taxpayers (count seven).\n\nDefendants filed responsive pleadings.\n\n      Prior      to     the    second      amended      complaint       being     filed,     the\n\nCommissioner           and    Berkeley          Township       moved     to     dismiss      the\n\ncomplaint        and     cross-complaint.                Central       Regional        and   the\n\nBerkeley Township BOE joined in the motion.                            Plaintiffs opposed\n\nthe   motion      on     the    basis      that       the     statutory       procedure      for\n\nwithdrawal or dissolution is illusory given the disparity of\n\nvoter    registration           in    Seaside         Park     and     Berkeley       Township.\n\nFollowing argument, Judge Frank A. Buczynski, Jr. issued an oral\n\ndecision and order on February 21, 2008, dismissing several of\n\nthe   claims      and    remanding         an    issue       for    clarification       by     the\n\nCommissioner.\n\n      The     Commissioner           had    sought       dismissal       of     the     amended\n\ncomplaint on the grounds of plaintiffs' failure to exhaust all\n\nadministrative remedies of modification of the current funding\n\nallocation,       permission          to    withdraw         from     the     District,      and\n\ndissolution of the District.                     See N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23.3, -54, -\n\n55, -56, and -57.             The court noted that Seaside Park had passed\n\na resolution petitioning Central Regional to alter the formula\n\nfor municipal contributions in l998 under N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23,\n\nwhich    apparently           was    ignored;         however,       plaintiffs       waited    a\n\ndecade      to    seek        judicial      review       or        assistance     to     compel\n\n\n\n\n                                                 29                                    A-0743-10T4\n\fcompliance.      Accordingly, the court concluded that plaintiffs\n\nhad not exhausted their statutory remedies for modification of\n\nthe current funding method for Central Regional.                    Dissolution,\n\nhowever,   had    already     been    voted    upon    by     the    constituent\n\nmunicipalities    and    rejected.      The    order   thus    reflected    that\n\ncount one was dismissed with prejudice insofar as plaintiffs and\n\nthird-party      plaintiffs     sought        an   order       directing      the\n\nCommissioner to exercise any authority to dissolve or permit\n\nwithdrawal from the District.\n\n      The remaining claims in count one relating to the statutory\n\nprocess for modifying the regional funding allocation method and\n\nthe   statutory     procedures       for      withdrawal      of     constituent\n\nmunicipalities    were    dismissed    without     prejudice.         The   order\n\nfurther provided that \"[a]s to the claim that plaintiffs have\n\nnot exhausted all administrative remedies,\" any public body can\n\nrequest in writing pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23 that Central\n\nRegional consider holding a referendum to change the current\n\nregional funding allocation, and failure of Central Regional to\n\ntimely respond will be deemed a denial of the request.\n\n      The court, however, remanded the matter to the Commissioner\n\n\"for clarification as to whether the Board of Review considered\n\nthe petition for an order to conduct a referendum on the issue\n\nof withdrawal on the merits.\"          The court required the Board to\n\n\n\n\n                                      30                                A-0743-10T4\n\fadvise in writing that it addressed the issue of withdrawal, or\n\nif    it     did     not,    to   consider       the    issue   \"as      directed    by     the\n\nCommissioner.\"\n\n       The court also dismissed the constitutional claims (counts\n\ntwo, three, five, and six) with prejudice as brought by the\n\ngovernmental entities, but denied the motion to dismiss as to\n\nthe    individual          taxpayer        plaintiffs.       Specifically,         the   court\n\nheld that Seaside Park and its BOE lacked standing to pursue the\n\nclaims       of    impairment         of    contracts,      taking    of    property,       and\n\nprocedural and substantive due process violations based on the\n\nprinciple, with citing reference, that municipalities and their\n\nboards       of    education      as       political   subdivisions         generally     lack\n\nstanding to assert constitutional claims against other political\n\nbodies such as the Commissioner.\n\n       The        court     further    dismissed       counts     four     and   seven    with\n\nprejudice as to all parties based on a failure to state a claim.\n\nAs     to     count       four,   the       court    held    that     the    mere    fact     a\n\nconstituent municipality may vote against the relief requested\n\nin a referendum does not make the remedy illusory as a matter of\n\nlaw,        noting    Lacey       Township's         withdrawal      from    the    District\n\nfollowing the 1975 revision.                   As to count seven, the court found\n\nthat plaintiffs failed to challenge any of the ten elements of a\n\n\n\n\n                                                31                                   A-0743-10T4\n\f\"thorough    and     efficient\"   education         articulated            in    Abbott    II,\n\nsupra, 119 N.J. at 350 n.23.\n\n      The only claims that survived the court's February 21, 2008\n\ndecision were those constitutional claims asserted on behalf of\n\nthe taxpayer plaintiffs in counts two, three, five, and six.\n\nSpecifically, those claims alleged that the l975 and l993 laws:\n\n(1) substantially impaired taxpayer plaintiffs' \"contracts\" with\n\nthe   regional     district;     (2)    constituted            a    taking      of   property\n\nwithout    just    compensation;        (3)    violated            taxpayer     plaintiffs'\n\nprocedural     due     process    rights;          and    (4)        violated        taxpayer\n\nplaintiffs' substantive due process rights.\n\n      Plaintiffs       moved     for     reconsideration.                 Following       oral\n\nargument on May 9, the court denied the motion on the record,\n\nmemorialized in an order of June 9, 2008.\n\n      On May 19, 2008, the Commissioner notified Judge Buczynski\n\nthat the Board only considered the issue of dissolution and not\n\nwhether     Seaside     Park     should       be    granted           a    referendum       on\n\nwithdrawal.       She explained that in Seaside Park's petition, the\n\nwithdrawal relief was only requested in the alternative if the\n\nBoard denied its request for a referendum on dissolution, which\n\nit did not.\n\n      By    resolution    dated        September         10,       2008,     Seaside      Park\n\napplied to the county superintendent for another investigation\n\n\n\n\n                                          32                                         A-0743-10T4\n\finto the advisability of Seaside Park's withdrawal from Central\n\nRegional.         Our     record    reflects       no   proceedings       on     this\n\napplication.\n\n       In response to the court's February 21, 2008 decision, by\n\nresolution of February 27, 2008, Seaside Park requested that\n\nCentral Regional conduct a public referendum regarding a revised\n\nfunding formula.          On April 21, 2009, a referendum was held with\n\nrespect to altering Central Regional's cost allocation method\n\nfrom equalized valuation to per pupil cost.                 It did not pass.\n\n       Seaside Park also pursued modification of the District's\n\nfunding formula with the Department of Education.                      By letters\n\ndated March 11, May 16, and July 29, 2008, the Mayor of Seaside\n\nPark    sought      the    Commissioner's      assistance      and   support       in\n\nresolving     the     \"inequitable     tax     apportionment\"        in     Central\n\nRegional.     The Commissioner responded to each of the letters,\n\nand    in   her   letter     of    August    18,    2008,    advised      that   the\n\nDepartment had reviewed the data Seaside Park provided and was\n\naware of the per pupil costs borne by the constituent members of\n\nCentral Regional.         She added:\n\n            The situation you described is not unlike\n            that     of     many     other    constituent\n            municipalities     involved    in    regional\n            districts where there is simultaneously a\n            wide   disparity   in   property  value   and\n            enrollment among the constituents.     As you\n            correctly pointed out, the existing tax\n            apportionment methodology, and any attempt\n\n\n\n                                        33                                 A-0743-10T4\n\f               to change it, is governed by statute.      I\n               recognize that it is often difficult and\n               sometimes impossible to get the statutory\n               voting majorities to effect the coveted\n               change.    Unfortunately, as Commissioner I\n               cannot impose that change, as I too must\n               adhere to the existing statute.     However,\n               with the recent passage of laws giving the\n               Executive County Superintendent a wide range\n               of authority to seek out and recommend\n               programs and services that lead to increased\n               efficiency at the district level, I will ask\n               that your district receive swift attention\n               in this matter.\n\n                    It is my hope that in cooperation with\n               the county office it may be possible to find\n               a solution to your problem that would be\n               acceptable to all of the parties involved,\n               and one that will not harm the school\n               district's ability to provide a quality\n               public school education to all of the\n               children.\n\n       In    2010,    the     parties      filed   cross-motions      for    summary\n\njudgment.        Following oral argument, by opinion and order of\n\nAugust 30, 2010, Judge Buczynski denied plaintiffs' motions and\n\ngranted      defendants'      motions      dismissing    the    remaining     counts\n\n(two, three, five, and six) as to the taxpayer plaintiffs.                         The\n\njudge       found    \"[t]he      record    [was]     bereft    of    any    evidence\n\nsupporting the existence of a contractual relationship between\n\nthe    parties[,]\"     expressly        concluding    the     resolutions    of    the\n\nconstituent districts to hold the 1954 referenda to allow voters\n\nto    decide    whether     to    create    the    District    did   not    meet   the\n\nrequirements of a valid contract.                   Nor was there a \"taking\"\n\n\n\n\n                                           34                                A-0743-10T4\n\fbecause     \"[p]laintiffs    did    not        hold      a     property         right    in    the\n\noriginal     funding   formula.\"             Similarly,         the     judge         held    that\n\n\"[p]laintiffs were not denied substantive due process because\n\n[they] did not hold a fundamental right in the funding scheme\n\nused for the District.\"\n\n      Judge    Buczynski    was     also           convinced         that       pursuing       the\n\n\"drastic remedy\" of \"exercising control over the Commissioner\n\nand   usurping     her     authority          is      not       warranted          under      the\n\n['undisputed material'] facts of this case\" and granting the\n\nextraordinary equitable remedies sought by plaintiffs of \"court\n\nordered     dissolution     of     the        District,         or      court      permission\n\nallowing Seaside Park to withdraw, or court ordered modification\n\nof    the    funding     formula,        .     .     .        without       a     finding       of\n\nconstitutional     violations[,]             would       be    an    abuse       of     judicial\n\ndiscretion.\"\n\n      He concluded:\n\n                  Property owners' dissatisfaction with\n             the current funding formula or their belief\n             that it is unfair is not a basis for the\n             court to intrude into what is a Legislative\n             prerogative.      Central   Regional   School\n             District   was  created   under   terms   and\n             conditions outlined by our Legislature.\n             Moreover, the funding formula was determined\n             by the Legislature.    Controlling costs for\n             education is one of several significant\n             issues facing our State.    Our Governor and\n             Legislature are facing complex economic\n             challenges.     It   is   the   Legislature's\n             obligation to provide for a thorough and\n\n\n\n                                             35                                         A-0743-10T4\n\f          efficient education as mandated in Article\n          VIII, Section 4, Paragraph 1 of the New\n          Jersey Constitution.    Therefore, it is for\n          the Legislature to determine if the current\n          educational funding used in Central Regional\n          School   District   should   be   revised or\n          repealed, not the court.\n\n     Plaintiffs   appealed.

It\n\nfurther contends the evidence before the court demonstrated good\n\nand   just    cause      to    address        the       inequities      of    the    current\n\nsituation by ordering dissolution of the District.\n\n      Island Heights' arguments echo the abovementioned second,\n\nthird, and fourth arguments.                It additionally contends the court\n\nshould have accepted the allegations of the complaint as true\n\nfor purposes of the dismissal motion including, for example,\n\nthat the referenda were contracts, that taxpayer plaintiffs were\n\n\n\n\n                                              39                                    A-0743-10T4\n\fthird-party beneficiaries of the contract formed by the 1954\n\nreferenda,      that     the      l975        and        l993    revisions       substantially\n\nimpaired any contractual relationship plaintiffs may have had\n\nwith the other members of the District, and that plaintiffs had\n\na   property     interest        as     to      the      1954    referenda.           It    further\n\ncontends that material factual questions existed as to whether\n\nthe    l993     revision         allowed         for       a     realistic      means        for     a\n\nmunicipality to remove itself from the District and whether the\n\nfunding      changes    mandated           by      the    l975     revision      violated          the\n\nconstitutional         rights         of     the         residents       of     the    plaintiff\n\nmunicipalities.         At oral argument before us, the attorneys for\n\nIsland       Heights    and       its        BOE        reiterated       that     they       joined\n\nplaintiffs'         request      for         dissolution          of     Central       Regional;\n\nhowever, they did not support unilateral withdrawal by Seaside\n\nPark   or     revision      of    the        tax      apportion        formula,       and    Island\n\nHeights did not seek withdrawal from the District if it were not\n\ndissolved.\n\n                                                 IV.\n\n       The    Commissioner        argues         that      the    cross-appeals            filed    by\n\nIsland Heights and its BOE should be dismissed under Rule 2:8-2\n\nbecause      they    lack   standing            to      appeal    from    the    dismissal          of\n\nclaims they did not assert in the trial court.                                The Commissioner\n\nnotes that the Seaside Heights BOE filed cross-claims asserting\n\n\n\n\n                                                   40                                       A-0743-10T4\n\fthe   same    causes       of   action   as     plaintiffs   but    neither      Island\n\nHeights nor its BOE asserted affirmative claims other than a\n\ncounterclaim         for        indemnification       and     cross-claims           for\n\ncontribution and/or indemnification.\n\n      Only parties aggrieved by a judgment may appeal, meaning\n\nthose with \"a personal or pecuniary interest or property right\n\nadversely affected by the judgment in question.\"                         Howard Sav.\n\nInst. v. Peep, 34 N.J. 494, 499 (1961).                   Island Heights and its\n\nBOE   did    not    file    any   affirmative      claims    for    relief.       Thus,\n\nalthough they supported plaintiffs' prayer for dissolution of\n\nthe District, they were not aggrieved by the final judgment.\n\nSee Donofrio v. Farr Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 54 N.J. Super. 500,\n\n504-07      (App.       Div.    1959).        Nevertheless,        considering       the\n\ncompelling public policy and public interest at stake, Tiger v.\n\nAm. Legion Post, 125 N.J. Super. 361, 371 (App. Div. 1973), and\n\nthe fact that we will be addressing Island Heights' and its\n\nBOE's arguments in the context of plaintiffs' appeal, we discern\n\nno basis to dismiss their cross-appeals at this juncture.\n\n      We    first    address      and    reject    plaintiffs'     and   the    Island\n\nHeights BOE's arguments that the court did not apply the proper\n\nstandard     for    a    motion    to    dismiss    and   should    have   permitted\n\nplaintiffs to develop their claims through discovery, and that\n\n\n\n\n                                           41                                  A-0743-10T4\n\fthere were genuine issues of material fact precluding summary\n\njudgment in defendants' favor.\n\n    \"Appellate review of an order dismissing an action [under\n\nRule 4:6-2(e), for failure to state a claim upon which relief\n\nmay be granted] is governed by a standard no different than that\n\napplied by the trial courts.\"              Seidenberg v.

Twp.\n\nComm. of Manalapan, 140 N.J. 366, 378 (1995), which we review de\n\nnovo.\n\n    Based on our review of the record, we are satisfied Judge\n\nBuczynski     applied   the   appropriate      legal   standards     in   the\n\nchallenged    orders.     Plaintiffs    were    afforded   all     favorable\n\ninferences as to their allegations of fact pertaining to the\n\nresolutions, referenda, studies, and financial inequalities of\n\nthe funding formula.     Their challenges on appeal with respect to\n\n\n\n\n                                   43                               A-0743-10T4\n\fthis issue, however, involve legal conclusions, such as whether\n\nthe municipal entities had standing; whether those facts created\n\na contract, property right, or established other prima facie\n\nconstitutional      claims;    or   whether       those    facts     justified   the\n\nextraordinary       relief    of    an    exception       to   the    doctrine    of\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies or a unique North Haledon\n\nremedy.     For the reasons set forth in the judge's comprehensive\n\noral decisions and written opinion, we are satisfied he provided\n\nample legal basis for dismissing some of the counts under Rule\n\n4:6-2(e),    and    the   balance    of     the   complaint     subsequently      on\n\ncross-motions for summary judgment.\n\n               A.    Count One -         Exhaustion of Remedies\n\n    In their first count, plaintiffs sought an order compelling\n\nthe Commissioner to use her \"inherent power\" as set forth in\n\nNorth Haledon to provide them with equitable relief in the form\n\nof dissolution of Central Regional, authorization for Seaside\n\nPark's withdrawal from Central Regional, or modification of the\n\ncost apportionment used by Central Regional.                   In February 2008,\n\nJudge Buczynski dismissed this count on the ground that the\n\nreferendum had been unsuccessful on dissolution and plaintiffs\n\nhad failed to exhaust their administrative remedies regarding\n\nwithdrawal from the District or alteration of the District's\n\nfunding formula.       He directed plaintiffs to pursue alteration of\n\n\n\n\n                                          44                               A-0743-10T4\n\fthe funding formula through the statutory mechanism, i.e., an\n\nupdated     request      to   Central      Regional,         and    remanded    to    the\n\nCommissioner       for    consideration           of     plaintiffs'      alternative\n\nrequest for a referendum on withdrawal.\n\n      Then,   at    plaintiffs'         request,        Central     Regional    held     a\n\nreferendum    for     alteration      of    the    District's       funding    formula,\n\nwhich failed.       Seaside Park requested similar relief in letters\n\nto the Commissioner, who responded that she had no authority to\n\ndo    so.     In      response     to      the     trial     court's    remand,       the\n\nCommissioner advised that she had only considered plaintiffs'\n\nalternative request for dissolution, which she had authorized by\n\nreferendum.\n\n      Plaintiffs first assert error by the court in finding they\n\nhad not exhausted their administrative remedies as to withdrawal\n\nand modification of the cost apportionment formula.                           They urge\n\nthat they diligently sought relief from Central Regional and the\n\nCommissioner to no avail.             Plaintiffs point to the fact that all\n\nof    the   feasibility       studies       addressed        both    Seaside     Park's\n\nwithdrawal from and dissolution of Central Regional and they\n\nsought alternate relief from the Commissioner.                          Nevertheless,\n\nthe   Commissioner       chose   to     only      act   on   their    request     for    a\n\nreferendum on dissolution, which was defeated by the voters in\n\nMarch 2007.     Plaintiffs also contend they made repeated requests\n\n\n\n\n                                           45                                   A-0743-10T4\n\fafter 1998 to have the funding method changed, which Central\n\nRegional ignored, a fact the court failed to consider in its\n\nexhaustion analysis.\n\n       Plaintiffs further argue that mandating the exhaustion of\n\nremedies   would       be    futile.        They    note    that    the     referenda   on\n\ndissolution and altering the cost apportionment formula failed,\n\nand posit that even if the Commissioner approved a referendum on\n\nwithdrawal,      it    likely    would      not     succeed    given      that   Berkeley\n\nTownship   has        more   total     voters       than    the     other    constituent\n\nmunicipalities combined.\n\n       Requiring       exhaustion      of     administrative         remedies      before\n\nseeking judicial relief is a tenet of administrative law and\n\nestablished by court rule.               See Abbott v. Burke, 100 N.J. 269,\n\n296     (1985)        (\"In      general,           available        and      appropriate\n\n'administrative         remedies       should       be     fully     explored     before\n\njudicial action is sanctioned.'\") (quoting Garrow v.

The exhaustion requirement serves three primary goals:\n\n(1) it ensures that claims are initially heard by the body with\n\nexpertise in the area; (2) it produces a full factual record\n\nfacilitating meaningful appellate review; and (3) it conserves\n\njudicial resources because the agency decision may satisfy the\n\nparties.

We also have recognized the Department\n\nof Education's \"fundamental and indispensable jurisdiction\" over\n\ncontroversies and disputes arising under the school laws, and\n\nhave held that the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies requires\n\nparties       to   attempt     resolution     of    such    matters     using     the\n\nadministrative process.            Theodore v. Dover Bd. of Educ., 183\n\nN.J. Super. 407, 412-14 (App. Div. 1982).\n\n       Nevertheless,       exhaustion    of   remedies      is   not   an   absolute\n\nprerequisite to litigation.             N.J. Civ. Serv. Ass'n v. State, 88\n\nN.J. 605, 613 (1982).\n\n              Exceptions are made when the administrative\n              remedies would be futile, when irreparable\n              harm would result, when jurisdiction of the\n              agency is doubtful, or when an overriding\n              public interest calls for a prompt judicial\n              decision. We have frequently held that in a\n              case involving only legal questions, the\n              doctrine of exhaustion of administrative\n              remedies does not apply.\n\n              [Ibid.

N.J.S.A.     18A:13-56.\n\nPlaintiff's April 27, 2006 petition requested that the Board,\n\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:13-56, authorize a referendum on the\n\nissue of dissolution of Central Regional and expressly pled that\n\nif that request were \"not to be considered, the Board should\n\nauthorize an alternative referendum on the withdrawal of Seaside\n\nPark.\"    (Emphasis added).\n\n    Plaintiffs received the relief they requested; the Board\n\nfollowed the statutory process and granted plaintiffs permission\n\nto hold a referendum on the issue of dissolution of Central\n\nRegional as set forth in a detailed letter of September 1, 2006.\n\nRather    than       pursuing     their        alternate         relief       of   withdrawal\n\nthrough        the   administrative            channels          as     mandated     by     the\n\nLegislature, plaintiffs filed suit.                       In an abundance of caution,\n\nJudge    Buczynski        remanded      that    issue       to    the       Commissioner    for\n\nclarification, and we are satisfied an appropriate explanation\n\n\n\n\n                                               48                                    A-0743-10T4\n\fwas provided for the Board's decision solely on the issue of\n\ndissolution.\n\n       We     are   also    not   persuaded       by   plaintiffs'     argument   of\n\nfutility based on the premise that that even if Seaside Park\n\nsecured a referendum on withdrawal, the resulting tax increase\n\nand the veto power held by Berkeley Township virtually ensure\n\nthat    passage      of    such   a    referendum      would   never    occur.      A\n\nspeculation is insufficient.             See Harrow v. Prudential Ins. Co.,\n\n279 F.3d 244, 249 (3d Cir. 2002) (requiring a plaintiff to make\n\na \"'clear and positive showing of futility'\" to warrant waiver\n\nof     the     exhaustion     requirement)        (citation     omitted)).         We\n\nrecognize that Seaside Park has an uphill battle but as noted by\n\nJudge Buczynski, the remedy is not illusory, as evidenced by\n\nLacey        Township's     withdrawal       in   1977.        Circumstances      and\n\nattitudes of voters change over time.                     For example, we cannot\n\nspeculate as to            the potential impact of Superstorm Sandy in\n\nOctober 2012 on the pupil enrollment and tax base of Seaside\n\nPark and the other constituent municipalities in the District.\n\nThe Legislature was well aware of this fluidity when it enacted\n\nand     revised     the     statutes    in     Title    18A    that    created    and\n\nimplemented the comprehensive scheme regarding regional school\n\ndistricts.\n\n\n\n\n                                          49                               A-0743-10T4\n\f      Contrary    to     plaintiffs'            assertion,          the    record         amply\n\nsupports the court's factual finding that Seaside Park slept on\n\nits   rights   after     it    passed         the    1998    Resolution         petitioning\n\nCentral     Regional      to        alter          the     formula        for     municipal\n\ncontributions.         Discovery        did    not       \"produce    evidence      that       at\n\nleast one request was made each year for the 3 or 4 years\n\nleading up to the filing of the Complaint.\"                               Plaintiff David\n\nMeyer's testimony was vague, couched in terms of \"I believe,\"\n\nwas     non-specific     as    to       dates,       and    was     largely       based       on\n\ninformation    provided       to    him       from       unidentified      persons.           No\n\ndocument was provided other than the 1998 and 2003 Resolutions\n\nand, as previously noted, no testimony or evidence was presented\n\nthat the 2003 Resolution was, in fact, sent to Central Regional.\n\nJudge    Buczynski     correctly        concluded         that    plaintiffs       were      not\n\nentitled to judicial intervention on this issue.                                 He advised\n\nSeaside Park to pursue its statutory remedy of adopting and\n\nforwarding a new resolution to Central Regional requesting a\n\nreferendum     authorizing          this       relief,       which    it        did.         The\n\nreferendum failed but the process was followed and the voters\n\nspoke,    as   anticipated         by    the       Legislature       in    devising        this\n\ncomprehensive scheme.\n\n\n\n\n                                              50                                       A-0743-10T4\n\f                 B.     Count One -       Commissioner's Authority\n\n      Plaintiffs next contend the court erred in dismissing count\n\none because, as they alternatively requested in their April 2006\n\nResolution,       the    Commissioner        has   inherent     authority        to    alter\n\nCentral     Regional's         funding      formula    under     North       Haledon        to\n\nprovide equitable relief to Seaside Park.                      They emphasize that\n\nin both cases when the voters initially approved the formation\n\nof the regional school district, costs were to be apportioned on\n\na   per   pupil       basis,   which      funding     method    was       changed     to   an\n\nequalized       valuation      by   the     1975   revision.        See     N.   Haledon,\n\nsupra,    181     N.J.    at   165.       This     resulted    in     a    significantly\n\ndisproportionate increase in the operating costs of both North\n\nHaledon    and    Seaside      Park    as    compared    with    their       constituent\n\ndistricts, even though their students only accounted for a small\n\nportion of the overall student body.                  See id. at 166.\n\n      Seaside Park urges that its plight is \"far worse than that\n\nwhich     the     Supreme       Court       identified     as       inequitable            and\n\ndisproportionate in North Haledon\" and that it meets the two\n\nrequisites to equitable relief as articulated by the Attorney\n\nGeneral, i.e., that it is compelled to remain in the district\n\nand it is burdened with a disproportionate tax liability.                                  It\n\nargues that \"[w]hile North Haledon was compelled to remain in\n\nthe district due to the Court's belief that the Constitution\n\n\n\n\n                                             51                                     A-0743-10T4\n\frequired it, Seaside Park is likewise compelled to remain in its\n\ndistrict,\"   against     the   wishes    of       ninety-five   percent   of    its\n\nvoters,    \"because    the     Legislature         believed     that   the     1975\n\nRevision, which imposed the current cost allocation method [and\n\ngave Berkeley Township and Ocean Gate a '$3 million incentive to\n\nkeep    Seaside   Park    a    member        of     Central'    Regional],      was\n\nconstitutionally required.\"         Seaside Park also points to the\n\ngrowing inequitable burden placed on its taxpayers reflected in\n\nits charts, noting, for example, that in the 2009-2010 school\n\nyear alone, its taxpayers paid about twelve times the per pupil\n\namount than paid by the taxpayers of Ocean Gate and seven times\n\nmore than that paid by the taxpayers of Berkeley Township.14\n\n       Even if we were to accept plaintiffs' argument that they\n\nexhausted their administrative remedies and are subject to a\n\nsubstantially inequitable allocation, they would not be entitled\n\n\n14\n   During the rebuttal portion of oral argument before us,\ncounsel for Seaside Park mentioned as persuasive authority a\npending matter in which the Borough of Oradell had made an\napplication to the Commissioner for equitable relief, which the\nCommissioner apparently referred to an administrative law judge.\nFollowing argument, counsel submitted a January 24, 2012 letter\nfrom the Commissioner regarding that matter.         The Deputy\nAttorney General on behalf of the Commissioner objected to the\nsubmission as it was not part of the trial record, plaintiffs\ndid not move to supplement the record, and the parties were\ndeprived of an opportunity to respond during the litigation.\nSee R. 2:5-4, 2:5-5.         The Commissioner's objection was\nappropriate,   and   we   thus   disregard  this   post-argument\nsubmission.\n\n\n\n                                        52                                A-0743-10T4\n\fto    the    extraordinary            equitable      relief      afforded       in    the     North\n\nHaledon case.\n\n       Following          passage      of    the    1993     amendment,        North     Haledon\n\nunsuccessfully            pursued       a   referendum          seeking    to        return    the\n\ndistrict        to    a   per-pupil         cost    apportionment.             Ibid.          Here,\n\nhowever, as previously discussed, Seaside Park had not actively\n\npursued a referendum seeking to return Central Regional to a\n\nper-pupil        cost      apportionment           at     the    time     of     the     court's\n\ndismissal of the first count.                      More critically, however, North\n\nHaledon's application for withdrawal was granted by the Board,\n\nand    the      referendum        was       successful.           Id.     at    172,     176-84.\n\nHowever,        the   Court       having     found      it   was    one    of     \"those       rare\n\ncircumstances\"              requiring              judicial         intervention              with\n\nadministrative action, id. at 176, compelled North Haledon to\n\nremain      a   member      of    a    regional      school      district       in     order    to\n\nmaintain a racially diverse student body.                          Id. at 172, 176-84.\n\n       In this unique situation, the Court remanded the case to\n\nthe    Commissioner          to     implement        an    equitable       cost       allocation\n\nformula         for       North       Haledon's         regional        school         district,\n\nexplaining:\n\n                There is no suggestion in the record that\n                North Haledon was racially motivated in\n                petitioning for withdrawal; rather, North\n                Haledon was justifiably concerned about the\n                disproportional tax burden . . . carried by\n                its citizens in relation to the other\n\n\n\n                                                53                                      A-0743-10T4\n\fconstituent   municipalities.    We   are   not\nunaware   of   the   frustration    and   anger\nexpressed by the senior citizens of North\nHaledon   who    have   fixed    incomes    and\nescalating property taxes. On the one hand,\nNorth Haledon lost a referendum on the\nquestion whether to alter the apportionment\nscheme because the statute, N.J.S.A. 18A:13-\n23, grants an effective veto power to\nHaledon and Prospect Park who benefit from\nthe equalized valuation method North Haledon\nseeks to change.    On the other hand, North\nHaledon   cannot   petition   for    withdrawal\nbecause of the impact of withdrawal on the\nracial balance of the students attending\nManchester Regional.\n\n     We    confronted     a    similar    issue\nsubsequent to our decision in Jenkins[ v.\nTownship of Morris School District, 58 N.J.\n483, 492-93, 504 (1971), where we held the\nCommissioner possessed the power and duty to\nact to prevent withdrawal of Morris Township\nstudents from Morristown High School and to\ncompel a merger of the two districts to\nprevent de facto segregation]. After Jenkins\nissued,   the   Commissioner    compelled   the\nmerger of the Morristown and Morris Township\nschool systems.      Twp. Comm. of Twp. of\nMorris v. Bd. of Educ. of the Twp. of\nMorris, 60 N.J. 186, 188 (1972). The boards\nof education from both towns recommended\nthat the \"allocation of costs between the\ncomponent municipalities of the regional\ndistrict be on the basis of apportionment\nvaluations rather than pupil enrollment.\"\nId. at 188-89. The Commissioner agreed, and\nordered   the   new   regional    district   to\napportion costs in the manner suggested by\nthe school boards.        Id. at 189.       The\nTownship Committee of Morris Township filed\nsuit, asserting the Commissioner lacked the\npower to impose an apportionment scheme on\nthe new district. Id. at 189-90.            The\nTownship   Committee    argued    that,   under\nN.J.S.A. 18A:13-34, the power to set the\n\n\n\n                      54                          A-0743-10T4\n\f         apportionment scheme had been conferred on\n         the voters of a regional district.  Id. at\n         190.\n\n              We rejected the Township's argument\n         because \"[t]he Commissioner's determination\n         as to allocation of the costs was reasonable\n         and was well within the ambit of his\n         powers.\" Id. at 191. We reasoned that the\n         controlling statutory provision, N.J.S.A.\n         18A:13-34    (which    calls   for   a   special\n         election on the apportionment of costs for a\n         regional district), was not applicable in\n         the context of a compulsory merger ordered\n         by the Commissioner, and that requiring\n         voter approval would \"disable effective\n         action toward fulfillment of the State's\n         educational and desegregation policies . . .\n         nullify[ing] the very holding in Jenkins.\"\n         Ibid.; cf. N.J.S.A. 18A:7F-6 (authorizing\n         Commissioner to compel school districts to\n         make additional expenditures even after\n         school budgets have been approved by voters\n         when \"necessary to ensure implementation of\n         [thorough and efficient] standards\").         In\n         this    case     also,     the    constitutional\n         imperative to address racial segregation\n         requires the Board to compel North Haledon\n         to remain in the Regional District despite\n         the tax burden on its citizens.            As in\n         Jenkins, when a constituent municipality is\n         compelled to participate in a Regional\n         District,     N.J.S.A.    18A:13-23     is   not\n         applicable     and   the     Commissioner    may\n         determine cost allocations among and between\n         Haledon, Prospect Park, and North Haledon.\n\n         [N. Haledon, supra,      181   N.J.   at   184-86\n         (emphasis added).]\n\n    Here, however, neither the Commissioner nor the court has\n\nmandated that Seaside Park remain a member of Central Regional\n\nin contravention of the desire of the voters in the District\n\n\n\n\n                               55                            A-0743-10T4\n\fpursuant to the statutory scheme.               Rather, the voters rejected\n\nthe   referendum   on   dissolution,      see    N.J.S.A.    18A:13-59,    never\n\nvoted on the issue of Seaside Park's withdrawal, see ibid., and\n\nrejected a modification of the funding formula after the court's\n\nFebruary 2008 decision, see N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23.3.                   Seaside Park\n\nmay   pursue   a   referendum   on   withdrawal      or     other    appropriate\n\nadministrative action to obtain relief.              However, because this\n\ncase does not implicate the impact of withdrawal or dissolution\n\non racial diversity or issues of other constitutional dimension\n\nafter a successful referendum, we discern no basis to invoke the\n\nextraordinary remedy of judicial intervention and mandate that\n\nthe Commissioner implement an equitable cost allocation.\n\n      Plaintiffs' recourse is to lobby the Legislature to change\n\nthe statutory mechanisms for dissolving or withdrawing from a\n\nregional school district, or for revising its funding formula.\n\nAs is evident from the extensive legislative history set forth\n\nin this opinion, it is clear the Legislature has considered this\n\nissue at length over the years and has chosen not to embrace\n\nplaintiffs' position.      We discern no basis here to second-guess\n\nthat policy choice, and thus affirm summary judgment dismissal\n\nof plaintiffs' first count.\n\n\n\n\n                                     56                                 A-0743-10T4\n\f             C.   Count Four - Court's Equitable Powers\n\n      Count four alleged that the statutory remedies available\n\nfor plaintiffs to dissolve, withdraw from, or change the funding\n\nformula for Central Regional are illusory because Seaside Park\n\nis unable to achieve any of these results.            The court dismissed\n\nthis count with prejudice as failing to state a claim, reasoning\n\nthat \"[t]he mere fact that any of the [constituent] districts\n\nmay vote against the change [in the apportionment method] does\n\nnot as a matter of law make the remedy illusory\" and that Lacey\n\nTownship's   successful   withdrawal     from   the    District   in   1977\n\ncontradicted plaintiffs' argument as to impossibility.\n\n      Judge Buczynski astutely elaborated on this point in his\n\nruling on plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, emphasizing\n\nthe   Legislature's   prerogative   in   enacting     this   comprehensive\n\nstatutory scheme:\n\n           This court understands the difficulty that\n           Plaintiffs face in withdrawing from the\n           district or in changing the apportionment\n           method.      The    Legislature    passed   these\n           statutes   as    part   of   their    legislative\n           responsibilities as a separate and distinct\n           branch of government as empowered by the\n           Constitution of this state.\n\n                But the mere fact that one district\n           enjoys a majority of registered voters does\n           not, as a matter of law, render this\n           statutory scheme as illusory.   Difficult to\n           navigate, yes, but an illusion, no. This is\n           not a cognizable Cause of Action in this\n\n\n\n\n                                    57                            A-0743-10T4\n\f             state.    Voter distribution will vary and\n             will always vary from district to district.\n\n                  The circumstances, as argued by the\n             Plaintiffs,   miss   the    point.      Voter\n             incentives will vary. And I understand that\n             will change from election to election.

Rather, plaintiffs attack the constitutionality of\n\nthe   equalized        valuation      method      for    funding       regional       school\n\ndistricts    because      it       imposes    a   greater       financial       burden      on\n\nmunicipalities such as Seaside Park, which have high property\n\nvalues    and    few    students      attending         the    school     system.           The\n\ndistribution     of     education         costs   among       taxpayers    is    a    policy\n\ndecision to be made by the Legislature, which determined that a\n\nwealth-based      formula      for     funding      regional       districts         was     an\n\nappropriate option, and plaintiffs' arguments should be directed\n\nto that body.

See also Abbott II, supra, 119 N.J. at\n\n304 (court's function limited to constitutional review).\n\n      This    result    is    consistent        with    relevant       precedent.\n\nSpecifically, in Township of Princeton, supra, we rejected a\n\nconstitutional thorough-and-efficient challenge to the phase-in\n\nof   the   1975   amendment   to   the    method   of   allocating       costs   of\n\nregional     school    districts,        from   per     pupil     to     equalized\n\nvaluation, stating:\n\n             Since   the   total   amount   expended   for\n             education in the district is determined by\n             the regional school district board before\n             the apportionment among the municipalities,\n             the mere method of apportionment of the\n             costs, whether on a per pupil or ratables\n             basis, has no effect whatever on the quality\n             or opportunity of education of the children\n             within that district. It is for that reason\n             that the Robinson precepts do not come into\n             play.    Although the choice of method of\n             apportionment may create an unequal tax\n             burden among the municipalities of the\n             district, as the record reflects, it does\n             not influence the level of expenditures made\n             by the district for educational purposes.\n\n             [T]he method of allocation, whether it be on\n             the basis of ratables (N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23),\n             or the number of pupils enrolled, or on a\n             combination of both (N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23.1),\n             is a matter preeminently within the power of\n             the Legislature and has no bearing upon the\n             issue of constitutionality as delineated in\n             the Robinson cases.\n\n             [163 N.J.

For   example,     considering    a    challenge     to   the   1956\n\namendments,    wherein     the   Legislature    moved   from     \"ratables\"     to\n\n\"apportionment      valuations\"     for     purposes    of   funding     certain\n\nregional school districts, the Supreme Court spoke in language\n\nthat is equally applicable to plaintiffs' claims here:\n\n           In   essence,    we    are   presented    with   a\n           situation where Berkeley Heights claims a\n           vested right in unequal distribution of the\n           burden    [of   funding    a    regional    school\n           district], seeking a continuation of the\n           prior practice.      It complains that upon a\n           per capita student basis the property owners\n           of     that     township      are     paying     a\n           disproportionate     share    of   the   regional\n           burden, thereby subsidizing the education of\n           students      from      other      municipalities\n           comprising the regional school district.\n           The     factor      has    no      constitutional\n           implications.      Education is a matter of\n           public concern; the expenditures necessary\n           to fulfill the responsibility need not be\n           met on a basis of direct benefit to the\n           property charged.\n\n           [Berkeley Heights, supra, 23 N.J. at 282.]\n\nThe Court went on to state that, if Berkeley Heights wished to\n\nmove to apportionment of costs on a per pupil basis, it had to\n\nfollow the statutory procedures.

Plaintiffs do not contend that\n         there is any inequality in the school tax\n         burden of residents of Sea Bright compared\n         with residents of the other constituent\n         municipalities in the district.           To the\n         contrary, the objective of apportioning the\n         costs of a regional school district among\n         the constituent municipalities according to\n         their   property     values    is    to    impose\n         substantially equivalent tax burdens for\n         education upon all taxpayers of the district\n         regardless of the municipalities in which\n         they reside.    Thus, the method of financing\n         education in a regional school district is\n         substantially the same as in a single\n         municipality school district in that school\n         tax obligations depend upon the value of\n         each      taxpayer's        real        property.\n         Consequently,    we   have   no   hesitancy    in\n         rejecting plaintiffs' thesis that residents\n         of a municipality such as Sea Bright, which\n         has higher property values and/or fewer\n         children attending public school than other\n         municipalities    in    the   regional     school\n         district of which it is a part, have a\n         constitutional right to pay only the actual\n         costs of educating their resident children\n         who attend public school.

The judge further\n\nfound the 1975 and 1993 legislation promoted the \"public welfare\n\nand   education      of    the    students       residing    in    regional       school\n\ndistricts\" and thus was not an unconstitutional impairment of\n\nthe alleged contract.\n\n      We are convinced Judge Buczynski was correct on all points.\n\nHowever,    to    resolve       this   appeal,     we    need     only   address     the\n\ncontract issue and not the third-party beneficiary issue.\n\n      Both the federal and state constitutions protect against\n\ngovernment impairment of contractual obligations.

Therefore, there was no taking of\n\nany such contractual right.            Nor have plaintiffs established a\n\nproperty interest that has been excessively interfered with as a\n\nresult of this regulatory scheme.            See Gardner v. N.J.

All\n\nthe 1975 and 1993 legislation did was alter the allocation of\n\ntax   burdens    for     property      owners    located     in   regional     school\n\ndistricts.       Following       the   l975     legislation,      regional     school\n\ndistricts     were   funded      the   same     as   every   K-12   public     school\n\ndistrict statewide, i.e., based on property taxes rather than a\n\nper pupil cost.          The taxes for Central Regional were allocated\n\nas if the District were one community, with a uniform rate of\n\nschool taxes charged to the property owners in the constituent\n\nmunicipalities based on the equalized value of their respective\n\nproperty.     Under this allocation method, Seaside Park taxpayers\n\npay regional school taxes at exactly the same rate as property\n\nowners   in   the    other    four     constituent      municipalities       forming\n\nCentral Regional.         The l993 law provided circumstances by which\n\na district could modify the apportionment method and left the\n\ndecision of whether to modify to the voters of the constituent\n\nmunicipalities.            The    fact     that      equalized      valuation       is\n\ndisproportionate does not render the tax unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n                                          73                                 A-0743-10T4\n\f    \"[T]he power of taxation should not be confused with the\n\npower of eminent domain.\"        Houck v.

Plaintiffs' argument on this\n\nissue is without merit to warrant further discussion as we are\n\nsatisfied     Judge      Buczynski        amply      addressed       and      rejected       this\n\nissue with appropriate legal citations.                      R. 2:11-3(e)(1)(E).\n\n                       D. Counts Six and Seven - Equities\n\n       In Point VI, plaintiffs claim the court erred by failing to\n\naddress    (1)      their    equitable         claim      that   the     1975    legislation\n\nfrustrated       the    purpose      of    their       agreement       to     form     Central\n\nRegional      and    (2)     their    constitutional             claim     that       the    1975\n\nlegislation deprived Seaside Park's parents of their substantive\n\ndue process right to direct the upbringing and education of\n\ntheir     children.           In     Point          VII,    plaintiffs          claim        they\n\ndemonstrated good and just cause for the court to exercise its\n\ninherent      equitable      powers       to    address      the    inequities          of    the\n\ncurrent situation.\n\n       Judge Buczynski rejected taxpayer plaintiffs' frustration\n\nof purpose argument and their alternate theory of a substantive\n\ndue process violation because these claims were not pled by\n\n\n\n\n                                               76                                      A-0743-10T4\n\fplaintiffs and were not supported by the record.                                  The judge\n\nrejected plaintiffs' general request for equitable relief on the\n\nground that he had no authority to grant it - the Legislature\n\nhad provided statutory means for plaintiffs to pursue the relief\n\nthey   sought    and    judicial        override        of   those       procedures     would\n\nviolate   the    principle         of    separation          of    powers.        Moreover,\n\nnotwithstanding        the    cost       borne     by     Seaside        Park's    property\n\nowners, funding of regional school districts on the basis of\n\nequalized valuation was fundamentally fair.\n\n       We discern no error in the conclusions reached by Judge\n\nBuczynski.      Under Rule 4:5-2, litigants are required to include\n\nin their pleadings \"a statement of the facts on which the claim\n\nis based, showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and a\n\ndemand for judgment for the relief to which the pleader claims\n\nentitlement.\"      Even read indulgently, see Van Dam Egg Co. v.\n\nAllendale    Farms,     Inc.,      199    N.J.         Super.     452,    455   (App.    Div.\n\n1985), the second amended complaint is devoid of any claim of\n\nfrustration of purpose, or that the taxpayer plaintiffs have\n\nbeen    deprived       of    the     right        to     control     their        children's\n\neducation.      Therefore, the judge correctly declined to address\n\nthese arguments on summary judgment.                      See Jersey City v. Hague,\n\n18 N.J. 584, 602 (1955) (stating that \"however liberal pleadings\n\nmay be, the requirement still remains that at least the gist of\n\n\n\n\n                                             77                                     A-0743-10T4\n\fa     substantive           ground      of     relief        must   be   set     forth\").\n\nNevertheless,         even       if   addressed,       these    claims   would   fail    on\n\ntheir merits for the reasons discussed in earlier issues.\n\n       Taxpayer       plaintiffs'           alternative      substantive   due    process\n\ntheory       fails    because         the    1975    legislation    does   not   prevent\n\nparents from directing the upbringing of their children.                                See\n\nTroxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65-66, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 2059-\n\n60,    147     L.    Ed.    2d   49,    56-57       (2000)   (discussing   the   liberty\n\ninterest of parents \"in the care, custody, and control of their\n\nchildren\").          Under the 1975 legislation, the funding mechanism\n\nfor Central Regional was changed to equalized valuation                                 - a\n\nfunding mechanism plaintiffs do not like because it costs them\n\nmore than per pupil funding.                         The 1975 legislation does not\n\naffect their ability to raise their children as they see fit.\n\nThey     are    not        required     to     send    their    children    to    Central\n\nRegional.           They can send their children to other schools at\n\ntheir own expense, relocate to another school district, or even\n\nhome-school their children.                    Additionally, taxpayer plaintiffs\n\ncan lobby other voters in the constituent municipalities to pass\n\nreferenda.\n\n       As to taxpayer plaintiffs' request for equitable relief:\n\n               [E]quity    will   generally    conform    to\n               established rules and precedents, and will\n               not change or unsettle rights that are\n               created   and  defined  by   existing   legal\n\n\n\n                                                78                               A-0743-10T4\n\f            principles.    This is the basis for the\n            equitable maxim \"equity follows the law,\"\n            which instructs that as a rule a court of\n            equity will follow the legislative and\n            common-law regulations of rights, and also\n            obligations of contract.\n\n            [Dunkin' Donuts of Am., Inc. v. Middletown\n            Donut Corp., 100 N.J. 166, 183 (1985)\n            (internal citations omitted).]\n\n     Here, there is no \"wrong\" to remedy through law or equity.\n\nThe Legislature has declared the rights and responsibilities of\n\nthe constituent members of regional school districts.                 Under the\n\ncircumstances of this case, the court has no power to override\n\nthe Legislature's scheme for funding regional school districts,\n\nor   to     provide    plaintiffs     with      an     alternative     to    the\n\nlegislatively created means for withdrawing from or dissolving\n\nCentral Regional, or altering the funding mechanism of Central\n\nRegional.\n\n     This lawsuit is an attempt to achieve through the courts a\n\nresult that plaintiffs could not achieve pursuant to relevant\n\nlegislation or through the Department of Education.

The   goal    of   this\n\nlegislation was to \"encourage[] the formation of regional school\n\ndistricts          by       allowing          school          districts         considering\n\nregionalization greater freedom in determining how costs should\n\nbe apportioned among the constituent districts.\"                               Statement to\n\nAssembly Substitute for A. 1822 and 1063 (Feb. 8, 1993).                                   In\n\nthis regard, the Legislature acknowledged that the requirement\n\nof cost apportionment based on equalized valuation acted as \"a\n\ndisincentive to regionalization for certain districts which have\n\nhigh       property      values       and    a       small   pupil    population,       when\n\nconsidering joining with a municipality that has low property\n\nvalues      and    a    large   pupil       population.\"           See,    e.g.,   Assembly\n\nEducation Committee Statement to A. 1822 (Oct. 1, 1992); Senate\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7                                 A-0743-10T4\n\fEducation Committee Statement to Assembly Substitute for A. 1822\n\nand 1063 (Dec. 10, 1992).\n\n    Also        in    1993,   the    Legislature            revised       the    law   which\n\nprovided    a    procedure     for    withdrawal            from    a    regional      school\n\ndistrict by adding a parallel procedure for the dissolution of a\n\ndistrict.        L.   1993,   c.     255.       This    amendment         set    forth    the\n\nfollowing standard for determining if a referendum on withdrawal\n\nor dissolution was successful:\n\n            For withdrawal from a regional district, the\n            question shall be deemed adopted if it\n            receives an affirmative vote of a majority\n            of the votes cast within the withdrawing\n            constituent district and it receives an\n            affirmative vote of a majority of the\n            overall votes cast in the entire regional\n            district.    For dissolution of a regional\n            district, the question shall be deemed\n            adopted if it receives an affirmative vote\n            in a majority of the individual constituent\n            districts and it receives an affirmative\n            vote of a majority of the overall votes cast\n            in the entire regional district.\n\n            [L. 1993, c. 255, § 8; N.J.S.A. 18A:13-59.]\n\nThe Legislature also authorized the State Board of Education to\n\npromulgate regulations to effectuate the provisions of the Act.\n\nL. 1993, c. 255, § 14.\n\n    In 2004, the Supreme Court decided North Haledon.                                  There,\n\nNorth Haledon, Haledon, and Prospect Park had formed a limited\n\npurpose     regional      school      district         in     the       1950s,    providing\n\nsecondary education at Manchester Regional High School using a\n\n\n\n                                            8                                       A-0743-10T4\n\fper pupil method for apportioning costs; however, in l975 the\n\nfunding method was changed to an equalized valuation.                          Supra,\n\n181 N.J. at 165.           Consequently, because North Haledon had the\n\nhighest tax base of the three municipalities, its share of the\n\noperating costs significantly increased disproportionally to the\n\nother two districts.         Id. at 165-66.\n\n       After       the   1993      amendment,       North    Haledon       pursued     a\n\nreferendum that would return the district to per pupil cost\n\napportionment, which failed because it did not garner a majority\n\nof voters in Haledon and Prospect Park.                     Id. at 166.      By 1994,\n\nNorth Haledon was paying over half of the district's operating\n\ncosts and more than two to three times per pupil than that paid\n\nby Haledon and Prospect Park, respectively.                        Ibid.     In 2001,\n\nNorth Haledon was paying $18,400 per pupil, while Haledon was\n\npaying $5300, and Prospect Park was paying $3400.                    Id. at 169.\n\n       In 1998, North Haledon initiated the process of withdrawal.\n\nAlthough the county superintendent's investigative report did\n\nnot favor withdrawal, North Haledon petitioned the Commissioner\n\nfor permission to hold a referendum pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:13-\n\n54.          Id.   at    166-67.       The       Board   granted     the    petition,\n\nnotwithstanding that North Haledon's withdrawal would result in\n\na     nine    percent     reduction    in        white   students    in    Manchester\n\nRegional's student body.              Id. at 167-72.         The Board found the\n\n\n\n\n                                             9                                A-0743-10T4\n\fracial impact negligible because, based upon demographic changes\n\nin the three sending districts, whether North Haledon stayed or\n\nwithdrew,     the    minority       population    at    the    high     school    would\n\ncontinue to rise and the white population would continue to\n\ndecline.      Id. at 172.\n\n      The   Regional     Board,      Haledon,     and   Prospect       Park   appealed\n\nthe   Board's       order,    but    no   stay    was    entered       to   block     the\n\nreferendum     pending       appeal.      Ibid.        The    voters    approved       the\n\nreferendum at a special election, and the Commissioner set a\n\ndate for North Haledon's withdrawal from the district.

The Supreme Court affirmed, holding that\n\n              the constitutional imperative to prevent\n              segregation in our public schools applies as\n              well to the Board within the ambit of the\n              exercise   of  its   responsibilities  under\n              N.J.S.A. 18A:13-56(b)(4), which requires the\n              Board to deny a withdrawal petition for\n              \"[a]ny other reason, which it may deem to be\n              sufficient.\"\n\n              [N.

We conclude that the Board's\n         decision permitting a referendum on the\n         question of withdrawal is not sustainable as\n         a matter of law, and affirm the decision of\n         the   Appellate   Division  reversing   that\n         decision.\n\n         [Id. at 184.]\n\n    However, the Court acknowledged North Haledon's justifiable\n\nconcern about the disproportional tax burden shouldered by its\n\ncitizens as compared to the other constituent municipalities,\n\nid. at 184-85, so it modified the judgment and remanded to the\n\nCommissioner \"to develop, in consultation with the constituent\n\nmunicipalities, an equitable cost apportionment scheme for the\n\nRegional District.\"   Id. at 186.    In so ruling, the Court held:\n\n         the constitutional imperative to address\n         racial segregation requires the Board to\n         compel North Haledon to remain in the\n         Regional District despite the tax burden on\n         its citizens. . . .

You are\n          advised that such power may be exercised by\n          the Commissioner where the relative tax\n          burden of the constituent districts in a\n          regional district is inequitable and the\n          Board of Review (or a reviewing court)\n          denies   dissolution    or    withdrawal   of\n          constituent districts from the regional\n          school    district    because    dissolution/\n          withdrawal would result in deficiencies of a\n          constitutional dimension.\n\n               . . . .\n\n               In sum, the Commissioner is authorized\n          to    act   notwithstanding      the    statutory\n          provisions governing apportionment of costs\n          among constituent school districts of a\n          regional school district as set forth in\n          N.J.S.A.     18A:13-23,    in      a    situation\n          substantially similar to that present in\n          [North    Haledon].        Specifically,      the\n          Commissioner may determine cost allocations\n          among and between the constituent districts\n          where    there   is    the   presence     of   an\n          inequitable tax burden -- which could be\n          demonstrated    by   a   constituent     district\n          unsuccessfully     seeking    to     change   the\n          apportionment methodology -- and due to a\n          constitutional imperative such as addressing\n          racial segregation, the Board of Review (or\n          a court reviewing the Board's determination)\n          determines that the regional district must\n          remain intact.\n\n          [(Emphasis added).]\n\n    By letter of January 18, 2005, the Commissioner advised\n\nthat cost apportionment in North Haledon would be sixty-seven\n\npercent   equalized    valuation   and    thirty-three   percent   pupil\n\nenrollment,   phased   in   over   four   years.    In   so   doing,   he\n\ncautioned:\n\n\n\n                                   12                           A-0743-10T4\n\f           I stress that the apportionment methodology\n           [adopted] is a unique response to the\n           circumstances   existing  in    the  present\n           matter, and that it is neither binding on\n           the regional district in the event that the\n           voters of the district and its constituents\n           subsequently   elect   to  approve  a   cost\n           apportionment method of the regional board's\n           own devising pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23,\n           nor intended to be precedent-setting in any\n           other situation where cost apportionment is\n           at issue among the constituent members of a\n           regional district.\n\n    On numerous occasions both before and after North Haledon,\n\nthe Legislature has considered issues involving regional school\n\ndistricts,    including      its    funding      and     the    procedures         for\n\nwithdrawal    from     or   dissolution     of    such    districts,         but    no\n\nsignificant changes have been made.               Seaside Park has been an\n\nactive participant in those discussions.\n\n    For example, in 1994, the Senate introduced S. 1313, which\n\nwould have made it easier for a district to withdraw from a\n\nlimited    purpose     regional    school     district,        but    it    was    not\n\nenacted.     In   1996,     the    Legislature     established        a    panel    to\n\ninvestigate regionalization.          L. 1996, c. 138, § 31.                The New\n\nJersey Regionalization Advisory Panel issued its final report in\n\nJanuary 1998.        See N.J.

Id.    at   2,   6-7.        The   Panel       also    recommended\n\n\"legislation that would direct and empower the Commissioner of\n\nEducation,    supported     by   the     county    superintendents               and    in\n\ncooperation     with      the    local       boards       of    education              and\n\nadministrations, to identify school districts that might benefit\n\nfinancially   and     educationally      from    either    regionalization              or\n\nconsolidation of services with other school districts[,]\" and\n\nlegally mandated regionalization where appropriate.

The disproportionate distribution of\n           costs among constituent municipalities in\n           regionalized    districts   is   a    major\n           disincentive to regionalization.   However,\n           any formula change designed to bring parity\n           in the per pupil costs of the constituent\n           municipalities will result in \"winners\" and\n           \"losers.\"\n\n           5.   Smaller, more affluent communities in\n           regional school districts, which are locked\n           into   paying   based   on   their  equalized\n           valuation, as opposed to on a per-pupil\n           basis, may wind up paying more than what\n           they   otherwise   would   pay   in  a   non-\n           regionalized district.\n\n           6.   Development  trends    of   constituent\n           municipalities within a     regional school\n\n5\n    The mayor of Seaside Park served as a member of the task\nforce, which specifically considered the experience of Central\nRegional,    Assembly    Task   Force    on    School   District\nRegionalization, Transcript of Feb. 25, 1998, (pp. 84-94);\nCentral Regional's expert in this litigation, Melvyn Wyns,\ntestified at the March 26, 1998 hearing, Assembly Task Force on\nSchool District Regionalization, Transcript of March 26, 1998,\n(pp. 24-41, 64-67); and one of plaintiffs' experts in this\nlitigation, James Kirtland, testified at the August 13, 1998\nhearing, Assembly Task Force on School District Regionalization,\nTranscript of Aug. 13, 1998, (pp. 80-81, 98-120).\n\n\n\n                                 15                        A-0743-10T4\n\f             district can also negatively impact on the\n             cost inequity factor.\n\n                    . . . .\n\n             8.    Many districts exhibit concern over\n             regionalizing because the deregionalization\n             process proves rigid and difficult.   Major\n             issues relating to division of debt service\n             and assets, personnel retention policies,\n             and the ability of each resulting district\n             to adequately provide for the education of\n             their students, must be considered.\n\n             9.    Withdrawal   from    a   regionalized\n             arrangement by a constituent municipality\n             may prove overwhelming since the current\n             procedures require a majority of voters\n             across the regional district in addition to\n             a majority of voters in the constituent\n             municipality which wants to exit from the\n             arrangement.\n\n       The   task    force    recommended,             in   pertinent         part:     (1)\n\nrestructuring        of   regionalization                agreements        \"to        allow\n\nreassessment of cost distribution if the per pupil cost deviates\n\nby more than 10% between any two constituent municipalities of\n\nthe    regional     district\";       (2)    modification          of    the     equalized\n\nvaluation method for apportioning costs to a \"fairer formula\"\n\nthat     would       \"provide        more         equity        among         constituent\n\nmunicipalities,\"       with     \"a    realistic         mechanism       which     compels\n\nequitable     adjustments        in        the        distribution        costs       among\n\nconstituent      municipalities       for       the    small    number     of    existing\n\nregionalized      districts      which      currently          evidence    an     extreme\n\ndisproportionate distribution of costs\"; and (3) amendment of\n\n\n\n                                           16                                     A-0743-10T4\n\fthe    withdrawal    statutes,      allowing    a     municipality   to   opt   out\n\n\"without major obstacles when a specified threshold deviation in\n\nthe per pupil amount paid by each constituent municipality is\n\nreached, perhaps 10%\" and providing a mechanism \"to join another\n\nregional district or enter into a sending/receiving relationship\n\nwith another regional district.\"              Ibid.\n\n       In 2002, the Legislature considered S. 295, which would\n\nhave    reduced    per-pupil     cost    disparities      in   certain    regional\n\nschool districts and increased state aid to those districts to\n\noffset    the     reduction    in    municipal        contributions.      Central\n\nRegional supported the measure, but it did not pass.\n\n       In 2005, the Office of Legislative Services (OLS) issued a\n\nBackground Report, Regional School Districts:                   Apportionment of\n\nCosts in the Constituent Municipalities (July 20, 2005).6                       The\n\nOLS acknowledged the disincentives to regionalization, including\n\nthe    perception    of   inequity      felt    by    wealthier   municipalities\n\npaying based upon equalized property value.                    It also noted the\n\ndifficulty in altering the funding method for currently existing\n\nregional school districts:\n\n                 A referendum on a change in the\n            apportionment method must be approved \"by\n            the voters of each municipality.\"    Because\n            of this voting requirement, a change in the\n            method   of  cost  apportionment  is   quite\n\n6\n    http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/PropertyTaxSession/OPI/bg123.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                         17                               A-0743-10T4\n\f             difficult to accomplish. Such a change will\n             always create \"winners\" and \"losers\" among\n             the constituent municipalities, and those\n             municipalities slated to \"lose\" will not\n             vote in favor of a change that will result\n             in increases in their tax levy.              The\n             constituent   municipalities    which    benefit\n             from the current apportionment method are\n             granted   effective   veto   power    over   any\n             possible change.\n\n       In   2006,    the     Legislature      created      four    joint    legislative\n\ncommittees to make recommendations regarding proposals to reform\n\nproperty     taxes,    including       the    Joint     Legislative     Committee       on\n\nPublic School Funding Reform and the Joint Legislative Committee\n\non   Government      Consolidation       and      Shared   Services.

See   Special    Session     Joint\n\nLegislative Committee Public School Funding Reform Final Report\n\n(Dec. 1, 2006), http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/PropertyTaxSession/\n\nOPI/jcsf_final_report.pdf.         Pertinent to the present appeal, the\n\nCommittee recognized the value of regionalization as well as the\n\nfinancial    disincentives    to    the    creation    of   regional    school\n\ndistricts,       and   recommended     adopting       the    Department       of\n\nEducation's recommendations regarding the apportionment of costs\n\nin regional districts as follows:\n\n            Under the revisions, State aid and local\n            property    tax     contributions    would    be\n            calculated separately for each constituent\n            municipality in a regional district.       [And]\n            [n]o jurisdiction in a regional school\n            district would pay a tax levy per pupil\n            which    exceeds    the    actual   per    pupil\n            expenditures     of    the    regional   school\n            district.\n\n            While some may be concerned that this change\n            would artificially cap the burden of some\n            taxpayers who have a greater ability to pay\n            under the measures employed, it is believed\n            that the policy and educational benefits of\n            having regional school districts outweigh\n            this concern.\n\n    Also in 2006, S. 1585 was introduced, 212th Leg.,8 which\n\nwould have provided for the reduction of per pupil expenditures\n\n\n8\n  S. 1585 can be traced back to A. 2623, from the 209th Leg.\n(2000-2001 Legislative Session).    In 2001, A. 2623 was\n                                                  (continued)\n\n\n                                      19                               A-0743-10T4\n\ffor     certain     constituent     municipalities     of   regional    school\n\ndistricts.        It apparently was designed to eliminate the funding\n\ncomplained about by Seaside Park.            It would have reduced the tax\n\nburden    for     municipalities    that    are   constituents   of    regional\n\nschool districts but: (1) comprise less than 10% of the regional\n\nschool district enrollment; (2) have a tax levy to support the\n\nregional school district of more than $1 million; and (3) have a\n\nper pupil expenditure that is more than 200% of the average per\n\npupil    expenditure     of   all    constituent    municipalities      of   the\n\nregional district.        State aid would have been provided to the\n\nregional school district to compensate for the loss of revenue\n\nfrom the constituent municipality.                The bill, however, never\n\nproceeded beyond introduction, and it was not carried over or\n\nre-introduced in any more legislative sessions.\n\n      Additionally, A. 3261/S. 2289 and A. 3422 were introduced\n\nin 2008, 213th Leg., which were carried over or reintroduced as\n\nA. 1327/S. 1638 in 2010, 214th Leg.                 These bills would have\n\nrevised the voting requirements necessary for the dissolution of\n\n\n\n(continued)\nintroduced, referred to two assembly committees, and also\nreported out of committee with a second reading and fiscal\nestimates (with Seaside Park identified in the 2001 fiscal\nestimate as one of the municipalities that would experience tax\nsavings).   However, it did not pass, and was carried over in\nlegislative sessions through 2006, introduced as S. 1585, but\nnever went anywhere.\n\n\n\n                                       20                              A-0743-10T4\n\flimited purpose regional school districts.                     They would have made\n\ndissolution easier by eliminating the requirement that there be\n\na majority of the overall vote as cast; instead, dissolution\n\ncould    occur   with      an   affirmative     vote     in    a     majority    of    the\n\nindividual constituent districts.                However, the bills did not\n\nprogress past introduction in either legislative session.\n\n                                          II.\n\n    We turn now to the specifics of our case.                           In the early\n\n1950s,    Seaside     Heights,        Seaside   Park,    Island       Heights,     Ocean\n\nGate, Berkeley Township, and Lacey Township sent students to\n\nToms River schools on a tuition basis.                   In 1953, however, Toms\n\nRiver    advised      that       it     could    no     longer        continue        that\n\nrelationship.         By    public     referendum       held    in    1954,     the    six\n\nmunicipalities      formed      Central    Regional      as     a    limited    purpose\n\nschool district to educate their junior and senior high school\n\nstudents (grades seven to twelve).9                   Central Regional's school\n\nbuildings are located in Berkeley Township, which is the largest\n\nmunicipality     in     terms     of     geography,      population,       registered\n\nvoters, and student enrollment.\n\n\n\n\n9\n  The boards of education of the constituent municipalities\npassed resolutions to hold July 1 and September 1, 1954\nreferenda to allow voters to decide whether to create the\nDistrict. The first referendum did not pass; the second passed.\n\n\n\n                                          21                                    A-0743-10T4\n\f      In    the    1954    referendum        by    which    Central     Regional      was\n\nformed, the voters agreed to apportion costs based on per pupil\n\nenrollment.          However,     the   1975       legislation        altered   Central\n\nRegional's funding mechanism to an equalized property valuation\n\nbasis.      L. 1975, c. 212.          Although the 1993 legislation allowed\n\nfor   changes      to   the   funding    structure         of   regionalized     school\n\ndistricts, no such change has ever been effectuated at Central\n\nRegional.\n\n      In 1976, Seaside Heights, Seaside Park, and Lacey Township\n\npetitioned        the   Department      of        Education     for    permission      to\n\nwithdraw from Central Regional.                    On May 20, 1977, the Board\n\npermitted Lacey Township to conduct a referendum, but rejected\n\nthe petitions of Seaside Heights and Seaside Park on the ground\n\nthat the proposed alternative to Central Regional, a sending-\n\nreceiving relationship with the Point Pleasant School District,\n\nwas   not    viable.          Lacey   Township's         withdrawal      from   Central\n\nRegional was approved by voter referendum held in 1977.10\n\n      In     1981,      Island    Heights         and    Seaside      Heights    passed\n\nresolutions         requesting        that         the     county      superintendent\n\ninvestigate the advisability of their withdrawal from Central\n\nRegional.       Island Heights later withdrew its petition after a\n\n\n10\n  The withdrawal became effective on July 1, 1978, but for ease\nof reference in this opinion we will use the 1977 date.\n\n\n\n                                          22                                    A-0743-10T4\n\fjoint meeting of the constituent communities, and the county\n\nsuperintendent issued his report regarding Seaside Heights.                                     In\n\nl983,    Seaside       Heights       then       petitioned         the    Commissioner         for\n\npermission        to     conduct       a    referendum            regarding        withdrawal.\n\nSeaside Park objected, and the Board denied the petition.\n\n       In   1985,      the    Berkeley      Township         Board       of   Education       (the\n\nrespective Boards of Education will hereafter be referred to as\n\nBOE) commissioned a feasibility study regarding its potential\n\nwithdrawal      from      Central       Regional.                The   author      recommended\n\nwithdrawal, but there is no record of any further action.\n\n       In November 1995, the Seaside Park BOE approved withdrawal\n\nfrom Central Regional and pursued a send-receive relationship\n\nwith    Point     Pleasant         under    a    pilot       program.          However,       this\n\nattempt to withdraw was unsuccessful.\n\n       In   October          1998,     Seaside            Park     passed      a     resolution\n\nrequesting that Central Regional consider the resolution \"as a\n\npetition     seeking         an    alteration        in    the    formula      for    municipal\n\ncontributions to the District, so as to return to a per pupil\n\ncost formula[.]\"             The resolution otherwise reflected an intent\n\nby    Seaside     Park       \"to    seek    all      appropriate         legal     redress      to\n\nwithdraw\" from Central Regional.                          The resolution also directs\n\nthe     Borough     Clerk-Administrator               to     promptly         forward    it     to\n\nCentral Regional.                 The record reflects that Central Regional\n\n\n\n\n                                                23                                      A-0743-10T4\n\freceived the resolution and discussed it, but does not reflect\n\nany decision by Central Regional or further action by Seaside\n\nPark regarding the resolution.\n\n      In 2003, Seaside Park adopted a resolution requesting that\n\nCentral Regional place a referendum on the ballot for voters in\n\nthe   constituent      municipalities              authorizing      a   change       in   the\n\nfunding formula for Central Regional to sixty percent equalized\n\nvaluation and forty percent per pupil.                     In contrast to the prior\n\nresolution, this resolution contained no provision directing its\n\nsubmission to Central Regional and the record does not reflect\n\nanything    further     with     respect       to     this    resolution,       including\n\nwhether it was sent to Central Regional.\n\n      In    April     2005,     at     Seaside       Park's    request,        Donald      E.\n\nBeineman,    Ed.D.,     and     James     L.       Kirtland,     C.P.A.,    prepared        a\n\npreliminary    feasibility           study,    opining       that   Seaside      Park     was\n\nsubsidizing     the     other        constituent         municipalities        and     could\n\nrealize    significant        cost    savings       by    withdrawing     from       Central\n\nRegional and entering into a sending-receiving relationship with\n\nnearby Toms River or Point Pleasant, or by Central Regional\n\nbeing   dissolved      and    Berkeley        Township       creating    its     own      K-12\n\ndistrict.     Accordingly, in June 2005, Seaside Park and its BOE\n\npassed resolutions formally instituting the instant process by\n\nrequesting    that     the     Ocean     County          Superintendent    of        Schools\n\n\n\n\n                                              24                                  A-0743-10T4\n\fconduct an investigation into the advisability of Seaside Park's\n\nwithdrawal        from,      or     the     dissolution        of,      Central     Regional\n\npursuant   to      N.J.S.A.        18A:13-51.           Seaside      Heights      and    Island\n\nHeights    and       their        Boards     of    Education         passed       resolutions\n\nrequesting      an    investigation           as    to    only       the    dissolution        of\n\nCentral Regional.\n\n      Central        Regional           retained        its      own       school       finance\n\nconsultant, Melvin L. Wyns, who authored a report in November\n\n2005.      He      recommended          opposition        to     both      dissolution        and\n\nwithdrawal based on the adverse tax impact it would have on the\n\nconstituent municipalities.\n\n      In March 2006, the county superintendent issued a report\n\nadvising against dissolution.                 He found the following advantages\n\nto dissolution: reduced administrative costs by consolidation,\n\nanticipated       increases         in     state        aid    for     select     districts,\n\nreallocation of the tax levy, and the ability of each school\n\ndistrict     to      assess       and     evaluate       their       present      educational\n\nconcerns     during        the       process.            He      found      the     following\n\ndisadvantages:            possible         lack    of    continuity         of    educational\n\nprograms, need to establish new relationships between sending\n\nand receiving districts, effects on staff at Central Regional\n\nand   Berkeley       Township       elementary       school      regarding        tenure      and\n\nseniority, negative tax levy impact on Berkeley Township and\n\n\n\n\n                                              25                                        A-0743-10T4\n\fOcean   Gate,     potential     increased        cost    per     student     ratios    in\n\nBerkeley Township, and lost ability to share unique costs among\n\nall   constituent      districts.      The       superintendent        concluded      the\n\ndisadvantages of dissolution outweighed the advantages.                              Most\n\nnotable was the negative impact on the taxpayers of Berkeley\n\nTownship and Ocean Gate, \"who represent over 80% of the resident\n\npopulation.\"\n\n       In April 2006, Seaside Park and its BOE filed a petition\n\nwith the State Department of Education seeking permission to\n\nconduct a referendum on withdrawing from or dissolving Central\n\nRegional pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:13-54.                   They requested, in the\n\nevent the Commissioner denied a referendum or the referendum was\n\ndefeated,       that   she    \"use   her        inherent       power   to   create    an\n\nequitable tax apportionment formula, based in whole or in part\n\non a per-pupil formulation, to fund the Central Regional School\n\nDistrict.\"      Central Regional opposed the petition.\n\n       The Board held hearings in July and August 2006.                       It voted\n\nto grant Seaside Park's petition for a referendum on dissolution\n\nof    Central    Regional,      memorialized        in     a    written     opinion   of\n\nSeptember 1, 2006.           See N.J.S.A. 18A:13-56.             The referendum was\n\nheld on March 13, 2007, and was defeated by the voters because\n\nalthough the majority of the constituent municipalities favored\n\ndissolution, a majority of the overall voters in the District\n\n\n\n\n                                           26                                  A-0743-10T4\n\fdid not.       See N.J.S.A. 18A:13-59.               The referendum passed in\n\nSeaside    Park,    Seaside      Heights,      and   Island   Heights,       but   was\n\ndefeated in Berkeley Township and Ocean Gate.11\n\n                                      III.\n\n      In May 2007, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Chancery\n\nDivision, commencing this litigation, and a month later filed a\n\nfirst amended complaint.           Defendants and cross-appellants filed\n\nresponsive pleadings, and the Seaside Heights BOE filed a third-\n\nparty complaint.         Island Heights and its BOE and the Seaside\n\nHeights BOE sought dissolution of Central Regional, consistent\n\nwith the expressed desire of the majority of the voters in their\n\nmunicipalities.         Alternatively, the Seaside Heights BOE sought\n\npermission to withdraw with Seaside Park, but Island Heights did\n\nnot   seek    to   withdraw.       Both     municipalities         opposed   Seaside\n\nPark's unilateral withdrawal.             Moreover, neither Seaside Heights\n\nnor Island Heights, or their respective Boards of Education,\n\nsought alteration of the current funding formula.\n\n      In     December    2007,     plaintiffs        filed    a    second    amended\n\ncomplaint seeking an order:           (1) compelling the Commissioner to\n\nexercise     her   inherent      equitable      powers   to       dissolve   Central\n\n11\n   At that time, Berkeley Township had about seven times the\nnumber of registered voters of Seaside Heights, Seaside Park,\nand Island Heights, combined.    Moreover, Berkeley Township had\n1709 pupils in the District while Seaside Heights, Seaside Park,\nand Island Heights had a total of 311 pupils in the District.\n\n\n\n                                          27                                 A-0743-10T4\n\fRegional, permit Seaside Park to withdraw, or change Central\n\nRegional's funding method because the current allocation system\n\nis inequitable as applied to them (count one); (2) declaring the\n\nl975   and     l993   school   funding    legislation        unconstitutional        as\n\napplied to plaintiffs because it impairs their contractual right\n\nto per pupil funding (count two); (3) declaring the subject\n\nlegislation unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs because it\n\nconstitutes      a    taking   of    their    property      right    to   per    pupil\n\nfunding without just compensation (count three); (4) requesting\n\nthe    court    exercise    its     equitable    power      to   dissolve     Central\n\nRegional, permit plaintiffs' withdrawal, or change the funding\n\nmethod    for    Central   Regional      because      the   statutory     remedy     is\n\nillusory due to the larger number of voters in Berkeley Township\n\n(count four); (5) declaring the subject legislation violative of\n\nplaintiffs'      procedural due process because it provides Berkeley\n\nTownship with the absolute power to block any change in the\n\nallocation      method     (count    five);     (6)    declaring      the     subject\n\nlegislation      violative     of   plaintiffs'       substantive      due    process\n\nbecause the amendments are not rationally related to any alleged\n\nlegislative objective and deprive them of their property (tax\n\ndollars and contract rights) (count six); and (7) declaring the\n\ncurrent      allocation    method     does      not   provide       Seaside     Park's\n\nstudents with an efficient system of education because of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         28                                   A-0743-10T4\n\fdisproportional monetary burden on its taxpayers (count seven).\n\nDefendants filed responsive pleadings.\n\n      Prior      to     the    second      amended      complaint       being     filed,     the\n\nCommissioner           and    Berkeley          Township       moved     to     dismiss      the\n\ncomplaint        and     cross-complaint.                Central       Regional        and   the\n\nBerkeley Township BOE joined in the motion.                            Plaintiffs opposed\n\nthe   motion      on     the    basis      that       the     statutory       procedure      for\n\nwithdrawal or dissolution is illusory given the disparity of\n\nvoter    registration           in    Seaside         Park     and     Berkeley       Township.\n\nFollowing argument, Judge Frank A. Buczynski, Jr. issued an oral\n\ndecision and order on February 21, 2008, dismissing several of\n\nthe   claims      and    remanding         an    issue       for    clarification       by     the\n\nCommissioner.\n\n      The     Commissioner           had    sought       dismissal       of     the     amended\n\ncomplaint on the grounds of plaintiffs' failure to exhaust all\n\nadministrative remedies of modification of the current funding\n\nallocation,       permission          to    withdraw         from     the     District,      and\n\ndissolution of the District.                     See N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23.3, -54, -\n\n55, -56, and -57.             The court noted that Seaside Park had passed\n\na resolution petitioning Central Regional to alter the formula\n\nfor municipal contributions in l998 under N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23,\n\nwhich    apparently           was    ignored;         however,       plaintiffs       waited    a\n\ndecade      to    seek        judicial      review       or        assistance     to     compel\n\n\n\n\n                                                 29                                    A-0743-10T4\n\fcompliance.      Accordingly, the court concluded that plaintiffs\n\nhad not exhausted their statutory remedies for modification of\n\nthe current funding method for Central Regional.                    Dissolution,\n\nhowever,   had    already     been    voted    upon    by     the    constituent\n\nmunicipalities    and    rejected.      The    order   thus    reflected    that\n\ncount one was dismissed with prejudice insofar as plaintiffs and\n\nthird-party      plaintiffs     sought        an   order       directing      the\n\nCommissioner to exercise any authority to dissolve or permit\n\nwithdrawal from the District.\n\n      The remaining claims in count one relating to the statutory\n\nprocess for modifying the regional funding allocation method and\n\nthe   statutory     procedures       for      withdrawal      of     constituent\n\nmunicipalities    were    dismissed    without     prejudice.         The   order\n\nfurther provided that \"[a]s to the claim that plaintiffs have\n\nnot exhausted all administrative remedies,\" any public body can\n\nrequest in writing pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23 that Central\n\nRegional consider holding a referendum to change the current\n\nregional funding allocation, and failure of Central Regional to\n\ntimely respond will be deemed a denial of the request.\n\n      The court, however, remanded the matter to the Commissioner\n\n\"for clarification as to whether the Board of Review considered\n\nthe petition for an order to conduct a referendum on the issue\n\nof withdrawal on the merits.\"          The court required the Board to\n\n\n\n\n                                      30                                A-0743-10T4\n\fadvise in writing that it addressed the issue of withdrawal, or\n\nif    it     did     not,    to   consider       the    issue   \"as      directed    by     the\n\nCommissioner.\"\n\n       The court also dismissed the constitutional claims (counts\n\ntwo, three, five, and six) with prejudice as brought by the\n\ngovernmental entities, but denied the motion to dismiss as to\n\nthe    individual          taxpayer        plaintiffs.       Specifically,         the   court\n\nheld that Seaside Park and its BOE lacked standing to pursue the\n\nclaims       of    impairment         of    contracts,      taking    of    property,       and\n\nprocedural and substantive due process violations based on the\n\nprinciple, with citing reference, that municipalities and their\n\nboards       of    education      as       political   subdivisions         generally     lack\n\nstanding to assert constitutional claims against other political\n\nbodies such as the Commissioner.\n\n       The        court     further    dismissed       counts     four     and   seven    with\n\nprejudice as to all parties based on a failure to state a claim.\n\nAs     to     count       four,   the       court    held    that     the    mere    fact     a\n\nconstituent municipality may vote against the relief requested\n\nin a referendum does not make the remedy illusory as a matter of\n\nlaw,        noting    Lacey       Township's         withdrawal      from    the    District\n\nfollowing the 1975 revision.                   As to count seven, the court found\n\nthat plaintiffs failed to challenge any of the ten elements of a\n\n\n\n\n                                                31                                   A-0743-10T4\n\f\"thorough    and     efficient\"   education         articulated            in    Abbott    II,\n\nsupra, 119 N.J. at 350 n.23.\n\n      The only claims that survived the court's February 21, 2008\n\ndecision were those constitutional claims asserted on behalf of\n\nthe taxpayer plaintiffs in counts two, three, five, and six.\n\nSpecifically, those claims alleged that the l975 and l993 laws:\n\n(1) substantially impaired taxpayer plaintiffs' \"contracts\" with\n\nthe   regional     district;     (2)    constituted            a    taking      of   property\n\nwithout    just    compensation;        (3)    violated            taxpayer     plaintiffs'\n\nprocedural     due     process    rights;          and    (4)        violated        taxpayer\n\nplaintiffs' substantive due process rights.\n\n      Plaintiffs       moved     for     reconsideration.                 Following       oral\n\nargument on May 9, the court denied the motion on the record,\n\nmemorialized in an order of June 9, 2008.\n\n      On May 19, 2008, the Commissioner notified Judge Buczynski\n\nthat the Board only considered the issue of dissolution and not\n\nwhether     Seaside     Park     should       be    granted           a    referendum       on\n\nwithdrawal.       She explained that in Seaside Park's petition, the\n\nwithdrawal relief was only requested in the alternative if the\n\nBoard denied its request for a referendum on dissolution, which\n\nit did not.\n\n      By    resolution    dated        September         10,       2008,     Seaside      Park\n\napplied to the county superintendent for another investigation\n\n\n\n\n                                          32                                         A-0743-10T4\n\finto the advisability of Seaside Park's withdrawal from Central\n\nRegional.         Our     record    reflects       no   proceedings       on     this\n\napplication.\n\n       In response to the court's February 21, 2008 decision, by\n\nresolution of February 27, 2008, Seaside Park requested that\n\nCentral Regional conduct a public referendum regarding a revised\n\nfunding formula.          On April 21, 2009, a referendum was held with\n\nrespect to altering Central Regional's cost allocation method\n\nfrom equalized valuation to per pupil cost.                 It did not pass.\n\n       Seaside Park also pursued modification of the District's\n\nfunding formula with the Department of Education.                      By letters\n\ndated March 11, May 16, and July 29, 2008, the Mayor of Seaside\n\nPark    sought      the    Commissioner's      assistance      and   support       in\n\nresolving     the     \"inequitable     tax     apportionment\"        in     Central\n\nRegional.     The Commissioner responded to each of the letters,\n\nand    in   her   letter     of    August    18,    2008,    advised      that   the\n\nDepartment had reviewed the data Seaside Park provided and was\n\naware of the per pupil costs borne by the constituent members of\n\nCentral Regional.         She added:\n\n            The situation you described is not unlike\n            that     of     many     other    constituent\n            municipalities     involved    in    regional\n            districts where there is simultaneously a\n            wide   disparity   in   property  value   and\n            enrollment among the constituents.     As you\n            correctly pointed out, the existing tax\n            apportionment methodology, and any attempt\n\n\n\n                                        33                                 A-0743-10T4\n\f               to change it, is governed by statute.      I\n               recognize that it is often difficult and\n               sometimes impossible to get the statutory\n               voting majorities to effect the coveted\n               change.    Unfortunately, as Commissioner I\n               cannot impose that change, as I too must\n               adhere to the existing statute.     However,\n               with the recent passage of laws giving the\n               Executive County Superintendent a wide range\n               of authority to seek out and recommend\n               programs and services that lead to increased\n               efficiency at the district level, I will ask\n               that your district receive swift attention\n               in this matter.\n\n                    It is my hope that in cooperation with\n               the county office it may be possible to find\n               a solution to your problem that would be\n               acceptable to all of the parties involved,\n               and one that will not harm the school\n               district's ability to provide a quality\n               public school education to all of the\n               children.\n\n       In    2010,    the     parties      filed   cross-motions      for    summary\n\njudgment.        Following oral argument, by opinion and order of\n\nAugust 30, 2010, Judge Buczynski denied plaintiffs' motions and\n\ngranted      defendants'      motions      dismissing    the    remaining     counts\n\n(two, three, five, and six) as to the taxpayer plaintiffs.                         The\n\njudge       found    \"[t]he      record    [was]     bereft    of    any    evidence\n\nsupporting the existence of a contractual relationship between\n\nthe    parties[,]\"     expressly        concluding    the     resolutions    of    the\n\nconstituent districts to hold the 1954 referenda to allow voters\n\nto    decide    whether     to    create    the    District    did   not    meet   the\n\nrequirements of a valid contract.

Central   Regional   School\n             District   was  created   under   terms   and\n             conditions outlined by our Legislature.\n             Moreover, the funding formula was determined\n             by the Legislature.    Controlling costs for\n             education is one of several significant\n             issues facing our State.    Our Governor and\n             Legislature are facing complex economic\n             challenges.     It   is   the   Legislature's\n             obligation to provide for a thorough and\n\n\n\n                                             35                                         A-0743-10T4\n\f          efficient education as mandated in Article\n          VIII, Section 4, Paragraph 1 of the New\n          Jersey Constitution.    Therefore, it is for\n          the Legislature to determine if the current\n          educational funding used in Central Regional\n          School   District   should   be   revised or\n          repealed, not the court.\n\n     Plaintiffs   appealed.

Alternatively it sought a remand to the\n\nCommissioner with direction to apply North Haledon remedies.\n\n    In its cross-appeal, the Seaside Heights BOE argues that\n\nthe court erred in dismissing all counts of its complaint upon a\n\nfinding that it lacked standing to assert constitutional claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                      38                              A-0743-10T4\n\fAt oral argument before us, its attorney reiterated that it\n\njoined plaintiffs' request for dissolution of Central Regional\n\nor alternatively supported the withdrawal of Seaside Park and\n\nSeaside Heights, but did not support unilateral withdrawal by\n\nSeaside Park or revision of the tax apportion formula.\n\n      The Island Heights BOE asserts error by the court in: (1)\n\ndismissing       count    four        because           the    evidence       supported      a\n\ncognizable    claim      that       the    statutory          process    is    an   illusory\n\nremedy;    (2)     granting         summary     judgment        dismissing        count   two\n\nbecause the legislation violated the contracts clauses of the\n\nUnited    States    and       New    Jersey     Constitutions           as    applied;    (3)\n\ngranting     summary      judgment         as      to    count     three      because     the\n\nlegislation      constituted          an   unconstitutional             taking;     and   (4)\n\ngranting summary judgment dismissing count six because the 1975\n\nlegislation      violated       the       parties'       due    process       rights.       It\n\nfurther contends the evidence before the court demonstrated good\n\nand   just    cause      to    address        the       inequities      of    the    current\n\nsituation by ordering dissolution of the District.\n\n      Island Heights' arguments echo the abovementioned second,\n\nthird, and fourth arguments.                It additionally contends the court\n\nshould have accepted the allegations of the complaint as true\n\nfor purposes of the dismissal motion including, for example,\n\nthat the referenda were contracts, that taxpayer plaintiffs were\n\n\n\n\n                                              39                                    A-0743-10T4\n\fthird-party beneficiaries of the contract formed by the 1954\n\nreferenda,      that     the      l975        and        l993    revisions       substantially\n\nimpaired any contractual relationship plaintiffs may have had\n\nwith the other members of the District, and that plaintiffs had\n\na   property     interest        as     to      the      1954    referenda.           It    further\n\ncontends that material factual questions existed as to whether\n\nthe    l993     revision         allowed         for       a     realistic      means        for     a\n\nmunicipality to remove itself from the District and whether the\n\nfunding      changes    mandated           by      the    l975     revision      violated          the\n\nconstitutional         rights         of     the         residents       of     the    plaintiff\n\nmunicipalities.         At oral argument before us, the attorneys for\n\nIsland       Heights    and       its        BOE        reiterated       that     they       joined\n\nplaintiffs'         request      for         dissolution          of     Central       Regional;\n\nhowever, they did not support unilateral withdrawal by Seaside\n\nPark   or     revision      of    the        tax      apportion        formula,       and    Island\n\nHeights did not seek withdrawal from the District if it were not\n\ndissolved.\n\n                                                 IV.\n\n       The    Commissioner        argues         that      the    cross-appeals            filed    by\n\nIsland Heights and its BOE should be dismissed under Rule 2:8-2\n\nbecause      they    lack   standing            to      appeal    from    the    dismissal          of\n\nclaims they did not assert in the trial court.                                The Commissioner\n\nnotes that the Seaside Heights BOE filed cross-claims asserting\n\n\n\n\n                                                   40                                       A-0743-10T4\n\fthe   same    causes       of   action   as     plaintiffs   but    neither      Island\n\nHeights nor its BOE asserted affirmative claims other than a\n\ncounterclaim         for        indemnification       and     cross-claims           for\n\ncontribution and/or indemnification.\n\n      Only parties aggrieved by a judgment may appeal, meaning\n\nthose with \"a personal or pecuniary interest or property right\n\nadversely affected by the judgment in question.\"                         Howard Sav.\n\nInst. v.

Plaintiffs    were    afforded   all     favorable\n\ninferences as to their allegations of fact pertaining to the\n\nresolutions, referenda, studies, and financial inequalities of\n\nthe funding formula.     Their challenges on appeal with respect to\n\n\n\n\n                                   43                               A-0743-10T4\n\fthis issue, however, involve legal conclusions, such as whether\n\nthe municipal entities had standing; whether those facts created\n\na contract, property right, or established other prima facie\n\nconstitutional      claims;    or   whether       those    facts     justified   the\n\nextraordinary       relief    of    an    exception       to   the    doctrine    of\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies or a unique North Haledon\n\nremedy.     For the reasons set forth in the judge's comprehensive\n\noral decisions and written opinion, we are satisfied he provided\n\nample legal basis for dismissing some of the counts under Rule\n\n4:6-2(e),    and    the   balance    of     the   complaint     subsequently      on\n\ncross-motions for summary judgment.\n\n               A.    Count One -         Exhaustion of Remedies\n\n    In their first count, plaintiffs sought an order compelling\n\nthe Commissioner to use her \"inherent power\" as set forth in\n\nNorth Haledon to provide them with equitable relief in the form\n\nof dissolution of Central Regional, authorization for Seaside\n\nPark's withdrawal from Central Regional, or modification of the\n\ncost apportionment used by Central Regional.                   In February 2008,\n\nJudge Buczynski dismissed this count on the ground that the\n\nreferendum had been unsuccessful on dissolution and plaintiffs\n\nhad failed to exhaust their administrative remedies regarding\n\nwithdrawal from the District or alteration of the District's\n\nfunding formula.       He directed plaintiffs to pursue alteration of\n\n\n\n\n                                          44                               A-0743-10T4\n\fthe funding formula through the statutory mechanism, i.e., an\n\nupdated     request      to   Central      Regional,         and    remanded    to    the\n\nCommissioner       for    consideration           of     plaintiffs'      alternative\n\nrequest for a referendum on withdrawal.\n\n      Then,   at    plaintiffs'         request,        Central     Regional    held     a\n\nreferendum    for     alteration      of    the    District's       funding    formula,\n\nwhich failed.       Seaside Park requested similar relief in letters\n\nto the Commissioner, who responded that she had no authority to\n\ndo    so.     In      response     to      the     trial     court's    remand,       the\n\nCommissioner advised that she had only considered plaintiffs'\n\nalternative request for dissolution, which she had authorized by\n\nreferendum.\n\n      Plaintiffs first assert error by the court in finding they\n\nhad not exhausted their administrative remedies as to withdrawal\n\nand modification of the cost apportionment formula.                           They urge\n\nthat they diligently sought relief from Central Regional and the\n\nCommissioner to no avail.             Plaintiffs point to the fact that all\n\nof    the   feasibility       studies       addressed        both    Seaside     Park's\n\nwithdrawal from and dissolution of Central Regional and they\n\nsought alternate relief from the Commissioner.                          Nevertheless,\n\nthe   Commissioner       chose   to     only      act   on   their    request     for    a\n\nreferendum on dissolution, which was defeated by the voters in\n\nMarch 2007.     Plaintiffs also contend they made repeated requests\n\n\n\n\n                                           45                                   A-0743-10T4\n\fafter 1998 to have the funding method changed, which Central\n\nRegional ignored, a fact the court failed to consider in its\n\nexhaustion analysis.\n\n       Plaintiffs further argue that mandating the exhaustion of\n\nremedies   would       be    futile.        They    note    that    the     referenda   on\n\ndissolution and altering the cost apportionment formula failed,\n\nand posit that even if the Commissioner approved a referendum on\n\nwithdrawal,      it    likely    would      not     succeed    given      that   Berkeley\n\nTownship   has        more   total     voters       than    the     other    constituent\n\nmunicipalities combined.\n\n       Requiring       exhaustion      of     administrative         remedies      before\n\nseeking judicial relief is a tenet of administrative law and\n\nestablished by court rule.

The    case       can    and   should    be\n\nconsidered in the first instance by the Commissioner pursuant to\n\nthe statutory scheme.             The Legislature established a process for\n\nconstituent municipalities to seek to withdraw from a regional\n\nschool district.            N.J.S.A. 18A:13-51 to -59.                         The statutory\n\nmechanism provides that the Board is the sole entity that can\n\ngrant a petition for permission to conduct a referendum on the\n\nissue     of    dissolution        or    withdrawal.

Circumstances      and\n\nattitudes of voters change over time.                     For example, we cannot\n\nspeculate as to            the potential impact of Superstorm Sandy in\n\nOctober 2012 on the pupil enrollment and tax base of Seaside\n\nPark and the other constituent municipalities in the District.\n\nThe Legislature was well aware of this fluidity when it enacted\n\nand     revised     the     statutes    in     Title    18A    that    created    and\n\nimplemented the comprehensive scheme regarding regional school\n\ndistricts.\n\n\n\n\n                                          49                               A-0743-10T4\n\f      Contrary    to     plaintiffs'            assertion,          the    record         amply\n\nsupports the court's factual finding that Seaside Park slept on\n\nits   rights   after     it    passed         the    1998    Resolution         petitioning\n\nCentral     Regional      to        alter          the     formula        for     municipal\n\ncontributions.         Discovery        did    not       \"produce    evidence      that       at\n\nleast one request was made each year for the 3 or 4 years\n\nleading up to the filing of the Complaint.\"                               Plaintiff David\n\nMeyer's testimony was vague, couched in terms of \"I believe,\"\n\nwas     non-specific     as    to       dates,       and    was     largely       based       on\n\ninformation    provided       to    him       from       unidentified      persons.           No\n\ndocument was provided other than the 1998 and 2003 Resolutions\n\nand, as previously noted, no testimony or evidence was presented\n\nthat the 2003 Resolution was, in fact, sent to Central Regional.\n\nJudge    Buczynski     correctly        concluded         that    plaintiffs       were      not\n\nentitled to judicial intervention on this issue.                                 He advised\n\nSeaside Park to pursue its statutory remedy of adopting and\n\nforwarding a new resolution to Central Regional requesting a\n\nreferendum     authorizing          this       relief,       which    it        did.         The\n\nreferendum failed but the process was followed and the voters\n\nspoke,    as   anticipated         by    the       Legislature       in    devising        this\n\ncomprehensive scheme.\n\n\n\n\n                                              50                                       A-0743-10T4\n\f                 B.     Count One -       Commissioner's Authority\n\n      Plaintiffs next contend the court erred in dismissing count\n\none because, as they alternatively requested in their April 2006\n\nResolution,       the    Commissioner        has   inherent     authority        to    alter\n\nCentral     Regional's         funding      formula    under     North       Haledon        to\n\nprovide equitable relief to Seaside Park.                      They emphasize that\n\nin both cases when the voters initially approved the formation\n\nof the regional school district, costs were to be apportioned on\n\na   per   pupil       basis,   which      funding     method    was       changed     to   an\n\nequalized       valuation      by   the     1975   revision.        See     N.   Haledon,\n\nsupra,    181     N.J.    at   165.       This     resulted    in     a    significantly\n\ndisproportionate increase in the operating costs of both North\n\nHaledon    and    Seaside      Park    as    compared    with    their       constituent\n\ndistricts, even though their students only accounted for a small\n\nportion of the overall student body.

The Deputy\nAttorney General on behalf of the Commissioner objected to the\nsubmission as it was not part of the trial record, plaintiffs\ndid not move to supplement the record, and the parties were\ndeprived of an opportunity to respond during the litigation.\nSee R. 2:5-4, 2:5-5.         The Commissioner's objection was\nappropriate,   and   we   thus   disregard  this   post-argument\nsubmission.\n\n\n\n                                        52                                A-0743-10T4\n\fto    the    extraordinary            equitable      relief      afforded       in    the     North\n\nHaledon case.\n\n       Following          passage      of    the    1993     amendment,        North     Haledon\n\nunsuccessfully            pursued       a   referendum          seeking    to        return    the\n\ndistrict        to    a   per-pupil         cost    apportionment.             Ibid.          Here,\n\nhowever, as previously discussed, Seaside Park had not actively\n\npursued a referendum seeking to return Central Regional to a\n\nper-pupil        cost      apportionment           at     the    time     of     the     court's\n\ndismissal of the first count.                      More critically, however, North\n\nHaledon's application for withdrawal was granted by the Board,\n\nand    the      referendum        was       successful.           Id.     at    172,     176-84.\n\nHowever,        the   Court       having     found      it   was    one    of     \"those       rare\n\ncircumstances\"              requiring              judicial         intervention              with\n\nadministrative action, id. at 176, compelled North Haledon to\n\nremain      a   member      of    a    regional      school      district       in     order    to\n\nmaintain a racially diverse student body.

On the one hand,\nNorth Haledon lost a referendum on the\nquestion whether to alter the apportionment\nscheme because the statute, N.J.S.A. 18A:13-\n23, grants an effective veto power to\nHaledon and Prospect Park who benefit from\nthe equalized valuation method North Haledon\nseeks to change.    On the other hand, North\nHaledon   cannot   petition   for    withdrawal\nbecause of the impact of withdrawal on the\nracial balance of the students attending\nManchester Regional.\n\n     We    confronted     a    similar    issue\nsubsequent to our decision in Jenkins[ v.\nTownship of Morris School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1952973\"><a href=\"/opinion/1952973/jenkins-v-tp-of-morris-school-dist-and-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492-93, 504 (1971), where we held the\nCommissioner possessed the power and duty to\nact to prevent withdrawal of Morris Township\nstudents from Morristown High School and to\ncompel a merger of the two districts to\nprevent de facto segregation].

The boards\nof education from both towns recommended\nthat the \"allocation of costs between the\ncomponent municipalities of the regional\ndistrict be on the basis of apportionment\nvaluations rather than pupil enrollment.\"\nId. at 188-89. The Commissioner agreed, and\nordered   the   new   regional    district   to\napportion costs in the manner suggested by\nthe school boards.        Id. at 189.       The\nTownship Committee of Morris Township filed\nsuit, asserting the Commissioner lacked the\npower to impose an apportionment scheme on\nthe new district. Id. at 189-90.            The\nTownship   Committee    argued    that,   under\nN.J.S.A. 18A:13-34, the power to set the\n\n\n\n                      54                          A-0743-10T4\n\f         apportionment scheme had been conferred on\n         the voters of a regional district.  Id. at\n         190.\n\n              We rejected the Township's argument\n         because \"[t]he Commissioner's determination\n         as to allocation of the costs was reasonable\n         and was well within the ambit of his\n         powers.\" Id. at 191. We reasoned that the\n         controlling statutory provision, N.J.S.A.\n         18A:13-34    (which    calls   for   a   special\n         election on the apportionment of costs for a\n         regional district), was not applicable in\n         the context of a compulsory merger ordered\n         by the Commissioner, and that requiring\n         voter approval would \"disable effective\n         action toward fulfillment of the State's\n         educational and desegregation policies . . .\n         nullify[ing] the very holding in Jenkins.\"\n         Ibid.; cf.

In\n         this    case     also,     the    constitutional\n         imperative to address racial segregation\n         requires the Board to compel North Haledon\n         to remain in the Regional District despite\n         the tax burden on its citizens.            As in\n         Jenkins, when a constituent municipality is\n         compelled to participate in a Regional\n         District,     N.J.S.A.    18A:13-23     is   not\n         applicable     and   the     Commissioner    may\n         determine cost allocations among and between\n         Haledon, Prospect Park, and North Haledon.\n\n         [N.

Rather, the voters rejected\n\nthe   referendum   on   dissolution,      see    N.J.S.A.    18A:13-59,    never\n\nvoted on the issue of Seaside Park's withdrawal, see ibid., and\n\nrejected a modification of the funding formula after the court's\n\nFebruary 2008 decision, see N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23.3.                   Seaside Park\n\nmay   pursue   a   referendum   on   withdrawal      or     other    appropriate\n\nadministrative action to obtain relief.              However, because this\n\ncase does not implicate the impact of withdrawal or dissolution\n\non racial diversity or issues of other constitutional dimension\n\nafter a successful referendum, we discern no basis to invoke the\n\nextraordinary remedy of judicial intervention and mandate that\n\nthe Commissioner implement an equitable cost allocation.\n\n      Plaintiffs' recourse is to lobby the Legislature to change\n\nthe statutory mechanisms for dissolving or withdrawing from a\n\nregional school district, or for revising its funding formula.\n\nAs is evident from the extensive legislative history set forth\n\nin this opinion, it is clear the Legislature has considered this\n\nissue at length over the years and has chosen not to embrace\n\nplaintiffs' position.      We discern no basis here to second-guess\n\nthat policy choice, and thus affirm summary judgment dismissal\n\nof plaintiffs' first count.\n\n\n\n\n                                     56                                 A-0743-10T4\n\f             C.   Count Four - Court's Equitable Powers\n\n      Count four alleged that the statutory remedies available\n\nfor plaintiffs to dissolve, withdraw from, or change the funding\n\nformula for Central Regional are illusory because Seaside Park\n\nis unable to achieve any of these results.            The court dismissed\n\nthis count with prejudice as failing to state a claim, reasoning\n\nthat \"[t]he mere fact that any of the [constituent] districts\n\nmay vote against the change [in the apportionment method] does\n\nnot as a matter of law make the remedy illusory\" and that Lacey\n\nTownship's   successful   withdrawal     from   the    District   in   1977\n\ncontradicted plaintiffs' argument as to impossibility.\n\n      Judge Buczynski astutely elaborated on this point in his\n\nruling on plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, emphasizing\n\nthe   Legislature's   prerogative   in   enacting     this   comprehensive\n\nstatutory scheme:\n\n           This court understands the difficulty that\n           Plaintiffs face in withdrawing from the\n           district or in changing the apportionment\n           method.      The    Legislature    passed   these\n           statutes   as    part   of   their    legislative\n           responsibilities as a separate and distinct\n           branch of government as empowered by the\n           Constitution of this state.\n\n                But the mere fact that one district\n           enjoys a majority of registered voters does\n           not, as a matter of law, render this\n           statutory scheme as illusory.   Difficult to\n           navigate, yes, but an illusion, no. This is\n           not a cognizable Cause of Action in this\n\n\n\n\n                                    57                            A-0743-10T4\n\f             state.    Voter distribution will vary and\n             will always vary from district to district.\n\n                  The circumstances, as argued by the\n             Plaintiffs,   miss   the    point.      Voter\n             incentives will vary. And I understand that\n             will change from election to election.    But\n             the argument that one member of the district\n             enjoys the overwhelming number of registered\n             voters capable of defeating the referendum,\n             thereby   making    the   statutory    scheme\n             illusory, is soundly rejected by this Court.\n\n         The trial court's ruling on this issue is unassailable.\n\nThe Legislature has created a high bar for achieving alteration\n\nof   a    regional   district's   cost    allocation    formula,   N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:13-23 and 18A:13-23.3, or withdrawal from or dissolution of\n\na regional school district, N.J.S.A. 18A:13-59.                However, the\n\nstatutory procedures are not illusory, as evidenced by Lacey\n\nTownship's withdrawal from Central Regional and other instances\n\nin   which    regional   school   districts   have     been   dissolved,   or\n\nmunicipalities have obtained voter approval to withdraw.

It is for that reason\n             that the Robinson precepts do not come into\n             play.    Although the choice of method of\n             apportionment may create an unequal tax\n             burden among the municipalities of the\n             district, as the record reflects, it does\n             not influence the level of expenditures made\n             by the district for educational purposes.\n\n             [T]he method of allocation, whether it be on\n             the basis of ratables (N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23),\n             or the number of pupils enrolled, or on a\n             combination of both (N.J.S.A. 18A:13-23.1),\n             is a matter preeminently within the power of\n             the Legislature and has no bearing upon the\n             issue of constitutionality as delineated in\n             the Robinson cases.\n\n             [163 N.J.

For   example,     considering    a    challenge     to   the   1956\n\namendments,    wherein     the   Legislature    moved   from     \"ratables\"     to\n\n\"apportionment      valuations\"     for     purposes    of   funding     certain\n\nregional school districts, the Supreme Court spoke in language\n\nthat is equally applicable to plaintiffs' claims here:\n\n           In   essence,    we    are   presented    with   a\n           situation where Berkeley Heights claims a\n           vested right in unequal distribution of the\n           burden    [of   funding    a    regional    school\n           district], seeking a continuation of the\n           prior practice.      It complains that upon a\n           per capita student basis the property owners\n           of     that     township      are     paying     a\n           disproportionate     share    of   the   regional\n           burden, thereby subsidizing the education of\n           students      from      other      municipalities\n           comprising the regional school district.\n           The     factor      has    no      constitutional\n           implications.      Education is a matter of\n           public concern; the expenditures necessary\n           to fulfill the responsibility need not be\n           met on a basis of direct benefit to the\n           property charged.\n\n           [Berkeley Heights, supra, 23 N.J. at 282.]\n\nThe Court went on to state that, if Berkeley Heights wished to\n\nmove to apportionment of costs on a per pupil basis, it had to\n\nfollow the statutory procedures.

Plaintiffs do not contend that\n         there is any inequality in the school tax\n         burden of residents of Sea Bright compared\n         with residents of the other constituent\n         municipalities in the district.           To the\n         contrary, the objective of apportioning the\n         costs of a regional school district among\n         the constituent municipalities according to\n         their   property     values    is    to    impose\n         substantially equivalent tax burdens for\n         education upon all taxpayers of the district\n         regardless of the municipalities in which\n         they reside.    Thus, the method of financing\n         education in a regional school district is\n         substantially the same as in a single\n         municipality school district in that school\n         tax obligations depend upon the value of\n         each      taxpayer's        real        property.\n         Consequently,    we   have   no   hesitancy    in\n         rejecting plaintiffs' thesis that residents\n         of a municipality such as Sea Bright, which\n         has higher property values and/or fewer\n         children attending public school than other\n         municipalities    in    the   regional     school\n         district of which it is a part, have a\n         constitutional right to pay only the actual\n         costs of educating their resident children\n         who attend public school.

Following       the   l975     legislation,      regional     school\n\ndistricts     were   funded      the   same     as   every   K-12   public     school\n\ndistrict statewide, i.e., based on property taxes rather than a\n\nper pupil cost.

The l993 law provided circumstances by which\n\na district could modify the apportionment method and left the\n\ndecision of whether to modify to the voters of the constituent\n\nmunicipalities.            The    fact     that      equalized      valuation       is\n\ndisproportionate does not render the tax unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n                                          73                                 A-0743-10T4\n\f    \"[T]he power of taxation should not be confused with the\n\npower of eminent domain.\"        Houck v.

The judge\n\nrejected plaintiffs' general request for equitable relief on the\n\nground that he had no authority to grant it - the Legislature\n\nhad provided statutory means for plaintiffs to pursue the relief\n\nthey   sought    and    judicial        override        of   those       procedures     would\n\nviolate   the    principle         of    separation          of    powers.        Moreover,\n\nnotwithstanding        the    cost       borne     by     Seaside        Park's    property\n\nowners, funding of regional school districts on the basis of\n\nequalized valuation was fundamentally fair.\n\n       We discern no error in the conclusions reached by Judge\n\nBuczynski.      Under Rule 4:5-2, litigants are required to include\n\nin their pleadings \"a statement of the facts on which the claim\n\nis based, showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and a\n\ndemand for judgment for the relief to which the pleader claims\n\nentitlement.\"      Even read indulgently, see Van Dam Egg Co. v.\n\nAllendale    Farms,     Inc.,      199    N.J.
