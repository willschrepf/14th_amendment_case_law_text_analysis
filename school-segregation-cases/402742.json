Co.,  954 F.2d 19, 20\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir. 1992).   The R/V Endeavor is a  vessel chartered by the\n\nNational Science Foundation to  URI's Graduate School of Oceanog-\n\nraphy  (GSO) for research purposes.   In the summer of 1985, John\n\nMetz, the GSO's port  engineer, discovered serious rust corrosion\n\non  the inside of the  Endeavor's steel ballast  tanks, which are\n\nsubmerged in  salt water during  normal operation of  the vessel.\n\nResponding  to  a  Chesterton advertisement,  Metz  received test\n\nsamples of  \"Rust Transformer,\"  a Chesterton product  which pur-\n\nportedly converts surface corrosion  into a rust-inhibitor, which\n\nin turn serves  as a base for further coats  of paint.  Satisfied\n\nwith  the  test-sample  results,  Metz  invited Chesterton  sales\n\nrepresentatives  aboard  the  Endeavor.    After  inspecting  the\n\n                                2\n\nEndeavor's ballast tank  corrosion, Chesterton's  representatives\n\nrecommended that  Metz use Chesterton's 1-2-3  System (using Rust\n\nTransformer,  a primer, and a final  enamel coat) to rehabilitate\n\nthe  tanks.   Metz  ordered the  1-2-3  System on  September  11,\n\n1985.1   Six months after URI completed the 1-2-3 System applica-\n\ntion, the  new coating on  the ballast tanks began  to loosen and\n\nflake  off.    URI allegedly  expended  $100,000  to correct  the\n\nproblem.\n\n          URI  brought suit  against Chesterton  in Rhode  Island\n\nstate  court  on   May 4,  1989,   alleging  negligence,   strict\n\nliability,  and  breaches  of  an express  warranty  and  implied\n\nwarranties  of  merchantability  and  fitness  for  a  particular\n\npurpose.    Chesterton promptly  removed  the  action to  federal\n\ndistrict court.   URI moved for remand on the ground that URI, as\n\nan \"alter  ego, arm, or agent\"  of the State of  Rhode Island, is\n\nnot  a \"citizen\"  of Rhode  Island for  diversity purposes.   The\n\ndistrict court denied URI's  remand motion without an evidentiary\n\nhearing,  relying  on an  earlier  district  court decision,  see\n                                                                 \n\nVanlaarhoven v. Newman,  564 F. Supp.  145 (D.R.I. 1983)  (Selya,\n                      \n\nJ.), which  determined that URI was not an \"arm\" of the State for\n\nsovereign immunity purposes.\n\n                    \n\n     1The original URI complaint  alleged that Metz was reassured\nby Chesterton  that  the 1-2-3  System would  work on  Endeavor's\nballast tanks.  On the other hand, the product's written instruc-\ntions advised  that the system  was not recommended  for surfaces\nregularly  immersed in sea water.   In an  amended complaint, URI\nalleged that  Chesterton  representatives observed  the URI  crew\napplying  the 1-2-3 System to the ballast tanks, but said nothing\nto URI representatives  about the unsuitability of the  system or\nits improper application.\n\n                                3\n\n          This  court declined  to entertain  URI's interlocutory\n\nappeal  from the  jurisdictional  ruling  but noted  disagreement\n\namong  the circuits as to the proper criteria for determining the\n\ncitizenship  of state  universities for  diversity purposes.   We\n\nrecommended that the district court conduct \"limited factfinding\"\n\non remand relating to several factors pertinent to URI's citizen-\n\nship,  including  (1)  \"the degree  of  URI's  dependence on  and\n\nfunctional integration  with the  state treasury,\" (2)  \"the per-\n\ncentage of URI's annual budget that derives from state appropria-\n\ntions,\"  and (3)  \"whether the legislature  bases levels  of such\n\nappropriations  in part  on the  amount of  nonappropriated funds\n\navailable to URI.\"2   On remand, the district court  denied URI's\n\nmotion  for  a pretrial  evidentiary  hearing  relating to  these\n\njurisdictional  matters.   The  jury trial  began on  December 3,\n\n1991.  After the  district court excluded the testimony  of URI's\n\nonly expert witness on the issue of contract damages, URI abrupt-\n\nly  rested its case.  Judgment  was entered for Chesterton on all\n\ncounts, as  a matter of law,  pursuant to Fed. R.  Civ. P. 50(a),\n\nand URI appealed.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n     2As  an alternate  and independent  reason for  declining to\nentertain  the interlocutory  appeal, this  court noted  that the\nlitigation  was unlikely to be so protracted as to warrant appel-\nlate   interruption, given the nature and scope of URI's contract\nclaims.\n\n                                4\n\nA.   Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n                                \n\n          URI urges us to  set aside the judgment and  remand the\n\ncase  to state court on  the ground that  Chesterton, a Massachu-\n\nsetts corporation,  has not established diversity.   URI contends\n\nthat it  is not a  Rhode Island  \"citizen,\" but a  mere \"arm\"  or\n\n\"alter ego\" of the  State.  See  Gibbs v. Buck,  307 U.S. 66,  69\n                                              \n\n(1939) (holding that party  invoking diversity jurisdiction  must\n\nestablish sufficient  facts to  warrant its exercise);  Bank One,\n                                                                 \n\nTexas, N.A. v.

Although we  have noted the  essential\nsimilarity between  the immunity and diversity  tests, see George\n                                                                 \nR. Whitten, Jr. Inc.  v.

In this case, however, we address, and reject, two\nproposed  distinctions.    First,  Eleventh   Amendment  analysis\nnormally would focus  primary attention on any financial drain on\n                                                              \nthe State treasury caused by a judgment adverse to URI, see Quern\n                                                                 \nv.

Jordan, 415 U.S.\n                                                       \n651, 663 (1974),  a concern which  obviously does not arise  in a\ndiversity case where the State-related plaintiff seeks to recover\n                                                                 \na  monetary judgment.   Significantly,  however, courts  have not\naccepted the notion  that sovereign immunity  exists only if  the\n                                                         \nState treasury is  threatened.  See Cory  v. White, 457 U.S.  85,\n                                                  \n90-91  (1982); Kroll v. Board  of Trustees of  Univ. of Illinois,\n                                                                \n934 F.2d  904,  908 (7th  Cir.),  cert. denied,  112  S.

(Troy\n                        \nState University), cert. denied, 474  U.S. 1007 (1985).   Whether\n                               \nin  the  diversity or  the  immunity context,  the  analysis must\ncenter on  the State-related party's enduring legal identity as a\njuridical entity separate from the State.\n     The second  possible distinction  we must consider  is that,\nunlike sovereign  immunity, nondiversity cannot be  waived by the\nState.  See State Highway Comm'n  of Wyoming v. Utah Constr. Co.,\n                                                                \n278 U.S. 194, 199 (1929); George R.

Generally,  however, the  \"waiver of  immunity\" inquiry\nwould  follow the  initial determination  that the  State-related\n             \nentity was not sufficiently autonomous to escape characterization\nas an \"alter ego\"  of the State.   For example, in  Vanlaarhoven,\n                                                                \nthe court based   its holding on the alternate  ground that, even\nif URI were  merely an \"alter  ego\" of the  State, the State  had\nexpressly waived  URI's immunity under  state law by  granting it\nthe authority to \"sue or be sued\" in its own name.

The language of the statute neverthe-\nless suggests  that the  Board's business decisions  to purchase,\nadminister, and dispose of URI property are largely unrestricted,\nand  absent misfeasance would  be impervious to  challenge by the\nState.  See  Kovats, 822 F.2d at  1309 (legal title  to property,\n                   \n\n                                20\n\nfrom  taxation, see R.I. Gen. Laws   44-3-3(1); Powers v.

Often,  tax policy  is used  by\n\nStates to  encourage certain  types of  activity even though  the\n\ntarget  entities  are  otherwise  entirely  independent  of state\n\ngovernment.  Rhode Island is no exception in this  respect.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  R.I. Gen.

R.I.  Gen. Laws   44-3-3(8) (private  school property\n\nis tax exempt to  the extent it is  used \"exclusively for  educa-\n\ntional  purposes\").  Arguably,  of course,  tax exemption  may be\n\nattributable to  the State's equitable title to the URI property.\n                                      \n\nWe  think it  at least  as plausible,  however, that  the general\n\nassembly exempts  Board  property from  taxation  as a  means  of\n\nfostering performance  of the  Board's corporate functions.

For example, though\n\nURI's  treasurer  must  submit  financial reports  to  the  state\n\ncontroller for  \"preaudit,\" the purely \"ministerial\"  audit moni-\n\ntors Board  expenditures only for possible  illegality and avail-\n\nability of funds, not with a view to the prudence  of the Board's\n\nfinancial decisions.

See Kovats, 822\n                                                            \n\n                                27\n\nF.2d at 1311 (mere \"reporting\" of spending decisions not  indica-\n\ntive  of lack of  autonomy).  URI  makes a rather  wan attempt to\n\nundermine Vanlaarhoven by citing a  subsequently enacted \"limita-\n                      \n\ntion\" on the Board's purchasing power.  See R.I. Gen.

Laws   16-59-20  (\"controller [shall not] interpose his\n\nor  her judgment\").   See supra  note 7.   Far  from a meaningful\n                               \n\nlimitation  on the  Board's  power to  disburse  its funds,  this\n\nmeasure  appears to have been designed solely to enable the Board\n\nto  avail itself of the  financial savings associated with pooled\n\npurchasing power.\n\n          With Moor as our benchmark, therefore, we conclude that\n                   \n\nthe Rhode  Island statutory  scheme demonstrates that  the Board,\n\nunlike more \"typical\"  state educational entities, possesses  the\n\nessential attributes of operational and financial autonomy needed\n\nto qualify as a Rhode Island \"citizen\" for diversity purposes.\n\n          b.  \"Functional Integration\"\n                                     \n\n          In a  resourceful  effort to  avoid  Vanlaarhoven,  URI\n                                                           \n\nurges its  \"functional integration\" theory,  whose genesis appar-\n\nently lay  in our earlier \"recommendation\" to  the district court\n\nfollowing dismissal of URI's interlocutory  appeal.  See supra p.\n                                                              \n\n4.  URI argues, for example, that the Board's ostensible indepen-\n\ndence  in financial matters would prove illusory if, in fact, (1)\n\n                                28\n\nthe  Board's  annual  budget were  funded  by  State-appropriated\n\nmonies to such  an extent that its  nonappropriated revenues were\n\nrendered  functionally  insignificant, or  (2)  the  Rhode Island\n\ngeneral assembly  were to  employ its statutory  pre-audit proce-\n\ndures to attune the  Board's annual State appropriation so  as to\n\nforce the  Board to expend its anticipated and accumulated nonap-\n\npropriated revenues in lieu  of a more ample annual  State appro-\n\npriation.  See,  e.g., Krieger, 765 F. Supp. at  761 (evidence of\n                              \n\nactual control by State would trump evidence of formal autonomy).\n\n          We emphasize that URI does not assert the existence  of\n                                                             \n\nbudgetary data which would demonstrate that the Board enjoys less\n\nfinancial autonomy  than the  enabling statute indicates.   More-\n\nover, notwithstanding its efforts  to persuade the district court\n\nto conduct a separate  evidentiary hearing on diversity jurisdic-\n\ntion, URI has taken no initiative to substantiate its \"functional\n\nintegration\"  theory, either  by  way of  an evidentiary  proffer\n\nbelow,  or even by way of  the barest allusion to supportive data\n\nin its  brief or oral argument  before this court.   Instead, URI\n\ninsists  that Chesterton,  as the  party requesting  removal, see\n                                                                 \n\nsupra Section II.A,  was required  to bear the  entire burden  of\n                                                      \n\nproof and production on every conceivable fact     even including\n\n\"negative\" facts     which  might prove  relevant to the  Board's\n                                       \n\ncitizenship  status.  Thus, even  after trial on  the merits, URI\n\nspeculates that  there may  be evidence  which  would preclude  a\n\nreliable determination as to federal diversity jurisdiction.  For\n\nthe  reasons  hereinafter  explained,  we  think  URI inadvisably\n\n                                29\n\nbanked on a cramped view of the proper allocation of the  burdens\n\nof  proof and  production relating  to the  jurisdictional issue,\n\nmisapprehended the proper role of  \"functional integration\" data,\n\nand exaggerated the import of our earlier \"recommendation\" to the\n\ndistrict court for further factfinding on remand.\n\n          For some  reason, our  earlier invitation to  engage in\n\nadditional factfinding  on remand  went unheeded.   URI intimates\n\nthat it did  all it  could by requesting  a separate  evidentiary\n                                                    \n\nhearing,  and  that  the  district court  simply  discounted  our\n\nrecommendation  as  to  the  possible  relevance  of  \"functional\n\nintegration\"  evidence.   In  our view,  however, URI  mischarac-\n\nterizes the remand order.  While we suggested the desirability of\n\nsupplementary factfinding, the  precise factfinding procedure  to\n                                                             \n\nbe employed always rests within the sound discretion of the trial\n\ncourt.  See Foman v. Davis,  371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); O'Toole v.\n                                                              \n\nArlington Trust Co., 681 F.2d 94,  98 (1st Cir. 1982) (finding no\n                   \n\nabuse of discretion,  as \"the  court was under  no obligation  to\n\nrequire  an evidentiary  hearing  . . . [but]  has  the right  to\n\ndetermine the procedures it will employ to decide a jurisdiction-\n\nal issue\")  (citation omitted).    At no  time did  we require  a\n\nseparate  evidentiary   hearing  on  the   jurisdictional  issue.\n        \n\nIndeed, given our alternative  ground for dismissing URI's inter-\n\nlocutory appeal    namely, that it appeared unlikely that a trial\n\non the merits would be prolonged    the district court's decision\n\nto defer its jurisdictional determination until trial was entire-\n\nly consistent with the remand order.\n\n                                30\n\n          Nor did the district court prevent URI from introducing\n                                            \n\nany such statistical evidence at  trial.  Following an unrecorded\n\npretrial  conference with  counsel, the  district court  did deny\n\nURI's motion for a separate evidentiary hearing.  In that connec-\n\ntion,  URI has provided  no indication  of the  legal contentions\n\nadvanced by either party  at the pretrial conference, nor  of the\n\ngrounds for the  district court's decision  to bypass a  pretrial\n\nevidentiary hearing.  Chesterton, on the other hand, asserts that\n\nthe conference  involved an extended discussion  about the appro-\n\npriateness  of a  separate pretrial hearing,  but that  the court\n\nopted to permit the presentation of evidence on the jurisdiction-\n\nal issue at trial.\n                 \n\n          Viewed  in  proper procedural  context,  therefore, the\n\npresent claim hinges entirely  on URI's unremitting allocation of\n\nthe burdens of persuasion  and production to Chesterton, and  not\n\non  any lack of opportunity  to raise or  substantiate its \"func-\n\ntional integration\" claim.   Significantly, our remand order took\n\nno position  as to which party  would be obliged  to come forward\n                        \n\nwith evidence of functional integration, nor did it suggest  that\n\nproof of  lack of  functional integration  was required  in every\n\ncase.  \n\n          Of  course,  Chesterton, the  party  invoking diversity\n\njurisdiction, bears  the ultimate burden of  proving diversity of\n                                 \n\ncitizenship.   See Topp v. Compair, Inc.,  814 F.2d 830, 839 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1987).  Nevertheless, there  is more to  be said concerning\n\nthe burden of production:\n\n                                31\n\n          [T]he  party  who  invoked  diversity  juris-\n          diction has  the burden of  proving all facts\n          upon which jurisdiction  could be  sustained.\n          If  [the invoking  party]  does  construct  a\n          prima facie showing  of diversity, [the chal-\n          lenging  party] must  overcome or  rebut this\n          showing  in order  to  dismiss  the  [removal\n          petition].

Although  neither\n\nChesterton nor  URI submitted  affidavits, depositions,  or sworn\n\nstatements, the  district court  properly conducted  inquiry into\n\nthe  controlling  jurisdictional  facts,  pursuant  to  Moor,  by\n                                                            \n\nexamining the Rhode Island enabling statute.  Under Moor, such an\n                                                        \n\ninquiry  is designed primarily to provide the court with a compe-\n\ntent  basis for determining the legal  framework within which the\n\nrelationship  between  a State  and  a  State-created entity  are\n\nrequired  to function.   In  the present  case, the  Rhode Island\n\nenabling statute constituted a sufficient proffer on the issue of\n\nthe Board's financial autonomy.  See,  e.g., Tradigrain, 701 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  1132 (\"the state's  constitutional, statutory, and decisional\n\nlaw\" comprise source material  for the court's citizenship analy-\n\nsis);  see also Indiana Port Comm'n v.

Nevertheless, because  it is clear  that the\n\nBoard is \"dependent\" on the State for some unknown portion of its\n\nrevenues, we  will assume,  arguendo, that certain  provisions of\n                                    \n\nthe enabling  statute cited  by URI  did give rise  to a  genuine\n\ndispute  over an  important  jurisdictional fact     whether  the\n\nBoard actually  enjoys financial autonomy  from the State.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., R.I. Gen.

First,  \"functional\n\nintegration\"  may  obtain  if  the State  nonetheless  bears  the\n\nultimate  legal responsibility to  answer for debts  on which the\n        \n\nstate university defaults.  Thus, the very financial independence\n\naccorded  the  Board  under  the Rhode  Island  enabling  statute\n\nultimately might expose  the State treasury to liability  for the\n\nBoard's  financial obligations.  In Kovats, 822 F.2d at 1309, the\n                                          \n\nThird Circuit flatly rejected such a functional integration claim\n\nwhere the  legislature's decision to answer  for the university's\n\ndebts  appeared to be purely discretionary  and not legally bind-\n\ning.   Cf. also Fitchik, 873 F.2d  at 661 (the State's disclaimer\n                       \n\nof  any obligation to  \"cover\" is the  primary consideration, not\n\nthe relative size (50-70%)  of the state appropriation); but  cf.\n                                                                 \n\nHall, 742 F.2d  at 304-05 (no  statute prohibits university  from\n    \n\nincurring debt in state's name, and fact that state  will have to\n                              \n\n\"cover\" debt by law  is indicative of \"alter ego\"  status); Krie-\n                                                                 \n\nger, 765 F.

Thus, argues URI,  the district court  was compelled to\n\nfind that Chesterton did  not sustain its burden of  proof on the\n\nBoard's financial autonomy.\n\n          In characterizing  such statistical data  as indispens-\n\nable jurisdictional \"facts,\" however,  URI misconstrues our  case\n\nlaw,18 as well  as Supreme Court precedent.  We  have never inti-\n\nmated that such statistical information is itself a jurisdiction-\n\nal fact,  the absence of which would  invariably defeat diversity\n\njurisdiction.    The  core  jurisdictional fact,  after  all,  is\n\nfinancial autonomy.   Under  the seminal Supreme  Court decisions\n\n                    \n\n     18On occasion, we have adverted to this  kind of statistical\nevidence in the  appellate record, as  confirmation that a  party\n                                 \ncould not establish diversity.   See Perez v. Rodriguez  Bou, 575\n                                                            \nF.2d 21, 25  (1st Cir. 1978) (in  dicta, noting that  the \"extent\nand nature\" of the  Commonwealth's support for the  University of\nPuerto Rico  suggested lack  of autonomy, but  without describing\nprecise statistics, or stating whether University had other forms\nof substantial  nonappropriated income).  On  other occasions, we\nhave remanded for further factfinding  where it appeared that the\nautonomy  equation was so  evenly balanced that  the proponent on\nthe jurisdictional issue  could not meet  its ultimate burden  of\nproof without resort to  such statistical information, see, e.g.,\n                                                                \nAinsworth, 818 F.2d at 1038-39 (noting various factors supporting\n         \nand  undermining autonomy,  and remanding  to district  court for\nhearing on whether entity receives \"significant funding\" from the\nCommonwealth),  and that the parties had not been afforded a full\nand  fair opportunity to present evidence in the trial court. Id.\n                                                                 \nat  1038 n.23 (as an  alternative reason for  remand, noting fact\nthat proponent had  not raised  the \"alter ego\"  issue until  its\nappellate reply brief, denying opponent \"the opportunity to argue\n. . .  or to rebut\" the  proponent's contentions).   Thus, in our\nearlier denial of the interlocutory appeal in this case, we acted\non  the side of caution and judicial economy in recommending that\nthe district  court allow the  parties an opportunity  to present\n                                                     \nthis kind of evidence, on  the chance that it might be  needed to\ntip the \"alter ego\" balance in the final analysis.\n\n                                39\n\ndealing with  both immunity and diversity, there  is a noticeable\n\nlack  of reliance on such statistical data, a fact which confutes\n    \n\nits indispensability.  See, e.g., Mount Healthy, 429 U.S. at 280-\n                                               \n\n81  (noting  only \"significant  amount  of  money\" received  from\n                              \n\nState)  (emphasis added);  Moor, 411  U.S. at  719-20 (discussing\n                               \n\ncounty's  ability to  raise  its own  funds,  not whether  county\n\nreceived any funds from State); see also Metcalf &amp; Eddy,     F.2d\n                                        \n\nat      [No. 91-1602, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 10064, at 15 (1st Cir.\n\nMay  3, 1993)].    Unsurprisingly, as  the divergent  conclusions\n\nreached  on essentially  similar \"statistical\"  evidence suggest,\n\nsee supra pp. 37-38,  a closely calibrated\" statistical\" approach\n         \n\nin these cases entails its own impediments to  reliable decision-\n\nmaking; namely, at  what levels should  the absolute or  relative\n\nsize  of an entity's  appropriated funding be  considered so sub-\n\nstantial, or  its nonappropriated funding so  insubstantial, that\n\n\"functional integration\" is to  be presumed, or a  previous judi-\n\ncial determination  of the  entity's citizenship set  aside?   We\n\nbelieve a wide margin  of variance would need to  be demonstrated\n\nbefore it could  be found to  have effected a  sea change in  the\n\nentity's jurisdictional status.   After all, while not immutable,\n\nthe  citizenship  of a  public  corporation,  like its  domicile,\n\nshould be  accorded a  reasonable measure  of permanence; at  the\n\nvery  least, ordinary  fluctuations  in  the university's  budget\n\nought not occasion continual  judicial reevaluation.  Thus, trial\n\ncourt rulings  on subject matter jurisdiction  normally ought not\n\nawait  budgetary  data  and  oscillations  absent  an evidentiary\n\n                                40\n\nproffer of sufficient import to alter a determination based on an\n\nanalysis of state  statutory and  decisional law.   In our  view,\n\nthis  approach best  comports with  the analysis  contemplated in\n\nMoor. \n    \n\n          In considering whether Chesterton carried its burden of\n\npersuasion on the  issue of  financial autonomy, we  think it  is\n\ninescapable that the Board's nonappropriated revenues represent a\n\nsubstantial budget component; tuition, housing, dining and admin-\n\nistrative  fees, donations,  bequests,  federal  grants, and  the\n\nproceeds from discretionary sales and leases of URI property  are\n\nnot  insubstantial  revenue sources.    Thus,  on its  face,  the\n\nenabling statute demonstrates Board  access to, and control over,\n\nsubstantial amounts  of nonappropriated  revenues.   Following  a\n\ntrial on the merits, and  absent any indication that URI did  not\n\nhave  a  fair opportunity  to  identify  and produce  statistical\n\nevidence which  might rebut  Chesterton's demonstration  that the\n\nenabling  statute  confers the  requisite  financial  autonomy to\n\nqualify the  Board for citizenship  under Moor, we  conclude that\n                                              \n\nURI's appellate challenge comes too late.\n\n          Finally, in a similar vein,  URI suggests that it might\n                                                                 \n\nbe  that the State routinely attunes  its annual appropriation to\n\nthe  Board in  response to  the total  amount  of nonappropriated\n\nfunds available to the Board, including the nonappropriated funds\n\naccumulated from  prior fiscal years and those anticipated in the\n\ncurrent  fiscal  year.   Under this  \"linkage\" theory,  the State\n\ncould  compel the Board to expend all accumulated and anticipated\n                                 \n\n                                41\n\nnonappropriated funds  merely by  limiting its  annual appropria-\n\ntions to the  difference between the Board's  fiscal year revenue\n\nrequirements and the total available nonappropriated funds.\n\n          URI's contention  that the State might  link its appro-\n\npriations to  the availability of nonappropriated  Board funds is\n\npure  conjecture.    Arrayed  against URI's  conjecture  are  the\n\nexplicit provisions of the enabling statute,  as amended in 1988,\n\nwhich expressly  state that all nonappropriated  funds, including\n\naccumulated  nonappropriated  funds, are  to  be  deposited in  a\n\nsegregated account under the exclusive control of the Board.  See\n                                                                 \n\nKovats,  822 F.2d at 1308-09 (mere possibility of offset by state\n      \n\nappropriations not  especially probative of  \"alter ego\" status).\n\nAppropriated  funds, on the other hand, are  to be set apart in a\n\nseparate account, and all unexpended balances in the appropriated\n                                                                 \n\nfunds account are to  be redeposited to the general  fund.  Unex-\n                                                         \n\npended nonappropriated funds, however, are carried over from year\n                      \n\nto year  in  the Board's  nonappropriated  funds account.    This\n\nseparate  treatment of  appropriated  and nonappropriated  funds,\n\ndeliberately mandated  by the  general assembly, would  have been\n\nboth superfluous and  contraindicated had routine  \"linkage\" been\n\nintended.  Cf. Allende v. Shultz,  845 F.2d 1111, 1117 (1st  Cir.\n                                \n\n1988)  (in general,  courts  should  avoid interpretations  which\n\nwould render a statutory provision meaningless).   In the absence\n\nof any countervailing showing, the Board's financial autonomy, as\n\nordained by the  general assembly  in the  enabling statute,  was\n\n                                42\n\nsufficient to sustain Chesterton's burden of proof on the central\n\njurisdictional fact at issue under 28 U.S.C.   1332.\n\n          Accordingly, having weighed  the myriad factors contem-\n\nplated by  Moor, we  conclude that  the district court  correctly\n               \n\ndetermined  that Chesterton  met  its ultimate  burden of  estab-\n\nlishing that the Board  enjoys \"a sufficiently independent corpo-\n\nrate character  to dictate  that it  be treated as  a citizen  of\n\n[Rhode Island].\"  Moor, 411 U.S. at 721.\n                      \n\nB.   Evidence of Damages\n                        \n\n          In  a ruling  that  proved fatal  to  URI's claims  for\n\ndamages for breach of warranties, the district court excluded the\n\ntestimony of URI's longtime  controller, Ronald Osborne, a certi-\n\nfied public accountant in charge of all URI financial information\n\nand  accounting practices.    URI  called  Osborne as  an  expert\n\nwitness to establish  the amount of money it spent to correct the\n\ncorrosion problem allegedly left unremedied by Chesterton's 1-2-3\n\nSystem.  URI  proffered no  other evidence on  damages.   Osborne\n\ntestified on direct examination  that he previously had performed\n\ncost assessments  on various  URI projects,  and  that his  usual\n\nprocedure  was  to  consult  URI financial  records  and  conduct\n\ninterviews with URI personnel involved in the particular project.\n\nHe consulted GSO  records to ascertain the  overtime hours worked\n\nin 1985, and conducted several interviews with URI employees  and\n\nvarious \"private vendors\" to  ascertain which overtime hours were\n\nattributable to  the correction of Endeavor's  corrosion problem.\n\nTo these figures he added the  cost of fringe benefits (22%)  for\n\n                                43\n\novertime  employees,  and  \"indirect costs,\"  at  an  unspecified\n\npercentage rate,  which included  expenses for  \"accounting, pur-\n\nchasing,  maintenance,  [and] utilities.\"   Before  Osborne could\n\nstate an opinion concerning  the total monetary damages sustained\n\nby URI, Chesterton objected  on the grounds that (1)  Osborne was\n\nnot a  qualified expert on  damages calculation, (2)  the factual\n\nbases for his calculation  included inadmissible hearsay, and (3)\n\nthe damages  calculation included inappropriate factors,  such as\n\n\"indirect costs.\"\n\n          URI  relied on Federal Rules of Evidence 703 and 705 as\n\ngrounds  for the admission of Osborne's expert opinion.  Rule 703\n\nprovides that \"[t]he  facts or  data . . . upon  which an  expert\n\nbases an opinion or inference . . . [,] [i]f of a type reasonably\n\nrelied upon by experts  in the particular field in  forming opin-\n\nions or inferences upon the subject, . . . need not be admissible\n\nin evidence.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 703.  Rule 705  provides that \"[t]he\n\nexpert  may testify  in terms  of opinion  or inference  and give\n\nreasons therefor without prior disclosure of the underlying facts\n\nor data, unless the court requires  otherwise.  The expert may in\n                                             \n\nany event be required to disclose the underlying facts or data on\n\ncross-examination.\"   Fed. R. Evid.  705 (emphasis  added).   The\n\ncourt sustained Chesterton's objection on the ground that URI had\n\nnot demonstrated that the  facts relied on  by Osborne were of  a\n\ntype reasonably relied on by experts in damages assessment.19\n\n                    \n\n     19The court  also expressed a firm  preference for requiring\npreliminary  disclosure of  the factual  \"background\" for  an ex-\npert's opinion on  direct examination.  The court considered this\n\n                                44\n\n          URI's central  arguments on  appeal are: (1)  Rules 703\n\nand 705 afford the right to present unsubstantiated expert testi-\n                        \n\nmony on  direct examination without first  disclosing its factual\n\nunderpinnings, and  (2) the district court  abused its discretion\n\nby adhering to its self-imposed rule  of exclusion, a per se rule\n                                                            \n\nwhich, according  to URI, runs  counter to the  \"burden shifting\"\n\nimplicit in Rule 705  and disregards the obligation  to predicate\n\nits exclusionary ruling on the particular circumstances.\n\n          We have no doubt  that Rules 703 and 705  permitted the\n                                                             \n\ndistrict  court  to   admit  Osborne's  opinion  testimony,   see\n                                                                 \n\nInternational Adhesive  Coating Co. v. Bolton  Emerson Int'l, 851\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 540, 545 (1st Cir. 1988) (business and financial records are\n\n\"obvious\"  sources  relied  on  by  accountants  in  ascertaining\n\ndamages),  subject of course  to Chesterton's right  to probe the\n\npremises  of the opinion on  cross-examination.  But  that is not\n\nthe question presented.   Rather, the issue on appeal  is whether\n\nthe district court abused  its considerable discretion by exclud-\n\ning the evidence.  We think not.\n\n          Rules  703 and  705 normally  relieve the  proponent of\n\nexpert testimony from engaging in the awkward art of hypothetical\n\nquestioning, which  involves the  somewhat meticulous, and  often\n\ntedious, process  of laying  a full  factual foundation prior  to\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\nprocedure preferable to the alternatives, which were (1) to allow\nthe evidence in on direct, then exclude it later if it were found\nwholly unreliable, or  (2) to permit  Chesterton to shoulder  the\nburden of testing the reliability of Osborne's methods  on cross-\nexamination, leaving the  ultimate weight of the evidence  to the\njury.\n\n                                45\n\nasking  the expert  to state  an  opinion.   In the  interests of\n\nefficiency, the Federal Rules  of Evidence deliberately shift the\n\nburden  to the  cross-examiner to  ferret out  whatever empirical\n\ndeficiencies may lurk in the expert opinion.  Nevertheless, Rules\n\n703 and 705 do not afford automatic entitlements to proponents of\n\nexpert  testimony.   Rule 703  requires the  trial court  to give\n\n\"careful consideration\" to any  inadmissible facts upon which the\n\nexpert will  rely,  in order  to  determine whether  reliance  is\n\n\"reasonable.\" Id. at  545.  Similarly, under  the broad exception\n                 \n\nto Rule 705  (\"unless the court  otherwise requires\"), the  trial\n\ncourt  is given  considerable latitude  over the  order in  which\n\nevidence will  be presented to the  jury.  See Fed.  R. Evid. 705\n                                              \n\nadvisory  committee's note  (\"[S]afeguards [to  minimize 'unfair'\n\nburden  on cross-examiner]  are reinforced  by  the discretionary\n\npower  of the  judge  to require  preliminary  disclosure in  any\n                                                                 \n\nevent.\") (emphasis added).  While the trial court's discretion is\n     \n\nnot unfettered, at a minimum the rules suggest that the proponent\n\nmust  be prepared,  if the court  so requires, to  make a limited\n\noffer of proof to aid the court in its assessment.  Cf. Ambrosini\n                                                                 \n\nv. Labarraque, 966  F.2d 1464,  1469 (D.C.

Apparently,  URI came  to  trial with  no supporting\n\ndocumentation  whatever to  substantiate Osborne's  assessment of\n\ndamages.  Based on what can be gleaned from Osborne's preliminary\n\ntestimony,  URI's apparent  unpreparedness and  recalcitrance may\n\nhave  given the  district  court real  concerns  as to  Osborne's\n\nmethodology.   Unlike the  expert witness in  International Adhe-\n                                                                 \n\nsive, Osborne's \"damages\" assessment was  not based solely on the\n    \n\nconventional examination and compilation of documents from  which\n\nan expert  objectively might  ascertain the overtime  labor costs\n\nincurred in  repairing Endeavor's ballast tanks, as distinguished\n\nfrom  various other projects at URI and the GSO.  Rather, Osborne\n\nrelied on  \"interviews\" with undisclosed URI  employees and \"out-\n\nside vendors,\" conducted either by himself or other URI officials\n\nwho reported to him.   The trial court quite  reasonably expected\n\nURI  to explain,  out  of the  presence of  the  jury, the  basic\n\nassumptions  undergirding  its  witness's   seemingly  unorthodox\n\nmethod of reconstruction.\n\n          Rather than provide an explanation, however, URI simply\n\naccepted a directed verdict  on the issue of damages.   Moreover,\n\nwhen pressed  by the district court, URI indicated no inclination\n\nto  pursue a claim  for nominal damages.

First,  it\ncontends that the district court abused its discretion by denying\nits motion to file a second amended complaint in November 1991   \neighteen months after  the filing of its  original complaint, and\nfollowing jury  impanelment     since URI asserted  valid reasons\nfor its lack of  diligence.  See Quaker State Oil  Refining Corp.\n                                                                 \nv. Garrity  Oil Co., 884  F.2d 1510,  1517 (1st  Cir. 1989)  (due\n                   \ndiligence  required for amendments).   As far as  we can discern,\nthe  amendment's only significant  factual supplementation to the\noriginal complaint would allege that Chesterton's representatives\n\"came aboard the Research vessel Endeavor while the Chesterton 1-\n2-3 System was actually being applied and said  nothing as to its\nnot being  equal to the task of painting the ballast tanks.\"  The\namended complaint  generally shifted  the focus of  URI's allega-\ntions  from Chesterton's  defective manufacture  of a  product to\nChesterton's negligence in recommending an ill-suited product, or\nits failure to  give adequate or  continuing instructions on  its\nuse.  Chesterton suffered no prejudice, however, as most of these\nnew factual matters  were in  fact \"tried by  express or  implied\n                                  \nconsent of the parties,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b).  In any event, as\nthe substance  of the proposed amendments was wholly unrelated to\nthe  issue of  damages, amendment  would have  been futile.   See\n                                                                 \nArzuaga-Collazo  v. Oriental Fed. Sav.  Bank, 913 F.2d  5, 7 (1st\n                                            \nCir.  1990) (amendment futile if there  is no \"meaningful indica-\ntion\"  that  amendment  would  make  a  \"dispositive difference\")\n(citing  The Dartmouth Review v.  Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13,\n                                                   \n\n                                48\n\nAbsent competent evidence of damages, the district court properly\n\ngranted judgment as  a matter  of law in  favor of Chesterton  on\n\nURI's breach of warranty claims.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                  - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n                    \n\n22-23 (1st Cir. 1989)). \n     Similarly, URI  contends that the  district court improperly\ndirected  a verdict for Chesterton on Count III of the complaint,\nwhich  alleged Chesterton's breach of a warranty of fitness for a\nparticular purpose.  URI  merely argues that it presented  suffi-\ncient evidence  to establish that  Chesterton had reason  to know\nthat URI intended to use the product on salt water ballast tanks,\nand that  URI specifically  relied on Chesterton's  assurances of\nsuitability.  Once again, however, absent proof of damages, URI's\nargument is to no avail.\n\n                                49\n\n          HORNBY, District Judge, concurring.  It takes the court\n          HORNBY, District Judge, concurring.  \n                                            \n\n38 typed pages (8-1/2 x  11\") of closely reasoned text to  decide\n\nwhether the University of Rhode Island is a citizen -- a determi-\n\nnation that  has nothing  to do  with the  substance of  the real\n\nworld dispute between these parties, but simply resolves where to\n\ntry  their lawsuit.  Is this approach really essential for deter-\n\nmining  whether a federal  court has jurisdiction?   Granted that\n\nour system limits the jurisdiction  of federal courts, a rational\n\nobserver might nevertheless  expect simple gatekeeping rules  for\n\nwhat gets in and what is kept out.   A litigant should be able to\n\nascertain, with relatively modest effort and legal fees, where to\n\nbring its  lawsuit.   But if  the court's  analysis of a  \"myriad\n\nfactors\" --  which are \"by  no means exhaustive\" -- is  to be the\n\ngoverning standard,  future litigants in cases  involving similar\n\nstate agencies had better be prepared to pay a lot  of legal fees\n\nfor  their lawyers to  (1) read and digest  the prose; (2) gather\n\nthe relevant  information and apply  the legal analysis  to their\n\nclient or  opponent; (3) litigate  the issues at  pretrial, trial\n\nand on  appeal.  Those litigants had  also better be prepared for\n\ndelays in decisionmaking as lawyers and judges ponder  the issue:\n\nthe  \"myriad factors\" will seldom yield a certain outcome until a\n\ncourt actually decides the issue.\n\n          To  be sure, this court  is not alone  in adopting this\n\napproach.   Other courts have also applied a multitude of factors\n\n(with no  particular weight assigned), in  determining the status\n\n                                50\n\nof a particular state agency.  See, e.g., Hughes-Bechtol, Inc. v.\n                                                                 \n\nWest  Virginia Bd. of Regents,  737 F.2d 540,  543-44 (6th Cir.),\n                             \n\ncert.  denied, 469 U.S. 1018 (1984) (looking at several factors);\n             \n\nKrieger  v.

As the  commentaries recognize, \"[t]here is no\n\nunanimity among  the decisions  as to  whether state  agencies or\n\ndepartments  are  citizens  within  the meaning  of  28  U.S.C.S.\n\n  1332, with some  decisions holding that  they are while  others\n\nhold that they are  not.\"  1 Federal  Proc. L. Ed.   1:200.   The\n\nensuing  extensive litigation  over jurisdiction  has undoubtedly\n\ncaused  substantial delay  and consumed  thousands of  dollars in\n\nattorney fees where  the real  goal should have  been speedy  and\n\ninexpensive resolution of the merits of the underlying dispute.\n\n          The  question is  whether  United States  Supreme Court\n\nprecedents  really require such a complex analysis.  I think not.\n\nI will  concede  that  this  court's approach  is  one  plausible\n\nreading of the precedents, but there is another plausible reading\n\nthat  keeps  the  subject  matter jurisdiction  issue  in  proper\n\nperspective as only a preliminary issue in the underlying econom-\n\nic dispute between the parties.\n\n                                51\n\n          As the  court recognizes, a couple  of propositions are\n\nbeyond  debate,  given  United States  Supreme  Court  decisions.\n\nFirst, a  State  cannot be  a  citizen of  itself: \"There  is  no\n\nquestion  that a  State is  not a `citizen'  for purposes  of the\n\ndiversity  jurisdiction.\"  Moor  v. County  of Alameda,  411 U.S.\n                                                      \n\n693, 717  (1973). Second, incorporated branches  of state govern-\n\nment (for example, cities and counties) are citizens of the state\n                                           \n\nof their incorporation.  See Cowles  v. Mercer County, 74 U.S. (7\n                                                     \n\nWall.) 118, 122 (1869).   This resulting principle of independent\n\ncitizenship for a public corporation had become so \"well settled\"\n\nby 1972 that the Supreme Court no  longer stopped to question it.\n\nSee Moor, 411 U.S. at 718, quoting Illinois v. City of Milwaukee,\n                                                                \n\n406 U.S. 91, 97 (1972).\n\n          Here, the  Rhode Island  Board of Higher  Education1 is\n\nseparately incorporated with the  power to sue and be  sued.  The\n\ndiversity statute  provides: \"[A]  corporation shall be  deemed a\n\ncitizen of any state  by which it has been  incorporated . . . .\"\n\n28 U.S.C.   1332(c).  What more need be said to conclude that the\n\nRhode  Island Board  is a  citizen for  diversity purposes?   The\n\ncourt apparently  believes that its lengthy  and complex analysis\n\nis required  by Moor.  But  in Moor the Supreme  Court spent only\n                                   \n\none paragraph  summarizing California  statutes to  conclude that\n\nthe county was a corporation with important powers independent of\n\nthe state and a second paragraph summarizing a California Supreme\n\n                    \n\n     1I  agree with the court that there is no legal entity under\nRhode Island law known as the University of Rhode Island.\n\n                                52\n\nCourt decision  finding California  counties to  be corporations.\n\nBased on those two summary paragraphs, the Supreme Court conclud-\n\ned  that \"the  county  has a  sufficiently independent  corporate\n\ncharacter  to dictate that it be treated as a citizen of Califor-\n\nnia under our  decision in Cowles v. Mercer County,  supra.\"  411\n                                                          \n\nU.S. at 721.\n\n     A parallel short treatment  of Rhode Island law  can dispose\n\nof the jurisdictional issue in this case.  The Board that governs\n\nthe University of  Rhode Island is a  \"public corporation, empow-\n\nered to sue  and be sued  in its  own name, to  have a  corporate\n\nseal,  and to  exercise  all the  powers,  in addition  to  those\n\nhereinafter  specifically  enumerated,  usually  appertaining  to\n\npublic  corporations entrusted  with  control  of  post-secondary\n\neducational institutions and functions.\"  R.I. General Laws   16-\n                                                           \n\n59-1-(a) (1992).   Under Rhode Island law, a \"public corporation\"\n\nis \"a corporate entity which is  considered a governmental agency\n\nbut which  has a distinct  legal existence from the  state or any\n\nmunicipality, [and] does not constitute  a department of state or\n\nmunicipal government . . . .\"  Id. 22-10-2(f).  The Board has the\n                                 \n\ncorporate power to acquire, hold, and dispose of real and person-\n\nal property (albeit in  trust for the state).   Id.   16-59-1(b).\n                                                  \n\nThe Board is entitled to levy tuition and other fees  in order to\n\nobtain funds to carry  out its activities.

Id.   16-59-4, 8.   This summary paints a\n                          \n\npicture of  a \"sufficiently independent corporate  character\"  to\n\nmatch that  of the California county  at issue in Moor.   No more\n                                                      \n\nshould  be necessary.2  I therefore concur in the court's evalua-\n\ntion that jurisdiction exists, but not in the prolonged reasoning\n\nby which it reaches that conclusion.\n\n          I add one postscript:   The careful reader will observe\n\nthat neither I nor the court have articulated any  jurisdictional\n\npolicy  arguments in  determining the  citizenship of  the Board.\n\nThe policy  interests behind  the court's myriad  factor approach\n\nare borrowed -- I believe  ill-advisedly -- from Eleventh  Amend-\n\nment cases where the primary  goal is to protect the state  trea-\n\nsury.   Perhaps  the  court's complex  analysis and  case-by-case\n\napproach  are  justified there.   The  policy goals  in diversity\n\njurisdiction  analysis are  somewhat different,  involving avail-\n\nability of  an unbiased  forum.   The Supreme Court  has not  ad-\n\n                    \n\n     2Since the  Board is a public corporation, it seems unneces-\nsary to pursue  the \"arm or  alter ego\" alternative set  forth in\n                                      \nState Highway Comm'n  of Wyoming  v. Utah Constr.  Co., 278  U.S.\n                                                      \n194,  199 (1929).    There, a  lawsuit  was brought  against  the\nWyoming State Highway Commission (an unincorporated state agency)\nand its individual members, premised on diversity of citizenship.\nThe Supreme  Court found  no diversity jurisdiction.   Primarily,\nthe Court determined  that the  suit was not  really against  the\nHighway  Commission  but against  the  State  of Wyoming  itself,\nbecause it  was the State that  was actually a party  to the con-\ntract  in dispute  and  neither the  Commission  nor any  of  its\nmembers had assumed any responsibility.   The sentence most often\nquoted (and referred to in Moor) states:  \"The Commission was but\n                               \nthe arm  or alter ego  of the State with  no funds or  ability to\n                     \nrespond in damages.\"  278 U.S. at 199.\n\n                                54\n\ndressed them in its analysis of what is a citizen  and neither do\n\nI.   In any event,  such interests  can best be  served by  clear\n\nrules  for the generality of cases; every single piece of litiga-\n\ntion  need not require a  return to first  principles.  Probably,\n\nthe major policy interest at stake  lies in how the conclusion is\n                                               \n\nreached.   Simplicity from the courts of appeals (and the Supreme\n\nCourt)  on these  gatekeeping and  procedural issues  will permit\n\nlawyers and  judges -- and  most importantly,  the  parties -- to\n\ndeal  with the  merits of disputes  in a  simple and  less costly\n\nmanner.   Needlessly complex jurisdictional rules  like those the\n\ncourt  advances here can only  perplex the litigants  as they pay\n\nmounting  attorney fees  and  suffer through  procedural  delays.\n\nCongress has ordered district courts to pay heed to such concerns\n\nin  the Civil Justice Reform  Act of 1990,  28 U.S.C.    471-482.\n\nAppellate courts  can make that task easier by resisting unneces-\n\nsary subtleties and  focusing instead on  rules that ensure  pre-\n\ndictability and certainty, as well as fairness.\n\n          In all other respects, I join the court's opinion.\n\n                                55\n",

The R/V Endeavor is a  vessel chartered by the\n\nNational Science Foundation to  URI's Graduate School of Oceanog-\n\nraphy  (GSO) for research purposes.   In the summer of 1985, John\n\nMetz, the GSO's port  engineer, discovered serious rust corrosion\n\non  the inside of the  Endeavor's steel ballast  tanks, which are\n\nsubmerged in  salt water during  normal operation of  the vessel.\n\nResponding  to  a  Chesterton advertisement,  Metz  received test\n\nsamples of  \"Rust Transformer,\"  a Chesterton product  which pur-\n\nportedly converts surface corrosion  into a rust-inhibitor, which\n\nin turn serves  as a base for further coats  of paint.  Satisfied\n\nwith  the  test-sample  results,  Metz  invited Chesterton  sales\n\nrepresentatives  aboard  the  Endeavor.    After  inspecting  the\n\n                                2\n\nEndeavor's ballast tank  corrosion, Chesterton's  representatives\n\nrecommended that  Metz use Chesterton's 1-2-3  System (using Rust\n\nTransformer,  a primer, and a final  enamel coat) to rehabilitate\n\nthe  tanks.   Metz  ordered the  1-2-3  System on  September  11,\n\n1985.1   Six months after URI completed the 1-2-3 System applica-\n\ntion, the  new coating on  the ballast tanks began  to loosen and\n\nflake  off.    URI allegedly  expended  $100,000  to correct  the\n\nproblem.\n\n          URI  brought suit  against Chesterton  in Rhode  Island\n\nstate  court  on   May 4,  1989,   alleging  negligence,   strict\n\nliability,  and  breaches  of  an express  warranty  and  implied\n\nwarranties  of  merchantability  and  fitness  for  a  particular\n\npurpose.    Chesterton promptly  removed  the  action to  federal\n\ndistrict court.   URI moved for remand on the ground that URI, as\n\nan \"alter  ego, arm, or agent\"  of the State of  Rhode Island, is\n\nnot  a \"citizen\"  of Rhode  Island for  diversity purposes.   The\n\ndistrict court denied URI's  remand motion without an evidentiary\n\nhearing,  relying  on an  earlier  district  court decision,  see\n                                                                 \n\nVanlaarhoven v.

On the other hand, the product's written instruc-\ntions advised  that the system  was not recommended  for surfaces\nregularly  immersed in sea water.   In an  amended complaint, URI\nalleged that  Chesterton  representatives observed  the URI  crew\napplying  the 1-2-3 System to the ballast tanks, but said nothing\nto URI representatives  about the unsuitability of the  system or\nits improper application.\n\n                                3\n\n          This  court declined  to entertain  URI's interlocutory\n\nappeal  from the  jurisdictional  ruling  but noted  disagreement\n\namong  the circuits as to the proper criteria for determining the\n\ncitizenship  of state  universities for  diversity purposes.   We\n\nrecommended that the district court conduct \"limited factfinding\"\n\non remand relating to several factors pertinent to URI's citizen-\n\nship,  including  (1)  \"the degree  of  URI's  dependence on  and\n\nfunctional integration  with the  state treasury,\" (2)  \"the per-\n\ncentage of URI's annual budget that derives from state appropria-\n\ntions,\"  and (3)  \"whether the legislature  bases levels  of such\n\nappropriations  in part  on the  amount of  nonappropriated funds\n\navailable to URI.\"2   On remand, the district court  denied URI's\n\nmotion  for  a pretrial  evidentiary  hearing  relating to  these\n\njurisdictional  matters.   The  jury trial  began on  December 3,\n\n1991.  After the  district court excluded the testimony  of URI's\n\nonly expert witness on the issue of contract damages, URI abrupt-\n\nly  rested its case.  Judgment  was entered for Chesterton on all\n\ncounts, as  a matter of law,  pursuant to Fed. R.  Civ. P. 50(a),\n\nand URI appealed.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n     2As  an alternate  and independent  reason for  declining to\nentertain  the interlocutory  appeal, this  court noted  that the\nlitigation  was unlikely to be so protracted as to warrant appel-\nlate   interruption, given the nature and scope of URI's contract\nclaims.\n\n                                4\n\nA.   Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n                                \n\n          URI urges us to  set aside the judgment and  remand the\n\ncase  to state court on  the ground that  Chesterton, a Massachu-\n\nsetts corporation,  has not established diversity.   URI contends\n\nthat it  is not a  Rhode Island  \"citizen,\" but a  mere \"arm\"  or\n\n\"alter ego\" of the  State.  See  Gibbs v.

Often,  tax policy  is used  by\n\nStates to  encourage certain  types of  activity even though  the\n\ntarget  entities  are  otherwise  entirely  independent  of state\n\ngovernment.  Rhode Island is no exception in this  respect.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  R.I. Gen.

On the other hand, the level of State  fiscal monitoring\n                                     \n\nof  the Board is comparatively unintrusive.   For example, though\n\nURI's  treasurer  must  submit  financial reports  to  the  state\n\ncontroller for  \"preaudit,\" the purely \"ministerial\"  audit moni-\n\ntors Board  expenditures only for possible  illegality and avail-\n\nability of funds, not with a view to the prudence  of the Board's\n\nfinancial decisions.  R.I. Gen. Laws   16-59-20.  See Kovats, 822\n                                                            \n\n                                27\n\nF.2d at 1311 (mere \"reporting\" of spending decisions not  indica-\n\ntive  of lack of  autonomy).  URI  makes a rather  wan attempt to\n\nundermine Vanlaarhoven by citing a  subsequently enacted \"limita-\n                      \n\ntion\" on the Board's purchasing power.  See R.I. Gen. Laws    37-\n                                           \n\n2-1  and 37-2-7(11) (Board's  purchases can be  made only through\n\nState Purchasing agent's office).   As the district court  found,\n\nhowever, nothing in this  statutory requirement portends  quality\n\nreview or rejection  of purchase orders by the  purchasing agent.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   16-59-20  (\"controller [shall not] interpose his\n\nor  her judgment\").   See supra  note 7.   Far  from a meaningful\n                               \n\nlimitation  on the  Board's  power to  disburse  its funds,  this\n\nmeasure  appears to have been designed solely to enable the Board\n\nto  avail itself of the  financial savings associated with pooled\n\npurchasing power.\n\n          With Moor as our benchmark, therefore, we conclude that\n                   \n\nthe Rhode  Island statutory  scheme demonstrates that  the Board,\n\nunlike more \"typical\"  state educational entities, possesses  the\n\nessential attributes of operational and financial autonomy needed\n\nto qualify as a Rhode Island \"citizen\" for diversity purposes.\n\n          b.  \"Functional Integration\"\n                                     \n\n          In a  resourceful  effort to  avoid  Vanlaarhoven,  URI\n                                                           \n\nurges its  \"functional integration\" theory,  whose genesis appar-\n\nently lay  in our earlier \"recommendation\" to  the district court\n\nfollowing dismissal of URI's interlocutory  appeal.  See supra p.\n                                                              \n\n4.  URI argues, for example, that the Board's ostensible indepen-\n\ndence  in financial matters would prove illusory if, in fact, (1)\n\n                                28\n\nthe  Board's  annual  budget were  funded  by  State-appropriated\n\nmonies to such  an extent that its  nonappropriated revenues were\n\nrendered  functionally  insignificant, or  (2)  the  Rhode Island\n\ngeneral assembly  were to  employ its statutory  pre-audit proce-\n\ndures to attune the  Board's annual State appropriation so  as to\n\nforce the  Board to expend its anticipated and accumulated nonap-\n\npropriated revenues in lieu  of a more ample annual  State appro-\n\npriation.  See,  e.g., Krieger, 765 F. Supp. at  761 (evidence of\n                              \n\nactual control by State would trump evidence of formal autonomy).\n\n          We emphasize that URI does not assert the existence  of\n                                                             \n\nbudgetary data which would demonstrate that the Board enjoys less\n\nfinancial autonomy  than the  enabling statute indicates.   More-\n\nover, notwithstanding its efforts  to persuade the district court\n\nto conduct a separate  evidentiary hearing on diversity jurisdic-\n\ntion, URI has taken no initiative to substantiate its \"functional\n\nintegration\"  theory, either  by  way of  an evidentiary  proffer\n\nbelow,  or even by way of  the barest allusion to supportive data\n\nin its  brief or oral argument  before this court.   Instead, URI\n\ninsists  that Chesterton,  as the  party requesting  removal, see\n                                                                 \n\nsupra Section II.A,  was required  to bear the  entire burden  of\n                                                      \n\nproof and production on every conceivable fact     even including\n\n\"negative\" facts     which  might prove  relevant to the  Board's\n                                       \n\ncitizenship  status.  Thus, even  after trial on  the merits, URI\n\nspeculates that  there may  be evidence  which  would preclude  a\n\nreliable determination as to federal diversity jurisdiction.  For\n\nthe  reasons  hereinafter  explained,  we  think  URI inadvisably\n\n                                29\n\nbanked on a cramped view of the proper allocation of the  burdens\n\nof  proof and  production relating  to the  jurisdictional issue,\n\nmisapprehended the proper role of  \"functional integration\" data,\n\nand exaggerated the import of our earlier \"recommendation\" to the\n\ndistrict court for further factfinding on remand.\n\n          For some  reason, our  earlier invitation to  engage in\n\nadditional factfinding  on remand  went unheeded.   URI intimates\n\nthat it did  all it  could by requesting  a separate  evidentiary\n                                                    \n\nhearing,  and  that  the  district court  simply  discounted  our\n\nrecommendation  as  to  the  possible  relevance  of  \"functional\n\nintegration\"  evidence.   In  our view,  however, URI  mischarac-\n\nterizes the remand order.  While we suggested the desirability of\n\nsupplementary factfinding, the  precise factfinding procedure  to\n                                                             \n\nbe employed always rests within the sound discretion of the trial\n\ncourt.

At no  time did  we require  a\n\nseparate  evidentiary   hearing  on  the   jurisdictional  issue.\n        \n\nIndeed, given our alternative  ground for dismissing URI's inter-\n\nlocutory appeal    namely, that it appeared unlikely that a trial\n\non the merits would be prolonged    the district court's decision\n\nto defer its jurisdictional determination until trial was entire-\n\nly consistent with the remand order.\n\n                                30\n\n          Nor did the district court prevent URI from introducing\n                                            \n\nany such statistical evidence at  trial.  Following an unrecorded\n\npretrial  conference with  counsel, the  district court  did deny\n\nURI's motion for a separate evidentiary hearing.  In that connec-\n\ntion,  URI has provided  no indication  of the  legal contentions\n\nadvanced by either party  at the pretrial conference, nor  of the\n\ngrounds for the  district court's decision  to bypass a  pretrial\n\nevidentiary hearing.  Chesterton, on the other hand, asserts that\n\nthe conference  involved an extended discussion  about the appro-\n\npriateness  of a  separate pretrial hearing,  but that  the court\n\nopted to permit the presentation of evidence on the jurisdiction-\n\nal issue at trial.\n                 \n\n          Viewed  in  proper procedural  context,  therefore, the\n\npresent claim hinges entirely  on URI's unremitting allocation of\n\nthe burdens of persuasion  and production to Chesterton, and  not\n\non  any lack of opportunity  to raise or  substantiate its \"func-\n\ntional integration\" claim.   Significantly, our remand order took\n\nno position  as to which party  would be obliged  to come forward\n                        \n\nwith evidence of functional integration, nor did it suggest  that\n\nproof of  lack of  functional integration  was required  in every\n\ncase.  \n\n          Of  course,  Chesterton, the  party  invoking diversity\n\njurisdiction, bears  the ultimate burden of  proving diversity of\n                                 \n\ncitizenship.

First,  \"functional\n\nintegration\"  may  obtain  if  the State  nonetheless  bears  the\n\nultimate  legal responsibility to  answer for debts  on which the\n        \n\nstate university defaults.  Thus, the very financial independence\n\naccorded  the  Board  under  the Rhode  Island  enabling  statute\n\nultimately might expose  the State treasury to liability  for the\n\nBoard's  financial obligations.  In Kovats, 822 F.2d at 1309, the\n                                          \n\nThird Circuit flatly rejected such a functional integration claim\n\nwhere the  legislature's decision to answer  for the university's\n\ndebts  appeared to be purely discretionary  and not legally bind-\n\ning.   Cf. also Fitchik, 873 F.2d  at 661 (the State's disclaimer\n                       \n\nof  any obligation to  \"cover\" is the  primary consideration, not\n\nthe relative size (50-70%)  of the state appropriation); but  cf.\n                                                                 \n\nHall, 742 F.2d  at 304-05 (no  statute prohibits university  from\n    \n\nincurring debt in state's name, and fact that state  will have to\n                              \n\n\"cover\" debt by law  is indicative of \"alter ego\"  status); Krie-\n                                                                 \n\nger, 765 F.

First, an  incorporated entity dependent  entirely on\n                                                              \n\nState appropriations rarely (if ever) would escape  characteriza-\n\ntion as the  State's \"alter ego,\"  since the hand that  holds all\n                                                                 \n\nthe purse strings presumably controls the dependent entity.

See, e.g., Mount Healthy, 429 U.S. at 280-\n                                               \n\n81  (noting  only \"significant  amount  of  money\" received  from\n                              \n\nState)  (emphasis added);  Moor, 411  U.S. at  719-20 (discussing\n                               \n\ncounty's  ability to  raise  its own  funds,  not whether  county\n\nreceived any funds from State); see also Metcalf &amp; Eddy,     F.2d\n                                        \n\nat      [No. 91-1602, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. App. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">10064</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 15 (1st Cir.\n\nMay  3, 1993)].    Unsurprisingly, as  the divergent  conclusions\n\nreached  on essentially  similar \"statistical\"  evidence suggest,\n\nsee supra pp. 37-38,  a closely calibrated\" statistical\" approach\n         \n\nin these cases entails its own impediments to  reliable decision-\n\nmaking; namely, at  what levels should  the absolute or  relative\n\nsize  of an entity's  appropriated funding be  considered so sub-\n\nstantial, or  its nonappropriated funding so  insubstantial, that\n\n\"functional integration\" is to  be presumed, or a  previous judi-\n\ncial determination  of the  entity's citizenship set  aside?   We\n\nbelieve a wide margin  of variance would need to  be demonstrated\n\nbefore it could  be found to  have effected a  sea change in  the\n\nentity's jurisdictional status.   After all, while not immutable,\n\nthe  citizenship  of a  public  corporation,  like its  domicile,\n\nshould be  accorded a  reasonable measure  of permanence; at  the\n\nvery  least, ordinary  fluctuations  in  the university's  budget\n\nought not occasion continual  judicial reevaluation.  Thus, trial\n\ncourt rulings  on subject matter jurisdiction  normally ought not\n\nawait  budgetary  data  and  oscillations  absent  an evidentiary\n\n                                40\n\nproffer of sufficient import to alter a determination based on an\n\nanalysis of state  statutory and  decisional law.   In our  view,\n\nthis  approach best  comports with  the analysis  contemplated in\n\nMoor. \n    \n\n          In considering whether Chesterton carried its burden of\n\npersuasion on the  issue of  financial autonomy, we  think it  is\n\ninescapable that the Board's nonappropriated revenues represent a\n\nsubstantial budget component; tuition, housing, dining and admin-\n\nistrative  fees, donations,  bequests,  federal  grants, and  the\n\nproceeds from discretionary sales and leases of URI property  are\n\nnot  insubstantial  revenue sources.    Thus,  on its  face,  the\n\nenabling statute demonstrates Board  access to, and control over,\n\nsubstantial amounts  of nonappropriated  revenues.   Following  a\n\ntrial on the merits, and  absent any indication that URI did  not\n\nhave  a  fair opportunity  to  identify  and produce  statistical\n\nevidence which  might rebut  Chesterton's demonstration  that the\n\nenabling  statute  confers the  requisite  financial  autonomy to\n\nqualify the  Board for citizenship  under Moor, we  conclude that\n                                              \n\nURI's appellate challenge comes too late.\n\n          Finally, in a similar vein,  URI suggests that it might\n                                                                 \n\nbe  that the State routinely attunes  its annual appropriation to\n\nthe  Board in  response to  the total  amount  of nonappropriated\n\nfunds available to the Board, including the nonappropriated funds\n\naccumulated from  prior fiscal years and those anticipated in the\n\ncurrent  fiscal  year.   Under this  \"linkage\" theory,  the State\n\ncould  compel the Board to expend all accumulated and anticipated\n                                 \n\n                                41\n\nnonappropriated funds  merely by  limiting its  annual appropria-\n\ntions to the  difference between the Board's  fiscal year revenue\n\nrequirements and the total available nonappropriated funds.\n\n          URI's contention  that the State might  link its appro-\n\npriations to  the availability of nonappropriated  Board funds is\n\npure  conjecture.    Arrayed  against URI's  conjecture  are  the\n\nexplicit provisions of the enabling statute,  as amended in 1988,\n\nwhich expressly  state that all nonappropriated  funds, including\n\naccumulated  nonappropriated  funds, are  to  be  deposited in  a\n\nsegregated account under the exclusive control of the Board.  See\n                                                                 \n\nKovats,  822 F.2d at 1308-09 (mere possibility of offset by state\n      \n\nappropriations not  especially probative of  \"alter ego\" status).\n\nAppropriated  funds, on the other hand, are  to be set apart in a\n\nseparate account, and all unexpended balances in the appropriated\n                                                                 \n\nfunds account are to  be redeposited to the general  fund.

This\n\nseparate  treatment of  appropriated  and nonappropriated  funds,\n\ndeliberately mandated  by the  general assembly, would  have been\n\nboth superfluous and  contraindicated had routine  \"linkage\" been\n\nintended.

Evidence of Damages\n                        \n\n          In  a ruling  that  proved fatal  to  URI's claims  for\n\ndamages for breach of warranties, the district court excluded the\n\ntestimony of URI's longtime  controller, Ronald Osborne, a certi-\n\nfied public accountant in charge of all URI financial information\n\nand  accounting practices.    URI  called  Osborne as  an  expert\n\nwitness to establish  the amount of money it spent to correct the\n\ncorrosion problem allegedly left unremedied by Chesterton's 1-2-3\n\nSystem.  URI  proffered no  other evidence on  damages.   Osborne\n\ntestified on direct examination  that he previously had performed\n\ncost assessments  on various  URI projects,  and  that his  usual\n\nprocedure  was  to  consult  URI financial  records  and  conduct\n\ninterviews with URI personnel involved in the particular project.\n\nHe consulted GSO  records to ascertain the  overtime hours worked\n\nin 1985, and conducted several interviews with URI employees  and\n\nvarious \"private vendors\" to  ascertain which overtime hours were\n\nattributable to  the correction of Endeavor's  corrosion problem.\n\nTo these figures he added the  cost of fringe benefits (22%)  for\n\n                                43\n\novertime  employees,  and  \"indirect costs,\"  at  an  unspecified\n\npercentage rate,  which included  expenses for  \"accounting, pur-\n\nchasing,  maintenance,  [and] utilities.\"   Before  Osborne could\n\nstate an opinion concerning  the total monetary damages sustained\n\nby URI, Chesterton objected  on the grounds that (1)  Osborne was\n\nnot a  qualified expert on  damages calculation, (2)  the factual\n\nbases for his calculation  included inadmissible hearsay, and (3)\n\nthe damages  calculation included inappropriate factors,  such as\n\n\"indirect costs.\"\n\n          URI  relied on Federal Rules of Evidence 703 and 705 as\n\ngrounds  for the admission of Osborne's expert opinion.  Rule 703\n\nprovides that \"[t]he  facts or  data . . . upon  which an  expert\n\nbases an opinion or inference . . . [,] [i]f of a type reasonably\n\nrelied upon by experts  in the particular field in  forming opin-\n\nions or inferences upon the subject, . . . need not be admissible\n\nin evidence.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 703.  Rule 705  provides that \"[t]he\n\nexpert  may testify  in terms  of opinion  or inference  and give\n\nreasons therefor without prior disclosure of the underlying facts\n\nor data, unless the court requires  otherwise.  The expert may in\n                                             \n\nany event be required to disclose the underlying facts or data on\n\ncross-examination.\"   Fed. R. Evid.  705 (emphasis  added).   The\n\ncourt sustained Chesterton's objection on the ground that URI had\n\nnot demonstrated that the  facts relied on  by Osborne were of  a\n\ntype reasonably relied on by experts in damages assessment.19\n\n                    \n\n     19The court  also expressed a firm  preference for requiring\npreliminary  disclosure of  the factual  \"background\" for  an ex-\npert's opinion on  direct examination.  The court considered this\n\n                                44\n\n          URI's central  arguments on  appeal are: (1)  Rules 703\n\nand 705 afford the right to present unsubstantiated expert testi-\n                        \n\nmony on  direct examination without first  disclosing its factual\n\nunderpinnings, and  (2) the district court  abused its discretion\n\nby adhering to its self-imposed rule  of exclusion, a per se rule\n                                                            \n\nwhich, according  to URI, runs  counter to the  \"burden shifting\"\n\nimplicit in Rule 705  and disregards the obligation  to predicate\n\nits exclusionary ruling on the particular circumstances.\n\n          We have no doubt  that Rules 703 and 705  permitted the\n                                                             \n\ndistrict  court  to   admit  Osborne's  opinion  testimony,   see\n                                                                 \n\nInternational Adhesive  Coating Co. v.

But  that is not\n\nthe question presented.   Rather, the issue on appeal  is whether\n\nthe district court abused  its considerable discretion by exclud-\n\ning the evidence.  We think not.\n\n          Rules  703 and  705 normally  relieve the  proponent of\n\nexpert testimony from engaging in the awkward art of hypothetical\n\nquestioning, which  involves the  somewhat meticulous, and  often\n\ntedious, process  of laying  a full  factual foundation prior  to\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\nprocedure preferable to the alternatives, which were (1) to allow\nthe evidence in on direct, then exclude it later if it were found\nwholly unreliable, or  (2) to permit  Chesterton to shoulder  the\nburden of testing the reliability of Osborne's methods  on cross-\nexamination, leaving the  ultimate weight of the evidence  to the\njury.\n\n                                45\n\nasking  the expert  to state  an  opinion.   In the  interests of\n\nefficiency, the Federal Rules  of Evidence deliberately shift the\n\nburden  to the  cross-examiner to  ferret out  whatever empirical\n\ndeficiencies may lurk in the expert opinion.  Nevertheless, Rules\n\n703 and 705 do not afford automatic entitlements to proponents of\n\nexpert  testimony.   Rule 703  requires the  trial court  to give\n\n\"careful consideration\" to any  inadmissible facts upon which the\n\nexpert will  rely,  in order  to  determine whether  reliance  is\n\n\"reasonable.\" Id. at  545.  Similarly, under  the broad exception\n                 \n\nto Rule 705  (\"unless the court  otherwise requires\"), the  trial\n\ncourt  is given  considerable latitude  over the  order in  which\n\nevidence will  be presented to the  jury.  See Fed.  R.

Apparently,  URI came  to  trial with  no supporting\n\ndocumentation  whatever to  substantiate Osborne's  assessment of\n\ndamages.  Based on what can be gleaned from Osborne's preliminary\n\ntestimony,  URI's apparent  unpreparedness and  recalcitrance may\n\nhave  given the  district  court real  concerns  as to  Osborne's\n\nmethodology.

Is this approach really essential for deter-\n\nmining  whether a federal  court has jurisdiction?   Granted that\n\nour system limits the jurisdiction  of federal courts, a rational\n\nobserver might nevertheless  expect simple gatekeeping rules  for\n\nwhat gets in and what is kept out.   A litigant should be able to\n\nascertain, with relatively modest effort and legal fees, where to\n\nbring its  lawsuit.   But if  the court's  analysis of a  \"myriad\n\nfactors\" --  which are \"by  no means exhaustive\" -- is  to be the\n\ngoverning standard,  future litigants in cases  involving similar\n\nstate agencies had better be prepared to pay a lot  of legal fees\n\nfor  their lawyers to  (1) read and digest  the prose; (2) gather\n\nthe relevant  information and apply  the legal analysis  to their\n\nclient or  opponent; (3) litigate  the issues at  pretrial, trial\n\nand on  appeal.  Those litigants had  also better be prepared for\n\ndelays in decisionmaking as lawyers and judges ponder  the issue:\n\nthe  \"myriad factors\" will seldom yield a certain outcome until a\n\ncourt actually decides the issue.\n\n          To  be sure, this court  is not alone  in adopting this\n\napproach.

The\n\ndiversity statute  provides: \"[A]  corporation shall be  deemed a\n\ncitizen of any state  by which it has been  incorporated . . . .\"\n\n28 U.S.C.   1332(c).  What more need be said to conclude that the\n\nRhode  Island Board  is a  citizen for  diversity purposes?   The\n\ncourt apparently  believes that its lengthy  and complex analysis\n\nis required  by Moor.  But  in Moor the Supreme  Court spent only\n                                   \n\none paragraph  summarizing California  statutes to  conclude that\n\nthe county was a corporation with important powers independent of\n\nthe state and a second paragraph summarizing a California Supreme\n\n                    \n\n     1I  agree with the court that there is no legal entity under\nRhode Island law known as the University of Rhode Island.\n\n                                52\n\nCourt decision  finding California  counties to  be corporations.\n\nBased on those two summary paragraphs, the Supreme Court conclud-\n\ned  that \"the  county  has a  sufficiently independent  corporate\n\ncharacter  to dictate that it be treated as a citizen of Califor-\n\nnia under our  decision in Cowles v.

The Board that governs\n\nthe University of  Rhode Island is a  \"public corporation, empow-\n\nered to sue  and be sued  in its  own name, to  have a  corporate\n\nseal,  and to  exercise  all the  powers,  in addition  to  those\n\nhereinafter  specifically  enumerated,  usually  appertaining  to\n\npublic  corporations entrusted  with  control  of  post-secondary\n\neducational institutions and functions.\"  R.I.

Under Rhode Island law, a \"public corporation\"\n\nis \"a corporate entity which is  considered a governmental agency\n\nbut which  has a distinct  legal existence from the  state or any\n\nmunicipality, [and] does not constitute  a department of state or\n\nmunicipal government . . . .\"  Id. 22-10-2(f).  The Board has the\n                                 \n\ncorporate power to acquire, hold, and dispose of real and person-\n\nal property (albeit in  trust for the state).

Id.   16-59-4, 8.   This summary paints a\n                          \n\npicture of  a \"sufficiently independent corporate  character\"  to\n\nmatch that  of the California county  at issue in Moor.

Perhaps  the  court's complex  analysis and  case-by-case\n\napproach  are  justified there.   The  policy goals  in diversity\n\njurisdiction  analysis are  somewhat different,  involving avail-\n\nability of  an unbiased  forum.

There, a  lawsuit  was brought  against  the\nWyoming State Highway Commission (an unincorporated state agency)\nand its individual members, premised on diversity of citizenship.\nThe Supreme  Court found  no diversity jurisdiction.   Primarily,\nthe Court determined  that the  suit was not  really against  the\nHighway  Commission  but against  the  State  of Wyoming  itself,\nbecause it  was the State that  was actually a party  to the con-\ntract  in dispute  and  neither the  Commission  nor any  of  its\nmembers had assumed any responsibility.   The sentence most often\nquoted (and referred to in Moor) states:  \"The Commission was but\n                               \nthe arm  or alter ego  of the State with  no funds or  ability to\n                     \nrespond in damages.\"  278 U.S. at 199.\n\n                                54\n\ndressed them in its analysis of what is a citizen  and neither do\n\nI.   In any event,  such interests  can best be  served by  clear\n\nrules  for the generality of cases; every single piece of litiga-\n\ntion  need not require a  return to first  principles.  Probably,\n\nthe major policy interest at stake  lies in how the conclusion is\n                                               \n\nreached.   Simplicity from the courts of appeals (and the Supreme\n\nCourt)  on these  gatekeeping and  procedural issues  will permit\n\nlawyers and  judges -- and  most importantly,  the  parties -- to\n\ndeal  with the  merits of disputes  in a  simple and  less costly\n\nmanner.   Needlessly complex jurisdictional rules  like those the\n\ncourt  advances here can only  perplex the litigants  as they pay\n\nmounting  attorney fees  and  suffer through  procedural  delays.\n\nCongress has ordered district courts to pay heed to such concerns\n\nin  the Civil Justice Reform  Act of 1990,  28 U.S.C.    471-482.\n\nAppellate courts  can make that task easier by resisting unneces-\n\nsary subtleties and  focusing instead on  rules that ensure  pre-\n\ndictability and certainty, as well as fairness.\n\n          In all other respects, I join the court's opinion.\n\n                                55\n</pre>",
