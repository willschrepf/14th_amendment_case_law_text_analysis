Argued January 21, 2015—Decided June 25, 2015\nThe Federal Government provides low-income housing tax credits that\n  are distributed to developers by designated state agencies. In Texas,\n  the Department of Housing and Community Affairs (Department)\n  distributes the credits. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.\n  (ICP), a Texas-based nonprofit corporation that assists low-income\n  families in obtaining affordable housing, brought a disparate-impact\n  claim under §§804(a) and 805(a) of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), al-\n  leging that the Department and its officers had caused continued\n  segregated housing patterns by allocating too many tax credits to\n  housing in predominantly black inner-city areas and too few in pre-\n  dominantly white suburban neighborhoods. Relying on statistical ev-\n  idence, the District Court concluded that the ICP had established a\n  prima facie showing of disparate impact. After assuming the De-\n  partment’s proffered non-discriminatory interests were valid, it found\n  that the Department failed to meet its burden to show that there\n  were no less discriminatory alternatives for allocating the tax credits.\n  While the Department’s appeal was pending, the Secretary of Hous-\n  ing and Urban Development issued a regulation interpreting the\n  FHA to encompass disparate-impact liability and establishing a bur-\n  den-shifting framework for adjudicating such claims. The Fifth Cir-\n  cuit held that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the FHA,\n  but reversed and remanded on the merits, concluding that, in light of\n  the new regulation, the District Court had improperly required the\n  Department to prove less discriminatory alternatives.\n    The FHA was adopted shortly after the assassination of Dr. Martin\n  Luther King, Jr. Recognizing that persistent racial segregation had\n\f2     TEXAS DEPT.

Pp. 7–24.\n    (a) Two antidiscrimination statutes that preceded the FHA are rel-\n evant to its interpretation. Both §703(a)(2) of Title VII of the Civil\n Rights Act of 1964 and §4(a)(2) of the Age Discrimination in Em-\n ployment Act of 1967 (ADEA) authorize disparate-impact claims.\n Under Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, and Smith v. City of\n Jackson, 544 U. S. 228, the cases announcing the rule for Title VII\n and for the ADEA, respectively, antidiscrimination laws should be\n construed to encompass disparate-impact claims when their text re-\n fers to the consequences of actions and not just to the mindset of ac-\n tors, and where that interpretation is consistent with statutory pur-\n pose. Disparate-impact liability must be limited so employers and\n other regulated entities are able to make the practical business\n choices and profit-related decisions that sustain the free-enterprise\n system. Before rejecting a business justification—or a governmental\n entity’s analogous public interest—a court must determine that a\n plaintiff has shown that there is “an available alternative . . . practice\n that has less disparate impact and serves the [entity’s] legitimate\n needs.” Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U. S. 557, 578. These cases provide\n essential background and instruction in the case at issue. Pp. 7–10.\n    (b) Under the FHA it is unlawful to “refuse to sell or rent . . . or\n otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to a person because\n of race” or other protected characteristic, §804(a), or “to discriminate\n against any person in” making certain real-estate transactions “be-\n cause of race” or other protected characteristic, §805(a). The logic of\n Griggs and Smith provides strong support for the conclusion that the\n FHA encompasses disparate-impact claims. The results-oriented\n phrase “otherwise make unavailable” refers to the consequences of an\n action rather than the actor’s intent. See United States v. Giles, 300\n U. S. 41, 48. And this phrase is equivalent in function and purpose to\n Title VII’s and the ADEA’s “otherwise adversely affect” language. In\n all three statutes the operative text looks to results and plays an\n identical role: as a catchall phrase, located at the end of a lengthy\n sentence that begins with prohibitions on disparate treatment. The\n introductory word “otherwise” also signals a shift in emphasis from\n an actor’s intent to the consequences of his actions. This similarity in\n text and structure is even more compelling because Congress passed\n the FHA only four years after Title VII and four months after the\n\f                   Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nADEA. Although the FHA does not reiterate Title VII’s exact lan-\nguage, Congress chose words that serve the same purpose and bear\nthe same basic meaning but are consistent with the FHA’s structure\nand objectives. The FHA contains the phrase “because of race,” but\nTitle VII and the ADEA also contain that wording and this Court\nnonetheless held that those statutes impose disparate-impact liabil-\nity.\n   The 1988 amendments signal that Congress ratified such liability.\nCongress knew that all nine Courts of Appeals to have addressed the\nquestion had concluded the FHA encompassed disparate-impact\nclaims, and three exemptions from liability in the 1988 amendments\nwould have been superfluous had Congress assumed that disparate-\nimpact liability did not exist under the FHA.\n   Recognition of disparate-impact claims is also consistent with the\ncentral purpose of the FHA, which, like Title VII and the ADEA, was\nenacted to eradicate discriminatory practices within a sector of the\nNation’s economy. Suits targeting unlawful zoning laws and other\nhousing restrictions that unfairly exclude minorities from certain\nneighborhoods without sufficient justification are at the heartland of\ndisparate-impact liability.     See, e.g., Huntington v. Huntington\nBranch, NAACP, 488 U. S. 15, 16–18. Recognition of disparate-\nimpact liability under the FHA plays an important role in uncovering\ndiscriminatory intent: it permits plaintiffs to counteract unconscious\nprejudices and disguised animus that escape easy classification as\ndisparate treatment.\n   But disparate-impact liability has always been properly limited in\nkey respects to avoid serious constitutional questions that might\narise under the FHA, e.g., if such liability were imposed based solely\non a showing of a statistical disparity. Here, the underlying dispute\ninvolves a novel theory of liability that may, on remand, be seen\nsimply as an attempt to second-guess which of two reasonable ap-\nproaches a housing authority should follow in allocating tax credits\nfor low-income housing. An important and appropriate means of en-\nsuring that disparate-impact liability is properly limited is to give\nhousing authorities and private developers leeway to state and ex-\nplain the valid interest their policies serve, an analysis that is analo-\ngous to Title VII’s business necessity standard. It would be paradoxi-\ncal to construe the FHA to impose onerous costs on actors who\nencourage revitalizing dilapidated housing in the Nation’s cities\nmerely because some other priority might seem preferable. A dispar-\nate-impact claim relying on a statistical disparity must fail if the\nplaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy or policies causing that\ndisparity. A robust causality requirement is important in ensuring\nthat defendants do not resort to the use of racial quotas. Courts must\n\f4   TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n          INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n  therefore examine with care whether a plaintiff has made out a pri-\n  ma facie showing of disparate impact, and prompt resolution of these\n  cases is important. Policies, whether governmental or private, are\n  not contrary to the disparate-impact requirement unless they are “ar-\n  tificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers.” Griggs, 401 U. S., at\n  431. Courts should avoid interpreting disparate-impact liability to be\n  so expansive as to inject racial considerations into every housing de-\n  cision. These limitations are also necessary to protect defendants\n  against abusive disparate-impact claims.\n     And when courts do find liability under a disparate-impact theory,\n  their remedial orders must be consistent with the Constitution. Re-\n  medial orders in disparate-impact cases should concentrate on the\n  elimination of the offending practice, and courts should strive to de-\n  sign race-neutral remedies. Remedial orders that impose racial tar-\n  gets or quotas might raise difficult constitutional questions.\n     While the automatic or pervasive injection of race into public and\n  private transactions covered by the FHA has special dangers, race\n  may be considered in certain circumstances and in a proper fashion.\n  This Court does not impugn local housing authorities’ race-neutral ef-\n  forts to encourage revitalization of communities that have long suf-\n  fered the harsh consequences of segregated housing patterns. These\n  authorities may choose to foster diversity and combat racial isolation\n  with race-neutral tools, and mere awareness of race in attempting to\n  solve the problems facing inner cities does not doom that endeavor at\n  the outset.

This dispute\ncomes to the Court on a disparate-impact theory of liabil-\nity. In contrast to a disparate-treatment case, where a\n“plaintiff must establish that the defendant had a discrim-\ninatory intent or motive,” a plaintiff bringing a disparate-\nimpact claim challenges practices that have a “dispropor-\ntionately adverse effect on minorities” and are otherwise\nunjustified by a legitimate rationale. Ricci v. DeStefano,\n557 U. S. 557, 577 (2009) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). The question presented for the Court’s determina-\ntion is whether disparate-impact claims are cognizable\nunder the Fair Housing Act (or FHA), 82 Stat. 81, as\namended, 42 U. S. C. §3601 et seq.\n                            I\n                            A\n  Before turning to the question presented, it is necessary\n\f2   TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n          INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto discuss a different federal statute that gives rise to this\ndispute. The Federal Government provides low-income\nhousing tax credits that are distributed to developers\nthrough designated state agencies. 26 U. S. C. §42. Con-\ngress has directed States to develop plans identifying\nselection criteria for distributing the credits. §42(m)(1).\nThose plans must include certain criteria, such as public\nhousing waiting lists, §42(m)(1)(C), as well as certain\npreferences, including that low-income housing units\n“contribut[e] to a concerted community revitalization plan”\nand be built in census tracts populated predominantly by\nlow-income residents. §§42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III), 42(d)(5)(ii)(I).\nFederal law thus favors the distribution of these tax cred-\nits for the development of housing units in low-income\nareas.\n   In the State of Texas these federal credits are distrib-\nuted by the Texas Department of Housing and Community\nAffairs (Department). Under Texas law, a developer’s\napplication for the tax credits is scored under a point\nsystem that gives priority to statutory criteria, such as the\nfinancial feasibility of the development project and the\nincome level of tenants.          Tex. Govt. Code Ann.\n§§2306.6710(a)–(b) (West 2008). The Texas Attorney\nGeneral has interpreted state law to permit the considera-\ntion of additional criteria, such as whether the housing\nunits will be built in a neighborhood with good schools.\nThose criteria cannot be awarded more points than statu-\ntorily mandated criteria. Tex. Op. Atty. Gen. No. GA–\n0208, pp. 2–6 (2004), 2004 WL 1434796, *4–*6.\n   The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (ICP), is a\nTexas-based nonprofit corporation that assists low-income\nfamilies in obtaining affordable housing. In 2008, the ICP\nbrought this suit against the Department and its officers\nin the United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of Texas. As relevant here, it brought a disparate-\nimpact claim under §§804(a) and 805(a) of the FHA. The\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nICP alleged the Department has caused continued segre-\ngated housing patterns by its disproportionate allocation\nof the tax credits, granting too many credits for housing in\npredominantly black inner-city areas and too few in pre-\ndominantly white suburban neighborhoods. The ICP\ncontended that the Department must modify its selection\ncriteria in order to encourage the construction of low-\nincome housing in suburban communities.\n   The District Court concluded that the ICP had estab-\nlished a prima facie case of disparate impact. It relied on\ntwo pieces of statistical evidence. First, it found “from\n1999–2008, [the Department] approved tax credits for\n49.7% of proposed non-elderly units in 0% to 9.9% Cauca-\nsian areas, but only approved 37.4% of proposed non-\nelderly units in 90% to 100% Caucasian areas.” 749\nF. Supp. 2d 486, 499 (ND Tex. 2010) (footnote omitted).\nSecond, it found “92.29% of [low-income housing tax credit]\nunits in the city of Dallas were located in census tracts\nwith less than 50% Caucasian residents.” Ibid.\n   The District Court then placed the burden on the De-\npartment to rebut the ICP’s prima facie showing of dis-\nparate impact. 860 F. Supp. 2d 312, 322–323 (2012).\nAfter assuming the Department’s proffered interests were\nlegitimate, id., at 326, the District Court held that a de-\nfendant—here the Department—must prove “that there\nare no other less discriminatory alternatives to advancing\ntheir proffered interests,” ibid. Because, in its view, the\nDepartment “failed to meet [its] burden of proving that\nthere are no less discriminatory alternatives,” the District\nCourt ruled for the ICP. Id., at 331.\n   The District Court’s remedial order required the addi-\ntion of new selection criteria for the tax credits. For in-\nstance, it awarded points for units built in neighborhoods\nwith good schools and disqualified sites that are located\nadjacent to or near hazardous conditions, such as high\ncrime areas or landfills. See 2012 WL 3201401 (Aug. 7,\n\f4   TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n          INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n2012). The remedial order contained no explicit racial\ntargets or quotas.\n   While the Department’s appeal was pending, the Secre-\ntary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a\nregulation interpreting the FHA to encompass disparate-\nimpact liability. See Implementation of the Fair Housing\nAct’s Discriminatory Effects Standard, 78 Fed. Reg. 11460\n(2013). The regulation also established a burden-shifting\nframework for adjudicating disparate-impact claims.\nUnder the regulation, a plaintiff first must make a prima\nfacie showing of disparate impact. That is, the plaintiff\n“has the burden of proving that a challenged practice\ncaused or predictably will cause a discriminatory effect.”\n24 CFR §100.500(c)(1) (2014). If a statistical discrepancy\nis caused by factors other than the defendant’s policy, a\nplaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case, and there is\nno liability. After a plaintiff does establish a prima facie\nshowing of disparate impact, the burden shifts to the\ndefendant to “prov[e] that the challenged practice is neces-\nsary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory interests.” §100.500(c)(2). HUD has clari-\nfied that this step of the analysis “is analogous to the Title\nVII requirement that an employer’s interest in an em-\nployment practice with a disparate impact be job related.”\n78 Fed. Reg. 11470. Once a defendant has satisfied its\nburden at step two, a plaintiff may “prevail upon proving\nthat the substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory inter-\nests supporting the challenged practice could be served by\nanother practice that has a less discriminatory effect.”\n§100.500(c)(3).\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held, con-\nsistent with its precedent, that disparate-impact claims\nare cognizable under the FHA. 747 F. 3d 275, 280 (2014).\nOn the merits, however, the Court of Appeals reversed and\nremanded. Relying on HUD’s regulation, the Court of\nAppeals held that it was improper for the District Court to\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Id., at 282–283. In a concur-\nring opinion, Judge Jones stated that on remand the\nDistrict Court should reexamine whether the ICP had\nmade out a prima facie case of disparate impact. She\nsuggested the District Court incorrectly relied on bare\nstatistical evidence without engaging in any analysis\nabout causation. She further observed that, if the fed-\neral law providing for the distribution of low-income hous-\ning tax credits ties the Department’s hands to such an\nextent that it lacks a meaningful choice, then there is no\ndisparate-impact liability. See id., at 283–284 (specially\nconcurring opinion).\n   The Department filed a petition for a writ of certiorari\non the question whether disparate-impact claims are\ncognizable under the FHA. The question was one of first\nimpression, see Huntington v. Huntington Branch,\nNAACP, 488 U. S. 15 (1988) (per curiam), and certiorari\nfollowed, 573 U. S. ___ (2014). It is now appropriate to\nprovide a brief history of the FHA’s enactment and its\nlater amendment.\n                              B\n   De jure residential segregation by race was declared\nunconstitutional almost a century ago, Buchanan v. War-\nley, 245 U. S. 60 (1917), but its vestiges remain today,\nintertwined with the country’s economic and social life.\nSome segregated housing patterns can be traced to condi-\ntions that arose in the mid-20th century. Rapid urbaniza-\ntion, concomitant with the rise of suburban developments\naccessible by car, led many white families to leave the\ninner cities. This often left minority families concentrated\nin the center of the Nation’s cities. During this time,\nvarious practices were followed, sometimes with govern-\nmental support, to encourage and maintain the separation\n\f6   TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n          INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nof the races: Racially restrictive covenants prevented the\nconveyance of property to minorities, see Shelley v. Krae-\nmer, 334 U. S. 1 (1948); steering by real-estate agents led\npotential buyers to consider homes in racially homogenous\nareas; and discriminatory lending practices, often referred\nto as redlining, precluded minority families from purchas-\ning homes in affluent areas. See, e.g., M. Klarman, Unfin-\nished Business: Racial Equality in American History 140–\n141 (2007); Brief for Housing Scholars as Amici Curiae\n22–23. By the 1960’s, these policies, practices, and preju-\ndices had created many predominantly black inner cities\nsurrounded by mostly white suburbs. See K. Clark, Dark\nGhetto: Dilemmas of Social Power 11, 21–26 (1965).\n   The mid-1960’s was a period of considerable social un-\nrest; and, in response, President Lyndon Johnson estab-\nlished the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disor-\nders, commonly known as the Kerner Commission. Exec.\nOrder No. 11365, 3 CFR 674 (1966–1970 Comp.). After\nextensive factfinding the Commission identified residen-\ntial segregation and unequal housing and economic condi-\ntions in the inner cities as significant, underlying causes of\nthe social unrest. See Report of the National Advisory\nCommission on Civil Disorders 91 (1968) (Kerner Com-\nmission Report). The Commission found that “[n]early\ntwo-thirds of all nonwhite families living in the central\ncities today live in neighborhoods marked by substandard\nhousing and general urban blight.” Id., at 13. The Com-\nmission further found that both open and covert racial\ndiscrimination prevented black families from obtaining\nbetter housing and moving to integrated communities.\nIbid. The Commission concluded that “[o]ur Nation is\nmoving toward two societies, one black, one white—\nseparate and unequal.” Id., at 1. To reverse “[t]his deep-\nening racial division,” ibid., it recommended enactment of\n“a comprehensive and enforceable open-occupancy law\nmaking it an offense to discriminate in the sale or rental of\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U.

The\nstatute addressed the denial of housing opportunities on\nthe basis of “race, color, religion, or national origin.” Civil\nRights Act of 1968, §804, 82 Stat. 83. Then, in 1988,\nCongress amended the FHA. Among other provisions, it\ncreated certain exemptions from liability and added “fa-\nmilial status” as a protected characteristic. See Fair\nHousing Amendments Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 1619.\n                             II\n   The issue here is whether, under a proper interpretation\nof the FHA, housing decisions with a disparate impact are\nprohibited. Before turning to the FHA, however, it is\nnecessary to consider two other antidiscrimination stat-\nutes that preceded it.\n   The first relevant statute is §703(a) of Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 255. The Court ad-\ndressed the concept of disparate impact under this statute\nin Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971). There,\nthe employer had a policy requiring its manual laborers to\npossess a high school diploma and to obtain satisfactory\nscores on two intelligence tests. The Court of Appeals held\nthe employer had not adopted these job requirements for a\nracially discriminatory purpose, and the plaintiffs did not\nchallenge that holding in this Court. Instead, the plain-\ntiffs argued §703(a)(2) covers the discriminatory effect of a\npractice as well as the motivation behind the practice.\nSection 703(a), as amended, provides as follows:\n      “It shall be an unlawful employer practice for an\n    employer—\n\f8   TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n          INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n       “(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any indi-\n    vidual, or otherwise to discriminate against any indi-\n    vidual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-\n    tions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n    individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\n    origin; or\n       “(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or\n    applicants for employment in any way which would\n    deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employ-\n    ment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his\n    status as an employee, because of such individual’s\n    race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42\n    U. S. C. §2000e–2(a).\nThe Court did not quote or cite the full statute, but rather\nrelied solely on §703(a)(2). Griggs, 401 U. S., at 426, n. 1.\n  In interpreting §703(a)(2), the Court reasoned that\ndisparate-impact liability furthered the purpose and de-\nsign of the statute.       The Court explained that, in\n§703(a)(2), Congress “proscribe[d] not only overt discrimi-\nnation but also practices that are fair in form, but discrim-\ninatory in operation.” Id., at 431. For that reason, as the\nCourt noted, “Congress directed the thrust of [§703(a)(2)]\nto the consequences of employment practices, not simply\nthe motivation.” Id., at 432. In light of the statute’s goal\nof achieving “equality of employment opportunities and\nremov[ing] barriers that have operated in the past” to\nfavor some races over others, the Court held §703(a)(2) of\nTitle VII must be interpreted to allow disparate-impact\nclaims. Id., at 429–430.\n  The Court put important limits on its holding: namely,\nnot all employment practices causing a disparate impact\nimpose liability under §703(a)(2). In this respect, the\nCourt held that “business necessity” constitutes a defense\nto disparate-impact claims. Id., at 431. This rule pro-\nvides, for example, that in a disparate-impact case,\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§703(a)(2) does not prohibit hiring criteria with a “mani-\nfest relationship” to job performance. Id., at 432; see also\nRicci, 557 U. S., at 587–589 (emphasizing the importance\nof the business necessity defense to disparate-impact\nliability). On the facts before it, the Court in Griggs found\na violation of Title VII because the employer could not\nestablish that high school diplomas and general intelli-\ngence tests were related to the job performance of its\nmanual laborers. See 401 U. S., at 431–432.\n   The second relevant statute that bears on the proper\ninterpretation of the FHA is the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602 et seq., as\namended. Section 4(a) of the ADEA provides:\n    “It shall be unlawful for an employer—\n       “(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any indi-\n    vidual or otherwise discriminate against any individ-\n    ual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-\n    tions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n    individual’s age;\n       “(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in\n    any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n    individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n    adversely affect his status as an employee, because of\n    such individual’s age; or\n       “(3) to reduce the wage rate of any employee in or-\n    der to comply with this chapter.” 29 U. S. C. §623(a).\nThe Court first addressed whether this provision allows\ndisparate-impact claims in Smith v. City of Jackson, 544\nU. S. 228 (2005). There, a group of older employees chal-\nlenged their employer’s decision to give proportionately\ngreater raises to employees with less than five years of\nexperience.\n   Explaining that Griggs “represented the better reading\nof [Title VII’s] statutory text,” 544 U. S., at 235, a plurality\nof the Court concluded that the same reasoning pertained\n\f10 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto §4(a)(2) of the ADEA. The Smith plurality emphasized\nthat both §703(a)(2) of Title VII and §4(a)(2) of the ADEA\ncontain language “prohibit[ing] such actions that ‘deprive\nany individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of such\nindividual’s’ race or age.” 544 U. S., at 235. As the plural-\nity observed, the text of these provisions “focuses on the\neffects of the action on the employee rather than the moti-\nvation for the action of the employer” and therefore com-\npels recognition of disparate-impact liability. Id., at 236.\nIn a separate opinion, JUSTICE SCALIA found the ADEA’s\ntext ambiguous and thus deferred under Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837 (1984), to an Equal Employment Opportunity Com-\nmission regulation interpreting the ADEA to impose\ndisparate-impact liability, see 544 U. S., at 243–247 (opin-\nion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n   Together, Griggs holds and the plurality in Smith in-\nstructs that antidiscrimination laws must be construed to\nencompass disparate-impact claims when their text refers\nto the consequences of actions and not just to the mindset\nof actors, and where that interpretation is consistent with\nstatutory purpose. These cases also teach that disparate-\nimpact liability must be limited so employers and other\nregulated entities are able to make the practical business\nchoices and profit-related decisions that sustain a vibrant\nand dynamic free-enterprise system. And before rejecting\na business justification—or, in the case of a governmental\nentity, an analogous public interest—a court must deter-\nmine that a plaintiff has shown that there is “an available\nalternative . . . practice that has less disparate impact and\nserves the [entity’s] legitimate needs.” Ricci, supra, at\n578. The cases interpreting Title VII and the ADEA pro-\nvide essential background and instruction in the case now\nbefore the Court.\n   Turning to the FHA, the ICP relies on two provisions.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSection 804(a) provides that it shall be unlawful:\n       “To refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona\n    fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or\n    rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a\n    dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion,\n    sex, familial status, or national origin.” 42 U. S. C.\n    §3604(a).\nHere, the phrase “otherwise make unavailable” is of cen-\ntral importance to the analysis that follows.\n  Section 805(a), in turn, provides:\n      “It shall be unlawful for any person or other entity\n    whose business includes engaging in real estate-\n    related transactions to discriminate against any per-\n    son in making available such a transaction, or in the\n    terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of\n    race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or\n    national origin.” §3605(a).\n   Applied here, the logic of Griggs and Smith provides\nstrong support for the conclusion that the FHA encom-\npasses disparate-impact claims. Congress’ use of the\nphrase “otherwise make unavailable” refers to the conse-\nquences of an action rather than the actor’s intent. See\nUnited States v. Giles, 300 U. S. 41, 48 (1937) (explaining\nthat the “word ‘make’ has many meanings, among them\n‘[t]o cause to exist, appear or occur’ ” (quoting Webster’s\nNew International Dictionary 1485 (2d ed. 1934))). This\nresults-oriented language counsels in favor of recognizing\ndisparate-impact liability. See Smith, supra, at 236. The\nCourt has construed statutory language similar to §805(a)\nto include disparate-impact liability. See, e.g., Board of\nEd. of City School Dist. of New York v. Harris, 444 U. S.\n130, 140–141 (1979) (holding the term “discriminat[e]”\nencompassed disparate-impact liability in the context of a\nstatute’s text, history, purpose, and structure).\n\f12 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   A comparison to the antidiscrimination statutes exam-\nined in Griggs and Smith is useful. Title VII’s and the\nADEA’s “otherwise adversely affect” language is equiva-\nlent in function and purpose to the FHA’s “otherwise make\nunavailable” language. In these three statutes the opera-\ntive text looks to results. The relevant statutory phrases,\nmoreover, play an identical role in the structure common\nto all three statutes: Located at the end of lengthy sen-\ntences that begin with prohibitions on disparate treat-\nment, they serve as catchall phrases looking to conse-\nquences, not intent. And all three statutes use the word\n“otherwise” to introduce the results-oriented phrase.\n“Otherwise” means “in a different way or manner,” thus\nsignaling a shift in emphasis from an actor’s intent to the\nconsequences of his actions. Webster’s Third New Inter-\nnational Dictionary 1598 (1971). This similarity in text\nand structure is all the more compelling given that Con-\ngress passed the FHA in 1968—only four years after pass-\ning Title VII and only four months after enacting the\nADEA.\n   It is true that Congress did not reiterate Title VII’s\nexact language in the FHA, but that is because to do so\nwould have made the relevant sentence awkward and\nunclear. A provision making it unlawful to “refuse to\nsell[,] . . . or otherwise [adversely affect], a dwelling to any\nperson” because of a protected trait would be grammatically\nobtuse, difficult to interpret, and far more expansive in\nscope than Congress likely intended. Congress thus chose\nwords that serve the same purpose and bear the same\nbasic meaning but are consistent with the structure and\nobjectives of the FHA.\n   Emphasizing that the FHA uses the phrase “because of\nrace,” the Department argues this language forecloses\ndisparate-impact liability since “[a]n action is not taken\n‘because of race’ unless race is a reason for the action.”\nBrief for Petitioners 26. Griggs and Smith, however,\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndispose of this argument. Both Title VII and the ADEA\ncontain identical “because of ” language, see 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e–2(a)(2); 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(2), and the Court\nnonetheless held those statutes impose disparate-impact\nliability.\n   In addition, it is of crucial importance that the existence\nof disparate-impact liability is supported by amendments\nto the FHA that Congress enacted in 1988. By that time,\nall nine Courts of Appeals to have addressed the question\nhad concluded the Fair Housing Act encompassed disparate-\nimpact claims.        See Huntington Branch, NAACP v.\nHuntington, 844 F. 2d 926, 935–936 (CA2 1988); Resident\nAdvisory Bd. v. Rizzo, 564 F. 2d 126, 146 (CA3 1977);\nSmith v. Clarkton, 682 F. 2d 1055, 1065 (CA4 1982); Han-\nson v. Veterans Administration, 800 F. 2d 1381, 1386 (CA5\n1986); Arthur v. Toledo, 782 F. 2d 565, 574–575 (CA6\n1986); Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Arling-\nton Heights, 558 F. 2d 1283, 1290 (CA7 1977); United\nStates v. Black Jack, 508 F. 2d 1179, 1184–1185 (CA8\n1974); Halet v. Wend Investment Co., 672 F. 2d 1305, 1311\n(CA9 1982); United States v. Marengo Cty. Comm’n, 731\nF. 2d 1546, 1559, n. 20 (CA11 1984).\n   When it amended the FHA, Congress was aware of this\nunanimous precedent. And with that understanding, it\nmade a considered judgment to retain the relevant statu-\ntory text. See H. R. Rep. No. 100–711, p. 21, n. 52 (1988)\n(H. R. Rep.) (discussing suits premised on disparate-\nimpact claims and related judicial precedent); 134 Cong.\nRec. 23711 (1988) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (noting\nunanimity of Federal Courts of Appeals concerning dis-\nparate impact); Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1987:\nHearings on S. 558 before the Subcommittee on the Con-\nstitution of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 100th\nCong., 1st Sess., 529 (1987) (testimony of Professor Robert\nSchwemm) (describing consensus judicial view that the\nFHA imposed disparate-impact liability). Indeed, Con-\n\f14 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ngress rejected a proposed amendment that would have\neliminated disparate-impact liability for certain zoning\ndecisions. See H. R. Rep., at 89–93.\n   Against this background understanding in the legal and\nregulatory system, Congress’ decision in 1988 to amend\nthe FHA while still adhering to the operative language in\n§§804(a) and 805(a) is convincing support for the conclu-\nsion that Congress accepted and ratified the unanimous\nholdings of the Courts of Appeals finding disparate-impact\nliability. “If a word or phrase has been . . . given a uni-\nform interpretation by inferior courts . . . , a later version\nof that act perpetuating the wording is presumed to carry\nforward that interpretation.” A. Scalia & B. Garner,\nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 322\n(2012); see also Forest Grove School Dist. v. T. A., 557 U. S.\n230, 244, n. 11 (2009) (“When Congress amended [the Act]\nwithout altering the text of [the relevant provision], it\nimplicitly adopted [this Court’s] construction of the stat-\nute”); Manhattan Properties, Inc. v. Irving Trust Co., 291\nU. S. 320, 336 (1934) (explaining, where the Courts of\nAppeals had reached a consensus interpretation of the\nBankruptcy Act and Congress had amended the Act with-\nout changing the relevant provision, “[t]his is persua-\nsive that the construction adopted by the [lower federal]\ncourts has been acceptable to the legislative arm of the\ngovernment”).\n   Further and convincing confirmation of Congress’ un-\nderstanding that disparate-impact liability exists under\nthe FHA is revealed by the substance of the 1988 amend-\nments. The amendments included three exemptions from\nliability that assume the existence of disparate-impact\nclaims. The most logical conclusion is that the three\namendments were deemed necessary because Congress\npresupposed disparate impact under the FHA as it had\nbeen enacted in 1968.\n   The relevant 1988 amendments were as follows. First,\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCongress added a clarifying provision: “Nothing in [the\nFHA] prohibits a person engaged in the business of fur-\nnishing appraisals of real property to take into considera-\ntion factors other than race, color, religion, national origin,\nsex, handicap, or familial status.” 42 U. S. C. §3605(c).\nSecond, Congress provided: “Nothing in [the FHA] prohib-\nits conduct against a person because such person has been\nconvicted by any court of competent jurisdiction of the\nillegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled sub-\nstance.” §3607(b)(4). And finally, Congress specified:\n“Nothing in [the FHA] limits the applicability of any rea-\nsonable . . . restrictions regarding the maximum number\nof occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.” §3607(b)(1).\n   The exemptions embodied in these amendments would\nbe superfluous if Congress had assumed that disparate-\nimpact liability did not exist under the FHA. See Gus-\ntafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 574 (1995) (“[T]he\nCourt will avoid a reading which renders some words\naltogether redundant”). Indeed, none of these amend-\nments would make sense if the FHA encompassed only\ndisparate-treatment claims. If that were the sole ground\nfor liability, the amendments merely restate black-letter\nlaw. If an actor makes a decision based on reasons other\nthan a protected category, there is no disparate-treatment\nliability. See, e.g., Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v.\nBurdine, 450 U. S. 248, 254 (1981). But the amendments\ndo constrain disparate-impact liability. For instance,\ncertain criminal convictions are correlated with sex and\nrace. See, e.g., Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85,\n98 (2007) (discussing the racial disparity in convictions for\ncrack cocaine offenses). By adding an exemption from\nliability for exclusionary practices aimed at individuals\nwith drug convictions, Congress ensured disparate-impact\nliability would not lie if a landlord excluded tenants with\nsuch convictions. The same is true of the provision allow-\ning for reasonable restrictions on occupancy. And the\n\f16 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nexemption from liability for real-estate appraisers is in the\nsame section as §805(a)’s prohibition of discriminatory\npractices in real-estate transactions, thus indicating Con-\ngress’ recognition that disparate-impact liability arose\nunder §805(a). In short, the 1988 amendments signal that\nCongress ratified disparate-impact liability.\n  A comparison to Smith’s discussion of the ADEA further\ndemonstrates why the Department’s interpretation would\nrender the 1988 amendments superfluous. Under the\nADEA’s reasonable-factor-other-than-age (RFOA) provi-\nsion, an employer is permitted to take an otherwise pro-\nhibited action where “the differentiation is based on rea-\nsonable factors other than age.” 29 U. S. C. §623(f )(1). In\nother words, if an employer makes a decision based on a\nreasonable factor other than age, it cannot be said to have\nmade a decision on the basis of an employee’s age. Accord-\ning to the Smith plurality, the RFOA provision “plays its\nprincipal role” “in cases involving disparate-impact claims”\n“by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attribut-\nable to a nonage factor that was ‘reasonable.’ ” 544 U. S.,\nat 239. The plurality thus reasoned that the RFOA provi-\nsion would be “simply unnecessary to avoid liability under\nthe ADEA” if liability were limited to disparate-treatment\nclaims. Id., at 238.\n  A similar logic applies here. If a real-estate appraiser\ntook into account a neighborhood’s schools, one could not\nsay the appraiser acted because of race. And by embed-\nding 42 U. S. C. §3605(c)’s exemption in the statutory text,\nCongress ensured that disparate-impact liability would\nnot be allowed either. Indeed, the inference of disparate-\nimpact liability is even stronger here than it was in Smith.\nAs originally enacted, the ADEA included the RFOA pro-\nvision, see §4(f)(1), 81 Stat. 603, whereas here Congress\nadded the relevant exemptions in the 1988 amendments\nagainst the backdrop of the uniform view of the Courts of\nAppeals that the FHA imposed disparate-impact liability.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Recognition of disparate-impact claims is consistent\nwith the FHA’s central purpose. See Smith, supra, at 235\n(plurality opinion); Griggs, 401 U. S., at 432. The FHA,\nlike Title VII and the ADEA, was enacted to eradicate\ndiscriminatory practices within a sector of our Nation’s\neconomy. See 42 U. S. C. §3601 (“It is the policy of the\nUnited States to provide, within constitutional limitations,\nfor fair housing throughout the United States”); H. R.\nRep., at 15 (explaining the FHA “provides a clear national\npolicy against discrimination in housing”).\n   These unlawful practices include zoning laws and other\nhousing restrictions that function unfairly to exclude\nminorities from certain neighborhoods without any suffi-\ncient justification. Suits targeting such practices reside at\nthe heartland of disparate-impact liability. See, e.g.,\nHuntington, 488 U. S., at 16–18 (invalidating zoning law\npreventing construction of multifamily rental units); Black\nJack, 508 F. 2d, at 1182–1188 (invalidating ordinance\nprohibiting construction of new multifamily dwellings);\nGreater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center v. St.\nBernard Parish, 641 F. Supp. 2d 563, 569, 577–578 (ED\nLa. 2009) (invalidating post-Hurricane Katrina ordinance\nrestricting the rental of housing units to only “ ‘blood\nrelative[s]’ ” in an area of the city that was 88.3% white\nand 7.6% black); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 52–53 (discuss-\ning these cases). The availability of disparate-impact\nliability, furthermore, has allowed private developers to\nvindicate the FHA’s objectives and to protect their prop-\nerty rights by stopping municipalities from enforcing arbi-\ntrary and, in practice, discriminatory ordinances barring\nthe construction of certain types of housing units. See,\ne.g., Huntington, supra, at 18. Recognition of disparate-\nimpact liability under the FHA also plays a role in uncov-\nering discriminatory intent: It permits plaintiffs to coun-\nteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that\nescape easy classification as disparate treatment. In this\n\f18 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nway disparate-impact liability may prevent segregated\nhousing patterns that might otherwise result from covert\nand illicit stereotyping.\n   But disparate-impact liability has always been properly\nlimited in key respects that avoid the serious constitutional\nquestions that might arise under the FHA, for instance,\nif such liability were imposed based solely on a showing of\na statistical disparity. Disparate-impact liability man-\ndates the “removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary\nbarriers,” not the displacement of valid governmental\npolicies. Griggs, supra, at 431. The FHA is not an in-\nstrument to force housing authorities to reorder their\npriorities. Rather, the FHA aims to ensure that those\npriorities can be achieved without arbitrarily creating\ndiscriminatory effects or perpetuating segregation.\n   Unlike the heartland of disparate-impact suits targeting\nartificial barriers to housing, the underlying dispute in\nthis case involves a novel theory of liability. See Seicsh-\nnaydre, Is Disparate Impact Having Any Impact? An\nAppellate Analysis of Forty Years of Disparate Impact\nClaims Under the Fair Housing Act, 63 Am. U. L. Rev.\n357, 360–363 (2013) (noting the rarity of this type of\nclaim). This case, on remand, may be seen simply as an\nattempt to second-guess which of two reasonable ap-\nproaches a housing authority should follow in the sound\nexercise of its discretion in allocating tax credits for low-\nincome housing.\n   An important and appropriate means of ensuring that\ndisparate-impact liability is properly limited is to give\nhousing authorities and private developers leeway to state\nand explain the valid interest served by their policies.\nThis step of the analysis is analogous to the business\nnecessity standard under Title VII and provides a defense\nagainst disparate-impact liability. See 78 Fed. Reg. 11470\n(explaining that HUD did not use the phrase “business\nnecessity” because that “phrase may not be easily under-\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstood to cover the full scope of practices covered by the\nFair Housing Act, which applies to individuals, busi-\nnesses, nonprofit organizations, and public entities”). As the\nCourt explained in Ricci, an entity “could be liable for\ndisparate-impact discrimination only if the [challenged\npractices] were not job related and consistent with busi-\nness necessity.” 557 U. S., at 587. Just as an employer\nmay maintain a workplace requirement that causes a\ndisparate impact if that requirement is a “reasonable\nmeasure[ment] of job performance,” Griggs, supra, at 436,\nso too must housing authorities and private developers be\nallowed to maintain a policy if they can prove it is neces-\nsary to achieve a valid interest. To be sure, the Title VII\nframework may not transfer exactly to the fair-housing\ncontext, but the comparison suffices for present purposes.\n   It would be paradoxical to construe the FHA to impose\nonerous costs on actors who encourage revitalizing dilapi-\ndated housing in our Nation’s cities merely because some\nother priority might seem preferable. Entrepreneurs must\nbe given latitude to consider market factors. Zoning offi-\ncials, moreover, must often make decisions based on a mix\nof factors, both objective (such as cost and traffic patterns)\nand, at least to some extent, subjective (such as preserving\nhistoric architecture). These factors contribute to a com-\nmunity’s quality of life and are legitimate concerns for\nhousing authorities. The FHA does not decree a particular\nvision of urban development; and it does not put housing\nauthorities and private developers in a double bind of\nliability, subject to suit whether they choose to rejuvenate\na city core or to promote new low-income housing in sub-\nurban communities. As HUD itself recognized in its re-\ncent rulemaking, disparate-impact liability “does not\nmandate that affordable housing be located in neighbor-\nhoods with any particular characteristic.” 78 Fed.

OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\na statistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff cannot point\nto a defendant’s policy or policies causing that disparity.\nA robust causality requirement ensures that “[r]acial\nimbalance . . . does not, without more, establish a prima\nfacie case of disparate impact” and thus protects defend-\nants from being held liable for racial disparities they did\nnot create. Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S.\n642, 653 (1989), superseded by statute on other grounds,\n42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k). Without adequate safeguards at\nthe prima facie stage, disparate-impact liability might\ncause race to be used and considered in a pervasive way\nand “would almost inexorably lead” governmental or\nprivate entities to use “numerical quotas,” and serious\nconstitutional questions then could arise. 490 U. S., at 653.\n  The litigation at issue here provides an example. From\nthe standpoint of determining advantage or disadvantage\nto racial minorities, it seems difficult to say as a general\nmatter that a decision to build low-income housing in a\nblighted inner-city neighborhood instead of a suburb is\ndiscriminatory, or vice versa. If those sorts of judgments\nare subject to challenge without adequate safeguards,\nthen there is a danger that potential defendants may\nadopt racial quotas—a circumstance that itself raises\nserious constitutional concerns.\n  Courts must therefore examine with care whether a\nplaintiff has made out a prima facie case of disparate\nimpact and prompt resolution of these cases is important.\nA plaintiff who fails to allege facts at the pleading stage or\nproduce statistical evidence demonstrating a causal con-\nnection cannot make out a prima facie case of disparate\nimpact. For instance, a plaintiff challenging the decision\nof a private developer to construct a new building in one\nlocation rather than another will not easily be able to\nshow this is a policy causing a disparate impact because\nsuch a one-time decision may not be a policy at all. It may\nalso be difficult to establish causation because of the mul-\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

And as Judge\nJones observed below, if the ICP cannot show a causal\nconnection between the Department’s policy and a dispar-\nate impact—for instance, because federal law substantially\nlimits the Department’s discretion—that should result\nin dismissal of this case. 747 F. 3d, at 283–284 (specially\nconcurring opinion).\n   The FHA imposes a command with respect to disparate-\nimpact liability. Here, that command goes to a state\nentity. In other cases, the command will go to a private\nperson or entity. Governmental or private policies are not\ncontrary to the disparate-impact requirement unless they\nare “artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers.”\nGriggs, 401 U. S., at 431. Difficult questions might arise if\ndisparate-impact liability under the FHA caused race to be\nused and considered in a pervasive and explicit manner to\njustify governmental or private actions that, in fact, tend\nto perpetuate race-based considerations rather than move\nbeyond them. Courts should avoid interpreting disparate-\nimpact liability to be so expansive as to inject racial con-\nsiderations into every housing decision.\n   The limitations on disparate-impact liability discussed\nhere are also necessary to protect potential defendants\nagainst abusive disparate-impact claims. If the specter of\ndisparate-impact litigation causes private developers to no\nlonger construct or renovate housing units for low-income\nindividuals, then the FHA would have undermined its own\npurpose as well as the free-market system. And as to\ngovernmental entities, they must not be prevented from\nachieving legitimate objectives, such as ensuring compli-\nance with health and safety codes. The Department’s\namici, in addition to the well-stated principal dissenting\nopinion in this case, see post, at 1–2, 29–30 (opinion of\nALITO, J.), call attention to the decision by the Court of\nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit in Gallagher v. Magner,\n\f22 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n619 F. 3d 823 (2010). Although the Court is reluctant to\napprove or disapprove a case that is not pending, it should\nbe noted that Magner was decided without the cautionary\nstandards announced in this opinion and, in all events, the\ncase was settled by the parties before an ultimate deter-\nmination of disparate-impact liability.\n    Were standards for proceeding with disparate-impact\nsuits not to incorporate at least the safeguards discussed\nhere, then disparate-impact liability might displace valid\ngovernmental and private priorities, rather than solely\n“remov[ing] . . . artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary\nbarriers.” Griggs, 401 U. S., at 431. And that, in turn,\nwould set our Nation back in its quest to reduce the sali-\nence of race in our social and economic system.\n    It must be noted further that, even when courts do find\nliability under a disparate-impact theory, their remedial\norders must be consistent with the Constitution. Remedial\norders in disparate-impact cases should concentrate on\nthe elimination of the offending practice that “arbitrar[ily]\n. . . operate[s] invidiously to discriminate on the basis of\nrac[e].” Ibid. If additional measures are adopted, courts\nshould strive to design them to eliminate racial disparities\nthrough race-neutral means. See Richmond v. J. A.\nCroson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 510 (1989) (plurality opinion)\n(“[T]he city has at its disposal a whole array of race-\nneutral devices to increase the accessibility of city con-\ntracting opportunities to small entrepreneurs of all races”).\nRemedial orders that impose racial targets or quotas\nmight raise more difficult constitutional questions.\n    While the automatic or pervasive injection of race into\npublic and private transactions covered by the FHA has\nspecial dangers, it is also true that race may be considered\nin certain circumstances and in a proper fashion. Cf.\nParents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School\nDist. No. 1, 551 U.

When\nsetting their larger goals, local housing authorities may\nchoose to foster diversity and combat racial isolation with\nrace-neutral tools, and mere awareness of race in attempt-\ning to solve the problems facing inner cities does not doom\nthat endeavor at the outset.\n  The Court holds that disparate-impact claims are cog-\nnizable under the Fair Housing Act upon considering its\nresults-oriented language, the Court’s interpretation of\nsimilar language in Title VII and the ADEA, Congress’\nratification of disparate-impact claims in 1988 against the\nbackdrop of the unanimous view of nine Courts of Appeals,\nand the statutory purpose.\n                              III\n   In light of the longstanding judicial interpretation of the\nFHA to encompass disparate-impact claims and congres-\nsional reaffirmation of that result, residents and policy-\nmakers have come to rely on the availability of disparate-\nimpact claims.

That decision,\nwhich concluded that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 authorizes plaintiffs to bring disparate-impact\nclaims, id., at 429–431, represents the triumph of an\nagency’s preferences over Congress’ enactment and of\nassumption over fact. Whatever respect Griggs merits as\na matter of stare decisis, I would not amplify its error by\nimporting its disparate-impact scheme into yet another\nstatute.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   We should drop the pretense that Griggs’ interpretation\nof Title VII was legitimate. “The Civil Rights Act of 1964\ndid not include an express prohibition on policies or prac-\ntices that produce a disparate impact.” Ricci v.

The\nonly dispute is whether the same language—“because of\n”—means something different in §2000e–2(a)(2) than it\ndoes in §2000e–2(a)(1).\n    The answer to that question should be obvious.

EEOC’s “own official history of\nthese early years records with unusual candor the com-\nmission’s fundamental disagreement with its founding\ncharter, especially Title VII’s literal requirement that the\ndiscrimination be intentional.” H. Graham, The Civil\nRights Era: Origins and Development of National Policy\n1960–1972, p. 248 (1990). The Commissioners and their\nlegal staff thought that “discrimination” had become “less\noften an individual act of disparate treatment flowing\nfrom an evil state of mind” and “more institutionalized.”\nJackson, EEOC vs. Discrimination, Inc., 75 The Crisis 16\n(1968). They consequently decided they should target\nemployment practices “which prove to have a demonstra-\nble racial effect without a clear and convincing business\nmotive.” Id., at 16–17 (emphasis deleted). EEOC’s “legal\nstaff was aware from the beginning that a normal, tradi-\ntional, and literal interpretation of Title VII could blunt\ntheir efforts” to penalize employers for practices that had a\ndisparate impact, yet chose “to defy Title VII’s restrictions\nand attempt to build a body of case law that would justify\n[their] focus on effects and [their] disregard of intent.”\nGraham, supra, at 248, 250.\n   The lack of legal authority for their agenda apparently\ndid not trouble them much. For example, Alfred Blum-\nrosen, one of the principal creators of disparate-impact\nliability at EEOC, rejected what he described as a “defeat-\nist view of Title VII” that saw the statute as a “compro-\nmise” with a limited scope. A. Blumrosen, Black Employ-\nment and the Law 57–58 (1971).

S. 775, 811, n. 1 (1998) (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting), it repeatedly issued guidelines on the subject\nof disparate impact. In 1966, for example, EEOC issued\nguidelines suggesting that the use of employment tests in\nhiring decisions could violate Title VII based on disparate\nimpact, notwithstanding the statute’s express statement\nthat “it shall not be an unlawful employment practice . . .\nto give and to act upon the results of any professionally\ndeveloped ability test provided that such test . . . is not\ndesigned, intended, or used to discriminate because of\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin,” §2000e–2(h)\n(emphasis added). See EEOC, Guidelines on Employment\nTesting Procedures 2–4 (Aug. 24, 1966). EEOC followed\nthis up with a 1970 guideline that was even more explicit,\ndeclaring that, unless certain criteria were met, “[t]he use\nof any test which adversely affects hiring, promotion,\ntransfer or any other employment or membership oppor-\ntunity of classes protected by title VII constitutes discrim-\nination.” 35 Fed. Reg. 12334 (1970).\n    EEOC was initially hesitant to take its approach to this\nCourt, but the Griggs plaintiffs forced its hand. After they\nlost on their disparate-impact argument in the Court of\nAppeals, EEOC’s deputy general counsel urged the plain-\ntiffs not to seek review because he believed “ ‘that the\nrecord in the case present[ed] a most unappealing situa-\ntion for finding tests unlawful,’ ” even though he found the\nlower court’s adherence to an intent requirement to be\n“ ‘tragic.’ ” Graham, supra, at 385. The plaintiffs ignored\nhis advice.

With only a brief nod to the text of\n§2000e–2(a)(2) in a footnote, id., at 426, n. 1, the Court\ntied this novel theory of discrimination to “the statute’s\nperceived purpose” and EEOC’s view of the best way of\neffectuating it, Smith, 544 U.

Horowitz, Ethnic Groups in Conflict\n677 (1985). “All multi-ethnic societies exhibit a tendency\nfor ethnic groups to engage in different occupations, have\ndifferent levels (and, often, types) of education, receive\ndifferent incomes, and occupy a different place in the\nsocial hierarchy.” Weiner, The Pursuit of Ethnic Equality\nThrough Preferential Policies: A Comparative Public\nPolicy Perspective, in From Independence to Statehood 64\n(R.

And if that\n“racial balancing” is achieved through disparate-impact\nclaims limited to only some groups—if, for instance, white\nbasketball players cannot bring disparate-impact suits—\nthen we as a Court have constructed a scheme that parcels\nout legal privileges to individuals on the basis of skin\ncolor.

In Smith, for example, a plurality of this\nCourt relied on Griggs to include disparate-impact liability\nin the ADEA. See 544 U. S., at 236. As both I and the\nauthor of today’s majority opinion recognized at the time,\nthat decision was as incorrect as it was regrettable. See\nid., at 248–249 (O’Connor, J., joined by KENNEDY and\nTHOMAS, JJ., concurring in judgment). Because we knew\nthat Congress did not create disparate-impact liability\nunder Title VII, we explained that “there [wa]s no reason\nto suppose that Congress in 1967”—four years before\nGriggs—“could have foreseen the interpretation of Title\nVII that was to come.” Smith, supra, at 260 (opinion of\nO’Connor, J.). It made little sense to repeat Griggs’ error\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Whatever deference is\ndue Griggs as a matter of stare decisis, we should at the\nvery least confine it to Title VII. We should not incorpo-\nrate it into statutes such as the Fair Housing Act and the\nADEA, which were passed years before Congress had any\nreason to suppose that this Court would take the position\nit did in Griggs. See Smith, supra, at 260 (opinion of\nO’Connor, J.). And we should certainly not allow it to\nspread to statutes like the Fair Housing Act, whose opera-\ntive text, unlike that of the ADEA’s, does not even mirror\nTitle VII’s.\n   Today, however, the majority inexplicably declares that\n“the logic of Smith and Griggs” leads to the conclusion that\n“the FHA encompasses disparate-impact claims.” Ante, at\n11. JUSTICE ALITO ably dismantles this argument. Post,\nat 21–28 (dissenting opinion). But, even if the majority\nwere correct, I would not join it in following that “logic”\nhere. “[E]rroneous precedents need not be extended to\ntheir logical end, even when dealing with related provi-\nsions that normally would be interpreted in lockstep.\nOtherwise, stare decisis, designed to be a principle of\nstability and repose, would become a vehicle of change . . .\ndistorting the law.” CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 553\nU. S. 442, 469–470 (2008) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (foot-\nnote omitted). Making the same mistake in different\nareas of the law furthers neither certainty nor judicial\neconomy. It furthers error.\n   That error will take its toll. The recent experience of\nthe Houston Housing Authority (HHA) illustrates some of\nthe many costs of disparate-impact liability. HHA, which\nprovides affordable housing developments to low-income\nresidents of Houston, has over 43,000 families on its wait-\ning lists. The overwhelming majority of those families are\nblack. Because Houston is a majority-minority city with\nminority concentrations in all but the more affluent areas,\n\f12 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\nany HHA developments built outside of those areas will\nincrease the concentration of racial minorities. Unsurpris-\ningly, the threat of disparate-impact suits based on those\nconcentrations has hindered HHA’s efforts to provide\naffordable housing. State and federal housing agencies\nhave refused to approve all but two of HHA’s eight pro-\nposed development projects over the past two years out of\nfears of disparate-impact liability.

C. §3601 et seq., could\nbe used to attack St. Paul, Minnesota’s efforts to combat\n“rodent infestation” and other violations of the city’s hous-\ning code. 619 F. 3d, at 830. The court agreed that there\nwas no basis to “infer discriminatory intent” on the part of\nSt. Paul. Id., at 833. Even so, it concluded that the city’s\n“aggressive enforcement of the Housing Code” was action-\nable because making landlords respond to “rodent infesta-\ntion, missing dead-bolt locks, inadequate sanitation facili-\nties, inadequate heat, inoperable smoke detectors, broken\nor missing doors,” and the like increased the price of rent.\nId., at 830, 835. Since minorities were statistically more\nlikely to fall into “the bottom bracket for household ad-\njusted median family income,” they were disproportionately\naffected by those rent increases, i.e., there was a “dis-\nparate impact.” Id., at 834. The upshot was that even St.\nPaul’s good-faith attempt to ensure minimally acceptable\nhousing for its poorest residents could not ward off a\ndisparate-impact lawsuit.\n\f2    TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n           INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\n   Today, the Court embraces the same theory that drove\nthe decision in Magner.1 This is a serious mistake. The\nFair Housing Act does not create disparate-impact liabil-\nity, nor do this Court’s precedents. And today’s decision\nwill have unfortunate consequences for local government,\nprivate enterprise, and those living in poverty. Something\nhas gone badly awry when a city can’t even make slum-\nlords kill rats without fear of a lawsuit. Because Congress\ndid not authorize any of this, I respectfully dissent.\n                              I\n   Everyone agrees that the FHA punishes intentional\ndiscrimination. Treating someone “less favorably than\nothers because of a protected trait” is “ ‘the most easily\nunderstood type of discrimination.’ ” Ricci v. DeStefano,\n557 U. S. 557, 577 (2009) (quoting Teamsters v. United\nStates, 431 U. S. 324, 335, n. 15 (1977); some internal\nquotation marks omitted). Indeed, this classic form of\ndiscrimination—called disparate treatment—is the only\none prohibited by the Constitution itself. See, e.g., Arling-\nton Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,\n429 U. S. 252, 264–265 (1977). It is obvious that Congress\nintended the FHA to cover disparate treatment.\n  The question presented here, however, is whether the\nFHA also punishes “practices that are not intended to\ndiscriminate but in fact have a disproportionately adverse\neffect on minorities.” Ricci, supra, at 577. The answer is\nequally clear. The FHA does not authorize disparate-\nimpact claims. No such liability was created when the law\nwas enacted in 1968. And nothing has happened since\nthen to change the law’s meaning.\n\n——————\n    1 We\n       granted certiorari in Magner v. Gallagher, 565 U.

S. C. §3604(a)\n(emphasis added). Similarly, §805(a) prohibits any party\n“whose business includes engaging in residential real\nestate-related transactions” from “discriminat[ing] against\nany person in making available such a transaction, or in\nthe terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of\nrace, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or\nnational origin.” §3605(a) (emphasis added).\n    In both sections, the key phrase is “because of.” These\nprovisions list covered actions (“refus[ing] to sell or rent\n. . . a dwelling,” “refus[ing] to negotiate for the sale or\nrental of . . . a dwelling,” “discriminat[ing]” in a residential\nreal estate transaction, etc.) and protected characteristics\n(“race,” “religion,” etc.). The link between the actions and\nthe protected characteristics is “because of.”\n    What “because of ” means is no mystery. Two Terms\nago, we held that “the ordinary meaning of ‘because of ’ is\n‘by reason of ’ or ‘on account of.’ ” University of Tex.\nSouthwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U.

The Court wrote:\n“ ‘Because of ’ in §2000e–2(a)(1) links the forbidden consid-\neration to each of the verbs preceding it.” Ibid.\n   Nor is this understanding of “because of ” an arcane\nfeature of legal usage. When English speakers say that\nsomeone did something “because of ” a factor, what they\nmean is that the factor was a reason for what was done.\nFor example, on the day this case was argued, January 21,\n2015, Westlaw and Lexis searches reveal that the phrase\n“because of ” appeared in 14 Washington Post print arti-\ncles.

The FHA makes it a crime to\nwillfully “interfere with . . . any person because of his race”\n(or other protected characteristic) who is engaging in a\nvariety of real-estate-related activities, such as “selling,\npurchasing, [or] renting” a dwelling. 42 U.

EPA, 573 U. S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 15). There is no reason to doubt that\nordinary assumption here.\n   Like the FHA, many other federal statutes use the\nphrase “because of ” to signify what that phrase means in\nordinary speech. For instance, the federal hate crime\nstatute, 18 U. S. C. §249, authorizes enhanced sentences\nfor defendants convicted of committing certain crimes\n“because of ” race, color, religion, or other listed character-\nistics.

S. C. §3604(a). See also\n§3605(a) (barring “discriminat[ion] against any person in\nmaking available such a [housing] transaction . . . because\nof race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or\nnational origin”). The Solicitor General argues that “[t]he\nplain meaning of the phrase ‘make unavailable’ includes\nactions that have the result of making housing or transac-\ntions unavailable, regardless of whether the actions were\nintended to have that result.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 18 (emphasis added). This argument is not\nconsistent with ordinary English usage.\n   It is doubtful that the Solicitor General’s argument\naccurately captures the “plain meaning” of the phrase\n“make unavailable” even when that phrase is not linked to\nthe phrase “because of.” “[M]ake unavailable” must be\nviewed together with the rest of the actions covered by\n§804(a), which applies when a party “refuse[s] to sell or\nrent” a dwelling, “refuse[s] to negotiate for the sale or\nrental” of a dwelling, “den[ies] a dwelling to any person,”\n“or otherwise make[s] unavailable” a dwelling. §3604(a)\n(emphasis added).

Washington State Dept. of\nSocial and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Kef-\nfeler, 537 U. S. 371, 384–385 (2003). The result of these\nordinary rules of interpretation is that even without “be-\ncause of,” the phrase “make unavailable” likely would\nrequire intentionality.\n   The FHA’s inclusion of “because of,” however, removes\nany doubt. Sections 804(a) and 805(a) apply only when a\nparty makes a dwelling or transaction unavailable “be-\ncause of ” race or another protected characteristic. In\nordinary English usage, when a person makes something\nunavailable “because of ” some factor, that factor must be a\nreason for the act.\n   Here is an example. Suppose that Congress increases\nthe minimum wage. Some economists believe that such\nlegislation reduces the number of jobs available for “un-\nskilled workers,” Fuller & Geide-Stevenson, Consensus\nAmong Economists: Revisited, 34 J. Econ. Educ. 369, 378\n(2003), and minorities tend to be disproportionately repre-\nsented in this group, see, e.g., Dept. of Commerce, Bureau\nof Census, Detailed Years of School Completed by People\n25 Years and Over by Sex, Age Groups, Race and Hispanic\nOrigin: 2014, online at http://www.census.gov/hhes/\nsocdemo/education/data/cps/2014/tables.html (all Inter-\nnet materials as visited June 23, 2015, and available in\nClerk of Court’s case file).

Of the 32 college players selected by\nNational Football League (NFL) teams in the first round\nof the 2015 draft, it appears that the overwhelming major-\nity were members of racial minorities. See Draft 2015,\nhttp://www.nfl.com/draft/2015. See also Miller, Powerful\nSports Agents Representing Color, Los Angeles Sentinel,\nFeb. 6, 2014, p. B3 (noting “there are 96 players (76 of\nwhom are African-American) chosen in the first rounds of\nthe 2009, 2010, and 2011 NFL drafts”). Teams presuma-\nbly chose the players they think are most likely to help\nthem win games. Would anyone say the NFL teams made\ndraft slots unavailable to white players “because of ” their\nrace?\n   A third example. During the present Court Term, of the\n21 attorneys from the Solicitor General’s Office who ar-\ngued cases in this Court, it appears that all but 5 (76%)\nwere under the age of 45. Would the Solicitor General say\nhe made argument opportunities unavailable to older\nattorneys “because of ” their age?\n   The text of the FHA simply cannot be twisted to author-\nize disparate-impact claims. It is hard to imagine how\nCongress could have more clearly stated that the FHA\nprohibits only intentional discrimination than by forbid-\nding acts done “because of race, color, religion, sex, familial\nstatus, or national origin.”\n                             II\n  The circumstances in which the FHA was enacted only\nconfirm what the text says. In 1968, “the predominant\nfocus of antidiscrimination law was on intentional discrim-\nination.” Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228, 258\n(2005) (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The very\n“concept of disparate impact liability, by contrast, was\nquite novel.” Ibid. (collecting citations). See also Tr. of\nOral Arg. 15 (“JUSTICE GINSBURG: . . .

It is anachronistic to think that Congress author-\nized disparate-impact claims in 1968 but packaged that\nstriking innovation so imperceptibly in the FHA’s text.\n  Eradicating intentional discrimination was and is the\nFHA’s strategy for providing fair housing opportunities for\nall. The Court recalls the country’s shameful history of\nsegregation and de jure housing discrimination and then\njumps to the conclusion that the FHA authorized disparate-\nimpact claims as a method of combatting that evil.\nAnte, at 5–7. But the fact that the 1968 Congress sought\nto end housing discrimination says nothing about the\nmeans it devised to achieve that end. The FHA’s text\nplainly identifies the weapon Congress chose—outlawing\ndisparate treatment “because of race” or another protected\ncharacteristic. 42 U. S. C. §§3604(a), 3605(a). Accordingly,\nin any FHA claim, “[p]roof of discriminatory motive is\ncritical.” Teamsters, 431 U. S., at 335, n. 15.\n                              III\n    Congress has done nothing since 1968 to change the\nmeaning of the FHA prohibitions at issue in this case. In\n1968, those prohibitions forbade certain housing practices\nif they were done “because of ” protected characteristics.\nToday, they still forbid certain housing practices if done\n“because of ” protected characteristics. The meaning of the\nunaltered language adopted in 1968 has not evolved.\n    Rather than confronting the plain text of §§804(a) and\n805(a), the Solicitor General and the Court place heavy\nreliance on certain amendments enacted in 1988, but\nthose amendments did not modify the meaning of the\nprovisions now before us. In the Fair Housing Amend-\nments Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 1619, Congress expanded the\nlist of protected characteristics. See 42 U. S. C. §§3604(a),\n(f )(1). Congress also gave the Department of Housing and\n\f                      Cite as: 576 U.

See §§3612,\n3614a. And, what is most relevant for present purposes,\nCongress added three safe-harbor provisions, specifying\nthat “[n]othing in [the FHA]” prohibits (a) certain actions\ntaken by real property appraisers, (b) certain occupancy\nrequirements, and (c) the treatment of persons convicted\nof manufacturing or distributing illegal drugs.3\n   According to the Solicitor General and the Court, these\namendments show that the FHA authorizes disparate-\nimpact claims. Indeed, the Court says that they are “of\ncrucial importance.” Ante, at 13. This “crucial” argument,\nhowever, cannot stand.\n                            A\n   The Solicitor General and the Court contend that the\n1988 Congress implicitly authorized disparate-impact\nliability by adopting the amendments just noted while\nleaving the operative provisions of the FHA untouched.\nCongress knew at that time, they maintain, that the\nCourts of Appeals had held that the FHA sanctions\ndisparate-impact claims, but Congress failed to enact bills\nthat would have rejected that theory of liability. Based on\nthis, they submit that Congress silently ratified those\n——————\n  3 These  new provisions state:\n  “Nothing in this subchapter prohibits a person engaged in the busi-\nness of furnishing appraisals of real property to take into consideration\nfactors other than race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or\nfamilial status.” §3605(c).\n  “Nothing in this subchapter limits the applicability of any reasonable\nlocal, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of\noccupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. Nor does any provision in\nthis subchapter regarding familial status apply with respect to housing\nfor older persons.” §3607(b)(1).\n  “Nothing in this subchapter prohibits conduct against a person be-\ncause such person has been convicted by any court of competent juris-\ndiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled sub-\nstance as defined in section 802 of title 21.” §3607(b)(4).\n\f12 TEXAS DEPT.

See ante, at 13–14; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 23–24. This argument is deeply flawed.\n     Not the greatest of its defects is its assessment of what\nCongress must have known about the judiciary’s interpre-\ntation of the FHA. The Court writes that by 1988, “all\nnine Courts of Appeals to have addressed the question had\nconcluded the Fair Housing Act encompassed disparate-\nimpact claims.” Ante, at 13 (emphasis added). See also\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12. But this\nCourt had not addressed that question. While we always\ngive respectful consideration to interpretations of statutes\nthat garner wide acceptance in other courts, this Court\nhas “no warrant to ignore clear statutory language on the\nground that other courts have done so,” even if they have\n“ ‘consistently’ ” done so for “ ‘30 years.’ ” Milner v. Depart-\nment of Navy, 562 U. S. 562, 575–576 (2011). See also,\ne.g., CSX Transp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (ROBERTS, C.

While the Court highlights the deci-\nsions of the Courts of Appeals, it fails to mention some-\nthing that is of at least equal importance: The official view\nof the United States in 1988.\n    Shortly before the 1988 amendments were adopted, the\nUnited States formally argued in this Court that the FHA\nprohibits only intentional discrimination. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae in Huntington v. Hun-\ntington Branch, NAACP, O. T. 1988, No. 87–1961, p. 15\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U.

See, e.g., United States v. Bir-\nmingham, 538 F. Supp. 819, 827, n. 9 (ED Mich. 1982)\n(noting positional change), aff ’d, 727 F. 2d 560, 565–566\n(CA6 1984) (adopting United States’ “concession” that\nthere must be a “ ‘discriminatory motive’ ”). It is implausi-\nble that the 1988 Congress was aware of certain lower\ncourt decisions but oblivious to the United States’ consid-\nered and public view that those decisions were wrong.\n   This fact is fatal to any notion that Congress implicitly\nratified disparate impact in 1988. The canon of interpre-\ntation on which the Court and the Solicitor General pur-\nport to rely—the so-called “prior-construction canon”—\ndoes not apply where lawyers cannot “justifiably regard\nthe point as settled” or when “other sound rules of inter-\npretation” are implicated. A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading\nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 324, 325 (2012).\nThat was the case here. Especially after the United States\nbegan repudiating disparate impact, no one could have\nreasonably thought that the question was settled.\n   Nor can such a faulty argument be salvaged by pointing\nto Congress’ failure in 1988 to enact language that would\nhave made it clear that the FHA does not authorize\ndisparate-impact suits based on zoning decisions. See ante,\n\n——————\n  4 In response to the United States’ argument, we reserved decision on\n\nthe question. See Huntington v. Huntington Branch, NAACP, 488 U.

See, e.g., West Virginia Univ.\nHospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, 100, 101, and n. 7\n(1991). Intent that finds no expression in a statute is\nirrelevant. See, e.g., New York Telephone Co. v. New York\nState Dept. of Labor, 440 U. S. 519, 544–545 (1979);\nEasterbrook, Statutes’ Domains, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 533,\n538–540 (1983). Hence, “we walk on quicksand when we\ntry to find in the absence of corrective legislation a control-\nling legal principle.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106,\n121 (1940).\n   Unsurprisingly, we have rejected identical arguments\nabout implicit ratification in other cases. For example, in\nCentral Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of\nDenver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164 (1994), a party argued that\n§10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 imposes\nliability on aiders and abettors because “Congress ha[d]\namended the securities laws on various occasions since\n1966, when courts first began to interpret §10(b) to cover\naiding and abetting, but ha[d] done so without providing\nthat aiding and abetting liability is not available under\n§10(b).” Id., at 186. “From that,” a party asked the Court\n——————\n   5 In any event, the Court overstates the importance of that failed\n\namendment. The amendment’s sponsor disavowed that it had anything\nto do with the broader question whether the FHA authorizes disparate-\nimpact suits. Rather, it “left to caselaw and eventual Supreme Court\nresolution whether a discriminatory intent or discriminatory effects\nstandard is appropriate . . . [in] all situations but zoning.” H. R. Rep.\nNo. 100–711, p. 89 (1988). Some in Congress, moreover, supported the\namendment and the House bill. Compare ibid. with 134 Cong. Rec.\n16511 (1988). It is hard to believe they thought the bill—which was\nsilent on disparate impact—nonetheless decided the broader question.\nIt is for such reasons that failed amendments tell us “little” about what\na statute means. Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank\nof Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 187 (1994). Footnotes in House Reports\nand law professor testimony tell us even less.

The\nCourt dismissed this argument in words that apply almost\nverbatim here:\n    “ ‘It does not follow that Congress’ failure to overturn\n    a statutory precedent is reason for this Court to ad-\n    here to it. It is “impossible to assert with any degree\n    of assurance that congressional failure to act repre-\n    sents” affirmative congressional approval of the\n    courts’ statutory interpretation. Congress may legis-\n    late, moreover, only through the passage of a bill\n    which is approved by both Houses and signed by the\n    President. See U. S. Const., Art. I, §7, cl. 2.

There it was argued that amendments to Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 implicitly ratified lower court\ndecisions upholding a private right of action. We rejected\nthat argument out of hand. See id., at 292–293.\n  Without explanation, the Court ignores these cases.\n                             B\n  The Court contends that the 1988 amendments provide\n“convincing confirmation of Congress’ understanding that\ndisparate-impact liability exists under the FHA” because\nthe three safe-harbor provisions included in those\namendments “would be superfluous if Congress had as-\nsumed that disparate-impact liability did not exist under\nthe FHA.” Ante, at 14, 15. As just explained, however,\nwhat matters is what Congress did, not what it might\nhave “assumed.” And although the Court characterizes\n\f16 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nthese provisions as “exemptions,” that characterization is\ninaccurate. They make no reference to §804(a) or §805(a)\nor any other provision of the FHA; nor do they state that\nthey apply to conduct that would otherwise be prohibited.\nInstead, they simply make clear that certain conduct is\nnot forbidden by the Act. E.g., 42 U. S. C. §3607(b)(4)\n(“Nothing in this subchapter prohibits . . .”). The Court\nshould read these amendments to mean what they say.\n   In 1988, policymakers were not of one mind about\ndisparate-impact housing suits. Some favored the theory\nand presumably would have been happy to have it en-\nshrined in the FHA. See ante, at 13–14; 134 Cong. Rec.\n23711 (1988) (statement of Sen. Kennedy). Others worried\nabout disparate-impact liability and recognized that this\nCourt had not decided whether disparate-impact claims\nwere authorized under the 1968 Act. See H. R. Rep. No.\n100–711, pp. 89–93 (1988). Still others disapproved of\ndisparate-impact liability and believed that the 1968 Act\ndid not authorize it. That was the view of President\nReagan when he signed the amendments. See Remarks\non Signing the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 24\nWeekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1140, 1141 (1988) (explaining\nthat the amendments did “not represent any congressional\nor executive branch endorsement of the notion, expressed\nin some judicial opinions, that [FHA] violations may be\nestablished by a showing of disparate impact” because the\nFHA “speaks only to intentional discrimination”).6\n——————\n  6 At the same hearings to which the Court refers, ante, at 13, Senator\n\nHatch stated that if the “intent test versus the effects test” were to\n“becom[e] an issue,” a “fair housing law” might not be enacted at all,\nand he noted that failed legislation in the past had gotten “bogged\ndown” because of that “battle.” Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1987:\nHearings on S. 558 before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the\nSenate Committee on the Judiciary, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1987).\nHe also noted that the bill under consideration did “not really go one\nway or the other” on disparate impact since the sponsors were content\nto “rely” on the lower court opinions. Ibid. And he emphasized that\n\f                      Cite as: 576 U.

These provisions\nneither authorize nor bar disparate-impact claims, but\nthey do provide additional protection for persons and\nentities engaging in certain practices that Congress espe-\ncially wished to shield. We “must respect and give effect\nto these sorts of compromises.” Ragsdale v. Wolverine\nWorld Wide, Inc., 535 U. S. 81, 93–94 (2002).\n   It is not hard to see why such a compromise was attrac-\ntive. For Members of Congress who supported disparate\nimpact, the safe harbors left the favorable lower court\ndecisions in place. And for those who hoped that this\nCourt would ultimately agree with the position being\nurged by the United States, those provisions were not\nsurplusage. In the Circuits in which disparate-impact\nFHA liability had been accepted, the safe-harbor provi-\nsions furnished a measure of interim protection until the\nquestion was resolved by this Court. They also provided\npartial protection in the event that this Court ultimately\nrejected the United States’ argument. Neither the Court,\nthe principal respondent, nor the Solicitor General has\ncited any case in which the canon against surplusage has\nbeen applied in circumstances like these.7\n——————\n“the issue of intent versus effect—I am afraid that is going to have to be\ndecided by the Supreme Court.” Ibid. See also id., at 10 (“It is not\nalways a violation to refuse to sell, but only to refuse to sell ‘because of ’\nanother’s race. This language made clear that the 90th Congress\nmeant only to outlaw acts taken with the intent to discriminate . . . . To\nuse any standard other than discriminatory intent . . . would jeopardize\nmany kinds of beneficial zoning and local ordinances” (statement of\nSen.

Our decision in O’Gilvie v. United States, 519 U. S.\n79 (1996)—also ignored by the Court today—is instructive.\nIn that case, the question was whether a provision of the\nInternal Revenue Code excluding a recovery for personal\ninjury from gross income applied to punitive damages.\nWell after the critical provision was enacted, Congress\nadopted an amendment providing that punitive damages\nfor nonphysical injuries were not excluded. Pointing to\nthis amendment, a taxpayer argued: “Why . . . would\nCongress have enacted this amendment removing punitive\ndamages (in nonphysical injury cases) unless Congress\nbelieved that, in the amendment’s absence, punitive dam-\nages did fall within the provision’s coverage?” Id., at 89.\nThis argument, of course, is precisely the same as the\nargument made in this case. To paraphrase O’Gilvie, the\nCourt today asks: Why would Congress have enacted the\n1988 amendments, providing safe harbors from three\ntypes of disparate-impact claims, unless Congress believed\n——————\nwhich some courts have applied in disparate-treatment housing cases,\nsee, e.g., 2922 Sherman Avenue Tenants’ Assn. v. District of Columbia,\n444 F. 3d 673, 682 (CADC 2006) (collecting cases), a defendant must\nproffer a legitimate reason for the challenged conduct, and the safe-\nharbor provisions set out reasons that are necessarily legitimate.\nMoreover, while a factfinder in a disparate-treatment case can some-\ntimes infer bad intent based on facially neutral conduct, these safe\nharbors protect against such inferences. Without more, conduct within\na safe harbor is insufficient to support such an inference as a matter of\nlaw. And finally, even if there is additional evidence, these safe har-\nbors make it harder to show pretext. See Fair Housing Advocates\nAssn., Inc. v. Richmond Heights, 209 F. 3d 626, 636–637, and n. 7 (CA6\n2000).\n  Even if they were superfluous, moreover, our “preference for avoiding\nsurplusage constructions is not absolute.” Lamie v. United States\nTrustee, 540 U. S. 526, 536 (2004). We “presume that a legislature says\nin a statute what it means,” notwithstanding “[r]edundanc[y].” Con-\nnecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U.

Although other aspects of O’Gilvie\ntriggered a dissent, see id., at 94–101 (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.), no one quarreled with this self-evident piece of the\nCourt’s analysis. Nor was the O’Gilvie Court troubled that\nCongress’ amendment regarding nonphysical injuries\nturned out to have been unnecessary because punitive\ndamages for any injuries were not excluded all along.\n   The Court saw the flaw in the argument in O’Gilvie, and\nthe same argument is no better here. It is true that\nO’Gilvie involved a dry question of tax law while this case\ninvolves a controversial civil rights issue. But how we\nread statutes should not turn on such distinctions.\n   In sum, as the principal respondent’s attorney candidly\nadmitted, the 1988 amendments did not create disparate-\nimpact liability. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 36 (“[D]id the things\nthat [Congress] actually did in 1988 expand the coverage\nof the Act? MR. DANIEL: No, Justice”).\n                              C\n   The principal respondent and the Solicitor General—but\nnot the Court—have one final argument regarding the text\nof the FHA. They maintain that even if the FHA does not\nunequivocally authorize disparate-impact suits, it is at\nleast ambiguous enough to permit HUD to adopt that\ninterpretation. Even if the FHA were ambiguous, how-\never, we do not defer “when there is reason to suspect that\nthe agency’s interpretation ‘does not reflect the agency’s\nfair and considered judgment on the matter in question.’ ”\nChristopher v.

Reg. 70921 (2011). After Magner settled, the\nCourt called for the views of the Solicitor General in\nTownship of Mount Holly v. Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in\nAction, Inc., 568 U. S. ___ (2012), another case raising the\nsame question. Before the Solicitor General filed his brief,\nhowever, HUD adopted disparate-impact regulations. See\nImplementation of the Fair Housing Act’s Discriminatory\nEffects Standard, 78 Fed. Reg. 11460 (2013). The Solicitor\nGeneral then urged HUD’s rule as a reason to deny certio-\nrari. We granted certiorari anyway, 570 U. S. ___ (2013),\nand shortly thereafter Mount Holly also unexpectedly\nsettled. Given this unusual pattern, there is an argument\nthat deference may be unwarranted. Cf. Young v. United\nParcel Service, Inc., 575 U.

This rule makes even more sense where\nthe agency’s view would open up a deeply disruptive ave-\nnue of liability that Congress never contemplated.\n                             IV\n  Not only does disparate-impact liability run headlong\ninto the text of the FHA, it also is irreconcilable with our\nprecedents. The Court’s decision today reads far too much\ninto Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971), and\nfar too little into Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228\n(2005). In Smith, the Court explained that the statutory\njustification for the decision in Griggs depends on lan-\nguage that has no parallel in the FHA. And when the\nSmith Court addressed a provision that does have such a\nparallel in the FHA, the Court concluded—unanimously—\nthat it does not authorize disparate-impact liability. The\nsame result should apply here.\n                               A\n  Rather than focusing on the text of the FHA, much of\nthe Court’s reasoning today turns on Griggs. In Griggs,\nthe Court held that black employees who sued their em-\nployer under §703(a)(2) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(2), could recover without\nproving that the employer’s conduct—requiring a high\nschool diploma or a qualifying grade on a standardized\ntest as a condition for certain jobs—was motivated by a\ndiscriminatory intent. Instead, the Court held that, un-\nless it was proved that the requirements were “job re-\nlated,” the plaintiffs could recover by showing that the re-\nquirements “operated to render ineligible a markedly\ndisproportionate number of Negroes.” 401 U. S., at 429.\n  Griggs was a case in which an intent to discriminate\nmight well have been inferred. The company had “openly\ndiscriminated on the basis of race” prior to the date on\n\f22 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nwhich the 1964 Civil Rights Act took effect. Id., at 427.\nOnce that date arrived, the company imposed new educa-\ntional requirements for those wishing to transfer into jobs\nthat were then being performed by white workers who did\nnot meet those requirements. Id., at 427–428. These new\nhurdles disproportionately burdened African-Americans,\nwho had “long received inferior education in segregated\nschools.” Id., at 430. Despite all this, the lower courts\nfound that the company lacked discriminatory intent. See\nid., at 428. By convention, we do not overturn a finding of\nfact accepted by two lower courts, see, e.g., Rogers v.\nLodge, 458 U. S. 613, 623 (1982); Blau v. Lehman, 368\nU. S. 403, 408–409 (1962); Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v.\nLinde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275 (1949), so the\nCourt was confronted with the question whether Title VII\nalways demands intentional discrimination.\n   Although Griggs involved a question of statutory inter-\npretation, the body of the Court’s opinion—quite remarka-\nbly—does not even cite the provision of Title VII on which\nthe plaintiffs’ claims were based. The only reference to\n§703(a)(2) of the 1964 Civil Rights Act appears in a single\nfootnote that reproduces the statutory text but makes no\neffort to explain how it encompasses a disparate-impact\nclaim. See 401 U. S., at 426, n. 1. Instead, the Court\nbased its decision on the “objective” of Title VII, which the\nCourt described as “achiev[ing] equality of employment\nopportunities and remov[ing] barriers that have operated\nin the past to favor an identifiable group of white employ-\nees over other employees.” Id., at 429–430.\n   That text-free reasoning caused confusion, see, e.g.,\nSmith, supra, at 261–262 (O’Connor, J., concurring in\njudgment), and undoubtedly led to the pattern of Court of\nAppeals decisions in FHA cases upon which the majority\nnow relies. Those lower courts, like the Griggs Court,\noften made little effort to ground their decisions in the\nstatutory text. For example, in one of the earliest cases in\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           23\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthis line, United States v. Black Jack, 508 F. 2d 1179 (CA8\n1974), the heart of the court’s analysis was this: “Just as\nCongress requires ‘the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and\nunnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers\noperate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or\nother impermissible classification,’ such barriers must also\ngive way in the field of housing.” Id., at 1184 (quoting\nGriggs, supra, at 430–431; citation omitted).\n   Unlike these lower courts, however, this Court has\nnever interpreted Griggs as imposing a rule that applies to\nall antidiscrimination statutes. See, e.g., Guardians Assn.\nv. Civil Serv. Comm’n of New York City, 463 U. S. 582,\n607, n. 27 (1983) (holding that Title VI, 42 U. S. C. §2000d\net seq., does “not allow compensatory relief in the absence\nof proof of discriminatory intent”); Sandoval, 532 U. S., at\n280 (similar). Indeed, we have never held that Griggs\neven establishes a rule for all employment discrimination\nstatutes. In Teamsters, the Court rejected “the Griggs\nrationale” in evaluating a company’s seniority rules. 431\nU. S., at 349–350. And because Griggs was focused on a\nparticular problem, the Court had held that its rule does\nnot apply where, as here, the context is different. In Los\nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U. S.\n702 (1978), for instance, the Court refused to apply Griggs\nto pensions under the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U. S. C.\n§206(d) or Title VII, even if a plan has a “disproportion-\nately heavy impact on male employees.” 435 U. S. at 711,\nn. 20. We explained that “[e]ven a completely neutral\npractice will inevitably have some disproportionate impact\non one group or another. Griggs does not imply, and this\nCourt has never held, that discrimination must always be\ninferred from such consequences.” Ibid.\n                            B\n  Although the opinion in Griggs did not grapple with the\ntext of the provision at issue, the Court was finally re-\n\f24 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nquired to face that task in Smith, 544 U. S. 228, which\naddressed whether the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. §621 et seq., authorizes\ndisparate-impact suits. The Court considered two provi-\nsions of the ADEA, §§4(a)(1) and 4(a)(2), 29 U. S. C.\n§§623(a)(1) and (a)(2).\n  The Court unanimously agreed that the first of these\nprovisions, §4(a)(1), does not authorize disparate-impact\nclaims. See 544 U. S., at 236, n. 6 (plurality opinion); id.,\nat 243 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (agreeing with the plurality’s reasoning); id., at\n249 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (reasoning that\nthis provision “obvious[ly]” does not allow disparate-\nimpact claims).\n  By contrast, a majority of the Justices found that the\nterms of §4(a)(2) either clearly authorize disparate-impact\nclaims (the position of the plurality) or at least are ambig-\nuous enough to provide a basis for deferring to such an\ninterpretation by the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (the position of JUSTICE SCALIA). See 544\nU. S., at 233–240 (plurality opinion); id., at 243–247 (opin-\nion of SCALIA, J.).\n  In reaching this conclusion, these Justices reasoned that\n§4(a)(2) of the ADEA was modeled on and is virtually\nidentical to the provision in Griggs, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–\n2(a)(2). Section 4(a)(2) provides as follows:\n      “It shall be unlawful for an employer—\n        .            .           .           .         .\n      “(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in\n    any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n    individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n    adversely affect his status as an employee, because of\n    such individual’s age.” 29 U. S. C. §623(a) (emphasis\n    added).\n  The provision of Title VII at issue in Griggs says this:\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            25\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n      “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n    employer—\n        .            .           .           .         .\n      “(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or\n    applicants for employment in any way which would\n    deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employ-\n    ment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his\n    status as an employee, because of such individual’s\n    race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42\n    U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(2) (emphasis added).\n   For purposes here, the only relevant difference between\nthese provisions is that the ADEA provision refers to “age”\nand the Title VII provision refers to “race, color, religion,\nor national origin.” Because identical language in two\nstatutes having similar purposes should generally be\npresumed to have the same meaning, the plurality in\nSmith, echoed by JUSTICE SCALIA, saw Griggs as “compel-\nling” support for the conclusion that §4(a)(2) of the ADEA\nauthorizes disparate-impact claims. 544 U. S., at 233–234\n(plurality opinion) (citing Northcross v. Board of Ed. of\nMemphis City Schools, 412 U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per\ncuriam)).\n   When it came to the other ADEA provision addressed in\nSmith, namely, §4(a)(1), the Court unanimously reached\nthe opposite conclusion. Section 4(a)(1) states:\n       “It shall be unlawful for an employer—\n       “(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any indi-\n    vidual or otherwise discriminate against any individ-\n    ual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-\n    tions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n    individual’s age.” 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1) (emphasis\n    added).\n  The plurality opinion’s reasoning, with which JUSTICE\nSCALIA agreed, can be summarized as follows. Under\n§4(a)(1), the employer must act because of age, and thus\n\f26 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nmust have discriminatory intent. See 544 U. S., at 236, n.\n6.9 Under §4(a)(2), on the other hand, it is enough if the\nemployer’s actions “adversely affect” an individual “be-\ncause of . . . age.” 29 U. S. C. §623(a).\n   This analysis of §§4(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the ADEA con-\nfirms that the FHA does not allow disparate-impact\nclaims. Sections 804(a) and 805(a) of the FHA resemble\n§4(a)(1) of the ADEA, which the Smith Court unanimously\nagreed does not encompass disparate-impact liability.\nUnder these provisions of the FHA, like §4(a)(1) of the\nADEA, a defendant must act “because of ” race or one of\nthe other prohibited grounds. That is, it is unlawful for a\nperson or entity to “[t]o refuse to sell or rent,” “refuse to\nnegotiate,” “otherwise make unavailable,” etc. for a forbid-\nden reason. These provisions of the FHA, unlike the Title\nVII provision in Griggs or §4(a)(2) of the ADEA, do not\nmake it unlawful to take an action that happens to ad-\nversely affect a person because of race, religion, etc.\n   The Smith plurality’s analysis, moreover, also depended\non other language, unique to the ADEA, declaring that “it\nshall not be unlawful for an employer ‘to take any action\notherwise prohibited . . . where the differentiation is based\n——————\n  9 The plurality stated:\n   “Paragraph (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer ‘to fail or refuse\nto hire . . . any individual . . . because of such individual’s age.’ (Em-\nphasis added.) The focus of the paragraph is on the employer’s actions\nwith respect to the targeted individual. Paragraph (a)(2), however,\nmakes it unlawful for an employer ‘to limit . . . his employees in any\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employ-\nment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\nemployee, because of such individual’s age.’ (Emphasis added.) Unlike\nin paragraph (a)(1), there is thus an incongruity between the employ-\ner’s actions—which are focused on his employees generally—and the\nindividual employee who adversely suffers because of those actions.\nThus, an employer who classifies his employees without respect to age\nmay still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classifica-\ntion adversely affects the employee because of that employee’s age—the\nvery definition of disparate impact.” 544 U. S., at 236, n. 6.\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)                    27\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\non reasonable factors other than age.’ ” 544 U. S., at 238\n(quoting 81 Stat. 603; emphasis added). This “otherwise\nprohibited” language was key to the plurality opinion’s\nreading of the statute because it arguably suggested\ndisparate-impact liability. See 544 U. S., at 238. This\nlanguage, moreover, was essential to JUSTICE SCALIA’s\ncontrolling opinion. Without it, JUSTICE SCALIA would have\nagreed with Justices O’Connor, KENNEDY, and THOMAS\nthat nothing in the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact\nsuits. See id., at 245–246. In fact, even with this “other-\nwise prohibited” language, JUSTICE SCALIA merely con-\ncluded that §4(a)(2) was ambiguous—not that disparate-\nimpacts suits are required. Id., at 243.\n   The FHA does not contain any phrase like “otherwise\nprohibited.” Such language certainly is nowhere to be\nfound in §§804(a) and 805(a). And for all the reasons\nalready explained, the 1988 amendments do not presup-\npose disparate-impact liability. To the contrary, legisla-\ntive enactments declaring only that certain actions are not\ngrounds for liability do not implicitly create a new theory\nof liability that all other facets of the statute foreclose.\n                             C\n   This discussion of our cases refutes any notion that\n“[t]ogether, Griggs holds[10] and the plurality in Smith\ninstructs that antidiscrimination laws must be construed\nto encompass disparate-impact claims when their text\nrefers to the consequences of actions and not just to the\nmindset of actors, and where that interpretation is con-\n\n——————\n  10 Griggs, of course, “holds” nothing of the sort. Indeed, even the plu-\n\nrality opinion in Smith (to say nothing of JUSTICE SCALIA’s controlling\nopinion or Justice O’Connor’s opinion concurring in the judgment) did\nnot understand Griggs to create such a rule. See 544 U. S., at 240\n(plurality opinion) (relying on multiple considerations). If Griggs\nalready answered the question for all statutes (even those that do not\nuse effects language), Smith is inexplicable.\n\f28 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nsistent with statutory purpose.” Ante, at 10. The Court\nstumbles in concluding that §804(a) of the FHA is more\nlike §4(a)(2) of the ADEA than §4(a)(1). The operative\nlanguage in §4(a)(1) of the ADEA—which, per Smith, does\nnot authorize disparate-impact claims—is materially\nindistinguishable from the operative language in §804(a)\nof the FHA.\n   Even more baffling, neither alone nor in combination do\nGriggs and Smith support the Court’s conclusion that\n§805(a) of the FHA allows disparate-impact suits. The\naction forbidden by that provision is “discriminat[ion] . . .\nbecause of ” race, religion, etc. 42 U. S. C. §3605(a) (em-\nphasis added). This is precisely the formulation used in\n§4(a)(1) of the ADEA, which prohibits “discriminat[ion] . . .\nbecause of such individual’s age,” 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1)\n(emphasis added), and which Smith holds does not author-\nize disparate-impact claims.\n   In an effort to explain why §805(a)’s reference to “dis-\ncrimination” allows disparate-impact suits, the Court\nargues that in Board of Ed. of City School Dist. of New\nYork v. Harris, 444 U. S. 130 (1979), “statutory language\nsimilar to §805(a) [was construed] to include disparate-\nimpact liability.” Ante, at 11. In fact, the statutory lan-\nguage in Harris was quite different. The law there was\n§706(d)(1)(B) of the 1972 Emergency School Aid Act, which\nbarred assisting education agencies that “ ‘had in effect\nany practice, policy, or procedure which results in the\ndisproportionate demotion or dismissal of instructional or\nother personnel from minority groups in conjunction with\ndesegregation . . . or otherwise engaged in discrimination\nbased upon race, color, or national origin in the hiring,\npromotion, or assignment of employees.’ ” 444 U. S., at\n132–133, 142 (emphasis added).\n   After stating that the first clause in that unusual stat-\nute referred to a “disparate-impact test,” the Harris Court\nconcluded that “a similar standard” should apply to the\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U.

Id., at 143.\nThis was so, the Court thought, even though the second\nclause, standing alone, may very well have required dis-\ncriminatory “intent.” Id., at 139. The Court explained\nthat the Act’s “less than careful draftsmanship” regarding\nthe relationship between the clauses made the “wording of\nthe statute . . . ambiguous” about teacher assignments,\nthus forcing the Court to “look closely at the structure and\ncontext of the statute and to review its legislative history.”\nId., at 138–140. It was the combined force of all those\nmarkers that persuaded the Court that disparate impact\napplied to the second clause too.\n  Harris, in other words, has nothing to do with §805(a) of\nthe FHA. The “wording” is different; the “structure” is\ndifferent; the “context” is different; and the “legislative\nhistory” is different. Id., at 140. Rather than digging up a\n36-year-old case that Justices of this Court have cited all\nof twice, and never once for the proposition offered today,\nthe Court would do well to recall our many cases explain-\ning what the phase “because of ” means.\n                             V\n  Not only is the decision of the Court inconsistent with\nwhat the FHA says and our precedents, it will have unfor-\ntunate consequences. Disparate-impact liability has very\ndifferent implications in housing and employment cases.\n  Disparate impact puts housing authorities in a very\ndifficult position because programs that are designed and\nimplemented to help the poor can provide the grounds for\na disparate-impact claim. As Magner shows, when dis-\nparate impact is on the table, even a city’s good-faith\nattempt to remedy deplorable housing conditions can be\nbranded “discriminatory.” 619 F. 3d, at 834. Disparate-\nimpact claims thus threaten “a whole range of tax, wel-\nfare, public service, regulatory, and licensing statutes.”\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 248 (1976).\n\f30 TEXAS DEPT.

The Texas Department\nof Housing and Community Affairs (the Department) has\nonly so many tax credits to distribute. If it gives credits\nfor housing in lower income areas, many families—\nincluding many minority families—will obtain better\nhousing. That is a good thing. But if the Department\ngives credits for housing in higher income areas, some of\nthose families will be able to afford to move into more\ndesirable neighborhoods. That is also a good thing. Either\npath, however, might trigger a disparate-impact suit.11\n   This is not mere speculation. Here, one respondent has\nsued the Department for not allocating enough credits to\nhigher income areas. See Brief for Respondent Inclusive\nCommunities Project, Inc., 23. But another respondent\nargues that giving credits to wealthy neighborhoods vio-\nlates “the moral imperative to improve the substandard\nand inadequate affordable housing in many of our inner\ncities.” Reply Brief for Respondent Frazier Revitalization\nInc. 1. This latter argument has special force because a\ncity can build more housing where property is least expen-\nsive, thus benefiting more people. In fact, federal law\noften favors projects that revitalize low-income communi-\nties.

(There\nis, of course, no hint of anything like this defense in the\ntext of the FHA. But then, there is no hint of disparate-\nimpact liability in the text of the FHA either.)\n   The effect of these regulations, not surprisingly, is to\nconfer enormous discretion on HUD—without actually\nsolving the problem. What is a “substantial” interest? Is\nthere a difference between a “legitimate” interest and a\n“nondiscriminatory” interest? To what degree must an\ninterest be met for a practice to be “necessary”? How are\nparties and courts to measure “discriminatory effect”?\n   These questions are not answered by the Court’s assur-\nance that the FHA’s disparate-impact “analysis ‘is analo-\ngous to the Title VII requirement that an employer’s\ninterest in an employment practice with a disparate im-\npact be job related.’ ” Ante, at 4 (quoting 78 Fed.

What is the FHA analogue of “job related”?\nIs it “housing related”? But a vast array of municipal\ndecisions affect property values and thus relate (at least\nindirectly) to housing. And what is the FHA analogue of\n“business necessity”? “Housing-policy necessity”? What\ndoes that mean?\n   Compounding the problem, the Court proclaims that\n“governmental entities . . . must not be prevented from\nachieving legitimate objectives, such as ensuring compli-\nance with health and safety codes.” Ante, at 21.

That is\ncertainly not the view of the Government, which takes the\nposition that a disparate-impact claim may be brought to\nchallenge actions taken with such worthy objectives as\nimproving housing in poor neighborhoods and making\nfinancially sound lending decisions. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 30, n. 7.\n   Because HUD’s regulations and the Court’s pronounce-\nments are so “hazy,” Central Bank, 511 U. S., at 188–189,\ncourts—lacking expertise in the field of housing policy—\nmay inadvertently harm the very people that the FHA is\nmeant to help. Local governments make countless deci-\nsions that may have some disparate impact related to\nhousing. See ante, at 19–20. Certainly Congress did not\nintend to “engage the federal courts in an endless exercise\nof second-guessing” local programs. Canton v. Harris, 489\nU. S. 378, 392 (1989).\n   Even if a city or private entity named in a disparate-\nimpact suit believes that it is likely to prevail if a disparate-\nimpact suit is fully litigated, the costs of litigation, in-\ncluding the expense of discovery and experts, may “push\ncost-conscious defendants to settle even anemic cases.”\nBell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 559 (2007).\nDefendants may feel compelled to “abandon substantial\ndefenses and . . . pay settlements in order to avoid the\nexpense and risk of going to trial.” Central Bank, supra,\nat 189. And parties fearful of disparate-impact claims\nmay let race drive their decisionmaking in hopes of avoid-\ning litigation altogether. Cf. Ricci, 557 U. S., at 563. All\nthe while, similar dynamics may drive litigation against\nprivate actors. Ante, at 19.\n   This is not the Fair Housing Act that Congress enacted.\n                            VI\n  Against all of this, the Court offers several additional\ncounterarguments. None is persuasive.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

No\none thinks that those who harm others because of pro-\ntected characteristics should escape liability by conjuring\nup neutral excuses. Disparate-treatment liability, however,\nis attuned to this difficulty. Disparate impact can be\nevidence of disparate treatment. E.g., Church of Lukumi\nBabalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 541–542 (1993)\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.); Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U. S.\n222, 233 (1985). As noted, the facially neutral require-\nments in Griggs created a strong inference of discrimina-\ntory intent. Nearly a half century later, federal judges\nhave decades of experience sniffing out pretext.\n                              B\n  The Court also stresses that “many of our Nation’s\nlargest cities—entities that are potential defendants in\ndisparate-impact suits—have submitted an amicus brief in\nthis case supporting disparate-impact liability under the\nFHA.” Ante, at 23–24.\n  This nod to federalism is puzzling. Only a minority of\nthe States and only a small fraction of the Nation’s munic-\nipalities have urged us to hold that the FHA allows\ndisparate-impact suits. And even if a majority supported\nthe Court’s position, that would not be a relevant consid-\neration for a court. In any event, nothing prevents States\nand local government from enacting their own fair housing\nlaws, including laws creating disparate-impact liability.\nSee 42 U. S. C. §3615 (recognizing local authority).\n  The Court also claims that “[t]he existence of disparate-\nimpact liability in the substantial majority of the Courts of\nAppeals for the last several decades” has not created “ ‘dire\nconsequences.’ ” Ante, at 24. But the Court concedes that\ndisparate impact can be dangerous.

In the Court’s words, it is “paradoxical to con-\nstrue the FHA to impose onerous costs on actors who\nencourage revitalizing dilapidated housing.” Ante, at 19.\nOur say-so, however, will not stop such costly cases from\nbeing filed—or from getting past a motion to dismiss (and\nso into settlement).\n                               C\n    At last I come to the “purpose” driving the Court’s anal-\nysis: The desire to eliminate the “vestiges” of “residential\nsegregation by race.” Ante, at 5, 23. We agree that all\nAmericans should be able “to buy decent houses without\ndiscrimination . . . because of the color of their skin.” 114\nCong. Rec. 2533 (remarks of Sen. Tydings) (emphasis\nadded). See 42 U. S. C. §§3604(a), 3605(a) (“because of\nrace”). But this Court has no license to expand the scope\nof the FHA to beyond what Congress enacted.\n    When interpreting statutes, “ ‘[w]hat the legislative\nintention was, can be derived only from the words . . .\nused; and we cannot speculate beyond the reasonable\nimport of these words.’ ” Nassar, 570 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 13) (quoting Gardner v.

Argued January 21, 2015—Decided June 25, 2015\nThe Federal Government provides low-income housing tax credits that\n  are distributed to developers by designated state agencies. In Texas,\n  the Department of Housing and Community Affairs (Department)\n  distributes the credits. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.\n  (ICP), a Texas-based nonprofit corporation that assists low-income\n  families in obtaining affordable housing, brought a disparate-impact\n  claim under §§804(a) and 805(a) of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), al-\n  leging that the Department and its officers had caused continued\n  segregated housing patterns by allocating too many tax credits to\n  housing in predominantly black inner-city areas and too few in pre-\n  dominantly white suburban neighborhoods. Relying on statistical ev-\n  idence, the District Court concluded that the ICP had established a\n  prima facie showing of disparate impact. After assuming the De-\n  partment’s proffered non-discriminatory interests were valid, it found\n  that the Department failed to meet its burden to show that there\n  were no less discriminatory alternatives for allocating the tax credits.\n  While the Department’s appeal was pending, the Secretary of Hous-\n  ing and Urban Development issued a regulation interpreting the\n  FHA to encompass disparate-impact liability and establishing a bur-\n  den-shifting framework for adjudicating such claims. The Fifth Cir-\n  cuit held that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the FHA,\n  but reversed and remanded on the merits, concluding that, in light of\n  the new regulation, the District Court had improperly required the\n  Department to prove less discriminatory alternatives.\n    The FHA was adopted shortly after the assassination of Dr. Martin\n  Luther King, Jr. Recognizing that persistent racial segregation had\n\f2     TEXAS DEPT.

Disparate-impact liability must be limited so employers and\n other regulated entities are able to make the practical business\n choices and profit-related decisions that sustain the free-enterprise\n system. Before rejecting a business justification—or a governmental\n entity’s analogous public interest—a court must determine that a\n plaintiff has shown that there is “an available alternative . . . practice\n that has less disparate impact and serves the [entity’s] legitimate\n needs.” Ricci v. DeStefano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145848\"><a href=\"/opinion/145848/ricci-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578. These cases provide\n essential background and instruction in the case at issue. Pp. 7–10.\n    (b) Under the FHA it is unlawful to “refuse to sell or rent . . . or\n otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to a person because\n of race” or other protected characteristic, §804(a), or “to discriminate\n against any person in” making certain real-estate transactions “be-\n cause of race” or other protected characteristic, §805(a). The logic of\n Griggs and Smith provides strong support for the conclusion that the\n FHA encompasses disparate-impact claims. The results-oriented\n phrase “otherwise make unavailable” refers to the consequences of an\n action rather than the actor’s intent. See United States v. Giles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102752\"><a href=\"/opinion/102752/united-states-v-giles/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span>\n <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48. And this phrase is equivalent in function and purpose to\n Title VII’s and the ADEA’s “otherwise adversely affect” language. In\n all three statutes the operative text looks to results and plays an\n identical role: as a catchall phrase, located at the end of a lengthy\n sentence that begins with prohibitions on disparate treatment. The\n introductory word “otherwise” also signals a shift in emphasis from\n an actor’s intent to the consequences of his actions. This similarity in\n text and structure is even more compelling because Congress passed\n the FHA only four years after Title VII and four months after the\n\f                   Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nADEA. Although the FHA does not reiterate Title VII’s exact lan-\nguage, Congress chose words that serve the same purpose and bear\nthe same basic meaning but are consistent with the FHA’s structure\nand objectives. The FHA contains the phrase “because of race,” but\nTitle VII and the ADEA also contain that wording and this Court\nnonetheless held that those statutes impose disparate-impact liabil-\nity.\n   The 1988 amendments signal that Congress ratified such liability.\nCongress knew that all nine Courts of Appeals to have addressed the\nquestion had concluded the FHA encompassed disparate-impact\nclaims, and three exemptions from liability in the 1988 amendments\nwould have been superfluous had Congress assumed that disparate-\nimpact liability did not exist under the FHA.\n   Recognition of disparate-impact claims is also consistent with the\ncentral purpose of the FHA, which, like Title VII and the ADEA, was\nenacted to eradicate discriminatory practices within a sector of the\nNation’s economy. Suits targeting unlawful zoning laws and other\nhousing restrictions that unfairly exclude minorities from certain\nneighborhoods without sufficient justification are at the heartland of\ndisparate-impact liability.     See, e.g., Huntington v. Huntington\nBranch, NAACP, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112153\"><a href=\"/opinion/112153/huntington-v-huntington-branch-naacp/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16–18. Recognition of disparate-\nimpact liability under the FHA plays an important role in uncovering\ndiscriminatory intent: it permits plaintiffs to counteract unconscious\nprejudices and disguised animus that escape easy classification as\ndisparate treatment.\n   But disparate-impact liability has always been properly limited in\nkey respects to avoid serious constitutional questions that might\narise under the FHA, e.g., if such liability were imposed based solely\non a showing of a statistical disparity. Here, the underlying dispute\ninvolves a novel theory of liability that may, on remand, be seen\nsimply as an attempt to second-guess which of two reasonable ap-\nproaches a housing authority should follow in allocating tax credits\nfor low-income housing. An important and appropriate means of en-\nsuring that disparate-impact liability is properly limited is to give\nhousing authorities and private developers leeway to state and ex-\nplain the valid interest their policies serve, an analysis that is analo-\ngous to Title VII’s business necessity standard. It would be paradoxi-\ncal to construe the FHA to impose onerous costs on actors who\nencourage revitalizing dilapidated housing in the Nation’s cities\nmerely because some other priority might seem preferable. A dispar-\nate-impact claim relying on a statistical disparity must fail if the\nplaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy or policies causing that\ndisparity. A robust causality requirement is important in ensuring\nthat defendants do not resort to the use of racial quotas. Courts must\n\f4   TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n          INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n  therefore examine with care whether a plaintiff has made out a pri-\n  ma facie showing of disparate impact, and prompt resolution of these\n  cases is important. Policies, whether governmental or private, are\n  not contrary to the disparate-impact requirement unless they are “ar-\n  tificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers.” Griggs, 401 U. S., at\n  431. Courts should avoid interpreting disparate-impact liability to be\n  so expansive as to inject racial considerations into every housing de-\n  cision. These limitations are also necessary to protect defendants\n  against abusive disparate-impact claims.\n     And when courts do find liability under a disparate-impact theory,\n  their remedial orders must be consistent with the Constitution. Re-\n  medial orders in disparate-impact cases should concentrate on the\n  elimination of the offending practice, and courts should strive to de-\n  sign race-neutral remedies. Remedial orders that impose racial tar-\n  gets or quotas might raise difficult constitutional questions.\n     While the automatic or pervasive injection of race into public and\n  private transactions covered by the FHA has special dangers, race\n  may be considered in certain circumstances and in a proper fashion.\n  This Court does not impugn local housing authorities’ race-neutral ef-\n  forts to encourage revitalization of communities that have long suf-\n  fered the harsh consequences of segregated housing patterns. These\n  authorities may choose to foster diversity and combat racial isolation\n  with race-neutral tools, and mere awareness of race in attempting to\n  solve the problems facing inner cities does not doom that endeavor at\n  the outset.

Con-\ngress has directed States to develop plans identifying\nselection criteria for distributing the credits. §42(m)(1).\nThose plans must include certain criteria, such as public\nhousing waiting lists, §42(m)(1)(C), as well as certain\npreferences, including that low-income housing units\n“contribut[e] to a concerted community revitalization plan”\nand be built in census tracts populated predominantly by\nlow-income residents. §§42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III), 42(d)(5)(ii)(I).\nFederal law thus favors the distribution of these tax cred-\nits for the development of housing units in low-income\nareas.\n   In the State of Texas these federal credits are distrib-\nuted by the Texas Department of Housing and Community\nAffairs (Department). Under Texas law, a developer’s\napplication for the tax credits is scored under a point\nsystem that gives priority to statutory criteria, such as the\nfinancial feasibility of the development project and the\nincome level of tenants.

The remedial order contained no explicit racial\ntargets or quotas.\n   While the Department’s appeal was pending, the Secre-\ntary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a\nregulation interpreting the FHA to encompass disparate-\nimpact liability. See Implementation of the Fair Housing\nAct’s Discriminatory Effects Standard, 78 Fed. Reg. 11460\n(2013). The regulation also established a burden-shifting\nframework for adjudicating disparate-impact claims.\nUnder the regulation, a plaintiff first must make a prima\nfacie showing of disparate impact. That is, the plaintiff\n“has the burden of proving that a challenged practice\ncaused or predictably will cause a discriminatory effect.”\n24 CFR §100.500(c)(1) (2014). If a statistical discrepancy\nis caused by factors other than the defendant’s policy, a\nplaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case, and there is\nno liability. After a plaintiff does establish a prima facie\nshowing of disparate impact, the burden shifts to the\ndefendant to “prov[e] that the challenged practice is neces-\nsary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory interests.” §100.500(c)(2). HUD has clari-\nfied that this step of the analysis “is analogous to the Title\nVII requirement that an employer’s interest in an em-\nployment practice with a disparate impact be job related.”\n78 Fed. Reg. 11470. Once a defendant has satisfied its\nburden at step two, a plaintiff may “prevail upon proving\nthat the substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory inter-\nests supporting the challenged practice could be served by\nanother practice that has a less discriminatory effect.”\n§100.500(c)(3).\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held, con-\nsistent with its precedent, that disparate-impact claims\nare cognizable under the FHA. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">747</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 (2014).\nOn the merits, however, the Court of Appeals reversed and\nremanded.

See, e.g., M. Klarman, Unfin-\nished Business: Racial Equality in American History 140–\n141 (2007); Brief for Housing Scholars as Amici Curiae\n22–23. By the 1960’s, these policies, practices, and preju-\ndices had created many predominantly black inner cities\nsurrounded by mostly white suburbs. See K. Clark, Dark\nGhetto: Dilemmas of Social Power 11, 21–26 (1965).\n   The mid-1960’s was a period of considerable social un-\nrest; and, in response, President Lyndon Johnson estab-\nlished the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disor-\nders, commonly known as the Kerner Commission. Exec.\nOrder No. 11365, 3 CFR 674 (1966–1970 Comp.). After\nextensive factfinding the Commission identified residen-\ntial segregation and unequal housing and economic condi-\ntions in the inner cities as significant, underlying causes of\nthe social unrest. See Report of the National Advisory\nCommission on Civil Disorders 91 (1968) (Kerner Com-\nmission Report). The Commission found that “[n]early\ntwo-thirds of all nonwhite families living in the central\ncities today live in neighborhoods marked by substandard\nhousing and general urban blight.” Id., at 13. The Com-\nmission further found that both open and covert racial\ndiscrimination prevented black families from obtaining\nbetter housing and moving to integrated communities.\nIbid. The Commission concluded that “[o]ur Nation is\nmoving toward two societies, one black, one white—\nseparate and unequal.” Id., at 1.

The\nstatute addressed the denial of housing opportunities on\nthe basis of “race, color, religion, or national origin.” Civil\nRights Act of 1968, §804, 82 Stat. 83. Then, in 1988,\nCongress amended the FHA. Among other provisions, it\ncreated certain exemptions from liability and added “fa-\nmilial status” as a protected characteristic. See Fair\nHousing Amendments Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 1619.\n                             II\n   The issue here is whether, under a proper interpretation\nof the FHA, housing decisions with a disparate impact are\nprohibited. Before turning to the FHA, however, it is\nnecessary to consider two other antidiscrimination stat-\nutes that preceded it.\n   The first relevant statute is §703(a) of Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 255.

Instead, the plain-\ntiffs argued §703(a)(2) covers the discriminatory effect of a\npractice as well as the motivation behind the practice.\nSection 703(a), as amended, provides as follows:\n      “It shall be an unlawful employer practice for an\n    employer—\n\f8   TEXAS DEPT.

Griggs, 401 U. S., at 426, n. 1.\n  In interpreting §703(a)(2), the Court reasoned that\ndisparate-impact liability furthered the purpose and de-\nsign of the statute.       The Court explained that, in\n§703(a)(2), Congress “proscribe[d] not only overt discrimi-\nnation but also practices that are fair in form, but discrim-\ninatory in operation.” Id., at 431. For that reason, as the\nCourt noted, “Congress directed the thrust of [§703(a)(2)]\nto the consequences of employment practices, not simply\nthe motivation.” Id., at 432. In light of the statute’s goal\nof achieving “equality of employment opportunities and\nremov[ing] barriers that have operated in the past” to\nfavor some races over others, the Court held §703(a)(2) of\nTitle VII must be interpreted to allow disparate-impact\nclaims. Id., at 429–430.\n  The Court put important limits on its holding: namely,\nnot all employment practices causing a disparate impact\nimpose liability under §703(a)(2). In this respect, the\nCourt held that “business necessity” constitutes a defense\nto disparate-impact claims. Id., at 431. This rule pro-\nvides, for example, that in a disparate-impact case,\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U.

Id., at 432; see also\nRicci, 557 U. S., at 587–589 (emphasizing the importance\nof the business necessity defense to disparate-impact\nliability). On the facts before it, the Court in Griggs found\na violation of Title VII because the employer could not\nestablish that high school diplomas and general intelli-\ngence tests were related to the job performance of its\nmanual laborers. See 401 U. S., at 431–432.\n   The second relevant statute that bears on the proper\ninterpretation of the FHA is the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602 et seq., as\namended. Section 4(a) of the ADEA provides:\n    “It shall be unlawful for an employer—\n       “(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any indi-\n    vidual or otherwise discriminate against any individ-\n    ual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-\n    tions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n    individual’s age;\n       “(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in\n    any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n    individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n    adversely affect his status as an employee, because of\n    such individual’s age; or\n       “(3) to reduce the wage rate of any employee in or-\n    der to comply with this chapter.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §623(a).\nThe Court first addressed whether this provision allows\ndisparate-impact claims in Smith v.

The Smith plurality emphasized\nthat both §703(a)(2) of Title VII and §4(a)(2) of the ADEA\ncontain language “prohibit[ing] such actions that ‘deprive\nany individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of such\nindividual’s’ race or age.” 544 U. S., at 235. As the plural-\nity observed, the text of these provisions “focuses on the\neffects of the action on the employee rather than the moti-\nvation for the action of the employer” and therefore com-\npels recognition of disparate-impact liability. Id., at 236.\nIn a separate opinion, JUSTICE SCALIA found the ADEA’s\ntext ambiguous and thus deferred under Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), to an Equal Employment Opportunity Com-\nmission regulation interpreting the ADEA to impose\ndisparate-impact liability, see 544 U. S., at 243–247 (opin-\nion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n   Together, Griggs holds and the plurality in Smith in-\nstructs that antidiscrimination laws must be construed to\nencompass disparate-impact claims when their text refers\nto the consequences of actions and not just to the mindset\nof actors, and where that interpretation is consistent with\nstatutory purpose. These cases also teach that disparate-\nimpact liability must be limited so employers and other\nregulated entities are able to make the practical business\nchoices and profit-related decisions that sustain a vibrant\nand dynamic free-enterprise system. And before rejecting\na business justification—or, in the case of a governmental\nentity, an analogous public interest—a court must deter-\nmine that a plaintiff has shown that there is “an available\nalternative . . . practice that has less disparate impact and\nserves the [entity’s] legitimate needs.” Ricci, supra, at\n578. The cases interpreting Title VII and the ADEA pro-\nvide essential background and instruction in the case now\nbefore the Court.\n   Turning to the FHA, the ICP relies on two provisions.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSection 804(a) provides that it shall be unlawful:\n       “To refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona\n    fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or\n    rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a\n    dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion,\n    sex, familial status, or national origin.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n    §3604(a).\nHere, the phrase “otherwise make unavailable” is of cen-\ntral importance to the analysis that follows.\n  Section 805(a), in turn, provides:\n      “It shall be unlawful for any person or other entity\n    whose business includes engaging in real estate-\n    related transactions to discriminate against any per-\n    son in making available such a transaction, or in the\n    terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of\n    race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or\n    national origin.” §3605(a).\n   Applied here, the logic of Griggs and Smith provides\nstrong support for the conclusion that the FHA encom-\npasses disparate-impact claims. Congress’ use of the\nphrase “otherwise make unavailable” refers to the conse-\nquences of an action rather than the actor’s intent. See\nUnited States v. Giles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102752\"><a href=\"/opinion/102752/united-states-v-giles/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (1937) (explaining\nthat the “word ‘make’ has many meanings, among them\n‘[t]o cause to exist, appear or occur’ ” (quoting Webster’s\nNew International Dictionary 1485 (2d ed. 1934))). This\nresults-oriented language counsels in favor of recognizing\ndisparate-impact liability. See Smith, supra, at 236. The\nCourt has construed statutory language similar to §805(a)\nto include disparate-impact liability. See, e.g., Board of\nEd. of City School Dist. of New York v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110160\"><a href=\"/opinion/110160/board-of-ed-of-city-school-dist-of-new-york-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140–141 (1979) (holding the term “discriminat[e]”\nencompassed disparate-impact liability in the context of a\nstatute’s text, history, purpose, and structure).\n\f12 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   A comparison to the antidiscrimination statutes exam-\nined in Griggs and Smith is useful. Title VII’s and the\nADEA’s “otherwise adversely affect” language is equiva-\nlent in function and purpose to the FHA’s “otherwise make\nunavailable” language. In these three statutes the opera-\ntive text looks to results. The relevant statutory phrases,\nmoreover, play an identical role in the structure common\nto all three statutes: Located at the end of lengthy sen-\ntences that begin with prohibitions on disparate treat-\nment, they serve as catchall phrases looking to conse-\nquences, not intent. And all three statutes use the word\n“otherwise” to introduce the results-oriented phrase.\n“Otherwise” means “in a different way or manner,” thus\nsignaling a shift in emphasis from an actor’s intent to the\nconsequences of his actions. Webster’s Third New Inter-\nnational Dictionary 1598 (1971). This similarity in text\nand structure is all the more compelling given that Con-\ngress passed the FHA in 1968—only four years after pass-\ning Title VII and only four months after enacting the\nADEA.\n   It is true that Congress did not reiterate Title VII’s\nexact language in the FHA, but that is because to do so\nwould have made the relevant sentence awkward and\nunclear. A provision making it unlawful to “refuse to\nsell[,] . . . or otherwise [adversely affect], a dwelling to any\nperson” because of a protected trait would be grammatically\nobtuse, difficult to interpret, and far more expansive in\nscope than Congress likely intended. Congress thus chose\nwords that serve the same purpose and bear the same\nbasic meaning but are consistent with the structure and\nobjectives of the FHA.\n   Emphasizing that the FHA uses the phrase “because of\nrace,” the Department argues this language forecloses\ndisparate-impact liability since “[a]n action is not taken\n‘because of race’ unless race is a reason for the action.”\nBrief for Petitioners 26.

The amendments included three exemptions from\nliability that assume the existence of disparate-impact\nclaims. The most logical conclusion is that the three\namendments were deemed necessary because Congress\npresupposed disparate impact under the FHA as it had\nbeen enacted in 1968.\n   The relevant 1988 amendments were as follows. First,\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCongress added a clarifying provision: “Nothing in [the\nFHA] prohibits a person engaged in the business of fur-\nnishing appraisals of real property to take into considera-\ntion factors other than race, color, religion, national origin,\nsex, handicap, or familial status.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §3605(c).\nSecond, Congress provided: “Nothing in [the FHA] prohib-\nits conduct against a person because such person has been\nconvicted by any court of competent jurisdiction of the\nillegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled sub-\nstance.” §3607(b)(4). And finally, Congress specified:\n“Nothing in [the FHA] limits the applicability of any rea-\nsonable . . . restrictions regarding the maximum number\nof occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.” §3607(b)(1).\n   The exemptions embodied in these amendments would\nbe superfluous if Congress had assumed that disparate-\nimpact liability did not exist under the FHA. See Gus-\ntafson v. Alloyd Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117902\"><a href=\"/opinion/117902/gustafson-v-alloyd-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574 (1995) (“[T]he\nCourt will avoid a reading which renders some words\naltogether redundant”). Indeed, none of these amend-\nments would make sense if the FHA encompassed only\ndisparate-treatment claims. If that were the sole ground\nfor liability, the amendments merely restate black-letter\nlaw. If an actor makes a decision based on reasons other\nthan a protected category, there is no disparate-treatment\nliability. See, e.g., Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v.\nBurdine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 254 (1981). But the amendments\ndo constrain disparate-impact liability. For instance,\ncertain criminal convictions are correlated with sex and\nrace. See, e.g., Kimbrough v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n98 (2007) (discussing the racial disparity in convictions for\ncrack cocaine offenses). By adding an exemption from\nliability for exclusionary practices aimed at individuals\nwith drug convictions, Congress ensured disparate-impact\nliability would not lie if a landlord excluded tenants with\nsuch convictions. The same is true of the provision allow-\ning for reasonable restrictions on occupancy. And the\n\f16 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nexemption from liability for real-estate appraisers is in the\nsame section as §805(a)’s prohibition of discriminatory\npractices in real-estate transactions, thus indicating Con-\ngress’ recognition that disparate-impact liability arose\nunder §805(a). In short, the 1988 amendments signal that\nCongress ratified disparate-impact liability.\n  A comparison to Smith’s discussion of the ADEA further\ndemonstrates why the Department’s interpretation would\nrender the 1988 amendments superfluous. Under the\nADEA’s reasonable-factor-other-than-age (RFOA) provi-\nsion, an employer is permitted to take an otherwise pro-\nhibited action where “the differentiation is based on rea-\nsonable factors other than age.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §623(f )(1). In\nother words, if an employer makes a decision based on a\nreasonable factor other than age, it cannot be said to have\nmade a decision on the basis of an employee’s age. Accord-\ning to the Smith plurality, the RFOA provision “plays its\nprincipal role” “in cases involving disparate-impact claims”\n“by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attribut-\nable to a nonage factor that was ‘reasonable.’ ” 544 U. S.,\nat 239. The plurality thus reasoned that the RFOA provi-\nsion would be “simply unnecessary to avoid liability under\nthe ADEA” if liability were limited to disparate-treatment\nclaims. Id., at 238.\n  A similar logic applies here. If a real-estate appraiser\ntook into account a neighborhood’s schools, one could not\nsay the appraiser acted because of race. And by embed-\nding </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §3605(c)’s exemption in the statutory text,\nCongress ensured that disparate-impact liability would\nnot be allowed either. Indeed, the inference of disparate-\nimpact liability is even stronger here than it was in Smith.\nAs originally enacted, the ADEA included the RFOA pro-\nvision, see §4(f)(1), 81 Stat. 603, whereas here Congress\nadded the relevant exemptions in the 1988 amendments\nagainst the backdrop of the uniform view of the Courts of\nAppeals that the FHA imposed disparate-impact liability.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Recognition of disparate-impact claims is consistent\nwith the FHA’s central purpose. See Smith, supra, at 235\n(plurality opinion); Griggs, 401 U. S., at 432. The FHA,\nlike Title VII and the ADEA, was enacted to eradicate\ndiscriminatory practices within a sector of our Nation’s\neconomy. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §3601 (“It is the policy of the\nUnited States to provide, within constitutional limitations,\nfor fair housing throughout the United States”); H. R.\nRep., at 15 (explaining the FHA “provides a clear national\npolicy against discrimination in housing”).\n   These unlawful practices include zoning laws and other\nhousing restrictions that function unfairly to exclude\nminorities from certain neighborhoods without any suffi-\ncient justification. Suits targeting such practices reside at\nthe heartland of disparate-impact liability. See, e.g.,\nHuntington, 488 U.

The availability of disparate-impact\nliability, furthermore, has allowed private developers to\nvindicate the FHA’s objectives and to protect their prop-\nerty rights by stopping municipalities from enforcing arbi-\ntrary and, in practice, discriminatory ordinances barring\nthe construction of certain types of housing units. See,\ne.g., Huntington, supra, at 18. Recognition of disparate-\nimpact liability under the FHA also plays a role in uncov-\nering discriminatory intent: It permits plaintiffs to coun-\nteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that\nescape easy classification as disparate treatment. In this\n\f18 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nway disparate-impact liability may prevent segregated\nhousing patterns that might otherwise result from covert\nand illicit stereotyping.\n   But disparate-impact liability has always been properly\nlimited in key respects that avoid the serious constitutional\nquestions that might arise under the FHA, for instance,\nif such liability were imposed based solely on a showing of\na statistical disparity. Disparate-impact liability man-\ndates the “removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary\nbarriers,” not the displacement of valid governmental\npolicies. Griggs, supra, at 431. The FHA is not an in-\nstrument to force housing authorities to reorder their\npriorities. Rather, the FHA aims to ensure that those\npriorities can be achieved without arbitrarily creating\ndiscriminatory effects or perpetuating segregation.\n   Unlike the heartland of disparate-impact suits targeting\nartificial barriers to housing, the underlying dispute in\nthis case involves a novel theory of liability. See Seicsh-\nnaydre, Is Disparate Impact Having Any Impact? An\nAppellate Analysis of Forty Years of Disparate Impact\nClaims Under the Fair Housing Act, 63 Am. U. L. Rev.\n357, 360–363 (2013) (noting the rarity of this type of\nclaim). This case, on remand, may be seen simply as an\nattempt to second-guess which of two reasonable ap-\nproaches a housing authority should follow in the sound\nexercise of its discretion in allocating tax credits for low-\nincome housing.\n   An important and appropriate means of ensuring that\ndisparate-impact liability is properly limited is to give\nhousing authorities and private developers leeway to state\nand explain the valid interest served by their policies.\nThis step of the analysis is analogous to the business\nnecessity standard under Title VII and provides a defense\nagainst disparate-impact liability. See 78 Fed. Reg. 11470\n(explaining that HUD did not use the phrase “business\nnecessity” because that “phrase may not be easily under-\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstood to cover the full scope of practices covered by the\nFair Housing Act, which applies to individuals, busi-\nnesses, nonprofit organizations, and public entities”). As the\nCourt explained in Ricci, an entity “could be liable for\ndisparate-impact discrimination only if the [challenged\npractices] were not job related and consistent with busi-\nness necessity.” 557 U. S., at 587. Just as an employer\nmay maintain a workplace requirement that causes a\ndisparate impact if that requirement is a “reasonable\nmeasure[ment] of job performance,” Griggs, supra, at 436,\nso too must housing authorities and private developers be\nallowed to maintain a policy if they can prove it is neces-\nsary to achieve a valid interest. To be sure, the Title VII\nframework may not transfer exactly to the fair-housing\ncontext, but the comparison suffices for present purposes.\n   It would be paradoxical to construe the FHA to impose\nonerous costs on actors who encourage revitalizing dilapi-\ndated housing in our Nation’s cities merely because some\nother priority might seem preferable. Entrepreneurs must\nbe given latitude to consider market factors. Zoning offi-\ncials, moreover, must often make decisions based on a mix\nof factors, both objective (such as cost and traffic patterns)\nand, at least to some extent, subjective (such as preserving\nhistoric architecture). These factors contribute to a com-\nmunity’s quality of life and are legitimate concerns for\nhousing authorities. The FHA does not decree a particular\nvision of urban development; and it does not put housing\nauthorities and private developers in a double bind of\nliability, subject to suit whether they choose to rejuvenate\na city core or to promote new low-income housing in sub-\nurban communities. As HUD itself recognized in its re-\ncent rulemaking, disparate-impact liability “does not\nmandate that affordable housing be located in neighbor-\nhoods with any particular characteristic.” 78 Fed. Reg.\n11476.\n   In a similar vein, a disparate-impact claim that relies on\n\f20 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\na statistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff cannot point\nto a defendant’s policy or policies causing that disparity.\nA robust causality requirement ensures that “[r]acial\nimbalance . . . does not, without more, establish a prima\nfacie case of disparate impact” and thus protects defend-\nants from being held liable for racial disparities they did\nnot create.

Without adequate safeguards at\nthe prima facie stage, disparate-impact liability might\ncause race to be used and considered in a pervasive way\nand “would almost inexorably lead” governmental or\nprivate entities to use “numerical quotas,” and serious\nconstitutional questions then could arise. 490 U. S., at 653.\n  The litigation at issue here provides an example. From\nthe standpoint of determining advantage or disadvantage\nto racial minorities, it seems difficult to say as a general\nmatter that a decision to build low-income housing in a\nblighted inner-city neighborhood instead of a suburb is\ndiscriminatory, or vice versa. If those sorts of judgments\nare subject to challenge without adequate safeguards,\nthen there is a danger that potential defendants may\nadopt racial quotas—a circumstance that itself raises\nserious constitutional concerns.\n  Courts must therefore examine with care whether a\nplaintiff has made out a prima facie case of disparate\nimpact and prompt resolution of these cases is important.\nA plaintiff who fails to allege facts at the pleading stage or\nproduce statistical evidence demonstrating a causal con-\nnection cannot make out a prima facie case of disparate\nimpact. For instance, a plaintiff challenging the decision\nof a private developer to construct a new building in one\nlocation rather than another will not easily be able to\nshow this is a policy causing a disparate impact because\nsuch a one-time decision may not be a policy at all. It may\nalso be difficult to establish causation because of the mul-\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

And as Judge\nJones observed below, if the ICP cannot show a causal\nconnection between the Department’s policy and a dispar-\nate impact—for instance, because federal law substantially\nlimits the Department’s discretion—that should result\nin dismissal of this case. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">747</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 283–284 (specially\nconcurring opinion).\n   The FHA imposes a command with respect to disparate-\nimpact liability. Here, that command goes to a state\nentity. In other cases, the command will go to a private\nperson or entity. Governmental or private policies are not\ncontrary to the disparate-impact requirement unless they\nare “artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers.”\nGriggs, 401 U. S., at 431. Difficult questions might arise if\ndisparate-impact liability under the FHA caused race to be\nused and considered in a pervasive and explicit manner to\njustify governmental or private actions that, in fact, tend\nto perpetuate race-based considerations rather than move\nbeyond them. Courts should avoid interpreting disparate-\nimpact liability to be so expansive as to inject racial con-\nsiderations into every housing decision.\n   The limitations on disparate-impact liability discussed\nhere are also necessary to protect potential defendants\nagainst abusive disparate-impact claims. If the specter of\ndisparate-impact litigation causes private developers to no\nlonger construct or renovate housing units for low-income\nindividuals, then the FHA would have undermined its own\npurpose as well as the free-market system. And as to\ngovernmental entities, they must not be prevented from\nachieving legitimate objectives, such as ensuring compli-\nance with health and safety codes. The Department’s\namici, in addition to the well-stated principal dissenting\nopinion in this case, see post, at 1–2, 29–30 (opinion of\nALITO, J.), call attention to the decision by the Court of\nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit in Gallagher v.

Although the Court is reluctant to\napprove or disapprove a case that is not pending, it should\nbe noted that Magner was decided without the cautionary\nstandards announced in this opinion and, in all events, the\ncase was settled by the parties before an ultimate deter-\nmination of disparate-impact liability.\n    Were standards for proceeding with disparate-impact\nsuits not to incorporate at least the safeguards discussed\nhere, then disparate-impact liability might displace valid\ngovernmental and private priorities, rather than solely\n“remov[ing] . . . artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary\nbarriers.” Griggs, 401 U. S., at 431. And that, in turn,\nwould set our Nation back in its quest to reduce the sali-\nence of race in our social and economic system.\n    It must be noted further that, even when courts do find\nliability under a disparate-impact theory, their remedial\norders must be consistent with the Constitution. Remedial\norders in disparate-impact cases should concentrate on\nthe elimination of the offending practice that “arbitrar[ily]\n. . . operate[s] invidiously to discriminate on the basis of\nrac[e].” Ibid.

EEOC’s “own official history of\nthese early years records with unusual candor the com-\nmission’s fundamental disagreement with its founding\ncharter, especially Title VII’s literal requirement that the\ndiscrimination be intentional.” H. Graham, The Civil\nRights Era: Origins and Development of National Policy\n1960–1972, p. 248 (1990). The Commissioners and their\nlegal staff thought that “discrimination” had become “less\noften an individual act of disparate treatment flowing\nfrom an evil state of mind” and “more institutionalized.”\nJackson, EEOC vs. Discrimination, Inc., 75 The Crisis 16\n(1968). They consequently decided they should target\nemployment practices “which prove to have a demonstra-\nble racial effect without a clear and convincing business\nmotive.” Id., at 16–17 (emphasis deleted). EEOC’s “legal\nstaff was aware from the beginning that a normal, tradi-\ntional, and literal interpretation of Title VII could blunt\ntheir efforts” to penalize employers for practices that had a\ndisparate impact, yet chose “to defy Title VII’s restrictions\nand attempt to build a body of case law that would justify\n[their] focus on effects and [their] disregard of intent.”\nGraham, supra, at 248, 250.\n   The lack of legal authority for their agenda apparently\ndid not trouble them much. For example, Alfred Blum-\nrosen, one of the principal creators of disparate-impact\nliability at EEOC, rejected what he described as a “defeat-\nist view of Title VII” that saw the statute as a “compro-\nmise” with a limited scope. A. Blumrosen, Black Employ-\nment and the Law 57–58 (1971).

In 1966, for example, EEOC issued\nguidelines suggesting that the use of employment tests in\nhiring decisions could violate Title VII based on disparate\nimpact, notwithstanding the statute’s express statement\nthat “it shall not be an unlawful employment practice . . .\nto give and to act upon the results of any professionally\ndeveloped ability test provided that such test . . . is not\ndesigned, intended, or used to discriminate because of\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin,” §2000e–2(h)\n(emphasis added). See EEOC, Guidelines on Employment\nTesting Procedures 2–4 (Aug. 24, 1966). EEOC followed\nthis up with a 1970 guideline that was even more explicit,\ndeclaring that, unless certain criteria were met, “[t]he use\nof any test which adversely affects hiring, promotion,\ntransfer or any other employment or membership oppor-\ntunity of classes protected by title VII constitutes discrim-\nination.” 35 Fed. Reg. 12334 (1970).\n    EEOC was initially hesitant to take its approach to this\nCourt, but the Griggs plaintiffs forced its hand. After they\nlost on their disparate-impact argument in the Court of\nAppeals, EEOC’s deputy general counsel urged the plain-\ntiffs not to seek review because he believed “ ‘that the\nrecord in the case present[ed] a most unappealing situa-\ntion for finding tests unlawful,’ ” even though he found the\nlower court’s adherence to an intent requirement to be\n“ ‘tragic.’ ” Graham, supra, at 385. The plaintiffs ignored\nhis advice.

And if that\n“racial balancing” is achieved through disparate-impact\nclaims limited to only some groups—if, for instance, white\nbasketball players cannot bring disparate-impact suits—\nthen we as a Court have constructed a scheme that parcels\nout legal privileges to individuals on the basis of skin\ncolor.

That is no less true when judges are the ones doing the\nclassifying. See id., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at\n12); id., at ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (slip\nop., at 9). Disparate-impact liability is thus a rule without\na reason, or at least without a legitimate one.\n                             III\n  The decision in Griggs was bad enough, but this Court’s\nsubsequent decisions have allowed it to move to other\nareas of the law. In Smith, for example, a plurality of this\nCourt relied on Griggs to include disparate-impact liability\nin the ADEA. See 544 U. S., at 236. As both I and the\nauthor of today’s majority opinion recognized at the time,\nthat decision was as incorrect as it was regrettable. See\nid., at 248–249 (O’Connor, J., joined by KENNEDY and\nTHOMAS, JJ., concurring in judgment). Because we knew\nthat Congress did not create disparate-impact liability\nunder Title VII, we explained that “there [wa]s no reason\nto suppose that Congress in 1967”—four years before\nGriggs—“could have foreseen the interpretation of Title\nVII that was to come.” Smith, supra, at 260 (opinion of\nO’Connor, J.). It made little sense to repeat Griggs’ error\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Whatever deference is\ndue Griggs as a matter of stare decisis, we should at the\nvery least confine it to Title VII. We should not incorpo-\nrate it into statutes such as the Fair Housing Act and the\nADEA, which were passed years before Congress had any\nreason to suppose that this Court would take the position\nit did in Griggs. See Smith, supra, at 260 (opinion of\nO’Connor, J.). And we should certainly not allow it to\nspread to statutes like the Fair Housing Act, whose opera-\ntive text, unlike that of the ADEA’s, does not even mirror\nTitle VII’s.\n   Today, however, the majority inexplicably declares that\n“the logic of Smith and Griggs” leads to the conclusion that\n“the FHA encompasses disparate-impact claims.” Ante, at\n11. JUSTICE ALITO ably dismantles this argument. Post,\nat 21–28 (dissenting opinion). But, even if the majority\nwere correct, I would not join it in following that “logic”\nhere. “[E]rroneous precedents need not be extended to\ntheir logical end, even when dealing with related provi-\nsions that normally would be interpreted in lockstep.\nOtherwise, stare decisis, designed to be a principle of\nstability and repose, would become a vehicle of change . . .\ndistorting the law.” CBOCS West, Inc. v.

Making the same mistake in different\nareas of the law furthers neither certainty nor judicial\neconomy. It furthers error.\n   That error will take its toll. The recent experience of\nthe Houston Housing Authority (HHA) illustrates some of\nthe many costs of disparate-impact liability. HHA, which\nprovides affordable housing developments to low-income\nresidents of Houston, has over 43,000 families on its wait-\ning lists. The overwhelming majority of those families are\nblack. Because Houston is a majority-minority city with\nminority concentrations in all but the more affluent areas,\n\f12 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\nany HHA developments built outside of those areas will\nincrease the concentration of racial minorities. Unsurpris-\ningly, the threat of disparate-impact suits based on those\nconcentrations has hindered HHA’s efforts to provide\naffordable housing. State and federal housing agencies\nhave refused to approve all but two of HHA’s eight pro-\nposed development projects over the past two years out of\nfears of disparate-impact liability.

Since minorities were statistically more\nlikely to fall into “the bottom bracket for household ad-\njusted median family income,” they were disproportionately\naffected by those rent increases, i.e., there was a “dis-\nparate impact.” Id., at 834.

The answer is\nequally clear. The FHA does not authorize disparate-\nimpact claims. No such liability was created when the law\nwas enacted in 1968.

The result of these\nordinary rules of interpretation is that even without “be-\ncause of,” the phrase “make unavailable” likely would\nrequire intentionality.\n   The FHA’s inclusion of “because of,” however, removes\nany doubt. Sections 804(a) and 805(a) apply only when a\nparty makes a dwelling or transaction unavailable “be-\ncause of ” race or another protected characteristic. In\nordinary English usage, when a person makes something\nunavailable “because of ” some factor, that factor must be a\nreason for the act.\n   Here is an example. Suppose that Congress increases\nthe minimum wage. Some economists believe that such\nlegislation reduces the number of jobs available for “un-\nskilled workers,” Fuller & Geide-Stevenson, Consensus\nAmong Economists: Revisited, 34 J. Econ. Educ. 369, 378\n(2003), and minorities tend to be disproportionately repre-\nsented in this group, see, e.g., Dept. of Commerce, Bureau\nof Census, Detailed Years of School Completed by People\n25 Years and Over by Sex, Age Groups, Race and Hispanic\nOrigin: 2014, online at http://www.census.gov/hhes/\nsocdemo/education/data/cps/2014/tables.html (all Inter-\nnet materials as visited June 23, 2015, and available in\nClerk of Court’s case file).

Of the 32 college players selected by\nNational Football League (NFL) teams in the first round\nof the 2015 draft, it appears that the overwhelming major-\nity were members of racial minorities. See Draft 2015,\nhttp://www.nfl.com/draft/2015. See also Miller, Powerful\nSports Agents Representing Color, Los Angeles Sentinel,\nFeb. 6, 2014, p. B3 (noting “there are 96 players (76 of\nwhom are African-American) chosen in the first rounds of\nthe 2009, 2010, and 2011 NFL drafts”). Teams presuma-\nbly chose the players they think are most likely to help\nthem win games. Would anyone say the NFL teams made\ndraft slots unavailable to white players “because of ” their\nrace?\n   A third example. During the present Court Term, of the\n21 attorneys from the Solicitor General’s Office who ar-\ngued cases in this Court, it appears that all but 5 (76%)\nwere under the age of 45. Would the Solicitor General say\nhe made argument opportunities unavailable to older\nattorneys “because of ” their age?\n   The text of the FHA simply cannot be twisted to author-\nize disparate-impact claims. It is hard to imagine how\nCongress could have more clearly stated that the FHA\nprohibits only intentional discrimination than by forbid-\nding acts done “because of race, color, religion, sex, familial\nstatus, or national origin.”\n                             II\n  The circumstances in which the FHA was enacted only\nconfirm what the text says.

It is anachronistic to think that Congress author-\nized disparate-impact claims in 1968 but packaged that\nstriking innovation so imperceptibly in the FHA’s text.\n  Eradicating intentional discrimination was and is the\nFHA’s strategy for providing fair housing opportunities for\nall. The Court recalls the country’s shameful history of\nsegregation and de jure housing discrimination and then\njumps to the conclusion that the FHA authorized disparate-\nimpact claims as a method of combatting that evil.\nAnte, at 5–7. But the fact that the 1968 Congress sought\nto end housing discrimination says nothing about the\nmeans it devised to achieve that end. The FHA’s text\nplainly identifies the weapon Congress chose—outlawing\ndisparate treatment “because of race” or another protected\ncharacteristic. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §§3604(a), 3605(a). Accordingly,\nin any FHA claim, “[p]roof of discriminatory motive is\ncritical.” Teamsters, 431 U. S., at 335, n. 15.\n                              III\n    Congress has done nothing since 1968 to change the\nmeaning of the FHA prohibitions at issue in this case. In\n1968, those prohibitions forbade certain housing practices\nif they were done “because of ” protected characteristics.\nToday, they still forbid certain housing practices if done\n“because of ” protected characteristics. The meaning of the\nunaltered language adopted in 1968 has not evolved.\n    Rather than confronting the plain text of §§804(a) and\n805(a), the Solicitor General and the Court place heavy\nreliance on certain amendments enacted in 1988, but\nthose amendments did not modify the meaning of the\nprovisions now before us. In the Fair Housing Amend-\nments Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 1619, Congress expanded the\nlist of protected characteristics.

And, what is most relevant for present purposes,\nCongress added three safe-harbor provisions, specifying\nthat “[n]othing in [the FHA]” prohibits (a) certain actions\ntaken by real property appraisers, (b) certain occupancy\nrequirements, and (c) the treatment of persons convicted\nof manufacturing or distributing illegal drugs.3\n   According to the Solicitor General and the Court, these\namendments show that the FHA authorizes disparate-\nimpact claims. Indeed, the Court says that they are “of\ncrucial importance.” Ante, at 13. This “crucial” argument,\nhowever, cannot stand.\n                            A\n   The Solicitor General and the Court contend that the\n1988 Congress implicitly authorized disparate-impact\nliability by adopting the amendments just noted while\nleaving the operative provisions of the FHA untouched.\nCongress knew at that time, they maintain, that the\nCourts of Appeals had held that the FHA sanctions\ndisparate-impact claims, but Congress failed to enact bills\nthat would have rejected that theory of liability. Based on\nthis, they submit that Congress silently ratified those\n——————\n  3 These  new provisions state:\n  “Nothing in this subchapter prohibits a person engaged in the busi-\nness of furnishing appraisals of real property to take into consideration\nfactors other than race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or\nfamilial status.” §3605(c).\n  “Nothing in this subchapter limits the applicability of any reasonable\nlocal, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of\noccupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.

For Members of Congress who supported disparate\nimpact, the safe harbors left the favorable lower court\ndecisions in place. And for those who hoped that this\nCourt would ultimately agree with the position being\nurged by the United States, those provisions were not\nsurplusage. In the Circuits in which disparate-impact\nFHA liability had been accepted, the safe-harbor provi-\nsions furnished a measure of interim protection until the\nquestion was resolved by this Court. They also provided\npartial protection in the event that this Court ultimately\nrejected the United States’ argument. Neither the Court,\nthe principal respondent, nor the Solicitor General has\ncited any case in which the canon against surplusage has\nbeen applied in circumstances like these.7\n——————\n“the issue of intent versus effect—I am afraid that is going to have to be\ndecided by the Supreme Court.” Ibid.

Although other aspects of O’Gilvie\ntriggered a dissent, see id., at 94–101 (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.), no one quarreled with this self-evident piece of the\nCourt’s analysis. Nor was the O’Gilvie Court troubled that\nCongress’ amendment regarding nonphysical injuries\nturned out to have been unnecessary because punitive\ndamages for any injuries were not excluded all along.\n   The Court saw the flaw in the argument in O’Gilvie, and\nthe same argument is no better here. It is true that\nO’Gilvie involved a dry question of tax law while this case\ninvolves a controversial civil rights issue. But how we\nread statutes should not turn on such distinctions.\n   In sum, as the principal respondent’s attorney candidly\nadmitted, the 1988 amendments did not create disparate-\nimpact liability.

In Smith, the Court explained that the statutory\njustification for the decision in Griggs depends on lan-\nguage that has no parallel in the FHA. And when the\nSmith Court addressed a provision that does have such a\nparallel in the FHA, the Court concluded—unanimously—\nthat it does not authorize disparate-impact liability. The\nsame result should apply here.\n                               A\n  Rather than focusing on the text of the FHA, much of\nthe Court’s reasoning today turns on Griggs. In Griggs,\nthe Court held that black employees who sued their em-\nployer under §703(a)(2) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §2000e–2(a)(2), could recover without\nproving that the employer’s conduct—requiring a high\nschool diploma or a qualifying grade on a standardized\ntest as a condition for certain jobs—was motivated by a\ndiscriminatory intent. Instead, the Court held that, un-\nless it was proved that the requirements were “job re-\nlated,” the plaintiffs could recover by showing that the re-\nquirements “operated to render ineligible a markedly\ndisproportionate number of Negroes.” 401 U. S., at 429.\n  Griggs was a case in which an intent to discriminate\nmight well have been inferred. The company had “openly\ndiscriminated on the basis of race” prior to the date on\n\f22 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nwhich the 1964 Civil Rights Act took effect. Id., at 427.\nOnce that date arrived, the company imposed new educa-\ntional requirements for those wishing to transfer into jobs\nthat were then being performed by white workers who did\nnot meet those requirements. Id., at 427–428. These new\nhurdles disproportionately burdened African-Americans,\nwho had “long received inferior education in segregated\nschools.” Id., at 430. Despite all this, the lower courts\nfound that the company lacked discriminatory intent. See\nid., at 428. By convention, we do not overturn a finding of\nfact accepted by two lower courts, see, e.g., Rogers v.\nLodge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110790\"><a href=\"/opinion/110790/rogers-v-lodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 623 (1982); Blau v.

The only reference to\n§703(a)(2) of the 1964 Civil Rights Act appears in a single\nfootnote that reproduces the statutory text but makes no\neffort to explain how it encompasses a disparate-impact\nclaim. See 401 U. S., at 426, n. 1. Instead, the Court\nbased its decision on the “objective” of Title VII, which the\nCourt described as “achiev[ing] equality of employment\nopportunities and remov[ing] barriers that have operated\nin the past to favor an identifiable group of white employ-\nees over other employees.” Id., at 429–430.\n   That text-free reasoning caused confusion, see, e.g.,\nSmith, supra, at 261–262 (O’Connor, J., concurring in\njudgment), and undoubtedly led to the pattern of Court of\nAppeals decisions in FHA cases upon which the majority\nnow relies. Those lower courts, like the Griggs Court,\noften made little effort to ground their decisions in the\nstatutory text. For example, in one of the earliest cases in\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Under\n§4(a)(1), the employer must act because of age, and thus\n\f26 TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v.\n         INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nmust have discriminatory intent. See 544 U.

Sections 804(a) and 805(a) of the FHA resemble\n§4(a)(1) of the ADEA, which the Smith Court unanimously\nagreed does not encompass disparate-impact liability.\nUnder these provisions of the FHA, like §4(a)(1) of the\nADEA, a defendant must act “because of ” race or one of\nthe other prohibited grounds. That is, it is unlawful for a\nperson or entity to “[t]o refuse to sell or rent,” “refuse to\nnegotiate,” “otherwise make unavailable,” etc. for a forbid-\nden reason. These provisions of the FHA, unlike the Title\nVII provision in Griggs or §4(a)(2) of the ADEA, do not\nmake it unlawful to take an action that happens to ad-\nversely affect a person because of race, religion, etc.\n   The Smith plurality’s analysis, moreover, also depended\non other language, unique to the ADEA, declaring that “it\nshall not be unlawful for an employer ‘to take any action\notherwise prohibited . . . where the differentiation is based\n——————\n  9 The plurality stated:\n   “Paragraph (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer ‘to fail or refuse\nto hire . . . any individual . . . because of such individual’s age.’ (Em-\nphasis added.) The focus of the paragraph is on the employer’s actions\nwith respect to the targeted individual. Paragraph (a)(2), however,\nmakes it unlawful for an employer ‘to limit . . . his employees in any\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employ-\nment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\nemployee, because of such individual’s age.’ (Emphasis added.) Unlike\nin paragraph (a)(1), there is thus an incongruity between the employ-\ner’s actions—which are focused on his employees generally—and the\nindividual employee who adversely suffers because of those actions.\nThus, an employer who classifies his employees without respect to age\nmay still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classifica-\ntion adversely affects the employee because of that employee’s age—the\nvery definition of disparate impact.” 544 U. S., at 236, n. 6.\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)                    27\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\non reasonable factors other than age.’ ” 544 U. S., at 238\n(quoting 81 Stat. 603; emphasis added). This “otherwise\nprohibited” language was key to the plurality opinion’s\nreading of the statute because it arguably suggested\ndisparate-impact liability. See 544 U. S., at 238. This\nlanguage, moreover, was essential to JUSTICE SCALIA’s\ncontrolling opinion. Without it, JUSTICE SCALIA would have\nagreed with Justices O’Connor, KENNEDY, and THOMAS\nthat nothing in the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact\nsuits. See id., at 245–246. In fact, even with this “other-\nwise prohibited” language, JUSTICE SCALIA merely con-\ncluded that §4(a)(2) was ambiguous—not that disparate-\nimpacts suits are required. Id., at 243.\n   The FHA does not contain any phrase like “otherwise\nprohibited.” Such language certainly is nowhere to be\nfound in §§804(a) and 805(a). And for all the reasons\nalready explained, the 1988 amendments do not presup-\npose disparate-impact liability. To the contrary, legisla-\ntive enactments declaring only that certain actions are not\ngrounds for liability do not implicitly create a new theory\nof liability that all other facets of the statute foreclose.\n                             C\n   This discussion of our cases refutes any notion that\n“[t]ogether, Griggs holds[10] and the plurality in Smith\ninstructs that antidiscrimination laws must be construed\nto encompass disparate-impact claims when their text\nrefers to the consequences of actions and not just to the\nmindset of actors, and where that interpretation is con-\n\n——————\n  10 Griggs, of course, “holds” nothing of the sort. Indeed, even the plu-\n\nrality opinion in Smith (to say nothing of JUSTICE SCALIA’s controlling\nopinion or Justice O’Connor’s opinion concurring in the judgment) did\nnot understand Griggs to create such a rule. See 544 U. S., at 240\n(plurality opinion) (relying on multiple considerations). If Griggs\nalready answered the question for all statutes (even those that do not\nuse effects language), Smith is inexplicable.\n\f28 TEXAS DEPT.

The Court\nstumbles in concluding that §804(a) of the FHA is more\nlike §4(a)(2) of the ADEA than §4(a)(1). The operative\nlanguage in §4(a)(1) of the ADEA—which, per Smith, does\nnot authorize disparate-impact claims—is materially\nindistinguishable from the operative language in §804(a)\nof the FHA.\n   Even more baffling, neither alone nor in combination do\nGriggs and Smith support the Court’s conclusion that\n§805(a) of the FHA allows disparate-impact suits. The\naction forbidden by that provision is “discriminat[ion] . . .\nbecause of ” race, religion, etc. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §3605(a) (em-\nphasis added).

Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110160\"><a href=\"/opinion/110160/board-of-ed-of-city-school-dist-of-new-york-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), “statutory language\nsimilar to §805(a) [was construed] to include disparate-\nimpact liability.” Ante, at 11. In fact, the statutory lan-\nguage in Harris was quite different. The law there was\n§706(d)(1)(B) of the 1972 Emergency School Aid Act, which\nbarred assisting education agencies that “ ‘had in effect\nany practice, policy, or procedure which results in the\ndisproportionate demotion or dismissal of instructional or\nother personnel from minority groups in conjunction with\ndesegregation . . . or otherwise engaged in discrimination\nbased upon race, color, or national origin in the hiring,\npromotion, or assignment of employees.’ ” 444 U. S., at\n132–133, 142 (emphasis added).\n   After stating that the first clause in that unusual stat-\nute referred to a “disparate-impact test,” the Harris Court\nconcluded that “a similar standard” should apply to the\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U.

Id., at 143.\nThis was so, the Court thought, even though the second\nclause, standing alone, may very well have required dis-\ncriminatory “intent.” Id., at 139. The Court explained\nthat the Act’s “less than careful draftsmanship” regarding\nthe relationship between the clauses made the “wording of\nthe statute . . . ambiguous” about teacher assignments,\nthus forcing the Court to “look closely at the structure and\ncontext of the statute and to review its legislative history.”\nId., at 138–140. It was the combined force of all those\nmarkers that persuaded the Court that disparate impact\napplied to the second clause too.\n  Harris, in other words, has nothing to do with §805(a) of\nthe FHA. The “wording” is different; the “structure” is\ndifferent; the “context” is different; and the “legislative\nhistory” is different. Id., at 140. Rather than digging up a\n36-year-old case that Justices of this Court have cited all\nof twice, and never once for the proposition offered today,\nthe Court would do well to recall our many cases explain-\ning what the phase “because of ” means.\n                             V\n  Not only is the decision of the Court inconsistent with\nwhat the FHA says and our precedents, it will have unfor-\ntunate consequences. Disparate-impact liability has very\ndifferent implications in housing and employment cases.\n  Disparate impact puts housing authorities in a very\ndifficult position because programs that are designed and\nimplemented to help the poor can provide the grounds for\na disparate-impact claim. As Magner shows, when dis-\nparate impact is on the table, even a city’s good-faith\nattempt to remedy deplorable housing conditions can be\nbranded “discriminatory.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 834.

The Texas Department\nof Housing and Community Affairs (the Department) has\nonly so many tax credits to distribute. If it gives credits\nfor housing in lower income areas, many families—\nincluding many minority families—will obtain better\nhousing. That is a good thing. But if the Department\ngives credits for housing in higher income areas, some of\nthose families will be able to afford to move into more\ndesirable neighborhoods. That is also a good thing. Either\npath, however, might trigger a disparate-impact suit.11\n   This is not mere speculation. Here, one respondent has\nsued the Department for not allocating enough credits to\nhigher income areas. See Brief for Respondent Inclusive\nCommunities Project, Inc., 23. But another respondent\nargues that giving credits to wealthy neighborhoods vio-\nlates “the moral imperative to improve the substandard\nand inadequate affordable housing in many of our inner\ncities.” Reply Brief for Respondent Frazier Revitalization\nInc. 1. This latter argument has special force because a\ncity can build more housing where property is least expen-\nsive, thus benefiting more people. In fact, federal law\noften favors projects that revitalize low-income communi-\nties. See ante, at 2.\n   No matter what the Department decides, one of these\nrespondents will be able to bring a disparate-impact case.\nAnd if the Department opts to compromise by dividing the\ncredits, both respondents might be able to sue.

(There\nis, of course, no hint of anything like this defense in the\ntext of the FHA. But then, there is no hint of disparate-\nimpact liability in the text of the FHA either.)\n   The effect of these regulations, not surprisingly, is to\nconfer enormous discretion on HUD—without actually\nsolving the problem. What is a “substantial” interest? Is\nthere a difference between a “legitimate” interest and a\n“nondiscriminatory” interest? To what degree must an\ninterest be met for a practice to be “necessary”? How are\nparties and courts to measure “discriminatory effect”?\n   These questions are not answered by the Court’s assur-\nance that the FHA’s disparate-impact “analysis ‘is analo-\ngous to the Title VII requirement that an employer’s\ninterest in an employment practice with a disparate im-\npact be job related.’ ” Ante, at 4 (quoting 78 Fed. Reg.\n11470). See also ante, at 18 (likening the defense to “the\nbusiness necessity standard”). The business-necessity\ndefense is complicated enough in employment cases; what\nit means when plopped into the housing context is any-\nbody’s guess. What is the FHA analogue of “job related”?\nIs it “housing related”? But a vast array of municipal\ndecisions affect property values and thus relate (at least\nindirectly) to housing. And what is the FHA analogue of\n“business necessity”? “Housing-policy necessity”? What\ndoes that mean?\n   Compounding the problem, the Court proclaims that\n“governmental entities . . . must not be prevented from\nachieving legitimate objectives, such as ensuring compli-\nance with health and safety codes.” Ante, at 21.

That is\ncertainly not the view of the Government, which takes the\nposition that a disparate-impact claim may be brought to\nchallenge actions taken with such worthy objectives as\nimproving housing in poor neighborhoods and making\nfinancially sound lending decisions.
