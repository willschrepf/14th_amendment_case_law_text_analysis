The trial court resolved the issues of title in a summary judgment, rejected the\n\nplaintiffs’ bad faith trespass claims against the working interest owners, and after a bench trial\n\nawarded damages for unpaid net revenues and royalties. The court declined to award attorney’s\n\nfees to any party. Five parties appeal from the judgment.\n\f                                                                                              04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n                              FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n        The underlying lawsuit arises out of a title dispute to mineral interests in a 690.54-acre\n\ntract known as the Baker Property, which comprises Section 3, Seale & Morris Survey A-434, in\n\nMcMullen County, Texas. In 2001, the period of time relevant to this appeal, there were four\n\nowners of the mineral estate in the Baker Property:\n\n        •   Burlington Resources, which owned a 25% mineral interest acquired from El Paso\n\n            Natural Gas Company which had entered into a written lease with P.R. Rutherford in\n\n            1966 known as the “El Paso Lease,” which was still in effect in early 2001.\n\n        •   The Baker Trusts, 1 represented by Bank of America (the “Bank”) as trustee, which\n\n            owned a 25% mineral interest and through Earl M. Baker had entered into a written\n\n            lease with P.R. Rutherford in 1965 known as the “Baker Lease,” which was still in\n\n            effect in early 2001.\n\n        •   Michael G. Rutherford and Patrick R. Rutherford, Jr., and their children, who are the\n\n            heirs of P.R. Rutherford, and Rutherford Oil Corporation (collectively, “the\n\n            Rutherfords”), who owned a 25% mineral interest subject to the Baker Lease.\n\n        •   BP America Production Company (“BP”), successor to Atlantic Richfield Company\n\n            (“ARCO”), which owned a 25% mineral interest that was not subject to a written\n\n            lease.\n\n        A joint operating agreement (“JOA”) covered the Baker Property (the “Unit Area”). The\n\nJOA was entered into in 1967 between ARCO, as a 25% mineral interest owner and the operator,\n\nand P.R. Rutherford, W. Earl Rowe, T.J. Goad, Patrick Rutherford, Jr., and Michael C.\n\n\n1\n  The beneficiaries of the “Baker Trusts” are the heirs of Earl M. Baker. The “Baker Trusts” include the Bettye\nBaker Brown Trust, u/w, f/b/o William David Deiss, the Bettye Baker Brown Trust, u/w, f/b/o Diane Elizabeth\nMysliwiec, the Bettye Baker Brown Trust, u/w, f/b/o Paula Jane Roberts, and the Bettye Baker Brown Trust, u/w,\nf/b/o Dorothy Baker Shaw 1966 Trust.\n\n                                                     -2-\n\f                                                                                                        04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nRutherford (the “P.R. Rutherford Group”) as the owners of the leasehold interests. The P.R.\n\nRutherford Group contributed the El Paso and Baker Leases (jointly, the “Leases”), covering\n\n75% of the mineral interests in the Baker Property, to the JOA. ARCO’s 25% mineral interest\n\nwas not subject to a written lease, but was contributed to the JOA so that the Baker Property\n\ncould be developed as a whole. The mechanism for this was Article 3 of the JOA, which created\n\na “deemed lease” 2 covering any unleased mineral interest that had been contributed to the Unit\n\nArea—i.e., ARCO’s unleased 25% mineral interest. Therefore, from 1967 forward, 100% of the\n\nmineral interest in the Baker Property was subject to the JOA, with ARCO serving as the\n\noperator of all drilling operations and production in the Unit Area. As a mineral owner, ARCO\n\nwas entitled to receive 25% of the 1/8 royalty under the JOA, and retained a possibility of\n\nreverter 3 of its mineral interest if the JOA ever terminated. After the JOA was signed, two\n\nsuccessful wells were drilled on the Baker Property (Baker Well Nos. 4 and 6).\n\n         The El Paso and Baker Leases each contained a “continuous production or operations”\n\nclause providing for continuation of the lease after the expiration of its primary term for as long\n\nas operations or production was on-going.                   The clauses were substantially the same, and\n\nprovided that the lease would “remain in force so long as drilling, mining or reworking\n\noperations are prosecuted (whether on the same or different wells) with no cessation of more\n\nthan sixty (60) consecutive days, and if they result in production, so long thereafter as oil or gas\n\nis produced from said land or land pooled therewith.” With respect to the term of the JOA,\n\n2\n  Article 3 of the JOA provides in relevant part, “If it develops that any interest owned and contributed by a party\nhereto is an unleased interest in the oil and gas rights, then such unleased interest shall be treated for all purposes of\nthis agreement as if it were an oil and gas lease covering such unleased interest on a form providing for the usual\nand customary one-eighth royalty . . . .” The parties refer to this provision as the “deemed lease,” so we will use that\nterm as well.\n3\n  A possibility of reverter is the future interest in a determinable fee grant that the mineral owner retains after\nexecuting an oil and gas lease. Luckel v. White, 819 S.W.2d 459, 464 (Tex. 1991); Bagby v. Bredthauer, 627\nS.W.2d 190, 197 (Tex. App.—Austin 1981, no writ) (possibility of reverter is a vested non-possessory interest in\nreal estate which can be assigned, transferred or sold in whole or part).\n\n                                                          -3-\n\f                                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nArticle 10 provided that the JOA “shall remain in full force and effect for as long as any of the\n\noil and gas leases subjected to this agreement remain or are continued in force as to any part of\n\nthe Unit Area, whether by production, extension, renewal or otherwise . . . .”\n\n         In 1986, ARCO entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Prize Energy (“Prize”),\n\nknown at that time as Petrus Energy, pursuant to which it sold all its rights under the JOA.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, ARCO retained its royalty interest and its right of reverter to\n\nits 25% mineral interest subject to the JOA’s “deemed lease,” which mineral interest would\n\nrevert back to ARCO free and clear if the JOA ever terminated. After the 1986 sale, Prize and\n\nthe P.R. Rutherford Group were the operators under the JOA on the Baker Property from 1986\n\nforward.\n\n         During June–August 2001, there was a 71-day period when no well on the Baker\n\nProperty was operating or producing in paying quantities. 4 None of the lessors were aware of\n\nthe cessation of operations, and no one raised any concern at the time. In the following years,\n\nPrize (through Cimarex Energy), and then Gruy Petroleum/Rutherford Oil, 5 continued\n\ndeveloping the Baker Property and drilled and completed seven more wells, the Baker Well Nos.\n\n7-13; four of those wells were producing wells.\n\n         In 2004, Cliff Hoskins, who had no previous connection to the Baker Property, conducted\n\nsome research on leases in the area, and became aware of the possible termination of the Baker\n\nProperty’s Leases and the JOA in August 2001. Hoskins, through his company Cliff Hoskins,\n\nInc. (“Hoskins”), contacted BP (f/k/a ARCO), and offered to buy its 25% mineral interest which\n\n4\n  At trial, Prize and the Rutherfords argued that flaring on one of the Baker wells conducted in June 2001 was\nsufficient to constitute “operations,” but the trial court disagreed, and this particular finding has not been appealed;\ntherefore, we must accept as true that there was no production or operations on the Baker Property for 71 continuous\ndays.\n5\n In April 2002, Gruy Petroleum Management Co. succeeded Prize as the operator on the Baker Property, with\nRutherford Oil Corporation acting as the operator for some of the wells, including Baker Well No. 11.\n\n\n                                                         -4-\n\f                                                                                                        04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nHoskins asserted had reverted to BP in August 2001—when the JOA had purportedly terminated\n\ndue to the cessation of operations. On June 25, 2004, BP sent a letter to Magnum Hunter\n\nResources, Inc. 6 questioning whether production on the Baker Property had ceased between June\n\n2001 and April 2002, and requesting documents to confirm production—including meter\n\nreadings, allocation statements, and check details relating to payments for gas produced.\n\nMagnum Hunter responded that, “[t]here has been continuous production, under the terms of the\n\nleases and the operating agreement . . .,” and provided none of the requested documents.\n\n           Hoskins filed suit to quiet title on January 25, 2005. 7 One month later, in February 2005,\n\nthe Rutherfords, the Bank, and Burlington all signed ratifications of the El Paso and Baker\n\nLeases (the “Ratifications”), which purported to extend or renew the Leases that made up 75% of\n\nthe interests subject to the JOA; the other 25% was made up of ARCO/BP’s unleased interest\n\nwhich was contributed to the JOA. BP subsequently filed its own suit against Prize and the\n\nRutherfords in October 2005. In 2007, BP deeded its claimed (reverted) 25% mineral interest to\n\nHoskins, making the transfer retroactive to August 16, 2004. In the sale to Hoskins, BP reserved\n\na 6.25% nonparticipating royalty interest in the 25% mineral interest it conveyed to Hoskins.\n\n           In their suits against Prize and the Rutherfords, Hoskins and BP asserted claims to quiet\n\ntitle to their interests and for declaratory relief, plus claims for bad faith trespass,\n\ntheft/conversion, recovery of unpaid proceeds under the Texas Natural Resources Code, breach\n\nof contract, and recovery of attorney’s fees. The Bank, as trustee for the Baker Trusts, also\n\nasserted various claims against Prize and the Rutherfords, including claims for fraud, trespass,\n\nand theft, rescission of its Ratification, and to quiet title to the Baker Trusts’ mineral interest.\n\n\n\n6\n    The June 25, 2004 letter identifies Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc. as a successor operator to Prize under the JOA.\n7\n    Hoskins claimed standing based on a retroactive transfer of BP’s 25% mineral interest to Hoskins.\n\n                                                          -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       Competing summary judgment motions were filed by all the parties. On February 5,\n\n2009, the trial court signed an “Interlocutory Judgment” in which it:\n\n       1. Granted the summary judgment motion by Prize and the Rutherfords on “all\n       Plaintiffs’ claims of trespass,” and ordered that Plaintiffs “take nothing . . . on any\n       trespass claim in this cause;”\n\n       2. Granted the summary judgment motion by Prize and the Rutherfords on all\n       claims by the Bank, “including claims of fraud and rescission of the Ratification,”\n       and ordered that the Bank take nothing;\n\n       3. Granted the declaratory relief sought by Hoskins and BP, finding (i) the El\n       Paso and Baker Leases and the JOA all terminated in August 2001, at which time\n       Hoskins/BP’s mineral rights and interests reverted free and clear from the JOA,\n       making them unleased co-tenants; (2) from August 2001 through August 15,\n       2004, BP had an undivided 25% mineral interest, subject only to the non-\n       participating royalty interest; and (3) from August 16, 2004 forward, BP’s 25%\n       mineral interest passed to Hoskins, subject to BP’s retained royalty interest which\n       burdens Hoskins’ mineral interest and “does not burden any interests held by the\n       Defendants;”\n\n       4. Made the finding that “the Defendants as mineral owners or invitees of\n       mineral owners were not trespassers, or were alternatively ‘good faith\n       trespassers,’” as to Hoskins and BP after termination of the Leases and JOA;\n\n       5. Granted summary judgment “against all remaining claims and counterclaims\n       asserted by any party in this case;”\n\n       6.    Granted summary judgment “against all remaining affirmative defenses\n       asserted by any party to the extent those defenses would be inconsistent with the\n       Court’s rulings;”\n\n       7. Ordered the parties to work together to stipulate to “the revenues less costs\n       applicable to the Subject Acreage,” or a bench trial on “that remaining issue”\n       would be conducted; and\n\n       8. Noted the parties “dispute whether the issues of attorney’s fees and interest,\n       including such claims under the Texas Natural Resources Code, are still live\n       issues,” and stated the Court would determine those issues by further order or in\n       the final judgment, and that it had indicated it would “decline to award any\n       discretionary attorneys’ fees to any party in this case.”\n\n       The parties were unable to stipulate to the net revenues, so a bench trial was held on that\n\nissue. On September 11, 2009, the trial court signed its final judgment which incorporated its\n\n                                                -6-\n\f                                                                                                 04-09-00603-CV\n\n\ninterlocutory judgment “addressing the liability issues in this case,” and then awarded damages\n\nfor net revenues to Hoskins of $1,267,482, plus pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and\n\ndamages for net revenues and royalty revenues to BP of $3,252,827, plus pre-judgment and post-\n\njudgment interest. The court found the “underlying nature of Hoskins’ and BP’s suit was to\n\nobtain a determination of title,” and declined to award attorney’s fees to any party. The court\n\nmade an alternative finding, however, that each party had incurred reasonable attorney’s fees of\n\n$900,000 each. All parties appealed from the judgment. 8\n\n           In the main appeal, appellants Prize9 and the Rutherfords are aligned, 10 and appellees\n\nHoskins and BP are aligned. Each aligned party adopts the other party’s brief. In their appeal,\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords present the following arguments: (1) as a matter of law, the JOA did\n\nnot terminate and BP’s 25% mineral interest did not revert; (2) alternatively, the net revenues\n\ndamages awarded to Hoskins and BP should be reversed because there is no cause of action to\n\nsupport the damages award; (3) the royalties awarded to BP should be reversed because Prize’s\n\nand the Rutherfords’ interests are not burdened by BP’s royalty interest; (4) the pre-judgment\n\nand post-judgment interest awards to Hoskins and BP should be reversed; (5) the court should\n\nhave awarded Prize and the Rutherfords their attorney’s fees because they prevailed on their\n\nsummary judgment motions; (6) the court erred in imposing a future duty of accounting on Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords; and (7) as a conditional point in the event of a remand on BP’s contractual\n\nclaim for royalties, the affirmative defenses raised by Prize and the Rutherfords are still live.\n\nThe Rutherfords also raise two additional damages-related issues in the event this Court sustains\n\n8\n    Burlington Resources settled and is not involved in the appeal.\n9\n The “Prize” appellants/defendants are Prize Energy Resources, L.P., Prize Operating Company, Gruy Petroleum\nManagement Company n/k/a Cimarex Energy Co. of Colorado, Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc., Cimarex Energy\nCo., and Hunter Gas Gathering, Inc.\n10\n   In their appellants’ brief, the Rutherfords state they are fully aligned with Prize on all issues and adopt the\narguments presented in the Prize appellants’ brief.\n\n                                                           -7-\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nthe damages awards to Hoskins and BP: (1) the court erred in assessing damages against the\n\n“Rutherford Children” who own only leasehold interests and no mineral interests; and (2) the\n\ncourt erred in making the Rutherfords jointly and severally liable with Prize for the total\n\ndamages awarded to Hoskins and BP.\n\n                                        TITLE QUESTION\n\n        As noted, supra, the trial court granted declaratory relief to Hoskins and BP on the\n\nquestion of their title to the 25% unleased mineral interest. Specifically, the court held that, in\n\nAugust 2001, the El Paso and Baker Leases and the JOA terminated, and BP’s 25% mineral\n\ninterest reverted to it free and clear of the JOA; therefore, from August 2001 through August 15,\n\n2004, BP had clear fee simple title to its undivided 25% mineral interest. On August 16, 2004,\n\nHoskins acquired title to such 25% mineral interest from BP, subject only to BP’s retention of a\n\n6.25% nonparticipating royalty interest. In their appeal, Prize and the Rutherfords assert the\n\njudgment in favor of Hoskins and BP on their title claims should be reversed and rendered\n\nbecause, as a matter of law, the JOA never terminated; therefore, there was no reversion to BP of\n\nthe 25% mineral interest contributed to the JOA, and BP could not sell the 25% mineral interest\n\nto Hoskins. Thus, Hoskins owns no interest in the Baker Property. Under Prize’s and the\n\nRutherfords’ theory, BP still holds only the reversionary right to the 25% mineral interest plus\n\nthe right to receive royalties.\n\n        In support of their position, Prize and the Rutherfords make the following arguments: (1)\n\nas an initial matter, BP and Hoskins have no standing to assert that the JOA terminated because\n\nthey are not parties to the operating agreement; (2) the JOA never terminated because it was\n\ncontinued or revived by the Ratifications of the El Paso and Baker Leases signed by Burlington,\n\nthe Rutherfords, and the Bank; (3) the JOA never terminated because it was extended by the\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nconduct of the parties to the agreement, i.e., Prize and the Rutherfords continued to operate under\n\nthe JOA; and (4) even if the Leases and JOA terminated due to the cessation of\n\nproduction/operations, the “deemed lease” created by Article 3 of the JOA did not terminate\n\nbecause it contains no “cessation of production” clause.\n\n       In response, Hoskins and BP assert that the Baker and El Paso Leases terminated upon\n\nthe 71-day cessation of production in August 2001, and, according to its own terms, the JOA\n\nautomatically terminated at that time as well. Upon termination of the JOA in August 2001,\n\nBP’s 25% mineral interest contributed to the JOA was released from the “deemed lease,” and\n\nimmediately and automatically reverted to BP free and clear of the JOA. Thus, BP had clear title\n\nto its 25% mineral interest which it subsequently sold to Hoskins, retaining only a 6.25%\n\nnonparticipating royalty interest. In responding to the issues raised by Prize and the Rutherfords,\n\nHoskins and BP argue: (1) they have standing to assert the JOA terminated because its\n\ntermination directly affects their ownership interests; (2) Prize and the Rutherfords did not\n\nappeal the trial court’s finding that the Leases terminated in August 2001 due to the cessation of\n\noperations/production, and, based on that finding, the JOA automatically terminated in August\n\n2001 according to its own terms and the reversion to BP occurred; (3) the JOA was not\n\ncontinued, renewed, or revived by (i) the Ratifications signed in 2005 by the three lessors on the\n\nwritten Leases, (ii) the conduct of the operators in continuing to drill under the JOA after August\n\n2001, or (iii) the “deemed lease” provision of the JOA. As these issues are intertwined, we will\n\ndiscuss them together.\n\n       (1) Standing.      The threshold issue we must resolve is whether BP and Hoskins have\n\nstanding to sue to declare the JOA terminated and to clear their title to the 25% mineral interest\n\nwhich BP sold to Hoskins. As Hoskins’ ownership interest flows from, and is dependent on,\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nBP’s ownership interest, we will initially focus on BP. Resolution of the question of standing is\n\nintertwined with the title question of whether BP’s mineral interest reverted back to it in August\n\n2001 so that it could later be sold to Hoskins.\n\n       Standing is a component of subject matter jurisdiction and must be resolved first before\n\nthe merits of an issue may be addressed. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Inman, 252 S.W.3d 299, 304\n\n(Tex. 2008) (noting a court lacks jurisdiction over a claim made by a plaintiff without standing to\n\nassert it). To have standing, a plaintiff must be “personally aggrieved” and his injury must be\n\n“concrete and particularized, actual or imminent, not hypothetical.” Id. at 304-05. Standing\n\ncannot be waived and may be raised for the first time on appeal. Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air\n\nControl Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 445 (Tex. 1993). A party’s standing is determined at the time suit\n\nis filed. Id. at 446 n.9; In re Guardianship of Archer, 203 S.W.3d 16, 23 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 2006, pet. denied). In determining standing, we look to the facts alleged in the petition,\n\nbut may consider other evidence in the record if necessary to resolve the question of standing.\n\nBland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 555 (Tex. 2000).\n\n       Prize and the Rutherfords assert that neither BP nor Hoskins has standing to assert the\n\nJOA terminated because (i) neither is a party to the JOA, and (ii) neither is a third party\n\nbeneficiary of the JOA. BP and Hoskins respond that they have standing because BP is the\n\nsuccessor to ARCO, an original signing party to the JOA, who retained a contractual interest in\n\nthe JOA after the 1986 sale because its unleased 25% mineral interest was “contractually\n\ncommitted” to the JOA under Article 3; therefore, the reversionary interest retained by\n\nARCO/BP was directly tied to, and wholly dependent on, the termination of the JOA, giving BP\n\nstanding to sue to declare the JOA terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  - 10 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n        First, it is undisputed that neither BP nor Hoskins is a signing party to the JOA. The JOA\n\nwas executed in 1967 by the P.R. Rutherford Group as the operator and lessee under the Baker\n\nand El Paso Leases, and by ARCO as the operator and a mineral owner contributing its unleased\n\n25% mineral interest to the Unit Area. ARCO retained a reversionary interest pursuant to which\n\nits 25% mineral interest would revert back to ARCO if the JOA ever terminated; in addition, it\n\ncontracted for a royalty interest under the JOA, although while it was the operator ARCO never\n\npaid itself any royalties. In 1986, when ARCO sold all of its rights and obligations under the\n\nJOA to Petrus (predecessor of Prize), ARCO retained its right of reverter to its 25% mineral\n\ninterest upon termination of the JOA and its royalty interest. Petrus/Prize succeeded to ARCO’s\n\n50% working interest and became co-operator along with the P.R. Rutherford Group from 1986\n\nforward. BP succeeded to the rights ARCO retained in the 1986 sale, i.e., the reversionary\n\ninterest and the royalty interest.\n\n        Prize and the Rutherfords assert that because ARCO sold all its rights under the JOA in\n\n1986, and BP succeeded only to the royalty and reversionary interests retained by ARCO, BP has\n\nno standing to challenge the JOA because it is not a party to the JOA, and is not a third party\n\nbeneficiary of the JOA; alternatively, at most, BP is only an incidental beneficiary who may not\n\nbring an action on the JOA. We agree that, under well-settled contract principles, only the\n\nparties to a contract have the right to complain of a breach of the contract, with the exception that\n\na nonparty who proves the contract was made for his benefit, and that the contracting parties\n\nintended he benefit from the contract, may bring an action on the contract as a third party\n\nbeneficiary. See Grinnell v. Munson, 137 S.W.3d 706, 712 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2004, no\n\npet.); Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. Lenape Resources Corp., 870 S.W.2d 286, 295 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 1993), aff’d in part and rev’d in part on other grounds, 925 S.W.2d 565\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n(Tex. 1996); Bruner v. Exxon Co., 752 S.W.2d 679, 682-83 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1988, writ\n\ndenied). In contrast to a donee or creditor beneficiary, an “incidental beneficiary” who may\n\nreceive only an incidental benefit from the performance of the contract, does not have a right of\n\naction on the contract. MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. Tex. Utilities Elec. Co., 995 S.W.2d 647, 651\n\n(Tex. 1999); see Grinnell, 137 S.W.3d at 712-14 (surface estate owner, who as shareholder of\n\ncorporate mineral owner had indirect right to receive share of royalties when paid under oil and\n\ngas leases, was merely an incidental beneficiary who did not have standing to sue to declare\n\nleases terminated; he was not a party to leases and leases were not intended to benefit surface\n\nowner); see also Bruner, 752 S.W.2d at 682-83 (party with assignment of rentals was merely\n\nincidental beneficiary of lease, and had no standing to sue for wrongful termination of oil and\n\ngas lease).\n\n       Here, however, the critical factor is that BP is claiming an ownership interest by virtue of\n\nthe reversion of its mineral interest. An oil and gas lease generally conveys a fee simple\n\ndeterminable in the mineral estate with the possibility of reverter. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. v.\n\nPool, 124 S.W.3d 188, 192 (Tex. 2003) (lessee acquires ownership of all the minerals in place\n\nthat lessor owned and leased, subject to possibility of reverter in the lessor); Concord Oil Co. v.\n\nPennzoil Exploration and Prod. Co., 966 S.W.2d 451, 460 (Tex. 1998) (lessor also receives the\n\nrights bargained for under the lease, typically the payment of royalties, delay rentals and\n\nbonuses). A “‘possibility of reverter’ is the real property term of art for what the grantor owns as\n\na future interest in a determinable fee grant; it is the grantor’s right to fee ownership in the real\n\nproperty reverting to him if the condition terminating the determinable fee occurs.” Luckel v.\n\nWhite, 819 S.W.2d 459, 464 (Tex. 1991); Stephens County v. Mid-Kansas Oil & Gas Co., 113\n\nTex. 160, 254 S.W. 290, 295 (1923) (typical oil and gas lease actually conveys the mineral estate\n\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nas a determinable fee, less those parts reserved). Here, as successor to ARCO and the rights it\n\nreserved in the 1986 sale, BP held a right of reversion to a 25% interest in the mineral estate; in\n\nother words, BP held a right to fee simple ownership in the minerals which would revert to it\n\nupon occurrence of a specific condition–the termination of the JOA.           As the holder of a\n\nreversionary interest, BP had standing to bring a title claim to assert its ownership rights in the\n\nmineral estate. Cf. Coastal Oil & Gas Corp. v. Garza Energy Trust, 268 S.W.3d 1, 10-11 (Tex.\n\n2008) (holding lessor’s non-possessory reversion interest in the leased minerals gave him\n\nstanding to sue for trespass based on wrongful drainage, although he was required to prove actual\n\ninjury to recover damages for trespass against a non-possessory interest). Once the reversion\n\nwas triggered by termination of the JOA in August 2001, as discussed in detail below, BP held a\n\nfee simple 25% interest in the mineral estate and had standing to sue to declare the JOA\n\nterminated, and to clear its title. Hoskins, in turn, has standing because it acquired BP’s mineral\n\ninterest after the reversion. Accordingly, we reject Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ contention that\n\nBP and Hoskins lack standing to bring this lawsuit.\n\n       (2) Title Determination.         Having determined that BP and Hoskins have standing to\n\nbring the underlying lawsuit, we turn to the trial court’s determination of the title question. The\n\ntrial court made a finding that operations on the Baker Property ceased for more than sixty\n\nconsecutive days in June–August 2001, and that finding is not challenged on appeal; therefore,\n\nwe must accept that fact as the starting point for our analysis.\n\n       Termination of an oil and gas lease is a contractual matter. Wagner & Brown, Ltd. v.\n\nSheppard, 282 S.W.3d 419, 424 (Tex. 2008); Tittizer v. Union Gas Corp., 171 S.W.3d 857, 860\n\n(Tex. 2005) (oil and gas lease is a contract and its terms are interpreted as such). In construing\n\nan unambiguous oil and gas lease, we seek to enforce the parties’ intent as expressed within the\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nfour corners of the lease document. Tittizer, 171 S.W.3d at 860; Anadarko Petroleum Corp. v.\n\nThompson, 94 S.W.3d 550, 554 (Tex. 2002). We construe the lease as a whole, attempting to\n\nharmonize all its parts, and attribute to the lease’s language its plain, grammatical meaning\n\nunless it would undermine the parties’ intent. Anadarko, 94 S.W.3d at 554. A typical Texas\n\nmineral lease contains an habendum clause that defines the duration of the lease, typically\n\nproviding a relatively short fixed term of years as the primary term and then a secondary term for\n\n“as long thereafter as oil, gas or other mineral is produced.” Id.; Grinnell, 137 S.W.3d at 714. A\n\nlease that states its secondary term lasts for “as long as oil or gas is produced” automatically\n\nterminates if actual production ceases other than temporarily. Anadarko, 94 S.W.3d at 554;\n\nAmoco Prod. Co. v. Braslau, 561 S.W.2d 805, 808 (Tex. 1978).\n\n           Here, the Baker and El Paso Leases expressly provided for a fixed primary term, and\n\nupon its expiration for a secondary term during which\n\n           the lease shall remain in force so long as operations on said well or for drilling or\n           reworking of any additional well are prosecuted with no cessation of more than\n           sixty (60) consecutive days, and if they result in the production of oil, gas or other\n           mineral, so long thereafter as oil, gas or other mineral is produced from said land\n           or acreage pooled therewith. 11\n\nTherefore, the life of the secondary term of the Leases was dependent on the continuation of\n\noperations with no interruption of more than sixty consecutive days. Upon the undisputed\n\ncessation of operations for more than sixty consecutive days in June–August 2001, both the\n\nBaker and El Paso Leases automatically terminated according to their express language, without\n\nthe need for any legal action by the lessors. See Anadarko, 94 S.W.3d at 554; Braslau, 561\n\nS.W.2d at 808; W.T. Waggoner Estate v. Sigler Oil Co., 118 Tex. 509, 19 S.W.2d 27, 30 (1929);\n\nsee also BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Marshall, 288 S.W.3d 430, 451 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2008,\n\npet. granted); Woodson Oil Co. v. Pruett, 281 S.W.2d 159, 164-65 (Tex. Civ. App.—San\n11\n     The quoted language is from the Baker Lease; the El Paso Lease contains substantially the same provision.\n\n                                                         - 14 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nAntonio 1955, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (under terms of particular lease, parties stipulated that a cessation\n\nof production for more than sixty consecutive days was not “temporary,” and if re-working or\n\nadditional operations did not begin during the 60-day period the lease would terminate by its\n\nown terms; therefore, lessees were not entitled to reasonable time to remedy problem and resume\n\nproduction).\n\n       Termination of the Leases in August 2001 in turn triggered the automatic termination of\n\nthe JOA according to its own contractual language. Article 10 of the JOA expressly provided\n\nthat the agreement “shall remain in full force and effect for as long as any of the oil and gas\n\nleases subjected to this agreement remain or are continued in force as to any part of the Unit\n\nArea, whether by production, extension, renewal or otherwise.” The language of Article 10\n\nclearly makes the term of the JOA dependent on the continuation of the “leases subjected to this\n\nagreement;” it is undisputed that the Baker and El Paso Leases were the only leases that were\n\ncontributed to the JOA. When the Baker and El Paso Leases terminated due to the more than\n\nsixty-day cessation of operations, the JOA automatically terminated according to the express\n\nlanguage of Article 10. Wagner & Brown, 282 S.W.3d at 424; Anadarko, 94 S.W.3d at 554.\n\n       Upon termination of the Leases and JOA, the mineral interests immediately and\n\nautomatically reverted back to the mineral owners, without the need for any action; the unleased\n\n25% mineral interest contributed by BP’s predecessor ARCO immediately reverted to BP, free\n\nand clear of the JOA. See Sigler Oil, 19 S.W.2d at 30 (if a lease terminates, the fee interest\n\nreverts to the lessor without the lessor taking any legal action); see also Marshall, 288 S.W.3d at\n\n451 (“If the lease’s primary term expires when there is non-production and the lessee fails to\n\ncomply with any savings clause in the lease, the lease and the lessee’s determinable fee interest\n\n‘automatically terminates’ . . . and the fee interest reverts to the lessor without the lessor taking\n\n\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\f                                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nany legal action.”). At that point, in August 2001, upon the termination of the JOA and the\n\nconcurrent reversion to BP, BP became an unleased co-tenant in the Baker Property. Marshall,\n\n288 S.W.3d at 460; Ladd Petroleum Corp. v. Eagle Oil and Gas Co., 695 S.W.2d 99, 110-11\n\n(Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1985, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (if leases terminated, lessee would be considered\n\na co-tenant of the leasehold estate with right to enter tract and take into account its costs in\n\ncalculating damages owed to lessors) (citing Cox v. Davison, 397 S.W.2d 200, 203 (Tex. 1965)).\n\nHoskins’ co-tenant rights in the Baker Property likewise hinge on the termination of the JOA,\n\nand the ensuing reversion to BP of its 25% mineral interest contributed to the JOA—which\n\nmineral interest BP then sold to Hoskins.\n\n         Prize and the Rutherfords argue that the JOA never terminated because the Ratifications\n\nof the Baker and El Paso Leases signed by the Rutherfords, Burlington, and the Bank in February\n\n2005 either continued or renewed the JOA under Article 10. 12                         We disagree.        While the\n\nRutherfords, Burlington, and the Bank 13 may be able to effectively “extend” or “renew” the\n\nwritten Leases to which they are parties by executing a new lease through a “ratification”\n\ndocument signed after termination of the Leases, they may not bind a non-party’s interest such as\n\nBP’s interest, or strip away the mineral interest that automatically reverted to BP years before the\n\nRatifications. See Gasperson v. Christie, Mitchell & Mitchell Co., 418 S.W.2d 345, 350 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.—Fort Worth 1967, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (“If the former lease had actually expired\n\naccording to its terms, any new lease(s) taken would not be ‘in renewal and/or extension’ except\n\nby contract of the parties to the new lease(s) . . . even if the contract so provided it would only be\n\n12\n   The Ratifications contain language stipulating that the Baker and El Paso Leases have “been continuously\nperpetuated since [their date of execution] by either (i) the production of oil and/or gas in paying quantities or (ii)\noperations, or both.” In addition, in the Ratifications the lessor “ratifies and adopts” the Lease and executes a new\nlease.\n13\n   We note that the Bank is appealing the granting of summary judgment in favor of Prize and the Rutherfords on the\nissue of whether its Ratification is valid. This argument will be addressed later in the opinion.\n\n                                                        - 16 -\n\f                                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nbinding upon parties in privity to the new contract.”); see also Willson v. Superior Oil Co., 274\n\nS.W.2d 947, 950 (Tex. Civ. App.—Texarkana 1954, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (“An oil and gas lease\n\nexecuted by one co-tenant is valid as between the parties, but ineffectual as to the co-tenant of\n\nthe grantor.”). Each owner in a co-tenancy acts for himself, and has no authority to bind others\n\nmerely because of the co-tenancy relationship. Willson, 274 S.W.2d at 950.\n\n           Even the JOA recognizes that any unleased mineral interest must be affirmatively\n\n“contributed” to the Unit Area in order for the “deemed lease” provision of Article 3 to apply. 14\n\nThere is no evidence that, at any time after August 2001, BP or Hoskins ever contributed the\n\nreverted 25% mineral interest to the Unit; indeed, both have strongly argued the opposite.\n\nFurthermore, we reject Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ argument that the “deemed lease” provision\n\nin Article 3 of the JOA, by itself, was enough to prevent the JOA from terminating when the\n\nJOA’s duration was expressly made dependent on the continuation and existence of the\n\nunderlying written Leases.\n\n           We similarly reject the argument made by Prize and the Rutherfords that the JOA was\n\nextended by their conduct in treating the JOA as on-going, or, alternatively, that their conduct in\n\ncontinuing to develop the Baker Property created an implied joint operating agreement. This is a\n\nspecies of the same argument we rejected above. The argument ignores the fact that the mineral\n\ninterests immediately reverted to the lessors/owners upon the cessation of production, and\n\ntermination of the Leases and JOA, in August 2001. Even if Prize and the Rutherfords created\n\nan implied contract between themselves through their actions subsequent to August 2001, their\n\nactions could not recapture the mineral interests that immediately reverted upon termination of\n\nthe Leases and JOA. See Sigler Oil, 19 S.W.2d at 30; see also Marshall, 288 S.W.3d at 451.\n\n\n\n14\n     Article 3 applies to “any interest owned and contributed by a party hereto.” (emphasis added).\n\n                                                         - 17 -\n\f                                                                                  04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       In conclusion, according to the written documents’ unambiguous terms, the Leases\n\nautomatically terminated upon the more than sixty-day cessation of operations in August 2001,\n\ncausing the JOA to simultaneously terminate and BP’s 25% mineral interest contributed to the\n\nJOA to revert back to BP free and clear. Accordingly, we hold the trial court correctly resolved\n\nthe question of title, holding in relevant part that, “from August 2001 forward, the interests\n\nowned by Hoskins and BP in and to the Baker Ranch property . . . are as follows: (1) from\n\nAugust 2001 through August 15, 2004, BP had an undivided 25% mineral interest, subject only\n\nto a 1/64th non-participating royalty interest burden (herein the ‘BP 25% mineral interest’); and\n\n(2) from August 16, 2004 forward, the ‘BP 25% mineral interest’ passed to Hoskins, subject to\n\nBP retaining an undivided .06250 of 8/8ths royalty interest, which burdens the ‘BP 25% mineral\n\ninterest’ now owned by Hoskins.” Therefore, we overrule Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ Issue No.\n\n3 concerning title. Having resolved the issues of standing and title, we next address Hoskins’\n\nallegation of bad faith trespass against Prize and the Rutherfords.\n\n                                            TRESPASS\n\n       The parties contested whether Prize and the Rutherfords were bad faith trespassers\n\nbecause they continued to operate on the Baker Property after the cessation of operations in\n\nAugust 2001, and, in fact, drilled and completed Baker Well Nos. 7 through 13 after termination\n\nof the Leases and the JOA, and over BP’s protest. Hoskins, BP, and the Bank moved for\n\nsummary judgment declaring that the Leases and JOA terminated in August 2001 and to clear\n\ntitle to their respective interests. Prize moved for summary judgment, arguing: (1) that the JOA\n\nhad never terminated because of “production, extension, renewal, or otherwise;” (2) that Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords had the right to drill and operate on the Baker Property because they were\n\nco-tenants, or had the consent of a co-tenant; and (3) that Prize and the Rutherfords had\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f                                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nadversely possessed any interest allegedly reserved by BP or its predecessor. As we have\n\npreviously discussed, the trial court granted Hoskins’ and BP’s request for declaratory relief on\n\nthe title issues. As part of the declaratory relief granted on summary judgment, and re-stated in\n\nthe final judgment, the court made a finding that Prize and the Rutherfords “as mineral owners or\n\ninvitees of mineral owners were not trespassers, or alternatively, were ‘good faith trespassers,’\n\nimmediately after termination of the Leases and the 1967 JOA in August 2001 and at all times\n\nthereafter.” Furthermore, the court ordered that the plaintiffs “take nothing . . . on any trespass\n\nclaim in this cause.”\n\n           On cross-appeal, Hoskins and the Bank 15 assert the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment against them on their trespass claims because the record shows that Prize and the\n\nRutherfords committed bad faith trespass as a matter of law, and that all their affirmative\n\ndefenses fail. 16\n\n           (1) Standard of Review. We review both a no-evidence and a traditional motion for\n\nsummary judgment de novo. Tex. Mun. Power Agency v. Pub. Util. Comm’n of Tex., 253 S.W.3d\n\n184, 192 (Tex. 2007); Joe v. Two Thirty Nine Joint Venture, 145 S.W.3d 150, 156 (Tex. 2004).\n\nWe will uphold a traditional summary judgment only if the movant has established that there is\n\nno genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\n\non a ground expressly set forth in the motion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Am. Tobacco Co. v.\n\nGrinnell, 951 S.W.2d 420, 425 (Tex. 1997); Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548\n\n(Tex. 1985). A traditional motion for summary judgment is properly granted if the defendant\n\ndisproves at least one essential element of the plaintiff’s cause of action, or establishes all\n\n\n15\n     The Bank adopts Hoskins’ arguments on this issue.\n16\n  BP agrees with the trial court’s finding that Prize and the Rutherfords were, at most, good faith trespassers, and is\nnot appealing this finding.\n\n                                                         - 19 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nessential elements of an affirmative defense. D. Houston, Inc. v. Love, 92 S.W.3d 450, 454 (Tex.\n\n2002); Science Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 911 (Tex. 1997). If the movant is\n\nsuccessful in establishing its right to judgment as a matter of law, the burden then shifts to the\n\nnon-movant to produce evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact. City of Houston v.\n\nClear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678-79 (Tex. 1979).            In deciding whether the\n\nsummary judgment record establishes the absence of a disputed material fact, we view as true all\n\nevidence favorable to the non-movant and indulge every reasonable inference in favor of the\n\nnon-movant. Nixon, 690 S.W.2d at 548-49.\n\n       When reviewing a no-evidence motion for summary judgment, we review the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to the respondent against whom the no-evidence summary judgment was\n\nrendered, disregarding all contrary evidence and inferences. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168\n\nS.W.3d 802, 823 (Tex. 2005); Reynosa v. Huff, 21 S.W.3d 510, 512 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2000, no pet.). If the respondent brings forth more than a scintilla of probative evidence to raise\n\na genuine issue of material fact, a no-evidence summary judgment cannot properly be granted.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i); Reynosa, 21 S.W.3d at 512. More than a scintilla of evidence exists\n\nwhen the evidence “rises to a level that would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ\n\nin their conclusions,” while less than a scintilla exists when the evidence is “so weak as to do no\n\nmore than create mere surmise or suspicion.” Reynosa, 21 S.W.3d at 512 (internal citations\n\nomitted).\n\n       Where both parties file competing motions for summary judgment, and one is granted\n\nand one is denied, we review the record and consider all questions presented and render the\n\ndecision the trial court should have rendered. Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d\n\n656, 661 (Tex. 2005); Holy Cross Church of God in Christ v. Wolf, 44 S.W.3d 562, 566 (Tex.\n\n\n\n                                               - 20 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n2001). If a movant does not establish its entitlement to summary judgment as a matter of law,\n\nwe must remand the case to the trial court. Gibbs v. Gen. Motors Corp., 450 S.W.2d 827, 829\n\n(Tex. 1970). When summary judgment is sought on multiple grounds and the trial court’s order\n\ndoes not indicate the basis for its ruling, we will affirm the summary judgment if any theory\n\nadvanced by the movant is meritorious. Carr v. Brasher, 776 S.W.2d 567, 569 (Tex. 1989);\n\nVillanueva v. Gonzalez, 123 S.W.3d 461, 464 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, no pet.).\n\n       (2)   Analysis.   Hoskins argues the summary judgment record establishes bad faith\n\ntrespass as a matter of law. See Mayfield v. de Benavides, 693 S.W.2d 500, 504-05 (Tex. App.—\n\nSan Antonio 1985, writ ref’d n.r.e.); see also Wilen v. Falkenstein, 191 S.W.3d 791, 798 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied) (to recover damages for trespass to real property, plaintiff\n\nmust prove (1) ownership or lawful right to possess real property, (2) defendant made a physical,\n\nintentional and voluntary entry onto plaintiff’s land, and (3) defendant’s trespass caused injury to\n\nplaintiff). In the circumstances presented by this appeal, a bad faith trespasser is a lessee who\n\ncontinues to enter under an oil and gas lease after its termination without a good faith belief in\n\nthe existence of the lease. Marshall, 288 S.W.3d at 455; Mayfield, 693 S.W.2d at 504-06; see\n\nalso Gulf Production Co. v. Spear, 125 Tex. 530, 84 S.W.2d 452, 457 (1935) (“to act in good\n\nfaith in developing a tract of land for oil or gas, one must have both an honest and a reasonable\n\nbelief in the superiority of his title”). Hoskins points to the summary judgment evidence that: (i)\n\nthe Leases and the JOA terminated in August 2001, causing the lessors’ mineral interests to\n\nrevert back to them; (ii) after August 2001, Prize and the Rutherfords drilled seven additional\n\nwells on the Baker Property; and (iii) failed to pay Hoskins its share of the net value of the\n\nminerals produced, thereby causing it harm. Hoskins contends, and we agree, that because the\n\nsummary judgment record establishes all the elements of trespass, the burden shifted to Prize and\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nthe Rutherfords to prove justification for their trespass, i.e., a good faith belief in their right to\n\nenter and drill, in order to avoid a finding of bad faith. See Mayfield, 693 S.W.2d at 504-05; see\n\nalso Cain v. Rust Indus. Cleaning Serv., Inc., 969 S.W.2d 464, 470 (Tex. App.—Texarkana\n\n1998, pet. denied) (once plaintiff proves right of ownership of real property and unauthorized\n\nentry by defendant, burden of proof shifts to defendant to plead and prove consent or license as\n\njustification for entry).\n\n         As one of their affirmative defenses, Prize and the Rutherfords asserted their entry after\n\nAugust 2001 was justified under the law of co-tenancy which provides that a co-tenant has a\n\nright to explore, drill, and produce minerals from the common estate without consent from any\n\nother cotenant. Byrom v. Pendley, 717 S.W.2d 602, 605 (Tex. 1986); Cox, 397 S.W.2d at 201\n\n(each co-tenant has right to enter common estate and corollary right of possession). It is a well-\n\nestablished principle in Texas that a co-tenant has the right to extract minerals from common\n\nproperty without obtaining consent from the other co-tenants, subject only to a duty to account to\n\nthem for the value of any minerals taken, less the reasonable costs of production and marketing.\n\nWagner & Brown, 282 S.W.3d at 426.\n\n         We agree with the trial court that Prize and the Rutherfords established that, as a matter\n\nof law, they were co-tenants, or invitees of co-tenants, in the Baker Property after the Leases and\n\nJOA terminated in August 2001. It is undisputed that, at all times relevant to this case, the\n\nRutherfords held a 25% mineral interest in the Baker Property, in addition to acting as one of the\n\noperators on the property. The Rutherfords, along with the Bank, were lessors under the Baker\n\nLease.    When that Lease terminated in August 2001 due to the lack of operations, the\n\nRutherfords’ mineral interest subject to the Lease reverted back to them. From August 2001\n\nforward, the Rutherfords were therefore co-tenants in the Baker Property along with the other\n\n\n\n                                                - 22 -\n\f                                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nmineral interest owners—the Bank, Burlington, and BP. See Marshall, 288 S.W.3d at 459-60.\n\nPrize operated on the Baker Property as a co-operator with the Rutherfords, who were both\n\nmineral interest owners and co-operators.\n\n           We overrule this issue on cross-appeal and affirm the trial court’s summary judgment\n\nruling that, after the JOA’s termination in August 2001, Prize and the Rutherfords were not\n\ntrespassers because they were mineral owners or invitees of mineral owners in the Baker\n\nProperty.\n\n                                              AWARD OF DAMAGES\n\n           Having determined that the JOA terminated in August 2001, and having affirmed the trial\n\ncourt’s determination of title, we next turn to the issue of damages. Prize, the Rutherfords,\n\nHoskins, and BP all raise various challenges to the trial court’s award of damages to Hoskins and\n\nBP. We begin by addressing the arguments raised by Prize and the Rutherfords in the main\n\nappeal, then address the issues raised on cross-appeal by Hoskins and BP, and finally address the\n\nconditional issues raised separately by the Rutherfords.\n\nI.         Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ Challenges to Damages Award\n\n           As noted, the trial court awarded Hoskins $1,267,482 as its share of the net revenues\n\nfrom August 16, 2004 to October 31, 2008, and awarded BP $3,252,827 as its share of the net\n\nrevenues from August 1, 2001 to August 15, 2004 and its royalties from August 16, 2004 to\n\nOctober 31, 2008. 17           The trial court defined “net revenues” as the “gross revenues less\n\nreasonable and necessary expenses beneficial to the Subject Acreage and including the Baker\n\nWell Nos. 8, 11 and 13.” In addition, the court assessed pre-judgment and post-judgment\n\ninterest on both damages awards, and ordered that Prize and the Rutherfords are jointly and\n\nseverally liable for both damages awards.\n17\n     As noted, Hoskins’ acquisition of BP’s 25% mineral interest was made retroactive to August 16, 2004.\n\n                                                         - 23 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       In their appeal, Prize and the Rutherfords argue the damages awarded to Hoskins and BP\n\nmust be reversed, and a take-nothing judgment must be rendered, because (i) Hoskins and BP did\n\nnot recover under any legal theory that supports an award of damages, and (ii) all of the damages\n\nawarded to BP represent royalties, and Prize and the Rutherfords are not liable to BP for any\n\nroyalties after BP sold its mineral interest to Hoskins. In addition, Prize and the Rutherfords\n\ncomplain the final judgment improperly awards future relief.\n\n       (1) No Legal Theory to Support Damages.              In their Issue No. 1, Prize and the\n\nRutherfords assert that Hoskins and BP pled no theory of liability which supports the trial court’s\n\naward of damages consisting of net revenues and royalties. Prize and the Rutherfords argue that\n\nHoskins and BP are not entitled to an award of damages since they prevailed only on their claims\n\nfor declaratory relief. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.004(a) (West 2008). Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords rely on cases holding that a party cannot characterize a suit for money\n\ndamages, such as a contract dispute, as a declaratory judgment action in order to circumvent\n\nsovereign immunity or other restrictions. See, e.g., Seals v. City of Dallas, 249 S.W.3d 750, 757\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.).        They then conclude, without additional authority or\n\nargument, that because Hoskins and BP were seeking a declaration of their legal rights and status\n\nwith respect to the Baker Property, they necessarily had no right to recover any monetary\n\ndamages.\n\n       Here, both Hoskins’ and BP’s live pleadings included, among others, a claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief and to quiet title to BP’s 25% mineral interest which was transferred to\n\nHoskins, and a claim to recover their share of unpaid production proceeds, plus interest, under\n\nsections 91.402-.404 of the Texas Natural Resources Code (“TNRC”). TEX. NAT. RES. CODE\n\nANN. §§ 91.402-.404 (West 2001 & Supp. 2010). In its interlocutory summary judgment order,\n\n\n\n                                               - 24 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nthe court granted the requested declaratory relief quieting the title to the 25% mineral interest\n\nheld by BP and transferred to Hoskins, and granted summary judgment against BP and Hoskins\n\non their claims for trespass. In paragraph five, the court granted summary judgment against “all\n\nremaining claims and counterclaims asserted by any party in this case,” and against all remaining\n\naffirmative defenses asserted by any party. In paragraph seven, the court stated that counsel for\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords and counsel for Hoskins and BP were to “work together to attempt to\n\nstipulate to the revenues less costs applicable to the Subject Acreage,” and if unable to agree, a\n\nbench trial would be held “as to that remaining issue,” after which a final judgment would issue.\n\nThe trial court stated its intent to “issue any damage award on a ‘net’ basis (revenues less\n\nreasonable and necessary expenses),” but requested the parties provide information as to the\n\n“gross” basis for the record. Finally, in paragraph 8, the court noted that, “[t]he parties dispute\n\nwhether the issues of attorneys’ fees and interest, including such claims under the Texas Natural\n\nResources Code, are still live issues or have been previously dealt with on summary judgment,”\n\nand stated it would determine those issues in the final judgment. The court further stated, “In the\n\nevent that the Court rules that any of the subjects listed in this paragraph 8 are still live and\n\nundecided, then those undecided subjects are not covered by paragraph 5 [granting summary\n\njudgment against all remaining claims] of this order.” Reading the interlocutory judgment as a\n\nwhole, the court clearly intended that the issue of damages, and the calculation of the proper\n\namount of unpaid “revenues less costs,” was still a live issue to be determined by stipulation of\n\nthe parties or at a bench trial. If, as Prize and the Rutherfords contend, all claims for monetary\n\nrecovery had been denied by summary judgment, there would have been no need for the trial\n\ncourt to conduct a bench trial to determine the proper amount of damages to be awarded to\n\nHoskins and BP.\n\n\n\n                                               - 25 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       In its final judgment rendered after the bench trial on damages, the trial court made no\n\nexpress finding as to the legal theory under which it was awarding the “net revenues” damages to\n\nHoskins and BP (plus “royalty revenues”), but did explain its method of calculating the damages.\n\nThe court’s award of “net revenues” calculated as “gross revenues less reasonable and necessary\n\nexpenses beneficial to the Subject Acreage” conforms to the TNRC’s requirement that a payee is\n\nentitled to receive its share of the “proceeds derived from the sale of oil or gas from an oil or gas\n\nwell.” See TEX. NAT. RES. CODE ANN. §§ 91.401(1), 91.402(a) (West 2001); see also Concord\n\nOil, 966 S.W.2d at 461 (while statute was designed to protect royalty interest owners, it also\n\nencompasses working interest owners and operators); Headington Oil Co., L.P. v. White, 287\n\nS.W.3d 204, 209-10 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.). Moreover, the court’s\n\nassessment of pre-judgment interest on the damages awards is also consistent with recovery\n\nunder the TNRC, as section 91.403(a) expressly provides for pre-judgment interest as a penalty\n\nfor failure to meet the prompt payment requirements of the statute. See TEX. NAT. RES. CODE\n\nANN. § 91.403(a). In addition, the record of the bench trial clearly shows that BP’s and Hoskins’\n\nright to recover their share of the proceeds under the TNRC was a contested issue tried before\n\nthe court.\n\n       Prize and the Rutherfords assert there is “no cause of action” under the TNRC, and\n\ncharacterize it as merely a “prompt payment statute.” To the contrary, section 91.404 clearly and\n\nexpressly provides a payee with a cause of action for nonpayment of its share of mineral\n\nproceeds, and/or interest on those proceeds, under the TNRC. Id. § 91.404(c) (“A payee has a\n\ncause of action for nonpayment of oil or gas proceeds or interest on those proceeds as required in\n\nSection 91.402 or 91.403 of this code . . . .”); see Bright & Co. v. Holbein Family Mineral Trust,\n\n995 S.W.2d 742, 744 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1999, pet. denied); see also Anadarko E&P Co.,\n\n\n\n                                                - 26 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nLP v. Clear Lake Pines, Inc., No. 03-04-00600-CV, 2005 WL 1583506, at *2 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin July 7, 2005, no pet.) (mem. op.). As noted, both Hoskins and BP specifically pled for\n\ntheir share of unpaid production proceeds under the TNRC.\n\n       In addition, Prize and the Rutherfords argue they are relieved of any liability under the\n\nTNRC based on the absence of a signed division order by BP and Hoskins. We disagree. First,\n\nthe plain language of section 91.402(c) makes the existence of a signed division order only a\n\nprecondition for “payment” of a payee’s share of oil and gas proceeds, not a precondition to a\n\npayor’s liability to pay oil and gas proceeds. Section 91.402(c)(1) states, “As a condition for the\n\npayment of proceeds from the sale of oil and gas production to payee, a payor shall be entitled to\n\nreceive a signed division order from payee . . . .” TEX. NAT. RES. CODE ANN. § 91.402(c)(1).\n\nThe purpose of a division order is to provide the procedure for distributing the oil and gas\n\nproceeds to the payees “by authorizing and directing to whom and in what proportion to\n\ndistribute the sale proceeds.” Neel v. Killam Oil Co., 88 S.W.3d 334, 341 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 2002, pet. denied), disapproved of on other grounds by Hausser v. Cuellar, No. 04-09-\n\n00560-CV, 2011 WL 313757 (Tex. App.—San Antonio Feb. 2, 2011, no pet. h.) (en banc); see\n\nalso Gavenda v. Strata Energy, Inc., 705 S.W.2d 690, 691 (Tex. 1986). In other words, the\n\ndivision order is merely the mechanism for payment to a payee of its share of oil and gas\n\nproceeds. Second, the statute places the burden on the payor to submit a division order to the\n\npayee for its signature; it is not the royalty owner or mineral interest owner’s burden to draft\n\nits own division order, sign it, and submit it to the payor.           TEX. NAT. RES. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 91.402(c)(1) (“. . . a payor shall be entitled to receive a signed division order from payee . . .”);\n\nsee, e.g., Headington Oil, 287 S.W.3d at 207 (oil company that purchased leases with producing\n\noil and gas wells submitted division orders to the known interest owners for signature).\n\n\n\n                                                 - 27 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       In the absence of express findings in a bench trial, we presume the trial court impliedly\n\nmade all findings necessary to support its judgment, and affirm the judgment if it can be upheld\n\non any basis. Holt Atherton Indus., Inc. v. Heine, 835 S.W.2d 80, 83-84 (Tex. 1992); Point\n\nLookout West, Inc. v. Whorton, 742 S.W.2d 277, 278 (Tex. 1987) (per curiam). Here, construing\n\nthe entire texts of the final judgment and summary judgment order (incorporated by reference in\n\nthe final judgment) as a whole, it is clear the trial court (i) reserved from the summary judgment\n\nthe recovery by Hoskins and BP of their share of net revenues and royalties attributable to their\n\nrespective interests as declared by the court, and (ii) in the final judgment awarded damages to\n\nHoskins and BP consisting of “net revenues” and “royalty revenues” under section 91.402(a) of\n\nthe TNRC after conducting a bench trial to determine the specific amounts. See Whorton, 742\n\nS.W.2d at 278 (when a judgment is vague or contradictory, we resolve the conflict or ambiguity,\n\nif possible, by construing it as a whole with the goal of harmonizing and giving effect to\n\neverything the court has written); Constance v. Constance, 544 S.W.2d 659, 660 (Tex. 1976).\n\nAccordingly, we overrule Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ complaint that no legal theory supports\n\nthe award of damages.\n\n       (2) No Duty to Pay Royalties to BP. In Issue No. 2, Prize and the Rutherfords argue\n\nthey have no duty to pay the royalties awarded to BP; they contend it is Hoskins’ sole obligation\n\nto pay BP its royalties as part of the consideration for Hoskins’ purchase of BP’s 25% mineral\n\ninterest. As an initial matter, we note that Prize and the Rutherfords assert that the record\n\ncontains no evidence of any revenues from production from August 1, 2001 to August 15, 2004;\n\ntherefore, the full $3.2 million awarded to BP represents royalties due on production from\n\nAugust 16, 2004 to October 31, 2008 which should be paid by Hoskins. In support of their\n\ncontention that they are not responsible for paying BP its post-sale royalties, Prize and the\n\n\n\n                                              - 28 -\n\f                                                                                             04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nRutherfords point to the trial court’s statement in the final judgment that “BP’s royalty does not\n\nburden any interests held by the Defendants [Prize and the Rutherfords].” (emphasis added).\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords interpret that statement to mean they have no obligation as the\n\noperators to pay BP its royalties on production.             We find their argument to be somewhat\n\ndisingenuous. First, the court’s statement that BP’s royalty does not “burden any interests” held\n\nby Prize and the Rutherfords is part of the declaratory relief section of the judgment resolving the\n\nissues of title among the parties. In the previous sentence describing the interests held by BP, the\n\ncourt explains, “from August 16, 2004 forward, the ‘BP 25% mineral interest’ passed to Cliff\n\nHoskins, Inc., subject to BP retaining an undivided .06250 of 8/8ths royalty interest, which\n\nburdens the ‘BP 25% mineral interest’ now owned by Cliff Hoskins, Inc.” The court was simply\n\nclarifying that BP’s retained .06250 of 8/8ths royalty interest is attached to, and thus “burdens,”\n\nthe 25% mineral interest now owned by Hoskins. 18 See Clear Lake Pines, 2005 WL 1583506, at\n\n*3 (an encumbrance is an interest in realty that is a burden on its transfer, and the right to future\n\nroyalty payments on oil and gas production is an interest in realty) (citing City of Dayton v.\n\nAllred, 123 Tex. 60, 68 S.W.2d 172, 178 (1934), and Clyde v. Hamilton, 414 S.W.2d 434, 438\n\n(Tex. 1967)). The court was not stating that Prize and the Rutherfords have no duty to pay the\n\nroyalties owed to BP.\n\n        Second, as the entities operating on and producing oil and/or gas from the Baker\n\nProperty, Prize and the Rutherfords, and their successor operators, constitute “payors” under the\n\nTNRC, and as such are responsible for distributing the oil and gas proceeds to the “payees,”\n\ndefined as “persons legally entitled to payment from the proceeds derived from the sale of oil or\n\ngas,” which includes royalty interest owners. TEX. NAT. RES. CODE ANN. § 91.401(1), (2)\n\n\n18\n  In the final judgment, the court also noted that the “BP 25% mineral interest” now owned by Hoskins is still\nsubject to the pre-existing 1/64th non-participating royalty originally owned by ARCO.\n\n                                                    - 29 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n(defining a “payor” as “the party who undertakes to distribute oil and gas proceeds to the payee,\n\nwhether as the purchaser of the production of oil or gas . . . or as operator of the well from which\n\nsuch production was obtained or as lessee under the lease on which royalty is due.”); see\n\nConcord Oil, 966 S.W.2d at 461. Thus, part of Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ obligation as\n\noperators on the Baker Property is to pay the royalty owners their royalties on production. TEX.\n\nNAT. RES. CODE ANN. § 91.402(a). The fact that the trial court ordered Prize and the Rutherfords\n\nto pay the $3.2 million in royalties directly to BP as the royalty owner, rather than to Hoskins as\n\nthe mineral interest owner, does not constitute an abuse of discretion; in fact, it is consistent with\n\nthe TNRC. Accordingly, we overrule this issue.\n\n       (3) Future Relief. In Issue No. 7, Prize and the Rutherfords generally complain that the\n\nlast substantive paragraph of the final judgment contains improper provisions addressing “future\n\nrelief that is not pleaded, is advisory and is unwarranted.” Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure\n\n38.1 requires an appellant’s brief to “contain a clear and concise argument for the contention\n\nmade, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record.” TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords have waived their future relief argument because their briefs fail to make a\n\nclear and concise argument, and, with one exception, lack citations to supporting legal authority.\n\nThe failure by Prize and the Rutherfords to provide a clear argument or supporting authority\n\nwaives the claimed error. Nguyen v. Kosnoski, 93 S.W.3d 186, 188 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2002, no pet.). Moreover, one of the provisions criticized by Prize and the Rutherfords as\n\nbinding “people who are not parties to [the judgment], such as unnamed ‘first purchasers’ or\n\nfuture operators of the property,” is consistent with the TNRC definition of a “payor” under\n\nsection 91.401(2). Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ seventh issue is therefore overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 30 -\n\f                                                                                         04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nII. Hoskins’ Challenges to Damages Award\n\n           In its third issue on cross-appeal, Hoskins 19 asserts the trial court erred in rejecting his\n\nproposed well by well method of calculating damages, and instead calculating the damages by\n\n“lumping all revenue and expenses together for the seven Baker wells drilled post-termination,\n\nrather than excluding costs for the three admittedly unprofitable wells.” Hoskins also challenges\n\nthe court’s inclusion of the COPAS overhead costs.\n\n           (1) Well by Well Method. Hoskins contends the court should have calculated the “net\n\nrevenues” payable to Hoskins and BP on the “well by well” basis presented by its expert.\n\nHoskins argues it should have been awarded $4,508,836 in net revenues (which excludes costs of\n\nthe three unprofitable wells), rather than the $1,267,482 net revenues actually awarded (which\n\nincludes deduction of costs of all seven wells).\n\n           The trial court expressly rejected the “well by well” method in its final judgment, stating\n\n“the Court FINDS that Hoskins’ and BP’s argument for damages based on a well-by-well basis\n\nis not meritorious, and the Court rejects that argument.” The court then proceeded to make\n\nadditional findings that: (i) there is no applicable limitation to Defendants’ obligation to account\n\nto Hoskins and BP, and therefore no time bar to any of their claims; and (ii) the COPAS\n\nproduction overhead should be allowed as reasonable and necessary costs. In awarding Hoskins\n\nunpaid “net revenues,” the judgment states the amounts represent “net revenues (i.e., gross\n\nrevenues less reasonable and necessary expenses beneficial to the Subject Acreage and including\n\nBaker Well Nos. 8, 11 and 13) . . . .” Baker Well Nos. 8, 11 and 13 are the unprofitable Baker\n\nwells.\n\n           To support its well by well approach, Hoskins relies on the court of appeals opinion in\n\nWagner & Brown, Ltd. v. Sheppard, 198 S.W.3d 369 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2006), rev’d by\n19\n     BP does not join Hoskins in this point of error.\n\n                                                        - 31 -\n\f                                                                                               04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n282 S.W.3d 419 (Tex. 2008), as “the only case on point found by either party directly\n\nconsidering how damages should be calculated when an unleased cotenant drills both profitable\n\nand unprofitable wells.” That case turned on, as a question of first impression, how a pool of\n\nproducing oil and gas properties is affected if a lease in the pool expires. Wagner & Brown, 282\n\nS.W.3d at 421. Specifically, the case involved an operator seeking to recover reimbursement for\n\na mineral interest owner/unleased co-tenant’s share of costs for drilling a gas well before and\n\nafter the lease on the land had mistakenly expired due to failure to pay the owner’s royalties\n\nwithin 120 days of the first gas sales. Id. at 421-22. In reversing the Texarkana court, the\n\nSupreme Court held in relevant part that: (i) termination of the lease did not terminate the\n\nowner’s participation in the pooling unit because mineral owners can agree to pool their lands\n\neven if no lease exists; and (ii) an operator who drills a well in good faith is entitled to equitable\n\nreimbursement of costs, even if the operator’s lease is not valid, as long as the operator believed\n\nin good faith the lease was valid. Id. at 422-23, 426-27. Finally, the Supreme Court confirmed\n\nthe long-standing rule in Texas that “a cotenant has the right to extract minerals from common\n\nproperty without first obtaining the consent of his cotenants; however, he must account to them\n\non the basis of the value of any minerals taken, less the necessary and reasonable costs of\n\nproduction and marketing.” Id. at 426 (citing Byrom, 717 S.W.2d at 605). As to the reason\n\nHoskins relies on the Texarkana opinion, its deduction of expenses on a well by well basis, the\n\nSupreme Court expressly noted that it would not reach that issue because it was not raised on\n\nreview. See id. at 425 n.24 (noting the court of appeals “held that the defendants could not\n\ndeduct expenses incurred on the first well 20 from the revenues for the second well,” but\n\ndefendants did not appeal that conclusion).\n\n\n20\n   Evidence before the Texarkana Court of Appeals concerning the first well established that the reworking costs\ntotaled $592,000, but generated only $10,000 in revenue over a two-year period. Wagner & Brown, 198 S.W.3d at\n\n                                                     - 32 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n           To further support its well by well approach, Hoskins asserts the evidence is\n\n“uncontroverted” that the Baker Well Nos. 8, 11, and 13 were unprofitable, and thus did not\n\nbenefit the co-tenancy. Hoskins contends that failure to calculate damages on a well by well\n\nbasis, in the absence of a joint operating agreement stating otherwise, is contrary to well-\n\nestablished Texas law because a co-tenant is not entitled to reimbursement for unsuccessful\n\noperations. See Neeley v. Intercity Mgmt. Corp., 732 S.W.2d 644, 646 (Tex. App.—Corpus\n\nChristi 1987, no writ) (if co-tenant drills a dry hole, he does so at his own risk and without right\n\nto reimbursement for the drilling cost); see also Burnham v. Hardy Oil Co., 147 S.W. 330, 335\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.—San Antonio 1912), aff’d, 195 S.W. 1139 (Tex. 1917) (expenses connected\n\nwith nonproducing wells are not chargeable to other co-tenants but should be borne by those who\n\nincurred them).\n\n           In response to Hoskins’ argument for the well by well calculation, Prize and the\n\nRutherfords note the Texarkana opinion in Wagner & Brown cites no authority supporting the\n\nwell by well approach. See Wagner & Brown, 198 S.W.3d at 380-81. They further argue that\n\nbased on the Supreme Court’s holdings and tenor in its opinion, the Court would have overruled\n\na well by well approach had that issue been appealed. See Wagner & Brown, 282 S.W.3d at 425-\n\n27. We agree with Prize and the Rutherfords.\n\n           We have found no case other than the Texarkana opinion which applies a strict well by\n\nwell analysis to a co-tenant’s reimbursement claim. See Wagner & Brown, 198 S.W.3d at 380-\n\n81. We note, however, that as a general rule oil and gas wells are characterized as improvements\n\nto real property; as such, equitable principles apply and dictate that a person who “in good faith\n\nmakes improvements upon property owned by another is entitled to compensation therefore.”\n\nWagner & Brown, 282 S.W.3d at 425-26. Furthermore, “[i]t has long been the rule in Texas that\n\n381 n.7.\n\n                                               - 33 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\na cotenant has the right to extract minerals from common property without first obtaining the\n\nconsent of his cotenants; however, he must account to them on the basis of the value of any\n\nminerals taken, less the necessary and reasonable costs of production and marketing.” Id. at\n\n426 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court in reversing the court of appeals, although not\n\naddressing the well by well analysis, clearly stressed the equitable nature of a reimbursement-\n\nfor-improvements claim. Id. at 428. The Court stated,\n\n       Given the equitable nature of a reimbursement-for-improvements claim, we\n       decline to read Texas law as establishing that drilling costs are always or never\n       recoverable when a lease expires. Instead, we believe the equitable nature of such\n       claims must turn on the equities in each case. . . . As with other equitable actions,\n       a jury may have to settle disputed issues about what happened, but ‘the\n       expediency, necessity, or propriety of equitable relief’ is for the trial court, and its\n       ruling is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n\nId. at 428-29 (emphasis in original).\n\n       Applying the above principles to the facts in Wagner & Brown, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat the trial court and court of appeals abused their discretion in declaring costs unrecoverable,\n\nbecause there was evidence that those costs benefitted the estate. Id. at 429. The Supreme Court\n\nrelied on fairness considerations, as well as past and potential future benefits to the estate from\n\nfuture wells that may be drilled, when ruling the trial court abused its discretion in refusing\n\nreimbursement of drilling costs. Id. at 424-25, 428-29. Applying the reasoning found in the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Wagner & Brown, we decline to apply a strict well by well\n\napproach to the costs at issue in this case, and instead will review the trial court’s determination\n\nof the equities from the evidence presented under an abuse of discretion standard.\n\n       Turning to the evidence, Hoskins discounts the argument by Prize and the Rutherfords\n\nthat the unprofitable Baker wells nonetheless benefitted the co-tenancy by (i) preventing\n\ndrainage from nearby development, (ii) providing beneficial geological “wellbore” information,\n\n\n\n                                                - 34 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nand (iii) permitting re-entry of the unplugged wells in the future. The record confirms that\n\nPrize’s expert, Don Ray George, testified extensively that the expenses from Baker Well Nos. 8,\n\n11, and 13 were reasonable and necessary and benefitted the estate.           Specifically, George\n\ntestified that Well Nos. 8, 11, and 13 were drilled in “good faith to offset and develop the\n\nreservoirs.” He testified the operator and the other mineral interest owners gained a myriad of\n\nvaluable information “beneficial to the overall development of the minerals underlying the Earl\n\nBaker Estate” from the drilling of these wells. George opined, “[I]t’s a continuing benefit to be\n\nable to not only tell what the geology looks like, but the extent of reservoirs, the quantity of the\n\nhydrocarbons that’s there, whether or not there’s an active water drive or what type of reservoir\n\nmechanism each of those individual reservoirs is producing under.” George further testified that\n\nWell Nos. 8 and 11 were not plugged (Well No. 13 is still producing) and could be re-entered in\n\nthe future if and when economics improve. Hoskins’ expert, Peter Huddleston, offered no\n\ntestimony to controvert George’s testimony that Well Nos. 8, 11, and 13 did benefit the estate or\n\nthat the expenses from the three wells were unnecessary or unreasonable. Hoskins does point to\n\nthe testimony of several fact witnesses and argues that this testimony contradicts any possible\n\nbenefit to the estate (i.e., the wells did not prevent drainage, may never be re-entered for future\n\noperations, and only “potentially” provided useful geological benefits.). Resolution of any\n\nconflicts in the evidence was within the court’s province as the finder of fact. See City of Keller,\n\n168 S.W.3d at 819 (it is the sole province of fact finder to determine credibility of the witnesses\n\nand weight to be given their testimony).\n\n       Hoskins also complains that all of the costs of the non-producing wells were incurred\n\nafter BP’s June 25, 2004 letter concerning termination of the JOA, and after suit was filed. As\n\nnoted earlier, however, the long standing rule is that a co-tenant has the right to extract minerals\n\n\n\n                                               - 35 -\n\f                                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nfrom the common estate without the consent of his cotenants. 21 Wagner & Brown, 282 S.W.3d\n\nat 426. George’s testimony and the record indicate that the expenses from Well Nos. 8, 11, and\n\n13 should be included in any net revenues calculation because Hoskins also sought and obtained\n\nan interest in those wells through its title claims in this suit.\n\n         (2) COPAS Overhead. Hoskins further claims the COPAS 22 overhead costs permitted\n\nby the trial court should have been excluded, thereby increasing Hoskins’ damages by $81,085.\n\nAs with the well by well determination, it is for the fact finder to determine whether an overhead\n\ncharge is properly deductible as a reasonable and necessary expense. Id. at 425 (overhead\n\nexpenses on a lapsed lease were properly charged as long as they were reasonable and\n\nnecessary). George testified that the COPAS overhead charge was reasonable and necessary and\n\nstandard in the industry. He also testified that the co-tenants benefitted from the services\n\nassociated with these charges. Hoskins’ expert did not dispute this testimony, stating that he\n\nmade no determination as to the reasonableness or necessity of the charges.\n\n         In summary, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting a well by well\n\napproach to calculate Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ reimbursement-for-improvements claim and\n\nin awarding Hoskins unpaid “net revenues” calculated as “gross revenues less reasonable and\n\nnecessary expenses beneficial to the Subject Acreage and including Baker Well Nos. 8, 11 and\n\n13.” Furthermore, there is ample evidence supporting the trial court’s implied finding that the\n\ncosts associated with Well Nos. 8, 11, and 13 and the COPAS overhead were reasonable,\n\n\n\n21\n  The trial court’s final judgment recognized that because the El Paso and Baker Leases terminated by their terms in\nAugust 2001, “Hoskins’s and BP’s mineral rights and interests therefore reverted to them at that time, free and clear\nfrom the 1967 JOA and anyone claiming thereunder, making Hoskins and BP co-tenants.”\n22\n   As defined by Hoskins, “COPAS” overhead is a “fixed amount of overhead paid to the operator for their\nsupervision of operations” according to the terms of the operating agreement. Hoskins concedes that Article 8 of the\nJOA called for payment of COPAS overhead to the operator, Prize and the Rutherfords, but argues the JOA had\nterminated and the defendants did not prove the COPAS was a reasonable and necessary expense.\n\n                                                       - 36 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nnecessary, and beneficial to the estate. We therefore overrule Hoskins’ third issue on cross-\n\nappeal.\n\nIII. BP’s Challenge to Damages Award\n          In its third issue on cross-appeal, BP complains the trial court erred in permitting Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords to satisfy their obligation to account to BP for its share of net revenues by\n\ntendering to BP its applicable share of gas in-kind at the wellhead in lieu of payment of its share\n\nof proceeds from the sale of production. The trial court ordered in the last substantive paragraph\n\nof the judgment that, “any party who is a producing co-tenant of oil, gas and/or condensate from\n\nthe Subject Acreage shall account to the non-producing parties.” Specifically, the court ordered\n\nthat Prize and the Rutherfords, “for so long as they remain as producing co-tenants, shall have\n\nthe continuing obligation to account to Hoskins and BP for their respective shares of net\n\nrevenues attributable to the Subject Acreage.” The trial court further provided:\n\n          As to any revenues which have not previously been distributed by the Defendants,\n          BP and Hoskins shall be entitled to receive their respective shares of production\n          revenues directly from the first purchaser of such production and the operators\n          shall take such actions as are necessary to cause such direct payment.\n          Defendants, at their option, may also satisfy their obligations under this paragraph\n          by tendering Hoskins and BP their applicable share of gas in kind at the wellhead\n          in lieu of payment.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          BP argues the trial court’s judgment should be modified to remove the take-in-kind\n\noption because no legal authority exists allowing the producing co-tenant to force the non-\n\nproducing co-tenant to take a share of gas at the wellhead instead of receiving its share of net\n\nproduction proceeds after the gas is treated and marketed. In response, Prize and the Rutherfords\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 37 -\n\f                                                                                                 04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nargue the trial court acted within its discretion in allowing them to tender gas in-kind at the\n\nwellhead. 23 We disagree.\n\n        Allowing a co-tenant to tender gas in-kind at the wellhead is inconsistent with Texas co-\n\ntenancy law which provides that “a cotenant who produces minerals from common property\n\nwithout having secured the consent of his cotenants is accountable to them on the basis of the\n\nvalue of the mineral taken less the necessary and reasonable cost of producing and marketing the\n\nsame.” Cox, 397 S.W.2d at 201. Prize and the Rutherfords cite us to no authority showing that a\n\nproducing co-tenant can comply with its duty to account to a nonproducing co-tenant by\n\ntendering the applicable share of gas “in kind” at the wellhead. A trial court abuses its discretion\n\nif it acts without regard for any guiding rules or principles. City of Brownsville v. Alvarado, 897\n\nS.W.2d 750, 754 (Tex. 1995). Accordingly, we grant BP’s third issue on cross-appeal and\n\nmodify the trial court’s judgment to remove the last sentence of the last substantive paragraph of\n\nthe final judgment, quoted above, which permitted Prize and the Rutherfords to satisfy their\n\nobligations to account to Hoskins and BP by tendering “their applicable share of gas in kind at\n\nthe wellhead in lieu of payment.”\n\nIV. The Rutherfords’ Challenge to Damages Award\n\n        Because we have sustained the damages award to Hoskins and BP, we must address the\n\nissues raised by the Rutherfords with respect to damages. The Rutherfords assert in two issues\n\nthat all of the Rutherford Children 24 are not liable for damages because they did not own any fee\n\n\n23\n   Prize and the Rutherfords also argue that because BP, not Hoskins, appealed this portion of the judgment, this\nissue must be rejected since BP’s royalty interest burdens only Hoskins’ interest. Therefore, Prize and the\nRutherfords contend BP is not entitled to any revenues or any gas from them, and must look only to Hoskins for\npayment of its royalty. For the reasons stated supra, we have rejected the argument that Prize and the Rutherfords\nhave no obligation to pay BP its royalties. See TEX. NAT. RES. CODE ANN. §§ 91.401, 91.402.\n24\n  The “Rutherford Children” consist of eight individuals: Stevan D. Rutherford, Patrick R. Rutherford, III, David\nTraylor Rutherford, John Richard Rutherford, Mary Elizabeth Rutherford, Paul Maroney Rutherford, Michael G.\nRutherford, Jr., and Sally Ann Rutherford.\n\n                                                      - 38 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\ninterests in the mineral estate, but rather owned only leasehold working interests. They further\n\nargue the trial court improperly imposed joint and several liability against all defendants under\n\nthe judgment because there was no claim upon which a finding of joint and several liability could\n\nbe made.\n\n       (1) Rutherford Children. A trial court may not grant relief on a theory of recovery not\n\nsufficiently stated in the party’s live pleadings or tried by consent. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 301\n\n(judgment of the court shall conform to the pleadings); Herrington v. Sandcastle Condominium\n\nAss’n, 222 S.W.3d 99, 102 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.). To determine\n\nwhether an issue was tried by consent, we examine the record for evidence of whether the parties\n\nactually tried the issue. Johnston v. McKinney Am., Inc., 9 S.W.3d 271, 281 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet. denied) (holding even though trial court found disclaimer was\n\nconspicuous, it erred in finding disclaimer barred plaintiff’s recovery because issue was not tried\n\nby consent and thus not properly before court). Trial by consent is not a general rule of practice\n\nand should not be applied unless clearly warranted. Haas v. Ashford Hollow Cmty. Improvement\n\nAss’, Inc., 209 S.W.3d 875, 883-84 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.). A party’s\n\nunpleaded issue may be deemed tried by consent when evidence on the issue is developed under\n\ncircumstances indicating both parties understood the issue was in the case, and the other party\n\nfailed to make an appropriate complaint. Johnson v. Structured Asset Servs., LLC, 148 S.W.3d\n\n711, 719 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2004, no pet.).\n\n       As we have previously held, the court’s damages award to BP and Hoskins was made\n\npursuant to the TNRC. In its last amended petition regarding its claim under the TNRC, BP did\n\nnot include the Rutherford Children, but sought to recover its share of production revenues\n\n“jointly and severally” only from “Prize Energy, Prize Operating, Gruy, Rutherford Oil and/or\n\n\n\n                                               - 39 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nHunter Gathering” as “payors” under the TNRC. Similarly, Hoskins affirmatively states that the\n\n“only” cause of action it asserts against the Rutherford Children is its suit to remove the cloud on\n\nHoskins’ title to an undivided 25% mineral interest in the Subject Acreage. In addition, the\n\nrecord does not reflect that the issue of the Rutherford Children’s liability for any damages was\n\nactually tried by consent. Accordingly, the Rutherford Children’s issue is sustained, and the\n\njudgment will be modified to reflect that the damages award is not assessed against the\n\nRutherford Children.\n\n       (2) Joint and Several Liability Against All Defendants. The Rutherfords also argue\n\nthe trial court improperly imposed joint and several liability against all the defendants. BP and\n\nHoskins respond that the trial court expressly found that “all defendants” committed a good faith\n\ntrespass, and, under Texas law, each trespasser may be held jointly liable for the whole amount\n\nof the damages. First, we disagree with BP’s and Hoskins’ characterization of the trial court’s\n\njudgment. In its interlocutory judgment, the trial court’s very first ruling stated:\n\n       The court GRANTS Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment [defining the\n       defendants to include the Rutherford Children] on all Plaintiffs’ claims of\n       trespass. Plaintiffs shall take nothing from Defendants on any trespass claim in\n       this cause. (emphasis added).\n\nThe trial court again in its final judgment repeated that it was granting the defendants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment on all claims of trespass and further “ORDER[ED] that Hoskins, BP and\n\nBank of America, N.A., as Trustee of the Baker Trusts take nothing on their trespass claims. . . .”\n\n       Second, while we have upheld the award of damages under Chapter 91 of the TNRC, the\n\nstatute does not address joint and several liability among payors. By analogy, co-tenancy law is\n\nclear that the obligations of co-tenants are based on their proportional share. As the Supreme\n\nCourt has noted, when dealing with obligations of co-tenants, “the rule of accountability is the\n\nproportionate market value of the product less the proportionate necessary and reasonable costs\n\n                                                - 40 -\n\f                                                                                                  04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nof producing and marketing.” Cox, 397 S.W.2d at 203. Here, during the time period from\n\nAugust 2001 to October 2008, the period for which damages were awarded against Prize and the\n\nRutherfords, all the parties were in a co-tenancy relationship. Since a recovery against co-\n\ntenants is not generally imposed as a joint and several liability, we see no reason why a recovery\n\nof unpaid oil and gas proceeds against co-tenants under the TNRC would be treated any\n\ndifferently. Accordingly, we sustain the Rutherfords’ issue, and will modify the judgment to\n\ndelete the imposition of joint and several liability among all the defendants.\n\n                                      ATTORNEYS’ FEES & INTEREST\n\n        We next address the parties’ arguments concerning recovery of attorneys’ fees and\n\ninterest.   The trial court did not award attorneys’ fees to any party because it found the\n\nunderlying nature of the case was a determination of title; the court made an alternative finding\n\nthat reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees were $900,000 for each group of parties. In\n\nawarding damages to Hoskins and BP, the court also awarded pre-judgment interest at 5% per\n\nannum simple interest from December 22, 2004 until the day before the date of the final\n\njudgment, and post-judgment interest at 5% per annum, compounded annually.\n\n        On appeal, Prize and the Rutherfords assert they are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees\n\nbecause they prevailed on summary judgment against the theft claims brought by Hoskins, BP,\n\nand the Bank; they also assert the court’s award of pre-judgment and post-judgment interest\n\nshould be reversed. Hoskins and BP argue they should have been awarded attorneys’ fees\n\nbecause they prevailed in obtaining their share of revenues under the TNRC. 25\n\n\n\n\n25\n  The Bank’s challenge to the trial court’s assessment of Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ costs is separately addressed\nunder the Bank’s cross-appeal.\n\n                                                       - 41 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nI. Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ Issues\n\n       (1) Recovery of Attorneys’ Fees Under Texas Theft Liability Act. In Issue No. 5 of\n\nthe main appeal, Prize and the Rutherfords argue they should each have recovered $900,000 in\n\nattorneys’ fees because they prevailed on summary judgment against the civil theft claims\n\nbrought by Hoskins, BP, and the Bank under the Texas Theft Liability Act. See TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n\n& REM. CODE ANN. §§ 134.001-.005 (West 2005). Prize and the Rutherfords contend the award\n\nof their attorneys’ fees was mandatory under the statute because they successfully defended\n\nagainst the plaintiffs’ civil theft claims. See id. § 134.005(b) (providing “[e]ach person who\n\nprevails in a suit under this chapter shall be awarded court costs and reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney’s fees”); see also Air Routing Int’l Corp. (Canada) v. Britannia Airways, Ltd., 150\n\nS.W.3d 682, 686 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.) (recognizing “unusual” nature\n\nof Texas Theft Act in that it requires the court to award attorney’s fees to a party who\n\nsuccessfully defends against a Theft Act claim without any finding that the theft claim is\n\ngroundless, frivolous, or brought in bad faith).\n\n       Hoskins, BP, and the Bank offer several responses, one of which is that Prize and the\n\nRutherfords failed to plead for recovery of their attorneys’ fees under the Theft Liability Act.\n\nWe agree. As noted, supra, a trial court may not grant relief on a theory of recovery not\n\nsufficiently stated in the party’s live pleadings or tried by consent. Herrington, 222 S.W.3d at\n\n102. The purpose of pleadings is to give an adversary notice of claims and defenses, as well as\n\nnotice of the relief sought. Perez v. Briercroft Serv. Corp., 809 S.W.2d 216, 218 (Tex. 1991).\n\nHere, Prize and the Rutherfords did not place the plaintiffs, or the trial court, on notice that they\n\nwere seeking to recover their attorneys’ fees under section 134.005(b) by so stating in their\n\nsummary judgment motion or any other pleading before the trial court at the time it rendered\n\n\n\n                                                   - 42 -\n\f                                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\njudgment. 26 On appeal, Prize and the Rutherfords make no attempt to direct us to any place in\n\nthe record where they requested section 134.005(b) attorney’s fees in the trial court. To the\n\ncontrary, Prize and the Rutherfords argue in their reply brief that because recovery of attorneys’\n\nfees is mandatory under section 134.005(b), they did not need to make the trial court or plaintiffs\n\naware of their request for attorneys’ fees under that statute. The cases cited by Prize and the\n\nRutherfords do not support their argument because the parties seeking recovery of attorney’s fees\n\nin those cases made the request in the trial court. See, e.g., Robinson v. Brannon, 313 S.W.3d\n\n860, 868 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.). In addition, in a case decided under\n\nthe Theft Liability Act, the Dallas court of appeals held that prevailing defendants were not\n\nentitled to recover their attorneys’ fees under section 134.005(b) because the defendants failed to\n\nspecifically request recovery of attorneys’ fees under section 134.005(b) in any pleading in the\n\ntrial court. Cricket Communications, Inc. v. Trillium Indus., Inc., 235 S.W.3d 298, 310 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2007, no pet.). We agree with the reasoning of the Dallas court.\n\n         Because Prize and the Rutherfords failed to specifically request recovery of their\n\nattorneys’ fees under section 134.005(b) in the trial court, and the issue was not tried by consent,\n\nwe hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award them attorneys’ fees under\n\nthe Theft Liability Act. See Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 20 (Tex. 1998) (appellate court\n\nreviews trial court’s decision to award attorney’s fees for abuse of discretion).\n\n         (2)   Assessment of Pre-Judgment Interest.                    In their Issue No. 4, Prize and the\n\nRutherfords assert the court’s award of pre-judgment interest under the TNRC should be\n\nreversed. We agree. Even though the trial court did not expressly state the basis for its award of\n\npre-judgment interest, as we have previously held, it is clear from the judgment as a whole that\n\n\n26\n  In addition, the record does not reflect the issue of recovery of Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ attorneys’ fees under\nsection 134.005(b) was tried by consent. See Johnson, 148 S.W.3d at 719.\n\n                                                        - 43 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nthe court based its award of damages on section 91.402(a) of the TNRC. TEX. NAT. RES. CODE\n\nANN. § 91.402(a). Section 91.403 provides that a payor who fails to comply with the time limits\n\nfor making the payments required under section 91.402(a) must pay interest to the payees. Id.\n\n§ 91.403(a). Subsection (b) of section 91.402, however, provides a “safe harbor” which permits\n\na payor to withhold or suspend payments beyond the time limits without being subject to pre-\n\njudgment interest when there is “a dispute concerning title that would affect distribution of\n\npayments.” Id. §§ 91.402(b)(1), 91.403(b) (recognizing the interest exceptions stated in section\n\n91.402(b)); Headington Oil Co., L.P. v. White, 287 S.W.3d 204, 210 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2009, no pet.); Gore Oil Co. v. Roosth, 158 S.W.3d 596, 602 (Tex. App.—Eastland, 2005,\n\nno pet.).\n\n        Here, as noted supra, the trial court found the underlying nature of Hoskins’ and BP’s suit\n\nwas a title determination of their interest in the Baker Property. We agree. The record is clear\n\nthat a legitimate question concerning title to the 25% unleased mineral interest originally owned\n\nby ARCO, to which BP succeeded and sold to Hoskins, was the underlying basis for this case,\n\nand that the title dispute affected the rights of Hoskins and BP to receive payments under section\n\n91.402(a). Therefore, prejudgment interest was not recoverable under the plain language of\n\nsection 91.402(b)(1). Concord Oil, 966 S.W.2d at 461. Finally, the award of pre-judgment\n\ninterest may not be sustained under equity, or common law, as argued by Hoskins and BP,\n\nbecause the Supreme Court has stated that the statute controls. Id. at 462-63 (holding that, when\n\nthere is a title dispute affecting distributions of oil and gas proceeds, equitable prejudgment\n\ninterest may not be awarded under common law because it would be in direct conflict with\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 44 -\n\f                                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nsection 91.402(b) of the TNRC). 27 Accordingly, we sustain Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ issue\n\nchallenging the award of pre-judgment interest, 28 and will modify the judgment to delete the\n\naward of pre-judgment interest.\n\nII. Hoskins’ and BP’s Issue\n\n         On cross-appeal, Hoskins and BP assert in their third and first issues, respectively, that\n\nthey are entitled to receive their attorneys’ fees because they obtained relief under the TNRC.\n\nWe agree. We have held, supra, that the court’s award of net revenues and royalties to Hoskins\n\nand BP was made pursuant to section 91.402(a) of the TNRC. Section 91.406 provides that, “if a\n\nsuit is filed to collect proceeds and interest under this subchapter, the court shall include in any\n\nfinal judgment in favor of the plaintiff an award of: (1) reasonable attorney’s fees . . . .” TEX.\n\nNAT. RES. CODE ANN. § 91.406 (West 2001). Both Hoskins and BP brought claims to recover\n\ntheir unpaid share of the oil and gas proceeds, plus interest, under sections 91.402 and 91.403 of\n\nthe TNRC, and they received a favorable judgment on those claims in the trial court; in addition,\n\nthey expressly requested recovery of their attorneys’ fees under the TNRC. Id. §§ 91.402,\n\n91.403. Since we are affirming the trial court’s award of damages to Hoskins and BP on the\n\nbasis of their TNRC claims, BP and Hoskins have obtained a “favorable” result under the plain\n\nlanguage of section 91.406. See Headington, 287 S.W.3d at 215-16 (noting that a judgment is\n\n“favorable” to the plaintiff when he obtains “a measure of relief which leaves him in a better\n\nposition that he held before filing suit,” and upholding award of attorneys’ fees under section\n\n91.406 to plaintiff who was awarded unpaid royalties).\n\n\n27\n  Hoskins and BP rely on our prior opinion in Marshall as support for the award of pre-judgment interest.\nHowever, Marshall is distinguishable because the pre-judgment interest was awarded on fraud claims, not under the\nTNRC. Marshall, 288 S.W.3d at 455.\n28\n  To the extent Prize and the Rutherfords challenge the award of post-judgment interest on the damages, they make\nno clear argument explaining the legal basis for their challenge and cite no legal authority. Therefore, the issue is\nwaived. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n                                                       - 45 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       Prize and the Rutherfords argue that because recovery of attorney’s fees is barred in a\n\ntrespass to try title action, and the trial court found the underlying nature of the case was “to\n\nobtain a declaration of title,” an award of attorneys’ fees to Hoskins and BP under the TNRC\n\nwould be improper. See Marshall, 288 S.W.3d at 464 (citing EOG Resources, Inc. v. Killam Oil\n\nCo., 239 S.W.3d 293, 304 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2007, pet. denied)).                Prize and the\n\nRutherfords cite us to no case under the TNRC holding that attorneys’ fees should not be\n\nawarded in a case involving a title dispute. In fact, the statutory language of TNRC section\n\n91.406 contains no exception prohibiting recovery of attorney’s fees in a title dispute. Since the\n\nlegislature excluded pre-judgment interest from a potential recovery in section 91.402(b)’s “safe\n\nharbor” provision, the legislature clearly also could have excluded attorney’s fees from a\n\npotential recovery if that was its intent; the legislature chose not to do so. See Fireman’s Fund\n\nCounty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hidi, 13 S.W.3d 767, 769 (Tex. 2000) (when the legislature employs a\n\nterm in one section of a statute and excludes it in another, we must presume it had a reason for\n\nexcluding the term); see also Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Inc. v. Hogue, 271 S.W.3d\n\n238, 256 (Tex. 2008) (court must not interpret a statute in a manner that renders any part\n\nmeaningless or superfluous); Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Garrison Contractors, Inc., 966 S.W.2d\n\n482, 484 (Tex. 1998) (we construe a statute to ascertain and effectuate the legislature’s intent by\n\nfirst looking to the plain and common meaning of the statute’s language, viewing it in the\n\ncontext of the statute as a whole and giving it full effect). Accordingly, we conclude the trial\n\ncourt erred in not awarding Hoskins and BP their attorneys’ fees under section 91.406 of the\n\nTNRC. See Holland v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 1 S.W.3d 91, 94 (Tex. 1999) (availability of\n\nstatutory attorney’s fees is a question of law which appellate court reviews de novo).\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 46 -\n\f                                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n           Finally, Prize and the Rutherfords assert the $900,000 amount of attorneys’ fees is\n\nexcessive because it is “based on a 95% allocation of attorney work to the TNRC cause of action\n\nand only 5% to all other causes of action and defenses.” They contend the majority of the issues\n\nin the case involved trespass and title, not “prompt-payment issues under the TNRC;” therefore,\n\nthe $900,000 amount is not supported by the record.                      First, we have already rejected the\n\nargument that the TNRC is merely a prompt payment statute devoid of a cause of action for\n\nnonpayment of oil and gas proceeds, and have upheld the damages awards under the TNRC\n\nclaims. Second, our review of the record confirms that the trial court’s finding that the allocation\n\nof a majority (95%) of the attorneys’ work to the TNRC claims was not unreasonable; further,\n\nthe fee amount of $900,000 is a reasonable and necessary amount supported by the record.\n\n           The record shows that BP and Hoskins sufficiently proved up their attorneys’ fees at trial,\n\nwith attorney Thomas Zabel 29 testifying as to segregation among claims as well as the amount of\n\nfees incurred. Specifically, Zabel testified that, with the exception of the alternative breach of\n\ncontract claim brought by BP, all the claims asserted by BP and Hoskins depended on the same\n\nset of facts (i.e., that the JOA had terminated in August 2001), and that resolution of the\n\ndeclaratory judgment claim clearing title was beneficial to, and a necessary pre-requisite to, the\n\nright as payees to recover production proceeds under the TNRC claims. Zabel stated, “there was\n\nminimal time that can be segregated out that was unique to [claims for which no attorneys’ fees\n\nare provided . . . cloud on title, . . . trespass, conversion], but prosecuting those claims further, it\n\nbe[ne]fitted the natural resources claims, the theft act claims, the breach of contract claims, the\n\ndeclaratory judgment claims, that all have attorneys fees that are provided for.” Zabel also\n\ntestified the issues in the case were relatively complex and required sophisticated oil and gas\n\nattorneys, there were multiple hearings, and that efforts had to be devoted to defeating the\n29\n     Attorney Thomas Zabel was designated as the attorneys’ fees expert for Hoskins as well as BP.\n\n                                                         - 47 -\n\f                                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nnumerous defenses and counterclaims asserted by Prize and the Rutherfords in order to prevail\n\non the TNRC claims. Zabel stated that attorneys’ fees of $900,000 each would be reasonable,\n\neven though more fees were incurred, based on an allocation of approximately 5% for work\n\nunique to claims for which attorneys’ fees are not recoverable and 95% for work benefitting the\n\nTNRC claims. Prize and the Rutherfords offered no contradictory evidence.\n\n         The trial court did not abuse its discretion in accepting the segregation of 5% of the\n\nattorneys’ work as unique to non-fee claims and 95% to the TNRC claims. See Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313-14 (Tex. 2006) (requiring segregation of\n\nattorney’s fees that relate solely to a claim for which fees are unrecoverable, but also noting that\n\nin many cases legal fees cannot and need not be precisely allocated to one claim or the other, and\n\nthat segregation may be based on percentage estimates). Further, the reasonableness of the\n\nallocation and $900,000 amount of fees is supported by sufficient evidence in the record. Id. at\n\n313-14 (segregation of attorney’s fees among multiple claims is a mixed question of law and\n\nfact).\n\n         Accordingly, we hold that Hoskins and BP 30 are both entitled to recover attorneys’ fees\n\nunder section 91.406 of the TNRC, and that the trial court’s (alternative) finding that $900,000 is\n\nthe amount of reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees incurred by Hoskins and BP on their\n\nTNRC claims is supported by the record and is not an abuse of discretion. Therefore, we sustain\n\nthis issue and we will render judgment awarding $900,000 in attorneys’ fees to both Hoskins and\n\nBP on their TNRC claims. 31\n\n\n30\n   Prize and the Rutherfords also state that “BP has not incurred any attorneys’ fees at all” because Hoskins is\nindemnifying BP. They cite no authority, and engage in no analysis, in support of this contention; therefore, it is\nwaived. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n31\n   Hoskins and BP also ask for conditional attorneys’ fees on appeal; although Zabel testified about the amount of\nattorneys’ fees on appeal, the trial court made no finding on conditional appellate fees and no objection was raised.\n\n                                                       - 48 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n                                 SANCTIONS AGAINST HOSKINS\n\n       Next, Hoskins challenges the trial court’s assessment of $200,000 in sanctions against\n\nhim for discovery abuse committed by counsel Bryan Leitch. Specifically, Hoskins asserts: (1)\n\nthere was no pleading to support a monetary sanctions award; (2) defendants offered no\n\ncompetent evidence of monetary harm suffered as a result of the alleged discovery abuse; (3)\n\nthere was no direct relationship between the discovery abuse and the sanction imposed; and (4)\n\nthe award was unreasonable, excessive, unrelated to the alleged discovery abuse, and constitutes\n\nan impermissible penalty.\n\n       (1) Factual Background. Prize and the Rutherfords filed a motion for sanctions against\n\nHoskins and Leitch alleging that Leitch, counsel for Hoskins and the Baker Trusts, committed\n\nserious misconduct, including witness tampering and obtaining documents under false pretenses.\n\nThe motion further alleged that Leitch’s actions were known to and approved, at least in part, by\n\nhis clients. Prize and the Rutherfords requested that the trial court strike the pleadings of\n\nHoskins and the Baker Trusts.\n\n       At the sanctions hearing, Prize and the Rutherfords offered 39 exhibits to support their\n\nclaim of misconduct by Leitch. Without identifying himself as an attorney, Leitch wrote to\n\npotential witnesses and obtained documents for use in the case. Leitch used false letterhead in\n\nwhich he claimed to be a businessman for “Oil and Gas Properties” or “Mi Oil.” Katy Brymer,\n\nan assistant to a Prize contract pumper, testified by deposition that Leitch contacted her and told\n\nher that he worked for an oil company and asked to meet with her to discuss a job opportunity.\n\nLeitch set up a meeting with Brymer, and at the meeting falsely told her he was investigating\n\ncriminal conduct by Prize; he then offered to pay her in exchange for her assistance in the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 49 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nLeitch also went to Brymer’s house when she was not home and tried to crawl through her fence.\n\nBrymer was upset when she learned that Leitch had misrepresented himself to her.\n\n       Rick Rudolph, president of South Texas Gas Services, a nonparty to this appeal, testified\n\nby deposition that he met with Leitch and Cliff Hoskins. At the meeting, in the presence of\n\nHoskins, Leitch told Rudolph, who performed the gas-chart integrations, that if he would provide\n\nassistance to them in this case, they could “swing some business” his way. Rudolph stated that\n\nLeitch continually badgered him to produce documents that had already been provided, and also\n\nthreatened him and South Texas Gas with criminal penalties for spoliation of evidence. Due to\n\nthis harassment, Rudolph hired Thompson & Knight to represent him and South Texas Gas in\n\nthis matter. Leitch was then notified by Thompson & Knight that Rudolph and South Texas Gas\n\nwere represented and that all communications should be directed to counsel.\n\n       Despite this warning, Leitch hired a local attorney, John Miller, to visit the Rudolphs at\n\ntheir business in Sinton, Texas. Thompson & Knight was not informed that this contact would\n\ntake place. Leitch told Miller that Rudolph was not represented by counsel. Miller informed the\n\nRudolphs that it would be in their best interest to obtain counsel and that Hoskins would pay for\n\na lawyer. Rudolph also remembered Miller saying that if they agreed to allow Leitch to pay for\n\ntheir legal representation, Leitch would keep them from being held liable to the other plaintiffs.\n\nAt Leitch’s direction, Miller spoke to Rudolph about giving a deposition in the case. Miller was\n\nsurprised to learn that the Rudolphs did in fact have retained counsel.\n\n       At his deposition on August 12, 2005, Cliff Hoskins admitted that he was aware of some\n\nof Leitch’s misconduct. Hoskins acknowledged that he authorized the letters sent to nonparties\n\non false letterhead as part of the investigation Leitch was conducting. Additionally, Hoskins\n\nattended the deposition of Katy Brymer on May 17, 2006, and at that time became aware of\n\n\n\n                                               - 50 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nLeitch’s improper conduct as to Brymer. Additionally, Hoskins verified interrogatory answers\n\nwhich sought information about Leitch’s misconduct. Hoskins’ co-counsel, Timothy Robinson,\n\nwas also copied on Prize’s counsel’s communications complaining of Leitch’s improper conduct\n\nwhich were sent to all counsel of record from November 2005 through June 2006, thereby\n\nputting Hoskins on notice of Leitch’s misconduct. Despite this knowledge, Hoskins continued to\n\nretain Leitch.\n\n        Following the presentation of this evidence, the trial court ordered that Leitch be removed\n\nas counsel and disqualified as an attorney for Hoskins. Thereafter, the trial court stated in a letter\n\nto counsel that, “After careful consideration, the court does find that the actions’s [sic]\n\nattributable to Cliff Hoskins (Cliff Hoskins, Inc.) are sanctionable, however, such actions do not\n\nrise to the level that warrants striking all pleadings and resulting in the Death Penalty in this\n\ncause. . . . The Court will continue to examine the appropriate sanctions to deter Mr. Hoskins and\n\nother similarly situated parties of future litigations [sic].”\n\n        At a later date, the trial court heard evidence to determine monetary sanctions. Counsel\n\nfor Prize testified that, in light of the facts and the goals of deterrence, and taking into account\n\nthe lack of acceptance of responsibility by Hoskins or his counsel, a reasonable monetary\n\nsanction against Hoskins would be $300,000. Counsel for the Rutherfords testified that, in his\n\nopinion, an appropriate monetary sanction would be $500,000, due to Hoskins’ affront to the\n\njudicial process and the court’s inherent power to protect the judicial process. The trial court\n\nordered that “based upon the scale of this litigation and the egregious conduct that abused the\n\njudicial process, the Prize Defendants shall have and recover attorneys’ fees in the sum of\n\n$100,000.00 from Hoskins as monetary sanctions, and that the Rutherford Defendants shall have\n\nand recover attorneys’ fees in the sum of $100,000.00 from Hoskins as monetary sanctions.”\n\n\n\n                                                  - 51 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       (2) Standard of Review. We review a trial court’s ruling on a motion for sanctions\n\nunder an abuse of discretion standard. Cire v. Cummings, 134 S.W.3d 835, 838 (Tex. 2004);\n\nVela v. Wagner & Brown, Ltd., 203 S.W.3d 37, 56 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2006, no pet.).\n\n“The test for an abuse of discretion is not whether, in the opinion of the reviewing court, the facts\n\npresent an appropriate case for the trial court’s action, but ‘whether the court acted without\n\nreference to any guiding rules and principles.’” Cire, 134 S.W.3d at 838-39 (quoting Downer v.\n\nAquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241 (Tex. 1985)). Therefore, we will reverse the\n\ntrial court’s ruling only if it was arbitrary or unreasonable. Cire, 134 S.W.3d at 839. In\n\nreviewing the imposition of sanctions, the appellate court examines the entire record, including\n\n“evidence” admitted at the hearing, arguments of counsel, the written discovery on file, and the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the party’s alleged discovery abuse. U.S. Fidelity & Guar. Co. v.\n\nRossa, 830 S.W.2d 668, 672 (Tex. App.—Waco 1992, writ denied).\n\n       (3) Applicable Law. The trial court has discretion to impose sanctions for discovery\n\nabuse under Rule 215.3. TEX. R. CIV. P. 215.3. There are three legitimate purposes of discovery\n\nsanctions: (1) to secure compliance with discovery rules; (2) to deter other litigants from similar\n\nmisconduct; and (3) to punish violators. Chrysler Corp. v. Blackmon, 841 S.W.2d 844, 849\n\n(Tex. 1992) (orig. proceeding); Bodnow Corp. v. City of Hondo, 721 S.W.2d 839, 840 (Tex.\n\n1986). Discovery sanctions must also be “just.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 215.2(b); Spohn Hosp. v.\n\nMayer, 104 S.W.3d 878, 882 (Tex. 2003); TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp. v. Powell, 811\n\nS.W.2d 913, 917 (Tex. 1991) (orig. proceeding) (“the punishment should fit the crime”). We\n\napply a two-part test to determine whether non-death penalty sanctions are just: (1) a direct\n\nrelationship between the offensive conduct and the sanction imposed must exist; and (2) the\n\nsanction imposed must not be excessive. Spohn Hosp., 104 S.W.3d at 882; TransAmerican, 811\n\n\n\n                                                - 52 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nS.W.2d at 917; Vela, 203 S.W.3d at 58. A “just” sanction must be directed against the abuse and\n\ntoward remedying the prejudice caused to the party. Spohn Hosp., 104 S.W.3d at 882. As to the\n\nsecond prong, the sanction should be no more severe than necessary to satisfy its legitimate\n\npurposes, and the court must first consider whether less stringent sanctions would promote full\n\ncompliance and deter future abuse. Id.; Blackmon, 841 S.W.2d at 849.\n\n       (4) Analysis. Hoskins first contends monetary sanctions were improper because they\n\nwere not pleaded or requested at or prior to the scheduled hearings; rather, Prize and the\n\nRutherfords sought only death penalty sanctions, not monetary sanctions. Hoskins relies on In re\n\nEstate of Gaines, 262 S.W.3d 50, 60 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.), which\n\nholds that “jurisdiction to render a judgment for attorney’s fees must be invoked by the\n\npleadings, and a judgment not supported by pleadings requesting an award of attorney’s fees is a\n\nnullity.” Gaines, however, is distinguishable because the order in that case did not impose\n\nsanctions, and, in fact, there was no notice or a hearing on the possibility of sanctions. Id. at 60-\n\n61. The court held that pleadings were required because the attorney’s fees were awarded\n\npursuant to a statutory provision. Id. Here, Rule 215.2 permits the imposition of sanctions after\n\n“notice and a hearing,” both of which were provided to Hoskins. TEX. R. CIV. P. 215.2(b).\n\nFurther, Prize and the Rutherfords were not required to specifically plead for monetary damages\n\nbecause “[c]ourts possess inherent powers to discipline attorney behavior through the imposition\n\nof sanctions sua sponte in appropriate cases.” Roberts v. Rose, 37 S.W.3d 31, 33 (Tex. App.—\n\nSan Antonio 2000, no pet.); see also In re Bennett, 960 S.W.2d 35, 40 (Tex. 1997) (orig.\n\nproceeding) (holding that even in the absence of an applicable rule or statute, a trial court has the\n\ninherent power to sanction a party for bad faith abuse of the judicial process). Moreover, the\n\nrange of sanctions available to the trial court under Rule 215 is quite broad. TransAmerican, 811\n\n\n\n                                                - 53 -\n\f                                                                                  04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nS.W.2d at 918; Clark v. Bres, 217 S.W.3d 501, 512 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet.\n\ndenied). Accordingly, we cannot conclude monetary sanctions were improper based on the\n\nabsence of proper pleadings.\n\n       Next, Hoskins complains that Prize and the Rutherfords failed to offer competent\n\nevidence of monetary harm suffered as a result of the alleged discovery abuse. Specifically,\n\nHoskins contends that because Prize and the Rutherfords did not introduce attorneys’ fees bills,\n\nthere was no evidence of the reasonable expenses related to the discovery abuse. When the\n\njudgment is not one for earned attorneys’ fees, but rather a judgment imposing attorneys’ fees as\n\nsanctions, it is not invalid because a party fails to prove attorneys’ fees. Scott Bader, Inc. v.\n\nSandstone Prods., Inc., 248 S.W.3d 802, 816 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, no pet.).\n\n“When attorney’s fees are assessed as sanctions, no proof of necessity or reasonableness is\n\nrequired.” Id. at 817 (quoting Miller v. Armogida, 877 S.W.2d 361, 365 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied)). Therefore, we cannot conclude the award of sanctions was\n\nimproper based on insufficient evidence.\n\n       Hoskins also argues the trial court abused its discretion in awarding monetary sanctions\n\nbecause there was no direct relationship between the discovery abuse and the sanction imposed.\n\nSpecifically, Hoskins maintains that its former counsel, Leitch, was solely responsible for the\n\nalleged discovery abuses. Hoskins argues that, of the discovery abuses cited, the only abuse that\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords allege Hoskins should have known about was the meeting between\n\nLeitch, Cliff Hoskins, and Rick Rudolph. The other alleged abuses involve Hoskins’ attendance\n\nat depositions, where he merely obtained knowledge of Leitch’s improprieties that had already\n\noccurred.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 54 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       The trial court must at least attempt to determine whether the offensive conduct is\n\nattributable only to counsel, only to the party, or to both. Paradigm Oil, Inc. v. Retamco\n\nOperating, Inc., 161 S.W.3d 531, 537 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2004, pet. denied) (citing\n\nTransAmerican, 811 S.W.2d at 917). Although a party should not be punished for counsel’s\n\nconduct in which the party is not implicated apart from having entrusted its legal representation\n\nto counsel, a party must bear some responsibility for its counsel’s discovery abuses when it is or\n\nshould be aware of counsel’s conduct and the violation of the discovery rules. Paradigm, 161\n\nS.W.3d at 537. Ultimately, the sanction imposed by the trial court must relate directly to the\n\nabuse found. Id.\n\n       Here, Prize and the Rutherfords presented some evidence that Hoskins was at least aware\n\nof Leitch’s misconduct. In his own deposition, Hoskins admitted that he authorized the letters\n\nsent by Leitch to nonparties on false letterhead as part of the investigation Leitch was\n\nconducting. Additionally, Hoskins verified interrogatory answers which sought information\n\nabout Leitch’s misconduct.     Hoskins was also put on notice of Leitch’s improper conduct\n\nbecause co-counsel was copied on Prize’s counsel’s communications to all counsel of record\n\ncomplaining of Leitch’s improper conduct. We conclude the record supports the trial court’s\n\nfinding that Hoskins, not just Leitch, should be sanctioned. Thus, there was a direct relationship\n\nbetween Hoskins’ conduct and the resulting sanctions.\n\n       Finally, Hoskins maintains that the award of $100,000 to each group of defendants was\n\nunreasonable, excessive, unrelated to the alleged discovery abuse, and constitutes an\n\nimpermissible penalty. Reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude the trial court’s order\n\nmeets both parts of the test for a “just” sanction based on the discovery abuse by Leitch.\n\nLeitch’s actions violated Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 4.01, 4.03, 4.04, and\n\n\n\n                                              - 55 -\n\f                                                                                                        04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n8.04. 32 See TEX. DISCIPLINARY R. PROF’L CONDUCT 4.01(a), 4.03, 4.04, 8.04(a)(3), reprinted in\n\nTEX. GOV’T CODE ANN., tit. 2, subtit. G app. A (West 2005). Such conduct involved an effort to\n\ntaint and obstruct the discovery process by way of witness tampering, misrepresentation of\n\ncounsel’s identity, securing documents under false pretenses, contacting represented witnesses in\n\nthe absence of their counsel, and falsely threatening witnesses with criminal prosecution. As\n\ndiscussed earlier, these actions were known to Hoskins, who continued to retain Leitch until\n\nLeitch was disqualified by the trial court. Given this egregious conduct, counsel for Prize and\n\nthe Rutherfords testified that a reasonable monetary sanction would be in the range of $300,000\n\nto $500,000. The trial court declined to grant death penalty sanctions, and instead awarded\n\nsanctions in the amount of $100,000 to both Prize and the Rutherford. We hold that based on\n\nthis record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in assessing $200,000 in sanctions for\n\ndiscovery abuse. Accordingly, we affirm the portion of the trial court’s judgment imposing\n\nsanctions against Hoskins.\n\n                                    BANK OF AMERICA’S CROSS-APPEAL\n\n         Finally, on cross-appeal, Bank of America challenges the summary judgment granted in\n\nfavor of Prize and the Rutherfords “on all claims by Bank of America, N.A., as Trustee of the\n\nBaker Trusts, including claims of fraud and rescission of the Ratification.” The Bank also\n\n32\n   Rule 4.01 provides: “In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly: (a) make a false\nstatement of material fact or law to a third person.” TEX.

Summary Judgment on the Bank’s Claims\n\n          (1) Relevant Factual Background.              As previously discussed, the Baker Lease\n\nterminated in August 2001 due to cessation of production for more than sixty consecutive days;\n\nthe Bank, however, was not aware that the Baker Lease had expired. In 2004, Cliff Hoskins\n\ninformed BP that he had information indicating that the Baker Lease, the El Paso Lease, and the\n\nJOA had expired. BP then alerted Prize that it had “received information indicating that . . .\n\nthere may have been no production from the [Leased] Property between June 2001 and April\n\n2002 and that reports filed with the Texas Railroad Commission did not properly reflect such\n\ncessation of production.” BP requested specific documents to determine the current status of the\n\nJOA, but Prize refused, maintaining that “there has been continuous production.” Prize advised\n\nBP to check production records filed with the Texas Railroad Commission.\n\n          In January 2005, attorneys for Hoskins sent Prize a demand letter claiming that the Baker\n\nLease, the El Paso Lease, and the JOA had expired in August 2001 because “there has not in fact\n\nbeen continuous production (or Operations to restore same) either in paying quantities or\n\notherwise in excess of at least one 60 day continuous period . . . .” Hoskins’ demand letter also\n\nalleges     that   Prize     concealed   the   expiration   of   the   Leases   and   the   JOA   “by\n\nmanipulating/fabricating production information and gas and condensate sales, and Revenue and\n\nRoyalty information and by misrepresenting production information and gas and condensate\n\nsales information . . . .”\n\n          Prize then amended production reports (“P-2s”) it had filed with the Railroad\n\nCommission in 2001. The amended P-2s, filed in 2005, reflect a reduction in the amount of gas\n\n\n\n                                                   - 57 -\n\f                                                                                              04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nproduced (measured in a thousand cubic feet of natural gas, abbreviated as “Mcf”) on the Baker\n\nWell No. 6 for June 2001 and on the Baker Well No. 4 for July 2001. The differences between\n\nthe two reports are summarized below:\n\n                P-2s filed in 2001                                    P-2s amended in 2005\n\nBaker No. 6                             Baker No. 4 Baker No. 6                          Baker No. 4\n\nJune 2001 1050 Mcf                     0 Mcf            June 2001 80 Mcf                 0 Mcf\n\nJuly 2001 1050 Mcf                      1085 Mcf        July 2001 1050 Mcf               0 Mcf\n\n\n\nThe 80 Mcf of gas reported for the Baker Well No. 6 in the amended report was attributed to\n\nfield use (70 Mcf) and a venting/flaring operation (10 Mcf).\n\n        On January 25, 2005, Hoskins filed suit to quiet title against Prize. As noted, supra, BP\n\nlater joined the suit as a plaintiff, also asserting that the Leases and JOA expired in 2001. Also\n\non January 25, 2005, the Rutherfords, acting for themselves and for Prize, approached the Bank,\n\nand requested that it sign a ratification of the Baker Lease. Rutherford representatives Mike\n\nRutherford, Dave Lewis, and Jack Chenowith met with Penny Judge, a Bank property manager,\n\nto discuss the proposed ratification. The Rutherford representatives told Judge that Hoskins’\n\nthreatened lawsuit was frivolous, but that even the threat of such a suit would cause them to stop\n\ndevelopment on the property, putting it at risk of drainage. Judge requested documentation\n\ndemonstrating that the Baker Lease had not expired.\n\n        In response to her request, Mike Rutherford sent Judge a letter on February 2, 2005\n\nattaching the Hoskins demand letter, a second letter from Hoskins’ attorneys, and production\n\ndata, including P-2s and gauge reports for the Baker Well No. 6. 33 In Rutherford’s letter to\n\n\n33\n  Mike Rutherford testified he obtained the P-2s and gauge reports from Prize and that Prize knew they would be\ngiven to the Bank as part of the ratification negotiation.\n\n                                                    - 58 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nJudge, he asserts that the Baker Lease did not terminate for cessation of production in 2001 for\n\nthe following reasons:\n\n       (a) the [Hoskins] Demand Letter ignores actual physical production of gas during\n       the period in question, (b) the Demand Letter relies heavily on the lack of\n       reported ‘sales’ of gas during June and July 2001, which we are informed by Prize\n       may be explained by mechanical conditions affecting the gas purchaser’s gas\n       metering equipment that was installed on the Lease at the time, (c) any failure to\n       produce constituted a temporary cessation of production, not a permanent\n       cessation, (d) the Demand Letter misstates the legal effect of a temporary\n       cessation of production under the Lease (and the other leases), even if one\n       assumed that a cessation of production occurred for any duration, and (e)\n       assuming that the Lease did terminate in mid-2001 (which we deny), the owners\n       of the Lessee’s interest under the Lease would have in any event acquired a\n       limitations title to the leasehold estate.\n\nRutherford’s letter concludes that Hoskins’ demand letter is simply an attempt to extort money\n\nfrom Prize, and asserts that Hoskins’ allegation could harm the Baker Trusts:\n\n       As we discussed with you, a suspension (or abandonment) of our drilling\n       activities caused by the mere existence of the allegation set forth in the Demand\n       Letter would expose [the Baker Property] to substantial drainage by offset\n       operators and thus, any delay in our operations will permanently and adversely\n       affect both the Working Interests Owners and the Baker Trusts.\n\nIn the letter, Rutherford also asserts the operators need assurance by way of a ratification that the\n\nBaker Lease remains in effect in order to avoid suspension of drilling activities.\n\n       Rutherford’s letter goes on to explain the P-2s and gauge reports. He states that the\n\nBaker Well No. 4 was shut-in for a swabbing operation in early April 2001; the operation was\n\nnot successful and the well was shut-in for further evaluation. He also states that the production\n\nvolumes from the Baker Well No. 6 were not fully registered by the gas metering equipment\n\nduring the relevant time period, and that Prize had confirmed that, “consistent with industry\n\npractice, the ‘sales’ figures reported on the Forms P-2 and HPL’s meter figures and the ‘lease\n\nuse’ figures are estimates of the quantities of gas consumed on the Lease for the operation of\n\nequipment and/or quantities lost to venting.” As for the gauge reports, Rutherford states in\n\n                                                - 59 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nAttachment C, entitled “Production Data,” that “the No. 6 well was ‘shut-in for buildup’ for\n\nmuch of June, all of July and the first half of August, but produced gas for a 3-day period in\n\nJune (June 15th through 17th). [T]hus, there was no cessation of production for more than sixty\n\nconsecutive days, as alleged in the Demand Letter.” (emphasis added). Lewis testified that he\n\nand Chenowith went over the P-2s and gauge reports with Judge, and that they highlighted this\n\n3-day period in June.\n\n       Judge took the ratification matter to her superior, Jeffrey Anderson, the Bank’s regional\n\nteam leader in the oil and gas asset management group.            Judge expressed her concern to\n\nAnderson that “if there was no ratification, . . . the operator would not drill wells and the\n\nhydrocarbons couldn’t be drained so there would be no royalties” for the Baker Trusts. She\n\ntestified in deposition that the Bank’s chief concern was future development, but that the\n\npossibility of drainage was also a concern. Judge viewed the ratification as the operator’s\n\n“insurance policy” to justify spending a substantial amount of money to drill new wells. Judge\n\nstated the Bank felt the Baker Lease had not terminated because the P-2s and gauge reports did\n\nnot show a cessation of production for more than sixty consecutive days and because the Bank\n\nhad been consistently receiving revenues.        She stated that the Bank decided to sign the\n\nratification because of concerns over drainage and future development, and to receive $106,000\n\nin consideration. Judge stated that had the Bank known that the Baker Lease had terminated, it\n\nwould have renegotiated a lease with a higher royalty. Judge acknowledged that the Hoskins\n\ndemand letter alleged that the Baker Lease had expired both because of a cessation of production\n\nexceeding sixty days and because of a failure to produce in paying quantities, but she could not\n\nrecall discussing or investigating the paying quantities issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 60 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n        Jeffrey Anderson also explained that the Bank did not pursue an investigation of the\n\npaying quantities issue because it would not have been able to get the necessary expense\n\ninformation from the operator. The Bank’s national trust oil and gas manager, Dick Sadler,\n\ntestified that most operators will not divulge their costs, and that in most cases the Bank would\n\nassume there is production in paying quantities if it is receiving royalty payments. The Bank\n\nconfirmed that it had been receiving royalty checks and therefore thought there were sales.\n\nAnderson further stated that the P-2s and gauge reports reflected production and that the Bank\n\nreceived payments on production during the relevant time period. Anderson testified that the\n\nBank’s reasoning for signing the ratification included ensuring development of the property and\n\nprotecting against drainage.\n\n        In his deposition, Mike Rutherford testified he told Judge that the ratification was sought\n\nas insurance to allow Prize and the Rutherfords to continue developing the property.             He\n\nacknowledged that he did not tell the Bank the following: that there was no production on the\n\nBaker Wells from June 1, 2001 to August 13, 2001; that the Baker Lease had expired in August\n\n2001; that the claimed venting of the Baker Well No. 6 did not occur; that Prize had paid\n\nroyalties on gas that was falsely reported; that Prize had filed false P-2s; or that Prize had filed\n\nfalse production reports.\n\n        On February 14, 2005, the Bank executed the Stipulation and Ratification of Oil and Gas\n\nLease (“the Ratification”) tendered by the Rutherfords. The Ratification provides, in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n        1. Each of the Baker Trusts and each of the Rutherfords (collectively, the\n           “Mineral Owners”) hereby stipulates and agrees that (a) the Lease is currently\n           in full force and effect and (b) the term of the Lease has been continuously\n           perpetuated since April 23, 1971, by either (i) the production of oil and/or gas\n           in paying quantities or (ii) operations, or both.\n\n\n\n                                               - 61 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n           2. Without limiting the foregoing, (a) each of the Baker Trusts hereby (i) ratifies\n              and adopts the Lease insofar as it covers or applies to the Leased Premises and\n              (ii) grants and leases the Leased Premises to the Lessees upon the terms and\n              provisions set forth in the Lease, and (b) each of the Rutherfords hereby (i)\n              ratifies and adopts the Lease insofar as it covers or applies to Survey 3 and\n              (iii) grants and leases Survey 3 to the Lessees upon the terms and provisions\n              set forth in the Lease.\n\n           3. Each of the Mineral Owners hereby waives and releases any and all claims\n              that the Lease terminated prior to the date of execution of this instrument for\n              any reason whatsoever.\n\n           After the Bank signed the Ratification, Hoskins amended its petition and named the Bank\n\nas a defendant. 34 It was during the course of discovery proceedings related to that lawsuit that\n\nthe Bank learned that the Leases and the JOA actually had terminated in 2001, that the\n\nrepresentations on which it relied in signing the Ratification were false, and that Prize and the\n\nRutherfords knew those representations were false. Hoskins nonsuited its claims against the\n\nBank, and the Bank asserted affirmative claims against Prize and the Rutherfords, including a\n\nrequest for a declaration that the Baker Lease terminated in August 2001. The Bank also sought\n\nrescission of the Ratification on grounds including fraudulent inducement, mutual mistake, and\n\nfailure of consideration.\n\n           With respect to the fraudulent inducement claim, the Bank alleged that Prize and the\n\nRutherfords made the following misrepresentations:\n\n           (1) the Baker Lease did not terminate; (2) the Baker No. 6 Well was flared on\n           June 15, 16, and 17, 2001; (3) flaring of the Baker No. 6 Well in June 2001\n           constituted production for purposes of the 60-day cessation of production clause\n           in the Baker Lease; (4) there was no cessation of production for a period\n           exceeding 60 days; (5) the Leased Property was at risk of substantial drainage if\n           the Bank did not sign the Ratification; and (6) signing the Ratification would\n           protect the Bank from the risk of drainage.\n\n\n\n\n34\n     Burlington signed a similar ratification document concerning the El Paso Lease.\n\n\n                                                         - 62 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nThe Bank also alleged that Prize and the Rutherfords failed to disclose that:\n\n       (1) Prize’s own internal documents show that no venting or flaring of the Baker\n       No. 6 Well occurred in June 2001 and that there was a cessation of production for\n       a period exceeding 60 days in the summer of 2001; (2) royalties paid in December\n       2001 for June 2001 were not based on actual gas sales but were based on gas that\n       was purportedly vented into the atmosphere; and (3) taxes paid in 2002 for gas\n       allegedly produced in June 2001 were not based on gas sales but were based on\n       the alleged venting operation.\n\nThe Bank alleged that these misrepresentations and concealments were material, made with\n\nknowledge of their falsity, or asserted recklessly without knowledge of the truth, were intended\n\nto be relied upon and were relied upon by the Bank to its detriment.\n\n       Thereafter, Prize and the Rutherfords jointly filed a traditional and no-evidence motion\n\nfor summary judgment as to all causes of action asserted against them by Hoskins, BP, the Bank,\n\nand Burlington. In the motion, they contend the Bank’s claims are precluded by the Ratification.\n\nFurther, the Bank’s claim that the Ratification was fraudulently induced fails because the alleged\n\nmisrepresentations concerning flaring and production were neither material or justifiably relied\n\nupon by the Bank as a matter of law.\n\n       The Bank filed separate responses to the no-evidence and traditional summary judgment\n\nmotion, to which Prize and the Rutherfords filed a joint reply. In its interlocutory judgment\n\ndated February 5, 2009, the trial court granted Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ motion for summary\n\njudgment on all claims by the Bank, including its claims of fraud and rescission of the\n\nRatification. The court ordered that the Bank take nothing on its claims against Prize and the\n\nRutherfords. The trial court’s final judgment incorporated the interlocutory judgment and taxed\n\nPrize’s and the Rutherfords’ costs against the Bank; the Bank was also ordered to bear its own\n\ncosts. The Bank timely filed its notice of cross-appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 63 -\n\f                                                                                                 04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n        (2) Summary of the Bank’s Argument. The Bank asserts the record and the trial\n\ncourt’s rulings establish that the basis for granting summary judgment against the Bank was the\n\ntrial court’s enforcement of the Ratification and its denial, as a matter of law, of the Bank’s claim\n\nthat the Ratification was fraudulently induced. On appeal, the Bank contends the trial court erred\n\nin granting a take-nothing summary judgment on all of its affirmative claims because: (1) Prize’s\n\nand the Rutherfords’ motion did not challenge each asserted ground for fraudulent inducement;\n\n(2) Prize and the Rutherfords did not conclusively establish that the entire Ratification was not\n\nvitiated by fraud; (3) Prize and the Rutherfords did not conclusively establish that their\n\nmisrepresentations concerning flaring and cessation of production were not material and that the\n\nBank did not justifiably rely on them; (4) the Bank raised a genuine issue of material fact on each\n\nchallenged element of the Bank’s claim for fraudulent inducement; and (5) the Bank raised a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact concerning Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ liability for trespass. 35\n\nAdditionally, the Bank contends the trial court abused its discretion in allocating all of Prize’s\n\nand the Rutherfords’ court costs to the Bank.\n\n        (3) Fraudulent Inducement. On appeal, the Bank complains the trial court erred in\n\ngranting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the Bank’s claim for fraudulent\n\ninducement.      We review the summary judgment under the standard of review previously\n\narticulated. Fraudulent inducement is a type of fraud claim that requires a showing that a false\n\nmaterial misrepresentation was made that (1) was either known to be false when made or was\n\nasserted without knowledge of the truth, (2) was intended to be relied upon, (3) was relied upon,\n\nand (4) caused injury. See Formosa Plastics Corp. USA v. Presidio Eng’rs & Contractors, Inc.,\n\n960 S.W.2d 41, 47 (Tex. 1998); Am. Tobacco Co., Inc. v. Grinnell, 951 S.W.2d 420, 436 (Tex.\n\n\n35\n   The Bank adopts the briefing by Hoskins on the issue of trespass and we previously addressed and overruled that\nissue in the section on trespass.\n\n                                                      - 64 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n1997).    “Failing to disclose information is equivalent to a false representation only when\n\nparticular circumstances impose a duty on a party to speak, and the party deliberately remains\n\nsilent.” In re Int’l Profit Assocs., Inc., 274 S.W.3d 672, 678 (Tex. 2009) (orig. proceeding)\n\n(citing Bradford v. Vento, 48 S.W.3d 749, 755 (Tex. 2001)).\n\n         In their traditional motion for summary judgment, Prize and the Rutherfords did not\n\ncontest that their representations to the Bank were false, that they were known to be false when\n\nmade or were made without knowledge of their truth, that they intended for the Bank to rely\n\nupon them, or that the Bank’s reliance caused it injury, nor did they contend that they did not\n\nhave a duty to speak. Thus, for summary judgment purposes, these elements of fraudulent\n\ninducement are not in dispute. Prize and the Rutherfords moved for summary judgment on the\n\nBank’s claim for fraudulent inducement on the grounds that, as a matter of law: (1) any\n\nmisrepresentation concerning flaring is not material and could not have been justifiably relied\n\nupon because the Bank does not believe that flaring constitutes production; (2) any\n\nmisrepresentation that the Baker Lease had not expired due to a cessation of production for more\n\nthan sixty days is not material and could not have been justifiably relied upon because the Lease\n\ncould also have expired for failure to produce in paying quantities; and (3) the Bank not only\n\nratified the Baker Lease, but also entered into a new lease. We address each ground in turn.\n\n         A. Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Flaring\n\n         The Bank first contends Prize and the Rutherfords did not conclusively establish that\n\ntheir misrepresentations and omissions concerning flaring were not material or that the Bank did\n\nnot justifiably rely on them. We agree.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 65 -\n\f                                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n           Materiality\n\n           A representation is “material” if “a reasonable person would attach importance to [it] and\n\nwould be induced to act on [it] in determining his choice of actions in the transaction in\n\nquestion.” Citizens Nat’l Bank v. Allen Rae Invs., Inc., 142 S.W.3d 459, 478-79 (Tex. App.—\n\nForth Worth 2004, no pet.). Here, before signing the Ratification, Prize and the Rutherfords\n\nrepresented to the Bank that flaring occurred on the Baker Well No. 6 in June 2001; Prize and\n\nthe Rutherfords now concede this statement was false. 36 Prize and the Rutherfords, however,\n\ncontend this misrepresentation is immaterial because the Bank did not believe that flaring\n\nconstitutes production. In support, Prize and the Rutherfords point to the deposition testimony of\n\nAnthony Gatti, Burlington’s corporate representative, and Peter Huddleston, plaintiffs’ 37 retained\n\nexpert, as well as the Bank’s admission number 37. 38 However, the testimony of Burlington’s\n\ncorporate representative is no evidence of a belief held by a different entity, the Bank.\n\nAdditionally, although Huddleston opined that flaring is not production, there is no evidence that\n\nhe conveyed his opinion to the Bank at or before the time the Ratification was signed; in fact, the\n\nrecord reflects that the Bank did not become his client until it “joined the proceeding,” which\n\nwas well after the Ratification was signed.\n\n           Finally, admission number 37 merely establishes that it is the Bank’s present belief that\n\nflaring does not constitute production. A party’s knowledge of falsity before or at the time of\n\nreliance is the only relevant inquiry in a fraud claim; knowledge gained after the fact cannot\n\n36\n   As previously noted, in their motion for summary judgment, the Rutherfords and Prize conceded that “[f]or\npurposes of summary judgment, the court may assume there was no flaring” on the Baker No. 6 Well from June 2,\n2001 through August 11, 2001; thus, it is established for summary judgment purposes that there was a cessation of\nproduction for a period exceeding sixty consecutive days; it is also established for summary judgment purposes that\nthe Baker Lease terminated in August 2001.\n37\n     Huddleston stated he was initially hired by BP, but also worked for Hoskins, Burlington, and the Bank.\n38\n  In response to request for admission No. 37, the Bank admitted that flaring does not constitute “production” for\npurposes of the 60-day cessation of production clause in the Baker Lease.\n\n                                                         - 66 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nvitiate the fraud. Pankow v. Colonial Life Ins. Co. of Tex., 932 S.W.2d 271, 277 n.6 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Amarillo 1996, writ denied). The summary judgment record raises a fact issue that at the\n\ntime the Bank signed the Ratification, it relied on the written materials provided by Prize and the\n\nRutherfords which indicated that flaring is considered production sufficient to hold the Baker\n\nLease.    Specifically, Mike Rutherford’s letter to Judge stated that the Baker Well No. 6\n\n“produced gas for a 3-day period in June (June 15th through 17th)” 2001 and again in mid-\n\nAugust; “thus, there was no cessation of production for more than sixty consecutive days, as\n\nalleged in the Demand Letter.” This assertion is based on the production data, which shows\n\n“flaring to tank” for the three days in question. Thus, Prize and the Rutherfords represented that\n\nflaring constituted production sufficient to hold the Baker Lease. Both Judge and Anderson\n\ntestified that the Bank decided to sign the Ratification based on Rutherford’s assurance that the\n\nLease had not terminated; this assurance was based on the production data showing that there\n\nhad been no cessation of production (due to flaring). Hence, the misrepresentation regarding\n\nflaring was material because it induced the Bank to sign the Ratification. See Citizens Nat’l\n\nBank, 142 S.W.3d at 478-79.\n\n         Reliance\n\n         Further, we cannot conclude that Prize and the Rutherfords established as a matter of law\n\nthat the Bank did not justifiably rely on the misrepresentations and omissions regarding flaring.\n\nThe issue of justifiable reliance is generally a question of fact. 1001 McKinney Ltd. v. Credit\n\nSuisse First Boston Mortg. Capital, 192 S.W.3d 20, 30 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005,\n\npet. denied). Judge testified the Bank felt that the Baker Lease had not terminated because the P-\n\n2s and gauge reports provided by Prize and the Rutherfords did not show a cessation of\n\nproduction for more than sixty consecutive days and because the Bank had been consistently\n\n\n\n                                               - 67 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nreceiving revenues. She stated that had the Bank known the Baker Lease had terminated, it\n\nwould have renegotiated a lease with a higher royalty. Viewing the facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to the Bank, we conclude this evidence raises a fact issue regarding the Bank’s reliance\n\non the misrepresentations made by Prize and the Rutherfords.\n\n       B. Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Cessation of Production\n\n       Next, the Bank contends Prize and the Rutherfords did not conclusively establish that\n\ntheir statements and omissions concerning cessation of production were not material or that the\n\nBank did not justifiably rely upon them.\n\n       Materiality\n\n       Materiality is determined by examining whether a reasonable person would attach\n\nimportance to and would be induced to act on the information in determining his choice of\n\nactions in the transaction in question. Reservoir Sys., Inc. v. TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Co.,\n\nL.P., No. 14-09-00528-CV, 2010 WL 4467534, at *5 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Nov. 9,\n\n2010, pet. filed); Am. Med. Int’l v. Giurintano, 821 S.W.2d 331, 338 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 1991, no writ). “In the context of fraudulent inducement, it is well established that a\n\n‘representation is material if it induces a party to enter a contract.’” Reservoir Sys., 2010 WL\n\n4467534, at *5 (quoting Brush v. Reata Oil & Gas Corp., 984 S.W.2d 720, 727 (Tex. App.—\n\nWaco 1998, pet. denied)). “Even if a misrepresentation is not a party’s sole inducement for\n\nentering into the contract, it may still be material so long as the party relied on it.” Reservoir\n\nSys., 2010 WL 4467534, at *5.\n\n        In their motion for summary judgment, Prize and the Rutherfords claimed that their\n\nmisrepresentations regarding cessation of production were not material because (1) the Bank was\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 68 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\naware of a claim that the Baker Lease had expired for failure to produce in paying quantities, and\n\n(2) Prize and the Rutherfords made no misrepresentation concerning the paying quantities issue.\n\n       First, although the Bank was aware of the claim regarding paying quantities contained in\n\nHoskins’ demand letter, it was not the focus of Rutherford’s letter to Judge; rather, cessation of\n\nproduction in excess of sixty days is the express reason Rutherford cites for Hoskins’ conclusion\n\nthat the Baker Lease expired. As previously discussed, however, Prize and the Rutherfords\n\nassured the Bank that there was no validity to the cessation of production allegation, and\n\ntherefore induced the Bank to sign the Ratification.        Clearly then, the misrepresentation\n\nregarding cessation of production, regardless of the Bank’s knowledge of the paying quantities\n\nclaim, was material. See Citizens Nat’l Bank, 142 S.W.3d at 478-79 (representation is material if\n\na reasonable person would be induced to act on it in determining his choice of actions).\n\n       Second, we disagree that the summary judgment evidence establishes that Prize and the\n\nRutherfords did not make a misrepresentation regarding the paying quantities issue.          Jack\n\nChenowith testified that when the Rutherfords asked the Bank to sign the Ratification, they\n\nrepresented to the Bank that the Leases had not terminated. Such a blanket statement implicitly\n\nindicates the Baker Lease did not terminate for any reason, including for failure to produce in\n\npaying quantities. Additionally, the record contains evidence that Rutherford did not tell the\n\nBank that Prize paid royalty and working interest owners for gas that was falsely reported. Thus,\n\nthere is summary judgment evidence raising a fact issue that Prize and the Rutherfords concealed\n\nthat the Lease had terminated, both for cessation of production and for failure to produce in\n\npaying quantities. Accordingly, we cannot conclude Prize and the Rutherfords established that\n\ntheir misrepresentations regarding cessation of production were not material as a matter of law.\n\nSee Brush, 984 S.W.2d at 727.\n\n\n\n                                              - 69 -\n\f                                                                                                  04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n        Reliance\n\n        Moreover, we cannot conclude Prize and the Rutherfords conclusively established that\n\nthe Bank did not justifiably rely on their misrepresentations and omissions regarding cessation of\n\nproduction. Although Prize and the Rutherfords contend that the Bank failed to investigate\n\nwhether the Baker Lease terminated for failure to produce in paying quantifies, the Bank was\n\njustified in relying on Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ statements that the Lease had not terminated.\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords were the operators and had superior access to the necessary production\n\nand expense information. As Anderson testified, the Bank had no reason to disbelieve the\n\nrepresentation that the Baker Lease produced in paying quantities because the Rutherfords, not\n\nthe Bank, were the ones with access to such information. Again, justifiable reliance is generally\n\na question of fact. 1001 McKinney, 192 S.W.3d at 30. We therefore hold that based on this\n\nrecord, Prize and the Rutherfords failed to establish that the Bank did not justifiably rely on\n\nPrize’s and the Rutherfords’ misrepresentations and omissions as a matter of law.\n\n        (4) Fact versus non-actionable opinion. Prize and the Rutherfords attempt to justify\n\nthe summary judgment granted in their favor on the ground that they made only statements of\n\nopinion. They portray the Bank’s fraudulent inducement claim as based on two representations\n\nmade by Mike Rutherford, both of which are non-actionable opinions: (1) that Prize and the\n\nRutherfords would ultimately prevail in litigation by establishing Hoskins’ claims were\n\nmeritless, and (2) that abandonment of drilling could expose the property to drainage by others. 39\n\n\n\n39\n   In their briefing, Prize and the Rutherfords also assert there is no evidence they represented that the property\nsubject to the Baker Lease would risk substantial drainage if the Ratification was not signed. Therefore, they argue\nthe trial court properly dismissed this fraud claim. We disagree. The essence of the Bank’s claim regarding the\ndrainage statement is that Prize and the Rutherfords used that statement to wrongly induce the Bank to quickly sign\nthe Ratification. In that regard, the summary judgment evidence raises a fact question as to whether Prize and the\nRutherfords made this statement, while concealing the fact that the Baker Lease had terminated due to non-\nproduction, in order to avoid the consequences of the terminating old lease and to prevent the Bank from negotiating\na new, more favorable lease. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the Bank’s fraud\n\n                                                       - 70 -\n\f                                                                                               04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nWe disagree with Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ attempt to recast and limit the Bank’s fraud claim\n\nand their characterization of the statements at issue as mere opinion. As their pleadings and\n\nsummary judgment evidence reflect, the Bank alleged and presented evidence of more than two\n\nmisrepresentations and concealments of material fact. Furthermore, the Bank alleged Prize and\n\nthe Rutherfords made numerous discrete statements of fact. For example, the statement that the\n\nBaker Well No. 6 “produced gas for a 3-day period in June” is an affirmative and discrete\n\nstatement of fact, not an opinion, which Prize and the Rutherfords now concede was false. See\n\nMarshall, 288 S.W.3d at 444 (statements concerning continuous operations and no cessation of\n\noperations for more than 60 days were factual representations, not mere opinions). Finally, even\n\nstatements of opinion are actionable if the opinion is “based on or buttressed with false facts,” if\n\nthe speaker knows the statement is false, or if the speaker purports to have special knowledge of\n\nthe facts or actually has superior knowledge of the facts. Transport Ins. Co. v. Faircloth, 898\n\nS.W.2d 269, 277 (Tex. 1995). Here, the summary judgment evidence raises a fact question\n\nsufficient to defeat summary judgment that Prize and the Rutherfords, as the working interest\n\nowners of the wells in question, made false statements of fact to the Bank. See id. at 276\n\n(“Whether a statement is an actionable statement of ‘fact’ or merely one of ‘opinion’ often\n\ndepends on the circumstances in which a statement is made.”).\n\n        (5) New Lease. Prize and the Rutherfords also moved for summary judgment on the\n\nbasis that even if the Ratification was procured by fraud, the Bank’s fraudulent inducement claim\n\nmust fail because the Ratification revived the Baker Lease. Prize and the Rutherfords contended\n\nthat paragraph 2(a)(ii) of the Ratification re-leased the property by providing that each of\n\nBurlington, the Baker Trusts, and the Rutherfords additionally “grants and leases the Leased\n\n\nclaim as it relates to the drainage representation. See Grinnell, 951 S.W.2d at 425 (summary judgment improperly\ngranted when genuine issue of material fact exists).\n\n                                                     - 71 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nPremises to Lessees upon the terms and conditions set forth in the [original] Lease. . . . ” Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords assert that this “granting” language created new or renewal leases with the\n\nsame terms and conditions as the original leases, in the event the old leases had expired. We\n\nreject this argument. Fraud as to the Ratification vitiates the entire agreement. “[Texas] courts\n\nhave consistently held that fraud vitiates whatever it touches. . . .” Stonecipher’s Estate v. Butts’\n\nEstate, 591 S.W.2d 806, 809 (Tex. 1979). As discussed above, there is evidence in this summary\n\njudgment record showing that the Bank would not have signed the Ratification as a whole but for\n\nthe material misrepresentations made by Prize and the Rutherfords and justifiably relied upon by\n\nthe Bank. As Judge testified, had the Bank known the Baker Lease had terminated, it would not\n\nhave signed the Ratification, but instead would have attempted to renegotiate a higher royalty.\n\nTherefore, we conclude the mere fact that the Ratification contains renewal or revivor language\n\ndoes not establish as a matter of law that the Bank was not induced to execute the Ratification by\n\nPrize’s and the Rutherfords’ misrepresentations that the Baker Lease had not expired.\n\n       (6) Ratification and Waiver. Finally, in their briefing, Prize and the Rutherfords also\n\nargue the Bank performed under the Ratification by signing division orders in 2006 and allowing\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords to drill under the Baker Lease, thereby ratifying the agreement and\n\nwaiving any right to assert fraud as a ground to avoid or rescind the Ratification. However, these\n\ncontentions were not raised as grounds in the motion for summary judgment. TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n166a(c) (motion for summary judgment must “state the specific grounds therefor” and the issues\n\nmust be “expressly set out in the motion”); Stiles v. Resolution Trust Corp., 867 S.W.2d 24, 26\n\n(Tex. 1993) (summary judgment cannot be affirmed on grounds not expressly presented in the\n\nsummary judgment motion, answer, or other response). Accordingly, we decline to consider\n\nthese contentions as a basis for affirming the summary judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                - 72 -\n\f                                                                                                  04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n        Based on the foregoing, we sustain the Bank’s first issue on cross-appeal, and reverse the\n\ngranting of summary judgment on its claim for fraudulent inducement. Because enforcement of\n\nthe Ratification was central to all of the Bank’s claims for affirmative relief, we also reverse the\n\nsummary judgment granted on the Bank’s remaining claims for affirmative relief, and remand\n\nthe cause to the trial court for further proceedings. 40\n\nII. Assessment of Costs\n\n        We additionally sustain the Bank’s second issue on cross-appeal because we agree that\n\nthe trial court erred in allocating all of Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ costs of court to the Bank.\n\nRule 131 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that, “[t]he successful party to a suit\n\nshall recover of his adversary all costs incurred therein, except where otherwise provided.” TEX.\n\nR. CIV. P. 131. Rule 141 further provides that “the [c]ourt may, for good cause, to be stated on\n\nthe record, adjudge the costs otherwise than as provided by law or these rules.” TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n141. A “successful party” is “one who obtains a judgment of a competent court of jurisdiction\n\nvindicating a civil claim of right.” Moore v. Trevino, 94 S.W.3d 723, 729 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 2002, pet. denied).\n\n        While the trial court denied all of the Bank’s claims against Prize and the Rutherfords by\n\nsummary judgment based on its enforcement of the Ratification, the court also denied Prize’s\n\nand the Rutherfords’ counterclaims against the Bank. Despite the fact that both parties were\n\npartially successful, the trial court assessed all of Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ costs against the\n\nBank without stating on the record the reason for doing so. We conclude such an assessment\n\nwas contrary to Rules 131 and 141. Because the trial court abused its discretion in assessing all\n\ncosts against the Bank, San Antonio Housing Auth. v. Underwood, 782 S.W.2d 25, 27 (Tex.\n\n40\n   Prize and the Rutherfords argue that the Bank must choose between rescission of the Ratification and damages for\nfraud. See Foley v. Parlier, 68 S.W.3d 870, 882 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2002, no pet.). Such an election, however,\nis not proper at this time, and will be determined in the trial court.\n\n                                                      - 73 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nApp.—San Antonio 1989, no writ) (assessment of court costs is a matter within the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court), we reverse the portion of the judgment assessing costs against the\n\nBank, and remand the issue of those court costs to the trial court for reconsideration.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n        Based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude the trial court’s judgment should be\n\naffirmed in part, modified and affirmed in part, reversed and rendered in part, and reversed and\n\nremanded in part, as follows:\n\n        1. We affirm the portion of the trial court’s judgment rendering declaratory relief on the\n\nquestion of title;\n\n        2. We affirm the trial court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Prize and the\n\nRutherfords on the claims of trespass;\n\n        3. We affirm the trial court’s calculation and award of damages to Hoskins and BP, with\n\nthe following exceptions:\n\n        (a) we sustain BP’s issue on cross-appeal challenging the in-kind payment and modify\n\nthe judgment to strike the last sentence of the last substantive paragraph of the judgment\n\npermitting Prize and the Rutherfords to satisfy their obligations to account to Hoskins and BP\n\n“by tendering their applicable share of gas in kind at the wellhead in lieu of payment;”\n\n        (b) we sustain the Rutherford Children’s issue challenging their liability for damages, and\n\nmodify the judgment to reflect that the damages award is not assessed against the Rutherford\n\nChildren; and\n\n        (c) we sustain the Rutherfords’ issue on joint and several liability, and modify the\n\njudgment to delete the imposition of joint and several liability among all the defendants;\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 74 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       4. We hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorneys’ fees to the\n\nparties, except that we sustain Hoskins’ and BP’s issue on cross-appeal and hold the court erred\n\nin denying their request for attorneys’ fees and judgment is rendered that both Hoskins and BP\n\neach recover $900,000 in attorneys’ fees;\n\n       5. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in awarding pre-judgment interest on the\n\ndamages award, and modify the judgment to delete the assessment of pre-judgment interest;\n\n       6. We affirm the trial court’s imposition of $200,000 in sanctions against Hoskins; and\n\n       7. We reverse the trial court’s grant of summary judgment on all the Bank’s claims, and\n\nreverse the assessment of costs against the Bank, and remand to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings on the Bank’s claims. In all other respects, the trial court’s judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                  Phylis J.

Five parties appeal from the judgment.\n\f                                                                                              04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n                              FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n        The underlying lawsuit arises out of a title dispute to mineral interests in a 690.54-acre\n\ntract known as the Baker Property, which comprises Section 3, Seale & Morris Survey A-434, in\n\nMcMullen County, Texas. In 2001, the period of time relevant to this appeal, there were four\n\nowners of the mineral estate in the Baker Property:\n\n        •   Burlington Resources, which owned a 25% mineral interest acquired from El Paso\n\n            Natural Gas Company which had entered into a written lease with P.R. Rutherford in\n\n            1966 known as the “El Paso Lease,” which was still in effect in early 2001.\n\n        •   The Baker Trusts, 1 represented by Bank of America (the “Bank”) as trustee, which\n\n            owned a 25% mineral interest and through Earl M. Baker had entered into a written\n\n            lease with P.R. Rutherford in 1965 known as the “Baker Lease,” which was still in\n\n            effect in early 2001.\n\n        •   Michael G. Rutherford and Patrick R. Rutherford, Jr., and their children, who are the\n\n            heirs of P.R. Rutherford, and Rutherford Oil Corporation (collectively, “the\n\n            Rutherfords”), who owned a 25% mineral interest subject to the Baker Lease.\n\n        •   BP America Production Company (“BP”), successor to Atlantic Richfield Company\n\n            (“ARCO”), which owned a 25% mineral interest that was not subject to a written\n\n            lease.\n\n        A joint operating agreement (“JOA”) covered the Baker Property (the “Unit Area”). The\n\nJOA was entered into in 1967 between ARCO, as a 25% mineral interest owner and the operator,\n\nand P.R. Rutherford, W. Earl Rowe, T.J. Goad, Patrick Rutherford, Jr., and Michael C.\n\n\n1\n  The beneficiaries of the “Baker Trusts” are the heirs of Earl M. Baker. The “Baker Trusts” include the Bettye\nBaker Brown Trust, u/w, f/b/o William David Deiss, the Bettye Baker Brown Trust, u/w, f/b/o Diane Elizabeth\nMysliwiec, the Bettye Baker Brown Trust, u/w, f/b/o Paula Jane Roberts, and the Bettye Baker Brown Trust, u/w,\nf/b/o Dorothy Baker Shaw 1966 Trust.\n\n                                                     -2-\n\f                                                                                                        04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nRutherford (the “P.R. Rutherford Group”) as the owners of the leasehold interests. The P.R.\n\nRutherford Group contributed the El Paso and Baker Leases (jointly, the “Leases”), covering\n\n75% of the mineral interests in the Baker Property, to the JOA. ARCO’s 25% mineral interest\n\nwas not subject to a written lease, but was contributed to the JOA so that the Baker Property\n\ncould be developed as a whole. The mechanism for this was Article 3 of the JOA, which created\n\na “deemed lease” 2 covering any unleased mineral interest that had been contributed to the Unit\n\nArea—i.e., ARCO’s unleased 25% mineral interest. Therefore, from 1967 forward, 100% of the\n\nmineral interest in the Baker Property was subject to the JOA, with ARCO serving as the\n\noperator of all drilling operations and production in the Unit Area. As a mineral owner, ARCO\n\nwas entitled to receive 25% of the 1/8 royalty under the JOA, and retained a possibility of\n\nreverter 3 of its mineral interest if the JOA ever terminated. After the JOA was signed, two\n\nsuccessful wells were drilled on the Baker Property (Baker Well Nos. 4 and 6).\n\n         The El Paso and Baker Leases each contained a “continuous production or operations”\n\nclause providing for continuation of the lease after the expiration of its primary term for as long\n\nas operations or production was on-going.                   The clauses were substantially the same, and\n\nprovided that the lease would “remain in force so long as drilling, mining or reworking\n\noperations are prosecuted (whether on the same or different wells) with no cessation of more\n\nthan sixty (60) consecutive days, and if they result in production, so long thereafter as oil or gas\n\nis produced from said land or land pooled therewith.” With respect to the term of the JOA,\n\n2\n  Article 3 of the JOA provides in relevant part, “If it develops that any interest owned and contributed by a party\nhereto is an unleased interest in the oil and gas rights, then such unleased interest shall be treated for all purposes of\nthis agreement as if it were an oil and gas lease covering such unleased interest on a form providing for the usual\nand customary one-eighth royalty . . . .” The parties refer to this provision as the “deemed lease,” so we will use that\nterm as well.\n3\n  A possibility of reverter is the future interest in a determinable fee grant that the mineral owner retains after\nexecuting an oil and gas lease.

After the 1986 sale, Prize and\n\nthe P.R. Rutherford Group were the operators under the JOA on the Baker Property from 1986\n\nforward.\n\n         During June–August 2001, there was a 71-day period when no well on the Baker\n\nProperty was operating or producing in paying quantities. 4 None of the lessors were aware of\n\nthe cessation of operations, and no one raised any concern at the time. In the following years,\n\nPrize (through Cimarex Energy), and then Gruy Petroleum/Rutherford Oil, 5 continued\n\ndeveloping the Baker Property and drilled and completed seven more wells, the Baker Well Nos.\n\n7-13; four of those wells were producing wells.\n\n         In 2004, Cliff Hoskins, who had no previous connection to the Baker Property, conducted\n\nsome research on leases in the area, and became aware of the possible termination of the Baker\n\nProperty’s Leases and the JOA in August 2001. Hoskins, through his company Cliff Hoskins,\n\nInc. (“Hoskins”), contacted BP (f/k/a ARCO), and offered to buy its 25% mineral interest which\n\n4\n  At trial, Prize and the Rutherfords argued that flaring on one of the Baker wells conducted in June 2001 was\nsufficient to constitute “operations,” but the trial court disagreed, and this particular finding has not been appealed;\ntherefore, we must accept as true that there was no production or operations on the Baker Property for 71 continuous\ndays.\n5\n In April 2002, Gruy Petroleum Management Co. succeeded Prize as the operator on the Baker Property, with\nRutherford Oil Corporation acting as the operator for some of the wells, including Baker Well No. 11.\n\n\n                                                         -4-\n\f                                                                                                        04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nHoskins asserted had reverted to BP in August 2001—when the JOA had purportedly terminated\n\ndue to the cessation of operations. On June 25, 2004, BP sent a letter to Magnum Hunter\n\nResources, Inc. 6 questioning whether production on the Baker Property had ceased between June\n\n2001 and April 2002, and requesting documents to confirm production—including meter\n\nreadings, allocation statements, and check details relating to payments for gas produced.\n\nMagnum Hunter responded that, “[t]here has been continuous production, under the terms of the\n\nleases and the operating agreement . . .,” and provided none of the requested documents.\n\n           Hoskins filed suit to quiet title on January 25, 2005. 7 One month later, in February 2005,\n\nthe Rutherfords, the Bank, and Burlington all signed ratifications of the El Paso and Baker\n\nLeases (the “Ratifications”), which purported to extend or renew the Leases that made up 75% of\n\nthe interests subject to the JOA; the other 25% was made up of ARCO/BP’s unleased interest\n\nwhich was contributed to the JOA. BP subsequently filed its own suit against Prize and the\n\nRutherfords in October 2005. In 2007, BP deeded its claimed (reverted) 25% mineral interest to\n\nHoskins, making the transfer retroactive to August 16, 2004. In the sale to Hoskins, BP reserved\n\na 6.25% nonparticipating royalty interest in the 25% mineral interest it conveyed to Hoskins.\n\n           In their suits against Prize and the Rutherfords, Hoskins and BP asserted claims to quiet\n\ntitle to their interests and for declaratory relief, plus claims for bad faith trespass,\n\ntheft/conversion, recovery of unpaid proceeds under the Texas Natural Resources Code, breach\n\nof contract, and recovery of attorney’s fees. The Bank, as trustee for the Baker Trusts, also\n\nasserted various claims against Prize and the Rutherfords, including claims for fraud, trespass,\n\nand theft, rescission of its Ratification, and to quiet title to the Baker Trusts’ mineral interest.\n\n\n\n6\n    The June 25, 2004 letter identifies Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc. as a successor operator to Prize under the JOA.\n7\n    Hoskins claimed standing based on a retroactive transfer of BP’s 25% mineral interest to Hoskins.\n\n                                                          -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       Competing summary judgment motions were filed by all the parties. On February 5,\n\n2009, the trial court signed an “Interlocutory Judgment” in which it:\n\n       1. Granted the summary judgment motion by Prize and the Rutherfords on “all\n       Plaintiffs’ claims of trespass,” and ordered that Plaintiffs “take nothing . . . on any\n       trespass claim in this cause;”\n\n       2. Granted the summary judgment motion by Prize and the Rutherfords on all\n       claims by the Bank, “including claims of fraud and rescission of the Ratification,”\n       and ordered that the Bank take nothing;\n\n       3. Granted the declaratory relief sought by Hoskins and BP, finding (i) the El\n       Paso and Baker Leases and the JOA all terminated in August 2001, at which time\n       Hoskins/BP’s mineral rights and interests reverted free and clear from the JOA,\n       making them unleased co-tenants; (2) from August 2001 through August 15,\n       2004, BP had an undivided 25% mineral interest, subject only to the non-\n       participating royalty interest; and (3) from August 16, 2004 forward, BP’s 25%\n       mineral interest passed to Hoskins, subject to BP’s retained royalty interest which\n       burdens Hoskins’ mineral interest and “does not burden any interests held by the\n       Defendants;”\n\n       4. Made the finding that “the Defendants as mineral owners or invitees of\n       mineral owners were not trespassers, or were alternatively ‘good faith\n       trespassers,’” as to Hoskins and BP after termination of the Leases and JOA;\n\n       5. Granted summary judgment “against all remaining claims and counterclaims\n       asserted by any party in this case;”\n\n       6.    Granted summary judgment “against all remaining affirmative defenses\n       asserted by any party to the extent those defenses would be inconsistent with the\n       Court’s rulings;”\n\n       7. Ordered the parties to work together to stipulate to “the revenues less costs\n       applicable to the Subject Acreage,” or a bench trial on “that remaining issue”\n       would be conducted; and\n\n       8. Noted the parties “dispute whether the issues of attorney’s fees and interest,\n       including such claims under the Texas Natural Resources Code, are still live\n       issues,” and stated the Court would determine those issues by further order or in\n       the final judgment, and that it had indicated it would “decline to award any\n       discretionary attorneys’ fees to any party in this case.”\n\n       The parties were unable to stipulate to the net revenues, so a bench trial was held on that\n\nissue. On September 11, 2009, the trial court signed its final judgment which incorporated its\n\n                                                -6-\n\f                                                                                                 04-09-00603-CV\n\n\ninterlocutory judgment “addressing the liability issues in this case,” and then awarded damages\n\nfor net revenues to Hoskins of $1,267,482, plus pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and\n\ndamages for net revenues and royalty revenues to BP of $3,252,827, plus pre-judgment and post-\n\njudgment interest. The court found the “underlying nature of Hoskins’ and BP’s suit was to\n\nobtain a determination of title,” and declined to award attorney’s fees to any party. The court\n\nmade an alternative finding, however, that each party had incurred reasonable attorney’s fees of\n\n$900,000 each. All parties appealed from the judgment. 8\n\n           In the main appeal, appellants Prize9 and the Rutherfords are aligned, 10 and appellees\n\nHoskins and BP are aligned. Each aligned party adopts the other party’s brief. In their appeal,\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords present the following arguments: (1) as a matter of law, the JOA did\n\nnot terminate and BP’s 25% mineral interest did not revert; (2) alternatively, the net revenues\n\ndamages awarded to Hoskins and BP should be reversed because there is no cause of action to\n\nsupport the damages award; (3) the royalties awarded to BP should be reversed because Prize’s\n\nand the Rutherfords’ interests are not burdened by BP’s royalty interest; (4) the pre-judgment\n\nand post-judgment interest awards to Hoskins and BP should be reversed; (5) the court should\n\nhave awarded Prize and the Rutherfords their attorney’s fees because they prevailed on their\n\nsummary judgment motions; (6) the court erred in imposing a future duty of accounting on Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords; and (7) as a conditional point in the event of a remand on BP’s contractual\n\nclaim for royalties, the affirmative defenses raised by Prize and the Rutherfords are still live.\n\nThe Rutherfords also raise two additional damages-related issues in the event this Court sustains\n\n8\n    Burlington Resources settled and is not involved in the appeal.\n9\n The “Prize” appellants/defendants are Prize Energy Resources, L.P., Prize Operating Company, Gruy Petroleum\nManagement Company n/k/a Cimarex Energy Co. of Colorado, Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc., Cimarex Energy\nCo., and Hunter Gas Gathering, Inc.\n10\n   In their appellants’ brief, the Rutherfords state they are fully aligned with Prize on all issues and adopt the\narguments presented in the Prize appellants’ brief.\n\n                                                           -7-\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nthe damages awards to Hoskins and BP: (1) the court erred in assessing damages against the\n\n“Rutherford Children” who own only leasehold interests and no mineral interests; and (2) the\n\ncourt erred in making the Rutherfords jointly and severally liable with Prize for the total\n\ndamages awarded to Hoskins and BP.\n\n                                        TITLE QUESTION\n\n        As noted, supra, the trial court granted declaratory relief to Hoskins and BP on the\n\nquestion of their title to the 25% unleased mineral interest. Specifically, the court held that, in\n\nAugust 2001, the El Paso and Baker Leases and the JOA terminated, and BP’s 25% mineral\n\ninterest reverted to it free and clear of the JOA; therefore, from August 2001 through August 15,\n\n2004, BP had clear fee simple title to its undivided 25% mineral interest. On August 16, 2004,\n\nHoskins acquired title to such 25% mineral interest from BP, subject only to BP’s retention of a\n\n6.25% nonparticipating royalty interest. In their appeal, Prize and the Rutherfords assert the\n\njudgment in favor of Hoskins and BP on their title claims should be reversed and rendered\n\nbecause, as a matter of law, the JOA never terminated; therefore, there was no reversion to BP of\n\nthe 25% mineral interest contributed to the JOA, and BP could not sell the 25% mineral interest\n\nto Hoskins. Thus, Hoskins owns no interest in the Baker Property. Under Prize’s and the\n\nRutherfords’ theory, BP still holds only the reversionary right to the 25% mineral interest plus\n\nthe right to receive royalties.\n\n        In support of their position, Prize and the Rutherfords make the following arguments: (1)\n\nas an initial matter, BP and Hoskins have no standing to assert that the JOA terminated because\n\nthey are not parties to the operating agreement; (2) the JOA never terminated because it was\n\ncontinued or revived by the Ratifications of the El Paso and Baker Leases signed by Burlington,\n\nthe Rutherfords, and the Bank; (3) the JOA never terminated because it was extended by the\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nconduct of the parties to the agreement, i.e., Prize and the Rutherfords continued to operate under\n\nthe JOA; and (4) even if the Leases and JOA terminated due to the cessation of\n\nproduction/operations, the “deemed lease” created by Article 3 of the JOA did not terminate\n\nbecause it contains no “cessation of production” clause.\n\n       In response, Hoskins and BP assert that the Baker and El Paso Leases terminated upon\n\nthe 71-day cessation of production in August 2001, and, according to its own terms, the JOA\n\nautomatically terminated at that time as well. Upon termination of the JOA in August 2001,\n\nBP’s 25% mineral interest contributed to the JOA was released from the “deemed lease,” and\n\nimmediately and automatically reverted to BP free and clear of the JOA. Thus, BP had clear title\n\nto its 25% mineral interest which it subsequently sold to Hoskins, retaining only a 6.25%\n\nnonparticipating royalty interest. In responding to the issues raised by Prize and the Rutherfords,\n\nHoskins and BP argue: (1) they have standing to assert the JOA terminated because its\n\ntermination directly affects their ownership interests; (2) Prize and the Rutherfords did not\n\nappeal the trial court’s finding that the Leases terminated in August 2001 due to the cessation of\n\noperations/production, and, based on that finding, the JOA automatically terminated in August\n\n2001 according to its own terms and the reversion to BP occurred; (3) the JOA was not\n\ncontinued, renewed, or revived by (i) the Ratifications signed in 2005 by the three lessors on the\n\nwritten Leases, (ii) the conduct of the operators in continuing to drill under the JOA after August\n\n2001, or (iii) the “deemed lease” provision of the JOA. As these issues are intertwined, we will\n\ndiscuss them together.\n\n       (1) Standing.      The threshold issue we must resolve is whether BP and Hoskins have\n\nstanding to sue to declare the JOA terminated and to clear their title to the 25% mineral interest\n\nwhich BP sold to Hoskins. As Hoskins’ ownership interest flows from, and is dependent on,\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nBP’s ownership interest, we will initially focus on BP. Resolution of the question of standing is\n\nintertwined with the title question of whether BP’s mineral interest reverted back to it in August\n\n2001 so that it could later be sold to Hoskins.\n\n       Standing is a component of subject matter jurisdiction and must be resolved first before\n\nthe merits of an issue may be addressed.

BP and Hoskins respond that they have standing because BP is the\n\nsuccessor to ARCO, an original signing party to the JOA, who retained a contractual interest in\n\nthe JOA after the 1986 sale because its unleased 25% mineral interest was “contractually\n\ncommitted” to the JOA under Article 3; therefore, the reversionary interest retained by\n\nARCO/BP was directly tied to, and wholly dependent on, the termination of the JOA, giving BP\n\nstanding to sue to declare the JOA terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  - 10 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n        First, it is undisputed that neither BP nor Hoskins is a signing party to the JOA. The JOA\n\nwas executed in 1967 by the P.R. Rutherford Group as the operator and lessee under the Baker\n\nand El Paso Leases, and by ARCO as the operator and a mineral owner contributing its unleased\n\n25% mineral interest to the Unit Area. ARCO retained a reversionary interest pursuant to which\n\nits 25% mineral interest would revert back to ARCO if the JOA ever terminated; in addition, it\n\ncontracted for a royalty interest under the JOA, although while it was the operator ARCO never\n\npaid itself any royalties. In 1986, when ARCO sold all of its rights and obligations under the\n\nJOA to Petrus (predecessor of Prize), ARCO retained its right of reverter to its 25% mineral\n\ninterest upon termination of the JOA and its royalty interest. Petrus/Prize succeeded to ARCO’s\n\n50% working interest and became co-operator along with the P.R. Rutherford Group from 1986\n\nforward. BP succeeded to the rights ARCO retained in the 1986 sale, i.e., the reversionary\n\ninterest and the royalty interest.\n\n        Prize and the Rutherfords assert that because ARCO sold all its rights under the JOA in\n\n1986, and BP succeeded only to the royalty and reversionary interests retained by ARCO, BP has\n\nno standing to challenge the JOA because it is not a party to the JOA, and is not a third party\n\nbeneficiary of the JOA; alternatively, at most, BP is only an incidental beneficiary who may not\n\nbring an action on the JOA. We agree that, under well-settled contract principles, only the\n\nparties to a contract have the right to complain of a breach of the contract, with the exception that\n\na nonparty who proves the contract was made for his benefit, and that the contracting parties\n\nintended he benefit from the contract, may bring an action on the contract as a third party\n\nbeneficiary.

This is a\n\nspecies of the same argument we rejected above. The argument ignores the fact that the mineral\n\ninterests immediately reverted to the lessors/owners upon the cessation of production, and\n\ntermination of the Leases and JOA, in August 2001. Even if Prize and the Rutherfords created\n\nan implied contract between themselves through their actions subsequent to August 2001, their\n\nactions could not recapture the mineral interests that immediately reverted upon termination of\n\nthe Leases and JOA. See Sigler Oil, 19 S.W.2d at 30; see also Marshall, 288 S.W.3d at 451.\n\n\n\n14\n     Article 3 applies to “any interest owned and contributed by a party hereto.” (emphasis added).\n\n                                                         - 17 -\n\f                                                                                  04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       In conclusion, according to the written documents’ unambiguous terms, the Leases\n\nautomatically terminated upon the more than sixty-day cessation of operations in August 2001,\n\ncausing the JOA to simultaneously terminate and BP’s 25% mineral interest contributed to the\n\nJOA to revert back to BP free and clear. Accordingly, we hold the trial court correctly resolved\n\nthe question of title, holding in relevant part that, “from August 2001 forward, the interests\n\nowned by Hoskins and BP in and to the Baker Ranch property . . . are as follows: (1) from\n\nAugust 2001 through August 15, 2004, BP had an undivided 25% mineral interest, subject only\n\nto a 1/64th non-participating royalty interest burden (herein the ‘BP 25% mineral interest’); and\n\n(2) from August 16, 2004 forward, the ‘BP 25% mineral interest’ passed to Hoskins, subject to\n\nBP retaining an undivided .06250 of 8/8ths royalty interest, which burdens the ‘BP 25% mineral\n\ninterest’ now owned by Hoskins.” Therefore, we overrule Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ Issue No.\n\n3 concerning title. Having resolved the issues of standing and title, we next address Hoskins’\n\nallegation of bad faith trespass against Prize and the Rutherfords.\n\n                                            TRESPASS\n\n       The parties contested whether Prize and the Rutherfords were bad faith trespassers\n\nbecause they continued to operate on the Baker Property after the cessation of operations in\n\nAugust 2001, and, in fact, drilled and completed Baker Well Nos. 7 through 13 after termination\n\nof the Leases and the JOA, and over BP’s protest. Hoskins, BP, and the Bank moved for\n\nsummary judgment declaring that the Leases and JOA terminated in August 2001 and to clear\n\ntitle to their respective interests. Prize moved for summary judgment, arguing: (1) that the JOA\n\nhad never terminated because of “production, extension, renewal, or otherwise;” (2) that Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords had the right to drill and operate on the Baker Property because they were\n\nco-tenants, or had the consent of a co-tenant; and (3) that Prize and the Rutherfords had\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f                                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nadversely possessed any interest allegedly reserved by BP or its predecessor. As we have\n\npreviously discussed, the trial court granted Hoskins’ and BP’s request for declaratory relief on\n\nthe title issues. As part of the declaratory relief granted on summary judgment, and re-stated in\n\nthe final judgment, the court made a finding that Prize and the Rutherfords “as mineral owners or\n\ninvitees of mineral owners were not trespassers, or alternatively, were ‘good faith trespassers,’\n\nimmediately after termination of the Leases and the 1967 JOA in August 2001 and at all times\n\nthereafter.” Furthermore, the court ordered that the plaintiffs “take nothing . . . on any trespass\n\nclaim in this cause.”\n\n           On cross-appeal, Hoskins and the Bank 15 assert the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment against them on their trespass claims because the record shows that Prize and the\n\nRutherfords committed bad faith trespass as a matter of law, and that all their affirmative\n\ndefenses fail. 16\n\n           (1) Standard of Review.

It is undisputed that, at all times relevant to this case, the\n\nRutherfords held a 25% mineral interest in the Baker Property, in addition to acting as one of the\n\noperators on the property. The Rutherfords, along with the Bank, were lessors under the Baker\n\nLease.    When that Lease terminated in August 2001 due to the lack of operations, the\n\nRutherfords’ mineral interest subject to the Lease reverted back to them.

Prize, the Rutherfords,\n\nHoskins, and BP all raise various challenges to the trial court’s award of damages to Hoskins and\n\nBP. We begin by addressing the arguments raised by Prize and the Rutherfords in the main\n\nappeal, then address the issues raised on cross-appeal by Hoskins and BP, and finally address the\n\nconditional issues raised separately by the Rutherfords.\n\nI.         Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ Challenges to Damages Award\n\n           As noted, the trial court awarded Hoskins $1,267,482 as its share of the net revenues\n\nfrom August 16, 2004 to October 31, 2008, and awarded BP $3,252,827 as its share of the net\n\nrevenues from August 1, 2001 to August 15, 2004 and its royalties from August 16, 2004 to\n\nOctober 31, 2008. 17           The trial court defined “net revenues” as the “gross revenues less\n\nreasonable and necessary expenses beneficial to the Subject Acreage and including the Baker\n\nWell Nos. 8, 11 and 13.” In addition, the court assessed pre-judgment and post-judgment\n\ninterest on both damages awards, and ordered that Prize and the Rutherfords are jointly and\n\nseverally liable for both damages awards.\n17\n     As noted, Hoskins’ acquisition of BP’s 25% mineral interest was made retroactive to August 16, 2004.\n\n                                                         - 23 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       In their appeal, Prize and the Rutherfords argue the damages awarded to Hoskins and BP\n\nmust be reversed, and a take-nothing judgment must be rendered, because (i) Hoskins and BP did\n\nnot recover under any legal theory that supports an award of damages, and (ii) all of the damages\n\nawarded to BP represent royalties, and Prize and the Rutherfords are not liable to BP for any\n\nroyalties after BP sold its mineral interest to Hoskins. In addition, Prize and the Rutherfords\n\ncomplain the final judgment improperly awards future relief.\n\n       (1) No Legal Theory to Support Damages.              In their Issue No. 1, Prize and the\n\nRutherfords assert that Hoskins and BP pled no theory of liability which supports the trial court’s\n\naward of damages consisting of net revenues and royalties. Prize and the Rutherfords argue that\n\nHoskins and BP are not entitled to an award of damages since they prevailed only on their claims\n\nfor declaratory relief. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.004(a) (West 2008). Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords rely on cases holding that a party cannot characterize a suit for money\n\ndamages, such as a contract dispute, as a declaratory judgment action in order to circumvent\n\nsovereign immunity or other restrictions. See, e.g., Seals v. City of Dallas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1448872\"><a href=\"/opinion/1448872/seals-v-city-of-dallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 757\n\n(Tex.

They then conclude, without additional authority or\n\nargument, that because Hoskins and BP were seeking a declaration of their legal rights and status\n\nwith respect to the Baker Property, they necessarily had no right to recover any monetary\n\ndamages.\n\n       Here, both Hoskins’ and BP’s live pleadings included, among others, a claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief and to quiet title to BP’s 25% mineral interest which was transferred to\n\nHoskins, and a claim to recover their share of unpaid production proceeds, plus interest, under\n\nsections 91.402-.404 of the Texas Natural Resources Code (“TNRC”).

In paragraph five, the court granted summary judgment against “all\n\nremaining claims and counterclaims asserted by any party in this case,” and against all remaining\n\naffirmative defenses asserted by any party. In paragraph seven, the court stated that counsel for\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords and counsel for Hoskins and BP were to “work together to attempt to\n\nstipulate to the revenues less costs applicable to the Subject Acreage,” and if unable to agree, a\n\nbench trial would be held “as to that remaining issue,” after which a final judgment would issue.\n\nThe trial court stated its intent to “issue any damage award on a ‘net’ basis (revenues less\n\nreasonable and necessary expenses),” but requested the parties provide information as to the\n\n“gross” basis for the record. Finally, in paragraph 8, the court noted that, “[t]he parties dispute\n\nwhether the issues of attorneys’ fees and interest, including such claims under the Texas Natural\n\nResources Code, are still live issues or have been previously dealt with on summary judgment,”\n\nand stated it would determine those issues in the final judgment. The court further stated, “In the\n\nevent that the Court rules that any of the subjects listed in this paragraph 8 are still live and\n\nundecided, then those undecided subjects are not covered by paragraph 5 [granting summary\n\njudgment against all remaining claims] of this order.” Reading the interlocutory judgment as a\n\nwhole, the court clearly intended that the issue of damages, and the calculation of the proper\n\namount of unpaid “revenues less costs,” was still a live issue to be determined by stipulation of\n\nthe parties or at a bench trial. If, as Prize and the Rutherfords contend, all claims for monetary\n\nrecovery had been denied by summary judgment, there would have been no need for the trial\n\ncourt to conduct a bench trial to determine the proper amount of damages to be awarded to\n\nHoskins and BP.\n\n\n\n                                               - 25 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       In its final judgment rendered after the bench trial on damages, the trial court made no\n\nexpress finding as to the legal theory under which it was awarding the “net revenues” damages to\n\nHoskins and BP (plus “royalty revenues”), but did explain its method of calculating the damages.\n\nThe court’s award of “net revenues” calculated as “gross revenues less reasonable and necessary\n\nexpenses beneficial to the Subject Acreage” conforms to the TNRC’s requirement that a payee is\n\nentitled to receive its share of the “proceeds derived from the sale of oil or gas from an oil or gas\n\nwell.” See TEX.

In Issue No. 2, Prize and the Rutherfords argue\n\nthey have no duty to pay the royalties awarded to BP; they contend it is Hoskins’ sole obligation\n\nto pay BP its royalties as part of the consideration for Hoskins’ purchase of BP’s 25% mineral\n\ninterest. As an initial matter, we note that Prize and the Rutherfords assert that the record\n\ncontains no evidence of any revenues from production from August 1, 2001 to August 15, 2004;\n\ntherefore, the full $3.2 million awarded to BP represents royalties due on production from\n\nAugust 16, 2004 to October 31, 2008 which should be paid by Hoskins. In support of their\n\ncontention that they are not responsible for paying BP its post-sale royalties, Prize and the\n\n\n\n                                              - 28 -\n\f                                                                                             04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nRutherfords point to the trial court’s statement in the final judgment that “BP’s royalty does not\n\nburden any interests held by the Defendants [Prize and the Rutherfords].” (emphasis added).\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords interpret that statement to mean they have no obligation as the\n\noperators to pay BP its royalties on production.             We find their argument to be somewhat\n\ndisingenuous. First, the court’s statement that BP’s royalty does not “burden any interests” held\n\nby Prize and the Rutherfords is part of the declaratory relief section of the judgment resolving the\n\nissues of title among the parties. In the previous sentence describing the interests held by BP, the\n\ncourt explains, “from August 16, 2004 forward, the ‘BP 25% mineral interest’ passed to Cliff\n\nHoskins, Inc., subject to BP retaining an undivided .06250 of 8/8ths royalty interest, which\n\nburdens the ‘BP 25% mineral interest’ now owned by Cliff Hoskins, Inc.” The court was simply\n\nclarifying that BP’s retained .06250 of 8/8ths royalty interest is attached to, and thus “burdens,”\n\nthe 25% mineral interest now owned by Hoskins. 18 See Clear Lake Pines, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1583506</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n*3 (an encumbrance is an interest in realty that is a burden on its transfer, and the right to future\n\nroyalty payments on oil and gas production is an interest in realty) (citing City of Dayton v.\n\nAllred, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3982323\"><a href=\"/opinion/4209999/city-of-dayton-v-allred/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3982323\"><a href=\"/opinion/4209999/city-of-dayton-v-allred/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 178 (1934), and Clyde v.

The court was not stating that Prize and the Rutherfords have no duty to pay the\n\nroyalties owed to BP.\n\n        Second, as the entities operating on and producing oil and/or gas from the Baker\n\nProperty, Prize and the Rutherfords, and their successor operators, constitute “payors” under the\n\nTNRC, and as such are responsible for distributing the oil and gas proceeds to the “payees,”\n\ndefined as “persons legally entitled to payment from the proceeds derived from the sale of oil or\n\ngas,” which includes royalty interest owners. TEX. NAT. RES. CODE ANN. § 91.401(1), (2)\n\n\n18\n  In the final judgment, the court also noted that the “BP 25% mineral interest” now owned by Hoskins is still\nsubject to the pre-existing 1/64th non-participating royalty originally owned by ARCO.\n\n                                                    - 29 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n(defining a “payor” as “the party who undertakes to distribute oil and gas proceeds to the payee,\n\nwhether as the purchaser of the production of oil or gas . . . or as operator of the well from which\n\nsuch production was obtained or as lessee under the lease on which royalty is due.”); see\n\nConcord Oil, 966 S.W.2d at 461. Thus, part of Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ obligation as\n\noperators on the Baker Property is to pay the royalty owners their royalties on production. TEX.\n\nNAT. RES. CODE ANN. § 91.402(a). The fact that the trial court ordered Prize and the Rutherfords\n\nto pay the $3.2 million in royalties directly to BP as the royalty owner, rather than to Hoskins as\n\nthe mineral interest owner, does not constitute an abuse of discretion; in fact, it is consistent with\n\nthe TNRC. Accordingly, we overrule this issue.\n\n       (3) Future Relief. In Issue No. 7, Prize and the Rutherfords generally complain that the\n\nlast substantive paragraph of the final judgment contains improper provisions addressing “future\n\nrelief that is not pleaded, is advisory and is unwarranted.” Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure\n\n38.1 requires an appellant’s brief to “contain a clear and concise argument for the contention\n\nmade, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record.” TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords have waived their future relief argument because their briefs fail to make a\n\nclear and concise argument, and, with one exception, lack citations to supporting legal authority.\n\nThe failure by Prize and the Rutherfords to provide a clear argument or supporting authority\n\nwaives the claimed error.

Moreover, one of the provisions criticized by Prize and the Rutherfords as\n\nbinding “people who are not parties to [the judgment], such as unnamed ‘first purchasers’ or\n\nfuture operators of the property,” is consistent with the TNRC definition of a “payor” under\n\nsection 91.401(2). Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ seventh issue is therefore overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 30 -\n\f                                                                                         04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nII. Hoskins’ Challenges to Damages Award\n\n           In its third issue on cross-appeal, Hoskins 19 asserts the trial court erred in rejecting his\n\nproposed well by well method of calculating damages, and instead calculating the damages by\n\n“lumping all revenue and expenses together for the seven Baker wells drilled post-termination,\n\nrather than excluding costs for the three admittedly unprofitable wells.” Hoskins also challenges\n\nthe court’s inclusion of the COPAS overhead costs.\n\n           (1) Well by Well Method. Hoskins contends the court should have calculated the “net\n\nrevenues” payable to Hoskins and BP on the “well by well” basis presented by its expert.\n\nHoskins argues it should have been awarded $4,508,836 in net revenues (which excludes costs of\n\nthe three unprofitable wells), rather than the $1,267,482 net revenues actually awarded (which\n\nincludes deduction of costs of all seven wells).\n\n           The trial court expressly rejected the “well by well” method in its final judgment, stating\n\n“the Court FINDS that Hoskins’ and BP’s argument for damages based on a well-by-well basis\n\nis not meritorious, and the Court rejects that argument.” The court then proceeded to make\n\nadditional findings that: (i) there is no applicable limitation to Defendants’ obligation to account\n\nto Hoskins and BP, and therefore no time bar to any of their claims; and (ii) the COPAS\n\nproduction overhead should be allowed as reasonable and necessary costs. In awarding Hoskins\n\nunpaid “net revenues,” the judgment states the amounts represent “net revenues (i.e., gross\n\nrevenues less reasonable and necessary expenses beneficial to the Subject Acreage and including\n\nBaker Well Nos. 8, 11 and 13) . . . .” Baker Well Nos. 8, 11 and 13 are the unprofitable Baker\n\nwells.\n\n           To support its well by well approach, Hoskins relies on the court of appeals opinion in\n\nWagner & Brown, Ltd. v.

Wagner & Brown, 282\n\nS.W.3d at 421. Specifically, the case involved an operator seeking to recover reimbursement for\n\na mineral interest owner/unleased co-tenant’s share of costs for drilling a gas well before and\n\nafter the lease on the land had mistakenly expired due to failure to pay the owner’s royalties\n\nwithin 120 days of the first gas sales. Id. at 421-22. In reversing the Texarkana court, the\n\nSupreme Court held in relevant part that: (i) termination of the lease did not terminate the\n\nowner’s participation in the pooling unit because mineral owners can agree to pool their lands\n\neven if no lease exists; and (ii) an operator who drills a well in good faith is entitled to equitable\n\nreimbursement of costs, even if the operator’s lease is not valid, as long as the operator believed\n\nin good faith the lease was valid. Id. at 422-23, 426-27. Finally, the Supreme Court confirmed\n\nthe long-standing rule in Texas that “a cotenant has the right to extract minerals from common\n\nproperty without first obtaining the consent of his cotenants; however, he must account to them\n\non the basis of the value of any minerals taken, less the necessary and reasonable costs of\n\nproduction and marketing.” Id. at 426 (citing Byrom, 717 S.W.2d at 605). As to the reason\n\nHoskins relies on the Texarkana opinion, its deduction of expenses on a well by well basis, the\n\nSupreme Court expressly noted that it would not reach that issue because it was not raised on\n\nreview. See id. at 425 n.24 (noting the court of appeals “held that the defendants could not\n\ndeduct expenses incurred on the first well 20 from the revenues for the second well,” but\n\ndefendants did not appeal that conclusion).\n\n\n20\n   Evidence before the Texarkana Court of Appeals concerning the first well established that the reworking costs\ntotaled $592,000, but generated only $10,000 in revenue over a two-year period. Wagner & Brown, 198 S.W.3d at\n\n                                                     - 32 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n           To further support its well by well approach, Hoskins asserts the evidence is\n\n“uncontroverted” that the Baker Well Nos. 8, 11, and 13 were unprofitable, and thus did not\n\nbenefit the co-tenancy. Hoskins contends that failure to calculate damages on a well by well\n\nbasis, in the absence of a joint operating agreement stating otherwise, is contrary to well-\n\nestablished Texas law because a co-tenant is not entitled to reimbursement for unsuccessful\n\noperations.

See Wagner & Brown, 198 S.W.3d at 380-81. They further argue that\n\nbased on the Supreme Court’s holdings and tenor in its opinion, the Court would have overruled\n\na well by well approach had that issue been appealed. See Wagner & Brown, 282 S.W.3d at 425-\n\n27. We agree with Prize and the Rutherfords.\n\n           We have found no case other than the Texarkana opinion which applies a strict well by\n\nwell analysis to a co-tenant’s reimbursement claim. See Wagner & Brown, 198 S.W.3d at 380-\n\n81. We note, however, that as a general rule oil and gas wells are characterized as improvements\n\nto real property; as such, equitable principles apply and dictate that a person who “in good faith\n\nmakes improvements upon property owned by another is entitled to compensation therefore.”\n\nWagner & Brown, 282 S.W.3d at 425-26. Furthermore, “[i]t has long been the rule in Texas that\n\n381 n.7.\n\n                                               - 33 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\na cotenant has the right to extract minerals from common property without first obtaining the\n\nconsent of his cotenants; however, he must account to them on the basis of the value of any\n\nminerals taken, less the necessary and reasonable costs of production and marketing.” Id. at\n\n426 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court in reversing the court of appeals, although not\n\naddressing the well by well analysis, clearly stressed the equitable nature of a reimbursement-\n\nfor-improvements claim. Id. at 428. The Court stated,\n\n       Given the equitable nature of a reimbursement-for-improvements claim, we\n       decline to read Texas law as establishing that drilling costs are always or never\n       recoverable when a lease expires. Instead, we believe the equitable nature of such\n       claims must turn on the equities in each case. . . . As with other equitable actions,\n       a jury may have to settle disputed issues about what happened, but ‘the\n       expediency, necessity, or propriety of equitable relief’ is for the trial court, and its\n       ruling is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n\nId. at 428-29 (emphasis in original).\n\n       Applying the above principles to the facts in Wagner & Brown, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat the trial court and court of appeals abused their discretion in declaring costs unrecoverable,\n\nbecause there was evidence that those costs benefitted the estate. Id. at 429. The Supreme Court\n\nrelied on fairness considerations, as well as past and potential future benefits to the estate from\n\nfuture wells that may be drilled, when ruling the trial court abused its discretion in refusing\n\nreimbursement of drilling costs. Id. at 424-25, 428-29. Applying the reasoning found in the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Wagner & Brown, we decline to apply a strict well by well\n\napproach to the costs at issue in this case, and instead will review the trial court’s determination\n\nof the equities from the evidence presented under an abuse of discretion standard.\n\n       Turning to the evidence, Hoskins discounts the argument by Prize and the Rutherfords\n\nthat the unprofitable Baker wells nonetheless benefitted the co-tenancy by (i) preventing\n\ndrainage from nearby development, (ii) providing beneficial geological “wellbore” information,\n\n\n\n                                                - 34 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nand (iii) permitting re-entry of the unplugged wells in the future. The record confirms that\n\nPrize’s expert, Don Ray George, testified extensively that the expenses from Baker Well Nos. 8,\n\n11, and 13 were reasonable and necessary and benefitted the estate.           Specifically, George\n\ntestified that Well Nos. 8, 11, and 13 were drilled in “good faith to offset and develop the\n\nreservoirs.” He testified the operator and the other mineral interest owners gained a myriad of\n\nvaluable information “beneficial to the overall development of the minerals underlying the Earl\n\nBaker Estate” from the drilling of these wells. George opined, “[I]t’s a continuing benefit to be\n\nable to not only tell what the geology looks like, but the extent of reservoirs, the quantity of the\n\nhydrocarbons that’s there, whether or not there’s an active water drive or what type of reservoir\n\nmechanism each of those individual reservoirs is producing under.” George further testified that\n\nWell Nos. 8 and 11 were not plugged (Well No. 13 is still producing) and could be re-entered in\n\nthe future if and when economics improve. Hoskins’ expert, Peter Huddleston, offered no\n\ntestimony to controvert George’s testimony that Well Nos. 8, 11, and 13 did benefit the estate or\n\nthat the expenses from the three wells were unnecessary or unreasonable. Hoskins does point to\n\nthe testimony of several fact witnesses and argues that this testimony contradicts any possible\n\nbenefit to the estate (i.e., the wells did not prevent drainage, may never be re-entered for future\n\noperations, and only “potentially” provided useful geological benefits.). Resolution of any\n\nconflicts in the evidence was within the court’s province as the finder of fact. See City of Keller,\n\n168 S.W.3d at 819 (it is the sole province of fact finder to determine credibility of the witnesses\n\nand weight to be given their testimony).\n\n       Hoskins also complains that all of the costs of the non-producing wells were incurred\n\nafter BP’s June 25, 2004 letter concerning termination of the JOA, and after suit was filed. As\n\nnoted earlier, however, the long standing rule is that a co-tenant has the right to extract minerals\n\n\n\n                                               - 35 -\n\f                                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nfrom the common estate without the consent of his cotenants. 21 Wagner & Brown, 282 S.W.3d\n\nat 426. George’s testimony and the record indicate that the expenses from Well Nos. 8, 11, and\n\n13 should be included in any net revenues calculation because Hoskins also sought and obtained\n\nan interest in those wells through its title claims in this suit.\n\n         (2) COPAS Overhead. Hoskins further claims the COPAS 22 overhead costs permitted\n\nby the trial court should have been excluded, thereby increasing Hoskins’ damages by $81,085.\n\nAs with the well by well determination, it is for the fact finder to determine whether an overhead\n\ncharge is properly deductible as a reasonable and necessary expense. Id. at 425 (overhead\n\nexpenses on a lapsed lease were properly charged as long as they were reasonable and\n\nnecessary). George testified that the COPAS overhead charge was reasonable and necessary and\n\nstandard in the industry. He also testified that the co-tenants benefitted from the services\n\nassociated with these charges. Hoskins’ expert did not dispute this testimony, stating that he\n\nmade no determination as to the reasonableness or necessity of the charges.\n\n         In summary, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting a well by well\n\napproach to calculate Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ reimbursement-for-improvements claim and\n\nin awarding Hoskins unpaid “net revenues” calculated as “gross revenues less reasonable and\n\nnecessary expenses beneficial to the Subject Acreage and including Baker Well Nos. 8, 11 and\n\n13.” Furthermore, there is ample evidence supporting the trial court’s implied finding that the\n\ncosts associated with Well Nos. 8, 11, and 13 and the COPAS overhead were reasonable,\n\n\n\n21\n  The trial court’s final judgment recognized that because the El Paso and Baker Leases terminated by their terms in\nAugust 2001, “Hoskins’s and BP’s mineral rights and interests therefore reverted to them at that time, free and clear\nfrom the 1967 JOA and anyone claiming thereunder, making Hoskins and BP co-tenants.”\n22\n   As defined by Hoskins, “COPAS” overhead is a “fixed amount of overhead paid to the operator for their\nsupervision of operations” according to the terms of the operating agreement. Hoskins concedes that Article 8 of the\nJOA called for payment of COPAS overhead to the operator, Prize and the Rutherfords, but argues the JOA had\nterminated and the defendants did not prove the COPAS was a reasonable and necessary expense.\n\n                                                       - 36 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nnecessary, and beneficial to the estate. We therefore overrule Hoskins’ third issue on cross-\n\nappeal.\n\nIII. BP’s Challenge to Damages Award\n          In its third issue on cross-appeal, BP complains the trial court erred in permitting Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords to satisfy their obligation to account to BP for its share of net revenues by\n\ntendering to BP its applicable share of gas in-kind at the wellhead in lieu of payment of its share\n\nof proceeds from the sale of production. The trial court ordered in the last substantive paragraph\n\nof the judgment that, “any party who is a producing co-tenant of oil, gas and/or condensate from\n\nthe Subject Acreage shall account to the non-producing parties.” Specifically, the court ordered\n\nthat Prize and the Rutherfords, “for so long as they remain as producing co-tenants, shall have\n\nthe continuing obligation to account to Hoskins and BP for their respective shares of net\n\nrevenues attributable to the Subject Acreage.” The trial court further provided:\n\n          As to any revenues which have not previously been distributed by the Defendants,\n          BP and Hoskins shall be entitled to receive their respective shares of production\n          revenues directly from the first purchaser of such production and the operators\n          shall take such actions as are necessary to cause such direct payment.\n          Defendants, at their option, may also satisfy their obligations under this paragraph\n          by tendering Hoskins and BP their applicable share of gas in kind at the wellhead\n          in lieu of payment.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          BP argues the trial court’s judgment should be modified to remove the take-in-kind\n\noption because no legal authority exists allowing the producing co-tenant to force the non-\n\nproducing co-tenant to take a share of gas at the wellhead instead of receiving its share of net\n\nproduction proceeds after the gas is treated and marketed. In response, Prize and the Rutherfords\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 37 -\n\f                                                                                                 04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nargue the trial court acted within its discretion in allowing them to tender gas in-kind at the\n\nwellhead. 23 We disagree.\n\n        Allowing a co-tenant to tender gas in-kind at the wellhead is inconsistent with Texas co-\n\ntenancy law which provides that “a cotenant who produces minerals from common property\n\nwithout having secured the consent of his cotenants is accountable to them on the basis of the\n\nvalue of the mineral taken less the necessary and reasonable cost of producing and marketing the\n\nsame.” Cox, 397 S.W.2d at 201. Prize and the Rutherfords cite us to no authority showing that a\n\nproducing co-tenant can comply with its duty to account to a nonproducing co-tenant by\n\ntendering the applicable share of gas “in kind” at the wellhead. A trial court abuses its discretion\n\nif it acts without regard for any guiding rules or principles. City of Brownsville v. Alvarado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2435512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2435512/city-of-brownsville-v-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 754 (Tex. 1995). Accordingly, we grant BP’s third issue on cross-appeal and\n\nmodify the trial court’s judgment to remove the last sentence of the last substantive paragraph of\n\nthe final judgment, quoted above, which permitted Prize and the Rutherfords to satisfy their\n\nobligations to account to Hoskins and BP by tendering “their applicable share of gas in kind at\n\nthe wellhead in lieu of payment.”\n\nIV. The Rutherfords’ Challenge to Damages Award\n\n        Because we have sustained the damages award to Hoskins and BP, we must address the\n\nissues raised by the Rutherfords with respect to damages. The Rutherfords assert in two issues\n\nthat all of the Rutherford Children 24 are not liable for damages because they did not own any fee\n\n\n23\n   Prize and the Rutherfords also argue that because BP, not Hoskins, appealed this portion of the judgment, this\nissue must be rejected since BP’s royalty interest burdens only Hoskins’ interest. Therefore, Prize and the\nRutherfords contend BP is not entitled to any revenues or any gas from them, and must look only to Hoskins for\npayment of its royalty. For the reasons stated supra, we have rejected the argument that Prize and the Rutherfords\nhave no obligation to pay BP its royalties. See TEX. NAT. RES. CODE ANN. §§ 91.401, 91.402.\n24\n  The “Rutherford Children” consist of eight individuals: Stevan D. Rutherford, Patrick R. Rutherford, III, David\nTraylor Rutherford, John Richard Rutherford, Mary Elizabeth Rutherford, Paul Maroney Rutherford, Michael G.\nRutherford, Jr., and Sally Ann Rutherford.\n\n                                                      - 38 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00603-CV\n\n\ninterests in the mineral estate, but rather owned only leasehold working interests. They further\n\nargue the trial court improperly imposed joint and several liability against all defendants under\n\nthe judgment because there was no claim upon which a finding of joint and several liability could\n\nbe made.\n\n       (1) Rutherford Children. A trial court may not grant relief on a theory of recovery not\n\nsufficiently stated in the party’s live pleadings or tried by consent. See TEX. R. CIV.

A party’s\n\nunpleaded issue may be deemed tried by consent when evidence on the issue is developed under\n\ncircumstances indicating both parties understood the issue was in the case, and the other party\n\nfailed to make an appropriate complaint.

App.—Dallas 2004, no pet.).\n\n       As we have previously held, the court’s damages award to BP and Hoskins was made\n\npursuant to the TNRC. In its last amended petition regarding its claim under the TNRC, BP did\n\nnot include the Rutherford Children, but sought to recover its share of production revenues\n\n“jointly and severally” only from “Prize Energy, Prize Operating, Gruy, Rutherford Oil and/or\n\n\n\n                                               - 39 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nHunter Gathering” as “payors” under the TNRC. Similarly, Hoskins affirmatively states that the\n\n“only” cause of action it asserts against the Rutherford Children is its suit to remove the cloud on\n\nHoskins’ title to an undivided 25% mineral interest in the Subject Acreage. In addition, the\n\nrecord does not reflect that the issue of the Rutherford Children’s liability for any damages was\n\nactually tried by consent. Accordingly, the Rutherford Children’s issue is sustained, and the\n\njudgment will be modified to reflect that the damages award is not assessed against the\n\nRutherford Children.\n\n       (2) Joint and Several Liability Against All Defendants. The Rutherfords also argue\n\nthe trial court improperly imposed joint and several liability against all the defendants. BP and\n\nHoskins respond that the trial court expressly found that “all defendants” committed a good faith\n\ntrespass, and, under Texas law, each trespasser may be held jointly liable for the whole amount\n\nof the damages. First, we disagree with BP’s and Hoskins’ characterization of the trial court’s\n\njudgment. In its interlocutory judgment, the trial court’s very first ruling stated:\n\n       The court GRANTS Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment [defining the\n       defendants to include the Rutherford Children] on all Plaintiffs’ claims of\n       trespass. Plaintiffs shall take nothing from Defendants on any trespass claim in\n       this cause. (emphasis added).\n\nThe trial court again in its final judgment repeated that it was granting the defendants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment on all claims of trespass and further “ORDER[ED] that Hoskins, BP and\n\nBank of America, N.A., as Trustee of the Baker Trusts take nothing on their trespass claims. . . .”\n\n       Second, while we have upheld the award of damages under Chapter 91 of the TNRC, the\n\nstatute does not address joint and several liability among payors. By analogy, co-tenancy law is\n\nclear that the obligations of co-tenants are based on their proportional share. As the Supreme\n\nCourt has noted, when dealing with obligations of co-tenants, “the rule of accountability is the\n\nproportionate market value of the product less the proportionate necessary and reasonable costs\n\n                                                - 40 -\n\f                                                                                                  04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nof producing and marketing.” Cox, 397 S.W.2d at 203. Here, during the time period from\n\nAugust 2001 to October 2008, the period for which damages were awarded against Prize and the\n\nRutherfords, all the parties were in a co-tenancy relationship. Since a recovery against co-\n\ntenants is not generally imposed as a joint and several liability, we see no reason why a recovery\n\nof unpaid oil and gas proceeds against co-tenants under the TNRC would be treated any\n\ndifferently. Accordingly, we sustain the Rutherfords’ issue, and will modify the judgment to\n\ndelete the imposition of joint and several liability among all the defendants.\n\n                                      ATTORNEYS’ FEES & INTEREST\n\n        We next address the parties’ arguments concerning recovery of attorneys’ fees and\n\ninterest.   The trial court did not award attorneys’ fees to any party because it found the\n\nunderlying nature of the case was a determination of title; the court made an alternative finding\n\nthat reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees were $900,000 for each group of parties. In\n\nawarding damages to Hoskins and BP, the court also awarded pre-judgment interest at 5% per\n\nannum simple interest from December 22, 2004 until the day before the date of the final\n\njudgment, and post-judgment interest at 5% per annum, compounded annually.\n\n        On appeal, Prize and the Rutherfords assert they are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees\n\nbecause they prevailed on summary judgment against the theft claims brought by Hoskins, BP,\n\nand the Bank; they also assert the court’s award of pre-judgment and post-judgment interest\n\nshould be reversed. Hoskins and BP argue they should have been awarded attorneys’ fees\n\nbecause they prevailed in obtaining their share of revenues under the TNRC. 25\n\n\n\n\n25\n  The Bank’s challenge to the trial court’s assessment of Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ costs is separately addressed\nunder the Bank’s cross-appeal.\n\n                                                       - 41 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nI. Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ Issues\n\n       (1) Recovery of Attorneys’ Fees Under Texas Theft Liability Act. In Issue No. 5 of\n\nthe main appeal, Prize and the Rutherfords argue they should each have recovered $900,000 in\n\nattorneys’ fees because they prevailed on summary judgment against the civil theft claims\n\nbrought by Hoskins, BP, and the Bank under the Texas Theft Liability Act. See TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n\n& REM. CODE ANN. §§ 134.001-.005 (West 2005). Prize and the Rutherfords contend the award\n\nof their attorneys’ fees was mandatory under the statute because they successfully defended\n\nagainst the plaintiffs’ civil theft claims. See id. § 134.005(b) (providing “[e]ach person who\n\nprevails in a suit under this chapter shall be awarded court costs and reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney’s fees”); see also Air Routing Int’l Corp.

We agree. The record is clear\n\nthat a legitimate question concerning title to the 25% unleased mineral interest originally owned\n\nby ARCO, to which BP succeeded and sold to Hoskins, was the underlying basis for this case,\n\nand that the title dispute affected the rights of Hoskins and BP to receive payments under section\n\n91.402(a). Therefore, prejudgment interest was not recoverable under the plain language of\n\nsection 91.402(b)(1). Concord Oil, 966 S.W.2d at 461. Finally, the award of pre-judgment\n\ninterest may not be sustained under equity, or common law, as argued by Hoskins and BP,\n\nbecause the Supreme Court has stated that the statute controls. Id. at 462-63 (holding that, when\n\nthere is a title dispute affecting distributions of oil and gas proceeds, equitable prejudgment\n\ninterest may not be awarded under common law because it would be in direct conflict with\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 44 -\n\f                                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nsection 91.402(b) of the TNRC). 27 Accordingly, we sustain Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ issue\n\nchallenging the award of pre-judgment interest, 28 and will modify the judgment to delete the\n\naward of pre-judgment interest.\n\nII. Hoskins’ and BP’s Issue\n\n         On cross-appeal, Hoskins and BP assert in their third and first issues, respectively, that\n\nthey are entitled to receive their attorneys’ fees because they obtained relief under the TNRC.\n\nWe agree. We have held, supra, that the court’s award of net revenues and royalties to Hoskins\n\nand BP was made pursuant to section 91.402(a) of the TNRC. Section 91.406 provides that, “if a\n\nsuit is filed to collect proceeds and interest under this subchapter, the court shall include in any\n\nfinal judgment in favor of the plaintiff an award of: (1) reasonable attorney’s fees . . . .” TEX.\n\nNAT. RES. CODE ANN. § 91.406 (West 2001). Both Hoskins and BP brought claims to recover\n\ntheir unpaid share of the oil and gas proceeds, plus interest, under sections 91.402 and 91.403 of\n\nthe TNRC, and they received a favorable judgment on those claims in the trial court; in addition,\n\nthey expressly requested recovery of their attorneys’ fees under the TNRC. Id. §§ 91.402,\n\n91.403. Since we are affirming the trial court’s award of damages to Hoskins and BP on the\n\nbasis of their TNRC claims, BP and Hoskins have obtained a “favorable” result under the plain\n\nlanguage of section 91.406. See Headington, 287 S.W.3d at 215-16 (noting that a judgment is\n\n“favorable” to the plaintiff when he obtains “a measure of relief which leaves him in a better\n\nposition that he held before filing suit,” and upholding award of attorneys’ fees under section\n\n91.406 to plaintiff who was awarded unpaid royalties).\n\n\n27\n  Hoskins and BP rely on our prior opinion in Marshall as support for the award of pre-judgment interest.\nHowever, Marshall is distinguishable because the pre-judgment interest was awarded on fraud claims, not under the\nTNRC. Marshall, 288 S.W.3d at 455.\n28\n  To the extent Prize and the Rutherfords challenge the award of post-judgment interest on the damages, they make\nno clear argument explaining the legal basis for their challenge and cite no legal authority. Therefore, the issue is\nwaived. TEX. R. APP.

Since the\n\nlegislature excluded pre-judgment interest from a potential recovery in section 91.402(b)’s “safe\n\nharbor” provision, the legislature clearly also could have excluded attorney’s fees from a\n\npotential recovery if that was its intent; the legislature chose not to do so.

First, we have already rejected the\n\nargument that the TNRC is merely a prompt payment statute devoid of a cause of action for\n\nnonpayment of oil and gas proceeds, and have upheld the damages awards under the TNRC\n\nclaims. Second, our review of the record confirms that the trial court’s finding that the allocation\n\nof a majority (95%) of the attorneys’ work to the TNRC claims was not unreasonable; further,\n\nthe fee amount of $900,000 is a reasonable and necessary amount supported by the record.\n\n           The record shows that BP and Hoskins sufficiently proved up their attorneys’ fees at trial,\n\nwith attorney Thomas Zabel 29 testifying as to segregation among claims as well as the amount of\n\nfees incurred. Specifically, Zabel testified that, with the exception of the alternative breach of\n\ncontract claim brought by BP, all the claims asserted by BP and Hoskins depended on the same\n\nset of facts (i.e., that the JOA had terminated in August 2001), and that resolution of the\n\ndeclaratory judgment claim clearing title was beneficial to, and a necessary pre-requisite to, the\n\nright as payees to recover production proceeds under the TNRC claims. Zabel stated, “there was\n\nminimal time that can be segregated out that was unique to [claims for which no attorneys’ fees\n\nare provided . . . cloud on title, . . . trespass, conversion], but prosecuting those claims further, it\n\nbe[ne]fitted the natural resources claims, the theft act claims, the breach of contract claims, the\n\ndeclaratory judgment claims, that all have attorneys fees that are provided for.” Zabel also\n\ntestified the issues in the case were relatively complex and required sophisticated oil and gas\n\nattorneys, there were multiple hearings, and that efforts had to be devoted to defeating the\n29\n     Attorney Thomas Zabel was designated as the attorneys’ fees expert for Hoskins as well as BP.\n\n                                                         - 47 -\n\f                                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nnumerous defenses and counterclaims asserted by Prize and the Rutherfords in order to prevail\n\non the TNRC claims. Zabel stated that attorneys’ fees of $900,000 each would be reasonable,\n\neven though more fees were incurred, based on an allocation of approximately 5% for work\n\nunique to claims for which attorneys’ fees are not recoverable and 95% for work benefitting the\n\nTNRC claims. Prize and the Rutherfords offered no contradictory evidence.\n\n         The trial court did not abuse its discretion in accepting the segregation of 5% of the\n\nattorneys’ work as unique to non-fee claims and 95% to the TNRC claims. See Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P. v.

Further, the reasonableness of the\n\nallocation and $900,000 amount of fees is supported by sufficient evidence in the record. Id. at\n\n313-14 (segregation of attorney’s fees among multiple claims is a mixed question of law and\n\nfact).\n\n         Accordingly, we hold that Hoskins and BP 30 are both entitled to recover attorneys’ fees\n\nunder section 91.406 of the TNRC, and that the trial court’s (alternative) finding that $900,000 is\n\nthe amount of reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees incurred by Hoskins and BP on their\n\nTNRC claims is supported by the record and is not an abuse of discretion.

Specifically, Hoskins asserts: (1)\n\nthere was no pleading to support a monetary sanctions award; (2) defendants offered no\n\ncompetent evidence of monetary harm suffered as a result of the alleged discovery abuse; (3)\n\nthere was no direct relationship between the discovery abuse and the sanction imposed; and (4)\n\nthe award was unreasonable, excessive, unrelated to the alleged discovery abuse, and constitutes\n\nan impermissible penalty.\n\n       (1) Factual Background. Prize and the Rutherfords filed a motion for sanctions against\n\nHoskins and Leitch alleging that Leitch, counsel for Hoskins and the Baker Trusts, committed\n\nserious misconduct, including witness tampering and obtaining documents under false pretenses.\n\nThe motion further alleged that Leitch’s actions were known to and approved, at least in part, by\n\nhis clients. Prize and the Rutherfords requested that the trial court strike the pleadings of\n\nHoskins and the Baker Trusts.\n\n       At the sanctions hearing, Prize and the Rutherfords offered 39 exhibits to support their\n\nclaim of misconduct by Leitch. Without identifying himself as an attorney, Leitch wrote to\n\npotential witnesses and obtained documents for use in the case. Leitch used false letterhead in\n\nwhich he claimed to be a businessman for “Oil and Gas Properties” or “Mi Oil.” Katy Brymer,\n\nan assistant to a Prize contract pumper, testified by deposition that Leitch contacted her and told\n\nher that he worked for an oil company and asked to meet with her to discuss a job opportunity.\n\nLeitch set up a meeting with Brymer, and at the meeting falsely told her he was investigating\n\ncriminal conduct by Prize; he then offered to pay her in exchange for her assistance in the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 49 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nLeitch also went to Brymer’s house when she was not home and tried to crawl through her fence.\n\nBrymer was upset when she learned that Leitch had misrepresented himself to her.\n\n       Rick Rudolph, president of South Texas Gas Services, a nonparty to this appeal, testified\n\nby deposition that he met with Leitch and Cliff Hoskins. At the meeting, in the presence of\n\nHoskins, Leitch told Rudolph, who performed the gas-chart integrations, that if he would provide\n\nassistance to them in this case, they could “swing some business” his way. Rudolph stated that\n\nLeitch continually badgered him to produce documents that had already been provided, and also\n\nthreatened him and South Texas Gas with criminal penalties for spoliation of evidence. Due to\n\nthis harassment, Rudolph hired Thompson & Knight to represent him and South Texas Gas in\n\nthis matter. Leitch was then notified by Thompson & Knight that Rudolph and South Texas Gas\n\nwere represented and that all communications should be directed to counsel.\n\n       Despite this warning, Leitch hired a local attorney, John Miller, to visit the Rudolphs at\n\ntheir business in Sinton, Texas. Thompson & Knight was not informed that this contact would\n\ntake place. Leitch told Miller that Rudolph was not represented by counsel. Miller informed the\n\nRudolphs that it would be in their best interest to obtain counsel and that Hoskins would pay for\n\na lawyer. Rudolph also remembered Miller saying that if they agreed to allow Leitch to pay for\n\ntheir legal representation, Leitch would keep them from being held liable to the other plaintiffs.\n\nAt Leitch’s direction, Miller spoke to Rudolph about giving a deposition in the case. Miller was\n\nsurprised to learn that the Rudolphs did in fact have retained counsel.\n\n       At his deposition on August 12, 2005, Cliff Hoskins admitted that he was aware of some\n\nof Leitch’s misconduct. Hoskins acknowledged that he authorized the letters sent to nonparties\n\non false letterhead as part of the investigation Leitch was conducting. Additionally, Hoskins\n\nattended the deposition of Katy Brymer on May 17, 2006, and at that time became aware of\n\n\n\n                                               - 50 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nLeitch’s improper conduct as to Brymer. Additionally, Hoskins verified interrogatory answers\n\nwhich sought information about Leitch’s misconduct. Hoskins’ co-counsel, Timothy Robinson,\n\nwas also copied on Prize’s counsel’s communications complaining of Leitch’s improper conduct\n\nwhich were sent to all counsel of record from November 2005 through June 2006, thereby\n\nputting Hoskins on notice of Leitch’s misconduct. Despite this knowledge, Hoskins continued to\n\nretain Leitch.\n\n        Following the presentation of this evidence, the trial court ordered that Leitch be removed\n\nas counsel and disqualified as an attorney for Hoskins. Thereafter, the trial court stated in a letter\n\nto counsel that, “After careful consideration, the court does find that the actions’s [sic]\n\nattributable to Cliff Hoskins (Cliff Hoskins, Inc.) are sanctionable, however, such actions do not\n\nrise to the level that warrants striking all pleadings and resulting in the Death Penalty in this\n\ncause. . . . The Court will continue to examine the appropriate sanctions to deter Mr. Hoskins and\n\nother similarly situated parties of future litigations [sic].”\n\n        At a later date, the trial court heard evidence to determine monetary sanctions. Counsel\n\nfor Prize testified that, in light of the facts and the goals of deterrence, and taking into account\n\nthe lack of acceptance of responsibility by Hoskins or his counsel, a reasonable monetary\n\nsanction against Hoskins would be $300,000. Counsel for the Rutherfords testified that, in his\n\nopinion, an appropriate monetary sanction would be $500,000, due to Hoskins’ affront to the\n\njudicial process and the court’s inherent power to protect the judicial process. The trial court\n\nordered that “based upon the scale of this litigation and the egregious conduct that abused the\n\njudicial process, the Prize Defendants shall have and recover attorneys’ fees in the sum of\n\n$100,000.00 from Hoskins as monetary sanctions, and that the Rutherford Defendants shall have\n\nand recover attorneys’ fees in the sum of $100,000.00 from Hoskins as monetary sanctions.”\n\n\n\n                                                  - 51 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       (2) Standard of Review.

Hoskins first contends monetary sanctions were improper because they\n\nwere not pleaded or requested at or prior to the scheduled hearings; rather, Prize and the\n\nRutherfords sought only death penalty sanctions, not monetary sanctions. Hoskins relies on In re\n\nEstate of Gaines, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2348410\"><a href=\"/opinion/2348410/in-re-estate-of-gaines/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (Tex.

Id. at 60-\n\n61. The court held that pleadings were required because the attorney’s fees were awarded\n\npursuant to a statutory provision. Id. Here, Rule 215.2 permits the imposition of sanctions after\n\n“notice and a hearing,” both of which were provided to Hoskins. TEX. R. CIV.

Accordingly, we cannot conclude monetary sanctions were improper based on the\n\nabsence of proper pleadings.\n\n       Next, Hoskins complains that Prize and the Rutherfords failed to offer competent\n\nevidence of monetary harm suffered as a result of the alleged discovery abuse. Specifically,\n\nHoskins contends that because Prize and the Rutherfords did not introduce attorneys’ fees bills,\n\nthere was no evidence of the reasonable expenses related to the discovery abuse. When the\n\njudgment is not one for earned attorneys’ fees, but rather a judgment imposing attorneys’ fees as\n\nsanctions, it is not invalid because a party fails to prove attorneys’ fees.

App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied)). Therefore, we cannot conclude the award of sanctions was\n\nimproper based on insufficient evidence.\n\n       Hoskins also argues the trial court abused its discretion in awarding monetary sanctions\n\nbecause there was no direct relationship between the discovery abuse and the sanction imposed.\n\nSpecifically, Hoskins maintains that its former counsel, Leitch, was solely responsible for the\n\nalleged discovery abuses. Hoskins argues that, of the discovery abuses cited, the only abuse that\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords allege Hoskins should have known about was the meeting between\n\nLeitch, Cliff Hoskins, and Rick Rudolph. The other alleged abuses involve Hoskins’ attendance\n\nat depositions, where he merely obtained knowledge of Leitch’s improprieties that had already\n\noccurred.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 54 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n       The trial court must at least attempt to determine whether the offensive conduct is\n\nattributable only to counsel, only to the party, or to both. Paradigm Oil, Inc. v. Retamco\n\nOperating, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2342781\"><a href=\"/opinion/2342781/paradigm-oil-v-retamco-operating/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2004, pet. denied) (citing\n\nTransAmerican, 811 S.W.2d at 917). Although a party should not be punished for counsel’s\n\nconduct in which the party is not implicated apart from having entrusted its legal representation\n\nto counsel, a party must bear some responsibility for its counsel’s discovery abuses when it is or\n\nshould be aware of counsel’s conduct and the violation of the discovery rules. Paradigm, 161\n\nS.W.3d at 537. Ultimately, the sanction imposed by the trial court must relate directly to the\n\nabuse found. Id.\n\n       Here, Prize and the Rutherfords presented some evidence that Hoskins was at least aware\n\nof Leitch’s misconduct. In his own deposition, Hoskins admitted that he authorized the letters\n\nsent by Leitch to nonparties on false letterhead as part of the investigation Leitch was\n\nconducting. Additionally, Hoskins verified interrogatory answers which sought information\n\nabout Leitch’s misconduct.     Hoskins was also put on notice of Leitch’s improper conduct\n\nbecause co-counsel was copied on Prize’s counsel’s communications to all counsel of record\n\ncomplaining of Leitch’s improper conduct. We conclude the record supports the trial court’s\n\nfinding that Hoskins, not just Leitch, should be sanctioned. Thus, there was a direct relationship\n\nbetween Hoskins’ conduct and the resulting sanctions.\n\n       Finally, Hoskins maintains that the award of $100,000 to each group of defendants was\n\nunreasonable, excessive, unrelated to the alleged discovery abuse, and constitutes an\n\nimpermissible penalty. Reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude the trial court’s order\n\nmeets both parts of the test for a “just” sanction based on the discovery abuse by Leitch.\n\nLeitch’s actions violated Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 4.01, 4.03, 4.04, and\n\n\n\n                                              - 55 -\n\f                                                                                                        04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n8.04. 32 See TEX.

Such conduct involved an effort to\n\ntaint and obstruct the discovery process by way of witness tampering, misrepresentation of\n\ncounsel’s identity, securing documents under false pretenses, contacting represented witnesses in\n\nthe absence of their counsel, and falsely threatening witnesses with criminal prosecution. As\n\ndiscussed earlier, these actions were known to Hoskins, who continued to retain Leitch until\n\nLeitch was disqualified by the trial court. Given this egregious conduct, counsel for Prize and\n\nthe Rutherfords testified that a reasonable monetary sanction would be in the range of $300,000\n\nto $500,000. The trial court declined to grant death penalty sanctions, and instead awarded\n\nsanctions in the amount of $100,000 to both Prize and the Rutherford. We hold that based on\n\nthis record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in assessing $200,000 in sanctions for\n\ndiscovery abuse. Accordingly, we affirm the portion of the trial court’s judgment imposing\n\nsanctions against Hoskins.\n\n                                    BANK OF AMERICA’S CROSS-APPEAL\n\n         Finally, on cross-appeal, Bank of America challenges the summary judgment granted in\n\nfavor of Prize and the Rutherfords “on all claims by Bank of America, N.A., as Trustee of the\n\nBaker Trusts, including claims of fraud and rescission of the Ratification.” The Bank also\n\n32\n   Rule 4.01 provides: “In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly: (a) make a false\nstatement of material fact or law to a third person.” TEX.

Summary Judgment on the Bank’s Claims\n\n          (1) Relevant Factual Background.              As previously discussed, the Baker Lease\n\nterminated in August 2001 due to cessation of production for more than sixty consecutive days;\n\nthe Bank, however, was not aware that the Baker Lease had expired. In 2004, Cliff Hoskins\n\ninformed BP that he had information indicating that the Baker Lease, the El Paso Lease, and the\n\nJOA had expired. BP then alerted Prize that it had “received information indicating that . . .\n\nthere may have been no production from the [Leased] Property between June 2001 and April\n\n2002 and that reports filed with the Texas Railroad Commission did not properly reflect such\n\ncessation of production.” BP requested specific documents to determine the current status of the\n\nJOA, but Prize refused, maintaining that “there has been continuous production.” Prize advised\n\nBP to check production records filed with the Texas Railroad Commission.\n\n          In January 2005, attorneys for Hoskins sent Prize a demand letter claiming that the Baker\n\nLease, the El Paso Lease, and the JOA had expired in August 2001 because “there has not in fact\n\nbeen continuous production (or Operations to restore same) either in paying quantities or\n\notherwise in excess of at least one 60 day continuous period . . . .” Hoskins’ demand letter also\n\nalleges     that   Prize     concealed   the   expiration   of   the   Leases   and   the   JOA   “by\n\nmanipulating/fabricating production information and gas and condensate sales, and Revenue and\n\nRoyalty information and by misrepresenting production information and gas and condensate\n\nsales information . . . .”\n\n          Prize then amended production reports (“P-2s”) it had filed with the Railroad\n\nCommission in 2001. The amended P-2s, filed in 2005, reflect a reduction in the amount of gas\n\n\n\n                                                   - 57 -\n\f                                                                                              04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nproduced (measured in a thousand cubic feet of natural gas, abbreviated as “Mcf”) on the Baker\n\nWell No. 6 for June 2001 and on the Baker Well No. 4 for July 2001. The differences between\n\nthe two reports are summarized below:\n\n                P-2s filed in 2001                                    P-2s amended in 2005\n\nBaker No. 6                             Baker No. 4 Baker No. 6                          Baker No. 4\n\nJune 2001 1050 Mcf                     0 Mcf            June 2001 80 Mcf                 0 Mcf\n\nJuly 2001 1050 Mcf                      1085 Mcf        July 2001 1050 Mcf               0 Mcf\n\n\n\nThe 80 Mcf of gas reported for the Baker Well No. 6 in the amended report was attributed to\n\nfield use (70 Mcf) and a venting/flaring operation (10 Mcf).\n\n        On January 25, 2005, Hoskins filed suit to quiet title against Prize. As noted, supra, BP\n\nlater joined the suit as a plaintiff, also asserting that the Leases and JOA expired in 2001. Also\n\non January 25, 2005, the Rutherfords, acting for themselves and for Prize, approached the Bank,\n\nand requested that it sign a ratification of the Baker Lease. Rutherford representatives Mike\n\nRutherford, Dave Lewis, and Jack Chenowith met with Penny Judge, a Bank property manager,\n\nto discuss the proposed ratification. The Rutherford representatives told Judge that Hoskins’\n\nthreatened lawsuit was frivolous, but that even the threat of such a suit would cause them to stop\n\ndevelopment on the property, putting it at risk of drainage. Judge requested documentation\n\ndemonstrating that the Baker Lease had not expired.\n\n        In response to her request, Mike Rutherford sent Judge a letter on February 2, 2005\n\nattaching the Hoskins demand letter, a second letter from Hoskins’ attorneys, and production\n\ndata, including P-2s and gauge reports for the Baker Well No. 6. 33 In Rutherford’s letter to\n\n\n33\n  Mike Rutherford testified he obtained the P-2s and gauge reports from Prize and that Prize knew they would be\ngiven to the Bank as part of the ratification negotiation.\n\n                                                    - 58 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nJudge, he asserts that the Baker Lease did not terminate for cessation of production in 2001 for\n\nthe following reasons:\n\n       (a) the [Hoskins] Demand Letter ignores actual physical production of gas during\n       the period in question, (b) the Demand Letter relies heavily on the lack of\n       reported ‘sales’ of gas during June and July 2001, which we are informed by Prize\n       may be explained by mechanical conditions affecting the gas purchaser’s gas\n       metering equipment that was installed on the Lease at the time, (c) any failure to\n       produce constituted a temporary cessation of production, not a permanent\n       cessation, (d) the Demand Letter misstates the legal effect of a temporary\n       cessation of production under the Lease (and the other leases), even if one\n       assumed that a cessation of production occurred for any duration, and (e)\n       assuming that the Lease did terminate in mid-2001 (which we deny), the owners\n       of the Lessee’s interest under the Lease would have in any event acquired a\n       limitations title to the leasehold estate.\n\nRutherford’s letter concludes that Hoskins’ demand letter is simply an attempt to extort money\n\nfrom Prize, and asserts that Hoskins’ allegation could harm the Baker Trusts:\n\n       As we discussed with you, a suspension (or abandonment) of our drilling\n       activities caused by the mere existence of the allegation set forth in the Demand\n       Letter would expose [the Baker Property] to substantial drainage by offset\n       operators and thus, any delay in our operations will permanently and adversely\n       affect both the Working Interests Owners and the Baker Trusts.\n\nIn the letter, Rutherford also asserts the operators need assurance by way of a ratification that the\n\nBaker Lease remains in effect in order to avoid suspension of drilling activities.\n\n       Rutherford’s letter goes on to explain the P-2s and gauge reports. He states that the\n\nBaker Well No. 4 was shut-in for a swabbing operation in early April 2001; the operation was\n\nnot successful and the well was shut-in for further evaluation. He also states that the production\n\nvolumes from the Baker Well No. 6 were not fully registered by the gas metering equipment\n\nduring the relevant time period, and that Prize had confirmed that, “consistent with industry\n\npractice, the ‘sales’ figures reported on the Forms P-2 and HPL’s meter figures and the ‘lease\n\nuse’ figures are estimates of the quantities of gas consumed on the Lease for the operation of\n\nequipment and/or quantities lost to venting.” As for the gauge reports, Rutherford states in\n\n                                                - 59 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nAttachment C, entitled “Production Data,” that “the No. 6 well was ‘shut-in for buildup’ for\n\nmuch of June, all of July and the first half of August, but produced gas for a 3-day period in\n\nJune (June 15th through 17th). [T]hus, there was no cessation of production for more than sixty\n\nconsecutive days, as alleged in the Demand Letter.” (emphasis added). Lewis testified that he\n\nand Chenowith went over the P-2s and gauge reports with Judge, and that they highlighted this\n\n3-day period in June.\n\n       Judge took the ratification matter to her superior, Jeffrey Anderson, the Bank’s regional\n\nteam leader in the oil and gas asset management group.            Judge expressed her concern to\n\nAnderson that “if there was no ratification, . . . the operator would not drill wells and the\n\nhydrocarbons couldn’t be drained so there would be no royalties” for the Baker Trusts. She\n\ntestified in deposition that the Bank’s chief concern was future development, but that the\n\npossibility of drainage was also a concern. Judge viewed the ratification as the operator’s\n\n“insurance policy” to justify spending a substantial amount of money to drill new wells. Judge\n\nstated the Bank felt the Baker Lease had not terminated because the P-2s and gauge reports did\n\nnot show a cessation of production for more than sixty consecutive days and because the Bank\n\nhad been consistently receiving revenues.        She stated that the Bank decided to sign the\n\nratification because of concerns over drainage and future development, and to receive $106,000\n\nin consideration. Judge stated that had the Bank known that the Baker Lease had terminated, it\n\nwould have renegotiated a lease with a higher royalty. Judge acknowledged that the Hoskins\n\ndemand letter alleged that the Baker Lease had expired both because of a cessation of production\n\nexceeding sixty days and because of a failure to produce in paying quantities, but she could not\n\nrecall discussing or investigating the paying quantities issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 60 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n        Jeffrey Anderson also explained that the Bank did not pursue an investigation of the\n\npaying quantities issue because it would not have been able to get the necessary expense\n\ninformation from the operator. The Bank’s national trust oil and gas manager, Dick Sadler,\n\ntestified that most operators will not divulge their costs, and that in most cases the Bank would\n\nassume there is production in paying quantities if it is receiving royalty payments. The Bank\n\nconfirmed that it had been receiving royalty checks and therefore thought there were sales.\n\nAnderson further stated that the P-2s and gauge reports reflected production and that the Bank\n\nreceived payments on production during the relevant time period. Anderson testified that the\n\nBank’s reasoning for signing the ratification included ensuring development of the property and\n\nprotecting against drainage.\n\n        In his deposition, Mike Rutherford testified he told Judge that the ratification was sought\n\nas insurance to allow Prize and the Rutherfords to continue developing the property.             He\n\nacknowledged that he did not tell the Bank the following: that there was no production on the\n\nBaker Wells from June 1, 2001 to August 13, 2001; that the Baker Lease had expired in August\n\n2001; that the claimed venting of the Baker Well No. 6 did not occur; that Prize had paid\n\nroyalties on gas that was falsely reported; that Prize had filed false P-2s; or that Prize had filed\n\nfalse production reports.\n\n        On February 14, 2005, the Bank executed the Stipulation and Ratification of Oil and Gas\n\nLease (“the Ratification”) tendered by the Rutherfords. The Ratification provides, in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n        1. Each of the Baker Trusts and each of the Rutherfords (collectively, the\n           “Mineral Owners”) hereby stipulates and agrees that (a) the Lease is currently\n           in full force and effect and (b) the term of the Lease has been continuously\n           perpetuated since April 23, 1971, by either (i) the production of oil and/or gas\n           in paying quantities or (ii) operations, or both.\n\n\n\n                                               - 61 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n           2. Without limiting the foregoing, (a) each of the Baker Trusts hereby (i) ratifies\n              and adopts the Lease insofar as it covers or applies to the Leased Premises and\n              (ii) grants and leases the Leased Premises to the Lessees upon the terms and\n              provisions set forth in the Lease, and (b) each of the Rutherfords hereby (i)\n              ratifies and adopts the Lease insofar as it covers or applies to Survey 3 and\n              (iii) grants and leases Survey 3 to the Lessees upon the terms and provisions\n              set forth in the Lease.\n\n           3. Each of the Mineral Owners hereby waives and releases any and all claims\n              that the Lease terminated prior to the date of execution of this instrument for\n              any reason whatsoever.\n\n           After the Bank signed the Ratification, Hoskins amended its petition and named the Bank\n\nas a defendant. 34 It was during the course of discovery proceedings related to that lawsuit that\n\nthe Bank learned that the Leases and the JOA actually had terminated in 2001, that the\n\nrepresentations on which it relied in signing the Ratification were false, and that Prize and the\n\nRutherfords knew those representations were false. Hoskins nonsuited its claims against the\n\nBank, and the Bank asserted affirmative claims against Prize and the Rutherfords, including a\n\nrequest for a declaration that the Baker Lease terminated in August 2001. The Bank also sought\n\nrescission of the Ratification on grounds including fraudulent inducement, mutual mistake, and\n\nfailure of consideration.\n\n           With respect to the fraudulent inducement claim, the Bank alleged that Prize and the\n\nRutherfords made the following misrepresentations:\n\n           (1) the Baker Lease did not terminate; (2) the Baker No. 6 Well was flared on\n           June 15, 16, and 17, 2001; (3) flaring of the Baker No. 6 Well in June 2001\n           constituted production for purposes of the 60-day cessation of production clause\n           in the Baker Lease; (4) there was no cessation of production for a period\n           exceeding 60 days; (5) the Leased Property was at risk of substantial drainage if\n           the Bank did not sign the Ratification; and (6) signing the Ratification would\n           protect the Bank from the risk of drainage.\n\n\n\n\n34\n     Burlington signed a similar ratification document concerning the El Paso Lease.\n\n\n                                                         - 62 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nThe Bank also alleged that Prize and the Rutherfords failed to disclose that:\n\n       (1) Prize’s own internal documents show that no venting or flaring of the Baker\n       No. 6 Well occurred in June 2001 and that there was a cessation of production for\n       a period exceeding 60 days in the summer of 2001; (2) royalties paid in December\n       2001 for June 2001 were not based on actual gas sales but were based on gas that\n       was purportedly vented into the atmosphere; and (3) taxes paid in 2002 for gas\n       allegedly produced in June 2001 were not based on gas sales but were based on\n       the alleged venting operation.\n\nThe Bank alleged that these misrepresentations and concealments were material, made with\n\nknowledge of their falsity, or asserted recklessly without knowledge of the truth, were intended\n\nto be relied upon and were relied upon by the Bank to its detriment.\n\n       Thereafter, Prize and the Rutherfords jointly filed a traditional and no-evidence motion\n\nfor summary judgment as to all causes of action asserted against them by Hoskins, BP, the Bank,\n\nand Burlington. In the motion, they contend the Bank’s claims are precluded by the Ratification.\n\nFurther, the Bank’s claim that the Ratification was fraudulently induced fails because the alleged\n\nmisrepresentations concerning flaring and production were neither material or justifiably relied\n\nupon by the Bank as a matter of law.\n\n       The Bank filed separate responses to the no-evidence and traditional summary judgment\n\nmotion, to which Prize and the Rutherfords filed a joint reply. In its interlocutory judgment\n\ndated February 5, 2009, the trial court granted Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ motion for summary\n\njudgment on all claims by the Bank, including its claims of fraud and rescission of the\n\nRatification. The court ordered that the Bank take nothing on its claims against Prize and the\n\nRutherfords. The trial court’s final judgment incorporated the interlocutory judgment and taxed\n\nPrize’s and the Rutherfords’ costs against the Bank; the Bank was also ordered to bear its own\n\ncosts. The Bank timely filed its notice of cross-appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 63 -\n\f                                                                                                 04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n        (2) Summary of the Bank’s Argument. The Bank asserts the record and the trial\n\ncourt’s rulings establish that the basis for granting summary judgment against the Bank was the\n\ntrial court’s enforcement of the Ratification and its denial, as a matter of law, of the Bank’s claim\n\nthat the Ratification was fraudulently induced. On appeal, the Bank contends the trial court erred\n\nin granting a take-nothing summary judgment on all of its affirmative claims because: (1) Prize’s\n\nand the Rutherfords’ motion did not challenge each asserted ground for fraudulent inducement;\n\n(2) Prize and the Rutherfords did not conclusively establish that the entire Ratification was not\n\nvitiated by fraud; (3) Prize and the Rutherfords did not conclusively establish that their\n\nmisrepresentations concerning flaring and cessation of production were not material and that the\n\nBank did not justifiably rely on them; (4) the Bank raised a genuine issue of material fact on each\n\nchallenged element of the Bank’s claim for fraudulent inducement; and (5) the Bank raised a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact concerning Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ liability for trespass. 35\n\nAdditionally, the Bank contends the trial court abused its discretion in allocating all of Prize’s\n\nand the Rutherfords’ court costs to the Bank.\n\n        (3) Fraudulent Inducement. On appeal, the Bank complains the trial court erred in\n\ngranting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the Bank’s claim for fraudulent\n\ninducement.      We review the summary judgment under the standard of review previously\n\narticulated. Fraudulent inducement is a type of fraud claim that requires a showing that a false\n\nmaterial misrepresentation was made that (1) was either known to be false when made or was\n\nasserted without knowledge of the truth, (2) was intended to be relied upon, (3) was relied upon,\n\nand (4) caused injury.

Thus, for summary judgment purposes, these elements of fraudulent\n\ninducement are not in dispute. Prize and the Rutherfords moved for summary judgment on the\n\nBank’s claim for fraudulent inducement on the grounds that, as a matter of law: (1) any\n\nmisrepresentation concerning flaring is not material and could not have been justifiably relied\n\nupon because the Bank does not believe that flaring constitutes production; (2) any\n\nmisrepresentation that the Baker Lease had not expired due to a cessation of production for more\n\nthan sixty days is not material and could not have been justifiably relied upon because the Lease\n\ncould also have expired for failure to produce in paying quantities; and (3) the Bank not only\n\nratified the Baker Lease, but also entered into a new lease.

Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Flaring\n\n         The Bank first contends Prize and the Rutherfords did not conclusively establish that\n\ntheir misrepresentations and omissions concerning flaring were not material or that the Bank did\n\nnot justifiably rely on them.

App.—\n\nForth Worth 2004, no pet.). Here, before signing the Ratification, Prize and the Rutherfords\n\nrepresented to the Bank that flaring occurred on the Baker Well No. 6 in June 2001; Prize and\n\nthe Rutherfords now concede this statement was false. 36 Prize and the Rutherfords, however,\n\ncontend this misrepresentation is immaterial because the Bank did not believe that flaring\n\nconstitutes production. In support, Prize and the Rutherfords point to the deposition testimony of\n\nAnthony Gatti, Burlington’s corporate representative, and Peter Huddleston, plaintiffs’ 37 retained\n\nexpert, as well as the Bank’s admission number 37. 38 However, the testimony of Burlington’s\n\ncorporate representative is no evidence of a belief held by a different entity, the Bank.\n\nAdditionally, although Huddleston opined that flaring is not production, there is no evidence that\n\nhe conveyed his opinion to the Bank at or before the time the Ratification was signed; in fact, the\n\nrecord reflects that the Bank did not become his client until it “joined the proceeding,” which\n\nwas well after the Ratification was signed.\n\n           Finally, admission number 37 merely establishes that it is the Bank’s present belief that\n\nflaring does not constitute production.

The summary judgment record raises a fact issue that at the\n\ntime the Bank signed the Ratification, it relied on the written materials provided by Prize and the\n\nRutherfords which indicated that flaring is considered production sufficient to hold the Baker\n\nLease.    Specifically, Mike Rutherford’s letter to Judge stated that the Baker Well No. 6\n\n“produced gas for a 3-day period in June (June 15th through 17th)” 2001 and again in mid-\n\nAugust; “thus, there was no cessation of production for more than sixty consecutive days, as\n\nalleged in the Demand Letter.” This assertion is based on the production data, which shows\n\n“flaring to tank” for the three days in question. Thus, Prize and the Rutherfords represented that\n\nflaring constituted production sufficient to hold the Baker Lease. Both Judge and Anderson\n\ntestified that the Bank decided to sign the Ratification based on Rutherford’s assurance that the\n\nLease had not terminated; this assurance was based on the production data showing that there\n\nhad been no cessation of production (due to flaring). Hence, the misrepresentation regarding\n\nflaring was material because it induced the Bank to sign the Ratification. See Citizens Nat’l\n\nBank, 142 S.W.3d at 478-79.\n\n         Reliance\n\n         Further, we cannot conclude that Prize and the Rutherfords established as a matter of law\n\nthat the Bank did not justifiably rely on the misrepresentations and omissions regarding flaring.\n\nThe issue of justifiable reliance is generally a question of fact. 1001 McKinney Ltd. v.

As previously discussed, however, Prize and the Rutherfords\n\nassured the Bank that there was no validity to the cessation of production allegation, and\n\ntherefore induced the Bank to sign the Ratification.        Clearly then, the misrepresentation\n\nregarding cessation of production, regardless of the Bank’s knowledge of the paying quantities\n\nclaim, was material. See Citizens Nat’l Bank, 142 S.W.3d at 478-79 (representation is material if\n\na reasonable person would be induced to act on it in determining his choice of actions).\n\n       Second, we disagree that the summary judgment evidence establishes that Prize and the\n\nRutherfords did not make a misrepresentation regarding the paying quantities issue.          Jack\n\nChenowith testified that when the Rutherfords asked the Bank to sign the Ratification, they\n\nrepresented to the Bank that the Leases had not terminated. Such a blanket statement implicitly\n\nindicates the Baker Lease did not terminate for any reason, including for failure to produce in\n\npaying quantities. Additionally, the record contains evidence that Rutherford did not tell the\n\nBank that Prize paid royalty and working interest owners for gas that was falsely reported. Thus,\n\nthere is summary judgment evidence raising a fact issue that Prize and the Rutherfords concealed\n\nthat the Lease had terminated, both for cessation of production and for failure to produce in\n\npaying quantities. Accordingly, we cannot conclude Prize and the Rutherfords established that\n\ntheir misrepresentations regarding cessation of production were not material as a matter of law.\n\nSee Brush, 984 S.W.2d at 727.\n\n\n\n                                              - 69 -\n\f                                                                                                  04-09-00603-CV\n\n\n        Reliance\n\n        Moreover, we cannot conclude Prize and the Rutherfords conclusively established that\n\nthe Bank did not justifiably rely on their misrepresentations and omissions regarding cessation of\n\nproduction. Although Prize and the Rutherfords contend that the Bank failed to investigate\n\nwhether the Baker Lease terminated for failure to produce in paying quantifies, the Bank was\n\njustified in relying on Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ statements that the Lease had not terminated.\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords were the operators and had superior access to the necessary production\n\nand expense information. As Anderson testified, the Bank had no reason to disbelieve the\n\nrepresentation that the Baker Lease produced in paying quantities because the Rutherfords, not\n\nthe Bank, were the ones with access to such information. Again, justifiable reliance is generally\n\na question of fact. 1001 McKinney, 192 S.W.3d at 30. We therefore hold that based on this\n\nrecord, Prize and the Rutherfords failed to establish that the Bank did not justifiably rely on\n\nPrize’s and the Rutherfords’ misrepresentations and omissions as a matter of law.\n\n        (4) Fact versus non-actionable opinion. Prize and the Rutherfords attempt to justify\n\nthe summary judgment granted in their favor on the ground that they made only statements of\n\nopinion. They portray the Bank’s fraudulent inducement claim as based on two representations\n\nmade by Mike Rutherford, both of which are non-actionable opinions: (1) that Prize and the\n\nRutherfords would ultimately prevail in litigation by establishing Hoskins’ claims were\n\nmeritless, and (2) that abandonment of drilling could expose the property to drainage by others. 39\n\n\n\n39\n   In their briefing, Prize and the Rutherfords also assert there is no evidence they represented that the property\nsubject to the Baker Lease would risk substantial drainage if the Ratification was not signed. Therefore, they argue\nthe trial court properly dismissed this fraud claim. We disagree. The essence of the Bank’s claim regarding the\ndrainage statement is that Prize and the Rutherfords used that statement to wrongly induce the Bank to quickly sign\nthe Ratification. In that regard, the summary judgment evidence raises a fact question as to whether Prize and the\nRutherfords made this statement, while concealing the fact that the Baker Lease had terminated due to non-\nproduction, in order to avoid the consequences of the terminating old lease and to prevent the Bank from negotiating\na new, more favorable lease. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the Bank’s fraud\n\n                                                       - 70 -\n\f                                                                                               04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nWe disagree with Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ attempt to recast and limit the Bank’s fraud claim\n\nand their characterization of the statements at issue as mere opinion. As their pleadings and\n\nsummary judgment evidence reflect, the Bank alleged and presented evidence of more than two\n\nmisrepresentations and concealments of material fact. Furthermore, the Bank alleged Prize and\n\nthe Rutherfords made numerous discrete statements of fact. For example, the statement that the\n\nBaker Well No. 6 “produced gas for a 3-day period in June” is an affirmative and discrete\n\nstatement of fact, not an opinion, which Prize and the Rutherfords now concede was false. See\n\nMarshall, 288 S.W.3d at 444 (statements concerning continuous operations and no cessation of\n\noperations for more than 60 days were factual representations, not mere opinions). Finally, even\n\nstatements of opinion are actionable if the opinion is “based on or buttressed with false facts,” if\n\nthe speaker knows the statement is false, or if the speaker purports to have special knowledge of\n\nthe facts or actually has superior knowledge of the facts.

Faircloth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432517\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432517/transport-ins-co-v-faircloth/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 277 (Tex. 1995). Here, the summary judgment evidence raises a fact question\n\nsufficient to defeat summary judgment that Prize and the Rutherfords, as the working interest\n\nowners of the wells in question, made false statements of fact to the Bank. See id. at 276\n\n(“Whether a statement is an actionable statement of ‘fact’ or merely one of ‘opinion’ often\n\ndepends on the circumstances in which a statement is made.”).\n\n        (5) New Lease. Prize and the Rutherfords also moved for summary judgment on the\n\nbasis that even if the Ratification was procured by fraud, the Bank’s fraudulent inducement claim\n\nmust fail because the Ratification revived the Baker Lease. Prize and the Rutherfords contended\n\nthat paragraph 2(a)(ii) of the Ratification re-leased the property by providing that each of\n\nBurlington, the Baker Trusts, and the Rutherfords additionally “grants and leases the Leased\n\n\nclaim as it relates to the drainage representation. See Grinnell, 951 S.W.2d at 425 (summary judgment improperly\ngranted when genuine issue of material fact exists).\n\n                                                     - 71 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00603-CV\n\n\nPremises to Lessees upon the terms and conditions set forth in the [original] Lease. . . . ” Prize\n\nand the Rutherfords assert that this “granting” language created new or renewal leases with the\n\nsame terms and conditions as the original leases, in the event the old leases had expired. We\n\nreject this argument. Fraud as to the Ratification vitiates the entire agreement. “[Texas] courts\n\nhave consistently held that fraud vitiates whatever it touches. . . .” Stonecipher’s Estate v. Butts’\n\nEstate, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1792543\"><a href=\"/opinion/1792543/estate-of-stonecipher-v-estate-of-butts/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 809 (Tex. 1979). As discussed above, there is evidence in this summary\n\njudgment record showing that the Bank would not have signed the Ratification as a whole but for\n\nthe material misrepresentations made by Prize and the Rutherfords and justifiably relied upon by\n\nthe Bank. As Judge testified, had the Bank known the Baker Lease had terminated, it would not\n\nhave signed the Ratification, but instead would have attempted to renegotiate a higher royalty.\n\nTherefore, we conclude the mere fact that the Ratification contains renewal or revivor language\n\ndoes not establish as a matter of law that the Bank was not induced to execute the Ratification by\n\nPrize’s and the Rutherfords’ misrepresentations that the Baker Lease had not expired.\n\n       (6) Ratification and Waiver. Finally, in their briefing, Prize and the Rutherfords also\n\nargue the Bank performed under the Ratification by signing division orders in 2006 and allowing\n\nPrize and the Rutherfords to drill under the Baker Lease, thereby ratifying the agreement and\n\nwaiving any right to assert fraud as a ground to avoid or rescind the Ratification. However, these\n\ncontentions were not raised as grounds in the motion for summary judgment. TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n166a(c) (motion for summary judgment must “state the specific grounds therefor” and the issues\n\nmust be “expressly set out in the motion”); Stiles v.

App.—San\n\nAntonio 2002, pet. denied).\n\n        While the trial court denied all of the Bank’s claims against Prize and the Rutherfords by\n\nsummary judgment based on its enforcement of the Ratification, the court also denied Prize’s\n\nand the Rutherfords’ counterclaims against the Bank. Despite the fact that both parties were\n\npartially successful, the trial court assessed all of Prize’s and the Rutherfords’ costs against the\n\nBank without stating on the record the reason for doing so.
