Royalty Trust could be funneled. Albert's plan was that by\n\n      the time the I.R.S. caught up with his own specialized version of the trickle-down theory, Albert\n\n      would be long gone to Central America.\n\n              14.      Scott is aware that Albert deliberately engages in fraud and that he illegally\n\n      drafted the CSL. By seeking protection for Albert in tenns of the deposition while still\n\n      maintaining that Albert is not his. client, Scott knowingly furthers Albert's    e~orts   to elude\n\n      justice, in violation of Texas Rules of Evidence Rule No. 503(d)(1).\n\n              15.      Albert's defense that he is too ill to travel is blatant subterfuge, designed to\n\n      protect Albert from exposure to this suit, including the deposition. The statement provided by\n\n      Albert's alleged physician, Leoncl Montenegro, did not declare that Dr. Montenegro examined\n\n      Albert, only that Albert's medical file was in the office, and that the statement was presented at\n\n      the request of an interested party. See Exhibit D. Albert has a history of faking health issues to\n\n      avoid legal action. For instance, in or around November 30, 2009, Albert was said to have faked\n\n      a heart attack in order to avoid prosecution for not cleaning the wreckage of his $500,000 yacht,\n\n      The Great Escape, which ran agrpund off the Coast of Belize and fouled its pristine barrier reef.\n\n      News reports from Channel 5 of Belize quoted Newspaper Editor Roy McNett, who stated that\n\n      he spoke with Albert following the accident According to Roy, Albert \"did not have a heart\n\n      attack,\" and at that time was buying land in Rio Dulce.

The location is obviously convenient to Pentex's\n\n      Counsel, and the date was offered as available by Pentex's Counsel. There can be no place and\n\n      time more convenient for the deposition.3\n\n              17.      Pentex's resistance to the Subpoena is because Albert and Pentex have a great\n\n      deal of infonnation that each wistt.es to bide, as it promises to affect the outcome of this suit\n\n      adversely. Albert is a crucial elem~nt in the events addressed in this suit Albert is the admitted\n\n      Legal Representative for Pentex. Pentex must therefore produce Albert for deposition at the\n\n      appointed place and time.\n\n                                     ID;     DEPosmON OF ANGELLI CARRASCO.\n\n              18.      On September 2, 2014, Ken and Candy issued Angelli a State of Texas Subpoena\n\n      Duces Tecum for Oral Deposition, to be conducted on October 13, 2014, at 10 o'clock a.m., at\n\n      the office ofPentex's Counsel Scott Smith, 120 South Crockett Street, Sherman, Texas 75091-\n\n      0354. See Exhibit F.\n\n              19.      Based on infonnation provided to· Ken and Candy during discovery, Angelli\n\n      Carrasco is President, Director, and Chainnan of Pentex- three (3) apex-level positions of\n\n      authority in Pentex. Per the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure requiring service to counsel when\n\n      counsel exists, the Subpoena to Angelli was rightfully served to Scott. Service to any other\n\n      party would not be effective, as Scott represents Pentex.\n\n\n\n      3\n       Ken and Candy believe that Albert, whose residence is in Guatemala, is currently traveling in Texas. Although\n      Scott was able to produce a signed unverified Affidavit ftom Albert on September 3, 2014, Scott claimed that\n      obtaining an Affidavit fiom Angelli Cattasco, ftom Panama, was impossible due to logistics.\n      OBJECJ'IONS TO ManoN TO QuASH OR FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER\n      RELATING TO SUBPOENAS AND DEPOSmON NoTICES AND ·\n      MonON TO COMPEL DEPOSmONS OF ALBERT BARCROFT AND                                      CAUSE No. CV-14-41665\n      ANGELLI CARRASCO ON 0croBER 13,2014                                                                        -7-\n      PENTEX FOUNDATION r. GIBBS, El' AI..\n\n\n\n407\n\f              20.     AngeJIPs deposition is necessary to achieve justice in this matter. Angelli was\n\n      noticed that her deposition will address questions concerning her personal knowledge of the\n\n      following: (1) the incorporation ofPentex Foundation; (2) daily activities ofPentex Foundation;\n\n      (3) all monies received from the Estate and GWB Trust; (4) the board minutes on or about\n\n      August 4, 2014, in which she agreed to file suit against Kenneth Gibbs and Candace Gibbs in\n\n      Fannin County; and (5) Albert'$ and Danny Unger's legal authority to act on Pentex\n\n      Foundation's behalf. Each of the issues goes to allegations made by Albert concerning the\n\n      functions of Pentex as relates to the CSL, the FSA, and GWB Trust. Each of these issues is\n\n      highly pertinent to the Cause, likely to lead to information which is highly pertinent to the\n\n      Cause, and therefore discoverable.\n\n              21.     As a President and Director and Chairman of a multi-national corporation, which\n\n      is currently involved in a lawsuit concerning more than $1 million in assets, Angelli's excuse\n\n      that she does not own a passport for travel to the United States is only that - an excuse. The\n\n      excuse that Pentex does not control Angelli is yet another excuse - as President and Director\n\n      and Chairman of Pentex., Angelli answers to Pentex for her actions involving the organization.\n\n      Pentex can indeed require her to attend a deposition on its behalf.\n\n              22.     The Subpoena to Angelli stated that the deposition would take place in the office\n\n      of Pentex's Counsel, on October 13, 2014. The location is obviously convenient to Pentex's\n\n      Counsel, and the date was offered as available by Pentex's Counsel. There can be no place and\n\n      time more convenient for the deposition.\n\n              23.     Pentex's resistance to Angelli's Subpoena suggests that, as is the case with\n\n      Albert's deposition, Pentex has a great deal to hide. Angelli holds the top-ranked positions in\n      OBJECTIONS TO MonON TO QuASH OR FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER\n      RELATING TO SUBPOENAS AND DEPOSmON NOTicEs AND\n      MonON TO COMPEL DEPOSmONS OF ALBERT BARCROFT AND                            CAUSENo. CV-1441665\n      ANGELLI CARRASCO ON OCToBER 13,2014                                                            -8-\n      PENTEX FOUNDATION 1'.

It is reasonable to think that Angelli, as\n\n      President/Director/Chainnan, would know of the ongoing lawsuit (particularly since she\n\n      allegedly signed Minutes of Board Meetings approving Scott's retention), just as it is reasonable\n\n      to assume that Scott represents her as President/Director/Chairman because he represents\n\n      Pentex. Ken and Candy are entitled to depose ADgelli. As Plaintiff in this matter, Pentex is\n\n      responsible for producing Angelli for the deposition.\n\n                                            IV.

Subject to this objection, Pentex\n             Foundation answers as follows:\n\n             Pentex Royalty Trust is a trust domestic to the United States that was created\n             as a trust to take in all ~venue due from taxable sources within the United\n             States, pay any U.S. taxes or other obligations due, and then distribute its\n             remaining beneficial interests. Pentex Foundation is the sole beneficiary of\n             Pentex Royalty Trust. :Pentex Royalty Trust has a paid trustee who is not\n             associated, or familiar with, any other phase of Pentex Foundation. The tax\n             obligations are figured, by computing and filing a Return 1042 with the\n             Internal Revenue Servjce meeting the requirements of the Internal Revenue\n             Code. The voting rights issue was always a problem because the purported\n             trustees of GWB trust never had a clear and defined way of doing anything.\n             For that reason, Pentex Foundation assigned it voting shares by proxy to Jim\n             Walton as long as he was the purported trustee. We have no record of any\n             official votes after Beverly Miller became the purported trustee.\n\n      INTERROGATORY NO. 2: Detail your relationship with Albert, including\n      specifics concerning his activities within your entity; on whose authority Albert\n      serves as your Legal Representative; amounts of payment for Albert's services to\n      you; percentages of distributions to you from GWB Trust which Albert ultimately\n      receives; Albert's arrangements to pay Estate attorneys in order to uphold his\n      responsibilities to the CSL and the FSA; Albert's payments of legal fees with\n      regard to this lawsuit; Albert's involvement in this lawsuit (i.e., whether Albert was\n      responsible for instigating the lawsuit); and all other involvement of Albert\n      concerning your involvement with GWB Trust.\n\n             ANSWER: Pentex Foundation objects to this interrogatory as outside the\n             scope of permissible discovery and overly broad.

It was mutually advantageous to continue to\n             work with Albert to bring the terms of the contract to conclusion, and he\n             served and serves on our behalf in the matter. To the knowledge ofPentex\n             Foundation, Albert had ~o responsibilities to pay any attorneys other than\n             John Skotnik in the matter, and such was not shown in any documentation\n             presented to Pentex Foundation. When Pentex was forced to hire new\n             counsel in the case, it did not have sufficient funds in the United States to\n             pay the full retainer. Mr. Barcroft did. Pentex Foundation gave Mr.\n             Barcroft money here, and he sent that money to Scott Smith in the United\n             States. Mr. Barcroft definitely made Pentex Foundation aware that he\n             thought there was a problem in the way proceeds were being paid by GWB\n             Trust, if that qualifies as instigation. In brief, Barcroft was our express\n             liaison with GWB trust, whatever it is.\n      INTERROGATORY NO. 3: JExplain the reasons you came to believe that\n      contingency fee attorneys were deducting their fees from the total due you, Ken,\n      Candy, and Howard Kirk, then issuing one check to GWB Trust, including the\n      rationale for believing that in excess of$ 1 million in attorney fees were due from\n      Ken, Candy, and Howard Kirk; when and how you arrived at these alleged facts;\n      and the reason that Beverly Miller was instructed to assign 57.19% interest in\n      GWB Trust to GBU Trust, when you were entitled to a far smaller percentage.\n             ANSWER: Pentex Foundation objects to this interrogatory as outside the\n             scope of permissible discovery and overly broad.

Of the 75%, Pentex Foundation owned 30%, equaling 22.5% of\n             everything distributed by the estate (75% X 30%=22.5%). The estate\n             distributed mineral interests to GWB Trust equaling 35.04% of the total\n             minerals owned by the estate. It also distributed 2.46% directly to John\n             Skotnik in payment for his services as attorney (an amount due solely by\n             Barcroft). Of the 35.04% distributed to GWB Trust, Pentex Foundation\n             owned 20.04% (22.5% minus the 2.46% already distributed to Skotnik).\n             20.04% is 57.19% of35.04%; thus, Pentex Foundation owned 57.19% of the\n\n      PENTEX FOUNDATION'S RESPONSE TO DISCOVERY FROM KENNETH GIBBS                      Page 9\n\n\n\n\n427\n                                                                          Page _ _  (-+J-\n\f              minerals transferred to GWB Trust by the estate.\n\n      INTERROGATORY NO. 4: Detail and explain the contents of all oral\n      communications dating back to September 1, 2008, which you have had with\n      Howard Kirk, including all agreements to cooperate with you, Albert or Danny\n      Unger in this lawsuit; including your communications with Howard Kirk at the\n      Tarrant case hearing on July 31,2014, including the reason for conferring with\n      him, when he is a Defendant in this case; and disclose whether you consulted\n      Howard Kirk in drafting your requests for Admissions and whether you assisted\n      Howard Kirk in producing his responses to your demands for discovery, since he\n      was capable of response to you within fewer than five (5) hours of receiving your\n      Requests; and disclose whether John Skotnik, when acting as your Counsel,\n      cooperated with Howard Kirk in motioning the Court to remove Ken as\n      Independent Administrator of the Estate.\n\n             ANSWER: Pentex Foundation objects to any such communications initiated\n             after the anticipation of litigation and/or protected pursuant to the \"joint\n             defense doctrine\" recognized in TEX.

GBU Trust objected to Request for Production Nos. 2, 7, 9- 11, 14- 18, 21,23-\n 25, 41 - 54, 51 - 59, 62, and 68, based on the joint defense doctrine.

Request for Production Nos. 4 and 64 are allowable and not protected from\n discovery. Albert Barcroft, creator ofPentex Foundation, Pentex Royalty Trust, GWB Trust, and\n GBU Trust, and Joshua Unger, Trustee of GBU Trust, are both known tax protesters. GBU Trust\n was fraudulently created in' order to avoid paying federal income taxes and continue their tax\n fraud schemes. Tax returns and infonnation relevant to tax returns are discoverable when they\n are relevant to the cause or when they are likely to lead to relevant information concerning the\n cause. Hall v. Lawlis, 907 S.W.2d 493 (Tex. 1995); Chamberlain v. Cherry, 818 S.W.2d 201\n (Amarillo 1991). Crime, including fraud, is an exception to the assertion of client-attorney\n\n DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY\n FROM GBU FRIENDS AND AsSOCIATES TRUST                                       CAUSBNO. CV-14-41665\n PENTEX FOUNDATION V. GIBBS, E1' AL.                                                          -2-\n\n\n459\n\fprivilege. Plaintiff and Counsel are engaged in fraud before this Court, and Plaintiff is\ncommitting tax fraud. The objection to No. 64 as overly broad is ridiculous. No. 64 speciracally\nasks, \"Produce any copy of any payments you made to the Internal Revenue Service of\nDepartment of Treasury,\" and No.4 states, \"Produce a copy of your IRS Form 1041 for 2013.\"\n\n        4.     The objection of invasion of privacy and harassment to Request for Production\nNos. 5, and 69 - 72 is not appropriate, and frankly ridiculous. Axelson, Inc. v. Mci/hany, 798\nS.W.2d 500, 553 (Tex. 1990). The Request seeks infonnation about income to GBU Trust, which\nwas established solely to receive distributions from GWB Trust. GBU Trust states that it has not\nreceived the money from GWB Trust to which it is entitled. Defendants strongly object to this\nassertion and lawsuit. Defendants are entitled to know how much money GBU Trust has\nreceived. All related discovery, including OBU Trust's distributions to members, is allowable, as\nthe discovery is likely to lead to discovery relevant to this Cause. Again, the objection to\n\"outside scope of legitimate discovery\" is not an appropriate objection.\n\n        5.      The objection of overly broad categories to Request for Production Nos. 5, 22, 33,\n36, 38, 39, and 64 is not appropriate. The Requests posit that the infonnation requested is to date\nback to the inception of GBU Trust (November 1, 2013). Again, the objection to \"outside scope\nof legitimate discovery\" is not an appropriate objection. Also, see No. 4 above. In addition, in\nresponse to No. 22 (\"produce all documents upon which you base the claims that you are the\n'real party in interest in this suit ... \"'), the response was, \"objection as it is overly broad and\ninvades work product [and protected].\" What? How is this overly broad? And even more\nconfusing, why is GBU Trust refusing to provide information concerning its declaration that it is\nthe real party in interest in this litigation? Defendants are entitled to this information, as it is\nlikely to be a crucial element in their defense.\n\n        6.     The objection of work product and client-attorney privilege to Request for\nProduction Nos. 22, and 38 - 39 is not appropriate. Such an objection points to furtherance of\nfraud. Jim Waller Homes, Inc. v. Foster, 593 S.W.2d 749, 752 (Tex. Civ. App.- Eastland 1979,\nno writ). Texas Rules of Evidence Rule No. 503(d)(l). As Intervenor, GBU Trust must provide\nevidence of the claims to the assets currently under dispute. Joshua Unger, as Trustee of GBU\nTrust, was not involved with the Estate's calculations for the attorneys' fees in dispute. No\nclient-attorney privilege or work product privilege can attach. Also, see No. 5 above.\n\n        7.     The objection of falling outside the scope of legitimate discovery to Request for\nProduction Nos. 6, 64, and 69 - 72 is not an appropriate objection to discovery, and all\ninformation should be produced immediately, as that information promises to lead to discovery\nhighly relevant to this Cause.\n\nResoonses to Interrogatories.\n\n       8.      The objections to Interrogatory No. 2 and 4 as being outside the scope of\npennissible discovery and overly broad and assuming facts not in evidence are not appropriate.\nThe Interrogatories ask for specific information concerning GBU Trust's relationship to the CSL\n\nDEFENDANTS' MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY\nFROM GBU FRIENDS AND ASSoclATES TRUST                                        CAUSENo. CV-14-41665\nPENTEX FOUNDA'170N Y.

The answers to the Interrogatories\npromise to lead to relevant information concerning this lawsuit Facts presented in the\nInterrogatories are not assumed, but evidenced by information provided by GBU Trust.\n\nResponses to Admissions.\n\n        9.      The response to Request for Admission No. 50 is not appropriate. GBU Trust\nclaims to have made reasonable inquiry concerning calculations for percentages due Heirs from\nthe Estate, as calculated by Albert Barcroft, but GBU Trust was unable to obtain the information.\nCounsel for GBU Trust admitted to having repeated contact with Albert Barcroft and could\neasily respond with an admission or denial.\n\n        I0.    The objection to Request for Admission No. 65 is not appropriate. The Request\naddresses the creation of the CSL, which Plaintiff argues is crucial to this lawsuit. The Request\ndoes not fall outside the scope of legitimate discovery, as an Admission or Denial promises to\nlead to relevant discovery.\n\n                                    II.

Whether a document\n        relates to a legal contention made in the pleadings is plaiilly a determination made\n        by legal counsel, or at best, a determination made by and between counsel and\n        client.

this suit,\" rather than Pentex, the Original Plaintiff,\n      including how you arrived at the status of being the \"real party in interest in this\n      suit\" and explam in detail your reasoning for not being the Original Plaintiff in this\n      suit, while Pentex, whom you deny is the \"real party in interest,\" initiated this suit.\n             ANSWER: Intervenor objects to this interrogatory as outside the scope of\n             permissible discovery and overly broad. Interrogatories may be used to\n             ascertain basic legal and factual claims and defenses, but may not be used to\n             force a party to marshal evidence.\" See, Rule 197 of the Texas Rules of Civil\n             Procedure, at comment 1. Subject to this objection, Intervenor answers as\n             follows:\n             GBU Trust accepted the contribution from Pentex Foundation as one of the\n             settlors to GBU Trust. As such, GBU Trust has full ownership at this point of\n             time of the interests Pentex Foundation did hold in the \"Contract for Sale of\n             Land, Mineral Rights and Royalties, and all other Assets or Monies Received\n             from the Estate otBert Hughes Gibbs, Kathryn G. Gibbs, and/or the Mary L.\n             Houseworth Trust(s)\", referred to herein throughout as \"Contract\". The fact .\n             that GBU Trust should have been a co-plaintiflin this suit from the beginning\n             was an oversight by the original attorney, John Skotnik, which was later\n             corrected.\n      INTERROGATORY NO.2: Explain your rationale for entering a lawsuit as\n      Intervenor, when you believe that you are not bound by the agreement previously\n      established by the parties of GWB Trust, the CSL, and the FSA, agreements whtch\n      form the basis for your intervention, including your relationship to each of the\n      parties you deem to be interested J?arties to the matter at hand, mcluding explaining\n      why you believe yourself to have mterest in the Estate, and why you believe that\n      attorneys' fees belonging to Defendants were being deducted from your alleged\n      share of the Estate.\n             ANSWER: Intervenor objects to this interrogatory as outside the scope of\n             permissible discovery and overly broad. Interrogatories may be used to\n             ascertain basic legal and factual claims and defenses, but may not be used to\n             force a party to marshal evidence.\" See, Rule 197 ofthe Texas Rules of Civil\n             Procedure, at comment 1. Intervenor further objects that this interrogatory\n             states incorrect and false premises, and as such 1s incapable of being\n             answered. The trustee of the GBU Trust has never stated that it was not\n             bound by the Contract or the FSA.\n      INTERROGATORY NO.3: Provide calculations upon which you base your claim\n      JOSHUA UNGER, TRUSTEE'S RESPONSE TO DISCOVERY FROM KENNETH GIBBS                    Page 16\n\n\n\n\n479\n\f      that you are owed in excess of$1 million because of payments due you which were\n      reduced by the amount of attorneys' fees, when GWB Trust was not aware of your\n      alleged existence until November or December 2013 and had never incurred such\n      debt to you.\n\n             ANSWER: The Barcroft share of the Contract was 30% of the shares of the\n             inheritance received by Ken, candy and Howard. Ken, Candy and Howard\n             collectively received 75% of the entire estate; therefore, Pentex Foundation\n             owned 22.5% of the entire estate (75% X 30% = 22.5%). 2.46% of the\n             Pentex share was taken out at the estate level to pay John Skotnik the fees\n             Barcroft owed him, leaving 20.04% being owned by Pentex Foundation. For\n             the first 5 years of distribution, Pentex Foundation has only been receiving\n             10.02%. That means that Pentex Foundation should have received double\n             what it was paid by GWB Trust. That is over a million dollars. GBU Trust\n             now owns the rights to everything that Pentex Foundation previously owned,\n             including the payment of underpayment of distributions. The only attorney\n             fees that were supposed to reduce the Barcroft share of the Contract are those\n             paid to John Skotnik. See also the computation of damages submitted as\n             Plaintiff/Intervenor 00255-256.\n\n      INTERROGATORY NO. 4: Explain why you claim to be entitled to 30% of all\n      proceeds arising from any lawsmt involving Defendants, under the terms of the\n      Contract, when you deny being held to the terms of the Contract; and explain why\n      you request the Court to declare the Contract valid and enforceable if in fact, you\n      cannot be bound by the tenns of the Contract; and explain your reasoning for filing\n      the Plaintiffs and Intervener's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment in conjunction\n      with Pentex, revealing a lack of clarity as to which party actually holds interest in\n      GWB Trust.\n\n      ANSWER: Intervenor objects to this interrogatory as outside the scope of\n      permissible discovery and overly broad. Interrogatories may be used to ascertain\n      basic legal and factual claims and defenses, but may not be used to force a party to\n      marshal evidence.\" See, Rule 197 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, at\n      comment 1. Intervenor further objects that this interrogatory states incorrect,\n      argumentative, and false premises, and as such is incapable of being answered. The\n      trustee of the GBU Trust has never stated that it was not bound by the Contract or\n      the FSA.\n      INTERROGATORY NO.5: Explain your statement that you and Defendants have\n      a long history, when Candy and Ken deny knowing of your existence until late\n      2013; and\n             ANSWER: (Assuming that there should be a period after 2013), the \"long\n             history\" is with the predecessors, Albert Barcroft and Pentex Foundation; the\n             position that Intervenor now holds.\n\n      INTERROGATORY NO.6: Explain the reasoning behind aligning with Pentex in\n      its claim against Defendants while you yourself insist that you are entitled to the\n      JOSHUA UNGER, TRUSTEE'S RESPONSE TO DISCOVERY FROM KENNETH GIBBS                 Page 17\n\n\n\n                                                                                   EXh I'b't\n                                                                                          I\n                                                                                                 A_.

SUMMARY OF MOTION\n\n          1.      Although muddily drafted, it appears that the Motion seeks traditional summary\n\n  judgment pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 166a(b).        The Motion did not specify whether a\n\n  traditional or a no-evidence summary judgment is sought.\n\n          2.      Contrary to their mutual assertion, the facts presented in Pentex Foundation\n\n  (\"Pentex\") and GBU Friends and Associates Trust's (\"GBU Trust\") Motion are highly disputed.\n\n          3.      Although Pentex and GBU Trust are suing Howard Kirk Gibbs, the Motion\n\n  excluded Howard Kirk in its mention of the parties supposedly \"taking actions\" inconsistent\n\n  with the Contract for Sale of Land (\"the CSL\").        No clarifying point was made for this\n\n  omission.\n\n\n\n  KEN GIBBS'S AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S\n  AND INTERVENOR'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT                      CAUSENO. CV-14-41665\n  PENTEX FOUNDATION V. GIBBS, ET AL.                                                                          -1-\n\n495\n\f         4.      In large part, Pentex and GBU Trust based their Motion, including legal\n\n interpretation of various agreements, upon Admissions by Howard Kirk. On receipt of GBU\n\n Trust's Request for Admissions, Howard Kirk responded within fewer than five (5) hours,\n\n evidence of collusion among Plaintiff, Intervener, and Defendant. The preponderance of the\n\n purported facts in the Motion ignored Admissions from Ken and Candy in favor of Admissions\n\n from Howard Kirk, and relied very heavily on Howard Kirk's Admissions concerning his lay\n\n interpretation of provisions in the Family Settlement Agreement (\"the FSA\"). Pentex and GBU\n\n Trust's Motion ignored all Admissions from Ken and Candy which controverted Admissions\n\n from Howard Kirk.\n\n         5.      The Motion cited no statutes and no case law upon which Pentex and GBU Trust\n\n based their argument.\n\n         6.      Since the CSL, there have been subsequent dealings and subsequent agreements,\n\n including the FSA.\n\n         7.      As Movants for summary judgment, Pentex and GBU Trust bear the burden of\n\n proof of the facts argued.\n\n                                      II. UNDISPUTED FACTS.\n\n         8.      The number of undisputed facts is small indeed.\n\n         9.      Albert Barcroft was and is not licensed to practice law.\n\n         10.     Albert drafted the CSL, with the parties signing on May 10, 2005.\n\n         11.     The FSA was executed on or about September 5, 2008. See Exhibit A.\n\n         12.     GWB Family and Friends Trust (\"GWB Trust\") agreement was executed on\n\n November 7, 2008. See Exhibit B.\n\n\n KEN GIBBS'S AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S\n AND INTERVENOR'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n PENTEX FOUNDATION V. GIBBS, ET AL.\n\n\n496\n\f          13.      The issue of the CSL's validity was addressed most recently on August 20, 2014,\n\n  at a hearing in Tarrant County Probate Court No.2. Cause No. 2005-0000126-2-D, Walton and\n\n  Gibbs vs. Miller, et al. As was established at the hearing, the CSL was drafted in 2005 by\n\n  Albert, who has portrayed himself repeatedly to multiple parties as the Legal Representative of\n\n  Pentex and GBU Trust.\n\n          14.      Judge Ferchill of the Tarrant County Probate Court No.2 stated:\n\n                   [Albert] cannot enforce a contract that he participated in. He cannot\n                   get money for - or unjust enrichment for committing what is a\n                   criminal misdemeanor, at least, in Texas. p. 105\n\n                   [Albert] is practicing law without a license, and he cannot enforce a\n                   contract that brings money into his pocket for violating the law,\n                   period. p. 106\n\n                   (Emphasis added.)\n\n          See Exhibit C. (excerpts ofthe hearing.i\n\n          15.      Albert was a party to the CSL, as were Ken, Candy, and Howard Kirk Gibbs.\n\n  The CSL contained provisions which greatly benefited Albert. Albert advised Ken and Candy\n\n  that as he went to law school he was able to draft legal contracts. See Exhibit D.\n\n          16.      Ken and Candy have raised concerns numerous times over the validity of the\n\n  Contract for Sale of Land (\"CSL\"), including in the Motion to Show Authority, Motion for\n\n  Change of Venue, Original Answer, Affirmative Defenses, Original Counterclaim, and Rule 13\n\n  Motion for Sanctions, and the subsequent Amended Motion. 2 Ken and Candy observed that\n\n\n\n  1\n    Only excerpts of the hearing are provided, as the transcript, with exhibits, is over 200 pages.\n  2\n   Although the Original Answer observed that John Skotnik drafted the CSL, Ken and Candy amended the Answer,\n  stating that Albert drafted the CSL without authority and that there existed a question concerning its validity.\n\n\n  KEN GIBBS'S AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S\n  AND INTERVENOR'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT                                   CAUSENO. CV-14-41665\n  PENTEX FOUNDATION V. GIBBS, ET AL.\n\n\n497\n\f  they were not represented by counsel concerning the CSL. Discovery Requests from Ken to\n\n  Pentex and GBU Trust also contained queries about the enforceability of the CSL.\n\n                                              IV. LAW.\n\n          17.     As a general rule, an agreement simply to enter into negotiations for a contract\n\n  later does not create an enforceable contract. Scott v. Ingle Brothers Pacific, Inc., 489 S.W.2d\n\n  554 (Tex. 1972).\n\n          18.     \"Unconscionability\" has no precise legal definition, and it is to be determined on\n\n  a case-by-case basis. In general, \"unconscionability\" describes a contract that is unfair because\n\n  of its overall one-sidedness or the gross one-sidedness of its terms. Arthur's Garage, Inc. v.\n\n  Racal-Chubb SEC, Systems, Inc., 997 S.W.2d 803 (Tex. App. 1999).\n\n          19.     Unconscionable contracts are unenforceable under Texas law. Whether a\n\n  contract is unconscionable at the time it is formed is a question of law. Hoover Slovacek LLP v.\n\n  Walton, 206 S.W.3d 557, 562 (Tex. 2006).\n\n          20.     The practice of law includes \"preparing or negotiating, in whole or in part, a will,\n\n  trust, contract, conveyance, pleading, or other instruction to the extent such preparation or\n\n  negotiation is performed or offered explicitly or implicitly to provide legal advice or legal\n\n  representation.\" Tex. HS. Code Ann.§ 81.101.\n\n          21.     A person practicing law without a license commits a Class A misdemeanor. Tex.\n\n  Pen. Code§ 38.123.\n\n          22.     To prevail on a motion for traditional swnmary judgment, the movant must show\n\n  that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\n\n\n\n  KEN GIBBS'S AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S\n  AND INTERVENOR'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n  PENTEX FOUNDATION V.

EXHIBITS IN SUPPORT.\n\n          23.      In support of Ken and Candy's response to Pentex and GBU Trust's Motion for\n\n  Partial Summary Judgment, the following Exhibits are presented:\n\n                A. Family Settlement Agreement.\n\n                B. GWB Family and Friends Trust.\n\n                C. Excerpts from Reporter's Record of Motion Hearing. Cause No. 2005-0000126-\n                   2-D, Tarrant County Probate Court No.2, August 20, 2014.\n\n                D. Candy's Affidavit in Support of Response.\n\n                                       IV. SUMMATION OF ARGUMENT.\n\n          24.      Summary judgment approving Pentex and GBU Trust's Motion is not justified.\n\n  As movants for partial summary judgment, Pentex and GBU Trust bear the burden of proof of\n\n  material facts presented. Pentex and GBU Trust failed in this regard. They failed to provide\n\n  evidence of their claims, and they failed to provide statutes or case law supporting their claims.\n\n          25.      The facts alleged by Pentex and GBU Trust are not, contrary to their mutual\n\n  claim, uncontested. The dispute concerning the validity is well-documented, the facts pertaining\n\n  to the CSL have been reviewed by the Court, and the CSL has been determined null and void.\n\n          26.      It is an established fact that Albert drafted the CSL, and per law, Albert (a.k.a.\n\n  Pentex, a.k.a. GBU Trust) cannot enforce its terms, as he drafted and provided advice\n\n  concerning an agreement which profited him. Pursuant to public policy, Albert cannot enjoy\n\n  gains from the illegal activity of engaging in the practice oflaw without a license.\n\n\n\n  KEN GIBBS'S AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S\n  AND INTERVENOR'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT                          CAUSE NO. CV -14-41665\n  PENTEX FOUNDATION V. GIBBS, ET AL.\n\n\n499\n\f               27.     The evidence upon which Pentex and GBU Trust relied in the Motion is\n\n      primarily derived from Admissions from Howard Kirk, although Admissions to the contrary\n\n      from Ken and Candy are on record. Only in the rare instances of agreement among the parties\n\n      do Pentex and GBU Trust recognize Ken and Candy's Admissions. Pentex and GBU Trust\n\n      offered no explanation for their straightforward, unquestioning acceptance of Howard Kirk's\n\n      Admissions over Ken and Candy's, nor did Pentex and GBU Trust's Motion seek to resolve the\n\n      discrepancies, other than to promote Howard Kirk's Admissions.          Pentex and GBU Trust's\n\n      approach was simply to pretend that inconsistencies and disputes relative to the CSL do not\n\n      exist.\n\n                                           V.

LEE:     Yes, your Honor.\n\n12                          THE COURT:     Right?\n\n13                          MR.

GIBBS:     It's my understanding that an\n17   attorney helped Mr. Barcroft draw it up.                    That's what my\n\n18\n\n19                          THE COURT:     And is that -- that attorney's\n20   name on this agreement or anything connected?\n21                          MR. GIBBS:     I don't believe it's anywhere\n22   on the agreement.           But it was Mr. Barcroft's attorney,\n\n23   John Skotnik.           He had been his attorney for a very long\n\n24   time.

That's the best of my understanding.\n\n15                   THE COURT:      Barcroft, but Mr. Skotnik would\n16    have no privity of contract with these people.                  I mean\n17    -- and Mr. Barcroft,    if he did, in fact, practice law\n\n18    without a license, he cannot enforce a contract that he\n19    participated in.

That's the\n\n 8   first thing I think should be heard, is the motion to\n\n 9   show authority, and then the motion to transfer the\n\n10   Fannin county case to this Court.\n11                   But if you would like to hear the\n\n12   injunctive relief first, we do have a stipulation with\n\n13   one of the parties who's agreed to -- agreed to the\n\n14   injunctive relief for the -- for our petition, so we\n\n15   already have one person on board.           That would be\n\n16   Beverly Miller, the trustee of the GWB Trust.\n\n17                   MS. COX:     Your Honor, that's not entirely\n18   correct.   That is only as to the trust assets --\n19                   MS. LEE:     No, no --\n20                   THE COURT:     Yeah, I realize there was a\n21   request for injunctive relief on personal assets.                       Also,\n\n22   and the Court had already -- had already considered that\n\n23   that may be a little past its reach today.                 So ...\n\n24                   MS. COX:     And, your Honor, that would only\n\n25   be if the Court retained jurisdiction of the case.

I'll\n 8   try and stay right here.\n\n 9                   I do think jurisdiction is the first issue\n10   we should take up, because if you were to determine this\n\n11   does not have -- this Court does not have a\n\n12   jurisdiction, everything else becomes moot.

LEE)     So when Al Barcroft called you,\n21   on behalf of Pentex Foundation, did he give you any\n22   board minutes?\n\n23          A.   That's not really correct.

Yes, he did.\n\n 2        Q.    And what did you two discuss?\n\n 3        A.    We discussed the fact that he had some sort\n\n 4   alleged conflict of interest and he was familiar with my\n\n 5   work and asked me if I'd be willing to take on the case.\n\n 6        Q.    And so you said yes, obviously?\n\n 7        A.    Eventually, yes.\n\n 8        Q.    And then the next person you spoke to was\n\n 9   Al Barcroft?\n\n10        A.    That's correct.\n\n11        Q.    Did you ever speak to this Mario individual?\n\n12        A.    No.\n\n13        Q.

You -- get an e-mail from anybody?\n\n17        A.    That, I don't know.         There's been a lot of\n\n18   e-mails.\n19        Q.    So you're representing an entity, Pentex\n20   Foundation, correct?\n\n21        A.    Correct.\n\n22        Q.    Do you have board minutes?\n\n23        A.

I don't -- when\n\n24   a -- when a corporation hires me, I don't look for their\n\n25   board minutes.\n\n                               CRC for Wells Reporting\n 592                                817-524-6644\n                                                     e28bd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-\n\f                                                                    Page 14\n                     EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1        Q.   Do you know that that is the way that you are\n 2   hired by a corporation is through the board, and you do\n 3   not have those minutes?\n 4        A.   It may be the board, it may be the President of\n s   the company that has authority to do it, maybe the\n 6   company's representative.        There's lots of ways that\n 7   companies can hire lawyers.        They don't have to have a\n 8   board resolution to do that.\n 9        Q.   Actually, that's untrue.        You need to have\n10   board resolutions, if you're a corporation.              Are you\n11   aware of Panama law?\n12        A.   No.\n13        Q.   Are you aware that Panama law is almost\n14   identical to U.S. law concerning corporations?\n15        A.   No.\n16        Q.   Do you understand that they have a board?\n17        A.   No.\n18        Q.   Did you not understand that Pentex Foundation\n19   had a board?\n20        A.   I don't understand Panama law, no.\n21        Q.   No -- so you didn't realize that Pentex\n22   Foundation had a board?\n23        A.   No\n24        Q.   So you never received\n25        A.   Let me back up --\n\n 593\n\f                                                                      Page 15\n                       EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1                       THE COURT:     Give me a second.\n\n 2                       THE WITNESS:       I do believe there is a\n\n 3    board, I do believe there are board members.              How that\n\n 4    construct is done under Panama law, I do not know.\n\n 5         Q.    (BY MS. LEE)       Okay.      So is this the only\n 6    document that you have that shows authority that you're\n\n 7    here for Pentex Foundation?\n\n 8         A.    No.\n\n 9         Q.    Okay.     What other documents do you have?\n\n10         A.    Well, as I previously produced to you, I have\n\n11    the e-mail that I sent you on June 13th with the\n\n12    articles, I believe, from Panama.

It states it's an entity under the laws of\n\n 2    Panama.        If it's a corporation, or a foundation,        I'm not\n 3    sure.        I don't --\n\n 4            Q.    Right.      Okay.    So both of these documents, one\n\n 5    in Spanish one in English, only states it's an\n\n 6    incorporated entity?\n\n 7            A.    And that it's in existence.\n\n 8            Q.    Okay.     But, again, nothing showing me that you\n\n 9    had any authority to file a special appearance for\n\n10    Pentex Foundation, correct?\n\n11            A.    You got my fee agreement.\n\n12            Q.     So you have a fee agreement from a person who I\n13    don't know, who says that you can represent Pentex\n\n14    Foundation in this lawsuit, and you -- you just went\n\n15    with this?\n\n16            A.    Yeah, I just went with that.\n\n17            Q.    Nothing else?\n\n18            A.    Nothing else.        I don't usually challenge my\n19    clients when they want to hire me.\n20                          MS. LEE:     Okay.    Your Honor, I don't have\n21    any further questions, I would\n\n22                          THE COURT:     Would you like to continue to,\n\n23    say, testifying, as it were, whatever you want to tell\n24    the Court from the witness stand?\n25\n\n                                   CRC for Wells Reporting\n595                                     817-524-6644\n\f                                                                             Page 17\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING- July 31,2014\n\n 1                    THE COURT:     I guess what I was looking at\n\n 2   something earlier and it seemed to be that only the\n\n 3   president or the vice president or the secretary of the\n\n 4   so-called entity had authority to engage in litigation,\n\n 5   engage with counsel, am I -- did I misread?\n\n 6                    MS. LEE:     Your Honor\n\n 7                    MR. SMITH:     That may be what counsel\n\n B   represented.     I don't believe that to be the case.\n\n 9                    MS. LEE:     Your Honor, I've been practicing\n\n10   business law, tax law for many, many years, and\n\n11   when -- as an officer of the Court, I will tell you that\n\n12   you're required, when an entity decides to fire a -- to\n\n13   file a lawsuit, it is a board resolution.                So the board\n\n14   has to make the resolution to sue anyone.\n\n15                    There is no board minutes here.               And Panama\n\n16   1s concurrent.     It's not completely identical, but it is\n\n17   concurrent with the U.S. way of entities.               And so there\n\n18   should be board minutes, something showing me.\n19                    And he's been on notice since April that I\n\n20   needed something to show, including board minutes, and\n21   he, still today, is not producing anything.\n\n22                    THE COURT:     Would you like to answer that,\n\n23   sir?\n\n24                    MR. SMITH:     Well, number one, I would like\n\n25   the Court look at what I did produce.\n\n                             CRC for Wells Reporting\n 596                              817-524-6644\n                                                   e28bd4ed-9dff-4753-b322\n\f                                                                Page 18\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1                     The first response I had is, when I saw\n\n 2    this motion, I looked at Rule 12, because this is the\n\n 3    first time I've ever been challenged, in 30 years of\n\n 4    practicing law, to show that my client actually has\n 5    hired me --\n 6                     THE COURT:     Well, maybe the client has the\n\n 7    authority to hire you.        That's the issue, is it not?\n\n 8                     MR. SMITH:     I don't know that you can go\n\n 9    behind the engagement of the lawyer to challenge that\n10    basis, as an opponent.        I mean, it seems awkward.\n\n11                     What I was going to say was, when I looked\n12    at Rule 12 --\n\n13                     THE COURT:     The individual could\n\n14    just -- could be a rogue board member or an interloper,\n\n15    so to speak, or even stranger.        I mean, you don't -- you\n\n16    say you haven't met this person, right?\n17                     THE WITNESS:     Here's the reason I didn't,\n18    your Honor.     The motion was never sworn like it's\n19    suppose to be.     Rule 12 is like a sworn motion, so it's\n20    not proper to consider.        I didn't get a chance to say\n21    that earlier, but that was really my first response, is\n22    I didn't go pull up all these minutes, because I didn't\n23    have a sworn motion.\n\n24                     More to the point, the motion is really two\n\n25    parts.   It challenges the existence of Pentex, which            E hibit\n\n\n\n597\n\f                                                                Page 19\n                 EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   we -- that's the reason we sent those e-mails and sent\n 2   the supporting documents months ago, and then challenges\n 3   my authority.    That's why I sent her -- or had available\n 4   my fee agreement.\n 5                   I did not sit and compare the names on the\n 6   documents from Panama with the names of the individuals\n 7   that signed my fee agreement.        It may be the same.   I\n\n 8   probably need to compare that, if you think that would\n 9   answer the question.\n10                   MS. LEE:     No, your Honor, to go\n11   to -- concerning the -- the verification, this exact,\n12   almost identical, motion to show authority has been\n13   filed in Fannin county with a verification affidavit\n14   stating that he does not have authority.\n15                   MR. SMITH:     This isn't Fannin county.\n16                   MS. LEE:     If it was inadvertently not put\n17   on, if he's been on notice.\n18                   And I would also show for the record, as he\n19   stated erroneously, I've never seen the fee agreement.\n20   So he said he had e-mailed that to me, I never received\n21   it.\n22                   MR. SMITH:     I referenced I sent you\n23   the -- the incorporation documents and the certificate\n24   of authority that are exhibits two and three.        I did not\n25   send you the fee agreement.\n                                                                    Exhit it   8\n                            CRC for Wells Reporting\n 598                             817-524-6644\n\f                                                                 Page 20\n                 EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1                 MS. LEE:     Well, I have my clients who\n\n 2   signed the affidavit, who would be more than happy to\n\n 3   get on the stand to state exactly what the affidavit\n\n 4   provides.\n\n 5                 THE WITNESS:     That's not procedure.\n\n 6                 THE COURT:     So if I assume that you are\n\n 7   here representing Pentex Foundation only or Pentex\n 8   Royalty or is that one and the same?\n\n 9                 THE WITNESS:     Pentex Foundation.        I don't\n10   know who Pentex Royalty is.\n\n11                 THE COURT:     And whether or not we have\n12   service on Pentex Foundation, you are only here for a\n\n13   special appearance on behalf of Pentex Foundation.\n14                 THE WITNESS:     That is correct.\n\n15                 THE COURT:     That special appearance, I've\n\n16   seen, but for the most part is that that there's not\n17   sufficient ties?\n\n18                 THE WITNESS:     No, the special appearance is\n19   based upon the question of jurisdiction and the dominant\n20   jurisdiction of the Fannin County District Court --\n21                 THE COURT:     Because there is one agreement,\n22   as I recall, that had, in Fannin county, as a --\n23                 THE WITNESS:     Right.     The original\n24   agreement referenced venue in Fannin county.\n\n25                 THE COURT:     Right.     Because we\n\n                          CRC for Wells Reporting\n 599                           817-524-6644\n\f                                                                           Page 21\n                 EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   our management trusts when we do a bank here and we do a\n\n 2   trust for kids, we never know where they're going move\n 3   and so we tend to make the jurisdiction and venue in\n 4   Tarrant County, by my -- usually by my request.\n 5                 THE WITNESS:     And this doesn't address\n\n 6   jurisdiction, it just addresses venue.          My question on\n\n 7   jurisdiction is whether this Court has incident\n\n 8   jurisdiction to this case, because it's not out\n\n 9   of -- what it pertains to is assets that have already\n10   been distributed.\n\n11                 THE COURT:     I know.      That's what bothers me\n\n12   about this case as well.\n\n13                 THE WITNESS:     And that's really what I want\n14   to speak about --\n15                 THE COURT:     But we're not going to get into\n16   that right now.\n17                 MS. LEE:     Yeah --\n18                 THE WITNESS:      And with respect to the\n19   secondary component of the motion to Rule --\n20                 MS. LEE:     Again, your Honor, I would like\n21   to focus on the motion to show authority.\n22                 THE WITNESS:      That's what I'm talking\n23   about.\n\n24                 THE COURT:     Well, he said the Rule 12\n                                                                              Exhibt\n25   motion, the second part.\n\n                          CRC for Wells Reporting\n 600                            817-524-6644\n                                                e2Bbd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-\n\f                                                                             Page 22\n                      EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n1                      THE WITNESS:      The second part was whether\n\n 2     Pentex existed.     And I don't know if that's still an\n\n 3     issue or not\n\n4                      MS. LEE:      No, your Honor.\n\n 5                     THE WITNESS:       -- then I'll just rest.\n\n 6                     MS. LEE:      Yes, he has provided me the\n\n 7     documentation for that.\n\n 8                      THE COURT:     Just once again, and it will be\n 9     repeating yourself, but tell me, again, the\n10     scenario -- I remember the other attorney, is he from\n\n11     Sherman possibly --\n\n12                      THE WITNESS:      Bonham.\n\n13                      THE COURT:     Bonham.\n\n14                      MR. SMITH:     I'm from Sherman.\n15                      THE COURT:     I can't remember everything\n16     about every case, but I do try to retain -- okay.                     But\n\n17     now he's been here before.         How do you pronounce his\n\n18     name?\n19                      THE WITNESS:      Skotnik.\n20                      THE COURT:     Skotnik.      So he's the one that\n21     initially called you, initially recommended you or\n22     you're not sure?\n\n23                      THE WITNESS:      He called me because he knew\n\n24     he was -- or he was afraid he had a conflict of\n\n25     interest, and he voluntarily withdraw.              Called me and\n\n                               CRC for Wells Reporting\n     601                             817-524-6644\n                                                     e2Bbd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-14a0a6\n\f                                                                    Page 23\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1    asked if I'd be interested in the case, explained part\n\n 2    of the details of the case, and like most attorneys, I\n\n 3     said, if it will pay me, I'll do it.\n\n 4                      THE COURT:     A retainer is usually the next\n 5    thing --\n\n 6                      THE WITNESS:     It was, it was.     I didn't\n\n 7    enter an appearance until I had the retainer.            I do have\n 8    a case for you, your Honor --\n\n 9                      THE COURT:     It's a little disingenuous to\n10    not remember, isn't it -- I mean, you get that many\n11     $5,000 checks?\n\n12                      THE WITNESS:     I don't remember the names.\n13     I want to say one of them was Mr. Unger --\n\n14                      THE COURT:     You're under oath and you don't\n15    want to be -- commit perjury.\n\n16                      THE WITNESS:         it wasn't the name of the\n\n17     client.   I'd be more than happy to look and I'd be more\n\n18     than happy to supplement my answer, but I don't remember\n19     that\n20                      THE COURT:     So you received two\n21     different -- two different -- for a total retainer of\n22     $10,000, is that what I understood?\n\n23                      THE WITNESS:     Yes, sir.      I think I can\n\n24     explain this and maybe it will make a some sense.            The\n\n25     asset that Pentex had is assigned to a GBU Trust.           And\n                                                                   Page~~~\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n     602                           817-524-6644\n\f                                                                              Page 24\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1     think some beneficiaries of that trust are the ones that\n\n 2     actually paid the fees.     Because they're the ones with\n\n 3     the financial interest.\n\n 4                   And I want to say one was Mr. Unger.                     And I\n 5     just don't remember who the other check came from.                     It\n\n 6     could have been Mr. Barcroft.       I just don't know.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:     So Mr. Barcroft is the one who\n\n 8     mailed you the agreement paperwork?\n\n 9                   THE WITNESS:      I get it via e-mail.\n\n10                   THE COURT:     That's what you printed off and\n11    provided for opposing counsel?\n\n12                   THE WITNESS:      Yes, sir.       Your Honor, I\n\n13     found one case and it's the Patton Children's Trust case\n\n14     out of Amarillo.   It's not published, but it does talk\n\n15     specifically about Rule 12.       And I've got a single copy.\n\n16     I'm sorry, I didn't bring extras.\n17                   And says, typically, the response to a\n\n18     Rule 12 motion, an attorney satisfies his or her burden\n19     to establish the authority to prosecute or defend a suit\n20     through an affidavit from the client indicating the\n21     attorney was retained and/or through testimony of the\n22     attorney.\n\n23                   And that's all it says you have to do to\n\n24     satisfy the burden.

Was that case a corporation?\n\n 3                     THE WITNESS:     I think it was a trust.\n\n 4                     MS. LEE:     It's very different than a\n\n 5    corporation.\n\n 6                     THE WITNESS:     Well, it just says the\n 7    attorney has to give his testimony.               That's what I've\n\n 8    done.   And I'll submit that for the Court.\n\n 9                     THE COURT:     Additional questions, Ms. Lee?\n\n10                     MS. LEE:     No, your Honor.\n\n11                     THE COURT:     You may step down at this time.\n\n12                     THE WITNESS:     Thank you.\n\n13                     THE COURT:     It's a very interesting\n\n14    question posed, because usually what our motion                 we\n\n15    have motions to show authority all time in this Court,\n\n16    because it's probate court and often persons who are\n17    alleged to be incapacitated tend to show up with private\n18    attorneys or private attorneys show up and tend to claim\n19    they're representing the incapacitated person.               So those\n20    cases are one in which we have a threshold of showing\n21    that the person has at least the capacity to engage an\n\n22    attorney.\n\n23                     So while we are accustomed to Rule 12\n\n24    agreements, this is -- or Rule 12 objections or motions,\n\n25\n\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n     604                           817-524-6644\n\f                                                                            Page 26\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   more or less, in this case.\n\n 2                   So it's your motion, tell me why I\n\n 3   should -- why I should grant your motion, what proof he\n\n 4   hasn't supplied.     I mean, he has come under oath and\n 5   stated that he believes he's the attorney .\n\n 6                   . MS. LEE:   I know, your Honor\n\n 7                   THE COURT:     And he's gotten payment from\n 8   someone.\n\n 9                   MS. LEE:     But he didn't get it from Pentex\n10   Foundation, your Honor.       He got it from two individuals\n11   who have nothing to do, reportedly, with Pentex\n\n12   Foundation.    He hasn't met these -- he hasn't any of the\n\n13   people from Pentex Foundation, Incorporated.                 It's a\n\n14   corporation.     It's very different.\n\n15                    He's been on notice since April that we\n16   have questioned his authority.          He could have obtained a\n\n17   resolution from the board.        We specifically asked for\n18   that, and he provided us with just that it's a\n19   corporation, which does satisfy that it's a Panamanian\n20   corporation.\n21                    But still, he has no proof that he's\n22   been -- and it's exactly what you stated earlier, your\n\n23   Honor, how do I know that -- there are plenty of cases,\n\n24   I apologize I don't have them on me, where cases have\n\n25   been thrown out, where the board -- because a\n\n                             CRC for Wells Reporting\n 605                              817-524-6644\n                                                   e28bd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-14a0a6eel*\n\f                                                                                   Page 27\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   shareholder would say, I was at the board meetings, and\n\n 2   the board never resolved, ever, why I was there in order\n\n 3   to sue somebody.     And that case would get thrown out, as\n 4   not having authority -- as the attorney not having the\n 5   authority.\n 6                    I don't think he did his due diligence.\n\n 7   Again, he received two checks from two individuals,\n\n 8   which are not associated with Pentex Foundation.                          And\n\n 9   signed from a lady who he -- a gentleman who's he's\n10   never met, via e-mail.\n\n11                    THE COURT:    Doesn't sound very good when\n\n12   she says it.     But you, obviously, have a different\n\n13   version.\n\n14                    MR. SMITH:    I used to do insurance defense.\n\n15   Insurance companies paid me all the time.                   They weren't\n16   the client.     The client was the individual I was\n17   representing.\n\n18                    THE COURT:    But I suppose nobody challenged\n19   whether or not the insurance company existed or whether\n\n20   or not the proper route or road map was taken between\n21   the powers that be and your ultimate appearance in the\n\n22   courtroom.\n\n23                    MR. SMITH:    That is true.            I was never\n\n24   challenged.     No one would ever think to do that.\n\n                                                                                                            v1\n25                    THE COURT:     She has challenged, apparentlvL.                                        ~\n                                                                                          l:xmbt\n                                                                                                ,,..;r!f\"':• '•-,,,\n                             CRC for Wells Reporting                        Page          7/'                         \\\n 606                              817-524-6644\n                                                   e2 8bd4ed- 9df f -4 753 -b322 -14aOa6 ;,\n\f                                                                 Page 28\n                  EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31,2014\n\n1    from the beginning.\n\n2                   MR. SMITH:    Well, with an unsworn motion\n 3   not properly before the Court.        And so I brought what I\n4    had.   I did not get an authorization.          And the case that\n\n 5   I gave you says that the remedy is to give us more time.\n\n 6                  THE COURT:    Excuse me?\n\n 7                  MR. SMITH:     I believe the case that I gave\n 8   you, it's over there on the corner of the bench, I\n 9   believe they said the remedy is not to dismiss our\n10   position, but to give us more time to find an attorney\n11   or demonstrate authority.      So it seems like\n\n12                  MS. LEE:     He's been on notice since April.\n\n13   It's now July 31st.\n\n14                  THE COURT:     Well, he does have a point.         It\n15   is supposed to be a sworn motion.         That can be fatal.\n\n16                  MS. LEE:     Your Honor, if I can --\n\n17                  THE COURT:     Does it not say that in the --\n\n18                  MS. LEE:     No, he      he is accurate.     Oh,\n19   actually, your Honor, there is one.\n\n20                  MS. SMITH:     There's an affidavit --\n21                  MS. LEE:     There's an affidavit of counsel,\n22   myself, that I signed in support, stating that\n23   everything in here was true and accurate.

It is      -- it's on there.\n 6                  MR. SMITH:      The\n\n 7                  THE COURT:      The one filed on 7/7.\n\n 8                  MR.

It was\n 4   the foreign       incorporation documents for the Pentex\n 5   Foundation.    At the time I filed this motion, he had\n\n 6   only sent me the Spanish version.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:      Okay.\n\n 8                   MS.

Is that a fair statement?\n\n     5                      MS. LEE:     Yes, your Honor.\n\n     6                      THE COURT:     And you believe that you've\n\n     7     given him notice.     And I don't suppose you have those\n     8     e-mails here or anything\n     9                      MS. LEE:     No, your Honor.     But I would be\n    10     more than happy to supplement.          Yes, I have given him\n    11     ample notice.     And in the other motion\n\n    12                      THE COURT:     And even though he has never\n\n    13     had this happen before, you know, there's always a first\n\n    14     time for everything in law, and this is what you're\n    15     demanding?\n\n    16                      MS.

And you, by that\n    20     time, will have the cases in the law and then he will\n    21     be -- he will comply if that is what's required.\n    22                      MS. LEE:     We have waited four -- three\n\n    23     months to have this hearing.          We have waited many\n\n    24     months.   It's been cancelled three times.

They may have been my\n\n 3   own --\n\n 4                 MS. LEE:     No, two of them were other\n\n 5   individuals' fault.   No, they've never been -- No, never\n\n 6   been Mr. Scott -- I didn't mean to imply that, at all.\n\n 7   This has nothing to do with Mr. Scott.\n\n 8                 THE COURT:     Well, I'm sorry -- you know,\n\n 9   Ms. Lee, I'm just simply not prepared, I mean, I owe him\n\n10   a courtesy as a fellow member of the bar, just as I owe\n\n11   you, however I understand why you want more than he's\n\n12   prepared to provide today, so\n\n13                 MS. LEE:     Can --\n\n14                 THE COURT:      -- I have a choice of either,\n\n15   you know, overruling your motion and going forward, when\n\n16   in fact, you may be correct.        If he does not show the\n\n17   proof that's necessary, I would grant your motion.          But\n\n18   I can't do any of that today.\n19                 I guess we could hear his -- we could take\n\n20   testimony on his special exception or hear his argument\n21   on his plea and abatement or special appearance,\n\n22   conditioned upon the Court, ultimately, finding that he\n\n23   had the authority      the requisite authority to make it.\n\n24                 MS. LEE:     That is perfectly fine with me.\n\n25                 THE COURT:     And then if he -- if that      COlBXffibi   {3\n                           CRC for Wells Reporting\n 612                            817-524-6644\n\f                                                                                   Page 34\n                       EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n1     to pass, then we won't have to do the motion again.\n\n 2                       MS. LEE:      I -- I would prefer that.                   Is\n\n 3    that agreeable with you\n\n 4                       THE COURT:       You're prepared to argue that\n\n 5    today, are you not?\n\n 6                       MR. SMITH:       I am, sir.\n\n 7                       THE COURT:       Well, then let's go forward on\n\n 8    that basis, then.         The Court will take under advisement,\n 9    pending further testimony and exhibits, et cetera, as to\n\n10    whether or not Ms. Lee's motion to show authority should\n\n11    be granted.\n\n12                       And now as I told -- you know, we usually\n13    have somebody from the Florida who says they've never\n\n14    been to Texas and the long arm statute and all that, but\n15    your special appearance is a different kind of cat, so\n\n16    to speak, right?\n\n17                       MR. SMITH:       Yes, yes, sir.\n\n18                        THE COURT:      You want to tell me about your\n19    special appearance?\n20                       MR. SMITH:       Yes, sir.         And it really goes\n21    to the Court's jurisdiction.              And I'm certain this Court\n22    is for more educated on probate court jurisdiction than\n\n23    I am.     I come from a county with courts of general\n\n24    jurisdiction, so we have different sets of issues.                            So I\n\n25    had to research this and I have --\n     .____ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _E_x_h_ib__.i _/}~ .. ,,,,\n\n                                  CRC for Wells Reporting                   Page    3Y     of{                    ' t'~\\\n 613                                                                                        !:!§?                      ,~\\\n                                        817-524-6644                                        iOb                        ~~ 1\n                                                        e28bd4ed- 9dff-4753-b322-14a0a6eel 79'J                        J'!:i\n                                                                                            ·,\\~1;                     /~':/\n                                                                                                     ·l,s~(j'· ':(; \"~ ~~\n\f                                                                     Page 35\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1                   THE COURT:      Well, it changes every\n\n 2   legislative session.       So you may know more about it than\n\n 3   I.\n 4                   MR. SMITH:      My analysis starts with the\n 5   SWEPI case.     I'm not sure        are you familiar with that\n\n 6   or not?\n\n 7                   THE COURT:      I am, indeed.\n\n 8                   MR. SMITH:      Okay.        And what that tells us\n 9   and teaches us -- I have a copy, if you like, or I can\n10   give it to counsel.\n11                   MS. LEE:      Your Honor, I'm -- I'm\n\n12                   THE COURT:      Is this more on your motion to\n\n13   transfer or your special appearance?\n14                   MR. SMITH:      It goes to jurisdiction, which\n15   is the foundation of the special appearance.              The\n16   jurisdictional question is which court has dominant\n\n17   jurisdiction.     And if this Court case doesn't have\n\n18   exclusive probate jurisdiction, then I'm going to argue\n19   that Fannin county has dominant jurisdiction, by virtue\n20   of being filed first.       That's why I'm going to SWEPI\n21   first.\n22                    THE COURT:     But you're arguing not a\n\n23   special appearance before the Court, aren't you arguing\n24   the main issue of transfer?\n\n25                    MR.

Ms. Lee, I'm going\n\n23    to go ahead and, again, I'm to go -- we're going to go\n\n24    ahead and hear this.

Thank you, your Honor.\n\n 9                     THE COURT:     Because I'm really\n\n10    concerned -- here's the thing that bothers me.            It seems\n11    like assets were distributed from an estate, and the\n\n12    people, for better or worse, made a bed they don't like\n13    lying in.\n\n14                     MS. LEE:     Your Honor, it's very different\n15    than that.    It's --\n\n16                     THE COURT:     And so it really may not have\n17    anything to do with this Court, at all.\n18                     MS. LEE:     I respectfully disagree.      And --\n19                     THE COURT:     All right.   Now,\n20    notwithstanding the trustee and alleged actions of the\n21    trustee are going to be the -- the petition that I\n22    mentioned originally, that's our trial petition that\n23    we're going to go forward on, come hell or high water.\n\n24                     MS. LEE:     Yes, your Honor.      But I'm talking\n\n25    about a case in Fannin county.         And I think the           Exhibit   13\n616\n\f                                                                  Page 38\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n1     big -- the big thing that's up for discussion here is\n\n 2    they believe these two cases are one and the same.\n\n 3                   The current case that's in this\n\n 4    jurisdiction, that you said, come hell or high water,\n\n 5    we're going to move forward, and the case in Fannin\n\n 6    county.   They aren't the same, at all.\n\n 7                   My first -- my two clients, Ken and Candy,\n\n 8    they have asked for this Court to transfer into the\n\n 9    estate of Bert Gibbs, this case.           Ken and Candy are two\n\n10    of the four heirs of the estate of Bert Gibbs.           Bert\n\n11    Gibbs had four heirs.     Howard Kirk, who's the gentleman\n\n12    over there, he's number three.\n\n13                   These three individuals went to bed with\n\n14    Al Barcroft, AKA Pentex Foundation, and signed a\n\n15    contract, which, by the way, your Honor, Al Barcroft\n\n16    drafted the contract on his own accord, on his own\n\n17    behalf, and inside the jurisdiction in Fannin county.\n\n18                   THE COURT:     And it appears he was\n19    practicing law without a license.\n\n20                   MS. LEE:     Yes, your Honor.       And pursuant to\n\n21    the Texas Estate Code 34.001, you have the authority\n\n22    that you may, not required, but you may transfer to your\n\n23    Court from a district court, and that's where that court\n\n24    is, any cause of action related to probate proceedings\n\n25    pending in 'another court or cause of action in which tEwtibit        J3\n                            CRC for Wells Reporting\n617                               817-524-6644\n\f                                                                   Page 39\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   personal representative of the estate pending in this\n\n 2   Court is a party.    And you can consolidate these cases.\n\n 3                   THE COURT:     True.\n\n 4                   MS. LEE:     Well.     Okay.     What happened is\n\n 5   when this lawsuit was filed, it was filed specifically\n\n 6   stating that it was for Pentex Foundation not getting\n\n 7   attorney fees that it was entitled to from -- from --\n\n 8   from the estate of Bert Gibbs.\n\n 9                   Your Honor, you have to keep in mind, even\n\n10   though it does look like these are assets that have been\n\n11   transferred out of the estate, there are assets that\n\n12   aren't transferred out of the estate.             There currently\n\n13   is a $6.1 million offer on a piece of property, to pay\n\n14   in full, or a $8.5 million installment agreement over\n\n15   the next five years, that will come to the estate of\n\n16   Bert Gibbs.\n\n17                   There is a lot of money out there.           My\n\n18   clients -- my two clients own 25 percent of the estate.\n19   So if they own 25 percent, they are potentially going to\n20   get $2 million.     Al Barcroft owns a percentage and\n21   Howard Kirk Gibbs also owns --he owns 12.5 percent.                 So\n\n22   we have a lot of assets for the estate of Bert Gibbs.\n\n23                   And we filed an amended answer in the\n\n24   Fannin county case, because what they\n25   allege -- and       what they allege is exactly what\n\n                            CRC for Wells Reporting\n 618                              817-524-6644\n\f                                                                  Page 40\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   Mr. Smith states, which is it's attorney fees.

Of 85, over 20 only included Ken as\n\n 4   executor.\n\n 5                    So when I objected, and said I'm\n\n 6   not -- this is for harassment purposes only, Ken, as the\n\n 7   executor of the estate, is absolutely irrelevant.            I\n\n 8   have an e-mail June 26th from Mr. Smith that states that\n\n 9   the attorney fees\n\n10                    MR. SMITH:    Your Honor, I'm afraid I have\n\n11   to object.    And that's why I was going to tell you about\n\n12   the SWEPI case.     You determine jurisdiction based on the\n\n13   pleadings.    We're getting into a lot of ancillary stuff\n\n14   here, that are not relevant to the pleadings on file ,\n\n15   so I would object to her introducing --\n\n16                    THE COURT:     I'm going to overrule the\n\n17   objection for now.\n\n18                    MS. LEE:     So he says requests 68 and 69 are\n19   the core issues of our case in Fannin county, our core\n\n20   issues.     68, subsequent to the execution of the family\n\n21   settlement agreement, Ken, as executor, has used funds\n\n22   for the estate of Bert Gibbs to pay attorney fees that\n\n23   were owed by Candy.\n\n24                    69, subsequent to the execution of the\n\n25\n\n                             CRC for Wells Reporting\n 619                              817-524-6644\n\f                                                                    Page 41\n                     EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1    funds for the -- from the estate of Bert Gibbs,\n\n 2    deceased, to pay attorney fees that were owed to Ken.\n\n 3                    We have pulled in -- you know,          it's very\n\n 4    difficult, your Honor, that my client is Ken,\n\n 5    individually, and as the independent administrator of\n\n 6    the estate.     When we filed our supplemented answer, we\n\n 7    stated that they have a defect in legal capacity.             They\n\n 8    have admitted, in these documents and other documents,\n\n 9    that it is at the core, over 20 questions which\n\n10    Mr. Smith -- Pentex Foundation has already filed a\n\n11    motion to compel stating that they wanted -- that those\n\n12    were paramount issues concerning his fiduciary duty as\n\n13    the trustee.\n\n14                     His conditions of the home place for\n\n15    self-dealing.     What does that have to do with a\n\n16    contract -- what does my client, Ken, have to do -- as\n\n17    independent administrator, have to do with the contract\n\n18    that they're suing for in Fannin county?          They're suing\n19    the wrong individual.\n\n20                     Ultimately, Ken -- Ken, as executor of this\n21    estate, is going to be pulled in.\n\n22                     THE COURT:     And a resident of Tarrant\n\n23    County?\n\n24                     MS. LEE:     Yes, your Honor, a resident\n\n25    Tarrant County.     So is Howard Kirk Gibbs.                        Exhibt ~\n\n\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n620                                 817-524-6644\n\f                                                                             Page 42\n                     EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1                    THE COURT:      Okay.\n\n 2                    MS. LEE:      So, your Honor, this is what I've\n\n 3   been able to determine\n\n 4                    THE COURT:      But he's being sued in his\n\n 5    capacity as an executor\n\n 6                    MS. LEE:      No, your Honor.        Right now, he's\n\n 7    being sued as an individual, because there's a family\n 8    settlement agreement that was filed in this Court in\n 9    2008.   And, specifically, it states that the four\n\n10    players, all four, Al Barcroft, Howard Kirk, Ken and\n\n11    Candy, if they sue the executor, sue the estate in any\n\n12    capacity, they have a potential for forfeiting all their\n13    inheritance.\n\n14                     THE COURT:     So it's kind like an in\n15    terrorem clause in a will?\n\n16                     MS. LEE:     Yes, that's exactly -- so they\n\n17    didn't want to sue Ken\n\n18                     THE COURT:     In his capacity as executor.\n19                     MS. LEE:     As executor.        But as Mr. Smith\n20    states in his e-mail, core issue goes to how the\n21    attorney fees were distributed.\n\n22                     That's exactly -- Pentex Foundation is\n\n23    suing my clients, stating that the attorney fees --\n\n24                     THE COURT:     They can't -- individually, he\n\n25    has no --\n                                                                                Exhibit   /3\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n621                                 817-524-6644                                   1\n\n                                                    e2Bbd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-14a0a6e~\n                                                                                   \\\n\f                                                                     Page 43\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1                   MS. LEE:     Exactly\n\n 2                   THE COURT:     -- he has no responsibility for\n\n 3   attorneys fees.\n\n 4                   MS. LEE:     Exactly.    We have an affidavit\n 5   that we have attached, saying you're suing me in the\n 6   wrong capacity.     So that lawsuit is going --\n\n 7                   THE COURT:     That's something you\n\n 8   should argue up there, is it not, that he's suing in the\n\n 9   wrong capacity?\n\n10                   MS. LEE:     We have filed that, your Honor,\n11   but we're trying to -- judicial economy.         With this case\n12     -- as you've already stated,     this case -- the estate of\n13   Bert Gibbs has been going on since 2005.\n\n14                   If this installment agreement gets signed\n15   for the sale of the property, this case will stay open\n\n16   until 2020, and I'm sorry to tell you that.            It's a\n17   five-year installment agreement to sell a big piece of\n18   property.\n19                   THE COURT:     But it's independent\n20   administration --\n21                   MS. LEE:     Yes --\n\n22                   THE COURT:         so I don't really have any\n23   say so over who buys what.\n\n24                   MS. LEE:     Exactly, your Honor.       But it's\n\n25   still in this Court, so this Court is still going to                Exhi it   iJ\n                            CRC for Wells Reporting\n 622                             817-524-6644\n\f                                                                  Page 44\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   hear disputes.     It's not the first time these\n\n2    individuals have had disputes, it's probably not going\n\n 3   to be the last.\n\n 4                    THE COURT:     They have a settlement\n\n 5   agreement they filed with this Court, if they have\n 6   another dispute.\n\n 7                    MS. LEE:     Exactly, your Honor, and we are\n\n 8   pursuing that on one avenue.          But we -- with judicial\n\n 9   economy, you know, this Court is allowed to hear cases\n\n10   or transfer a case over, if this considers probate\n\n11   proceedings.     And that case specifically concerns\n\n12   probate proceedings concerning the administration of the\n13   estate of Bert Gibbs.\n\n14                    THE COURT:     Not if he's been filed\n\n15   incorrectly against him.\n\n16                    MS. LEE:     Correct, your Honor.      But if we\n17   file that over there and do a motion to dismiss, which\n18   we've already filed, we've got to go to Fannin county,\n19   hear all that, have it all done.            It's going to cost a\n20   lot of money\n21                    THE COURT:     Right.\n\n22                    MS.   LEE:   -- how much money my clients have\n\n23   paid so far,    just to get to this phase          --\n24                    THE COURT:     Right.\n\n25                    MS.   LEE:   -- so all that money to have\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n 623                               817-524-6644\n\f                                                                     Page 45\n                     EXCERPT MOTION HEARING • July 31, 2014\n\n 1    re-file over in this county, because I can assure you,\n\n2     they will re-file.      So why not have it moved here,\n 3    switch out the players, and move forward with the\n\n 4    lawsuit.\n\n 5                     They're sitting right here, you can ask\n\n 6    them.    They're not going to drop the lawsuit.         I've\n 7    tried to settle with them.        They're not going to drop\n 8    it.     But we can do all that, but we're going to be back\n 9    here in January, six months later, fighting -- having\n\n10    the exact same petition that they filed and Ken and\n\n11    Candy's name, individually, is going to be x-ed out and\n\n12    the estate of Bert Gibbs is going to be in there.\n\n13                     THE COURT:     But as I was telling your\n\n14    opposing counsel here, you know, actually the first case\n\n15    under SB is out of this court.          It's called Lagrone v.\n\n16    Henry.     The very first one ever reported, and it had to\n\n17    do with a trust that -- the trustee was in -- up there\n\n18    in the panhandle and our beneficiary was down here.\n19                     Be that as it may, that was the first\n20    reported case.     And ever since that case, the\n21    legislature and the Supreme Court and other courts have\n22    made SA and SB decisions.        SB -- it's a new Estates Code\n\n23    decision, but have made these decisions.          Every\n\n24    legislature comes in and changes it and the Supreme\n\n25    Court changes it and it gets really complicated\n\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n     624                            817-524-6644\n\f                                                                 Page 46\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n1      whether or not the court -- and the one that you're\n\n2      speaking of, Counsel, where they drug in an entire\n\n 3     hospital staff and everything all the way down to Harris\n\n 4     County to have a trial, was that -- that was one of the\n\n 5     abuses of this consolidation.\n\n 6                    One of the ones that caused one of the more\n\n 7     recent restrictions on these transfers was where\n\n 8     somebody went down the Houston and got a guardianship,\n\n 9     and then sued the doctor and the hospital in Midland for\n\n10     causing damages.   And the whole hospital and everybody,\n\n11     the lawyers, and all had to move down to Harris County\n\n12     for trial and that's one of the last ones where the\n\n13     legislature said enough is enough.\n\n14                    So I'm very, let's say, proactive in\n\n15     consolidating cases from down the street, from my\n\n16     sisters and brethren who are in district courts and we\n\n17     have something that's clearly linked to the estate.         In\n\n18     fact, in 30 years, I've only had one of those ever\n19     challenged by the judge, himself.\n\n20                    But be that as it may, when we start\n\n21     dragging stuff across county lines, the Court is more\n\n22     reluctant.   I know you also read the cases that say it's\n\n23     entirely my discretion if I choose not to do it.\n\n24     There's no appeal from choosing not to do it.         You can\n\n25     certainly appeal me choosing to do it wrongly.

LEE:      Right.    But for judicial economy,\n\n 6    your Honor -- and it would be, bring the case over here,\n\n 7    and we could -- we don't have to start anew.          This has\n\n 8    been going on since, basically, November of last year,\n 9    not in your court, but with --\n10                   THE COURT:     But that's nothing for\n\n11    litigation, as you well know.\n\n12                   MS. LEE:     I know.    But there's other issues\n\n13    as well.   Pentex Foundation, which I have not mentioned\n\n14    yet, has sent demand letters to all the -- to the\n\n15    estates and to the attorney, for the permanent guardian\n\n16    of the decedent's wife, demanding that any more proceeds\n\n17    from the estate be sent to them directly, instead of\n\n18    what the contract states, which is to the GWB -- I mean\n19    the --\n20                   THE COURT:     Is that why people do\n21    interpleaders and put money in registry of the Court?\n22                   MS. LEE:     That would be great, but I don't\n\n23    know if people are going to do that.\n\n24                   THE COURT:     That's their issue, I guess.\n\n25                   MS.

That's exactly what\n\n10     the lawsuit is.     Through the estate of Bert Gibbs, this\n11     estate, in this Court.        They're suing my clients --\n\n12                      THE COURT:     But the estate is not a party.\n13                      MS. LEE:     Correct.

If you look at their\n\n14    pleadings, there's not a hint that the estate is\n15    involved in this.      It is involved a GWB Trust, which was\n\n16    an entity created\n17                     THE COURT:    To receive from the estate.\n\n18                     MR.

On page five of that\n21    case, I know I didn't give you a copy, but the Court\n\n22                     THE COURT:     I read SWEPI, I just don't\n\n23    remember the -- I mean, everybody -- it's referred to a\n\n24    lot, that and Huie v. DeShazo, SWEPI, there's a bunch of\n\n25    them, there's a number of them.

SMITH:      It was a mandamus case out of\n\n 2    the Supreme Court.      And what they found was the interest\n\n 3    had passed to the decedents.          And they said the fact no\n\n 4    partnership property or partnership interests are\n\n s    currently held by the estate also distinguishes it from\n 6    prior authority.      Here's the case, your Honor.\n\n 7                      So the first question is, does this, in a\n 8     jurisdictional analysis, looking at their pleading,\n 9    which they conceded doesn't involve the estate, is the\n\n10    controlling issue settlement petitioner distribution of\n\n11    an estate?      No, it's not, because that's already\n12    happened.\n\n13                      And so if that is the case, this Court does\n\n14    not have exclusive jurisdiction.              That's the teaching of\n\n15    SWEPI.    And SWEPI was cited a little bit later, but I\n16    don't know if I can pronounce it right, Puig, is the\n\n17    Court familiar with this case?\n\n18                      THE COURT:     It doesn't ring a bell, right\n19     this minute.\n20                      MR. SMITH:     Okay.        And there's another\n21     Supreme Court case a couple of years back and they cited\n\n22     SWEPI.   And what they said was, what you then do, if you\n23     don't have exclusive jurisdiction, you do the dominant\n\n24     jurisdiction analysis.        And that's where we believe\n\n25\n\n                               CRC for Wells Reporting\n     632                             817-524-6644\n\f                                                                              Page 54\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING • July 31, 2014\n\n 1     has now got dominant jurisdiction over the proceedings.\n\n 2                     And even though the issues are different,\n\n 3     the guide for this Court is whether parties could be\n\n 4     joined and, if feasible, under the compulsory\n\n 5     counterclaim.\n\n 6                     In other words, if you could add the\n\n 7     parties and make it a complete proceeding, then the\n\n 8     first filed suit is the one that's dominant.\n\n 9                     And I don't know mean to insult the Court,\n\n10     but I got a Fort Worth case out of 1995 Dallas Fire\n\n11     Insurance versus Davis, and what it tells -- what its\n\n12     holding is, is that when the principle of dominant\n\n13     jurisdiction applies, the trial court in the second\n\n14     action has no discretion to refuse to abate, and the\n\n15     first court has no discretion to abate the suit to the\n\n16     second court.\n\n17                     So it sounds mandatory, to me, that if this\n\n18     Court doesn't have exclusive jurisdiction, if it•s got\n19     concurrent jurisdiction, and that's arguably what\n\n20     they're saying by virtue of 34.001, we then lead to our\n21     dominant jurisdiction analysis.           And under the cases\n\n22     we've given you, you have to abate this case, in its\n\n23     entirety, to the Fannin county proceedings.\n\n24                     That's the position of Pentex Foundation.\n\n25     And I can go into some of the facts, but\n\n                             CRC for Wells Reporting\n     633                          817-524-6644                                         \\\n                                                    e2Bbd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-14a0a6eel79~ •.\n\f                                                                        Page 55\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING        ~   July 31, 2014\n\n 1   read the pleading, which you're supposed to do, that's\n\n 2   all you do.

The one   -- the last one he spoke about,\n10   the Puig, it talks about comparing county courts of law\n\n11   with probate courts.

It's a contract --\n\n14                     THE COURT:     But the estate is not party in\n\n15    Fannin county.\n\n16                     MS.

And to continue my lecture, I think thing\n\n4     there are 18 of us now, in Texas.\n\n 5                      But be that as it may, judicial economy is\n\n 6    one of the -- a driving force, but it's not the\n\n 7    only-- it's not the only consideration.\n\n 8                       So I'm going to make a ruling that I'm\n\n 9    going to deny the transfer of anything, without\n\n10    prejudice, at this point in time.\n\n11                      As far as your motion your show authority,\n\n12    I think you've been put on notice, you ever come back to\n\n13    this Court, you're going to need to comply or going to\n\n14    need show in more detail why you don't need to comply\n\n15    with more detail and strict predicate to your -- to your\n\n16    hiring.

Accordingly, please call Tina Clay for\n                a pre-trial hearing and trial date in which avoids the last week of December.\n                This paragraph is not to be interpreted as having any impact on the scheduling of\n                restraining orders, injunctive relief, and other time sensitive matters, if any.\n\n                Finally, this Court has not ordered mediation in, I believe, three cases in\n\n\n       642                                                              1\n\fFilters Used:                                                                                            Date Printed: 9/26/2014\n1 Tagged   Record                                        Email Report                                    Time Printed: 12:45PM\n                                                                                                             Printed By: LAURA\n                                                                Form Format\n\n\n\n                over 30 years. I sincerely doubt yours will be the fourth. Accordingly, note that\n                the scheduling order gives you a date by which the parties will pick a mediator,\n                mediate, and report back to the Court. If this date is not met, the Court will take\n                these actions on your behalf.\n\n                       Please call me if you have any questions,\n\n                       Lin Morrisett,\n                       Associate Judge,\n                       Probate Court #2,\n                       Tarrant County\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        2                             Page\n        643\n\fTexas Comptroller of Public Accounts- Taxable Entity Search Results                                Page 1 of 1\n\n\n\n\n             '\n\n\n\n\n       *\n         '                                                                    Taxable Entity Search\n                 '\n\n\n\n\n                              Business Name Pentex Foundation was not found.\n\n                   You may also call the Business Information Line at 1-800-252-1386.\n             Should you require assistance concerning the taxable entity information presented,\n                                  please contact tax.help@cpa.state.tx.us.\n\n\n   texas.gov         Statewide Search from the Texas State Library   State Link Policy    Texas Homeland\n                                                   Security\n          Susan Combs, Texas Comptroller • Window on State Government • Contact Us\n   Privacy and Security Policy Accessibility Policy Link Policy Public Information Act Compact\n                                             with Texans\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 Exhibit (\n\n                                                                                   Page      I\n   644\nhttps://mycpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/servlet/cpa.app.coa.CoaSearch?Search_Nm=Pentex+Fou...\n\fTexas Comptroller of Public Accounts- Taxable Entity Search Results                               Page 1 of 1\n\n\n\n\n  f) \\X'indow on State Gon:rnrncnt\n\n                                                                             Taxable Entity Search\n\n\n                         Business Name Pentex Royalty Trust was not found.\n\n                 You may also call the Business Information Line at 1-800-252-1386.\n           Should you require assistance concerning the taxable entity information presented,\n                                please contact tax.help!(i:;cpa.state .tx. us.\n\n\n   texas.gov    Statewide Search from the Texas State Library       State Link Policy   Texas Homeland\n                                                 Security\n          Susan Combs, Texas Comptroller • Window on State Government • Contact Us\n   Privacy and Security Policy Accessibility Policy   Link Policy Public Information Act Compact\n                                             with Texans\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  Exhibit   L\n                                                                                    Page    ;?\n    645\nhttps://mycpa. cpa. state. tx. us/coa!servletlcpa.app.coa.

Movant specially appears is not voluntarily appearing for purposes of questioning or\n       examination, rather he is appearing out of deference to this Court to present this Motion.\n\n    3. Movant further avers that he is not a party to this cause and is not current counsel for any party\n       herein, he previously represented the plaintiff in this cause, thus any information or testimony\n       sought would be protected by attorney client privilege. TRE 503.\n\n     4. Movant further avers that he is barred by the Rules of the State Bar of Texas from disclosing\n        privileged attorney client information.\n\n     5. Movant avers that TRCP 12 by its language envisions only the current counsel of record as\n        \"challenged attorney\" for a party to be subject of a Motion to Show Authority.\n\n     6. Movant avers that TRCP 12 by its language mandates that a Motion to Show Authority must be\n        sworn and served upon the \"challenged attorney\" (i.e. counsel of record) at least 10 days before\n        the hearing.\n\n     7. Movant avers that there is not a properly sworn motion under TRCP 12 that has been on file for\n        10 days prior to the hearing before this Court referenced herein, therefore Movant should not be\n        required to appear and testify.\n\n\n\n    652\n\f8. Movant avers that hearings on a properly filed TRCP 12 motion would be limited to exactly\n   what the rule covers, that is the attorney's authority to act on behalf of the client, and nothing\n   else.\n\n9. Movant avers that there is no endorsement of or by whoever served the subpoena. 1RCP 16\n\n10. Movant avers that there is no return on the subpoena showing who served the subpoena and\n    whether that person was authorized to serve under TRCP 103 or 106(a)(2).\n\n11. Movant avers that there is no proper proof of service on file with the Court. TRCP 176.5(b)\n\n12. Movant avers that he was not provided a witness fee at the time of purported service and the\n    failure to provide the fee renders the service and subpoena void. CPRC 22.001; 1RCP 176.5(a);\n    DM -0342\n\n13. Movant avers that the subpoena referenced herein is a discovery subpoena.\n\n14. Movant avers that he is not aware of any court order for him to appear or produce discovery.\n\n15. Movant objects to the subpoena and further requests that the court quash the subpoena impose\n    the limitations, restrictions, and modifications to the subpoena as sought herein, because the\n    subpoena is improper or unreasonable and oppressive and compliance would result in serious\n    and irreparable harm to movant.\n\n 16. The testimony sought and the documents requested in the subpoena are not relevant to the\n     issues in this action and are protected from compulsory disclosure by the work product and\n     attorney client privilege and is not governed by any exceptions therein. TRE 503.\n\n         WHEREFORE, movant requests that this Court hear this motion and make an order\n quashing the subpoena and awarding movant the reasonable costs of this motion, including\n attorney's fees, together with other relief as the Court may find appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nJoh Skotnik, sbn 18475150\nP.

Venue is mandatory in Fannin County, Texas, as the case arises from\n\n a contract involving a major transaction. This year the Supreme Court reaffirmed\n\n the application of these rules in In Re Fisher, 433 S.W.3d 523 (Tex. 2014),\n\n making it very clear that the Court has no discretion to transfer venue. Mandamus\n\n relief is available, but movants would prefer to request this Court to reconsider its\n\n\n\n\n MOTION TO RECONSIDER ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE ... PAGE I\n\n\n\n\n660\n\f ruling first. 1\n\n                                 FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n        2.         This case concerns and arises from contract entered into between the\n\n defendants and the predecessor in interest to Plaintiff and Intervenor. 2 The\n\n Contract itself, at paragraph 4 ofthe contract references a buyout and liquidated\n\n damages provision of $5,000,000, as follows:\n\n        It is understood and agreed that Gibbs may cancel or nullify this\n        contract only under the following conditions: a) If Gibbs pays over to\n        Barcroft the sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00 US) in full, in\n        addition to any money received prior to said one time payment, as\n        liquidated damages and full settlement of all consideration on Gibbs\n        part.\n\n Contract ,-r 4 (emphasis original). The present dispute involves allegations that in\n\n excess of a million dollars were not distributed pursuant to the terms of the\n\n Contract.

Contractual venue provisions are mandatory and enforceable. Section\n\n 15.020 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code applies to a \"major\n\n transaction,\" which is defined as a transaction evidenced by a written agreement\n\n and which involves $1 million or more:\n\n         (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an action arising\n        from a major transaction may not be brought in a county if:\n\n                (1) the party bringing the action has agreed in writing\n                that an action arising from the transaction may not be\n                brought in that county, and the action may be brought in\n                another county of this state or in another jurisdiction; or\n\n                (2) the party bringing the action has agreed in writing\n                that an action arising from the transaction must be\n                brought in another county of this state or in another\n                jurisdiction, and the action may be brought in that other\n                county, under this section or otherwise, or in that other\n                jurisdiction.\n\n TEX. CIV. PRAC.     & REM. CODE§ 15.020. It is the firm and well-established policy\n\n in this State to give force and effect to forum selection clauses:\n\n        In general, forum-selection clauses should be given full effect, and\n        subjecting a party to trial in a forum other than the contractually\n        chosen one amounts to \"'clear harassment' ... injecting inefficiency\n        by enabling forum-shopping, wasting judicial resources, delaying\n        adjudication on the merits, and skewing settlement dynamics .... \"\n\n In re AutoNation, 228 S.W.3d 663, at 667-68 (Tex. 2006).\n\n\n\n MOTION TO RECONSIDER ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE ... PAGE 4\n\n\n\n\n663\n\f        6.      This is a major transaction as defined by law. A \"major transaction\"\n\n is a transaction evidenced by a written agreement under which a person pays or\n\n receives, or is obligated to pay or entitled to receive, consideration with an\n\n aggregate stated value equal to or greater than one million. Accordingly, the\n\n Contract constitutes a \"major transaction\" for purposes of section 15.020 because\n\n it expressly provides- in paragraph 4- for the payment of \"consideration with an\n\n aggregate stated value\" of more than $ 1 million. Although movants assert that\n\n their damages directly relate to the Contract, associated claims trigger the\n\n mandatory venue if they \"arise\" from a major transaction.\n\n        We concluded that the forum selection clause itself applied more\n        broadly than to mere sales transactions because it applied to \"any\n        dispute arising out or' the agreement and the trial court erred in\n        refusing to enforce the forum selection clause.\n\n Fisher, 433 S. W.3d at 530, citing Lisa Laser, 310 S. W.3d 880, 887 (Tex. 201 0).\n\n                                          NO FINDINGS\n\n        7.      Finally, the Defendants only requested that venue be changed\n\n pursuant to TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE§ 15.002. Although it is clear that\n\n mandatory venue provisions trump permissive ones, there is a want of required\n\n findings. 5 The Court did not enter or render any findings in support of the\n\n         5\n               Airvantage, L.L.

Maintenance of the action in the county of suit would work an\n                injustice to the movant considering the movant's economic and\n                personal hardship.\n\n        2.      The balance of interests of all the parties predominates in favor of the\n                action being brought in the other county.\n\n        3.      The transfer would not work an injustice to any other party.\n\n TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.

A copy of the Contract\n\n  (consisting of 9 pages) is attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\", and is incorporated by reference for\n\n  herein for all purposes.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     2\n676\n\f      37.

In addition, under the terms of the Contract, Plaintiff was to receive 30% of all proceeds\n\n      from any lawsuit involving Ken, Candy and Howard. At the time the Contract was agreed to and\n\n      executed, there was an Abstract of Judgment filed in Denton County [Document Number 2008-\n\n      38029] against Ken, Candy and Howard in the amount of$911,252.87 plus $149,546.34 in\n\n      interest, in favor of Kip H.

Plaintiff would ask the court to order that the provisions of the Contract be fully enforced\n\n      without delay; and, that the proper gas companies be notified of the action.\n\n      41.       Plaintiffs only offense was in utilizing a provision within the Contract to withdraw its\n\n      money and assets from a situation in which Plaintiff has been taken advantage of and stolen from\n\n      since the outset.\n\n      42.

Below are the relevant provisions of the Contract for Sale of Land, Mineral Rights\n\nand Royalties (\"CSL\"):\n\n                  First paragraph provides that Candy, Ken, and Howard Kirk Gibbs,\n                 collectively \"Gibbs,\" will sell thirty percent (30%) of all land, mineral\n                 rights, royalties, and any other monies or assets which they receive from\n                 (1) the Estate of Bert Gibbs; (2) Bert Gibbs and Kathryn Gibbs personally;\n                 (3) any inheritance in any form received by Gibbs now or in the future; (4)\n                 any proceeds from any lawsuits current or that may arise from seven (7)\n                 different persons or trusts; (5) any assets that have previously been passed\n                 to the Gibbs from four ( 4) different persons or trusts, and the list goes on\n                 (collectively the \"Estates\").\n\n                 Section 3(a) provides, as full consideration, \"Barcroft has paid Gibbs total\n                 of twenty-one (21) silver dollars minted by the United Stated Mint.\"\n\n                 Section 4 states: \"it is understood and agreed that Gibbs may cancel or\n                 nullify this contract only under the following conditions: a) If Gibbs pays\n                 over to Barcroft the sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000 US) in full, in\n                 addition to any money received prior to said one time payment, as\n                 liquidated damages and full settlement of all consideration on Gibbs part.\n\nSee Exhibit A.\n\n        4.       It is undisputed that Albert Barcroft is not a licensed attorney and that he drafted\n\nthe CSL. See Exhibit B.\n\n                                         II. NOT A MAJOR TRANSACTION\n\n        5.       A '\"major transaction' means a transaction evidenced by a written agreement\n\nunder which a person pays or receives, or is obligated to pay or receive, consideration with an\n\naggregate stated value equal to or greater than $1 million.\" TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN\n\n§ 15.020(a). Emphasis added.\n\n\n\nKENNETH GIBBS AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO\nMOTION TO RECONSIDER ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE,\nAND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS\nPENTEX FOUNDATION V. GIBBS, ET AL.\n\n687\n\f        6.      There is no Texas case law which affirms that a buyout provision constitutes an\n\nobligation or an entitlement, and no case law which affirms that Section 15.020 of the Texas\n\nCivil Practices & Remedies Code applies to contracts whose lone stated value appears in a\n\nbuyout provision.\n\n        7.      The Contract for Sale of Land (\"the CSL\") posited neither a requirement to pay,\n\nnor a stated value. The sole stated value of anything anywhere in the CSL involved the buyout\n\nprovision, which addressed neither an obligation nor an entitlement. Parties to the CSL were not\n\nrequired to execute the buyout provision. The buyout provision was simply that- an option. One\n\nthat the respective parties might choose to act upon or not. Not an obligation to pay.\n\n        8.      Likewise, Plaintiff and Intervenor's claim of damages in excess of $1 million did\n\nnot and certainly does not render the CSL a major transaction. Plaintiff and Intervenor's\n\nargument, is frankly, ridiculous. If this were allowed by the courts, then every venue provision\n\nwould be mandatory by alleging $1 million in damages.\n\n                              III.   UNCONSCIONABILITY OF CONTRACT\n\n        9.      If the court finds that the CSL is a major transaction, in the alternative, the\n\nmandatory venue provision \"does not apply to an action if the agreement described by this\n\nsection was unconscionable at the time that it was made.\" TEX. Clv. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN§\n\n15.020(d). Whether or not a contract was unconscionable at the time it was formed is a question\n\nof law. Hoover Slovacek LLP v. Walton, 206 S.W.3d 557, 562 (Tex. 2006).\n\n        10.     The CSL was unconscionable on multiple levels.\n\n        11.     Grossly one-sided contracts. A contract is unconscionable if it is grossly one-\n\nsided. In re: Poly-America, L.P., Ind., 262 S.W.3d 337, 348 (Tex. 2008).\n\n\nKENNETH GIBBS AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO\nMOTION TO RECONSIDER ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE,\nAND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS\nPENTEX FOUNDATION~~ GIBBS, ET AL.\n688\n\f        12.     The terms alone are unconscionable. In Candy's Affidavit, she provides, \"The\n\ntwenty-one (21) silver coins were just ordinary silver coins, and certainly well circulated. Albert\n\n[Barcroft] never pretended that these coins had any kind of special value to them. In fact, Albert\n\neven stated these coins were taken out of his 'junk' silver. He stated that he needed to provide us\n\nwith something, because it would make the contract valid.\" See Exhibit B.\n\n        13.      So, Albert gave twenty-one (21) silver coins, which had little to no real value, for\n\n30% of basically everything Ken, Candy, and Howard Kirk had ever received or would receive\n\nin the future from any lawsuit, inheritance, business, etc.\n\n        14.     The unconscionable buyout terms were shockingly one-sided and primarily\n\npurposed to benefit Albert, much to the detriment of the other parties. Or, read the CSL, the\n\nHeirs could buy out Albert for $5 million.\n\n        15.      Unauthorized practice of law. Texas courts do not enforce contracts to aid in the\n\nunauthorized practice of law. In re: Heritage Organization, 354 B.R. 407 (Bankruptcy N.D.\n\nTex. 2006). Preparing and advising on contracts and settlements is unauthorized practice of law.\n\nDavies v. Unauthorized Practice Committee of the State Bar ofTexas, 431 S.W.2d 590, 593-94\n\n(Tex. Civ. App. -Tyler 1968).\n\n        16.     Correspondence from Albert Barcroft and his wife Pamela clarify without\n\nquestion that Albert practiced law without a license. See Exhibit C. In the summer of 2004,\n\nAlbert entered into a friendship with Howard Kirk. See !d. Sometime later, Albert approached\n\nKen and Candy concerning legal issues the family was experiencing. See Id.         He informed Ken\n\nand Candy that he graduated from law school, could help achieve resolution in the matter of the\n\nEstates, and was able to draft agreements and contracts. See Exhibit B. Albert then drafted the\n\n\nKENNETH GIBBS AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO\nMOTION TO RECONSIDER. ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE,\nAND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS                                                      CAUSE No. CV -14-41665\nPENTEX FOUNDATION V. GiBBS, ET AL.                                                                -4-\n689\n\fCSL, from which he stood to benefit greatly. See /d. He encouraged Ken and Candy to sign the\n\nCSL for their own benefit and counseled them concerning its tenns. See !d.\n\n        17.     Albert's representation of himself as possessing the authority to counsel parties\n\nand to draft legal documents constituted a Class A misdemeanor and was fraud.\n\n                                       IV. MOTION FOR SANCTIONS\n\n        18.     A motion for reconsideration is appropriate in the following circumstances: (1) to\n\naddress an intervening change in controlling law; (2) to consider new evidence not previously\n\navailable; (3) to correct a clear or manifest error of law or fact; or (4) to prevent manifest\n\ninjustice. Fisherman's Harvest, Inc., v. Post, Buckley, Schuh, and Jerigan, Inc., et al., No. G-05-\n\n0151,2008 WL 4277001, at 2 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 10, 2008) (citations omitted). Not liking a ruling\n\nis not a reason to file a motion to reconsider.\n\n        19.     Plaintiff and Intervenor's Motion failed to meet a single criterion for a motion for\n\nreconsideration. The Motion not only mislead the court on the only case that was cited, but the\n\nMotion presented no intervening change in controlling and applicable law, no new evidence, no\n\nerror of law or fact, and no evidence that reconsideration would prevent manifest injustice.\n\n        20.     Given the lack of consideration toward the requirements for a motion for\n\nreconsideration, and given the lack of applicable and substantiating law in the Motion, it is\n\nreasonable to conclude that Plaintiff and Intervenor filed their Motion solely for the purpose of\n\nharassment toward Ken and Candy, and sanctions are appropriate, especially since Ken and\n\nCandy (and counsel) must travel approximately 120 miles to the hearing.\n\n\n\n\nKENNETH GIBBS AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO\nMOTION TO RECONSIDER ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE,\nAND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS                                                      CAUSE NO.

I will also give you a call in the next\n                couple of days to discuss any matter you '<'.ish \"N:th you fully ll:ve :n Guatemala so I will call you. Is\n                there a better time for you?\n\n                First. I am neither an attorney nor a CPA. and I have nothing to do with the account:ng for GWB Family\n                and Friends Trust. Jack Rankin is the CPt\\ for the trust. and Danny Unger [who I believe you have\n                already spoken to] helps to prepare the numbers to send to Rankin. I suppose you would call me a\n                facilitator.\n\n                To give you a little background. I caiT'e in contact with Howard Kirk in the Summer of 2004 because of\n                another problem he had. As we got to know each other. he told me one of the most incredible stories I\n                had ever heard. At first. I truly did not believe :t. Howard told me that Denton County had killed his\n                father [although his Dad did not die for another 5 months]. and that a JUdge named Don Windle had\n                sided with one of his brothers and stolen his father's entire estate. As I got more involved. I found all of\n                his wild stories were true. I promise Bert Gibbs. on his death bed. that I would do everything I could to\n                save at lest some of his estate for hi~. kids. I kept that promise.\n\n                The worst part of the whole story is that a final judgment was in place for well over the 30 days\n                required for finalization which gave virtually the entire estate to Kip. the other brother: and. in which\n                each Candy. Howard and Ken had a :~.1 million dollar final judgment against them It too was final.\n                and there was talk and action towards tak:ng their assets from them. I found the entire scenario to be\n                totally unfair and unJust\n\n                I have a close friend who is an attorney. I took it to him. I also :nvolved Danny Unger. who was a good\n                friend and is an excellent researcher. Together. we looked for a way to break the final judgment. After\n                about a month of research, we came up with something we thought had a chance to work- a bill of\n                review. We realized it would take a 'ong time. a lot of research and hard work, and money that we\n                really didn't have to expend. Enter Pentex Foundation.\n\n                Pentex Foundation is a private not for profit foundation in Panama with whom I had extensive\n                dealings. I knew they had some money to invest. and I went to them with a proposition·· finance our\n                battle and get a share of what we win. They agreed. and put up S250.000 for expenses. There were\n                many times I thought we would not \\Jet that money back.\n\n                The deal I took back to Candy. Ken <:,nd Howard was simple [they did not know the foundation was\n                involved at that time]. I would get tre money for expenses and do the work for 30% of whatever we\n                recovered. The 30% would include me. John Skolnik [the attorney]. and Danny Unger.

The next 5 years of my life was totally devoted to this\n               case.\n\n               After we were rejected in our first attempt to the Court of Appea:s in Ft. Worth. it became clear that this\n               matter had gone political: and. that if we were going to prevail we needed someone with clout in that\n               court. I started looking. but I found the same thing the Gibbs had found before I came along-- no\n               lawyers wanted to touch this case. After al:. it was over. settled: and. a final judgment was in place.\n                We were close to admitting defeat when Danny told his brother-in-law. Jay Henderson about the\n               case. Jay practices law in Kerrville and Houston. He and I talked a number of times. One day he\n               said, I'm in. Let's see who else we can get. Enter Rickey Brantley. Scott Pelley and Virginia Hammerly.\n               all class mates of Jay's at Baylor. We met several times. Finally. they agreed to take the case. The\n               cost would be 10% for each one of thHrn. and 10% for expenses. total 50%. I took the deal to Candy,\n               Ken and Howard. They all agreed that there was no other chance. everything was already lost. We\n               signed the deal with these guys\n\n               The Ft. Worth Court of Appeals. obviously totally void of conscience or ethics, were putty in the hands of\n               Rickey Brantley. Rickey used the exact same petition that we had filed 7 months earlier [and which\n               was dismissed without hearing in 3 days]: and, the court granted everything we asked for. Although\n               we were still a long way from the finish line, the tide had turned. I think In still have the copy we wrote if\n               you would be interested in reading it. All Rickey did was change the signature page.\n\n               So. that's why the Gibbs' portion was so small. It carne up as each one [Candy. Ken. Howard] started\n               being 2.1 million dollars in debt. erased the judgments on eactl. and gave them what they now have.\n               When I carne in. no lawyer would even talk to them about takin£J their case. and it was over. Now they\n               have something.\n\n               As for the voting shares of which 50% are held by Pentex Royalty Trust. that was a condition placed by\n               Pentex Foundation BEFORE the first dollar was spent. and as part of the original conditions. What we\n               were looking at was a family that hac already cut each other's throats more than once. In the short\n               time I had known them. I had seen them band together to fight a common foe. and then be willing to\n               plow another sibling under. It would take an idiot to go into a situation where there was a lot of money\n               at stake where they could band together a•d vote to hurt or limit another party. We are actually seeing\n               the wisdom of that decision now. because two of the three [Ken and Candy] have decided they do not\n               want to honor the Family Settlement Agreement that everyone agreed to that ended this mess. That\n               agreement calls for the immediate sale of the land; however. it has been well over 4 years, and the\n               main part is not sold [it was not even listed until last summer]. Ken [the Executor of the Estate] has\n               stated publicly that he will never sell the home place. which constitutes about 2/3 of the total land\n               value.\n\n               Pentex Royalty Trust has never usecl its voting powers to force any issue: however. it would use those\n               powers to keep the Gibbs from total·y changing the deal.\n\n               Since Pentex Foundation is. in fact. a foundation. there is no beneficiary. I was compensated out of\n               their share for my services. as was John Skotnik and Danny Unger.\n\n               As for your concerns about the K-1':s. I share your view. PentE•x Royalty Trust. whose sole beneficiary is\n               Pentex Foundation. files a tax return every year. and makes monthly tax deposits on the income it\n               receives. The Estate itself is holding everything up. I have been complaining for the last two weeks.\n               Pentex Royalty Trust was also forced to file an extension it did not want to file. GWB Family and\n               Friends Trust had to file an extension for the same reason. While it is my opinion that Rickey Brantley\n               is one of the best attorneys I have ever seen. especially in that court in Ft. Worth. I am not pleased with;,~~~iii ;.\n               the way he and Ken are handling the Estate. Rickey Brantley is the attorney for the Estate.

I HAVE HAD mill!\nOver 8 years ago, Howard came in to At• s office, and I have regretted it ever\nsince. Our WHOLE life changed from that day till now. All AI ever wanted to\ndo was help you guys. It started with one small problem and escalated into the\nbiggest NIGHTMARE. For YEARS, your family squabbles have interrupted our\nlife. Our family BIRTHDAY's, THANKSGIVINGS, Christmas•, and other\nholidays were not even SACRED t(l you. You KNEW when you called MA~\ntimes, that AI was leaving family 9et-togethers, at my DEEP, HEART-FELT\ndissatisfaction, to meet at Denton restaurants or McKinney locals, to HELP you\nguys with •things that could not wait one more minute!!'. You brother Kip HAD,\nIN FACT, successfully BEATEN and STOLEN everything, ruined your fathers\nhealth and ultimately killed him, and even, including your dignity was stomped on\nat that time. AI invested OUR ENTIRE retirement savings and annual income in\nyour MESS, while I worked and scraped without his help to keep our life and\nmoney affairs in order. FIVE YEARS, he invested time and money and\nwhat EVER it took. SOLELY TO A.ND FOR YOU .... FIVE YEARS .... to get you a\nWIN IN COURT. And NOW, after FOUR MORE years ... month after\nmonth ... year after year ... YOU JVST KEEP STIRRING UP SHIT ... accusing AL\nand everybody and their uncle of cheating you and disrespecting you and the\nICING ON THE CAKE ... is to say that he took advantage of YOU when your son\ndied. AL, for DAMN sure, tried to get you to wait to sign till you were not\nunder stress. SIGNING WAS the RIGHT THING TO DO ... but he wanted you\nto wait. YOU INSISTED on ending all the trials and tribulations and even said\nTO ME and countless others ... that you should have been spending more time\nworrying about raising your kids and family matters than being angry and bitter\nover the contracts. WELL, YOU ARE RIGHT BACK THERE AGAIN. Why don•t\nyou get on some damn medication for OCD. EVERYBODY Knows you need\nit ... and everybody INCLUDING nte, has tried to be tactful and helpful to get\nYOU to a better place and understanding of your life ... for you AND FOR USIIIII\nTWO YEARS ago, I wrote you and told you were raising Al•s blood pressure with\n\n\n\n\n705\n\f1\n                                                             -.\n     all this shit ... and you said you wer•e sorry ond eased up. BUT IT DIDN'T\n    LAST. You have pushed him TOO for now .... he HAS to give up on you, before\n     it kills him. TRY TO REMEMBER, HE IS NOT THE ENEMY ... HE IS THE ONLY\n     REASON YOU HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE (whether you are enjoying it or not).\n    TRY TO REMEMBER THAT KIP DID NOT BEAT YOU OUT OF EVERYTHING.\n    THAT THERE IS NO 'NEGOTIATING' ANYTHING NOW ... the agreements YOU\n    AND YOUR BROTHERS MADE, were made YEARS ago and ordered by a court\n    and judge IN YOUR FAVOR. And at the time .... you were DELIRIOUSLY HAPPY\n    with the deal that was made. NOW. . . . FOLLOW THE DAMN ORDERS, GET US\n    OUR RETIREMENT BACK ... AND l.ET US MOVE ONIIIII Will it take ANOTHER\n    tragedy to OPEN your EYES and your HEART???? DOES the TRAGEDY need to\n    be my HUSBANDS life???? HOW DARE YOU accuse him of deceiving you,\n    disrespecting you, cheating you, .... after ALL he has done for you. He has tried\n    to help put you and your brotf1ers together ... and YOU and YOU alone, stir it all\n    back upllll You are like a bad soap opera .... DARK SHADOWS ... what hateful\n    gloom lingers around the next email or phone call. .. ??? If AI had not taken you\n    guys on ... my life would still be normal. YOUR FAMILY Is responsible TOTAU.Y\n    for the mess I am in now .... AND YOlJ REMEMBER ONE THING, if you\n    remember NOTHING ELSE .... if something happens to MY HUSBAND .... you\n    have to deal with me .... AND l..ADY ... YOU BEUEVE ME WHEN I TELL\n    YOU ...

A party must establish mandatory venue by prima facie proof.         TEX.\n\n\n         R. CIV. P. 87(3). All parties have made reference to the Contract and its\n\n         $5,000,000 liquidated damages provision. Further, the uncontroverted venue facts\n\n         establish that this is a lawsuit involving in excess of $1,000,000. Movants have\n\n         established mandatory venue by prima facie proof. Spin Doctor Golf Inc. v.\n\n\n         REPLY TO RESPONSE TO MOTION TO RECONSIDER ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE ... PAGE I\n\n        709\n\f Paymentech, L.P., 296 S.W.3d 354, 357, 359, teaches that this is sufficient:\n\n         The agreement attached to the motion to transfer venue lists annual\n         sales of over $1 ,000,000.00. Thus, on its face, it constitutes prima\n         facie evidence of a major transaction within the meaning of section\n         15.020(a).\n\n         2.      The $5,000,000 liquidated damages clause is to be given no less\n\n effect. \"The term 'liquidated damages' ordinarily refers to an unacceptable\n\n measure of damages that the parties stipulate in advance will be assessed in the\n\n event of a contract breach.\" Flores v. Millennium Interests, Ltd., 185 S.W.3d 427,\n\n 431 (Tex. 2005). It allows contracting parties to protect themselves against the\n\n difficulty, uncertainty, and expenses involved when trying to ascertain actual\n\n damages. 1 \"Given this desirable goal, it is well established that parties may\n\n stipulate at the time of contracting to a set damages amount for a breach of that\n\n contract, as long as the liquidated damages provision is not a penalty.\"\n\n         3.      In addition to the stated liquidated damages of$5,000,000, the facts\n\n underlying this case reflect that it was clearly a major transaction.

PAGE 2\n\n710\n\f Friends Trust for $2,037,803.50. 2 Attached hereto as Plaintiffs Exhibit 2 is the\n\n Affidavit of Fact of Howard Gibbs, who states that he has personally \"received in\n\n excess of$1,000,000 as consideration from the [Contract].\" Attached hereto as\n\n Plaintiffs Exhibit 3 is the Unsworn Statement Given Under Penalty of Perjury by\n\n Albert Barcroft, wherein he relates in paragraph 14, the same, that each of the\n\n Defendants have received well in excess of a million dollars. 3 Finally, the size of\n\n this matter is not really in dispute, as opposing counsel has represented as much in\n\n proceedings in Tarrant County:\n\n         There is currently a $6.1 million offer on a piece of property, to pay in\n         full, or a $8.5 million installment agreement over the next five years,\n         that will come to the estate of Bert Gibbs. . . . There is a lot of\n         money out there. My clients - my two clients own 25% of the estate.\n         So if they own 25 percent, they are potentially going to get $2\n         million. Al Barcroft owns a percentage and Howard Kirk Gibbs also\n         owns- he owns 12.5 pecent. ... So we have a lot of assets for the\n         estate of Bert Gibbs. 4\n\n\n\n\n        2\n                The GWB Family and Friends Trust was the business entity created pursuant to\n paragraph 6 of the Contract to received and distribute funds pursuant to the Contract terms.\n         3\n                 Submitted pursuant to TEx.

PAGE 3\n\n711\n\f                   DEFENDANTS' CONCEDE THAT THIS SUIT\n                      INVOLVES A MAJOR TRANSACTION,\n                  BY ATTEMPTING TO ASSERT AN EXCEPTION\n\n         4.      Sensing the validity of the above, the Defendants seek to assert an\n\n exception to mandatory venue by attempting to assert that the Contract was\n\n unconscionable. It should be noted that- despite raising other affirmative\n\n defenses - avoidance of the contract on the basis of unenforceability has not been\n\n alleged as an affirmative defense, as would be required by Rule 94. 5 Nowhere\n\n does it appear in the Defendant's lengthy motion and answer on file with this\n\n\n\n         5.      With respect to this alleged claim in avoidance of the Contract, they\n\n first claim that the Contract was one-sided. This is non-sense. Defendants' own\n\n responsive evidence, attached as Exhibit \"C\" to their Response, is an email from\n\n Albert Barcroft. Mr. Barcroft was Movants' predecessor in interest in the\n\n Contract. He relates in Defendant's Exhibit \"C\" that at the time of the Contract's\n\n inception, the three Gibbs siblings had already lost everything from their parents'\n\n estates. A final judgment was in place granting almost the entirety of the estate to\n\n\n         5\n                \"In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively ... any\n other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\" TEX. R. CIV. P. 94.\n         6\n               See, the Motion to Show Authority, Motion for Change ofVenue, Original\n Answer, Affirmative Defenses, Original Counterclaim, and Rule 13 Motion for Sanctions of\n Kenneth Vern Gibbs and Candace Walton Gibbs, filed on or about Aprill8, 2014.\n REPLY TO RESPONSE TO MOTION TO RECONSIDER ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE ... PAGE 4\n\n\n712\n\f Kip, a fourth Gibbs sibling, and granting a judgment against Candy, Howard and\n\n Ken in excess of$1,000,000. 7 The essence of the Contract was to try to recoup the\n\n lost estate. The goal was successful after five years of tedious work. The\n\n Defendants now receive funds from their parents' estates that they would have\n\n otherwise never seen. This Contract was imminently fair, given that it converted\n\n the proverbial sow's ear of an adverse judgment into the silk purse of recovery.\n\n         6.      Next, the Defendants assert that Mr. Barcroft practiced law without a\n\n license, and after all these years the Contract is now not enforceable. This too is a\n\n fallacy. Again, referring to the Defendant's Exhibit C, Mr. Barcroft expressly\n\n denies being an attorney. The Contract itself states, in paragraph 3, subpart c, that\n\n \"Barcroft, at his expense, will provide legal counsel by acquiring a licensed\n\n attorney .... \" Mr. Barcroft specifically denies ever holding himself out as an\n\n attorney in Plaintiffs Exhibit 3, at paragraph 5. Importantly, Howard Gibbs\n\n reaffirms this:\n\n        Al never stated that he was an attorney, and never offered to represent\n        any of us. . . . I was at every meeting in which Candy and Ken met\n        with Al, and Al never said he was an attorney or could represent us in\n        any way. . . .

I metAl Barcroft (\"AI\") through a mutual acquaintance in October of2004. I had a legal\nproblem with a criminal charge of simulated legal process against me in Denton County. I was\nhaving trouble getting an attorney to represent me because of the situation, and because I had no\nmoney. Al immediately told me about John Skotnik (\"John\"), who he said was an attorney, and\na personal friend of his. AI said that he would try to get John to talk to me. He did arrange a\nmeeting, and John represented me in the County Court of Denton County, and was able to get the\nsentence already against me greatly reduced. He did not charge me for what he did because I\nhad no money. I have always believed that AI paid John because he thought I had been unfairly\nconvicted, but I don't know that for sure.\n\n2.       AI never said he was an attorney, and never offered to represent any of us. He never\ncharged us or asked for payment for any of the things he did other than his share of the contract\nsigned on May 10, 2005 by my brother Ken, my sister Candy Walton, myself, and AI, said\ndocument entitled ''Contract for Sale of Land, Mineral Rights and Royalties, and all other\nAssets or Monies Received from the Estate of Bert Hughes Gibbs, Kathryn G. Gibbs, and/or\nthe Mary L. Houseworth Trust(s) or 'The Kathryn Houseworth Gibbs Irrevocable Trust\"'\n(\"CSL\") (See Exhibit \"A\"). After we signed the CSL, we were all in it together, and AI treated\nus all like the partners we were. We all discussed and got a vote on everything we did. AI never\noverrode any of us on any issue from the very beginning, even though he had the votes to do it.\n\n3.      At first mention of something I was charged with in court, he told me about John. I was\nat every meeting in which Candy and Ken met with Al, and Al never said he was an attorney or\ncould represent us in any way. After the CSL was signed, we all worked together and discussed\nevery issue as a team. Candy and I had as much input as Al did.\n\n4.      There was no mention of Al's education in any of the meetings or conversations leading\nup to the signing of the CSL. I would remember if he had said he was an attorney or had gone to\nlaw school while we were negotiating a contract. He did not.\n\n\n\n                                                                                       I\n715                                                                                     I\n\f5.       AI talked with us, and we explained about how our inheritance had been stolen from us.\nAt first, he did not believe what we told him. He stated that he would not get involved in the\nwhole mess, but that he would try to get John to help me on the criminal issue. But when he saw\nhow my criminal case was handled, he said he would talk to John to see if John would represent\nus in the civil case if he got involved.\n\n6.      AI would meet with us and take notes, usually at a fast food restaurant. Then he would\nsay that he would talk to John. A few days later, he would meet with us again. After a number\nof these meetings, he said something to the effect of: \"I must be crazy, but if you want to sell me\na share of whatever we can get back, I'll put up the money for John's legal fees and for the legal\nresearch needed\". We agreed and sold him 30% of everything that could be saved from our\ninheritance. This is the title and first paragraph of the CSL that reflects the 30% payment:\n                       Coatract for Sale of Land.

Although we each\ngot 7 silver dollars, it was clear that the consideration Al was going to provide was a way to\npossibly get some of our inheritance back, and that it would involve a lot of money from him.\nEven so, Ken stood up, shook Al' s hand, and stated, \"I think we got the better deal on this\",\nreferring to the silver dollars. We all laughed, but it was a true statement.\n\n7.      AI provided everything he said he would, and the proof is in the fact that we were\nultimately successful. Anyone who claims we sold him 30% of our inheritance for 21 silver\ndollars alone is a liar, a fool, or someone that does not know what actually happened. Anyone\nwho believes we would have gotten anything had AI not come along is just plain wrong. Not\nonly had Ken, Candy and I lost all inheritance from both of our parents, there was a seasoned\njudgment against us of well over $1,000,000 (See Exhibit \"B\"). Anybody who wants to steal\nAl's share negotiated in the CSL now is dishonest, ungrateful, and a thief.\n\n\n716                     Page 2 of 4 of How\"'d G;bb' Affidav;t dated   NM\"'      4, 2014\n\f8.      I have received in excess of $1,000,000 as consideration from the CSL. The 7 silver\ndollars I received upon the signing of the CSL was the consideration paid by Al just to establish\nthe contract. Al never told Ken, Candy or me upon any of our numerous meetings that these 7\nsilver dollars each of us was paid was our only consideration. In fact, the excerpt under item #6\nabove states Al receives 30% of any of the estate assets recovered. The remaining 70% of assets\nwas the consideration Ken, Candy and myself would split up after Al received his 30%. This is\nclearly seen on page 4, item #6 of the CSL, in which the division of recovered estate assets is\ndescribed as follows:\n      the panaes, shall be agreed upon by all parttcs hereto. fhc dJVlsJon shall be divided on a\n      basis of 30°/u   10   Barcroft ..B.J4~\"o to Kenneth Vem GJbbs, 23.3J~·u to Candace \\Vahon\n      Gtbbs, and 23.33% to Howard Knk C>bbs.             <tl   each mstance of d1spt:TSal to the partccs.\n\n\nAnyone that claims the only consideration I was to receive from the CSL transaction is 7 silver\ndollars is delusional.\n\n9.      After all parties signed the CSL, Al immediately brought John on board as the attorney,\nhired Danny Unger (\"Danny\") to do legal research, and they all worked constantly on our estate\nissues for the many months. Al worked on it for years.\n\n10.    I don't know who actually wrote the CSL, and neither does Candy, because we had no\nway to know. Neither of us was there when it was written, and Al never stated who wrote it. Al\nwould meet us, take notes, and then say he would talk to John and get back to us. I do know Al\nbrought a couple of contracts to us before the one we signed. I do know that Ken, Candy and I\nadded at least one provision to the last contract before we signed it, and that was section \"h\" of\nthe CSL. AI agreed to the addition.\n\n11.     When Al brought the contract that we finally signed back to us, he told us to read it and\ncheck it any way we wanted. If we agreed, he would meet us to sign it. We had sufficient time\nto have it looked over by an attorney if we wanted to, but none of us had any money, and none of\nus believed that our inheritance would ever be returned anyway. I am positive that had it not\nbeen for Al, our inheritance would have never been returned and Ken, Candy and I would have\nnever been able to pay off the judgment signed by judge Don Windle. I have heard Candy say\nthe same thing many times.\n\n12.    I have personally seen many e-mails written by Candy to Al, and I have personally heard\nCandy tell Al on numerous occasions, that had it not been for him, none of us would have gotten\nanything, and that he was the \"only one who earned his money\".\n\n13.   Prior to the entry of Ms. Christy Lee into the process, Candy had never questioned the\nCSL or Al in any way. She did question almost everything and everyone else, including every\n\n\n717                         Pogo 3 of 4 of How\"d Gibb' Affidovit dmod   N~    b\" 4, 2014\n\f                          '-'.·\nattorney we ever had, and accused most of them of stealing from her. She stated many times that\nAI was the only one who earned his money. None of that changed until Ms. Lee made her entry.\n\n14.     In my opinion, the only thing \"unconscionable\" in this whole affair is Candy and Ken\ntrying to steal Al's share of the CSL when they and myself would have nothing without what he\ndid.\n\nFURTHER, AFFIANT SAYETH NOT.\n\n                      ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND VERIFICATION\n\n                §\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS\n                §\nCOUNTYOFTARRANT §\n\n        BEFORE ME, the undersigned authority, on this day personally appeared Howard Kirk\nGibbs, known to me to be the person whose name is subscribed to the foregoing affidavit, and,\nafter being administered the oath, acknowledged to me that he is a defendant in the therein\nreferenced lawsuit; and, that the foregoing \"Affidavit of Fact\" will be filed in that case or related\nmatters, and the facts stated therein are true, correct, and complete, and given as his own free act\nand of his own personal knowledge under penalty of perjury.\n\n\n\n\n                                                Howard Kirk Gibbs\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBED AND SWORN TO BEFORE ME this 51h day ofNovember, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n718                   Page 4 of 4 of Howard Gibbs Affidavit dated November 4, 20 I 4\n\f                                                                           Denton County\n                                                                          Cynthl• Mitchell\n                                                                               County Cteli(\n                I\nI\n            l                           l     I\n                                                                          Denton.

The court has appropriate jurisdiction under the Texas Trust Code, Texas Probate\n\n      Code, and the Texas Govenunent Code;\n\n                3.       All necessary citations have been issued;\n\n               4.        Defendants each had notice of the setting for trial but did not attend;\n\n                5.      Plaintiff provided evidence proving liability, causation, and damages for all causes\n      of actions pleaded;\n\n               6.       Bert Hughes Gibbs (''Bert\") was the husband of Kathryn Houseworth Gibbs\n\n      (\"Kathryn''), and Candace Gibbs Walton (''Candy\"), Kenneth Vern Gibbs (\"Kenneth\"), and\n\n      Howard Kirk Gibbs (\"Howard Kirk\") were her children;\n\n               7.       On July 17, 1990, Kathryn's mother, Mary L. Houseworth (\"MaryH), created both\n\n      the Mary L. Houseworth Revocable Trust (\"Houseworth Trust\") and the Kathryn Houseworth\n\n      Gibbs Irrevocable Trust (\"Gibbs Trust\");\n\n               8.       On February 7, 1991, Mary signed the First Amendment to the Mary L.\n\n      Houseworth Revocable Trust which added Candy as a co-trustee with Mary, required joint action\n\n      between Mary and Candy, and prohibited unilateral action by Candy as co-trustee;                          ....\n               9.       Upon the death of Mary, the Houseworth Trust, by its own terms, converted to an\n\n      irrevocable trust and the assets of the Houseworth Trust became assets of the Gibbs Trust and\n\n      Kathryn was to receive a mandatory :monthly distribution of not less than $2,000.00 nor more\n\n      than $3,000.00; further, the overall purpose of the trusts were so that Kathryn shall be able to live\n\n      in a manner consistent with her 1990 standard of living;\n\n                10.     Compliance with the purpose and intent of the trusts would be defeated by\n\n      maintaining the cun-ent level of monthly distributions to Kathryn;\n\n\n\n      Page: 2 of9 •    FINALJUDGM~I'll'\n                      (Oibbs.Kat/Fina1Judgment)(lce;01190S]\n\n\n\n\n730\n\f01/25/2005   15:05        21444'-''38                       GIBBS R_E __ R   ..._t               PAGE     03\n\n\n\n\n             11.      The Houseworth Trust provides that all benefits of the trust are held for Kathryn\n\n     and that her children, Candy, KeMeth, Howard Kirk, and Kip Hughes Gibbs (\"Kip'') are the\n     beneficiaries after Kathryn's death;\n\n             12.     The Gibbs Trust designated Mary, Kathryn, Candy, Kenneth, Howard Kirk, and\n\n     Kip as beneficiaries and that~til income was payable to the Houseworth Trust during Mary's\n\n     lifetime, provided that distributions could be made to any beneficiary for health emergencies, and\n\n     stated that Kathryn and any three of the four children could direct income or principal to be\n\n     distributed directly to Kathryn;\n\n             13.     Mary died testate in 1991 ;\n\n             14.     Kathryn is incapable of protecting her own interests and from the importuning of\n\n     her husband and children and will sign ahnost anything for anyone who asks her to do so;\n\n             15.     On and after August 1998, after being terrorized about impending Y2K disasters\n\n     and the importuning of the defendants, Kathryn signed blanket authorizations, later signed by\n\n     Candy, Kenneth, and Howard Kirk, withdrawing $1,015,000.00 from the Gibbs Trust (\"Removed\n\n    Funds\");                                                                                               ~   •'\n\n\n\n             16.     Kathryn was told by defendants that the Removed Funds were to provide for\n\n    staples for the family during the impending crisis;\n\n             17.     The Removed Funds were controlled and/or spent by the defendants;\n\n             18.     $701,021.00 of gold coins and junk metal were purchased with the Removed\n\n    Funds. The balance of the Removed Funds were either !>pent by or distributed to the defendants;\n\n             19.     Plaintiff received $36,200.00 from the Removed Funds which was subsequently\n\n    spent for Kathryn's benefit or deposited with the court;\n\n\n\n                   FINAL JUDQ~EN'f\n                   (Gibbs.K.at1Final1udgment)[lcc;otl90S]\n\n\n\n\n 7~\n\f01/26/2005      15:05      21444'-'98                       GIBBS R_E __R    \\wl                    PAGE     04\n  .'\n\n\n\n\n                20.     Plaintiff did not participate wi.th the defendants in the withdrawal ofthe Removed\n\n       Funds;\n\n                21.     Plaintiff did not consent to the withdrawal of the Removed Funds;\n\n                22.     Plaintiff affmnatively demonstrated to defendants of his disagreement with the\n\n       withdrawal of the Removed Funds;\n\n                23.     Plaintiff demanded that the Removed Funds be accounted for and returned to the\n\n       Gibbs Trust after it was evident that Y2K did not pose any society ending problems;\n\n                24.     Defendants openly and steadfastly refused to comply with plaintiff's demand;\n\n                25.     Each defendant was in a fiduciary relationship with Kathryn Houseworth Gibbs\n\n       (\"Kathryn'1), or, alternatively, a relationship of special trust and confidence giving rise to\n\n       fiduciary duties;\n\n                26.     Each defendant is fully accountable to Kathryn for the Removed Funds;\n\n                27.     Each defendant breached their respective fiduciary obligation to Kathryn;\n\n                28.     The defendants' decision to purchase the gold coins and junk metal was an\n\n       inadvisable, imprudent and improper investment and did not meet any standard of wise or                ....\n       prudent fiduciary management;\n\n                29.     Plaintiff recovered from defendants (i) all of the gold coins and junk metal\n\n       purchased with the Removed Funds, and (ii) the amount of $225,873.03.\n\n                30.     Plaintiff was unable to account for $88,141.97 of the Removed Funds;\n\n                31.     Plaintiff, under court order, sold the gold coins and junk metal for $387,419.03;\n\n       the sale :resulted in a net loss of $313,601.97 to the Gibbs Trust;\n\f01/26/2005    15:05       21444.._,:38                       GIBBS R_E__ R   ·~                   PAGE     05\n\n\n\n\n             32.      The method of resale of the gold coins, approved by court order. was reasonably\n\n     calculated, and diligently pursued, to obtain the highest possible resale cost in value on the gold\n     coins and other precious metals;\n\n             33.      Defendants, primarily Howard Kirk Gibbs, negligently or intention~lly failed to\n\n     comply with federal tax law which resulted in the penalties and interest being incw-red by the\n     Houseworth Trust and the Gibbs Trust;\n\n             34.      The wrongful withdrawal of the Removed Funds directly caused federal income\n\n    tax penalties and interest to be incurred in the amount of $143,843.81 which was subsequently\n    paid by the Houseworth Trust and the Gibbs Trust;\n\n             35.      The attorney fees in the amount of $115,665.12 incurred by plaintiff in his\n\n    capacity as next friend of Kathryn Gibbs and as co-guardian of the estate of Kathryn Houseworth\n\n    Gibbs in an effort to recover the Removed Funds and to recover damages incurred by the\n\n    Houseworth Trust and the Gibbs Trust as a result of defendants' actions       were reasonable and\n\n    necessary;\n\n             36.      The plainti:ffh&incurred actual damages in the amount of$661,252.87;                 ;.,.\n\n\n\n             37.      Five percent is the COITect prejudgment interest rate applicable under the Texas\n\n    Finance Code;\n\n             38.      The conduct of one, some, or all, of the defendants at various stages of this\n\n    litigation has been recalcitrant, obstreperous, abusive, vexatious, dilatory, and engaged in with\n\n    intentional malice, or alternatively, with a reckless disregard for the rights of the trust\n\n    beneficiary, Kathryn; has been engaged in for no good-faith purpose; has been engaged in bad\n\n    faith during the course of this Htigation; and has included the hiring and firing of four separate\n\n    attorneys and multiple dilatory motions;\n\n    PageS of9 •    FIN\"L .JUDGMENT\n                   (Gibbs.Kat!Final Judgment)[lcc;Ot 1905]\n\n\n\n\n  7®\n\f01/25/2005    15:05                                        GIBBS R_E __ R   -....,                   PAGE   05\n\n\n\n\n             39.      The punitive damage award of $250,000.00 is based on the underlying withdrawal\n\n     of $1,015,000.00, the loss of use of the Removed Funds, and the actual damages and bears a\n\n    direct and rational relationship to actual damages incurred in this case and is reasonably\n\n    calculated to accomplish the legitimate pwposes of exemplary dantlges that is act as a deterrent\n\n    to the same or similar conduct by others in the future and to punish wrongdoers;\n\n             40.      The majority of the activity by defendants in this case cannot be excused as\n\n    nonnal defensive tactics or advocacy or litigation proce~s but an abuse of the system;\n\n             41.      Defendants refused continuously and throughout the course of the litigation to\n\n    disclose any meaningful financial infonnation, documents, papers, exhibits, or other matters,\n\n    even though proper request for the same was made;\n\n             42.      There is no way in which any one defendant can be excused or set aside or: limited\n\n    or exculpated from the conduct of the other defendants;\n\n             43.      Defendants conduct is so inextricably intertwined that the court is unable to\n\n    segregate any element of damages, and hence, makes all damages, including those that are\n\n    exemplary, joint and several;                                                                           o>.\n\n\n             44.    The purposes and intentions expressed by Mary in the creation of both the\n\n    Houseworth Trust and the Gibbs Trust have been frustrated through the conduct of defendants,\n\n    and that because of the defendants • conduct of defendants, three of whom are contingent trust\n\n    beneficiaries, that the court must modifY the trusts to exclude any possibility of control by them\n\n    with respect to the trusts or their administration or any ability to cause the withdrawal of funds;\n\n             45.    The conduct of defendants commencing with the withdrawal of the funds from the\n\n    trusts and continuing throughout the coun;e of this litigation was undertaken with the specific\n\n    malicious intent to either defraud or harm or permanently deprive the primary trust beneficiary,\n\n    Page 6 of9-    FINALJUDOMEI'IT\n    ~ibbo.KoUF;\"' '\"''\"'\"\"')[!~'\" l90S)\n\n\n\n 73~\n\f01/26/2005     15:05                                           GIBBS R_E__R       .._,.

The actions of defendants operate as a forfeiture of their interest in both the\n\n     Houseworth Trust and the Gibbs Trust as contingent beneficiaries, or alternatively, if this finding\n\n     is later determined to not be consistent with law in that the defendants conduct does not justify a\n\n     forfeiture, the court finds that such actions by defendants was of such reckless disregard and with\n\n     such malicious intent and caused such harm and damage to plaintiff, that the court orders a\n\n     surcharge against the interest of those contingent beneficiaries equal to their pro rata share of the\n\n     judgment.\n\n               The court therefore renders judgment in favor of plaintiff and against defendants and\n\n     ORDERS that:\n\n               l.

I did not claim to be an attorney, I did not claim I had attended law school, and I did not tell the\n                  Gibbs I could represent them in any manner.          I did not ever ask for, expect or receive\n                  compensation for anything from the Gibbs other than as consideration under the CSL. I did not\n                  try to induce the Gibbs in any way other than to say I would put up money, hire an attorney,\n                  and work hard to get some of their inheritance back. I have many e-mails from Candace\n                  Walton, the last one coming just after Ms. Lee was hired, thanking me for saving their\n                  inheritance. Ms. Lee was able to change all ofthat, and replace it with charges of wrongdoing.\n             6.   I did not draft the CSL without assistance. Contrary to her statement under oath, Candace\n                  Walton had no way to know who drafted the CSL, although she swore to that fact.\n             7. Defendants Candace Walton and Kenneth Gibbs stated as fact that \"John Skotnik drafted the\n                  CSL\" in their original answer in the 336th District Court of Fannin County, Texas, case number\n                  cv-14-41665 (\"lawsuit\") when they were attempting to disqualify John Skotnik.\n             8. Defendants Candace Walton and Kenneth Gibbs stated as fact that \"it is an established fact\n                  that Albert drafted the CSL\" in their Response to Motion for Summary Judgment in the\n                  same lawsuit when the wanted to say Albert Barcroft practiced law without a license.\n             9. There was no discovery from either John Skotnik or Albert Barcroft between the two\n                  \"statements of fact\" that could have resulted in any fact as to who drafted the CSL being\n                  established.\n             10. Candace Walton and Kenneth Gibbs have shown a strong propensity throughout these\n                  proceedings and those in a related case in Tarrant County Probate Court #2, case number 2005-\n                  0000126-2-D, to state as fact that which is not; and, to change their stated facts to me~et\n                                                                                                          their\n                  instant needs.\n                                                             '     PLAINTIFF'S\n                                                             ~       EXHIBIT                                                      \"V   '1~~~.~~~!!.t'.,,\n                                                             ~                                                               \\]t.~ ,~             ~~,v~,\n\n      738                                                    ~         J                                         .      :0,.':;   i                  \\=~\\\n------------------·-------·-·--- ..                          f                         --------------------~~\n                                                                                                                       {~i                            r:,_s;\n                                                                                                                       <,?).\\              ~l\n                                                                                                                        \\~~:}>· ',.        v    J / r,J;\\ .\n                                                                                                                             . tfJ~icC\" /\n\f      11. Everything I did leading up to the signing of the CSL was in business negotiations on my own\n         behalf. I did not give legal advice, I did not represent anybody other than myself or say I\n         could, I did not claim to have attended law school, I did not expect, ask for or receive any\n         compensation from the Gibbs other than later as consideration under the CSL, and I did not tell\n         the Gibbs not to get legal advice before they signed the CSL. None of these charges were\n         made until over 8 years after the fact when Christy Lee became attorney for Candace Walton\n         and Kenneth Gibbs, and started creating baseless allegations and lies to support those\n         allegations. There is absolutely no evidence that any such charges were ever levied in the pre-\n         Lee era, because said allegations were absolutely contrived after Ms. Lee took over, and are\n         false, and the Gibbs did not used to be liars.\n      12. After the signing of the CSL, I immediately hired John Skotnik as attorney to represent the\n         Gibbs' interest. John Skotnik had already represented Howard Gibbs in a criminal matter,\n         showing that I did not hold myself out as an attorney or as someone who could represent\n         another party.\n      13. The false allegation that the CSL was unconscionable because I was practicing Jaw without a\n          license in order to induce the Gibbs into signing the CSL, and because of the consideration\n         given the Gibbs under the CSL is a recent invention of Ms. Lee. The allegation was not made\n          in the Gibbs Original Answer, Counterclaim or Affinnative Defense, nor in any amendments to\n         that answer. Neither was the allegation made in the Original Gibbs Tarrant County lawsuit\n          filed in the Probate Court Number 2 of Tarrant County, case number 2005-0000 126-2-D,\n          which addresses virtually the same issues as the case in Fannin County. After almost a decade\n         and numerous filings in the Fannin County and Tarrant County courts, the Gibbs have\n         apparently just discovered that they were deceived by me while \"practicing law without a\n         license\" into signing an unconscionable contract. That revelation comes strangely at a time\n         when all their other false allegations appear to be falling short.\n      14. As a direct result of the CSL, each of the Gibbs has received well in excess of a million dollars,\n         each has had a final judgment against them of over a million dollars retired, and each stands to\n         receive several more million dollars as was pointed out by Ms. Lee in a hearing in the Tarrant\n         County lawsuit when Ms. Lee stated, \"· • · Your Honor, you have to keep in mind, even\n         though it does look like these are assets that have been transferred out of the estate, there are\n         assets that aren't transferred out of the estate.··There currently is a $6.1 million offer on a\n         piece of property, to pay in full, or a $8.5 million installment agreement over the next five\n         years, that will come to the estate of Bert Gibbs· · ·There is a lot of money out there. My\n         clients •• my two clients own 25 percent of the estate. So      if they own 25 percent, they are\n         potentially going to get $2 million. AI Barcroft owns a percentage and Howard Kirk Gibbs\n         also owns - he owns 12.5 percent...So we have a lot of assets for the estate of Bert Gibbs.\"\n         Every single asset that Ms. Lee refers to in this statement would not belong to the Gibbs save\n         for the CSL and the work and money that I invested into the CSL as consideration.\n\n\n\n\n739\n\f      15. Save for Ms. Lee's false allegations and attempts to get her \"share of the pie\", it is my firm\n          belief that there would be no lawsuit.\n\n  FURTHER, AFFIANT SAYETH NOT.\n\n                                             VERIFICATION\n\n  My name is Albert Lynn Barcroft, my date of birth is August 20, 1946, and my address is Rancho\n  Las Brisas, San Marcos, Livingston, lzabal, Guatemala, Central America; and, I declare under\n  Penalty of Perjury that the foregoing statements are true and correct, and not intended to mislead.\n\n  Executed at San Marcos, Livingston, Izabal, Guatemala on the 4th day of November, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n740\n\f              ·--···   .\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                  CAUSE No.       GA 2001-00196\n\n                            IN RE GUARDIANSHIP OF                                                  )              INTHEPROBATECOURT\n\n                            ESTATE OF KATHRYN H.

What happened is\n         5     when this lawsuit was filed, it was filed specifically\n         6     stating that it was for Pentex Foundation not getting\n         7     attorney fees that it was entitled to from -- from --\n\n         8     from the estate of Bert Gibbs.\n\n         9                     Your Honor, you have to keep in mind, even\n        10     though it does look like these are assets that have been\n        11     transferred out of the estate, there are assets that\n        12     aren't transferred out of the estate.                There currently\n\n        13     is a $6.1 million offer on a piece of property, to pay\n\n        14     in full, or a $8.5 million installment agreement over\n\n        15     the next five years, that will come to the estate of\n        16     Bert Gibbs.\n\n        17                     There is a lot of money out there.                     My\n        18     clients -- my two clients own 25 percent of the estate.\n        19     So if they own 25 percent, they are potentially going to\n        20     get $2 million.     Al Barcroft owns a percentage and\n        21     Howard Kirk Gibbs also owns --he owns 12.5 percent.                           So\n        22     we have a lot of assets for the estate of Bert Gibbs.\n        23                     And we filed an amended answer in the\n\n        24     Fannin county case, because what they\n\n        25     allege -- and       what they allege is exactly what\n\n                                      CRC for Wells Reporting\n                                           817-524-6644\n              746                                               e28bd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-\n\f                                                                            3H.n                 PAGE   01\n                                                             FEDEX OFFICE\n                          76B--77'3-0321\n~11/17/2et4\n               €18:€16\n\n\n\n\n                                                NO.

And, Mr. Gibbs, are you\n\n19   affiliated with one of the sides or the other?\n\n20                    MR. GIBBS:   Yes, ma'am, I'm a defendant.     Is\n\n21   that what you mean, Your Honor?\n\n22                    THE COURT:   Well, you're sitting at plaintiff's\n\n23   table.   So, my question is, are you sort of affiliated with\n\n24   them or is that just where the other chair was?\n\n25                    MS. LEE:   No, I requested for him to sit over at\n\n\n\n                            Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                               (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         5\n\n\n\n 1   my table and he wanted to sit over there by them.     You'll find\n\n 2   out --\n\n 3                  THE COURT:    That's fine.   At some point there\n\n 4   will be a division of time, it will be based on the side that\n\n 5   you're affiliated with to some degree.\n\n 6                  MR. SMITH:    I think it's fair to say he's\n\n 7   aligned with my clients in the majority of the relief\n\n 8   requested.\n\n 9                  THE COURT:    Okay.   We have a variety of motions\n\n10   that were filed and we had some filed here at the end that -- I\n\n11   guess, the Court's practice has been a little bit -- well, for\n\n12   lack of a better word -- informal in that the Court's\n\n13   coordinator nor the Court were setting some of the motions or\n\n14   signing the motions for the hearing today.    Though, I'm left\n\n15   with the impression some of the parties may be of the opinion\n\n16   that they were actually being included in today's hearing, and\n\n17   I need to know what the position of the parties are on that\n\n18   issue so we can sort this out.\n\n19                  MR. SMITH:    Judge, if it may help things, I\n\n20   wrote down a summary of what I think is pending based on the\n\n21   order in which they were filed.\n\n22                  THE COURT:    And to the point that I was asking,\n\n23   though, is it your impression that those are live to be\n\n24   addressed, as well, today?\n\n25                  MR. SMITH:    This is my impression.   There's some\n\n\n\n                           Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                              (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                          6\n\n\n\n 1   other things that have been filed --\n\n 2                   MS. LEE:   No.\n\n 3                   MR. SMITH:   Let me finish, please.   Other things\n\n 4   that have been filed that are not set.    This is what I believe\n\n 5   is set for today.\n\n 6                   MS. LEE:   Okay.   I disagree, Your Honor.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:   Okay.\n\n 8                   MS. LEE:   For his list, first -- well, the\n\n 9   motion to quash which concerns -- yes, September 30th.       Also,\n\n10   the October 13th subpoenas that were filed, that is also in his\n\n11   motion to quash which he doesn't have here on his list.       The\n\n12   motion to issue authority, yes; motion to transfer venue; first\n\n13   supplement to motion to show authority, yes; motion to strike\n\n14   intervention that was filed -- that's actually on our notice to\n\n15   -- for the hearing when we first set the hearing.     So, motion\n\n16   to strike intervention is not on his list.    I have the notice\n\n17   for hearing for that, Your Honor.    Motion for leave to file\n\n18   third-party petition, yes.\n\n19                   The thing that's mostly up for dispute is the --\n\n20   well, besides on his list -- we have a motion to strike\n\n21   intervention which should be on this list.    And then the motion\n\n22   for partial summary judgment, I never received notice of, an\n\n23   e-mail.   We have a Rule 11 agreement, Your Honor, which is\n\n24   where we -- for judicial economy and just because of where\n\n25   everybody lives, we had been sending things through e-mail.\n\n\n\n                            Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                               (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         7\n\n\n\n 1   And the Rule 11 agreement provides that if the party does not\n\n 2   respond back stating \"I have received the document,\" that it\n\n 3   needs -- that alternate service needs to be made, meaning it\n\n 4   needs to be faxed or mailed.     And I was never faxed nor mailed\n\n 5   the -- his notice -- his fiat saying that this motion for\n\n 6   partial summary judgment would be heard today.\n\n 7                    And there seems to be -- I mean, I truly did not\n\n 8   receive notice on that to be heard.    And we have enough motions\n\n 9   to be heard anyway.    And I did respond to it only when I was\n\n10   responding -- there was other motions that were filed on the\n\n11   same day I filed my response to motion for partial summary\n\n12   judgment.    I also filed a motion to compel discovery, but\n\n13   that's not being heard today.\n\n14                    And I do have -- for the motion to strike, I\n\n15   believe I do have the notice of hearing which was filed with\n\n16   the Court.    It was -- the one -- the original hearing to be\n\n17   heard was the motion to show authority, the motion to transfer\n\n18   venue, and, I believe, the motion to strike.     And I -- let me\n\n19   check in my folder to see if I happen to have that.\n\n20                    MR. SMITH:   Judge, I do have a serious problem\n\n21   with the motion for summary judgment, the contention of Counsel\n\n22   that she did not get notice of that.    She asked me yesterday to\n\n23   send her the notice.    I did.   She's claiming not to have\n\n24   received it, but I have very high confidence that she did\n\n25   receive it based upon subsequent correspondence.     And this is a\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                            8\n\n\n\n 1   critical motion.    I think how you decide on the motion for\n\n 2   summary judgment will make a lot of this stuff resolve itself.\n\n 3   That's why it's such a critical motion for us to solve.\n\n 4                     THE COURT:    Which would mean it would be very\n\n 5   important to make sure she actually had adequate notice --\n\n 6                     MS. LEE:     Right.\n\n 7                     THE COURT:    -- if it's that significant.\n\n 8                     MR. SMITH:    I've got proof of it.\n\n 9                     MS. LEE:   No, Your Honor, I --\n\n10                     THE COURT:    I guess my point is this:   How much\n\n11   time does she need?\n\n12                     MR. SMITH:    It's been on file for six weeks.\n\n13                     THE COURT:    Okay.   How much time does she need\n\n14   for notice?\n\n15                     MR. SMITH:    She needs 21 days.   I gave her April\n\n16   -- August 21st.\n\n17                     MS. LEE:   Your Honor, I did not receive that.\n\n18   And what he is conferring --\n\n19                     THE COURT:    What is it going to hurt to have 21\n\n20   more days?\n\n21                     MR. SMITH:    What's going to hurt --\n\n22                     THE COURT:    Or, over whatever -- or whatever the\n\n23   amount of time.\n\n24                     MR. SMITH:    I can tell you what it's going to\n\n25   hurt, Your Honor.    When she filed this case in Tarrant County,\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                        9\n\n\n\n 1   she filed a series of lis pendens which has frozen all the\n\n 2   assets that my clients receive in order to fund their defense.\n\n 3   And so, every month that passes by, we're falling further and\n\n 4   further behind and we're looking at risking not being able to\n\n 5   fund our defense because of the lis pendens which has been\n\n 6   filed.\n\n 7                  MS. LEE:    Your Honor --\n\n 8                  MR. SMITH:    And it's a very simple motion.     It's\n\n 9   the crux of this case.    It's how we see the case versus how\n\n10   they see the case.   And I think it's a very simple legal\n\n11   proposition.\n\n12                  THE COURT:    Okay.   Well, and I'm not talking\n\n13   about how simple it is.    You're saying it's a dramatic remedy\n\n14   --\n\n15                  MS. LEE:    Yes.\n\n16                  THE COURT:    -- it's going to define the case.\n\n17                  MS. LEE:    Right.    I --\n\n18                  THE COURT:    Ma'am, if I want you to interrupt, I\n\n19   will ask you to interrupt me.     I understand you're a zealous\n\n20   advocate, but please hold your tongue.      Really?\n\n21                  All right.    I think that it's important that if\n\n22   it's going to be that critical of a motion, that I want to make\n\n23   sure we have solid information whether somebody was served or\n\n24   not and how much time that's going to take.     I'll do everything\n\n25   I can to make sure we get this heard on the 21st day, or\n\n\n\n                              Gale H.

I don't need to have anything overturned on appeal\n\n 3   and redo it again.      So, let's look and see what it is that you\n\n 4   have to demonstrate that there was some notice, if there was in\n\n 5   fact.\n\n 6                       MR. SMITH:    I would be happy to do that, Your\n\n 7   Honor.       Actually, I think it might be important to have Counsel\n\n 8   represent to the Court affirmatively --\n\n 9                       THE COURT:    You need to speak up a little bit.\n\n10                       MR. SMITH:    I'm sorry.    My voice doesn't carry.\n\n11   I think I need to call Counsel for the purpose of establishing\n\n12   notice.\n\n13                       THE COURT:    Okay.   All right.   Ma'am, if you'll\n\n14   raise your right hand.\n\n15                        (Witness sworn by the Court.)\n\n16                       THE COURT:    You may put your hand down.   You may\n\n17   proceed.\n\n18                       MR. SMITH:    Thank you, Your Honor.

And I have a\n\n15   very extensive IT and I had my IT individuals -- this is not --\n\n16   I can assure you this is not a reply to your e-mail.      I replied\n\n17   to this letter.\n\n18                      MR. SMITH:   I'm just asking to offer the\n\n19   exhibits, Your Honor.\n\n20                      MS.

I don't believe\n\n23   this was a reply, but I do believe that this is associated with\n\n24   the August 22nd e-mail, which is what I had responded to.         The\n\n25   August 22nd e-mail is concerning his letter.      So, I do not --\n\n\n\n                                Gale H.

I believe the rest are\n\n12   accurate.\n\n13                      THE COURT:    Okay.   The exhibit will be admitted\n\n14   -- Plaintiff's 16.\n\n15                      MR.

If you look at the last -- Page 7, you responded to\n\n24   that, didn't you?\n\n25        A.     No, that was from your Rule 11 agreement that you had\n\n\n\n                              Gale H.

You can see on the first page of Exhibit 16 it\n\n 5   references the attachment \"Rule 11 agreement.\"      You see that on\n\n 6   the attachment line?\n\n 7        A.   I'm sorry, I don't know where you're at.\n\n 8        Q.   Here on the first page.\n\n 9        A.   Okay.\n\n10        Q.   \"Attachments,\" it says, \"Clerk reappearance, Rule 11\n\n11   agreement, motion for partial summary judgment.\"      You see\n\n12   those?\n\n13        A.   Yes.\n\n14        Q.   Okay.    And in the other letters that are contained\n\n15   within Exhibit 16, there's no other reference to this 30-day\n\n16   extension except in your response on Page 7, is there?\n\n17        A.   Your Rule 11 agreement -- which you did not put here\n\n18   -- which was faxed to my office did have the 30-day agreement.\n\n19                     MR.

Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         14\n\n\n\n 1   Honor, which is attached to Number 3 -- on Page 3, it says,\n\n 2   \"Finally, will you be sending me the Rule 11 agreement I sent\n\n 3   you yesterday?\" -- which is at the bottom.     I had my staff call\n\n 4   his office to inquire about what Rule 11 agreement.      They faxed\n\n 5   me a Rule 11 agreement and that is what was referred to.\n\n 6   Unfortunately, my fax is in my Alaska office and my staff is\n\n 7   not -- I only have one in Alaska.      And she's not available to\n\n 8   retrieve the information from the fax because she is seriously\n\n 9   ill right now, so -- and I only found out about this yesterday.\n\n10   I can assure Your Honor I'm prepared for everything else.     I\n\n11   looked in my spam folder.     I do have a spam that holds e-mails.\n\n12   If I knew this was going to be heard -- even though we have all\n\n13   of these other motions to be heard -- I would have been\n\n14   prepared for it.\n\n15                    THE COURT:   Okay.\n\n16                    MR. SMITH:   I have another exhibit, Your Honor.\n\n17   Mr. Gibbs -- I asked him, he's the pro se -- I asked him to\n\n18   print up the e-mails that he got.      He can affirm this if you'd\n\n19   like.   But I have Exhibit 17, which is what he gave me that he\n\n20   had printed up, which is the e-mail that he received.      And I'll\n\n21   offer that at this time if I may.\n\n22                    THE COURT:   On 17?\n\n23                    MR. SMITH:   Yes, ma'am.\n\n24                    THE COURT:   I'm waiting for her response.   I've\n\n25   heard nothing.\n\n\n\n                            Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                               (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                       15\n\n\n\n 1                   MS. LEE:    It purports to be the same e-mail that\n\n 2   he's saying that he sent to me on Exhibit -- Page 1.\n\n 3                   THE COURT:   Okay.    Exhibit 17 is admitted\n\n 4   appearing no objection.\n\n 5                   MR. SMITH:   And, finally, I would offer that I\n\n 6   do not believe that we were asked to fax any Rule 11 agreement.\n\n 7   Most everything we do -- at least from our side of the case --\n\n 8   is done via e-mail, and that's why I gave you the entire e-mail\n\n 9   traffic during this period of time.     I do believe notice was\n\n10   validly served and we're asking to proceed on the motion for\n\n11   partial summary judgment.\n\n12                   THE COURT:   Okay.    Your response.\n\n13                   MS. LEE:    I actually have the Rule 11 agreement\n\n14   that was signed by all parties, and it specifically states that\n\n15   \"The parties agree to e-mail service of all documents\n\n16   pertaining to the matter and to acknowledge the receipt of the\n\n17   service within one business day by e-mail or fax.      If no\n\n18   acknowledgement of the service is forthcoming from the\n\n19   receiving party within one business day, the service shall be\n\n20   effected in an alternate manner pursuant to Rule 21 of the\n\n21   Texas Rule of Civil Procedures.\"\n\n22                   I did not reply to him, Your Honor.     And he can\n\n23   confirm that I do write back saying, \"Received it,\" \"Got it,\"\n\n24   \"Thank you.\"   And I did not reply.    The only reply that he has\n\n25   is three days later on August 23rd -- or, no, I -- on the next\n\n\n\n                            Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                               (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                           16\n\n\n\n 1   day in which, when I reply, I'm replying to the attached letter\n\n 2   for Number 3 on the very next day that says -- where I say,\n\n 3   \"I've not been in my office all day yesterday and I'm getting\n\n 4   the e-mails now, so I'll be responding hopefully by the end of\n\n 5   the day.\"\n\n 6                   We have filed this Rule 11 agreement, Your\n\n 7   Honor, but I have a copy for you if you would like it.\n\n 8                   THE COURT:    You're welcome to mark it if you\n\n 9   desire to offer it at this part of the hearing.\n\n10                   MS. LEE:   Exhibit A, Your Honor.      May I please\n\n11   approach?\n\n12                   THE COURT:    Opposing counsel?\n\n13                   MR. SMITH:    I have no objection.\n\n14                   THE COURT:    Admitted.   All right.    Ms. Lee, what\n\n15   is the configuration of your office?      How do you run your\n\n16   business?\n\n17                   MS. LEE:   I have two offices, Your Honor.      I\n\n18   have one in Alaska and one in Texas.      The one in Alaska is my\n\n19   main office with my server.    Anyone who works for me logs into\n\n20   that server.   That's where my faxes come in to.       I have\n\n21   currently one staff in Alaska, two staff in Texas, but they\n\n22   remote in.   So, everything is done out of my main Alaska\n\n23   office.   When I file documents, we file them through Federal\n\n24   Express overnight from Alaska.\n\n25                   THE COURT:    So, where do you reside?\n\n\n\n                            Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                               (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         17\n\n\n\n 1                     MS. LEE:   My permanent residence is in Alaska,\n\n 2   Your Honor.\n\n 3                     THE COURT:   But you live down here?\n\n 4                     MS. LEE:   I do have a place here, Your Honor,\n\n 5   yes.   And my office in Fort Worth is more of a satellite\n\n 6   office.    I do not have staff there.\n\n 7                     THE COURT:   But you have two people associated\n\n 8   with the Texas office?\n\n 9                     MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.   One of them is\n\n10   located in India and one of them -- she's just there for the\n\n11   military.    She's an attorney -- and the other one is in College\n\n12   Station.\n\n13                     THE COURT:   So, how do you get your\n\n14   correspondence?\n\n15                     MS. LEE:   If it comes to my Texas office, they\n\n16   scan it in and they send it to me.      All e-mails, obviously,\n\n17   will come to my e-mail address that I can access anywhere in\n\n18   the world.    I can log into my server.    I also have it on my\n\n19   iPhone.    So, if Mr. Smith serves me with anything, it goes to\n\n20   my Texas office.    They scan it in and send it to my Alaska\n\n21   office, and then when I'm in town I will take the originals.\n\n22   Or, if I need them to ship to me, I'll have them ship it.\n\n23                     THE COURT:   Do you have anyone else that handles\n\n24   your e-mails for you or you handle them directly yourself?\n\n25                     MS. LEE:   I handle them myself, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n                              Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                 (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                           18\n\n\n\n 1                   THE COURT:    Okay.   And what is the notice\n\n 2   regarding the family medical leave -- how does that play into\n\n 3   where you're spending your time or what you're doing for work\n\n 4   right now?\n\n 5                   MS. LEE:   I spend a lot of time in Texas because\n\n 6   my father is very ill right now.      Opposing Counsel is aware of\n\n 7   that.\n\n 8                   THE COURT:    All right.    Now, anything further on\n\n 9   this point, Mr. Smith?\n\n10                   MR. SMITH:    No, Your Honor.    No.    I'm sorry.\n\n11                   THE COURT:    Anything further, Ms. Lee?\n\n12                   MS. LEE:   Concerning the motion for partial\n\n13   summary judgment, Your Honor?\n\n14                   THE COURT:    Yes.\n\n15                   MS. LEE:   No.    Well, no, Your Honor -- if we're\n\n16   just talking about me receiving notice, then, no.\n\n17                   THE COURT:    Correct.     That's all I'm talking\n\n18   about.   We haven't argued any motions.\n\n19                   All right.    So, when are you saying that you\n\n20   actually received notice of this service?\n\n21                   MS. LEE:     Yesterday.    I received the document,\n\n22   Your Honor, when he provided it to me in August.        I did not\n\n23   receive notice of the hearing until yesterday.         And the only\n\n24   way -- the reason I received notice was because the very\n\n25   beginning of his response to my -- or his objections to my\n\n\n\n                              Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                 (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         19\n\n\n\n 1   response, it stated that I did not file it and it's supposed to\n\n 2   be heard today.    And that was the first time I became aware of\n\n 3   it, through his filing.\n\n 4                     THE COURT:   Okay.   What we're going to do is,\n\n 5   we're going to take up the summary judgment motion at another\n\n 6   time.   We need to pick that time.     I don't have the benefit of\n\n 7   having the Court's coordinator at this location.      Let me make\n\n 8   that contact because this issue needs to be firmed up.\n\n 9                           (A break was taken.)\n\n10                     MR. SMITH:   I was going to try to get your\n\n11   attention before you get off the phone.      Counsel is actually\n\n12   supposed to be in the State for depositions the 13th, 14th, and\n\n13   15th.   She's indicated she is willing to waive the 21-day\n\n14   requirement if you want to do it during that period of time.\n\n15   I'm okay with that.\n\n16                     THE COURT:   I have a capital murder case\n\n17   starting that day.\n\n18                     MR. SMITH:   That seems to take precedence.\n\n19                     THE COURT:   It will probably take us all day to\n\n20   pick on Monday.    We're doing questionnaires.    Unless the\n\n21   parties want to come in on Tuesday at 8 a.m.      And then I need\n\n22   to know how long you expect to argue your motion for summary\n\n23   judgment.   I can accommodate you if you can be here at 8.      I\n\n24   would expect you be done within an hour's time.\n\n25                     MR. SMITH:   I can certainly be done in an hour's\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                        20\n\n\n\n 1   time.   There will be objections, no doubt.    And that will take\n\n 2   more time than the actual motion.     But I think an hour would be\n\n 3   more than enough time.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:    Is that sufficient time for both\n\n 5   sides to finish up their case?\n\n 6                   MS. LEE:   If he's willing to do it in an hour,\n\n 7   then we'll do it in an hour.\n\n 8                   THE COURT:    Okay.   Then we'll do it October 14th\n\n 9   at 8 a.m.\n\n10                   MR. GIBBS:    Your Honor, I have a previous work\n\n11   engagement.   I wanted to come up here for the hearing but I do\n\n12   have a previous engagement.    May I have leave of the Court,\n\n13   please?\n\n14                   THE COURT:    Yes.\n\n15                   MR. GIBBS:    Thank you.\n\n16                   THE COURT:    For the purposes of the summary\n\n17   judgment motion, sir, you can appear by phone if you want.\n\n18   Otherwise, we'll expect you also to have had notice of the\n\n19   setting based on the fact that I'm setting it in court.\n\n20                   MR. GIBBS:    Yes, ma'am.\n\n21                   THE COURT:    So, you won't receive anything else\n\n22   in writing as far as the Court is concerned.     But October 14th\n\n23   at 8 a.m. we'll have the motion for summary judgment.\n\n24                   MR. GIBBS:    Does that mean I need to be here,\n\n25   Your Honor?\n\n\n\n                              Gale H.

GIBBS:    Yes, ma'am.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:    You'll need to make those\n\n 5   arrangements.   Thank you.\n\n 6                   All right.    Let's step through the other motions\n\n 7   that we have.   We have the motion to show authority, motion for\n\n 8   change of venue.\n\n 9                   MS. LEE:     Yes, Your Honor.\n\n10                   THE COURT:    Do the parties think those are\n\n11   appropriate to take up initially?\n\n12                   MS. LEE:     Yes, Your Honor.   Also, I've conferred\n\n13   with opposing Counsel, and the motion to strike was\n\n14   inadvertently left off.     That should be on the list, as well.\n\n15   Motion to strike intervention.\n\n16                   MR. SMITH:    I believe it should have been set,\n\n17   yes, Your Honor.\n\n18                   THE COURT:    Okay.\n\n19                   MR. SMITH:    I tried to be inclusive.    It was set\n\n20   for original filing, which included the motion to show\n\n21   authority as I recall.     The intervention was filed later.\n\n22                   MS. LEE:     June 23rd.\n\n23                   MR. SMITH:    Yeah, it's properly set.\n\n24                   MS. LEE:     And if, Your Honor, we're going by\n\n25   dates, I think that would be Number 2.      So, that would be after\n\n\n\n                              Gale H.

I'm looking at the document\n\n 3   filed on April 25th, motion to show authority, motion for a\n\n 4   change of venue, others.      Is that one of the documents you all\n\n 5   are talking about or have you had amended pleadings since then\n\n 6   on that?\n\n 7                    MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.    I believe there's\n\n 8   also a first supplement to the motion to show authority, as\n\n 9   well.\n\n10                    THE COURT:    Okay.   I have first supplement to\n\n11   motion to show authority filed on September 29th, 2014.        Is\n\n12   that the document you're referring to?\n\n13                    MS.

We\n\n20   shipped it out on -- prior to that.      Should have received it\n\n21   Friday.    But, yes, Your Honor, that would be the document.\n\n22                    THE COURT:    Okay.   Are you expecting that this\n\n23   is supposed to replace the other or is it actually serving to\n\n24   supplement?\n\n25                    MS.

Then I'm looking at the\n\n 2   June 18th filing of the original petition and intervention.\n\n 3   And I am assuming that that's the petition or motion that's\n\n 4   being objected to or challenged.\n\n 5                    MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.\n\n 6                    MR. SMITH:   No.\n\n 7                    THE COURT:   You're saying, no, you have a\n\n 8   supplemental one?\n\n 9                    MR. SMITH:   No, I think the motion to show\n\n10   authority was dealing with the original petition that was filed\n\n11   by Pentex Foundation.\n\n12                    MS. LEE:   I believe she's -- what she's\n\n13   referring to is my -- Your Honor, you're referring to my motion\n\n14   to strike?\n\n15                    THE COURT:   Yes.\n\n16                    MS. LEE:   Yes.\n\n17                    MR. SMITH:   It would be that petition and\n\n18   intervention, yes, Your Honor.\n\n19                    THE COURT:   Okay.   I just want to make sure I\n\n20   have my hands on the documents we're talking about.     All right.\n\n21   I'll receive some input on the motions that y'all want to\n\n22   address first.\n\n23                    MS. LEE:   Your Honor, I think the motion to show\n\n24   authority should be first.    Potentially some housekeeping\n\n25   concerning some subpoenas to -- that I sent out -- which\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         24\n\n\n\n 1   documents have not been provided to me.     That could be very\n\n 2   brief before the motion to show authority.\n\n 3                  THE COURT:    All right.\n\n 4                  MR. SMITH:    Your Honor, it's my position that\n\n 5   the motion to show authority is not properly before the Court.\n\n 6   You probably don't see a whole lot of these.      I don't know if\n\n 7   you're familiar with the Rule but I brought a copy for you.\n\n 8                  THE COURT:    Thank you.\n\n 9                  MR. SMITH:    I have a copy for Counsel, as well.\n\n10   It does require that the motion be sworn.      And this motion --\n\n11   until the first supplement on the 25th, there's not even a hint\n\n12   of an affidavit.   And the affidavit that we got does not -- is\n\n13   not sufficient for what is required.      And I've got a case law\n\n14   to show you, Your Honor.    It's the Townsend case out of\n\n15   Beaumont last year.    It says -- and this is coming right from\n\n16   Rule 12 -- \"requires a sworn statement that the movant believes\n\n17   the suit is being defended without authority.\"      I've got a copy\n\n18   of the affidavit that Counsel submitted to tender to the Court,\n\n19   and all it does is authenticate certain documents.      It doesn't\n\n20   trigger the motion to show authority because Counsel has not\n\n21   stated under oath that the suit is being prosecuted or defended\n\n22   without authority.    Without that, it's not properly before the\n\n23   Court.\n\n24                  THE COURT:    Okay.   Your response.\n\n25                  MS. LEE:    It's throughout the entire document,\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                       25\n\n\n\n 1   Your Honor.   It's throughout all the documents that this is --\n\n 2   they do not have authority.    That this case has been filed --\n\n 3   that is not only in my motion to show authority, but it is in\n\n 4   every single document that we have filed with this Court --\n\n 5   almost every single document that we have filed.     That he --\n\n 6   that Scott Smith is pursuing this case without the authority of\n\n 7   Pentex Foundation -- without the board of Pentex Foundation.\n\n 8   It's throughout -- and so, the affidavit is certifying the\n\n 9   authenticity of the documents that are provided to show that\n\n10   the authority was not appropriately obtained by Mr. Smith nor\n\n11   by Mr. Skotnik when they were hired.     And I do have both of my\n\n12   defendants here who have filed multiple affidavits with this\n\n13   Court and could also profess that this is being filed without\n\n14   authority.\n\n15                   THE COURT:    Okay.   But do you have a sworn\n\n16   motion is his point.    The Rule --\n\n17                   MS. LEE:   All you have -- it's my understanding,\n\n18   Your Honor, that we have to provide an affidavit and I did\n\n19   provide an affidavit.\n\n20                   THE COURT:    Okay.   Well, have you looked at what\n\n21   he's saying the Rule says and what's been printed out?\n\n22                   MS. LEE:   Well, the Rule provides that a sworn\n\n23   written motion, and that was supplemented in my first\n\n24   supplement, Your Honor.\n\n25                   THE COURT:    So, you're saying you filed the\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                          26\n\n\n\n 1   affidavit?\n\n 2                    MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.    It's the affidavit\n\n 3   that he had provided to you, Your Honor.       But, again, I have my\n\n 4   clients here.    We are swearing that he has -- he is prosecuting\n\n 5   this case without authority.     And I can assure you that the\n\n 6   evidence will show that.\n\n 7                    THE COURT:   Well, I'm not ready to hear that\n\n 8   part.    We've got to get over this hurdle.     So, show me --\n\n 9                    MR. SMITH:   Additionally, Your Honor -- I'm\n\n10   sorry.    I don't mean to interrupt.    It does require ten days\n\n11   before the hearing.     And we got this -- I got it on the 25th,\n\n12   you got it today or yesterday.    So, that's not even timely even\n\n13   if it was sufficient.    So, there's a twofold problem here.\n\n14                    MS. LEE:   I don't believe that it does provide\n\n15   it has to be -- you have to have notice of the hearing ten days\n\n16   before the hearing.     The notice was given out in, I believe,\n\n17   June.    This has been on the docket since June.\n\n18                    THE COURT:   Okay.    It says, \"The notice of the\n\n19   motion shall be served upon the challenged attorney at least\n\n20   ten days before the hearing on the motion but the motion must\n\n21   be sworn to.\"    So, was it sworn to?    It sort of presupposes the\n\n22   swearing to the motion will have happened first and then we've\n\n23   got ten days' notice for the hearing.      Are you saying it\n\n24   happened in that order?\n\n25                    MS. LEE:   No, Your Honor.    The motion was\n\n\n\n                              Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                 (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                        27\n\n\n\n 1   originally --\n\n 2                    THE COURT:   I mean, we wanted to make sure we\n\n 3   gave you the time --\n\n 4                    MS. LEE:   Absolutely.\n\n 5                    THE COURT:   -- on the motion for partial summary\n\n 6   judgment, so, in all fairness, don't you think that Mr. Smith\n\n 7   should have time --\n\n 8                    MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:   -- I mean, consistent with the\n\n10   Rules?    I mean, if we're going to play by the rules on one\n\n11   side, we need to play by the rules on the other, don't you\n\n12   think?\n\n13                    MS. LEE:   That's why I'm not really arguing it,\n\n14   Your Honor.\n\n15                    THE COURT:   Okay.   All right.   So, then it would\n\n16   seem that the parties need to address this motion at a time\n\n17   when you have sufficient notice, or are you trying to use it\n\n18   now as a defensive measure to say it shouldn't get to be raised\n\n19   at all?\n\n20                    MR. SMITH:   Absolutely, Your Honor.   It's here,\n\n21   it's set.    And if it's not set properly, it should be\n\n22   dismissed.\n\n23                    MS. LEE:   Your Honor, I have a lot of case law\n\n24   that -- and even in -- I think Mr. Smith can also inform you\n\n25   that he was able -- in another court hearing concerning a\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         28\n\n\n\n 1   motion to show authority, that he was able to get an extension\n\n 2   to provide additional information.     And even though I could\n\n 3   have argued the exact same thing -- the motion was prime and\n\n 4   ready to be heard -- that it should not be heard and should be\n\n 5   dismissed with prejudice, but that's not what -- and I know\n\n 6   that court's ruling is not precedence on your court.     I'm just\n\n 7   letting you know if we're all going to play fair, he was able\n\n 8   to get an extension for that court hearing to provide\n\n 9   additional information.   I'll be more than happy to supplement\n\n10   those again, get it to this Court tomorrow, next day, and we\n\n11   can have it set on the 13th or another day that is mutually\n\n12   appropriate.\n\n13                    MR. SMITH:   And this is the problem, Your Honor.\n\n14   This is a side show.   We can't get to the meat of the matter if\n\n15   we're playing games with side shows.     We did have a hearing in\n\n16   Tarrant County in July.   And we produced all the information\n\n17   requested in July and August.    We produced about 500 pages of\n\n18   documents, a lot of which supports --\n\n19                    THE COURT:   So, are you ready to go forward on\n\n20   the motion now, Mr. Smith?\n\n21                    MR. SMITH:   I'm not prepared to go forward\n\n22   because it's not properly before the Court.\n\n23                    THE COURT:   Okay.   Well, we can't have it both\n\n24   ways.   I can't give you everything when it's just the ruling\n\n25   that you want.   I mean, if you want to have me rule on it, she\n\n\n\n                            Gale H.

If you want to have the time you need,\n\n 2   then I'll give you the time you need.       You said you already\n\n 3   presented to one, it would seem you would be prepared.\n\n 4   However, if you're not prepared because you did not have\n\n 5   notice, I'm happy to give her the time that she needs.         Which\n\n 6   way do you want it?\n\n 7                     MR. SMITH:    I would prefer to have it properly\n\n 8   set with the supporting affidavit.\n\n 9                     THE COURT:    Okay.   Well, let's do that, then.\n\n10   Okay.   So, what -- when do y'all want to hear it?      I cannot\n\n11   stack multiple hearings on the 14th.       I will be distracted with\n\n12   another matter.    Okay.     I can't have this many hours put into\n\n13   this hearing at that time.       I want to give you the time that\n\n14   you need.   We can set this before that hearing because that one\n\n15   was set for 21 days out.\n\n16                     MS. LEE:    Your Honor, did you say that -- when\n\n17   you had spoken to the clerk -- that you had time on the 20th,\n\n18   or what days were you looking at?\n\n19                     THE COURT:    I was asking about the 20th.    It\n\n20   would be another 8 a.m. start.       The jury trial, we expect that\n\n21   mini-cap to run through the next week.       There's a chance that\n\n22   it would not.     But I would need to start at 8 a.m. on that\n\n23   Monday, the 20th.\n\n24                     MR. SMITH:    I can do it then, Your Honor, but I\n\n25   am set for a jury trial in the 15th District Court.       My guess\n\n\n\n                                Gale H.

Well -- but if we start this\n\n 4   case -- if we start this at 8 a.m., we wouldn't actually have\n\n 5   priority but we would do everything we could to get you out of\n\n 6   here.\n\n 7                    MR. SMITH:   I'm already set.    I can't make it.\n\n 8   That's a jury trial setting.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:   Right.    But having this at 8 a.m.\n\n10   would be earlier than the 8:30 or 9:00.\n\n11                    MR. SMITH:   It's virtually impossible to\n\n12   complete this in an hour.     She subpoenaed several witnesses for\n\n13   this.\n\n14                    THE COURT:   Okay.    Then when -- what works for\n\n15   you?    You don't want it put off.\n\n16                    MR. SMITH:   I'm just saying I can't double-set\n\n17   it if I can't be able to call and tell the Court I'm going to\n\n18   be in a jury trial.\n\n19                    THE COURT:   Right.    I mean, I don't think that's\n\n20   a good use of anybody's time.    You're telling me that your\n\n21   clients want this heard now.    If you want to put it off, I'll\n\n22   be happy to give you a different day.      What timeframe -- what\n\n23   timeframe would you like?\n\n24                    MR.

A contract for sale for land, which is the whole --\n\n18   which is why we're in front of this Court -- was drafted and\n\n19   it's an undisputed fact drafted by an individual, Allen\n\n20   Barcroft, who is not an attorney.

Venue motions are\n\n 9   based upon venue facts pleaded and affidavits, not testimony.\n\n10   So, I would object to anything outside the record.\n\n11                    THE COURT:   What's your response to that, Ms.\n\n12   Lee?\n\n13                    MS. LEE:   I believe -- I have to look at my\n\n14   documents, but I believe that I have the information in my\n\n15   actual motion, Your Honor.\n\n16                    THE COURT:   Is it filed in the form of affidavit\n\n17   or something that supports --\n\n18                    MS. LEE:   No, Your Honor, it's in my motion.     I\n\n19   can move on.    I have other arguments I can argue.\n\n20                    THE COURT:   Okay.   So, there's no evidence to\n\n21   support that.    We'll move on.\n\n22                    MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.    Okay.   So, Mr. Smith\n\n23   provides -- so, this is a mandatory venue provision in the\n\n24   contract because the contract -- there's a five-million-dollar\n\n25   potential buyout.   And he provides that -- according to Rule\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                       33\n\n\n\n 1   15.020(a) of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code -- that \"A\n\n 2   major transaction means a transaction by written agreement\n\n 3   under which a person pays or receives or is obligated to pay or\n\n 4   receive or entitled to receive consideration of more than a\n\n 5   million dollars.\"\n\n 6                     Well, a five-million-dollar buyout provision is\n\n 7   not a provision in which a person has to pay or receive or is\n\n 8   obligated to pay or receive.    His argument is that because it's\n\n 9   a major transaction, that the venue is proper because the\n\n10   document provides that the venue should be in Fannin County,\n\n11   Your Honor.    So, our first argument is that it is not a major\n\n12   transaction.   If you look at the contract for sale, what was\n\n13   exchanged was 21 gold coins in exchange for 30-percent interest\n\n14   into an estate.    Even though I am not -- I'm not certain on\n\n15   what the coins are, they're certainly not worth a million\n\n16   dollars.   Then if you also look at Section 15.020(d) of the\n\n17   Civil Practice and Remedies Code, it provides that \"Any section\n\n18   in a contract that applies an action that is unconscionable at\n\n19   the time that it was made, then that venue provision is not\n\n20   respected.\"\n\n21                     So, again, we have 21 gold coins for 30 percent\n\n22   of the estate.    Which, I believe, a rough estimate, they\n\n23   received maybe several-hundred-thousands of dollars --\n\n24   certainly not a million.    And certainly having a\n\n25   five-million-dollar buyout provision, that seems quite\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                      34\n\n\n\n 1   unconscionable to me.   I'll give you 21 coins.     In order to get\n\n 2   out of this contract, you have to give me five-million dollars.\n\n 3                  So, Section 15.035 states that \"A contract in\n\n 4   writing\" -- \"If a person has contracted in writing to perform\n\n 5   an obligation in a particular county, expressly naming the\n\n 6   county\" -- which is exactly what this contract states -- \"then\n\n 7   the obligation may be brought against him in the county in\n\n 8   which he signed the document or in which the client or the\n\n 9   individual is domiciled.\"    All of the defendants are in Tarrant\n\n10   County; the notary was in Collin; the contract for sale was\n\n11   recorded in Denton County.    But, again, it says \"Fannin County\"\n\n12   on the document.   It is not a major transaction.    So, contrary\n\n13   to opposing party, it's not mandatory because it's not a major\n\n14   transaction.\n\n15                  Now, it also provides in (b) of that provision\n\n16   exactly what I had stated, that if a person pays money arising\n\n17   out of transactions or services entitled primarily for\n\n18   personal, family, household, or agricultural use, then that's\n\n19   where the lawsuit should be -- which should be in Collin County\n\n20   or Tarrant County.\n\n21                  Besides those arguments, Your Honor, John\n\n22   Skotnik who originally filed the document -- he filed the\n\n23   document and he is a municipal court judge.    Also, Mr. Skotnik\n\n24   is, I believe, a municipal judge, as well.    May not be in this\n\n25   county, may be in Grayson County.

There's no\n\n 2   connection to this contract for sale in Fannin County.       It was\n\n 3   recorded in Denton.    The individuals have always lived in\n\n 4   Tarrant.    It was signed in Collin County.    And it's just from\n\n 5   the -- from the convenience of the drafter to say it was in\n\n 6   Fannin County.\n\n 7                    So, we respectfully request that this Court --\n\n 8   that this hearing be moved to another county.      And as Your\n\n 9   Honor will no doubt hear multiple times, there is another\n\n10   lawsuit in Tarrant County that's being heard.      It's similar to\n\n11   this case.    It has almost the same players, but it's concerning\n\n12   the actual money that was into a trust.\n\n13                    So, the contract for sale provided that an\n\n14   entity would be created.      That entity is allegedly the GWB\n\n15   trust.    That lawsuit is in Tarrant County.    We would like to\n\n16   consolidate the cases, but of course the cases can't be\n\n17   consolidated once the cases have been transferred.      So, my\n\n18   clients would like this to be transferred to Tarrant County,\n\n19   and if not, then as 15.35 -- I'm sorry -- 15.035(b), it should\n\n20   be either in Tarrant County or in Collin County where it was\n\n21   signed.    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n22                    MR. SMITH:    Well, the reason I wanted to stick\n\n23   to what was filed is because I think what they filed is\n\n24   different from what you just heard, Your Honor.      The motion to\n\n25   transfer venue before the Court is Pages 3 and 4 of the initial\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                          36\n\n\n\n 1   filing they made.    And what they did was, they filed a motion\n\n 2   to transfer for the convenience of the parties.       It's not a\n\n 3   mandatory venue election they're making.       It's not a permissive\n\n 4   venue if they're saying that they can't get a fair trial here,\n\n 5   prejudice in this county is so great they cannot get a fair and\n\n 6   impartial trial.    That's what they're telling this Court is the\n\n 7   basis for why they want their venue changed.       In response, we\n\n 8   did file -- I don't know if you found our response to the\n\n 9   motion to transfer venue.\n\n10                   THE COURT:   I did.   Let me lay my hands on it.\n\n11                   MR. SMITH:   Essentially, we attached the\n\n12   contract that's really the basis of this whole lawsuit and the\n\n13   one in Tarrant County.    I have an extra copy if you'd like it.\n\n14                   THE COURT:   Well, I'll lay hands on it.     I have\n\n15   it.   The one filed September 4th?\n\n16                   MR. SMITH:   Yes, Your Honor.\n\n17                   THE COURT:   Yes, sir.\n\n18                   MR. SMITH:   What we did is, we have attached the\n\n19   actual contract at issue.    And there is a venue provision.       It\n\n20   does specify venue in Fannin County, Texas.       And I've given you\n\n21   the law that says in the instance where it involves in excess\n\n22   of -- I think it's one-million dollars -- that's considered a\n\n23   major transaction.    This contract has a specific buyout of\n\n24   five-million dollars.    Therefore, by its very expressed terms,\n\n25   it does involve a major transaction.     Under that circumstance,\n\n\n\n                              Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                 (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                           37\n\n\n\n 1   the venue provision in the contract prevails and is not only\n\n 2   permissive, it is mandatory.      I don't think there's any doubt\n\n 3   that this Court has venue and should not transfer venue.\n\n 4                    And just as an aside, the case filed here in\n\n 5   Fannin County was the first filed case.         The case in Tarrant\n\n 6   County was filed second.      So, I don't have a player in that\n\n 7   suit.    I have not participated in those proceedings, but I do\n\n 8   know this is the earlier-filed suit.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:     You have a response, Ms. Lee?\n\n10                    MS. LEE:   I would like to point out that when\n\n11   John Skotnik -- who is the municipal court judge -- when he was\n\n12   the attorney for the defendants, that's when the argument was\n\n13   that there would be a great prejudice in this county, Your\n\n14   Honor.    We did not amend that motion.     But I would just like to\n\n15   reiterate one more time that the law is very clear, it provides\n\n16   that a major transaction is if a person is obligated to pay or\n\n17   entitled to receive consideration in more than one-million\n\n18   dollars.    A buyout provision is not an obligation, it is a\n\n19   buyout.    And that's 15.020.    So, the venue here is not\n\n20   mandatory.   And if you go to -- that's all I want to say, Your\n\n21   Honor.\n\n22                    THE COURT:     Okay.   Does either party have any\n\n23   information about the value of the 21 gold coins filed with\n\n24   anything?\n\n25                    MR. SMITH:     I don't know.    I can represent to\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                       38\n\n\n\n 1   the Court that the estates are large estates and I would not be\n\n 2   surprised if there were over a million dollars easily in those\n\n 3   estates that are at issue.\n\n 4                   MS. LEE:    I would disagree, Your Honor.\n\n 5                   THE COURT:   I'm sure there's substantial money\n\n 6   involved.   The question is regarding the actual transaction\n\n 7   that is evidenced by the contract that was signed, not about\n\n 8   the estates, necessarily.    I understand they might be part of\n\n 9   that, but -- I don't see anything that indicates that all of\n\n10   the estates were involved in this contract.\n\n11                   MS. LEE:    They weren't, Your Honor.\n\n12                   THE COURT:   The difficulty is I don't have any\n\n13   information indicating the value of the 21 gold coins.      I mean,\n\n14   depending on what they were.    If they came from a particular\n\n15   shipwreck, they could be worth a million dollars easy.\n\n16                   MR. SMITH:   There's other consideration\n\n17   expressed in the contract.\n\n18                   THE COURT:   Okay.   Well, based on the other\n\n19   information in the case, the Court is going to grant the motion\n\n20   to transfer venue.   I don't like that because I know I can\n\n21   probably resolve this case more quickly than you can get it\n\n22   done over in the neighboring county.    So, personally, I think\n\n23   it would be more efficient here but I think it's appropriate\n\n24   given where the defendants reside and that I don't have any\n\n25   evidence that this is a case that involves more than a million\n\n\n\n                            Gale H.

And have the clerk's office be notified of this and\n\n13   for you all to work with them to get it transferred as\n\n14   expeditiously --\n\n15                     MS.

I would think it would be a court of the same\n\n24   jurisdiction as this one.       I'm assuming they have civil\n\n25   jurisdiction courts, as well as -- I don't think they have that\n\n\n\n                             Gale H.

If\n\n 3   they have a general jurisdiction court -- I don't think that I\n\n 4   make the call.   I think what happens is it's just a category of\n\n 5   courts.    As long as they have civil jurisdiction, it will go\n\n 6   into that court.    It might end up being a general jurisdiction\n\n 7   court if Tarrant County has any of those left.      And it will\n\n 8   otherwise go into one that is strictly civil.      The clerk -- I\n\n 9   would assume -- would assign that randomly.      And then the\n\n10   parties will make their arguments over there if they desire to\n\n11   have those combined and what other court.      That would be for a\n\n12   different court to make that decision, not this court.        All\n\n13   right.    Is there anything else that needs to be addressed?\n\n14                    MS.

Then the other matters\n\n18   will no longer have any setting on the Court's docket and the\n\n19   order has been signed.

Even if it was, again page 3, section 3.26(a) of the FSA is\nclearly permissive, using the word \"may.\" · Section 3 .26(b) follows and states\ncertain potential results if a \"beneficiary\" is determined to have engaged in\ncertain conduct. I ask again, is it your position that the Pentex Foundation\nand/or the GBU Trust are a \"beneficiaries?\"\n\n      Finally, will you be sending the Rule 11 agreement I sent to you\nyesterday?

However, the two (2) cases are separate and\ncannot be comingled. The Fannin County case is against the Estate of Bert Hughes Gibbs\nbecause the only person who could determine the attorney fees is Ken as Independent\nAdministrator of the Estate (the \"Estate\").\n\nBecause the FSA involves the Estate, mediation must occur in Tarrant County. We will set this\nas soon as possible, even though I am on family medical leave act (\"FMLA\"). As I have\npreviously stated, your client will be responsible for its share of the fees associated with the\nADR. As my client believes that the Fannin County lawsuit is a farce, and since you have done\nnothing but assist Howard Kirk Gibbs, Howard Kirk will be invited to participate in this ADR.\nIf you see any issue with approaching ADR in this manner, please let me know as soon as\npossible. You and Howard Kirk can provide me a list of three (3) mediators in Tarrant County,\nand I will let you know Ken's choice. That seems fair. If you prefer a different way to choose the\nmediator, please let me know.\n\nRegarding the discovery requests from Ken to Pentex and GBU Trust: The respective due dates\nof September 10 and 11, 2014, were oversights on my part. I apologize for scheduling the\nproduction during your leave. After much persuasion, under the circumstances, Ken will agree to\nan extension. However, a thirty- (30-) day extension is excessive. Would either Pentex or GBU\nTrust have agreed to a thirty- (30) day extension for my client? Based on developments thus far,\n\fAugust 25, 2014\nPage2\nKen fully anticipates that your clients will object to all discovery requests, provide him with\nnothing, and that a motion to compel will be necessary.\n\nMy client feels that a fifteen- (15-) day extension is more than reasonable, especially since your\nleave is planned for only a little more than a week in early September. Therefore, Ken will\nextend the production deadline for both Pentex and GBU Trust to 5:30p.m., Monday, September\n25, 2014, provided that both Pentex and GBU Trust will agree in a Rule 11 Agreement that the\nhearing September 30, 2014, is to be postponed until after the mediation (or a mutually agreed\nupon date). Ken has no issue with rescheduling the hearings on September 30th as soon as\npossible, as we are sure the docket is filling up in Fannin County. We also have other motions\nthat will be filed very shortly and we would like those to be heard on the same day as well.\n\nUnder the circumstances, Ken's new deadline is very generous. As I am sure you realize, Ken\nhas no reason to trust you and does not, in fact, want to offer you any concessions at all,\nespecially since it was revealed that you agreed to represent Beverly Miller in Tarrant County.\nEven Judge Ferchill was shocked at the disturbing news that you accepted the $50,000 retainer\ndrawn from a GWB Family and Friends Trust bank account. Of course, we have no verification\nthat you did return the money. Under the circumstances, Ken will not provide a longer extension\nthan fifteen (15) days for discovery.\n\nDue to yours and your client's past and very recent actions, Ken has very little faith that your\nclients will participate in good faith in the mediation, so we need to schedule a time for\ndepositions for Joshua Unger, Danny Unger, AI Barcroft, and the mysterious person who signed\nthe engagement letter. When can I schedule the various parties, including AI, for depositions? If\nyou want to continue to state that you do not represent AI, please put that in writing, yet again.\nObviously, having these depositions back to back would be preferable and please have AI\nBarcroft give all the information he has about Pentex Foundation to Danny Unger, since AI has\nalways been the legal representative of Pentex Foundation (or as Beverly Miller has testified that\nPentex Foundation is AI) and Danny Unger needs to give Joshua Unger all the information\nconcerning GBU Trust, as Danny Unger was the initial trustee.\n\nPlease forward me a Rule 11 Agreement to the extension of discovery and postponing the\nSeptember 30th hearing until after the mediation (or call the court and lets agree to a date).\nPlease provide me all the dates in which you are not available in September and October, and I\nwill get the mediation scheduled as soon as possible. I suspect it will take the entire day. If you\nbelieve otherwise, please let me know. Also, please provide me a list of \"complaints\" that your\nclient has about Ken's administration of the Estate, and also provide my office with a settlement\noffer or solutions prior to one (1) week to mediation.\n\n                                                     Very truly yours,\n                                                     LAW OFFICES OF CHRISTY LEE, P.C.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     Christy L.

I have spoken with opposing counsel prior to\n\n16   the hearing about a procedural issue,            which I believe\n\n17   that must be addressed prior to listening or hearing\n\n18   the motion to reconsider.\n\n19                   THE COURT:       Which is what?\n\n20                   MS.   LEE:     It is -- under the Rule of 87,\n\n21   Section five of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,\n\n22   this Court does not have the power to hear a motion to\n\n23   reconsider on venue,         and I have the law and -- I have\n\n24   case law and statute,        Your Honor,     if you'd like for me\n\n25   to approach.\n\f                                                                              6\n\n\n\n 1                   THE COURT:      Have you already shared that\n\n 2   with Mr.   Smith?\n\n 3                   MS.   LEE:    No,   Your Honor.        I    just found\n\n 4   out about this -- Mr.        Smith about half a day prior --\n\n 5   half a business day prior to this hearing,                  he provided\n\n 6   me with a 41-page reply which cited to section -- to\n\n 7   Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 87.            So,   I       just became\n\n 8   aware of this as -- as of this morning,                Your Honor.\n\n 9   But I do have copies for him,           as well as your court if\n\n10   you\n\n11                   THE COURT:      Okay.\n\n12                   MS.   LEE:    If I may have permission to\n\n13   proceed.\n\n14                   THE COURT:      Okay.\n\n15                   MS.   LEE:    May I please approach,            Your\n\n16   Honor?\n\n17                   THE COURT:      You may.\n\n18                   MS.   LEE:    The Texas Rule of Civil\n\n19   Procedure 87,   Determination of Motion to Transfer,\n\n20   Section five,   specifically states that if an action\n\n21   has been transferred to a proper venue,                which this\n\n22   Court      it has happened on September 28th -- in\n\n23   response to a motion to transfer,           then no further\n\n24   motions to transfer shall be considered,                unless the\n\n25   motion to transfer is based on two things.                   One is the\n\f                                                                       7\n\n\n 1   grounds that an impartial trial cannot be had under\n\n 2   Rules 257 and 259,      which opposing party has not\n\n 3   asserted,   or on the ground of mandatory venue,       which\n\n 4   opposing party did assert in the first motion -- in\n\n 5   the first response to motion for transfer.         This rule\n\n 6   continues to provide that those two exceptions are\n\n 7   only allowed provided that such a claim was not\n\n 8   available to them at the time.\n\n 9                   And,    Your Honor,   I have a copy of their\n\n10   motion       their response to the motion to transfer\n\n11   venue,   and that is exactly what they argued at the\n\n12   last court hearing was a mandatory -- it was a\n\n13   mandatory venue provision.        Then I have case law,     Your\n\n14   Honor.     There's also Marathon Corporation versus\n\n15   Pitzner,    and I've highlighted --your Honor,      may I\n\n16   approach?\n\n~7                   THE COURT:     Yes.\n\n_s                   MS.    LEE:   It's at very back of this case.\n\n19   It's footnote number six.        It cites Texas Rule of\n\n20   Civil Procedure just as I've cited to you,        Your Honor,\n\n21   and then it also states that a motion to reconsider\n\n22   transfer of venue was not proper under the rules,           and\n\n23   a hearing should not have even been granted.         Then I\n\n24   have other cases,      Your Honor.    I have Van Es versus\n\n25   Frazier,    Dorchester Master Limited Partnership versus\n\f                                                                            8\n\n\n\n 1   Anthony,    In Re Shell.       And they all provide that a tax\n\n 2   court has the authority to make                 I'm sorry.    Tax\n\n 3   Court,   sorry.     Trial court has the authority to make\n\n 4   only one venue determination.\n\n 5                     And even a case,        In Re Medical Carbon\n\n 6   Research,      and that says,     rule -- venue selection and\n\n 7   Rule 87,    Section five of the Texas Rules of Civil\n\n 8   Procedure does not permit consideration of a motion to\n\n 9   transfer venue.         A trial court has the authority to\n\n10   make only one venue determination.              And this talks\n\n11   about,   because any reconsideration of an order denying\n\n12   the motion to transfer would be void,                that even today\n\n13   if it's even heard,        that it would be voided.          And I do\n\n14   have some of these cases available,             Your Honor,       if you\n\n15   would like to see them.\n\n                       THE COURT:\n\n17                     MS.   LEE:     Okay.    May I approach,    Your\n\n18   Honor?\n\n19                     THE COURT:       Yes.    Anything else on this\n\n20   point,   Counsel?\n\n21                     MS.   LEE:     No,   Your Honor.\n\n22                     THE COURT:       All right.     Your response,\n\n23   Mr.   Smith.\n\n24                     MR.   SMITH:     Yes.    It certainly would've\n\n25   been nice to know this beforehand; however,                I am\n\f                                                                             9\n\n\n\n 1   familiar with Rule 87.5,      and you've got to read it\n\n 2   fairly careful because there's two triggers for this\n\n 3   rule to be applied.       The first says,      If venue has been\n\n 4   sustained against a motion to transfer -- that's not\n\n 5   us -- or if an action has been transferred to a proper\n\n 6   county.   That's where we would fall under.              That --\n\n 7   and the reason there's two different ones is because,\n\n 8   until the file is actually transferred,           this rule\n\n 9   doesn't kick 1n.\n\n10                  And this file has not actually been\n\n11   transferred.   That's one of the reasons we got our\n\n12   motion for reconsideration in fairly promptly was so\n\n13   that we could have it intercept the actual act of\n\n14   transferring the file.        And I can see and would hope\n\n15   the Court would make a judicial notice finding that\n\n16   the Court's file appears to still be here in Fannin\n\n17   County,   so it has not actually physically been\n\n18   transferred yet,     so ...\n\n19                  THE COURT:      Okay.       I've got my file.        I\n\n20   think there would always be a copy here,               but I don't\n\n21   see anything indicating the clerk has done any\n\n22   physical transfer of the file.\n\n23                  MR.   SMITH:    So,   if,    in fact,    it has not\n\n24   physically been transferred,         this is still a proper\n\n25   motion.    And the reason for that is obvious.              So we\n\f                                                                            10\n\n\n 1   can correct any errors if there are -- if,              in fact,       we\n\n 2   can convince the Court there was an error made before\n\n 3   we make an effort to make a petition for writ of\n\n 4   mandamus.      So,   we believe the Court does have\n\n 5   jurisdiction and that you can proceed forward with a\n\n 6   motion.\n\n 7                    MS.   LEE:     Your Honor,    I      I would just\n\n 8   like to --\n\n 9                    MR.   SMITH:     I'm sorry.       One other\n\n10   thought.\n\n11                    MS.   LEE:     Sure.\n\n12                    MR.   SMITH:     In the cases that she's given\n\n13   me,   I   just looked through them real quick.           Every one\n\n14   of these are cases where the motion was denied under\n\n15   that first clause.        So,    that -- when the motion's\n\n16   denied and the order is entered,          that does keep you\n\n17   from filing a motion for reconsideration.               And the\n\n18   reason for that is this:          Under the old rules where we\n\n19   didn't have the statute granting mandamus relief for\n\n20   mandatory venue,       you did not have the right to appeal\n\n21   venue decisions,       and so,    once the order's entered\n\n22   denying it,     you can have your right on appeal and have\n\n23   your remedy later.        But when you've got a situation\n\n24   such as we have where a mandamus is available,                 if we\n\n25   can get to the Court and convince you of the error of\n\f                                                                          11\n\n\n 1   your ruling,       if you agree with us,          that saves\n\n 2   everybody time,          money,    and judicial resources.\n\n 3                      THE COURT:        Okay.\n\n 4                      MS.    LEE:     Your Honor,    there is one other\n 5   case.\n\n 6                      THE COURT:        Okay.\n\n 7                      MS.    LEE:     Besides reiterating that the\n\n 8   case that I did provide -- it specifically states that\n\n 9   a motion to reconsider is not appropriate and that\n\n10   you're only entitled to one bite at the apple.\n\n11   There's also another case which asserts to some of his\n\n12   other arguments.           Can I please approach the bench,\n\n13   Your Honor?\n\n14                      THE COURT:        Yes.\n\n15                      MS.    LEE:     This one is In Re Chester,    and\n\n16   there were so many important parts in this,                I did not\n\n17   highlight it.       But it specifically provides that after\n\n18   30 days of hearing the motion -- after an order is\n\n19   signed,     that the Court lacks plenary power to rule on\n\n20   a motion to reconsider.             And it was very clear that\n\n21   after 30 days -- and,             in this case,    it was a matter\n\n22   of,   I   think,   32 days when the Court heard a motion to\n\n23   reconsider concerning a change of venue,                and it was a\n\n24   mandatory provision in the agreement,                and the Court\n\n25   ruled that it did not have authority because of\n\f                                                                          12\n\n\n 1   judicial economy and they wanted to make it quite\n\n 2   quick in order to have it heard in another -- in the\n\n 3   appropriate venue.\n\n 4                     So,   that Court asserts     (sic)    Mr.    Smith's\n\n 5   arguments that if there's an error -- and so,                  the\n\n 6   Court does have the power if there was an error,\n\n 7   which,   of course,      we don't believe there was an error,\n\n 8   within 30 days.         And from the research that I did\n\n 9   and I will state that it was not extensive due to the\n\n'0   time constraints and because I was not made aware of\n\n 1   this until I received the reply from Mr.               Scott    (sic),\n\n 2   which,   again,   was half a business day prior to this\n\n_3   hearing,   that there's no extension to the 30 days.\n\n14   So,   this Court only had 30 days if they felt that\n\n15   there was an error.         So,   it is my client's opinion\n\n16   that the Court does not have the power or the\n\n17   authority to even rule on a motion to reconsider the\n\n18   change of venue.\n\n19                     MR.   SMITH:    Again,   looking at this very\n\n20   quickly,   this Chester case looks like the motion was\n\n21   -- I'm going to strike that because I haven't read it\n\n22   carefully.    I don't want to misrepresent it to the\n\n23   Court.\n\n24                     THE COURT:      Okay.    I have two thoughts on\n\n25   this.    I would have liked to have had the hearing\n\f                                                                              13\n\n\n 1   sooner.     I'm uncertain of why it took the time it did.\n\n 2   I know in the past there's some difficulty of having\n\n 3   the appearance of counsel on certain days,                 so we had\n\n 4   gone through quite amount of pain to make sure we were\n\n 5   accommodating people on that.               I don't know if that\n\n 6   factored into this.\n\n 7                      MR.   SMITH:      I believe it did.        Ms.   Reamy\n\n 8   actually set this hearing,              I think,   when Ms.   Kreider\n\n 9   was out of town,         and Ms.    Lee was not available,          and I\n\n10   accommodated her schedule is what I recall.\n\n11                      MS.   LEE:      I was available within the 30\n\n12   days,    Your Honor,      but he had a trial and he had,             I\n\n13   think,    a CLE.\n\n14                      THE COURT:       So, you're saying he can\n\n15   accommodate your schedule,              but you're not going to\n\n16   accommodate his for purposes of the 30 days?\n\n17                      MS.   LEE:     Oh,   my gosh,   no,   Your Honor.\n\n18   It was set for this day only because he had other --\n\n19   he had other issues.            I mean,    he had pending cases,         as\n\n20   I believe maybe a CLE,            or he had a trial.       I wasn't\n\n21   sure.\n\n22                      THE COURT:       Do you think there's a -- do\n\n23   you think there's a timeframe for correcting the\n\n24   Court's ruling by way of mandamus?                 You think he can't\n\n25   do that after he's filed this motion?\n\f                                                                           14\n\n\n 1                     MS.   LEE:    Absolutely.     He -- he has --\n\n 2   there's that avenue.           He is able to file a mandamus,         I\n\n 3   believe.\n\n 4                     THE COURT:      So,    if it was outside the 30\n\n 5   days and I don't rule on it,             the higher court has the\n\n 6   ability to mandamus me and make me do it,               but you're\n\n 7   saying I don't have the ability to hear the case\n\n 8   myself and correct a mistake.\n\n 9                     MS.   LEE:    No,    Your Honor.     I please stand\n\n10   corrected.       From my understanding from the research I\n\n11   did -- and like I stated,             it was not extensive -- if\n\n12   it's outside the 30 days,             there is not -- there's not\n\n13   a discretion.       That -- that was my understanding.\n\n14   Again,    I   -- I did not do extensive research on that.\n\n15   If you would like to-- I'd just like that for the\n\n16   record.       We can proceed.         I believe that we went on\n\n17   the merits of the case.\n\n18                     THE COURT:      Okay.     Well,    let's -- let's\n\n19   go ahead and have the hearing.              If the higher court\n\n20   wants to do something different,             they have the ability\n\n21   to correct anything that I've made a mistake on,\n\n22   because I think it's important to try to get it done\n\n23   right the first time,          and that's why I granted the --\n\n24   the hearing opportunity on the motion to reconsider.\n\n25   I'm going to overrule the objection to having the\n\f                                                                                15\n\n\n\n 1   hearing based on the fact that this is a -- this is,\n\n 2   in my opinion,       to reconsider if I have missed\n\n 3   something legally that is required.                And,    therefore,      I\n\n 4   want to go ahead and proceed with the reconsideration\n\n 5   of the motion to           of the motion,        itself,    to transfer\n\n 6   the venue.     So,     you may proceed on your request,\n\n 7   Mr.   Smith.\n\n 8                    MR.    SMITH:      Thank you,    Your Honor.        And\n\n 9   for the clarity of the record for what we just\n\n10   discussed,     is it the Court's finding that there has\n\n11   not been a physical transfer of the file?\n\n12                    THE COURT:         Yes.\n\n13                    MR.    SMITH:      Thank you.     And I appreciate\n\n14   you having a hearing on this,              Your Honor.     After the\n\n15   last hearing,      clearly, we disagreed with the Court's\n\n16   ruling on venue.        That's what courts are for.             We\n\n17   understand that.        But we looked at our remedies and we\n\n18   saw that there is a statute that allows mandamus on a\n\n19   mandatory venue ruling.          And so,      before we went to\n\n20   that effort, we thought it would be prudent to come\n\n21   back to the Court and see if we could re-examine the\n\n22   ruling to see if,        in fact,    we are correct.\n\n23                    Now,    what is this?        This is not a new\n\n24   motion.    We could not even bring another motion for\n\n25   venue.    Venue,     as you know,      is determined as a matter\n\f                                                                       16\n\n\n\n 1   of primary       it's a primary determination.     You\n\n 2   determine venue before you move on to other things,\n\n 3   and,   because of that,    the hearing that we had on\n\n 4   September 30th was a fixed date for evidence.        And I\n\n 5   say this because the response which was filed by the\n\n 6   defendants brought in a bunch of new evidence,       and we,\n\n 7   ln turn,   felt like we had to respond with that with\n\n 8   our reply.    I really don't think that's important\n\n 9   because the facts that we are going to be arguing\n\n10   about were fixed on September 30th.       We're simply\n\n11   asking that you re-examine those facts because I think\n\n12   that's sufficient to make a ruling that we can all\n\n13   live with.\n\n14                  So,   what was the venue evidence that was\n\n15   before the Court?     And I'll take you to Rule 87.3,         and\n\n16   it may actually be ln what Counsel handed out.           I\n\n17   don't know.    But what it says is, All venue facts when\n\n18   properly pleaded shall be taken as true unless\n\n19   specifically denied by the adverse party.        And what\n\n20   did we have when we came here on September 30th?             We\n\n21   had attached the contract to the petition.        It was\n\n22   asserted in the petition that all parties agreed in\n\n23   writing that any dispute would be performable in\n\n24   Fannin County,    Texas.\n\n25                    In the response to the motion for venue,\n\f                                                                          17\n\n\n\n 1   we attached the contract once again and specifically\n\n 2   pleaded paragraph four which references the\n\n 3   liquidated-damages provision of $5 million,               and none\n\n 4   of this was ever denied.           So,    those facts by rule were\n\n 5   taken as true.\n\n 6                   Now,    I've got a case here,         a copy for\n\n 7   Counsel.    What I've done is I've excerpted the\n\n 8   paragraph of the contract at issue.\n\n 9                   THE COURT:        Thank you.\n\n10                   MR.    SMITH:     And then there's a case\n\n11   called Spin Doctor.        That's actually the case name.\n\n12   I'm not making light of the fact that it's called Spin\n\n13   Doctor.    And what it says is,           you look at the face of\n\n14   the document.       You don't look outside the document.\n\n15   You look at the face of the document.                And this is\n\n16   what the statute says,          too.     And,   in Spin Doctor,    the\n\n17   agreement says,       The agreement attached to the motion\n\n18   to transfer venue lists annual sales of over $1\n\n19   million.    Thus,     on its face,       it constitutes prima\n\n20   facie evidence of a major transaction within the\n\n21   statute.\n\n22                   And I ' l l be candid with you,         Your Honor,\n\n23   there's not a whole lot of cases talking about what a\n\n24   major transaction is.           There's very few,      and the ones\n\n25   that do,   mostly just parrot the statute.              But I\n\f                                                                        18\n\n\n 1   thought this was a pretty compelling one,             because it\n\n 2   says you look at the four corners of the document,                and\n\n 3   if it references consideration in excess of a million\n\n 4   dollars,    the inquiry    lS    over.   Your prima facie case\n\n 5   is met.\n\n 6                   Here,    this contract says,     the liquidated\n\n 7   damages,    should you breach,       is $5 million,    and that\n\n 8   says it's in full settlement of all consideration on\n\n 9   the Gibbs'    claims.     Now,    why is that important?     I've\n\n10   got another handout.        I've cited the statute here,          and\n\n11   it says,    basically,    if consideration is at a stated\n\n12   value of excess of one million,           that's a major\n\n13   transaction.\n\n14                   I said, Well,       what is -- what is\n\n15   liquidated damages action doing for us?            So,   I pulled\n\n16   the supreme court case of Flores,           and it says,\n\n17   Liquidated damages refers to an acceptable measure of\n\n18   damages that parties stipulate to in advance that will\n\n19   be assessed in the event of a contract breach.\n\n20   the parties here stipulated to a specified amount --\n\n21   $5 million -- and said this is adequate consideration\n\n22   for this contract in the event of a breach.              Thus,    on\n\n23   its face,    the contract says it's in excess of a\n\n24   million dollars.\n\n25                   I also note that these type of clauses\n\f                                                                           19\n\n\n 1   are favored in the courts.              The supreme court has said\n\n 2   in 2006 that we encourage these type of clauses\n\n 3   because the parties,           by gosh,   they know what they're\n\n 4   doing,    they should be able to give effect to their own\n\n 5   agreements.     And so,        the Texas law encourages\n\n 6   enforcement of these agreements.\n\n 7                   So,     for all these reason,         Your Honor,    we\n\n 8   believe this is a major transaction; we believe that\n\n 9   it's,    on its face,    in excess of a million dollars; we\n\n10   believe the Texas law encourages enforcement of these.\n\n11   We believe that we came at you pretty fast and furious\n\n12   in the last hearing and maybe that wasn't made very\n\n13   clear,    but we feel like you have an opportunity to\n\n14   restore venue to Fannin County,             Texas,    the county\n\n15   where the parties stipulated and agreed venue should\n\n16   be,   and that we can move on down the road with this\n\n17   litigation.     Thank you for your time.\n\n18                   THE COURT:         Thank you.\n\n19                   Counsel.\n\n20                   MS.   LEE:       Yes,   Your Honor.     And I also\n\n21   have some cases,      Your Honor.         The first one -- may I\n\n22   please approach?\n\n23                   THE COURT:         Certainly.    Thank you.\n\n24                   MS.     LEE:     In Re Togs Energy specifically\n\n25   states,    Your Honor -- it states obviously the statute,\n\f                                                                          20\n\n\n 1   the 15 --    the 15.020.        But here's the -- with all due\n\n 2   respect to Mr.    Scott,    I    don't think he understands the\n\n 3   concept of the consideration.           It is very clear that\n\n 4   in the contract,      it has to have a     aggregated stated\n\n 5   value,    and in the agreement in every case,            even the\n\n 6   one that he cites -- the Spin Doctors -- Your Honor,\n\n 7   it stated that it was a million dollars.             There's no\n\n 8   case that says that liquidated damages,            which is a\n\n 9   buy-out provision,       is considered an obligation to pay.\n\n10                   The actual provision for a major\n\n11   transaction is that a person pays,          receives,      or\n\n12   obligated -- obligated -- to pay or receive.                You are\n\n13   not obligated to pay liquidated damages.\n\n14   Consideration with an aggregated stated value,                  and as\n\n15   Mr.   Smith stated,     it has to be in the four corners of\n\n16   the contract.     You actually have to have that amount\n\n17   of money for over a million dollars.             It has to be\n\n18   stated.     It cannot be,       how much could that possibly\n\n19   be.\n\n20                   Also,    ln In Re Togs Energy,      it stated\n\n21   that affidavits or anything else is absolutely\n\n22   irrelevant.     They're not even going to consider it\n\n23   because it does not       -- because it doesn't contain a\n\n24   major transaction in an affidavit.           I   mean,   you only\n\n25   look to what the contract states.\n\f                                                                            21\n\n\n\n 1                      Now,    again,   in the Spin Doctors Golf as\n\n 2   co-counsel -- opposing counsel has already talked\n\n 3   about,    Your Honor,       they quote the agreement as listed\n\n 4   annual sales of over a million dollars,              and the Court\n\n 5   held,    as he said,       the prima facie evidence of a\n\n 6   transaction.        But they leave out extremely important\n\n 7   language.        The Court in Spin Doctors emphasized that\n\n 8   Paymentech,       by contrast to the Texas Association of\n\n 9   School Boards case,          was obligated to pay.      They\n\n10   absolutely had to pay the funds to Spin Doctor as it\n\n11   received data from the credit card sales.               Paymentech\n\n12   did not assume any risk.            No risk.    No liquidated\n\n13   damages.     Nothing.        It was an absolute obligation.\n\n14   The written agreement actually said that the credit\n\n15   card sales was valued at about 5 million.               That was\n\n16   the obligation to pay.\n\n17                      Once again,      our case is very different\n\n18   because Al Barcroft,          when he signed -- drafted and\n\n19   signed the contract for sale,           he assumed a risk,       and\n\n20   the buy-out provision did not create an obligation.\n\n21   Now,    Candy,    Ken,    and Howard Kirk,     they didn't have to\n\n22   buy him out.        I mean,    again,   it's a buy-out provision,\n\n23   so he may never have received anything.               As do we\n\n24   point out on paragraph six of Howard Kirk Gibbs'\n\n25   affidavit in the opposing parties'              reply, Al was\n\f                                                                         22\n\n\n 1   taking a big risk.       That's what he states.         He's\n\n 2   taking a big risk to help us.         So,   again,    a risk with\n\n 3   no obligation that was created for the Gibbs to have\n\n 4   to pay him anything.       They've not cited to any case,\n\n 5   showed any obligation that there's more than $1\n\n 6   million that needs to be paid.\n\n 7                   So,    we need to talk about,        like,    what is\n\n 8   consideration,    because I think that seems to be an\n\n 9   issue here.     Consideration is what -- is the something\n\n 0   that you receive in return and each side promises to\n\n11   pay.   So,   in the contract for sale, Al Barcroft\n\n12   promised to give his silver coins,           21; his services,\n\n13   which included providing legal services; and acquire\n\n14   legal counsel at his own expense.            This was not\n\n15   valued,   Your Honor.     There was no value in the\n\n16   contract.     Those three things were his consideration.\n\n17   That is what has -- those have to be valued.                 And then\n\n18   the 30 percent of absolutely everything that my client\n\n19   -- and I will go through that in a minute.              But the 30\n\n20   percent of everything that Ken,        Candy,    and Howard Kirk\n\n21   were possibly going to get from the Gibbs,             that was\n\n22   their consideration.       And,   again,    Your Honor,      that was\n\n23   not provided for.       There was no value on that one.\n\n24                    So,   on the face of the document,           there is\n\n25   no -- I mean,    I have the Spin Doctors case.               I read it\n\f                                                                            23\n\n\n 1   extensively.    Again,    ln that agreement,         it stated that\n\n 2   the total sales were 5 million.              That was in the\n\n 3   contract.    There is not one case -- and I            can say that\n\n 4   wholeheartedly because I have read every single case\n\n 5   to my knowledge concerning a motion to transfer and\n\n 6   major transaction.       There's not one case concerning a\n\n 7   buy-out provision or liquidated damages that require\n\n 8   an obligation to pay,          and,   therefore,   make it a major\n\n 9   transaction.\n\n10                   Now,    Your Honor,        in the alternative,    if\n\n11   you believe -- if the Court believes that the $5\n\n12   million liquidated damages or the affidavits and the\n\n13   checks and other things that they're alleging to be\n\n14   true -- if you believe that that happens to be a\n\n15   million dollars and,          therefore,    a major transaction,\n\n16   there is       in the alternative,          I'd like to argue that\n\n17   there is an exception to the mandatory venue\n\n18   provision.     That is Section 15.020(d)\n\n19                   MR.    SMITH:     And,   Judge,    this is where I\n\n20   was talking earlier about this is getting outside the\n\n21   scope of our hearing because we're not starting a new\n\n22   hearing.     We're examining the hearing that we had,             and\n\n23   this evidence of brought forward new after the fact.\n\n24   So,   we would object to the presentation.\n\n25                   MS.    LEE:     Your Honor,     this is exactly\n\f                                                                                 24\n\n\n 1   what I    argued in my other hearing.                 Identical.     I've\n\n 2   not changed my argument.\n\n 3                     THE COURT:      I'm going to allow for the\n\n 4   argument.       I won't allow for anything outside of what\n\n 5   had been argued the last time.                    You may proceed.\n\n 6                     MS.    LEE:   So,    the -- that provision\n\n 7   states that a mandatory venue provision does not apply\n\n 8   to an action if the agreement is -- was unconscionable\n\n 9   at the time it was made.              We          our two arguments,\n\n10   which we argued before,          was,       it was grossly one-sided\n\n11   and the unauthorized practice of law.                       And Al Barcroft\n\n12   drafted the contract for sale for his own accord,                        and\n\n13   he's the beneficiary.           He would receive something as a\n\n14   benefit.       The grossly one-sided argument is 21 junk\n\n15   coins which my client has -- which we did discuss at\n\n16   the last hearing            21 junk coins that happen to be of\n\n17   nominal value -- we don't know what the value is,                        Your\n\n18   Honor,    at that time          and,       in exchange,       he would\n\n19   he would receive -- Al Barcroft would receive a whole\n\n20   lieu   (sic)    of things including inheritances from any\n\n21   form that were received by my clients now and in the\n\n22   future.     It's in the contract.                 It's actually in\n\n23   paragraph one.          There's about,        I    think,    seven to nine\n\n24   different things of what he's going to receive in\n\n25   exchange for what he provided.\n\f                                                                        25\n\n\n 1                   So, practicing law without a license is\n\n 2   considered a misdemeanor           a Class-A misdemeanor\n\n 3   and also,    in my opinion,     considered fraud.       The courts\n\n 4   are very clear that you can't draft a contract in\n\n 5   which you're going to be -- draft a contract as a\n\n 6   practicing law without a license and reap a benefit\n\n 7   from it.\n\n 8                   And my clients -- my clients and the\n\n 9   defendant live in Tarrant County.             Everything is in\n\n10   Tarrant County.       Absolutely everything.         There is\n\n11   nothing that is here.          Even the -- and to my-- I'm\n\n12   not quite       well,   the defendants,       I don't even think\n\n13   they live in Fannin County.         And they could.         You can\n\n14   correct me if I'm wrong.         But everybody is in Tarrant\n\n15   County,    and the appropriate venue is Tarrant County.\n\n16                   THE COURT:       All right.     Thank you.\n\n17                   Any final rebuttal?\n\n18                   MR.   SMITH:     Your Honor,    I   really feel\n\n19   like I need to respond to some of that,             but I   feel\n\n20   like it's outside the record for what we're doing\n\n21   today.     I could spend a fair amount of time rebutting\n\n22   what she just said,      all of which was contained in her\n\n23   response that she filed after you transferred the case\n\n24   or after you have entered the order,            because what they\n\n25   actually filed beforehand was four paragraphs in their\n\f                                                                               26\n\n\n 1   original answer,        none of which talk about what she's\n\n 2   talking about.         It talked about being inconvenient.\n\n 3   It didn't talk about unconscionable contracts.\n\n 4                      I really hate to get into that because I\n\n 5   think it's a red herring,           and I    think I ' l l stand by\n\n 6   what I   said;   and,    that is,    you look at the four\n\n 7   corners of this contract,           it's stating an aggregate\n\n 8   value,   and the reason that is,            is to make sure we have\n\n 9   a major transaction,        and it states the venue -- the\n\n10   parties'   agreement to have venue in Fannin County,\n\n11   Texas,   and so,    unless you want to hear a response to\n\n12   that reply         or a reply to that response,             I ' l l lay\n\n13   that with the Court's file.\n\n14                    THE COURT:      Okay.       My focus has been on\n\n15   whether the buy-out provision that the $5 million\n\n16   stated is an obligation or not.               Is there any\n\n17   anything else that you would offer there,               Mr.     Smith,\n\n18   to clarify?      An obligation of the contract.\n\n19                    MR.    SMITH:   Yes.       I mean,   I'm       I may be\n\n20   repeating myself,        but it says that liquidated damages\n\n21   are created by the parties to ascertain the amount of\n\n22   the contract when it's difficult to come up with an\n\n23   amount of the contract.          That's what they did here.\n\n24   The law encourages liquidated damages.                It's stated in\n\n25   black and white on the contract,              so I believe that's\n\f                                                                          27\n\n\n 1   an obligation to pay as stated in the 15.020.\n\n 2                   THE COURT:     Okay.     Okay.    The    I   I\n\n\n\n\n 3   having reconsidered my order,          will make the ruling\n\n 4   that the venue in this case should not be transferred\n\n 5   to Tarrant County.      We need to go ahead and get a\n\n 6   scheduling order in place and pick some dates certain.\n\n 7   There were some motions that were filed and we need to\n\n 8   address that.\n\n 9                   MS.   LEE:   Your Honor,    I will be filing a\n\n10   mandamus.\n\n11                   THE COURT:     I figured I'd get it one way\n\n12   or the other,   so -- both of y'all are very articulate\n\n13   and very good advocates,      and I'm happy to have a\n\n14   higher court review this as we might need to go along\n\n15   our way.\n\n16                   MS.   LEE:   So,   Your Honor,    I respectfully\n\n17   request not to get back on the docket or scheduling so\n\n18   I can get that filed.\n\n19                   THE COURT:     Well,    what I want to do is,           I\n\n20   want to go ahead and pick the dates before y'all walk\n\n21   out,   and then in the event you file it,          which I have\n\n22   no doubt you will -- but when you do,            then it will\n\n23   abate our hearings until they actually take the action\n\n24   that they might need to take.           And they're very,        very\n\n25   quick about these matters,         and I would expect,       then,\n\f                                                                        28\n\n\n 1   whatever we had scheduled that got abated would be\n\n 2   just reinstituted.        So,     I'd like y'all to pick dates\n\n 3   that are reasonable.\n\n 4                     MS.   LEE:     And,   Your Honor,   just for\n\n 5   clarification,     did you          is it your determination\n\n 6   that that buy-out -- the $5 million liquidated damages\n\n 7   is -- makes it a mandatory venue?\n\n 8                     THE COURT:       That was the part that I was\n\n 9   focusing on last time.           When I made the decision to\n\n10   transfer it,      I was -- I have reconsidered that,         but\n\n11   any provision that allows or provides for the matter\n\n12   based on the limited evidence that was presented to\n\n13   the Court -- I'm trying to make the decision based on\n\n14   the contract that was there,            which I   think is all I\n\n15   can make it on.         Not all of the extraneous evidence\n\n16   that everybody is offering after the last ruling,\n\n17   so ...\n\n18                     MR.   SMITH:     I will prepare an appropriate\n\n19   order and circulate it to Counsel.\n\n20                     THE COURT:       Okay,   what I want y'all to\n\n21   do,   then,    is go ahead and pick those dates with the\n\n22   Court's coordinator,           and then when we get the other\n\n23   motion -- so,      if you'll pick them to be reasonable\n\n24   dates that might happen to be outside of about 30 to\n\n25   45 days,      which is probably about how long the Court\n\f                                                                        29\n\n\n 1   will take to make this ruling.\n\n 2                   MR.   SMITH:   Are you asking us to pick a\n\n 3   trial date and move forward or just dates for the\n\n 4   hearings that we had set before?\n\n 5                   THE COURT:     Both.    I   think we need an end\n\n 6   date that the parties can expect.           This matter's been\n\n 7   a bit protracted for a variety of reasons,             the least\n\n 8   of which is not -- it is the fact that it's a\n\n 9   complicated case,     and I understand that.          There's a\n\n10   lot at stake and a lot of emotion.           I   think the\n\n11   parties need to get the thing resolved,            and that is\n\n12   one thing that we can accomplish is getting some\n\n13   closure.\n\n14                   MR.   SMITH:   Well,   Your Honor,      we have\n\n15   discussed -- I know you ordered mediation last time.\n\n16   We've discussed mediation and it hasn't really gotten\n\n17   any traction.     It might be helpful if you order us to\n\n18   mediation.\n\n19                   THE COURT:     Okay.    I would also expect\n\n20   you still select the final hearing date,            the pretrial\n\n21   date.   The Court will order mediation,           and I ' l l\n\n22   appoint Judge Curt Henderson.          He's a retired judge\n\n23   from the 219th District Court.          You can get online and\n\n24   he -- you can electronically set up the date certain\n\n25   that you want to select.       He'll meet down in Collin\n\f                                                                               30\n\n\n 1   County,   so i t ' l l be in between the two locations to\n\n 2   some degree.       And he has the most years service as a\n\n 3   judge in Collin County's history,              so he will be very\n\n 4   knowledgeable.          I think when he took          either when he\n\n 5   took the bar exam or the board certification exam,                    he\n\n 6   got the top score in the State of Texas that year.                        He\n\n 7   should prove to be very informed,              very helpful,       and he\n\n 8   is,   in my opinion,      young.      He is,   I think,     60   or 61.\n\n 9                     MR.    SMITH:     Thank you for finding that,\n\n10   Your Honor.\n\n11                     THE COURT:        That's young.     So,    it's not\n\n12   like he's -- you know,            he's going to be on it and he's\n\n13   up-to-date with technology issues and things of that\n\n14   nature.    So,   all of your communication -- he does a\n\n15   lot electronically,         and he drafts final mediation\n\n16   agreements,      I think.       He's very good about letting us\n\n17   know.\n\n18                     We need to pick a mediation deadline\n\n19   date,   as well.        I'd like the parties to have that\n\n20   accomplished within -- 120 days should give the higher\n\n21   court the time they need to rule.                Do y'all think\n\n22   that's reasonable,        120 days?      Four months out?\n\n23                     MR.    SMITH:     Certainly.\n\n24                     MS.    LEE:     That's fine.\n\n25                     MR.

So,   I   think that's\n\n 3   all of the parties.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:        Okay.     So,   I need to make\n\n 5   sure all of the parties have all of this information\n\n 6   before they go.     I want everybody to know.              Nobody\n\n 7   needs to be in the dark.          We need to go ahead and get\n\n 8   some resolution for everyone.             And so,     when you see\n\n 9   the Court's coordinator,          before anybody leaves,\n\n10   they're going to receive those dates.                 It will be the\n\n11   final hearing date.     If it's a jury,           which I'm\n\n12   assuming,    we'll go ahead and put it on the jury trial\n\n13   docket.     We'll have -- pretrial will be aboui a month\n\n14   preceding that.     Pick a timeframe that y'all think is\n\n15   reasonable to accommodate your issues of discovery\n\n16   that you might have,    and we will do everything that we\n\n17   can to give your case the highest priority.\n\n18                   Every case that's set on the civil docket\n\n19   1s likely       they all resolve,          so your case is likely\n\n20   to be the one that goes,          so don't think it's going to\n\n21   get reset.     It will be the one that goes,             so pick a\n\n22   real date,    a meaningful date for you.              Have the\n\n23   mediation about 120 days out,             and include in the order\n\n24   that you submit on the scheduling order a separate\n\n25   document appointing Judge Henderson so we can get that\n\f                                                                   32\n\n\n 1   off to him ASAP,     and he'll know to expect you all to\n\n 2   contact him.   But the way you'll contact him is\n\n 3   directly yourselves electronically on his website.\n\n 4   Ms.   Kreider can give you the information on how to\n\n 5   contact him.\n\n 6                  MR.   SMITH:   May Mr.   Gibbs come back with\n\n 7   us?\n\n 8                  THE COURT:     Absolutely.    All right.

Albert's plan was that by\n\n      the time the I.R.S. caught up with his own specialized version of the trickle-down theory, Albert\n\n      would be long gone to Central America.\n\n              14.      Scott is aware that Albert deliberately engages in fraud and that he illegally\n\n      drafted the CSL. By seeking protection for Albert in tenns of the deposition while still\n\n      maintaining that Albert is not his. client, Scott knowingly furthers Albert's    e~orts   to elude\n\n      justice, in violation of Texas Rules of Evidence Rule No. 503(d)(1).\n\n              15.      Albert's defense that he is too ill to travel is blatant subterfuge, designed to\n\n      protect Albert from exposure to this suit, including the deposition. The statement provided by\n\n      Albert's alleged physician, Leoncl Montenegro, did not declare that Dr. Montenegro examined\n\n      Albert, only that Albert's medical file was in the office, and that the statement was presented at\n\n      the request of an interested party. See Exhibit D. Albert has a history of faking health issues to\n\n      avoid legal action. For instance, in or around November 30, 2009, Albert was said to have faked\n\n      a heart attack in order to avoid prosecution for not cleaning the wreckage of his $500,000 yacht,\n\n      The Great Escape, which ran agrpund off the Coast of Belize and fouled its pristine barrier reef.\n\n      News reports from Channel 5 of Belize quoted Newspaper Editor Roy McNett, who stated that\n\n      he spoke with Albert following the accident According to Roy, Albert \"did not have a heart\n\n      attack,\" and at that time was buying land in Rio Dulce.

The location is obviously convenient to Pentex's\n\n      Counsel, and the date was offered as available by Pentex's Counsel. There can be no place and\n\n      time more convenient for the deposition.3\n\n              17.      Pentex's resistance to the Subpoena is because Albert and Pentex have a great\n\n      deal of infonnation that each wistt.es to bide, as it promises to affect the outcome of this suit\n\n      adversely. Albert is a crucial elem~nt in the events addressed in this suit Albert is the admitted\n\n      Legal Representative for Pentex. Pentex must therefore produce Albert for deposition at the\n\n      appointed place and time.\n\n                                     ID;     DEPosmON OF ANGELLI CARRASCO.\n\n              18.      On September 2, 2014, Ken and Candy issued Angelli a State of Texas Subpoena\n\n      Duces Tecum for Oral Deposition, to be conducted on October 13, 2014, at 10 o'clock a.m., at\n\n      the office ofPentex's Counsel Scott Smith, 120 South Crockett Street, Sherman, Texas 75091-\n\n      0354. See Exhibit F.\n\n              19.      Based on infonnation provided to· Ken and Candy during discovery, Angelli\n\n      Carrasco is President, Director, and Chainnan of Pentex- three (3) apex-level positions of\n\n      authority in Pentex. Per the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure requiring service to counsel when\n\n      counsel exists, the Subpoena to Angelli was rightfully served to Scott. Service to any other\n\n      party would not be effective, as Scott represents Pentex.\n\n\n\n      3\n       Ken and Candy believe that Albert, whose residence is in Guatemala, is currently traveling in Texas. Although\n      Scott was able to produce a signed unverified Affidavit ftom Albert on September 3, 2014, Scott claimed that\n      obtaining an Affidavit fiom Angelli Cattasco, ftom Panama, was impossible due to logistics.\n      OBJECJ'IONS TO ManoN TO QuASH OR FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER\n      RELATING TO SUBPOENAS AND DEPOSmON NoTICES AND ·\n      MonON TO COMPEL DEPOSmONS OF ALBERT BARCROFT AND                                      CAUSE No. CV-14-41665\n      ANGELLI CARRASCO ON 0croBER 13,2014                                                                        -7-\n      PENTEX FOUNDATION r. GIBBS, El' AI..\n\n\n\n407\n\f              20.     AngeJIPs deposition is necessary to achieve justice in this matter. Angelli was\n\n      noticed that her deposition will address questions concerning her personal knowledge of the\n\n      following: (1) the incorporation ofPentex Foundation; (2) daily activities ofPentex Foundation;\n\n      (3) all monies received from the Estate and GWB Trust; (4) the board minutes on or about\n\n      August 4, 2014, in which she agreed to file suit against Kenneth Gibbs and Candace Gibbs in\n\n      Fannin County; and (5) Albert'$ and Danny Unger's legal authority to act on Pentex\n\n      Foundation's behalf. Each of the issues goes to allegations made by Albert concerning the\n\n      functions of Pentex as relates to the CSL, the FSA, and GWB Trust. Each of these issues is\n\n      highly pertinent to the Cause, likely to lead to information which is highly pertinent to the\n\n      Cause, and therefore discoverable.\n\n              21.     As a President and Director and Chairman of a multi-national corporation, which\n\n      is currently involved in a lawsuit concerning more than $1 million in assets, Angelli's excuse\n\n      that she does not own a passport for travel to the United States is only that - an excuse. The\n\n      excuse that Pentex does not control Angelli is yet another excuse - as President and Director\n\n      and Chairman of Pentex., Angelli answers to Pentex for her actions involving the organization.\n\n      Pentex can indeed require her to attend a deposition on its behalf.\n\n              22.     The Subpoena to Angelli stated that the deposition would take place in the office\n\n      of Pentex's Counsel, on October 13, 2014. The location is obviously convenient to Pentex's\n\n      Counsel, and the date was offered as available by Pentex's Counsel. There can be no place and\n\n      time more convenient for the deposition.\n\n              23.     Pentex's resistance to Angelli's Subpoena suggests that, as is the case with\n\n      Albert's deposition, Pentex has a great deal to hide.

Subject to this objection, Pentex\n             Foundation answers as follows:\n\n             Pentex Royalty Trust is a trust domestic to the United States that was created\n             as a trust to take in all ~venue due from taxable sources within the United\n             States, pay any U.S. taxes or other obligations due, and then distribute its\n             remaining beneficial interests. Pentex Foundation is the sole beneficiary of\n             Pentex Royalty Trust. :Pentex Royalty Trust has a paid trustee who is not\n             associated, or familiar with, any other phase of Pentex Foundation. The tax\n             obligations are figured, by computing and filing a Return 1042 with the\n             Internal Revenue Servjce meeting the requirements of the Internal Revenue\n             Code. The voting rights issue was always a problem because the purported\n             trustees of GWB trust never had a clear and defined way of doing anything.\n             For that reason, Pentex Foundation assigned it voting shares by proxy to Jim\n             Walton as long as he was the purported trustee. We have no record of any\n             official votes after Beverly Miller became the purported trustee.\n\n      INTERROGATORY NO. 2: Detail your relationship with Albert, including\n      specifics concerning his activities within your entity; on whose authority Albert\n      serves as your Legal Representative; amounts of payment for Albert's services to\n      you; percentages of distributions to you from GWB Trust which Albert ultimately\n      receives; Albert's arrangements to pay Estate attorneys in order to uphold his\n      responsibilities to the CSL and the FSA; Albert's payments of legal fees with\n      regard to this lawsuit; Albert's involvement in this lawsuit (i.e., whether Albert was\n      responsible for instigating the lawsuit); and all other involvement of Albert\n      concerning your involvement with GWB Trust.\n\n             ANSWER: Pentex Foundation objects to this interrogatory as outside the\n             scope of permissible discovery and overly broad. Interrogatories may be\n             used to ascertain basic legal and factual claims and defenses, but may not be\n             used to force a party to marshal evidence.\" See, Rule 197 of the Texas Rules\n             of Civil Procedure, at comment 1. Pentex Foundation objects to the terms of\n             payments as confidential under the laws of Panama, and outside the scope of\n             discovery in any event. Subject to these objection, Pentex Foundation\n             answers as follows, and under a defintion of \"you\" and \"your\" to refer to\n\n      PENTEX FOUNDATION'S RESPONSE TO DISCOVERY FROM KENNETH GIBBS                       Page 8\n\n\n\n\n426\n                                                                             Page\n\f             Pentex Foundation only as specified in the general objections:\n\n             Pentex Foundation purchased an interest in the Contract for Sale that Albert\n             Barcroft originally owned. It was mutually advantageous to continue to\n             work with Albert to bring the terms of the contract to conclusion, and he\n             served and serves on our behalf in the matter. To the knowledge ofPentex\n             Foundation, Albert had ~o responsibilities to pay any attorneys other than\n             John Skotnik in the matter, and such was not shown in any documentation\n             presented to Pentex Foundation. When Pentex was forced to hire new\n             counsel in the case, it did not have sufficient funds in the United States to\n             pay the full retainer. Mr. Barcroft did. Pentex Foundation gave Mr.\n             Barcroft money here, and he sent that money to Scott Smith in the United\n             States. Mr. Barcroft definitely made Pentex Foundation aware that he\n             thought there was a problem in the way proceeds were being paid by GWB\n             Trust, if that qualifies as instigation. In brief, Barcroft was our express\n             liaison with GWB trust, whatever it is.\n      INTERROGATORY NO. 3: JExplain the reasons you came to believe that\n      contingency fee attorneys were deducting their fees from the total due you, Ken,\n      Candy, and Howard Kirk, then issuing one check to GWB Trust, including the\n      rationale for believing that in excess of$ 1 million in attorney fees were due from\n      Ken, Candy, and Howard Kirk; when and how you arrived at these alleged facts;\n      and the reason that Beverly Miller was instructed to assign 57.19% interest in\n      GWB Trust to GBU Trust, when you were entitled to a far smaller percentage.\n             ANSWER: Pentex Foundation objects to this interrogatory as outside the\n             scope of permissible discovery and overly broad. Interrogatories may be\n             used to ascertain basic legal and factual claims and defenses, but may not be\n             used to force a party to marshal evidence.\" See, Rule 197 of the Texas Rules\n             of Civil Procedure, at comment 1. Subject to these objection, Pentex\n             Foundation answers as follows, and under a defintion of\"you\" and \"your\" to\n             refer to Pentex Foundation only as specified in the general objections:\n             The percentage due Pentex Foundation under the Contract for Sale.\n             Barcroft's share was 30% of everything Ken, Candy and Howard received.\n             Ken, Candy and Howard each received 25%, for a total of75%, of the\n             estates. Of the 75%, Pentex Foundation owned 30%, equaling 22.5% of\n             everything distributed by the estate (75% X 30%=22.5%). The estate\n             distributed mineral interests to GWB Trust equaling 35.04% of the total\n             minerals owned by the estate. It also distributed 2.46% directly to John\n             Skotnik in payment for his services as attorney (an amount due solely by\n             Barcroft). Of the 35.04% distributed to GWB Trust, Pentex Foundation\n             owned 20.04% (22.5% minus the 2.46% already distributed to Skotnik).\n             20.04% is 57.19% of35.04%; thus, Pentex Foundation owned 57.19% of the\n\n      PENTEX FOUNDATION'S RESPONSE TO DISCOVERY FROM KENNETH GIBBS                      Page 9\n\n\n\n\n427\n                                                                          Page _ _  (-+J-\n\f              minerals transferred to GWB Trust by the estate.\n\n      INTERROGATORY NO. 4: Detail and explain the contents of all oral\n      communications dating back to September 1, 2008, which you have had with\n      Howard Kirk, including all agreements to cooperate with you, Albert or Danny\n      Unger in this lawsuit; including your communications with Howard Kirk at the\n      Tarrant case hearing on July 31,2014, including the reason for conferring with\n      him, when he is a Defendant in this case; and disclose whether you consulted\n      Howard Kirk in drafting your requests for Admissions and whether you assisted\n      Howard Kirk in producing his responses to your demands for discovery, since he\n      was capable of response to you within fewer than five (5) hours of receiving your\n      Requests; and disclose whether John Skotnik, when acting as your Counsel,\n      cooperated with Howard Kirk in motioning the Court to remove Ken as\n      Independent Administrator of the Estate.\n\n             ANSWER: Pentex Foundation objects to any such communications initiated\n             after the anticipation of litigation and/or protected pursuant to the \"joint\n             defense doctrine\" recognized in TEX.

Albert Barcroft, creator ofPentex Foundation, Pentex Royalty Trust, GWB Trust, and\n GBU Trust, and Joshua Unger, Trustee of GBU Trust, are both known tax protesters. GBU Trust\n was fraudulently created in' order to avoid paying federal income taxes and continue their tax\n fraud schemes.

Plaintiff and Counsel are engaged in fraud before this Court, and Plaintiff is\ncommitting tax fraud. The objection to No. 64 as overly broad is ridiculous. No. 64 speciracally\nasks, \"Produce any copy of any payments you made to the Internal Revenue Service of\nDepartment of Treasury,\" and No.4 states, \"Produce a copy of your IRS Form 1041 for 2013.\"\n\n        4.     The objection of invasion of privacy and harassment to Request for Production\nNos. 5, and 69 - 72 is not appropriate, and frankly ridiculous. Axelson, Inc. v.

The Request seeks infonnation about income to GBU Trust, which\nwas established solely to receive distributions from GWB Trust. GBU Trust states that it has not\nreceived the money from GWB Trust to which it is entitled. Defendants strongly object to this\nassertion and lawsuit. Defendants are entitled to know how much money GBU Trust has\nreceived. All related discovery, including OBU Trust's distributions to members, is allowable, as\nthe discovery is likely to lead to discovery relevant to this Cause. Again, the objection to\n\"outside scope of legitimate discovery\" is not an appropriate objection.\n\n        5.      The objection of overly broad categories to Request for Production Nos. 5, 22, 33,\n36, 38, 39, and 64 is not appropriate. The Requests posit that the infonnation requested is to date\nback to the inception of GBU Trust (November 1, 2013). Again, the objection to \"outside scope\nof legitimate discovery\" is not an appropriate objection. Also, see No. 4 above. In addition, in\nresponse to No. 22 (\"produce all documents upon which you base the claims that you are the\n'real party in interest in this suit ... \"'), the response was, \"objection as it is overly broad and\ninvades work product [and protected].\" What? How is this overly broad? And even more\nconfusing, why is GBU Trust refusing to provide information concerning its declaration that it is\nthe real party in interest in this litigation? Defendants are entitled to this information, as it is\nlikely to be a crucial element in their defense.\n\n        6.     The objection of work product and client-attorney privilege to Request for\nProduction Nos. 22, and 38 - 39 is not appropriate. Such an objection points to furtherance of\nfraud.

Civ. App.- Eastland 1979,\nno writ). Texas Rules of Evidence Rule No. 503(d)(l). As Intervenor, GBU Trust must provide\nevidence of the claims to the assets currently under dispute. Joshua Unger, as Trustee of GBU\nTrust, was not involved with the Estate's calculations for the attorneys' fees in dispute. No\nclient-attorney privilege or work product privilege can attach. Also, see No. 5 above.\n\n        7.     The objection of falling outside the scope of legitimate discovery to Request for\nProduction Nos. 6, 64, and 69 - 72 is not an appropriate objection to discovery, and all\ninformation should be produced immediately, as that information promises to lead to discovery\nhighly relevant to this Cause.\n\nResoonses to Interrogatories.\n\n       8.      The objections to Interrogatory No. 2 and 4 as being outside the scope of\npennissible discovery and overly broad and assuming facts not in evidence are not appropriate.\nThe Interrogatories ask for specific information concerning GBU Trust's relationship to the CSL\n\nDEFENDANTS' MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY\nFROM GBU FRIENDS AND ASSoclATES TRUST                                        CAUSENo. CV-14-41665\nPENTEX FOUNDA'170N Y.

The answers to the Interrogatories\npromise to lead to relevant information concerning this lawsuit Facts presented in the\nInterrogatories are not assumed, but evidenced by information provided by GBU Trust.\n\nResponses to Admissions.\n\n        9.      The response to Request for Admission No. 50 is not appropriate. GBU Trust\nclaims to have made reasonable inquiry concerning calculations for percentages due Heirs from\nthe Estate, as calculated by Albert Barcroft, but GBU Trust was unable to obtain the information.\nCounsel for GBU Trust admitted to having repeated contact with Albert Barcroft and could\neasily respond with an admission or denial.\n\n        I0.    The objection to Request for Admission No. 65 is not appropriate. The Request\naddresses the creation of the CSL, which Plaintiff argues is crucial to this lawsuit. The Request\ndoes not fall outside the scope of legitimate discovery, as an Admission or Denial promises to\nlead to relevant discovery.\n\n                                    II.

for not being the Original Plaintiff in this\n      suit, while Pentex, whom you deny is the \"real party in interest,\" initiated this suit.\n             ANSWER: Intervenor objects to this interrogatory as outside the scope of\n             permissible discovery and overly broad. Interrogatories may be used to\n             ascertain basic legal and factual claims and defenses, but may not be used to\n             force a party to marshal evidence.\" See, Rule 197 of the Texas Rules of Civil\n             Procedure, at comment 1. Subject to this objection, Intervenor answers as\n             follows:\n             GBU Trust accepted the contribution from Pentex Foundation as one of the\n             settlors to GBU Trust. As such, GBU Trust has full ownership at this point of\n             time of the interests Pentex Foundation did hold in the \"Contract for Sale of\n             Land, Mineral Rights and Royalties, and all other Assets or Monies Received\n             from the Estate otBert Hughes Gibbs, Kathryn G. Gibbs, and/or the Mary L.\n             Houseworth Trust(s)\", referred to herein throughout as \"Contract\". The fact .\n             that GBU Trust should have been a co-plaintiflin this suit from the beginning\n             was an oversight by the original attorney, John Skotnik, which was later\n             corrected.\n      INTERROGATORY NO.2: Explain your rationale for entering a lawsuit as\n      Intervenor, when you believe that you are not bound by the agreement previously\n      established by the parties of GWB Trust, the CSL, and the FSA, agreements whtch\n      form the basis for your intervention, including your relationship to each of the\n      parties you deem to be interested J?arties to the matter at hand, mcluding explaining\n      why you believe yourself to have mterest in the Estate, and why you believe that\n      attorneys' fees belonging to Defendants were being deducted from your alleged\n      share of the Estate.\n             ANSWER: Intervenor objects to this interrogatory as outside the scope of\n             permissible discovery and overly broad. Interrogatories may be used to\n             ascertain basic legal and factual claims and defenses, but may not be used to\n             force a party to marshal evidence.\" See, Rule 197 ofthe Texas Rules of Civil\n             Procedure, at comment 1. Intervenor further objects that this interrogatory\n             states incorrect and false premises, and as such 1s incapable of being\n             answered. The trustee of the GBU Trust has never stated that it was not\n             bound by the Contract or the FSA.\n      INTERROGATORY NO.3: Provide calculations upon which you base your claim\n      JOSHUA UNGER, TRUSTEE'S RESPONSE TO DISCOVERY FROM KENNETH GIBBS                    Page 16\n\n\n\n\n479\n\f      that you are owed in excess of$1 million because of payments due you which were\n      reduced by the amount of attorneys' fees, when GWB Trust was not aware of your\n      alleged existence until November or December 2013 and had never incurred such\n      debt to you.\n\n             ANSWER: The Barcroft share of the Contract was 30% of the shares of the\n             inheritance received by Ken, candy and Howard. Ken, Candy and Howard\n             collectively received 75% of the entire estate; therefore, Pentex Foundation\n             owned 22.5% of the entire estate (75% X 30% = 22.5%). 2.46% of the\n             Pentex share was taken out at the estate level to pay John Skotnik the fees\n             Barcroft owed him, leaving 20.04% being owned by Pentex Foundation. For\n             the first 5 years of distribution, Pentex Foundation has only been receiving\n             10.02%. That means that Pentex Foundation should have received double\n             what it was paid by GWB Trust. That is over a million dollars. GBU Trust\n             now owns the rights to everything that Pentex Foundation previously owned,\n             including the payment of underpayment of distributions. The only attorney\n             fees that were supposed to reduce the Barcroft share of the Contract are those\n             paid to John Skotnik. See also the computation of damages submitted as\n             Plaintiff/Intervenor 00255-256.\n\n      INTERROGATORY NO. 4: Explain why you claim to be entitled to 30% of all\n      proceeds arising from any lawsmt involving Defendants, under the terms of the\n      Contract, when you deny being held to the terms of the Contract; and explain why\n      you request the Court to declare the Contract valid and enforceable if in fact, you\n      cannot be bound by the tenns of the Contract; and explain your reasoning for filing\n      the Plaintiffs and Intervener's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment in conjunction\n      with Pentex, revealing a lack of clarity as to which party actually holds interest in\n      GWB Trust.\n\n      ANSWER: Intervenor objects to this interrogatory as outside the scope of\n      permissible discovery and overly broad. Interrogatories may be used to ascertain\n      basic legal and factual claims and defenses, but may not be used to force a party to\n      marshal evidence.\" See, Rule 197 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, at\n      comment 1. Intervenor further objects that this interrogatory states incorrect,\n      argumentative, and false premises, and as such is incapable of being answered. The\n      trustee of the GBU Trust has never stated that it was not bound by the Contract or\n      the FSA.\n      INTERROGATORY NO.5: Explain your statement that you and Defendants have\n      a long history, when Candy and Ken deny knowing of your existence until late\n      2013; and\n             ANSWER: (Assuming that there should be a period after 2013), the \"long\n             history\" is with the predecessors, Albert Barcroft and Pentex Foundation; the\n             position that Intervenor now holds.\n\n      INTERROGATORY NO.6: Explain the reasoning behind aligning with Pentex in\n      its claim against Defendants while you yourself insist that you are entitled to the\n      JOSHUA UNGER, TRUSTEE'S RESPONSE TO DISCOVERY FROM KENNETH GIBBS                 Page 17\n\n\n\n                                                                                   EXh I'b't\n                                                                                          I\n                                                                                                 A_.

SUMMARY OF MOTION\n\n          1.      Although muddily drafted, it appears that the Motion seeks traditional summary\n\n  judgment pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 166a(b).        The Motion did not specify whether a\n\n  traditional or a no-evidence summary judgment is sought.\n\n          2.      Contrary to their mutual assertion, the facts presented in Pentex Foundation\n\n  (\"Pentex\") and GBU Friends and Associates Trust's (\"GBU Trust\") Motion are highly disputed.\n\n          3.      Although Pentex and GBU Trust are suing Howard Kirk Gibbs, the Motion\n\n  excluded Howard Kirk in its mention of the parties supposedly \"taking actions\" inconsistent\n\n  with the Contract for Sale of Land (\"the CSL\").        No clarifying point was made for this\n\n  omission.\n\n\n\n  KEN GIBBS'S AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S\n  AND INTERVENOR'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT                      CAUSENO. CV-14-41665\n  PENTEX FOUNDATION V. GIBBS, ET AL.                                                                          -1-\n\n495\n\f         4.      In large part, Pentex and GBU Trust based their Motion, including legal\n\n interpretation of various agreements, upon Admissions by Howard Kirk. On receipt of GBU\n\n Trust's Request for Admissions, Howard Kirk responded within fewer than five (5) hours,\n\n evidence of collusion among Plaintiff, Intervener, and Defendant. The preponderance of the\n\n purported facts in the Motion ignored Admissions from Ken and Candy in favor of Admissions\n\n from Howard Kirk, and relied very heavily on Howard Kirk's Admissions concerning his lay\n\n interpretation of provisions in the Family Settlement Agreement (\"the FSA\"). Pentex and GBU\n\n Trust's Motion ignored all Admissions from Ken and Candy which controverted Admissions\n\n from Howard Kirk.\n\n         5.      The Motion cited no statutes and no case law upon which Pentex and GBU Trust\n\n based their argument.\n\n         6.      Since the CSL, there have been subsequent dealings and subsequent agreements,\n\n including the FSA.\n\n         7.      As Movants for summary judgment, Pentex and GBU Trust bear the burden of\n\n proof of the facts argued.\n\n                                      II. UNDISPUTED FACTS.\n\n         8.      The number of undisputed facts is small indeed.\n\n         9.      Albert Barcroft was and is not licensed to practice law.\n\n         10.     Albert drafted the CSL, with the parties signing on May 10, 2005.\n\n         11.     The FSA was executed on or about September 5, 2008. See Exhibit A.\n\n         12.     GWB Family and Friends Trust (\"GWB Trust\") agreement was executed on\n\n November 7, 2008. See Exhibit B.\n\n\n KEN GIBBS'S AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S\n AND INTERVENOR'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n PENTEX FOUNDATION V. GIBBS, ET AL.\n\n\n496\n\f          13.      The issue of the CSL's validity was addressed most recently on August 20, 2014,\n\n  at a hearing in Tarrant County Probate Court No.2. Cause No. 2005-0000126-2-D, Walton and\n\n  Gibbs vs. Miller, et al. As was established at the hearing, the CSL was drafted in 2005 by\n\n  Albert, who has portrayed himself repeatedly to multiple parties as the Legal Representative of\n\n  Pentex and GBU Trust.\n\n          14.      Judge Ferchill of the Tarrant County Probate Court No.2 stated:\n\n                   [Albert] cannot enforce a contract that he participated in. He cannot\n                   get money for - or unjust enrichment for committing what is a\n                   criminal misdemeanor, at least, in Texas. p. 105\n\n                   [Albert] is practicing law without a license, and he cannot enforce a\n                   contract that brings money into his pocket for violating the law,\n                   period. p. 106\n\n                   (Emphasis added.)\n\n          See Exhibit C. (excerpts ofthe hearing.i\n\n          15.      Albert was a party to the CSL, as were Ken, Candy, and Howard Kirk Gibbs.\n\n  The CSL contained provisions which greatly benefited Albert. Albert advised Ken and Candy\n\n  that as he went to law school he was able to draft legal contracts. See Exhibit D.\n\n          16.      Ken and Candy have raised concerns numerous times over the validity of the\n\n  Contract for Sale of Land (\"CSL\"), including in the Motion to Show Authority, Motion for\n\n  Change of Venue, Original Answer, Affirmative Defenses, Original Counterclaim, and Rule 13\n\n  Motion for Sanctions, and the subsequent Amended Motion. 2 Ken and Candy observed that\n\n\n\n  1\n    Only excerpts of the hearing are provided, as the transcript, with exhibits, is over 200 pages.\n  2\n   Although the Original Answer observed that John Skotnik drafted the CSL, Ken and Candy amended the Answer,\n  stating that Albert drafted the CSL without authority and that there existed a question concerning its validity.\n\n\n  KEN GIBBS'S AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S\n  AND INTERVENOR'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT                                   CAUSENO.

In general, \"unconscionability\" describes a contract that is unfair because\n\n  of its overall one-sidedness or the gross one-sidedness of its terms.

Pentex and GBU Trust failed in this regard. They failed to provide\n\n  evidence of their claims, and they failed to provide statutes or case law supporting their claims.\n\n          25.      The facts alleged by Pentex and GBU Trust are not, contrary to their mutual\n\n  claim, uncontested. The dispute concerning the validity is well-documented, the facts pertaining\n\n  to the CSL have been reviewed by the Court, and the CSL has been determined null and void.\n\n          26.      It is an established fact that Albert drafted the CSL, and per law, Albert (a.k.a.\n\n  Pentex, a.k.a. GBU Trust) cannot enforce its terms, as he drafted and provided advice\n\n  concerning an agreement which profited him. Pursuant to public policy, Albert cannot enjoy\n\n  gains from the illegal activity of engaging in the practice oflaw without a license.\n\n\n\n  KEN GIBBS'S AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S\n  AND INTERVENOR'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT                          CAUSE NO. CV -14-41665\n  PENTEX FOUNDATION V. GIBBS, ET AL.\n\n\n499\n\f               27.     The evidence upon which Pentex and GBU Trust relied in the Motion is\n\n      primarily derived from Admissions from Howard Kirk, although Admissions to the contrary\n\n      from Ken and Candy are on record. Only in the rare instances of agreement among the parties\n\n      do Pentex and GBU Trust recognize Ken and Candy's Admissions. Pentex and GBU Trust\n\n      offered no explanation for their straightforward, unquestioning acceptance of Howard Kirk's\n\n      Admissions over Ken and Candy's, nor did Pentex and GBU Trust's Motion seek to resolve the\n\n      discrepancies, other than to promote Howard Kirk's Admissions.          Pentex and GBU Trust's\n\n      approach was simply to pretend that inconsistencies and disputes relative to the CSL do not\n\n      exist.\n\n                                           V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF.\n\n      Ken and Candy ask the Court for the following relief:\n\n               28.    That Pentex and GBU Trust's Motion be denied in all aspects;\n\n               29.    That the CSL be declared null, void, and enforceable;\n\n               30.    Dismissal of the case with prejudice; and\n\n               31.

LEE:     Yes, your Honor.\n\n12                          THE COURT:     Right?\n\n13                          MR.

GIBBS:     It's my understanding that an\n17   attorney helped Mr. Barcroft draw it up.                    That's what my\n\n18\n\n19                          THE COURT:     And is that -- that attorney's\n20   name on this agreement or anything connected?\n21                          MR. GIBBS:     I don't believe it's anywhere\n22   on the agreement.           But it was Mr. Barcroft's attorney,\n\n23   John Skotnik.           He had been his attorney for a very long\n\n24   time.

GIBBS:      He hired an attorney -- from\n 8    what I have been told, he hired --\n\n 9                   THE COURT:      And who -- which one of these\n\n10    people met with Mr. Skotnik and discussed it?\n11                   MR.

That's the best of my understanding.\n\n15                   THE COURT:      Barcroft, but Mr. Skotnik would\n16    have no privity of contract with these people.                  I mean\n17    -- and Mr. Barcroft,    if he did, in fact, practice law\n\n18    without a license, he cannot enforce a contract that he\n19    participated in.     He cannot get money for -- or unjust\n20    enrichment for committing what is a criminal\n21    misdemeanor, at least, in Texas.\n22                   MR.

That's the\n\n 8   first thing I think should be heard, is the motion to\n\n 9   show authority, and then the motion to transfer the\n\n10   Fannin county case to this Court.\n11                   But if you would like to hear the\n\n12   injunctive relief first, we do have a stipulation with\n\n13   one of the parties who's agreed to -- agreed to the\n\n14   injunctive relief for the -- for our petition, so we\n\n15   already have one person on board.           That would be\n\n16   Beverly Miller, the trustee of the GWB Trust.\n\n17                   MS. COX:     Your Honor, that's not entirely\n18   correct.   That is only as to the trust assets --\n19                   MS. LEE:     No, no --\n20                   THE COURT:     Yeah, I realize there was a\n21   request for injunctive relief on personal assets.                       Also,\n\n22   and the Court had already -- had already considered that\n\n23   that may be a little past its reach today.                 So ...\n\n24                   MS.

So, in fact, what these\n\n24    documents state is that it's an actual corporation,\n\n25    correct?\n\n594                             CRC for Wells Reporting\n                                     817-524-6644\n\f                                                                      Page 16\n                        EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1            A.     It states it's an entity under the laws of\n\n 2    Panama.        If it's a corporation, or a foundation,        I'm not\n 3    sure.        I don't --\n\n 4            Q.    Right.      Okay.    So both of these documents, one\n\n 5    in Spanish one in English, only states it's an\n\n 6    incorporated entity?\n\n 7            A.    And that it's in existence.\n\n 8            Q.    Okay.     But, again, nothing showing me that you\n\n 9    had any authority to file a special appearance for\n\n10    Pentex Foundation, correct?\n\n11            A.    You got my fee agreement.\n\n12            Q.     So you have a fee agreement from a person who I\n13    don't know, who says that you can represent Pentex\n\n14    Foundation in this lawsuit, and you -- you just went\n\n15    with this?\n\n16            A.    Yeah, I just went with that.\n\n17            Q.    Nothing else?\n\n18            A.    Nothing else.        I don't usually challenge my\n19    clients when they want to hire me.\n20                          MS. LEE:     Okay.    Your Honor, I don't have\n21    any further questions, I would\n\n22                          THE COURT:     Would you like to continue to,\n\n23    say, testifying, as it were, whatever you want to tell\n24    the Court from the witness stand?\n25\n\n                                   CRC for Wells Reporting\n595                                     817-524-6644\n\f                                                                             Page 17\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING- July 31,2014\n\n 1                    THE COURT:     I guess what I was looking at\n\n 2   something earlier and it seemed to be that only the\n\n 3   president or the vice president or the secretary of the\n\n 4   so-called entity had authority to engage in litigation,\n\n 5   engage with counsel, am I -- did I misread?\n\n 6                    MS. LEE:     Your Honor\n\n 7                    MR. SMITH:     That may be what counsel\n\n B   represented.     I don't believe that to be the case.\n\n 9                    MS. LEE:     Your Honor, I've been practicing\n\n10   business law, tax law for many, many years, and\n\n11   when -- as an officer of the Court, I will tell you that\n\n12   you're required, when an entity decides to fire a -- to\n\n13   file a lawsuit, it is a board resolution.                So the board\n\n14   has to make the resolution to sue anyone.\n\n15                    There is no board minutes here.               And Panama\n\n16   1s concurrent.     It's not completely identical, but it is\n\n17   concurrent with the U.S. way of entities.               And so there\n\n18   should be board minutes, something showing me.\n19                    And he's been on notice since April that I\n\n20   needed something to show, including board minutes, and\n21   he, still today, is not producing anything.\n\n22                    THE COURT:     Would you like to answer that,\n\n23   sir?\n\n24                    MR. SMITH:     Well, number one, I would like\n\n25   the Court look at what I did produce.\n\n                             CRC for Wells Reporting\n 596                              817-524-6644\n                                                   e28bd4ed-9dff-4753-b322\n\f                                                                Page 18\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1                     The first response I had is, when I saw\n\n 2    this motion, I looked at Rule 12, because this is the\n\n 3    first time I've ever been challenged, in 30 years of\n\n 4    practicing law, to show that my client actually has\n 5    hired me --\n 6                     THE COURT:     Well, maybe the client has the\n\n 7    authority to hire you.        That's the issue, is it not?\n\n 8                     MR. SMITH:     I don't know that you can go\n\n 9    behind the engagement of the lawyer to challenge that\n10    basis, as an opponent.        I mean, it seems awkward.\n\n11                     What I was going to say was, when I looked\n12    at Rule 12 --\n\n13                     THE COURT:     The individual could\n\n14    just -- could be a rogue board member or an interloper,\n\n15    so to speak, or even stranger.        I mean, you don't -- you\n\n16    say you haven't met this person, right?\n17                     THE WITNESS:     Here's the reason I didn't,\n18    your Honor.     The motion was never sworn like it's\n19    suppose to be.     Rule 12 is like a sworn motion, so it's\n20    not proper to consider.        I didn't get a chance to say\n21    that earlier, but that was really my first response, is\n22    I didn't go pull up all these minutes, because I didn't\n23    have a sworn motion.\n\n24                     More to the point, the motion is really two\n\n25    parts.   It challenges the existence of Pentex, which            E hibit\n\n\n\n597\n\f                                                                Page 19\n                 EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   we -- that's the reason we sent those e-mails and sent\n 2   the supporting documents months ago, and then challenges\n 3   my authority.    That's why I sent her -- or had available\n 4   my fee agreement.\n 5                   I did not sit and compare the names on the\n 6   documents from Panama with the names of the individuals\n 7   that signed my fee agreement.        It may be the same.   I\n\n 8   probably need to compare that, if you think that would\n 9   answer the question.\n10                   MS. LEE:     No, your Honor, to go\n11   to -- concerning the -- the verification, this exact,\n12   almost identical, motion to show authority has been\n13   filed in Fannin county with a verification affidavit\n14   stating that he does not have authority.\n15                   MR. SMITH:     This isn't Fannin county.\n16                   MS. LEE:     If it was inadvertently not put\n17   on, if he's been on notice.\n18                   And I would also show for the record, as he\n19   stated erroneously, I've never seen the fee agreement.\n20   So he said he had e-mailed that to me, I never received\n21   it.\n22                   MR. SMITH:     I referenced I sent you\n23   the -- the incorporation documents and the certificate\n24   of authority that are exhibits two and three.        I did not\n25   send you the fee agreement.\n                                                                    Exhit it   8\n                            CRC for Wells Reporting\n 598                             817-524-6644\n\f                                                                 Page 20\n                 EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1                 MS. LEE:     Well, I have my clients who\n\n 2   signed the affidavit, who would be more than happy to\n\n 3   get on the stand to state exactly what the affidavit\n\n 4   provides.\n\n 5                 THE WITNESS:     That's not procedure.\n\n 6                 THE COURT:     So if I assume that you are\n\n 7   here representing Pentex Foundation only or Pentex\n 8   Royalty or is that one and the same?\n\n 9                 THE WITNESS:     Pentex Foundation.        I don't\n10   know who Pentex Royalty is.\n\n11                 THE COURT:     And whether or not we have\n12   service on Pentex Foundation, you are only here for a\n\n13   special appearance on behalf of Pentex Foundation.\n14                 THE WITNESS:     That is correct.\n\n15                 THE COURT:     That special appearance, I've\n\n16   seen, but for the most part is that that there's not\n17   sufficient ties?\n\n18                 THE WITNESS:     No, the special appearance is\n19   based upon the question of jurisdiction and the dominant\n20   jurisdiction of the Fannin County District Court --\n21                 THE COURT:     Because there is one agreement,\n22   as I recall, that had, in Fannin county, as a --\n23                 THE WITNESS:     Right.     The original\n24   agreement referenced venue in Fannin county.\n\n25                 THE COURT:     Right.     Because we\n\n                          CRC for Wells Reporting\n 599                           817-524-6644\n\f                                                                           Page 21\n                 EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   our management trusts when we do a bank here and we do a\n\n 2   trust for kids, we never know where they're going move\n 3   and so we tend to make the jurisdiction and venue in\n 4   Tarrant County, by my -- usually by my request.\n 5                 THE WITNESS:     And this doesn't address\n\n 6   jurisdiction, it just addresses venue.          My question on\n\n 7   jurisdiction is whether this Court has incident\n\n 8   jurisdiction to this case, because it's not out\n\n 9   of -- what it pertains to is assets that have already\n10   been distributed.\n\n11                 THE COURT:     I know.      That's what bothers me\n\n12   about this case as well.\n\n13                 THE WITNESS:     And that's really what I want\n14   to speak about --\n15                 THE COURT:     But we're not going to get into\n16   that right now.\n17                 MS. LEE:     Yeah --\n18                 THE WITNESS:      And with respect to the\n19   secondary component of the motion to Rule --\n20                 MS. LEE:     Again, your Honor, I would like\n21   to focus on the motion to show authority.\n22                 THE WITNESS:      That's what I'm talking\n23   about.\n\n24                 THE COURT:     Well, he said the Rule 12\n                                                                              Exhibt\n25   motion, the second part.\n\n                          CRC for Wells Reporting\n 600                            817-524-6644\n                                                e2Bbd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-\n\f                                                                             Page 22\n                      EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n1                      THE WITNESS:      The second part was whether\n\n 2     Pentex existed.     And I don't know if that's still an\n\n 3     issue or not\n\n4                      MS. LEE:      No, your Honor.\n\n 5                     THE WITNESS:       -- then I'll just rest.\n\n 6                     MS. LEE:      Yes, he has provided me the\n\n 7     documentation for that.\n\n 8                      THE COURT:     Just once again, and it will be\n 9     repeating yourself, but tell me, again, the\n10     scenario -- I remember the other attorney, is he from\n\n11     Sherman possibly --\n\n12                      THE WITNESS:      Bonham.\n\n13                      THE COURT:     Bonham.\n\n14                      MR. SMITH:     I'm from Sherman.\n15                      THE COURT:     I can't remember everything\n16     about every case, but I do try to retain -- okay.                     But\n\n17     now he's been here before.         How do you pronounce his\n\n18     name?\n19                      THE WITNESS:      Skotnik.\n20                      THE COURT:     Skotnik.      So he's the one that\n21     initially called you, initially recommended you or\n22     you're not sure?\n\n23                      THE WITNESS:      He called me because he knew\n\n24     he was -- or he was afraid he had a conflict of\n\n25     interest, and he voluntarily withdraw.              Called me and\n\n                               CRC for Wells Reporting\n     601                             817-524-6644\n                                                     e2Bbd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-14a0a6\n\f                                                                    Page 23\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1    asked if I'd be interested in the case, explained part\n\n 2    of the details of the case, and like most attorneys, I\n\n 3     said, if it will pay me, I'll do it.\n\n 4                      THE COURT:     A retainer is usually the next\n 5    thing --\n\n 6                      THE WITNESS:     It was, it was.     I didn't\n\n 7    enter an appearance until I had the retainer.            I do have\n 8    a case for you, your Honor --\n\n 9                      THE COURT:     It's a little disingenuous to\n10    not remember, isn't it -- I mean, you get that many\n11     $5,000 checks?\n\n12                      THE WITNESS:     I don't remember the names.\n13     I want to say one of them was Mr. Unger --\n\n14                      THE COURT:     You're under oath and you don't\n15    want to be -- commit perjury.\n\n16                      THE WITNESS:         it wasn't the name of the\n\n17     client.   I'd be more than happy to look and I'd be more\n\n18     than happy to supplement my answer, but I don't remember\n19     that\n20                      THE COURT:     So you received two\n21     different -- two different -- for a total retainer of\n22     $10,000, is that what I understood?\n\n23                      THE WITNESS:     Yes, sir.      I think I can\n\n24     explain this and maybe it will make a some sense.            The\n\n25     asset that Pentex had is assigned to a GBU Trust.           And\n                                                                   Page~~~\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n     602                           817-524-6644\n\f                                                                              Page 24\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1     think some beneficiaries of that trust are the ones that\n\n 2     actually paid the fees.     Because they're the ones with\n\n 3     the financial interest.\n\n 4                   And I want to say one was Mr. Unger.                     And I\n 5     just don't remember who the other check came from.                     It\n\n 6     could have been Mr. Barcroft.       I just don't know.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:     So Mr. Barcroft is the one who\n\n 8     mailed you the agreement paperwork?\n\n 9                   THE WITNESS:      I get it via e-mail.\n\n10                   THE COURT:     That's what you printed off and\n11    provided for opposing counsel?\n\n12                   THE WITNESS:      Yes, sir.       Your Honor, I\n\n13     found one case and it's the Patton Children's Trust case\n\n14     out of Amarillo.   It's not published, but it does talk\n\n15     specifically about Rule 12.       And I've got a single copy.\n\n16     I'm sorry, I didn't bring extras.\n17                   And says, typically, the response to a\n\n18     Rule 12 motion, an attorney satisfies his or her burden\n19     to establish the authority to prosecute or defend a suit\n20     through an affidavit from the client indicating the\n21     attorney was retained and/or through testimony of the\n22     attorney.\n\n23                   And that's all it says you have to do to\n\n24     satisfy the burden.   And that's all we've done, your\n\n25     Honor.

LEE:     One thing, your Honor.        Was that\n\n 2    a corporation?     Was that case a corporation?\n\n 3                     THE WITNESS:     I think it was a trust.\n\n 4                     MS. LEE:     It's very different than a\n\n 5    corporation.\n\n 6                     THE WITNESS:     Well, it just says the\n 7    attorney has to give his testimony.               That's what I've\n\n 8    done.   And I'll submit that for the Court.\n\n 9                     THE COURT:     Additional questions, Ms. Lee?\n\n10                     MS. LEE:     No, your Honor.\n\n11                     THE COURT:     You may step down at this time.\n\n12                     THE WITNESS:     Thank you.\n\n13                     THE COURT:     It's a very interesting\n\n14    question posed, because usually what our motion                 we\n\n15    have motions to show authority all time in this Court,\n\n16    because it's probate court and often persons who are\n17    alleged to be incapacitated tend to show up with private\n18    attorneys or private attorneys show up and tend to claim\n19    they're representing the incapacitated person.               So those\n20    cases are one in which we have a threshold of showing\n21    that the person has at least the capacity to engage an\n\n22    attorney.\n\n23                     So while we are accustomed to Rule 12\n\n24    agreements, this is -- or Rule 12 objections or motions,\n\n25\n\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n     604                           817-524-6644\n\f                                                                            Page 26\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   more or less, in this case.\n\n 2                   So it's your motion, tell me why I\n\n 3   should -- why I should grant your motion, what proof he\n\n 4   hasn't supplied.     I mean, he has come under oath and\n 5   stated that he believes he's the attorney .\n\n 6                   . MS. LEE:   I know, your Honor\n\n 7                   THE COURT:     And he's gotten payment from\n 8   someone.\n\n 9                   MS. LEE:     But he didn't get it from Pentex\n10   Foundation, your Honor.       He got it from two individuals\n11   who have nothing to do, reportedly, with Pentex\n\n12   Foundation.    He hasn't met these -- he hasn't any of the\n\n13   people from Pentex Foundation, Incorporated.                 It's a\n\n14   corporation.     It's very different.\n\n15                    He's been on notice since April that we\n16   have questioned his authority.          He could have obtained a\n\n17   resolution from the board.        We specifically asked for\n18   that, and he provided us with just that it's a\n19   corporation, which does satisfy that it's a Panamanian\n20   corporation.\n21                    But still, he has no proof that he's\n22   been -- and it's exactly what you stated earlier, your\n\n23   Honor, how do I know that -- there are plenty of cases,\n\n24   I apologize I don't have them on me, where cases have\n\n25   been thrown out, where the board -- because a\n\n                             CRC for Wells Reporting\n 605                              817-524-6644\n                                                   e28bd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-14a0a6eel*\n\f                                                                                   Page 27\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   shareholder would say, I was at the board meetings, and\n\n 2   the board never resolved, ever, why I was there in order\n\n 3   to sue somebody.     And that case would get thrown out, as\n 4   not having authority -- as the attorney not having the\n 5   authority.\n 6                    I don't think he did his due diligence.\n\n 7   Again, he received two checks from two individuals,\n\n 8   which are not associated with Pentex Foundation.                          And\n\n 9   signed from a lady who he -- a gentleman who's he's\n10   never met, via e-mail.\n\n11                    THE COURT:    Doesn't sound very good when\n\n12   she says it.     But you, obviously, have a different\n\n13   version.\n\n14                    MR. SMITH:    I used to do insurance defense.\n\n15   Insurance companies paid me all the time.                   They weren't\n16   the client.     The client was the individual I was\n17   representing.\n\n18                    THE COURT:    But I suppose nobody challenged\n19   whether or not the insurance company existed or whether\n\n20   or not the proper route or road map was taken between\n21   the powers that be and your ultimate appearance in the\n\n22   courtroom.\n\n23                    MR. SMITH:    That is true.            I was never\n\n24   challenged.     No one would ever think to do that.\n\n                                                                                                            v1\n25                    THE COURT:     She has challenged, apparentlvL.                                        ~\n                                                                                          l:xmbt\n                                                                                                ,,..;r!f\"':• '•-,,,\n                             CRC for Wells Reporting                        Page          7/'                         \\\n 606                              817-524-6644\n                                                   e2 8bd4ed- 9df f -4 753 -b322 -14aOa6 ;,\n\f                                                                 Page 28\n                  EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31,2014\n\n1    from the beginning.\n\n2                   MR. SMITH:    Well, with an unsworn motion\n 3   not properly before the Court.        And so I brought what I\n4    had.   I did not get an authorization.          And the case that\n\n 5   I gave you says that the remedy is to give us more time.\n\n 6                  THE COURT:    Excuse me?\n\n 7                  MR. SMITH:     I believe the case that I gave\n 8   you, it's over there on the corner of the bench, I\n 9   believe they said the remedy is not to dismiss our\n10   position, but to give us more time to find an attorney\n11   or demonstrate authority.      So it seems like\n\n12                  MS. LEE:     He's been on notice since April.\n\n13   It's now July 31st.\n\n14                  THE COURT:     Well, he does have a point.         It\n15   is supposed to be a sworn motion.         That can be fatal.\n\n16                  MS. LEE:     Your Honor, if I can --\n\n17                  THE COURT:     Does it not say that in the --\n\n18                  MS. LEE:     No, he      he is accurate.     Oh,\n19   actually, your Honor, there is one.\n\n20                  MS. SMITH:     There's an affidavit --\n21                  MS. LEE:     There's an affidavit of counsel,\n22   myself, that I signed in support, stating that\n23   everything in here was true and accurate.           So there is\n\n24   an affidavit in support of this motion.\n\n25                  MR.

LEE:      It's this motion -- the amended\n\n 4    motion to transfer cause of action and motion requesting\n\n 5    counsel to show authority.      It is      -- it's on there.\n 6                  MR. SMITH:      The\n\n 7                  THE COURT:      The one filed on 7/7.\n\n 8                  MR.

It was\n 4   the foreign       incorporation documents for the Pentex\n 5   Foundation.    At the time I filed this motion, he had\n\n 6   only sent me the Spanish version.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:      Okay.\n\n 8                   MS.

I'm not -- I don't pretend to be a\n\n12   translator.\n\n13                   MR.

I sent multiple e-mails as well, asking\n\n10   who is the representative of Pentex Foundation, and he\n\n11   has stated he would get back to me.               Today is the first\n\n12   day.\n\n13                    I sent him another e-mail on June 20, 2014\n\n14   requesting who is the legal representative for Pentex\n15   Foundation and, again, today is the first day he's\n16   actually given me a name.        That lawsuit was filed,        I\n\n17   believe, that was the end of March or maybe the\n\n18   beginning of April.\n19                    THE COURT:     Well, it appears to me that I\n20   may have to agree with the Amarillo court in the sense\n21   that, I'm reading between the lines that your                 your\n\n22   allegation is that there might not be proper\n\n23   authorization, even though this man has allegedly been\n\n24   hired and paid\n\n25                    MS.

Is that a fair statement?\n\n     5                      MS. LEE:     Yes, your Honor.\n\n     6                      THE COURT:     And you believe that you've\n\n     7     given him notice.     And I don't suppose you have those\n     8     e-mails here or anything\n     9                      MS. LEE:     No, your Honor.     But I would be\n    10     more than happy to supplement.          Yes, I have given him\n    11     ample notice.     And in the other motion\n\n    12                      THE COURT:     And even though he has never\n\n    13     had this happen before, you know, there's always a first\n\n    14     time for everything in law, and this is what you're\n    15     demanding?\n\n    16                      MS.

They may have been my\n\n 3   own --\n\n 4                 MS. LEE:     No, two of them were other\n\n 5   individuals' fault.   No, they've never been -- No, never\n\n 6   been Mr. Scott -- I didn't mean to imply that, at all.\n\n 7   This has nothing to do with Mr. Scott.\n\n 8                 THE COURT:     Well, I'm sorry -- you know,\n\n 9   Ms. Lee, I'm just simply not prepared, I mean, I owe him\n\n10   a courtesy as a fellow member of the bar, just as I owe\n\n11   you, however I understand why you want more than he's\n\n12   prepared to provide today, so\n\n13                 MS. LEE:     Can --\n\n14                 THE COURT:      -- I have a choice of either,\n\n15   you know, overruling your motion and going forward, when\n\n16   in fact, you may be correct.        If he does not show the\n\n17   proof that's necessary, I would grant your motion.          But\n\n18   I can't do any of that today.\n19                 I guess we could hear his -- we could take\n\n20   testimony on his special exception or hear his argument\n21   on his plea and abatement or special appearance,\n\n22   conditioned upon the Court, ultimately, finding that he\n\n23   had the authority      the requisite authority to make it.\n\n24                 MS.

Is\n\n 3    that agreeable with you\n\n 4                       THE COURT:       You're prepared to argue that\n\n 5    today, are you not?\n\n 6                       MR. SMITH:       I am, sir.\n\n 7                       THE COURT:       Well, then let's go forward on\n\n 8    that basis, then.         The Court will take under advisement,\n 9    pending further testimony and exhibits, et cetera, as to\n\n10    whether or not Ms. Lee's motion to show authority should\n\n11    be granted.\n\n12                       And now as I told -- you know, we usually\n13    have somebody from the Florida who says they've never\n\n14    been to Texas and the long arm statute and all that, but\n15    your special appearance is a different kind of cat, so\n\n16    to speak, right?\n\n17                       MR. SMITH:       Yes, yes, sir.\n\n18                        THE COURT:      You want to tell me about your\n19    special appearance?\n20                       MR. SMITH:       Yes, sir.         And it really goes\n21    to the Court's jurisdiction.              And I'm certain this Court\n22    is for more educated on probate court jurisdiction than\n\n23    I am.     I come from a county with courts of general\n\n24    jurisdiction, so we have different sets of issues.                            So I\n\n25    had to research this and I have --\n     .____ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _E_x_h_ib__.i _/}~ .. ,,,,\n\n                                  CRC for Wells Reporting                   Page    3Y     of{                    ' t'~\\\n 613                                                                                        !:!§?                      ,~\\\n                                        817-524-6644                                        iOb                        ~~ 1\n                                                        e28bd4ed- 9dff-4753-b322-14a0a6eel 79'J                        J'!:i\n                                                                                            ·,\\~1;                     /~':/\n                                                                                                     ·l,s~(j'· ':(; \"~ ~~\n\f                                                                     Page 35\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1                   THE COURT:      Well, it changes every\n\n 2   legislative session.       So you may know more about it than\n\n 3   I.\n 4                   MR. SMITH:      My analysis starts with the\n 5   SWEPI case.     I'm not sure        are you familiar with that\n\n 6   or not?\n\n 7                   THE COURT:      I am, indeed.\n\n 8                   MR. SMITH:      Okay.

LEE:      Your Honor, I'm -- I'm\n\n12                   THE COURT:      Is this more on your motion to\n\n13   transfer or your special appearance?\n14                   MR. SMITH:      It goes to jurisdiction, which\n15   is the foundation of the special appearance.              The\n16   jurisdictional question is which court has dominant\n\n17   jurisdiction.     And if this Court case doesn't have\n\n18   exclusive probate jurisdiction, then I'm going to argue\n19   that Fannin county has dominant jurisdiction, by virtue\n20   of being filed first.       That's why I'm going to SWEPI\n21   first.\n22                    THE COURT:     But you're arguing not a\n\n23   special appearance before the Court, aren't you arguing\n24   the main issue of transfer?\n\n25                    MR.

Ms. Lee, I'm going\n\n23    to go ahead and, again, I'm to go -- we're going to go\n\n24    ahead and hear this.

Thank you, your Honor.\n\n 9                     THE COURT:     Because I'm really\n\n10    concerned -- here's the thing that bothers me.            It seems\n11    like assets were distributed from an estate, and the\n\n12    people, for better or worse, made a bed they don't like\n13    lying in.\n\n14                     MS. LEE:     Your Honor, it's very different\n15    than that.    It's --\n\n16                     THE COURT:     And so it really may not have\n17    anything to do with this Court, at all.\n18                     MS. LEE:     I respectfully disagree.      And --\n19                     THE COURT:     All right.   Now,\n20    notwithstanding the trustee and alleged actions of the\n21    trustee are going to be the -- the petition that I\n22    mentioned originally, that's our trial petition that\n23    we're going to go forward on, come hell or high water.\n\n24                     MS. LEE:     Yes, your Honor.      But I'm talking\n\n25    about a case in Fannin county.         And I think the           Exhibit   13\n616\n\f                                                                  Page 38\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n1     big -- the big thing that's up for discussion here is\n\n 2    they believe these two cases are one and the same.\n\n 3                   The current case that's in this\n\n 4    jurisdiction, that you said, come hell or high water,\n\n 5    we're going to move forward, and the case in Fannin\n\n 6    county.   They aren't the same, at all.\n\n 7                   My first -- my two clients, Ken and Candy,\n\n 8    they have asked for this Court to transfer into the\n\n 9    estate of Bert Gibbs, this case.           Ken and Candy are two\n\n10    of the four heirs of the estate of Bert Gibbs.           Bert\n\n11    Gibbs had four heirs.     Howard Kirk, who's the gentleman\n\n12    over there, he's number three.\n\n13                   These three individuals went to bed with\n\n14    Al Barcroft, AKA Pentex Foundation, and signed a\n\n15    contract, which, by the way, your Honor, Al Barcroft\n\n16    drafted the contract on his own accord, on his own\n\n17    behalf, and inside the jurisdiction in Fannin county.\n\n18                   THE COURT:     And it appears he was\n19    practicing law without a license.\n\n20                   MS. LEE:     Yes, your Honor.       And pursuant to\n\n21    the Texas Estate Code 34.001, you have the authority\n\n22    that you may, not required, but you may transfer to your\n\n23    Court from a district court, and that's where that court\n\n24    is, any cause of action related to probate proceedings\n\n25    pending in 'another court or cause of action in which tEwtibit        J3\n                            CRC for Wells Reporting\n617                               817-524-6644\n\f                                                                   Page 39\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   personal representative of the estate pending in this\n\n 2   Court is a party.    And you can consolidate these cases.\n\n 3                   THE COURT:     True.\n\n 4                   MS. LEE:     Well.     Okay.     What happened is\n\n 5   when this lawsuit was filed, it was filed specifically\n\n 6   stating that it was for Pentex Foundation not getting\n\n 7   attorney fees that it was entitled to from -- from --\n\n 8   from the estate of Bert Gibbs.\n\n 9                   Your Honor, you have to keep in mind, even\n\n10   though it does look like these are assets that have been\n\n11   transferred out of the estate, there are assets that\n\n12   aren't transferred out of the estate.             There currently\n\n13   is a $6.1 million offer on a piece of property, to pay\n\n14   in full, or a $8.5 million installment agreement over\n\n15   the next five years, that will come to the estate of\n\n16   Bert Gibbs.\n\n17                   There is a lot of money out there.           My\n\n18   clients -- my two clients own 25 percent of the estate.\n19   So if they own 25 percent, they are potentially going to\n20   get $2 million.     Al Barcroft owns a percentage and\n21   Howard Kirk Gibbs also owns --he owns 12.5 percent.                 So\n\n22   we have a lot of assets for the estate of Bert Gibbs.\n\n23                   And we filed an amended answer in the\n\n24   Fannin county case, because what they\n25   allege -- and       what they allege is exactly what\n\n                            CRC for Wells Reporting\n 618                              817-524-6644\n\f                                                                  Page 40\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   Mr. Smith states, which is it's attorney fees.          In\n\n 2   their -- they sent admissions to my clients, 85\n\n 3   admissions.    Of 85, over 20 only included Ken as\n\n 4   executor.\n\n 5                    So when I objected, and said I'm\n\n 6   not -- this is for harassment purposes only, Ken, as the\n\n 7   executor of the estate, is absolutely irrelevant.            I\n\n 8   have an e-mail June 26th from Mr. Smith that states that\n\n 9   the attorney fees\n\n10                    MR. SMITH:    Your Honor, I'm afraid I have\n\n11   to object.    And that's why I was going to tell you about\n\n12   the SWEPI case.     You determine jurisdiction based on the\n\n13   pleadings.    We're getting into a lot of ancillary stuff\n\n14   here, that are not relevant to the pleadings on file ,\n\n15   so I would object to her introducing --\n\n16                    THE COURT:     I'm going to overrule the\n\n17   objection for now.\n\n18                    MS. LEE:     So he says requests 68 and 69 are\n19   the core issues of our case in Fannin county, our core\n\n20   issues.     68, subsequent to the execution of the family\n\n21   settlement agreement, Ken, as executor, has used funds\n\n22   for the estate of Bert Gibbs to pay attorney fees that\n\n23   were owed by Candy.\n\n24                    69, subsequent to the execution of the\n\n25\n\n                             CRC for Wells Reporting\n 619                              817-524-6644\n\f                                                                    Page 41\n                     EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1    funds for the -- from the estate of Bert Gibbs,\n\n 2    deceased, to pay attorney fees that were owed to Ken.\n\n 3                    We have pulled in -- you know,          it's very\n\n 4    difficult, your Honor, that my client is Ken,\n\n 5    individually, and as the independent administrator of\n\n 6    the estate.     When we filed our supplemented answer, we\n\n 7    stated that they have a defect in legal capacity.             They\n\n 8    have admitted, in these documents and other documents,\n\n 9    that it is at the core, over 20 questions which\n\n10    Mr. Smith -- Pentex Foundation has already filed a\n\n11    motion to compel stating that they wanted -- that those\n\n12    were paramount issues concerning his fiduciary duty as\n\n13    the trustee.\n\n14                     His conditions of the home place for\n\n15    self-dealing.     What does that have to do with a\n\n16    contract -- what does my client, Ken, have to do -- as\n\n17    independent administrator, have to do with the contract\n\n18    that they're suing for in Fannin county?          They're suing\n19    the wrong individual.\n\n20                     Ultimately, Ken -- Ken, as executor of this\n21    estate, is going to be pulled in.\n\n22                     THE COURT:     And a resident of Tarrant\n\n23    County?\n\n24                     MS. LEE:     Yes, your Honor, a resident\n\n25    Tarrant County.     So is Howard Kirk Gibbs.                        Exhibt ~\n\n\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n620                                 817-524-6644\n\f                                                                             Page 42\n                     EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1                    THE COURT:      Okay.\n\n 2                    MS. LEE:      So, your Honor, this is what I've\n\n 3   been able to determine\n\n 4                    THE COURT:      But he's being sued in his\n\n 5    capacity as an executor\n\n 6                    MS. LEE:      No, your Honor.        Right now, he's\n\n 7    being sued as an individual, because there's a family\n 8    settlement agreement that was filed in this Court in\n 9    2008.   And, specifically, it states that the four\n\n10    players, all four, Al Barcroft, Howard Kirk, Ken and\n\n11    Candy, if they sue the executor, sue the estate in any\n\n12    capacity, they have a potential for forfeiting all their\n13    inheritance.\n\n14                     THE COURT:     So it's kind like an in\n15    terrorem clause in a will?\n\n16                     MS. LEE:     Yes, that's exactly -- so they\n\n17    didn't want to sue Ken\n\n18                     THE COURT:     In his capacity as executor.\n19                     MS. LEE:     As executor.        But as Mr. Smith\n20    states in his e-mail, core issue goes to how the\n21    attorney fees were distributed.\n\n22                     That's exactly -- Pentex Foundation is\n\n23    suing my clients, stating that the attorney fees --\n\n24                     THE COURT:     They can't -- individually, he\n\n25    has no --\n                                                                                Exhibit   /3\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n621                                 817-524-6644                                   1\n\n                                                    e2Bbd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-14a0a6e~\n                                                                                   \\\n\f                                                                     Page 43\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1                   MS. LEE:     Exactly\n\n 2                   THE COURT:     -- he has no responsibility for\n\n 3   attorneys fees.\n\n 4                   MS. LEE:     Exactly.    We have an affidavit\n 5   that we have attached, saying you're suing me in the\n 6   wrong capacity.     So that lawsuit is going --\n\n 7                   THE COURT:     That's something you\n\n 8   should argue up there, is it not, that he's suing in the\n\n 9   wrong capacity?\n\n10                   MS. LEE:     We have filed that, your Honor,\n11   but we're trying to -- judicial economy.         With this case\n12     -- as you've already stated,     this case -- the estate of\n13   Bert Gibbs has been going on since 2005.\n\n14                   If this installment agreement gets signed\n15   for the sale of the property, this case will stay open\n\n16   until 2020, and I'm sorry to tell you that.            It's a\n17   five-year installment agreement to sell a big piece of\n18   property.\n19                   THE COURT:     But it's independent\n20   administration --\n21                   MS. LEE:     Yes --\n\n22                   THE COURT:         so I don't really have any\n23   say so over who buys what.\n\n24                   MS. LEE:     Exactly, your Honor.       But it's\n\n25   still in this Court, so this Court is still going to                Exhi it   iJ\n                            CRC for Wells Reporting\n 622                             817-524-6644\n\f                                                                  Page 44\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n 1   hear disputes.     It's not the first time these\n\n2    individuals have had disputes, it's probably not going\n\n 3   to be the last.\n\n 4                    THE COURT:     They have a settlement\n\n 5   agreement they filed with this Court, if they have\n 6   another dispute.\n\n 7                    MS. LEE:     Exactly, your Honor, and we are\n\n 8   pursuing that on one avenue.          But we -- with judicial\n\n 9   economy, you know, this Court is allowed to hear cases\n\n10   or transfer a case over, if this considers probate\n\n11   proceedings.     And that case specifically concerns\n\n12   probate proceedings concerning the administration of the\n13   estate of Bert Gibbs.\n\n14                    THE COURT:     Not if he's been filed\n\n15   incorrectly against him.\n\n16                    MS. LEE:     Correct, your Honor.      But if we\n17   file that over there and do a motion to dismiss, which\n18   we've already filed, we've got to go to Fannin county,\n19   hear all that, have it all done.            It's going to cost a\n20   lot of money\n21                    THE COURT:     Right.\n\n22                    MS.   LEE:   -- how much money my clients have\n\n23   paid so far,    just to get to this phase          --\n24                    THE COURT:     Right.\n\n25                    MS.   LEE:   -- so all that money to have\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n 623                               817-524-6644\n\f                                                                     Page 45\n                     EXCERPT MOTION HEARING • July 31, 2014\n\n 1    re-file over in this county, because I can assure you,\n\n2     they will re-file.      So why not have it moved here,\n 3    switch out the players, and move forward with the\n\n 4    lawsuit.\n\n 5                     They're sitting right here, you can ask\n\n 6    them.    They're not going to drop the lawsuit.         I've\n 7    tried to settle with them.        They're not going to drop\n 8    it.     But we can do all that, but we're going to be back\n 9    here in January, six months later, fighting -- having\n\n10    the exact same petition that they filed and Ken and\n\n11    Candy's name, individually, is going to be x-ed out and\n\n12    the estate of Bert Gibbs is going to be in there.\n\n13                     THE COURT:     But as I was telling your\n\n14    opposing counsel here, you know, actually the first case\n\n15    under SB is out of this court.          It's called Lagrone v.\n\n16    Henry.     The very first one ever reported, and it had to\n\n17    do with a trust that -- the trustee was in -- up there\n\n18    in the panhandle and our beneficiary was down here.\n19                     Be that as it may, that was the first\n20    reported case.     And ever since that case, the\n21    legislature and the Supreme Court and other courts have\n22    made SA and SB decisions.        SB -- it's a new Estates Code\n\n23    decision, but have made these decisions.          Every\n\n24    legislature comes in and changes it and the Supreme\n\n25    Court changes it and it gets really complicated\n\n                              CRC for Wells Reporting\n     624                            817-524-6644\n\f                                                                 Page 46\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING - July 31, 2014\n\n1      whether or not the court -- and the one that you're\n\n2      speaking of, Counsel, where they drug in an entire\n\n 3     hospital staff and everything all the way down to Harris\n\n 4     County to have a trial, was that -- that was one of the\n\n 5     abuses of this consolidation.\n\n 6                    One of the ones that caused one of the more\n\n 7     recent restrictions on these transfers was where\n\n 8     somebody went down the Houston and got a guardianship,\n\n 9     and then sued the doctor and the hospital in Midland for\n\n10     causing damages.   And the whole hospital and everybody,\n\n11     the lawyers, and all had to move down to Harris County\n\n12     for trial and that's one of the last ones where the\n\n13     legislature said enough is enough.\n\n14                    So I'm very, let's say, proactive in\n\n15     consolidating cases from down the street, from my\n\n16     sisters and brethren who are in district courts and we\n\n17     have something that's clearly linked to the estate.         In\n\n18     fact, in 30 years, I've only had one of those ever\n19     challenged by the judge, himself.\n\n20                    But be that as it may, when we start\n\n21     dragging stuff across county lines, the Court is more\n\n22     reluctant.   I know you also read the cases that say it's\n\n23     entirely my discretion if I choose not to do it.\n\n24     There's no appeal from choosing not to do it.         You can\n\n25     certainly appeal me choosing to do it wrongly.

LEE:      Right.    But for judicial economy,\n\n 6    your Honor -- and it would be, bring the case over here,\n\n 7    and we could -- we don't have to start anew.          This has\n\n 8    been going on since, basically, November of last year,\n 9    not in your court, but with --\n10                   THE COURT:     But that's nothing for\n\n11    litigation, as you well know.\n\n12                   MS. LEE:     I know.    But there's other issues\n\n13    as well.   Pentex Foundation, which I have not mentioned\n\n14    yet, has sent demand letters to all the -- to the\n\n15    estates and to the attorney, for the permanent guardian\n\n16    of the decedent's wife, demanding that any more proceeds\n\n17    from the estate be sent to them directly, instead of\n\n18    what the contract states, which is to the GWB -- I mean\n19    the --\n20                   THE COURT:     Is that why people do\n21    interpleaders and put money in registry of the Court?\n22                   MS. LEE:     That would be great, but I don't\n\n23    know if people are going to do that.\n\n24                   THE COURT:     That's their issue, I guess.\n\n25                   MS.

It specifically states anything concerning --\n\n 4   anything concerning the estate is in this Court, not\n\n 5   just Tarrant County, but it says Tarrant County, Probate\n\n 6   Court No. 2.\n\n 7                   MR.

But\n 3    second of all, lots of copies go around when it concerns\n\n 4    these individuals, so I'm not sure\n\n 5                    MR.

But then that's -- so\n18    how did we get here to         how did we get here to me,\n19    then, if Don Windle        he's been off the bench long\n20    enough for Bonnie what's-her-face to be elected once, at\n21    least --\n22                    MS.

She may have\n\n 7    been -- in 2005, he may have still been on bench, but I\n\n 8    don't know the day he left, he retired.\n\n 9                     MR. SMITH:     It doesn't matter.        It talks\n10    about when you have a dispute, at that time you look and\n11    see who's on the bench.\n\n12                     MS.

But I'm\n\n 4     just saying, I can be sympathetic to your situation, but\n\n 5     still not feel like I have the authority to do it.\n\n 6                     MS.

It is the\n 7     Pentex Foundation lawsuit is suing my clients and\n\n 8     Howard Kirk Gibbs for attorney fees that were paid\n\n 9     inappropriately through the estate.               That's exactly what\n\n10     the lawsuit is.     Through the estate of Bert Gibbs, this\n11     estate, in this Court.        They're suing my clients --\n\n12                      THE COURT:     But the estate is not a party.\n13                      MS. LEE:     Correct.    Because they won't\n\n14                      THE COURT:     Doesn't that say it all,\n15     though?\n\n16                      MS. LEE:     Well, I can't even put him in as\n\n17     a third-party defendant, because Ken is going to sue\n18     himself?     Then he violates the family settlement\n19     agreement.     It's the family settlement agreement that\n20     they're trying to avoid.\n21                      I did request the Court that the -- that\n\n22     he's not being sued in his proper capacity.

If you look at their\n\n14    pleadings, there's not a hint that the estate is\n15    involved in this.      It is involved a GWB Trust, which was\n\n16    an entity created\n17                     THE COURT:    To receive from the estate.\n\n18                     MR.

On page five of that\n21    case, I know I didn't give you a copy, but the Court\n\n22                     THE COURT:     I read SWEPI, I just don't\n\n23    remember the -- I mean, everybody -- it's referred to a\n\n24    lot, that and Huie v. DeShazo, SWEPI, there's a bunch of\n\n25    them, there's a number of them.

SMITH:      It was a mandamus case out of\n\n 2    the Supreme Court.      And what they found was the interest\n\n 3    had passed to the decedents.          And they said the fact no\n\n 4    partnership property or partnership interests are\n\n s    currently held by the estate also distinguishes it from\n 6    prior authority.      Here's the case, your Honor.\n\n 7                      So the first question is, does this, in a\n 8     jurisdictional analysis, looking at their pleading,\n 9    which they conceded doesn't involve the estate, is the\n\n10    controlling issue settlement petitioner distribution of\n\n11    an estate?      No, it's not, because that's already\n12    happened.\n\n13                      And so if that is the case, this Court does\n\n14    not have exclusive jurisdiction.              That's the teaching of\n\n15    SWEPI.    And SWEPI was cited a little bit later, but I\n16    don't know if I can pronounce it right, Puig, is the\n\n17    Court familiar with this case?\n\n18                      THE COURT:     It doesn't ring a bell, right\n19     this minute.\n20                      MR. SMITH:     Okay.        And there's another\n21     Supreme Court case a couple of years back and they cited\n\n22     SWEPI.   And what they said was, what you then do, if you\n23     don't have exclusive jurisdiction, you do the dominant\n\n24     jurisdiction analysis.        And that's where we believe\n\n25\n\n                               CRC for Wells Reporting\n     632                             817-524-6644\n\f                                                                              Page 54\n                   EXCERPT MOTION HEARING • July 31, 2014\n\n 1     has now got dominant jurisdiction over the proceedings.\n\n 2                     And even though the issues are different,\n\n 3     the guide for this Court is whether parties could be\n\n 4     joined and, if feasible, under the compulsory\n\n 5     counterclaim.\n\n 6                     In other words, if you could add the\n\n 7     parties and make it a complete proceeding, then the\n\n 8     first filed suit is the one that's dominant.\n\n 9                     And I don't know mean to insult the Court,\n\n10     but I got a Fort Worth case out of 1995 Dallas Fire\n\n11     Insurance versus Davis, and what it tells -- what its\n\n12     holding is, is that when the principle of dominant\n\n13     jurisdiction applies, the trial court in the second\n\n14     action has no discretion to refuse to abate, and the\n\n15     first court has no discretion to abate the suit to the\n\n16     second court.\n\n17                     So it sounds mandatory, to me, that if this\n\n18     Court doesn't have exclusive jurisdiction, if it•s got\n19     concurrent jurisdiction, and that's arguably what\n\n20     they're saying by virtue of 34.001, we then lead to our\n21     dominant jurisdiction analysis.           And under the cases\n\n22     we've given you, you have to abate this case, in its\n\n23     entirety, to the Fannin county proceedings.\n\n24                     That's the position of Pentex Foundation.\n\n25     And I can go into some of the facts, but\n\n                             CRC for Wells Reporting\n     633                          817-524-6644                                         \\\n                                                    e2Bbd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-14a0a6eel79~ •.\n\f                                                                        Page 55\n                    EXCERPT MOTION HEARING        ~   July 31, 2014\n\n 1   read the pleading, which you're supposed to do, that's\n\n 2   all you do.

The one   -- the last one he spoke about,\n10   the Puig, it talks about comparing county courts of law\n\n11   with probate courts.        And it's not concerning\n\n12   transferring the case with the authority to go into the\n\n13   estate of Bert Gibbs or transferring a case for probate\n\n14   proceedings into another -- into the probate court.\n\n15                    The other case, SWEPI, again, they're\n\n16   talking -- it's not --\n\n17                    THE COURT:      It just seems like SWEPI fits,\n\n18   though.\n19                    MS.

It's a contract --\n\n14                     THE COURT:     But the estate is not party in\n\n15    Fannin county.\n\n16                     MS.

And to continue my lecture, I think thing\n\n4     there are 18 of us now, in Texas.\n\n 5                      But be that as it may, judicial economy is\n\n 6    one of the -- a driving force, but it's not the\n\n 7    only-- it's not the only consideration.\n\n 8                       So I'm going to make a ruling that I'm\n\n 9    going to deny the transfer of anything, without\n\n10    prejudice, at this point in time.\n\n11                      As far as your motion your show authority,\n\n12    I think you've been put on notice, you ever come back to\n\n13    this Court, you're going to need to comply or going to\n\n14    need show in more detail why you don't need to comply\n\n15    with more detail and strict predicate to your -- to your\n\n16    hiring.

Accordingly, please call Tina Clay for\n                a pre-trial hearing and trial date in which avoids the last week of December.\n                This paragraph is not to be interpreted as having any impact on the scheduling of\n                restraining orders, injunctive relief, and other time sensitive matters, if any.\n\n                Finally, this Court has not ordered mediation in, I believe, three cases in\n\n\n       642                                                              1\n\fFilters Used:                                                                                            Date Printed: 9/26/2014\n1 Tagged   Record                                        Email Report                                    Time Printed: 12:45PM\n                                                                                                             Printed By: LAURA\n                                                                Form Format\n\n\n\n                over 30 years. I sincerely doubt yours will be the fourth. Accordingly, note that\n                the scheduling order gives you a date by which the parties will pick a mediator,\n                mediate, and report back to the Court. If this date is not met, the Court will take\n                these actions on your behalf.\n\n                       Please call me if you have any questions,\n\n                       Lin Morrisett,\n                       Associate Judge,\n                       Probate Court #2,\n                       Tarrant County\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        2                             Page\n        643\n\fTexas Comptroller of Public Accounts- Taxable Entity Search Results                                Page 1 of 1\n\n\n\n\n             '\n\n\n\n\n       *\n         '                                                                    Taxable Entity Search\n                 '\n\n\n\n\n                              Business Name Pentex Foundation was not found.\n\n                   You may also call the Business Information Line at 1-800-252-1386.\n             Should you require assistance concerning the taxable entity information presented,\n                                  please contact tax.help@cpa.state.tx.us.\n\n\n   texas.gov         Statewide Search from the Texas State Library   State Link Policy    Texas Homeland\n                                                   Security\n          Susan Combs, Texas Comptroller • Window on State Government • Contact Us\n   Privacy and Security Policy Accessibility Policy Link Policy Public Information Act Compact\n                                             with Texans\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 Exhibit (\n\n                                                                                   Page      I\n   644\nhttps://mycpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/servlet/cpa.app.coa.CoaSearch?Search_Nm=Pentex+Fou...\n\fTexas Comptroller of Public Accounts- Taxable Entity Search Results                               Page 1 of 1\n\n\n\n\n  f) \\X'indow on State Gon:rnrncnt\n\n                                                                             Taxable Entity Search\n\n\n                         Business Name Pentex Royalty Trust was not found.\n\n                 You may also call the Business Information Line at 1-800-252-1386.\n           Should you require assistance concerning the taxable entity information presented,\n                                please contact tax.help!(i:;cpa.state .tx. us.\n\n\n   texas.gov    Statewide Search from the Texas State Library       State Link Policy   Texas Homeland\n                                                 Security\n          Susan Combs, Texas Comptroller • Window on State Government • Contact Us\n   Privacy and Security Policy Accessibility Policy   Link Policy Public Information Act Compact\n                                             with Texans\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  Exhibit   L\n                                                                                    Page    ;?\n    645\nhttps://mycpa. cpa. state. tx. us/coa!servletlcpa.app.coa.

Movant specially appears is not voluntarily appearing for purposes of questioning or\n       examination, rather he is appearing out of deference to this Court to present this Motion.\n\n    3. Movant further avers that he is not a party to this cause and is not current counsel for any party\n       herein, he previously represented the plaintiff in this cause, thus any information or testimony\n       sought would be protected by attorney client privilege. TRE 503.\n\n     4. Movant further avers that he is barred by the Rules of the State Bar of Texas from disclosing\n        privileged attorney client information.\n\n     5. Movant avers that TRCP 12 by its language envisions only the current counsel of record as\n        \"challenged attorney\" for a party to be subject of a Motion to Show Authority.\n\n     6. Movant avers that TRCP 12 by its language mandates that a Motion to Show Authority must be\n        sworn and served upon the \"challenged attorney\" (i.e. counsel of record) at least 10 days before\n        the hearing.\n\n     7. Movant avers that there is not a properly sworn motion under TRCP 12 that has been on file for\n        10 days prior to the hearing before this Court referenced herein, therefore Movant should not be\n        required to appear and testify.\n\n\n\n    652\n\f8. Movant avers that hearings on a properly filed TRCP 12 motion would be limited to exactly\n   what the rule covers, that is the attorney's authority to act on behalf of the client, and nothing\n   else.\n\n9. Movant avers that there is no endorsement of or by whoever served the subpoena. 1RCP 16\n\n10. Movant avers that there is no return on the subpoena showing who served the subpoena and\n    whether that person was authorized to serve under TRCP 103 or 106(a)(2).\n\n11. Movant avers that there is no proper proof of service on file with the Court. TRCP 176.5(b)\n\n12. Movant avers that he was not provided a witness fee at the time of purported service and the\n    failure to provide the fee renders the service and subpoena void. CPRC 22.001; 1RCP 176.5(a);\n    DM -0342\n\n13. Movant avers that the subpoena referenced herein is a discovery subpoena.\n\n14. Movant avers that he is not aware of any court order for him to appear or produce discovery.\n\n15. Movant objects to the subpoena and further requests that the court quash the subpoena impose\n    the limitations, restrictions, and modifications to the subpoena as sought herein, because the\n    subpoena is improper or unreasonable and oppressive and compliance would result in serious\n    and irreparable harm to movant.\n\n 16. The testimony sought and the documents requested in the subpoena are not relevant to the\n     issues in this action and are protected from compulsory disclosure by the work product and\n     attorney client privilege and is not governed by any exceptions therein. TRE 503.\n\n         WHEREFORE, movant requests that this Court hear this motion and make an order\n quashing the subpoena and awarding movant the reasonable costs of this motion, including\n attorney's fees, together with other relief as the Court may find appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nJoh Skotnik, sbn 18475150\nP.

This case concerns and arises from contract entered into between the\n\n defendants and the predecessor in interest to Plaintiff and Intervenor. 2 The\n\n Contract itself, at paragraph 4 ofthe contract references a buyout and liquidated\n\n damages provision of $5,000,000, as follows:\n\n        It is understood and agreed that Gibbs may cancel or nullify this\n        contract only under the following conditions: a) If Gibbs pays over to\n        Barcroft the sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00 US) in full, in\n        addition to any money received prior to said one time payment, as\n        liquidated damages and full settlement of all consideration on Gibbs\n        part.\n\n Contract ,-r 4 (emphasis original). The present dispute involves allegations that in\n\n excess of a million dollars were not distributed pursuant to the terms of the\n\n Contract.

Contractual venue provisions are mandatory and enforceable. Section\n\n 15.020 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code applies to a \"major\n\n transaction,\" which is defined as a transaction evidenced by a written agreement\n\n and which involves $1 million or more:\n\n         (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an action arising\n        from a major transaction may not be brought in a county if:\n\n                (1) the party bringing the action has agreed in writing\n                that an action arising from the transaction may not be\n                brought in that county, and the action may be brought in\n                another county of this state or in another jurisdiction; or\n\n                (2) the party bringing the action has agreed in writing\n                that an action arising from the transaction must be\n                brought in another county of this state or in another\n                jurisdiction, and the action may be brought in that other\n                county, under this section or otherwise, or in that other\n                jurisdiction.\n\n TEX. CIV. PRAC.     & REM. CODE§ 15.020. It is the firm and well-established policy\n\n in this State to give force and effect to forum selection clauses:\n\n        In general, forum-selection clauses should be given full effect, and\n        subjecting a party to trial in a forum other than the contractually\n        chosen one amounts to \"'clear harassment' ... injecting inefficiency\n        by enabling forum-shopping, wasting judicial resources, delaying\n        adjudication on the merits, and skewing settlement dynamics .... \"\n\n In re AutoNation, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 667-68 (Tex. 2006).\n\n\n\n MOTION TO RECONSIDER ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE ... PAGE 4\n\n\n\n\n663\n\f        6.      This is a major transaction as defined by law. A \"major transaction\"\n\n is a transaction evidenced by a written agreement under which a person pays or\n\n receives, or is obligated to pay or entitled to receive, consideration with an\n\n aggregate stated value equal to or greater than one million. Accordingly, the\n\n Contract constitutes a \"major transaction\" for purposes of section 15.020 because\n\n it expressly provides- in paragraph 4- for the payment of \"consideration with an\n\n aggregate stated value\" of more than $ 1 million. Although movants assert that\n\n their damages directly relate to the Contract, associated claims trigger the\n\n mandatory venue if they \"arise\" from a major transaction.\n\n        We concluded that the forum selection clause itself applied more\n        broadly than to mere sales transactions because it applied to \"any\n        dispute arising out or' the agreement and the trial court erred in\n        refusing to enforce the forum selection clause.\n\n Fisher, 433 S.

Maintenance of the action in the county of suit would work an\n                injustice to the movant considering the movant's economic and\n                personal hardship.\n\n        2.

A copy of the Contract\n\n  (consisting of 9 pages) is attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\", and is incorporated by reference for\n\n  herein for all purposes.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     2\n676\n\f      37.

In addition, under the terms of the Contract, Plaintiff was to receive 30% of all proceeds\n\n      from any lawsuit involving Ken, Candy and Howard. At the time the Contract was agreed to and\n\n      executed, there was an Abstract of Judgment filed in Denton County [Document Number 2008-\n\n      38029] against Ken, Candy and Howard in the amount of$911,252.87 plus $149,546.34 in\n\n      interest, in favor of Kip H.

Plaintiff would ask the court to order that the provisions of the Contract be fully enforced\n\n      without delay; and, that the proper gas companies be notified of the action.\n\n      41.

Below are the relevant provisions of the Contract for Sale of Land, Mineral Rights\n\nand Royalties (\"CSL\"):\n\n                  First paragraph provides that Candy, Ken, and Howard Kirk Gibbs,\n                 collectively \"Gibbs,\" will sell thirty percent (30%) of all land, mineral\n                 rights, royalties, and any other monies or assets which they receive from\n                 (1) the Estate of Bert Gibbs; (2) Bert Gibbs and Kathryn Gibbs personally;\n                 (3) any inheritance in any form received by Gibbs now or in the future; (4)\n                 any proceeds from any lawsuits current or that may arise from seven (7)\n                 different persons or trusts; (5) any assets that have previously been passed\n                 to the Gibbs from four ( 4) different persons or trusts, and the list goes on\n                 (collectively the \"Estates\").\n\n                 Section 3(a) provides, as full consideration, \"Barcroft has paid Gibbs total\n                 of twenty-one (21) silver dollars minted by the United Stated Mint.\"\n\n                 Section 4 states: \"it is understood and agreed that Gibbs may cancel or\n                 nullify this contract only under the following conditions: a) If Gibbs pays\n                 over to Barcroft the sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000 US) in full, in\n                 addition to any money received prior to said one time payment, as\n                 liquidated damages and full settlement of all consideration on Gibbs part.\n\nSee Exhibit A.\n\n        4.       It is undisputed that Albert Barcroft is not a licensed attorney and that he drafted\n\nthe CSL. See Exhibit B.\n\n                                         II. NOT A MAJOR TRANSACTION\n\n        5.       A '\"major transaction' means a transaction evidenced by a written agreement\n\nunder which a person pays or receives, or is obligated to pay or receive, consideration with an\n\naggregate stated value equal to or greater than $1 million.\" TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN\n\n§ 15.020(a). Emphasis added.\n\n\n\nKENNETH GIBBS AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO\nMOTION TO RECONSIDER ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE,\nAND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS\nPENTEX FOUNDATION V. GIBBS, ET AL.\n\n687\n\f        6.      There is no Texas case law which affirms that a buyout provision constitutes an\n\nobligation or an entitlement, and no case law which affirms that Section 15.020 of the Texas\n\nCivil Practices & Remedies Code applies to contracts whose lone stated value appears in a\n\nbuyout provision.\n\n        7.      The Contract for Sale of Land (\"the CSL\") posited neither a requirement to pay,\n\nnor a stated value. The sole stated value of anything anywhere in the CSL involved the buyout\n\nprovision, which addressed neither an obligation nor an entitlement. Parties to the CSL were not\n\nrequired to execute the buyout provision. The buyout provision was simply that- an option. One\n\nthat the respective parties might choose to act upon or not. Not an obligation to pay.\n\n        8.      Likewise, Plaintiff and Intervenor's claim of damages in excess of $1 million did\n\nnot and certainly does not render the CSL a major transaction. Plaintiff and Intervenor's\n\nargument, is frankly, ridiculous. If this were allowed by the courts, then every venue provision\n\nwould be mandatory by alleging $1 million in damages.\n\n                              III.   UNCONSCIONABILITY OF CONTRACT\n\n        9.      If the court finds that the CSL is a major transaction, in the alternative, the\n\nmandatory venue provision \"does not apply to an action if the agreement described by this\n\nsection was unconscionable at the time that it was made.\" TEX. Clv. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN§\n\n15.020(d). Whether or not a contract was unconscionable at the time it was formed is a question\n\nof law. Hoover Slovacek LLP v. Walton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1400321\"><a href=\"/opinion/1400321/hoover-slovacek-llp-v-walton/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (Tex. 2006).\n\n        10.     The CSL was unconscionable on multiple levels.\n\n        11.     Grossly one-sided contracts. A contract is unconscionable if it is grossly one-\n\nsided.

The terms alone are unconscionable. In Candy's Affidavit, she provides, \"The\n\ntwenty-one (21) silver coins were just ordinary silver coins, and certainly well circulated. Albert\n\n[Barcroft] never pretended that these coins had any kind of special value to them. In fact, Albert\n\neven stated these coins were taken out of his 'junk' silver. He stated that he needed to provide us\n\nwith something, because it would make the contract valid.\" See Exhibit B.\n\n        13.      So, Albert gave twenty-one (21) silver coins, which had little to no real value, for\n\n30% of basically everything Ken, Candy, and Howard Kirk had ever received or would receive\n\nin the future from any lawsuit, inheritance, business, etc.\n\n        14.     The unconscionable buyout terms were shockingly one-sided and primarily\n\npurposed to benefit Albert, much to the detriment of the other parties. Or, read the CSL, the\n\nHeirs could buy out Albert for $5 million.\n\n        15.      Unauthorized practice of law. Texas courts do not enforce contracts to aid in the\n\nunauthorized practice of law.

Civ. App. -Tyler 1968).\n\n        16.     Correspondence from Albert Barcroft and his wife Pamela clarify without\n\nquestion that Albert practiced law without a license. See Exhibit C. In the summer of 2004,\n\nAlbert entered into a friendship with Howard Kirk. See !d. Sometime later, Albert approached\n\nKen and Candy concerning legal issues the family was experiencing. See Id.         He informed Ken\n\nand Candy that he graduated from law school, could help achieve resolution in the matter of the\n\nEstates, and was able to draft agreements and contracts. See Exhibit B. Albert then drafted the\n\n\nKENNETH GIBBS AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO\nMOTION TO RECONSIDER. ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE,\nAND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS                                                      CAUSE No. CV -14-41665\nPENTEX FOUNDATION V.

He encouraged Ken and Candy to sign the\n\nCSL for their own benefit and counseled them concerning its tenns. See !d.\n\n        17.     Albert's representation of himself as possessing the authority to counsel parties\n\nand to draft legal documents constituted a Class A misdemeanor and was fraud.\n\n                                       IV. MOTION FOR SANCTIONS\n\n        18.     A motion for reconsideration is appropriate in the following circumstances: (1) to\n\naddress an intervening change in controlling law; (2) to consider new evidence not previously\n\navailable; (3) to correct a clear or manifest error of law or fact; or (4) to prevent manifest\n\ninjustice. Fisherman's Harvest, Inc., v. Post, Buckley, Schuh, and Jerigan, Inc., et al., No. G-05-\n\n0151,2008 WL 4277001, at 2 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 10, 2008) (citations omitted). Not liking a ruling\n\nis not a reason to file a motion to reconsider.\n\n        19.     Plaintiff and Intervenor's Motion failed to meet a single criterion for a motion for\n\nreconsideration. The Motion not only mislead the court on the only case that was cited, but the\n\nMotion presented no intervening change in controlling and applicable law, no new evidence, no\n\nerror of law or fact, and no evidence that reconsideration would prevent manifest injustice.\n\n        20.     Given the lack of consideration toward the requirements for a motion for\n\nreconsideration, and given the lack of applicable and substantiating law in the Motion, it is\n\nreasonable to conclude that Plaintiff and Intervenor filed their Motion solely for the purpose of\n\nharassment toward Ken and Candy, and sanctions are appropriate, especially since Ken and\n\nCandy (and counsel) must travel approximately 120 miles to the hearing.\n\n\n\n\nKENNETH GIBBS AND CANDACE WALTON'S RESPONSE TO\nMOTION TO RECONSIDER ORDER TO TRANSFER VENUE,\nAND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS                                                      CAUSE NO.

I will also give you a call in the next\n                couple of days to discuss any matter you '<'.ish \"N:th you fully ll:ve :n Guatemala so I will call you. Is\n                there a better time for you?\n\n                First. I am neither an attorney nor a CPA. and I have nothing to do with the account:ng for GWB Family\n                and Friends Trust. Jack Rankin is the CPt\\ for the trust. and Danny Unger [who I believe you have\n                already spoken to] helps to prepare the numbers to send to Rankin. I suppose you would call me a\n                facilitator.\n\n                To give you a little background. I caiT'e in contact with Howard Kirk in the Summer of 2004 because of\n                another problem he had. As we got to know each other. he told me one of the most incredible stories I\n                had ever heard. At first. I truly did not believe :t. Howard told me that Denton County had killed his\n                father [although his Dad did not die for another 5 months]. and that a JUdge named Don Windle had\n                sided with one of his brothers and stolen his father's entire estate. As I got more involved. I found all of\n                his wild stories were true. I promise Bert Gibbs. on his death bed. that I would do everything I could to\n                save at lest some of his estate for hi~. kids. I kept that promise.\n\n                The worst part of the whole story is that a final judgment was in place for well over the 30 days\n                required for finalization which gave virtually the entire estate to Kip. the other brother: and. in which\n                each Candy. Howard and Ken had a :~.1 million dollar final judgment against them It too was final.\n                and there was talk and action towards tak:ng their assets from them. I found the entire scenario to be\n                totally unfair and unJust\n\n                I have a close friend who is an attorney. I took it to him. I also :nvolved Danny Unger. who was a good\n                friend and is an excellent researcher. Together. we looked for a way to break the final judgment. After\n                about a month of research, we came up with something we thought had a chance to work- a bill of\n                review. We realized it would take a 'ong time. a lot of research and hard work, and money that we\n                really didn't have to expend. Enter Pentex Foundation.\n\n                Pentex Foundation is a private not for profit foundation in Panama with whom I had extensive\n                dealings. I knew they had some money to invest. and I went to them with a proposition·· finance our\n                battle and get a share of what we win. They agreed. and put up S250.000 for expenses. There were\n                many times I thought we would not \\Jet that money back.\n\n                The deal I took back to Candy. Ken <:,nd Howard was simple [they did not know the foundation was\n                involved at that time]. I would get tre money for expenses and do the work for 30% of whatever we\n                recovered. The 30% would include me. John Skolnik [the attorney]. and Danny Unger.

The next 5 years of my life was totally devoted to this\n               case.\n\n               After we were rejected in our first attempt to the Court of Appea:s in Ft. Worth. it became clear that this\n               matter had gone political: and. that if we were going to prevail we needed someone with clout in that\n               court. I started looking. but I found the same thing the Gibbs had found before I came along-- no\n               lawyers wanted to touch this case. After al:. it was over. settled: and. a final judgment was in place.\n                We were close to admitting defeat when Danny told his brother-in-law. Jay Henderson about the\n               case. Jay practices law in Kerrville and Houston. He and I talked a number of times. One day he\n               said, I'm in. Let's see who else we can get. Enter Rickey Brantley. Scott Pelley and Virginia Hammerly.\n               all class mates of Jay's at Baylor. We met several times. Finally. they agreed to take the case. The\n               cost would be 10% for each one of thHrn. and 10% for expenses. total 50%. I took the deal to Candy,\n               Ken and Howard. They all agreed that there was no other chance. everything was already lost. We\n               signed the deal with these guys\n\n               The Ft. Worth Court of Appeals. obviously totally void of conscience or ethics, were putty in the hands of\n               Rickey Brantley. Rickey used the exact same petition that we had filed 7 months earlier [and which\n               was dismissed without hearing in 3 days]: and, the court granted everything we asked for. Although\n               we were still a long way from the finish line, the tide had turned. I think In still have the copy we wrote if\n               you would be interested in reading it. All Rickey did was change the signature page.\n\n               So. that's why the Gibbs' portion was so small. It carne up as each one [Candy. Ken. Howard] started\n               being 2.1 million dollars in debt. erased the judgments on eactl. and gave them what they now have.\n               When I carne in. no lawyer would even talk to them about takin£J their case. and it was over. Now they\n               have something.\n\n               As for the voting shares of which 50% are held by Pentex Royalty Trust. that was a condition placed by\n               Pentex Foundation BEFORE the first dollar was spent. and as part of the original conditions. What we\n               were looking at was a family that hac already cut each other's throats more than once. In the short\n               time I had known them. I had seen them band together to fight a common foe. and then be willing to\n               plow another sibling under. It would take an idiot to go into a situation where there was a lot of money\n               at stake where they could band together a•d vote to hurt or limit another party. We are actually seeing\n               the wisdom of that decision now. because two of the three [Ken and Candy] have decided they do not\n               want to honor the Family Settlement Agreement that everyone agreed to that ended this mess. That\n               agreement calls for the immediate sale of the land; however. it has been well over 4 years, and the\n               main part is not sold [it was not even listed until last summer]. Ken [the Executor of the Estate] has\n               stated publicly that he will never sell the home place. which constitutes about 2/3 of the total land\n               value.\n\n               Pentex Royalty Trust has never usecl its voting powers to force any issue: however. it would use those\n               powers to keep the Gibbs from total·y changing the deal.\n\n               Since Pentex Foundation is. in fact. a foundation. there is no beneficiary. I was compensated out of\n               their share for my services. as was John Skotnik and Danny Unger.\n\n               As for your concerns about the K-1':s. I share your view. PentE•x Royalty Trust. whose sole beneficiary is\n               Pentex Foundation. files a tax return every year. and makes monthly tax deposits on the income it\n               receives. The Estate itself is holding everything up. I have been complaining for the last two weeks.\n               Pentex Royalty Trust was also forced to file an extension it did not want to file. GWB Family and\n               Friends Trust had to file an extension for the same reason. While it is my opinion that Rickey Brantley\n               is one of the best attorneys I have ever seen. especially in that court in Ft. Worth. I am not pleased with;,~~~iii ;.\n               the way he and Ken are handling the Estate. Rickey Brantley is the attorney for the Estate.

I HAVE HAD mill!\nOver 8 years ago, Howard came in to At• s office, and I have regretted it ever\nsince. Our WHOLE life changed from that day till now. All AI ever wanted to\ndo was help you guys. It started with one small problem and escalated into the\nbiggest NIGHTMARE. For YEARS, your family squabbles have interrupted our\nlife. Our family BIRTHDAY's, THANKSGIVINGS, Christmas•, and other\nholidays were not even SACRED t(l you. You KNEW when you called MA~\ntimes, that AI was leaving family 9et-togethers, at my DEEP, HEART-FELT\ndissatisfaction, to meet at Denton restaurants or McKinney locals, to HELP you\nguys with •things that could not wait one more minute!!'. You brother Kip HAD,\nIN FACT, successfully BEATEN and STOLEN everything, ruined your fathers\nhealth and ultimately killed him, and even, including your dignity was stomped on\nat that time. AI invested OUR ENTIRE retirement savings and annual income in\nyour MESS, while I worked and scraped without his help to keep our life and\nmoney affairs in order. FIVE YEARS, he invested time and money and\nwhat EVER it took. SOLELY TO A.ND FOR YOU .... FIVE YEARS .... to get you a\nWIN IN COURT. And NOW, after FOUR MORE years ... month after\nmonth ... year after year ... YOU JVST KEEP STIRRING UP SHIT ... accusing AL\nand everybody and their uncle of cheating you and disrespecting you and the\nICING ON THE CAKE ... is to say that he took advantage of YOU when your son\ndied. AL, for DAMN sure, tried to get you to wait to sign till you were not\nunder stress. SIGNING WAS the RIGHT THING TO DO ... but he wanted you\nto wait. YOU INSISTED on ending all the trials and tribulations and even said\nTO ME and countless others ... that you should have been spending more time\nworrying about raising your kids and family matters than being angry and bitter\nover the contracts. WELL, YOU ARE RIGHT BACK THERE AGAIN. Why don•t\nyou get on some damn medication for OCD. EVERYBODY Knows you need\nit ... and everybody INCLUDING nte, has tried to be tactful and helpful to get\nYOU to a better place and understanding of your life ... for you AND FOR USIIIII\nTWO YEARS ago, I wrote you and told you were raising Al•s blood pressure with\n\n\n\n\n705\n\f1\n                                                             -.\n     all this shit ... and you said you wer•e sorry ond eased up. BUT IT DIDN'T\n    LAST. You have pushed him TOO for now .... he HAS to give up on you, before\n     it kills him. TRY TO REMEMBER, HE IS NOT THE ENEMY ... HE IS THE ONLY\n     REASON YOU HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE (whether you are enjoying it or not).\n    TRY TO REMEMBER THAT KIP DID NOT BEAT YOU OUT OF EVERYTHING.\n    THAT THERE IS NO 'NEGOTIATING' ANYTHING NOW ... the agreements YOU\n    AND YOUR BROTHERS MADE, were made YEARS ago and ordered by a court\n    and judge IN YOUR FAVOR. And at the time .... you were DELIRIOUSLY HAPPY\n    with the deal that was made. NOW. . . . FOLLOW THE DAMN ORDERS, GET US\n    OUR RETIREMENT BACK ... AND l.ET US MOVE ONIIIII Will it take ANOTHER\n    tragedy to OPEN your EYES and your HEART???? DOES the TRAGEDY need to\n    be my HUSBANDS life???? HOW DARE YOU accuse him of deceiving you,\n    disrespecting you, cheating you, .... after ALL he has done for you. He has tried\n    to help put you and your brotf1ers together ... and YOU and YOU alone, stir it all\n    back upllll You are like a bad soap opera .... DARK SHADOWS ... what hateful\n    gloom lingers around the next email or phone call. .. ??? If AI had not taken you\n    guys on ... my life would still be normal. YOUR FAMILY Is responsible TOTAU.Y\n    for the mess I am in now .... AND YOlJ REMEMBER ONE THING, if you\n    remember NOTHING ELSE .... if something happens to MY HUSBAND .... you\n    have to deal with me .... AND l..ADY ... YOU BEUEVE ME WHEN I TELL\n    YOU ...

There is a lot of\n         money out there. My clients - my two clients own 25% of the estate.\n         So if they own 25 percent, they are potentially going to get $2\n         million. Al Barcroft owns a percentage and Howard Kirk Gibbs also\n         owns- he owns 12.5 pecent. ...

Sensing the validity of the above, the Defendants seek to assert an\n\n exception to mandatory venue by attempting to assert that the Contract was\n\n unconscionable. It should be noted that- despite raising other affirmative\n\n defenses - avoidance of the contract on the basis of unenforceability has not been\n\n alleged as an affirmative defense, as would be required by Rule 94. 5 Nowhere\n\n does it appear in the Defendant's lengthy motion and answer on file with this\n\n\n\n         5.      With respect to this alleged claim in avoidance of the Contract, they\n\n first claim that the Contract was one-sided. This is non-sense. Defendants' own\n\n responsive evidence, attached as Exhibit \"C\" to their Response, is an email from\n\n Albert Barcroft. Mr. Barcroft was Movants' predecessor in interest in the\n\n Contract. He relates in Defendant's Exhibit \"C\" that at the time of the Contract's\n\n inception, the three Gibbs siblings had already lost everything from their parents'\n\n estates. A final judgment was in place granting almost the entirety of the estate to\n\n\n         5\n                \"In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively ... any\n other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\" TEX.

The goal was successful after five years of tedious work. The\n\n Defendants now receive funds from their parents' estates that they would have\n\n otherwise never seen. This Contract was imminently fair, given that it converted\n\n the proverbial sow's ear of an adverse judgment into the silk purse of recovery.\n\n         6.      Next, the Defendants assert that Mr. Barcroft practiced law without a\n\n license, and after all these years the Contract is now not enforceable. This too is a\n\n fallacy. Again, referring to the Defendant's Exhibit C, Mr. Barcroft expressly\n\n denies being an attorney. The Contract itself states, in paragraph 3, subpart c, that\n\n \"Barcroft, at his expense, will provide legal counsel by acquiring a licensed\n\n attorney .... \" Mr. Barcroft specifically denies ever holding himself out as an\n\n attorney in Plaintiffs Exhibit 3, at paragraph 5. Importantly, Howard Gibbs\n\n reaffirms this:\n\n        Al never stated that he was an attorney, and never offered to represent\n        any of us. . . . I was at every meeting in which Candy and Ken met\n        with Al, and Al never said he was an attorney or could represent us in\n        any way. . . .

I metAl Barcroft (\"AI\") through a mutual acquaintance in October of2004. I had a legal\nproblem with a criminal charge of simulated legal process against me in Denton County. I was\nhaving trouble getting an attorney to represent me because of the situation, and because I had no\nmoney. Al immediately told me about John Skotnik (\"John\"), who he said was an attorney, and\na personal friend of his. AI said that he would try to get John to talk to me. He did arrange a\nmeeting, and John represented me in the County Court of Denton County, and was able to get the\nsentence already against me greatly reduced. He did not charge me for what he did because I\nhad no money. I have always believed that AI paid John because he thought I had been unfairly\nconvicted, but I don't know that for sure.\n\n2.       AI never said he was an attorney, and never offered to represent any of us. He never\ncharged us or asked for payment for any of the things he did other than his share of the contract\nsigned on May 10, 2005 by my brother Ken, my sister Candy Walton, myself, and AI, said\ndocument entitled ''Contract for Sale of Land, Mineral Rights and Royalties, and all other\nAssets or Monies Received from the Estate of Bert Hughes Gibbs, Kathryn G. Gibbs, and/or\nthe Mary L. Houseworth Trust(s) or 'The Kathryn Houseworth Gibbs Irrevocable Trust\"'\n(\"CSL\") (See Exhibit \"A\"). After we signed the CSL, we were all in it together, and AI treated\nus all like the partners we were. We all discussed and got a vote on everything we did. AI never\noverrode any of us on any issue from the very beginning, even though he had the votes to do it.\n\n3.      At first mention of something I was charged with in court, he told me about John. I was\nat every meeting in which Candy and Ken met with Al, and Al never said he was an attorney or\ncould represent us in any way. After the CSL was signed, we all worked together and discussed\nevery issue as a team. Candy and I had as much input as Al did.\n\n4.      There was no mention of Al's education in any of the meetings or conversations leading\nup to the signing of the CSL. I would remember if he had said he was an attorney or had gone to\nlaw school while we were negotiating a contract. He did not.\n\n\n\n                                                                                       I\n715                                                                                     I\n\f5.       AI talked with us, and we explained about how our inheritance had been stolen from us.\nAt first, he did not believe what we told him. He stated that he would not get involved in the\nwhole mess, but that he would try to get John to help me on the criminal issue. But when he saw\nhow my criminal case was handled, he said he would talk to John to see if John would represent\nus in the civil case if he got involved.\n\n6.      AI would meet with us and take notes, usually at a fast food restaurant. Then he would\nsay that he would talk to John. A few days later, he would meet with us again. After a number\nof these meetings, he said something to the effect of: \"I must be crazy, but if you want to sell me\na share of whatever we can get back, I'll put up the money for John's legal fees and for the legal\nresearch needed\". We agreed and sold him 30% of everything that could be saved from our\ninheritance. This is the title and first paragraph of the CSL that reflects the 30% payment:\n                       Coatract for Sale of Land.

Although we each\ngot 7 silver dollars, it was clear that the consideration Al was going to provide was a way to\npossibly get some of our inheritance back, and that it would involve a lot of money from him.\nEven so, Ken stood up, shook Al' s hand, and stated, \"I think we got the better deal on this\",\nreferring to the silver dollars. We all laughed, but it was a true statement.\n\n7.      AI provided everything he said he would, and the proof is in the fact that we were\nultimately successful. Anyone who claims we sold him 30% of our inheritance for 21 silver\ndollars alone is a liar, a fool, or someone that does not know what actually happened. Anyone\nwho believes we would have gotten anything had AI not come along is just plain wrong. Not\nonly had Ken, Candy and I lost all inheritance from both of our parents, there was a seasoned\njudgment against us of well over $1,000,000 (See Exhibit \"B\"). Anybody who wants to steal\nAl's share negotiated in the CSL now is dishonest, ungrateful, and a thief.\n\n\n716                     Page 2 of 4 of How\"'d G;bb' Affidav;t dated   NM\"'      4, 2014\n\f8.      I have received in excess of $1,000,000 as consideration from the CSL. The 7 silver\ndollars I received upon the signing of the CSL was the consideration paid by Al just to establish\nthe contract. Al never told Ken, Candy or me upon any of our numerous meetings that these 7\nsilver dollars each of us was paid was our only consideration. In fact, the excerpt under item #6\nabove states Al receives 30% of any of the estate assets recovered. The remaining 70% of assets\nwas the consideration Ken, Candy and myself would split up after Al received his 30%. This is\nclearly seen on page 4, item #6 of the CSL, in which the division of recovered estate assets is\ndescribed as follows:\n      the panaes, shall be agreed upon by all parttcs hereto. fhc dJVlsJon shall be divided on a\n      basis of 30°/u   10   Barcroft ..B.J4~\"o to Kenneth Vem GJbbs, 23.3J~·u to Candace \\Vahon\n      Gtbbs, and 23.33% to Howard Knk C>bbs.             <tl   each mstance of d1spt:TSal to the partccs.\n\n\nAnyone that claims the only consideration I was to receive from the CSL transaction is 7 silver\ndollars is delusional.\n\n9.      After all parties signed the CSL, Al immediately brought John on board as the attorney,\nhired Danny Unger (\"Danny\") to do legal research, and they all worked constantly on our estate\nissues for the many months. Al worked on it for years.\n\n10.    I don't know who actually wrote the CSL, and neither does Candy, because we had no\nway to know. Neither of us was there when it was written, and Al never stated who wrote it. Al\nwould meet us, take notes, and then say he would talk to John and get back to us. I do know Al\nbrought a couple of contracts to us before the one we signed. I do know that Ken, Candy and I\nadded at least one provision to the last contract before we signed it, and that was section \"h\" of\nthe CSL. AI agreed to the addition.\n\n11.     When Al brought the contract that we finally signed back to us, he told us to read it and\ncheck it any way we wanted. If we agreed, he would meet us to sign it. We had sufficient time\nto have it looked over by an attorney if we wanted to, but none of us had any money, and none of\nus believed that our inheritance would ever be returned anyway. I am positive that had it not\nbeen for Al, our inheritance would have never been returned and Ken, Candy and I would have\nnever been able to pay off the judgment signed by judge Don Windle. I have heard Candy say\nthe same thing many times.\n\n12.    I have personally seen many e-mails written by Candy to Al, and I have personally heard\nCandy tell Al on numerous occasions, that had it not been for him, none of us would have gotten\nanything, and that he was the \"only one who earned his money\".\n\n13.   Prior to the entry of Ms. Christy Lee into the process, Candy had never questioned the\nCSL or Al in any way. She did question almost everything and everyone else, including every\n\n\n717                         Pogo 3 of 4 of How\"d Gibb' Affidovit dmod   N~    b\" 4, 2014\n\f                          '-'.·\nattorney we ever had, and accused most of them of stealing from her. She stated many times that\nAI was the only one who earned his money. None of that changed until Ms. Lee made her entry.\n\n14.     In my opinion, the only thing \"unconscionable\" in this whole affair is Candy and Ken\ntrying to steal Al's share of the CSL when they and myself would have nothing without what he\ndid.\n\nFURTHER, AFFIANT SAYETH NOT.\n\n                      ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND VERIFICATION\n\n                §\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS\n                §\nCOUNTYOFTARRANT §\n\n        BEFORE ME, the undersigned authority, on this day personally appeared Howard Kirk\nGibbs, known to me to be the person whose name is subscribed to the foregoing affidavit, and,\nafter being administered the oath, acknowledged to me that he is a defendant in the therein\nreferenced lawsuit; and, that the foregoing \"Affidavit of Fact\" will be filed in that case or related\nmatters, and the facts stated therein are true, correct, and complete, and given as his own free act\nand of his own personal knowledge under penalty of perjury.\n\n\n\n\n                                                Howard Kirk Gibbs\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBED AND SWORN TO BEFORE ME this 51h day ofNovember, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n718                   Page 4 of 4 of Howard Gibbs Affidavit dated November 4, 20 I 4\n\f                                                                           Denton County\n                                                                          Cynthl• Mitchell\n                                                                               County Cteli(\n                I\nI\n            l                           l     I\n                                                                          Denton.

The court has appropriate jurisdiction under the Texas Trust Code, Texas Probate\n\n      Code, and the Texas Govenunent Code;\n\n                3.       All necessary citations have been issued;\n\n               4.        Defendants each had notice of the setting for trial but did not attend;\n\n                5.      Plaintiff provided evidence proving liability, causation, and damages for all causes\n      of actions pleaded;\n\n               6.       Bert Hughes Gibbs (''Bert\") was the husband of Kathryn Houseworth Gibbs\n\n      (\"Kathryn''), and Candace Gibbs Walton (''Candy\"), Kenneth Vern Gibbs (\"Kenneth\"), and\n\n      Howard Kirk Gibbs (\"Howard Kirk\") were her children;\n\n               7.       On July 17, 1990, Kathryn's mother, Mary L. Houseworth (\"MaryH), created both\n\n      the Mary L. Houseworth Revocable Trust (\"Houseworth Trust\") and the Kathryn Houseworth\n\n      Gibbs Irrevocable Trust (\"Gibbs Trust\");\n\n               8.       On February 7, 1991, Mary signed the First Amendment to the Mary L.\n\n      Houseworth Revocable Trust which added Candy as a co-trustee with Mary, required joint action\n\n      between Mary and Candy, and prohibited unilateral action by Candy as co-trustee;                          ....\n               9.       Upon the death of Mary, the Houseworth Trust, by its own terms, converted to an\n\n      irrevocable trust and the assets of the Houseworth Trust became assets of the Gibbs Trust and\n\n      Kathryn was to receive a mandatory :monthly distribution of not less than $2,000.00 nor more\n\n      than $3,000.00; further, the overall purpose of the trusts were so that Kathryn shall be able to live\n\n      in a manner consistent with her 1990 standard of living;\n\n                10.     Compliance with the purpose and intent of the trusts would be defeated by\n\n      maintaining the cun-ent level of monthly distributions to Kathryn;\n\n\n\n      Page: 2 of9 •    FINALJUDGM~I'll'\n                      (Oibbs.Kat/Fina1Judgment)(lce;01190S]\n\n\n\n\n730\n\f01/25/2005   15:05        21444'-''38                       GIBBS R_E __ R   ..._t               PAGE     03\n\n\n\n\n             11.      The Houseworth Trust provides that all benefits of the trust are held for Kathryn\n\n     and that her children, Candy, KeMeth, Howard Kirk, and Kip Hughes Gibbs (\"Kip'') are the\n     beneficiaries after Kathryn's death;\n\n             12.     The Gibbs Trust designated Mary, Kathryn, Candy, Kenneth, Howard Kirk, and\n\n     Kip as beneficiaries and that~til income was payable to the Houseworth Trust during Mary's\n\n     lifetime, provided that distributions could be made to any beneficiary for health emergencies, and\n\n     stated that Kathryn and any three of the four children could direct income or principal to be\n\n     distributed directly to Kathryn;\n\n             13.     Mary died testate in 1991 ;\n\n             14.     Kathryn is incapable of protecting her own interests and from the importuning of\n\n     her husband and children and will sign ahnost anything for anyone who asks her to do so;\n\n             15.     On and after August 1998, after being terrorized about impending Y2K disasters\n\n     and the importuning of the defendants, Kathryn signed blanket authorizations, later signed by\n\n     Candy, Kenneth, and Howard Kirk, withdrawing $1,015,000.00 from the Gibbs Trust (\"Removed\n\n    Funds\");                                                                                               ~   •'\n\n\n\n             16.     Kathryn was told by defendants that the Removed Funds were to provide for\n\n    staples for the family during the impending crisis;\n\n             17.     The Removed Funds were controlled and/or spent by the defendants;\n\n             18.     $701,021.00 of gold coins and junk metal were purchased with the Removed\n\n    Funds. The balance of the Removed Funds were either !>pent by or distributed to the defendants;\n\n             19.     Plaintiff received $36,200.00 from the Removed Funds which was subsequently\n\n    spent for Kathryn's benefit or deposited with the court;\n\n\n\n                   FINAL JUDQ~EN'f\n                   (Gibbs.K.at1Final1udgment)[lcc;otl90S]\n\n\n\n\n 7~\n\f01/26/2005      15:05      21444'-'98                       GIBBS R_E __R    \\wl                    PAGE     04\n  .'\n\n\n\n\n                20.     Plaintiff did not participate wi.th the defendants in the withdrawal ofthe Removed\n\n       Funds;\n\n                21.     Plaintiff did not consent to the withdrawal of the Removed Funds;\n\n                22.     Plaintiff affmnatively demonstrated to defendants of his disagreement with the\n\n       withdrawal of the Removed Funds;\n\n                23.     Plaintiff demanded that the Removed Funds be accounted for and returned to the\n\n       Gibbs Trust after it was evident that Y2K did not pose any society ending problems;\n\n                24.     Defendants openly and steadfastly refused to comply with plaintiff's demand;\n\n                25.     Each defendant was in a fiduciary relationship with Kathryn Houseworth Gibbs\n\n       (\"Kathryn'1), or, alternatively, a relationship of special trust and confidence giving rise to\n\n       fiduciary duties;\n\n                26.     Each defendant is fully accountable to Kathryn for the Removed Funds;\n\n                27.     Each defendant breached their respective fiduciary obligation to Kathryn;\n\n                28.     The defendants' decision to purchase the gold coins and junk metal was an\n\n       inadvisable, imprudent and improper investment and did not meet any standard of wise or                ....\n       prudent fiduciary management;\n\n                29.     Plaintiff recovered from defendants (i) all of the gold coins and junk metal\n\n       purchased with the Removed Funds, and (ii) the amount of $225,873.03.\n\n                30.     Plaintiff was unable to account for $88,141.97 of the Removed Funds;\n\n                31.     Plaintiff, under court order, sold the gold coins and junk metal for $387,419.03;\n\n       the sale :resulted in a net loss of $313,601.97 to the Gibbs Trust;\n\f01/26/2005    15:05       21444.._,:38                       GIBBS R_E__ R   ·~                   PAGE     05\n\n\n\n\n             32.      The method of resale of the gold coins, approved by court order. was reasonably\n\n     calculated, and diligently pursued, to obtain the highest possible resale cost in value on the gold\n     coins and other precious metals;\n\n             33.      Defendants, primarily Howard Kirk Gibbs, negligently or intention~lly failed to\n\n     comply with federal tax law which resulted in the penalties and interest being incw-red by the\n     Houseworth Trust and the Gibbs Trust;\n\n             34.      The wrongful withdrawal of the Removed Funds directly caused federal income\n\n    tax penalties and interest to be incurred in the amount of $143,843.81 which was subsequently\n    paid by the Houseworth Trust and the Gibbs Trust;\n\n             35.      The attorney fees in the amount of $115,665.12 incurred by plaintiff in his\n\n    capacity as next friend of Kathryn Gibbs and as co-guardian of the estate of Kathryn Houseworth\n\n    Gibbs in an effort to recover the Removed Funds and to recover damages incurred by the\n\n    Houseworth Trust and the Gibbs Trust as a result of defendants' actions       were reasonable and\n\n    necessary;\n\n             36.      The plainti:ffh&incurred actual damages in the amount of$661,252.87;                 ;.,.\n\n\n\n             37.      Five percent is the COITect prejudgment interest rate applicable under the Texas\n\n    Finance Code;\n\n             38.      The conduct of one, some, or all, of the defendants at various stages of this\n\n    litigation has been recalcitrant, obstreperous, abusive, vexatious, dilatory, and engaged in with\n\n    intentional malice, or alternatively, with a reckless disregard for the rights of the trust\n\n    beneficiary, Kathryn; has been engaged in for no good-faith purpose; has been engaged in bad\n\n    faith during the course of this Htigation; and has included the hiring and firing of four separate\n\n    attorneys and multiple dilatory motions;\n\n    PageS of9 •    FIN\"L .JUDGMENT\n                   (Gibbs.Kat!Final Judgment)[lcc;Ot 1905]\n\n\n\n\n  7®\n\f01/25/2005    15:05                                        GIBBS R_E __ R   -....,                   PAGE   05\n\n\n\n\n             39.      The punitive damage award of $250,000.00 is based on the underlying withdrawal\n\n     of $1,015,000.00, the loss of use of the Removed Funds, and the actual damages and bears a\n\n    direct and rational relationship to actual damages incurred in this case and is reasonably\n\n    calculated to accomplish the legitimate pwposes of exemplary dantlges that is act as a deterrent\n\n    to the same or similar conduct by others in the future and to punish wrongdoers;\n\n             40.      The majority of the activity by defendants in this case cannot be excused as\n\n    nonnal defensive tactics or advocacy or litigation proce~s but an abuse of the system;\n\n             41.      Defendants refused continuously and throughout the course of the litigation to\n\n    disclose any meaningful financial infonnation, documents, papers, exhibits, or other matters,\n\n    even though proper request for the same was made;\n\n             42.      There is no way in which any one defendant can be excused or set aside or: limited\n\n    or exculpated from the conduct of the other defendants;\n\n             43.      Defendants conduct is so inextricably intertwined that the court is unable to\n\n    segregate any element of damages, and hence, makes all damages, including those that are\n\n    exemplary, joint and several;                                                                           o>.\n\n\n             44.    The purposes and intentions expressed by Mary in the creation of both the\n\n    Houseworth Trust and the Gibbs Trust have been frustrated through the conduct of defendants,\n\n    and that because of the defendants • conduct of defendants, three of whom are contingent trust\n\n    beneficiaries, that the court must modifY the trusts to exclude any possibility of control by them\n\n    with respect to the trusts or their administration or any ability to cause the withdrawal of funds;\n\n             45.    The conduct of defendants commencing with the withdrawal of the funds from the\n\n    trusts and continuing throughout the coun;e of this litigation was undertaken with the specific\n\n    malicious intent to either defraud or harm or permanently deprive the primary trust beneficiary,\n\n    Page 6 of9-    FINALJUDOMEI'IT\n    ~ibbo.KoUF;\"' '\"''\"'\"\"')[!~'\" l90S)\n\n\n\n 73~\n\f01/26/2005     15:05                                           GIBBS R_E__R       .._,.

The actions of defendants operate as a forfeiture of their interest in both the\n\n     Houseworth Trust and the Gibbs Trust as contingent beneficiaries, or alternatively, if this finding\n\n     is later determined to not be consistent with law in that the defendants conduct does not justify a\n\n     forfeiture, the court finds that such actions by defendants was of such reckless disregard and with\n\n     such malicious intent and caused such harm and damage to plaintiff, that the court orders a\n\n     surcharge against the interest of those contingent beneficiaries equal to their pro rata share of the\n\n     judgment.\n\n               The court therefore renders judgment in favor of plaintiff and against defendants and\n\n     ORDERS that:\n\n               l.

I did not claim to be an attorney, I did not claim I had attended law school, and I did not tell the\n                  Gibbs I could represent them in any manner.          I did not ever ask for, expect or receive\n                  compensation for anything from the Gibbs other than as consideration under the CSL. I did not\n                  try to induce the Gibbs in any way other than to say I would put up money, hire an attorney,\n                  and work hard to get some of their inheritance back. I have many e-mails from Candace\n                  Walton, the last one coming just after Ms. Lee was hired, thanking me for saving their\n                  inheritance. Ms. Lee was able to change all ofthat, and replace it with charges of wrongdoing.\n             6.   I did not draft the CSL without assistance. Contrary to her statement under oath, Candace\n                  Walton had no way to know who drafted the CSL, although she swore to that fact.\n             7. Defendants Candace Walton and Kenneth Gibbs stated as fact that \"John Skotnik drafted the\n                  CSL\" in their original answer in the 336th District Court of Fannin County, Texas, case number\n                  cv-14-41665 (\"lawsuit\") when they were attempting to disqualify John Skotnik.\n             8. Defendants Candace Walton and Kenneth Gibbs stated as fact that \"it is an established fact\n                  that Albert drafted the CSL\" in their Response to Motion for Summary Judgment in the\n                  same lawsuit when the wanted to say Albert Barcroft practiced law without a license.\n             9. There was no discovery from either John Skotnik or Albert Barcroft between the two\n                  \"statements of fact\" that could have resulted in any fact as to who drafted the CSL being\n                  established.\n             10. Candace Walton and Kenneth Gibbs have shown a strong propensity throughout these\n                  proceedings and those in a related case in Tarrant County Probate Court #2, case number 2005-\n                  0000126-2-D, to state as fact that which is not; and, to change their stated facts to me~et\n                                                                                                          their\n                  instant needs.\n                                                             '     PLAINTIFF'S\n                                                             ~       EXHIBIT                                                      \"V   '1~~~.~~~!!.t'.,,\n                                                             ~                                                               \\]t.~ ,~             ~~,v~,\n\n      738                                                    ~         J                                         .      :0,.':;   i                  \\=~\\\n------------------·-------·-·--- ..                          f                         --------------------~~\n                                                                                                                       {~i                            r:,_s;\n                                                                                                                       <,?).\\              ~l\n                                                                                                                        \\~~:}>· ',.        v    J / r,J;\\ .\n                                                                                                                             . tfJ~icC\" /\n\f      11. Everything I did leading up to the signing of the CSL was in business negotiations on my own\n         behalf. I did not give legal advice, I did not represent anybody other than myself or say I\n         could, I did not claim to have attended law school, I did not expect, ask for or receive any\n         compensation from the Gibbs other than later as consideration under the CSL, and I did not tell\n         the Gibbs not to get legal advice before they signed the CSL. None of these charges were\n         made until over 8 years after the fact when Christy Lee became attorney for Candace Walton\n         and Kenneth Gibbs, and started creating baseless allegations and lies to support those\n         allegations. There is absolutely no evidence that any such charges were ever levied in the pre-\n         Lee era, because said allegations were absolutely contrived after Ms. Lee took over, and are\n         false, and the Gibbs did not used to be liars.\n      12. After the signing of the CSL, I immediately hired John Skotnik as attorney to represent the\n         Gibbs' interest. John Skotnik had already represented Howard Gibbs in a criminal matter,\n         showing that I did not hold myself out as an attorney or as someone who could represent\n         another party.\n      13. The false allegation that the CSL was unconscionable because I was practicing Jaw without a\n          license in order to induce the Gibbs into signing the CSL, and because of the consideration\n         given the Gibbs under the CSL is a recent invention of Ms. Lee. The allegation was not made\n          in the Gibbs Original Answer, Counterclaim or Affinnative Defense, nor in any amendments to\n         that answer. Neither was the allegation made in the Original Gibbs Tarrant County lawsuit\n          filed in the Probate Court Number 2 of Tarrant County, case number 2005-0000 126-2-D,\n          which addresses virtually the same issues as the case in Fannin County. After almost a decade\n         and numerous filings in the Fannin County and Tarrant County courts, the Gibbs have\n         apparently just discovered that they were deceived by me while \"practicing law without a\n         license\" into signing an unconscionable contract. That revelation comes strangely at a time\n         when all their other false allegations appear to be falling short.\n      14. As a direct result of the CSL, each of the Gibbs has received well in excess of a million dollars,\n         each has had a final judgment against them of over a million dollars retired, and each stands to\n         receive several more million dollars as was pointed out by Ms. Lee in a hearing in the Tarrant\n         County lawsuit when Ms. Lee stated, \"· • · Your Honor, you have to keep in mind, even\n         though it does look like these are assets that have been transferred out of the estate, there are\n         assets that aren't transferred out of the estate.··There currently is a $6.1 million offer on a\n         piece of property, to pay in full, or a $8.5 million installment agreement over the next five\n         years, that will come to the estate of Bert Gibbs· · ·There is a lot of money out there. My\n         clients •• my two clients own 25 percent of the estate. So      if they own 25 percent, they are\n         potentially going to get $2 million. AI Barcroft owns a percentage and Howard Kirk Gibbs\n         also owns - he owns 12.5 percent...So we have a lot of assets for the estate of Bert Gibbs.\"\n         Every single asset that Ms. Lee refers to in this statement would not belong to the Gibbs save\n         for the CSL and the work and money that I invested into the CSL as consideration.\n\n\n\n\n739\n\f      15. Save for Ms. Lee's false allegations and attempts to get her \"share of the pie\", it is my firm\n          belief that there would be no lawsuit.\n\n  FURTHER, AFFIANT SAYETH NOT.\n\n                                             VERIFICATION\n\n  My name is Albert Lynn Barcroft, my date of birth is August 20, 1946, and my address is Rancho\n  Las Brisas, San Marcos, Livingston, lzabal, Guatemala, Central America; and, I declare under\n  Penalty of Perjury that the foregoing statements are true and correct, and not intended to mislead.\n\n  Executed at San Marcos, Livingston, Izabal, Guatemala on the 4th day of November, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n740\n\f              ·--···   .\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                  CAUSE No.       GA 2001-00196\n\n                            IN RE GUARDIANSHIP OF                                                  )              INTHEPROBATECOURT\n\n                            ESTATE OF KATHRYN H.

What happened is\n         5     when this lawsuit was filed, it was filed specifically\n         6     stating that it was for Pentex Foundation not getting\n         7     attorney fees that it was entitled to from -- from --\n\n         8     from the estate of Bert Gibbs.\n\n         9                     Your Honor, you have to keep in mind, even\n        10     though it does look like these are assets that have been\n        11     transferred out of the estate, there are assets that\n        12     aren't transferred out of the estate.                There currently\n\n        13     is a $6.1 million offer on a piece of property, to pay\n\n        14     in full, or a $8.5 million installment agreement over\n\n        15     the next five years, that will come to the estate of\n        16     Bert Gibbs.\n\n        17                     There is a lot of money out there.                     My\n        18     clients -- my two clients own 25 percent of the estate.\n        19     So if they own 25 percent, they are potentially going to\n        20     get $2 million.     Al Barcroft owns a percentage and\n        21     Howard Kirk Gibbs also owns --he owns 12.5 percent.                           So\n        22     we have a lot of assets for the estate of Bert Gibbs.\n        23                     And we filed an amended answer in the\n\n        24     Fannin county case, because what they\n\n        25     allege -- and       what they allege is exactly what\n\n                                      CRC for Wells Reporting\n                                           817-524-6644\n              746                                               e28bd4ed-9dff-4753-b322-\n\f                                                                            3H.n                 PAGE   01\n                                                             FEDEX OFFICE\n                          76B--77'3-0321\n~11/17/2et4\n               €18:€16\n\n\n\n\n                                                NO.

And, Mr. Gibbs, are you\n\n19   affiliated with one of the sides or the other?\n\n20                    MR. GIBBS:   Yes, ma'am, I'm a defendant.     Is\n\n21   that what you mean, Your Honor?\n\n22                    THE COURT:   Well, you're sitting at plaintiff's\n\n23   table.   So, my question is, are you sort of affiliated with\n\n24   them or is that just where the other chair was?\n\n25                    MS. LEE:   No, I requested for him to sit over at\n\n\n\n                            Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                               (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         5\n\n\n\n 1   my table and he wanted to sit over there by them.     You'll find\n\n 2   out --\n\n 3                  THE COURT:    That's fine.   At some point there\n\n 4   will be a division of time, it will be based on the side that\n\n 5   you're affiliated with to some degree.\n\n 6                  MR. SMITH:    I think it's fair to say he's\n\n 7   aligned with my clients in the majority of the relief\n\n 8   requested.\n\n 9                  THE COURT:    Okay.   We have a variety of motions\n\n10   that were filed and we had some filed here at the end that -- I\n\n11   guess, the Court's practice has been a little bit -- well, for\n\n12   lack of a better word -- informal in that the Court's\n\n13   coordinator nor the Court were setting some of the motions or\n\n14   signing the motions for the hearing today.    Though, I'm left\n\n15   with the impression some of the parties may be of the opinion\n\n16   that they were actually being included in today's hearing, and\n\n17   I need to know what the position of the parties are on that\n\n18   issue so we can sort this out.\n\n19                  MR. SMITH:    Judge, if it may help things, I\n\n20   wrote down a summary of what I think is pending based on the\n\n21   order in which they were filed.\n\n22                  THE COURT:    And to the point that I was asking,\n\n23   though, is it your impression that those are live to be\n\n24   addressed, as well, today?\n\n25                  MR. SMITH:    This is my impression.   There's some\n\n\n\n                           Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                              (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                          6\n\n\n\n 1   other things that have been filed --\n\n 2                   MS. LEE:   No.\n\n 3                   MR. SMITH:   Let me finish, please.   Other things\n\n 4   that have been filed that are not set.    This is what I believe\n\n 5   is set for today.\n\n 6                   MS. LEE:   Okay.   I disagree, Your Honor.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:   Okay.\n\n 8                   MS. LEE:   For his list, first -- well, the\n\n 9   motion to quash which concerns -- yes, September 30th.       Also,\n\n10   the October 13th subpoenas that were filed, that is also in his\n\n11   motion to quash which he doesn't have here on his list.       The\n\n12   motion to issue authority, yes; motion to transfer venue; first\n\n13   supplement to motion to show authority, yes; motion to strike\n\n14   intervention that was filed -- that's actually on our notice to\n\n15   -- for the hearing when we first set the hearing.     So, motion\n\n16   to strike intervention is not on his list.    I have the notice\n\n17   for hearing for that, Your Honor.    Motion for leave to file\n\n18   third-party petition, yes.\n\n19                   The thing that's mostly up for dispute is the --\n\n20   well, besides on his list -- we have a motion to strike\n\n21   intervention which should be on this list.    And then the motion\n\n22   for partial summary judgment, I never received notice of, an\n\n23   e-mail.   We have a Rule 11 agreement, Your Honor, which is\n\n24   where we -- for judicial economy and just because of where\n\n25   everybody lives, we had been sending things through e-mail.\n\n\n\n                            Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                               (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         7\n\n\n\n 1   And the Rule 11 agreement provides that if the party does not\n\n 2   respond back stating \"I have received the document,\" that it\n\n 3   needs -- that alternate service needs to be made, meaning it\n\n 4   needs to be faxed or mailed.     And I was never faxed nor mailed\n\n 5   the -- his notice -- his fiat saying that this motion for\n\n 6   partial summary judgment would be heard today.\n\n 7                    And there seems to be -- I mean, I truly did not\n\n 8   receive notice on that to be heard.    And we have enough motions\n\n 9   to be heard anyway.    And I did respond to it only when I was\n\n10   responding -- there was other motions that were filed on the\n\n11   same day I filed my response to motion for partial summary\n\n12   judgment.    I also filed a motion to compel discovery, but\n\n13   that's not being heard today.\n\n14                    And I do have -- for the motion to strike, I\n\n15   believe I do have the notice of hearing which was filed with\n\n16   the Court.    It was -- the one -- the original hearing to be\n\n17   heard was the motion to show authority, the motion to transfer\n\n18   venue, and, I believe, the motion to strike.     And I -- let me\n\n19   check in my folder to see if I happen to have that.\n\n20                    MR. SMITH:   Judge, I do have a serious problem\n\n21   with the motion for summary judgment, the contention of Counsel\n\n22   that she did not get notice of that.    She asked me yesterday to\n\n23   send her the notice.    I did.   She's claiming not to have\n\n24   received it, but I have very high confidence that she did\n\n25   receive it based upon subsequent correspondence.     And this is a\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                            8\n\n\n\n 1   critical motion.    I think how you decide on the motion for\n\n 2   summary judgment will make a lot of this stuff resolve itself.\n\n 3   That's why it's such a critical motion for us to solve.\n\n 4                     THE COURT:    Which would mean it would be very\n\n 5   important to make sure she actually had adequate notice --\n\n 6                     MS. LEE:     Right.\n\n 7                     THE COURT:    -- if it's that significant.\n\n 8                     MR. SMITH:    I've got proof of it.\n\n 9                     MS. LEE:   No, Your Honor, I --\n\n10                     THE COURT:    I guess my point is this:   How much\n\n11   time does she need?\n\n12                     MR. SMITH:    It's been on file for six weeks.\n\n13                     THE COURT:    Okay.   How much time does she need\n\n14   for notice?\n\n15                     MR. SMITH:    She needs 21 days.   I gave her April\n\n16   -- August 21st.\n\n17                     MS. LEE:   Your Honor, I did not receive that.\n\n18   And what he is conferring --\n\n19                     THE COURT:    What is it going to hurt to have 21\n\n20   more days?\n\n21                     MR. SMITH:    What's going to hurt --\n\n22                     THE COURT:    Or, over whatever -- or whatever the\n\n23   amount of time.\n\n24                     MR. SMITH:    I can tell you what it's going to\n\n25   hurt, Your Honor.    When she filed this case in Tarrant County,\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                        9\n\n\n\n 1   she filed a series of lis pendens which has frozen all the\n\n 2   assets that my clients receive in order to fund their defense.\n\n 3   And so, every month that passes by, we're falling further and\n\n 4   further behind and we're looking at risking not being able to\n\n 5   fund our defense because of the lis pendens which has been\n\n 6   filed.\n\n 7                  MS. LEE:    Your Honor --\n\n 8                  MR. SMITH:    And it's a very simple motion.     It's\n\n 9   the crux of this case.    It's how we see the case versus how\n\n10   they see the case.   And I think it's a very simple legal\n\n11   proposition.\n\n12                  THE COURT:    Okay.   Well, and I'm not talking\n\n13   about how simple it is.    You're saying it's a dramatic remedy\n\n14   --\n\n15                  MS. LEE:    Yes.\n\n16                  THE COURT:    -- it's going to define the case.\n\n17                  MS. LEE:    Right.    I --\n\n18                  THE COURT:    Ma'am, if I want you to interrupt, I\n\n19   will ask you to interrupt me.     I understand you're a zealous\n\n20   advocate, but please hold your tongue.      Really?\n\n21                  All right.    I think that it's important that if\n\n22   it's going to be that critical of a motion, that I want to make\n\n23   sure we have solid information whether somebody was served or\n\n24   not and how much time that's going to take.     I'll do everything\n\n25   I can to make sure we get this heard on the 21st day, or\n\n\n\n                              Gale H.

I don't need to have anything overturned on appeal\n\n 3   and redo it again.      So, let's look and see what it is that you\n\n 4   have to demonstrate that there was some notice, if there was in\n\n 5   fact.\n\n 6                       MR. SMITH:    I would be happy to do that, Your\n\n 7   Honor.       Actually, I think it might be important to have Counsel\n\n 8   represent to the Court affirmatively --\n\n 9                       THE COURT:    You need to speak up a little bit.\n\n10                       MR. SMITH:    I'm sorry.    My voice doesn't carry.\n\n11   I think I need to call Counsel for the purpose of establishing\n\n12   notice.\n\n13                       THE COURT:    Okay.   All right.   Ma'am, if you'll\n\n14   raise your right hand.\n\n15                        (Witness sworn by the Court.)\n\n16                       THE COURT:    You may put your hand down.   You may\n\n17   proceed.\n\n18                       MR. SMITH:    Thank you, Your Honor.

I replied\n\n17   to this letter.\n\n18                      MR. SMITH:   I'm just asking to offer the\n\n19   exhibits, Your Honor.\n\n20                      MS.

I don't believe\n\n23   this was a reply, but I do believe that this is associated with\n\n24   the August 22nd e-mail, which is what I had responded to.         The\n\n25   August 22nd e-mail is concerning his letter.      So, I do not --\n\n\n\n                                Gale H.

I believe the rest are\n\n12   accurate.\n\n13                      THE COURT:    Okay.   The exhibit will be admitted\n\n14   -- Plaintiff's 16.\n\n15                      MR.

If you look at the last -- Page 7, you responded to\n\n24   that, didn't you?\n\n25        A.     No, that was from your Rule 11 agreement that you had\n\n\n\n                              Gale H.

I'm sorry, I don't know where you're at.\n\n 8        Q.   Here on the first page.\n\n 9        A.   Okay.\n\n10        Q.   \"Attachments,\" it says, \"Clerk reappearance, Rule 11\n\n11   agreement, motion for partial summary judgment.\"      You see\n\n12   those?\n\n13        A.   Yes.\n\n14        Q.   Okay.    And in the other letters that are contained\n\n15   within Exhibit 16, there's no other reference to this 30-day\n\n16   extension except in your response on Page 7, is there?\n\n17        A.

Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         14\n\n\n\n 1   Honor, which is attached to Number 3 -- on Page 3, it says,\n\n 2   \"Finally, will you be sending me the Rule 11 agreement I sent\n\n 3   you yesterday?\" -- which is at the bottom.     I had my staff call\n\n 4   his office to inquire about what Rule 11 agreement.      They faxed\n\n 5   me a Rule 11 agreement and that is what was referred to.\n\n 6   Unfortunately, my fax is in my Alaska office and my staff is\n\n 7   not -- I only have one in Alaska.      And she's not available to\n\n 8   retrieve the information from the fax because she is seriously\n\n 9   ill right now, so -- and I only found out about this yesterday.\n\n10   I can assure Your Honor I'm prepared for everything else.     I\n\n11   looked in my spam folder.     I do have a spam that holds e-mails.\n\n12   If I knew this was going to be heard -- even though we have all\n\n13   of these other motions to be heard -- I would have been\n\n14   prepared for it.\n\n15                    THE COURT:   Okay.\n\n16                    MR. SMITH:   I have another exhibit, Your Honor.\n\n17   Mr. Gibbs -- I asked him, he's the pro se -- I asked him to\n\n18   print up the e-mails that he got.      He can affirm this if you'd\n\n19   like.   But I have Exhibit 17, which is what he gave me that he\n\n20   had printed up, which is the e-mail that he received.      And I'll\n\n21   offer that at this time if I may.\n\n22                    THE COURT:   On 17?\n\n23                    MR. SMITH:   Yes, ma'am.\n\n24                    THE COURT:   I'm waiting for her response.   I've\n\n25   heard nothing.\n\n\n\n                            Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                               (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                       15\n\n\n\n 1                   MS. LEE:    It purports to be the same e-mail that\n\n 2   he's saying that he sent to me on Exhibit -- Page 1.\n\n 3                   THE COURT:   Okay.    Exhibit 17 is admitted\n\n 4   appearing no objection.\n\n 5                   MR. SMITH:   And, finally, I would offer that I\n\n 6   do not believe that we were asked to fax any Rule 11 agreement.\n\n 7   Most everything we do -- at least from our side of the case --\n\n 8   is done via e-mail, and that's why I gave you the entire e-mail\n\n 9   traffic during this period of time.     I do believe notice was\n\n10   validly served and we're asking to proceed on the motion for\n\n11   partial summary judgment.\n\n12                   THE COURT:   Okay.    Your response.\n\n13                   MS. LEE:    I actually have the Rule 11 agreement\n\n14   that was signed by all parties, and it specifically states that\n\n15   \"The parties agree to e-mail service of all documents\n\n16   pertaining to the matter and to acknowledge the receipt of the\n\n17   service within one business day by e-mail or fax.      If no\n\n18   acknowledgement of the service is forthcoming from the\n\n19   receiving party within one business day, the service shall be\n\n20   effected in an alternate manner pursuant to Rule 21 of the\n\n21   Texas Rule of Civil Procedures.\"\n\n22                   I did not reply to him, Your Honor.     And he can\n\n23   confirm that I do write back saying, \"Received it,\" \"Got it,\"\n\n24   \"Thank you.\"   And I did not reply.    The only reply that he has\n\n25   is three days later on August 23rd -- or, no, I -- on the next\n\n\n\n                            Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                               (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                           16\n\n\n\n 1   day in which, when I reply, I'm replying to the attached letter\n\n 2   for Number 3 on the very next day that says -- where I say,\n\n 3   \"I've not been in my office all day yesterday and I'm getting\n\n 4   the e-mails now, so I'll be responding hopefully by the end of\n\n 5   the day.\"\n\n 6                   We have filed this Rule 11 agreement, Your\n\n 7   Honor, but I have a copy for you if you would like it.\n\n 8                   THE COURT:    You're welcome to mark it if you\n\n 9   desire to offer it at this part of the hearing.\n\n10                   MS. LEE:   Exhibit A, Your Honor.      May I please\n\n11   approach?\n\n12                   THE COURT:    Opposing counsel?\n\n13                   MR. SMITH:    I have no objection.\n\n14                   THE COURT:    Admitted.   All right.    Ms. Lee, what\n\n15   is the configuration of your office?      How do you run your\n\n16   business?\n\n17                   MS. LEE:   I have two offices, Your Honor.      I\n\n18   have one in Alaska and one in Texas.      The one in Alaska is my\n\n19   main office with my server.    Anyone who works for me logs into\n\n20   that server.   That's where my faxes come in to.       I have\n\n21   currently one staff in Alaska, two staff in Texas, but they\n\n22   remote in.   So, everything is done out of my main Alaska\n\n23   office.   When I file documents, we file them through Federal\n\n24   Express overnight from Alaska.\n\n25                   THE COURT:    So, where do you reside?\n\n\n\n                            Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                               (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         17\n\n\n\n 1                     MS. LEE:   My permanent residence is in Alaska,\n\n 2   Your Honor.\n\n 3                     THE COURT:   But you live down here?\n\n 4                     MS. LEE:   I do have a place here, Your Honor,\n\n 5   yes.   And my office in Fort Worth is more of a satellite\n\n 6   office.    I do not have staff there.\n\n 7                     THE COURT:   But you have two people associated\n\n 8   with the Texas office?\n\n 9                     MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.   One of them is\n\n10   located in India and one of them -- she's just there for the\n\n11   military.    She's an attorney -- and the other one is in College\n\n12   Station.\n\n13                     THE COURT:   So, how do you get your\n\n14   correspondence?\n\n15                     MS. LEE:   If it comes to my Texas office, they\n\n16   scan it in and they send it to me.      All e-mails, obviously,\n\n17   will come to my e-mail address that I can access anywhere in\n\n18   the world.    I can log into my server.    I also have it on my\n\n19   iPhone.    So, if Mr. Smith serves me with anything, it goes to\n\n20   my Texas office.    They scan it in and send it to my Alaska\n\n21   office, and then when I'm in town I will take the originals.\n\n22   Or, if I need them to ship to me, I'll have them ship it.\n\n23                     THE COURT:   Do you have anyone else that handles\n\n24   your e-mails for you or you handle them directly yourself?\n\n25                     MS. LEE:   I handle them myself, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n                              Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                 (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                           18\n\n\n\n 1                   THE COURT:    Okay.   And what is the notice\n\n 2   regarding the family medical leave -- how does that play into\n\n 3   where you're spending your time or what you're doing for work\n\n 4   right now?\n\n 5                   MS. LEE:   I spend a lot of time in Texas because\n\n 6   my father is very ill right now.      Opposing Counsel is aware of\n\n 7   that.\n\n 8                   THE COURT:    All right.    Now, anything further on\n\n 9   this point, Mr. Smith?\n\n10                   MR. SMITH:    No, Your Honor.    No.    I'm sorry.\n\n11                   THE COURT:    Anything further, Ms. Lee?\n\n12                   MS. LEE:   Concerning the motion for partial\n\n13   summary judgment, Your Honor?\n\n14                   THE COURT:    Yes.\n\n15                   MS. LEE:   No.    Well, no, Your Honor -- if we're\n\n16   just talking about me receiving notice, then, no.\n\n17                   THE COURT:    Correct.     That's all I'm talking\n\n18   about.   We haven't argued any motions.\n\n19                   All right.    So, when are you saying that you\n\n20   actually received notice of this service?\n\n21                   MS. LEE:     Yesterday.    I received the document,\n\n22   Your Honor, when he provided it to me in August.        I did not\n\n23   receive notice of the hearing until yesterday.         And the only\n\n24   way -- the reason I received notice was because the very\n\n25   beginning of his response to my -- or his objections to my\n\n\n\n                              Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                 (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         19\n\n\n\n 1   response, it stated that I did not file it and it's supposed to\n\n 2   be heard today.    And that was the first time I became aware of\n\n 3   it, through his filing.\n\n 4                     THE COURT:   Okay.   What we're going to do is,\n\n 5   we're going to take up the summary judgment motion at another\n\n 6   time.   We need to pick that time.     I don't have the benefit of\n\n 7   having the Court's coordinator at this location.      Let me make\n\n 8   that contact because this issue needs to be firmed up.\n\n 9                           (A break was taken.)\n\n10                     MR. SMITH:   I was going to try to get your\n\n11   attention before you get off the phone.      Counsel is actually\n\n12   supposed to be in the State for depositions the 13th, 14th, and\n\n13   15th.   She's indicated she is willing to waive the 21-day\n\n14   requirement if you want to do it during that period of time.\n\n15   I'm okay with that.\n\n16                     THE COURT:   I have a capital murder case\n\n17   starting that day.\n\n18                     MR. SMITH:   That seems to take precedence.\n\n19                     THE COURT:   It will probably take us all day to\n\n20   pick on Monday.    We're doing questionnaires.    Unless the\n\n21   parties want to come in on Tuesday at 8 a.m.      And then I need\n\n22   to know how long you expect to argue your motion for summary\n\n23   judgment.   I can accommodate you if you can be here at 8.      I\n\n24   would expect you be done within an hour's time.\n\n25                     MR. SMITH:   I can certainly be done in an hour's\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                        20\n\n\n\n 1   time.   There will be objections, no doubt.    And that will take\n\n 2   more time than the actual motion.     But I think an hour would be\n\n 3   more than enough time.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:    Is that sufficient time for both\n\n 5   sides to finish up their case?\n\n 6                   MS. LEE:   If he's willing to do it in an hour,\n\n 7   then we'll do it in an hour.\n\n 8                   THE COURT:    Okay.   Then we'll do it October 14th\n\n 9   at 8 a.m.\n\n10                   MR. GIBBS:    Your Honor, I have a previous work\n\n11   engagement.   I wanted to come up here for the hearing but I do\n\n12   have a previous engagement.    May I have leave of the Court,\n\n13   please?\n\n14                   THE COURT:    Yes.\n\n15                   MR. GIBBS:    Thank you.\n\n16                   THE COURT:    For the purposes of the summary\n\n17   judgment motion, sir, you can appear by phone if you want.\n\n18   Otherwise, we'll expect you also to have had notice of the\n\n19   setting based on the fact that I'm setting it in court.\n\n20                   MR. GIBBS:    Yes, ma'am.\n\n21                   THE COURT:    So, you won't receive anything else\n\n22   in writing as far as the Court is concerned.     But October 14th\n\n23   at 8 a.m. we'll have the motion for summary judgment.\n\n24                   MR. GIBBS:    Does that mean I need to be here,\n\n25   Your Honor?\n\n\n\n                              Gale H.

GIBBS:    Yes, ma'am.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:    You'll need to make those\n\n 5   arrangements.   Thank you.\n\n 6                   All right.    Let's step through the other motions\n\n 7   that we have.   We have the motion to show authority, motion for\n\n 8   change of venue.\n\n 9                   MS. LEE:     Yes, Your Honor.\n\n10                   THE COURT:    Do the parties think those are\n\n11   appropriate to take up initially?\n\n12                   MS. LEE:     Yes, Your Honor.   Also, I've conferred\n\n13   with opposing Counsel, and the motion to strike was\n\n14   inadvertently left off.     That should be on the list, as well.\n\n15   Motion to strike intervention.\n\n16                   MR. SMITH:    I believe it should have been set,\n\n17   yes, Your Honor.\n\n18                   THE COURT:    Okay.\n\n19                   MR. SMITH:    I tried to be inclusive.    It was set\n\n20   for original filing, which included the motion to show\n\n21   authority as I recall.     The intervention was filed later.\n\n22                   MS. LEE:     June 23rd.\n\n23                   MR. SMITH:    Yeah, it's properly set.\n\n24                   MS. LEE:     And if, Your Honor, we're going by\n\n25   dates, I think that would be Number 2.      So, that would be after\n\n\n\n                              Gale H.

I'm looking at the document\n\n 3   filed on April 25th, motion to show authority, motion for a\n\n 4   change of venue, others.      Is that one of the documents you all\n\n 5   are talking about or have you had amended pleadings since then\n\n 6   on that?\n\n 7                    MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.    I believe there's\n\n 8   also a first supplement to the motion to show authority, as\n\n 9   well.\n\n10                    THE COURT:    Okay.   I have first supplement to\n\n11   motion to show authority filed on September 29th, 2014.        Is\n\n12   that the document you're referring to?\n\n13                    MS.

We\n\n20   shipped it out on -- prior to that.      Should have received it\n\n21   Friday.    But, yes, Your Honor, that would be the document.\n\n22                    THE COURT:    Okay.   Are you expecting that this\n\n23   is supposed to replace the other or is it actually serving to\n\n24   supplement?\n\n25                    MS.

Then I'm looking at the\n\n 2   June 18th filing of the original petition and intervention.\n\n 3   And I am assuming that that's the petition or motion that's\n\n 4   being objected to or challenged.\n\n 5                    MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.\n\n 6                    MR. SMITH:   No.\n\n 7                    THE COURT:   You're saying, no, you have a\n\n 8   supplemental one?\n\n 9                    MR. SMITH:   No, I think the motion to show\n\n10   authority was dealing with the original petition that was filed\n\n11   by Pentex Foundation.\n\n12                    MS. LEE:   I believe she's -- what she's\n\n13   referring to is my -- Your Honor, you're referring to my motion\n\n14   to strike?\n\n15                    THE COURT:   Yes.\n\n16                    MS. LEE:   Yes.\n\n17                    MR. SMITH:   It would be that petition and\n\n18   intervention, yes, Your Honor.\n\n19                    THE COURT:   Okay.   I just want to make sure I\n\n20   have my hands on the documents we're talking about.     All right.\n\n21   I'll receive some input on the motions that y'all want to\n\n22   address first.\n\n23                    MS. LEE:   Your Honor, I think the motion to show\n\n24   authority should be first.    Potentially some housekeeping\n\n25   concerning some subpoenas to -- that I sent out -- which\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         24\n\n\n\n 1   documents have not been provided to me.     That could be very\n\n 2   brief before the motion to show authority.\n\n 3                  THE COURT:    All right.\n\n 4                  MR. SMITH:    Your Honor, it's my position that\n\n 5   the motion to show authority is not properly before the Court.\n\n 6   You probably don't see a whole lot of these.      I don't know if\n\n 7   you're familiar with the Rule but I brought a copy for you.\n\n 8                  THE COURT:    Thank you.\n\n 9                  MR. SMITH:    I have a copy for Counsel, as well.\n\n10   It does require that the motion be sworn.      And this motion --\n\n11   until the first supplement on the 25th, there's not even a hint\n\n12   of an affidavit.   And the affidavit that we got does not -- is\n\n13   not sufficient for what is required.      And I've got a case law\n\n14   to show you, Your Honor.    It's the Townsend case out of\n\n15   Beaumont last year.    It says -- and this is coming right from\n\n16   Rule 12 -- \"requires a sworn statement that the movant believes\n\n17   the suit is being defended without authority.\"      I've got a copy\n\n18   of the affidavit that Counsel submitted to tender to the Court,\n\n19   and all it does is authenticate certain documents.      It doesn't\n\n20   trigger the motion to show authority because Counsel has not\n\n21   stated under oath that the suit is being prosecuted or defended\n\n22   without authority.    Without that, it's not properly before the\n\n23   Court.\n\n24                  THE COURT:    Okay.   Your response.\n\n25                  MS. LEE:    It's throughout the entire document,\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                       25\n\n\n\n 1   Your Honor.   It's throughout all the documents that this is --\n\n 2   they do not have authority.    That this case has been filed --\n\n 3   that is not only in my motion to show authority, but it is in\n\n 4   every single document that we have filed with this Court --\n\n 5   almost every single document that we have filed.     That he --\n\n 6   that Scott Smith is pursuing this case without the authority of\n\n 7   Pentex Foundation -- without the board of Pentex Foundation.\n\n 8   It's throughout -- and so, the affidavit is certifying the\n\n 9   authenticity of the documents that are provided to show that\n\n10   the authority was not appropriately obtained by Mr. Smith nor\n\n11   by Mr. Skotnik when they were hired.     And I do have both of my\n\n12   defendants here who have filed multiple affidavits with this\n\n13   Court and could also profess that this is being filed without\n\n14   authority.\n\n15                   THE COURT:    Okay.   But do you have a sworn\n\n16   motion is his point.    The Rule --\n\n17                   MS. LEE:   All you have -- it's my understanding,\n\n18   Your Honor, that we have to provide an affidavit and I did\n\n19   provide an affidavit.\n\n20                   THE COURT:    Okay.   Well, have you looked at what\n\n21   he's saying the Rule says and what's been printed out?\n\n22                   MS. LEE:   Well, the Rule provides that a sworn\n\n23   written motion, and that was supplemented in my first\n\n24   supplement, Your Honor.\n\n25                   THE COURT:    So, you're saying you filed the\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                          26\n\n\n\n 1   affidavit?\n\n 2                    MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.    It's the affidavit\n\n 3   that he had provided to you, Your Honor.       But, again, I have my\n\n 4   clients here.    We are swearing that he has -- he is prosecuting\n\n 5   this case without authority.     And I can assure you that the\n\n 6   evidence will show that.\n\n 7                    THE COURT:   Well, I'm not ready to hear that\n\n 8   part.    We've got to get over this hurdle.     So, show me --\n\n 9                    MR. SMITH:   Additionally, Your Honor -- I'm\n\n10   sorry.    I don't mean to interrupt.    It does require ten days\n\n11   before the hearing.     And we got this -- I got it on the 25th,\n\n12   you got it today or yesterday.    So, that's not even timely even\n\n13   if it was sufficient.    So, there's a twofold problem here.\n\n14                    MS. LEE:   I don't believe that it does provide\n\n15   it has to be -- you have to have notice of the hearing ten days\n\n16   before the hearing.     The notice was given out in, I believe,\n\n17   June.    This has been on the docket since June.\n\n18                    THE COURT:   Okay.    It says, \"The notice of the\n\n19   motion shall be served upon the challenged attorney at least\n\n20   ten days before the hearing on the motion but the motion must\n\n21   be sworn to.\"    So, was it sworn to?    It sort of presupposes the\n\n22   swearing to the motion will have happened first and then we've\n\n23   got ten days' notice for the hearing.      Are you saying it\n\n24   happened in that order?\n\n25                    MS. LEE:   No, Your Honor.    The motion was\n\n\n\n                              Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                 (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                        27\n\n\n\n 1   originally --\n\n 2                    THE COURT:   I mean, we wanted to make sure we\n\n 3   gave you the time --\n\n 4                    MS. LEE:   Absolutely.\n\n 5                    THE COURT:   -- on the motion for partial summary\n\n 6   judgment, so, in all fairness, don't you think that Mr. Smith\n\n 7   should have time --\n\n 8                    MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:   -- I mean, consistent with the\n\n10   Rules?    I mean, if we're going to play by the rules on one\n\n11   side, we need to play by the rules on the other, don't you\n\n12   think?\n\n13                    MS. LEE:   That's why I'm not really arguing it,\n\n14   Your Honor.\n\n15                    THE COURT:   Okay.   All right.   So, then it would\n\n16   seem that the parties need to address this motion at a time\n\n17   when you have sufficient notice, or are you trying to use it\n\n18   now as a defensive measure to say it shouldn't get to be raised\n\n19   at all?\n\n20                    MR. SMITH:   Absolutely, Your Honor.   It's here,\n\n21   it's set.    And if it's not set properly, it should be\n\n22   dismissed.\n\n23                    MS. LEE:   Your Honor, I have a lot of case law\n\n24   that -- and even in -- I think Mr. Smith can also inform you\n\n25   that he was able -- in another court hearing concerning a\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                         28\n\n\n\n 1   motion to show authority, that he was able to get an extension\n\n 2   to provide additional information.     And even though I could\n\n 3   have argued the exact same thing -- the motion was prime and\n\n 4   ready to be heard -- that it should not be heard and should be\n\n 5   dismissed with prejudice, but that's not what -- and I know\n\n 6   that court's ruling is not precedence on your court.     I'm just\n\n 7   letting you know if we're all going to play fair, he was able\n\n 8   to get an extension for that court hearing to provide\n\n 9   additional information.   I'll be more than happy to supplement\n\n10   those again, get it to this Court tomorrow, next day, and we\n\n11   can have it set on the 13th or another day that is mutually\n\n12   appropriate.\n\n13                    MR. SMITH:   And this is the problem, Your Honor.\n\n14   This is a side show.   We can't get to the meat of the matter if\n\n15   we're playing games with side shows.     We did have a hearing in\n\n16   Tarrant County in July.   And we produced all the information\n\n17   requested in July and August.    We produced about 500 pages of\n\n18   documents, a lot of which supports --\n\n19                    THE COURT:   So, are you ready to go forward on\n\n20   the motion now, Mr. Smith?\n\n21                    MR. SMITH:   I'm not prepared to go forward\n\n22   because it's not properly before the Court.\n\n23                    THE COURT:   Okay.   Well, we can't have it both\n\n24   ways.   I can't give you everything when it's just the ruling\n\n25   that you want.   I mean, if you want to have me rule on it, she\n\n\n\n                            Gale H.

If you want to have the time you need,\n\n 2   then I'll give you the time you need.       You said you already\n\n 3   presented to one, it would seem you would be prepared.\n\n 4   However, if you're not prepared because you did not have\n\n 5   notice, I'm happy to give her the time that she needs.         Which\n\n 6   way do you want it?\n\n 7                     MR. SMITH:    I would prefer to have it properly\n\n 8   set with the supporting affidavit.\n\n 9                     THE COURT:    Okay.   Well, let's do that, then.\n\n10   Okay.   So, what -- when do y'all want to hear it?      I cannot\n\n11   stack multiple hearings on the 14th.       I will be distracted with\n\n12   another matter.    Okay.     I can't have this many hours put into\n\n13   this hearing at that time.       I want to give you the time that\n\n14   you need.   We can set this before that hearing because that one\n\n15   was set for 21 days out.\n\n16                     MS. LEE:    Your Honor, did you say that -- when\n\n17   you had spoken to the clerk -- that you had time on the 20th,\n\n18   or what days were you looking at?\n\n19                     THE COURT:    I was asking about the 20th.    It\n\n20   would be another 8 a.m. start.       The jury trial, we expect that\n\n21   mini-cap to run through the next week.       There's a chance that\n\n22   it would not.     But I would need to start at 8 a.m. on that\n\n23   Monday, the 20th.\n\n24                     MR. SMITH:    I can do it then, Your Honor, but I\n\n25   am set for a jury trial in the 15th District Court.       My guess\n\n\n\n                                Gale H.

Well -- but if we start this\n\n 4   case -- if we start this at 8 a.m., we wouldn't actually have\n\n 5   priority but we would do everything we could to get you out of\n\n 6   here.\n\n 7                    MR. SMITH:   I'm already set.    I can't make it.\n\n 8   That's a jury trial setting.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:   Right.    But having this at 8 a.m.\n\n10   would be earlier than the 8:30 or 9:00.\n\n11                    MR. SMITH:   It's virtually impossible to\n\n12   complete this in an hour.     She subpoenaed several witnesses for\n\n13   this.\n\n14                    THE COURT:   Okay.    Then when -- what works for\n\n15   you?    You don't want it put off.\n\n16                    MR. SMITH:   I'm just saying I can't double-set\n\n17   it if I can't be able to call and tell the Court I'm going to\n\n18   be in a jury trial.\n\n19                    THE COURT:   Right.    I mean, I don't think that's\n\n20   a good use of anybody's time.    You're telling me that your\n\n21   clients want this heard now.    If you want to put it off, I'll\n\n22   be happy to give you a different day.      What timeframe -- what\n\n23   timeframe would you like?\n\n24                    MR.

A contract for sale for land, which is the whole --\n\n18   which is why we're in front of this Court -- was drafted and\n\n19   it's an undisputed fact drafted by an individual, Allen\n\n20   Barcroft, who is not an attorney.

Venue motions are\n\n 9   based upon venue facts pleaded and affidavits, not testimony.\n\n10   So, I would object to anything outside the record.\n\n11                    THE COURT:   What's your response to that, Ms.\n\n12   Lee?\n\n13                    MS. LEE:   I believe -- I have to look at my\n\n14   documents, but I believe that I have the information in my\n\n15   actual motion, Your Honor.\n\n16                    THE COURT:   Is it filed in the form of affidavit\n\n17   or something that supports --\n\n18                    MS. LEE:   No, Your Honor, it's in my motion.     I\n\n19   can move on.    I have other arguments I can argue.\n\n20                    THE COURT:   Okay.   So, there's no evidence to\n\n21   support that.    We'll move on.\n\n22                    MS. LEE:   Yes, Your Honor.    Okay.   So, Mr. Smith\n\n23   provides -- so, this is a mandatory venue provision in the\n\n24   contract because the contract -- there's a five-million-dollar\n\n25   potential buyout.   And he provides that -- according to Rule\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                       33\n\n\n\n 1   15.020(a) of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code -- that \"A\n\n 2   major transaction means a transaction by written agreement\n\n 3   under which a person pays or receives or is obligated to pay or\n\n 4   receive or entitled to receive consideration of more than a\n\n 5   million dollars.\"\n\n 6                     Well, a five-million-dollar buyout provision is\n\n 7   not a provision in which a person has to pay or receive or is\n\n 8   obligated to pay or receive.    His argument is that because it's\n\n 9   a major transaction, that the venue is proper because the\n\n10   document provides that the venue should be in Fannin County,\n\n11   Your Honor.    So, our first argument is that it is not a major\n\n12   transaction.   If you look at the contract for sale, what was\n\n13   exchanged was 21 gold coins in exchange for 30-percent interest\n\n14   into an estate.    Even though I am not -- I'm not certain on\n\n15   what the coins are, they're certainly not worth a million\n\n16   dollars.   Then if you also look at Section 15.020(d) of the\n\n17   Civil Practice and Remedies Code, it provides that \"Any section\n\n18   in a contract that applies an action that is unconscionable at\n\n19   the time that it was made, then that venue provision is not\n\n20   respected.\"\n\n21                     So, again, we have 21 gold coins for 30 percent\n\n22   of the estate.    Which, I believe, a rough estimate, they\n\n23   received maybe several-hundred-thousands of dollars --\n\n24   certainly not a million.    And certainly having a\n\n25   five-million-dollar buyout provision, that seems quite\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                      34\n\n\n\n 1   unconscionable to me.   I'll give you 21 coins.     In order to get\n\n 2   out of this contract, you have to give me five-million dollars.\n\n 3                  So, Section 15.035 states that \"A contract in\n\n 4   writing\" -- \"If a person has contracted in writing to perform\n\n 5   an obligation in a particular county, expressly naming the\n\n 6   county\" -- which is exactly what this contract states -- \"then\n\n 7   the obligation may be brought against him in the county in\n\n 8   which he signed the document or in which the client or the\n\n 9   individual is domiciled.\"    All of the defendants are in Tarrant\n\n10   County; the notary was in Collin; the contract for sale was\n\n11   recorded in Denton County.    But, again, it says \"Fannin County\"\n\n12   on the document.   It is not a major transaction.    So, contrary\n\n13   to opposing party, it's not mandatory because it's not a major\n\n14   transaction.\n\n15                  Now, it also provides in (b) of that provision\n\n16   exactly what I had stated, that if a person pays money arising\n\n17   out of transactions or services entitled primarily for\n\n18   personal, family, household, or agricultural use, then that's\n\n19   where the lawsuit should be -- which should be in Collin County\n\n20   or Tarrant County.\n\n21                  Besides those arguments, Your Honor, John\n\n22   Skotnik who originally filed the document -- he filed the\n\n23   document and he is a municipal court judge.    Also, Mr. Skotnik\n\n24   is, I believe, a municipal judge, as well.    May not be in this\n\n25   county, may be in Grayson County.

There's no\n\n 2   connection to this contract for sale in Fannin County.       It was\n\n 3   recorded in Denton.    The individuals have always lived in\n\n 4   Tarrant.    It was signed in Collin County.    And it's just from\n\n 5   the -- from the convenience of the drafter to say it was in\n\n 6   Fannin County.\n\n 7                    So, we respectfully request that this Court --\n\n 8   that this hearing be moved to another county.      And as Your\n\n 9   Honor will no doubt hear multiple times, there is another\n\n10   lawsuit in Tarrant County that's being heard.      It's similar to\n\n11   this case.    It has almost the same players, but it's concerning\n\n12   the actual money that was into a trust.\n\n13                    So, the contract for sale provided that an\n\n14   entity would be created.      That entity is allegedly the GWB\n\n15   trust.    That lawsuit is in Tarrant County.    We would like to\n\n16   consolidate the cases, but of course the cases can't be\n\n17   consolidated once the cases have been transferred.      So, my\n\n18   clients would like this to be transferred to Tarrant County,\n\n19   and if not, then as 15.35 -- I'm sorry -- 15.035(b), it should\n\n20   be either in Tarrant County or in Collin County where it was\n\n21   signed.    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n22                    MR. SMITH:    Well, the reason I wanted to stick\n\n23   to what was filed is because I think what they filed is\n\n24   different from what you just heard, Your Honor.      The motion to\n\n25   transfer venue before the Court is Pages 3 and 4 of the initial\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                          36\n\n\n\n 1   filing they made.    And what they did was, they filed a motion\n\n 2   to transfer for the convenience of the parties.       It's not a\n\n 3   mandatory venue election they're making.       It's not a permissive\n\n 4   venue if they're saying that they can't get a fair trial here,\n\n 5   prejudice in this county is so great they cannot get a fair and\n\n 6   impartial trial.    That's what they're telling this Court is the\n\n 7   basis for why they want their venue changed.       In response, we\n\n 8   did file -- I don't know if you found our response to the\n\n 9   motion to transfer venue.\n\n10                   THE COURT:   I did.   Let me lay my hands on it.\n\n11                   MR. SMITH:   Essentially, we attached the\n\n12   contract that's really the basis of this whole lawsuit and the\n\n13   one in Tarrant County.    I have an extra copy if you'd like it.\n\n14                   THE COURT:   Well, I'll lay hands on it.     I have\n\n15   it.   The one filed September 4th?\n\n16                   MR. SMITH:   Yes, Your Honor.\n\n17                   THE COURT:   Yes, sir.\n\n18                   MR. SMITH:   What we did is, we have attached the\n\n19   actual contract at issue.    And there is a venue provision.       It\n\n20   does specify venue in Fannin County, Texas.       And I've given you\n\n21   the law that says in the instance where it involves in excess\n\n22   of -- I think it's one-million dollars -- that's considered a\n\n23   major transaction.    This contract has a specific buyout of\n\n24   five-million dollars.    Therefore, by its very expressed terms,\n\n25   it does involve a major transaction.     Under that circumstance,\n\n\n\n                              Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                 (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                           37\n\n\n\n 1   the venue provision in the contract prevails and is not only\n\n 2   permissive, it is mandatory.      I don't think there's any doubt\n\n 3   that this Court has venue and should not transfer venue.\n\n 4                    And just as an aside, the case filed here in\n\n 5   Fannin County was the first filed case.         The case in Tarrant\n\n 6   County was filed second.      So, I don't have a player in that\n\n 7   suit.    I have not participated in those proceedings, but I do\n\n 8   know this is the earlier-filed suit.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:     You have a response, Ms. Lee?\n\n10                    MS. LEE:   I would like to point out that when\n\n11   John Skotnik -- who is the municipal court judge -- when he was\n\n12   the attorney for the defendants, that's when the argument was\n\n13   that there would be a great prejudice in this county, Your\n\n14   Honor.    We did not amend that motion.     But I would just like to\n\n15   reiterate one more time that the law is very clear, it provides\n\n16   that a major transaction is if a person is obligated to pay or\n\n17   entitled to receive consideration in more than one-million\n\n18   dollars.    A buyout provision is not an obligation, it is a\n\n19   buyout.    And that's 15.020.    So, the venue here is not\n\n20   mandatory.   And if you go to -- that's all I want to say, Your\n\n21   Honor.\n\n22                    THE COURT:     Okay.   Does either party have any\n\n23   information about the value of the 21 gold coins filed with\n\n24   anything?\n\n25                    MR. SMITH:     I don't know.    I can represent to\n\n\n\n                             Gale H. Fiasco, CSR\n                                (903) 640-6696\n\f                                                                       38\n\n\n\n 1   the Court that the estates are large estates and I would not be\n\n 2   surprised if there were over a million dollars easily in those\n\n 3   estates that are at issue.\n\n 4                   MS. LEE:    I would disagree, Your Honor.\n\n 5                   THE COURT:   I'm sure there's substantial money\n\n 6   involved.   The question is regarding the actual transaction\n\n 7   that is evidenced by the contract that was signed, not about\n\n 8   the estates, necessarily.    I understand they might be part of\n\n 9   that, but -- I don't see anything that indicates that all of\n\n10   the estates were involved in this contract.\n\n11                   MS. LEE:    They weren't, Your Honor.\n\n12                   THE COURT:   The difficulty is I don't have any\n\n13   information indicating the value of the 21 gold coins.      I mean,\n\n14   depending on what they were.    If they came from a particular\n\n15   shipwreck, they could be worth a million dollars easy.\n\n16                   MR. SMITH:   There's other consideration\n\n17   expressed in the contract.\n\n18                   THE COURT:   Okay.   Well, based on the other\n\n19   information in the case, the Court is going to grant the motion\n\n20   to transfer venue.   I don't like that because I know I can\n\n21   probably resolve this case more quickly than you can get it\n\n22   done over in the neighboring county.    So, personally, I think\n\n23   it would be more efficient here but I think it's appropriate\n\n24   given where the defendants reside and that I don't have any\n\n25   evidence that this is a case that involves more than a million\n\n\n\n                            Gale H.

And have the clerk's office be notified of this and\n\n13   for you all to work with them to get it transferred as\n\n14   expeditiously --\n\n15                     MS.

I would think it would be a court of the same\n\n24   jurisdiction as this one.       I'm assuming they have civil\n\n25   jurisdiction courts, as well as -- I don't think they have that\n\n\n\n                             Gale H.

If\n\n 3   they have a general jurisdiction court -- I don't think that I\n\n 4   make the call.   I think what happens is it's just a category of\n\n 5   courts.    As long as they have civil jurisdiction, it will go\n\n 6   into that court.    It might end up being a general jurisdiction\n\n 7   court if Tarrant County has any of those left.      And it will\n\n 8   otherwise go into one that is strictly civil.      The clerk -- I\n\n 9   would assume -- would assign that randomly.      And then the\n\n10   parties will make their arguments over there if they desire to\n\n11   have those combined and what other court.      That would be for a\n\n12   different court to make that decision, not this court.        All\n\n13   right.    Is there anything else that needs to be addressed?\n\n14                    MS.

Then the other matters\n\n18   will no longer have any setting on the Court's docket and the\n\n19   order has been signed.

Even if it was, again page 3, section 3.26(a) of the FSA is\nclearly permissive, using the word \"may.\" · Section 3 .26(b) follows and states\ncertain potential results if a \"beneficiary\" is determined to have engaged in\ncertain conduct. I ask again, is it your position that the Pentex Foundation\nand/or the GBU Trust are a \"beneficiaries?\"\n\n      Finally, will you be sending the Rule 11 agreement I sent to you\nyesterday?

However, the two (2) cases are separate and\ncannot be comingled. The Fannin County case is against the Estate of Bert Hughes Gibbs\nbecause the only person who could determine the attorney fees is Ken as Independent\nAdministrator of the Estate (the \"Estate\").\n\nBecause the FSA involves the Estate, mediation must occur in Tarrant County. We will set this\nas soon as possible, even though I am on family medical leave act (\"FMLA\"). As I have\npreviously stated, your client will be responsible for its share of the fees associated with the\nADR. As my client believes that the Fannin County lawsuit is a farce, and since you have done\nnothing but assist Howard Kirk Gibbs, Howard Kirk will be invited to participate in this ADR.\nIf you see any issue with approaching ADR in this manner, please let me know as soon as\npossible. You and Howard Kirk can provide me a list of three (3) mediators in Tarrant County,\nand I will let you know Ken's choice. That seems fair. If you prefer a different way to choose the\nmediator, please let me know.\n\nRegarding the discovery requests from Ken to Pentex and GBU Trust: The respective due dates\nof September 10 and 11, 2014, were oversights on my part. I apologize for scheduling the\nproduction during your leave. After much persuasion, under the circumstances, Ken will agree to\nan extension. However, a thirty- (30-) day extension is excessive. Would either Pentex or GBU\nTrust have agreed to a thirty- (30) day extension for my client? Based on developments thus far,\n\fAugust 25, 2014\nPage2\nKen fully anticipates that your clients will object to all discovery requests, provide him with\nnothing, and that a motion to compel will be necessary.\n\nMy client feels that a fifteen- (15-) day extension is more than reasonable, especially since your\nleave is planned for only a little more than a week in early September. Therefore, Ken will\nextend the production deadline for both Pentex and GBU Trust to 5:30p.m., Monday, September\n25, 2014, provided that both Pentex and GBU Trust will agree in a Rule 11 Agreement that the\nhearing September 30, 2014, is to be postponed until after the mediation (or a mutually agreed\nupon date). Ken has no issue with rescheduling the hearings on September 30th as soon as\npossible, as we are sure the docket is filling up in Fannin County. We also have other motions\nthat will be filed very shortly and we would like those to be heard on the same day as well.\n\nUnder the circumstances, Ken's new deadline is very generous. As I am sure you realize, Ken\nhas no reason to trust you and does not, in fact, want to offer you any concessions at all,\nespecially since it was revealed that you agreed to represent Beverly Miller in Tarrant County.\nEven Judge Ferchill was shocked at the disturbing news that you accepted the $50,000 retainer\ndrawn from a GWB Family and Friends Trust bank account. Of course, we have no verification\nthat you did return the money. Under the circumstances, Ken will not provide a longer extension\nthan fifteen (15) days for discovery.\n\nDue to yours and your client's past and very recent actions, Ken has very little faith that your\nclients will participate in good faith in the mediation, so we need to schedule a time for\ndepositions for Joshua Unger, Danny Unger, AI Barcroft, and the mysterious person who signed\nthe engagement letter. When can I schedule the various parties, including AI, for depositions? If\nyou want to continue to state that you do not represent AI, please put that in writing, yet again.\nObviously, having these depositions back to back would be preferable and please have AI\nBarcroft give all the information he has about Pentex Foundation to Danny Unger, since AI has\nalways been the legal representative of Pentex Foundation (or as Beverly Miller has testified that\nPentex Foundation is AI) and Danny Unger needs to give Joshua Unger all the information\nconcerning GBU Trust, as Danny Unger was the initial trustee.\n\nPlease forward me a Rule 11 Agreement to the extension of discovery and postponing the\nSeptember 30th hearing until after the mediation (or call the court and lets agree to a date).\nPlease provide me all the dates in which you are not available in September and October, and I\nwill get the mediation scheduled as soon as possible. I suspect it will take the entire day. If you\nbelieve otherwise, please let me know. Also, please provide me a list of \"complaints\" that your\nclient has about Ken's administration of the Estate, and also provide my office with a settlement\noffer or solutions prior to one (1) week to mediation.\n\n                                                     Very truly yours,\n                                                     LAW OFFICES OF CHRISTY LEE, P.C.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     Christy L.

I have spoken with opposing counsel prior to\n\n16   the hearing about a procedural issue,            which I believe\n\n17   that must be addressed prior to listening or hearing\n\n18   the motion to reconsider.\n\n19                   THE COURT:       Which is what?\n\n20                   MS.   LEE:     It is -- under the Rule of 87,\n\n21   Section five of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,\n\n22   this Court does not have the power to hear a motion to\n\n23   reconsider on venue,         and I have the law and -- I have\n\n24   case law and statute,        Your Honor,     if you'd like for me\n\n25   to approach.\n\f                                                                              6\n\n\n\n 1                   THE COURT:      Have you already shared that\n\n 2   with Mr.   Smith?\n\n 3                   MS.   LEE:    No,   Your Honor.        I    just found\n\n 4   out about this -- Mr.        Smith about half a day prior --\n\n 5   half a business day prior to this hearing,                  he provided\n\n 6   me with a 41-page reply which cited to section -- to\n\n 7   Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 87.            So,   I       just became\n\n 8   aware of this as -- as of this morning,                Your Honor.\n\n 9   But I do have copies for him,           as well as your court if\n\n10   you\n\n11                   THE COURT:      Okay.\n\n12                   MS.   LEE:    If I may have permission to\n\n13   proceed.\n\n14                   THE COURT:      Okay.\n\n15                   MS.   LEE:    May I please approach,            Your\n\n16   Honor?\n\n17                   THE COURT:      You may.\n\n18                   MS.   LEE:    The Texas Rule of Civil\n\n19   Procedure 87,   Determination of Motion to Transfer,\n\n20   Section five,   specifically states that if an action\n\n21   has been transferred to a proper venue,                which this\n\n22   Court      it has happened on September 28th -- in\n\n23   response to a motion to transfer,           then no further\n\n24   motions to transfer shall be considered,                unless the\n\n25   motion to transfer is based on two things.                   One is the\n\f                                                                       7\n\n\n 1   grounds that an impartial trial cannot be had under\n\n 2   Rules 257 and 259,      which opposing party has not\n\n 3   asserted,   or on the ground of mandatory venue,       which\n\n 4   opposing party did assert in the first motion -- in\n\n 5   the first response to motion for transfer.         This rule\n\n 6   continues to provide that those two exceptions are\n\n 7   only allowed provided that such a claim was not\n\n 8   available to them at the time.\n\n 9                   And,    Your Honor,   I have a copy of their\n\n10   motion       their response to the motion to transfer\n\n11   venue,   and that is exactly what they argued at the\n\n12   last court hearing was a mandatory -- it was a\n\n13   mandatory venue provision.        Then I have case law,     Your\n\n14   Honor.     There's also Marathon Corporation versus\n\n15   Pitzner,    and I've highlighted --your Honor,      may I\n\n16   approach?\n\n~7                   THE COURT:     Yes.\n\n_s                   MS.    LEE:   It's at very back of this case.\n\n19   It's footnote number six.        It cites Texas Rule of\n\n20   Civil Procedure just as I've cited to you,        Your Honor,\n\n21   and then it also states that a motion to reconsider\n\n22   transfer of venue was not proper under the rules,           and\n\n23   a hearing should not have even been granted.         Then I\n\n24   have other cases,      Your Honor.    I have Van Es versus\n\n25   Frazier,    Dorchester Master Limited Partnership versus\n\f                                                                            8\n\n\n\n 1   Anthony,    In Re Shell.       And they all provide that a tax\n\n 2   court has the authority to make                 I'm sorry.    Tax\n\n 3   Court,   sorry.     Trial court has the authority to make\n\n 4   only one venue determination.\n\n 5                     And even a case,        In Re Medical Carbon\n\n 6   Research,      and that says,     rule -- venue selection and\n\n 7   Rule 87,    Section five of the Texas Rules of Civil\n\n 8   Procedure does not permit consideration of a motion to\n\n 9   transfer venue.         A trial court has the authority to\n\n10   make only one venue determination.              And this talks\n\n11   about,   because any reconsideration of an order denying\n\n12   the motion to transfer would be void,                that even today\n\n13   if it's even heard,        that it would be voided.          And I do\n\n14   have some of these cases available,             Your Honor,       if you\n\n15   would like to see them.\n\n                       THE COURT:\n\n17                     MS.   LEE:     Okay.    May I approach,    Your\n\n18   Honor?\n\n19                     THE COURT:       Yes.    Anything else on this\n\n20   point,   Counsel?\n\n21                     MS.   LEE:     No,   Your Honor.\n\n22                     THE COURT:       All right.     Your response,\n\n23   Mr.   Smith.\n\n24                     MR.   SMITH:     Yes.    It certainly would've\n\n25   been nice to know this beforehand; however,                I am\n\f                                                                             9\n\n\n\n 1   familiar with Rule 87.5,      and you've got to read it\n\n 2   fairly careful because there's two triggers for this\n\n 3   rule to be applied.       The first says,      If venue has been\n\n 4   sustained against a motion to transfer -- that's not\n\n 5   us -- or if an action has been transferred to a proper\n\n 6   county.   That's where we would fall under.              That --\n\n 7   and the reason there's two different ones is because,\n\n 8   until the file is actually transferred,           this rule\n\n 9   doesn't kick 1n.\n\n10                  And this file has not actually been\n\n11   transferred.   That's one of the reasons we got our\n\n12   motion for reconsideration in fairly promptly was so\n\n13   that we could have it intercept the actual act of\n\n14   transferring the file.        And I can see and would hope\n\n15   the Court would make a judicial notice finding that\n\n16   the Court's file appears to still be here in Fannin\n\n17   County,   so it has not actually physically been\n\n18   transferred yet,     so ...\n\n19                  THE COURT:      Okay.       I've got my file.        I\n\n20   think there would always be a copy here,               but I don't\n\n21   see anything indicating the clerk has done any\n\n22   physical transfer of the file.\n\n23                  MR.   SMITH:    So,   if,    in fact,    it has not\n\n24   physically been transferred,         this is still a proper\n\n25   motion.    And the reason for that is obvious.              So we\n\f                                                                            10\n\n\n 1   can correct any errors if there are -- if,              in fact,       we\n\n 2   can convince the Court there was an error made before\n\n 3   we make an effort to make a petition for writ of\n\n 4   mandamus.      So,   we believe the Court does have\n\n 5   jurisdiction and that you can proceed forward with a\n\n 6   motion.\n\n 7                    MS.   LEE:     Your Honor,    I      I would just\n\n 8   like to --\n\n 9                    MR.   SMITH:     I'm sorry.       One other\n\n10   thought.\n\n11                    MS.   LEE:     Sure.\n\n12                    MR.   SMITH:     In the cases that she's given\n\n13   me,   I   just looked through them real quick.           Every one\n\n14   of these are cases where the motion was denied under\n\n15   that first clause.        So,    that -- when the motion's\n\n16   denied and the order is entered,          that does keep you\n\n17   from filing a motion for reconsideration.               And the\n\n18   reason for that is this:          Under the old rules where we\n\n19   didn't have the statute granting mandamus relief for\n\n20   mandatory venue,       you did not have the right to appeal\n\n21   venue decisions,       and so,    once the order's entered\n\n22   denying it,     you can have your right on appeal and have\n\n23   your remedy later.        But when you've got a situation\n\n24   such as we have where a mandamus is available,                 if we\n\n25   can get to the Court and convince you of the error of\n\f                                                                          11\n\n\n 1   your ruling,       if you agree with us,          that saves\n\n 2   everybody time,          money,    and judicial resources.\n\n 3                      THE COURT:        Okay.\n\n 4                      MS.    LEE:     Your Honor,    there is one other\n 5   case.\n\n 6                      THE COURT:        Okay.\n\n 7                      MS.    LEE:     Besides reiterating that the\n\n 8   case that I did provide -- it specifically states that\n\n 9   a motion to reconsider is not appropriate and that\n\n10   you're only entitled to one bite at the apple.\n\n11   There's also another case which asserts to some of his\n\n12   other arguments.           Can I please approach the bench,\n\n13   Your Honor?\n\n14                      THE COURT:        Yes.\n\n15                      MS.    LEE:     This one is In Re Chester,    and\n\n16   there were so many important parts in this,                I did not\n\n17   highlight it.       But it specifically provides that after\n\n18   30 days of hearing the motion -- after an order is\n\n19   signed,     that the Court lacks plenary power to rule on\n\n20   a motion to reconsider.             And it was very clear that\n\n21   after 30 days -- and,             in this case,    it was a matter\n\n22   of,   I   think,   32 days when the Court heard a motion to\n\n23   reconsider concerning a change of venue,                and it was a\n\n24   mandatory provision in the agreement,                and the Court\n\n25   ruled that it did not have authority because of\n\f                                                                          12\n\n\n 1   judicial economy and they wanted to make it quite\n\n 2   quick in order to have it heard in another -- in the\n\n 3   appropriate venue.\n\n 4                     So,   that Court asserts     (sic)    Mr.    Smith's\n\n 5   arguments that if there's an error -- and so,                  the\n\n 6   Court does have the power if there was an error,\n\n 7   which,   of course,      we don't believe there was an error,\n\n 8   within 30 days.         And from the research that I did\n\n 9   and I will state that it was not extensive due to the\n\n'0   time constraints and because I was not made aware of\n\n 1   this until I received the reply from Mr.               Scott    (sic),\n\n 2   which,   again,   was half a business day prior to this\n\n_3   hearing,   that there's no extension to the 30 days.\n\n14   So,   this Court only had 30 days if they felt that\n\n15   there was an error.         So,   it is my client's opinion\n\n16   that the Court does not have the power or the\n\n17   authority to even rule on a motion to reconsider the\n\n18   change of venue.\n\n19                     MR.   SMITH:    Again,   looking at this very\n\n20   quickly,   this Chester case looks like the motion was\n\n21   -- I'm going to strike that because I haven't read it\n\n22   carefully.    I don't want to misrepresent it to the\n\n23   Court.\n\n24                     THE COURT:      Okay.    I have two thoughts on\n\n25   this.    I would have liked to have had the hearing\n\f                                                                              13\n\n\n 1   sooner.     I'm uncertain of why it took the time it did.\n\n 2   I know in the past there's some difficulty of having\n\n 3   the appearance of counsel on certain days,                 so we had\n\n 4   gone through quite amount of pain to make sure we were\n\n 5   accommodating people on that.               I don't know if that\n\n 6   factored into this.\n\n 7                      MR.   SMITH:      I believe it did.        Ms.   Reamy\n\n 8   actually set this hearing,              I think,   when Ms.   Kreider\n\n 9   was out of town,         and Ms.    Lee was not available,          and I\n\n10   accommodated her schedule is what I recall.\n\n11                      MS.   LEE:      I was available within the 30\n\n12   days,    Your Honor,      but he had a trial and he had,             I\n\n13   think,    a CLE.\n\n14                      THE COURT:       So, you're saying he can\n\n15   accommodate your schedule,              but you're not going to\n\n16   accommodate his for purposes of the 30 days?\n\n17                      MS.   LEE:     Oh,   my gosh,   no,   Your Honor.\n\n18   It was set for this day only because he had other --\n\n19   he had other issues.            I mean,    he had pending cases,         as\n\n20   I believe maybe a CLE,            or he had a trial.       I wasn't\n\n21   sure.\n\n22                      THE COURT:       Do you think there's a -- do\n\n23   you think there's a timeframe for correcting the\n\n24   Court's ruling by way of mandamus?                 You think he can't\n\n25   do that after he's filed this motion?\n\f                                                                           14\n\n\n 1                     MS.   LEE:    Absolutely.     He -- he has --\n\n 2   there's that avenue.           He is able to file a mandamus,         I\n\n 3   believe.\n\n 4                     THE COURT:      So,    if it was outside the 30\n\n 5   days and I don't rule on it,             the higher court has the\n\n 6   ability to mandamus me and make me do it,               but you're\n\n 7   saying I don't have the ability to hear the case\n\n 8   myself and correct a mistake.\n\n 9                     MS.   LEE:    No,    Your Honor.     I please stand\n\n10   corrected.       From my understanding from the research I\n\n11   did -- and like I stated,             it was not extensive -- if\n\n12   it's outside the 30 days,             there is not -- there's not\n\n13   a discretion.       That -- that was my understanding.\n\n14   Again,    I   -- I did not do extensive research on that.\n\n15   If you would like to-- I'd just like that for the\n\n16   record.       We can proceed.         I believe that we went on\n\n17   the merits of the case.\n\n18                     THE COURT:      Okay.     Well,    let's -- let's\n\n19   go ahead and have the hearing.              If the higher court\n\n20   wants to do something different,             they have the ability\n\n21   to correct anything that I've made a mistake on,\n\n22   because I think it's important to try to get it done\n\n23   right the first time,          and that's why I granted the --\n\n24   the hearing opportunity on the motion to reconsider.\n\n25   I'm going to overrule the objection to having the\n\f                                                                                15\n\n\n\n 1   hearing based on the fact that this is a -- this is,\n\n 2   in my opinion,       to reconsider if I have missed\n\n 3   something legally that is required.                And,    therefore,      I\n\n 4   want to go ahead and proceed with the reconsideration\n\n 5   of the motion to           of the motion,        itself,    to transfer\n\n 6   the venue.     So,     you may proceed on your request,\n\n 7   Mr.   Smith.\n\n 8                    MR.    SMITH:      Thank you,    Your Honor.        And\n\n 9   for the clarity of the record for what we just\n\n10   discussed,     is it the Court's finding that there has\n\n11   not been a physical transfer of the file?\n\n12                    THE COURT:         Yes.\n\n13                    MR.    SMITH:      Thank you.     And I appreciate\n\n14   you having a hearing on this,              Your Honor.     After the\n\n15   last hearing,      clearly, we disagreed with the Court's\n\n16   ruling on venue.        That's what courts are for.             We\n\n17   understand that.        But we looked at our remedies and we\n\n18   saw that there is a statute that allows mandamus on a\n\n19   mandatory venue ruling.          And so,      before we went to\n\n20   that effort, we thought it would be prudent to come\n\n21   back to the Court and see if we could re-examine the\n\n22   ruling to see if,        in fact,    we are correct.\n\n23                    Now,    what is this?        This is not a new\n\n24   motion.    We could not even bring another motion for\n\n25   venue.    Venue,     as you know,      is determined as a matter\n\f                                                                       16\n\n\n\n 1   of primary       it's a primary determination.     You\n\n 2   determine venue before you move on to other things,\n\n 3   and,   because of that,    the hearing that we had on\n\n 4   September 30th was a fixed date for evidence.        And I\n\n 5   say this because the response which was filed by the\n\n 6   defendants brought in a bunch of new evidence,       and we,\n\n 7   ln turn,   felt like we had to respond with that with\n\n 8   our reply.    I really don't think that's important\n\n 9   because the facts that we are going to be arguing\n\n10   about were fixed on September 30th.       We're simply\n\n11   asking that you re-examine those facts because I think\n\n12   that's sufficient to make a ruling that we can all\n\n13   live with.\n\n14                  So,   what was the venue evidence that was\n\n15   before the Court?     And I'll take you to Rule 87.3,         and\n\n16   it may actually be ln what Counsel handed out.           I\n\n17   don't know.    But what it says is, All venue facts when\n\n18   properly pleaded shall be taken as true unless\n\n19   specifically denied by the adverse party.        And what\n\n20   did we have when we came here on September 30th?             We\n\n21   had attached the contract to the petition.        It was\n\n22   asserted in the petition that all parties agreed in\n\n23   writing that any dispute would be performable in\n\n24   Fannin County,    Texas.\n\n25                    In the response to the motion for venue,\n\f                                                                          17\n\n\n\n 1   we attached the contract once again and specifically\n\n 2   pleaded paragraph four which references the\n\n 3   liquidated-damages provision of $5 million,               and none\n\n 4   of this was ever denied.           So,    those facts by rule were\n\n 5   taken as true.\n\n 6                   Now,    I've got a case here,         a copy for\n\n 7   Counsel.    What I've done is I've excerpted the\n\n 8   paragraph of the contract at issue.\n\n 9                   THE COURT:        Thank you.\n\n10                   MR.    SMITH:     And then there's a case\n\n11   called Spin Doctor.        That's actually the case name.\n\n12   I'm not making light of the fact that it's called Spin\n\n13   Doctor.    And what it says is,           you look at the face of\n\n14   the document.       You don't look outside the document.\n\n15   You look at the face of the document.                And this is\n\n16   what the statute says,          too.     And,   in Spin Doctor,    the\n\n17   agreement says,       The agreement attached to the motion\n\n18   to transfer venue lists annual sales of over $1\n\n19   million.    Thus,     on its face,       it constitutes prima\n\n20   facie evidence of a major transaction within the\n\n21   statute.\n\n22                   And I ' l l be candid with you,         Your Honor,\n\n23   there's not a whole lot of cases talking about what a\n\n24   major transaction is.           There's very few,      and the ones\n\n25   that do,   mostly just parrot the statute.              But I\n\f                                                                        18\n\n\n 1   thought this was a pretty compelling one,             because it\n\n 2   says you look at the four corners of the document,                and\n\n 3   if it references consideration in excess of a million\n\n 4   dollars,    the inquiry    lS    over.   Your prima facie case\n\n 5   is met.\n\n 6                   Here,    this contract says,     the liquidated\n\n 7   damages,    should you breach,       is $5 million,    and that\n\n 8   says it's in full settlement of all consideration on\n\n 9   the Gibbs'    claims.     Now,    why is that important?     I've\n\n10   got another handout.        I've cited the statute here,          and\n\n11   it says,    basically,    if consideration is at a stated\n\n12   value of excess of one million,           that's a major\n\n13   transaction.\n\n14                   I said, Well,       what is -- what is\n\n15   liquidated damages action doing for us?            So,   I pulled\n\n16   the supreme court case of Flores,           and it says,\n\n17   Liquidated damages refers to an acceptable measure of\n\n18   damages that parties stipulate to in advance that will\n\n19   be assessed in the event of a contract breach.\n\n20   the parties here stipulated to a specified amount --\n\n21   $5 million -- and said this is adequate consideration\n\n22   for this contract in the event of a breach.              Thus,    on\n\n23   its face,    the contract says it's in excess of a\n\n24   million dollars.\n\n25                   I also note that these type of clauses\n\f                                                                           19\n\n\n 1   are favored in the courts.              The supreme court has said\n\n 2   in 2006 that we encourage these type of clauses\n\n 3   because the parties,           by gosh,   they know what they're\n\n 4   doing,    they should be able to give effect to their own\n\n 5   agreements.     And so,        the Texas law encourages\n\n 6   enforcement of these agreements.\n\n 7                   So,     for all these reason,         Your Honor,    we\n\n 8   believe this is a major transaction; we believe that\n\n 9   it's,    on its face,    in excess of a million dollars; we\n\n10   believe the Texas law encourages enforcement of these.\n\n11   We believe that we came at you pretty fast and furious\n\n12   in the last hearing and maybe that wasn't made very\n\n13   clear,    but we feel like you have an opportunity to\n\n14   restore venue to Fannin County,             Texas,    the county\n\n15   where the parties stipulated and agreed venue should\n\n16   be,   and that we can move on down the road with this\n\n17   litigation.     Thank you for your time.\n\n18                   THE COURT:         Thank you.\n\n19                   Counsel.\n\n20                   MS.   LEE:       Yes,   Your Honor.     And I also\n\n21   have some cases,      Your Honor.         The first one -- may I\n\n22   please approach?\n\n23                   THE COURT:         Certainly.    Thank you.\n\n24                   MS.     LEE:     In Re Togs Energy specifically\n\n25   states,    Your Honor -- it states obviously the statute,\n\f                                                                          20\n\n\n 1   the 15 --    the 15.020.        But here's the -- with all due\n\n 2   respect to Mr.    Scott,    I    don't think he understands the\n\n 3   concept of the consideration.           It is very clear that\n\n 4   in the contract,      it has to have a     aggregated stated\n\n 5   value,    and in the agreement in every case,            even the\n\n 6   one that he cites -- the Spin Doctors -- Your Honor,\n\n 7   it stated that it was a million dollars.             There's no\n\n 8   case that says that liquidated damages,            which is a\n\n 9   buy-out provision,       is considered an obligation to pay.\n\n10                   The actual provision for a major\n\n11   transaction is that a person pays,          receives,      or\n\n12   obligated -- obligated -- to pay or receive.                You are\n\n13   not obligated to pay liquidated damages.\n\n14   Consideration with an aggregated stated value,                  and as\n\n15   Mr.   Smith stated,     it has to be in the four corners of\n\n16   the contract.     You actually have to have that amount\n\n17   of money for over a million dollars.             It has to be\n\n18   stated.     It cannot be,       how much could that possibly\n\n19   be.\n\n20                   Also,    ln In Re Togs Energy,      it stated\n\n21   that affidavits or anything else is absolutely\n\n22   irrelevant.     They're not even going to consider it\n\n23   because it does not       -- because it doesn't contain a\n\n24   major transaction in an affidavit.           I   mean,   you only\n\n25   look to what the contract states.\n\f                                                                            21\n\n\n\n 1                      Now,    again,   in the Spin Doctors Golf as\n\n 2   co-counsel -- opposing counsel has already talked\n\n 3   about,    Your Honor,       they quote the agreement as listed\n\n 4   annual sales of over a million dollars,              and the Court\n\n 5   held,    as he said,       the prima facie evidence of a\n\n 6   transaction.        But they leave out extremely important\n\n 7   language.        The Court in Spin Doctors emphasized that\n\n 8   Paymentech,       by contrast to the Texas Association of\n\n 9   School Boards case,          was obligated to pay.      They\n\n10   absolutely had to pay the funds to Spin Doctor as it\n\n11   received data from the credit card sales.               Paymentech\n\n12   did not assume any risk.            No risk.    No liquidated\n\n13   damages.     Nothing.        It was an absolute obligation.\n\n14   The written agreement actually said that the credit\n\n15   card sales was valued at about 5 million.               That was\n\n16   the obligation to pay.\n\n17                      Once again,      our case is very different\n\n18   because Al Barcroft,          when he signed -- drafted and\n\n19   signed the contract for sale,           he assumed a risk,       and\n\n20   the buy-out provision did not create an obligation.\n\n21   Now,    Candy,    Ken,    and Howard Kirk,     they didn't have to\n\n22   buy him out.        I mean,    again,   it's a buy-out provision,\n\n23   so he may never have received anything.               As do we\n\n24   point out on paragraph six of Howard Kirk Gibbs'\n\n25   affidavit in the opposing parties'              reply, Al was\n\f                                                                         22\n\n\n 1   taking a big risk.       That's what he states.         He's\n\n 2   taking a big risk to help us.         So,   again,    a risk with\n\n 3   no obligation that was created for the Gibbs to have\n\n 4   to pay him anything.       They've not cited to any case,\n\n 5   showed any obligation that there's more than $1\n\n 6   million that needs to be paid.\n\n 7                   So,    we need to talk about,        like,    what is\n\n 8   consideration,    because I think that seems to be an\n\n 9   issue here.     Consideration is what -- is the something\n\n 0   that you receive in return and each side promises to\n\n11   pay.   So,   in the contract for sale, Al Barcroft\n\n12   promised to give his silver coins,           21; his services,\n\n13   which included providing legal services; and acquire\n\n14   legal counsel at his own expense.            This was not\n\n15   valued,   Your Honor.     There was no value in the\n\n16   contract.     Those three things were his consideration.\n\n17   That is what has -- those have to be valued.                 And then\n\n18   the 30 percent of absolutely everything that my client\n\n19   -- and I will go through that in a minute.              But the 30\n\n20   percent of everything that Ken,        Candy,    and Howard Kirk\n\n21   were possibly going to get from the Gibbs,             that was\n\n22   their consideration.       And,   again,    Your Honor,      that was\n\n23   not provided for.       There was no value on that one.\n\n24                    So,   on the face of the document,           there is\n\n25   no -- I mean,    I have the Spin Doctors case.               I read it\n\f                                                                            23\n\n\n 1   extensively.    Again,    ln that agreement,         it stated that\n\n 2   the total sales were 5 million.              That was in the\n\n 3   contract.    There is not one case -- and I            can say that\n\n 4   wholeheartedly because I have read every single case\n\n 5   to my knowledge concerning a motion to transfer and\n\n 6   major transaction.       There's not one case concerning a\n\n 7   buy-out provision or liquidated damages that require\n\n 8   an obligation to pay,          and,   therefore,   make it a major\n\n 9   transaction.\n\n10                   Now,    Your Honor,        in the alternative,    if\n\n11   you believe -- if the Court believes that the $5\n\n12   million liquidated damages or the affidavits and the\n\n13   checks and other things that they're alleging to be\n\n14   true -- if you believe that that happens to be a\n\n15   million dollars and,          therefore,    a major transaction,\n\n16   there is       in the alternative,          I'd like to argue that\n\n17   there is an exception to the mandatory venue\n\n18   provision.     That is Section 15.020(d)\n\n19                   MR.    SMITH:     And,   Judge,    this is where I\n\n20   was talking earlier about this is getting outside the\n\n21   scope of our hearing because we're not starting a new\n\n22   hearing.     We're examining the hearing that we had,             and\n\n23   this evidence of brought forward new after the fact.\n\n24   So,   we would object to the presentation.\n\n25                   MS.    LEE:     Your Honor,     this is exactly\n\f                                                                                 24\n\n\n 1   what I    argued in my other hearing.                 Identical.     I've\n\n 2   not changed my argument.\n\n 3                     THE COURT:      I'm going to allow for the\n\n 4   argument.       I won't allow for anything outside of what\n\n 5   had been argued the last time.                    You may proceed.\n\n 6                     MS.    LEE:   So,    the -- that provision\n\n 7   states that a mandatory venue provision does not apply\n\n 8   to an action if the agreement is -- was unconscionable\n\n 9   at the time it was made.              We          our two arguments,\n\n10   which we argued before,          was,       it was grossly one-sided\n\n11   and the unauthorized practice of law.                       And Al Barcroft\n\n12   drafted the contract for sale for his own accord,                        and\n\n13   he's the beneficiary.           He would receive something as a\n\n14   benefit.       The grossly one-sided argument is 21 junk\n\n15   coins which my client has -- which we did discuss at\n\n16   the last hearing            21 junk coins that happen to be of\n\n17   nominal value -- we don't know what the value is,                        Your\n\n18   Honor,    at that time          and,       in exchange,       he would\n\n19   he would receive -- Al Barcroft would receive a whole\n\n20   lieu   (sic)    of things including inheritances from any\n\n21   form that were received by my clients now and in the\n\n22   future.     It's in the contract.                 It's actually in\n\n23   paragraph one.          There's about,        I    think,    seven to nine\n\n24   different things of what he's going to receive in\n\n25   exchange for what he provided.\n\f                                                                        25\n\n\n 1                   So, practicing law without a license is\n\n 2   considered a misdemeanor           a Class-A misdemeanor\n\n 3   and also,    in my opinion,     considered fraud.       The courts\n\n 4   are very clear that you can't draft a contract in\n\n 5   which you're going to be -- draft a contract as a\n\n 6   practicing law without a license and reap a benefit\n\n 7   from it.\n\n 8                   And my clients -- my clients and the\n\n 9   defendant live in Tarrant County.             Everything is in\n\n10   Tarrant County.       Absolutely everything.         There is\n\n11   nothing that is here.          Even the -- and to my-- I'm\n\n12   not quite       well,   the defendants,       I don't even think\n\n13   they live in Fannin County.         And they could.         You can\n\n14   correct me if I'm wrong.         But everybody is in Tarrant\n\n15   County,    and the appropriate venue is Tarrant County.\n\n16                   THE COURT:       All right.     Thank you.\n\n17                   Any final rebuttal?\n\n18                   MR.   SMITH:     Your Honor,    I   really feel\n\n19   like I need to respond to some of that,             but I   feel\n\n20   like it's outside the record for what we're doing\n\n21   today.     I could spend a fair amount of time rebutting\n\n22   what she just said,      all of which was contained in her\n\n23   response that she filed after you transferred the case\n\n24   or after you have entered the order,            because what they\n\n25   actually filed beforehand was four paragraphs in their\n\f                                                                               26\n\n\n 1   original answer,        none of which talk about what she's\n\n 2   talking about.         It talked about being inconvenient.\n\n 3   It didn't talk about unconscionable contracts.\n\n 4                      I really hate to get into that because I\n\n 5   think it's a red herring,           and I    think I ' l l stand by\n\n 6   what I   said;   and,    that is,    you look at the four\n\n 7   corners of this contract,           it's stating an aggregate\n\n 8   value,   and the reason that is,            is to make sure we have\n\n 9   a major transaction,        and it states the venue -- the\n\n10   parties'   agreement to have venue in Fannin County,\n\n11   Texas,   and so,    unless you want to hear a response to\n\n12   that reply         or a reply to that response,             I ' l l lay\n\n13   that with the Court's file.\n\n14                    THE COURT:      Okay.       My focus has been on\n\n15   whether the buy-out provision that the $5 million\n\n16   stated is an obligation or not.               Is there any\n\n17   anything else that you would offer there,               Mr.     Smith,\n\n18   to clarify?      An obligation of the contract.\n\n19                    MR.    SMITH:   Yes.       I mean,   I'm       I may be\n\n20   repeating myself,        but it says that liquidated damages\n\n21   are created by the parties to ascertain the amount of\n\n22   the contract when it's difficult to come up with an\n\n23   amount of the contract.          That's what they did here.\n\n24   The law encourages liquidated damages.                It's stated in\n\n25   black and white on the contract,              so I believe that's\n\f                                                                          27\n\n\n 1   an obligation to pay as stated in the 15.020.\n\n 2                   THE COURT:     Okay.     Okay.    The    I   I\n\n\n\n\n 3   having reconsidered my order,          will make the ruling\n\n 4   that the venue in this case should not be transferred\n\n 5   to Tarrant County.      We need to go ahead and get a\n\n 6   scheduling order in place and pick some dates certain.\n\n 7   There were some motions that were filed and we need to\n\n 8   address that.\n\n 9                   MS.   LEE:   Your Honor,    I will be filing a\n\n10   mandamus.\n\n11                   THE COURT:     I figured I'd get it one way\n\n12   or the other,   so -- both of y'all are very articulate\n\n13   and very good advocates,      and I'm happy to have a\n\n14   higher court review this as we might need to go along\n\n15   our way.\n\n16                   MS.   LEE:   So,   Your Honor,    I respectfully\n\n17   request not to get back on the docket or scheduling so\n\n18   I can get that filed.\n\n19                   THE COURT:     Well,    what I want to do is,           I\n\n20   want to go ahead and pick the dates before y'all walk\n\n21   out,   and then in the event you file it,          which I have\n\n22   no doubt you will -- but when you do,            then it will\n\n23   abate our hearings until they actually take the action\n\n24   that they might need to take.           And they're very,        very\n\n25   quick about these matters,         and I would expect,       then,\n\f                                                                        28\n\n\n 1   whatever we had scheduled that got abated would be\n\n 2   just reinstituted.        So,     I'd like y'all to pick dates\n\n 3   that are reasonable.\n\n 4                     MS.   LEE:     And,   Your Honor,   just for\n\n 5   clarification,     did you          is it your determination\n\n 6   that that buy-out -- the $5 million liquidated damages\n\n 7   is -- makes it a mandatory venue?\n\n 8                     THE COURT:       That was the part that I was\n\n 9   focusing on last time.           When I made the decision to\n\n10   transfer it,      I was -- I have reconsidered that,         but\n\n11   any provision that allows or provides for the matter\n\n12   based on the limited evidence that was presented to\n\n13   the Court -- I'm trying to make the decision based on\n\n14   the contract that was there,            which I   think is all I\n\n15   can make it on.         Not all of the extraneous evidence\n\n16   that everybody is offering after the last ruling,\n\n17   so ...\n\n18                     MR.   SMITH:     I will prepare an appropriate\n\n19   order and circulate it to Counsel.\n\n20                     THE COURT:       Okay,   what I want y'all to\n\n21   do,   then,    is go ahead and pick those dates with the\n\n22   Court's coordinator,           and then when we get the other\n\n23   motion -- so,      if you'll pick them to be reasonable\n\n24   dates that might happen to be outside of about 30 to\n\n25   45 days,      which is probably about how long the Court\n\f                                                                        29\n\n\n 1   will take to make this ruling.\n\n 2                   MR.   SMITH:   Are you asking us to pick a\n\n 3   trial date and move forward or just dates for the\n\n 4   hearings that we had set before?\n\n 5                   THE COURT:     Both.    I   think we need an end\n\n 6   date that the parties can expect.           This matter's been\n\n 7   a bit protracted for a variety of reasons,             the least\n\n 8   of which is not -- it is the fact that it's a\n\n 9   complicated case,     and I understand that.          There's a\n\n10   lot at stake and a lot of emotion.           I   think the\n\n11   parties need to get the thing resolved,            and that is\n\n12   one thing that we can accomplish is getting some\n\n13   closure.\n\n14                   MR.   SMITH:   Well,   Your Honor,      we have\n\n15   discussed -- I know you ordered mediation last time.\n\n16   We've discussed mediation and it hasn't really gotten\n\n17   any traction.     It might be helpful if you order us to\n\n18   mediation.\n\n19                   THE COURT:     Okay.    I would also expect\n\n20   you still select the final hearing date,            the pretrial\n\n21   date.   The Court will order mediation,           and I ' l l\n\n22   appoint Judge Curt Henderson.          He's a retired judge\n\n23   from the 219th District Court.          You can get online and\n\n24   he -- you can electronically set up the date certain\n\n25   that you want to select.       He'll meet down in Collin\n\f                                                                               30\n\n\n 1   County,   so i t ' l l be in between the two locations to\n\n 2   some degree.       And he has the most years service as a\n\n 3   judge in Collin County's history,              so he will be very\n\n 4   knowledgeable.          I think when he took          either when he\n\n 5   took the bar exam or the board certification exam,                    he\n\n 6   got the top score in the State of Texas that year.                        He\n\n 7   should prove to be very informed,              very helpful,       and he\n\n 8   is,   in my opinion,      young.      He is,   I think,     60   or 61.\n\n 9                     MR.    SMITH:     Thank you for finding that,\n\n10   Your Honor.\n\n11                     THE COURT:        That's young.     So,    it's not\n\n12   like he's -- you know,            he's going to be on it and he's\n\n13   up-to-date with technology issues and things of that\n\n14   nature.    So,   all of your communication -- he does a\n\n15   lot electronically,         and he drafts final mediation\n\n16   agreements,      I think.       He's very good about letting us\n\n17   know.\n\n18                     We need to pick a mediation deadline\n\n19   date,   as well.        I'd like the parties to have that\n\n20   accomplished within -- 120 days should give the higher\n\n21   court the time they need to rule.                Do y'all think\n\n22   that's reasonable,        120 days?      Four months out?\n\n23                     MR.    SMITH:     Certainly.\n\n24                     MS.    LEE:     That's fine.\n\n25                     MR.    SMITH:     And I would also like to\n\f                                                                           31\n\n\n 1   state for the record,       Mr.   Howard Kirk Gibbs,        the pro\n\n 2   se defendant,    is here,    as well.       So,   I   think that's\n\n 3   all of the parties.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:        Okay.     So,   I need to make\n\n 5   sure all of the parties have all of this information\n\n 6   before they go.     I want everybody to know.              Nobody\n\n 7   needs to be in the dark.          We need to go ahead and get\n\n 8   some resolution for everyone.             And so,     when you see\n\n 9   the Court's coordinator,          before anybody leaves,\n\n10   they're going to receive those dates.                 It will be the\n\n11   final hearing date.     If it's a jury,           which I'm\n\n12   assuming,    we'll go ahead and put it on the jury trial\n\n13   docket.     We'll have -- pretrial will be aboui a month\n\n14   preceding that.     Pick a timeframe that y'all think is\n\n15   reasonable to accommodate your issues of discovery\n\n16   that you might have,    and we will do everything that we\n\n17   can to give your case the highest priority.\n\n18                   Every case that's set on the civil docket\n\n19   1s likely       they all resolve,          so your case is likely\n\n20   to be the one that goes,          so don't think it's going to\n\n21   get reset.     It will be the one that goes,             so pick a\n\n22   real date,    a meaningful date for you.              Have the\n\n23   mediation about 120 days out,             and include in the order\n\n24   that you submit on the scheduling order a separate\n\n25   document appointing Judge Henderson so we can get that\n\f                                                                   32\n\n\n 1   off to him ASAP,     and he'll know to expect you all to\n\n 2   contact him.   But the way you'll contact him is\n\n 3   directly yourselves electronically on his website.\n\n 4   Ms.   Kreider can give you the information on how to\n\n 5   contact him.\n\n 6                  MR.   SMITH:   May Mr.   Gibbs come back with\n\n 7   us?\n\n 8                  THE COURT:     Absolutely.    All right.   I   do\n\n 9   appreciate y'all's time and patience with the Court.\n\n10   Thank you.\n\n11                  (End of proceedings.)\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\f                                                                        33\n\n\n 1   THE STATE OF TEXAS\n\n 2   COUNTY OF FANNIN\n\n 3        I,   Charla Reamy,       Official Court Reporter in and for\n\n 4   the 336th District Court of Fannin County,              State of\n\n 5   Texas,     do hereby certify that the above and foregoing\n\n 6   contains a true and correct transcription of all\n\n 7   portions of evidence and other proceedings requested\n\n 8   in writing by counsel for the parties to be included\n\n 9   in this volume of the Reporter's Record,              in the\n\n10   above-styled and numbered cause,              all of which occurred\n\n11   in open court or in chambers and were reported by me.\n\n12        I    further certify that this Reporter's Record of\n\n13   the proceedings truly and correctly reflects the\n\n14   exhibits,     if any,     admitted by the respective parties.\n\n15       WITNESS MY OFFICIAL HAND this the 8th day of\n\n16   December , A .
