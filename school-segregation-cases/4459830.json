The Settling Parties additionally request that the\n\nCourt consider and grant, on an expedited basis, their Joint Motion to Dismiss\n\nAppeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction and Request for Expedited\n\nConsideration of Motion (“Motion to Dismiss”).\n\n                               PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\n       Having failed to defeat preliminary approval of the settlement in this 12-\n\nyear-old case, 2 Appellant Charles O. “Chuck” Grigson (“Grigson”) has now filed a\n\nbaseless interlocutory appeal of the district court’s Order of Preliminary Approval.\n\nBootstrapping off that improper appeal, Grigson filed his Motion to Stay, asking\n\nthe Court to prevent the Settling Parties from finally informing the approximately\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Farmers Group, Inc., Fire Underwriters Association, Farmers Underwriters Association,\nFarmers Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance Exchange, Texas Farmers Insurance Company,\nMid-Century Insurance Company of Texas, Mid-Century Insurance Company, Farmers Texas\nCounty Mutual Insurance Company, Truck Insurance Exchange, and Truck Underwriters\nAssociation\n2\n  See the “Background Facts” provided in the Appellees’ Joint Motion to Dismiss Appeal for\nLack of Appellate Jurisdiction and Request for Expedited Consideration of Motion, which are\nincorporated here by reference. Those facts in the Motion to Dismiss and stated here are in the\npersonal knowledge of the undersigned, and so, no affidavit in support is needed. TEX. R. APP.\nP. 10.2.\n\n\n                                             -1-\n\f1.8 million class members about the settlement. In his Motion to Stay, Grigson\n\nmakes several conclusory, incorrect arguments that are all premised on the\n\npropriety or success of his interlocutory appeal. Because, as demonstrated in the\n\nSettling Parties’ Motion to Dismiss, there is no conceivable basis for an\n\ninterlocutory appeal in this case, Grigson’s Motion to Stay must also fail. There is,\n\nin short, no reason to unnecessarily stay class notice, 12 years overdue, for an\n\nimproper appeal over which this Court lacks jurisdiction.\n\n                                        ARGUMENT\n\n I.   Grigson Cannot Appeal the Preliminary Approval Order and Therefore\n      Cannot Obtain a Stay of Class Notice\n\n      Grigson baldly asserts that he is appealing the “order entered on July 6, 2015\n\ncertifying a settlement class action.” Motion to Stay, at 2 ¶ 1 (emphasis added).\n\nThat statement is completely false. The Order from which Grigson purports to\n\nappeal does not, at any point, certify a class. So, it is not surprising that Grigson\n\ndoes not—and cannot—cite any part of the Order of Preliminary Approval\n\n(“Preliminary Approval Order”) to support his claim that it “certified” the\n\nsettlement class action in this case.\n\n      The Preliminary Approval Order, on its face, neither certifies nor refuses to\n\ncertify a class, as demonstrated in the Settling Parties’ Motion to Dismiss (the\n\narguments of which are incorporated here by reference). Instead, the Preliminary\n\nApproval Order expressly recognizes that the settlement classes were certified in\n\n2003, in an order that was subsequently affirmed by the Texas Supreme Court and\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fthis Court. See Motion to Stay, Ex. A: Order of Preliminary Approval (July 6,\n\n2016) at 2, ¶ 2 (explaining that the district court “has previously certified” the\n\nsettlement classes at issue (emphasis added)); see also Farmers Grp., Inc. v. Lubin,\n\n222 S.W.3d 417, 420, 427-28 (Tex. 2007) (upholding authority of Texas Attorney\n\nGeneral to assert class claims under the Insurance Code); Lubin v. Farmers Grp.,\n\nInc., No. 03-03-00374-CV, 2009 WL 3682602, at *26-32 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\nNov. 6, 2009, no pet.) (considering and rejecting intervenors’ objections to\n\ncertification of the settlement classes in this case).      Those long-ago certified\n\nsettlement classes have remained unchanged for the past 12 years.\n\n      These facts are fatal to the Motion to Stay. Texas law is clear that an\n\ninterlocutory appeal is permitted only from an order that “certifies or refuses to\n\ncertify a class in a suit brought under Rule 42.” See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§ 51.014(a)(3).    The order Grigson attempts to appeal didn’t do that. The clear\n\nlack of appellate jurisdiction over Grigson’s attempted appeal also requires denial\n\nof Grigson’s Motion to Stay. With no basis to appeal, Grigson has no basis to stay\n\nthe proceedings in this case, nor is he entitled to block class notice.\n\nII.   Whether the Final Hearing Occurs as Scheduled Has No Bearing on\n      Whether Class Notice Should Be Stayed\n\n      Grigson also argues, without explanation, that due to his “appeal” the final\n\nfairness hearing in this case cannot be held as scheduled, and thus, the issuance of\n\nclass notice “will misinform and confuse the putative class and interfere with [the]\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fCourt’s jurisdiction.” Motion to Stay at 2, ¶ 2. Once again, that is simply not the\n\ncase.\n\n        The final fairness hearing can go forward as scheduled if this Court\n\nconsiders and grants the Settling Parties’ Motion to Dismiss on an expedited basis,\n\nwhich would render Grigson’s Motion to Stay baseless and moot. But, even if the\n\nfinal hearing cannot occur on the currently scheduled date for whatever reason, the\n\nPreliminary Approval Order deals expressly with that possibility, such that a stay is\n\nunnecessary. Under the Preliminary Approval Order, the district court “expressly\n\nretains the power to adjourn” the hearing without any further notice. Motion to\n\nStay, Ex. A: Order of Preliminary Approval (July 6, 2016) at 9, ¶ 15. The Class\n\nNotice that has been approved by the district court and will be sent to absent class\n\nmembers also expressly informs class members that the date of the final fairness\n\nhearing may be moved. In a paragraph clearly labeled “When and where will the\n\nCourt decide whether to approve the Settlement?” the approved class notice\n\nidentifies the currently scheduled date and then states that the “Settlement\n\nHearing . . . may be moved to a different date or time without additional notice”\n\nand advises class members to visit the settlement website or to call a toll-free\n\nphone number to check for any changes to the hearing date. Motion to Stay, Ex.\n\nA: Order of Preliminary Approval (July 6, 2016) at Ex. 1, p.9, ¶ 21. The sending\n\nof Class Notice therefore would neither “misinform” nor “confuse” class members,\n\nas Grigson claims. See Motion to Stay at 2, ¶ 2. To the contrary, the Class Notice\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fis designed, as a required and necessary step of the settlement approval process, to\n\nbenefit absent class members by informing them of the existence and the material\n\nterms of the settlement and by triggering the ability of the members to participate,\n\nbe heard, and make their own decisions about the settlement. 3 And, as is common\n\nin class action cases, they are informed of the currently scheduled date for the final\n\nfairness hearing as well as the fact that the date could change. 4\n\nIII.     Class Notice Will Be Paid by the Defendants-Appellees Farmers Parties\n         and Will Have No Adverse or Irreparable Effect on Class Members\n\n         Grigson’s final argument in support of his Motion to Stay is that, should he\n\nsomehow succeed on the merits of his interlocutory appeal of the Preliminary\n\nApproval Order, sending class notice will be a “waste of policyholder money.”\n\nMotion to Stay at 3, ¶ 3. And yet again, Grigson’s conclusory and unsupported\n\nargument is readily shown to be untrue.\n\n         First, Grigson’s theory that sending notice would be a “waste of\n\npolicyholder money” is premised on the assumption that notice would have to be\n\nre-sent, in the event the Court considers his appeal and the date for the fairness\n\nhearing has to be moved. But, as explained above, the Class Notice already\n\ncontemplates the potential for moving that hearing date, and notifies class\n\n\n\n3\n    See TEX. INS. CODE § 541.266; TEX. R. CIV. P. 42(e)(1)(B).\n4\n  There are many non-appellate reasons why a final hearing would need to be rescheduled after\nthe issuance of class notice (e.g., court conflict, work or personal conflict of an attorney, natural\ndisaster, etc.) but that does not mean that, in each of those situations, the entire class notice is\ndefective and must be re-sent.\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fmembers that it may be moved. Thus, the costs of sending out notice would not be\n\nwasted in this case, even if the date of the fairness hearing ultimately is moved.\n\n       Second, Grigson’s claim that the costs of notice “will be paid with\n\npolicyholder money” such that sending the notice would somehow injure\n\npolicyholders, see Motion to Stay at 3, ¶ 3, 5 is thoroughly refuted by the\n\nundisputed evidentiary record upon which the district court based its Preliminary\n\nApproval Order. It is undisputed that the costs of notice are being paid by the\n\nFarmers Parties. Grigson’s argument is that the Farmers Exchanges are reciprocal\n\ninsurance exchanges which are “owned” by the policyholders, such that the\n\nExchanges’ surplus funds out of which certain costs will be paid are (he claims)\n\n“policyholder money.” 6         The evidence is clear and undisputed, however, that\n\npolicyholders do not have ownership rights over the surplus of the Exchanges.\n\nInstead—as established through the testimony and declaration of Ron Myhan,\n\nChief Financial Officer of the Farmers Exchanges, both of which are part of the\n\nrecord—policyholders of the Exchanges, like Grigson, do not “possess” the surplus\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Grigson’s reference to this Court’s 2003 stay order (Ex. C to Grigson’s Motion to Stay) is\ninapposite because, as this Court will recall, the appellants at the time were appealing the district\ncourt’s decision to certify the settlement classes, and the primary issue before the Court at that\ntime was whether the Attorney General could bring and certify this class action at all without\nnaming individual class members as representatives. See Lubin v. Farmers Grp., Inc., 222\nS.W.3d 417, 420 (Tex. 2007).\n6\n  Appellees Farmers Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance Exchange, and Truck Insurance\nExchange are the “Farmers Exchanges” or “Exchanges,” which are reciprocal or interinsurance\nexchanges that insure the policies. TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 942.001, et seq.\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\ffunds of the Exchanges. Ex. 1, 7/2/2015 Hearing Tr. 50:7-51:14; Ex. 3 at 27,\n\nFarmers Defs.’ Ex. 11 ¶ 8.7\n\n       Moreover, despite being given ample opportunity in both his briefing and at\n\nthe preliminary approval hearing, Grigson has failed to substantiate his allegation\n\nthat payments by the Exchanges will adversely affect policyholders. Instead, that\n\nunsupported contention is again refuted by evidence in the record. The Exchanges\n\nhave a $5.6 billion surplus. Ex. 1, 7/2/2015 Hearing Tr. 53:13-15. Grigson’s\n\nargument that incurring the cost of approximately $2.5 million to send out class\n\nnotice would somehow negatively impact policyholders is facially absurd. In any\n\nevent, the Settling Parties demonstrated—through the testimony of David Mattax,\n\nthe Texas Commissioner of Insurance; the declarations and testimony of the\n\nExchanges’ CFO, Ron Myhan; and other evidence offered in support of\n\npreliminary approval—that even the Exchanges’ payment of the $84.6 million\n\nsettlement from reserves set aside from their $5.6 billion surplus will have no\n\nmaterial adverse effect on surplus, rates, or the class members who are currently\n\npolicyholders of the Exchanges. See Ex. 2, 7/1/2015 Hearing Tr. 97:7-98:7, 101:1-\n\n104:6; Ex. 1, 7/2/2015 Hearing Tr. 46:9-51:18, 53:13-55:8; Ex. 3, Portion of\n\nExhibits from Preliminary Approval Hearing. If payment of the $84.6 million\n\n\n\n\n7\n  Myhan also testified that, in addition to the Exchanges, Defendant-Appellee Farmers Group,\nInc. will be paying a portion of the class notice costs, just as it will be reimbursing the Exchanges\nfor a portion of the settlement amount. Ex. 1, 7/2/2015 Hearing Tr. 26:15-30:3. Grigson does\nnot contend that money paid by Farmers Group, Inc. is “policyholder money.”\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fsettlement will not materially affect policyholders, then there can be no question\n\nthat the $2.577 million in estimated class notice costs (only 3% of the settlement\n\nvalue, and less than 0.05% of the value of the Exchanges’ surplus) will have no\n\nadverse effect on policyholders either.\n\n      It is instead Grigson’s Motion for Stay—premised on a groundless\n\ninterlocutory appeal and incorrect, conclusory arguments—that will adversely\n\naffect the approximately 1.8 million class members who have effectively been shut\n\nout of the settlement approval process for the past 12 years, receiving neither\n\nnotice that the settlement exists nor the opportunity to participate and be heard. No\n\nmore delay in this 12-year case should be allowed.           Grigson had the full\n\nopportunity to participate at the preliminary approval hearing, and he failed in his\n\nopposition—a failure that is not appealable. The other absent class members are\n\nnow due class notice and entitled to be informed as soon as practicable.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      For all these reasons, the Court should deny Appellant Grigson’s Emergency\n\nMotion to Stay the Sending of Class Notice.

Of course the Exchanges, you know, write the\n\n 2 policies, bill the insureds, and we have -- we receive\n\n 3 the premium payments in cash, and they were put in the\n\n 4 surplus.   So we were thinking, okay, if we have the cash\n\n 5 and if the Department of Insurance thinks we're 12 to\n\n 6 18 percent overcharging and we've settled at 6.8, we\n\n 7 will return part of that 12 to 18 percent in terms of\n\n 8 the 6.8 to the policyholders since we're holding the\n\n 9 money to start with.\n\n10     Q.     And then anything over 6.8 percent that's\n\n11 actually, at least in the view of the State, to be\n\n12 excessive will be retained by the Exchanges; is that\n\n13 correct?\n\n14     A.     Yes, it will.\n\n15     Q.     One of the terms in the 2015 supplement of the\n\n16 settlement agreement is that FGI will reimburse the\n\n17 Exchanges for attorney-in-fact fees that it collected on\n\n18 these returned premiums.\n\n19     A.     Of course.\n\n20     Q.     Are you familiar with that?\n\n21     A.     Yes, I am.\n\n22     Q.     Do you believe that's fair?\n\n23     A.     Of course.\n\n24     Q.     Now, this term is in the 2015 agreement.    My\n\n25 question is, is this something that had been discussed\n\f                                                            27\n\n\n 1 before 2014, 2015?\n\n 2     A.   Yeah, briefly, only because it was assumed from\n\n 3 day one that the management fee would be returned for\n\n 4 these premiums.\n\n 5     Q.   What do you mean by day one?\n\n 6     A.   Right when we were negotiating the settlement\n\n 7 going, okay, this is what it is, I think we were\n\n 8 actually thinking that this would be -- you know, it was\n\n 9 such a process to get to a settlement considering,\n\n10 you know, the environment at that time, we figured this\n\n11 would be paid out pretty quickly and we were making\n\n12 plans, okay, this is how it gets taken out of premium,\n\n13 returned to the policyholders, and at the same time the\n\n14 management fee gets returned, so it was kind of a given\n\n15 that it would be returned.   It wasn't debated at all.\n\n16     Q.   I want to make sure, are we talking about the\n\n17 2002 time period with the original settlement?\n\n18     A.   Yes.\n\n19     Q.   Because we're dealing with such a long period\n\n20 of time, I guess I need to ask you to be as specific as\n\n21 you can with these times.\n\n22     A.   Absolutely.\n\n23     Q.   So there were discussions you're saying between\n\n24 the Exchanges and FGI regarding returning the management\n\n25 fee in connection with the original settlement?\n\f                                                                 28\n\n\n 1     A.      Yes.\n\n 2     Q.      Had any amount been specifically calculated at\n\n 3 that time?\n\n 4     A.      Not the amount, but the understanding was -- it\n\n 5 was just like we do with all the other lines of\n\n 6 business.     I mean, you go back to that.   The line of\n\n 7 business that's affected, get the management fee for\n\n 8 that line of business and cal -- it's generally a math\n\n 9 exercise.     Just calculate the management fee on the\n\n10 settlement amount of premium, and that's the amount that\n\n11 comes back.\n\n12     Q.      Mr. Myhan, with respect to the current\n\n13 settlement, has the amount of attorney-in-fact fees to\n\n14 be reimbursed by FGI on the return premiums been\n\n15 calculated?\n\n16     A.      Yes, it has.\n\n17     Q.      Who would -- who supervised that calculation?\n\n18     A.      That'd be me.\n\n19     Q.      And with respect to that calculation, can you\n\n20 share with us what you determined is the amount of fees\n\n21 to be reimbursed for the return of premiums?\n\n22     A.      Yes.    We've calculated 8.4 million, you know,\n\n23 with the current settlement that's out there.\n\n24     Q.      Okay.    Now, is that a number that includes\n\n25 expenses for class administration as well as a number\n\f                                                            29\n\n\n 1 that includes a portion of the fund that's set out to\n\n 2 fund the credit usage notice class?\n\n 3     A.     Absolutely.   As the supplement was being\n\n 4 discussed with the board, talking in terms of the\n\n 5 extra -- even though the extra 10 million isn't a return\n\n 6 of premium per se and, you know, some of these other\n\n 7 elements aren't returns of premium, the board and the\n\n 8 audit committee as we were discussing it going, well,\n\n 9 this is really -- we're just sharing this with FGI in\n\n10 terms of, okay, put this behind us and, you know, moving\n\n11 on and running a profitable business in Texas, and so,\n\n12 you know, why doesn't -- why shouldn't FGI participate\n\n13 in each element of this?     And we go, yeah, that's a good\n\n14 idea.    And there was no pushback from FGI once I went to\n\n15 them and said, hey, this is what we're thinking, and\n\n16 they go okay.\n\n17                 So, you know -- so basically the\n\n18 $10 million, supplemental payment, thicker notice\n\n19 amount, the administrative costs, all that that were\n\n20 just a part of the management fee to each to kind of\n\n21 give a placeholder in terms of each group participating\n\n22 in the outcome here.     So that gives you the 8.4 million\n\n23 when you get all done with all those components.\n\n24     Q.     Technically class administration does not\n\n25 return a premium, but is there some contribution being\n\f                                                                 30\n\n\n 1 made there?\n\n 2     A.     Yes.   We're just applying the management fee to\n\n 3 each of the amounts even if they're not premium related.\n\n 4     Q.     Can you tell me how you calculated the amount\n\n 5 of management fee to be returned?\n\n 6     A.     Basically, for the homeowners book during these\n\n 7 years, the management fee was -- over this period was\n\n 8 9.17 percent.     And so basically we're applying that\n\n 9 rate, you know, specific to the line of business to,\n\n10 you know, the settlement here.\n\n11     Q.     Mr. Leaman testified in 2003 that the overall\n\n12 management fee for that year was about 11 percent.       Do\n\n13 you recall that testimony?\n\n14     A.     Yes, I do.\n\n15     Q.     And is that accurate in your view?\n\n16     A.     Yes, it is.   We had actually a year or so\n\n17 before this reduced just the homeowners management fee.\n\n18 Really as the Texas mold started to accelerate,\n\n19 you know, FGI wanted to help the Exchanges' capital\n\n20 position somewhat, so we reduced -- they reduced it a\n\n21 bit there.    Plus we have -- you know, I think Stephen\n\n22 Leaman quoted the overall management fee, so we have\n\n23 other books of business that have different management\n\n24 fees.    So, for example, you know, the commercial book\n\n25 requires a lot more management company touching.     It's\n\f                                                                45\n\n\n 1 But the other two really don't have any hard and fast\n\n 2 like leverage ratio type of things, but generally they\n\n 3 would like us to kind of keep the surplus notes about at\n\n 4 the level they're at now.\n\n 5                THE COURT:     So back when you were at the\n\n 6 2 billion to 2.7 billion ratio -- 2 billion of which was\n\n 7 notes right?\n\n 8                THE WITNESS:     Uh-huh.\n\n 9                THE COURT:     Did your notes get downgraded?\n\n10                THE WITNESS:     They -- we were -- yeah, we\n\n11 were in conversations with all three rating agencies at\n\n12 the time, and yeah, we were getting downgrades from all\n\n13 three during 2002, 2003.\n\n14                THE COURT:     Just wanted to make sure I\n\n15 understood this.   Go ahead.\n\n16     Q.   (BY MR. INCERTO)      Mr. Myhan, you mentioned\n\n17 earlier that gross written premium today is about\n\n18 18 billion.\n\n19     A.   Uh-huh.\n\n20     Q.   Is that a good number for 2014?\n\n21     A.   Yes, it is.\n\n22     Q.   How much -- how many billions in claims did the\n\n23 Exchanges pay out in 2014?\n\n24     A.   Well, each year it kind of varies based on\n\n25 what's happening, but if we -- you know, we've been\n\f                                                              46\n\n\n 1 averaging right about 100 combined ratio for the\n\n 2 enterprise over this last few years, and so that would\n\n 3 be 11 to 12 billion of claims paid each year, plus two\n\n 4 to three billion of loss adjustment expense, the claims\n\n 5 adjusters' salaries.    It also includes legal expenses,\n\n 6 things like that.    Probably about 3 billion in agents'\n\n 7 commissions, and then expenses too, but -- you know, so\n\n 8 big numbers.\n\n 9     Q.     How would you characterize the financial\n\n10 strength of the Exchanges today compared to 2002?\n\n11     A.     Oh, we're much, much stronger.\n\n12     Q.     In your opinion as CFO, will payment of the\n\n13 settlement in this case have any material impact on the\n\n14 Exchanges' ability to pay claims?\n\n15     A.     No, absolutely not.\n\n16     Q.     Will it have any material impact on the overall\n\n17 financial strength of the Exchanges?\n\n18     A.     No, it will not.\n\n19     Q.     Will it have any material impact on its\n\n20 ratings?\n\n21     A.     No.   It's too small.\n\n22     Q.     Will it have any material impact -- or will it\n\n23 have any impact in terms of increasing rates for\n\n24 policyholders?\n\n25     A.     Well, as we heard yesterday, you know,\n\f                                                              47\n\n\n 1 obviously it won't from our perspective, but it would be\n\n 2 impossible to actually have that happen since it's based\n\n 3 on -- you know, we file our rates based on the claims\n\n 4 experience and then we try to project what those losses\n\n 5 will be going forward and then come up with a premium\n\n 6 amount that would cover that, and this doesn't affect\n\n 7 losses -- I mean, it doesn't affect premium -- I'm\n\n 8 sorry.   It doesn't affect losses at all.    And even if\n\n 9 you did have a way to do that, this is a regulated\n\n10 industry where it's -- you know, that element would\n\n11 never be allowed by any of the regulators.\n\n12     Q.    When this case arose in 2002 and settlement\n\n13 discussions ensued, did the Exchanges set up a reserve\n\n14 for the costs that they were projecting or estimating\n\n15 going forward?\n\n16     A.    Yeah, at that time we thought this would be\n\n17 settled fairly quickly.   So once a settlement was\n\n18 reached in principle, we went ahead and set up a reserve\n\n19 at that time.\n\n20     Q.    What was the estimated amount of reserve?\n\n21     A.    I believe that was around $73 million,\n\n22 something in that ballpark.\n\n23     Q.    Okay.   My question is -- I want to talk to you\n\n24 about reserves.   Is there a difference between reserves\n\n25 that are set by the Exchanges written in connection with\n\f                                                                     48\n\n\n 1 claims that are filed by policyholders versus reserves\n\n 2 set up on a lawsuit like this?\n\n 3     A.      Oh, very much so.   The reserves set up for\n\n 4 claims, et cetera is kind of just a matter of operations\n\n 5 really.     The claims reps out in the field, you know,\n\n 6 they're busy working every day to pay claims.        It rolls\n\n 7 through our systems, you know, the paids and the\n\n 8 reserves that they're setting up.     And then our\n\n 9 actuaries look at those patterns and try to predict,\n\n10 okay, what are the losses that haven't been reported yet\n\n11 but have been incurred, and it's kind of a math\n\n12 exercise.     It gives us -- and that's the preponderance\n\n13 of our -- I think we have about 8 billion of those types\n\n14 of reserves sitting out there now.\n\n15                  The legal reserves are kind of more of\n\n16 a -- you know, separately more judgment.     For us it's\n\n17 kind of -- you know, we abide by the statutory\n\n18 accounting principles.     That's what the Exchanges are\n\n19 governed by.    So it becomes a discussion, is this\n\n20 probable and measurable in terms of what this is.           And\n\n21 for us it has to be, you know, fairly material.        We\n\n22 don't want to keep track of, you know, a thousand\n\n23 different cases, so we try to say, okay, anything,\n\n24 you know, that's material, say if it's going to hit us\n\n25 for maybe more than five million dollars, let's kind of\n\f                                                               49\n\n\n 1 set up a reserve for that.     And that's -- you know, this\n\n 2 was a -- this was a big one and a high profile one, so,\n\n 3 you know, we went ahead and set up a reserve for this.\n\n 4 Really, you know, my group sets it up by discussing with\n\n 5 the legal department in terms of what we think it's\n\n 6 going to be.\n\n 7     Q.     Are the reserves separate from the surplus?\n\n 8     A.     Yes.   So we set a reserve up and we incur that\n\n 9 expense when we set up the reserve, and it comes out of\n\n10 surplus at that time.     So this -- that initial reserve\n\n11 came out of 2002 or 2003 surplus.     And then when the\n\n12 amendment came along we bumped the reserve up for the\n\n13 amount that it's at now, and it came out of the 2014\n\n14 surplus I guess, just the extra for the 10 million and\n\n15 the other stuff.\n\n16     Q.     So what would be the impact on the surplus?\n\n17 Let's assume with me that this settlement is paid in\n\n18 four months' time.     What would be the impact on the\n\n19 surplus?\n\n20     A.     If it's the amount that's in the amendment\n\n21 right now, there would be no impact to surplus.     It's\n\n22 been fully reserved.\n\n23     Q.     Are the policyholders owners of the Exchanges?\n\n24     A.     In a sense they are.\n\n25     Q.     In what sense?\n\f                                                                   50\n\n\n 1     A.      In a sense where upon liquidation their claims\n\n 2 get paid first and, you know, they would, you know, be\n\n 3 in line there as owners of the Exchanges.        They also\n\n 4 have a voice in electing the board of governors as their\n\n 5 representatives to represent them as policyholders of\n\n 6 the Exchanges.\n\n 7     Q.      Can a policyholder of the Exchanges decide that\n\n 8 they want to possess a portion of the surplus?        Is that\n\n 9 possible?\n\n10     A.      No.     They pay their premiums.   And, you know,\n\n11 so it's a little different if you're -- if you think of\n\n12 ownership you think of like I own stock in a company or\n\n13 something, where if there's a big loss your stock would\n\n14 be worth pennies on the dollar or something.        Well, here\n\n15 you pay your premium and, you know, if we have,\n\n16 you know, a billion-dollar catastrophe, you know, we\n\n17 don't ask you for money back.       It's just, yep, you paid\n\n18 your premium and, you know, but that's the extent of\n\n19 your liability really.\n\n20     Q.      If a subscriber to the Exchanges decides to go\n\n21 purchase insurance from a different company and not from\n\n22 the Exchanges --\n\n23     A.      What?     Oh, okay.\n\n24     Q.      -- can they continue?     Do they have any further\n\n25 rights in the surplus or access to the Exchanges upon\n\f                                                            51\n\n\n 1 termination in their insurance contract?\n\n 2     A.   No.    Once they move on they're no longer\n\n 3 affiliated.    They're no longer a member of the\n\n 4 Exchanges.\n\n 5     Q.   Do they have continued liability to the\n\n 6 Exchanges?\n\n 7     A.   No, they do not.\n\n 8     Q.   With respect to homeowners and auto\n\n 9 policyholders of the Exchanges, do they receive\n\n10 dividends from the surplus?\n\n11     A.   Not for auto and fire, no.\n\n12     Q.   Do they have any rights to borrow against or to\n\n13 somehow take advantage of the increase in surplus?\n\n14     A.   No, they do not.\n\n15     Q.   In your opinion as CFO, does payment of this\n\n16 settlement by the Exchanges affect in any material way\n\n17 the policyholders' interest in the surplus?\n\n18     A.   It will not.\n\n19                 MR. INCERTO:   I'll pass the witness, Your\n\n20 Honor.\n\n21                      CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n22 BY MR. MINDELL:\n\n23     Q.   Mr. Myhan, you mentioned earlier that you lose\n\n24 money in the arbitrage between your reserve notes and\n\n25 your investments on that money.    Why is that?\n\f                                                              52\n\n\n 1     A.   Well, the surplus notes are so deeply\n\n 2 subordinated they go into a bit of a premium.    Now, if\n\n 3 we had to actually go into the markets during 2002,\n\n 4 there would have been a whopping premium or probably\n\n 5 nobody would have bought them at all because of our\n\n 6 financial ratings were under fire at the time.\n\n 7                 But in a stable market like it is now,\n\n 8 we're -- we have a lot of capital.   The rating agencies\n\n 9 have given us good ratings.   So when people look to buy\n\n10 these notes from us now, you know, we'd get a better\n\n11 deal on them.   But it still is going to be more than\n\n12 what we could actually invest those proceeds in.\n\n13                 For example, the Exchanges always have\n\n14 a -- you know, we've always had a very conservative\n\n15 investment philosophy, so our duration generally, which\n\n16 means -- you know, we invest in bonds that are three\n\n17 years in duration roughly, so we don't make any big bets\n\n18 on things going either way, and so these notes are\n\n19 longer duration, so they cost a little more, plus\n\n20 they're subordinated.   So the difference between what we\n\n21 invested in and what we're paying in interest, there's\n\n22 always a difference.\n\n23     Q.   And why are your surplus investments so\n\n24 conservative?\n\n25     A.   You know, generally we keep -- you know, going\n\f                                                               53\n\n\n 1 back to 2002 as an example, you know, that was also a\n\n 2 time during a lot of the turmoil in investment markets.\n\n 3 The tech bubble had just burst.     There was lots of\n\n 4 things going on.     So we're aware of that, so we --\n\n 5 you know, we kind of model our investments in terms of\n\n 6 long horizons in terms of what's possible, good and bad.\n\n 7 And so we -- for that reason we don't make hedging -- we\n\n 8 don't make any big bets on something happening or not.\n\n 9 We kind of hedge our bets and keep a very conservative\n\n10 profile, which got us through 2008 in fine fashion,\n\n11 where a lot of our peers had significant impairments and\n\n12 had some problems.\n\n13     Q.   You mentioned there's approximately 5.6 billion\n\n14 in the surplus now.     Is that across all the Exchanges?\n\n15     A.   Yes, that's all three Exchanges added together.\n\n16     Q.   And why do the Exchanges pool their surplus?\n\n17     A.   Well, the Exchanges all participate in a\n\n18 pooling of interest reinsurance arrangement.     We started\n\n19 that in 1985.   So it allows each of the Exchanges and\n\n20 all of our subsidiaries, by the way, who participate in\n\n21 the pooling agreement to have a mix of business which\n\n22 includes all the Farmers business.     So not to get into\n\n23 any accountant geek stuff here, because I do have some\n\n24 sympathy for my audience, and people would be taking\n\n25 their own lives if I got into detail on this, but --\n\f                                                                  54\n\n\n 1                  THE COURT:     It just diversifies your risk.\n\n 2                  THE WITNESS:     Yes.   We add all the\n\n 3 premiums together at Farmers Exchange and then it gets\n\n 4 ceded out to the pooling participants.        So each of the\n\n 5 Exchanges, no matter what they write on a direct basis,\n\n 6 end up with a mix of business that includes auto and\n\n 7 home and some commercial.       For example, in Texas, if we\n\n 8 didn't have that in place, the companies in Texas would\n\n 9 have long been bankrupt, but they were able to cede all\n\n10 these losses into the pool, and, you know, Farmers\n\n11 Insurance of Ohio picked up some, Farmers Insurance of\n\n12 Washington picked up some, the three Exchanges picked up\n\n13 some.   It diluted it, so we were able to keep them all\n\n14 together.\n\n15                  So it dilutes the risk and also helps us\n\n16 manage the capital, because then you don't have -- like\n\n17 the Texas companies would have been, you know, belly up\n\n18 at that point.    It actually costs us money to move money\n\n19 around in terms of dividends and different things.\n\n20 There's taxes to be paid and things.        So it's a more\n\n21 efficient way of also managing the capital for all the\n\n22 entities.   And you can see it in the rating agencies\n\n23 where they rate the Farmers pool and then give the same\n\n24 rating to all -- you know, they have a big list of all\n\n25 the companies and just go down the list and give them\n\f                                                                  55\n\n\n 1 all the same rating because that's the rating of the\n\n 2 Farmers pool.     Does that make sense to everybody?\n\n 3                  THE COURT:     It probably helps in selling\n\n 4 the notes, too, doesn't it?\n\n 5                  THE WITNESS:     Yes.   Yeah, it makes it\n\n 6 easier and more transparent to figure out what we're\n\n 7 doing.\n\n 8                  THE COURT:     I get it.\n\n 9     Q.     (BY MR. MINDELL)     You testified a lot about the\n\n10 challenges that some of the Exchanges faced in 2002 and\n\n11 2003.    Were the Exchanges ever in any danger of\n\n12 liquidation during that time?\n\n13     A.     We were very close, yes, if this would have\n\n14 kept going.     In our discussions with the California\n\n15 Insurance Department, there was an understanding that if\n\n16 our risk based capital levels -- I'm going to throw out\n\n17 some accounting geek stuff here, but if it fell below\n\n18 250 percent, we could probably count on them denying\n\n19 interest to the bondholders, and that's -- what that is\n\n20 is like they have a minimum level of capital for your\n\n21 liquidated, and we needed two and a half times that at\n\n22 least to stay in business for the surplus notes, and we\n\n23 ended I think 2002 with Farmers Exchange at a\n\n24 251 percent RBC level, and that was after we had\n\n25 initiated a quota share program to take some of the\n\f                                                              136\n\n\n 1                     REPORTER'S CERTIFICATE\n\n 2\n\n 3 THE STATE OF TEXAS    )\n\n 4 COUNTY OF TRAVIS      )\n\n 5                     I, Chavela V.

GODBEY:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n 7     Q.   (BY MR. GODBEY)      Commissioner Mattax, will the\n\n 8 payment of this settlement have any effect on the amount\n\n 9 of premiums the Exchanges can charge in the future?\n\n10     A.   No.\n\n11     Q.   Why not?\n\n12     A.   Premiums are determined on a prospective basis,\n\n13 so anything that this settlement does with respect to\n\n14 payment of claims will not be able to be recouped, if\n\n15 you will, in a future rate increase.\n\n16     Q.   Are the Exchanges now subject to rate\n\n17 regulation in the state of Texas?\n\n18     A.   Yes.\n\n19     Q.   Can you briefly explain what that means?\n\n20     A.   Well, in Texas you have what's called a file\n\n21 and use system, which means you can file your rates and\n\n22 use them, but the commissioner of insurance can\n\n23 disapprove of those rates.     And so the Department of\n\n24 Insurance regularly reviews rates, and if they have\n\n25 issues with them, it lets the companies know.      So the\n\f                                                            98\n\n\n 1 companies can either withdraw their rates or file new\n\n 2 rates that are more in conformance with what the TDI\n\n 3 actuaries think are appropriate.\n\n 4     Q.   Is there any way for a rate regulated entity to\n\n 5 use a settlement payment such as this to increase rates\n\n 6 in the future?\n\n 7     A.   No, that would not be permitted.\n\n 8     Q.   Commissioner Mattax, were you in the courtroom\n\n 9 when Mr. Woods gave his opening statement?\n\n10     A.   For some of it, yes.   I was aware that I was\n\n11 about to testify, so I ran out real quick.\n\n12     Q.   Did you hear Mr. Woods make a claim that one of\n\n13 his concerns with the settlement is that the prospective\n\n14 rate reduction that has already been given by Farmers to\n\n15 policyholders does not also include the return of\n\n16 management fee that has been negotiated in the\n\n17 supplement?\n\n18     A.   Well, if it was a prospective rate reduction,\n\n19 there wouldn't be a management fee collected because the\n\n20 rates wouldn't have been charged, so I don't think I\n\n21 understand the argument.

My name is Ronald Myhan, my date of bitth is March 27, 1954, and my business\n               address is 6301 Owensmouth Ave., Woodland Hills, California, 91367, USA.\n\n          2.   I am the Chief Financial Officer of Farmers Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance\n               Exchange, and Truck Insurance Exchange (collectively, \"the Farmers Exchanges\"). I\n               am not an employee of Farmers Group, Inc. (\"FGr'). In my role with the Farmers\n               Exchanges, I am familiar and interact regularly with the tht·ee Boards of Govetnors of\n               each of the Farmers Exchanges (\"Boards of Governors\"), as well as the Farmers\n               Exchanges Audit Committee (\"Audit Conunittee\").\n\n          3.   None of the Governors on the Boards of Governors and on the Audit Committee are or ·\n               can be current di.t·ectors, officers, agents, employees, or shareholders of FGI, any attOiney-\n               in-fact of a Farmet·s Exchange, or any entities under common ownership with FGI or an\n               attotney- in-fact.\n\n          4.   The Audit Committee is a joint committee created by resolution of the Boards of Governors\n               and, under its Charter, is authorized to t·eview significant legal matters involving the\n               Farmers Exchanges. I am familiar with the Audit Committee's actions taken with regard\n               to the above-captioned matter (\"Texas Litigation\"), including the approval of the\n               settlement entered into by the Farmers Exchanges in the Te~as Litigation.\n\n          5.   The Farmers Exchanges have been advised by the law fmn of Locke Lord LLP (\"Locke\n               Lord\") for over 10 years on insurance-related matters, including Locke Lord's\n               representation of the Farmers Exchanges in the matter of Fogel v. FGI, et al., No.\n               BC300 142, in the Superior Court of the State of California.\n                                                                                    Farmers\n                                                                                   Defendants'\n                                                     1 of3                           Exhibit\n                                                                                       11\n                                                                                No. D-1-GV-Q2-ooz501\n\f                                                                                                       I\n     -   .   ····-·-------------                           ·------------·--·\n\n\n\n\n6.       Advised by Locke Lord, the Audit Committee conducted a review of the Second\n         Amended Settlement Agreement and Stipulation and the 2015 Supplement to the\n         Second Amended Settlement Agreement and Stipulation (\"2015 Supplement\"). The\n         Audit Committee passed a resolution approving the settlement and authorizing me, as the\n         Chief Financial Officer of the Fa1mers Exchanges, to sign the final version of the 2015\n         Supplement if not materially different than what was presented to the Connnittee. A true\n         and correct copy of that resolution is attached hereto as Appendix A. Under that authority,\n         I signed the 2015 Supplement to the Second Amended Settlement Agt-eement and\n         Stipulation on behalf of the Farmers Exchanges.\n\n7.       As the Chief Financial Officer of the Farmers Exchanges, I am familiar with the current\n         finances of the Fanners Exchanges. The current pooled surplus of the Farme1·s Exchanges\n         is approximately $5.6 billion. The sutplus has grown by$ 2.9 billion since 2002 tlu·ough\n         April2015. The surplus has also grown in relation to the amount of premium written. The\n         ratio between premium and surplus has 1isen since 2002, fi·om 26.3% in 2002 to 38.6% in\n         2015.\n\n8.       Policyholders of the Farmers Exchanges do not have the power to persona11y possess or\n         transmit any pottion of the Farmers Exchanges' sutplus. A member of the Farmers\n         Exchanges may not sell his or her policy to another person and does not earn any\n         capital gains resulting from increases in the surplus during the time of ownership. The\n         Farmers Exchanges do not pay out dividends to their homeowner or auto policyhoiders.\n         Sl1ould a policyholder cancel or non-l'enew coverage tluough the Farmers Exchanges,\n         thus ceasing to be an Exchange member, the policyholder is not entitled to take with\n         him or her any portion of the surplus.\n\n9.       Litigation reserves for the settlement in the Texas Litigation were established in 2003\n         and have been updated periodically over the years. These rese1ve amounts are not\n         included in the reported su1plus for the Exchanges. Payment of the settlement amounts\n         will have no matetial impact on the Fru.mers Exchanges' ability to pay future\n         policyholder claims.\n\n10. The Fanners Exchanges' settlement payment in the Texas Litigation will not be\n    factored into future rates and will not result in any changes to the Fanners Exchanges'\n    rates. In simple terms, the Exchanges' rates are based on a forward projection of the\n    premium needed to cover future anticipated losses and expenses. The settlement\n    amounts in this case are largely a return of premiums previously paid to the Farmers\n    Exchanges by policyholders. One-time reimbursement expenses of this nature have no\n    impact on anticipated future cl!lims and are not used in calculating futut·e rates.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2of3\n\fI declare under penalty of petjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\n\n    EXECUTED in Los Angeles County, State of California, on the 29th day of May, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          RONALD MYHAN\n\n\n\n\n                                           3 of3\n\f                                                                                                             /\n\n\n\n\n                    FARMERS EXCHANGES AUDIT COMMITTEE\n                                CERTIFIED COPY OF RESOLUTIONS                                                    t\n\n                                                                                                                 l\n                       WHEREAS, the Committee's Charter specifies that the Conunittee\n                       shall review material litigation of the Exchanges and their                               ~\n                       subsidiaries;\n                       WHEREAS, the Committee has been provided with the                                         r\n                       background and status of The State of Texas, et al v Fanners\n                       Group, Inc., et al, a Texas class action as well as other related\n                       cases and regulatory matters (hereinafter referred to as 'Texas v.\n                       Fanners'), by the General Counsel and by outside counsel;\n                       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Committee\n                       hereby acknowledges rec~eipt of the Second Amended Settletnent\n                       Agreement and S~pulation, the Supplement to the Second\n                       Amended Settlement Agreement and Stipulation (the \"Settlement\")\n                       and other documents relative to Texas v.

and year indicated. A complaint is confirmed if the department receives information indicating\n    that a company committed any violation of an applicable state insurance law or regulation, a federal\nhttps://apps.tdi.state.tx.uslpcci/pcci_show_profile.jsp?tdiNum=27800&compan~ame=FARMERS%201NSURANCE%20EXCHANGE&s}6T}P8Code=CL                                  3/4\n\f6/18/2015                                                      Displaycompanyprofile content\n     requirement the department has authority to enforce or the term or condition of an ins~rance policy or\n     certificate. A complaint is also confirmed if the complaint and company's response, constdered together,\n     suggest that the company was in error or that the complainant had a valid reason for the complaint.\n\n     Complaint Ratios: the ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the number of closed confirmed complaints\n     divided by the number of policies the company had in force for the line of insurance and year indicated.\n\n     Complaint Index: indicates how a company's ratio of the number of complaints to the number of\n     policyholders compares to the average for all insurers. The index is calculated by dividing the\n     company's percentage of complaints for a specific line of insurance by the company's percentage of the\n     policies in force for the same line of insurance. The average index is 1.00. A number less than 1\n     indicates fewer complaints than average; a number greater than 1 indicates more complaints than\n     average. For the most recent completed year, a given insurer's index may change over time, as policy\n     count data is received by TDI. This will affect each insurer's percentage of the total.\n\n     Complaints against an insurance company are not part of the complaint tally above if the insurance\n     company served only as a Third Party Administrator (TPA), a company hired simply to administer the\n     paperwork of a health plan. Instead, they are included in the complaint record of the insurance\n     company or HMO that hired the TPA. If a bonafide self-insured benefit plan hired the TPA, no complaint\n     numbers are recorded as a part of the company/TPA's profile. Neither are profiles available for self-\n     insured plans, as such plans are regulated under federal law.\n\n\n   Company History:\n     Retum to top.\n\n\n       I    Date       II                                                     Event                                                   I\n       1\n        07 _15 _2011 1APPROVED TO WITHDRAW FROM WRillNG TEXAS HOMEOWNER POLICY FORM A (HOA)\n                            IN TEXAS.\n                    APPROVED ACQUISITION OF 21ST CENTURY INSURANCE COMPANY OF THE SOUTHWEST\n                    (95971 lAND AIG ADVANTAGE INSURANCE COMPANY (93987) BY COMPANY, FIRE\n       106-30-20091 INSURANCE EXCHANGE (29750), TRUCK INSURANCE EXCHANGE (84450l AND FARMERS\n                    GROUP, INC., A SUBSIDIARY OF ZURICH FINANCIAL SERVICES LTO.\n                            COMPANY, FIRE INSURANCE EXCHANGE AND TRUCK INSURANCE EXCHANGE, LOS\n\n\n\n       B\n       103-02-20001 ANGELES, CALIFORNIA ACQUIRED FOREMOST COUNTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY,\n                            DALLAS, TEXAS AND FOREMOST LLOYDS OF TEXAS, LEWISVILLE, TEXAS.\n                            PENALTY OF $35,000 PAID BY COMPANY, MID-CENTURY INSURANCE COMPANY, FIRE\n                            INSURANCE EXCHANGE AND TRUCK INSURANCE EXCHANGE FOR VIOLATIONS FOUND\n                            DURING A MARKET CONDUCT EXAMINATION IN ARIZONA.\n       lo6-14-199411ADDED WORKERS' COMPENSATION & EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY INSURANCE.

Confirmed Complaints: the number of confirmed complaints closed against the company for the line of\n    insurance and year indicated. A complaint is confirmed if the department receives information indicating\n    that a company committed any violation of an applicable state insurance law or regulation, a federal\n    requirement the department has authority to enforce or the term or condition of an insurance policy or\n    certificate. A complaint is also confirmed if the complaint and company's response, considered together,\n    suggest that the company was in error or that the complainant had a valid reason for the complaint.\n\n    Complaint Ratios: the ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the number of closed confirmed complaints\n    divided by the number of policies the company had in force for the line of insurance and year indicated.\n\n    Complaint Index: indicates how a company's ratio of the number of complaints to the number of\n    policyholders compares to the average for all insurers. The index is calculated by dividing the\n    company's percentage of complaints for a specific line of insurance by the company's percentage of the\n    policies in force for the same line of insurance. The average index is 1.00. A number less than 1\nhttps://apps.tdi.state.tx.uslpcci/pcci_show_profile.jsp?tdiNunF29750&compan}Name= FIRE%201NSU RANCE%20EXCHAN GE&sy.;T}1J9Code=CL                             314\n\f6/18/2015                                                    Displaycompanyprofile content\n     indicates fewer complaints than average; a number greater than 1 indicates more complaints than\n     average. For the most recent completed year, a given insurer's index may change over time, as policy\n     count data is received by TDI. This will affect each insurer•s percentage of the total.\n\n     complaints against an insurance company are not part of the complaint tally above if the insurance\n     company served only as a Third Party Administrator {TPA), a company hired simply to administer the\n     paperwork of a health plan. Instead, they are included in the complaint record of the insurance\n     company or HMO that hired the TPA. If a bonafide self-insured benefit plan hired the TPA, no complaint\n     numbers are recorded as a part of the company{fPA•s profile. Neither are profiles available for self-\n     insured plans, as such plans are regulated under federal law.\n\n\n   Company History:\n      Return to top.\n\n\n              Date                                                          Event                                            I\n       I               I\n                           APPROVED TO WITHDRAW FROM WRITING TEXAS HOMEOWNER POLICY FORM A (HOA}\n       107-15-20111        IN TEXAS.\n                           APPROVED ACQUISmON OF 21ST CENTURY INSURANCE COMPANY OF THE SOUTHWEST\n                           (95971 lAND AIG ADVANTAGE INSURANCE COMPANY (93987) BY COMPANY, TRUCK\n       106-30-20091        INSURANCE EXCHANGE (84450), FARMERS INSURANCE EXCHANGE C27800l AND FARMERS\n                           GROUP, INC., A SUBSIDIARY OF ZURICH FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD.\n                     PENALTY OF $20,000 FOR VIOLATION OF REQUESTING INSUREDS TO PRODUCE COPIES\n        110-23-20001 OF THEIR INCOME TAX RECORDS IN TEXAS.\n                           COMPANY, FARMERS INSURANCE EXCHANGE AND TRUCK INSURANCE EXCHANGE, LOS\n       103-02-20001\n       B                   ANGELES, CALIFORNIA ACQUIRED FOREMOST COUNTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY,\n                           DALLAS, TEXAS AND FOREMOST LLOYDS OF TEXAS, LEWISVILLE, TEXAS.\n                           PENALTY OF   $35,000 PAID BY COMPANY, FARMERS INSURANCE EXCHANGE, MID-\n                           CENTURY INSURANCE COMPANY AND TRUCK INSURANCE EXCHANGE FOR VIOLATIONS\n                           FOUND DURING A MARKET CONDUCT EXAMINATION IN ARIZONA.\n        jo4-11-195011GRANDFATHERED FOR CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS                                                      I\n    Company Officers:\n      Return to top.\n\n      For names of the company's current officers, please contact the company at the phone number listed in\n      the Contact Information above or on their website.\n\n\n\n\nhttps:l/apps.tdi.state.tx.us/pcci/pcci_show_profile.jsp?tdiNum=:29750&compan}Name=FIRE%201NSURANCE%20EXCHANGE&s)ST~Code=CL       4/4\n\f6/1812015                                                     Display company profile content\n\n\n\n\n   Texas Department of Insurance\n  333 Guadalupe St. P.O.

complaints closed against the company for the line of\n    insurance and year indicated. A complaint is confirmed if the department receives information indicating\n    that a company committed any violation of an applicable state insurance law or regulation, a federal\n    requirement the department has authority to enforce or the term or condition of an insurance policy or\n    certificate. A complaint is also confirmed if the complaint and company's response, considered together,\nhttps://apps.tdi.state.tx.us/pcci/pcci_show_protile.jsp?tdiN um=84450&compan}Name= TRUCK%201NSU RAN CE%20EXCHANGE&s}ST}PeCode=CL                                   3/4\n\f611812015                                                   Display company profile content\n     suggest that the company was in error or that the complainant had a valid reason for the complaint.\n\n     Complaint Ratios: the ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the number of closed confirmed complaints\n     divided by the number of policies the company had in force for the line of insurance and year indicated.\n\n     Complaintlndex: indicates how a company's ratio of the number of complaints to the number of\n     policyholders compares to the average for all insurers. The index is calculated by dividing the\n     company's percentage of complaints for a specific line of insurance by the company's percentage of the\n     policies in force for the same line of insurance. The average index is 1.00. A number Jess than 1\n     indicates fewer complaints than average; a number greater than 1 indicates more complaints than\n     average. For the most recent completed year, a given insurer's index may change over time, as policy\n     count data is received by TDI. This will affect each insurer's percentage of the total.\n\n      Complaints against an insurance company are not part of the complaint tally above if the insurance\n      company served only as a Third Party Administrator (TPA), a company hired simply to administer the\n      paperwork of a health plan. Instead, they are included in the complaint record of the insurance\n      company or HMO that hired the TPA. If a bonafide self-insured benefit plan hired the TPA, no complaint\n      numbers are recorded as a part of the company{fPA's profile. Neither are profiles available for self-\n      insured plans, as such plans are regulated under federal law.\n\n\n    Company History:\n\n\n\n       B\n      Return to top.\n\n\n        I     Date     Jl                                                   Event                                             I\n                            APPROVED ACQUismoN OF 21ST CENTURY INSURANCE coMPANY oF THE souTHWEST\n                            (95971 lAND AIG ADVANTAGE INSURANCE COMPANY C93987l BY COMPANY, FIRE\n                            INSURANCE EXCHANGE (29750), FARMERS INSURANCE EXCHANGE (27800> AND FARMERS\n                            GROUP, INC., A SUBSIDIARY OF ZURICH FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD.\n                     APPROVED TO WITHDRAW FROM WRITING MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LIABILITY\n        112-12-20031 INSURANCE IN TEXAS.

I began my teaching career in 1989 at the University of\n                         Texas, where I held the Joseph D. Jamail Centennial Chair in Law. In 1999, I moved\n                         to Columbia Law School, where I was the Harold R. Medina Professor in Procedural\n                         Jurisprudence. A true and correct copy of my current curriculum vitae is attached to\n                         this declaration.\n\n                      3. I am a 1983 graduate of Yale Law School and a fellow ofthe American Academy of\n                         Arts and Sciences. I also served as the Reporter for the Principles of the Law of\n                         Aggregate Litigation of the American Law Institute. As indicated on my curriculum\n                         vitae, I have researched and reviewed numerous class action decisions and other\n                         authorities and have published a number of articles, chapters, and books on various\n                         topics related to class actions. I also have extensive practical experience with class\n                         actions. In particular, I have drafted, consulted on, and participated in the\n                         administration of many class action settlements throughout the country in both state\n                         and federal courts. I have also served as an expert witness in more than a dozen class\n                         actions in general and settlements in particular.\n\n                      4. I have served as an expert witness on class-related issues for the Farmers defendants in\n                         this matter since 2003, and I testified at the May 2003 preliminary approval hearing. I\n       Farmers\n      Defendants'\n         Exhibit\n           18\n    No.0.1-GV-GZ-oD2501\n\f   am unable to be at the July 1, 2015, hearing on preliminary approval in this matter, as\n   I have a preexisting commitment out of the country during that time. If I were able to\n   present live testimony at the hearing, I would offer the following opinions for the\n   Court's consideration in connection with the decision on preliminary approval of the\n   Second Amended Settlement Agreement, as supplemented (\"Settlement Agreement\").\n\n5. I have reviewed the Fourth Amended Plea in Intervention of Intervenor Charles 0.\n   Grigson, as well as the testimony of Mr. Grigson's expert witness, Charles Silver from\n   the December 4, 2014, hearing in this matter. I understand Mr. Grigson to be\n   challenging the Settlement Agreement because of the issue of how the costs of the\n   settlement are to be borne. As I understand the opposition, Mr. Grigson's view is that\n   it is unfair and improper for defendant Farmers Group, Inc., not to be funding the entire\n   settlement.\n\n6. Any class settlement is ultimately a question of the proper resolution of the case with\n   regard to the claims of the plaintiff class. For example, in Section 3.05 of the ALI\n   Principles of Aggregate Litigation there are four criteria that instruct a supervising\n   court in the approval of a classwide settlement. The four are: (I) the adequacy of the\n   representation of the class; (2) the fairness and reasonableness of the relief obtained in\n   light of the risks and costs of further litigation; (3) the equitable treatment of class\n   members relative to each other; and (4) the absence of collusion in the negotiations.\n   The defendants' respective contributions to the funding of the Settlement Agreement\n   are not mentioned in this account, nor has this been an issue in reported class action\n   decisions with which I am familiar. Instead, the issue is whether the consideration to\n   the class members is fair, adequate, and reasonable in exchange for the release of their\n   existing claims against the defendants.\n\n7. In all my experience with class action settlements, I have not seen a court's settlement\n   approval tum on the inter-defendant distribution of losses. Nor have I seen an objecting\n   class member successfully challenge a class action settlement based on the allocation\n   of settlement funding as between the payors of the settlement. The issue for class\n   members is the exchange they receive for the release of their claims. To the extent\n   there were a dispute over allocation of responsibility among various defendants or their\n   insurers, for example, that would most likely be the subject of a different proceeding at\n   a different time.\n\n8. Allocation among different potential cost-bearers does come up in class action\n   settlements. In class action settlements of securities and shareholder derivative\n   litigation, for example, the settling defendants frequently include the corporation (in\n   which the plaintiff is a shareholder/owner) and officers and directors of the corporation.\n   The allocation itself is not part of the settlement analysis, except insofar as it might\n   indicate that the settlement did not obtain a sufficient amount for the plaintiff class.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f   9. In all of my experience, I have never seen an objecting class member successfully\n      challenge approval of a class action securities or derivative settlement based on these\n      allocation decisions.\n\nI declare under penalty of pe1jury that the foregoing is true and correct.\n\n   EXECUTED in New York County, State ofNew York, on the 28th day ofMay, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Samuel Issacharoff\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f",

The Settling Parties additionally request that the\n\nCourt consider and grant, on an expedited basis, their Joint Motion to Dismiss\n\nAppeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction and Request for Expedited\n\nConsideration of Motion (“Motion to Dismiss”).\n\n                               PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\n       Having failed to defeat preliminary approval of the settlement in this 12-\n\nyear-old case, 2 Appellant Charles O. “Chuck” Grigson (“Grigson”) has now filed a\n\nbaseless interlocutory appeal of the district court’s Order of Preliminary Approval.\n\nBootstrapping off that improper appeal, Grigson filed his Motion to Stay, asking\n\nthe Court to prevent the Settling Parties from finally informing the approximately\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Farmers Group, Inc., Fire Underwriters Association, Farmers Underwriters Association,\nFarmers Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance Exchange, Texas Farmers Insurance Company,\nMid-Century Insurance Company of Texas, Mid-Century Insurance Company, Farmers Texas\nCounty Mutual Insurance Company, Truck Insurance Exchange, and Truck Underwriters\nAssociation\n2\n  See the “Background Facts” provided in the Appellees’ Joint Motion to Dismiss Appeal for\nLack of Appellate Jurisdiction and Request for Expedited Consideration of Motion, which are\nincorporated here by reference. Those facts in the Motion to Dismiss and stated here are in the\npersonal knowledge of the undersigned, and so, no affidavit in support is needed. TEX. R. APP.\nP. 10.2.\n\n\n                                             -1-\n\f1.8 million class members about the settlement. In his Motion to Stay, Grigson\n\nmakes several conclusory, incorrect arguments that are all premised on the\n\npropriety or success of his interlocutory appeal. Because, as demonstrated in the\n\nSettling Parties’ Motion to Dismiss, there is no conceivable basis for an\n\ninterlocutory appeal in this case, Grigson’s Motion to Stay must also fail. There is,\n\nin short, no reason to unnecessarily stay class notice, 12 years overdue, for an\n\nimproper appeal over which this Court lacks jurisdiction.\n\n                                        ARGUMENT\n\n I.   Grigson Cannot Appeal the Preliminary Approval Order and Therefore\n      Cannot Obtain a Stay of Class Notice\n\n      Grigson baldly asserts that he is appealing the “order entered on July 6, 2015\n\ncertifying a settlement class action.” Motion to Stay, at 2 ¶ 1 (emphasis added).\n\nThat statement is completely false. The Order from which Grigson purports to\n\nappeal does not, at any point, certify a class. So, it is not surprising that Grigson\n\ndoes not—and cannot—cite any part of the Order of Preliminary Approval\n\n(“Preliminary Approval Order”) to support his claim that it “certified” the\n\nsettlement class action in this case.\n\n      The Preliminary Approval Order, on its face, neither certifies nor refuses to\n\ncertify a class, as demonstrated in the Settling Parties’ Motion to Dismiss (the\n\narguments of which are incorporated here by reference). Instead, the Preliminary\n\nApproval Order expressly recognizes that the settlement classes were certified in\n\n2003, in an order that was subsequently affirmed by the Texas Supreme Court and\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fthis Court. See Motion to Stay, Ex. A: Order of Preliminary Approval (July 6,\n\n2016) at 2, ¶ 2 (explaining that the district court “has previously certified” the\n\nsettlement classes at issue (emphasis added)); see also Farmers Grp., Inc. v. Lubin,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894855\"><a href=\"/opinion/894855/farmers-group-inc-v-lubin/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 420, 427-28 (Tex. 2007) (upholding authority of Texas Attorney\n\nGeneral to assert class claims under the Insurance Code); Lubin v.

App.—Austin\n\nNov. 6, 2009, no pet.) (considering and rejecting intervenors’ objections to\n\ncertification of the settlement classes in this case).      Those long-ago certified\n\nsettlement classes have remained unchanged for the past 12 years.\n\n      These facts are fatal to the Motion to Stay. Texas law is clear that an\n\ninterlocutory appeal is permitted only from an order that “certifies or refuses to\n\ncertify a class in a suit brought under Rule 42.” See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§ 51.014(a)(3).    The order Grigson attempts to appeal didn’t do that. The clear\n\nlack of appellate jurisdiction over Grigson’s attempted appeal also requires denial\n\nof Grigson’s Motion to Stay. With no basis to appeal, Grigson has no basis to stay\n\nthe proceedings in this case, nor is he entitled to block class notice.\n\nII.   Whether the Final Hearing Occurs as Scheduled Has No Bearing on\n      Whether Class Notice Should Be Stayed\n\n      Grigson also argues, without explanation, that due to his “appeal” the final\n\nfairness hearing in this case cannot be held as scheduled, and thus, the issuance of\n\nclass notice “will misinform and confuse the putative class and interfere with [the]\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fCourt’s jurisdiction.” Motion to Stay at 2, ¶ 2. Once again, that is simply not the\n\ncase.\n\n        The final fairness hearing can go forward as scheduled if this Court\n\nconsiders and grants the Settling Parties’ Motion to Dismiss on an expedited basis,\n\nwhich would render Grigson’s Motion to Stay baseless and moot. But, even if the\n\nfinal hearing cannot occur on the currently scheduled date for whatever reason, the\n\nPreliminary Approval Order deals expressly with that possibility, such that a stay is\n\nunnecessary. Under the Preliminary Approval Order, the district court “expressly\n\nretains the power to adjourn” the hearing without any further notice. Motion to\n\nStay, Ex. A: Order of Preliminary Approval (July 6, 2016) at 9, ¶ 15. The Class\n\nNotice that has been approved by the district court and will be sent to absent class\n\nmembers also expressly informs class members that the date of the final fairness\n\nhearing may be moved. In a paragraph clearly labeled “When and where will the\n\nCourt decide whether to approve the Settlement?” the approved class notice\n\nidentifies the currently scheduled date and then states that the “Settlement\n\nHearing . . . may be moved to a different date or time without additional notice”\n\nand advises class members to visit the settlement website or to call a toll-free\n\nphone number to check for any changes to the hearing date. Motion to Stay, Ex.\n\nA: Order of Preliminary Approval (July 6, 2016) at Ex. 1, p.9, ¶ 21. The sending\n\nof Class Notice therefore would neither “misinform” nor “confuse” class members,\n\nas Grigson claims. See Motion to Stay at 2, ¶ 2. To the contrary, the Class Notice\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fis designed, as a required and necessary step of the settlement approval process, to\n\nbenefit absent class members by informing them of the existence and the material\n\nterms of the settlement and by triggering the ability of the members to participate,\n\nbe heard, and make their own decisions about the settlement. 3 And, as is common\n\nin class action cases, they are informed of the currently scheduled date for the final\n\nfairness hearing as well as the fact that the date could change. 4\n\nIII.     Class Notice Will Be Paid by the Defendants-Appellees Farmers Parties\n         and Will Have No Adverse or Irreparable Effect on Class Members\n\n         Grigson’s final argument in support of his Motion to Stay is that, should he\n\nsomehow succeed on the merits of his interlocutory appeal of the Preliminary\n\nApproval Order, sending class notice will be a “waste of policyholder money.”\n\nMotion to Stay at 3, ¶ 3. And yet again, Grigson’s conclusory and unsupported\n\nargument is readily shown to be untrue.\n\n         First, Grigson’s theory that sending notice would be a “waste of\n\npolicyholder money” is premised on the assumption that notice would have to be\n\nre-sent, in the event the Court considers his appeal and the date for the fairness\n\nhearing has to be moved. But, as explained above, the Class Notice already\n\ncontemplates the potential for moving that hearing date, and notifies class\n\n\n\n3\n    See TEX. INS. CODE § 541.266; TEX. R. CIV. P. 42(e)(1)(B).\n4\n  There are many non-appellate reasons why a final hearing would need to be rescheduled after\nthe issuance of class notice (e.g., court conflict, work or personal conflict of an attorney, natural\ndisaster, etc.) but that does not mean that, in each of those situations, the entire class notice is\ndefective and must be re-sent.\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fmembers that it may be moved. Thus, the costs of sending out notice would not be\n\nwasted in this case, even if the date of the fairness hearing ultimately is moved.\n\n       Second, Grigson’s claim that the costs of notice “will be paid with\n\npolicyholder money” such that sending the notice would somehow injure\n\npolicyholders, see Motion to Stay at 3, ¶ 3, 5 is thoroughly refuted by the\n\nundisputed evidentiary record upon which the district court based its Preliminary\n\nApproval Order. It is undisputed that the costs of notice are being paid by the\n\nFarmers Parties. Grigson’s argument is that the Farmers Exchanges are reciprocal\n\ninsurance exchanges which are “owned” by the policyholders, such that the\n\nExchanges’ surplus funds out of which certain costs will be paid are (he claims)\n\n“policyholder money.” 6         The evidence is clear and undisputed, however, that\n\npolicyholders do not have ownership rights over the surplus of the Exchanges.\n\nInstead—as established through the testimony and declaration of Ron Myhan,\n\nChief Financial Officer of the Farmers Exchanges, both of which are part of the\n\nrecord—policyholders of the Exchanges, like Grigson, do not “possess” the surplus\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Grigson’s reference to this Court’s 2003 stay order (Ex. C to Grigson’s Motion to Stay) is\ninapposite because, as this Court will recall, the appellants at the time were appealing the district\ncourt’s decision to certify the settlement classes, and the primary issue before the Court at that\ntime was whether the Attorney General could bring and certify this class action at all without\nnaming individual class members as representatives.

Instead, that\n\nunsupported contention is again refuted by evidence in the record. The Exchanges\n\nhave a $5.6 billion surplus. Ex. 1, 7/2/2015 Hearing Tr. 53:13-15. Grigson’s\n\nargument that incurring the cost of approximately $2.5 million to send out class\n\nnotice would somehow negatively impact policyholders is facially absurd. In any\n\nevent, the Settling Parties demonstrated—through the testimony of David Mattax,\n\nthe Texas Commissioner of Insurance; the declarations and testimony of the\n\nExchanges’ CFO, Ron Myhan; and other evidence offered in support of\n\npreliminary approval—that even the Exchanges’ payment of the $84.6 million\n\nsettlement from reserves set aside from their $5.6 billion surplus will have no\n\nmaterial adverse effect on surplus, rates, or the class members who are currently\n\npolicyholders of the Exchanges. See Ex. 2, 7/1/2015 Hearing Tr. 97:7-98:7, 101:1-\n\n104:6; Ex. 1, 7/2/2015 Hearing Tr. 46:9-51:18, 53:13-55:8; Ex. 3, Portion of\n\nExhibits from Preliminary Approval Hearing. If payment of the $84.6 million\n\n\n\n\n7\n  Myhan also testified that, in addition to the Exchanges, Defendant-Appellee Farmers Group,\nInc. will be paying a portion of the class notice costs, just as it will be reimbursing the Exchanges\nfor a portion of the settlement amount. Ex. 1, 7/2/2015 Hearing Tr. 26:15-30:3. Grigson does\nnot contend that money paid by Farmers Group, Inc. is “policyholder money.”\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fsettlement will not materially affect policyholders, then there can be no question\n\nthat the $2.577 million in estimated class notice costs (only 3% of the settlement\n\nvalue, and less than 0.05% of the value of the Exchanges’ surplus) will have no\n\nadverse effect on policyholders either.\n\n      It is instead Grigson’s Motion for Stay—premised on a groundless\n\ninterlocutory appeal and incorrect, conclusory arguments—that will adversely\n\naffect the approximately 1.8 million class members who have effectively been shut\n\nout of the settlement approval process for the past 12 years, receiving neither\n\nnotice that the settlement exists nor the opportunity to participate and be heard. No\n\nmore delay in this 12-year case should be allowed.           Grigson had the full\n\nopportunity to participate at the preliminary approval hearing, and he failed in his\n\nopposition—a failure that is not appealable. The other absent class members are\n\nnow due class notice and entitled to be informed as soon as practicable.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      For all these reasons, the Court should deny Appellant Grigson’s Emergency\n\nMotion to Stay the Sending of Class Notice. The Settling Parties request all other\n\nrelief to which they are justly entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fDate: July 20, 2015   Respectfully submitted,\n\n                      /s/ M.

Of course the Exchanges, you know, write the\n\n 2 policies, bill the insureds, and we have -- we receive\n\n 3 the premium payments in cash, and they were put in the\n\n 4 surplus.   So we were thinking, okay, if we have the cash\n\n 5 and if the Department of Insurance thinks we're 12 to\n\n 6 18 percent overcharging and we've settled at 6.8, we\n\n 7 will return part of that 12 to 18 percent in terms of\n\n 8 the 6.8 to the policyholders since we're holding the\n\n 9 money to start with.\n\n10     Q.     And then anything over 6.8 percent that's\n\n11 actually, at least in the view of the State, to be\n\n12 excessive will be retained by the Exchanges; is that\n\n13 correct?\n\n14     A.     Yes, it will.\n\n15     Q.     One of the terms in the 2015 supplement of the\n\n16 settlement agreement is that FGI will reimburse the\n\n17 Exchanges for attorney-in-fact fees that it collected on\n\n18 these returned premiums.\n\n19     A.     Of course.\n\n20     Q.     Are you familiar with that?\n\n21     A.     Yes, I am.\n\n22     Q.     Do you believe that's fair?\n\n23     A.     Of course.\n\n24     Q.     Now, this term is in the 2015 agreement.    My\n\n25 question is, is this something that had been discussed\n\f                                                            27\n\n\n 1 before 2014, 2015?\n\n 2     A.   Yeah, briefly, only because it was assumed from\n\n 3 day one that the management fee would be returned for\n\n 4 these premiums.\n\n 5     Q.   What do you mean by day one?\n\n 6     A.   Right when we were negotiating the settlement\n\n 7 going, okay, this is what it is, I think we were\n\n 8 actually thinking that this would be -- you know, it was\n\n 9 such a process to get to a settlement considering,\n\n10 you know, the environment at that time, we figured this\n\n11 would be paid out pretty quickly and we were making\n\n12 plans, okay, this is how it gets taken out of premium,\n\n13 returned to the policyholders, and at the same time the\n\n14 management fee gets returned, so it was kind of a given\n\n15 that it would be returned.   It wasn't debated at all.\n\n16     Q.   I want to make sure, are we talking about the\n\n17 2002 time period with the original settlement?\n\n18     A.   Yes.\n\n19     Q.   Because we're dealing with such a long period\n\n20 of time, I guess I need to ask you to be as specific as\n\n21 you can with these times.\n\n22     A.   Absolutely.\n\n23     Q.   So there were discussions you're saying between\n\n24 the Exchanges and FGI regarding returning the management\n\n25 fee in connection with the original settlement?\n\f                                                                 28\n\n\n 1     A.      Yes.\n\n 2     Q.      Had any amount been specifically calculated at\n\n 3 that time?\n\n 4     A.      Not the amount, but the understanding was -- it\n\n 5 was just like we do with all the other lines of\n\n 6 business.     I mean, you go back to that.   The line of\n\n 7 business that's affected, get the management fee for\n\n 8 that line of business and cal -- it's generally a math\n\n 9 exercise.     Just calculate the management fee on the\n\n10 settlement amount of premium, and that's the amount that\n\n11 comes back.\n\n12     Q.      Mr. Myhan, with respect to the current\n\n13 settlement, has the amount of attorney-in-fact fees to\n\n14 be reimbursed by FGI on the return premiums been\n\n15 calculated?\n\n16     A.      Yes, it has.\n\n17     Q.      Who would -- who supervised that calculation?\n\n18     A.      That'd be me.\n\n19     Q.      And with respect to that calculation, can you\n\n20 share with us what you determined is the amount of fees\n\n21 to be reimbursed for the return of premiums?\n\n22     A.      Yes.    We've calculated 8.4 million, you know,\n\n23 with the current settlement that's out there.\n\n24     Q.      Okay.    Now, is that a number that includes\n\n25 expenses for class administration as well as a number\n\f                                                            29\n\n\n 1 that includes a portion of the fund that's set out to\n\n 2 fund the credit usage notice class?\n\n 3     A.     Absolutely.   As the supplement was being\n\n 4 discussed with the board, talking in terms of the\n\n 5 extra -- even though the extra 10 million isn't a return\n\n 6 of premium per se and, you know, some of these other\n\n 7 elements aren't returns of premium, the board and the\n\n 8 audit committee as we were discussing it going, well,\n\n 9 this is really -- we're just sharing this with FGI in\n\n10 terms of, okay, put this behind us and, you know, moving\n\n11 on and running a profitable business in Texas, and so,\n\n12 you know, why doesn't -- why shouldn't FGI participate\n\n13 in each element of this?     And we go, yeah, that's a good\n\n14 idea.    And there was no pushback from FGI once I went to\n\n15 them and said, hey, this is what we're thinking, and\n\n16 they go okay.\n\n17                 So, you know -- so basically the\n\n18 $10 million, supplemental payment, thicker notice\n\n19 amount, the administrative costs, all that that were\n\n20 just a part of the management fee to each to kind of\n\n21 give a placeholder in terms of each group participating\n\n22 in the outcome here.     So that gives you the 8.4 million\n\n23 when you get all done with all those components.\n\n24     Q.     Technically class administration does not\n\n25 return a premium, but is there some contribution being\n\f                                                                 30\n\n\n 1 made there?\n\n 2     A.     Yes.   We're just applying the management fee to\n\n 3 each of the amounts even if they're not premium related.\n\n 4     Q.     Can you tell me how you calculated the amount\n\n 5 of management fee to be returned?\n\n 6     A.     Basically, for the homeowners book during these\n\n 7 years, the management fee was -- over this period was\n\n 8 9.17 percent.     And so basically we're applying that\n\n 9 rate, you know, specific to the line of business to,\n\n10 you know, the settlement here.\n\n11     Q.     Mr. Leaman testified in 2003 that the overall\n\n12 management fee for that year was about 11 percent.       Do\n\n13 you recall that testimony?\n\n14     A.     Yes, I do.\n\n15     Q.     And is that accurate in your view?\n\n16     A.     Yes, it is.   We had actually a year or so\n\n17 before this reduced just the homeowners management fee.\n\n18 Really as the Texas mold started to accelerate,\n\n19 you know, FGI wanted to help the Exchanges' capital\n\n20 position somewhat, so we reduced -- they reduced it a\n\n21 bit there.    Plus we have -- you know, I think Stephen\n\n22 Leaman quoted the overall management fee, so we have\n\n23 other books of business that have different management\n\n24 fees.    So, for example, you know, the commercial book\n\n25 requires a lot more management company touching.     It's\n\f                                                                45\n\n\n 1 But the other two really don't have any hard and fast\n\n 2 like leverage ratio type of things, but generally they\n\n 3 would like us to kind of keep the surplus notes about at\n\n 4 the level they're at now.\n\n 5                THE COURT:     So back when you were at the\n\n 6 2 billion to 2.7 billion ratio -- 2 billion of which was\n\n 7 notes right?\n\n 8                THE WITNESS:     Uh-huh.\n\n 9                THE COURT:     Did your notes get downgraded?\n\n10                THE WITNESS:     They -- we were -- yeah, we\n\n11 were in conversations with all three rating agencies at\n\n12 the time, and yeah, we were getting downgrades from all\n\n13 three during 2002, 2003.\n\n14                THE COURT:     Just wanted to make sure I\n\n15 understood this.   Go ahead.\n\n16     Q.   (BY MR. INCERTO)      Mr. Myhan, you mentioned\n\n17 earlier that gross written premium today is about\n\n18 18 billion.\n\n19     A.   Uh-huh.\n\n20     Q.   Is that a good number for 2014?\n\n21     A.   Yes, it is.\n\n22     Q.   How much -- how many billions in claims did the\n\n23 Exchanges pay out in 2014?\n\n24     A.   Well, each year it kind of varies based on\n\n25 what's happening, but if we -- you know, we've been\n\f                                                              46\n\n\n 1 averaging right about 100 combined ratio for the\n\n 2 enterprise over this last few years, and so that would\n\n 3 be 11 to 12 billion of claims paid each year, plus two\n\n 4 to three billion of loss adjustment expense, the claims\n\n 5 adjusters' salaries.    It also includes legal expenses,\n\n 6 things like that.    Probably about 3 billion in agents'\n\n 7 commissions, and then expenses too, but -- you know, so\n\n 8 big numbers.\n\n 9     Q.     How would you characterize the financial\n\n10 strength of the Exchanges today compared to 2002?\n\n11     A.     Oh, we're much, much stronger.\n\n12     Q.     In your opinion as CFO, will payment of the\n\n13 settlement in this case have any material impact on the\n\n14 Exchanges' ability to pay claims?\n\n15     A.     No, absolutely not.\n\n16     Q.     Will it have any material impact on the overall\n\n17 financial strength of the Exchanges?\n\n18     A.     No, it will not.\n\n19     Q.     Will it have any material impact on its\n\n20 ratings?\n\n21     A.     No.   It's too small.\n\n22     Q.     Will it have any material impact -- or will it\n\n23 have any impact in terms of increasing rates for\n\n24 policyholders?\n\n25     A.     Well, as we heard yesterday, you know,\n\f                                                              47\n\n\n 1 obviously it won't from our perspective, but it would be\n\n 2 impossible to actually have that happen since it's based\n\n 3 on -- you know, we file our rates based on the claims\n\n 4 experience and then we try to project what those losses\n\n 5 will be going forward and then come up with a premium\n\n 6 amount that would cover that, and this doesn't affect\n\n 7 losses -- I mean, it doesn't affect premium -- I'm\n\n 8 sorry.   It doesn't affect losses at all.    And even if\n\n 9 you did have a way to do that, this is a regulated\n\n10 industry where it's -- you know, that element would\n\n11 never be allowed by any of the regulators.\n\n12     Q.    When this case arose in 2002 and settlement\n\n13 discussions ensued, did the Exchanges set up a reserve\n\n14 for the costs that they were projecting or estimating\n\n15 going forward?\n\n16     A.    Yeah, at that time we thought this would be\n\n17 settled fairly quickly.   So once a settlement was\n\n18 reached in principle, we went ahead and set up a reserve\n\n19 at that time.\n\n20     Q.    What was the estimated amount of reserve?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span>     <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>    <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> believe that was around $73 million,\n\n22 something in that ballpark.\n\n23     Q.    Okay.   My question is -- I want to talk to you\n\n24 about reserves.   Is there a difference between reserves\n\n25 that are set by the Exchanges written in connection with\n\f                                                                     48\n\n\n 1 claims that are filed by policyholders versus reserves\n\n 2 set up on a lawsuit like this?\n\n 3     A.      Oh, very much so.   The reserves set up for\n\n 4 claims, et cetera is kind of just a matter of operations\n\n 5 really.     The claims reps out in the field, you know,\n\n 6 they're busy working every day to pay claims.        It rolls\n\n 7 through our systems, you know, the paids and the\n\n 8 reserves that they're setting up.     And then our\n\n 9 actuaries look at those patterns and try to predict,\n\n10 okay, what are the losses that haven't been reported yet\n\n11 but have been incurred, and it's kind of a math\n\n12 exercise.     It gives us -- and that's the preponderance\n\n13 of our -- I think we have about 8 billion of those types\n\n14 of reserves sitting out there now.\n\n15                  The legal reserves are kind of more of\n\n16 a -- you know, separately more judgment.     For us it's\n\n17 kind of -- you know, we abide by the statutory\n\n18 accounting principles.     That's what the Exchanges are\n\n19 governed by.    So it becomes a discussion, is this\n\n20 probable and measurable in terms of what this is.           And\n\n21 for us it has to be, you know, fairly material.        We\n\n22 don't want to keep track of, you know, a thousand\n\n23 different cases, so we try to say, okay, anything,\n\n24 you know, that's material, say if it's going to hit us\n\n25 for maybe more than five million dollars, let's kind of\n\f                                                               49\n\n\n 1 set up a reserve for that.     And that's -- you know, this\n\n 2 was a -- this was a big one and a high profile one, so,\n\n 3 you know, we went ahead and set up a reserve for this.\n\n 4 Really, you know, my group sets it up by discussing with\n\n 5 the legal department in terms of what we think it's\n\n 6 going to be.\n\n 7     Q.     Are the reserves separate from the surplus?\n\n 8     A.     Yes.   So we set a reserve up and we incur that\n\n 9 expense when we set up the reserve, and it comes out of\n\n10 surplus at that time.     So this -- that initial reserve\n\n11 came out of 2002 or 2003 surplus.     And then when the\n\n12 amendment came along we bumped the reserve up for the\n\n13 amount that it's at now, and it came out of the 2014\n\n14 surplus I guess, just the extra for the 10 million and\n\n15 the other stuff.\n\n16     Q.     So what would be the impact on the surplus?\n\n17 Let's assume with me that this settlement is paid in\n\n18 four months' time.     What would be the impact on the\n\n19 surplus?\n\n20     A.     If it's the amount that's in the amendment\n\n21 right now, there would be no impact to surplus.     It's\n\n22 been fully reserved.\n\n23     Q.     Are the policyholders owners of the Exchanges?\n\n24     A.     In a sense they are.\n\n25     Q.     In what sense?\n\f                                                                   50\n\n\n 1     A.      In a sense where upon liquidation their claims\n\n 2 get paid first and, you know, they would, you know, be\n\n 3 in line there as owners of the Exchanges.        They also\n\n 4 have a voice in electing the board of governors as their\n\n 5 representatives to represent them as policyholders of\n\n 6 the Exchanges.\n\n 7     Q.      Can a policyholder of the Exchanges decide that\n\n 8 they want to possess a portion of the surplus?        Is that\n\n 9 possible?\n\n10     A.      No.     They pay their premiums.   And, you know,\n\n11 so it's a little different if you're -- if you think of\n\n12 ownership you think of like I own stock in a company or\n\n13 something, where if there's a big loss your stock would\n\n14 be worth pennies on the dollar or something.        Well, here\n\n15 you pay your premium and, you know, if we have,\n\n16 you know, a billion-dollar catastrophe, you know, we\n\n17 don't ask you for money back.       It's just, yep, you paid\n\n18 your premium and, you know, but that's the extent of\n\n19 your liability really.\n\n20     Q.      If a subscriber to the Exchanges decides to go\n\n21 purchase insurance from a different company and not from\n\n22 the Exchanges --\n\n23     A.      What?     Oh, okay.\n\n24     Q.      -- can they continue?     Do they have any further\n\n25 rights in the surplus or access to the Exchanges upon\n\f                                                            51\n\n\n 1 termination in their insurance contract?\n\n 2     A.   No.    Once they move on they're no longer\n\n 3 affiliated.    They're no longer a member of the\n\n 4 Exchanges.\n\n 5     Q.   Do they have continued liability to the\n\n 6 Exchanges?\n\n 7     A.   No, they do not.\n\n 8     Q.   With respect to homeowners and auto\n\n 9 policyholders of the Exchanges, do they receive\n\n10 dividends from the surplus?\n\n11     A.   Not for auto and fire, no.\n\n12     Q.   Do they have any rights to borrow against or to\n\n13 somehow take advantage of the increase in surplus?\n\n14     A.   No, they do not.\n\n15     Q.   In your opinion as CFO, does payment of this\n\n16 settlement by the Exchanges affect in any material way\n\n17 the policyholders' interest in the surplus?\n\n18     A.   It will not.\n\n19                 MR. INCERTO:   I'll pass the witness, Your\n\n20 Honor.\n\n21                      CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n22 BY MR. MINDELL:\n\n23     Q.   Mr. Myhan, you mentioned earlier that you lose\n\n24 money in the arbitrage between your reserve notes and\n\n25 your investments on that money.    Why is that?\n\f                                                              52\n\n\n 1     A.   Well, the surplus notes are so deeply\n\n 2 subordinated they go into a bit of a premium.    Now, if\n\n 3 we had to actually go into the markets during 2002,\n\n 4 there would have been a whopping premium or probably\n\n 5 nobody would have bought them at all because of our\n\n 6 financial ratings were under fire at the time.\n\n 7                 But in a stable market like it is now,\n\n 8 we're -- we have a lot of capital.   The rating agencies\n\n 9 have given us good ratings.   So when people look to buy\n\n10 these notes from us now, you know, we'd get a better\n\n11 deal on them.   But it still is going to be more than\n\n12 what we could actually invest those proceeds in.\n\n13                 For example, the Exchanges always have\n\n14 a -- you know, we've always had a very conservative\n\n15 investment philosophy, so our duration generally, which\n\n16 means -- you know, we invest in bonds that are three\n\n17 years in duration roughly, so we don't make any big bets\n\n18 on things going either way, and so these notes are\n\n19 longer duration, so they cost a little more, plus\n\n20 they're subordinated.   So the difference between what we\n\n21 invested in and what we're paying in interest, there's\n\n22 always a difference.\n\n23     Q.   And why are your surplus investments so\n\n24 conservative?\n\n25     A.   You know, generally we keep -- you know, going\n\f                                                               53\n\n\n 1 back to 2002 as an example, you know, that was also a\n\n 2 time during a lot of the turmoil in investment markets.\n\n 3 The tech bubble had just burst.     There was lots of\n\n 4 things going on.     So we're aware of that, so we --\n\n 5 you know, we kind of model our investments in terms of\n\n 6 long horizons in terms of what's possible, good and bad.\n\n 7 And so we -- for that reason we don't make hedging -- we\n\n 8 don't make any big bets on something happening or not.\n\n 9 We kind of hedge our bets and keep a very conservative\n\n10 profile, which got us through 2008 in fine fashion,\n\n11 where a lot of our peers had significant impairments and\n\n12 had some problems.\n\n13     Q.   You mentioned there's approximately 5.6 billion\n\n14 in the surplus now.     Is that across all the Exchanges?\n\n15     A.   Yes, that's all three Exchanges added together.\n\n16     Q.   And why do the Exchanges pool their surplus?\n\n17     A.   Well, the Exchanges all participate in a\n\n18 pooling of interest reinsurance arrangement.     We started\n\n19 that in 1985.   So it allows each of the Exchanges and\n\n20 all of our subsidiaries, by the way, who participate in\n\n21 the pooling agreement to have a mix of business which\n\n22 includes all the Farmers business.     So not to get into\n\n23 any accountant geek stuff here, because I do have some\n\n24 sympathy for my audience, and people would be taking\n\n25 their own lives if I got into detail on this, but --\n\f                                                                  54\n\n\n 1                  THE COURT:     It just diversifies your risk.\n\n 2                  THE WITNESS:     Yes.   We add all the\n\n 3 premiums together at Farmers Exchange and then it gets\n\n 4 ceded out to the pooling participants.        So each of the\n\n 5 Exchanges, no matter what they write on a direct basis,\n\n 6 end up with a mix of business that includes auto and\n\n 7 home and some commercial.       For example, in Texas, if we\n\n 8 didn't have that in place, the companies in Texas would\n\n 9 have long been bankrupt, but they were able to cede all\n\n10 these losses into the pool, and, you know, Farmers\n\n11 Insurance of Ohio picked up some, Farmers Insurance of\n\n12 Washington picked up some, the three Exchanges picked up\n\n13 some.   It diluted it, so we were able to keep them all\n\n14 together.\n\n15                  So it dilutes the risk and also helps us\n\n16 manage the capital, because then you don't have -- like\n\n17 the Texas companies would have been, you know, belly up\n\n18 at that point.    It actually costs us money to move money\n\n19 around in terms of dividends and different things.\n\n20 There's taxes to be paid and things.        So it's a more\n\n21 efficient way of also managing the capital for all the\n\n22 entities.   And you can see it in the rating agencies\n\n23 where they rate the Farmers pool and then give the same\n\n24 rating to all -- you know, they have a big list of all\n\n25 the companies and just go down the list and give them\n\f                                                                  55\n\n\n 1 all the same rating because that's the rating of the\n\n 2 Farmers pool.     Does that make sense to everybody?\n\n 3                  THE COURT:     It probably helps in selling\n\n 4 the notes, too, doesn't it?\n\n 5                  THE WITNESS:     Yes.   Yeah, it makes it\n\n 6 easier and more transparent to figure out what we're\n\n 7 doing.\n\n 8                  THE COURT:     I get it.\n\n 9     Q.     (BY MR. MINDELL)     You testified a lot about the\n\n10 challenges that some of the Exchanges faced in 2002 and\n\n11 2003.    Were the Exchanges ever in any danger of\n\n12 liquidation during that time?\n\n13     A.     We were very close, yes, if this would have\n\n14 kept going.     In our discussions with the California\n\n15 Insurance Department, there was an understanding that if\n\n16 our risk based capital levels -- I'm going to throw out\n\n17 some accounting geek stuff here, but if it fell below\n\n18 250 percent, we could probably count on them denying\n\n19 interest to the bondholders, and that's -- what that is\n\n20 is like they have a minimum level of capital for your\n\n21 liquidated, and we needed two and a half times that at\n\n22 least to stay in business for the surplus notes, and we\n\n23 ended I think 2002 with Farmers Exchange at a\n\n24 251 percent RBC level, and that was after we had\n\n25 initiated a quota share program to take some of the\n\f                                                              136\n\n\n 1                     REPORTER'S CERTIFICATE\n\n 2\n\n 3 THE STATE OF TEXAS    )\n\n 4 COUNTY OF TRAVIS      )\n\n 5                     I, Chavela V.

GODBEY:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n 7     Q.   (BY MR. GODBEY)      Commissioner Mattax, will the\n\n 8 payment of this settlement have any effect on the amount\n\n 9 of premiums the Exchanges can charge in the future?\n\n10     A.   No.\n\n11     Q.   Why not?\n\n12     A.   Premiums are determined on a prospective basis,\n\n13 so anything that this settlement does with respect to\n\n14 payment of claims will not be able to be recouped, if\n\n15 you will, in a future rate increase.\n\n16     Q.   Are the Exchanges now subject to rate\n\n17 regulation in the state of Texas?\n\n18     A.   Yes.\n\n19     Q.   Can you briefly explain what that means?\n\n20     A.   Well, in Texas you have what's called a file\n\n21 and use system, which means you can file your rates and\n\n22 use them, but the commissioner of insurance can\n\n23 disapprove of those rates.     And so the Department of\n\n24 Insurance regularly reviews rates, and if they have\n\n25 issues with them, it lets the companies know.      So the\n\f                                                            98\n\n\n 1 companies can either withdraw their rates or file new\n\n 2 rates that are more in conformance with what the TDI\n\n 3 actuaries think are appropriate.\n\n 4     Q.   Is there any way for a rate regulated entity to\n\n 5 use a settlement payment such as this to increase rates\n\n 6 in the future?\n\n 7     A.   No, that would not be permitted.\n\n 8     Q.   Commissioner Mattax, were you in the courtroom\n\n 9 when Mr. Woods gave his opening statement?\n\n10     A.   For some of it, yes.   I was aware that I was\n\n11 about to testify, so I ran out real quick.\n\n12     Q.   Did you hear Mr. Woods make a claim that one of\n\n13 his concerns with the settlement is that the prospective\n\n14 rate reduction that has already been given by Farmers to\n\n15 policyholders does not also include the return of\n\n16 management fee that has been negotiated in the\n\n17 supplement?\n\n18     A.   Well, if it was a prospective rate reduction,\n\n19 there wouldn't be a management fee collected because the\n\n20 rates wouldn't have been charged, so I don't think I\n\n21 understand the argument.   You're talking about the\n\n22 prospective rate reduction that's already occurred.\n\n23     Q.   That's correct.\n\n24     A.   Right.\n\n25     Q.   The concern that Mr. Woods seems to have\n\f                                                              301\n\n\n 1                     REPORTER'S CERTIFICATE\n\n 2\n\n 3 THE STATE OF TEXAS    )\n\n 4 COUNTY OF TRAVIS      )\n\n 5                     I, Chavela V.

My name is Ronald Myhan, my date of bitth is March 27, 1954, and my business\n               address is 6301 Owensmouth Ave., Woodland Hills, California, 91367, USA.\n\n          2.   I am the Chief Financial Officer of Farmers Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance\n               Exchange, and Truck Insurance Exchange (collectively, \"the Farmers Exchanges\"). I\n               am not an employee of Farmers Group, Inc. (\"FGr'). In my role with the Farmers\n               Exchanges, I am familiar and interact regularly with the tht·ee Boards of Govetnors of\n               each of the Farmers Exchanges (\"Boards of Governors\"), as well as the Farmers\n               Exchanges Audit Committee (\"Audit Conunittee\").\n\n          3.   None of the Governors on the Boards of Governors and on the Audit Committee are or ·\n               can be current di.t·ectors, officers, agents, employees, or shareholders of FGI, any attOiney-\n               in-fact of a Farmet·s Exchange, or any entities under common ownership with FGI or an\n               attotney- in-fact.\n\n          4.   The Audit Committee is a joint committee created by resolution of the Boards of Governors\n               and, under its Charter, is authorized to t·eview significant legal matters involving the\n               Farmers Exchanges. I am familiar with the Audit Committee's actions taken with regard\n               to the above-captioned matter (\"Texas Litigation\"), including the approval of the\n               settlement entered into by the Farmers Exchanges in the Te~as Litigation.\n\n          5.   The Farmers Exchanges have been advised by the law fmn of Locke Lord LLP (\"Locke\n               Lord\") for over 10 years on insurance-related matters, including Locke Lord's\n               representation of the Farmers Exchanges in the matter of Fogel v. FGI, et al., No.\n               BC300 142, in the Superior Court of the State of California.\n                                                                                    Farmers\n                                                                                   Defendants'\n                                                     1 of3                           Exhibit\n                                                                                       11\n                                                                                No. D-1-GV-Q2-ooz501\n\f                                                                                                       I\n     -   .   ····-·-------------                           ·------------·--·\n\n\n\n\n6.       Advised by Locke Lord, the Audit Committee conducted a review of the Second\n         Amended Settlement Agreement and Stipulation and the 2015 Supplement to the\n         Second Amended Settlement Agreement and Stipulation (\"2015 Supplement\"). The\n         Audit Committee passed a resolution approving the settlement and authorizing me, as the\n         Chief Financial Officer of the Fa1mers Exchanges, to sign the final version of the 2015\n         Supplement if not materially different than what was presented to the Connnittee. A true\n         and correct copy of that resolution is attached hereto as Appendix A. Under that authority,\n         I signed the 2015 Supplement to the Second Amended Settlement Agt-eement and\n         Stipulation on behalf of the Farmers Exchanges.\n\n7.       As the Chief Financial Officer of the Farmers Exchanges, I am familiar with the current\n         finances of the Fanners Exchanges. The current pooled surplus of the Farme1·s Exchanges\n         is approximately $5.6 billion. The sutplus has grown by$ 2.9 billion since 2002 tlu·ough\n         April2015. The surplus has also grown in relation to the amount of premium written. The\n         ratio between premium and surplus has 1isen since 2002, fi·om 26.3% in 2002 to 38.6% in\n         2015.\n\n8.       Policyholders of the Farmers Exchanges do not have the power to persona11y possess or\n         transmit any pottion of the Farmers Exchanges' sutplus. A member of the Farmers\n         Exchanges may not sell his or her policy to another person and does not earn any\n         capital gains resulting from increases in the surplus during the time of ownership. The\n         Farmers Exchanges do not pay out dividends to their homeowner or auto policyhoiders.\n         Sl1ould a policyholder cancel or non-l'enew coverage tluough the Farmers Exchanges,\n         thus ceasing to be an Exchange member, the policyholder is not entitled to take with\n         him or her any portion of the surplus.\n\n9.       Litigation reserves for the settlement in the Texas Litigation were established in 2003\n         and have been updated periodically over the years. These rese1ve amounts are not\n         included in the reported su1plus for the Exchanges. Payment of the settlement amounts\n         will have no matetial impact on the Fru.mers Exchanges' ability to pay future\n         policyholder claims.\n\n10. The Fanners Exchanges' settlement payment in the Texas Litigation will not be\n    factored into future rates and will not result in any changes to the Fanners Exchanges'\n    rates. In simple terms, the Exchanges' rates are based on a forward projection of the\n    premium needed to cover future anticipated losses and expenses. The settlement\n    amounts in this case are largely a return of premiums previously paid to the Farmers\n    Exchanges by policyholders. One-time reimbursement expenses of this nature have no\n    impact on anticipated future cl!lims and are not used in calculating futut·e rates.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2of3\n\fI declare under penalty of petjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\n\n    EXECUTED in Los Angeles County, State of California, on the 29th day of May, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          RONALD MYHAN\n\n\n\n\n                                           3 of3\n\f                                                                                                             /\n\n\n\n\n                    FARMERS EXCHANGES AUDIT COMMITTEE\n                                CERTIFIED COPY OF RESOLUTIONS                                                    t\n\n                                                                                                                 l\n                       WHEREAS, the Committee's Charter specifies that the Conunittee\n                       shall review material litigation of the Exchanges and their                               ~\n                       subsidiaries;\n                       WHEREAS, the Committee has been provided with the                                         r\n                       background and status of The State of Texas, et al v Fanners\n                       Group, Inc., et al, a Texas class action as well as other related\n                       cases and regulatory matters (hereinafter referred to as 'Texas v.\n                       Fanners'), by the General Counsel and by outside counsel;\n                       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Committee\n                       hereby acknowledges rec~eipt of the Second Amended Settletnent\n                       Agreement and S~pulation, the Supplement to the Second\n                       Amended Settlement Agreement and Stipulation (the \"Settlement\")\n                       and other documents relative to Texas v.

and year indicated. A complaint is confirmed if the department receives information indicating\n    that a company committed any violation of an applicable state insurance law or regulation, a federal\nhttps://apps.tdi.state.tx.uslpcci/pcci_show_profile.jsp?tdiNum=27800&compan~ame=FARMERS%201NSURANCE%20EXCHANGE&s}6T}P8Code=CL                                  3/4\n\f6/18/2015                                                      Displaycompanyprofile content\n     requirement the department has authority to enforce or the term or condition of an ins~rance policy or\n     certificate. A complaint is also confirmed if the complaint and company's response, constdered together,\n     suggest that the company was in error or that the complainant had a valid reason for the complaint.\n\n     Complaint Ratios: the ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the number of closed confirmed complaints\n     divided by the number of policies the company had in force for the line of insurance and year indicated.\n\n     Complaint Index: indicates how a company's ratio of the number of complaints to the number of\n     policyholders compares to the average for all insurers. The index is calculated by dividing the\n     company's percentage of complaints for a specific line of insurance by the company's percentage of the\n     policies in force for the same line of insurance. The average index is 1.00. A number less than 1\n     indicates fewer complaints than average; a number greater than 1 indicates more complaints than\n     average. For the most recent completed year, a given insurer's index may change over time, as policy\n     count data is received by TDI. This will affect each insurer's percentage of the total.\n\n     Complaints against an insurance company are not part of the complaint tally above if the insurance\n     company served only as a Third Party Administrator (TPA), a company hired simply to administer the\n     paperwork of a health plan. Instead, they are included in the complaint record of the insurance\n     company or HMO that hired the TPA. If a bonafide self-insured benefit plan hired the TPA, no complaint\n     numbers are recorded as a part of the company/TPA's profile. Neither are profiles available for self-\n     insured plans, as such plans are regulated under federal law.\n\n\n   Company History:\n     Retum to top.\n\n\n       I    Date       II                                                     Event                                                   I\n       1\n        07 _15 _2011 1APPROVED TO WITHDRAW FROM WRillNG TEXAS HOMEOWNER POLICY FORM A (HOA)\n                            IN TEXAS.\n                    APPROVED ACQUISITION OF 21ST CENTURY INSURANCE COMPANY OF THE SOUTHWEST\n                    (95971 lAND AIG ADVANTAGE INSURANCE COMPANY (93987) BY COMPANY, FIRE\n       106-30-20091 INSURANCE EXCHANGE (29750), TRUCK INSURANCE EXCHANGE (84450l AND FARMERS\n                    GROUP, INC., A SUBSIDIARY OF ZURICH FINANCIAL SERVICES LTO.\n                            COMPANY, FIRE INSURANCE EXCHANGE AND TRUCK INSURANCE EXCHANGE, LOS\n\n\n\n       B\n       103-02-20001 ANGELES, CALIFORNIA ACQUIRED FOREMOST COUNTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY,\n                            DALLAS, TEXAS AND FOREMOST LLOYDS OF TEXAS, LEWISVILLE, TEXAS.\n                            PENALTY OF $35,000 PAID BY COMPANY, MID-CENTURY INSURANCE COMPANY, FIRE\n                            INSURANCE EXCHANGE AND TRUCK INSURANCE EXCHANGE FOR VIOLATIONS FOUND\n                            DURING A MARKET CONDUCT EXAMINATION IN ARIZONA.\n       lo6-14-199411ADDED WORKERS' COMPENSATION & EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY INSURANCE.

Confirmed Complaints: the number of confirmed complaints closed against the company for the line of\n    insurance and year indicated. A complaint is confirmed if the department receives information indicating\n    that a company committed any violation of an applicable state insurance law or regulation, a federal\n    requirement the department has authority to enforce or the term or condition of an insurance policy or\n    certificate. A complaint is also confirmed if the complaint and company's response, considered together,\n    suggest that the company was in error or that the complainant had a valid reason for the complaint.\n\n    Complaint Ratios: the ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the number of closed confirmed complaints\n    divided by the number of policies the company had in force for the line of insurance and year indicated.\n\n    Complaint Index: indicates how a company's ratio of the number of complaints to the number of\n    policyholders compares to the average for all insurers. The index is calculated by dividing the\n    company's percentage of complaints for a specific line of insurance by the company's percentage of the\n    policies in force for the same line of insurance. The average index is 1.00. A number less than 1\nhttps://apps.tdi.state.tx.uslpcci/pcci_show_profile.jsp?tdiNunF29750&compan}Name= FIRE%201NSU RANCE%20EXCHAN GE&sy.;T}1J9Code=CL                             314\n\f6/18/2015                                                    Displaycompanyprofile content\n     indicates fewer complaints than average; a number greater than 1 indicates more complaints than\n     average. For the most recent completed year, a given insurer's index may change over time, as policy\n     count data is received by TDI. This will affect each insurer•s percentage of the total.\n\n     complaints against an insurance company are not part of the complaint tally above if the insurance\n     company served only as a Third Party Administrator {TPA), a company hired simply to administer the\n     paperwork of a health plan. Instead, they are included in the complaint record of the insurance\n     company or HMO that hired the TPA. If a bonafide self-insured benefit plan hired the TPA, no complaint\n     numbers are recorded as a part of the company{fPA•s profile. Neither are profiles available for self-\n     insured plans, as such plans are regulated under federal law.\n\n\n   Company History:\n      Return to top.\n\n\n              Date                                                          Event                                            I\n       I               I\n                           APPROVED TO WITHDRAW FROM WRITING TEXAS HOMEOWNER POLICY FORM A (HOA}\n       107-15-20111        IN TEXAS.\n                           APPROVED ACQUISmON OF 21ST CENTURY INSURANCE COMPANY OF THE SOUTHWEST\n                           (95971 lAND AIG ADVANTAGE INSURANCE COMPANY (93987) BY COMPANY, TRUCK\n       106-30-20091        INSURANCE EXCHANGE (84450), FARMERS INSURANCE EXCHANGE C27800l AND FARMERS\n                           GROUP, INC., A SUBSIDIARY OF ZURICH FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD.\n                     PENALTY OF $20,000 FOR VIOLATION OF REQUESTING INSUREDS TO PRODUCE COPIES\n        110-23-20001 OF THEIR INCOME TAX RECORDS IN TEXAS.\n                           COMPANY, FARMERS INSURANCE EXCHANGE AND TRUCK INSURANCE EXCHANGE, LOS\n       103-02-20001\n       B                   ANGELES, CALIFORNIA ACQUIRED FOREMOST COUNTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY,\n                           DALLAS, TEXAS AND FOREMOST LLOYDS OF TEXAS, LEWISVILLE, TEXAS.\n                           PENALTY OF   $35,000 PAID BY COMPANY, FARMERS INSURANCE EXCHANGE, MID-\n                           CENTURY INSURANCE COMPANY AND TRUCK INSURANCE EXCHANGE FOR VIOLATIONS\n                           FOUND DURING A MARKET CONDUCT EXAMINATION IN ARIZONA.\n        jo4-11-195011GRANDFATHERED FOR CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS                                                      I\n    Company Officers:\n      Return to top.\n\n      For names of the company's current officers, please contact the company at the phone number listed in\n      the Contact Information above or on their website.\n\n\n\n\nhttps:l/apps.tdi.state.tx.us/pcci/pcci_show_profile.jsp?tdiNum=:29750&compan}Name=FIRE%201NSURANCE%20EXCHANGE&s)ST~Code=CL       4/4\n\f6/1812015                                                     Display company profile content\n\n\n\n\n   Texas Department of Insurance\n  333 Guadalupe St. P.O.

complaints closed against the company for the line of\n    insurance and year indicated. A complaint is confirmed if the department receives information indicating\n    that a company committed any violation of an applicable state insurance law or regulation, a federal\n    requirement the department has authority to enforce or the term or condition of an insurance policy or\n    certificate. A complaint is also confirmed if the complaint and company's response, considered together,\nhttps://apps.tdi.state.tx.us/pcci/pcci_show_protile.jsp?tdiN um=84450&compan}Name= TRUCK%201NSU RAN CE%20EXCHANGE&s}ST}PeCode=CL                                   3/4\n\f611812015                                                   Display company profile content\n     suggest that the company was in error or that the complainant had a valid reason for the complaint.\n\n     Complaint Ratios: the ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the number of closed confirmed complaints\n     divided by the number of policies the company had in force for the line of insurance and year indicated.\n\n     Complaintlndex: indicates how a company's ratio of the number of complaints to the number of\n     policyholders compares to the average for all insurers. The index is calculated by dividing the\n     company's percentage of complaints for a specific line of insurance by the company's percentage of the\n     policies in force for the same line of insurance. The average index is 1.00. A number Jess than 1\n     indicates fewer complaints than average; a number greater than 1 indicates more complaints than\n     average. For the most recent completed year, a given insurer's index may change over time, as policy\n     count data is received by TDI. This will affect each insurer's percentage of the total.\n\n      Complaints against an insurance company are not part of the complaint tally above if the insurance\n      company served only as a Third Party Administrator (TPA), a company hired simply to administer the\n      paperwork of a health plan. Instead, they are included in the complaint record of the insurance\n      company or HMO that hired the TPA. If a bonafide self-insured benefit plan hired the TPA, no complaint\n      numbers are recorded as a part of the company{fPA's profile. Neither are profiles available for self-\n      insured plans, as such plans are regulated under federal law.\n\n\n    Company History:\n\n\n\n       B\n      Return to top.\n\n\n        I     Date     Jl                                                   Event                                             I\n                            APPROVED ACQUismoN OF 21ST CENTURY INSURANCE coMPANY oF THE souTHWEST\n                            (95971 lAND AIG ADVANTAGE INSURANCE COMPANY C93987l BY COMPANY, FIRE\n                            INSURANCE EXCHANGE (29750), FARMERS INSURANCE EXCHANGE (27800> AND FARMERS\n                            GROUP, INC., A SUBSIDIARY OF ZURICH FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD.\n                     APPROVED TO WITHDRAW FROM WRITING MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LIABILITY\n        112-12-20031 INSURANCE IN TEXAS.

I began my teaching career in 1989 at the University of\n                         Texas, where I held the Joseph D. Jamail Centennial Chair in Law. In 1999, I moved\n                         to Columbia Law School, where I was the Harold R. Medina Professor in Procedural\n                         Jurisprudence. A true and correct copy of my current curriculum vitae is attached to\n                         this declaration.\n\n                      3. I am a 1983 graduate of Yale Law School and a fellow ofthe American Academy of\n                         Arts and Sciences. I also served as the Reporter for the Principles of the Law of\n                         Aggregate Litigation of the American Law Institute. As indicated on my curriculum\n                         vitae, I have researched and reviewed numerous class action decisions and other\n                         authorities and have published a number of articles, chapters, and books on various\n                         topics related to class actions. I also have extensive practical experience with class\n                         actions. In particular, I have drafted, consulted on, and participated in the\n                         administration of many class action settlements throughout the country in both state\n                         and federal courts. I have also served as an expert witness in more than a dozen class\n                         actions in general and settlements in particular.\n\n                      4. I have served as an expert witness on class-related issues for the Farmers defendants in\n                         this matter since 2003, and I testified at the May 2003 preliminary approval hearing. I\n       Farmers\n      Defendants'\n         Exhibit\n           18\n    No.0.1-GV-GZ-oD2501\n\f   am unable to be at the July 1, 2015, hearing on preliminary approval in this matter, as\n   I have a preexisting commitment out of the country during that time. If I were able to\n   present live testimony at the hearing, I would offer the following opinions for the\n   Court's consideration in connection with the decision on preliminary approval of the\n   Second Amended Settlement Agreement, as supplemented (\"Settlement Agreement\").\n\n5. I have reviewed the Fourth Amended Plea in Intervention of Intervenor Charles 0.\n   Grigson, as well as the testimony of Mr. Grigson's expert witness, Charles Silver from\n   the December 4, 2014, hearing in this matter. I understand Mr. Grigson to be\n   challenging the Settlement Agreement because of the issue of how the costs of the\n   settlement are to be borne. As I understand the opposition, Mr. Grigson's view is that\n   it is unfair and improper for defendant Farmers Group, Inc., not to be funding the entire\n   settlement.\n\n6. Any class settlement is ultimately a question of the proper resolution of the case with\n   regard to the claims of the plaintiff class. For example, in Section 3.05 of the ALI\n   Principles of Aggregate Litigation there are four criteria that instruct a supervising\n   court in the approval of a classwide settlement. The four are: (I) the adequacy of the\n   representation of the class; (2) the fairness and reasonableness of the relief obtained in\n   light of the risks and costs of further litigation; (3) the equitable treatment of class\n   members relative to each other; and (4) the absence of collusion in the negotiations.\n   The defendants' respective contributions to the funding of the Settlement Agreement\n   are not mentioned in this account, nor has this been an issue in reported class action\n   decisions with which I am familiar. Instead, the issue is whether the consideration to\n   the class members is fair, adequate, and reasonable in exchange for the release of their\n   existing claims against the defendants.\n\n7. In all my experience with class action settlements, I have not seen a court's settlement\n   approval tum on the inter-defendant distribution of losses. Nor have I seen an objecting\n   class member successfully challenge a class action settlement based on the allocation\n   of settlement funding as between the payors of the settlement. The issue for class\n   members is the exchange they receive for the release of their claims. To the extent\n   there were a dispute over allocation of responsibility among various defendants or their\n   insurers, for example, that would most likely be the subject of a different proceeding at\n   a different time.\n\n8. Allocation among different potential cost-bearers does come up in class action\n   settlements. In class action settlements of securities and shareholder derivative\n   litigation, for example, the settling defendants frequently include the corporation (in\n   which the plaintiff is a shareholder/owner) and officers and directors of the corporation.\n   The allocation itself is not part of the settlement analysis, except insofar as it might\n   indicate that the settlement did not obtain a sufficient amount for the plaintiff class.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f   9. In all of my experience, I have never seen an objecting class member successfully\n      challenge approval of a class action securities or derivative settlement based on these\n      allocation decisions.\n\nI declare under penalty of pe1jury that the foregoing is true and correct.\n\n   EXECUTED in New York County, State ofNew York, on the 28th day ofMay, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Samuel Issacharoff\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f</pre>",
