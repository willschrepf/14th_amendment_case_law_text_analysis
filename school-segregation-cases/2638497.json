Newton, Judge\n\n\n        This appeal arises from an action for wrongful death brought by the estate of\n\nMargaret Rhea (\"Rhea\") against multiple defendants after her car was struck by a fireman\n\nresponding to a fire. The claims against all defendants were settled with the exception of\n\nthe claims against Norman Sapp (\"Sapp\"), the individual fireman who caused the\n\naccident. The trial court entered judgment in favor of Rhea, and Sapp brings two points\n\non appeal. He argues that as a firefighter, he should be shielded from liability and\n\fafforded the protections of either the official immunity doctrine or the public duty\n\ndoctrine. Because we agree with Sapp that official immunity applies, we reverse.\n\n                                     Factual and Procedural History1\n\n         On May 8, 2009, Gilbert Watson (\"Watson\") was driving a semi tractor-trailer rig\n\nwith a forty-foot trailer hauling bulls. He was traveling westbound on Missouri Highway\n\n52 between the cities of Deep Water and Montrose.\n\n         Watson was passed by another automobile that pulled in front of him, and the\n\ndriver of that vehicle began abruptly tapping on his brakes to indicate he wanted Watson\n\nto stop his vehicle. After stopping, Watson was informed that smoke was coming from\n\nthe back of his trailer.\n\n         Watson went to the back of his vehicle to investigate. He could smell smoke and\n\nnoticed that the inside tire on the left rear axle was on fire.                               Watson had a fire\n\nextinguisher in his truck that he used to knock the fire down, but the fire reignited. When\n\nWatson became unable to extinguish the fire with his extinguisher, he dialed 911 and\n\ninformed dispatch that a tire on a cattle trailer was on fire, that the trailer contained bulls,\n\nand that he was halfway between Deepwater and Montrose on Highway 52. While\n\nwaiting on emergency responders to help extinguish the fire, Watson used a cup to get\n\nwater out of the ditch to pour on the burning tire. Rhea was driving eastbound on\n\nHighway 52 and saw the cattle trailer on fire in the lane of traffic.                                  She stopped\n\napproximately one hundred yards behind it waiting for the highway to clear.\n\n\n         1\n          The facts are drawn from the Joint Stipulation of Facts that the parties submitted to the trial court as well\nas from uncontroverted facts in the record.\n\n                                                           2\n\f       Sapp has served on the Montrose Fire Department since 1970 and was serving as\n\nthe chief at the time of these events. Sapp drafted the Department's standard operating\n\nprocedures approximately ten to fifteen years before litigation of this case.           The\n\nprocedures of the department state that if a fireman was to drive in excess of the rules of\n\nthe road, he was to engage the vehicle's lights and sirens. Pursuant to the procedures,\n\nwhen a firefighter receives a pager \"tone,\" he or she is expected to respond pursuant to\n\nthe guidelines, protocols, and statutes in place. He or she is also required to respond in an\n\nappropriate manner to the situation depending on the weather conditions and the severity\n\nof the situation presented.\n\n       Sapp lives on Highway 52 in Montrose. Sapp was at home, sometime around or\n\nafter 9:15 p.m., when he received a report of a fire on a cattle trailer on westbound\n\nHighway 52 halfway between Montrose and Deepwater. Sapp carried the pager utilized\n\nby the Montrose Fire Department that communicated verbal information from the\n\ndispatcher, and in this instance the pager communicated that a cattle trailer was on fire.\n\nWhen Sapp was dispatched, he was not given instructions on how to respond to the call.\n\nSapp was responding in his capacity as fire chief.\n\n       In response to the dispatch, Sapp was driving his personal vehicle, a 2005\n\nChevrolet pickup that was equipped with a siren and a dashboard light. The siren had a\n\n\"wail\" that produced an up-and-down sound and also a \"yelp\" that was \"ear catching\" and\n\nhigh pitched. Sapp went to the scene of the fire with his emergency lights on but did not\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fengage the siren.2 Sapp had knowledge of Highway 52 at the location where dispatch\n\nreported the trailer was located. Prior to responding to the scene of the fire, Sapp had\n\ntraveled this road hundreds of times. Sapp believed that the highway was narrow at the\n\nlocation where dispatch indicated the fire was located and that a vehicle on fire would\n\npotentially block the highway.\n\n           The trailer fire was actually much closer to Sapp's location than was reported to\n\nhim by dispatch. On the way to the scene on Highway 52, Sapp was traveling at\n\napproximately 80 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone. He observed several cars\n\nstopped in the oncoming lane of traffic.3 As he proceeded to pass the stationary vehicles\n\nin the opposite lane, a person stepped from between the vehicles into his lane of traffic.\n\nHe moved onto the edge of the roadway to miss the pedestrian and lost control of his\n\nvehicle. He overcorrected and traveled back across the center line into the oncoming lane\n\nof traffic.\n\n           At approximately 9:28 p.m., Sapp's vehicle collided head-on with Rhea's vehicle,\n\nwhich remained stopped approximately one hundred yards behind the burning trailer.\n\nShe was killed as a result of the collision. Sapp was thrown from his vehicle and severely\n\ninjured but survived.\n\n           In this action for wrongful death, all defendants except Sapp reached a settlement\n\nwith the plaintiffs concerning the claims against them. Sapp filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment, alleging that he was not liable due to both the official immunity doctrine and\n\n           2\n               Sapp testified in his deposition that he intentionally did not use his siren for fear of scaring the bulls in the\ntrailer.\n           3\n            The trailer that was on fire was one of the vehicles he observed, but he did not believe this was the scene\nof the fire because the location identified by dispatch was further down the highway.\n\n                                                                 4\n\fthe public duty doctrine. That motion was denied. The remaining parties entered into an\n\nagreement under Section 537.0654 and then asked the trial court to rule on \"the sole\n\nremaining issue\" of whether Sapp should be immune from liability pursuant to either\n\n\"official immunity\" or the \"public duty doctrine.\" The parties agreed that Sapp would file\n\na Motion to Reconsider the denial of his prior Motion for Summary Judgment to argue\n\nthese immunity issues, and they further agreed that the official immunity and public duty\n\ndeterminations by the trial court would be subject to appeal by either party.\n\n         The parties prepared a \"Joint Stipulation of Facts\" which set forth certain limited\n\nagreed-upon facts. The parties also submitted a written record that contained portions of\n\nmultiple depositions that had been taken during discovery, and they filed additional\n\n\"controverted\" and \"uncontroverted\" statements of fact with supporting documentation.\n\nThe parties also stipulated that Rhea's damages were in the amount of $618,241 if the\n\ndefenses were determined by the trial court to be inapplicable. Following additional legal\n\nbriefing and argument by counsel, the case was submitted to the trial court on these\n\nrecords to determine the sole issue of the application of the defenses. The trial court\n\nconsidered \"the parties' oral arguments, legal briefing, written arguments, exhibits and\n\ndeposition testimony presented with said briefing\" and concluded that Sapp was not\n\nentitled to a defense on either basis. The court entered judgment for Rhea and awarded\n\ndamages in the stipulated amount of $618,241. Sapp appeals.\n\n         Further facts are set forth below as necessary.\n\n         4\n          All statutory references are to RSMo 2000 as currently supplemented unless otherwise indicated. An\nagreement pursuant to section 537.065 provides for a claimant and a tort-feasor to settle a claim and contract to limit\nrecovery of damages to specified assets such as insurance coverage.\n\n                                                          5\n\f                                              Standard of Review\n\n         We review de novo questions of law decided in court-tried cases. Pearson v.\n\nKoster, 367 S.W.3d 36, 43 (Mo. banc 2012) (citing StopAquila.org v. City of Peculiar,\n\n208 S.W.3d 895, 899 (Mo. banc 2006)). The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed\n\n\"unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, it is against the weight of the\n\nevidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law.\" Murphy v. Carron, 536 S.W.2d\n\n30, 32 (Mo. banc 1976).\n\n         When a claim of error on appeal presents a mixed question of law and fact, the\n\nreviewing court applies the same principles noted above except that it must segregate the\n\nparts of the issue that are dependent on factual determinations from those that are\n\ndependent on legal determinations. Pearson, 367 S.W.3d at 44. \"[W]hen presented with\n\nan issue of mixed questions of law and fact, a [reviewing court] will defer to the factual\n\nfindings made by the trial court so long as they are supported by competent, substantial\n\nevidence, but will review de novo the application of the law to those facts.\" Id. (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n         \"Therefore, it is a matter of deferring to the fact-finder in its assessment of the\n\nfacts and then applying de novo review in determining how the law applies to those\n\nfacts.\" Id. (citation omitted).5 In the absence of specific findings of fact, the trial court's\n\n\n\n         5\n            Sapp argues that because the case was submitted on stipulated facts to the trial court in a bench-tried case,\nthis case does not involve the resolution of conflicting testimony and thus our review is de novo. Rhea argues that\nour standard of review is de novo based on the denial of Sapp's motion for summary judgment. Neither is accurate.\nThe stipulated facts consisted of only two paragraphs of facts relevant to the analysis of the issues presented in this\ncase. Clearly, the court, as it stated in its judgment, considered much more than the two paragraphs of stipulated\nfacts filed by the parties. Certain basic facts were stipulated, others remained disputed, and the record contains\nnumerous uncontroverted facts.\n\n                                                           6\n\ffindings are considered as having been found in accordance with the judgment. Rule\n\n73.01(c).\n\n                                                     Analysis\n\n         In his first point, Sapp argues that because he was a public employee performing a\n\ndiscretionary duty, he is entitled to official immunity. This judicially-created doctrine\n\n\"protects public employees from liability for alleged acts of negligence committed during\n\nthe course of their official duties for the performance of discretionary acts.\" Nguyen v.\n\nGrain Valley R-5 Sch. Dist., 353 S.W.3d 725, 729-730 (Mo. App. W.D. 2011) (citing\n\nSouthers v. City of Farmington, 263 S.W.3d 603, 610 (Mo. banc 2008)). \"The function\n\nof official immunity is to protect individual government actors who, despite limited\n\nresources and imperfect information, must exercise judgment in the performance of their\n\nduties.\" Davis v. Lambert–St. Louis Int'l Airport, 193 S.W.3d 760, 765 (Mo. banc 2006).\n\n         \"Whether an act can be characterized as discretionary depends on the degree of\n\nreason and judgment required.\" Nguyen, 353 S.W.3d at 729-30 (citing Southers, 263\n\nS.W.3d at 610). \"A discretionary act requires the exercise of reason in the adaptation of\n\n\n\n\n          The court noted that \"after extensive briefing by both sides,\" and after \"considering the parties' oral\narguments, legal briefing, written arguments, exhibits and deposition testimony presented with briefing,\" it found\nthat Sapp was \"not entitled to the protections of official immunity.\" As for the denial of summary judgment, Sapp\ndid not appeal the denial of summary judgment; rather, Sapp appealed the court's entry of judgment in Rhea's favor\nand its conclusion that, based on these facts, Sapp failed to meet his burden of proof and was not entitled to the\naffirmative defense of official immunity. In essence, this was a trial based on the written record and on limited\nissues because, while many facts were uncontroverted and no live witnesses were called to testify, some factual and\ncredibility determinations were left to the discretion of the trial court. Thus, we review de novo whether the trial\ncourt correctly applied the law to the facts as it determined. However, to the extent that the facts of the case were\ncontested, we defer to the trial court's assessment of the contested evidence. White v. Dir. of Revenue, 321 S.W.3d\n298, 307 (Mo. banc 2010) (citation omitted). Evidence is uncontested when there are stipulated facts or when a\nparty has admitted in his pleadings, by counsel, or through the party's testimony the basic facts of the other party's\ncase. Id. at 308.\n\n                                                          7\n\fmeans to an end and discretion in determining how or whether an act should be done or\n\ncourse pursued.\" Id.\n\n       \"The determination of whether an act is discretionary 'is made on a case-by-case\n\nbasis, considering (1) the nature of the public employee's duties; (2) the extent to which\n\nthe act involves policymaking or exercise of professional judgment; and (3) the\n\nconsequences of not applying official immunity.'\" Id.\n\n       \"Official immunity is only available to a public official when he exercises\n\nlegitimate authority in a discretionary manner.\" Id. at 731 (citing State v. Edwards, 337\n\nS.W.3d 118, 121 (Mo. App. E.D. 2011)).          \"Acts which exceed a public official's\n\nlegitimate authority are not discretionary and are not protected by official immunity.\" Id.\n\nAs the party asserting the affirmative defense of official immunity, an individual\n\ndefendant bears the burden of pleading and proving that he is entitled to that defense. Id.\n\nat 730 (citing Black & Veatch Corp. v. Wellington Syndicate, 302 S.W.3d 114, 127 (Mo.\n\nApp. W.D. 2009)).\n\n       On the other hand, \"[a] ministerial act is defined as an act that law directs the\n\nofficial to perform upon a given set of facts, independent of what the officer may think of\n\nthe propriety or impropriety of doing the act in a particular case.\" Jones v. Carnahan,\n\n965 S.W.2d 209, 213 (Mo. App. W.D. 1998) (citation omitted). It can also be \"of a\n\nclerical nature\" in which \"a public officer is required to perform upon a given state of\n\nfacts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, without\n\nregard to his/her own judgment or opinion concerning the propriety of the act to be\n\nperformed.\" Richardson v. Sherwood, 337 S.W.3d 58, 63 (Mo. App. W.D. 2011) (citing\n\n                                            8\n\fSouthers, 263 S.W.3d at 610). \"Acts which are discretionary are protected, while acts\n\nwhich are ministerial are not; the court must determine whether the challenged act was\n\ndiscretionary or ministerial.\" Id. at 63 (citing Davis, 193 S.W.3d at 763).\n\n       The general rule as to police officers and other emergency responders is that when\n\nthey are \"driving in non-emergency situations, [they] do not benefit from official\n\nimmunity.\" Davis v. Lambert-St. Louis Int'l Airport, 193 S.W.3d 760, 763 (Mo. banc\n\n2006). \"When an officer is responding to an emergency, however, the officer exercises\n\njudgment and discretion and is entitled to official immunity.\" Id. The rationale is that\n\nthe officer in an emergency situation must use discretion regarding how fast he or she can\n\nsafely drive in response to the call, the route he or she must take based on the amount of\n\ntraffic, and the location of the problem. Id. Without official immunity, an officer may be\n\novercautious and not act decisively. Brown v. Tate, 888 S.W.2d 413, 415 (Mo. App.\n\nW.D. 1994). \"We grant them immunity in order that they may act decisively, even\n\nthough they might afterwards, by hindsight, be adjudged to have acted negligently.\" Id.\n\n(citation omitted). However, in a non-emergency situation, the operation of a vehicle\n\ndoes not require a public official to exercise policymaking or the exercise of professional\n\nexpertise or judgment. Id.\n\n       In Southers, a police officer joined a pursuit as the third police vehicle chasing a\n\nsuspect after the police department was alerted to a robbery. 263 S.W.3d at 607-08. The\n\nthird officer's action arguably violated the department's vehicular pursuit policy, which\n\nlimited police pursuits \"normally . . . to no more than one primary vehicle and one\n\nbackup vehicle, unless specifically instructed otherwise. . . .\" Id. at 608. In the course of\n\n                                             9\n\fthe pursuit, the officer in the third vehicle caused an accident. The Supreme Court held\n\nthat the officer's conduct \"was in the course of his official duties and involved the kind of\n\ndiscretionary decisions that require professional expertise and judgment that the official\n\nimmunity doctrine is intended to protect.\" Id. at 619. Even though there was a violation\n\nof the department's policy, the court held he was entitled to the shield of official\n\nimmunity.\n\n       In Davis, a police officer responded to an \"officer-in-need-of-aid\" emergency call.\n\n193 S.W.3d at 763. The court held that the officer exercised judgment in determining\n\nwhich route to take based on the amount of traffic in the area and the location of the\n\nofficer in need and further that the officer exercised judgment and professional expertise\n\nin determining the speed he could travel. Id. The court concluded that \"[i]mposing\n\nliability upon the officer in these cases might delay responses to emergency calls, thereby\n\nadversely affecting officers or citizens in need of emergency assistance.\" Id.\n\n       In McCormack v. Douglas, 328 S.W.3d 446 (Mo. App. S.D. 2010), the Southern\n\nDistrict of our court considered whether the official immunity doctrine applied in the\n\ncontext of a volunteer firefighter. In that case, the sheriff's department and the fire\n\ndistrict were alerted to a car accident. Id. at 448. A dispatcher instructed a volunteer\n\nfirefighter to drive to a fire station to pick up an ambulance-type vehicle and equipment.\n\nId. The volunteer traveled from his residence in a vehicle equipped with activated\n\nemergency lights and sirens. Id. On his way to the fire station, the volunteer collided\n\nwith a vehicle driven by a police officer, who died as a result of the collision. Id. An\n\naccident reconstruction report concluded that the collision was \"caused by the\n\n                                             10\n\f[volunteer's] failure to stop or slow his vehicle at [a] stop sign.\" Id. at 449. The district's\n\ninternal policy required firefighters to \"come to a complete stop, establish eye contact\n\nwith drivers of other vehicles, wait two seconds, and then proceed with caution.\" Id.\n\n       In an action for negligence, the McCormack court reviewed the undisputed facts\n\nand held that the volunteer firefighter was entitled to official immunity, noting that there\n\nwas no willful wrong, bad faith, or malice just because the volunteer violated the district's\n\npolicy. The McCormack court held that, without more, any allegation of a violation of an\n\ninternal policy is an allegation of negligence, not bad faith, and that the facts of the case\n\n\"amount to nothing more than negligence during the course of [the volunteer's] duties in\n\nthe performance of discretionary acts.\" Id. at 451. See also Bachmann v. Welby, 860\n\nS.W.2d 31 (Mo. App. E.D. 1993) (reversing trial court and holding that official immunity\n\ndoctrine applied where officer collided with another vehicle in responding to an all-\n\npoints-bulletin because speeding was a discretionary act).\n\n       Applying those principles to this case, we hold that the trial court erred in entering\n\njudgment for Rhea because Sapp sufficiently established that he was entitled to the\n\nprotection of official immunity. Although the trial court did not make written findings of\n\nfact as to whether Sapp was responding to an emergency or whether Sapp's actions were\n\ndiscretionary or ministerial, implicit in its judgment is a determination that Sapp was\n\nresponding to a non-emergency and/or that his actions were ministerial and not\n\ndiscretionary. Those findings of fact are not supported by competent and substantial\n\nevidence, and under these facts the trial court erred as a matter of law in not applying the\n\nofficial immunity doctrine.\n\n                                              11\n\f       The parties' relevant stipulated facts, which are folded into the factual and\n\nprocedural history, supra, are these:\n\n       1.      On May 8, 2009, Norman Sapp, the chief of the volunteer\n       firefighters for Montrose, Missouri, responded to a report of a fire on a\n       cattle trailer on westbound Hwy 52 halfway between Montrose and\n       Deepwater, Missouri. In actuality, the trailer was less than a mile from Mr.\n       Sapp's house, also located on Hwy 52.\n\n       2.     As Mr. Sapp passed the stopped trailer eastbound at almost eighty\n       miles an hour, he lost control of his truck and crashed into a minivan driven\n       by Margaret Rhea. Mrs. Rhea's vehicle was parked 100 yards behind the\n       stopped trailer. Mrs. Rhea was killed as a result of the collision. Mr. Sapp\n       was thrown from his vehicle but survived.\n\n       The record contains additional relevant uncontroverted facts: when Watson could\n\nnot put out the fire with his fire extinguisher, he dialed 911; Sapp had served on the\n\nMontrose fire department since 1970 and as a deputy and a reserve deputy for the county\n\nsince 1986; Sapp was summoned by dispatch; Sapp had knowledge of Highway 52 at the\n\nlocation where dispatch reported the trailer was on fire; Sapp believed the highway was\n\nnarrow at that location; Sapp believed that a vehicle on fire would potentially block the\n\nhighway; it was after 9 p.m. at night so it would be dark on the highway.\n\n       Here, Sapp acted in the course of his duties as chief of the fire department when he\n\nresponded to the fire. Based on the circumstances known to him at the time, Sapp\n\nexercised his discretion when he elected to speed while traveling to the fire. Just as in\n\nDavis, where the officer exceeded the speed limit in response to an \"officer-in-need-of-\n\naid\" emergency call, Sapp exercised judgment in determining the speed he could travel in\n\nresponse to a call from dispatch of a fire on a cattle trailer in the middle of the highway.\n\n193 S.W.3d at 763. And just as in McCormack, where a volunteer firefighter elected to\n\n                                            12\n\frun a stop sign in performing tasks he was directed to perform in the course of responding\n\nto a call from dispatch, Sapp exercised discretion in choosing to speed to the scene of a\n\nfire on a loaded cattle trailer. 328 S.W.3d at 449.\n\n       In arguing that Sapp did not establish that he was entitled to official immunity,\n\nRhea correctly notes that we must view the record in the light most favorable to the\n\njudgment. In that vein, Rhea cites additional facts from the record in an effort to\n\nestablish that Sapp was not responding to an emergency and that his actions that night\n\nwere ministerial. Rhea's arguments are essentially threefold: 1) driving within the speed\n\nlimit was a ministerial activity for Sapp because the Montrose Fire Department had\n\nexplicitly dictated a policy that firefighters not exceed the speed limit when responding to\n\nalerts; 2) non-emergency driving is not exercising professional expertise and judgment;\n\n3) the facts do not rise to the level of an emergency, but even assuming this was an\n\nemergency, the \"unique circumstances of this incident removed the need for Sapp's\n\nprofessional expertise.\"\n\n       As to Rhea's first argument, the record indicates that the fire department's written\n\noperating procedures and guidelines regarding responding to any calls, including\n\nextreme, life-threatening emergencies, required all firefighters to obey all speed laws.\n\nPart of the protocol also stated that if a responder exceeded the speed limit, he or she was\n\nto engage lights and sirens. That policy is based on the fact that others may need to be\n\nalerted that a vehicle is traveling in excess of the normal speed laws. Rhea alleges that\n\nSapp had no discretion to speed (almost eighty miles per hour in a fifty-five mile per hour\n\nzone) because of the policy and therefore that his arrival to the fire was ministerial. In a\n\n                                             13\n\fnutshell, the argument is that the internal policy of the fire department removed any\n\ndiscretion that Sapp may have had to exceed the speed limit and therefore that his driving\n\nthat evening was solely a ministerial act.\n\n       Courts have dispensed with Rhea's arguments regarding internal policies. Most\n\nbluntly, the Southers court held that \"[p]ublic employees' conduct that is contrary to\n\napplicable statutes or policies can constitute evidence that their conduct was negligent,\n\nbut that conduct does not remove their negligence from the protections of the official\n\nimmunity or public duty doctrines where the provisions at issue indicate no intent to\n\nmodify or supersede these common law immunity protections.\" 263 S.W.3d at 617\n\n(emphasis added). Here, nothing in the departmental policy supplants the common law\n\nimmunity protections and, accordingly, the official immunity doctrine is unaffected by\n\nallegations of policy violations. See id. As we are bound to follow the precedent from\n\nour Supreme Court in Southers, we reject Rhea's argument that the departmental policy\n\nremoved Sapp's discretion or otherwise rendered Sapp's activity ministerial.\n\n       Rhea additionally argues that non-emergency driving is not exercising\n\nprofessional expertise and judgment.         As determined above, while this is a correct\n\ncitation to the law generally, Davis, 193 S.W.3d at 763, the uncontroverted facts of this\n\nrecord indicate that Sapp was responding as fire chief to a dispatch report of a fire on a\n\ncattle trailer on a narrow two-lane highway after dark. Additionally, Rhea's two cases\n\ncited in support of her argument that not all responses are emergency responses do not\n\naid her: Thomas v. Brandt, 325 S.W.3d 481, 484 (Mo. App. E.D. 2010), and Anderson v.\n\nJones, 902 S.W.2d 889, 890 (Mo. App. E.D. 1995). In Thomas, the question was\n\n                                               14\n\fwhether emergency medical personnel were facing an emergency when they had already\n\narrived at the scene and were working with a patient who was stable; notably, Thomas did\n\nnot involve non-emergency driving. 325 S.W.3d at 482. The Thomas court held that the\n\n\"time and information available to [emergency medical personnel] was more like that of a\n\ndoctor treating a patient in a hospital than that of an emergency responder arriving to find\n\na patient in critical and devolving condition\" such that there was no emergency. 325\n\nS.W.3d at 484-85. In Anderson, the court held that there was a genuine issue of material\n\nfact as to whether there was an emergency where a witness contradicted the officer's\n\nstatement that the officer was pursuing a speeding car when he collided with another\n\nvehicle. 902 S.W.2d at 890. In other words, the differing accounts of the officer's\n\nactions in Thomas created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was an\n\nemergency that prompted the officer's excessive speed. Id. at 892. Neither case aids\n\nRhea because here, as explained above, the key uncontroverted facts sufficiently establish\n\nthat Sapp was responding in his official capacity to an emergency.\n\n       Rhea additionally argues that the facts of this case make it \"evident and obvious\n\nthat until Sapp drove his truck onto the scene at eighty miles an hour there was no\n\napparent or imminent threat to life or property to the people and vehicles parked on\" the\n\nhighway. To this end, Rhea contends that the Montrose Fire Department was called to\n\nprovide backup and support the Deepwater Fire Department, not to fight the fire; that the\n\nspeed limit was fifty-five miles per hour; that the policy mandated that responders drive\n\nthe speed limit; that this point on the highway was \"open, flat, straight, and unobstructed,\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fallowing anyone approaching the stopped traffic ample and adequate time to slow down\";\n\nthat Sapp's response required no special skill or expertise.\n\n         Again, none of those facts -- even viewing them in the light most favorable to the\n\njudgment -- overcome the uncontroverted facts indicating that Sapp was responding to an\n\nemergency.        Even if Sapp was called to provide backup and support another fire\n\ndepartment (and even assuming he knew this was his role), such a fact does not change\n\nhis actions from discretionary to ministerial. As noted above, the volunteer firefighter in\n\nMcCormack was instructed by dispatch to drive to a fire station to pick up equipment,\n\nsuch that he, too, was providing backup and support for primary responders.                                        To\n\nunderscore the point, in that case, the firefighter's failure to follow departmental policy as\n\nto stop signs caused a fatal wreck while he was undertaking a role in a backup or support\n\nposition. As noted above, McCormack's facts indicated \"nothing more than negligence\n\nduring the course of [the volunteer's] duties in the performance of discretionary acts.\"\n\n328 S.W.3d at 451.\n\n         Nor can we accept Rhea's invitation to view \"unique circumstances of this incident\n\n[so as to remove] the need for Sapp's professional expertise.\" Rhea asks us to determine\n\nthat the cattle trailer fire on the highway at night was not an emergency because that point\n\non the highway was \"open, flat, straight, and unobstructed, allowing anyone approaching\n\nthe stopped traffic ample and adequate time to slow down\"6 and because Sapp's response\n\nrequired no special skill or expertise. But, although the unique facts may establish\n\n\n         6\n           We note that dispatch reported the location of the scene to be further down the highway, which is the\nlocation that Sapp was responding to when he came upon the actual scene of the fire.\n\n                                                         16\n\fnegligence such that he could have and should have been driving at a safer speed, neither\n\nthe unique character of the road nor the fire chief's role as backup to another department\n\nchanges the nature of Sapp's actions from discretionary to ministerial under the current\n\nstate of the law.\n\n       This point is granted. In this case, under these facts, our holding on this point\n\nrenders unnecessary a determination of whether the public duty doctrine applies.\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          __________________________________\n                                          Gary D.

Newton, Judge\n\n\n        This appeal arises from an action for wrongful death brought by the estate of\n\nMargaret Rhea (\"Rhea\") against multiple defendants after her car was struck by a fireman\n\nresponding to a fire. The claims against all defendants were settled with the exception of\n\nthe claims against Norman Sapp (\"Sapp\"), the individual fireman who caused the\n\naccident. The trial court entered judgment in favor of Rhea, and Sapp brings two points\n\non appeal. He argues that as a firefighter, he should be shielded from liability and\n\fafforded the protections of either the official immunity doctrine or the public duty\n\ndoctrine. Because we agree with Sapp that official immunity applies, we reverse.\n\n                                     Factual and Procedural History1\n\n         On May 8, 2009, Gilbert Watson (\"Watson\") was driving a semi tractor-trailer rig\n\nwith a forty-foot trailer hauling bulls. He was traveling westbound on Missouri Highway\n\n52 between the cities of Deep Water and Montrose.\n\n         Watson was passed by another automobile that pulled in front of him, and the\n\ndriver of that vehicle began abruptly tapping on his brakes to indicate he wanted Watson\n\nto stop his vehicle. After stopping, Watson was informed that smoke was coming from\n\nthe back of his trailer.\n\n         Watson went to the back of his vehicle to investigate. He could smell smoke and\n\nnoticed that the inside tire on the left rear axle was on fire.                               Watson had a fire\n\nextinguisher in his truck that he used to knock the fire down, but the fire reignited. When\n\nWatson became unable to extinguish the fire with his extinguisher, he dialed 911 and\n\ninformed dispatch that a tire on a cattle trailer was on fire, that the trailer contained bulls,\n\nand that he was halfway between Deepwater and Montrose on Highway 52. While\n\nwaiting on emergency responders to help extinguish the fire, Watson used a cup to get\n\nwater out of the ditch to pour on the burning tire. Rhea was driving eastbound on\n\nHighway 52 and saw the cattle trailer on fire in the lane of traffic.                                  She stopped\n\napproximately one hundred yards behind it waiting for the highway to clear.\n\n\n         1\n          The facts are drawn from the Joint Stipulation of Facts that the parties submitted to the trial court as well\nas from uncontroverted facts in the record.\n\n                                                           2\n\f       Sapp has served on the Montrose Fire Department since 1970 and was serving as\n\nthe chief at the time of these events. Sapp drafted the Department's standard operating\n\nprocedures approximately ten to fifteen years before litigation of this case.           The\n\nprocedures of the department state that if a fireman was to drive in excess of the rules of\n\nthe road, he was to engage the vehicle's lights and sirens. Pursuant to the procedures,\n\nwhen a firefighter receives a pager \"tone,\" he or she is expected to respond pursuant to\n\nthe guidelines, protocols, and statutes in place. He or she is also required to respond in an\n\nappropriate manner to the situation depending on the weather conditions and the severity\n\nof the situation presented.\n\n       Sapp lives on Highway 52 in Montrose. Sapp was at home, sometime around or\n\nafter 9:15 p.m., when he received a report of a fire on a cattle trailer on westbound\n\nHighway 52 halfway between Montrose and Deepwater. Sapp carried the pager utilized\n\nby the Montrose Fire Department that communicated verbal information from the\n\ndispatcher, and in this instance the pager communicated that a cattle trailer was on fire.\n\nWhen Sapp was dispatched, he was not given instructions on how to respond to the call.\n\nSapp was responding in his capacity as fire chief.\n\n       In response to the dispatch, Sapp was driving his personal vehicle, a 2005\n\nChevrolet pickup that was equipped with a siren and a dashboard light. The siren had a\n\n\"wail\" that produced an up-and-down sound and also a \"yelp\" that was \"ear catching\" and\n\nhigh pitched. Sapp went to the scene of the fire with his emergency lights on but did not\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fengage the siren.2 Sapp had knowledge of Highway 52 at the location where dispatch\n\nreported the trailer was located. Prior to responding to the scene of the fire, Sapp had\n\ntraveled this road hundreds of times. Sapp believed that the highway was narrow at the\n\nlocation where dispatch indicated the fire was located and that a vehicle on fire would\n\npotentially block the highway.\n\n           The trailer fire was actually much closer to Sapp's location than was reported to\n\nhim by dispatch. On the way to the scene on Highway 52, Sapp was traveling at\n\napproximately 80 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone. He observed several cars\n\nstopped in the oncoming lane of traffic.3 As he proceeded to pass the stationary vehicles\n\nin the opposite lane, a person stepped from between the vehicles into his lane of traffic.\n\nHe moved onto the edge of the roadway to miss the pedestrian and lost control of his\n\nvehicle. He overcorrected and traveled back across the center line into the oncoming lane\n\nof traffic.\n\n           At approximately 9:28 p.m., Sapp's vehicle collided head-on with Rhea's vehicle,\n\nwhich remained stopped approximately one hundred yards behind the burning trailer.\n\nShe was killed as a result of the collision. Sapp was thrown from his vehicle and severely\n\ninjured but survived.\n\n           In this action for wrongful death, all defendants except Sapp reached a settlement\n\nwith the plaintiffs concerning the claims against them. Sapp filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment, alleging that he was not liable due to both the official immunity doctrine and\n\n           2\n               Sapp testified in his deposition that he intentionally did not use his siren for fear of scaring the bulls in the\ntrailer.\n           3\n            The trailer that was on fire was one of the vehicles he observed, but he did not believe this was the scene\nof the fire because the location identified by dispatch was further down the highway.\n\n                                                                 4\n\fthe public duty doctrine. That motion was denied. The remaining parties entered into an\n\nagreement under Section 537.0654 and then asked the trial court to rule on \"the sole\n\nremaining issue\" of whether Sapp should be immune from liability pursuant to either\n\n\"official immunity\" or the \"public duty doctrine.\" The parties agreed that Sapp would file\n\na Motion to Reconsider the denial of his prior Motion for Summary Judgment to argue\n\nthese immunity issues, and they further agreed that the official immunity and public duty\n\ndeterminations by the trial court would be subject to appeal by either party.\n\n         The parties prepared a \"Joint Stipulation of Facts\" which set forth certain limited\n\nagreed-upon facts. The parties also submitted a written record that contained portions of\n\nmultiple depositions that had been taken during discovery, and they filed additional\n\n\"controverted\" and \"uncontroverted\" statements of fact with supporting documentation.\n\nThe parties also stipulated that Rhea's damages were in the amount of $618,241 if the\n\ndefenses were determined by the trial court to be inapplicable. Following additional legal\n\nbriefing and argument by counsel, the case was submitted to the trial court on these\n\nrecords to determine the sole issue of the application of the defenses. The trial court\n\nconsidered \"the parties' oral arguments, legal briefing, written arguments, exhibits and\n\ndeposition testimony presented with said briefing\" and concluded that Sapp was not\n\nentitled to a defense on either basis. The court entered judgment for Rhea and awarded\n\ndamages in the stipulated amount of $618,241. Sapp appeals.\n\n         Further facts are set forth below as necessary.\n\n         4\n          All statutory references are to RSMo 2000 as currently supplemented unless otherwise indicated. An\nagreement pursuant to section 537.065 provides for a claimant and a tort-feasor to settle a claim and contract to limit\nrecovery of damages to specified assets such as insurance coverage.\n\n                                                          5\n\f                                              Standard of Review\n\n         We review de novo questions of law decided in court-tried cases.

App. E.D. 1993) (reversing trial court and holding that official immunity\n\ndoctrine applied where officer collided with another vehicle in responding to an all-\n\npoints-bulletin because speeding was a discretionary act).\n\n       Applying those principles to this case, we hold that the trial court erred in entering\n\njudgment for Rhea because Sapp sufficiently established that he was entitled to the\n\nprotection of official immunity. Although the trial court did not make written findings of\n\nfact as to whether Sapp was responding to an emergency or whether Sapp's actions were\n\ndiscretionary or ministerial, implicit in its judgment is a determination that Sapp was\n\nresponding to a non-emergency and/or that his actions were ministerial and not\n\ndiscretionary. Those findings of fact are not supported by competent and substantial\n\nevidence, and under these facts the trial court erred as a matter of law in not applying the\n\nofficial immunity doctrine.\n\n                                              11\n\f       The parties' relevant stipulated facts, which are folded into the factual and\n\nprocedural history, supra, are these:\n\n       1.      On May 8, 2009, Norman Sapp, the chief of the volunteer\n       firefighters for Montrose, Missouri, responded to a report of a fire on a\n       cattle trailer on westbound Hwy 52 halfway between Montrose and\n       Deepwater, Missouri. In actuality, the trailer was less than a mile from Mr.\n       Sapp's house, also located on Hwy 52.\n\n       2.     As Mr. Sapp passed the stopped trailer eastbound at almost eighty\n       miles an hour, he lost control of his truck and crashed into a minivan driven\n       by Margaret Rhea. Mrs. Rhea's vehicle was parked 100 yards behind the\n       stopped trailer. Mrs. Rhea was killed as a result of the collision. Mr. Sapp\n       was thrown from his vehicle but survived.\n\n       The record contains additional relevant uncontroverted facts: when Watson could\n\nnot put out the fire with his fire extinguisher, he dialed 911; Sapp had served on the\n\nMontrose fire department since 1970 and as a deputy and a reserve deputy for the county\n\nsince 1986; Sapp was summoned by dispatch; Sapp had knowledge of Highway 52 at the\n\nlocation where dispatch reported the trailer was on fire; Sapp believed the highway was\n\nnarrow at that location; Sapp believed that a vehicle on fire would potentially block the\n\nhighway; it was after 9 p.m. at night so it would be dark on the highway.\n\n       Here, Sapp acted in the course of his duties as chief of the fire department when he\n\nresponded to the fire. Based on the circumstances known to him at the time, Sapp\n\nexercised his discretion when he elected to speed while traveling to the fire. Just as in\n\nDavis, where the officer exceeded the speed limit in response to an \"officer-in-need-of-\n\naid\" emergency call, Sapp exercised judgment in determining the speed he could travel in\n\nresponse to a call from dispatch of a fire on a cattle trailer in the middle of the highway.\n\n193 S.W.3d at 763. And just as in McCormack, where a volunteer firefighter elected to\n\n                                            12\n\frun a stop sign in performing tasks he was directed to perform in the course of responding\n\nto a call from dispatch, Sapp exercised discretion in choosing to speed to the scene of a\n\nfire on a loaded cattle trailer. 328 S.W.3d at 449.\n\n       In arguing that Sapp did not establish that he was entitled to official immunity,\n\nRhea correctly notes that we must view the record in the light most favorable to the\n\njudgment. In that vein, Rhea cites additional facts from the record in an effort to\n\nestablish that Sapp was not responding to an emergency and that his actions that night\n\nwere ministerial. Rhea's arguments are essentially threefold: 1) driving within the speed\n\nlimit was a ministerial activity for Sapp because the Montrose Fire Department had\n\nexplicitly dictated a policy that firefighters not exceed the speed limit when responding to\n\nalerts; 2) non-emergency driving is not exercising professional expertise and judgment;\n\n3) the facts do not rise to the level of an emergency, but even assuming this was an\n\nemergency, the \"unique circumstances of this incident removed the need for Sapp's\n\nprofessional expertise.\"\n\n       As to Rhea's first argument, the record indicates that the fire department's written\n\noperating procedures and guidelines regarding responding to any calls, including\n\nextreme, life-threatening emergencies, required all firefighters to obey all speed laws.\n\nPart of the protocol also stated that if a responder exceeded the speed limit, he or she was\n\nto engage lights and sirens. That policy is based on the fact that others may need to be\n\nalerted that a vehicle is traveling in excess of the normal speed laws. Rhea alleges that\n\nSapp had no discretion to speed (almost eighty miles per hour in a fifty-five mile per hour\n\nzone) because of the policy and therefore that his arrival to the fire was ministerial. In a\n\n                                             13\n\fnutshell, the argument is that the internal policy of the fire department removed any\n\ndiscretion that Sapp may have had to exceed the speed limit and therefore that his driving\n\nthat evening was solely a ministerial act.\n\n       Courts have dispensed with Rhea's arguments regarding internal policies. Most\n\nbluntly, the Southers court held that \"[p]ublic employees' conduct that is contrary to\n\napplicable statutes or policies can constitute evidence that their conduct was negligent,\n\nbut that conduct does not remove their negligence from the protections of the official\n\nimmunity or public duty doctrines where the provisions at issue indicate no intent to\n\nmodify or supersede these common law immunity protections.\" 263 S.W.3d at 617\n\n(emphasis added). Here, nothing in the departmental policy supplants the common law\n\nimmunity protections and, accordingly, the official immunity doctrine is unaffected by\n\nallegations of policy violations. See id. As we are bound to follow the precedent from\n\nour Supreme Court in Southers, we reject Rhea's argument that the departmental policy\n\nremoved Sapp's discretion or otherwise rendered Sapp's activity ministerial.\n\n       Rhea additionally argues that non-emergency driving is not exercising\n\nprofessional expertise and judgment.         As determined above, while this is a correct\n\ncitation to the law generally, Davis, 193 S.W.3d at 763, the uncontroverted facts of this\n\nrecord indicate that Sapp was responding as fire chief to a dispatch report of a fire on a\n\ncattle trailer on a narrow two-lane highway after dark. Additionally, Rhea's two cases\n\ncited in support of her argument that not all responses are emergency responses do not\n\naid her: Thomas v. Brandt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2270369\"><a href=\"/opinion/2270369/thomas-v-brandt/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (Mo. App. E.D. 2010), and Anderson v.\n\nJones, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 890 (Mo. App. E.D. 1995). In Thomas, the question was\n\n                                               14\n\fwhether emergency medical personnel were facing an emergency when they had already\n\narrived at the scene and were working with a patient who was stable; notably, Thomas did\n\nnot involve non-emergency driving. 325 S.W.3d at 482. The Thomas court held that the\n\n\"time and information available to [emergency medical personnel] was more like that of a\n\ndoctor treating a patient in a hospital than that of an emergency responder arriving to find\n\na patient in critical and devolving condition\" such that there was no emergency. 325\n\nS.W.3d at 484-85. In Anderson, the court held that there was a genuine issue of material\n\nfact as to whether there was an emergency where a witness contradicted the officer's\n\nstatement that the officer was pursuing a speeding car when he collided with another\n\nvehicle. 902 S.W.2d at 890. In other words, the differing accounts of the officer's\n\nactions in Thomas created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was an\n\nemergency that prompted the officer's excessive speed. Id. at 892. Neither case aids\n\nRhea because here, as explained above, the key uncontroverted facts sufficiently establish\n\nthat Sapp was responding in his official capacity to an emergency.\n\n       Rhea additionally argues that the facts of this case make it \"evident and obvious\n\nthat until Sapp drove his truck onto the scene at eighty miles an hour there was no\n\napparent or imminent threat to life or property to the people and vehicles parked on\" the\n\nhighway. To this end, Rhea contends that the Montrose Fire Department was called to\n\nprovide backup and support the Deepwater Fire Department, not to fight the fire; that the\n\nspeed limit was fifty-five miles per hour; that the policy mandated that responders drive\n\nthe speed limit; that this point on the highway was \"open, flat, straight, and unobstructed,\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fallowing anyone approaching the stopped traffic ample and adequate time to slow down\";\n\nthat Sapp's response required no special skill or expertise.\n\n         Again, none of those facts -- even viewing them in the light most favorable to the\n\njudgment -- overcome the uncontroverted facts indicating that Sapp was responding to an\n\nemergency.        Even if Sapp was called to provide backup and support another fire\n\ndepartment (and even assuming he knew this was his role), such a fact does not change\n\nhis actions from discretionary to ministerial. As noted above, the volunteer firefighter in\n\nMcCormack was instructed by dispatch to drive to a fire station to pick up equipment,\n\nsuch that he, too, was providing backup and support for primary responders.                                        To\n\nunderscore the point, in that case, the firefighter's failure to follow departmental policy as\n\nto stop signs caused a fatal wreck while he was undertaking a role in a backup or support\n\nposition. As noted above, McCormack's facts indicated \"nothing more than negligence\n\nduring the course of [the volunteer's] duties in the performance of discretionary acts.\"\n\n328 S.W.3d at 451.\n\n         Nor can we accept Rhea's invitation to view \"unique circumstances of this incident\n\n[so as to remove] the need for Sapp's professional expertise.\" Rhea asks us to determine\n\nthat the cattle trailer fire on the highway at night was not an emergency because that point\n\non the highway was \"open, flat, straight, and unobstructed, allowing anyone approaching\n\nthe stopped traffic ample and adequate time to slow down\"6 and because Sapp's response\n\nrequired no special skill or expertise. But, although the unique facts may establish\n\n\n         6\n           We note that dispatch reported the location of the scene to be further down the highway, which is the\nlocation that Sapp was responding to when he came upon the actual scene of the fire.\n\n                                                         16\n\fnegligence such that he could have and should have been driving at a safer speed, neither\n\nthe unique character of the road nor the fire chief's role as backup to another department\n\nchanges the nature of Sapp's actions from discretionary to ministerial under the current\n\nstate of the law.\n\n       This point is granted. In this case, under these facts, our holding on this point\n\nrenders unnecessary a determination of whether the public duty doctrine applies.\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          __________________________________\n                                          Gary D.
