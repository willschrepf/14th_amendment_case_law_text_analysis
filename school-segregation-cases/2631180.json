We will affirm.\n\n                                            I.\n\n      The essential facts, recounted in the light most favorable to Dinote, are as follows.\n\nOn May 9, 2010, Dinote was arrested and detained overnight following a domestic\n\ndispute. The following afternoon she was arraigned by video and ordered released.\n\nWithin the hour, the Justice of the Peace Court sent the release order to Central Offender\n\nRecords (“COR”), the Delaware Department of Correction (“DOC”) unit that controls\n\ninmate records and processes release paperwork. COR takes a number of steps in\n\nprocessing the paperwork, such as verifying that the detainee has no other open charges\n\nor warrants. The effect is that even if a judge has ordered a person released, and even if\n\njail personnel are aware of that order, the institution awaits receipt of the requisite\n\ndirection from COR before it permits a person to leave its custody.\n\n      On the night of May 10, before COR processed Dinote’s release paperwork, she\n\nwas transferred from the predominately male Sussex Correctional Institute (“SCI”) to an\n\nall-women’s institution, Baylor Women’s Correctional Facility (“Baylor”). According to\n\nDinote, she was injured during the transport, denied prompt medical treatment, and\n\nsubjected to a strip search upon arrival at Baylor, where she was also made to shower,\n\nwithout soap, in a soiled stall. She was released from Baylor just before 1 p.m. on May\n\n11, COR having finished processing her release paperwork.\n\n      Dinote’s transfer is explained by a DOC practice or policy under which the DOC\n\n                                            2\n\fpermits law enforcement officers to bring women arrested in Sussex County, Delaware,\n\nto SCI as a courtesy, rather than requiring them to travel to Baylor in New Castle County\n\n– the only women’s facility in Delaware. Defendant Carl Danberg, the (now former)\n\nDOC Commissioner, testified in a deposition that this accommodation permits “local law\n\nenforcement to get back on the street and involved in their policing duties faster.” (App.\n\n64.)1 However, because SCI is a male prison and has a limited number of holding cells\n\navailable to house women, female arrestees brought to SCI are then transferred to Baylor,\n\nusually within 24 hours.\n\n      On March 26, 2012, Dinote filed a complaint against Danberg; Rebecca McBride,\n\nthe director of COR; Michael Deloy, the former warden of SCI; G.R. Johnson, the deputy\n\nor acting warden at SCI; and Patrick Ryan, the warden of Baylor. Of her original claims,\n\nonly two remain for decision on appeal: a claim against Danberg, McBride, and Johnson\n\nfor violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, and a claim\n\nagainst these defendants for violation of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures. The District Court granted defendants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment, reasoning that the equal protection claim failed because male and\n\nfemale inmates can constitutionally be separated, and neither the transfer nor the\n\ncentralized processing of releases amounted to a Fourteenth Amendment violation. On\n\nDinote’s Fourth Amendment claim, the Court held that there was no evidence that these\n\n\n1\n  Danberg also testified about other facilities that accommodate women, including a work\nrelease center and a violation of probation center, both on the same campus as SCI, but\nalso indicated that these are not open to pretrial detainees.\n                                               3\n\fdefendants had anything to do with the strip search itself or the policy at Baylor, and\n\ntherefore could not be held liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Dinote’s subsequent motion\n\nfor reconsideration was denied. This appeal followed.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. We have\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our review of the order granting summary judgment\n\nis plenary. S.H. v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 256 (3d Cir. 2013). Summary\n\njudgment is proper where “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any\n\nmaterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). We “view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw\n\nall reasonable inferences in that party’s favor.” S.H., 729 F.3d at 256.\n\n                                            III.\n\n                                            A.\n\n       Dinote challenges as a violation of equal protection the practice of transferring\n\nfemale arrestees from SCI to Baylor within 24 hours of their arrival. A successful claim\n\nthat a government practice or policy violates the Equal Protection Clause requires proof\n\nthat the plaintiff “has been treated differently from persons who are similarly situated.”\n\nWilliams v. Morton, 343 F.3d 212, 221 (3d Cir. 2003). Even differential treatment is\n\npermissible, however, if it bears a sufficient nexus to a qualifying governmental interest;\n\nin the case of a gender classification, the state must show that the classification “serves\n\nimportant governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\n\n                                             4\n\fsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” United States v. Virginia,\n\n518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).2\n\n       Although Dinote argues that the transfer policy is unsupported by an important\n\ngovernmental objective, she does not dispute that prisoners may constitutionally be\n\nseparated by gender. Her true challenge is to the means used to effectuate that goal; i.e.,\n\nthat SCI transfers women to Baylor, and generally does so within 24 hours. While men\n\ncan stay at SCI until their release, Dinote asserts, women cannot, though SCI could easily\n\nhold women for up to 48 hours. But transferring women, and quickly, to a facility that\n\ncan accommodate them directly accomplishes the goal of providing gender-segregated\n\ninstitutions. See Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 725-26 (1982)\n\n(intermediate scrutiny requires “direct, substantial relationship between objective and\n\nmeans” to “assure that the validity of a classification is determined through reasoned\n\nanalysis rather than through the mechanical application of” stereotypes about gender\n\nroles). Dinote ignores the record evidence that the number of women entering SCI can\n\nfluctuate: Johnson, SCI’s warden, explained while in one shift one woman may arrive, in\n\nanother six may arrive during an eight-hour period, and that while it is typically not a\n\nproblem keeping the female population below the maximum supportable by SCI,\n\n“especially with our sort of 24-hour window,” “the problem would be is if we got eight\n\n2\n  Because, as will be seen, we conclude that the challenged practice passes intermediate\nscrutiny, we need not reach whether Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), under which\n“a [prison] regulation [restricting constitutional rights] passes muster if it is reasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests,” applies. Fraise v. Terhune, 283 F.3d 506, 513\n(3d Cir. 2002). But cf. DeHart v. Horn, 227 F.3d 47, 61 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc)\n(applying Turner to religion-based equal protection claim).\n                                              5\n\fand then two came in together, we wouldn’t have anywhere to put those two.” (App. 57.)\n\nThe 24-hour limit to which SCI generally adheres is not, as Dinote argues, arbitrary, but\n\nis supported by sound gender-neutral reasoning. Finally, even if the introduction of COR\n\nresulted in processing delays over the previous system, Dinote concedes that most\n\nreleases are still processed within 48 hours; the combination of this circumstance with\n\nSCI’s policy does not undermine the direct relationship between that policy and its\n\nobjective.\n\n                                              B.\n\n       Dinote argues that her strip search at Baylor violated the Fourth Amendment\n\nbecause she had been judicially ordered released by that time. As the District Court\n\nconcluded, assuming arguendo a constitutional violation, these defendants cannot be\n\nliable for it. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, state actors are “liable only for their own\n\nunconstitutional conduct” and respondeat superior liability is not permitted. Barkes v.\n\nFirst Corr. Med., Inc., 766 F.3d 307, 316 (3d Cir. 2014). Supervisory liability is available\n\nonly if the supervisor (1) “‘with deliberate indifference to the consequences, established\n\nand maintained a policy, practice or custom which directly caused [the] constitutional\n\nharm,’” or (2) “‘participated in violating the plaintiff’s rights, directed others to violate\n\nthem, or, as the person in charge, had knowledge of and acquiesced’ in the subordinate’s\n\nunconstitutional conduct.” Id. (alteration in original) (citations omitted).\n\n       Dinote does not contend that defendants participated in the search, and the record\n\nindicates that an institution’s policy on strip searches of detainees arriving from other\n\n                                              6\n\finstitutions is set by the receiving institution. Dinote points to no evidence that these\n\ndefendants were involved in establishing or maintaining Baylor’s policy, or that they\n\nissued any direction with respect to the search. She merely alleges that they knew their\n\nactions would lead to searches at Baylor. Specifically, Dinote alleges that McBride knew\n\nabout COR’s alleged processing deficiencies and that she “was aware that this was\n\nregularly causing women to be transferred to [Baylor],” Reply Br. 5, but as support she\n\nrelies on Danberg’s testimony that COR sends processed release paperwork to a\n\ndetainee’s current institution. More than this attenuated relationship is necessary.\n\nEvancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir. 2005) (complaint did “not contain even a\n\nremote suggestion that [defendant] had contemporaneous, personal knowledge of\n\n[plaintiff’s] transfer and acquiesced in it”). Even if Dinote did raise a genuine dispute of\n\nfact as to McBride’s knowledge of transfers, this is still a step removed from knowledge\n\nof an (allegedly) illegal search.\n\n       Moreover, the record contradicts Dinote’s claim that “[d]efendants know that the\n\nDOC strip-search policy causes all women coming to [Baylor] from another institution to\n\nbe strip-searched.” (Appellant’s Br. 24.) Danberg testified that DOC policy requires strip\n\nsearches when personnel have cause to believe an inmate has contraband, when an inmate\n\nleaves an institution and returns after contact with the public (as with, e.g., a court\n\nappearance), and when an inmate is moved into the general population. He also testified,\n\nhowever, that while it was “possible” that Baylor required a strip search of detainees\n\ncoming from other institutions, he “[didn’t] know that,” and the warden at each\n\n                                             7\n\finstitution is responsible for setting the strip search policies at that institution, without the\n\ncommissioner’s review. (App. 70-71.) In short, Dinote was required to point to more than\n\nher own conjecture about the defendants’ knowledge and acquiescence to survive\n\nsummary judgment, and she has not. See Halsey v. Pfeiffer, 750 F.3d 273, 287 (3d Cir.\n\n2014) (inferences premised on speculation or conjecture are insufficient); In re IKON\n\nOffice Solutions, Inc., 277 F.3d 658, 666 (3d Cir. 2002) (allegations alone are insufficient\n\nto withstand summary judgment).3\n\n                                              IV.\n\n         Having rejected Dinote’s claims of error, we will affirm the orders of the District\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Dinote nominally appeals from the denial of her Rule 59(e) motion, but makes no\nargument in support of her position. She has, therefore, abandoned the issue and we need\nnot address it. Kost v. Kozakiewicz, 1 F.3d 176, 182 (3d Cir. 1993). In any event, having\nreviewed the record, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying reconsideration, because Dinote simply reiterated the arguments she made in\nopposing defendants’ motion for summary judgment. N. River Ins. Co. v. CIGNA Reins.\nCo., 52 F.3d 1194, 1218 (3d Cir. 1995) (motion to alter or amend judgment must rely on\nintervening change in law, new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error of law or\nprevent manifest injustice); see also Jang v. Boston Scientific Scimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357,\n367 (3d Cir. 2013) (review of denial of Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion is for abuse of\ndiscretion).\n                                              8\n\f",

This appeal followed.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.

Summary\n\njudgment is proper where “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any\n\nmaterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). We “view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw\n\nall reasonable inferences in that party’s favor.” S.H., 729 F.3d at 256.\n\n                                            III.\n\n                                            A.\n\n       Dinote challenges as a violation of equal protection the practice of transferring\n\nfemale arrestees from SCI to Baylor within 24 hours of their arrival. A successful claim\n\nthat a government practice or policy violates the Equal Protection Clause requires proof\n\nthat the plaintiff “has been treated differently from persons who are similarly situated.”\n\nWilliams v. Morton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783519\"><a href=\"/opinion/783519/james-williams-ishmon-stallworth-v-willis-e-morton-j-blackstone-f-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221 (3d Cir. 2003). Even differential treatment is\n\npermissible, however, if it bears a sufficient nexus to a qualifying governmental interest;\n\nin the case of a gender classification, the state must show that the classification “serves\n\nimportant governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\n\n                                             4\n\fsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” United States v. Virginia,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118056\"><a href=\"/opinion/118056/united-states-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533 (1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).2\n\n       Although Dinote argues that the transfer policy is unsupported by an important\n\ngovernmental objective, she does not dispute that prisoners may constitutionally be\n\nseparated by gender. Her true challenge is to the means used to effectuate that goal; i.e.,\n\nthat SCI transfers women to Baylor, and generally does so within 24 hours. While men\n\ncan stay at SCI until their release, Dinote asserts, women cannot, though SCI could easily\n\nhold women for up to 48 hours. But transferring women, and quickly, to a facility that\n\ncan accommodate them directly accomplishes the goal of providing gender-segregated\n\ninstitutions. See Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110793\"><a href=\"/opinion/110793/mississippi-univ-for-women-v-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725-26 (1982)\n\n(intermediate scrutiny requires “direct, substantial relationship between objective and\n\nmeans” to “assure that the validity of a classification is determined through reasoned\n\nanalysis rather than through the mechanical application of” stereotypes about gender\n\nroles). Dinote ignores the record evidence that the number of women entering SCI can\n\nfluctuate: Johnson, SCI’s warden, explained while in one shift one woman may arrive, in\n\nanother six may arrive during an eight-hour period, and that while it is typically not a\n\nproblem keeping the female population below the maximum supportable by SCI,\n\n“especially with our sort of 24-hour window,” “the problem would be is if we got eight\n\n2\n  Because, as will be seen, we conclude that the challenged practice passes intermediate\nscrutiny, we need not reach whether Turner v.

But cf. DeHart v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770486\"><a href=\"/opinion/770486/robert-perry-dehart-v-martin-horn-commissioner-of-corrections-james-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc)\n(applying Turner to religion-based equal protection claim).\n                                              5\n\fand then two came in together, we wouldn’t have anywhere to put those two.” (App. 57.)\n\nThe 24-hour limit to which SCI generally adheres is not, as Dinote argues, arbitrary, but\n\nis supported by sound gender-neutral reasoning. Finally, even if the introduction of COR\n\nresulted in processing delays over the previous system, Dinote concedes that most\n\nreleases are still processed within 48 hours; the combination of this circumstance with\n\nSCI’s policy does not undermine the direct relationship between that policy and its\n\nobjective.\n\n                                              B.\n\n       Dinote argues that her strip search at Baylor violated the Fourth Amendment\n\nbecause she had been judicially ordered released by that time. As the District Court\n\nconcluded, assuming arguendo a constitutional violation, these defendants cannot be\n\nliable for it. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, state actors are “liable only for their own\n\nunconstitutional conduct” and respondeat superior liability is not permitted. Barkes v.\n\nFirst Corr. Med., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316 (3d Cir. 2014). Supervisory liability is available\n\nonly if the supervisor (1) “‘with deliberate indifference to the consequences, established\n\nand maintained a policy, practice or custom which directly caused [the] constitutional\n\nharm,’” or (2) “‘participated in violating the plaintiff’s rights, directed others to violate\n\nthem, or, as the person in charge, had knowledge of and acquiesced’ in the subordinate’s\n\nunconstitutional conduct.” Id. (alteration in original) (citations omitted).\n\n       Dinote does not contend that defendants participated in the search, and the record\n\nindicates that an institution’s policy on strip searches of detainees arriving from other\n\n                                              6\n\finstitutions is set by the receiving institution. Dinote points to no evidence that these\n\ndefendants were involved in establishing or maintaining Baylor’s policy, or that they\n\nissued any direction with respect to the search. She merely alleges that they knew their\n\nactions would lead to searches at Baylor. Specifically, Dinote alleges that McBride knew\n\nabout COR’s alleged processing deficiencies and that she “was aware that this was\n\nregularly causing women to be transferred to [Baylor],” Reply Br. 5, but as support she\n\nrelies on Danberg’s testimony that COR sends processed release paperwork to a\n\ndetainee’s current institution. More than this attenuated relationship is necessary.\n\nEvancho v. Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791886\"><a href=\"/opinion/791886/karen-e-evancho-v-d-michael-fisher-attorney-general-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 353 (3d Cir. 2005) (complaint did “not contain even a\n\nremote suggestion that [defendant] had contemporaneous, personal knowledge of\n\n[plaintiff’s] transfer and acquiesced in it”). Even if Dinote did raise a genuine dispute of\n\nfact as to McBride’s knowledge of transfers, this is still a step removed from knowledge\n\nof an (allegedly) illegal search.\n\n       Moreover, the record contradicts Dinote’s claim that “[d]efendants know that the\n\nDOC strip-search policy causes all women coming to [Baylor] from another institution to\n\nbe strip-searched.” (Appellant’s Br. 24.) Danberg testified that DOC policy requires strip\n\nsearches when personnel have cause to believe an inmate has contraband, when an inmate\n\nleaves an institution and returns after contact with the public (as with, e.g., a court\n\nappearance), and when an inmate is moved into the general population. He also testified,\n\nhowever, that while it was “possible” that Baylor required a strip search of detainees\n\ncoming from other institutions, he “[didn’t] know that,” and the warden at each\n\n                                             7\n\finstitution is responsible for setting the strip search policies at that institution, without the\n\ncommissioner’s review. (App. 70-71.) In short, Dinote was required to point to more than\n\nher own conjecture about the defendants’ knowledge and acquiescence to survive\n\nsummary judgment, and she has not. See Halsey v. Pfeiffer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 287 (3d Cir.\n\n2014) (inferences premised on speculation or conjecture are insufficient); In re IKON\n\nOffice Solutions, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (3d Cir. 2002) (allegations alone are insufficient\n\nto withstand summary judgment).3\n\n                                              IV.\n\n         Having rejected Dinote’s claims of error, we will affirm the orders of the District\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Dinote nominally appeals from the denial of her Rule 59(e) motion, but makes no\nargument in support of her position. She has, therefore, abandoned the issue and we need\nnot address it. Kost v.

In any event, having\nreviewed the record, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying reconsideration, because Dinote simply reiterated the arguments she made in\nopposing defendants’ motion for summary judgment.
