See Act of May 16, 2011, 82d Leg., R.S., ch. 123, 2011 Tex. Gen.\nLaws 619. Plaintiffs filed suit challenging the constitutionality and legality of\nthe law.     The district court held that SB 14 was enacted with a racially\ndiscriminatory purpose, has a racially discriminatory effect, is a poll tax, and\nunconstitutionally burdens the right to vote. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp.\n3d 627, 633 (S.D. Tex. 2014). The State appealed from that decision, and a\npanel of our court affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded the case for\nfurther findings. See Veasey v. Abbott, 796 F.3d 487, 493 (5th Cir. 2015), reh’g\nen banc granted, 815 F.3d 958 (5th Cir. 2016). The State filed a petition for\nthis court to rehear the case en banc, which we granted.\n\n\n       1  Part II.A.1 as written represents the opinion of a plurality of the court. However, a\nmajority of the court agrees that there are infirmities in the district court’s opinion regarding\nPlaintiffs’ discriminatory purpose claim, requiring reversal of the district court’s judgment\nthat SB 14 was passed with a racially discriminatory purpose. A majority of the court also\nagrees that, given the court’s decision to reverse the district court’s judgment as to this claim,\nthe court should remand to the district court with instructions to reweigh the evidence in\nlight of this opinion.\n                                                3\n\f     Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 4     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n                                      I. Background\nA. Senate Bill 14\n       Prior to the implementation of SB 14, a Texas voter could cast a ballot in\nperson by presenting a registration certificate—a document mailed to voters\nupon registration. TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 13.142, 63.001(b) (West 2010). Voters\nappearing without the certificate could cast a ballot by signing an affidavit and\npresenting one of multiple forms of identification (“ID”), including a current or\nexpired driver’s license, a photo ID (including employee or student IDs), a\nutility bill, a bank statement, a paycheck, a government document showing the\nvoter’s name and address, or mail addressed to the voter from a government\nagency. Id. §§ 63.001, 63.0101 (West 2010).\n       With the implementation of SB 14, Texas began requiring voters to\npresent certain specific forms of identification at the polls. These include: (1) a\nTexas driver’s license or personal identification card issued by the Department\nof Public Safety (“DPS”) that has not been expired for more than 60 days; (2) a\nU.S. military identification card with a photograph that has not been expired\nfor more than 60 days; (3) a U.S. citizenship certificate with a photo; (4) a U.S.\npassport that has not been expired for more than 60 days; (5) a license to carry\na concealed handgun issued by DPS that has not been expired for more than\n60 days; or (6) an Election Identification Certificate (“EIC”) issued by DPS that\nhas not been expired for more than 60 days. 2 TEX. ELEC. CODE § 63.0101 (West\nSupp. 2014). 3\n\n\n       2   We refer to these required forms of identification under SB 14 as “SB 14 ID.”\n       3  SB 14 also requires the name on the photo ID to be “substantially similar” to the\nvoter’s registered name. TEX. ELEC. CODE § 63.001(c) (West Supp. 2014). If the names are\nnot identical but are substantially similar, the voter must sign an affidavit that the voter and\nthe registered voter are one and the same. Id. If the names are not substantially similar,\nthe voter may submit a provisional ballot and within six days must go to the county registrar\n                                               4\n\f     Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530           Page: 5     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       SB 14 states that DPS “may not collect a fee for an [EIC] or a duplicate\n[EIC],” TEX. TRANSP. CODE § 521A.001(b) (West 2013), and allows DPS to\npromulgate rules for obtaining an EIC, id. § 521A.001(f); § 521.142. To receive\nan EIC, DPS rules require a registered voter to present either: (A) one form of\nprimary ID, (B) two forms of secondary ID, or (C) one form of secondary ID and\ntwo pieces of supporting identification. 37 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 15.182(1).\nThus, any application for an EIC requires either one Texas driver’s license or\npersonal identification card that has been expired for less than two years, or\none of the following documents, accompanied by two forms of supporting\nidentification: (1) an original or certified copy of a birth certificate from the\nappropriate state agency; (2) an original or certified copy of a United States\nDepartment of State Certification of Birth for a U.S. citizen born abroad;\n(3) U.S. citizenship or naturalization papers without a photo; or (4) an original\nor certified copy of a court order containing the person’s name and date of birth\nand indicating an official change of name and/or gender. Id. § 15.182(3). 4\n       Before May 27, 2015, a statutory provision distinct from SB 14 imposed\na $2 or $3 fee for a certified copy of a birth certificate. 5 TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY\n\n\n\nwith additional ID to verify his or her identity. Id. §§ 63.001(g), 63.011, 65.0541(a) (West\nSupp. 2014).\n       4  Among the forms of supporting identification are: voter registration cards, school\nrecords, insurance policies that are at least two years old, identification cards or driver’s\nlicenses issued by another state that have not been expired for more than two years, Texas\nvehicle or boat titles or registrations, military records, Social Security cards, W-2 forms,\nexpired Texas driver’s licenses, government agency ID cards, unexpired military dependent\nidentification cards, Texas or federal parole or mandatory release forms, federal inmate ID\ncards, Medicare or Medicaid cards, immunization records, tribal membership cards from\nfederally recognized tribes, and Veteran’s Administration cards. 37 TEX. ADMIN. CODE\n§ 15.182(4).\n       5  The Department of State Health Services (“DSHS”) waived most of the fees for\nobtaining a birth certificate to get an EIC, but this provision separately required the Bureau\nof Vital Statistics, local registrars, and county clerks to collect a $2 fee for the issuance of a\n                                                5\n\f     Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 6      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nCODE § 191.0045 (West 2010). As discussed below, after the district court\nissued its judgment and the panel conducted oral argument in this case, the\nTexas Legislature passed Senate Bill 983 during the 2015 legislative session\nand eliminated this fee.\n       Persons who have a disability are exempt from SB 14’s photo ID\nrequirement if they are able to provide the voter registrar with documentation\nof their disability from the U.S. Social Security Administration or Department\nof Veterans Affairs. TEX. ELEC. CODE § 13.002(i) (West Supp. 2014). Other\npersons may vote by provisional ballot without a photo ID if they file affidavits\neither asserting a religious objection to being photographed or asserting that\ntheir SB 14 ID was lost or destroyed as a result of a natural disaster occurring\nwithin 45 days of casting a ballot. Id. § 65.054. Additionally, voters who will\nbe 65 or older as of the date of the election may vote early by mail. Id. § 82.003.\n       If a voter is unable to provide SB 14 ID at the poll, the voter can cast a\nprovisional ballot after executing an affidavit stating that the voter is\nregistered and eligible to vote. Id. § 63.001(a), (g). The vote counts if the voter\nproduces SB 14 ID to the county registrar within six days of the election. Id.\n§ 65.0541.\n       SB 14 requires county registrars to inform applicants of the new voter\nID requirements when issuing voter registration certificates, id. § 15.005, and\nrequires both the Secretary of State and voter registrar of each county with a\nwebsite to post SB 14’s requirements online.                     Id.     § 31.012(a).       The\nrequirements must also be placed prominently at polling places. Id. § 62.016.\nAdditionally, the Secretary of State must “conduct a statewide effort to educate\n\n\n\ncertified copy of a birth certificate, and permitted local registrars and county clerks to impose\nan additional $1 fee. TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 191.0045(d), (e), (h) (West 2010).\n                                               6\n\f     Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 7     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nvoters regarding the identification requirements for voting.” Id. § 31.012(b).\nThe district court found that SB 14 allocated a one-time expenditure of $2\nmillion for voter education. 6 Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 649.\nB. Procedural History\n       The State began enforcing SB 14 on June 25, 2013. 7 The plaintiffs and\nintervenors 8 (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed suit against Defendants to enjoin\nenforcement of SB 14, and their suits were consolidated before one federal\ndistrict court in the Southern District of Texas. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp.\n3d at 632. Plaintiffs claim that SB 14’s photo identification requirements\nviolate the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because SB 14 was enacted\nwith a racially discriminatory purpose and has a racially discriminatory effect.\nPlaintiffs also claim that SB 14’s photo ID requirement places a substantial\n\n\n       6The district court also found that one-quarter of the $2 million was earmarked to\nresearch what type of voter education was needed. Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 649.\n       7 A three-judge district court declined to grant judicial preclearance to override the\nUnited States Attorney General’s denial of preclearance. See Texas v. Holder, 888 F. Supp.\n2d 113, 144–45 (D.D.C. 2012), vacated and remanded, 133 S. Ct. 2886 (2013). The Supreme\nCourt vacated and remanded this decision when it issued Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct.\n2612 (2013), which held unconstitutional the coverage formula in Section 4(b) used to\ndetermine which jurisdictions were subject to the preclearance requirement in Section 5 of\nthe Voting Rights Act. Thereafter, Texas began enforcing SB 14.\n       8  Plaintiff-Intervenor Texas League of Young Voters Education Fund (the “Texas\nLeague”) was non-operational when the panel opinion was issued and remained so at least\nat the time the supplemental en banc briefs were filed in this case. “A claim becomes moot\nwhen ‘the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.’” Nat’l Rifle Ass’n of Am.,\nInc. v. McCraw, 719 F.3d 338, 344 n.3 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Powell v. McCormack, 395\nU.S. 486, 496 (1969)). The Texas League argues that it nonetheless has standing because\nmany of the Texas voters whose inability to obtain SB 14 ID gave rise to the Texas League’s\nstanding remain disenfranchised by SB 14. Because other Plaintiffs have standing to\nchallenge SB 14 and because the court’s remedy will reach all voters who do not have or\ncannot reasonably obtain SB 14 ID (regardless of their membership in the Texas League), we\nneed not separately address the Texas League’s standing. See Nat’l Rifle Ass’n, 719 F.3d at\n344 n.3 (“Only one of the petitioners needs to have standing to permit us to consider the\npetition for review.”).\n                                               7\n\f     Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 8     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nburden on the fundamental right to vote under the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments, and constitutes a poll tax under the Fourteenth and Twenty-\nFourth Amendments. The State defends SB 14 as a constitutional requirement\nimposed to prevent in-person voter fraud and increase voter confidence and\nturnout.\n       The district court conducted a nine-day bench trial at which dozens of\nexpert and lay witnesses testified by deposition or in person. Following that\nbench trial, the district court issued a lengthy and comprehensive opinion\nholding:\n       SB 14 creates an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote\n       [under the First and Fourteenth Amendments], has an\n       impermissible discriminatory effect against Hispanics and\n       African–Americans [under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act], and\n       was imposed with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose [in\n       violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and\n       Section 2]. [Furthermore,] SB 14 constitutes an unconstitutional\n       poll tax [under the Fourteenth and Twenty-Fourth Amendments].\nVeasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 633. Shortly before in-person early voting\nwas scheduled to begin for the November 2014 elections, the district court\n“enter[ed] a permanent and final injunction against enforcement of the voter\nidentification provisions [of SB 14], Sections 1 through 15 and 17 through 22.” 9\nId. at 707 & n.583. Since it struck the State’s voter ID law so close to the\nimpending November 2014 election, the district court ordered the State to\n“return to enforcing the voter identification requirements for in-person voting\n\n\n       9  The district court did not enjoin enforcement of sections 16, 23, and 24 in accordance\nwith SB 14’s severability clause. Sections 16 and 23 relate to increasing the penalties and\noffense levels for election code violations. See TEX. ELEC. CODE § 64.012 historical note (West\n2010 & Supp. 2014) [Act of May 16, 2011, 82d Leg., R.S., ch. 123, §§ 16, 23, 2011 Tex. Gen.\nLaws 619, 623, 625]. Section 24 has expired, but once related to the purposes for which the\nvoter registrars could use certain funds disbursed under the election code. See Act of May\n16, 2011, 82d Leg., R.S., ch. 123, § 24, 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 619.\n                                               8\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 9    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nin effect immediately prior to the enactment and implementation of SB 14.”\nId. at 707. The district court retained jurisdiction to review any remedial\nlegislation and to pre-approve any administrative remedial measures. Id. at\n707–08.\n      In October 2014, the State appealed the district court’s final judgment,\nand a panel of this court granted the State’s emergency motion for stay pending\nappeal, grounding its decision primarily in “the importance of maintaining the\nstatus quo on the eve of an election.” Veasey v. Perry, 769 F.3d 890, 895 (5th\nCir. 2014).   Plaintiffs filed emergency motions before the Supreme Court,\nseeking to have this court’s stay vacated. The Supreme Court denied these\nmotions to vacate the stay of the district court’s judgment. See Veasey v. Perry,\n135 S. Ct. 9 (2014). Therefore, this court’s stay of the district court’s injunction\nremained in place, and SB 14 continues to be enforced.\n      On May 27, 2015, after oral argument was heard by the panel that\ninitially considered this appeal, Senate Bill 983 (“SB 983”) was signed into law,\neliminating the fee “associated with searching for or providing a record,\nincluding a certified copy of a birth record, if the applicant [for the record]\nstates that the applicant is requesting the record for the purpose of obtaining\nan election identification certificate.” Act of May 25, 2015, 84th Leg., R.S., ch.\n130, 2015 Tex. Sess. Laws Serv. Ch. 130 (codified as an amendment to TEX.\nHEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 191.0046(e)) (hereinafter “SB 983”). SB 983 became\neffective immediately. Id. §§ 2–3 (codified as note to TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY\nCODE § 191.0046); see also S.J. of Tex., 84th Leg., R.S., 1449–50 (2015)\n(reporting unanimous passage out of the Texas Senate); H.J. of Tex., 84th Leg.,\nR.S., 4478–79 (2015) (reporting passage by 142 to 0, with one member absent,\nin the Texas House). SB 983 provides that “a local registrar or county clerk\nwho issues a birth record” required for an EIC that would otherwise be entitled\n                                         9\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 10     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nto collect a fee for that record “is entitled to payment of the amount from the\n[D]epartment [of State Health Services].” Act of May 25, 2015, 84th Leg., R.S.,\nch. 130 (codified as an amendment to TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE\n§ 191.0046(f)). SB 983 did not appropriate funds to spread public awareness\nabout the free birth records. The parties addressed the potential effect of SB\n983 on their claims before both the panel and our full court, and we have\naccounted for its passage. 10\n       Considering the State’s appeal from the district court’s judgment, the\npanel opinion held that the district court committed legal errors in conducting\nits discriminatory purpose analysis; therefore, it vacated that portion of the\ndistrict court’s opinion and remanded the case for further proceedings. See\nVeasey, 796 F.3d at 493, 498. Noting that the finding on remand might be\ndifferent, the panel opinion addressed the Plaintiffs’ other claims. Id. at 493.\nIt affirmed the district court’s finding that SB 14 has a discriminatory effect in\nviolation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and remanded for consideration\nof the proper remedy. Id. It vacated the district court’s holding that SB 14\nconstitutes a poll tax and rendered judgment on that claim for the State. Id.\nFinally, the panel opinion vacated the district court’s determination that SB\n\n\n\n       10 The parties also filed Rule 28(j) letters before the panel that initially heard this\ncase. The parties noted the passage of SB 1934, effective on September 1, 2015, which\nprovides that state-issued identification cards issued to individuals age 60 and older expire\non a date to be specified by DPS. Act of May 29, 2015, 84th Leg., R.S., S.B. 1934 (codified as\nan amendment to TEX. TRANSP. CODE § 521.101(f)(1)). Before this new law, ID cards for those\n60 and older did not expire. 37 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 15.30. While Plaintiffs contended before\nthe panel initially considering this case that SB 1934 will exacerbate the discriminatory effect\nof SB 14, the State insisted SB 1934 was passed merely to comply with the federal REAL ID\nAct. See 6 C.F.R. § 37.5(a). The panel opinion concluded that this issue is not yet ripe for our\nreview. See Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (“A claim is not ripe for\nadjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or\nindeed may not occur at all.” (citation omitted)). The parties have not raised this issue again\nbefore our full court.\n                                              10\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 11   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\n14 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution,\npursuant to the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, and dismissed those\nclaims. Id.\n      While this case was awaiting oral argument before our full court, in light\nof the upcoming elections in November 2016, the parties applied to the\nSupreme Court to vacate the stay of the district court’s injunction that a panel\nof this court originally entered in October 2014. The Supreme Court denied\nthe motion to vacate the stay but noted that if, by July 20, 2016, this court had\n“neither issued an opinion on the merits of the case nor issued an order\nvacating or modifying the current stay order, an aggrieved party [could] seek\ninterim relief from th[e Supreme] Court by filing an appropriate application.”\nVeasey v. Abbott, 136 S. Ct. 1823 (2016).\n                      II. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act\nA. Discriminatory Purpose\n      The State appeals the district court’s holding that SB 14 was passed with\na discriminatory purpose in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\nAmendments and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.             We review this\ndetermination for clear error. “If the district court’s findings are plausible in\nlight of the record viewed in its entirety, we must accept them, even though we\nmight have weighed the evidence differently if we had been sitting as a trier of\nfact.” Price v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 945 F.2d 1307, 1312 (5th Cir. 1991)\n(citation omitted). However, when the district court’s “findings are infirm\nbecause of an erroneous view of the law, a remand is the proper course unless\nthe record permits only one resolution of the factual issue,” Pullman-Standard\nv. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 292 (1982), in which case reversing and rendering is\nthe proper course, Meche v. Doucet, 777 F.3d 237, 246–47 (5th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 136 S. Ct. 111 (2015).\n                                       11\n\f    Case: 14-41127         Document: 00513601530            Page: 12      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                          No. 14-41127\n       We apply the framework articulated in Village of Arlington Heights v.\nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–68 (1977), to\ndetermine whether SB 14 was passed with a discriminatory purpose. Although\nthe district court properly cited the Arlington Heights framework, we conclude\nthat some “findings are infirm,” necessitating a remand on this point.\nPullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at 292. Since the record does not “permit[] only\none resolution of the factual issue,” and there is evidence that could support\nthe district court’s finding of discriminatory purpose, we must remand for a re-\nweighing of the evidence. 11 See id.\n       1. Legal Errors in the District Court’s Analysis\n       “Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265.\nHowever, “[r]acial discrimination need only be one purpose, and not even a\nprimary purpose,” of an official action for a violation to occur. United States v.\nBrown, 561 F.3d 420, 433 (5th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).                          “Legislative\nmotivation or intent is a paradigmatic fact question.” Prejean v. Foster, 227\nF.3d 504, 509 (5th Cir. 2000) (citing Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 549\n(1999)). “Proving the motivation behind official action is often a problematic\nundertaking.” Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 228 (1985).\n\n\n\n\n       11  One of the dissenting opinions suggests that the majority opinion flouts the canon\nof constitutional avoidance by reaching the discriminatory purpose claim. We recognize the\ncanon of constitutional avoidance, and where possible, we have avoided reaching\nconstitutional claims unnecessarily, see infra Parts III and IV. However, we cannot avoid\nruling on the discriminatory intent claim here, where the remedy to which Plaintiffs would\nbe entitled for a discriminatory intent violation is potentially broader than the remedy the\ndistrict court may fashion for the discriminatory impact violation. See City of Richmond v.\nUnited States, 422 U.S. 358, 378 (1975) (holding, in the discriminatory purpose context, that\n“[a]n official action . . . taken for the purpose of discriminating . . . on account of . . . race has\nno legitimacy at all”).\n                                                 12\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530           Page: 13      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       In Arlington Heights, the Supreme Court set out five nonexhaustive\nfactors to determine whether a particular decision was made with a\ndiscriminatory purpose, 12 and courts must perform a “sensitive inquiry into\nsuch circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.” 13 See\n429 U.S. at 266–68. “Those factors include: (1) the historical background of the\ndecision, (2) the specific sequence of events leading up to the decision,\n(3) departures from the normal procedural sequence, (4) substantive\ndepartures,      and     (5) legislative     history,     especially     where      there    are\ncontemporary statements by members of the decision-making body.” Overton\n\n\n\n       12  The State argues that, instead of applying the Arlington Heights standard, we\nshould apply a “clearest proof” standard grafted from cases involving the determination of\nwhether a legislature meant to impose criminal punishment through a civil law when the\nlaw faces an ex post facto challenge. See, e.g., Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 92–93 (2003); Kansas\nv. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 360–61 (1997); Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 613, 617–20\n(1960). In those cases, courts deferred to legislatures’ categorizations of laws as “civil” except\nupon “the clearest proof” that the laws were “so punitive either in purpose or effect as to\nnegate” the “civil” label. Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 361 (citation omitted). The Supreme Court\nhas not applied this standard in the voting rights context. See generally Arlington Heights,\n429 U.S. 252; Hunter, 471 U.S. 222; cf. Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979);\nLodge v. Buxton, 639 F.2d 1358 (5th Cir. Unit B Mar. 1981). Instead, we have noted that\ndiscriminatory intent in this context may be shown through circumstantial evidence, as\ndiscriminatory motives are often “cleverly cloaked in the guise of propriety.” Lodge, 639 F.2d\nat 1363. We decline to apply the State’s proposed standard in this context.\n       13 Neither Arlington Heights nor our decision in Price, 945 F.2d 1307, requires direct\nevidence. The district court here allowed extensive discovery of legislative materials which\ndid not yield a “smoking gun.” The district court could have found, but was not required to\nfind, that this lack of a smoking gun supports the State’s position here. That was the\nsituation that we addressed in Price, and in that case we found no clear error in the district\ncourt’s decisions about what evidence to credit. As the district court explained here, SB 14’s\nproponents knew at the time that SB 14 would be subject to the preclearance requirement,\nVeasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 658, 701, so the lack of a smoking gun is not surprising.\nThe latter point makes it even more important that Price noted direct evidence would be\nstronger than circumstantial evidence, but only “[t]o the extent that the justifications\nadvanced in [legislators’] testimon[ies] do not demonstrate a pretext for intentionally\ndiscriminatory actions.” Price, 945 F.2d at 1318. As we note herein, we conclude there is\nevidence that could support a finding that the Legislature’s justification of ballot integrity\nwas pretextual in relation to the specific, stringent provisions of SB 14.\n                                               13\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 14   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nv. City of Austin, 871 F.2d 529, 540 (5th Cir. 1989) (citing Arlington Heights,\n429 U.S. at 267–68). Legislators’ awareness of a disparate impact on a\nprotected group is not enough: the law must be passed because of that disparate\nimpact.     Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979).         The\nchallengers bear the burden to show that racial discrimination was a\n“‘substantial’ or ‘motivating’ factor behind enactment of the law”; if they meet\nthat burden, “the burden shifts to the law’s defenders to demonstrate that the\nlaw would have been enacted without this factor.” Hunter, 471 U.S. at 228\n(citation omitted).\n        The State’s stated purpose in passing SB 14 centered on protection of the\nsanctity of voting, avoiding voter fraud, and promoting public confidence in the\nvoting process. No one questions the legitimacy of these concerns as motives.\nThe disagreement centers on whether SB 14 was passed with impermissible\nmotives as well. We recognize that evaluating motive, particularly the motive\nof dozens of people, is a difficult enterprise. We acknowledge the charged\nnature of accusations of racism, particularly against a legislative body, but we\nmust also face the sad truth that racism continues to exist in our modern\nAmerican society despite years of laws designed to eradicate it. We appreciate\nthe district court’s efforts to address this difficult inquiry. Nonetheless, we\nhold that much of the evidence upon which the district court relied was\n“infirm.” See Pullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at 292.\n        One type of evidence on which the district court relied in seeking to\ndiscern the Legislature’s intent was Texas’s history of enacting racially\ndiscriminatory voting measures. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 633–\n36. It noted, for instance, Texas’s use of all-white primaries from 1895–1944,\nliteracy tests and secret ballots from 1905–1970, and poll taxes from 1902–\n1966.     Id. at 634–35.   While the record also contains more contemporary\n                                        14\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 15      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nexamples, see id. at 635, 636 & n.23, the district court relied too heavily on the\nevidence of State-sponsored discrimination dating back hundreds of years, cf.\nShelby Cty. v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2628 (2013) (noting that “history did not\nend in 1965”).\n       “The historical background of the decision is one evidentiary source,\nparticularly if it reveals a series of official actions taken for invidious\npurposes,” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267, but the Supreme Court has\ncautioned that “unless historical evidence is reasonably contemporaneous with\nthe challenged decision, it has little probative value,” McCleskey v. Kemp, 481\nU.S. 279, 298 n.20 (1987) (resolving that laws in force during and just after the\nCivil War were not probative of the legislature’s intent many years later).\nMore recently, the Court in Shelby County also counseled against undue\nreliance on noncontemporary evidence of discrimination in the voting rights\ncontext. 133 S. Ct. at 2618–19, 2631 (striking down Section 4(b) of the Voting\nRights Act because “the conditions that originally justified these measures no\nlonger characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions”). In light of these cases,\nthe most relevant “historical” evidence is relatively recent history, not long-\npast history. 14 We recognize that history provides context and that historical\ndiscrimination (for example, in education) can have effects for many years.\nBut, given the case law we describe above and the specific issue in this case,\nwe conclude that the district court’s disproportionate reliance on long-ago\nhistory was error.\n\n\n\n\n       14  “Relatively recent” does not mean immediately contemporaneous. Shelby County\nemphasized that “things have changed” since the 1965 passage of the Voting Rights Act, 133\nS. Ct. at 2625, but it did not articulate a particular time limit, see id. at 2625–27. Nor do we.\nSuffice it to say the closer in time, the greater the relevance, while always recognizing that\nhistory (even “long-ago history”) provides context to modern-day events.\n                                              15\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 16   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n      We also recognize that not all “history” was “long ago” and that there\nwere some more contemporary examples of discrimination identified by the\nPlaintiffs in the district court. The evidence of relatively recent discrimination\ncited by the district court is more probative of discriminatory intent. See, e.g.,\nVeasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 635, 636 & n.23. Nonetheless, several of the\nrelatively contemporary examples of discrimination identified by the district\ncourt are limited in their probative value in connection with discerning the\nTexas Legislature’s intent. For example, in a state with 254 counties, we do\nnot find the reprehensible actions of county officials in one county (Waller\nCounty) to make voting more difficult for minorities to be probative of the\nintent of legislators in the Texas Legislature, which consists of representatives\nand senators from across a geographically vast, highly populous, and very\ndiverse state.   See Miss. State Chapter, Operation Push, Inc. v. Mabus\n(Operation Push), 932 F.2d 400, 409–10 (5th Cir. 1991) (stating that “[e]vidence\nof disparate registration rates or similar registration rates in individual\ncounties could not provide dispositive support” for the claim that plaintiffs\ncould not participate in the political process at the state level (emphasis\nadded)).\n      Additionally, the district court relied on contemporary examples of\nstatewide discrimination evidenced by two redistricting cases that, taken\nalone, form a thin basis for drawing conclusions regarding contemporary State-\nsponsored discrimination. The first, Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 976 (1996),\nfound that a Texas redistricting plan to create three majority-minority districts\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because\nrace was the predominant factor, the plans ignored traditional redistricting\ncriteria, and their shapes could only be explained as the product of\nunconstitutional racial gerrymandering. The second case found voter dilution\n                                       16\n\f    Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530        Page: 17     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-41127\naffecting Hispanics in the redrawing of one congressional district. See League\nof Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry (LULAC), 548 U.S. 399, 439–40 (2006). Although\nciting discussions of the historic discrimination against Hispanics in Texas, the\nCourt did not base its decision on a conclusion that the legislature intentionally\ndiscriminated based upon ethnicity. Id. at 440–42.               Instead, it looked at\nhistory as a context for the disenfranchisement of voters who had grown\ndisaffected with the Hispanic Congressman the legislature sought to protect\nby its redrawing of the district. Id. at 438–41. The Court did not find any vote\ndilution as to African Americans in the drawing of a different district. Id. at\n444. Thus, these cases do not lend support for a finding of “relatively recent”\ndiscrimination. 15\n      The district court’s reliance on post-enactment speculation by opponents\nof SB 14 was also misplaced. Discerning the intent of a decisionmaking body\nis difficult and problematic.      Hunter, 471 U.S. at 228. To aid in this task,\ncourts may evaluate “contemporary statements by members of the\ndecisionmaking body, minutes of its meetings, or reports.                      In some\nextraordinary instances the members might be called to the stand at trial to\ntestify concerning the purpose of the official action . . . .” Arlington Heights,\n429 U.S. at 268. Where the court is asked to identify the intent of an entire\nstate legislature, as opposed to a smaller body, the charge becomes\nproportionately more challenging. Hunter, 471 U.S. at 228. As United States\nv. O’Brien explains:\n\n\n\n\n      15  Nonetheless, as discussed infra note 28, the Court’s conclusion in LULAC that\nTexas’s 2003 redistricting plan violated the Voting Rights Act does evidence a history of\ndiscrimination that is relevant to our discriminatory effect analysis, because historical\ninstances of discrimination continue to produce socioeconomic conditions that the district\ncourt found contributed to the racial disparities in ID possession.\n                                           17\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530        Page: 18     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\n       Inquiries into congressional motives or purposes are a hazardous\n       matter. When the issue is simply the interpretation of legislation,\n       the Court will look to statements by legislators for guidance as to\n       the purpose of the legislature, because the benefit to sound\n       decision-making in this circumstance is thought sufficient to risk\n       the possibility of misreading Congress’ purpose. It is entirely a\n       different matter when we are asked to void a statute that is, under\n       well-settled criteria, constitutional on its face, on the basis of what\n       fewer than a handful of Congressmen said about it. What\n       motivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not\n       necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it, and the\n       stakes are sufficiently high for us to eschew guesswork.\n391 U.S. 367, 383–84 (1968) (footnote omitted).\n       To ascertain the Texas Legislature’s purpose in passing SB 14, the\ndistrict court mistakenly relied in part on speculation by the bill’s opponents\nabout proponents’ motives (rather than evidence of their statements and\nactions). For instance, it credited the following: Representative Hernandez-\nLuna’s simple assertion that two city council seats in Pasadena, Texas were\nmade into at-large seats “in order to dilute the Hispanic vote and\nrepresentation”; repeated testimony that the 2011 session was imbued with\nanti-immigrant sentiment; 16 and testimony by the bill’s opponents that they\nbelieved the law was passed with a discriminatory purpose. Veasey v. Perry,\n71 F. Supp. 3d at 637, 655–57.\n       “The Supreme Court has . . . repeatedly cautioned—in the analogous\ncontext of statutory construction—against placing too much emphasis on the\ncontemporaneous views of a bill’s opponents.” 17 Butts v. City of New York, 779\n\n\n       16   The relevance of this evidence apparently rests partially upon the unsupported\npremise that a legislator concerned about border security or opposed to the entry into Texas\nof undocumented immigrants is also necessarily in favor of suppressing voting by American\ncitizens of color.\n       17  Here, the problematic evidence is the speculation and conclusions of the opposing\nlegislators. We are not suggesting that the bill opponents lack credibility because they are\n                                            18\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 19     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nF.2d 141, 147 (2d Cir. 1985) (citing, inter alia, Ernst & Ernst v.

Reserve\nSys., 638 F.2d 1255, 1263 (5th Cir. Unit A Feb. 1981). The Second Circuit\nconsidered such speculation in Butts and held that “the speculations and\naccusations of . . . [a] few opponents simply do not support an inference of the\nkind of racial animus discussed in, for example, Arlington Heights.” 779 F.2d\nat 147 (citation omitted). We agree and conclude that the district court erred\nin relying on conjecture by the opponents of SB 14 as to the motivations of\nthose legislators supporting the law. 18\n       The district court also placed inappropriate reliance upon the type of\npost-enactment testimony which courts routinely disregard as unreliable. See\nBarber v. Thomas, 560 U.S. 474, 486 (2010) (“And whatever interpretive force\none attaches to legislative history, the Court normally gives little weight to\nstatements, such as those of the individual legislators, made after the bill in\nquestion has become law.”); see also Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 596\nn.19 (1987) (“The Court has previously found the post-enactment elucidation\nof the meaning of a statute to be of little relevance in determining the intent of\nthe legislature contemporaneous to the passage of the statute.”).                      While\nprobative in theory, even those (after-the-fact) stray statements made by a few\n\n\n\n\nopposing legislators, as credibility is a question for the trier of fact. Testimony found to be\ncredible from opponents of the bill about conduct and statements by proponents would be\nhighly probative. Our point is simply that speculation and conclusory accusations by\nopposing legislators are not an appropriate foundation for a finding of purposeful\ndiscrimination.\n        18 In the different but somewhat analogous realm of employment discrimination, we\n\nhave similarly rejected the plaintiff’s testimony that he or she believed that the motivation\nof his or her employer was racial or other discrimination. See Byers v. Dall. Morning News,\nInc., 209 F.3d 419, 426–27 (5th Cir. 2000).\n                                             19\n\f    Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 20    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nindividual legislators voting for SB 14 may not be the best indicia of the Texas\nLegislature’s intent. See Operation Push, 932 F.2d at 408 (finding “isolated\nand ambiguous statements made by . . . legislators” were not compelling\nevidence of that law’s discriminatory purpose); Jones v. City of Lubbock, 727\nF.2d 364, 371 n.3 (5th Cir. 1984) (refusing to “judge intent from the statements\n[made by] . . . a single member” of the legislative body).\n      Because the district court relied upon evidence we conclude is infirm, the\ndistrict court’s opinion cannot stand as written.     The next question, then, is\nwhether we reverse and render judgment for the State or remand to the district\ncourt with instructions.\n      2. Remand for Re-Weighing of the Evidence\n      While the district court’s analysis contained some legal infirmities, the\nrecord also contained evidence that could support a finding of discriminatory\nintent. See Meche, 777 F.3d at 246–47 (noting in review of a district court’s\nfindings following a bench trial that “[w]here findings are infirm because of an\nerroneous view of the law, a remand is the proper course unless the record\npermits only one resolution of the factual issue”). Therefore, under Pullman-\nStandard, 456 U.S. at 292, we must remand the discriminatory intent issue to\nthe district court to reweigh the factors in light of this opinion.\n      In Pullman-Standard, the Supreme Court reversed a panel of this court\nafter the panel weighed the facts and rendered judgment, rather than\nremanding for further proceedings. Id. at 292–93. The Pullman-Standard\npanel of this court had concluded that the district court erred by not\nconsidering all relevant evidence and suggested that the district court might\nhave reached a different conclusion had it properly considered the evidence.\nId. at 284–85, 292. The Supreme Court admonished that “discriminatory\nintent . . . is a factual matter subject to the clearly-erroneous standard . . .\n                                        20\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 21     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\n[and] when a district court’s finding on such an ultimate fact is set aside for an\nerror of law, the court of appeals is not relieved of the usual requirement of\nremanding for further proceedings to the tribunal charged with the task of\nfactfinding in the first instance.” Id. at 293. The Court expressed concern that\nthis court would ignore such an “elementary” principle and instructed that it\nis not the purview of this court to produce an “independent consideration of the\ntotality of the circumstances.” Id. at 291–92.\n       Pursuant to this clear guidance, our inquiry is whether “the record\npermits of only one resolution of the factual issue.” Id. at 292. We conclude\nthat it does not.\n       First, although the record does not contain direct evidence that the Texas\nLegislature passed SB 14 with a racially invidious purpose, this does not mean\nthere is no evidence that supports a finding of discriminatory intent.\n“[D]iscriminatory intent need not be proved by direct evidence.” Rogers v.\nLodge, 458 U.S. 613, 618 (1982); Brown, 561 F.3d at 433 (“To find\ndiscriminatory intent, direct or indirect circumstantial evidence, including the\nnormal inferences to be drawn from the foreseeability of defendant’s actions\nmay be considered.” (citation omitted)). Instead, courts may consider both\ncircumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available. Arlington\nHeights, 429 U.S. at 266.\n       In this day and age we rarely have legislators announcing an intent to\ndiscriminate based upon race, whether in public speeches or private\ncorrespondence. 19 To require direct evidence of intent would essentially give\n\n\n       19 In fact, in this case, there is evidence that the proponents of SB 14 were careful\nabout what they said and wrote about the purposes of SB 14, knowing it would be challenged\nduring the preclearance process under the Voting Rights Act. Senator Fraser, one of the\nauthors of SB 14, admitted during his deposition that he believed “that the public legislative\nrecord would either go to the Department of Justice or a three-judge panel as part of the\n                                             21\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 22     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nlegislatures free reign to racially discriminate so long as they do not overtly\nstate discrimination as their purpose and so long as they proffer a seemingly\nneutral reason for their actions. This approach would ignore the reality that\nneutral reasons can and do mask racial intent, a fact we have recognized in\nother contexts that allow for circumstantial evidence.\n       For example, in employment discrimination cases, we do not\nautomatically find for an employer who proffers a race-neutral reason for\nterminating an employee; instead, the employee can show that this reason is\npretextual. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 804 (1973)\n(establishing that where an employer has offered a race-neutral reason for an\nadverse employment action, the employee is entitled to show that the\nemployer’s stated reason is in fact pretext); see, e.g., Evans v. City of Houston,\n246 F.3d 344, 354–56 (5th Cir. 2001) (holding that a plaintiff had provided\nsufficient circumstantial evidence that an employer’s reasons for demoting her\nwere pretextual to create a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether\nshe was wrongfully demoted and reversing the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment for the employer). As we were recently reminded in Foster\nv. Chatman, 136 S. Ct. 1737, 1751–52, 1754–55 (2016), people hide\ndiscriminatory intent behind seemingly legitimate reasons. If Jane were fired\nfrom an at-will job for being late once, we might conclude that firing was\nlegitimate, until we learned that Joe, who has the very same job as Jane, was\nlate numerous times with no penalty. Cf. Evans, 246 F.3d at 354–56. Context\n\n\n\n[Voting Rights Act] Section 5 review process,” and that he was therefore “aware that\neverything that [he] was saying was part of a public record.” The Deputy General Counsel\nto the Lieutenant Governor, Bryan Hebert, testified that he sent an email “urg[ing] senators\nto emphasize the detection and deterrence of fraud and protect[ing] public confidence in\nelections” as “the goal” of SB 14, “to remind people what the point of the bill was” for their\nspeeches on the floor of the Texas Senate.\n                                             22\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 23      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nmatters. 20 With this in mind, we now address the circumstantial evidence that\ncould support a finding of discriminatory purpose such that the record does not\npermit of only one resolution of the factual issue of intent. Pullman-Standard,\n456 U.S. at 292.\n       The record shows that drafters and proponents of SB 14 were aware of\nthe likely disproportionate effect of the law on minorities, and that they\nnonetheless passed the bill without adopting a number of proposed\nameliorative measures that might have lessened this impact. For instance, the\nLegislature was advised of the likely discriminatory impact by the Deputy\nGeneral Counsel to the Lieutenant Governor and by many legislators, and such\nimpact was acknowledged to be “common sense” by one of the chief proponents\nof the legislation. 21 See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 657–58.\n       Additionally, although he was careful with his comments about the\nlegislation, one of the authors of SB 14, Senator Fraser, testified that he\n“believe[s] today the Voting Rights Act has outlived its useful life.” When other\nlegislators asked Senator Fraser questions about the possible disparate impact\nof SB 14, he simply replied “I am not advised.” Id. at 646–47. Another senator\nadmitted at his deposition that he and other proponents of SB 14 voted to table\n\n\n       20  Of course, employment discrimination cases are not directly supportive, but they\nare analogous. One of the dissenting opinions points out that the intent of the Legislature\ndiffers from that of an employer because a legislature’s intent is “a pastiche of each individual\nrepresentative’s views, mixed policies and motives.” Jones Dissenting Op. at 5 n.5. But while\neach legislator casts his or her own vote, these votes are often cast in blocs and along party\nlines. Recognition that legislatures, just as employers, may articulate pretextual reasons for\ndiscriminatory actions is not a superficial equation, but rather a realistic acknowledgment.\n        21 Representative Todd Smith, a proponent of the legislation, stated that it was\n\n“common sense” the law would have a disproportionate effect on minorities. Veasey v. Perry,\n71 F. Supp. 3d at 657. Similarly, Bryan Hebert, Deputy General Counsel in the Office of the\nLieutenant Governor, acknowledged that the poor and minorities were most likely to be\naffected by SB 14. Id. Without additional forms of identification, Hebert warned that SB 14\nwas unlikely to obtain (the now-defunct) preclearance under Section 5 of the Voting Rights\nAct. Id. at 658.\n                                              23\n\f    Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530       Page: 24    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nnumerous amendments meant to expand the types of accepted IDs, expand the\noperating hours of DPS stations issuing voter IDs, delay implementation of SB\n14 until an impact study had been completed, and other ameliorative\nmeasures. He and other proponents of SB 14 have largely refused to explain\nthe rejection of those amendments, both at the time and in subsequent\nlitigation. Id. The district court noted that this attitude “was out of character\nfor sponsors of major bills.” Id. at 647.\n      The district court also heard evidence that SB 14 is only tenuously\nrelated to the legislature’s stated purpose of preventing voter fraud.          For\nexample, the record shows that Texas has a history of justifying voter\nsuppression efforts such as the poll tax and literacy tests with the race-neutral\nreason of promoting ballot integrity. See id. at 636 & n.24. Dr. Vernon Burton,\nan expert in race relations, testified about the “history of official discrimination\nin Texas voting.” He identified some devices Texas has used to deny minorities\nthe vote, including “the all[-]White primary, the secret ballot and the use of\nilliteracy[,] . . . poll tax, re-registration and purging.” He testified as follows\nregarding “the stated rationale” for each of these devices:\n            Q     What, in your opinion, was the stated rationale for the\n            enactment of all[-]White primaries in Texas?\n            A     The stated rationale was voter fraud.\n            Q     What was the stated rationale, in your opinion, for the\n            use of secret ballot provisions in Texas?\n            A     The stated rationale was to prevent voter fraud.\n            Q     And what was the stated rationale, in your opinion, for\n            the use of the poll tax in Texas?\n            A     The stated rationale by the State was to prevent voter\n            fraud.\n            Q     And how about the stated rationale for the use in\n            Texas of re-registration requirements and voter purges?\n            A     The stated rationale was voter fraud.\n                                        24\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 25   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\n           Q     Dr. Burton, in your expert opinion, did these devices\n           actually respond to sincere concerns or incidents –\n           incidences of voter fraud?\n           A     No.\n      Here, too, there is evidence that could support a finding that the\nLegislature’s race-neutral reason of ballot integrity offered by the State is\npretextual.    This bill was subjected to radical departures from normal\nprocedures.    Consideration of procedural departures is a difficult inquiry,\nbecause on the one hand, “[d]epartures from the normal procedural\nsequence . . . might afford evidence that improper purposes are playing a role.”\nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267. On the other hand, “objection[s] to typical\naspects of the legislative process in developing legislation,” such as increasing\nthe number of votes a law requires for passage, may not demonstrate an\ninvidious intent, standing alone. Cf. Operation Push, 932 F.2d at 408–09, 408\nn.6. Yet, context matters, and evidence of procedural departures provides one\npotential link in the circumstantial totality of evidence the district court must\nconsider.\n      In this case, for example, the procedural maneuvers employed by the\nTexas Legislature and the State occurred, as the district court notes, only after\nrepeated attempts to pass voter identification bills were blocked through\ncountervailing procedural maneuvers. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at\n645–46.     At the same time, SB 14 was subject to numerous and radical\nprocedural departures that may lend credence to an inference of discriminatory\nintent. See id. at 647–51. These included: (1) getting special permission to file\nthe bill under a low number reserved for the Lieutenant Governor’s legislative\npriorities; (2) Governor Perry’s decision to designate the bill as emergency\nlegislation so that it could be considered during the first sixty days of the\nlegislative session; (3) suspending the two-thirds rule regarding the number of\n                                       25\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530        Page: 26     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nvotes required to make SB 14 a “special order”; (4) allowing the bill to bypass\nthe ordinary committee process in the Texas House and Senate; (5) passing SB\n14 with an unverified $2 million fiscal note despite the prohibition on doing so\nin the 2011 legislative session due to a $27 million budget shortfall; (6) cutting\ndebate short to enable a three-day passage through the Senate; and (7) passing\nresolutions to allow the conference committee to add provisions to SB 14,\ncontrary to the Legislature’s rules and normal practice. See id. at 647–53.\nSuch treatment was virtually unprecedented. 22\n       Texas is a huge state in land mass and population and the Legislature\nfaces great challenges in governing. The Texas Legislature meets for regular\nsessions for less than five months out of every two years. TEX. CONST. art. III,\n§ 24; TEX. GOV’T CODE § 301.001 (West 2013). 23 During the session, it must\npass a balanced budget that will govern until the next session, based on\nprojected revenue for the next two years. TEX. CONST. art. VIII, § 22; id. art.\nIII, § 49a. In recent years, the Legislature has faced many complex and\ncontroversial issues. The district court noted that the 2011 legislative session\nitself involved “critically important issues such as the $27 million budget\n\n\n\n       22  One of the dissenting opinions calls into question the rationale behind these\nmaneuvers and draws different interpretations and inferences from the evidence. However,\nit is the exclusive province of the district court to engage in this fact finding. Pullman-\nStandard, 456 U.S. at 291–92. We acknowledge that multiple inferences could reasonably\nbe drawn from the record evidence, but we must leave the drawing of those inferences to the\ndistrict court. Additionally, one of the dissenting opinions disagrees with reliance on\nopposing legislators’ factual testimony about the unusual nature of the procedural\nmaneuvers utilized to pass SB 14. There is a clear difference between opposing legislators\ntestifying about their personal knowledge regarding the normal procedural sequence of\npassing legislation and opposing legislators merely speculating about the motives of SB 14’s\nproponents.\n       23The Texas Governor also has the power to call special sessions of the Legislature,\nwhich are topically limited to the confines of the proclamation summoning the Legislature.\nTEX. CONST. art. IV, § 8.\n                                            26\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 27     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nshortfall and transportation funding,” none of which received “a select\ncommittee or an exception from the two-thirds rule,” as did SB 14. Veasey v.\nPerry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 657.\n       The Legislature is entitled to set whatever priorities it wishes. Yet, one\nmight expect that when the Legislature places a bill on an expedited schedule\nand subjects it to such an extraordinary degree of procedural irregularities, as\nwas the case with SB 14, such a bill would address a problem of great\nmagnitude. Ballot integrity is undoubtedly a worthy goal. But the evidence\nbefore the Legislature was that in-person voting, the only concern addressed\nby SB 14, yielded only two convictions for in-person voter impersonation fraud\nout of 20 million votes cast in the decade leading up to SB 14’s passage. 24 See\nid. at 639. The bill did nothing to combat mail-in ballot fraud, although record\nevidence shows that the potential and reality of fraud is much greater in the\nmail-in ballot context than with in-person voting. 25 Id. at 641, 653.\n       In the context of the many pressing matters of great importance to Texas\nthat did not result in these legislative irregularities, we cannot say that the\nrecord leads to only one factual conclusion in this case. Pullman-Standard,\n456 U.S. at 292. We cannot say that district court had to simply accept that\nlegislators were really so concerned with this almost nonexistent problem.\nAgainst a backdrop of warnings that SB 14 would have a disparate impact on\n\n\n\n       24Representative Fischer testified that the Legislature had access to data from the\n2008 and 2010 elections when considering SB 14, which showed that “of the millions of votes\ncast in both of those elections, there were perhaps four referrals for in person voter\nimpersonation” and that “one, if not two individuals . . . had been officially charged and may\nhave accepted responsibility for impersonation.”\n       25 This statement is not intended as a criticism of allowing mail-in ballots, which are\na vital means of enabling voting when it would otherwise be difficult or impossible for some\npeople to exercise their right to vote in person. It is simply an acknowledgement that the\nevidence supporting the need for reform was minimal on the in-person voting side.\n                                             27\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 28     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nminorities and would likely fail the (then extant) preclearance requirement,\namendment after amendment was rejected. Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at\n650–52, 698, 701–02, 708–10. While cloaking themselves in the mantle of\nfollowing Indiana’s voter ID law, which had been upheld against a (different)\nchallenge in Crawford, the proponents of SB 14 took out all the ameliorative\nprovisions of the Indiana law. See, e.g., id. at 651–52 (noting the Texas House\nstripped an indigency exception that had been added to SB 14 in the Texas\nSenate); cf. Frank v. Walker (Frank II), 819 F.3d 384, 386–87 (7th Cir. 2016)\n(noting that an indigency exception may be necessary for voters who face “high\nhurdles” to obtaining required photo identification and that the Indiana law\nthe Court considered in Crawford contained such an indigency exception). 26\n       This circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent is augmented by\ncontemporary examples of State-sponsored discrimination in the record. For\n\n\n       26   One of the dissenting opinions claims that “the Indiana and Texas laws are not\nmeaningfully different.” Jones Dissenting Op. at 28 n.26. This ignores the district court’s\nfindings and the obvious differences between the two laws that affect the discriminatory\nimpact analysis. The district court explained the differences well:\n        Notably, while Defendants claim that SB 14 was modeled after the Indiana\n        law, the Indiana law is more generous to voters. Unlike SB 14, it permits the\n        use of any Indiana state-issued or federal ID and contains a nursing home\n        resident exemption. Furthermore, Indiana is more generous in its acceptance\n        of certain expired ID. Of particular relevance here, Indiana’s accommodation\n        of indigents, while requiring an additional trip to the county election office to\n        claim an exemption, does not require an indigent to actually obtain, or pay any\n        fees associated with, a qualified photo ID. This is significant, as demonstrated\n        in this case. There was also a reference in Crawford to a “greater public\n        awareness” of the law, which would prompt voters to secure qualified ID, as\n        opposed to a relative dearth of publicity and instruction in Texas.\nVeasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 679 (footnotes omitted) (citing IND. CODE § 3-5-2-40.5(a)(3)\n(2014), IND. CODE § 3-11.7-5-2.5 (2011), and Crawford, 553 U.S. at 187–88 & n.6). The\ndistrict court specifically found that the Texas Legislature stripped an indigency exception\nfrom SB 14, id. at 652, and that “[w]hen the legislature rejected student IDs, state\ngovernment employee IDs, and federal IDs, they rejected IDs that are disproportionately held\nby African–Americans and Hispanics,” id. at 658. These differences are highly salient to the\ndiscriminatory impact analysis.\n                                              28\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530        Page: 29     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nexample, the record shows that as late as 1975, Texas attempted to suppress\nminority voting through purging the voter rolls, after its former poll tax and\nre-registration requirements were ruled unconstitutional. See Veasey v. Perry,\n71 F. Supp. 3d at 635. 27 It is notable as well that “[i]n every redistricting cycle\nsince 1970, Texas has been found to have violated the [Voting rights Act] with\nracially gerrymandered districts.”          Id. at 636 & n.23 (collecting cases). 28\nFurthermore, record evidence establishes that the Department of Justice\nobjected to at least one of Texas’s statewide redistricting plans for each period\nbetween 1980 and the present, while Texas was covered by Section 5 of the\n\n\n\n       27   The law in question was enacted in 1975, after a previous re-registration\nrequirement was struck down as unconstitutional in the early 1970s. A three-judge court\neventually struck down this attempt at purging and re-registration after the Department of\nJustice objected to the law when Texas became subject to preclearance. See generally Veasey\nv. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 635 & n.18.\n       28  In LULAC, the Supreme Court also noted Texas’s “long, well-documented history\nof discrimination that has touched upon the rights of African-Americans and Hispanics to\nregister, to vote, or to participate otherwise in the electoral process.” LULAC, 548 U.S. at\n439 (quoting Vera v. Richards, 861 F. Supp. 1304, 1317 (S.D. Tex. 1994)). The Court found\nthat Texas’s 2003 redistricting plan diluted the Hispanic vote in one district such that it\nviolated the Voting Rights Act. Although the Court did not find that Texas had acted with\ndiscriminatory intent, it noted:\n                The changes to District 23 undermined the progress of a racial\n                group that has been subject to significant voting-related\n                discrimination and that was becoming increasingly politically\n                active and cohesive. . . . In essence the State took away the\n                Latinos’ opportunity because Latinos were about to exercise it.\n                This bears the mark of intentional discrimination that could give\n                rise to an equal protection violation. Even if we accept the\n                District Court’s finding that the State’s action was taken\n                primarily for political, not racial, reasons, the redrawing of the\n                district lines was damaging to the Latinos in District 23. The\n                State not only made fruitless the Latinos’ mobilization efforts\n                but also acted against those Latinos who were becoming most\n                politically active, dividing them with a district line through the\n                middle of Laredo.\n        Id. at 439–40 (citations omitted).\n                                            29\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530        Page: 30     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nVoting Rights Act. Texas “is the only state with this consistent record of\nobjections to such statewide plans.” 29          Finally, the same Legislature that\npassed SB 14 also passed two laws found to be passed with discriminatory\npurpose. See Texas v. United States, 887 F. Supp. 2d 133, 159–66 (D.D.C. 2012)\n(utilizing the Arlington Heights analysis and concluding the 2011 Texas\nLegislature created two redistricting plans with a discriminatory purpose),\nvacated and remanded on other grounds, 133 S. Ct. 2885 (2013).\n       It is also probative that many rationales were given for a voter\nidentification law, which shifted as they were challenged or disproven by\nopponents. Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 653–59; see generally Foster, 136\nS. Ct. at 1751–52, 1754–55 (reasoning that the fact that the government’s\n“principal reasons” for its action “shifted over time . . . suggest[ed] that those\nreasons may [have been] pretextual”).             One of those rationales included\npreventing noncitizens from voting, even though two forms of identification\n\n\n       29 One of the dissenting opinions quarrels with the district court’s findings on this\nissue, but a three-judge panel reviewing Texas’s 1981 redistricting plan reached the same\nconclusion:\n              In 1975, Congress extended the special pre-clearance provisions\n              of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to Texas. This decision was\n              made on the basis of extensive hearings into the history of voting\n              discrimination in the state. Since the pre-clearance provisions\n              were extended to Texas in August of 1975, the Department of\n              Justice has lodged far more objections to governmental actions\n              affecting voting rights in Texas than any other covered state.\n              Between August 15, 1975, and September 18, 1981, the State\n              and its various political sub-divisions received 91 letters of\n              objection. In this same period, no other covered state had more\n              than 50 objections, and only three had more than thirty. The\n              election changes objected to by the Department of Justice\n              include the movement of polling places, proposed annexations,\n              alteration of district lines, and a state-wide purge of voter\n              registration lists.\nSeamon v. Upham, 536 F. Supp. 931, 989 (E.D. Tex.) (citations omitted), vacated on other\ngrounds, 456 U.S. 37 (1982).\n                                            30\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 31     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\napproved under SB 14 are available to noncitizens. Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp.\n3d at 654. It is likewise relevant that SB 14’s proponents refused to answer\nwhy they would not allow amendments to ameliorate the expected disparate\nimpact of SB 14. Id. at 646–47, 650–51.\n       Further supporting the district court’s finding is the fact that the\nextraordinary measures accompanying the passage of SB 14 occurred in the\nwake of a “seismic demographic shift,” as minority populations rapidly\nincreased in Texas, such that the district court found that the party currently\nin power is “facing a declining voter base and can gain partisan advantage”\nthrough a strict voter ID law. 30 Id. at 700.\n       In sum, although some of the evidence on which the district court relied\nwas infirm, there remains evidence to support a finding that the cloak of ballot\nintegrity could be hiding a more invidious purpose. As we have explained, the\n\n\n\n       30   This partisan motive to suppress votes is not based on which party is in the\nmajority. When asked about the fact that most redistricting and discriminatory laws were\nenacted under legislatures with a majority who were members of a different party than the\ncurrent majority, the Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Burton, agreed. He testified that this fact made\nhis analysis “stronger because it does not matter who is in charge of State politics or the\npolitical parties in power in Texas, whether they’re Republicans, Democrats[,] or Martians,\nevery time that African–Americans have, in fact, been perceived to be increasing their ability\nto vote and participate in the process there has been State legislation to either deny them the\nvote or at least dilute the vote or make it much more difficult for them to participate on an\nequal basis as Whites in the State of Texas.”\n        One of the dissenting opinions claims that we confuse partisanship for racism in our\nanalysis of whether the Legislature acted with a discriminatory intent. Intentions to achieve\npartisan gain and to racially discriminate are not mutually exclusive. As another of the\ndissenting opinions points out, acting to preserve legislative power in a partisan manner can\nalso be impermissibly discriminatory. Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d 1398, 1408 (7th Cir. 1984)\n(noting that “racial discrimination [may be and has been a] necessary accompaniment of [an]\naction taken to protect incumbencies”). In this case, the district court found that the party\nin power in the Texas Legislature faced “a declining voter base and [stood to] gain partisan\nadvantage by suppressing the . . . votes of African-Americans and Latinos.” See Veasey v.\nPerry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 700. Once again, the disagreement centers in part on the fact that\nsome of the dissenting opinions would re-weigh the evidence and disregard the district court’s\nfact findings, which we are not entitled to do. See Pullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at 292.\n                                             31\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 32      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nabsence of direct evidence such as a “let’s discriminate” email cannot be and is\nnot dispositive. Because we do not know how much the evidence found infirm\nweighed in the district court’s calculus, we cannot simply affirm the decision.\nHowever, it is not an appellate court’s place to weigh evidence. See Price, 945\nF.2d at 1317 (“[T]he appellate court may not substitute its judgment for the\ndistrict court’s.”). Thus, since there is more than one way to decide this case,\nand the right court to make those findings is the district court, we must\nremand. 31\n       We therefore remand this claim to the district court to “reexamin[e] . . .\nthe probative evidence underlying Plaintiffs’ discriminatory purpose claims\nweighed against the contrary evidence, in accord with” the appropriate legal\nstandards we have described. Veasey, 796 F.3d at 503–04; cf. City of Richmond\n\n\n       31   Two of the dissenting opinions take issue with our decision on discriminatory\nintent, in part because this issue can be fraught and divisive. One of the dissenting opinions\nclaims that Congress intended to prevent such divisiveness by ensuring that plaintiffs could\nsue for discriminatory impact. Congress amended the Voting Rights Act in 1982 to make it\nclear that plaintiffs could sue for discriminatory impact after Supreme Court precedent had\nrequired the showing of a discriminatory purpose under Section 2. See S. Rep. No. 97-417,\nat 15–16 (1982), as reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 192–93. Congress acted in the face\nof this precedent to make it easier for minority plaintiffs to combat discriminatory laws—not\nto make it more difficult. Congress did not eliminate plaintiffs’ ability to sue for purposeful\ndiscrimination, so it remains our duty to consider these claims. See S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 17\n(1982), as reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 194 & n.50 (emphasis in original) (citation\nomitted) (noting that Section 2 was originally understood by Congress to prohibit “any kind\nof practice . . . if its purpose or effect was to deny or abridge the right to vote on account of\nrace or color”). In this case, although we must tread carefully in assessing the motives of the\nLegislature and the district court may very well agree with some of the points made by the\ndissenting opinions, we must be mindful of our role in this process. We are not the court to\nmake factual findings in the first instance, and the record evidence could support more than\none conclusion. We must therefore remand for reweighing of the evidence, rather than\nconducting that reweighing ourselves. See Pullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at 291 (“When an\nappellate court discerns that a district court has failed to make a finding because of an\nerroneous view of the law . . . there should be a remand for further proceedings to permit the\ntrial court to make the missing findings . . . .” (emphasis added)); N. Miss. Commc’ns, Inc. v.\nJones, 951 F.2d 652, 656–57 (5th Cir. 1992) (citing Pullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at 291)\n(remanding a case, for the fourth time, for factual findings under the proper standard).\n                                              32\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530          Page: 33   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nv. United States, 422 U.S. 358, 378 (1975) (“[W]e should be confident of the\nevidentiary record and the adequacy of the lower court’s consideration of it.”).\nThe parties have not asked to offer additional evidence, and we conclude that,\nas to this issue, the district court should not take additional evidence. The\ndistrict court may, but is not required to, entertain additional oral argument\nprior to issuing its new findings. The district court on remand should make its\ndiscriminatory purpose findings based on the record we have, guided by this\nopinion and the instructions we have given the district court about the legal\ninfirmities in its initial findings.\n      Time is short, though. The Supreme Court has, in effect, set a July 20\ndeadline for this court to act, after which it will entertain motions for relief.\nVeasey v. Abbott, 136 S. Ct. at 1823. Time is also needed to communicate those\nmodifications to the wider public so as not to disrupt the election process.\nIndeed, among the findings made by the district court was that the public\neducation campaign for SB 14 at the time of trial was “grossly insufficient.”\nVeasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 649. Equally necessary in the time left before\nearly voting begins in late October is an adequate campaign to explain not only\nSB 14 but also court-ordered amendments to voter identification rules. We are\nmindful that future litigation and appeals to this court are also distinct\npossibilities.\n      Additionally, we recognize the burden our majority opinion places on the\ndistrict court to implement a remedy for the discriminatory effect violation\nwith so little time, see infra Part II.B. Therefore, to avoid disruption of the\nupcoming election, we rely on equitable principles in concluding that the\ndistrict court should first focus on fashioning interim relief for the\ndiscriminatory effect violation in the months leading up to the November 2016\ngeneral election. The primary concern of this court and the district court\n                                           33\n\f    Case: 14-41127          Document: 00513601530        Page: 34   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                          No. 14-41127\nshould be to ensure that SB 14’s discriminatory effect is ameliorated as Section\n2 requires in time for the November 2016 election, while respecting the policy\nchoices made by the Legislature in passing SB 14. See Perry v. Perez, 132 S.\nCt. 934, 940–41 (2012) (per curiam).\n      We instruct the district court to take the requisite time to reevaluate the\nevidence and determine anew whether the Legislature acted with a\ndiscriminatory intent in enacting SB 14. But it is unnecessary for the district\ncourt to undertake this task until after the November 2016 election. See\nPurcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 5–6 (2006) (election permitted to continue\ndespite unresolved issues related to disenfranchisement); see also Reynolds v.\nSims, 377 U.S. 533, 585 (1964) (noting that a court may withhold immediate\nrelief so as not to disturb a forthcoming election). If the district court concludes\nthat SB 14 was passed with a discriminatory intent, the district court should\nfashion an appropriate remedy in accord with its findings; provided, however,\nthat any remedy will not be made effective until after the November 2016\nelection.\nB. Discriminatory Effect\n      Plaintiffs allege that SB 14 has a discriminatory effect in violation of\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which proscribes any “voting qualification\nor prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results\nin a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen . . . to vote on account of\nrace or color.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). Unlike discrimination claims brought\npursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress has clarified that violations\nof Section 2(a) can “be proved by showing discriminatory effect alone.”\nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 35 (1986); see also 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). 32\n\n\n      32    Section 2 provides in full:\n                                              34\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530       Page: 35    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-41127\nIn proscribing laws that have a discriminatory effect, Congress exercised its\nauthority pursuant to the Fifteenth Amendment, which states that “[t]he right\nof citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the\nUnited States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of\nservitude,” and gives Congress the “power to enforce this article by appropriate\nlegislation.” U.S. CONST. amend. XV.\n      1. The Gingles Factors and Two-Part Framework\n      To prove that a law has a discriminatory effect under Section 2, Plaintiffs\nmust show not only that the challenged law imposes a burden on minorities,\nbut also that “a certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social\nand historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by\nblack and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.” Gingles, 478\nU.S. at 47 (emphasis added). While courts regularly utilize statistical analyses\nto discern whether a law has a discriminatory impact, see, e.g., Operation Push,\n\n\n\n       (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or\n       procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in\n       a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen\n       of the United States to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of\n       the guarantees set forth in section 10303(f)(2) of this title, as provided in\n       subsection (b).\n       (b) A violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the totality of\n       circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or\n       election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to\n       participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) in\n       that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate\n       to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their\n       choice. The extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to\n       office in the State or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be\n       considered: Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a right to have\n       members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in\n       the population.\n52 U.S.C. § 10301. We address more fully below how the factors adopted by the Supreme\nCourt in Gingles and the other standards we apply effectuate the language of Section 2.\n                                          35\n\f    Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530         Page: 36    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-41127\n932 F.2d at 410–11, the Supreme Court has also endorsed factors (“the Gingles\nfactors”) enunciated by Congress to determine whether such an impact is a\nproduct of current or historical conditions of discrimination such that it\nviolates Section 2, 33 Gingles, 478 U.S. at 44–45.\n      Although courts have often applied the Gingles factors to analyze claims\nof vote dilution, 34 perhaps because of past preclearance requirements, there is\nlittle authority on the proper test to determine whether the right to vote has\nbeen denied or abridged on account of race. See Ohio State Conference of\nNAACP v. Husted, 768 F.3d 524, 554 (6th Cir. 2014) (“Unsurprisingly, then,\nthe case law has developed to suit the particular challenges of vote dilution\nclaims. A clear test for Section 2 vote denial claims—generally used to refer to\nany claim that is not a vote dilution claim—has yet to emerge.”), vacated on\nother grounds by No. 14-3877, 2014 WL 10384647, at *1 (6th Cir. Oct. 1, 2014).\nHowever, the Fourth and Sixth Circuits have adopted a two-part framework\nthat draws on the text of Section 2 and the Supreme Court’s guidance in\nGingles to analyze Section 2 claims.\n      (a) The Two-Part Framework\n      We now adopt the two-part framework employed by the Fourth and Sixth\nCircuits to evaluate Section 2 “results” claims.             The framework has two\nelements:\n      [1] [T]he challenged standard, practice, or procedure must impose\n      a discriminatory burden on members of a protected class, meaning\n      that members of the protected class have less opportunity than\n\n\n      33  These are sometimes also called the “Senate Factors,” as they derive from the\nSenate Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act. See Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 43–45.\n       34 See, e.g., League of United Latin Am. Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 999\n\nF.2d 831, 850–51 (5th Cir. 1993) (en banc); Salas v. Sw. Tex.

Ct.\n1735 (2015); see also Husted, 768 F.3d at 554.\n      The first part of this two-part framework inquires about the nature of\nthe burden imposed and whether it creates a disparate effect in that “members\nof the protected class have less opportunity than other members of the\nelectorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of\ntheir choice”—this encompasses Section 2’s definition of what kinds of burdens\ndeny or abridge the right to vote. Compare 52 U.S.C. § 10301 (proscribing\ndenial or abridgement of the right to vote and defining how a violation of\nSection 2 may be established), with League of Women Voters, 769 F.3d at 240\n(outlining the two-part test, using almost identical language to describe an\nimpermissible burden on the right to vote).\n      The second part of the two-part framework draws on the Supreme\nCourt’s guidance in Gingles. See League of Women Voters, 769 F.3d at 240\n(quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47); Husted, 768 F.3d at 554 (quoting Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 47). This second part of the framework provides the requisite\ncausal link between the burden on voting rights and the fact that this burden\naffects minorities disparately because it interacts with social and historical\nconditions that have produced discrimination against minorities currently, in\nthe past, or both. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47 (“The essence of a § 2 claim is\nthat a certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social and\n\n\n                                       37\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 38     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nhistorical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by\nblack and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.”).\n       (b) The Gingles Factors\n       As did the Fourth and Sixth Circuits, we conclude that the Gingles\nfactors should be used to help determine whether there is a sufficient causal\nlink between the disparate burden imposed and social and historical conditions\nproduced by discrimination. 35 In other words, the Gingles factors may be used\nto examine causality under the second part of the two-part analysis.\n       These factors include:\n       1. the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state or\n       political subdivision that touched the right of the members of the\n       minority group to register, to vote, or otherwise to participate in\n       the democratic process;\n       2. the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political\n       subdivision is racially polarized;\n       3. the extent to which the state or political subdivision has used\n       unusually large election districts, majority vote requirements,\n       anti-single shot provisions, or other voting practices or procedures\n       that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the\n       minority group;\n       4. if there is a candidate slating process, whether the members of\n       the minority group have been denied access to that process;\n       5. the extent to which members of the minority group in the state\n       or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such\n       areas as education, employment and health, which hinder their\n       ability to participate effectively in the political process;\n       6. whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or\n       subtle racial appeals;\n\n\n\n\n       35  See League of Women Voters, 769 F.3d at 240, 245 (noting the Gingles factors are\nuseful in examining both elements of the two-part test, especially the causal linkage between\ndisparate impacts and conditions of discrimination); Husted, 768 F.3d at 554 (noting the\nGingles factors form part of the totality of the circumstances analysis in examining a claim\nof vote denial, “particularly with regard to the second element” of the two-part test).\n                                             38\n\f      Case: 14-41127   Document: 00513601530      Page: 39   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\n        7. the extent to which members of the minority group have been\n        elected to public office in the jurisdiction.\nId. at 36–37 (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 28–29 (1982), reprinted in 1982\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 206–07). Two additional considerations are:\n        [8.] whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the\n        part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the members\n        of the minority group[; and]\n        [9.] whether the policy underlying the state or political\n        subdivision’s use of such voting qualification, prerequisite to\n        voting, or standard, practice or procedure is tenuous.\nId.\n        These factors are not exclusive, and “there is no requirement that any\nparticular number of factors be proved, or that a majority of them point one\nway or the other.” Id. at 45 (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 29). Not every\nfactor will be relevant in every case. These factors provide salient guidance\nfrom Congress and the Supreme Court on how to examine the current effects\nof past and current discrimination and how those effects interact with a\nchallenged law. Id.; League of Women Voters, 769 F.3d at 240, 245; Husted,\n768 F.3d at 554.\n        (c) This Analysis is Appropriate for Section 2 Effect Challenges\n        The State argues that the Gingles factors are inapposite in this context,\nand that we should apply the two-part test as it was applied in the Seventh\nCircuit in Frank v. Walker, 768 F.3d 744, 754–55 (7th Cir. 2014), cert. denied,\n135 S. Ct. 1551 (2015). The State also argues that if we apply the Gingles\nfactors and two-part test and find a Section 2 violation in this case, all manner\nof neutral election laws may be struck down. We disagree that the Gingles\nfactors are inapposite here, and we have good reasons to believe that the\nState’s gloomy forecast is unsound.\n\n\n                                        39\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 40      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       Use of the two-factor test and the Gingles factors limits Section 2\nchallenges to those that properly link the effects of past and current\ndiscrimination with the racially disparate effects of the challenged law.\nApplying the Gingles factors involves engaging in a multi-factor analysis,\nunder which no one factor has determinative weight. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45.\nCertainly, this analysis is fact dependent. Yet, in many similar contexts, we\nfrequently employ multi-factor, totality-of-the-circumstances analyses that are\nhighly fact bound. See, e.g., United States v. Batamula, ___ F.3d ___, No. 12-\n20630, 2016 WL 2342943, at *3–4 (5th Cir. May 3, 2016) (en banc) (analyzing\nthe totality of the circumstances to determine whether a defendant was\nprejudiced by a lack of competent advice during the guilty plea process);\nCannata v. Catholic Diocese of Austin, 700 F.3d 169, 175–76 (5th Cir. 2012)\n(adopting a “totality-of-the-circumstances” analysis to determine whether an\nemployee is a minister for purposes of the ministerial exception and abrogating\nthe three-part test previously employed by this court, because the Supreme\nCourt specifically rejected the use of a rigid, bright-line test for this issue);\nStewart v. Miss. Transp. Comm’n, 586 F.3d 321, 330–31 (5th Cir. 2009)\n(applying multi-factor tests to analyze whether a supervisor created a hostile\nwork environment or retaliated against an employee for reporting sexual\nharassment, and in analyzing the last factor of the hostile work environment\ntest, looking to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the\nharassment was sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter employment\nconditions). 36\n\n\n       36 See also In re Am.

Jenson, 462 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. 2006) (employing a multi-factor test to\ndetermine whether consent to search was voluntary); Cleveland v. City of Elmendorf, 388\n                                              40\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 41      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       We conclude that the two-part framework and Gingles factors together\nserve as a sufficient and familiar way to limit courts’ interference with\n“neutral” election laws to those that truly have a discriminatory impact under\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Just because a test is fact driven and multi-\nfactored does not make it dangerously limitless in application.\n       The State argues that we should instead adopt a bright-line test as our\nlimiting principle.      As the State would have it, so long as the State can\narticulate a legitimate justification for its election law and some voters are able\nto meet the requirements, there is no Section 2 violation. This argument\neffectively nullifies the protections of the Voting Rights Act by giving states a\nfree pass to enact needlessly burdensome laws with impermissible racially\ndiscriminatory impacts. The Voting Rights Act was enacted to prevent just\nsuch invidious, subtle forms of discrimination. See Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S.\n380, 406 (1991) (Scalia, J., dissenting); Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S.\n544, 565–66 (1969). We think the factors applied to the facts are a proper\nlimiting principle, and find this analysis faithful to the purposes of the Voting\nRights Act. 37\n\n\nF.3d 522, 528 (5th Cir. 2004) (employing a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis to\ndetermine whether workers were volunteers for the purposes of the Fair Labor Standards\nAct); Brown & Root, Inc. v. NLRB, 333 F.3d 628, 634 (5th Cir. 2003) (applying a totality-of-\nthe-circumstances analysis to determine whether an employer made an unlawful threat\nrelated to union activity); United States v. Rodriguez-Rivas, 151 F.3d 377, 380–81 (5th Cir.\n1998) (employing a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis to determine whether a Border\nPatrol agent had reasonable suspicion to stop a vehicle); United States v. Jon-T Chems., Inc.,\n768 F.2d 686, 694 (5th Cir. 1985) (looking “to the totality of the circumstances” in a “heavily\nfact-specific” inquiry regarding whether a subsidiary was the alter ego of its parent); Gonzales\nv. Beto, 460 F.2d 314, 315 (5th Cir. 1972) (judging a lineup by the totality of the circumstances\nto determine whether it violated due process).\n       37  These arguments also address the discomfort expressed by some of the dissenting\nopinions with how the Gingles factors are applied differently in different cases. As we have\nnoted, the factors are highly fact dependent, as they must be to address different laws,\ndifferent states with varying histories of official discrimination, and different populations of\n                                              41\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 42     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\n       In addition, two district courts have now applied the same analysis we\napply here to two different states’ laws and have found no discriminatory\nresults under Section 2. See, e.g., Lee v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, ___ F. Supp.\n3d ____, No. 3:15CV357-HEH, 2016 WL 2946181, at *5, *21–24 (E.D. Va. May\n19, 2016); N.C. State Conference of the NAACP v. McCrory, ___ F. Supp. 3d\n____, No. 1:13CV658, 2016 WL 1650774, at *73–76, *117, *122 (M.D.N.C. Apr.\n25, 2016). These district court cases illustrate three principles that the State\nignores in its arguments before us: (1) the analysis we employ effectively allows\nexamination of differing fact patterns; (2) the State’s prediction of vast judicial\ninterference with election laws is unfounded; and (3) district courts are well\nsuited to conduct this fact-intensive analysis in the first instance, as the\ninstitutions we rely on for fact finding day in and day out.\n\n\n\n\nminority voters. Such has also been the case with the variances in decisions among the circuit\ncourts to consider challenges to voter ID laws—our decision differs from those of other circuits\nin part because we are considering “the [s]trictest [l]aw in the [c]ountry” in a State with a\nfairly extensive history of official discrimination. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 642;\ncf. Frank, 768 F.3d at 746 (noting that Wisconsin’s law allowed the use of state ID cards,\nrecent naturalization papers, tribal IDs, and signed college or university photo IDs); Common\nCause/Georgia v. Billups, 554 F.3d 1340, 1346 (11th Cir. 2009) (noting that Georgia’s law\nallowed the use of “a government employee identification card, a U.S. military identification\ncard, or a tribal identification card”); Gonzalez v. Arizona, No. CV 06-1268-PHX, 2006 WL\n3627297, at *6 (D. Ariz. Sept. 11, 2006) (describing a wide variety of acceptable forms of\nidentification accepted at Arizona polls), aff’d, 485 F.3d 1041 (9th Cir. 2007).\n        Even so, the fact-dependent nature of the Gingles factors does not mean that\n“[v]irtually any voter regulation” may be struck down under our analysis. See Jones\nDissenting Op. at 52. Undoubtedly, challenges to election laws under Section 2 have\nincreased since Shelby County as states have enacted new laws and regulations that must be\nchallenged under Section 2, if at all, because these laws no longer face preclearance. That\ndoes not mean that our analysis endangers neutral, nondiscriminatory election laws. As we\nexplain infra, district courts considering these challenges have come to different conclusions\nbased on varying fact patterns and election laws, not always with the result of striking down\nelection laws. Indeed, the United States abandoned its Section 2 discriminatory-effect\nchallenge to a voter ID law after the North Carolina legislature added a reasonable\nimpediment exception to the law. See N.C. State Conference of the NAACP v. McCrory, ___\nF. Supp. 3d ____, No. 1:13CV658, 2016 WL 1650774, at *16 (M.D.N.C. Apr. 25, 2016).\n                                              42\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 43     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\n        Furthermore, the Seventh Circuit’s approach in Frank is not\ninconsistent with our own.            The Seventh Circuit applied the two-part\nframework only “[f]or the sake of argument,” did not apply the Gingles factors,\nand expressed skepticism about the second step of the two-part analysis\n“because it does not distinguish discrimination by the [government] defendants\nfrom other persons’ discrimination.” Frank, 768 F.3d at 754–55. The Seventh\nCircuit ultimately did not apply the second step of the two-part analysis\nbecause it concluded that the plaintiffs failed to show that Wisconsin’s law\nimposed a discriminatory burden that gave minority voters less opportunity to\nparticipate in the political process at the first step of the analysis. Id. at 753,\n755. Our record contains more particularized evidence of the discriminatory\nburden imposed by SB 14 than did the record in Frank. 38\n        To the extent that the State argues causality may be established only\nwhere there is a finding that state action caused the social and historical\nconditions begetting discrimination, see Frank, 768 F.3d at 755, we need not\nand do not decide that issue. Unlike in Frank, the district court in this case\nfound both historical and contemporary examples of discrimination in both\nemployment and education by the State of Texas, and it attributed SB 14’s\ndisparate impact, in part, to the lasting effects of that State-sponsored\ndiscrimination. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 636, 666–67. Thus, even\nassuming this limitation from Frank applied, the evidence here meets that\ntest.\n\n\n\n\n        38  Furthermore, Wisconsin’s law, considered in Frank, allows for more forms of\nidentification than does SB 14. The district court found SB 14 to be the “[s]trictest [l]aw in\nthe [c]ountry” based on comparisons to other states’ voter ID laws and on the characterization\nof SB 14 by one of its drafters. Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 642–43, 701 & n.542.\n                                             43\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 44     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\n       Finally, we reject the argument that Crawford mandates upholding SB\n14 simply because the State expressed legitimate justifications for passing the\nlaw. 39 Crawford contains no mention of Section 2 or the Voting Rights Act—\nin that case, the Court only considered a First and Fourteenth Amendment\nchallenge, which involves a different analytical framework than what we use\nfor Section 2 claims. See generally 553 U.S. 181. Additionally, the Court in\nCrawford analyzed only a facial challenge that had been adjudicated in the\ndistrict court on summary judgment. Crawford, 553 U.S. at 187–88, 202–03.\nHere, we have a multitude of factual findings about Plaintiffs’ combined\nchallenges, based on copious evidence from a bench trial and a record that\nspans more than one hundred thousand pages. See generally Veasey v. Perry,\n71 F. Supp. 3d 627. Nevertheless, the State argues that Frank drew on\nCrawford to conclude Wisconsin’s law did not impose a discriminatory burden\non voters because it appeared to be a generally-applicable election law.\n       Crawford clearly established that states have strong interests in\npreventing voter fraud and increasing voter confidence by safeguarding the\nintegrity of elections. 553 U.S. at 191, 194–97. We do not deny that the State\nin this case may pursue those interests, nor that they are strong and valid\ninterests. However, that acknowledgement does not address the additional as-\n\n\n       39   One of the dissenting opinions relies heavily on Crawford in discussing both\ndiscriminatory purpose and impact, essentially using Crawford’s endorsement of “preventing\nvoter fraud” as a talisman against objections that SB 14 does not appear even remotely well\ntailored to suit its stated purposes. While we acknowledge the State’s legitimate interests in\nthis case, Crawford did not deal with either discriminatory intent or effect under Section 2.\nIn Crawford, the Court simply noted the weight of the State’s interests in the First and\nFourteenth Amendment balancing analysis, which differs from Section 2’s inquiries into\ndiscriminatory motive and impact. As noted infra, even Judge Easterbrook and the Seventh\nCircuit do not subscribe to the dissenting opinions’ views of Crawford’s or Frank’s holdings.\nWe likewise decline to read into Crawford the inapposite principle that the State may\ninvidiously discriminate or impermissibly disparately burden minorities so long as it\narticulates “preventing voter fraud” as one purpose of a restrictive law.\n                                             44\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 45      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\napplied challenges Plaintiffs make in this case. See id. at 199–202. Even the\nSeventh Circuit has acknowledged that Crawford does not extend as far as the\nState argues, holding that Frank “did not decide that persons unable to get a\nphoto ID with reasonable effort lack a serious grievance.” Frank II, 819 F.3d\nat 386. The Seventh Circuit in this later iteration of Frank did not consider a\nSection 2 challenge. Id. at 385–86; see also Frank v. Walker, 141 F. Supp. 3d\n932, 934–36 (E.D. Wis. 2015), vacated in part by Frank II, 819 F.3d 384. But\nthe court noted that neither Crawford nor Frank foreclose the argument that\nan indigency exception may be necessary to prevent an unconstitutional\nburden on plaintiffs hindered from voting and obtaining photo IDs due to\nfinancial hardship and other factors like those exhibited by the Plaintiffs in\nthis case. 40 Frank II, 819 F.3d at 386–87. The Seventh Circuit remanded the\nplaintiffs’ constitutional claims to the district court for further consideration of\nan as-applied challenge factually similar to the one Plaintiffs make in this case.\nId. at 385–86, 388.\n\n\n\n\n       40 Specifically, the Seventh Circuit noted the distinction between the general facial\nchallenge in Frank and the more particular as-applied challenge in Frank II:\n       The argument plaintiffs now present is different. Instead of saying that\n       inconvenience for some voters means that no one needs photo ID, plaintiffs\n       contend that high hurdles for some persons eligible to vote entitle those\n       particular persons to relief. Plaintiffs’ approach is potentially sound if even a\n       single person eligible to vote is unable to get acceptable photo ID with reasonable\n       effort. The right to vote is personal and is not defeated by the fact that 99% of\n       other people can secure the necessary credentials easily. Plaintiffs now accept\n       the propriety of requiring photo ID from persons who already have or can get\n       it with reasonable effort, while endeavoring to protect the voting rights of those\n       who encounter high hurdles. This is compatible with our opinion and mandate,\n       just as it is compatible with Crawford.\nFrank II, 819 F.3d at 386–87 (emphasis added).\n                                              45\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 46      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       Having established that the two-part analysis and Gingles factors are\nappropriate standards for examining Plaintiffs’ Section 2 claim, 41 we evaluate\nthe district court’s discriminatory effect finding for clear error. See Operation\nPush, 932 F.2d at 410.\n       2. SB 14’s Disparate Impact\n       The district court found that 608,470 registered voters, or 4.5% of all\nregistered voters in Texas, lack SB 14 ID. Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at\n659. Of those, 534,512 voters did not qualify for a disability exemption from\nSB 14’s requirements. Id. The latter figure, which was derived by comparing\nthe Texas Election Management System with databases containing evidence\nof who possesses SB 14 ID, is known as the “No-Match List.” 42 Id. The district\ncourt credited expert analysis and testimony by the individual Plaintiffs,\nfinding that SB 14 imposed excessive and disparate burdens on minority voters\n\n\n\n\n       41   One of the dissenting opinions proposes a different analysis to apply in Section 2\n“results” cases. This opinion asserts that the test should be “simple and consistent,” meaning\nthat we should ignore the Supreme Court’s guidance in Gingles, Congress’s intention as\nexpressed in the Senate Factors, and, in practice, that we should require outright denial of\nthe right to vote to show a Section 2 violation. Jones Dissenting Op. at 53. Unfortunately,\nassessing whether a law has a discriminatory impact is no simple matter and does not lend\nitself to simple formulations. As we have shown, neither do many other fact-dependent tests\nthat we routinely apply in other contexts. We must undertake this difficult work, even if the\nanalytical frameworks best suited to the task are not as neat and tidy as we would prefer.\nSee Clements, 999 F.2d at 860 (noting that standards in Section 2 cases “must reflect the\ncentral purpose of the Voting Rights Act and its intended liberality as well as the practical\ndifficulties of proof in the real world of trial,” especially since “greater certitude frequently\nmay be purchased only at the expense of other values”).\n       42 While the State’s expert criticized this calculation, he conceded that the\nmethodology used to derive this figure was well accepted. Nonetheless, he attempted to\nchallenge the No-Match List because 21,731 people on the No-Match List later voted in the\nspring 2014 election. We accept the well-reasoned logic of the district court, which noted that\nsome of those 21,731 who voted may have done so by mail, which does not require SB 14 ID,\nwhile others may have obtained SB 14 ID between the calculation of the No-Match List and\nthe spring 2014 election. Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 660.\n                                              46\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 47     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nwho lack SB 14 ID, including many Plaintiffs. Id. at 664–77. This evidence\nsupports the district court’s findings regarding SB 14’s disparate impact.\n       (a) Expert Analyses of SB 14’s Impact\n       Plaintiffs’ experts relied on four distinct methods of analysis to\ndetermine the races of those on the No-Match List. 43 Id. at 660–62. Those\nincluded: (1) ecological regression analysis, (2) homogenous block group\nanalysis, (3) comparing the No-Match List to a Spanish Surname Voter\nRegistration list, and (4) reliance on data provided by Catalist LLC, a company\nthat compiles election data. Id. at 661. The ecological regression analysis\nperformed by Dr. Stephen Ansolabehere, an expert in American electoral\npolitics and statistical methods in political science, which compared the No-\nMatch List with census data, revealed that Hispanic registered voters and\nBlack registered voters were respectively 195% and 305% more likely than\ntheir Anglo peers to lack SB 14 ID. Id. According to Dr. Ansolabehere, this\ndisparity is “statistically significant and ‘highly unlikely to have arisen by\nchance.’” Id. The homogenous block group analysis yielded similar results,\nand other experts arrived at similar conclusions.                  Id. at 661–62.      These\nstatistical analyses of the No-Match List were corroborated by a survey of over\n2,300 eligible Texas voters, which concluded that Blacks were 1.78 times more\nlikely than Whites, and Latinos 2.42 times more likely, to lack SB 14 ID. Id.\n\n\n\n       43  We recognize that the terms used to describe different racial or ethnic groups\ninoffensively can themselves be the subject of dispute. Where we quote a witness or the\ndistrict court or where we discuss a witness’s testimony, we use their terms. For our part,\nbecause we are a reviewing court, while recognizing the imperfections of these terms, we use\nthe terms used by the district court and the parties to refer to the three groups that were the\nsubject of the evidence in this case: Anglos (used to describe non-Hispanic Caucasians),\nHispanics, and African Americans. We also recognize that many Texans identify with more\nthan one racial or ethnic group and some Texans do not fall into any of these three groups;\nwe address the evidence and arguments as they were presented by the parties.\n                                              47\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 48   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nat 662–63. Even the study performed by the State’s expert, which the district\ncourt found suffered from “significant methodological oversights,” found that\n4% of eligible White voters lacked SB 14 ID, compared to 5.3% of eligible Black\nvoters and 6.9% of eligible Hispanic voters. Id. at 663 & n.239. The district\ncourt thus credited the testimony and analyses of Plaintiffs’ three experts, each\nof which found that SB 14 disparately impacts African-American and Hispanic\nregistered voters in Texas. Id. at 663.\n      The district court likewise concluded that SB 14 disproportionately\nimpacts the poor, who are disproportionately minorities. Id. at 664–65. It\ncredited expert testimony that 21.4% of eligible voters earning less than\n$20,000 per year lack SB 14 ID, compared to only 2.6% of voters earning\nbetween $100,000 and $150,000 per year.           Id. at 664.     Lower income\nrespondents were also more likely to lack the underlying documents to get an\nEIC. Id. Dr. Jane Henrici, an anthropologist and professorial lecturer at\nGeorge Washington University, explained that:\n      [U]nreliable and irregular wage work and other income . . . affect\n      the cost of taking the time to locate and bring the requisite papers\n      and identity cards, travel to a processing site, wait through the\n      assessment, and get photo identifications. This is because most\n      job opportunities do not include paid sick or other paid leave;\n      taking off from work means lost income. Employed low-income\n      Texans not already in possession of such documents will struggle\n      to afford income loss from the unpaid time needed to get photo\n      identification.\nId. (alteration in original).\n      Furthermore, the court found that the poor are less likely to avail\nthemselves of services that require ID, such as obtaining credit and other\nfinancial services.   Id.   They are also less likely to own vehicles and are\ntherefore more likely to rely on public transportation. Id. at 665, 672–73. As\na result, the poor are less likely to have a driver’s license and face greater\n                                      48\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 49     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nobstacles in obtaining photo identification. Id. Even obtaining an EIC poses\nan obstacle—the district court credited evidence that hundreds of thousands of\nvoters face round-trip travel times of 90 minutes or more to the nearest location\nissuing EICs. Id. at 672. Of eligible voters without access to a vehicle, a large\npercentage faced trips of three hours or more to obtain an EIC. 44 Id.\n       (b) The State’s Challenges to the District Court’s Analysis\n       Although the State does not dispute the underlying factual findings, it\nidentifies several purported legal errors in the district court’s decision. We\naddress only the most relevant challenges at length herein. 45 We conclude that\n\n\n\n       44 Before the panel, the State attacked the entirety of the district court’s findings on\nthe grounds that the lower court did not distinguish between SB 14’s statutory provisions\nand the Department of Public Safety’s implementing regulations. Although an issue raised\nfor the first time on appeal, like this one, is waived, Fruge v. Amerisure Mut. Ins. Co., 663\nF.3d 743, 747 (5th Cir. 2011), this argument likewise fails on the merits. The State’s proposed\nrule of law would contradict both Gingles’s demand that courts take a “functional view of the\npolitical process” in assessing Section 2 claims, 478 U.S. at 45, 48 n.15, and Section 2’s\nlanguage itself, which proscribes voting practices “imposed or applied” such that they produce\na discriminatory result, 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). Moreover, we have previously affirmed a\ndistrict court’s finding of discriminatory impact where the district court found the law\ndelegated too much discretion to local officials. See Operation Push, 932 F.2d at 404.\n       45 Other challenges brought by the State include its argument that that the analyses\nrelied upon by the district court are unreliable because one source of data—the State’s voter\nregistration database—does not list the race or ethnicity of voters. The State contends that\nPlaintiffs’ expert should have relied instead on data provided by the Department of Public\nSafety (“DPS”). The district court rightly rejected this argument. The DPS database did not\nallow registrants to identify themselves as “Hispanic” until May 2010. As the Texas Director\nof Elections conceded, the number of Hispanic registered voters is “exponentially higher”\nthan the DPS records would suggest. We cannot fault the district court for refusing to rely\non inaccurate data, particularly in light of the State’s failure to maintain accurate data.\n        Additionally, the State suggests that conveying the disparity in ID possession in\ncomparative percentages is misleading. See Frank, 768 F.3d at 755 n.3 (stating that\npurveying data as a comparative percentage is a “misuse” that “produces a number of little\nrelevance to the problem”). Instead, the State believes a less deceptive method is to state\nthat 2% of Anglo, 5.9% of Hispanic, and 8.1% of African-American registered voters lack SB\n14 ID. Even assuming the State is correct, conveying the disparities in the way the State\nsuggests does not change the analysis. The district court did not err in concluding that SB\n14 disproportionately impacts Hispanic and African-American voters.\n                                              49\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 50     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nthe district court did not reversibly err in determining that SB 14 violates\nSection 2 by disparately impacting minority voters.\n       First, the State disputes the propriety of using statistical analyses to\ndetermine the racial composition of the No-Match List. Relying on Bartlett v.\nStrickland, 556 U.S. 1, 17–18 (2009), the State argues that the Supreme Court\nforeclosed using statistical analysis to determine the racial composition of a\ngroup of voters. That is a mischaracterization. Strickland cautions against\nadopting standards that require judges to make complicated, race-based\npredictions in redistricting cases, a concern that is not implicated here. Id. It\nis well within the district court’s purview to assess whether minorities are\ndisproportionately affected by a change in the law based on statistical\nanalyses. See, e.g., Operation Push, 932 F.2d at 410–11. Using accepted\nstatistical methodologies to estimate the racial composition of Texas voters\ndoes not require the type of race-based predictions that the Court referenced\nin Strickland. 46 Instead, this case is more akin to Operation Push, in which\nthis court approved using surveys and “independent statistical tests” to project\nthe impact on minorities of newly enacted voter registration procedures. Id.\n\n\n\n\n       Finally, the State argues for the first time on appeal that there is no disparate impact\nwhere, as here, the gross number of Anglos without SB 14 ID—296,156 people—almost totals\nthe number of African-American, Hispanic, and “other” voters without SB 14 ID—312,314\npeople. Courts have never required the gross number of affected minority voters to exceed\nthe gross number of affected Anglo voters. See, e.g., League of Women Voters, 769 F.3d at\n233; see also Frank, 768 F.3d at 753–54 (comparing the percentage of minority voters without\nqualifying ID to the percentage of Anglos without such ID). We decline to address this\nargument raised for the first time on appeal. See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., 183 F.3d\n339, 341–42 (5th Cir. 1999).\n       46These problematic predictions included inquiries like: “What types of candidates\nhave white and minority voters supported together in the past and will those trends\ncontinue?” Strickland, 556 U.S. at 17.\n                                              50\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 51   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\n      Second, the State relies on Strickland to argue that the canon of\nconstitutional avoidance militates against requiring the State to ensure that\nvoters of various races possess voter ID in equal measure. See 556 U.S. at 18.\nThe district court’s discriminatory effect finding, if affirmed, would do no such\nthing, nor does Section 2 mandate the sort of remedy to which the State objects.\nSection 2 merely prohibits the State from imposing burdens on minority voters\nthat would disproportionately abridge their ability to participate in the\npolitical process. Cf. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys.\nProject, Inc. (“Inclusive Communities”), 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2524 (2015) (“Remedial\norders in disparate-impact cases should concentrate on the elimination of the\noffending practice . . . .   If additional measures are adopted, courts should\nstrive to design them to eliminate racial disparities through race-neutral\nmeans. Remedial orders that impose racial targets or quotas might raise more\ndifficult constitutional questions.” (citation omitted)).\n      Finally, before our full court, the State refined its argument that our\nholding that SB 14 violates Section 2 would make Section 2 “invalid as no\nlonger congruent and proportional to the Fifteenth Amendment.” Relatedly,\nthe State and dissenting opinions characterize the district court’s findings as\nresting solely on a statistical disparity in SB 14 ID rates, rather than any\nconcrete proof that voters were denied the right to vote. These arguments miss\nthe mark. In particular, the constitutionality argument by the State is short\nsighted and ignores the history and text of the Fifteenth Amendment. If the\nState had its way, the Fifteenth Amendment and Section 2 would only prohibit\noutright denial of the right to vote and overtly purposeful discrimination. Yet,\nboth the Fifteenth Amendment and Section 2 also explicitly prohibit\nabridgement of the right to vote. U.S. CONST. amend. XV; 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a).\nApplication of the Gingles factors then determines whether any such\n                                        51\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 52     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nabridgement is linked to social and historical conditions of discrimination such\nthat the abridgement has occurred “on account of race.” U.S. CONST. amend.\nXV; 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). The standards we apply here, and our manner of\napplying them, show that Section 2’s protections remain closely tied to the\npower granted Congress by the Fifteenth Amendment. 47\n       Regarding the district court’s findings, they rest on far more than a\nstatistical disparity. The district court’s lengthy opinion goes through the\nevidence supporting its findings in great detail, and we will not repeat all of\nthat evidence here for the sake of clarity and brevity. See Veasey v. Perry, 71\nF. Supp. 3d at 665, 667–77. However, a few examples show that the district\ncourt relied on concrete evidence regarding the excessive burdens faced by\nPlaintiffs in making its findings. This evidence personified the expert analysis\ncredited by the district court regarding SB 14’s discriminatory effect.\n\n\n\n\n       47  Additionally, we note that this court and many others have upheld the\nconstitutional validity of the Section 2 results test. See, e.g., Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. at 990–\n91 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (collecting cases assuming Section 2’s constitutionality); Jones,\n727 F.2d at 373–74; United States v. Blaine Cty., 363 F.3d 897, 904–05 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(holding that the court remains bound to the Supreme Court’s prior affirmance of Section 2’s\nconstitutionality and noting that “when the Supreme Court first announced the congruence-\nand-proportionality doctrine in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997), it twice pointed\nto the [Voting Rights Act] as the model for appropriate prophylactic legislation” and that the\nSupreme Court continues to rely on the Voting Rights Act as the baseline for congruent and\nproportional legislation); Johnson v. Hamrick, 196 F.3d 1216, 1219 n.3 (11th Cir. 1999)\n(reaffirming the constitutionality of Section 2). We previously held that “[c]ongressional\npower to adopt prophylactic measures to vindicate the purposes of the fourteenth and\nfifteenth Amendments is unquestioned” and “[o]n those occasions when the Court has\nstricken enactments as exceeding congressional power under the enforcement clauses of the\nfourteenth or fifteenth amendments, the congressional objective has usually deviated from\nthe central purposes of those amendments—to ensure black equality.” Jones, 727 F.2d at\n373–74 (citations omitted). Section 2, as applied here, does not deviate from that purpose,\nand Jones still binds us. Cf. Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S.\n477, 484 (1989).\n                                              52\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 53     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\n       (c) Evidence of the Burdens Imposed on Plaintiffs by SB 14\n        The individual Plaintiffs testified that they faced many specific burdens\nin attempting to obtain SB 14 ID or vote. The district court found that “[t]he\nPlaintiffs [d]emonstrate[d] the [i]mpact” of SB 14 along several axes, including:\n(1) the difficulty of obtaining an EIC and voting with the proper ID because of\nTexas’s poor implementation of this program; (2) the cost of underlying\ndocuments necessary to obtain an EIC or other SB 14 ID; (3) difficulties with\ndelayed, nonexistent, out-of-state, or amended birth certificates due to\nnontraditional births and errors on birth certificates; (4) long distances and\nother travel issues that made getting to a registrar and DPS office problematic\nfor many Plaintiffs; (5) a strict disability exemption 48; and (6) a burdensome\nalternative of voting absentee. See id. Some of the Plaintiffs faced difficulties\nalong multiple axes in attempting to get SB 14 ID and vote in person.\n\n\n\n\n       48   SB 14 exempts certain disabled persons from its photo ID requirements, if they\nsubmit an application to be exempted with written documentation, including: (1) “a\nstatement in a form prescribed by the secretary of state that the applicant does not have a\nform of identification acceptable” under SB 14’s codified provision, TEX. ELEC. CODE\n§ 63.0101, and (2) documentation from either “the United States Social Security\nAdministration evidencing the applicant has been determined to have a disability,” or\ndocumentation “from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs evidencing the\napplicant has a disability rating of at least 50 percent.” TEX. ELEC. CODE § 13.002(i). The\ndistrict court found that Plaintiffs Carrier, Espinoza, Mendez, and Taylor “may qualify for\nSB 14’s disability exemption,” but that “[t]hese Plaintiffs were not made aware of this\nexemption when they went to DPS or other relevant offices” and that “[a]s of January 15,\n2014, only 18 voters were granted a disability exemption in Texas.” Veasey v. Perry, 71 F.\nSupp. 3d at 674 (citing TEX. ELEC. CODE § 13.002(i)). This fact evidences the increased\nburden SB 14 places on Plaintiffs and others on the No-Match List because of the lack of\nfunding devoted to educating voters. Although this is not an overwhelming burden in and of\nitself, the requirement and poor implementation provide one more obstacle for disabled\nplaintiffs to clear in attempting to vote in person without SB 14 ID. In this case, some of the\nPlaintiffs who could have used this exception were turned away at the polls and were never\nmade aware of it.\n                                             53\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530        Page: 54     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\n       First, the record evidence disproves the State’s claim that “the plaintiffs\nhave failed to identify a single individual who faces a substantial obstacle to\nvoting because of SB 14.” 49 For one thing, the district court found that multiple\nPlaintiffs were turned away when they attempted to vote, and some of those\nPlaintiffs were not offered provisional ballots to attempt to resolve the issue.\nId. at 668. One of those Plaintiffs, Floyd Carrier, “was well-known to the\nelection workers at his polling place, but was not offered a provisional ballot\nand was not permitted to cast a vote.” Id.          Floyd Carrier had the help of his\nson in attempting to obtain SB 14 ID, but they faced an almost impossible\nbureaucratic morass when they tried to get the required underlying\ndocumentation. Due to these obstacles and the lack of training and education\nabout SB 14’s requirements, Floyd Carrier was completely prevented from\nvoting. See id. at 668 & n.268 (noting that throughout their efforts to obtain\nunderlying documentation and qualifying ID for Floyd Carrier, no one\ninformed the Carriers about the EIC).\n       Plaintiff Bates faced a similar problem when she reported to the polls, as\nshe was unaware that her existing ID was insufficient until she attempted to\nvote in person. At that point, it was too late to cast an absentee ballot, and she\nwas not able to obtain SB 14 ID in time to cure her provisional ballot because\nshe could not afford to purchase her Mississippi birth certificate at its $42 cost\non her $321 fixed monthly income. Id. at 649 & n.115, 665. Plaintiff Gordon\nBenjamin was not able to obtain an EIC at the DPS because he was unable to\nget his Louisiana birth certificate for the hefty $81 fee online. Eventually, his\n\n\n\n       49 Before the panel that initially heard this case, the State made an even bolder\nclaim—that the Plaintiffs “failed to show that SB 14 prevented a single person from voting.”\nThis claim is demonstrably false, as the experiences of Plaintiffs Floyd Carrier and Sammie\nLouise Bates show, see infra.\n                                            54\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530           Page: 55     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nsister was able to get his birth certificate in person on a trip through Louisiana,\nbut he was unable to make that trip before the 2013 elections. Id. at 671, 673.\nBenjamin cast a provisional ballot that went uncured. Many more stories like\nthese proliferate in the pages of the district court’s opinion. Id. at 667–77.\n       Traveling to DPS offices to obtain EICs posed an additional obstacle for\nmany Plaintiffs.       The district court found that four Plaintiffs rely almost\nexclusively on public transportation. One of these Plaintiffs, Ken Gandy, faces\nan hour-long, one-way trip to reach the nearest DPS office. See id. at 673.\nPlaintiffs Estrada and Espinoza use family and friends for transportation, but\nthey each face “a 60-mile roundtrip ride to the nearest DPS station.” Id.\n       The State failed to contest any of this evidence, except to suggest that\nthese Plaintiffs could vote by mail. The district court did not clearly err in\nfinding that mail-in voting is not an acceptable substitute for in-person voting\nin the circumstances presented by this case. 50 We are by no means criticizing\nTexas for making mail-in voting available, as it represents an important bridge\nfor many who would otherwise have difficulty appearing in person. Instead,\nwe conclude that it is not the equivalent of in-person voting for those who are\nable and want to vote in person. Mail-in voting involves a complex procedure\nthat cannot be done at the last minute. See id. at 688–90 (describing the\ncomplex process of obtaining and submitting a mail-in ballot). 51                        It also\ndeprives voters of the help they would normally receive in filling out ballots at\n\n\n       50 We do not opine on the effect, under Section 2, of other possible absentee balloting\narrangements, only on the inadequacy of mail-in voting in these circumstances to mitigate or\neliminate the discriminatory impact of SB 14.\n       51  For example, mail-in voting requires obtaining and submitting a correctly filled-\nout and signed application to the early voting clerk in the voter’s county “on or before the\n18th day before election day,” TEX. ELEC. CODE § 86.008(a), plus receiving an absentee ballot\nby mail, filling out the ballot correctly, and ensuring the proper state party receives the ballot\non or before election day, id. §§ 86.004–.007, 86.008(b).\n                                               55\n\f    Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 56    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nthe polls, which Plaintiff Naomi Eagleton cited as a reason why she prefers to\nvote in person. Id. at 689.\n      Elderly plaintiffs may also face difficulties getting to their mailboxes,\nlike Plaintiff Carrier, who has to be driven to his mailbox because it is at the\nlocal post office. Id. at 673. Seven of the Plaintiffs further testified they are\nreluctant to vote by mail due to the increased risk of fraud because of people\nwho harvest mail-in ballots from the elderly. Id. at 676–77. The district court\ncredited expert testimony showing mail-in ballot fraud is a significant threat—\nunlike in-person voter fraud. Id. at 639–41, 676. Finally, with mail-in voting,\nvoters lose the ability to account for last-minute developments, like candidates\ndropping out of a primary race, or targeted mailers and other information\ndisseminated right before the election. Id. at 689. We discern no clear error\nin the district court’s finding that mail-in voting for specific subsets of Texas\nvoters does not sufficiently mitigate the burdens imposed by SB 14.\n      The State further claims SB 14 has no disparate impact because the\nState offers “free” EICs, and after SB 983, free underlying documentation to\nTexas voters who were born in Texas. Yet, the record is replete with evidence\nthat the State devoted little funding or attention to educating voters about the\nnew voter ID requirements, resulting in many Plaintiffs lacking information\nabout these supposed accommodations until they were informed about them\nduring the course of this lawsuit. See, e.g., id. at 667–69, 676 (describing the\n“insufficient” implementation of the EIC program, the fact that many Plaintiffs\ndid not know about the EIC or required voter ID until being turned away at\nthe polls, that one Plaintiff paid $22 for his birth certificate because he was not\ntold about the reduced-cost alternative then available, and other issues with\nthe implementation of SB 14). We find no clear error in the district court’s\n\n\n                                        56\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 57      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nfinding that the State’s lackluster educational efforts resulted in additional\nburdens on Texas voters. 52 See, e.g., id. at 668.\n       We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that SB\n14 imposes significant and disparate burdens on the right to vote.\n       3. The Gingles Factors\n       We next consider the district court’s finding that SB 14 “produces a\ndiscriminatory result that is actionable because [it] . . . interact[s] with social\nand historical conditions in Texas to cause an inequality in the electoral\nopportunities enjoyed by African–Americans and Hispanic voters.” Id. at 698.\nThe district court found Gingles factors 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 probative. Id. at\n697.    Again, we conclude it was proper to utilize the Gingles factors to\ndetermine whether conditions engendered by current and former state-\nsponsored discrimination are sufficiently linked to the racial disparity in ID\npossession under SB 14.\n\n\n       52  These lackluster efforts stand in stark contrast to those of other states whose voter\nID laws have thus far passed Section 2 scrutiny. See, e.g., N.C. State Conference of the\nNAACP v. McCrory, ___ F. 3d ___, No. 1:13CV658, 2016 WL 1650774, at *19–20 (M.D.N.C.\nApr. 25, 2016) (cataloging the myriad educational efforts of North Carolina, including:\neducation at three elections before the law went into effect; having voters sign a ledger if they\nlacked required ID; targeted mailings and outreach to those voters and over 200,000 others\non North Carolina’s no-match list; pre-paid return mailers to obtain assistance for voters\nlacking required ID; and further updated advertisement, targeted mailing, and outreach\nafter a reasonable impediment exception was enacted); Common Cause/Ga. v. Billups, 504\nF. Supp. 2d 1333, 1378–79 (N.D. Ga. 2007) (holding that the state of Georgia’s educational\nefforts were crucial to whether Georgia’s voter ID law unduly burdened voters, that the court\ninitially granted a preliminary injunction in part due to lack of notice and education, and\nfinding that voters had since been educated after Georgia ran advertisements and directly\ncontacted voters who potentially lacked valid IDs to inform them about how to get valid ID\nor vote absentee), vacated in part on other grounds, 554 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir. 2009). Contrary\nto the State’s hyperbolic predictions, these different outcomes show the importance of the\nfact-bound Section 2 analysis we employ here. It has resulted in the approval of laws less\nburdensome and less discriminatory in effect than SB 14, while it holds the State of Texas\naccountable for the strictest and perhaps most poorly implemented voter ID law in the\ncountry. See, e.g., Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 667–69, 676 (noting the many problems\nwith the implementation of SB 14).\n                                              57\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530           Page: 58     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       (a) Gingles Factor 1: History of Official Discrimination\n       As part of this “searching practical evaluation of the past and present\nreality,” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 (citation omitted), the district court found that\nTexas’s history of discrimination in voting acted in concert with SB 14 to limit\nminorities’ ability to participate in the political process. We repeat Shelby\nCounty’s admonishment that “history did not end in 1965,” 133 S. Ct. at 2628,\nand emphasize that contemporary examples of discrimination are more\nprobative than historical examples. However, even long-ago acts of official\ndiscrimination give context to the analysis, 53 and the district court credited\nmore contemporary examples of state-sponsored discrimination. Veasey v.\nPerry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 635–36, 700. One contemporary example is the district\ncourt’s finding that “[i]n every redistricting cycle since 1970, Texas has been\nfound to have violated the VRA with racially gerrymandered districts.” Id. at\n636 & n.23 (collecting cases). The district court further noted that, before it\nwas vacated along with preclearance by Shelby County, “a three-judge court\n\n\n       53  The district court cited many examples of Texas’s long history of state-sponsored\ndiscrimination. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 633–36. Less recent examples include\nall-white primary elections that persisted from 1895 to 1944 despite the Supreme Court\nattempting to curb the practice in 1927, literacy and secret ballot restrictions that persisted\nuntil struck down in 1970, and poll taxes that were eventually struck down in 1966. Id. at\n633–35. When the poll tax was made unconstitutional in 1964 by the Twenty-Fourth\nAmendment, Texas attempted to separate federal and state ballots, so that the State could\nstill impose a poll tax for state ballots. That effort never succeeded because it was struck\ndown as unconstitutional after the Voting Rights Act was passed and applied to Texas.\nEventually, Texas ratified the Twenty-Fourth Amendment in 2009. In the wake of Texas’s\ninability to retain poll taxes, the district court found that Texas passed a voter re-registration\nrequirement in 1966 that persisted in the form of purging the voter rolls after re-registration\nwas ruled unconstitutional in the early 1970s. Id. at 635. Ultimately, the purging practice\nwas enjoined under the preclearance portions of the Voting Rights Act. Id. While long-ago\nhistory of discrimination is of limited probative value when considering whether the\nLegislature acted with discriminatory intent, it cannot be ignored in the discriminatory effect\nanalysis, because even these seemingly remote instances of State-sponsored discrimination\ncontinue to produce socioeconomic conditions that the district court found caused the racial\ndisparities in possession of SB 14 ID.\n                                               58\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 59     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nhad found that two of Texas’s 2011 redistricting plans violated the VRA.” Id.\nat 636 n.23. In other words, the 2011 Texas Legislature was found to have\nviolated the Voting Rights Act by passing two redistricting plans that were\nfound to have a retrogressive or racially discriminatory impact in the same\nlegislative session that resulted in SB 14. 54\n       The district court found that these past instances of discrimination, all\nthe way through the 2011 legislative session that produced SB 14, were\nrelevant in part because each time, “the Texas Legislature relied on the\njustification that its discriminatory measures were necessary to combat voter\nfraud.” Id. at 636. The Texas Legislature relied on that same justification in\npassing SB 14, even though the evidence showed that in-person voter fraud “is\nvery rare.” Id.\n       Even acknowledging that long-ago evidence of discrimination has less\nforce than more contemporary evidence under Shelby County, this factor and\nother factors support the district court’s finding that SB 14 has a\ndiscriminatory effect.\n       (b) Gingles Factor 2: Racially Polarized Voting\n       The district court relied primarily on the testimony of Dr. Barry Burden,\na political science professor, and Mr. George Korbel, an expert on voting rights,\n\n\n\n       54  Of course, the preclearance analysis differs from the Section 2 discriminatory effect\nanalysis. The State had the burden to show it should receive preclearance in Texas v. Holder,\nwhereas the Plaintiffs have the burden to show a discriminatory effect in the analysis we\nemploy here. Cf. Texas v. Holder, 888 F. Supp. 2d 113, 117 (D.D.C. 2012) (noting that the\npreclearance analysis places the burden on the State to prove that a law does not have “‘the\neffect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race’—i.e. . . . a retrogressive\neffect”), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 133 S. Ct. 2886 (2013). One of the\ndissenting opinions seeks to discredit this case because it was vacated after Shelby County\nwas decided. However, the opinion was not vacated on the merits and remains factually\nrelevant as a contemporary example of State-sponsored discrimination based on the finding\nof a three-judge federal court.\n                                              59\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 60      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nin concluding that racially polarized voting exists throughout Texas. The court\nstated that “[r]acially polarized voting exists when the race or ethnicity of a\nvoter correlates with the voter’s candidate preference.”                  Id. at 637 (citing\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 53 n.21). For support, the district court noted that the gap\nbetween Anglo and Latino Republican support is between 30 and 40 percentage\npoints, the Supreme Court has previously acknowledged the existence of\nracially polarized voting in Texas, and that in other litigation, Texas has\nconceded that racially polarized voting exists in 252 of its 254 counties. Id. at\n637–38. The State did not contest these findings before the district court. 55\n        (c) Gingles Factor 5: Effects of Past Discrimination\n       Next, the district court appraised “[t]he extent to which members of the\nminority group . . . bear the effects of discrimination in areas such as\neducation, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate\neffectively in the political process.” Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 696\n(citing Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45). The disparity in education, employment, and\nhealth outcomes between Anglos, African Americans, and Hispanics is\nmanifest by the fact that the 29% of African Americans and 33% of Hispanics\nin Texas live below the poverty line compared to 12% of Anglos. Id. at 665.\nThe unemployment rate for Anglos is also significantly lower. At trial, the\ncourt found that 6.1% of Anglos were unemployed compared to 8.5% of\nHispanics and 12.8% of African Americans. Id. at 666. Furthermore, 91.7% of\nAnglo 25-year-olds in Texas have graduated from high school, compared to\n\n\n\n       55  For the first time in its reply brief before the panel that initially heard this case,\nthe State argued that the district court erred by examining whether race and voting patterns\nexhibited a correlated, rather than causal, link. We generally do not consider arguments\nraised for the first time in a reply brief. See Baris v. Sulpicio Lines, 932 F.2d 1540, 1546 n.9\n(5th Cir. 1991). The State has not renewed this argument before our full court and we will\nnot consider it.\n                                              60\n\f    Case: 14-41127         Document: 00513601530        Page: 61    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\n85.4% of African Americans, and only 58.6% of Hispanics. Id. Anglos are also\nsignificantly more likely to have completed college—33.7% of Anglos hold a\nbachelor’s degree, compared to 19.2% of African Americans and 11.4% of\nHispanics.       Id. Finally, the district court credited testimony that African\nAmericans and Hispanics are more likely than Anglos to report being in poor\nhealth, and to lack health insurance. Id. at 666–67.\n         The    district   court   found   that   the     history   of   State-sponsored\ndiscrimination led to these disparities in education, employment, housing, and\ntransportation. See id. at 636. For example, according to Dr. Vernon Burton,\na professor with an expertise in race relations, past State-sponsored\nemployment discrimination and Texas’s maintenance of a “separate but equal”\neducation system both contributed to the unequal outcomes that presently\nexist.    Id.   Although Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),\nmandated desegregated schools in 1954, Dr. Burton testified that Texas\nmaintained segregated schools until roughly 1970. Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp.\n3d at 666 & n.258. “As a result” of systemic discrimination and the disparities\nin education, employment, housing, and transportation, the district court\nfound that “Hispanics and African–Americans make up a disproportionate\nnumber of people living in poverty, and thus have little real choice when it\ncomes to spending money on anything that is not a necessity.” Id. at 636\n(footnote omitted).\n         Importantly, the district court also found that “[t]hese socioeconomic\ndisparities have hindered the ability of African–Americans and Hispanics to\neffectively participate in the political process. Dr. Ansolabehere testified that\nthese minorities register and turn[ ]out for elections at rates that lag far behind\n\n\n\n\n                                           61\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 62     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nAnglo voters.” 56 Id. at 697. This is significant because the inquiry in Section 2\ncases is whether the vestiges of discrimination act in concert with the\nchallenged law to impede minority participation in the political process. See\nLeague of United Latin Am. Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 999 F.2d\n831, 866–67 (5th Cir. 1993) (en banc). The district court concluded in the\naffirmative, and the State does not contest these underlying factual findings\non appeal.\n       The district court ultimately found:\n       SB 14’s voter ID requirements interact with social and historical\n       conditions in Texas to cause an inequality in the electoral\n       opportunities enjoyed by African–Americans and Hispanic voters\n       as compared to Anglo voters. In other words, SB 14 does not\n       disproportionately impact African–Americans and Hispanics by\n       mere chance. Rather, it does so by its interaction with the vestiges\n       of past and current racial discrimination.\nVeasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 698 (emphasis added).\n       Again, the State does not dispute the underlying data or methodologies.\nInstead, the State objects that the district court must have found some\nevidence that SB 14 directly caused a reduction in turnout. The State insists\nthat the district court erred by failing to ask whether SB 14 causes a racial\nvoting disparity, rather than a disparity in voter ID possession. We have never\nrequired such a showing. Section 2 asks whether a standard, practice, or\nprocedure results in “a denial or abridgement of the right . . . to vote.” 52 U.S.C.\n§ 10301(a).     Abridgement is defined as “[t]he reduction or diminution of\n\n\n       56According to Dr. Ansolabehere’s expert report, 83 to 87% of Anglos of voting age and\n84 to 88% of Anglo citizens of voting age in Texas are registered to vote, compared to 65 to\n77% of Blacks of voting age and 75 to 80% of Black citizens of voting age, and 50 to 55% of\nHispanics of voting age and 75 to 80% of Hispanic citizens of voting age. Likewise, 41.8% of\nAnglos voted in 2010 compared to 31.3% of Blacks and 22% of Hispanics. In 2012, 64.3% of\nregistered Anglos voted, compared to 45% of registered Blacks and 59.8% of registered\nHispanics.\n                                             62\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530         Page: 63   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\nsomething,” Abridgement, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014), while the\nVoting Rights Act defines “vote” to include “all action necessary to make a vote\neffective including, but not limited to, registration or other action required by\nState law prerequisite to voting, casting a ballot, and having such ballot\ncounted.” 52 U.S.C. § 10101(e). The district court’s finding that SB 14 abridges\nthe right to vote by causing a racial disparity in voter ID possession falls\ncomfortably within this definition. Our case law dictates the same outcome.\nSee Operation Push, 932 F.2d at 409, 413 (affirming the district court’s finding\nthat a voter registration law violated Section 2 when it resulted in a 25%\ndifference in the registration rates between eligible black and white voters);\nsee also Chisom, 501 U.S. at 408 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“If, for example, a\ncounty permitted voter registration for only three hours one day a week, and\nthat made it more difficult for blacks to register than whites, blacks would have\nless opportunity ‘to participate in the political process’ than whites, and\n[Section] 2 would therefore be violated . . . .”).\n      For the same reason, we decline to require a showing of lower turnout to\nprove a Section 2 violation. An election law may keep some voters from going\nto the polls, but in the same election, turnout by different voters might increase\nfor some other reason. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 655 (discussing\nthe effect of President Obama’s candidacy on voter turnout). That does not\nmean the voters kept away were any less disenfranchised.                Requiring a\nshowing of lower turnout also presents problems for pre-election challenges to\nvoting laws, when no such data is yet available. More fundamentally, no\nauthority supports requiring a showing of lower turnout, since abridgement of\nthe right to vote is prohibited along with denial. U.S. CONST. amend. XV; 52\nU.S.C. § 10301(a). Illuminating this last point is the State’s answer at oral\nargument to a question about whether its proposed Section 2 effects test would\n                                         63\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 64     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nprohibit literacy tests (if they were not otherwise specifically prohibited) from\nbeing imposed as a condition for voting. 57 The State contended that literacy\ntests “would almost certainly” be struck down under its proposed Section 2\neffects test—but only if plaintiffs could show a resulting “denial of equal\nopportunity,” i.e., a “voter turnout disparity.” 58\n       We decline to cripple the Voting Rights Act by using the State’s proposed\nanalysis. Doing so would unmoor the Voting Rights Act from its history and\ndecades of well-established interpretations about its protections. See Allen,\n393 U.S. at 565 (“The Voting Rights Act was aimed at the subtle, as well as the\nobvious, state regulations which have the effect of denying citizens their right\n\n\n       57 In full, the exchange between a member of our court at the en banc oral argument\nand the State’s counsel follows:\n               JUDGE: “[I]f literacy tests weren’t separately prohibited, would a\n      literacy test be invalidated by your proposed equal treatment test?”\n               STATE’S COUNSEL: “Insofar as literacy tests, you know, first of all,\n      that would obviously be separately banned under —”\n               JUDGE: “Beside[s] the separate ban.”\n               STATE’S COUNSEL: “I–I believe insofar as you’re putting aside the\n      separate banning, and insofar as you’re putting aside a purpose claim, I think\n      you would still ask, ‘is this a denial of equal opportunity?’ And in that scenario\n      you’d have to show a prima facie case, and it would almost certainly, in the\n      relevant jurisdictions that we’re talking about, have been able to show a voter\n      turnout disparity, ah, particularly, you know, Operation Push v. Mabus would\n      have been another case like this where you had legacy systems in place, and\n      under those legacy systems, there would have been liability.”\n       58  One of the dissenting opinions would require a showing of decreased turnout to\nprevail on a discriminatory effect claim. This argument is unsupported by case law and\nignores the following points. First, such an approach would foreclose the ability to file pre-\nenforcement challenges, which are particularly important now that preclearance is not\nrequired. As the concurring opinion acknowledges, the Supreme Court suggested in Shelby\nCounty that courts could “block voting laws from going into effect” through injunctive relief\nunder Section 2. See Shelby Cty., 133 S. Ct. at 2619. Second, turnout itself does not answer\nthe question of a particular voter being denied access: turnout of certain people might\nincrease while turnout of others decreases, leaving overall turnout the same; yet, those\ndenied the right to vote are still disenfranchised. Third, this argument also conflates\nabridgement and denial: in previous times, some people paid the poll tax or passed the\nliteracy test and therefore voted, but their rights were still abridged.\n                                             64\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 65   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nto vote because of their race.”); Chisom, 501 U.S. at 406 (Scalia, J., dissenting)\n(“This new ‘results’ criterion [from the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights\nAct] provides a powerful, albeit sometimes blunt, weapon with which to attack\neven the most subtle forms of discrimination.”). Instead, we will adhere to the\nSupreme Court’s instruction to examine challenged laws and practices in an\nintensely fact-based and local totality-of-the-circumstances analysis.        See\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 36–38, 79.\n      Thus, while evidence of decreased turnout is relevant, it is not required\nto prove a Section 2 claim of vote denial or abridgement. In this case, the record\ncontains evidence that minority voters generally turn out in lower numbers\nthan non-minority voters and that State-sponsored discrimination created\nsocioeconomic disparities, which hinder minority voters’ general participation\nin the political process. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in\ndetermining that the impact of past and current discrimination on minorities\nin Texas favors finding that SB 14 has a discriminatory effect under Section 2.\n      (d) Gingles Factor 6: Racial Appeals in Political Campaigns\n      While the existence of racial appeals in political campaigns is a factor\nthat may be indicative of a law’s disparate impact, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at 40,\nit is not highly probative here (and racial appeals seem to have been used by\nboth minorities and non-minorities). The district court found that such appeals\nstill exist in Texas and cited anecdotal evidence to support its finding. See\nVeasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 638–39. While we do not overturn the\nunderlying factual finding, we do not agree that such anecdotal evidence of\nracial campaign appeals shows that SB 14 denies or abridges the right to vote.\n\n\n\n\n                                       65\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 66   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\n      (e) Gingles Factor 7 and Factor 8: Minority Public Officials and\n      Responsiveness to Minority Needs\n      The extent to which minority candidates are elected to public office also\ncontextualizes the degree to which vestiges of discrimination continue to\nreduce minority participation in the political process. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at\n45. The district court found that African Americans comprise 13.3% of the\npopulation in Texas, but only 1.7% of all Texas elected officials are African\nAmerican.    Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 638.       Similarly, Hispanics\ncomprise 30.3% of the population but hold only 7.1% of all elected positions.\nId. Within the Texas Legislature, however, both groups fare better—African\nAmericans hold 11.1% of seats in the Legislature while Hispanics hold 21.1%\nof seats. Id. Again, the State does not contest these findings. Id.\n      The district court also found that Texas’s history of discrimination,\ncoupled with SB 14’s effect on minorities in Texas and the Legislature’s\nresponse to ameliorative amendments, demonstrated a lack of responsiveness\nto minority needs by elected officials. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45. The evidence\nsupports the district court’s finding that “the legislature knew that minorities\nwould be most affected by the voter ID law.” Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at\n657–58.     For instance, Representative Todd Smith, a proponent of the\nlegislation, stated that it was “common sense” the law would have a\ndisproportionate effect on minorities. See id. at 657. Similarly, Bryan Hebert,\nDeputy General Counsel in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor and author\nof some of the provisions of SB 14, warned that SB 14 was unlikely to obtain\n(the now-defunct) preclearance under the Voting Rights Act without further\nforms of permissible ID. Id. at 658.\n      The district court noted that minority legislators and constituents\ntestified about the likely disparate impact of SB 14, yet their amendments to\n\n                                       66\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 67     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nameliorate that impact were rejected without explanation. See id. at 651, 658,\n669, 698, 702. These included amendments to expand the forms of acceptable\nID to include student IDs, federal IDs, state-government employee IDs,\nmeasures to fund education and training related to the law, and indigency\nexceptions. 59     Id. at 658, 708–10.        While this does not necessarily prove\nimproper intent on the part of those legislators, it nonetheless supports a\nconclusion of lack of responsiveness. 60\n      (f) Gingles Factor 9: Tenuousness of Policies Underlying the Law\n      The district court concluded that the policies underlying SB 14’s passage\nwere only tenuously related to the State’s interests in preventing fraud and\nincreasing voter confidence in elections. We do not deny that the State’s\narticulated objectives are legitimate state interests, as the Supreme Court has\nmade clear. See Crawford, 553 U.S. at 191. Yet, the articulation of a legitimate\ninterest is not a magic incantation a state can utter to avoid a finding of\ndisparate impact.        Even under the least searching standard of review we\nemploy for these types of challenges, there cannot be a total disconnect between\nthe State’s announced interests and the statute enacted. See St. Joseph Abbey\nv. Castille, 712 F.3d 215, 225–26 (5th Cir. 2013) (holding there was an\nimpermissible “disconnect” between the state’s expressed interests and the\nchallenged regulations and noting that “[t]he great deference due state\neconomic regulation does not demand judicial blindness to the history of a\nchallenged rule or the context of its adoption[,] nor does it require courts to\naccept nonsensical explanations [from the state]”); cf. Inclusive Cmtys. Project,\n\n\n\n\n      59   The indigency exception was part of SB 14 when it passed the Senate, but was\nstripped from the bill in the Texas House. Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 652.\n      60   This distinction is akin to the difference between negligence and intent.\n                                              67\n\f    Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 68    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nInc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, 747 F.3d 275, 282 (5th Cir. 2014)\n(permitting a plaintiff to prevail on disparate impact claim under the Fair\nHousing Act where he “prov[es] that the [state’s] substantial, legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory interests supporting the challenged practice could be served\nby another practice that has a less discriminatory effect”), aff’d, 135 S. Ct. 2507\n(2015).   The Court in Gingles and the Senate that passed the 1982\nAmendments to the Voting Rights Act acknowledged as much by including\ntenuousness among the factors to be considered. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45.\nAlong with elected officials’ lack of responsiveness to minority needs, a tenuous\nfit between the expressed policy and the provisions of the law bolsters the\nconclusion that minorities are not able to equally participate in the political\nprocess. Otherwise, elected officials would be more responsive regarding the\ndisparate impact of a law, and a law not meaningfully related to its expressed\npurpose would be abandoned or ameliorated to avoid imposing a disparate\nimpact, given the preexisting socioeconomic and political disadvantages caused\nby past and present discrimination.\n      The district court found that “the stated policies behind SB 14 are only\ntenuously related to its provisions.” Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 698.\nThe State is entitled to make policy choices about when and how it will address\nvarious priorities. But in this case, the provisions of SB 14 fail to correspond\nin any meaningful way to the legitimate interests the State claims to have been\nadvancing through SB 14. For example, the Legislature claimed to model its\nlaw after those from Indiana, Georgia, Wisconsin, and other states that\nincluded many more forms of acceptable identification, plus indigency\nexceptions and far more extensive educational campaigns. Yet, the Legislature\nrejected many ameliorative amendments that would have brought SB 14 in\nline with those states’ voter ID laws. See id. at 643, 658. The option of mail-\n                                        68\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 69   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nin voting also showcases the dubious connection between the State’s interests\nand SB 14’s provisions. In order to prevent voter fraud, the State has pushed\nmore vulnerable elderly voters away from in-person voting—a form of voting\nwith little proven incidence of fraud—and toward mail-in voting, which the\nrecord shows is far more vulnerable to fraud, particularly among the elderly.\nId. at 639–41, 653.    In fact, SB 14 does nothing to address the far more\nprevalent issue of fraudulent absentee ballots. Id. at 641.\n      The district court likewise found that the Legislature’s expressed\nconcerns about undocumented immigrants and noncitizens voting were\nmisplaced. It credited testimony that undocumented immigrants are unlikely\nto vote as they try to avoid contact with government agents for fear of being\ndeported. Id. at 654. At least one Representative who voted for SB 14 conceded\nthat he had no evidence to substantiate his fear of undocumented immigrants\nvoting. Id. Additionally, the district court found that SB 14 would not prevent\nnoncitizens from voting, since noncitizens can legally obtain a Texas driver’s\nlicense or concealed handgun license, two forms of SB 14 ID. Id. at 654–55.\n      The district court also found “no credible evidence” to support assertions\nthat voter turnout was low due to a lack of confidence in elections, that SB 14\nwould increase public confidence in elections, or that increased confidence\nwould boost voter turnout. Id. at 655. Two State Senators and the Director of\nthe Elections Division at the Texas Secretary of State’s office were all unaware\nof anyone abstaining from voting out of concern for voter fraud, and the\nDirector testified that implementing SB 14’s provisional ballot process might\nactually undermine voter confidence. Id.\n      Rather, the district court credited testimony that SB 14 would decrease\nvoter turnout.    Id. at 655–56.     According to a well-established formula\nemployed by political scientists to assess individuals’ likelihood of voting in an\n                                       69\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 70    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nelection, increasing the cost of voting decreases voter turnout—particularly\namong low-income individuals, as they are most cost sensitive. Id. at 656.\nFurther, the district court dismissed the argument that increased turnout\nduring the 2008 presidential election was demonstrative of increased voter\nconfidence in two states that had recently passed voter ID laws. Id. at 655.\nInstead, it found that the increased turnout, which occurred nationwide, was\ndue to President Obama’s candidacy. Id. Finally, the court also found that\npublic opinion polls—which found high levels of support for photo ID\nrequirements—were not demonstrative that SB 14 itself would promote voter\nconfidence. Id. at 656. The district court discounted the polls because they did\nnot evaluate whether voters supported SB 14 itself rather than some other\nform of voter ID law when weighed against SB 14’s exceedingly burdensome\nrequirements and attendant effect on minority voters. Id.\n      (g) Discriminatory Effect Conclusion\n      In light of its findings regarding SB 14’s disparate impact and its\napplication of the Gingles factors, the district court held that SB 14 acted in\nconcert with current and historical conditions of discrimination to diminish\nAfrican Americans’ and Hispanics’ ability to participate in the political process.\nId. at 695–98. We conclude that the district court performed the “intensely\nlocal appraisal” required by Gingles. 478 U.S. at 79. The district court clearly\ndelineated each step of its analysis, finding that:\n      (1) SB 14 specifically burdens Texans living in poverty, who are\n      less likely to possess qualified photo ID, are less able to get it, and\n      may not otherwise need it; (2) a disproportionate number of Texans\n      living in poverty are African–Americans and Hispanics; and\n      (3) African–Americans and Hispanics are more likely than Anglos\n      to be living in poverty because they continue to bear the\n      socioeconomic effects caused by decades of racial discrimination.\nVeasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 664.\n                                        70\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530           Page: 71     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       The     district    court    thoroughly       evaluated       the   “totality    of   the\ncircumstances,” each finding was well-supported, and the State has failed to\ncontest many of the underlying factual findings. Furthermore, the district\ncourt’s analysis comports with the Supreme Court’s recent instruction that “a\ndisparate-impact claim that relies on a statistical disparity must fail if the\nplaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy or policies causing that\ndisparity.” 61 Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523. The district court here\nacknowledged this principle and tethered its holding to two findings. First, the\ncourt found a stark, racial disparity between those who possess or have access\nto SB 14 ID, and those who do not. Second, it applied the Gingles factors to\nconclude that SB 14 worked in concert with Texas’s legacy of state-sponsored\ndiscrimination to bring about this disproportionate result.\n       We note that, because the district court’s findings link Texas’s state-\nsponsored history of discrimination to the conditions affecting minority voters\n\n\n\n       61   Some of the dissenting opinions argue that the majority opinion holds the\nLegislature “liable for racial disparities [it] did not create” by failing to show that the\nstatistical disparity in ID possession among different races is caused by a State policy, as\nopposed to socioeconomic and historical conditions. In fact, as discussed above, the district\ncourt found that SB 14 creates a racial disparity by requiring the use of certain IDs to vote\nthat minorities disproportionately lack. Certainly the passage of SB 14 did not cause fewer\nminorities to possess certain IDs (like driver’s licenses or concealed handgun licenses).\nRather, the district court found that socioeconomic and historical conditions contributed to\nthis disparity in ID possession, which demonstrates why historical evidence of racism is\nrelevant to the Section 2 analysis. But SB 14 itself caused minorities to disproportionately\nlack the documentation that is required to vote by dictating that the documents and IDs\nrequired would be those that minorities disproportionately lack. We cannot ignore that in\npassing SB 14, the Legislature carefully selected the types of IDs that would be required to\nvote. In doing so, the Legislature selected IDs that minorities disproportionately do not\npossess and excluded IDs that minorities possess in greater numbers, without providing\nsufficient justification for those choices. The fact that this occurred on a landscape where\nminorities are less likely to possess certain forms of ID or be able to obtain those IDs, at least\nin part as a result of past instances of State-sponsored discrimination, does not absolve the\nLegislature of responsibility. Accordingly, the district court’s conclusion that SB 14 created\nracial disparities in the possession of IDs required to vote is supported by the record.\n                                               71\n\f    Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 72    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nin Texas today, we need not and do not decide whether proof of such state-\nsponsored discrimination is required under the second part of this analysis. Cf.\nFrank, 768 F.3d at 755 (reasoning that the discrimination affecting minorities\nshould be linked to the state under the second part of the two-part analysis).\nThe evidence in this record suffices to meet even this higher standard as\nenunciated in Frank. Id.\n      We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that\nSB 14 has a discriminatory effect on minorities’ voting rights in violation of\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act. As discussed below, we remand for a\nconsideration of the appropriate remedy in light of the impending general\nelection.\n III. First and Fourteenth Amendment Burden on the Right to Vote\n      Plaintiffs argue that SB 14 also unconstitutionally burdens their right\nto vote, as forbidden by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. We decline to\ndecide this question, under the “well established principle governing the\nprudent exercise of this [c]ourt’s jurisdiction that normally th[is c]ourt will not\ndecide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to\ndispose of the case.” Escambia Cty. v. McMillan, 466 U.S. 48, 51 (1984). Since\nthe majority of the court affirms the district court’s determination that SB 14\nhas a discriminatory effect under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, Plaintiffs\nwill be entitled to the same relief they could access if they prevailed on these\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment claims. See Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d\n1398, 1409–10 (7th Cir. 1984) (“There appears to be no difference in the\npractical result or in the available remedy regardless of how the resulting\ndiscrimination is characterized. We therefore shall not explicitly decide the\nissue of a fourteenth amendment violation . . . .”); cf. Nw. Austin Mun. Util.\n\n\n                                        72\n\f    Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530        Page: 73    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-41127\nDist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 205–06 (2009). Put another way, the\nrights and remedies are intertwined.\n      Accordingly, it is unnecessary for the en banc court to address this issue,\nand we need not and do not decide whether SB 14 violates the First and\nFourteenth Amendments by placing an unconstitutional burden on the right\nto vote. See Merced v. Kasson, 577 F.3d 578, 586–87 (5th Cir. 2009); Jordan v.\nCity of Greenwood, 711 F.2d 667, 668–70 (5th Cir. 1983) (quoting Spector Motor\nServ., Inc. v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101, 105 (1944)). We therefore vacate the\ndistrict court’s determination on this issue and dismiss Plaintiffs’ First and\nFourteenth Amendment claims.\n                                    IV. Poll Tax\n      The Veasey Plaintiffs 62 originally alleged that SB 14 imposed a poll tax\nin violation of the Fourteenth and Twenty-Fourth Amendments. After the\npassage of SB 983, the Veasey Plaintiffs filed a Rule 28(j) Letter with this\ncourt, stating that “SB14, as amended by SB983, is no longer a poll tax.” The\nVeasey Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that “the poll tax issue is still alive”\nbecause SB 14 operated as a poll tax for nearly two years, preventing Plaintiffs\nand others from voting, and because it will take a “long time” for Texas voters\nto “learn about and acquire free birth certificates.” Additionally, even without\nthe $2 to $3 fee, the Veasey Plaintiffs argue that the process of obtaining a free\nbirth certificate and a free EIC constitutes the kind of “burdensome alternative\nprocess” that was struck down in Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528 (1965).\nBefore our full court, the Veasey Plaintiffs continue to argue that we should\n\n\n\n      62  The Veasey Plaintiffs include: Marc Veasey, Jane Hamilton, Sergio Deleon, Floyd\nCarrier, Anna Burns, Michael Montez Penny Pope, Oscar Ortiz, Koby Ozias, League of\nUnited Latin American Citizens, John Mellor-Crummey, Ken Gandy, Gordon Benjamin, and\nEvelyn Brickner. No other plaintiff joined in making this allegation.\n                                           73\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 74      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\naffirm the district court’s poll tax ruling.\n       To the extent that the Veasey Plaintiffs have not abandoned or conceded\nthis claim, 63 we conclude that SB 14, as amended by SB 983, does not impose\na poll tax. Although SB 983 was passed when this case was already on appeal,\nwe do not need to remand this issue to the district court for two reasons: (1) we\nconclude that even before SB 983, SB 14 did not create a facial poll tax; and\n(2) the issue of SB 983’s impact on the poll tax issue is a pure question of law\n(at least as far as this facial challenge) that does not necessitate any\nreweighing of evidence or consideration of new evidence.\n       The Veasey Plaintiffs previously facially challenged SB 14 with\nrespect to Texas voters born out of state (who are unaffected by SB 983’s\npassage). Those voters could face fees in their state of birth to obtain\ndocumentation required for an EIC. We conclude that SB 14 does not\nfacially impose a poll tax on those voters. Rather, SB 14 requires all Texas\nvoters to present valid identification at the polls, exercising the State’s\n“legitimate interest in assessing the eligibility and qualifications of voters.”\nGonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 408–10 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc); see also\nHarper v. Va. Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 668 (1966) (“But we must\nremember that the interest of the State, when it comes to voting, is limited to\nthe power to fix qualifications.”). The indirect cost on voters born out of state\ndoes not constitute a poll tax. 64 Cf. Harman, 380 U.S. at 541 (“Thus, in order\n\n\n\n       63 Cf. Ray v. United Parcel Serv., 587 F. App’x 182, 186 (5th Cir. 2014) (noting plaintiff\n“affirmatively abandoned [his Title VII] claim on appeal by conceding” that he had not\nestablished pretext for racial discrimination).\n       64 Only one plaintiff, Ken Gandy, showed that he was unable to obtain an out-of-state\nbirth certificate due to its cost, see Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 671, but he was able to\nvote by mail, id. at 677. Accordingly, Ken Gandy has suffered no injury that we must address\nunder the poll tax rubric, and we conclude that SB 14 is not a poll tax as applied to him.\n                                              74\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 75   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nto demonstrate the invalidity of [the challenged law], it need only be shown\nthat it imposes a material requirement solely upon those who refuse to\nsurrender their constitutional right to vote in federal elections without paying\na poll tax.” (emphasis added)).\n      Likewise, SB 14 did not impose a poll tax on voters before the passage of\nSB 983. It did not “impose[] a material requirement solely upon those who\nrefuse[d]” to pay a poll tax, as proscribed by the Twenty-Fourth Amendment.\nId. at 541–42. Rather, it drew from the State’s power to set voter qualifications\nby requiring all voters to present a valid form of photo identification at the\npolls. See Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 408. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, as\nthe Supreme Court interpreted it in Harper, the Court has observed that a\nstate invidiously discriminates when it imposes a cost to vote with a\njustification that is “irrelevant to the voter’s qualifications.” Crawford, 553\nU.S. at 189.   Although the questions presented to the Supreme Court in\nCrawford did not include whether Indiana’s voter ID law imposed a poll tax,\nthe Court observed that a statute would be invalid under Harper’s Fourteenth-\nAmendment poll tax analysis “if the State required voters to pay a tax or a fee\nto obtain a new photo identification.” 553 U.S. at 198 (emphasis added). The\nCourt implied that requiring voters to obtain photo identification and charging\na fee for the required underlying documentation would not qualify as a poll tax,\nand we similarly conclude that SB 14’s similar requirements did not operate\nas a poll tax. See id. at 198 & n.17; see also Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 407–10.\n      As amended by SB 983, Texas law no longer imposes any direct fee for\nthe underlying documentation required to obtain a qualifying voter ID. What\nremain are the requirements that such voters travel to the local registrar or\ncounty clerk’s office, gather and present certain forms of documentation to\nreceive the certified record, travel to the DPS office with that record, and\n                                       75\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 76     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\npresent the certified record, along with two forms of supporting identification,\nto receive an EIC. See 37 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 15.182(3)–(4). The Veasey\nPlaintiffs appear to argue in their Rule 28(j) Letter that these obligations make\nSB 14 unconstitutional under Harman because they “requir[e] voters to follow\na burdensome alternative process to avoid paying a . . . poll tax.” 65\n       To the extent the Veasey Plaintiffs now attempt to analogize SB 14 and\nSB 983 to the scheme in Harman, we reject that analogy. In Harman, the state\nof Virginia forced those who would vote in federal elections to choose between\npaying a poll tax and meeting a registration requirement before each election\nyear. 380 U.S. at 531–32. The Virginia constitution mandated that federal\nvoters file a certificate of residence within a specific date range, beginning on\nOctober 1 of the year before the federal election at issue and ending on a date\nsix months before the date of the federal election. Id. at 532. On a notarized,\nwitnessed certificate, the federal voter had to submit a current address and\nattest to: (1) being a resident of Virginia, both at the time of submission and\nsince the date of voter registration, and (2) an intent not to move from the city\nor county of residence before the next general election. Id. Those voters who\nchose to pay federal and state poll taxes were only required to file the\ncertificate of residence one time; those who did not pay the federal poll tax had\nto file a new certificate of residence in the designated time frame before each\nelection year. Id.\n       Here, the State does not offer Texas voters a choice between paying a fee\nand undergoing an onerous procedural process. Cf. id. at 540–41. All voters\n\n\n\n       65 This is somewhat in tension with the Veasey Plaintiffs’ initial briefing before the\npanel, which claimed SB 14 was a poll tax based on the fee involved and conceded that\n“incidental burdens on voters are not taxes,” including “[i]ncidental costs such as paying for\ngas to drive to the polls.”\n                                             76\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 77   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nmust make a trip to the DPS, local registrar, county clerk, or other government\nagency at some point to receive qualifying photo identification. This record\nreveals that Plaintiffs and those who lack both SB 14 ID and underlying\ndocumentation face more difficulty than many Texas voters in obtaining SB 14\nID. Undoubtedly, those who own vehicles, have flexible work schedules, and\nalready possess the required documentation can more easily meet these\nprocedural requirements than some of the Plaintiffs and others who lack these\nresources. Plaintiffs and others similarly situated often struggle to gather the\nrequired documentation, make travel arrangements and obtain time off from\nwork to travel to the county clerk or local registrar, and then to the DPS, all to\nreceive an EIC. These greater difficulties receive consideration in the Section 2\ndiscriminatory effect analysis, but Supreme Court jurisprudence has not\nequated these difficulties, standing alone, to a poll tax. See, e.g., Harper, 383\nU.S. at 666. In Harman, the Court specifically noted:\n      [I]t is important to emphasize that the question presented is not\n      whether it would be within a State’s power to abolish entirely the\n      poll tax and require all voters—state and federal—to file annually\n      a certificate of residence. Rather, the issue here is whether the\n      State of Virginia may constitutionally confront the federal voter\n      with a requirement that he either pay the customary poll taxes as\n      required for state elections or file a certificate of residence.\n380 U.S. at 538; see also Crawford, 553 U.S. at 198–99 (contrasting the\nunconstitutionality of a requirement that voters “pay a tax or a fee to obtain a\nnew photo identification” with a requirement that voters without ID “travel to\nthe circuit court clerk’s office within 10 days [of the election] to execute the\nrequired affidavit”). Additionally, whether the qualifying identification is a\ndriver’s license, passport, or EIC, voters need not undergo this process every\nelection year during a specific time frame six months prior to the election, as\nwas the case in Harman. Instead, the record indicates that an EIC remains\n                                       77\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 78     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nvalid for six years and must only be obtained sometime before an election.\n       In light of the recently-enacted SB 983, SB 14 does not impose an\nunconstitutional      poll    tax   under     the    Fourteenth       or   Twenty-Fourth\nAmendments, nor did it impose a poll tax before SB 983’s enactment.\nAccordingly, we vacate the district court’s judgment for the Veasey Plaintiffs\non their poll tax claim and render judgment in the State’s favor.\n                                       V. Remedy\n       After finding that SB 14 was enacted with a racially discriminatory\npurpose, the district court fully enjoined SB 14’s implementation, with the\nexception of several sections of the law that do not relate to photo\nidentification. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 707 & n.583. That remedy\nis potentially broader than the one to which Plaintiffs would be entitled if only\nthe discriminatory effect claim were considered. Compare Crawford, 553 U.S.\nat 200, 203 (noting, in the Section 2 context, that “petitioners have not\ndemonstrated that the proper remedy—even assuming an unjustified burden\non some voters—would be to invalidate the entire statute”), with City of\nRichmond, 422 U.S. at 378 (holding, in the discriminatory purpose context,\nthat “[a]n official action . . . taken for the purpose of discriminating . . . on\naccount of . . . race has no legitimacy at all”), and Washington v.

Hazeltine, 461 F.3d 1011, 1022 (8th Cir.\n2006)). Yet, any remedy “should be sufficiently tailored to the circumstances\ngiving rise to the [Section] 2 violation,” id., and to the extent possible, courts\nshould respect a legislature’s policy objectives when crafting a remedy, see\nPerez, 132 S. Ct. at 940–44; see also Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2524\n(“Remedial orders in disparate-impact cases should concentrate on the\nelimination     of   the    offending   practice    that   ‘arbitrar[ily] . . . operate[s]\ninvidiously to discriminate on the basis of rac[e].’” (citation omitted)). In the\ncontext of redistricting, 67 the Supreme Court has instructed that a legislature’s\npolicy objectives may be discerned from the challenged legislation, and those\npolicy choices should be respected, even when some aspect of the underlying\nlaw is unenforceable. Perez, 132 S. Ct. at 941.\n      When a statute contains a severability clause, courts must take special\ncare to attempt to honor a legislature’s policy choice to leave the statute intact.\nSee Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New England, 546 U.S. 320, 330–31\n(2006) (holding that lower courts should not have invalidated the entire\nstatute, but should have accounted for the legislature’s policy choices and the\n\n\n\n      67   We have held that Section 2 redistricting cases provide an appropriate source of\nguidance for district courts attempting to craft remedies for Section 2 voter registration\nviolations. See Operation Push, 932 F.2d at 406. Likewise, we take guidance here from\nprecedent regarding the proper remedies for Voting Rights Act violations.\n                                            79\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530       Page: 80    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nstatute’s severability clause). In this case, SB 14’s severability clause makes\nclear that the Legislature intended the photo identification system to be left\nintact for all valid applications. 68 Also clearly underlying SB 14 is the concern\nthat a voter present proper identification that cannot easily be counterfeited\nor used by another.\n      There are times when a court might give a state legislature an\nopportunity to cure the infirmities in the statute before permitting the district\ncourt to fashion a remedy. See Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 540 (1978)\n(“When a federal court declares an existing apportionment scheme\nunconstitutional, it is therefore, appropriate, whenever practicable, to afford a\nreasonable opportunity for the legislature to meet constitutional requirements\nby adopting a substitute measure rather than for the federal court to devise\nand order into effect its own plan.” (emphasis added)); Operation Push, 932\nF.2d at 404–06 (affirming the district court after it initially issued orders\nrequiring legislative action and then deferred to the Mississippi legislature’s\ncrafted remedy in accordance with those orders); Westwego Citizens for Better\n\n\n      68   The severability clause reads:\n\n               Every provision in this Act and every application of the provisions in\n               this Act are severable from each other.

All constitutionally valid\n               applications of this Act shall be severed from any applications that a\n               court finds to be invalid, leaving the valid applications in force, because\n               it is the legislature’s intent and priority that the valid applications be\n               allowed to stand alone. Even if a reviewing court finds a provision of\n               this Act invalid in a large or substantial fraction of relevant cases, the\n               remaining valid applications shall be severed and allowed to remain in\n               force.\nTEX.

It would be untenable to permit a law\nwith a discriminatory effect to remain in operation for that election. 71 In fact,\nthe State has not asked us to permit the Legislature to reconsider SB 14 before\nthe courts fashion a remedy and, despite filing multiple briefs with this court\nin this case before and after the panel opinion, the State has never argued that\nwe must defer to the Legislature in the first instance. When counsel for the\nState was asked about this issue during oral argument before our full court,\ncounsel responded that so long as it was a “tailored, specific remedy,” he\n“believe[s] this court could fashion the remedy itself.” Upon further pressing\nby a member of the court, the State noted it also would be proper for the state\nlegislature to act first, but repeated that this court could enact a tailored\nremedy and did not advocate that this court could or should order the Texas\nGovernor to call a special session of the Legislature to craft a remedy to any\nSection 2 violation.\n       Because of the Supreme Court’s order and the impending election, we\nwould necessarily have to give only limited time for any legislative fix. Since\nthe legislature is not scheduled to be in session this year, doing so would\nrequire that the Texas Governor call a special session of the Legislature.\nAccordingly, although legislative intercession may occur, it may not be feasible,\nand we follow the Supreme Court’s guidance and permit the district court to\nenter an order that remedies SB 14’s discriminatory effects. See Wise, 437 U.S.\nat 540; see also Perez, 132 S. Ct. at 939–41.\n\n\n       71 As discussed above, the Supreme Court has also noted the time constraints of this\ncase in light of the scheduled elections in November of 2016. See Veasey v. Abbott, 136 S. Ct.\nat 1823.\n                                             82\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 83   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n        In the event that the Governor calls a special session to address this\nissue or should a later Legislature again address the issue of voter\nidentification, any new law would present a new circumstance not addressed\nhere.    Such a new law may cure the deficiencies addressed in this opinion.\nNeither our ruling here nor any ruling of the district court on remand should\nprevent the Legislature from acting to ameliorate the issues raised in this\nopinion. Any concerns about a new bill would be the subject of a new appeal\nfor another day.\n        On remand, the district court should refer to the policies underlying SB\n14 in fashioning a remedy. We acknowledge that the record establishes that\nthe vast majority of eligible voters possess SB 14 ID, and we do not disturb SB\n14’s effect on those voters—those who have SB 14 ID must show it to vote. The\nremedy must be tailored to rectify only the discriminatory effect on those voters\nwho do not have SB 14 ID or are unable to reasonably obtain such\nidentification. See Frank II, 819 F.3d at 386 (rejecting that “because some\nvoters face undue difficulties in obtaining acceptable photo IDs, Wisconsin\ncould not require any voter to present a photo ID,” but accepting that “high\nhurdles for some persons” might “entitle those particular persons to relief”).\nBecause the parties had an opportunity to present the evidence they desired\nduring the initial district court proceedings, the district court’s determinations\nshould be based on the current record, supplemented only by legislative action,\nif any, that occurs after this remand and any oral argument permitted by the\ndistrict court.\n        Clearly, the Legislature wished to reduce the risk of in-person voter\nfraud by strengthening the forms of identification presented for voting. Simply\nreverting to the system in place before SB 14’s passage would not fully respect\nthese policy choices—it would allow voters to cast ballots after presenting less\n                                       83\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 84     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nsecure forms of identification like utility bills, bank statements, or paychecks.\nSee TEX. ELEC. CODE § 63.001(b) (West 2010). The panel opinion noted that\none possibility would be to reinstate voter registration cards as documents that\nqualify as acceptable identification under the Texas Election Code for those\nindividuals who do not have and cannot reasonably obtain SB 14 ID. 72 During\noral argument, counsel for the State suggested that an indigency exception,\nmodeled after the exception in Indiana’s voter ID law, would be sufficient to\ncure the discriminatory effect of SB 14. These are solutions the district court\nmay consider. Further, in fashioning a remedy, the district court should also\nconsider the necessity of educational and training efforts to ensure that both\nvoters and workers at polling places are capable of making use of whatever\nremedy the district court selects.\n       In light of the impending election, we order the district court to file its\norder regarding the proper discriminatory effect remedy as soon as possible.\nThe parties have expressed a willingness to work cooperatively with the\ndistrict court to provide a prompt resolution of this matter, and we urge them\nto do so to avoid election eve uncertainties and emergencies.\n                                     VI. Conclusion\nA. Discriminatory Purpose Claim\n       For the reasons stated above, we REVERSE the district court’s judgment\nthat SB 14 was passed with a racially discriminatory purpose and REMAND\nfor the district court to consider this claim in light of the guidance we have\nprovided in this opinion. As we have discussed, to avoid disruption of the\n\n\n\n       72  While the registration card does not contain a photo, it is a more secure document\nthan a bank statement or electric bill and, presumably, one not as easily obtained by another\nperson. It is sent in a nondiscriminatory fashion, free of charge, to each registered voter and\ntherefore avoids any cost issues.\n                                              84\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 85   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nupcoming election, the district court should first focus on fashioning interim\nrelief for the discriminatory effect violation in the months leading up to the\nNovember general election. The district court should then reevaluate the\nevidence relevant to discriminatory intent and determine anew whether the\nLegislature acted with a discriminatory intent in enacting SB 14. We\nencourage the district court to wait until after the November 2016 election to\nmake this new determination. However, whether the district court waits to\nmake its findings until after the November election or does so sooner, we\ninstruct that, in light of the limited time prior to the November 2016\nelection, the district court shall not implement any remedy arising from such\nreevaluation before this November’s election.\nB. Discriminatory Effect Claim\n      We AFFIRM the district court’s finding that SB 14 violates Section 2 of\nthe Voting Rights Act through its discriminatory effects and REMAND for\nconsideration of the appropriate remedy consistent with this opinion as soon\nas possible.    The district court must ensure that any remedy enacted\nameliorates SB 14’s discriminatory effect, while respecting the Legislature’s\nstated objective to safeguard the integrity of elections by requiring more secure\nforms of voter identification.\nC. Other Claims\n      We VACATE the district court’s holding that SB 14 is a poll tax under\nthe Fourteenth and Twenty-Fourth Amendments and RENDER judgment for\nthe State on this issue. We need not and do not address whether SB 14\nunconstitutionally burdens the right to vote under the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments; therefore, we VACATE the district court’s judgment on that\nissue and DISMISS those claims.\n\n\n                                       85\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530     Page: 86   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-41127\nD. Interim Relief\n      In sum, the district court’s immediate responsibility is to ensure the\nimplementation of an interim remedy for SB 14’s discriminatory effect that\ndisrupts voter identification rules for the 2016 election season as little as\npossible, yet eliminates the Section 2 discriminatory effect violation. The\ndistrict court will need to reexamine the discriminatory purpose claim in\naccordance with the proper legal standards we have described, bearing in mind\nthe effect any interim legislative action taken with respect to SB 14 may have.\nThe district court’s task in this respect may await the November 8, 2016\ngeneral election.\n\n\n\n\n                                      86\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 87     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nSTEPHEN A. HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge, joined by GREGG COSTA, Circuit\nJudge, concurring:\n       As the Supreme Court has reminded, though great progress has been\nmade, “voting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that,” and Section 2 of\nthe Voting Rights Act operates as a crucial “permanent, nationwide ban,”\nShelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2619, 2631 (2013), on “even the most\nsubtle forms of discrimination,” Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 406 (1991)\n(Scalia, J., dissenting). The courts, therefore, have a vital role in protecting\nthe right “to participate equally in the political process.” Thornburg v. Gingles,\n478 U.S. 30, 80 (1986). Indeed, the Supreme Court has long cautioned that\nalleged discrimination against minorities calls for a “searching judicial\ninquiry,” United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938),\nand with regard to Section 2, which mandates consideration of “the totality of\ncircumstances,” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b), Congress has made clear that, again in\nthe Court’s words, “whether the political processes are ‘equally open’ depends\nupon a searching practical evaluation of the ‘past and present reality’” and “on\na ‘functional’ view of the political process,” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 (quoting S.\nRep.

As the majority opinion shows, the district court’s\nSection 2 finding is a permissible view of a voluminous record informed by\nextensive testimony.    I join the majority opinion and write separately to\nrespond to arguments in the principal dissenting opinion because, contrary to\nthose arguments, I perceive that the majority opinion’s Section 2 analysis fits\ncomfortably with decisions of the Supreme Court, our court, and other circuits.\n                                        I.\n      As the majority opinion explains, our adoption of the Fourth and Sixth\nCircuits’ two-part test places Section 2’s totality-of-circumstances inquiry in a\nvote-denial framework that adheres to the text of Section 2, 52 U.S.C. § 10301,\nand the Supreme Court’s guidance in Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47 (“The essence of\na § 2 claim is that a certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with\nsocial and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities\nenjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.”).\nUse of the Gingles (or Senate) factors as nonexhaustive tools fleshing out this\nframework ensures the requisite causal linkage between past discrimination\nand a challenged voting practice’s disparate impact.        Though some of the\nfactors may have less relevance in vote-denial cases, others, particularly\n“Senate factors one, three, five, and nine,” aid in applying the Supreme Court’s\nadmonition to discern the relevant social and historical effects of\ndiscrimination, and their interaction with a challenged law.

REV. 439,\n481–82 (2015) (concluding that most of the Senate factors are relevant to vote-\ndenial claims, the fifth factor especially so). And case law belies the argument\nthat the Senate factors have no place outside the vote-dilution context.\n                                       88\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 89     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\n       The Senate factors have roots in this court, see Zimmer v. McKeithen,\n485 F.2d 1297, 1305 (5th Cir. 1973) (en banc), and we have not limited them to\nvote-dilution cases. To the contrary, in a vote-denial case in which we affirmed\na finding that Mississippi’s voter registration process violated Section 2’s\nresults test, we noted that the trial court applied those “‘objective factors’ to\naid the courts in evaluating a § 2 claim.” Miss.

Miss. 1987) (applying all\nnine factors). 2 And among our sister circuits, it is not just the Fourth and Sixth\nthat have found the Senate factors significant in vote-denial cases.                    See\nGonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 405–06 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc) (explaining\nthat “courts should consider” the Senate factors in vote-denial cases); Johnson\nv.

Compare\nOperation Push, 932 F.2d at 403 (citing the argument that African-Americans’ lack of access\nto transportation and less flexible work schedules made it more difficult for them to comply\nwith the restrictive registration system), with Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d 627, 664–65\n(S.D. Tex. 2014) (citing evidence that low-income Texans, who are disproportionately African-\nAmerican or Hispanic, not only disproportionately lack qualifying ID, but also have more\ndifficulty taking time off from work to secure ID and “live without vehicles for their own\ntransportation to get to ID-issuing offices”).\n                                             89\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 90     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nRights Act, and held only that the lower courts “correctly concluded that the\nevidence in the record [was] not sufficient to support a facial attack on the\nvalidity of the entire statute” under the constitutional Anderson-Burdick\nframework. Id. at 189. Furthermore, as Justice Stevens took care to note, the\nrecord there, unlike here, (1) did not quantify the voters without qualifying ID,\n(2) provided no “concrete evidence of the burden imposed on voters who\ncurrently lack photo identification,” and (3) said “virtually nothing about the\ndifficulties faced by . . . indigent voters.” Id. at 200–01. To be sure, Crawford\nestablished that preventing voter fraud and safeguarding voter confidence are\nlegitimate and important state interests. Id. at 194–97. But it does not follow\nthat assertion of those interests immunizes a voter ID law from all challenges,\nor that courts should be deterred from examining, as part of the Section 2\ntotality-of-circumstances inquiry, the tenuousness of the reasons given for the\nlaw. See League of Women Voters of N. Car. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224,\n246 (4th Cir. 2014); cf. Husted, 768 F.3d at 547 (“[Crawford] does not mean,\nhowever, that the State can, by merely asserting an interest in preventing\nvoter fraud, establish that that interest outweighs a significant burden on\nvoters.”). 3\n       Nor does our decision contravene League of United Latin American\nCitizens v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831 (5th Cir. 1993) (en banc). Texas highlights\nour statements in that dilution case that socioeconomic disparities alone do not\n\n\n\n\n       3 To the extent the dissent argues that League of United Latin American Citizens v.\nClements forecloses consideration of the “tenuousness” factor, that case distinguished the\n“weight” of the state’s interest “from the conventional Zimmer [Senate] factor of\ntenuousness.” 999 F.2d 831, 871 (5th Cir. 1993) (en banc). And as the Supreme Court\nrecently reminded, that a state interest is legitimate does not necessarily mean courts should\nignore evidence of whether a specific law advances that interest or imposes needless burdens.\nSee Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt, --- S. Ct. ---, 2016 WL 3461560, at *16 (2016).\n                                             90\n\f    Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 91    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nshow “that minorities do not enjoy equal access to the political process,” and\nthat the Senate Report “did not dispense with proof that participation in the\npolitical process is in fact depressed among minority citizens.” Id. at 866, 867.\nFrom this, Texas reasons that the district court erred by finding a Section 2\nviolation without “proof that the challenged law affects voting behavior.” The\ncited language in Clements, however, discussed Senate factors one and five:\n“the extent of any history of official discrimination” affecting political\nparticipation, and “the extent to which members of the minority group . . . bear\nthe effects of discrimination in such areas as education, employment and\nhealth, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political\nprocess.” Id. at 866 & n.30. In that context, we noted that the plaintiffs\n“offered no evidence of reduced levels of black voter registration, lower turnout\namong black voters, or any other factor tending to show that past\ndiscrimination”—not the challenged law by itself—“ha[d] affected their ability\nto participate in the political process” as required by “these Zimmer [Senate]\nfactors.” Id. at 867. Here, in sharp contrast, the district court heard such\nevidence and found, in its discussion of factor five, that the effects of past\ndiscrimination “have hindered the ability of African-Americans and Hispanics\nto effectively participate in the political process”; indeed, one expert “testified\nthat these minorities register and turnout for elections at rates that lag far\nbehind Anglo voters.” Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d 627, 697 (S.D. Tex. 2014).\n      The district court also heard from witnesses who were unable to vote\nbecause they lacked the required forms of ID, from some who struggled to\nobtain the required forms of ID or documents needed to obtain them, and from\nothers who help disadvantaged individuals obtain photo IDs and attested to\nthe difficulties those individuals face in doing so. See id. at 667–76. The court\nfurther credited expert testimony that SB 14 “would almost certainly decrease\n                                        91\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 92     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nvoter turnout, particularly among minorities,” by imposing burdens that fall\nmore heavily on African-Americans and Hispanics. Id. at 655–56; see also id.\nat 664–65. 4 The majority opinion rightly rejects Texas’s attempt to stretch\nClements to require that plaintiffs wait until elections have occurred under the\nchallenged law and then prove a direct impact on turnout. That would make\nimpossible pre-enforcement Section 2 challenges, which the Supreme Court\nrecently acknowledged. See Shelby County, 133 S. Ct. at 2619 (“[I]njunctive\nrelief is available in appropriate [Section 2] cases to block voting laws from\ngoing into effect.”).      And as multiple experts testified, given the myriad\nvariables at play, it is extremely difficult to isolate the effect of a new law on\nvoter turnout. 5 Texas’s argument that the plaintiffs were required to prove a\ndirect impact on turnout is unsound.\n\n\n       4  The dissent cites law review articles for the propositions that studies collected\ntherein show no effect from voter ID laws on turnout, or even show increased turnout. Those\ncollected studies, which mostly date from 2009 and earlier, did not involve SB 14 and do not\nmake the district court’s acceptance of expert testimony that Texas’s law likely will depress\nturnout clearly erroneous. In any event, scholarship on the effects of voter ID laws is far\nfrom uniform. See, e.g., Zoltan Hajnal, et al., Voter Identification Laws and the Suppression\nof          Minority          Votes,           at         15          (February         2016),\nhttp://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/page5/documents/voterIDhajnaletal.pdf         (“For    Latinos,\nBlacks, and multi-racial Americans there are strong signs that strict photo identification\nlaws decrease turnout.”); Bill Hobby, et al., The Texas Voter ID Law and the 2014 Election: A\nStudy     of    Texas’s   23rd     Congressional     District,    at    13   (August    2015),\nhttps://bakerinstitute.org/media/files/files/e0029eb8/Politics-VoterID-Jones-080615.pdf\n(concluding that Hispanic non-voters in one Texas congressional district “were significantly\nmore likely than Anglo non-voters to strongly agree or agree that a lack of photo ID was a\nreason that they did not cast a ballot in the 2014 general election”); Michael D. Gilbert, The\nProblem of Voter Fraud, 115 COLUM. L. REV. 739, 749 & n.55 (2015) (“Other studies suggest\nvoter ID laws do depress votes.” (collecting studies)).\n        5 Scholars have made the same point.        See Tokaji, supra, at 475–76 (“Existing\nempirical methods are simply not up to the task of establishing the effect of a particular\npractice on turnout, let alone on turnout by particular subgroups, with any degree of\nprecision.”); Samuel Issacharoff, Ballot Bedlam, 64 DUKE L.J. 1363, 1383 (2015) (“There has\nnot been enough time to test the observations against normal fluctuations in turnout . . . and\nother confounding political factors.”); Michael J.

That court, after citing\nthe Senate factors with approval and emphasizing the deference owed to a\ndistrict court’s factual Section 2 determinations, affirmed a finding that the\nplaintiff had failed to establish the disparate impact of a voter ID law where,\namong other things, the district court rejected as unreliable the plaintiff’s\nexpert statistical analysis and the record included no evidence that Hispanics\nwere even less likely to possess qualifying ID. Id. at 406–07 & n.33. The law\nat issue was also much less strict, requiring a voter to present at the polls either\n(A) one of a broader range of photo IDs or (B) two non-photo documents\nshowing the voter’s name and address, such as a utility bill, bank statement,\nor voter registration card. Gonzalez v. Arizona, No. CV 06-1268-PHX, 2006 WL\n3627297, at *1, *6 (D. Ariz. Sept. 11, 2006).               Even so, two judges wrote\nseparately to stress that the court’s holding was based on “the current record,”\nand that “[a] different record in a future case could produce a different\noutcome.” Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 442 (Berzon, J., concurring). 6\n       The Ninth Circuit of course said that “proof of ‘causal connection between\nthe challenged voting practice and a prohibited discriminatory result’ is\ncrucial” to a Section 2 challenge. Id. at 405 (majority opinion) (quoting Smith,\n109 F.3d at 595). But the district court here found that the record established\nthat causal connection.         The trial judge found that SB 14 makes voting\nrelatively more difficult for minorities, and without ameliorative measures will\n\n\n\ndifficult to determine the amount of actual disenfranchisement caused by photo identification\nlaws.”); Gilbert, supra, at 750 (“Gathering relevant data and designing conclusive tests\npresents many challenges.”).\n        6 The district judge, contrastingly to this case, noted that the record did not contain\n\n“adequate evidence on any of [the Senate] factors to enable an appropriate evaluation.”\nGonzalez, 2006 WL 3627297, at *8.\n                                              93\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 94   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nlikely disproportionately suppress minority voting, by conditioning the right to\nvote on the possession of documents that, because of the effects of past\ndiscrimination, are harder for minority voters to obtain. Such interaction\nbetween present-day law and the effects of past discrimination is what\nCongress intended to combat. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 69 (“Congress intended\nthat the Voting Rights Act eradicate inequalities in political opportunities that\nexist due to the vestigial effects of past purposeful discrimination.”); see also\nid. at 44 n.9 (“[T]he purpose of the Voting Rights Act was ‘not only to correct\nan active history of discrimination, . . . but also to deal with the accumulation\nof discrimination.’” (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 5)).\n      For this reason among others, we should not be guided by Frank v.\nWalker, 768 F.3d 744 (7th Cir. 2014). In that case, Judge Easterbrook—who\ndid not mention the applicable clear-error standard of review—overlooked\nmany of the district court’s factual findings. See Frank v. Walker, 773 F.3d\n783, 792–93, 796–97 (7th Cir. 2014) (Posner, J., dissenting from denial of\nrehearing en banc); Tokaji, supra, at 460.          Questioning other circuits’\napproaches to vote-denial cases without offering a clear alternative, Judge\nEasterbrook went on to uphold a different voter ID law on the rationales that\nthe law did not facially “draw any line by race,” and that the plaintiffs had not\n“show[n] a ‘denial’ of anything by Wisconsin, as § 2(a) requires” because the\nstate had not directly caused minorities to be less likely or able to own\nqualifying IDs. Frank, 768 F.3d at 753. Ultimately, the Seventh Circuit read\nSection 2 as only “an equal-treatment requirement,” and rejected the plaintiffs’\nchallenge “because in Wisconsin everyone has the same opportunity to get a\nqualifying photo ID.” Id. at 754, 755.\n      This reasoning ignores that Section 2 prohibits voting procedures\n“imposed or applied . . . in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement\n                                         94\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 95   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nof the right . . . to vote.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a) (emphasis added). Indeed, the\nopinion does not mention “abridgement” aside from a single quotation of the\nstatute.   Judge Easterbrook’s “equal-treatment” gloss—which he did not\nexplain aside from saying that is “how [the statute] reads,” Frank, 768 F.3d at\n754—is puzzling because it is undisputed that, in response to a judicial ruling\nthat Section 2 plaintiffs had to prove discriminatory intent, Congress revised\nthe statute “to make clear that a violation could be proved by showing\ndiscriminatory effect alone,” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 35; cf. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. &\nCmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2513 (2015)\n(explaining that “disparate-treatment” plaintiffs must show a discriminatory\nintent or motive). And if Section 2 requires only equal treatment, or if a Section\n2 burden is cognizable only if it is impossible for some minority voters to comply\nwith the challenged law, Justice Scalia must have mistakenly stated that\nSection 2 would be violated if “a county permitted voter registration for only\nthree hours one day a week, and that made it more difficult for blacks to\nregister than whites.” Chisom, 501 U.S. at 408 (Scalia J., dissenting). After\nall, ignoring disparities due to past discrimination, that law would give\neveryone the “same opportunity” to register.\n      Judge Easterbrook further seems to have reasoned that the only\ndiscrimination relevant to Section 2’s totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry is\nof the state-sponsored variety. See Frank, 768 F.3d at 753. The dissent agrees,\nadding that the official discrimination must be “contemporary” or at least\n“recent.” I have difficulty squaring that with Section 2’s directive to address\nthe “totality of circumstances,” and with the Supreme Court’s admonitions to\nprobe the interaction of the challenged practice “with social and historical\nconditions” as well as consider “the extent to which minority group members\nbear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment,\n                                       95\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 96     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nand health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political\nprocess.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47, 45. As one of this court’s notable jurists put\nit, “under the results standard of section 2, pervasive private discrimination\nshould be considered, because such discrimination can contribute to the\ninability of [minorities] to assert their political influence and to participate\nequally in public life.” United States v. Marengo Cty. Comm’n, 731 F.2d 1546,\n1567 n.36 (11th Cir. 1984) (Wisdom, J.); see also Gomez v. City of Watsonville,\n863 F.2d 1407, 1418 (9th Cir. 1988) (rejecting the argument that only\ndiscrimination by the defendant is relevant to a Section 2 vote-dilution case);\nSolomon v. Liberty County, 899 F.2d 1012, 1032 (11th Cir. 1990) (en banc)\n(Tjoflat, J., concurring) (“Congress . . . revised section 2 to prohibit election\npractices that accommodate or amplify the effect that private discrimination\nhas in the voting process.” (ellipsis in original) (quoting David L. Eades, Recent\nDevelopments, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act: An Approach to the Results\nTest, 39 VAND. L. REV. 139, 172 (1986))). 7\n                                             III.\n       Two related final points bear mentioning. First, Judge Easterbrook\nwarned that the Frank plaintiffs’ interpretation of Section 2 could “sweep[]\naway almost all registration and voting rules.” Frank, 768 F.3d at 754. For\nexample, he opined, “[m]otor-voter registration, which makes it simple for\n\n\n\n       7  Because Texas selected the requisite voter qualifications and the manner of\nimplementing them, which the trial court found interact with the effects of discrimination to\ncause racial disparities in opportunity to vote, considering the effects of private\ndiscrimination among other factors does not violate the Supreme Court’s warning against\nimposing disparate-impact liability when “the plaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy\nor policies causing [a statistical] disparity.” Inclusive Cmtys., 135 S. Ct. at 2523; cf. id. at\n2524 (opining that a Fair Housing Act plaintiff might not be able to show “a causal connection\nbetween the Department’s policy and a disparate impact” if, “for instance . . . federal law\nsubstantially limits the Department’s discretion”).\n                                              96\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 97   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\npeople to register by checking a box when they get drivers’ licenses, would be\ninvalid, because black and Latino citizens are less likely to own cars and\ntherefore less likely to get drivers’ licenses.” Id. The dissent advances a\nsimilar point, warning that voting regulations ranging from polling locations,\nearly voting details, and registration times “can be challenged successfully\nunder the majority’s rationale.”    I agree that Section 2 challenges can be\nbrought against a variety of election laws—but that is nothing new.

It\nis simplistic to lump all such laws together, overlooking that details—such as\nwhich forms of ID are accepted at the polls, 9 what documentation is needed to\nget a free qualifying ID, 10 and how the law is implemented 11—matter.\nEspecially significant are the accommodations made for those most affected by\nthe ID requirement.

States have reacted to the\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Crawford and Shelby County by introducing a\nrange of voting regulations that go beyond what had previously been upheld.\nIt is healthy for these initiatives to be assessed against congressional\nmandates, and courts can and should distinguish between nondiscriminatory\nones which safeguard voter integrity and those which, whatever their\nintentions, interact with the effects of past discrimination to abridge\nminorities’ opportunities to participate in the political process. Such scrutiny\nshould be seen not as heavy-handed judicial rejection of legislative priorities,\nbut as part of a process of harmonizing those priorities with the fundamental\nright to vote—a topic with which over a quarter of our Constitution’s\namendments have dealt in one way or another, and an individual right that\ncannot be compromised because an adverse impact falls on relatively few\nrather than many.

The\nmajority, however, today holds not only that Texas’s photo voter ID law, SB 14,\nviolates the “results test” declared in Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 2 but\nconcludes that there is “more than a scintilla” of evidence to support a finding\nthat the Texas Legislature passed the photo voter ID law with a racially\ndiscriminatory intent. By keeping this latter claim alive, the majority fans the\nflames of perniciously irresponsible racial name-calling. 3\n\n\n\n       1We join only Part IV of the majority opinion that renders judgment in favor of the\nState on the Plaintiffs’ poll tax claim.\n\n       2  This holding invalidates the law for that small subgroup of the subgroup of 4.5% of\nTexas registered voters, those who allegedly lack not only the law’s approved ID (drivers\nlicenses, veterans ID, etc.) but also lack the documentation (birth certificates) necessary to\nobtain a free Election Identity Card (“EIC”) and are inconvenienced by obtaining the\ndocumentation and the EIC. As I shall demonstrate, the majority offers a gravely incorrect\ninterpretation of Section 2.\n\n       3 Section 2 was amended to add the results test, footing liability on less than\nintentional conduct, in part to defuse controversy over charges of purposeful discrimination.\nSee Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 44, 106 S. Ct. 2752, 2763 (1986) (explaining that one\nof the “principal reasons” the intent test was repudiated was that it was “unnecessarily\ndivisive because it involves charges of racism on the part of individual officials or entire\ncommunities” (internal quotations omitted)). The Senate Report, from which the Court in\nGingles heavily draws, elaborates on this point from testimony and examples before\nCongress:\n\n       As Dr. Arthur S. Flemming, Chairman of the United States Commission on\n       Civil Rights, testified during hearings before the Subcommittee on the\n       Constitution:\n\n                                            101\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 102      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\n       No one doubts our unwavering duty to enforce antidiscrimination law.\nBut in this media-driven and hyperbolic era, the discharge of that duty\nrequires the courage to distinguish between invidious motivation and shadows.\nThe ill-conceived, misguided, and unsupported majority opinion shuns\ndiscernment. Because of definitive Supreme Court authority, no comparable\nfederal court precedent in over forty years has found a state legislative act\nmotivated by purposeful racial discrimination. Even more telling, the multi-\nthousand page record yields not a trace, much less a legitimate inference, of\nracial bias by the Texas Legislature. Indeed, why would a racially biased\nlegislature have provided for a cost-free election ID card to assist poor\nregistered voters—of all races—who might not have drivers’ licenses? Yet the\nmajority emulates the clever capacity of Area 51 alien enthusiasts who, lacking\nany real evidence, espied a vast but clandestine government conspiracy to\nconceal the “truth.” 4\n\n\n                     (L)itigators representing excluded minorities will have to\n             explore motivations of individual council members, mayors, and other\n             citizens. The question would be whether their decisions were motivated\n             by invidious racial considerations. Such inquiries can only be divisive,\n             threatening to destroy any existing racial progress in a community. It\n             is the intent test, not the results test, that would make it necessary to\n             brand individuals as racist in order to obtain judicial relief.\n\n             The very concern voiced by Dr. Flemming was illustrated by two recent\n      decisions, [City of Mobile, Ala. v.] Bolden, [446 U.S. 55, 100 S. Ct. 1490 (1980)],\n      on remand, and Perkins v. City of West Helena, Ark.[, 675 F.2d 201 (8th Cir.\n      1982)]. In both cases, the federal courts were compelled to label the motives of\n      recent public officials as “racial” in reaching the conclusion that an electoral\n      system was maintained for a discriminatory purpose.\n\nS.

Governor and Governor, who supported SB 14, we consider that\nmajority conclusion first. We then critique the majority’s Section 2 holding and\ndiscuss constitutional tensions the majority opinion fosters.\nI.     Background\n       Three points must be highlighted at the outset, with further discussion\nto follow: the true extent of the legislative process leading to passage of a photo\nvoter ID law; the catalytic effect of the Supreme Court’s decision approving\nthese IDs; and the impact of the law’s requirements on all races.\n       First, SB 14 was enacted in the 2011 biennial legislative session after\nsimilar bills requiring photo voter ID had failed in three previous sessions. For\nsix years, opponents had successfully stalled measures requiring proof of a\nvoter’s identity, not just a piece of paper from the County Registrar’s office or\na mere affidavit of “lost voter certificate.” For every shortcut the majority\nemployed to finally pass SB 14, an equal and opposite blocking tactic had\nsucceeded in earlier legislative sessions.\n       Second, the campaign for stronger voter ID laws was encouraged by\nCrawford v. Marion County Election Board, 553 U.S. 181, 128 S. Ct. 1610\n(2008), which upheld Indiana’s photo voter ID law and emphasized the\nimportance of protecting the integrity of election processes. Justice Stevens’s\n\n\n\nArea 51 conspiracy theories). Circumstantial evidence—equally probative as that relied on\nby the majority—is at odds with calling SB 14 intentionally discriminatory. Lamenting the\nlack of Latino voter turnout in Texas elections, Gilberto Hinojosa, the Texas Democratic\nChairman, was recently quoted in a news article: “Voter ID is a problem. It is. But that’s\nfixable. . . . That’s not stopping that 1 million from going out to vote . . . .” Peggy Fikac, Texas\nDemocratic Chair: It’s ‘Ridiculous’ His Party Isn’t Winning, SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS NEWS\n(June 16, 2016), http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Texas-Democratic-chair-\nIt-s-ridiculous-8261873.php.\n                                               103\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 104   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nopinion rejected the claim that Indiana had to advance “proof” of actual in-\nperson voter fraud in order to justify the statute. Fourteen states passed photo\nvoter ID laws in the wake of Crawford.\n      Third, the range of qualifying SB 14 IDs, while narrower than that in\nsome similar ID laws, poses no obstacle to voting for at least 95.5% of all Texas\nvoters who have unexpired (or no later than 60 days past expiry) driver’s\nlicenses, Texas personal identification cards, military IDs with a photo, United\nStates passports, United States citizenship certificates with a photo, or\nlicenses to carry a handgun. For those who lack such IDs, the law offers a cost-\nfree Election Identification Card (“EIC”) obtainable at state DMV offices (like\nthe free card available in Indiana). Photo voter IDs are not required for elderly\nand disabled voters, as they may vote with mail-in ballots.\n      At trial, the alleged adverse racial impact of SB 14 was derived from\nstatistical estimates of the relative numbers of Anglo, Black, and Hispanic\nvoters who “do not possess SB14-compliant IDs.” That is to say, of the 4.5%\nwho may lack qualifying IDs, a disproportionate number are Black and\nHispanic voters. Still, approximately the same number of Anglo registered\nvoters (approx. 296,000) as the total of Black (approx. 128,000) and Hispanic\n(approx. 175,000) voters lack the requisite IDs. Put otherwise, approximately\n2% of Anglo, 5.9% of Hispanic and 8.1% of Black voters comprise the 4.5% who\nlack SB 14 IDs but could vote with EICs; the law poses no obstacle for over 90%\nof minority voters.\n      Despite extraordinary efforts to find voters “disenfranchised” by SB 14,\nthe DOJ could not uncover any, and no representative of the plaintiff\norganizations found any of their members unable to vote because of SB 14.\nThree plaintiffs claimed they could not vote in person under SB 14, but two of\nthose qualified for ballots by mail. The plaintiffs’ case thus turned on the\n                                      104\n\f      Case: 14-41127   Document: 00513601530     Page: 105   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nextent to which it could be estimated that those who do not possess SB 14 IDs\nwould find it difficult to acquire EICs.       It was assumed that the 4.5%\noverwhelmingly include the poor (of all races). There was expert testimony,\nunsupported by any hard data, that “the poor” are less likely to have actual or\ncertified copies of birth certificates, the principal document required for an\nEIC. Obtaining birth certificates was testified to be challenging for the poor,\nespecially those who had moved from their original birthplaces, but no\nestimates of this class’s mobility were offered. Finally, even if the poor had\nbirth certificates or obtained them, the district court found that travelling to\nDMV offices to procure EICs could be time-consuming, burdensome and\ninterfere with hourly work schedules.\nII.     The Majority’s Erroneous Discussion of Discriminatory Intent\n        SB 14 is a facially neutral law of general applicability, whose photo ID\nrequirement poses no obstacle to the overwhelming majority of registered\nTexas voters.     The law has a racially disparate impact upon a subset of\nminority voters. But there is “no smoking gun,” not even code words that\nsuggest discriminatory intent in the thousands of pages of legislative\ndocuments and deposition transcripts that the district court compelled the\nstate to produce. The majority entirely ignores the total absence of direct\nevidence and, moreover, has to exclude (by force of precedent) the evidence\nmost heavily relied on by the district court. Still, the majority finds “more than\na scintilla of evidence” that could allow the district court on remand to condemn\nthe law as, at least in part, racially motivated. I fully agree with Judge\nClement’s application of the Arlington Heights factors and will not repeat the\ndiscussion in her separate dissent. My additional disagreements are two-fold.\nFirst, the majority fails to follow the totality of Supreme Court precedents\n\n\n                                       105\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 106     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\npertaining to the interpretation of legislative intent. 5 Second, the majority\nbutchers, when it does not ignore, the relevant facts.\n       A. Applicable Legal Principles\n       “[O]fficial action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it\nresults in a racially disproportionate impact . . . . Proof of racially\ndiscriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause.” Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.,\n429 U.S. 252, 264–65, 97 S. Ct. 555, 563 (1983). This is shared ground, as it is\nthat Arlington Heights sets out certain factors that may be relevant to proving\nthe intent of the legislature.\n       Arlington Heights’s discourse on proving discriminatory legislative\nintent does not exist in a vacuum. There, the Court upheld a zoning board\ndecision that prevented the construction of a low-income housing project in a\nChicago suburb. The facially neutral zoning order had a discriminatory impact\non minorities who were more likely to inhabit the project. The Court attempted\nto catalog how a legislative decision, and the steps leading to it, might display\nan impermissible motive. Notably, in each case cited to exemplify its listed\nfactors, discriminatory motive could be easily inferred. A county closed public\n(heavily minority) schools while private segregated schools received financial\nsupport. 6 A state constitutional amendment was passed to overturn laws that\n\n\n\n       5    The majority also erroneously equates finding legislative intent with finding\ndiscrimination in employment cases. The intent of the legislature is a pastiche of each\nindividual representative’s views, mixed policies and motives. An employer, in contrast, is\nheld to have a single motive and policy. A facile equation of these two situations elides the\ndifficulty in legislative cases, which the Supreme Court plumbed in cases described above.\n\n       6 Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 267, 97 S. Ct.\n555, 564 (1977) (citing Griffin v. Sch. Bd., 377 U.S. 218, 84 S. Ct. 1226 (1964)).\n\n                                            106\n\f   Case: 14-41127         Document: 00513601530          Page: 107     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nhad recently banned discrimination in private home sales. 7                      And zoning\nregulations were immediately changed, or a moratorium on new construction\ndeclared, or land rezoned to park use when a public housing project was\nproposed. 8      Highly relevant to legislative purpose, the Court held, but\n“extraordinary” because it could not normally be compelled, would be evidence\nof legislative history and legislators’ contemporaneous statements. Id. at 268.\nThe Court applied its newly listed factors to a very ordinary and neutral zoning\nprocess and found no racially discriminatory purpose. Id. at 269–71.\n       Nothing in Arlington Heights suggests that the Court’s listing of relevant\nfactors licenses courts to string together bits of circumstantial evidence that\nwholly lack racial content and then undo any law with an incidental disparate\nimpact. In Arlington Heights, the Court found no basis for doing so.\n       Arlington Heights followed Washington v. Davis, in which the Court held\nthat purposeful discrimination is required to establish Equal Protection\nviolations. Despite evidence that four times more Blacks than Whites failed\nthe District of Columbia’s verbal proficiency test for police applicants, 426 U.S.\n229, 237, 96 S. Ct. 2040, 2046 (1976), the Court found no purposeful\ndiscrimination, id. at 246. “The test is neutral on its face and rationally may\nbe said to serve a purpose the Government is constitutionally empowered to\npursue.” Id.

For precisely this reason, courts must walk a fine line between\nacknowledging discriminatory impact in a neutral law and discerning\ndiscriminatory purpose from nothing more than creative inferences.\n       Two years after Arlington Heights, the Court rejected inferring\ndiscrimination against women in a Massachusetts law that conferred an\nabsolute lifetime state employment preference for veterans.               Pers. Adm’r of\nMass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 99 S. Ct. 2282 (1979). 9 The district court had\nfound no overt sex-discriminatory purpose by the legislature but concluded\nthat the consequences of the absolute-preference formula for women’s\nemployment opportunities “were too inevitable to have been ‘unintended.’” Id.\nat 261. But the Court focused on the legitimate, noninvidious purpose of the\nlaw, which broadly included both male and female veterans, and it noted that\nsignificant numbers of male nonveterans were also disadvantaged by the law.\nId. at 274–75. 10 The adverse impact of the law was gauged according to all the\naffected citizens, not just the minority group.\n\n\n\n       9A finding of discrimination had been remanded for reconsideration in light of\nWashington v. Davis. Pers. Adm’r of Mass v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 260, 99 S. Ct. 2282, 2286\n(1979).\n\n       10  Justice Stevens’s concurrence pointed out that about 2.8 million women were\nadversely affected by the law, but so were over 1.8 million men, a comparison he found\nsignificant “to refute the claim that the rule was intended to benefit males as a class over\nfemales as a class.” Id. at 281.\n                                           108\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530       Page: 109   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n      Significantly, the Court rebuffed three arguments reminiscent of\ncontentions advanced in this case to support a finding of discriminatory\npurpose. First, even though the military may have historically discriminated\nagainst women, “the history of discrimination against women in the military\nis not on trial in this case.” Id. at 278; see also Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S.\n717, 745, 94 S. Ct. 3112, 3127 (1974) (remedy cannot be imposed on other\ngovernment bodies not having been shown to violate Constitution). In other\nwords, exogenous effects of past discrimination cannot be used to impute a\ncontemporary discriminatory purpose.\n      Second, the Court held, discriminatory purpose:\n      implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of\n      consequences . . . . It implies that the decisionmaker . . . selected\n      or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because\n      of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable\n      group.    Yet nothing in the record demonstrated that this\n      preference for veterans was originally devised or subsequently re-\n      enacted because it would accomplish the collateral goal of keeping\n      women in a stereotypic and predefined place in the Massachusetts\n      Civil Service.\n\n\nId. at 279. Thus, as in Arlington Heights, an absence of direct evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent should be compelling.\n      Third, the Court rejected the plaintiffs’ complaint that the law was\nexcessively broad, unfair, and controversial with a firm reminder that “the\nFourteenth Amendment ‘cannot be made a refuge from ill-advised laws.’” Id.\nat 281 (internal citation omitted).     That a law might have been written\ndifferently with respect to impact does not condemn it under the Equal\nProtection Clause.\n\n\n\n\n                                       109\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 110     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\n       In a footnote, the Court acknowledged the possibility that a strong\ninference of discrimination could perhaps be drawn from a stark sex-based\nimpact, but the Court cautioned that\n       [i]n this inquiry—made as it is under the Constitution—an\n       inference is a working tool, not a synonym for proof. When, as\n       here, the impact is essentially an unavoidable consequence of a\n       legislative policy that has in itself always been deemed to be\n       legitimate, and when, as here, the statutory history and all of the\n       available evidence affirmatively demonstrate the opposite, the\n       inference simply fails to ripen into proof.\n\n\nId. at 279 n.25. Inferences cannot substitute for proof where the available\nevidence demonstrates no invidious intent.\n       The case before us falls comfortably in line with Arlington Heights,\nWashington v. Davis, and Feeney. 11 First, the facially neutral laws in each of\nthose cases worked a far more dramatic disparate impact on minorities than\ndoes SB 14’s specification of qualifying photo voter IDs. SB 14, after all, has\nno disparate impact on over 90% of all registered Black and Hispanic voters.\nSecond, as in the Supreme Court cases, SB 14 has legitimate noninvidious\npurposes: ensuring the integrity of in-person balloting and public confidence\nin election outcomes. Third, as in Washington v. Davis, where surrounding\ncircumstances confirmed an absence of discriminatory intent, 426 U.S. at 246–\n47, 96 S. Ct. at 2051, SB 14 authorized an EIC for all voters without drivers’\nlicenses, presumably the poor, to satisfy the photo ID requirement. Fourth, as\nin Feeney, not only minority voters but an equal number of Anglo voters are\n\n\n\n       11 It is true that the primary holdings in Washington v. Davis and Feeney worked out\nthe relationship between disparate impact and the Equal Protection clause, but in each case,\nto uphold the law in question, the Court necessarily had to find no purposeful discrimination\nby the legislature. This discussion reflects that aspect of the decisions.\n\n                                            110\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 111     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nwithin the 4.5% who do not have qualifying IDs. Fifth, in not one of those cases\ndid the Court require “proof” that the challenged statute was effective or the\nbest choice to achieve the legislative objective.          Instead, the Court in Feeney\nadmonished that the Fourteenth Amendment is not a “refuge from ill-\nadvised . . . laws.” 442 U.S. at 281, 99 S. Ct. at 2297 (internal citation omitted).\n       The majority ignores the foregoing similarities between this case and the\ngoverning trio of Supreme Court authorities. In fact, following this trio, no\ncomparable federal court decision in forty years has found that any facially\nneutral state law was passed with discriminatory purpose. 12 The majority\nopinion further defies those authorities by relying excessively on exogenous\n\n\n\n       12  Cf. Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 105 S. Ct. 1916 (1985) (overturning an\nAlabama constitutional provision dating from 1901 with abundant evidence of discriminatory\nintent to disenfranchise Black felons); Garza v. Cty. of L.A., 918 F.2d 763 (9th Cir. 1990)\n(holding that action by a county, not a state legislature, to fragment Hispanic voting\npopulation to perpetuate incumbencies amounted to intentional discrimination); Harris v.\nSiegelman, 695 F. Supp. 517 (M.D. Ala. 1988) (finding intentional discrimination where\npolicies of: appointing only White poll officials; keeping electoral process closed to Black\ncitizens by law and through use of fraud, force, and intimidation; and retaining provisions\nfrom racially inspired law requiring that voter seeking assistance swear oath to inspectors\nthat he or she is unable to write English language and limiting to five minutes time that\nvoter may remain inside voting booth amounted to intentional discrimination); Baker v. City\nof Kissimmee, Fla., 645 F. Supp. 571 (M.D. Fla. 1986) (holding that the city intentionally\ndiscriminated against Black citizens by providing municipal services of street paving,\nresurfacing, and maintenance to identifiable Black residential neighborhoods in a disparate\nand unequal manner in violation of Equal Protection Clause, where about 63% of street\nfootage in Black neighborhoods was unpaved compared to about 39% in White neighborhoods,\nand about 95% of resurfacing programs occurred in White neighborhoods compared to about\n5% in Black neighborhoods).\n        Judge Costa attempts to explain away the absence of any comparable case in over\nforty years declaring that a state legislature acted with discriminatory intent. The presence\nof preclearance under Section 5 in some jurisdictions does not explain why there are no\nfindings of purposeful discrimination by a state legislature either outside the jurisdictions\ncovered by preclearance or beyond the subject of voting regulations. Washington v. Davis,\nFeeney, and Arlington Heights all rejected discrimination claims not arising from voting\nrights. Like the majority, Judge Costa continues to fear de jure discrimination by states fifty\nyears after passage of the major federal civil rights laws in this country.\n\n                                             111\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 112      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\neffects of discrimination and “long ago” legislative actions, and by authorizing\na string of inferences to become a “synonym for proof” contrary to Feeney. See\nid. at 279 n.25.\n       But even if there were merit in the majority’s inadequate reading of the\nSupreme Court’s decisions, the “proof” adduced in support of the majority\nopinion is nonexistent. 13 We move on to address the errors and omissions\ncommitted in the majority’s analysis of the record.\n       B. Record Analysis\n       The following section tracks each of the alleged “facts” from which the\nmajority opinion draws inferences of discriminatory intent.\n       1. “the record does not contain direct evidence . . . .”\n\n\n       As the majority acknowledges, the record is barren of any “direct\nevidence that the Texas Legislature passed SB 14 with a racially invidious\n\n\n       13  Judge Costa’s separate opinion requires special comment to the extent it admits a\n“different starting point” for assessing a discriminatory purpose claim. In plain English, he\nargues a theory never litigated in this case, unsupported by any evidence, at odds with the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Feeney, and unsupported by the only cases he relies on. After\nhis lament about the duration of the instant litigation, there is no justification for bringing\nup points that are unpreserved, not briefed, and therefore not entitled to consideration on\nremand. Judge Costa’s theory is that political partisanship can be tantamount to a proxy for\ndiscriminatory intent. That is not what the Court held in Feeney: “‘Discriminatory\npurpose’ . . . implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.”\n442 U.S. at 279, 99 S. Ct. at 2296. The decisionmaker must have acted in part “because of,”\nnot merely “in spite of” the adverse effects of the legislation. Id. Judge Costa points to no\nevidence indicating such a discriminatory purpose to “suppress votes”, as opposed to ensuring\nthe voters’ identity. Further, in the single case he relies on (and only the concurring opinion,\nat that), the district court found direct evidence of purposeful discrimination as well as\npartisanship. Garza v. City of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 767 n.1, 771 (9th Cir. 1990). Judge\nCosta (and the majority in fn.30) cite Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d 1398, 1408 (7th Cir. 1984),\nfor the proposition that in factually egregious circumstances, local council redistricting to\nprotect political incumbents might intentionally discriminate against minority voters. In\nKetchum, however, the court refused to review the question of intentional discrimination\nafter the district court had resolved the case under Section 2. Id. at 1409.\n\n                                             112\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 113     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\npurpose.”      After making this observation, the court quickly pivots to\ncataloguing various pieces of circumstantial evidence, but the majority fails to\nmention that the plaintiffs unearthed no direct evidence of discriminatory\nintent even after they were granted wide-ranging and invasive discovery into\npotentially privileged 14 internal correspondence of the Legislature. Indeed,\nlegislators, their staff, and even the Lt. Governor produced thousands of\ndocuments, including office files, bill books, personal correspondence\nconcerning SB14, access to personal and official email accounts, and e-mail\ncommunications between legislators and lawyers at the Texas Legislative\nCouncil. 15     Additionally, the plaintiffs took weeks of seven-hour-long\n\n\n       14 In Arlington Heights, the Supreme Court cautioned that “judicial inquiries into\nlegislative or executive motivation represent a substantial intrusion into the workings of\nother branches of government” and that “[p]lacing a decisionmaker on the stand is therefore\n‘usually to be avoided.’” 429 U.S. at 268 n.18, 97 S. Ct. at 565 n.18. “In some extraordinary\ninstances . . . members might be called to the stand at trial to testify concerning the purpose\nof the official action, although even then such testimony frequently will be barred by\nprivilege.” Id. at 268.\n        Since Arlington Heights, courts frequently rely on the legislative privilege to repel\nattempts by plaintiffs to subject legislators to the burdens of civil litigation. See In re\nHubbard, 803 F.3d 1298, 1307–08 (11th Cir. 2015) (quashing subpoenas for the production\nof documents served on legislators and a Governor in a First Amendment retaliation case);\nReeder v. Madigan, 780 F.3d 799, 806 (7th Cir. 2015) (dismissing, based on legislative\nimmunity, plaintiff’s claim that the Illinois Senate violated his First Amendment rights by\ndenying him media credentials); Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Williams, 62 F.3d 408\n(D.C. Cir. 1995) (quashing subpoenas for disclosure of subcommittee documents served on\nmembers of a Congressional subcommittee by private defendants in an unrelated civil\nlawsuit); MINPECO, S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 844 F.2d 856 (D.C. Cir. 1988)\n(same).\n        In this case, however, the district court disregarded this authority and opted to take\na piecemeal, balancing approach to the legislators’ legislative privilege.\n\n       15 See, e.g., ROA 83316–17 (requesting from Senator Fraser “[a]ll documents related\nto communications between, among, or with you, the office of the Governor, the office of the\nLt.

Yet, this\nunprecedented and probing inquisition into reams of documents and hours of\ntestimony uncovered not a single slip of the tongue or errant statement\nindicative of a racially discriminatory motive behind SB 14.                  Were SB 14\ntainted by racially discriminatory intent, one would expect to find at least some\nhint of such invidious intent in the thousands of files and hours of deposition\ntestimony, which were aggregated from a diverse cross-section of state officials.\nInstead, the evidence demonstrated just the opposite: that SB 14 was passed\nto deter voter fraud and promote ballot integrity, thereby increasing voter\nturnout. 17\n\n\n\n       16  Lt.

Quoting Senator Fraser as “knowing that the law would be subject to\n         preclearance” and Mr. Hebert, Lt. Gov. Dewhurst’s General Counsel,\n         on talking points to senators, with implication these could be\n         construed as masks for racist motives\n\n\n      To the majority, “[t]here is evidence that the proponents of SB 14 were\ncareful about what they said and wrote about the purposes of SB 14, knowing\nit would be challenged during the preclearance process under the Voting\nRights Act.”   For this proposition, they highlight a statement by Senator\nFraser, one of SB 14’s authors, who testified that “the public legislative record\nwould either go to the Department of Justice or a three-judge panel as a part\nof the [Voting Rights Act] Section 5 review process.” Because Senator Fraser\nwas “aware that everything that [he] was saying was part of a public record,”\nthe majority imply, it is unsurprising that no direct evidence of discrimination\nwas found in the unprecedented legislative discovery.\n      The district court did not rely on Fraser’s statements to explain away the\nlack of a “smoking gun” in the legislative record or discovery. See Veasey v.\nPerry, 71 F. Supp. 3d 627, 702 (S.D. Tex. 2014). At most, his testimony reflects\nsimple and uncontroversial facts.\n      Senator Fraser’s deposition excerpts were read into the record by the\nState during the Veasey trial. The majority opinion quotes from the plaintiff’s\n“cross-examination” portion. When asked if it was his belief “that the public\nlegislative record would either go to the Department of Justice or a three-judge\npanel as part of the Section 5 review process,” Senator Fraser testified that he\n“did believe it would go one of those two places.”    Senator Fraser was then\nasked if this made him consider “what sort of statements [he] made on the\nSenate Floor?” Senator Fraser did not respond that he was especially careful\nin his floor statements about SB 14 or anything even close to that. Instead, he\n\n                                      116\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530    Page: 117   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\nsimply responded that he “was aware that everything [he] was saying was part\nof the public record.”\n      Senator Fraser’s testimony does not support the inference that SB 14\nproponents were unusually careful about what they wrote and said.\nSenator Fraser’s awareness that the public legislative record would be\nscrutinized by the Justice Department or a three-judge court under the\npreclearance process is a statement of fact. Between 1975 and 2013, any\nchange in Texas voting procedures had to be “approved by federal authorities\nin Washington, D.C.—either the Attorney General or a court of three judges.”\nShelby Cty. v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2620 (2013).\n      Senator Fraser’s statement that he was aware that his Senate Floor\nstatements would be part of the public record is also a fact. The legislative\nrecord is a matter of public record under the Texas Constitution. See TEX.\nCONST. art. III, § 12(a). The Texas Senate Staff Services office makes the audio\nrecordings of all Senate Floor proceedings available to the public free of charge.\n      Most importantly, however, the facts conveyed by Senator Fraser are not\nprobative about why the unprecedented discovery into the private\ncorrespondence and documents of SB 14 proponents turned up no evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent. Senator Fraser’s testimony deals with public records\nand floor statements. It says nothing about why SB 14 proponents would have\ncensored themselves privately. Based on Arlington Heights, no one could have\npredicted a federal court would order such unprecedented discovery from\nSenator Fraser or the Legislature.\n      The majority also emphasizes a piece of deposition testimony by Bryan\nHebert, the deputy general counsel for the Lt. Governor, that he sent an email\nreminding senators to emphasize the “detection and deterrence of fraud and\nprotecting public confidence in elections as the goal of SB 14.”\n                                        117\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 118   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n      Once again, the district court did not rely on this statement of\nMr. Hebert. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 702. Hebert’s statement\nwas made in an email sent to various Senate staffers laying out plans for the\nfloor debate on SB 14.         He characterized it as “an attempt to—at\nbest . . . outline . . . how things might go.”    Stressing the detection and\ndeterrence of fraud and promoting public confidence in elections was listed as\na “floor task” because, as Hebert understood it, “that was the goal of the bill.”\n      Hebert’s statement is not probative of why there would be no evidence\nturned up in the private legislative discovery. Hebert’s statement merely urges\nthe use of talking points in Senate Floor speeches. Politicians emphasize and\nreemphasize talking points because they are effective, not because they are\nseeking to cover up ulterior motives. See Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310,\n364, 130 S. Ct. 876, 912 (2010) (“[S]ound bites, talking points, and scripted\nmessages . . . dominate the 24–hour news cycle.”). Hebert’s statement offers\nno support for the proposition that the plaintiffs’ failure to uncover evidence of\ndiscrimination can be ascribed to a cover-up by SB 14 proponents.\n      3. Legislators were “aware” of racial disparate impact\n\n\n      The majority opinion also contends that SB 14 proponents were aware of\nthe disproportionate impact it would have on minority voters. The majority\nrelies on three statements.     First, in his deposition, Representative Todd\nSmith, a proponent of SB 14 in the Texas House of Representatives, was asked\nif he recalled the conclusions of studies he read about the effect of voter ID laws\non minorities. Smith testified that he did not recall the conclusions, but that\n“there’s a study for every conclusion that you want to reach.” Smith then more\nor less volunteered that, in his opinion, it was “common sense” that “the people\n\n\n                                       118\n\f   Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530         Page: 119    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-41127\nthat do not have photo IDs [are] more likely to be minority.” 18 Second, Hebert\ntestified that it was “possible” that an indigency affidavit provision would have\nreduced the burden on poor voters and that he suspected, but did not know,\nthat poor voters were disproportionately minority.            Contemporaneous with\nSB 14’s passage, Hebert prepared a memo for other Senate staffers in which\nhe opined that it was doubtful that SB 14 would be precleared by the Justice\nDepartment without additional IDs.              His memo is entirely an opinion\npredicated on a comparison of SB 14 to a Georgia voter ID law that obtained\npreclearance.     It provides only some support for the proposition that the\ndisparate impact of SB 14 was known among legislative staffers. Unmentioned\nby the majority (or the district court) is Hebert’s further opinion that though\nhe was “unclear” how a three-judge court might rule, they “might be more\nfavorable” to preclearing the law. 19\n      These three statements were the universe relied upon by the district\ncourt for the proposition that it was “clear that the legislature knew that\nminorities would be most affected by the voter ID law.” Veasey v. Perry,\n71 F. Supp. 3d at 657–58.\n      The majority opinion uses the “common sense” opinion of a member of\nthe Texas House of Representatives and the “suspicions” of the Lt. Governor’s\ndeputy general counsel to leap to the conclusion that “the drafters and\nproponents of SB 14 were aware of the likely disproportionate effect of the law\non minorities.” Even if these statements were enough to imply knowledge on\n\n\n\n      18  Representative Smith’s “common sense” was only partially accurate because nearly\nhalf of those lacking SB 14 ID are White.\n\n      19     The majority wisely does not rely—as the district court did—on the fleeting\nstatement of Senator Rodney Ellis, an SB 14 opponent, who speculated that “[i]n my mind, I\nthink . . . they knew the bill had a disparate impact.”\n                                          119\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 120   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nthe part of the entire Texas Legislature, however, awareness of the disparate\nimpact of a law does not prove a legislature’s intent to discriminate. Feeney,\n442 U.S. at 279, 279 n.25, 99 S. Ct. at 2296, 2296 n.25; Lewis v. Ascension\nParish Sch. Bd., 662 F.3d 343, 349 (5th Cir. 2011) (per curiam).\n      4. Senator Fraser believes the Voting Rights Act has outlived its useful\n         life; Senator Fraser “not advised” about possible disparate impact;\n         Proponents have “largely refused to explain the rejection of\n         ‘ameliorative’ amendments,” an attitude that was “out of character for\n         sponsors of major bills”\n\n\n      Senator Fraser indeed testified at his deposition that he believed the\nVoting Rights Act had “outlived its useful life”; the district court did not rely\non this statement, and with good reason, too, since it has no probative value.\nNowhere in his deposition did Senator Fraser state that SB 14 sought to defy\nthe Voting Rights Act because of the law’s perceived obsolescence. And it is\nodd to hold up his personal opinion of the Act’s obsolescence for an inference of\npurposeful discrimination when it is, in part, shared by a majority of the\nSupreme Court. See Shelby Cty., 133 S. Ct. at 2628.\n      Evidence that Senator Fraser answered questions about SB 14’s\ndisparate impact with “I am not advised” is also not probative of discriminatory\nintent. Senator Fraser was asked on the Senate floor if the “elimination of\ngovernment documents as a form of ID [will] disproportionately affect African\nAmericans and Hispanics?” He responded, “I am not advised,” but he also\ntestified that such an answer merely indicates that the speaker does “not have\nsufficient information to answer [the] question.”\n      The district court relied on a statement from the bill’s opponent,\nSenator Ellis, that answering “I am not advised” was “out of character” for the\nsponsor of a major bill, which indicated to him that Senator Fraser “drew the\n\n                                      120\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 121   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nstraw.” See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 647. It is frankly difficult to tell\nwhat Senator Ellis meant by the comment that Senator Fraser drew the straw.\nBut in no way does Senator Ellis imply that Senator Fraser acted with\ndiscriminatory intent.    Just the opposite, in fact.    Senator Ellis refers to\nSenator Fraser as his “friend.”      Senator Ellis acknowledges that Senator\nFraser stated on the Senate Floor that he did not intend SB 14 to have a\ndisparate impact, and Senator Ellis himself said on the Senate Floor that he\ndid not believe Senator Fraser intended SB 14 to have a disparate impact.\n      The majority states that “[a]nother senator [then-Senator Dan Patrick]\nadmitted at his deposition that he and other proponents of SB 14 voted to table\nnumerous amendments meant to expand the types of accepted IDs, expand the\noperating hours of DPS stations issuing voter IDs, delay implementation of\nSB 14 until an impact study had been completed, and other ameliorative\nmeasures.” This is a fact; there is no doubt that a number of amendments were\nrejected and that the bill’s opponents generally felt that these rejections were\ninadequately explained. See id. at 646–47. But it is incorrect to connect the\nrejection of amendments with Senator Ellis’s “out of character for major bills”\ncomment. Senator Ellis’s comment referred only to Senator Fraser’s “I am not\nadvised” answers.\n      5. Dr. Vernon Burton ties excuse of preventing voter fraud to “Texas’s\n         history of racial voter suppression”\n\n\n      The majority notes that Dr. Vernon Burton ties the excuse of preventing\nvoter fraud to Texas’s history of racial voter suppression. In both his expert\nreport and testimony, he specifically focused on: (1) all-White primaries;\n(2) secret ballots; (3) poll taxes; and (4) re-registration and voter purges. In\neach instance, the majority notes, Burton testified that the laws’ stated\n\n                                       121\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 122     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nrationale was to prevent voter fraud. From this, the majority contends it would\nbe possible to infer the Texas Legislature’s alleged discriminatory intent in\nenacting SB 14 half a century later because the stated rationale was also the\nprevention of voter fraud.\n       This recitation stands at odds with the rest of the majority’s opinion,\nwhich expressly disavows the district court’s reliance on “Texas’s use of all-\n[W]hite primaries from 1895–1944, literacy tests and secret ballots from 1905–\n1970, and poll taxes from 1902–1966” because “the district court relied too\nheavily on the evidence of State-sponsored discrimination dating back\nhundreds of years.” As for the re-registration and voter purges, Dr. Burton’s\nexpert report and testimony indicate these refer to the Texas Legislature’s\npassing a re-registration law in 1966 that was found unconstitutional in 1971 20\nand to a voter purge law enacted in 1975 that was denied preclearance and\nimmediately enjoined—41 years ago. 21 It flies in the face of the majority’s\nconclusion that “the district court’s disproportionate reliance on long-ago\nhistory was error,” to now smuggle in the very same “decades-old data and\neradicated practices” in support of a finding of intentional discrimination.\nShelby Cty., 133 S. Ct. at 2627–29; see also Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No.\nOne v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 201–04, 129 S. Ct. 2504, 2511–12 (2009).\n\n\n\n\n       20  See Beare v. Smith, 321 F. Supp. 1100 (S.D.

The district\ncourt, in turn, relies only on the speculations of opposition legislators, many of\nwhom are plaintiffs in this case, as to the procedural motivations underlying\nSB 14’s passage. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 647–51. The majority\nexpressly condemns the district court because it “mistakenly relied in part on\nspeculation by the bill’s opponents about proponents’ motives,” yet it condones\nprecisely such speculation here. Sadly, neither the majority nor the district\ncourt tells the entire legislative saga as contained in the record.\n      Most of the district court’s pre-2011 legislative history citations are to\npublic websites that show only the results of votes, not to the record or expert\nreports that chronicle the drama behind those results. See, e.g., id. at 645–46\nnn.71–77.    The entire story appears from expert reports offered for the\nplaintiffs   (Drs.    Lichtman   and    Davidson)     and    the   testimony    of\nLt. Gov. Dewhurst, which are necessary to understand the 2011 actions taken\nby the Legislature.\n      First, a bit of background in how the Texas Senate considers legislation\nis necessary. At the start of the session, the Senate adopts by majority vote\nrules that will govern its business during the session. These rules are usually\nrolled over from the prior session and then tweaked accordingly. One rule that\nhas been consistently adopted since World War II is the “two-thirds rule.”\nUnder ordinary rules, the Senate can only consider legislation in the order in\nwhich it appears on the calendar. However, two-thirds of senators present and\n\n                                       123\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 124   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nvoting may vote to suspend the usual order of business and consider other\nbusiness out of turn. In practice, there is basically a two-thirds requirement\nto consider bills in the Texas Senate, analogous to the cloture rule in the U.S.\nSenate. This occurs because of “blocker bills.” A blocker bill is a routine or\nnon-controversial bill, such as one dealing with landscaping at the Capitol or\nthe decorations in the Senate Chamber, that is placed first on the agenda. It\nis intentionally almost never passed.       To get around the blocker bill and\nconsider legislation following it on the agenda, a two-thirds vote is required to\nsuspend the usual order of business. After receiving the required two-thirds\nvote, the legislation can be passed by a majority vote. In a chamber with\n31 senators, 11 can block under the two-thirds rule. As will be discussed, there\nare various ways around the two-thirds rule, many of which are commonly\nemployed.\n      Beginning before the 2005 session of the Texas Legislature, opinion polls\nshowed that a large majority of Texans supported photo voter ID laws.\nFurther, Texas officials believed that some Texans simply did not vote because\nthey did not have confidence in the system or that their votes would matter.\nTo address these related concerns, proponents of a voter ID law began to\nnegotiate with opponents—almost uniformly Democrats—about a compromise\nbill that could pass both houses and become law in accordance with the\noverwhelming public opinion of the citizenry in Texas. Despite voicing private\nsupport for a bill, adding language they believed would address some of their\nconcerns, and general efforts on the part of proponents to compromise,\nopponents remained intransigent. They even voiced private concerns that they\nwere “upside down” in their opposition despite strong public support for a bill,\nbut held out because they feared primary opponents if they voted in favor of a\nvoter ID bill.\n                                      124\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530           Page: 125      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                         No. 14-41127\n       Against this backdrop, the Legislature proposed the first iteration of a\nvoter ID bill in 2005. The majority ignores it, and the district court says only\nthat “[t]he bill, after being reported out of the Elections Committee, passed the\nHouse but died in the Senate Committee on State Affairs.” Id. at 645. What\nactually happened is that after the bill passed the Texas House, proponents in\nthe Senate attached it to another elections bill in order to avoid the two-thirds\nrule in the Senate, which is a common legislative maneuver on related bills.\nSenator Rodney Ellis vowed to filibuster the combined bill, and even came to\nthe Senate Chamber wearing tennis shoes and a catheter to comply with\nSenate prohibitions against sitting and restroom breaks during floor speeches.\nBefore his filibuster could begin, however, opposition Senator Leticia Van de\nPutte invoked a germaneness rule and the combined bill was withdrawn. The\nvoter ID bill was then sent to a House-Senate conference committee, but it was\ndelayed behind several other important measures and could not be considered\nbefore the end of the session.\n       Voter ID was reintroduced in the 2007 legislative session and passed the\nTexas House. Regarding the Senate, the majority says nothing and the district\ncourt says only that it was reported out of committee and “[w]hile the rules\nwere initially suspended to take it up out of order for second reading, the vote\nwas reconsidered and the measure failed. The rules were not suspended, at\nwhich point the bill died.” Id. at 646. 22 The true story is far more enthralling\nthan the district court’s sterile recitation.\n       Eleven opponents of the bill—all Democrats—had pledged going into the\nsession, as was their legislative prerogative, to block any voter ID bill under\n\n\n       22 The “rules . . . initially suspended” that the district court refers to is the two-thirds\nrule; thus, “suspending the rules” refers to getting two-thirds to move a bill past a blocker\nbill, which would be considered first under ordinary rules.\n                                               125\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 126   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nthe two-thirds rule even though Lt. Governor Dewhurst had attempted to\nreach a compromise with them before the session on the substance of the bill.\nHowever, opposition Senator Mario Gallegos was having complications from a\nliver transplant, which meant that Democrat opponents lacked the votes to\nblock the bill in his absence.    Against the advice of his doctors, Gallegos\nreturned to Austin for the session specifically so he could vote against the voter\nID bill. Senator Bob Deuell, a Republican and proponent of the bill, paid to\nhave a medical supply company put a hospital bed in a room adjacent to the\nSenate chamber for Gallegos. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, also a Republican,\nagreed to give Gallegos 24-hour notice before any vote on the voter ID bill\nwould occur.\n      Meanwhile, Democrat Senator Carlos Uresti became bedridden with the\nflu during the session. He was absent from the floor on May 15, 2007, when\nSenator Fraser, the voter ID bill’s sponsor, moved to suspend the regular order\nof business to consider the bill, which required the two-thirds vote. Dewhurst\ntestified that it is a “fairly common legislative practice” to “try and move your\nbill when you have the votes on the floor” and that it happens at least monthly\nin every legislative session. The opponents could not block the bill and it\npassed, with Senator Gallegos voting against it, 19-9 (just one more than two-\nthirds).    Democrat Senator Whitmire was also not on the floor, and\nLt. Governor Dewhurst called on him numerous times before skipping him in\nthe vote.   Meanwhile, Senator Uresti, alerted about the vote by another\nsenator, hastily returned to the Senate chambers as the vote was occurring,\nbut initially missed it.\n      After the vote had been held and the gavel fell, Democrat Senator\nShapleigh moved to verify the vote on the grounds that Senator Whitmire had\nactually been present for the vote and was improperly skipped. Lt. Governor\n                                       126\n\f   Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530      Page: 127   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nDewhurst testified that he accommodated the request because he knew “that\nthis [was] an important bill to the Democrats and to the Republicans,” and he\n“didn’t want controversy.”       He “bent over backwards to respect [Senator\nWhitmire] and his statement” that he was actually on the floor, so a\nverification (i.e. second) vote was held. This allowed all 11 opposition senators\nto vote against it, with Senator Uresti sprinting up the Capitol steps to reach\nthe floor just in time for the vote and Senator Whitmire also returning to the\nfloor. The final vote was 20-11 (just short of two-thirds). No further action was\ntaken on voter ID in the 2007 session after the verification vote failed under\nthe two-thirds rule.\n      Before the 2009 session, where voter ID would again be on the agenda,\nLt. Governor Dewhurst again reached out to Democrats in the Senate who had\nopposed legislation in 2005 and 2007. This was to no avail, as opponents\nremained entrenched. At the beginning of the session, to avoid the two-thirds\nrule that had thwarted legislation in 2007, the Senate adopted a rules change\nthat allowed voter ID legislation to proceed under a simple majority vote\ninstead. The rules change was made by majority vote. Senator Shapleigh\nraised   two   points    of   order   objecting   to   the    rules   change,   but\nLt. Governor Dewhurst overruled them “[b]ecause the rules of the Senate\npermitted a majority of the Senators to change the Senate rules, so . . . [this\nchange] was entirely within the tradition and rules of the Senate.”      According\nto Karina Davis, the Senate Parliamentarian, the Senate has only designated\ntwo categories of bills for such special treatment since 1981: redistricting and\nvoter ID. Notably, both of these categories have to do with elections. This\nmakes sense, as such matters cut to the very heart of how a representative\ndemocracy will function and concern the “highly political judgments,” Bartlett\nv. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 17, 129 S. Ct. 1231, 1245 (2009) (citation omitted),\n                                       127\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 128     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nfor which two-thirds agreement is unlikely. Further, even though the two-\nthirds rule has been suspended by special treatment in only these two\ncategories, the legislative history of the Senate is replete with examples since\nWorld War II of Lt. Governors who got the Senate to pass the blocker bill,\nthereby enabling majority votes on later legislation under the Senate’s normal\nrules. 23\n       Beginning on March 10, 2009, the Senate held a 23-hour hearing on the\nproposed bill that lasted until 6 AM the next morning, at which members of\nthe public could testify. At the hearing’s conclusion, the bill passed the Senate.\nThis time, however, the House would be the source of voter ID’s demise. House\nleaders expressed a willingness to compromise, and included many so-called\nameliorative measures and a provision to delay implementation until 2013 of\nwhatever passed.        Thwarted by opposition in both parties, House leaders\ninstead moved the bill the Senate passed. House opponents decided on a\nstrategy called “chubbing” to kill the bill. 24 This was successful, as House\nopponents chubbed for 26 hours 25 over five days and prevented over 200 bills,\n\n\n       23 The 2009 rules change also provided that voter ID legislation would be referred to\nthe Senate Committee of the Whole (i.e. the entire Senate) rather than traditional committee\nstructures. More on that to come.\n\n       24  Chubbing in the Texas House is analogous to filibustering in the Texas Senate.\nWith a filibuster, a single senator speaks on a topic for a long amount of time in order to\nprevent further consideration.        House rules prevent filibustering, but allow any\nrepresentative the ability to speak for 10 minutes on any bill he favors. To chub,\nrepresentatives use their allotted 10 minutes to speak in favor of any and all legislation,\nroutine or not, that is considered before the target bill. When multiple representatives\ncombine their speaking privileges across multiple bills, they are able to run the clock out on\ntarget legislation slated to be considered later in the session.\n\n       25 There are apparently no records kept on the historical number or length of chubs\nin the Texas House, but information is kept on the number and length of analogous filibusters\nin the Texas Senate. To put the 26 hour chub into context, witness in this case and former\nState Senator Wendy Davis’s 2013 filibuster against abortion legislation lasted just 11 hours.\n                                            128\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 129     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nincluding voter ID, from being passed.              Governor Perry considered, but\nultimately decided against, placing voter ID on the agenda for the special\nlegislative session he later called.\n       After the 2009 session again ended without a bill’s being passed, voter\nID proponents decided that the 2011 session would be different.                        After\nrepeatedly     reaching     out   to   opponents,      incorporating     some     of   their\namendments/suggestions, and repeatedly being rebuffed by extraordinary\nlegislative maneuvering, proponents decided to pass whatever law they could\nthat was modeled after Indiana’s law that had been upheld by the Supreme\nCourt in Crawford 26 and Georgia’s law that had received preclearance from the\nDepartment of Justice. The majority and the district court indict Texas for\nsupposedly being unresponsive to opposition needs and for introducing\nincreasingly strict bills. At least equally plausible is that proponents perceived\na legislative necessity in the face of intransigence on this “wedge issue that the\nDemocrats were not going to agree to regardless of the fact . . . [that] a super\nmajority of Texas voters [of all races] were in favor of Voter ID.” As the district\ncourt put it, “the political lives of some legislators depended upon” voter ID’s\nsuccess. Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 658.\n       To that end, Governor Perry designated voter ID legislation as an\nemergency. He said in February 2010: “I might as well put [the Legislature]\n\n\n\nA 26 hour chub, were it a filibuster, would be good for the sixth longest filibuster in the\nhistory of the Texas Senate and longest since the record (43 hours) was set in 1977.

See Brief of the States of Indiana, et\nal. as Amici Curiae at 12–16, Veasey v. Abbott, No. 14-41127 (5th Cir. Apr. 29, 2016).\n\n                                            129\n\f   Case: 14-41127         Document: 00513601530          Page: 130     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\non notice today: We’re going to do voter ID in 2011. We can either do it early,\nor we can do it late. [The Legislature’s] call.” The emergency designation\npermitted, but did not require, voter ID legislation to be considered during the\nfirst 60 days of the 2011 session. 27 It also meant that the Legislature could\nreasonably believe it would be called back into a special session if voter ID\nlegislation was not passed during the regular session.                     Considering the\nlegislation early in the session, however, had a tactical advantage because it\nwould prevent opponents from chubbing as they had done in 2009. Both\nDemocrats and Republicans also thought that passing the legislation early in\nthe session would “get this issue behind them” so that there “wouldn’t [be] spill-\nover on other issues” for which there was a chance of bipartisan cooperation. 28\nProponents also noted that opposition protestations to early consideration\nwere likely stall tactics similar to those employed in the prior three sessions.\nThe bill 29 was designated a priority of the Lt. Governor and accordingly\nassigned a low bill number, but this does not “expedite consideration of the bill\nin any way except for putting members on notice that it’s one of [the Lt.\nGovernor’s] priorities.”           The majority takes issue with the Senate’s\nconsideration of SB 14 by the Committee of the Whole (i.e. the entire Senate)\nrather than through its traditional committee structure. However, this was\ndone because the legislation was going to be considered on an expedited basis,\n\n\n       27Eminent domain legislation, along with perhaps a couple of other topics, were also\ndesignated emergencies for the 2011 session.\n\n       28   Further, all of the emergency legislation was considered early in the 2011 session.\n\n       29    Actually, nine photo voter ID bills were filed in the Senate, but Lt. Governor\nDewhurst selected Senator Fraser’s and asked him to refile it as priority legislation. Senator\nFraser had been the Senate sponsor of previous bills that failed. That there were so many\nbills filed demonstrates just how politically important voter ID legislation was.\n\n                                              130\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 131      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nand this is a commonly used and effective way to disseminate information\nabout such legislation to the entire Senate. 30 Far from being “unusual,” as the\ndistrict court described it, Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 648, it had been\nused for issues such as school finance and redistricting within the past decade\nbefore 2011.\n       To avoid what happened in 2007, the Senate rolled forward the rule from\nthe 2009 session that allowed voter ID bills to be considered by simple majority\nrather than two-thirds vote. The majority faults the Legislature for this, but\nthe decision is easily explainable on political grounds—the majority party\nwanted to avoid the two-thirds rule that had blocked similar legislation in a\nprior session. 31 Further, as just discussed, the Legislature could reasonably\nbelieve that Governor Perry would call an emergency session to consider voter\nID legislation if not passed during the regular session. The two-thirds rule\ndoes not apply during special sessions because blocker bills cannot be filed, as\n\n\n\n       30 Additionally, legislation considered in the Committee of the Whole can be referred\nto the entire Senate after just 24 hours, so it is important to ensure the entire Senate has all\nimportant information it needs.\n\n       31  As if further evidence is necessary to show that the suspension of the two-thirds\nrule was for political motivations, and not racially discriminatory ones, it is notable that the\nTexas Senate (by majority vote) completely did away with the two-thirds rule in the 2015\nsession. It is now the three-fifths rule, which has the effect of reducing from 21 to 19 the\nnumber of Senators necessary to move legislation past a blocker bill. Under the new\nthreshold in the 2015 session, the Texas Senate was able to pass Republican political\npriorities such as open carry, campus carry, moving the public integrity unit from the Travis\nCounty District Attorney’s Office to the Texas Rangers, and an A-F grading system for public\nschools. All of these bills had been designated, as SB 14 was in 2011, priority legislation by\nthe Lt. Governor and assigned correspondingly low bill numbers. Ironically, Democrats also\npassed a few bills out of the Senate under the new three-fifths rule that would have been\nblocked under the old two-thirds rule, including one that would make it easier for some state\nemployees to work from home and have more flexible work hours.

Voter ID was going to be considered without the two-thirds rule\none way or the other. 32\n       This history thoroughly explains why voter ID legislation as eventually\ncontained in SB 14—which the majority dismisses as not “a problem of great\nmagnitude”—was considered before what the majority believes are other\n“pressing matters of great importance to Texas.” In addition, the 2011 bill that\neventually turned into SB 14 contained several notable provisions. First, in an\neffort to combat multiple types of voter fraud, a provision was included that\nwould have addressed voter registration fraud, in addition to just in-person\nfraud that voter ID laws combat. This provision was removed because the\nSenate has a one-subject rule that prohibited it from addressing this other type\nof fraud in SB 14. Next, several provisions in SB 14 were inserted into prior\nvoter ID legislation at the behest of members of the Democrat minority. For\nexample, Senators Gallegos and Shapleigh were concerned about voter ID’s\nimpact on the elderly, so proponents inserted age exemptions into the version\nof SB 14 that passed the Senate. Additionally, opponents’ concern for the law’s\nimpact on the poor during prior iterations of the bill led soon afterwards to the\nelimination of charges for ID and underlying documents. Thus, contrary to\nwhat the majority asserts, SB 14 was neither unresponsive to the concerns of\nlegislative minorities nor was there a lack of motivation to address other types\nof fraud besides in-person fraud.\n\n\n\n\n       32 Additionally, in order to pass a budget, the two-thirds rule was suspended in the\n2011 session by a procedural move different from that used to suspend it for SB 14. See Ross\nRamsey, Failed Budget Vote Threatens Texas Senate Tradition, TEX. TRIB. (May 3, 2011),\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2011/05/03/failed-budget-vote-threatens-senate-tradition/.\nThe majority reads way too much into the suspension of the two-thirds rule.\n                                           132\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 133   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n      7. Second guessing legislative priorities and why Texas Legislature\n         prioritized remedy for voter fraud without compelling evidence\n\n\n      Ignoring the legislative history of voter ID during three previous\nlegislative sessions, the majority chides the 2011 Legislature for prioritizing\nSB 14 in a busy session without—in the majority’s view—sufficient evidence\nthat there is a problem of in-person voter fraud in Texas to justify SB 14. The\ncourt critiques that SB 14 did not single out mail-in ballots for a special degree\nof scrutiny. Of course, as the majority itself rightly notes, “[t]he Legislature is\nentitled to set whatever priorities it wishes.” These gratuitous observations\nabout legislative prioritization are therefore beside the point as the federal\ncourts lack the expertise or authority to question a legislature’s prioritization\nof various issues. Recall too, that the Legislature also wanted to address other\ntypes of fraud, such as registration fraud, but was prevented from doing so\nbecause of one voter ID opponent’s objection based on one-subject rules for\nlegislation.\n      More significant, however, in Crawford, the Supreme Court flatly\nrejected the majority’s intimation that record evidence of voter fraud is\nrequired to justify the State’s interest in preventing voter fraud. 553 U.S. at\n195–97, 128 S. Ct. at 1619–20. Indeed, the Court upheld Indiana’s voter ID\nlaw in Crawford although the record there contained “no evidence of any such\nfraud actually occurring in Indiana at any time in its history.” Id. at 194. The\nCourt instead noted that “flagrant examples of such fraud in other parts of the\ncountry,” occasional examples of more recent voter fraud, and Indiana’s\nexample of voter fraud in the 2003 Democratic primary perpetrated by\nabsentee ballots “demonstrate that not only is the risk of voter fraud real but\nthat it could affect the outcome of a close election.” Id. at 195–96. Crawford\n\n                                       133\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 134   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nteaches that the prevention of in-person voter fraud is a valid legislative\npurpose irrespective of the number of instances of voter fraud in the record.\nAccordingly, neither the Legislature’s prioritization of SB 14 nor the majority’s\nconcern that there are few instances of proven in-person voter fraud in Texas\nsupports any reasonable inference that SB 14 was passed with racially\ndiscriminatory intent.\n      8. “While cloaking themselves in the mantle of following Indiana's voter\n          ID law . . . the proponents of SB 14 took out all the ameliorative\n          provisions of the Indiana law”\n\n\n      The majority seeks to resist the import of Crawford by arguing that\nTexas’s voter ID law is different because it lacks some ameliorative provisions\nfor indigents that were present in Indiana’s law. The majority takes issue,\ngenerally, with the Legislature’s rejection of various amendments that would\nhave permitted additional forms of ID to be used and allowed the use of IDs\nwith irregularities. The majority also takes issue, specifically, with the House\nof Representatives’ removal of Senator Duncan’s amendment, which would\nhave required a provisional ballot to be accepted if the person simultaneously\nexecutes an affidavit stating that he or she is indigent and cannot obtain proof\nof identification without paying the fee. See S.J. of Tex., 82nd Leg., R.S. 137–\n38 (2011).\n      Setting aside the fact that the majority’s criticism amounts to second-\nguessing the policy choices of the state legislature, the fact that the Legislature\ndid not adopt certain ameliorative amendments tells us nothing about why the\nLegislature so acted. And it certainly provides no basis to infer that the\nLegislature rejected these various amendments because it, collectively, was\nmotivated by racial animus; this remains true even if legislators knew that\n\n\n                                       134\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 135      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nsome of the proposed amendments would make it easier for indigents to obtain\nID. 33\n         Even if, notwithstanding Crawford, the presence or absence of an\nindigency exception is a matter of constitutional significance, SB 14 does\ncontain ameliorative provisions for indigent persons. 34 Election identification\ncertificates, which may be properly used as a form of ID, TEX. ELEC. CODE\n§ 63.0101 (West Supp. 2014), are available free of charge and have been since\nthe bill was signed into law, TEX. TRANSP. CODE § 521A.001(b) (West 2013).\nThe Legislature also passed SB 983, which eliminates the fee associated with\nobtaining a certified copy of a birth certificate in order to obtain an EIC. TEX.\nHEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 191.0046(e) (West 2015). These provisions eliminate\nfees associated with obtaining the underlying documents necessary to obtain\nthe EIC.      There is no showing whatsoever that the Legislature tried to\nauthorize EICs that in practice would not facilitate indigent voters. 35\n\n\n         33See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279, 99 S. Ct. at 2296 (awareness of potential disparate\nimpact is not enough to prove intent). Feeney also held that the legislature’s failure to pass\na bill with less discriminatory impact cannot evidence invidious purpose: the courts are not\nempowered to disapprove laws under the Equal Protection clause for this reason. Id. at 280–\n81.\n\n         34To reiterate, the Indiana law and the Texas law really aren’t that different; and\nmany of the “ameliorative” provisions that were rejected were in fact contained in earlier\niterations of the bills introduced in 2005, 2007, and 2009, at the behest of Democrats, but the\nDemocrats opposed those bills anyway.\n\n         35Furthermore, while Texas may have a comparatively strict law in terms of what ID\nmay be presented, its election laws are quite permissive regarding encouraging voter turnout.\n        These provisions include: an approximately two week early voting period with no\nrestrictions, TEX. ELEC. CODE § 85.001(a), wide availability of voter registration applications,\nsee Request for Voter Registration Applications, TEX. SEC’Y OF ST., http://www.sos.state.tx.us/\nelections/voter/reqvr.shtml (last visited June 28, 2016) (providing online voter registration\napplications), and the flexibility of mail-in ballots without photo ID requirements for the\nelderly and disabled, TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 82.002–003. Taken in “context,” it is as easy, if not\neasier, to register and vote in Texas than it is in many other states.\n\n                                             135\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530        Page: 136   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n\n\n      9. “Contemporary examples of state-sponsored discrimination”\n\n\n      The   majority    asserts   that   “[t]he     circumstantial   evidence    of\ndiscriminatory intent is augmented by contemporary examples of State-\nsponsored discrimination in the record.”      It then goes on to cite several\nexamples, taken from the district court’s opinion, of alleged recent\ndiscrimination by Texas against minorities. This recitation is riddled with\nerrors and on examination, disintegrates into forty-plus year old actions.\n      The majority first claims that “as late as 1975, Texas attempted to\nsuppress minority voting through purging the voter rolls, after its former poll\ntax and re-registration requirements were ruled unconstitutional.” (citing\nVeasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 635).          Thus, the most “contemporary”\nexample that the majority or district court can cite was in 1975.\n      In its next attempt to find recent examples of intentional discrimination\non the part of Texas, the majority credits the district court’s statement that\n“[i]n every redistricting cycle since 1970, Texas has been found to have violated\nthe VRA with racially gerrymandered districts.” (quoting Veasey v. Perry,\n71 F. Supp. 3d at 636 & n.23). This assertion is just plain wrong. The district\ncourt cites five cases as support: LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 126 S. Ct. 2594\n(2006) (2000 census redistricting); Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 116 S. Ct. 1941\n(1996) (1990 census redistricting); Upham v. Seamon, 456 U.S. 37, 102 S. Ct.\n1518 (1982) (1980 census redistricting); White v. Weiser, 412 U.S. 783, 93 S. Ct.\n2348 (1973) (1970 census federal redistricting); White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755,\n93 S. Ct. 2332 (1973) (1970 census state redistricting). In LULAC v. Perry, the\nSupreme Court applied Section 2 and upheld a majority-Black district but\nstruck down another district as dilutive against Latinos even though the Texas\n                                      136\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 137        Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nLegislature had drawn another majority-Latino district to remedy the dilution.\nIn Bush v. Vera, the Legislature’s plan received preclearance, yet the Court\nfound racial gerrymandering because the Legislature increased racial minority\nvoting power when it drew three new majority-minority districts and\nreconfigured an existing one to make it a majority-Black district. In Upham v.\nSeamon, the issues related to preclearance for two districts and a district\ncourt’s power sua sponte to reject legislative choices. In White v. Weiser,\ncongressional districts drawn after the 1970 census were challenged on the\nbasis of the Constitution’s one-person-one-vote doctrine, see Reynolds v. Sims,\n377 U.S. 533, 84 S. Ct. 1362 (1964), and the suit had nothing to do with race or\nthe Voting Rights Act. Only in White v. Regester, did the Court find that two\nmulti-member        state    legislative    districts    drawn      in     1971   invidiously\ndiscriminated against minorities. Thus, in its attempt to find that Texas is a\nrepeat violator of the Voting Rights Act in its decennial redistricting, the\nmajority and district court misstate cases.\n       The majority next faults Texas for the Department of Justice’s objection\nunder preclearance to at least one district in each of Texas’s redistricting plans\nbetween 1980 and the present. To the extent this unattributed statement is\naccurate, this is not probative of the legislature’s intent to discriminate against\nminorities in 2011. Preclearance involved a “nonretrogression” standard, see\nBeer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 96 S. Ct. 1357 (1976), that is far less\nstringent than proving an intentional discrimination claim.\n       In short, the majority’s “contemporary examples” about Texas’s State-\nsponsored discrimination are neither contemporary nor probative. 36\n\n\n       36 Both the majority and the district court, Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 636 n.23,\ncite United States v. Texas, 887 F. Supp.2d 133 (D.D.C. 2012) to say that two of the 2011\nTexas redistricting plans (for the U.S. House and the Texas Senate) violated the Voting\n                                             137\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 138     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\n       10. Many, “shifting” rationales for SB 14\n\n\n       The majority also criticizes the Texas Legislature because legislators\nallegedly proffered various, “shifting” rationales for the law. Citing to the\ndistrict court’s opinion, the majority states that the reasons for the law “shifted\nas they were challenged or disproven by opponents.” Of course, “legislators\nand administrators are properly concerned with balancing numerous\ncompeting considerations,” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266, 97 S. Ct. at 563,\nso it would be unsurprising to hear legislators advancing different rationales\nfor supporting a particular bill.         In this case, however, the depositions of\nvarious legislators who voted in favor of SB 14 revealed a consistent purpose\nbehind this voter ID law: to prevent voter fraud and thereby promote the\nintegrity of the voting process; in the minds of some legislators this would\nimprove public confidence and possibly increase voter turnout. 37 Preventing\nvoter fraud and increasing public confidence are closely interrelated,\nCrawford, 553 U.S. at 197, 128 S. Ct. at 1620; to view the iteration of multiple\n\n\n\n\nRights Act. Both note, however, that the D.C. District’s opinion in that case was vacated by\nthe Supreme Court. Texas v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2885 (2013). Vacated opinions have\nno precedential or persuasive value. See Asgeirsson v. Abbott, 696 F.3d 454, 459 (5th Cir.\n2012). In any case, the Texas Senate redistricting plan was enjoined by a three-judge panel\nof the Western District of Texas and a substitute plan issued by the court in its place that\nfully corrected any legal infirmities in it. The 2013 Texas Legislature subsequently repealed\nits original plan and adopted the court’s interim plan in full. See generally Davis v. Abbott,\n781 F.3d 207, 209-13 (5th Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 534 (2015). The remediation\nundertaken by the Texas Legislature undermines any inference of an intent to discriminate,\nespecially when its original plan could have been kept in place after the Supreme Court\nvacated the D.C. District’s opinion.\n\n       37  See supra note 17 (collecting statements of purpose from the deposition testimony\nof legislators who were proponents of SB 14).\n                                            138\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 139    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nrelated purposes as a cover for hiding a racially discriminatory intent, as the\nmajority asserts is a plausible inference, makes no sense.\n      The majority’s contention that the legislators shifted between these\npurposes when the rationales were “challenged or disproven by opponents,”\nsimilarly proves too much. By this statement, the majority, like the district\ncourt, presumably means that the Legislature did not, in its view, provide\nenough evidence to support its proffered interests in the face of opponents’\ncriticism.   See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 653 (“Although these\nrationales are important legislative purposes, there is a significant factual\ndisconnect between these goals and the new voter restrictions.”).              This\ninsistence upon concrete evidence of the effectiveness of legislation is, as\npreviously noted, clearly contrary to Crawford. 553 U.S. at 204, 128 S. Ct. at\n1624; cf. F.C.C. v. Beach Commcn’s, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315, 113 S. Ct. 2096,\n2102 (1993) (“[A] legislative choice is not subject to courtroom fact-finding and\nmay be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical\ndata . . . . Only by faithful adherence to this guiding principle of judicial review\nof legislation is it possible to preserve to the legislative branch its rightful\nindependence and its ability to function.”). The “shifting rationales” theory,\nthen, offers no support for an inference that the Texas Legislature\nintentionally discriminated against minorities in passing SB 14.\n      11. All legislative measures have conspired to work against African-\n         American voters\n\n\n      Dr. Burton opined that, no matter the party in power, political interests\nhave always worked to deny African-Americans the right to vote: “every time\nthat African-Americans have, in fact, been perceived to be increasing their\nability to vote and participate in the process there has been State legislation\n\n                                        139\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 140   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nto either deny them the vote or at least dilute the vote or make it much more\ndifficult for them to participate on an equal basis as Whites in the State of\nTexas.”\n      This conclusion is belied, however, by materials that Dr. Burton himself\ncites. For instance, the Supreme Court found that Democratic-led redistricting\nin the 1990s led to racial gerrymanders favoring African-American and\nHispanic Congressional candidates. See Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. at 956–57, 116\nS. Ct. at 1950–51.    The Supreme Court rejected a claim that early 2000s\nCongressional redistricting around the Dallas area diluted the African-\nAmerican vote. See LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. at 443–47, 126 S. Ct. at 2624–\n26. In addition, an expert report credited by the district court showed African-\nAmerican and Hispanic representation among state legislators to generally\nalign with their proportion in the total population. See Veasey v. Perry, 71\nF. Supp. 3d at 638.\n      12. “Seismic demographic shift” spurred action by Republicans “currently\n         in power”\n\n\n      The legislative history recited above shows that the struggle over SB 14\ncentered on partisanship, not race. Partisanship, however, is not racism, nor\nis it a proxy for racism on this record.      The majority, however, connects\n“extraordinary procedural measures accompanying the passage of SB 14 to a\n‘seismic demographic shift,’” and suggests that the Republicans in power could\ngain a partisan advantage through a voter ID law. But to repeat: even the\ndistrict court acknowledged that a photo voter ID requirement had wide\nmultiracial, bipartisan public support.\n      Indeed, the Supreme Court in Crawford specifically held that\npartisanship in Indiana’s voter ID law, also passed on a straight party-line\n\n                                      140\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530         Page: 141   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-41127\nbasis, could not defeat the law’s purposes in deterring fraud. 553 U.S. at 204,\n128 S. Ct. at 1624. And although the Supreme Court in LULAC v. Perry found\nthat the Texas Legislature violated Section 2 in one Congressional district it\ndrew after the 2000 census, the Court did not accuse the Legislature of racism,\nbut at most of partisanship.        The “seismic demographic shift” has been\nunderway for at least twenty years—as Republicans took over every major\nstatewide office in Texas.     The inference that SB 14 implies a sudden\nefflorescence of racial bias is contradicted by LULAC v. Perry and is a non-\nsequitur.\n                                       ****\n        For all these reasons, the weak, or unsupported inferences claimed by\nthe majority are contradicted by the overwhelming evidence from the complete\nrecord that negated any racially discriminatory purpose behind SB 14. SB 14\nmay or may not be the best approach to protecting the integrity of in-person\nvoting, but it is the approach that succeeded after more than six years of\nintransigent and uncompromising partisan opposition. The law reflects party\npolitics, not racism, and the majority of this court—in their hearts—know this.\nSee generally Samuel Issacharoff, Ballot Bedlam, 64 DUKE L.J. 1363, 1363\n(2015) (“[A]lthough issues of the franchise correlate with race, as does the\npartisan divide between Democrats and Republicans, the new battles over\nballot access do not readily lend themselves to a narrative that focuses\nprimarily on racial exclusion.”).\nIII.   Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act\n       The majority’s conclusion that SB 14 violates the “results test” defined\nin Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act misconstrues the law, misapplies the\nfacts, and raises serious constitutional questions. This decision stands alone\namong circuit court decisions to date: two circuits have upheld photo voter ID\n                                        141\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 142     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nlaws against Section 2 challenges, 38 others have upheld them as a\nconstitutional matter, 39 but no circuit court has yet invalidated a photo voter\nID law under Section 2.         The majority’s errors lead it to depart from the\nstatute’s text, resulting in the adoption of non-textual and irrelevant “factors”\nthat, in practice, amount to little more than a naked disparate impact test. But\ncf. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc.,\n135 S. Ct. 2507, 2523 (2015) (“[A] disparate-impact claim that relies on a\nstatistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy\nor policies causing that disparity.”). We analyze the majority’s reasoning, then\ndemonstrate why it is incompatible with a proper interpretation of Section 2,\nand conclude by highlighting the constitutional tension created by the\nmajority’s approach.\n       A. Background and the Majority’s Erroneous Approach\n       Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, as amended in 1982, prohibits the\nimposition or application of any “voting qualification or prerequisite to voting\nor standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results in a denial or abridgement\nof the right . . . to vote on account of race or color. . . .” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a)\n(emphasis added). What kind of prerequisite “results in” abridgement? The\nstatute continues:\n       A violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the totality\n       of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to\n       nomination or election . . . are not equally open to participation by\n\n\n       38 Frank v.

The extent to which members of a\n      protected class have been elected to office . . . is one circumstance\n      which may be considered: Provided, That nothing in this section\n      establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in\n      numbers equal to their proportion in the population.\n\n\n      52 U.S.C. § 10301(b) (emphasis added).\n      Congress fashioned this language to overturn a then-recent Supreme\nCourt decision limiting voting rights violations to cases of intentional state-\nsponsored discrimination, City of Mobile, Ala. v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 60-61,\n100 S. Ct. 1490, 1496 (1980). In so doing, Congress was focused largely, though\nnot exclusively, on legislative districting practices whose effects often\nundermined minority representation. Clearly, the formula for a Section 2\nviolation requires less than intent, but far more than a mere racially disparate\nimpact.\n      Contrary to the statute and the Supreme Court, the majority’s discussion\nbegins by misquoting the Supreme Court to say that a Section 2 voting rights\nviolation can be “proved by showing discriminatory effect alone.” The Supreme\nCourt, however, was not misguided; quoted accurately, the Court stated that\nSection 2 was revised “to make clear that a violation could be proved by\nshowing discriminatory effect alone and to establish as the relevant legal\nstandard the ‘results test,’ applied by this Court in White v. Regester . . . .”\nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 35, 106 S. Ct. 2752, 2758 (1986) (hereafter,\n“Gingles”) (emphasis added). 40\n\n\n\n      40  The majority next compounds its confusion in averring that mere discriminatory\neffect can afford a basis for a Fifteenth Amendment violation; the true test is that of\n                                         143\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530           Page: 144     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       The majority acknowledges that in transitioning from redistricting\ncases, epitomized by Gingles, to the new generation of “vote abridgement”\nclaims, courts have found it hard to apply the Section 2 results test. 41\nNevertheless, the majority adopts a two-part Gingles-heavy framework for\nanalysis of SB 14 and other vote abridgement cases. The framework was\n\n\n\n\nintentional discrimination. Bolden, 446 U.S. at 61-65, 100 S. Ct. at 1496-98. The current\nSection 2 amended the Voting Rights Act, but it could not overrule Bolden. Yet the majority,\nin another error, contends that the constitutionality of Section 2 has never been questioned.\nThis is wrong. See Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 990, 116 S. Ct. 1941, 1968, 135 L. Ed. 2d 248\n(1996) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“In the 14 years since the enactment of [Section 2], we have\ninterpreted and enforced the obligations that it places on States in a succession of cases,\nassuming but never directly addressing its constitutionality.”); Johnson v.

Ct. 2647, 2666 (1994) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“It is important to\nemphasize that the precedents to which I refer, like today’s decision, only construe the\nstatute, and do not purport to assess its constitutional implications.”); Georgia v.

Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 418, 111 S.

The majority also claims that our opinion\nin Jones v. City of Lubbock, 727 F.2d 364, 374-75 (5th Cir. 1984), supports Section 2 as\n“appropriate legislation” as applied in this case to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\nAmendments. But Jones predates City of Boerne and applied a “lawful and rational means”\ntest that is inconsistent with the congruence and proportionality test applied today.\n\n       41  The Seventh Circuit found the Gingles factors “unhelpful in voter-qualification\ncases.” Frank v. Walker, 768 F.3d 744, 754 (7th Cir. 2014). Other courts and prominent\nelection law commentators have also been unsettled by the question whether the Gingles\nfactors should apply beyond vote dilution claims. See, e.g., Ohio State Conference of NAACP\nv. Husted, 768 F.3d at 554 (“A clear test for Section 2 vote denial claims has yet to emerge.”);\nSimmons v. Galvin, 575 F.3d 24, 42 n.24 (1st Cir. 2009) (“‘While Gingles and its progeny have\ngenerated a well-established standard for vote dilution, a satisfactory test for vote denial\ncases under Section 2 has yet to emerge . . . . [and] the Supreme Court’s seminal opinion\nin Gingles . . . is of little use in vote denial cases.’” (quoting Daniel P. Tokaji, The New Vote\nDenial: Where Election Reform Meets the Voting Rights Act, 57 S.C. L. REV. 689, 709 (2006))).\n\n                                              144\n\f   Case: 14-41127         Document: 00513601530           Page: 145   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                           No. 14-41127\ninitially articulated in a vacated Sixth Circuit decision and followed by the\nFourth Circuit.

North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 240 (4th\nCir. 2014), mandate stayed, 135 S. Ct. 6, cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 1735 (2015);\nOhio State Conference of NAACP v. Husted, 768 F.3d 524, 554 (6th Cir. 2014),\nvacated as moot, 2014 WL 10384647 (6th Cir. 2014).\n      The first part of the test recapitulates Section 2, requiring a racially\ndiscriminatory burden on voting, which “mean[s] . . . less opportunity” for\nminority citizens “to participate in the political process.” The second part\ndraws from the “Gingles factors” 42 to prove causality between “the burden on\n\n\n\n\n      42   The nine Gingles factors are:\n\n      1. the extent of any history of official discrimination in the State or political\n         subdivision that touched the right of the members of the minority group to\n         register, to vote, or otherwise to participate in the democratic process;\n\n      2. the extent to which voting in the elections of the State or political subdivision is\n         racially polarized;\n\n      3. the extent to which the State or political subdivision has used unusually large\n         election districts, majority vote requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or\n         other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for\n         discrimination against the minority group;\n\n                                               145\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 146      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nvoting rights and the fact that this burden affects minorities disparately\nbecause it interacts with social and historical conditions that have prevented\ndiscrimination against minorities currently, in the past, or both.” (citing\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 47, 106 S. Ct. at 2764 (“The essence of a § 2 claim is that\na certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social and\nhistorical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by\nblack and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.”)).\n      Using the Gingles factors is error on several levels.              First, as will be\nelaborated on later, the statute alone sufficiently describes how violations of\nSection 2 vote abridgement claims are to be proved. The Senate Report cannot\nclaim the same legal status, if any, as that of the enacted law. For present\npurposes, it suffices to point out that the second step of the two-part test,\nlinking social and historical conditions to the discriminatory burden, derives\n\n\n\n      4. if there is a candidate slating process, whether the members of the minority\n         group have been denied access to that process;\n\n      5. the extent to which members of the minority group in the State or political\n         subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education,\n         employment and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in\n         the political process;\n\n      6. whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial\n         appeals;\n\n      7. the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public\n         office in the jurisdiction[;]\n\n      8. whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected\n         officials to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group[;]\n\n      9. whether the policy underlying the State or political subdivision’s use of such\n         voting qualification, prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice or procedure is\n         tenuous.\n\n      Gingles, 478 U.S. at 44–45, 106 S.

The second step is also flawed\n“because it does not distinguish discrimination by the defendants from other\npersons’ discrimination.” Frank v. Walker, 768 F.3d 744, 755 (7th Cir. 2014),\nreh’g denied by an equally divided court, 773 F.3d 738, cert. denied, 135 S. Ct.\n1551 (2014). Section 2 “does not require States to overcome societal effects of\nprivate discrimination,” only their own discrimination. Id. at 753; see also\nLULAC, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, 867 (5th Cir. 1992) (en\nbanc) (“[S]ocioeconomic disparities and a history of discrimination, without\nmore,” do not satisfy Section 2’s legal standard).\n      Second, Gingles did not ascribe talismanic significance to the Senate\nFactors; the Court prescribed a three-part test to gauge the disparate impact\nof multimember legislative districts—before reaching the Section 2 analysis—\nwith the Senate Factors used to confirm liability. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48–51,\n106 S. Ct. at 2765–67.\n      Third, the extra-statutory Gingles factors originated in the Senate\nReport accompanying amended Section 2 principally to guide redistricting\ncases. 43 Reflective of this reality, the Supreme Court, in adopting the Senate\nfactors as an add-on to its test for vote dilution, specifically noted they are non-\ncomprehensive and non-mandatory. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45, 106 S. Ct at 2763.\nThe majority barely alludes to these shortcomings but describes the factors as\n“salient guidance.”\n\n\n\n      43   As one commentator explains, the legislative history of the 1982 Section 2\namendments “focused so intently on representation rather than participation,” Daniel P.\nTokaji, The New Vote Denial: Where Election Reform Meets the Voting Rights Act, 57 S.C.\nL.REV. 689, 709 (2006), that it is a mistake to use that history, embodied in the Gingles\nfactors, beyond vote dilution.\n\n                                          147\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 148      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       Applying this inherently flawed two-part test, the majority approves the\ndistrict court’s finding that SB 14 “disparately impacts” racial minority voters\nbecause they are “more likely than their Anglo peers to lack” qualifying ID.\nThe underlying findings were that 2% of Anglos, 5.9% of Hispanics, and 8.1%\nof Blacks comprise the 4.5% of Texas voters who lack SB 14 IDs. 44 The majority\ncites exactly three individuals—Floyd Carrier, Sammie Louise Bates, and\nGordon Benjamin—who were unable to cast ballots because they lacked SB 14\nID when they went to vote. The majority agrees with the district court that\nthe law’s ameliorative provisions, including the free EIC available at DMV\noffices (which Sammie Louise Bates eventually obtained), a “strict disability\nexemption” from the SB 14 requirement and the alternative of mail-in ballots,\nare “burdensome” and thus ineffective alternatives. 45                   Moreover, evidence\nshowed that nine of the fourteen plaintiffs (including Floyd Carrier and Gordon\nBenjamin) were qualified to vote by mail, but they did not want to. Veasey v.\nPerry, 71 F. Supp.3d at 677. It is a mystery why the majority goes out of its\nway to criticize the use of mail-in ballots for hundreds of thousands of senior\ncitizens. No court has ever held that a voter has a right to cast a ballot by the\nmethod of his choice. 46\n\n\n       44  Largely from experts and statistically-based proof arises the finding that SB 14\n“disproportionately impacted the poor” who are less likely to have an ID, less likely to avail\nthemselves of services requiring one, and for whom “[e]ven obtaining an EIC poses an\nobstacle” given the difficulties for some in obtaining birth certificates and travelling to DMV\noffices.\n\n       45  The majority neglects to mention other exemptions to the photo ID requirements\nfor religious accommodation and disaster loss.\n\n       46 McDonald v. Bd. of Election Comm’rs of Chi., 394 U.S. 802, 89 S. Ct. 1404 (1969)\n(upholding a statute allowing some, but not other, citizens to vote absentee). Laws that\nrequire voters to cast different kinds of ballots are valid so long as there is “some rational\nrelationship to a legitimate state end.” Id. at 809, 1408; see also Biener v. Calio, 361 F.3d 206,\n215 (3d Cir. 2004). The State of Oregon requires all ballots be cast by mail. Moreover, the\n                                              148\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 149      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\n       The majority moves on to the Gingles factors for proof that the disparate\nimpact of SB 14 on ID possession “interacts with social and historical\nconditions” to cause unequal electoral opportunities for Blacks and\nHispanics. 47 Although there are nine Gingles factors, from which the majority\nculls seven, only two really make a difference:                      the “effects of past\ndiscrimination” and the “tenuousness of policies underlying the law.” Even if\nall of the other five Gingles factors favored the plaintiffs—which they do\nnot 48—no case could be made to invalidate SB 14 without twin conclusions that\nthe “effects of past discrimination” led to a disparity of ID possession and that\nthe purposes of the law are “tenuous.” Thus, these two factors form the slender\ncore of the majority’s “causal link.” And they are slender indeed.\n       Gingles Factor 5, the “effects of past discrimination,” comprised on this\nrecord comparative socioeconomic data on employment rates, income,\neducational attainment, and health outcomes.                 That these (unfortunately)\nreflect differences among Whites, Blacks and Hispanics is a sociological fact in\nTexas as elsewhere.         The majority attempts to, but does not successfully\n\n\n\ngreatest fraud risk exists when unauthorized persons direct an elderly, immobile voter’s\nchoices on a mail-in ballot. That the ballots could get lost or stolen from the mail is no more\nof a risk than the loss of a Social Security check.\n\n       47  Space does not permit elaboration, but the majority defends its application of the\nGingles factors in part by repeatedly mischaracterizing and distorting the State’s arguments.\n       48 Two Gingles factors, the existence of racially polarized voting and the lack of racial\n\ncampaign appeals, are plainly irrelevant here. Another factor, the history of state-sponsored\ndiscrimination recounted by the majority has already been shown to be legally unsupported,\nsee discussion supra, and “long-ago.” The Legislature that passed SB 14 had virtually\nproportional minority representation, rendering another Gingles factor, the extent of elected\nminority officials throughout the state, beside the point. Finally, showing the Legislature as\n“unresponsive” to minorities solely with reference to the 2011 events preceding passage of\nSB 14 fundamentally misunderstands this Gingles factor, which relates to the overall\nconduct of representative government as it applies to legislative districting; moreover, as has\nbeen shown, the majority and district court did not read the legislative record over the past\nfour sessions and six years.\n                                             149\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 150     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nconnect these findings to contemporary discrimination by the state of Texas. 49\nThe majority goes out of its way, however, to assert that it “does not decide”\nwhether this factor can only be satisfied by a legacy of official state\ndiscrimination. The majority is wrong yet again. The Supreme Court recently\nreaffirmed that state entities should not bear legal responsibility “for racial\ndisparities they did not create.” Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523; see\nalso Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 278, 99 S. Ct. 2282, 2295\n(1979) (refusing to hold state liable for sex discrimination in U.S. military);\nMilliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 745, 94 S. Ct. 3112, 3127 (1974) (remedy\ncannot be imposed on other government bodies not having been shown to\nviolate Constitution).\n       The majority also adopts the finding that minorities’ disproportionately\nlower socioeconomic status “hinders their participation in the electoral\nprocess.” But while on one hand, the majority credits an expert opinion that\nminority voters are probably inhibited by the voter ID requirement from\ncasting ballots, the majority forcefully disclaims, on the other hand, that\nGingles factor 5 embodies any actual requirement for evidence of the law’s\neffect on voter turnout. Indeed, no evidence in the record supports a link\nbetween requiring SB 14 IDs for voting and diminished turnout.                      Despite\ntestimony from a handful of voters, not one of the plaintiff organizations in this\n\n\n\n\n       49 The majority references the district court’s opinion, Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp.3d\nat 666, which adverts to general socioeconomic data and specifically recites employment\ndiscrimination cases settled in the past twelve years by two state and two municipal entities,\nand disparate school discipline procedures (which can’t be attributed to the State). The court\nreferences desegregation of Texas schools, which occurred over forty years ago. In sum, the\nmajority has no evidence of current discriminatory practices by the state in housing,\neducation, or employment.\n\n                                            150\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530           Page: 151     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\ncase offered testimony that a single one of their members had been prevented\nfrom voting by SB 14. The DOJ thoroughly canvassed the state of Texas in\nsearch of voters “disenfranchised” by SB 14 and found none.                       The State’s\nwitness—Keith Ingram, the director of the Elections Division of the Texas\nSecretary of State—stated that the number of voters who have been unable to\npresent a qualifying ID were “vanishingly small,” even after three statewide\nelections, six special elections, and numerous local elections that have taken\nplace under the law. 50\n       Regarding Gingles factor 9, the “tenuousness of policies underlying the\nlaw,” the majority approves of the district court’s empirical analysis of SB 14\nand finds “a total disconnect between the State’s announced interests and the\nstatute enacted.” But cf. Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla. Inc., 348 U.S. 483,\n488, 75 S. Ct. 461, 464 (1955) (“The day is gone when [courts] . . . strike down\nstate laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may\nbe unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of\nthought.”). 51 The majority pays lip service to Crawford, which ruled evidence\nof actual in-person Indiana voter fraud irrelevant to upholding a voter ID law\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment, but pivots and concludes that this Gingles\nextra-statutory factor permits intrusive judicial second-guessing of the\n\n\n       50  The majority disclaims the necessity of a proven turnout effect because it is\nallegedly too difficult to prove. The reality, however, is that such effects simply have not been\nfound by researchers who have investigated voter ID law. See, e.g., Samuel Issacharoff,\nBallot Bedlam, 64 DUKE L.J. 1363, 1377-86 (2015); Michael D. Gilbert, The Problem of Voter\nFraud, 115 COLUM. L. REV. 739, 746-50, 749 n.53 (2015); Michael J. Pitts, Empirically\nMeasuring the Impact of Photo Id over Time and Its Impact on Women, 48 IND. L. REV. 605,\n605-07 (2015).\n\n       51 The majority’s citation to St. Joseph Abbey v. Castille, 712 F.3d 215, 225–26 (5th\nCir. 2013), is inapt because it is a one-of-a-kind ruling to the contrary, and it concerns\neconomic regulation.\n\n                                              151\n\f   Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530       Page: 152     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-41127\nlegislation. The majority avers that there is hardly any evidence of in-person\nvoter fraud in Texas—the Senatorial election of “Landslide Lyndon” Johnson\nin 1948 seems to have been forgotten—and there is no proof that voter\nconfidence in the integrity of the ballot is enhanced by requiring voters to prove\ntheir ID at the polls—despite the opinion polls showing the overwhelming\npopularity of photo ID requirements. 52 Even if the district court’s findings are\ntaken at face value, however, this conclusion proves too much. If requiring a\nphoto voter ID has no rational basis, as the majority concludes, the entire law,\nnot simply its application to minority voters, would be indicted.\n      The sum of the majority’s reasoning, despite its emphasis on “an\nintensely local appraisal” and its incantation of seven Gingles factors, boils\ndown to these propositions:\n      (1) SB 14 specifically burdens Texans living in poverty, who are\n      less likely to possess qualified photo ID, are less able to get it, and\n      may not otherwise need it; (2) a disproportionate number of Texans\n      living in poverty are African–Americans and Hispanics; and\n      (3) African–Americans and Hispanics are more likely than Anglos\n      to be living in poverty because they continue to bear the\n      socioeconomic effects caused by decades of racial discrimination.\n(citing Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 664). As a result of finding a racial\ndisparity among those who possess or have access to SB 14 IDs and using the\nGingles factors, the majority affirms a Section 2 violation. Liability therefore\nturns, under the majority’s approach, on essentially three conclusions. First,\na particular regulation has a “disparate impact” because it creates an\nadditional voting burden upon poor, disproportionately minority voters.\nSecond, Texas has a history of official discrimination whose effects persist to\n\n\n      52 Moreover, some studies actually show that voter ID laws increase voter turnout.\nSee Gilbert, supra note 50, at 749 n.56 and accompanying text (collecting studies and\ndiscussing rationales).\n                                         152\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 153      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nthe present day. Third, the law in question could have been written more\nnarrowly. 53\n       These conclusions are incredibly open-ended. The first conclusion can be\nmet even though, as here, the law in question disadvantages only a small\npercentage of voters and contains ameliorative provisions and exemptions.\nThe second conclusion is basically a condition of American society, although\ncontrary to the majority opinion, current socioeconomic conditions cannot be\nexplained in terms of any recent state-sponsored discrimination. The third\nconclusion is at war with the Supreme Court’s acknowledgement of the State’s\nand public’s interest in ballot integrity as well as the Texas public’s approval\nof photo voter IDs.\n        Virtually any voter regulation that disproportionately affects minority\nvoters can be challenged successfully under the majority’s rationale: polling\nlocations; days allowed and reasons for early voting; mail-in ballots; time limits\nfor voter registration; language on absentee ballots; the number of vote-\ncounting machines a county must have; registering voters at a DMV (required\nby the federal Motor Voter law); holding elections on Tuesday. Such challenges\nare occurring at the present time. 54\n\n\n       53  Judge Higginson’s special opinion embraces and embroiders the majority’s position\nadopting the Gingles factors to interpret Section 2. Judge Higginson focuses principally on\nracial socioeconomic disparities as the touchstone for Section 2 liability, thus overlooking the\nSupreme Court’s warning that states cannot be held responsible to fix disparities they did\nnot create. He disparages requiring plaintiffs to prove that SB 14 itself caused (“resulted in”)\nthe abridgement of voting rights—while apparently accepting the majority’s legally upside-\ndown view that the state must prove the statute’s efficacy in preventing voter fraud. Finally,\nJudge Higginson’s disparate impact focus would create constitutional tension, to say the\nleast, by forcing states to become race-conscious in avoiding disparate impact whenever they\nenact voting regulations. This result is not a benign “evolutionary” process to “harmonize”\nlegislative priorities with the right to vote; it is judicial micromanagement of race-neutral\nvoting regulations consigned to the states.\n        54 See, e.g., Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless v. Husted, 2016 WL 3166251 (S.D. Ohio\n\nJune 7, 2016) (enjoining under Section 2 and Equal Protection Clause a law that: requires\n                                             153\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 154      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\n       The majority’s rationale, however, is flawed not only as already\nexplained, but simply because it does not correlate with the statute itself.\nSection 2, as the Seventh Circuit recognized, Frank, 768 F.3d at 752, is “the\nsalient guidance” for enunciating violations.\n       B.

Abridgement is less\nthan outright denial of the vote. It is the challenged regulation, here SB 14,\nrather than “socioeconomic conditions” or a “history of discrimination,” that\nmust cause the disparate impact.                Moreover, Section 2(b), the “results”\nprovision, “tells us that [Section] 2(a) does not condemn a voting practice just\nbecause it has a disparate effect on minorities. (If things were that simple,\nthere wouldn’t have been a need for Gingles to list nine non-exclusive factors\nin vote-dilution cases.).” Frank, 768 F.3d at 753. After all, nearly every voting\nregulation poses some kind of obstacle or prerequisite to casting a ballot, and\nnearly every one of these may be potentially more disabling for poor and\nminority voters. 55       The totality of circumstances inquiry, leading to a\ndetermination whether minority voters have an equal opportunity to\nparticipate, also bears the important caveat that perfection, in the form of\nproportional representation, is not mandated. It logically follows that Section\n2 is not designed to abolish every incidental impact of facially neutral voting\nregulations.      Finally, as the Supreme Court has made clear, no citizen may\ncomplain of “the usual burdens of voting.” Crawford, 553 U.S. at 198, 128\nS. Ct. at 1621.\n       Using the textualist approach to Section 2, a vote abridgement claim\nshould be analyzed (absent proof of intentional discrimination) as follows:\nFirst, consider the total impact of the challenged regulation on the voting\npublic.     If the regulation disparately affects minority voters, proceed to\ndetermine whether the particular burden imposed by the regulation, examined\n\n\n       55 The majority opinion admits this in stating that, “[a]ccording to a well-established\nformula . . . to assess individuals’ likelihood of voting in an election, increasing the cost of\nvoting decreases voter turnout—particularly among low-income individuals, as they are most\ncost sensitive.” (citing Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 656).\n\n                                             155\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 156     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nunder the totality of circumstances, deprives them of an equal opportunity to\nparticipate in the electoral process. This analytical process, synthesized from\nFrank, fundamentally differs from that of the majority in three ways. First, it\ndispenses with the Gingles factors. Second, it requires a causal connection\nbetween the challenged regulation and the disparate impact.                           Third,\nSection 2(b) is better read as an “equal-treatment requirement (which is how\nit reads)” rather than “an equal-outcome command.” Frank, 768 F.3d at 754. 56\n       Contrary to the majority opinion, applying the statute itself in this way\ndoes not neuter or minimize minority citizens’ voting rights. The question\nunder Section 2 is whether a regulation “needlessly” burdens those rights. Id.\nat 753. Justice Scalia’s dissent in Chisom v. Roemer posed an inarguable\nSection 2 violation, in which a hypothetical jurisdiction limited voter\nregistration to one hour a day three days a week, to the stark disadvantage of\nthe minority working class. 501 U.S. 380, 408, 111 S. Ct. 2354, 2371 (1991)\n(Scalia, J., dissenting). Likewise, Mississippi actually violated Section 2 with\na dual voter registration law and limited registration offices, which “resulted\n\n\n       56   How the majority can claim its interpretation is “consistent” with Frank is\nincomprehensible. Frank found the Gingles factors “unhelpful” in vote abridgment cases,\n768 F.3d at 754, and applied the two-part test only “for the sake of argument,” id. at 755. On\nrehearing, the court never mentions Section 2 liability but appears instead to foot its\ndiscussion on the Anderson/Burdick claim. See Frank v. Walker, 819 F.3d 384, 386 (7th Cir.\n2016) (Frank II).\n       Moreover, Frank finds no Section 2 violation where the Wisconsin voter ID law\narguably had a higher disparate impact on voter ID possession than SB 14. Compare Frank,\n768 F.3d at 752 (92.7% of Whites, 86.8% of Blacks, and 85.1% of Hispanics possessed photo\nIDs), with Veasey v. Abbott, 796 F.3d at 509 (panel opinion discussing that plaintiffs’ expert\nfound that 98% of Whites, 91.9% of Blacks, and 94.1% of Hispanics possessed photo IDs). In\nother words, far more Texas voters of each race possess the requisite photo IDs; hence one\nmight infer that the scope of diminished opportunity to participate is far smaller across the\nboard in Texas than in Wisconsin. Moreover, the racial spread between Texas and Wisconsin\nin terms of ID possession is about the same in the case of Whites to Blacks and narrower in\nthe case of Whites to Hispanics. On a comparative statistical basis, then, there should be no\ndifference in the outcome of this case and Frank.\n                                            156\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530       Page: 157   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nin” a 25% diminution in Black voter registration. Operation Push, Inc. v.\nMabus, 932 F.2d 400 (5th Cir. 1991).\n      According to the correct, textualist frame of reference, SB 14 does not\nviolate Section 2.   The majority’s finding that a racial disparity “in ID\npossession” exists between Anglos and Blacks and Hispanics is not clearly\nwrong. The majority does not, however, establish that SB 14 “resulted in” or\ncaused a diminution of the right to vote, nor does the “totality of circumstances”\ndemonstrate that minority voters’ opportunity to participate has been reduced.\n      A tailored causation analysis is imperative under Section 2 case law. Not\nonly does Gingles offer ample support for a requirement that the challenged\nlaw causes the prohibited voting results, but six circuit courts, including this\ncourt, have clearly so held. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48 n.15, 106 S. Ct. at 2766\nn.15 (“It is obvious that unless minority group members experience substantial\ndifficulty electing representatives of their choice, they cannot prove that a\nchallenged electoral mechanism impairs their ability ‘to elect’” in violation of\nSection 2). The Ninth Circuit, rejecting a challenge to Arizona’s voter ID law,\nheld that “proof of ‘causal connection between the challenged voting practice\nand a prohibited discriminatory result’ is crucial” to Section 2 analysis.\nGonzalez, 677 F.3d at 405 (quoting Smith v. Salt River Project Agric. Imp. &\nPower Dist., 109 F.3d 586, 589 (9th Cir. 1997)); see also Frank, 768 F.3d at 753–\n54 (voter ID law did not cause minorities to have less opportunity and were\ntreated equally); LULAC v. Clements, 999 F.2d at 867 (5th Cir. 1993) (en banc)\n(emphasizing need for proof of depressed minority voter turnout); Salas v. Sw.\nTex. Junior Coll. Dist., 964 F.2d 1542, 1556 (5th Cir. 1992) (rejecting challenge\nto at-large districts where Hispanic lack of electoral success was caused by\nlower turnout, not dilution); Ortiz v. City of Phila., 28 F.3d 306, 310 (3d Cir.\n1994) (Philadelphia voter list purge law did not cause minorities to be deprived\n                                       157\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530       Page: 158   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\nof equal access to the political system); Irby v. Va. State Bd. of Elections,\n889 F.2d 1358–59 (4th Cir. 1989) (upholding appointive system for school\nboard members where evidence “cast doubt on . . . a causal link between the\nappointive system and Black underrepresentation”); Wesley v. Collins,\n791 F.2d 1255 (6th Cir. 1986) (upholding felon disenfranchisement law because\nthe disproportionate racial impact does not “result” from the State’s\nqualification of the right to vote).\n      SB 14 had no impact on voter registration, the major prerequisite to\ncasting a ballot. SB 14 does not adversely impact over 90% of minority voters\nwho already possess SB 14 IDs or thousands of others eligible to vote by mail\nor any voter who can readily obtain a free EIC. Moreover, the plaintiffs here\ndid not show that SB 14 had any effect on voter turnout or that any disparity\nin voter-quality ID possession was caused by SB 14. The rate of preexisting ID\npossession does not prove “that participation in the political process is in fact\ndepressed among minority citizens.” LULAC, 999 F.2d at 867. To understand\nthe totality of circumstances, at least three subsidiary questions had to be\nanswered: how many of those without SB 14 ID already have the documents\nto get one? Of those without the underlying documents, how many would have\nsignificant trouble obtaining them? And within that much smaller group, how\nmany have actually voted in the past or intend to vote in the future? The actual\nadverse racial impact of SB 14 is not demonstrated by gross no-match list\npercentages, but by the impact on these subsets of the 4.5% of Texas voters\ncurrently without SB 14 ID. The record is bereft of such information.\n      As the Ninth Circuit held, “a [Section] 2 challenge ‘based purely on a\nshowing of some relevant statistical disparity between minorities and whites,’\nwithout any evidence that the challenged voting qualification causes that\ndisparity, will be rejected.” Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 405 (citation omitted); see\n                                       158\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530       Page: 159    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\nalso Frank, 768 F.3d at 753 (Section 2 “does not condemn a voting practice just\nbecause it has a disparate effect on minorities”).         The majority’s opinion\nfundamentally turns on a statistical disparity in ID possession among different\nraces, but instead of showing that this disparity was caused by SB 14, the\nmajority relies on socioeconomic and historical conditions as the causes of this\ndisparity. This finding conflicts with the Supreme Court’s recent instruction\nthat “a disparate-impact claim that relies on a statistical disparity must fail if\nthe plaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy or policies causing that\ndisparity.” Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523. Without a showing that\nSB 14 caused the disparity in ID possession, the majority holds Texas “liable\nfor racial disparities [it] did not create.” Id. (citation omitted).\n       Moreover, past examples of State-sponsored discrimination are not\nindicative that SB 14, the “challenged voting qualification,” caused the\ndisparity in ID possession. After all, the majority itself discredited “long ago”\nevidence of State-sponsored discrimination when it reversed many parts of the\ndistrict court’s finding that SB 14 was enacted with discriminatory intent. The\nmajority’s attempt to shore up a finding of state-action-related discrimination\nwith no more than socioeconomic disparities (and even alleged local differences\nin high school discipline, which can’t be the fault of the State of Texas), fails\nthe test of LULAC, Gonzalez, and Inclusive Communities.\n      Misplacing its reliance on the Gingles factors, the majority also fatally\nerrs in discounting the State’s and the public’s interest in enforcing SB 14. The\nState’s interests are weighty, they are to be treated as a matter of law, not fact\nas the majority does, and they outweigh the insubstantial proof of diminished\nminority opportunity to participate caused by SB 14.\n      In Crawford, the Supreme Court held that the State’s legitimate interest\nin preventing voter fraud is “sufficiently strong” to justify a voter ID law even\n                                        159\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 160    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nwithout any evidence of voter fraud in the record. 553 U.S. at 204, 128 S. Ct.\nat 1623; see also Voting for Am. v. Steen, 732 F.3d 382, 394 (5th Cir. 2013).\nCrawford also approved, without requiring independent proof, Indiana’s\nargument that voter ID laws serve the State’s legitimate interest of increasing\nvoter turnout by safeguarding voter confidence in the election process.\nCrawford, 553 U.S. at 197, 128 S. Ct. at 1620. Nonetheless, the majority finds\nthat these recognized State interests are only tenuously related to SB 14’s\nprovisions.\n      The majority inaptly attempts to distinguish Crawford because that case\nreviewed a summary judgment record and involved constitutional challenges\nto the right to vote, while this case is brought under Section 2 after a full trial.\nCrawford, however, carefully balanced the voters’ difficulties in obtaining\nvoter ID under the Indiana law against the State’s interests, and concluded:\n“For most voters who need them, the inconvenience of making a trip to the\n[DMV], gathering the required documents, and posing for a photograph surely\ndoes not qualify as a substantial burden on the right to vote, or even represent\na significant increase over the usual burdens of voting.” 553 U.S. at 198,\n128 S. Ct. at 1621. Although Crawford does not control the instant case, its\ngeneral conclusion stands at odds with the majority’s implicit determination\nthat “significant” and “substantial” burdens exist in obtaining voter ID for that\nsmall percentage of Texas’s Black and Hispanic voters who do not presently\npossess SB 14 ID.\n      Further, the majority mischaracterizes the State’s interests as a matter\nof adjudicative fact. This court previously held en banc that the substantiality\nof the State’s interest is a legal question to be determined as a matter of law.\nLULAC, 999 F.2d at 871. In Crawford, the Supreme Court confirmed the\nState’s strong interests as a matter of law, as it sustained Indiana’s voter ID\n                                        160\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530       Page: 161    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\nlaw without record evidence “of any such fraud actually occurring in Indiana\nat any time in its history.” 553 U.S. at 194, 128 S. Ct. at 1619. Crawford thus\nelevated the State’s interest to a status of legislative fact, which lower courts\nare bound to respect. See Frank, 768 F.3d at 750 (“After a majority of the\nSupreme Court has concluded that photo ID requirements promote confidence,\na single district judge cannot say as a ‘fact’ that they do not, even if 20 political\nscientists disagree with the Supreme Court.”). The majority wrongly second-\nguesses and subjects the State’s interest in preventing in-person voter fraud to\nroutine factual examination. But see Crawford, 553 U.S. at 196, 128 S. Ct. at\n1619 (“While the most effective method of preventing election fraud may well\nbe debatable, the propriety of doing so is perfectly clear.”). The majority was\nwrong to require record evidence of lack of confidence in elections without voter\nID. See id. at 194, 1618 (“‘The electoral system cannot inspire public confidence\nif no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of\nvoters.’” (quoting Building Confidence in U.S. Elections § 2.5 (Sept. 2005) (a\nreport prepared by a committee co-chaired by former President Jimmy Carter\nand former Secretary of the Treasury and White House Chief of Staff James A.\nBaker III)).\n      Finally, even weighing the State’s interests as a matter of fact, the\nmajority errs. The majority credits the district court’s finding that SB 14 would\ntheoretically decrease voter turnout, yet overlooked that the minimal evidence\nin the record that anybody was actually prevented from voting. There is not\neven evidence that any voter was actually unable to obtain the proper voter\nID. LULAC held that “plaintiffs cannot overcome a substantial State interest\nby proving insubstantial dilution.”       999 F.2d at 876.     It follows that the\nmajority should not reject strong State interests without any showing of an\n“abridgement of the right . . . to vote on account of race or color.” 52 U.S.C.\n                                        161\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 162      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\n§ 10301(a). The majority errs in its treatment of the State’s strong interests at\nstake here.\n       C. Constitutional Considerations\n       The majority claims to exercise “constitutional avoidance” by electing not\nto rule on the plaintiffs’ assertion that SB 14 burdened their right to vote\ncontrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. But the majority has no qualms about\nkeeping alive the preposterous and divisive claim that SB 14 was passed with\nunconstitutional discriminatory intent. 57            And the majority’s extra-textual\ninterpretation of Section 2 runs a severe risk of unconstitutionality. So much\nfor judicial restraint.\n       As applied here, the majority’s two-part Section 2 test authorizes judicial\nmischief in micromanaging a facially neutral state law implementing a\nSupreme Court-approved purpose in order to eliminate disparate impact (in\ntypes of qualified IDs) not caused by the law itself. This result interferes with\nthe Constitution’s assignment of the conduct of elections to the States and is\nnot congruent and proportional as a remedy for violation of voting rights\nprotected by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\n       The     Constitution’s      “Elections      Clause      empowers        Congress      to\nregulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them.”\n\n\n       57 The Supreme Court itself declined to rule on Equal Protection issues raised in a\nredistricting case where the lower court decision might rest on the alternative ground of the\nVoting Rights Act. Escambia Cty. v. McMillan, 466 U.S. 49, 104 S. Ct. 1577 (1984). No such\nforbearance by today’s majority! The majority cites with approval Ketchum v. Byrne for that\nopinion’s broad (but fact-bound) language concerning discriminatory intent and partisanship.\nKetchum, however, refused to rule on the constitutionality of a local council redistricting plan\nafter the district court had found it wanting under a then recently-amended Section 2. The\ncourt noted “[t]his change in the law appears to reflect congressional impatience with the\ninherently speculative process of ascribing purposes to government actions involving the\ncomplex interaction of numerous individuals and conflicting interests. We think it\nundesirable to undertake this difficult [legislative intent] analysis when Congress has\nrendered it superfluous by amending the Voting Rights Act.” Ketchum, 740 F.2d at 1409.\n                                             162\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530       Page: 163   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nArizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2247, 2257 (2013)\n(emphasis in original); see U.S. CONST. art. I, § 4, cl. 1. “Prescribing voting\nqualifications, therefore, ‘forms no part of the power to be conferred upon the\nnational government’ by the Elections Clause, which is ‘expressly restricted to\nthe regulation of the times, the places, and the manner of elections.’” Arizona,\n133 S. Ct. at 2258 (emphasis in original) (quoting THE FEDERALIST No. 60, at\n371 (A. Hamilton); THE FEDERALIST No. 52, at 326 (J. Madison)). This design\nwas for good reason. The Court explained, “[t]his allocation of authority sprang\nfrom the Framers’ aversion to concentrated power,” because, as James\nMadison presciently observed, “[a] Congress empowered to regulate the\nqualifications of its own electorate . . . could ‘by degrees subvert the\nConstitution.’” Id. (quoting 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p.\n250 (M. Farrand rev. 1966)). It is thus “obvious that the whole Constitution\nreserves to the States the power to set voter qualifications in state and local\nelections. . . .” Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 125, 91 S. Ct. 260, 265 (1970)\n(Black, J. for a five member majority on this point); see also Lassiter v.\nNorthampton Cty. Bd. of Elections, 360 U.S. 45, 50, 79 S. Ct. 985, 989 (1959)\n(“The States have long been held to have broad powers to determine the\nconditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised. . . .”).\n      The States’ primacy in regulating elections is limited, however, by the\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which protect different rights. The\nFifteenth Amendment secures the right to vote from denial or abridgment by\nintentional discrimination on account of race or color. City of Mobile v. Bolden,\n446 U.S. 55, 61–66, 100 S. Ct. 1490, 1496–98 (1980); see Rice v. Cayetano,\n528 U.S. 495, 120 S. Ct. 1044 (2000) (striking down law that denied vote to\nthose without Native Hawaiian ancestry); Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339,\n81 S. Ct. 125 (1960) (striking down law that denied vote via racial redistricting\n                                       163\n\f   Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530    Page: 164    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nof city boundaries).    The Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted to\nprotect voters generally from laws that excessively burden the right to vote and\nthe conduct of the political process.     See Crawford, 553 U.S. at 189–91,\n128 S. Ct. at 1615–16; Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 432–34, 112 S. Ct.\n2059, 2062–64 (1992); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 786–90, 103 S. Ct.\n1564, 1568–70 (1983). Understanding the difference between these protections\nis important. Where every aspect of a state’s election code “inevitably affects—\nat least to some degree—the individual’s right to vote and his right to associate\nwith others for political ends,” Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788, 103 S. Ct. at 1570,\ninvalidating ballot-access rules as overly burdensome (absent intentional\ndiscrimination) without a compelling showing would make it impossible to run\nfair and efficient elections. See Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party,\n520 U.S. 351, 358, 117 S. Ct. 1364, 1369 (1997) (“States may, and inevitably\nmust, enact reasonable regulations of parties, elections, and ballots to reduce\nelection- and campaign-related disorder.”).     Accordingly, no citizen has a\nFourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment right to be free from “the usual burdens\nof voting.” Crawford, 553 U.S. at 198, 128 S. Ct. at 1621.\n      Because Section 2 was enacted to protect voting rights under these\namendments, it must be “appropriate legislation,” for the purpose. See City of\nBoerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 516–20, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 2162–64 (1997). “‘[A]s\nbroad as the congressional enforcement power is, it is not unlimited.’” Id. at\n518, 2163 (quoting Mitchell, 400 U.S. at 128, 91 S. Ct. at 266 (Black, J.)).\nClearly, “Congress can enact legislation . . . enforcing” these constitutional\nrights.   Id. at 519, 2163.   And prophylactic measures to deter or remedy\nunconstitutional conduct are “within the sweep of Congress’ enforcement\npower even if in the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself\nunconstitutional. . . .” Id.; see also Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,\n                                      164\n\f   Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530       Page: 165    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-41127\n531 U.S. 356, 365, 121 S. Ct. 955, 963 (2001); South Carolina v. Katzenbach,\n383 U.S. 301, 327, 86 S. Ct. 803, 818 (1966). However, Congress’s ability to\nenact such prophylactic legislation is cabined by an important limitation:\n“There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be\nprevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.” City of Boerne,\n521 U.S. at 520, 117 S. Ct. at 2164; see also Garrett, 531 U.S. at 365, 121 S. Ct.\nat 963. While Congress can employ “strong remedial and preventive measures\nto respond to the widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional\nrights,” City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 526, 117 S. Ct. at 2167, it cannot enact “a\nsubstantive change in constitutional protections,” id. at 532, 2170, under the\nguise of enforcement.        See also Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Md.,\n132 S. Ct. 1327 (2012); Garrett, 531 U.S. at 364–65, 121 S. Ct. at 962–63;\nMitchell, 400 U.S. at 128–29, 91 S. Ct. at 266–67.\n      Section 2 is a prophylactic measure under the Fifteenth Amendment to\nthe extent it prohibits any voting practice that “results in . . . abridgement of\nthe right . . . to vote . . . on account of race” as further elaborated by the totality\nof the circumstances test.      52 U.S.C. § 10301(a).      The results test is less\ndemanding than that of intentional discrimination. The majority’s two-part\ntest, however, predicates liability not on any proven impact on voting but on\ndisparate voter possession of qualifying IDs, a disparity caused not by this law\nbut by exogenous circumstances. The disparity, moreover, relates to a small\nfraction even of minority voters and is found fatal to SB 14 notwithstanding\nthe law’s offer of free EICs to poor voters and accommodations for voters who\nare disabled, elderly, or have religious objections to photographic ID. This\nresult amounts to “prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis.” In re Cao, 619 F.3d 410,\n446 (5th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (quoting Fed. Election Comm’n v. Wisc. Right To\nLife, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 479, 127 S. Ct. 2652, 2672 (2007)). The majority has\n                                         165\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530       Page: 166   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\ntransformed Section 2 from a provision protecting the equal right of minority\nvoters to exercise the franchise to a right of more convenient exercise.\n      Consequently, not only does this expanded right exceed the Fifteenth\nAmendment, but it also threatens the balance struck by the Fourteenth\nAmendment between individual rights and the public’s need for fair and\nefficient elections. Under the majority’s reasoning, a wide swath of racially\nneutral election measures will be subject to challenge, a previously\nunthinkable result under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Constitution’s\nfederalist design. Moreover, using Section 2 to rewrite racially neutral election\nlaws will force considerations of race on state lawmakers who will endeavor to\navoid litigation by eliminating any perceived racial disparity in voting\nregulations.   But it is established that “subordinat[ing] traditional race-\nneutral . . . principles” to “racial considerations” violates the Equal Protection\nClause. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 2488 (1995); see\nalso Inclusive Cmtys., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2524 (“Courts should avoid interpreting\ndisparate-impact liability to be so expansive as to inject racial considerations\ninto” government decision-making.); Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 594–95,\n129 S. Ct. 2658, 2681–82 (Scalia, J., concurring) (avoiding disparate impact\nliability forces third parties such as states to evaluate the racial outcome of\ntheir policies in a way that considers race, and government compulsion of this\nresult violates equal protection principles). This was already a problem with\nthe nonretrogression doctrine in Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, and it is a\nmistake to import it to Section 2. See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 491,\n123 S. Ct. 2498, 2517 (2003) (Kennedy, J. concurring) (“Race cannot be the\npredominant factor in redistricting . . . . Yet considerations of race that would\ndoom a redistricting plan under the Fourteenth Amendment or [Section] 2\nseem to be what save it under [Section] 5.”).\n                                       166\n\f      Case: 14-41127   Document: 00513601530      Page: 167   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\n        In fact, the Supreme Court has been careful to read Section 2 narrowly\nto avoid constitutional doubts. For example, in LULAC v. Perry, the Court\nrejected an interpretation of Section 2 that would have “unnecessarily infuse[d]\nrace into virtually every redistricting. . . .” 548 U.S. 399, 446, 126 S. Ct. 2594,\n2625 (2006); see also Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 21, 129 S. Ct. 1231,\n1247 (2009) (reading Section 2 so as to “avoid[] serious constitutional concerns\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.”); Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. One v.\nHolder, 557 U.S. 193, 205, 129 S. Ct. 2504, 2513 (2009) (deciding case under\nVoting Rights Act Section 4(b) instead of reaching the constitutionality of\nSection 5). A faithful adherence to the statutory text of Section 2 would have\navoided constitutional difficulties.\nIV.     Conclusion\n        Today’s result moves us another step down the road of judicial\nsupremacy by potentially subjecting virtually every voter regulation to\nlitigation in federal court.   According to the twists and turns of the majority\nopinions, purposeful racial discrimination can be “inferred” even without a\nshred of discriminatory utterance—not even one document of thousands of\ninternal communications betrayed such purposes. Equally perversely, such a\ndiscrimination claim can be bolstered by legislative actions from forty to sixty\nyears ago, when Texas was a Democrat-controlled state, whose legacy has been\nrepudiated by current Republican dominance. (Not that party designation\nmatters, but that any legislature’s actions can be probative of decades-later\nactions when the legislature is controlled by the opposing party is bizarre.)\nSimilarly, a Section 2 claim can rest on a marginal racially disparate impact\nestimated from sadly intransigent socioeconomic disparities coupled with a\nstate’s “long-ago history” of discrimination. Voting rights litigation is thus\ndecoupled from any “results” caused by the state.\n                                       167\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 168     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\n      No doubt the majority believes that federal judges are well suited to\nregulate the electoral process. As with many judge-made “solutions,” however,\ntoday’s results will backfire. Judicial decisions will spawn inconsistent results\nand uncertainty, leading the public to question judges’ impartiality. This\ndecision will thus foster cynicism about the courts and more rather than less\nracial tension. Lawmakers at every level will be forced to be race-conscious,\nnot race-neutral, in protecting the sanctity of the ballot and the integrity of\npolitical processes. Finally, these unauthorized and extra-legislative transfers\nof power to the judiciary disable the working of the democratic process, which\nfor all its imperfections, best represents “we the people.”\n      For these reasons, we dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                       168\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 169     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nJERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge, joined by EDITH H. JONES and EDITH\nBROWN CLEMENT, Circuit Judges, dissenting:\n\n         We respectfully dissent for the reasons ably explained by Judges Jones,\nClement, and Elrod.\n\n         The en banc court is gravely fractured and without a consensus. There\nis no majority opinion, but only a plurality opinion that draws six separate\ndissenting opinions and a special concurrence. 1\n\n         Despite deep divisions on key questions, however, the en banc court is\nunanimous in roundly repudiating the district court for legal error on some\nissues. Most significantly, the district judge attempted to wipe the Texas\nvoter ID law entirely off the books―a remedy that the majority rightly observes\n“is potentially broader than the one to which Plaintiffs would be entitled . . . .”\n(Page 77.) The en banc court instead leaves the voter ID requirement essen-\ntially intact. In reversing, all fifteen judges agree that, in the words of the\nplurality opinion, “the vast majority of eligible voters possess SB 14 ID, and we\ndo not disturb SB 14’s effect on those voters―those who have SB 14 ID must\nshow it to vote.” (Page 82.) That is a global change from what the district court\nruled.\n\n         The en banc court is likewise unanimous in reversing the district judge’s\nbizarre declaration that SB 14 is a poll tax. (Part IV.) That is a frivolous claim\nthat never should have seen the light of day. Her holding reveals this judge’s\n\n\n         1This case is an apt candidate for the well-worn saying, “You can’t tell the players\nwithout a scorecard.” Harry Stevens is credited with coming up with these words. Sometimes\nthought to be the inventor of the hot dog, he sold refreshments at Major League Baseball\ngames in the early 1900s. “He also began to sell scorecards to fans with the phrase [‘]You\ncan’t tell the players without a scorecard.[’]”          Harry M.

(Part III.) The plurality opinion properly dismisses\nthose claims, criticizing the district court for ignoring the “well established\nprinciple governing the prudent exercise of . . . jurisdiction that [federal courts]\nwill not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground . . . .”\n(Page 71.)\n\n      The plurality opinion, although charitably allowing the district judge a\nsecond chance to review existing evidence, also roundly and repeatedly scolds\nher for mishandling that evidence and making erroneous findings therefrom.\nFor example, the plurality aptly declares that “some [of the] findings are\ninfirm.” (Page 10.) Some “findings are infirm because of an erroneous view of\nthe law.” (Page 10.) “[W]e hold that much of the evidence upon which the\ndistrict court relied was infirm.” (Page 13.) “Because the district court relied\nupon evidence we conclude is infirm, the district court’s opinion cannot stand\nas written.” (Page 18.) “[T]he district court’s analysis contained some legal\ninfirmities.” (Page 19.) “[S]ome of the evidence on which the district court\nrelied was infirm.” (Page 30.) The plurality gives the district court “instruc-\ntions . . . about the legal infirmities in its initial findings.” (Page 32.) The\njudge is told “to reevaluate the evidence” (Page 32) in accordance with “the\nappropriate legal standards” (Page 31).        The plurality sternly rejects the\njudge’s use of suspect evidence: “[W]e do not agree that such anecdotal evi-\ndence of racial campaign appeals shows that SB 14 denies or abridges the right\n\n                                        170\n\f   Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530    Page: 171   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nto vote.” (Page 64.)\n\n      In sum, the vast majority of the judges on the en banc court have\ndeclared the district judge to have substantially erred in myriad legal\nconclusions and use of evidence, and the court is unanimous in several of those\nreversals. The district court is well-advised to avoid such regrettable mis-\nadventure on remand.\n\n\n\n\n                                      171\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530       Page: 172   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nJAMES L. DENNIS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part, dissenting in part, and\nconcurring in the judgment:\n      I concur in all but part II.A.1 of the majority’s opinion. I respectfully\ndissent from the majority’s reversal of the district court’s finding that SB 14\nwas enacted with a racially discriminatory purpose because, in my view, we\nare bound to affirm that factual finding. The majority opinion erroneously\nassigns legal errors to the district court and, in disturbing the district court’s\nfinding of discriminatory purpose, fails to adhere to the proper standard of\nreview and engages in improper reweighing of the evidence.\n      The district court’s determination that SB 14 was enacted with a racially\ndiscriminatory purpose or intent is a finding of fact. See Rogers v. Lodge, 458\nU.S. 613, 623 (1982). In reviewing the factual findings of the district court,\nthis court is bound by the “clearly erroneous” standard of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 52(a). Id. at 622-23 (citing Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S.\n273 (1982)). “That Rule recognizes and rests upon the unique opportunity\nafforded the trial court judge to evaluate the credibility of witnesses and to\nweigh the evidence.” Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 856\n(1982). “Because of the deference due the trial judge, unless an appellate court\nis left with the ‘definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\ncommitted,’ it must accept the trial court’s findings.” Id. at 855 (quoting United\nStates v. United States Gypsum, 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948)). Thus, if the trial\ncourt’s account of the evidence is “plausible in light of the record viewed in its\nentirety,” the appellate court must accept its findings. Anderson v. City of\nBessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985).\n      The majority does not contend that the district court’s finding of\ndiscriminatory purpose is implausible in light of the record as a whole. Indeed,\nthe majority opinion itself appears to acknowledge that there is a considerable\n                                       172\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 173   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\namount of evidence to support this finding.        See, e.g., Maj. Op. at 20-30\n(discussing part of the voluminous evidence that tends to show that SB 14 was\nenacted with a discriminatory purpose). Nevertheless, the majority reverses\nthe district court because of purported legal errors, specifically, the district\ncourt’s reliance on evidence that, in the majority’s view, is “infirm.”\n      Of course, Rule 52(a) does not apply to conclusions of law, and the district\ncourt’s findings may be set aside if they rest on an erroneous view of the law.\nPullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at 287. In my view, however, examination of the\ndistrict court’s opinion reveals no legal error and no reliance on infirm\nevidence. Instead of correcting legal errors, the majority opinion mistakenly\nlapses into an independent reweighing of the evidence and encroaches upon\nthe district court’s domain, in violation of Rule 52(a)’s clear instruction. See\nInwood Labs., 456 U.S. at 856; Rogers, 458 U.S. at 622-23.\n      First, the majority faults the district court for relying “too heavily” on\nevidence of Texas’s less recent history of enacting discriminatory voting\nmeasures, citing Shelby Cty., Ala. v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013) and\nMcCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279 (1987). Maj. Op. at 13-14. The historical\nbackground of an official decision is “one evidentiary source for proof of\nintentional discrimination, particularly if it reveals a series of official actions\ntaken for invidious purposes.” Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev.\nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 267 (1977). Following the Supreme Court’s guidance in\nArlington Heights, the district court considered, inter alia, evidence of Texas’s\npersistent history of discriminatory practices in the realm of voting rights,\nbeginning with the inception of all-white primaries in 1895 and progressing\nwith the continual invention of new methods designed to curb minority voting\neach time a prior method was blocked by the courts, including poll taxes,\nliteracy and secret ballot restrictions, voter re-registration and purging, and\n                                       173\n\f   Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530     Page: 174     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nracial gerrymandering of electoral districts. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp.\n3d 627, 633-36 (S.D. Tex. 2014).      The district court found that “[i]n each\ninstance, the Texas Legislature relied on the justification that its\ndiscriminatory measures were necessary to combat voter fraud.” Id. at 636.\nContrary to the majority opinion’s suggestion, neither Shelby County nor\nMcClesky limits courts’ consideration of such historical evidence in assessing\ndiscriminatory-purpose claims or proscribes the analysis employed by the\ndistrict court here.\n      Shelby County concerned only the coverage formula for the preclearance\nrequirement under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, and the Supreme Court\nexplicitly stated that its decision “in no way affects the permanent, nationwide\nban on racial discrimination in voting found in § 2.” 133 S. Ct. at 2629; accord\nLeague of Women Voters of N. Carolina v. N. Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 242-43\n(4th Cir. 2014) (holding in a section 2 case that the district court abused its\ndiscretion where it “failed to adequately consider North Carolina’s history of\nvoting   discrimination”    and   instead    “parroted   the    Supreme      Court’s\nproclamation [in Shelby County] that ‘history did not end in 1965’”) (citation\nand some internal quotation marks omitted).\n      In McClesky, the petitioner argued that Georgia’s modern death\nsentencing process was unconstitutional. 481 U.S. at 291. Determining that\nMcClesky had failed to establish that the state had acted with a discriminatory\npurpose, the Supreme Court concluded, inter alia, that state laws “in force\nduring and just after the Civil War” were not probative of the legislature’s\nintent a century later. Id. at 298 n.20. In the instant case, however, the district\ncourt did not rely solely on the more distant discriminatory practices by the\nstate as evidence of the Texas Legislature’s discriminatory purpose in passing\nSB 14.    Rather, the district court considered the various and recurring\n                                       174\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 175     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nhistorical examples of state discrimination in Texas as evidence of the\nunceasing effort and desire to enact discriminatory procedures that would\nsuppress the minority vote.           As the district court explained, this history\n“exhibits a recalcitrance that has persisted over generations despite the\nrepeated intervention of the federal government and its courts on behalf of\nminority citizens.”      Veasey, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 636.              And, because of the\nLegislature’s repeated invocation of ballot integrity concerns to justify\ndiscriminatory practices, the district court concluded that “[t]here has been a\nclear and disturbing pattern of discrimination in the name of combatting voter\nfraud in Texas.” Id. Unlike the kind of isolated and remote evidence the\nSupreme Court rejected in McClesky, evidence of a pervasive pattern of\noperation is relevant to determining whether the legislature’s current intent\nwas discriminatory. While “history did not end in 1965,” Shelby Cty., 133 S.\nCt. at 2628, neither legal precedent nor logic requires that we act as if it started\nin 1965 and close our eyes to the historical context surrounding challenged\nstate action. 1 See W. FAULKNER, REQUIEM FOR A NUN 80 (Vintage Books 1975)\n(1951) (“The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”).\n       Next, the majority opinion faults the district court for its reliance on\nevidence that, in the majority’s view, is “limited in [its] probative value,”\nincluding the relatively recent history of official discriminatory actions in a\n\n\n       1 The majority opinion itself recognizes that this evidence is relevant and probative.\nIn surveying the evidence that tends to support the district court’s discriminatory purpose\nfinding, the majority opinion discusses evidence of Texas’ history of “justifying voter\nsuppression efforts,” including the all-white primary, literacy and secret ballot requirements,\npoll tax, and re-registration and purging, “with the race-neutral reason of promoting ballot\nintegrity.” Maj. Op. at 23. Thus, the majority opinion suggests that this evidence tends to\nshow that the Legislature’s justification of SB 14 as a measure to ensure ballot integrity was\npretext. See id. at 23. But the majority opinion does not explain why this historical evidence,\nwhich may be used to prove pretext, cannot be used to support a more direct inference of\ndiscriminatory intent.\n                                             175\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530       Page: 176   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nparticular Texas county and post-enactment testimony by proponents of the\nbill. Maj. Op. at 14-15, 18. In that respect, the majority opinion explicitly\nengages in reweighing of the evidence. See, e.g., id. at 18 (“While probative in\ntheory, even those (after-the-fact) stray statements made by a few individual\nlegislators voting for SB 14 may not be the best indicia of the Texas\nLegislature’s intent.”). But determining the weight of the evidence “is the\nspecial province of the trier of fact,” and this court may not reject the district\ncourt’s finding simply because it would have assigned different weight to\ncertain evidence than did the district court. Inwood Labs., 456 U.S. at 856.\n      Finally, the majority opinion criticizes the district court for relying on\nconjecture and conclusory accusations by the bill’s opponents in the Texas\nLegislature about the proponents’ motives. Maj. Op. at 16-18. However, in its\nanalysis of the discriminatory purpose claim, the district court did not rely on\nconjecture or conclusory assertions; instead, the court relied in part on\ntestimony by SB 14’s opponents as to particular facts and drew independent\nconclusions from those facts. See, e.g., Veasey, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 702 (relying\non proposed anti-immigration laws and concerns by Texas legislators about\nHispanic immigrants carrying leprosy following census results showing gains\nin minority populations to conclude that “the 2011 legislative session was a\nracially charged environment”). The majority may not simply discard the\ndistrict court’s findings by substituting its own assessment of the evidence for\nthat of the district court. See Inwood Labs., 456 U.S. at 856.\n      In sum, the majority opinion identifies legal error where there is none,\ndisturbs valid factual findings by the proper fact-finder, and thereby exceeds\nthis court’s authority under Rule 52(a). Because I believe we must affirm the\ndistrict court’s finding that SB 14 was enacted with a discriminatory purpose,\nI respectfully dissent in part. However, given that that our court has resolved\n                                       176\n\f   Case: 14-41127   Document: 00513601530      Page: 177   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-41127\nto reverse the discriminatory purpose finding and because of the significant\nevidence tending to show that SB 14 was enacted with a discriminatory\npurpose, I agree that this claim must be remanded to the district court for\nfurther proceedings in accordance with the judgment of the court.\n\n\n\n\n                                    177\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 178    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nEDITH BROWN CLEMENT, Circuit Judge, joined by E. GRADY JOLLY,\nEDITH H. JONES, JERRY E. SMITH, PRISCILLA R. OWEN, and JENNIFER\nWALKER ELROD, Circuit Judges, dissenting as to Part II.A.:\n      The Supreme Court has instructed that when a district court’s findings\nas to discriminatory purpose are “infirm” and “the record permits only one\nresolution of the factual issue,” we must reverse and render. Pullman-\nStandard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 292 (1982). The plurality discredits “much of\nthe evidence” relied upon by the district court, Op. at 13, yet still manages to\ndetermine that remand is the proper course. After accounting for the full extent\nof errors in the district court’s analysis, the record permits only one resolution\nof the factual issue: Plaintiffs failed to prove that the Texas Legislature passed\nSB 14 with a discriminatory purpose. Such a resolution mandates that we\nreverse and render. Accordingly, I dissent.\n                                         I.\n      The district court made infirm findings that rested on legal error in\nconcluding that the Legislature passed SB 14 with a discriminatory purpose.\nThe plurality addresses only some of these errors in a selective and disorderly\nfashion, failing to conduct the appropriate analysis under the Arlington\nHeights framework. See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.,\n429 U.S. 252, 265-68 (1977).\n      In conducting the proper analysis, it is important to bear in mind\nplaintiffs’ heavy burden in imputing discriminatory intent to an entire\nlegislative body. “‘Discriminatory purpose’ . . . implies more than intent as\nvolition or intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the\ndecisionmaker, in this case a state legislature, selected or reaffirmed a\nparticular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’\nits adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Pers.

See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp. 3d 627, 632-39, 700 (S.D.\nTex. 2014). The most pernicious of the measures cited by the district court\npredate the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. In fact, despite some\nbygone history of official discrimination, Texas’s voting practices had so\nimproved by 1965 that it was not included in the original preclearance\nrequirements of the Voting Rights Act. As the plurality must admit, the district\ncourt’s heavy reliance on such outdated historical evidence was error. Op. at\n13-15; see McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 298 n.20 (1987) (noting that\nhistorical evidence not “reasonably contemporaneous with the challenged\ndecision” has “little probative value”). Once stripped of error, the remaining\nhistorical background evidence on which the district court relied falls woefully\nshort of “demonstrat[ing] a clear and consistent pattern of discriminatory\naction by the Texas Legislature.” Allstate Ins. Co. v. Abbott, 495 F.3d 151, 160\n(5th Cir. 2007). There is no substantial contemporary evidence of\ndiscrimination, and far from enough evidence to impugn the intentions of the\nentire Legislature in passing SB 14.\n      Second, the plurality fails to address the “specific sequence of events\nleading up [to] the challenged decision,” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267,\nbut an analysis of this factor makes clear that the district court erred. In\nArlington Heights, the Supreme Court explained that courts should look to\nwhether, for example, a legislative decision was precipitated by a sudden\nchange in circumstances. See id. at 267 & n.16 (collecting cases and providing\n                                       179\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530       Page: 180   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nexample of sudden change in zoning laws after learning of plans to erect\nintegrated housing). Here, the district court relied on evidence that SB 14\nbecame “increasingly harsh” in each successive draft. Veasey, 71 F. Supp. 3d at\n700. That is not the type of specific-sequence evidence, however, envisioned by\nthe Court in Arlington Heights. The events leading up to the enactment of SB\n14 demonstrate that lawmakers were concerned about protecting the integrity\nof elections, a concern backed by surveys showing that Texas voters of all races\nagreed with this goal and supported requiring photo IDs to vote. There is no\nevidence of sudden changed circumstances; in fact, the district court noted that\nSB 14 was debated over a lengthy six-year period. Id.\n      Third, the plurality claims that certain procedural departures by the\nLegislature provide a “potential link” in the “circumstantial totality of\nevidence” of possible discriminatory purpose. Op. at 24. But, as the plurality\nconcedes, “context matters.” Id. Viewed in the appropriate context, the\nprocedural maneuvers employed by the Legislature occurred precisely because\nopponents of the legislation—several of whom are the very parties who brought\nthis lawsuit—blocked three earlier iterations of voter ID legislation over the\ncourse of several years. While the Legislature made some departures from its\nnormal procedural sequence in passing SB 14, these departures are easily\nexplained as a way to avoid the obstructive tactics that had repeatedly defeated\nvoter ID bills in past sessions. In other words, the political effectiveness of SB\n14’s opponents precipitated the Legislature’s procedural departures.\n      The plurality makes much of the Legislature’s passage of SB 14 in the\nmidst of other “pressing matters of great importance to Texas.” Op. at 26. In\ndoing so, the plurality only feigns deference to the legislative process by\nclaiming that the Legislature “is entitled to set whatever priorities it wishes.”\nId. at 25. We are not entitled to supplement our policy preferences for that of\n                                       180\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 181   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nthe Legislature, and speculation such as what “one might expect” a legislature\nto do, id., is not evidence of discriminatory purpose. It would be improper for\nthe district court to infer discriminatory intent on behalf of the Legislature by\nsecond guessing legislative priorities. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265\n(“[I]t is because legislators and administrators are properly concerned with\nbalancing numerous competing considerations that courts refrain from\nreviewing the merits of their decisions, absent a showing of arbitrariness or\nirrationality.”).\n      Fourth, the State’s purposes in passing SB 14 were protecting the\nsanctity of voting, avoiding voter fraud, and promoting public confidence in the\nvoting process—motives that are unquestionably legitimate. See Crawford v.\nMarion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 196 (2008) (“There is no question about\nthe legitimacy or importance of the State’s interest in counting only the votes\nof eligible voters. . . . While the most effective method of preventing election\nfraud may well be debatable, the propriety of doing so is perfectly clear.”). The\nfit between the law’s goals and provisions does not show it was enacted with\ndiscriminatory intent.\n      Fifth, the district court identified no reliable legislative history or\ncontemporary statements that reveal discriminatory purpose. “The legislative\nor administrative history may be highly relevant, especially where there are\ncontemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body, minutes of\nits meetings, or reports.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268. “In some\nextraordinary instances the members might be called . . . to testify concerning\nthe purpose of the official action . . . .” Id. As the Supreme Court has long\nrecognized, however, “[p]lacing a decisionmaker on the stand is . . . ‘usually to\nbe avoided’” because “judicial inquiries into legislative or executive motivation\n\n\n                                      181\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530       Page: 182    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\nrepresent a substantial intrusion into the workings of other branches of\ngovernment.” Id. at 268 n.18.\n      The district court relied in large part on accusations by the bill’s\nopponents about proponents’ motives. See Veasey, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 655-57.\nSuch biased conjecture cannot form the basis of a finding of discriminatory\nintent by the entire Legislature. See United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367,\n384 (1968) (“What motivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is\nnot necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it, and the stakes are\nsufficiently high for us to eschew guesswork.”).\n      Despite discrediting this unreliable evidence, the plurality still\ndetermines that “circumstantial evidence . . . could support a finding of\ndiscriminatory purpose.” Op. at 21. The primary evidence cited by the plurality\nis that “[t]he record shows that drafters and proponents of SB 14 were aware\nof the likely disproportionate effect of the law on minorities . . . .” Id. at 22. The\nplurality further cites a “backdrop of warnings that SB 14 would have a\ndisparate impact on minorities.” Id. at 26. The plurality misunderstands the\nlaw: the Supreme Court has made clear that mere awareness of a disparate\nimpact (even assuming arguendo it existed here) is not enough to prove\ndiscriminatory intent. Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279 (holding discriminatory purpose\nrequires more than “awareness of consequences”; legislature must have\n“selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’\nnot merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group”); Price v.\nAustin Indep. School Dist., 945 F.2d 1307, 1319 (5th Cir. 1991) (“Feeney stands\ndirectly for the proposition that foreseeability of discriminatory impact,\nwithout more, does not constitute the forbidden discriminatory purpose.”). The\nplurality’s mistaken understanding of the law only encourages further “infirm”\nfindings based on “an erroneous view of the law” by the district court, whose\n                                        182\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 183    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nreasoning and findings even the plurality now roundly discredits. Pullman-\nStandard, 456 U.S. at 292.\n      The plurality also overlooks the total absence of direct evidence of a\ndiscriminatory purpose and the effect of plaintiffs’ failure to unearth such\nevidence—despite repeated assertions that such evidence exists. The district\ncourt allowed plaintiffs to develop an extensive discovery record that included\nthousands of documents, numerous and lengthy depositions, and confidential\nemail communications, all on plaintiffs’ assertion that such discovery would\noffer critical evidence of discriminatory motive. In the end, this intrusive\nsearch—typically reserved only for “extraordinary” cases—yielded no such\nevidence. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268. Despite no smoking gun that\nwould show discriminatory intent in the voluminous evidence, the plurality\nasserts that we should instead look to circumstantial evidence to infer intent,\nas an “invidious purpose” may be “hiding.” Op. at 30. The Court in Arlington\nHeights noted the need to consider circumstantial evidence in cases where\ntestimony by the actual decisionmakers was “barred by privilege.” 429 U.S. at\n268. But, as we found in Price v. Austin Independent School District, where\ndecisionmakers are called to testify about their actions and “the justifications\nadvanced in their testimony do not demonstrate a pretext for intentionally\ndiscriminatory actions, the logic of Arlington Heights suggests that the [direct]\nevidence . . . is actually stronger than the circumstantial evidence proffered\nby the plaintiffs.” 945 F.2d at 1318. Here too, the direct evidence, and plaintiffs’\nfailure to demonstrate discriminatory purpose from it, overwhelmingly favor a\nfinding of no discriminatory intent. As the panel correctly noted, it is rather\nunlikely that a discriminatory motive “would permeate a legislative body and\nnot yield any private memos or emails.” Veasey v. Abbott, 796 F.3d 487, 503\nn.16 (5th Cir. 2015), reh’g en banc granted, 815 F.3d 958.\n                                        183\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 184   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\n      The Supreme Court has recognized the gravity of judicial inquiries into\nalleged improper motives by a legislative body. O’Brien, 391 U.S. at 383-84\n(stating that judicial “[i]nquiries into congressional motives or purposes are a\nhazardous matter” and the “stakes are . . . high”). The plurality takes lightly\nthe aspersions it casts on the Legislature by allowing such a weak evidentiary\nrecord to potentially support a finding of racial animus. When there is no “proof\nthat a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision,” as\nis the case here, we owe “judicial deference.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at\n265-66. The plurality abjures such deference and encourages witch hunts for\nracism.\n                                       II.\n      The record permits only one conclusion in this inquiry after applying the\nappropriate legal standards and discounting the infirm findings by the district\ncourt: Plaintiffs have not proven that the Texas Legislature acted with a\ndiscriminatory intent in enacting SB 14. See Pullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at\n292. Despite extensive discovery of legislators’ private materials, plaintiffs\nhave brought forth no direct evidence of discriminatory intent. What evidence\nremains, after accounting for the district court’s errors, does not suffice to\nconclude that SB 14 was enacted “‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’” a\ndisparate impact on minorities. Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279.\n      The record below was fully developed. Because plaintiffs “simply failed\nto carry their burden of proving that discriminatory purpose was a motivating\nfactor in the [Legislature’s] decision,” the district court should not be allowed\nto conduct any re-weighing of the evidence. Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 270-\n71. There is no reason to permit plaintiffs—who have not carried their\nburden—another opportunity to prove their case. See id. at 271 (“This\nconclusion ends the constitutional inquiry.”). Unfortunately, the plurality\n                                      184\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530     Page: 185    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-41127\nchooses to provide plaintiffs another chance and leaves the district court with\na disorganized, piecemeal analysis of the Arlington Heights factors that\nconfuses the law and offers no clear direction on remand.\n      For these reasons, I would reverse the district court’s holding as to\ndiscriminatory purpose and render judgment for the State on this claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                     185\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 186      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nJENNIFER WALKER ELROD, Circuit Judge, joined by SMITH, Circuit\nJudge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n       I dissent from all but Part IV of Judge Haynes’s opinion. 1 I agree with\nJudge Jones’s opinion that, despite wide-reaching and invasive discovery into\nlegislators’ internal correspondence, there is no record evidence that any\nlegislator—much less the Texas Legislature as a whole—had a racially\ndiscriminatory purpose in enacting SB 14. The extensive history of obstruction\nby opponents of voter ID legislation accounts for the procedures employed to\nensure passage of SB 14, and none of the circumstantial evidence relied on by\nJudge Haynes’s opinion suggests that the Legislature acted on the basis of\nracism. 2 Judgment therefore should be rendered in favor of the State on\nPlaintiffs’ discriminatory purpose claim.\n\n\n\n       1  Part IV of Judge Haynes’s opinion correctly vacates the district court’s opinion and\nrenders judgment in the State’s favor on Plaintiffs’ claim that SB 14 imposes an\nunconstitutional poll tax.

Because I do not agree with the treatment of the Voting Rights Act claims\nin Judge Haynes’s opinion, I would reach the First and Fourteenth Amendment claims and\nreverse. The First and Fourteenth Amendment claims fail because Plaintiffs have not shown\nSB 14 “imposes ‘excessively burdensome requirements’ on any class of voters . . . .” Crawford\nv. Marion Cty.

SB 14 has been tested many times and there is no evidence in this\nrecord that any voter has been denied the right to vote on the basis of his or\nher race because of its voter ID requirements. 5                   Plaintiffs’ claim rests\nprincipally on the unfortunate socioeconomic disparities that exist among\nvarious racial groups in Texas as elsewhere, but Judge Haynes’s opinion fails\nto establish any link between these disparities and any contemporary\ndiscrimination by the State of Texas.\n       The Voting Rights Act rests on Congress’s authority to enact\n“appropriate legislation” to enforce the guarantees of the Fifteenth\nAmendment. Shelby Cty., Ala. v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2619 (2013); South\nCarolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 325–26 (1966); U.S. Const. amend. 15\n§§ 1–2. The use of that power “must be justified by current needs.” Nw. Austin\nMun. Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 203 (2009). The examples of\ndecades-old state discrimination relied on by Plaintiffs are unavailing. See\nShelby Cty., 133 S. Ct. at 2622, 2627 (explaining that the Voting Rights Act\n“imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs” and rejecting\nreliance on “decades-old data and eradicated practices”).                    Nor does the\nexistence of societal economic disparities render SB 14 unlawful. See Frank,\n\n\n\n       5 To establish a § 2 claim, Plaintiffs must first show that SB 14 abridges or denies an\nindividual’s ability to vote. After an exhaustive statewide search, Plaintiffs identified three\nindividuals who could not vote at one time because they lacked qualifying ID. None is now\nprevented from voting. Two of the three individuals are eligible to vote by mail and the third\nhas subsequently obtained a free election ID card. Out of the entire state of Texas, Plaintiffs\nhave not produced anyone who cannot vote today because of SB 14’s requirements. The\nburden to prove discriminatory effect lies with Plaintiffs. Without a denial or abridgement,\nno § 2 claim can stand.\n                                             188\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 189   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n768 F.3d at 753 (“Section 2(a) forbids discrimination by ‘race or color’ but does\nnot require states to overcome societal effects of private discrimination that\naffect the income or wealth of potential voters.”).\n      The contrary approach taken by Judge Haynes’s opinion improperly\nwould permit challenges to virtually all aspects of the voting process simply\nbecause poverty adds to the burdens of everyday activities and wealth\ndistribution is unequal across racial groups. This distorts the § 2 analysis and\nraises serious constitutional questions. Cf. Inclusive Cmtys., 135 S. Ct. at 2524\n(“Courts should avoid interpreting disparate-impact liability to be so expansive\nas to inject racial considerations” into government decision-making.).\n      The Supreme Court has explained that for most voters, the burdens\nassociated with obtaining photo ID in order to vote “surely do[] not qualify as\na substantial burden on the right to vote, or even represent a significant\nincrease over the usual burdens of voting.”           Crawford, 553 U.S. at 198\n(upholding Indiana’s voter ID law). The requirements imposed by SB 14 are\nnot outside the usual inconveniences expected of citizens exercising their right\nto vote, and, as in Crawford, they provide no basis for overturning a race-\nneutral law by which the State seeks to prevent in-person voter fraud. See id.\nat 196 (“[T]he interest in orderly administration and accurate recordkeeping\nprovides a sufficient justification for carefully identifying all voters\nparticipating in the election process.”).\n      Simply put, Plaintiffs have not shown that SB 14 had any effect on voter\nturnout, that any disparity in ID possession among racial groups was caused\nby SB 14, or that a single Texan is prevented from voting by SB 14.\nAccordingly, I would vacate the district court’s opinion and render judgment\nfor the State.\n\n\n                                       189\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 190     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nGREGG COSTA, Circuit Judge, dissenting from Part II(A)(1):\n       The six years of debate in the Texas Legislature before voter ID passed\ndemonstrates that it is a controversial political question. The opinions issued\ntoday demonstrate it also raises contentious legal questions. And with respect\nto how to assess vote denial (as opposed to vote dilution) claims under the\n“effects” test of the Voting Rights Act, it is a difficult one. Although I join the\nmajority opinion affirming the district court’s holding that the Texas law has\ndiscriminatory effects in violation of the Act, the Gingles factors are not a\nperfect fit for the vote denial claims that have blossomed in the post-Shelby\nCounty world. But for the reasons set forth in the majority opinion and Judge\nHigginson’s concurring opinion, it is the best guidance we have for evaluating\nsuch cases.\n           In contrast to the uncertain legal terrain for the discriminatory effects\nclaim, the discriminatory purpose claim can be resolved through application of\ntwo entrenched legal principles: the deference that appellate courts owe to\nfactfinders and the Arlington Heights framework for evaluating circumstantial\nevidence of discriminatory purpose. 1 See Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S.\n273, 287 (1982); Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Develop.\nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 266–68 (1977). That deference requires that we overturn\na district court’s factual findings only if they are clearly erroneous, which\nmeans substantial evidence did not support the finding, the court\nmisinterpreted the effect of the evidence, or the findings are against the\npreponderance of credible evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6); Water Craft\n\n\n\n       1 Even with our affirmance of the discriminatory effects finding, the purpose claim\nmust still be resolved. Not only would a finding of discriminatory purpose lead to a different\nremedy with respect to the voter ID law, but it could also subject Texas to preclearance for\nfuture voting changes. 52 U.S.C. § 10302(c).\n                                            190\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 191     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nMgmt. LLC v. Mercury Marine, 457 F.3d 484, 488 (5th Cir. 2006). To reverse\nunder the clear error standard, we must have “a definite and firm conviction\nthat a mistake has been committed.” Id. (quoting Canal Barge Co. v. Torco Oil\nCo., 220 F.3d 370, 375 (5th Cir.2000)).\n       That deference is the reason it is hard to find appeals of bench trials\ninvolving private law causes of action in which we have concluded that the\nfactual findings were clearly erroneous. This year alone, we have affirmed\nsuch findings in bankruptcy, 2 maritime, 3 Fair Labor Standards Act, 4 ERISA, 5\ninsurance, 6 and oil and gas 7 cases. In none of those cases did we subject the\nevidence to exacting scrutiny or reweigh it.               That is not a dereliction of\nappellate duty. It is as it should be. So long as the “district court’s account of\nthe evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court\nof appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as\nthe trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.” U.S. Bank\nNat.

Shaw, 774 F.3d 324, 326 (5th Cir. 2014) (Prado, J.,\ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (citing Planned Parenthood of\nGreater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 769 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir. 2014)\n(Dennis, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)). This case adds to\nthe list. That is so despite the rule that “[l]egislative motivation or intent is a\nparadigmatic fact question.” 9 Prejean v. Foster, 227 F.3d 504, 509 (5th Cir.\n2000) (citing Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 549 (1999)).\n       So what are the reasons why the majority opinion, despite noting\nsignificant evidence “that could support a finding of discriminatory intent,”\nMaj. Op. at 18, does not defer to that finding? There are two: the district court\nrelied “too heavily on the evidence of State-sponsored discrimination dating\nback hundreds of years” and “on post-enactment speculation by opponents of\nSB 14.” Maj. Op. at 13, 16. As discussed below, however, virtually none of this\nevidence that the majority opinion critiques appears in the district court’s\n\n\n       8  Because these cases often have such a significant impact (the instant case involves\na law setting voting requirements for a state of more than 25 million people), it may be\nnatural to be hesitant about giving a single district judge so much discretion in deciding the\nfate of a law. Indeed, it used to be the case that lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of\na state or federal law had to be heard by three-judge panels. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2281, 2282\n(repealed 1976). For better or worse, Congress did away with that system in 1976. Act of\nAug. 12, 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-381, 90 Stat. 1119; see also 17A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT &\nARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 4235 (3d ed.) (discussing history,\npurpose, and current status of Congressionally required three-judge panels). With these\ncases now being decided by a single judge as most others are, there is no basis for altering\nthe level of deference based on the subject matter of the case.\n        9 In the context of private Title VII suits, discriminatory intent was the disputed issue\n\nin two of the leading Supreme Court cases emphasizing the deference that district courts are\nowed on questions of fact. Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574–75 (intent to discriminate on basis of\nsex); Pullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at 290 (rejecting in race discrimination case “the Fifth\nCircuit rule that a trial court’s finding on discriminatory intent is not subject to the clearly-\nerroneous standard of Rule 52(a)”).\n                                              192\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530         Page: 193   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-41127\nanalysis of the discriminatory purpose claim. See Veasey v. Perry, 71 F. Supp.\n3d 627, 698–703 (S.D. Tex. 2014).\n      With respect to the use of history, I read not only the district court’s\nopinion but also the case law differently. As legal support for the view that the\ndistrict court gave too much weight to “long-ago history,” the majority opinion\nrelies principally on Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013). Maj. Op\nat 13–14 & n.14. Shelby County held that Congress exceeded its power under\nthe Fifteenth Amendment in subjecting nine states to the “extraordinary\nmeasure[]” of having to preclear every change in voting laws. Id. at 2619. It\nfound Congress’s formula for selecting these states unconstitutional because it\nrelied on “decades-old data and eradicated practices,” in particular the use of\nliteracy tests which had long been abolished and voter registration and turnout\nnumbers that had “risen dramatically” since 1965 when the Voting Rights Act\nwas first enacted. Id. at 2627.\n      Shelby County was not a case about purposeful discrimination under the\nFourteenth Amendment or Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It makes no\nmention of Arlington Heights. For those reasons alone, Shelby County should\nnot be used to curtail the use of an Arlington Heights factor. See Rodriguez de\nQuijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent\nof this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons\nrejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the\ncase which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of\noverturning its own decisions.”).\n      But even if we did have the freedom to engage in a law review-like debate\nabout what Shelby County foretells for the use of history as circumstantial\nevidence under Arlington Heights, history is being used very differently in the\ntwo contexts. Shelby County rejected the use of 50-year-old history alone to\n                                        193\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 194     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nimpose the “stringent” requirement of preclearance.                    That preclearance\nrequirement, which applied to new laws carrying no hint of unconstitutionality\n(even ones that increased access to voting), was an exception to the normal\npractice of using “case-by-case litigation” to enforce constitutional rights. 133\nS. Ct. at 2624. In the example of case-by-case litigation here that seeks to\nestablish a current constitutional violation, Arlington Heights just says that\nhistory is one of many factors that may be considered. And it’s not just any\nhistory that courts should consider, but a historical background that “reveals\na series of official actions taken for invidious purposes.” Arlington Heights, 429\nU.S. at 267.\n       That type of pattern-or-practice evidence exists here. As the majority\nopinion recognizes, most of the discriminatory laws the district court\nrecounted—all-white Democratic primaries; literacy tests; poll taxes; and the\nannual re-registration requirement that Texas imposed after the poll tax was\nabolished—were justified with the same interest cited for voter ID: prevention\nof voter fraud. Maj. Op. at 22–23. Another thread, again recognized by the\nmajority opinion, running from prior restrictive voting laws to SB 14 is that\nthey have typically been enacted (by both political parties) in response to a\nperception of increased voting power by emerging demographic groups. 10 Maj.\nOp. 29–30 & n.30; 71 F. Supp. 3d at 700. The district court thus did not just\nsay “there was discrimination in the past, so there must be discrimination\ntoday;” it tied historical patterns to features of the law being challenged, as\nArlington Heights contemplates.\n\n\n        This historical practice is not limited to Texas or other southern states. In response\n       10\n\nto the growth of Irish immigrants who tended to favor Democrats, the Know-Nothing\nmovement led to the passage of more restrictive voting laws in Connecticut, Massachusetts,\nand New York during the 1850s. See ALEXANDER KEYSSAR, THE RIGHT TO VOTE: THE\nCONTESTED HISTORY OF DEMOCRACY IN THE UNITED STATES 68 (rev. ed. 2009).\n                                            194\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 195     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n      Despite recognizing that this connection was made with respect to both\nthe voter fraud rationale and historical practice of enacting voting restrictions\nin response to potential increases in minority voting strength, the majority\nopinion nonetheless holds that the district court relied too much on “evidence\nof State-sponsored discrimination dating back hundreds of years.” Maj. Op. at\n13. To be sure, historical evidence limited to the nineteenth century is of “little\nprobative value.”     McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 298 n.20 (1987)\n(discounting, under Arlington Heights, historical evidence focused only on\n“Georgia laws in force during and just after the Civil War” because it was not\nreasonably contemporaneous with enactment of the challenged law). But I just\ndon’t see that the district court’s finding of discriminatory purpose relied on\nsuch history at all, let alone to a significant degree.\n      The majority opinion’s contrary view seems to flow from its scrutiny of\nthe entire district court opinion for any references to evidence that may not be\nprobative of discriminatory intent. But the district court had before it not just\nthe purpose question, but claims involving discriminatory effects, impact on\nFirst Amendment interests under the Anderson/Burdick balancing test, and\nwhether the voter ID imposed a poll tax. As is customary with bench trial\nrulings, the district court first summarized the testimony and facts from the\nentire trial. Only after that discussion, which was lengthy given the vast\nrecord, did it proceed to analyze the particular claims and identify the evidence\nthat supported its legal conclusions for each.            In reviewing the factual\nsufficiency of the finding of discriminatory purpose, our review should focus on\nthe district court’s analysis of that particular claim.\n       One looking at that section of the district court’s decision after reading\ntoday’s opinions with their focus on history would be surprised that this is the\nonly mention of it:\n                                       195\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530           Page: 196       Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                         No. 14-41127\n       Historical Background. As amply demonstrated, the Texas Legislature\n       has a long history of discriminatory voting practices. To put the current\n       events into perspective, Texas was going through a seismic demographic\n       shift at the time the legislature began considering voter ID laws.\n       Hispanics and African–Americans accounted for 78.7% of Texas’s total\n       population growth between 2000 and 2010. In addition, it was during\n       this time that Texas first became a majority-minority state, with Anglos\n       no longer comprising a majority of the state’s population. As previously\n       discussed, this Court gives great weight to the findings of Dr. Lichtman\n       that ‘[t]he combination of these demographic trends and polarized voting\n       patterns . . . demonstrate that Republicans in Texas are inevitably\n       facing a declining voter base and can gain partisan advantage by\n       suppressing the overwhelmingly Democratic votes of African–\n       Americans and Latinos.’\n\n71 F. Supp. 3d at 700 (alterations in original) (footnotes omitted). The natural\nreading of this single paragraph is that the general first sentence is providing\nbackground, and it is only the demographic changes that the court is citing as\nthe Arlington Heights context for “the current events.” The majority opinion\nnot only finds no error with this latter conclusion, but endorses its relevance.\nMaj. Op. at 29–30.\n       Even if one reads the footnote at the end of the first sentence as fully\nincorporating the opening section of the opinion that chronicles “Texas’s\nhistory with respect to racial disparity in voting rights,” 11 id. at 700 n.535\n(citing id. at 633–39), I don’t see that historical overview as error. 12 Not so\nlong ago, the Supreme Court recited the same history of voting rights in Texas:\n\n\n       11  Because the opening sentence of the paragraph just refers to the Texas Legislature’s\nhistory of enacting discriminatory voting laws, there is no plausible reading that would allow\nit to incorporate prior summaries of testimony in the opinion that involve the discriminatory\nvoting acts of a single county (Waller County), another item the majority opinion criticizes.\n        12 The only parts of that section that refer to events “dating back hundreds of years”\n\nare a benign introductory statement that “On the heels of Reconstruction, freed slaves and\nother minority men were just gaining access to the right to vote,” and headings for topics\nlike the poll tax and literacy tests that, owing to the duty of historical accuracy, list the entire\nperiod they were in existence (“1905–1970: Literacy and ‘Secret Ballot’ Restrictions”; “1902–\n1966: Poll Taxes”). 71 F. Supp. 3d at 634.\n                                               196\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530        Page: 197    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\n      Texas has a long, well-documented history of discrimination that has\n      touched upon the rights of African–Americans and Hispanics to register,\n      to vote, or to participate otherwise in the electoral process. Devices such\n      as the poll tax, an all-white primary system, and restrictive voter\n      registration time periods are an unfortunate part of this State’s minority\n      voting rights history. The history of official discrimination in the Texas\n      election process—stretching back to Reconstruction—led to the\n      inclusion of the State as a covered jurisdiction under Section 5 in the\n      1975 amendments to the Voting Rights Act. Since Texas became a\n      covered jurisdiction, the Department of Justice has frequently\n      interposed objections against the State and its subdivisions.\n\nLULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 439–40 (2006) (quoting Vera v. Richards, 861\nF. Supp. 1304, 1317 (S.D. Tex. 1994)). Deeming a similar discussion here to be\nlegal error risks making rhetoric a basis for reversal. The natural starting\npoint of any historical discussion is the beginning.           Maj. Op. at 14 n.14\n(recognizing that “history (even ‘long-ago history’) provides context to modern-\nday events”). And the bigger problem of locating error in sections of the district\ncourt’s opinion that do not even analyze the claim at issue is that it results in\nthe fact finding of judges being much more susceptible to reversal than those\nof juries, which do not have to summarize the evidence or provide reasons for\ntheir decisions.\n      This improper focus on the district court’s summary of the evidence\nrather than its later analysis of the discriminatory purpose claim is just as\npronounced when it comes to the statements of bill opponents with which the\nmajority opinion also finds fault. Maj. Op. at 16–17. Those comments appear\nnowhere in the one-paragraph discussion of “Contemporaneous Statements,”\n71 F. Supp. 3d at 702, or anywhere else in the discriminatory purpose analysis.\nInstead, they appear in a section recounting testimony (from both sides) about\nthe “Method and Result of Passing SB 14.” Id. at 655–57. The discussion of\n“Contemporaneous Statements” that does appear in the purpose analysis is\n\n                                         197\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 198   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nbalanced, noting that “there are no ‘smoking guns’ in the form of an SB 14\nsponsor making an anti-African-American or anti-Hispanic statement.” Id. at\n702. The only legislator quoted is not an opponent, but bill supporter Todd\nSmith who admitted it was “common sense” that voter ID would have\ndisproportionate effects on racial minorities. Id. The majority opinion cites\nthat testimony as relevant evidence for the purpose claim. Maj. Op. at 22.\nThat leaves only the district court’s conclusion that the 2011 legislative session\nwas racially charged in light of other pending legislation, id. at 702, which\nseems like an inference a factfinder should be entitled to draw.\n      But even if not, with that factual finding being the only one specifically\nmentioned in the district court’s discussion of discriminatory purpose with\nwhich the majority opinion finds fault, it does not seem like a sufficient basis\nfor reaching “a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed”\nas to the ultimate finding. Canal Barge Co. Inc., 220 F.3d at 375. That is\nespecially so when the majority opinion endorses the district court’s reliance\non just about all the other evidence it actually did cite in assessing the\nArlington Heights factors. See Maj. Op. at 21–30. In light of that discussion\nand the district court opinion, there is no value in repeating that evidence here.\nThe only thing to add is that the district court correctly recognized that the\ndiscriminatory impact of the law (for which the majority opinion finds\nsufficient evidentiary support on the “effects” claim and which even Judge\nJones’s dissent does not dispute, see Jones Dissent at 5) can also be considered\nin evaluating discriminatory purpose. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266\n(noting that “[t]he impact of the official action whether it ‘bears more heavily\non one race than another,’ may provide an important starting point” in the\n“sensitive inquiry into [ ] circumstantial and direct evidence of intent”) (quoting\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976)); Jim Sowell Const. Co. v. City\n                                       198\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 199     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nof Coppell, 61 F. Supp. 2d 542, 547 (N.D. Tex. 1999) (citing Arlington Heights\nfor the proposition that “circumstantial evidence regarding the impact of its\nofficial actions” can be evidence of discriminatory purpose). Yet the majority\nopinion does not list discriminatory impact as a consideration in the purpose\ninquiry, Maj. Op. at 11–12, despite recognizing that those likely effects were\nknown prior to enactment, which would seem to make the discriminatory\nimpact an even more probative consideration in determining purpose. I would\ntherefore conclude that there was sufficient evidence from which the district\ncourt could have reasonably concluded that the law was enacted with a\ndiscriminatory purpose, even if, as is usually the case in hotly contested trials,\nthere is also evidence to support the opposite view.\n       Vacating the finding of discriminatory purpose not only is at odds with\nthe deference owed the factfinder, but also causes delay in the ultimate\nresolution of this case that could impose significant costs. Voter ID was passed\nfive years ago. Litigation concerning its lawfulness has been ongoing for more\nthan four years. 13 Even more concerning than mere delay, however, is the\npossibility of Texas elections being conducted under ever-changing rules. Since\nSB 14’s enactment, elections have been conducted under its terms.                       The\nupcoming November 2016 is now likely to be conducted under a remedy for the\neffects violation that limits the discriminatory impact of the law but that leaves\nsome of it in place. Depending on how the discriminatory purpose claim is\ndecided on remand, the next cycle of elections might be conducted with a voided\nSB 14 playing no role. Such frequent changes in the voting rules carry a\n\n\n\n       13The preclearance regime was still in effect when the law was enacted. DOJ denied\npreclearance, but in 2012 Texas sought a judicial determination of that question by a three-\njudge panel. See Texas v. Holder, 888 F. Supp. 2d 113 (D.D.C. 2012), vacated, 133 S. Ct. 2886\n(2013). After Shelby County, the lawsuits we are considering were filed in 2013.\n                                            199\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 200     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nsubstantial risk of increased confusion. It is that uncertainty over voting\nrequirements that some studies—including a recent joint study from Rice\nUniversity’s Baker Institute for Public Policy and the University of Houston’s\nHobby Center for Public Policy—have found to be one of the more significant\nways in which voter ID laws depress turnout. See MARK JONES, ET. AL., THE\nTEXAS VOTER ID LAW AND THE 2014 ELECTION: A STUDY OF TEXAS’S 23RD\nCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 13 (2015) (noting that its study of voter turnout\nunder SB 14 “suggest[s] that the most significant impact of the current Texas\nvoter ID law is confusion and subsequently depressed voter turnout”).\n\n\n                                           * * *\n       Reluctance to hold that a legislature passed a law with a discriminatory\npurpose is understandable.

When we find that they have done so, it\ndoesn’t exactly cast those lawmakers in the best of light.\n       It is also important to note that affirming the finding of discriminatory\npurpose 14 would not be the inflammatory “racial name-calling” that Judge\nJones’s dissent suggests. Jones Dissent at 1. Such a finding, although one of\ngrave importance, is not tantamount to a finding that the law had a “racist\n\n\n       14 It’s also worth again emphasizing that unlike the findings of constitutional\nviolations we usually make in cases that present purely legal questions, affirming the district\ncourt here would not be a direct ruling from this court that the law was passed with a\ndiscriminatory purpose, only that there was evidence from which a factfinder could draw that\nconclusion.\n                                             200\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 201     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nmotivation.” Id. at 3; Elrod Dissent at 1 (characterizing question as whether\n“the Legislature acted on the basis of racism”); see also Maj. Op. at 12–13 (also\nindicating that such a finding requires a showing of “racism”). As Judge\nKozinski explained in a decision upholding a district court determination that\na discriminatory purpose motivated a Los Angeles county reapportionment\nplan, nothing in an opinion finding discriminatory purpose needs to even\n“suggest[]” that lawmakers “harbored any ethnic or racial animus.” Garza v.\nCnty. of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 778 (9th Cir. 1990) (Kozinski, J.,\nconcurring) (explaining that “there is no indication that what the district court\nfound to be intentional discrimination was based on any dislike, mistrust,\nhatred or bigotry against Hispanics or any other minority group”). 15 The\n\n\n       15 Judge Jones’s dissent states that Garza is one of only a handful of cases in recent\ndecades finding that a law was enacted with a discriminatory purpose. Jones Dissent at 10\nn.11. Notably, it was a voting rights case from a jurisdiction not covered by the Voting Rights\nAct’s preclearance requirements. See also Stabler v. Cnty. of Thurston, Neb., 129 F.3d 1015,\n1022 (8th Cir. 1997) (finding intentional discrimination in redistricting plan of non-covered\nNebraska county). For the nine covered states (a number of counties from other states were\nalso subject to preclearance), there was little incentive for a challenger to bring a claim of\npurposeful discrimination prior to Shelby County. One of the requirements for preclearance\nwas for the public entity enacting the change to disprove that the voting change had a\ndiscriminatory purpose or effects. Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 477–78\n(1997) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1973c). The impact that making the typically easier-to-prove effects\ntest an equally powerful avenue of relief has on purpose claims can be seen from the drop in\nthe number of discriminatory purpose claims brought in voting cases after the 1982\namendments to the Voting Rights Act made effects a basis for section 2 liability in response\nto City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55 (1980) (interpreting prior version of section 2 to\nrequire finding of discriminatory purpose). In cases litigated on the eve of the 1982\namendments, three courts of appeals (including ours) had found discriminatory purpose in\nthe enactment or maintenance of local electoral systems. See Lodge v. Buxton, 639 F.2d 1358,\n1380 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), aff’d sub nom. Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613 (1982); N.A.A.C.P.\nby Campbell v. Gadsden Cnty. Sch. Bd., 691 F.2d 978, 982 (11th Cir. 1982); Perkins v. City of\nW. Helena, Ark., 675 F.2d 201, 216 (8th Cir. 1982), aff’d sub nom. City of W. Helena, Ark. v.\nPerkins, 459 U.S. 801 (1982) (all finding that at-large electoral system was created or\nmaintained for discriminatory purpose).\n       Outside the voting context where effects became challengers’ preferred claim, there\nare more examples of courts finding discriminatory purpose, mostly in the area of school\ndesegregation and housing. See, e.g., United States v. City of Yonkers, 96 F.3d 600, 618–19\n                                             201\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 202     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\ndiscriminatory purpose can instead be the product of “elected officials\nengag[ing] in the single-minded pursuit of incumbency.”                    Id.; Ketchum v.\nByrne, 740 F.2d 1398, 1408 (7th Cir. 1984) (observing that “many devices\nemployed to preserve incumbencies are necessarily racially discriminatory”).\nThat most basic of human instincts—self-preservation—can thus provide an\nexplanation for enacting a law at least in part because it will have a disparate\nimpact on protected groups that favor the out-of-power party. 71 F. Supp. 3d\nat 700; see also Frank v. Walker, 773 F.3d 783, 790–93 (7th Cir. 2014) (Posner,\nJ., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (discussing studies and other\nevidence supporting the view that voter ID laws, although not resulting in\n“huge” decreases in turnout, have an effect primarily on “low-income and\nminority groups” that favor Democrats). Indeed, the highly polarized nature\nof voting in Texas along racial lines (according to exit polls from the last\ngubernatorial election, 72% of whites, 44% percent of Latinos, and 7% of\nAfrican-Americans voted for the Republican winner 16) makes depressing\nminority turnout a strong proxy for suppressing Democratic turnout.\n       A judge who agrees with Judge Jones’s dissent that “partisanship, not\nrace,” is a likely reason why the Texas Legislature enacted SB 14 can thus still\nconclude that the law was enacted with a discriminatory purpose.

If that desire for partisan advantage\n(or any other underlying motivation) leads a legislature to select a “course of\naction at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects\nupon an identifiable group,” 17 that is enough. See Garza, 918 F.2d at 778\n(Kozinski, J., concurring).         This different starting point for assessing the\ndiscriminatory purpose claim—that is, a mistaken premise that the record has\nto support a finding of outright racism—perhaps explains why today’s opinions\ntake such widely divergent views of the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n      17   Pers.

Background\nA. Senate Bill 14\n       Prior to the implementation of SB 14, a Texas voter could cast a ballot in\nperson by presenting a registration certificate—a document mailed to voters\nupon registration. TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 13.142, 63.001(b) (West 2010). Voters\nappearing without the certificate could cast a ballot by signing an affidavit and\npresenting one of multiple forms of identification (“ID”), including a current or\nexpired driver’s license, a photo ID (including employee or student IDs), a\nutility bill, a bank statement, a paycheck, a government document showing the\nvoter’s name and address, or mail addressed to the voter from a government\nagency. Id. §§ 63.001, 63.0101 (West 2010).\n       With the implementation of SB 14, Texas began requiring voters to\npresent certain specific forms of identification at the polls. These include: (1) a\nTexas driver’s license or personal identification card issued by the Department\nof Public Safety (“DPS”) that has not been expired for more than 60 days; (2) a\nU.S. military identification card with a photograph that has not been expired\nfor more than 60 days; (3) a U.S. citizenship certificate with a photo; (4) a U.S.\npassport that has not been expired for more than 60 days; (5) a license to carry\na concealed handgun issued by DPS that has not been expired for more than\n60 days; or (6) an Election Identification Certificate (“EIC”) issued by DPS that\nhas not been expired for more than 60 days. 2 TEX. ELEC. CODE § 63.0101 (West\nSupp. 2014). 3\n\n\n       2   We refer to these required forms of identification under SB 14 as “SB 14 ID.”\n       3  SB 14 also requires the name on the photo ID to be “substantially similar” to the\nvoter’s registered name. TEX. ELEC. CODE § 63.001(c) (West Supp. 2014). If the names are\nnot identical but are substantially similar, the voter must sign an affidavit that the voter and\nthe registered voter are one and the same. Id. If the names are not substantially similar,\nthe voter may submit a provisional ballot and within six days must go to the county registrar\n                                               4\n\f     Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530           Page: 5     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       SB 14 states that DPS “may not collect a fee for an [EIC] or a duplicate\n[EIC],” TEX. TRANSP. CODE § 521A.001(b) (West 2013), and allows DPS to\npromulgate rules for obtaining an EIC, id. § 521A.001(f); § 521.142. To receive\nan EIC, DPS rules require a registered voter to present either: (A) one form of\nprimary ID, (B) two forms of secondary ID, or (C) one form of secondary ID and\ntwo pieces of supporting identification. 37 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 15.182(1).\nThus, any application for an EIC requires either one Texas driver’s license or\npersonal identification card that has been expired for less than two years, or\none of the following documents, accompanied by two forms of supporting\nidentification: (1) an original or certified copy of a birth certificate from the\nappropriate state agency; (2) an original or certified copy of a United States\nDepartment of State Certification of Birth for a U.S. citizen born abroad;\n(3) U.S. citizenship or naturalization papers without a photo; or (4) an original\nor certified copy of a court order containing the person’s name and date of birth\nand indicating an official change of name and/or gender. Id. § 15.182(3). 4\n       Before May 27, 2015, a statutory provision distinct from SB 14 imposed\na $2 or $3 fee for a certified copy of a birth certificate. 5 TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY\n\n\n\nwith additional ID to verify his or her identity. Id. §§ 63.001(g), 63.011, 65.0541(a) (West\nSupp. 2014).\n       4  Among the forms of supporting identification are: voter registration cards, school\nrecords, insurance policies that are at least two years old, identification cards or driver’s\nlicenses issued by another state that have not been expired for more than two years, Texas\nvehicle or boat titles or registrations, military records, Social Security cards, W-2 forms,\nexpired Texas driver’s licenses, government agency ID cards, unexpired military dependent\nidentification cards, Texas or federal parole or mandatory release forms, federal inmate ID\ncards, Medicare or Medicaid cards, immunization records, tribal membership cards from\nfederally recognized tribes, and Veteran’s Administration cards. 37 TEX. ADMIN. CODE\n§ 15.182(4).\n       5  The Department of State Health Services (“DSHS”) waived most of the fees for\nobtaining a birth certificate to get an EIC, but this provision separately required the Bureau\nof Vital Statistics, local registrars, and county clerks to collect a $2 fee for the issuance of a\n                                                5\n\f     Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 6      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nCODE § 191.0045 (West 2010). As discussed below, after the district court\nissued its judgment and the panel conducted oral argument in this case, the\nTexas Legislature passed Senate Bill 983 during the 2015 legislative session\nand eliminated this fee.\n       Persons who have a disability are exempt from SB 14’s photo ID\nrequirement if they are able to provide the voter registrar with documentation\nof their disability from the U.S. Social Security Administration or Department\nof Veterans Affairs. TEX. ELEC. CODE § 13.002(i) (West Supp. 2014). Other\npersons may vote by provisional ballot without a photo ID if they file affidavits\neither asserting a religious objection to being photographed or asserting that\ntheir SB 14 ID was lost or destroyed as a result of a natural disaster occurring\nwithin 45 days of casting a ballot. Id. § 65.054. Additionally, voters who will\nbe 65 or older as of the date of the election may vote early by mail. Id. § 82.003.\n       If a voter is unable to provide SB 14 ID at the poll, the voter can cast a\nprovisional ballot after executing an affidavit stating that the voter is\nregistered and eligible to vote. Id. § 63.001(a), (g). The vote counts if the voter\nproduces SB 14 ID to the county registrar within six days of the election. Id.\n§ 65.0541.\n       SB 14 requires county registrars to inform applicants of the new voter\nID requirements when issuing voter registration certificates, id. § 15.005, and\nrequires both the Secretary of State and voter registrar of each county with a\nwebsite to post SB 14’s requirements online.                     Id.     § 31.012(a).       The\nrequirements must also be placed prominently at polling places. Id. § 62.016.\nAdditionally, the Secretary of State must “conduct a statewide effort to educate\n\n\n\ncertified copy of a birth certificate, and permitted local registrars and county clerks to impose\nan additional $1 fee. TEX.

For instance, the\nLegislature was advised of the likely discriminatory impact by the Deputy\nGeneral Counsel to the Lieutenant Governor and by many legislators, and such\nimpact was acknowledged to be “common sense” by one of the chief proponents\nof the legislation. 21 See Veasey v.

For\nexample, the record shows that Texas has a history of justifying voter\nsuppression efforts such as the poll tax and literacy tests with the race-neutral\nreason of promoting ballot integrity. See id. at 636 & n.24. Dr. Vernon Burton,\nan expert in race relations, testified about the “history of official discrimination\nin Texas voting.” He identified some devices Texas has used to deny minorities\nthe vote, including “the all[-]White primary, the secret ballot and the use of\nilliteracy[,] . . . poll tax, re-registration and purging.” He testified as follows\nregarding “the stated rationale” for each of these devices:\n            Q     What, in your opinion, was the stated rationale for the\n            enactment of all[-]White primaries in Texas?\n            A     The stated rationale was voter fraud.\n            Q     What was the stated rationale, in your opinion, for the\n            use of secret ballot provisions in Texas?\n            A     The stated rationale was to prevent voter fraud.\n            Q     And what was the stated rationale, in your opinion, for\n            the use of the poll tax in Texas?\n            A     The stated rationale by the State was to prevent voter\n            fraud.\n            Q     And how about the stated rationale for the use in\n            Texas of re-registration requirements and voter purges?\n            A     The stated rationale was voter fraud.\n                                        24\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 25   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\n           Q     Dr. Burton, in your expert opinion, did these devices\n           actually respond to sincere concerns or incidents –\n           incidences of voter fraud?\n           A     No.\n      Here, too, there is evidence that could support a finding that the\nLegislature’s race-neutral reason of ballot integrity offered by the State is\npretextual.    This bill was subjected to radical departures from normal\nprocedures.    Consideration of procedural departures is a difficult inquiry,\nbecause on the one hand, “[d]epartures from the normal procedural\nsequence . . . might afford evidence that improper purposes are playing a role.”\nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267. On the other hand, “objection[s] to typical\naspects of the legislative process in developing legislation,” such as increasing\nthe number of votes a law requires for passage, may not demonstrate an\ninvidious intent, standing alone. Cf. Operation Push, 932 F.2d at 408–09, 408\nn.6. Yet, context matters, and evidence of procedural departures provides one\npotential link in the circumstantial totality of evidence the district court must\nconsider.\n      In this case, for example, the procedural maneuvers employed by the\nTexas Legislature and the State occurred, as the district court notes, only after\nrepeated attempts to pass voter identification bills were blocked through\ncountervailing procedural maneuvers.

At the same time, SB 14 was subject to numerous and radical\nprocedural departures that may lend credence to an inference of discriminatory\nintent. See id. at 647–51. These included: (1) getting special permission to file\nthe bill under a low number reserved for the Lieutenant Governor’s legislative\npriorities; (2) Governor Perry’s decision to designate the bill as emergency\nlegislation so that it could be considered during the first sixty days of the\nlegislative session; (3) suspending the two-thirds rule regarding the number of\n                                       25\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530        Page: 26     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nvotes required to make SB 14 a “special order”; (4) allowing the bill to bypass\nthe ordinary committee process in the Texas House and Senate; (5) passing SB\n14 with an unverified $2 million fiscal note despite the prohibition on doing so\nin the 2011 legislative session due to a $27 million budget shortfall; (6) cutting\ndebate short to enable a three-day passage through the Senate; and (7) passing\nresolutions to allow the conference committee to add provisions to SB 14,\ncontrary to the Legislature’s rules and normal practice. See id. at 647–53.\nSuch treatment was virtually unprecedented. 22\n       Texas is a huge state in land mass and population and the Legislature\nfaces great challenges in governing. The Texas Legislature meets for regular\nsessions for less than five months out of every two years. TEX. CONST. art. III,\n§ 24; TEX. GOV’T CODE § 301.001 (West 2013). 23 During the session, it must\npass a balanced budget that will govern until the next session, based on\nprojected revenue for the next two years. TEX. CONST. art. VIII, § 22; id. art.\nIII, § 49a. In recent years, the Legislature has faced many complex and\ncontroversial issues. The district court noted that the 2011 legislative session\nitself involved “critically important issues such as the $27 million budget\n\n\n\n       22  One of the dissenting opinions calls into question the rationale behind these\nmaneuvers and draws different interpretations and inferences from the evidence. However,\nit is the exclusive province of the district court to engage in this fact finding. Pullman-\nStandard, 456 U.S. at 291–92. We acknowledge that multiple inferences could reasonably\nbe drawn from the record evidence, but we must leave the drawing of those inferences to the\ndistrict court. Additionally, one of the dissenting opinions disagrees with reliance on\nopposing legislators’ factual testimony about the unusual nature of the procedural\nmaneuvers utilized to pass SB 14. There is a clear difference between opposing legislators\ntestifying about their personal knowledge regarding the normal procedural sequence of\npassing legislation and opposing legislators merely speculating about the motives of SB 14’s\nproponents.\n       23The Texas Governor also has the power to call special sessions of the Legislature,\nwhich are topically limited to the confines of the proclamation summoning the Legislature.\nTEX.

Yet, one\nmight expect that when the Legislature places a bill on an expedited schedule\nand subjects it to such an extraordinary degree of procedural irregularities, as\nwas the case with SB 14, such a bill would address a problem of great\nmagnitude. Ballot integrity is undoubtedly a worthy goal. But the evidence\nbefore the Legislature was that in-person voting, the only concern addressed\nby SB 14, yielded only two convictions for in-person voter impersonation fraud\nout of 20 million votes cast in the decade leading up to SB 14’s passage. 24 See\nid. at 639. The bill did nothing to combat mail-in ballot fraud, although record\nevidence shows that the potential and reality of fraud is much greater in the\nmail-in ballot context than with in-person voting. 25 Id. at 641, 653.\n       In the context of the many pressing matters of great importance to Texas\nthat did not result in these legislative irregularities, we cannot say that the\nrecord leads to only one factual conclusion in this case.

While cloaking themselves in the mantle of\nfollowing Indiana’s voter ID law, which had been upheld against a (different)\nchallenge in Crawford, the proponents of SB 14 took out all the ameliorative\nprovisions of the Indiana law.

For\n\n\n       26   One of the dissenting opinions claims that “the Indiana and Texas laws are not\nmeaningfully different.” Jones Dissenting Op. at 28 n.26. This ignores the district court’s\nfindings and the obvious differences between the two laws that affect the discriminatory\nimpact analysis. The district court explained the differences well:\n        Notably, while Defendants claim that SB 14 was modeled after the Indiana\n        law, the Indiana law is more generous to voters. Unlike SB 14, it permits the\n        use of any Indiana state-issued or federal ID and contains a nursing home\n        resident exemption. Furthermore, Indiana is more generous in its acceptance\n        of certain expired ID. Of particular relevance here, Indiana’s accommodation\n        of indigents, while requiring an additional trip to the county election office to\n        claim an exemption, does not require an indigent to actually obtain, or pay any\n        fees associated with, a qualified photo ID. This is significant, as demonstrated\n        in this case. There was also a reference in Crawford to a “greater public\n        awareness” of the law, which would prompt voters to secure qualified ID, as\n        opposed to a relative dearth of publicity and instruction in Texas.\nVeasey v.

One of those rationales included\npreventing noncitizens from voting, even though two forms of identification\n\n\n       29 One of the dissenting opinions quarrels with the district court’s findings on this\nissue, but a three-judge panel reviewing Texas’s 1981 redistricting plan reached the same\nconclusion:\n              In 1975, Congress extended the special pre-clearance provisions\n              of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to Texas. This decision was\n              made on the basis of extensive hearings into the history of voting\n              discrimination in the state. Since the pre-clearance provisions\n              were extended to Texas in August of 1975, the Department of\n              Justice has lodged far more objections to governmental actions\n              affecting voting rights in Texas than any other covered state.\n              Between August 15, 1975, and September 18, 1981, the State\n              and its various political sub-divisions received 91 letters of\n              objection. In this same period, no other covered state had more\n              than 50 objections, and only three had more than thirty. The\n              election changes objected to by the Department of Justice\n              include the movement of polling places, proposed annexations,\n              alteration of district lines, and a state-wide purge of voter\n              registration lists.\nSeamon v.

It is likewise relevant that SB 14’s proponents refused to answer\nwhy they would not allow amendments to ameliorate the expected disparate\nimpact of SB 14. Id. at 646–47, 650–51.\n       Further supporting the district court’s finding is the fact that the\nextraordinary measures accompanying the passage of SB 14 occurred in the\nwake of a “seismic demographic shift,” as minority populations rapidly\nincreased in Texas, such that the district court found that the party currently\nin power is “facing a declining voter base and can gain partisan advantage”\nthrough a strict voter ID law. 30 Id. at 700.\n       In sum, although some of the evidence on which the district court relied\nwas infirm, there remains evidence to support a finding that the cloak of ballot\nintegrity could be hiding a more invidious purpose. As we have explained, the\n\n\n\n       30   This partisan motive to suppress votes is not based on which party is in the\nmajority. When asked about the fact that most redistricting and discriminatory laws were\nenacted under legislatures with a majority who were members of a different party than the\ncurrent majority, the Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Burton, agreed. He testified that this fact made\nhis analysis “stronger because it does not matter who is in charge of State politics or the\npolitical parties in power in Texas, whether they’re Republicans, Democrats[,] or Martians,\nevery time that African–Americans have, in fact, been perceived to be increasing their ability\nto vote and participate in the process there has been State legislation to either deny them the\nvote or at least dilute the vote or make it much more difficult for them to participate on an\nequal basis as Whites in the State of Texas.”\n        One of the dissenting opinions claims that we confuse partisanship for racism in our\nanalysis of whether the Legislature acted with a discriminatory intent. Intentions to achieve\npartisan gain and to racially discriminate are not mutually exclusive. As another of the\ndissenting opinions points out, acting to preserve legislative power in a partisan manner can\nalso be impermissibly discriminatory. Ketchum v.

Once again, the disagreement centers in part on the fact that\nsome of the dissenting opinions would re-weigh the evidence and disregard the district court’s\nfact findings, which we are not entitled to do. See Pullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at 292.\n                                             31\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 32      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nabsence of direct evidence such as a “let’s discriminate” email cannot be and is\nnot dispositive. Because we do not know how much the evidence found infirm\nweighed in the district court’s calculus, we cannot simply affirm the decision.\nHowever, it is not an appellate court’s place to weigh evidence. See Price, 945\nF.2d at 1317 (“[T]he appellate court may not substitute its judgment for the\ndistrict court’s.”). Thus, since there is more than one way to decide this case,\nand the right court to make those findings is the district court, we must\nremand. 31\n       We therefore remand this claim to the district court to “reexamin[e] . . .\nthe probative evidence underlying Plaintiffs’ discriminatory purpose claims\nweighed against the contrary evidence, in accord with” the appropriate legal\nstandards we have described. Veasey, 796 F.3d at 503–04; cf. City of Richmond\n\n\n       31   Two of the dissenting opinions take issue with our decision on discriminatory\nintent, in part because this issue can be fraught and divisive. One of the dissenting opinions\nclaims that Congress intended to prevent such divisiveness by ensuring that plaintiffs could\nsue for discriminatory impact. Congress amended the Voting Rights Act in 1982 to make it\nclear that plaintiffs could sue for discriminatory impact after Supreme Court precedent had\nrequired the showing of a discriminatory purpose under Section 2. See S. Rep. No. 97-417,\nat 15–16 (1982), as reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 192–93. Congress acted in the face\nof this precedent to make it easier for minority plaintiffs to combat discriminatory laws—not\nto make it more difficult. Congress did not eliminate plaintiffs’ ability to sue for purposeful\ndiscrimination, so it remains our duty to consider these claims. See S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 17\n(1982), as reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 194 & n.50 (emphasis in original) (citation\nomitted) (noting that Section 2 was originally understood by Congress to prohibit “any kind\nof practice . . . if its purpose or effect was to deny or abridge the right to vote on account of\nrace or color”). In this case, although we must tread carefully in assessing the motives of the\nLegislature and the district court may very well agree with some of the points made by the\ndissenting opinions, we must be mindful of our role in this process. We are not the court to\nmake factual findings in the first instance, and the record evidence could support more than\none conclusion. We must therefore remand for reweighing of the evidence, rather than\nconducting that reweighing ourselves. See Pullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at 291 (“When an\nappellate court discerns that a district court has failed to make a finding because of an\nerroneous view of the law . . . there should be a remand for further proceedings to permit the\ntrial court to make the missing findings . . . .” (emphasis added)); N.

The\ndistrict court may, but is not required to, entertain additional oral argument\nprior to issuing its new findings.

The Supreme Court has, in effect, set a July 20\ndeadline for this court to act, after which it will entertain motions for relief.\nVeasey v. Abbott, 136 S. Ct. at 1823. Time is also needed to communicate those\nmodifications to the wider public so as not to disrupt the election process.\nIndeed, among the findings made by the district court was that the public\neducation campaign for SB 14 at the time of trial was “grossly insufficient.”\nVeasey v.

Equally necessary in the time left before\nearly voting begins in late October is an adequate campaign to explain not only\nSB 14 but also court-ordered amendments to voter identification rules. We are\nmindful that future litigation and appeals to this court are also distinct\npossibilities.\n      Additionally, we recognize the burden our majority opinion places on the\ndistrict court to implement a remedy for the discriminatory effect violation\nwith so little time, see infra Part II.B. Therefore, to avoid disruption of the\nupcoming election, we rely on equitable principles in concluding that the\ndistrict court should first focus on fashioning interim relief for the\ndiscriminatory effect violation in the months leading up to the November 2016\ngeneral election.

See Perry v. Perez, 132 S.\nCt. 934, 940–41 (2012) (per curiam).\n      We instruct the district court to take the requisite time to reevaluate the\nevidence and determine anew whether the Legislature acted with a\ndiscriminatory intent in enacting SB 14. But it is unnecessary for the district\ncourt to undertake this task until after the November 2016 election. See\nPurcell v. Gonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145774\"><a href=\"/opinion/145774/purcell-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5–6 (2006) (election permitted to continue\ndespite unresolved issues related to disenfranchisement); see also Reynolds v.\nSims, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106850\"><a href=\"/opinion/106850/reynolds-v-sims/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 585 (1964) (noting that a court may withhold immediate\nrelief so as not to disturb a forthcoming election).

Discriminatory Effect\n      Plaintiffs allege that SB 14 has a discriminatory effect in violation of\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which proscribes any “voting qualification\nor prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure . . . which results\nin a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen . . . to vote on account of\nrace or color.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a).

XV.\n      1. The Gingles Factors and Two-Part Framework\n      To prove that a law has a discriminatory effect under Section 2, Plaintiffs\nmust show not only that the challenged law imposes a burden on minorities,\nbut also that “a certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social\nand historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by\nblack and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.” Gingles, 478\nU.S. at 47 (emphasis added). While courts regularly utilize statistical analyses\nto discern whether a law has a discriminatory impact, see, e.g., Operation Push,\n\n\n\n       (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or\n       procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in\n       a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen\n       of the United States to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of\n       the guarantees set forth in section 10303(f)(2) of this title, as provided in\n       subsection (b).\n       (b) A violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the totality of\n       circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or\n       election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to\n       participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) in\n       that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate\n       to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their\n       choice. The extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to\n       office in the State or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be\n       considered: Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a right to have\n       members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in\n       the population.\n52 U.S.C. § 10301.

Two additional considerations are:\n        [8.] whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the\n        part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the members\n        of the minority group[; and]\n        [9.] whether the policy underlying the state or political\n        subdivision’s use of such voting qualification, prerequisite to\n        voting, or standard, practice or procedure is tenuous.\nId.\n        These factors are not exclusive, and “there is no requirement that any\nparticular number of factors be proved, or that a majority of them point one\nway or the other.” Id. at 45 (quoting S.

We disagree that the Gingles\nfactors are inapposite here, and we have good reasons to believe that the\nState’s gloomy forecast is unsound.\n\n\n                                        39\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 40      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       Use of the two-factor test and the Gingles factors limits Section 2\nchallenges to those that properly link the effects of past and current\ndiscrimination with the racially disparate effects of the challenged law.\nApplying the Gingles factors involves engaging in a multi-factor analysis,\nunder which no one factor has determinative weight.

Just because a test is fact driven and multi-\nfactored does not make it dangerously limitless in application.\n       The State argues that we should instead adopt a bright-line test as our\nlimiting principle.      As the State would have it, so long as the State can\narticulate a legitimate justification for its election law and some voters are able\nto meet the requirements, there is no Section 2 violation. This argument\neffectively nullifies the protections of the Voting Rights Act by giving states a\nfree pass to enact needlessly burdensome laws with impermissible racially\ndiscriminatory impacts. The Voting Rights Act was enacted to prevent just\nsuch invidious, subtle forms of discrimination. See Chisom v.

See, e.g., Lee v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, ___ F.

Such has also been the case with the variances in decisions among the circuit\ncourts to consider challenges to voter ID laws—our decision differs from those of other circuits\nin part because we are considering “the [s]trictest [l]aw in the [c]ountry” in a State with a\nfairly extensive history of official discrimination.

See Jones\nDissenting Op. at 52. Undoubtedly, challenges to election laws under Section 2 have\nincreased since Shelby County as states have enacted new laws and regulations that must be\nchallenged under Section 2, if at all, because these laws no longer face preclearance. That\ndoes not mean that our analysis endangers neutral, nondiscriminatory election laws. As we\nexplain infra, district courts considering these challenges have come to different conclusions\nbased on varying fact patterns and election laws, not always with the result of striking down\nelection laws. Indeed, the United States abandoned its Section 2 discriminatory-effect\nchallenge to a voter ID law after the North Carolina legislature added a reasonable\nimpediment exception to the law. See N.C. State Conference of the NAACP v. McCrory, ___\nF.

The Seventh Circuit applied the two-part\nframework only “[f]or the sake of argument,” did not apply the Gingles factors,\nand expressed skepticism about the second step of the two-part analysis\n“because it does not distinguish discrimination by the [government] defendants\nfrom other persons’ discrimination.” Frank, 768 F.3d at 754–55. The Seventh\nCircuit ultimately did not apply the second step of the two-part analysis\nbecause it concluded that the plaintiffs failed to show that Wisconsin’s law\nimposed a discriminatory burden that gave minority voters less opportunity to\nparticipate in the political process at the first step of the analysis. Id. at 753,\n755. Our record contains more particularized evidence of the discriminatory\nburden imposed by SB 14 than did the record in Frank. 38\n        To the extent that the State argues causality may be established only\nwhere there is a finding that state action caused the social and historical\nconditions begetting discrimination, see Frank, 768 F.3d at 755, we need not\nand do not decide that issue. Unlike in Frank, the district court in this case\nfound both historical and contemporary examples of discrimination in both\nemployment and education by the State of Texas, and it attributed SB 14’s\ndisparate impact, in part, to the lasting effects of that State-sponsored\ndiscrimination. See Veasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Thus, even\nassuming this limitation from Frank applied, the evidence here meets that\ntest.\n\n\n\n\n        38  Furthermore, Wisconsin’s law, considered in Frank, allows for more forms of\nidentification than does SB 14. The district court found SB 14 to be the “[s]trictest [l]aw in\nthe [c]ountry” based on comparisons to other states’ voter ID laws and on the characterization\nof SB 14 by one of its drafters.

Nevertheless, the State argues that Frank drew on\nCrawford to conclude Wisconsin’s law did not impose a discriminatory burden\non voters because it appeared to be a generally-applicable election law.\n       Crawford clearly established that states have strong interests in\npreventing voter fraud and increasing voter confidence by safeguarding the\nintegrity of elections. 553 U.S. at 191, 194–97. We do not deny that the State\nin this case may pursue those interests, nor that they are strong and valid\ninterests. However, that acknowledgement does not address the additional as-\n\n\n       39   One of the dissenting opinions relies heavily on Crawford in discussing both\ndiscriminatory purpose and impact, essentially using Crawford’s endorsement of “preventing\nvoter fraud” as a talisman against objections that SB 14 does not appear even remotely well\ntailored to suit its stated purposes. While we acknowledge the State’s legitimate interests in\nthis case, Crawford did not deal with either discriminatory intent or effect under Section 2.\nIn Crawford, the Court simply noted the weight of the State’s interests in the First and\nFourteenth Amendment balancing analysis, which differs from Section 2’s inquiries into\ndiscriminatory motive and impact. As noted infra, even Judge Easterbrook and the Seventh\nCircuit do not subscribe to the dissenting opinions’ views of Crawford’s or Frank’s holdings.\nWe likewise decline to read into Crawford the inapposite principle that the State may\ninvidiously discriminate or impermissibly disparately burden minorities so long as it\narticulates “preventing voter fraud” as one purpose of a restrictive law.\n                                             44\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 45      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\napplied challenges Plaintiffs make in this case.

But\nthe court noted that neither Crawford nor Frank foreclose the argument that\nan indigency exception may be necessary to prevent an unconstitutional\nburden on plaintiffs hindered from voting and obtaining photo IDs due to\nfinancial hardship and other factors like those exhibited by the Plaintiffs in\nthis case. 40 Frank II, 819 F.3d at 386–87. The Seventh Circuit remanded the\nplaintiffs’ constitutional claims to the district court for further consideration of\nan as-applied challenge factually similar to the one Plaintiffs make in this case.\nId. at 385–86, 388.\n\n\n\n\n       40 Specifically, the Seventh Circuit noted the distinction between the general facial\nchallenge in Frank and the more particular as-applied challenge in Frank II:\n       The argument plaintiffs now present is different. Instead of saying that\n       inconvenience for some voters means that no one needs photo ID, plaintiffs\n       contend that high hurdles for some persons eligible to vote entitle those\n       particular persons to relief. Plaintiffs’ approach is potentially sound if even a\n       single person eligible to vote is unable to get acceptable photo ID with reasonable\n       effort. The right to vote is personal and is not defeated by the fact that 99% of\n       other people can secure the necessary credentials easily. Plaintiffs now accept\n       the propriety of requiring photo ID from persons who already have or can get\n       it with reasonable effort, while endeavoring to protect the voting rights of those\n       who encounter high hurdles. This is compatible with our opinion and mandate,\n       just as it is compatible with Crawford.\nFrank II, 819 F.3d at 386–87 (emphasis added).\n                                              45\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 46      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\n       Having established that the two-part analysis and Gingles factors are\nappropriate standards for examining Plaintiffs’ Section 2 claim, 41 we evaluate\nthe district court’s discriminatory effect finding for clear error. See Operation\nPush, 932 F.2d at 410.\n       2. SB 14’s Disparate Impact\n       The district court found that 608,470 registered voters, or 4.5% of all\nregistered voters in Texas, lack SB 14 ID. Veasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n659. Of those, 534,512 voters did not qualify for a disability exemption from\nSB 14’s requirements. Id. The latter figure, which was derived by comparing\nthe Texas Election Management System with databases containing evidence\nof who possesses SB 14 ID, is known as the “No-Match List.” 42 Id. The district\ncourt credited expert analysis and testimony by the individual Plaintiffs,\nfinding that SB 14 imposed excessive and disparate burdens on minority voters\n\n\n\n\n       41   One of the dissenting opinions proposes a different analysis to apply in Section 2\n“results” cases. This opinion asserts that the test should be “simple and consistent,” meaning\nthat we should ignore the Supreme Court’s guidance in Gingles, Congress’s intention as\nexpressed in the Senate Factors, and, in practice, that we should require outright denial of\nthe right to vote to show a Section 2 violation. Jones Dissenting Op. at 53. Unfortunately,\nassessing whether a law has a discriminatory impact is no simple matter and does not lend\nitself to simple formulations. As we have shown, neither do many other fact-dependent tests\nthat we routinely apply in other contexts. We must undertake this difficult work, even if the\nanalytical frameworks best suited to the task are not as neat and tidy as we would prefer.\nSee Clements, 999 F.2d at 860 (noting that standards in Section 2 cases “must reflect the\ncentral purpose of the Voting Rights Act and its intended liberality as well as the practical\ndifficulties of proof in the real world of trial,” especially since “greater certitude frequently\nmay be purchased only at the expense of other values”).\n       42 While the State’s expert criticized this calculation, he conceded that the\nmethodology used to derive this figure was well accepted. Nonetheless, he attempted to\nchallenge the No-Match List because 21,731 people on the No-Match List later voted in the\nspring 2014 election. We accept the well-reasoned logic of the district court, which noted that\nsome of those 21,731 who voted may have done so by mail, which does not require SB 14 ID,\nwhile others may have obtained SB 14 ID between the calculation of the No-Match List and\nthe spring 2014 election.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 660.\n                                              46\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 47     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nwho lack SB 14 ID, including many Plaintiffs. Id. at 664–77. This evidence\nsupports the district court’s findings regarding SB 14’s disparate impact.\n       (a) Expert Analyses of SB 14’s Impact\n       Plaintiffs’ experts relied on four distinct methods of analysis to\ndetermine the races of those on the No-Match List. 43 Id. at 660–62. Those\nincluded: (1) ecological regression analysis, (2) homogenous block group\nanalysis, (3) comparing the No-Match List to a Spanish Surname Voter\nRegistration list, and (4) reliance on data provided by Catalist LLC, a company\nthat compiles election data. Id. at 661. The ecological regression analysis\nperformed by Dr. Stephen Ansolabehere, an expert in American electoral\npolitics and statistical methods in political science, which compared the No-\nMatch List with census data, revealed that Hispanic registered voters and\nBlack registered voters were respectively 195% and 305% more likely than\ntheir Anglo peers to lack SB 14 ID. Id. According to Dr. Ansolabehere, this\ndisparity is “statistically significant and ‘highly unlikely to have arisen by\nchance.’” Id. The homogenous block group analysis yielded similar results,\nand other experts arrived at similar conclusions.                  Id. at 661–62.      These\nstatistical analyses of the No-Match List were corroborated by a survey of over\n2,300 eligible Texas voters, which concluded that Blacks were 1.78 times more\nlikely than Whites, and Latinos 2.42 times more likely, to lack SB 14 ID. Id.\n\n\n\n       43  We recognize that the terms used to describe different racial or ethnic groups\ninoffensively can themselves be the subject of dispute. Where we quote a witness or the\ndistrict court or where we discuss a witness’s testimony, we use their terms. For our part,\nbecause we are a reviewing court, while recognizing the imperfections of these terms, we use\nthe terms used by the district court and the parties to refer to the three groups that were the\nsubject of the evidence in this case: Anglos (used to describe non-Hispanic Caucasians),\nHispanics, and African Americans. We also recognize that many Texans identify with more\nthan one racial or ethnic group and some Texans do not fall into any of these three groups;\nwe address the evidence and arguments as they were presented by the parties.\n                                              47\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 48   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nat 662–63. Even the study performed by the State’s expert, which the district\ncourt found suffered from “significant methodological oversights,” found that\n4% of eligible White voters lacked SB 14 ID, compared to 5.3% of eligible Black\nvoters and 6.9% of eligible Hispanic voters. Id. at 663 & n.239. The district\ncourt thus credited the testimony and analyses of Plaintiffs’ three experts, each\nof which found that SB 14 disparately impacts African-American and Hispanic\nregistered voters in Texas. Id. at 663.\n      The district court likewise concluded that SB 14 disproportionately\nimpacts the poor, who are disproportionately minorities. Id. at 664–65. It\ncredited expert testimony that 21.4% of eligible voters earning less than\n$20,000 per year lack SB 14 ID, compared to only 2.6% of voters earning\nbetween $100,000 and $150,000 per year.           Id. at 664.     Lower income\nrespondents were also more likely to lack the underlying documents to get an\nEIC. Id. Dr. Jane Henrici, an anthropologist and professorial lecturer at\nGeorge Washington University, explained that:\n      [U]nreliable and irregular wage work and other income . . . affect\n      the cost of taking the time to locate and bring the requisite papers\n      and identity cards, travel to a processing site, wait through the\n      assessment, and get photo identifications. This is because most\n      job opportunities do not include paid sick or other paid leave;\n      taking off from work means lost income. Employed low-income\n      Texans not already in possession of such documents will struggle\n      to afford income loss from the unpaid time needed to get photo\n      identification.\nId. (alteration in original).\n      Furthermore, the court found that the poor are less likely to avail\nthemselves of services that require ID, such as obtaining credit and other\nfinancial services.   Id.   They are also less likely to own vehicles and are\ntherefore more likely to rely on public transportation. Id. at 665, 672–73. As\na result, the poor are less likely to have a driver’s license and face greater\n                                      48\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 49     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nobstacles in obtaining photo identification. Id. Even obtaining an EIC poses\nan obstacle—the district court credited evidence that hundreds of thousands of\nvoters face round-trip travel times of 90 minutes or more to the nearest location\nissuing EICs. Id. at 672. Of eligible voters without access to a vehicle, a large\npercentage faced trips of three hours or more to obtain an EIC. 44 Id.\n       (b) The State’s Challenges to the District Court’s Analysis\n       Although the State does not dispute the underlying factual findings, it\nidentifies several purported legal errors in the district court’s decision. We\naddress only the most relevant challenges at length herein. 45 We conclude that\n\n\n\n       44 Before the panel, the State attacked the entirety of the district court’s findings on\nthe grounds that the lower court did not distinguish between SB 14’s statutory provisions\nand the Department of Public Safety’s implementing regulations. Although an issue raised\nfor the first time on appeal, like this one, is waived, Fruge v. Amerisure Mut. Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"617674\"><a href=\"/opinion/617674/fruge-v-amerisure-mut-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 747 (5th Cir. 2011), this argument likewise fails on the merits. The State’s proposed\nrule of law would contradict both Gingles’s demand that courts take a “functional view of the\npolitical process” in assessing Section 2 claims, 478 U.S. at 45, 48 n.15, and Section 2’s\nlanguage itself, which proscribes voting practices “imposed or applied” such that they produce\na discriminatory result, 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). Moreover, we have previously affirmed a\ndistrict court’s finding of discriminatory impact where the district court found the law\ndelegated too much discretion to local officials. See Operation Push, 932 F.2d at 404.\n       45 Other challenges brought by the State include its argument that that the analyses\nrelied upon by the district court are unreliable because one source of data—the State’s voter\nregistration database—does not list the race or ethnicity of voters. The State contends that\nPlaintiffs’ expert should have relied instead on data provided by the Department of Public\nSafety (“DPS”). The district court rightly rejected this argument. The DPS database did not\nallow registrants to identify themselves as “Hispanic” until May 2010. As the Texas Director\nof Elections conceded, the number of Hispanic registered voters is “exponentially higher”\nthan the DPS records would suggest. We cannot fault the district court for refusing to rely\non inaccurate data, particularly in light of the State’s failure to maintain accurate data.\n        Additionally, the State suggests that conveying the disparity in ID possession in\ncomparative percentages is misleading. See Frank, 768 F.3d at 755 n.3 (stating that\npurveying data as a comparative percentage is a “misuse” that “produces a number of little\nrelevance to the problem”). Instead, the State believes a less deceptive method is to state\nthat 2% of Anglo, 5.9% of Hispanic, and 8.1% of African-American registered voters lack SB\n14 ID. Even assuming the State is correct, conveying the disparities in the way the State\nsuggests does not change the analysis. The district court did not err in concluding that SB\n14 disproportionately impacts Hispanic and African-American voters.\n                                              49\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 50     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nthe district court did not reversibly err in determining that SB 14 violates\nSection 2 by disparately impacting minority voters.\n       First, the State disputes the propriety of using statistical analyses to\ndetermine the racial composition of the No-Match List. Relying on Bartlett v.\nStrickland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145901\"><a href=\"/opinion/145901/bartlett-v-strickland/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17–18 (2009), the State argues that the Supreme Court\nforeclosed using statistical analysis to determine the racial composition of a\ngroup of voters. That is a mischaracterization. Strickland cautions against\nadopting standards that require judges to make complicated, race-based\npredictions in redistricting cases, a concern that is not implicated here. Id. It\nis well within the district court’s purview to assess whether minorities are\ndisproportionately affected by a change in the law based on statistical\nanalyses. See, e.g., Operation Push, 932 F.2d at 410–11. Using accepted\nstatistical methodologies to estimate the racial composition of Texas voters\ndoes not require the type of race-based predictions that the Court referenced\nin Strickland. 46 Instead, this case is more akin to Operation Push, in which\nthis court approved using surveys and “independent statistical tests” to project\nthe impact on minorities of newly enacted voter registration procedures. Id.\n\n\n\n\n       Finally, the State argues for the first time on appeal that there is no disparate impact\nwhere, as here, the gross number of Anglos without SB 14 ID—296,156 people—almost totals\nthe number of African-American, Hispanic, and “other” voters without SB 14 ID—312,314\npeople. Courts have never required the gross number of affected minority voters to exceed\nthe gross number of affected Anglo voters. See, e.g., League of Women Voters, 769 F.3d at\n233; see also Frank, 768 F.3d at 753–54 (comparing the percentage of minority voters without\nqualifying ID to the percentage of Anglos without such ID). We decline to address this\nargument raised for the first time on appeal. See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18310\"><a href=\"/opinion/18310/leverette-v-louisville-ladder-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341–42 (5th Cir. 1999).\n       46These problematic predictions included inquiries like: “What types of candidates\nhave white and minority voters supported together in the past and will those trends\ncontinue?” Strickland, 556 U.S. at 17.\n                                              50\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 51   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\n      Second, the State relies on Strickland to argue that the canon of\nconstitutional avoidance militates against requiring the State to ensure that\nvoters of various races possess voter ID in equal measure. See 556 U.S. at 18.\nThe district court’s discriminatory effect finding, if affirmed, would do no such\nthing, nor does Section 2 mandate the sort of remedy to which the State objects.\nSection 2 merely prohibits the State from imposing burdens on minority voters\nthat would disproportionately abridge their ability to participate in the\npolitical process. Cf. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys.\nProject, Inc. (“Inclusive Communities”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2959750\"><a href=\"/opinion/2959750/texas-dept-of-housing-and-community-affairs-v-inclusive-communities/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If additional measures are adopted, courts should\nstrive to design them to eliminate racial disparities through race-neutral\nmeans. Remedial orders that impose racial targets or quotas might raise more\ndifficult constitutional questions.” (citation omitted)).\n      Finally, before our full court, the State refined its argument that our\nholding that SB 14 violates Section 2 would make Section 2 “invalid as no\nlonger congruent and proportional to the Fifteenth Amendment.” Relatedly,\nthe State and dissenting opinions characterize the district court’s findings as\nresting solely on a statistical disparity in SB 14 ID rates, rather than any\nconcrete proof that voters were denied the right to vote. These arguments miss\nthe mark. In particular, the constitutionality argument by the State is short\nsighted and ignores the history and text of the Fifteenth Amendment. If the\nState had its way, the Fifteenth Amendment and Section 2 would only prohibit\noutright denial of the right to vote and overtly purposeful discrimination. Yet,\nboth the Fifteenth Amendment and Section 2 also explicitly prohibit\nabridgement of the right to vote. U.S. CONST. amend.

The standards we apply here, and our manner of\napplying them, show that Section 2’s protections remain closely tied to the\npower granted Congress by the Fifteenth Amendment. 47\n       Regarding the district court’s findings, they rest on far more than a\nstatistical disparity. The district court’s lengthy opinion goes through the\nevidence supporting its findings in great detail, and we will not repeat all of\nthat evidence here for the sake of clarity and brevity.

However, a few examples show that the district\ncourt relied on concrete evidence regarding the excessive burdens faced by\nPlaintiffs in making its findings. This evidence personified the expert analysis\ncredited by the district court regarding SB 14’s discriminatory effect.\n\n\n\n\n       47  Additionally, we note that this court and many others have upheld the\nconstitutional validity of the Section 2 results test. See, e.g., Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. at 990–\n91 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (collecting cases assuming Section 2’s constitutionality); Jones,\n727 F.2d at 373–74; United States v.

The district court found that “[t]he\nPlaintiffs [d]emonstrate[d] the [i]mpact” of SB 14 along several axes, including:\n(1) the difficulty of obtaining an EIC and voting with the proper ID because of\nTexas’s poor implementation of this program; (2) the cost of underlying\ndocuments necessary to obtain an EIC or other SB 14 ID; (3) difficulties with\ndelayed, nonexistent, out-of-state, or amended birth certificates due to\nnontraditional births and errors on birth certificates; (4) long distances and\nother travel issues that made getting to a registrar and DPS office problematic\nfor many Plaintiffs; (5) a strict disability exemption 48; and (6) a burdensome\nalternative of voting absentee. See id. Some of the Plaintiffs faced difficulties\nalong multiple axes in attempting to get SB 14 ID and vote in person.\n\n\n\n\n       48   SB 14 exempts certain disabled persons from its photo ID requirements, if they\nsubmit an application to be exempted with written documentation, including: (1) “a\nstatement in a form prescribed by the secretary of state that the applicant does not have a\nform of identification acceptable” under SB 14’s codified provision, TEX. ELEC. CODE\n§ 63.0101, and (2) documentation from either “the United States Social Security\nAdministration evidencing the applicant has been determined to have a disability,” or\ndocumentation “from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs evidencing the\napplicant has a disability rating of at least 50 percent.” TEX. ELEC. CODE § 13.002(i). The\ndistrict court found that Plaintiffs Carrier, Espinoza, Mendez, and Taylor “may qualify for\nSB 14’s disability exemption,” but that “[t]hese Plaintiffs were not made aware of this\nexemption when they went to DPS or other relevant offices” and that “[a]s of January 15,\n2014, only 18 voters were granted a disability exemption in Texas.” Veasey v. Perry, 71 F.\nSupp. 3d at 674 (citing TEX. ELEC. CODE § 13.002(i)). This fact evidences the increased\nburden SB 14 places on Plaintiffs and others on the No-Match List because of the lack of\nfunding devoted to educating voters. Although this is not an overwhelming burden in and of\nitself, the requirement and poor implementation provide one more obstacle for disabled\nplaintiffs to clear in attempting to vote in person without SB 14 ID. In this case, some of the\nPlaintiffs who could have used this exception were turned away at the polls and were never\nmade aware of it.\n                                             53\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530        Page: 54     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\n       First, the record evidence disproves the State’s claim that “the plaintiffs\nhave failed to identify a single individual who faces a substantial obstacle to\nvoting because of SB 14.” 49 For one thing, the district court found that multiple\nPlaintiffs were turned away when they attempted to vote, and some of those\nPlaintiffs were not offered provisional ballots to attempt to resolve the issue.\nId. at 668. One of those Plaintiffs, Floyd Carrier, “was well-known to the\nelection workers at his polling place, but was not offered a provisional ballot\nand was not permitted to cast a vote.” Id.          Floyd Carrier had the help of his\nson in attempting to obtain SB 14 ID, but they faced an almost impossible\nbureaucratic morass when they tried to get the required underlying\ndocumentation. Due to these obstacles and the lack of training and education\nabout SB 14’s requirements, Floyd Carrier was completely prevented from\nvoting. See id. at 668 & n.268 (noting that throughout their efforts to obtain\nunderlying documentation and qualifying ID for Floyd Carrier, no one\ninformed the Carriers about the EIC).\n       Plaintiff Bates faced a similar problem when she reported to the polls, as\nshe was unaware that her existing ID was insufficient until she attempted to\nvote in person. At that point, it was too late to cast an absentee ballot, and she\nwas not able to obtain SB 14 ID in time to cure her provisional ballot because\nshe could not afford to purchase her Mississippi birth certificate at its $42 cost\non her $321 fixed monthly income. Id. at 649 & n.115, 665. Plaintiff Gordon\nBenjamin was not able to obtain an EIC at the DPS because he was unable to\nget his Louisiana birth certificate for the hefty $81 fee online. Eventually, his\n\n\n\n       49 Before the panel that initially heard this case, the State made an even bolder\nclaim—that the Plaintiffs “failed to show that SB 14 prevented a single person from voting.”\nThis claim is demonstrably false, as the experiences of Plaintiffs Floyd Carrier and Sammie\nLouise Bates show, see infra.\n                                            54\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530           Page: 55     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nsister was able to get his birth certificate in person on a trip through Louisiana,\nbut he was unable to make that trip before the 2013 elections. Id. at 671, 673.\nBenjamin cast a provisional ballot that went uncured. Many more stories like\nthese proliferate in the pages of the district court’s opinion. Id. at 667–77.\n       Traveling to DPS offices to obtain EICs posed an additional obstacle for\nmany Plaintiffs.       The district court found that four Plaintiffs rely almost\nexclusively on public transportation. One of these Plaintiffs, Ken Gandy, faces\nan hour-long, one-way trip to reach the nearest DPS office. See id. at 673.\nPlaintiffs Estrada and Espinoza use family and friends for transportation, but\nthey each face “a 60-mile roundtrip ride to the nearest DPS station.” Id.\n       The State failed to contest any of this evidence, except to suggest that\nthese Plaintiffs could vote by mail. The district court did not clearly err in\nfinding that mail-in voting is not an acceptable substitute for in-person voting\nin the circumstances presented by this case. 50 We are by no means criticizing\nTexas for making mail-in voting available, as it represents an important bridge\nfor many who would otherwise have difficulty appearing in person. Instead,\nwe conclude that it is not the equivalent of in-person voting for those who are\nable and want to vote in person. Mail-in voting involves a complex procedure\nthat cannot be done at the last minute. See id. at 688–90 (describing the\ncomplex process of obtaining and submitting a mail-in ballot). 51                        It also\ndeprives voters of the help they would normally receive in filling out ballots at\n\n\n       50 We do not opine on the effect, under Section 2, of other possible absentee balloting\narrangements, only on the inadequacy of mail-in voting in these circumstances to mitigate or\neliminate the discriminatory impact of SB 14.\n       51  For example, mail-in voting requires obtaining and submitting a correctly filled-\nout and signed application to the early voting clerk in the voter’s county “on or before the\n18th day before election day,” TEX. ELEC. CODE § 86.008(a), plus receiving an absentee ballot\nby mail, filling out the ballot correctly, and ensuring the proper state party receives the ballot\non or before election day, id. §§ 86.004–.007, 86.008(b).\n                                               55\n\f    Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 56    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nthe polls, which Plaintiff Naomi Eagleton cited as a reason why she prefers to\nvote in person. Id. at 689.\n      Elderly plaintiffs may also face difficulties getting to their mailboxes,\nlike Plaintiff Carrier, who has to be driven to his mailbox because it is at the\nlocal post office. Id. at 673. Seven of the Plaintiffs further testified they are\nreluctant to vote by mail due to the increased risk of fraud because of people\nwho harvest mail-in ballots from the elderly. Id. at 676–77. The district court\ncredited expert testimony showing mail-in ballot fraud is a significant threat—\nunlike in-person voter fraud. Id. at 639–41, 676. Finally, with mail-in voting,\nvoters lose the ability to account for last-minute developments, like candidates\ndropping out of a primary race, or targeted mailers and other information\ndisseminated right before the election. Id. at 689. We discern no clear error\nin the district court’s finding that mail-in voting for specific subsets of Texas\nvoters does not sufficiently mitigate the burdens imposed by SB 14.\n      The State further claims SB 14 has no disparate impact because the\nState offers “free” EICs, and after SB 983, free underlying documentation to\nTexas voters who were born in Texas. Yet, the record is replete with evidence\nthat the State devoted little funding or attention to educating voters about the\nnew voter ID requirements, resulting in many Plaintiffs lacking information\nabout these supposed accommodations until they were informed about them\nduring the course of this lawsuit. See, e.g., id. at 667–69, 676 (describing the\n“insufficient” implementation of the EIC program, the fact that many Plaintiffs\ndid not know about the EIC or required voter ID until being turned away at\nthe polls, that one Plaintiff paid $22 for his birth certificate because he was not\ntold about the reduced-cost alternative then available, and other issues with\nthe implementation of SB 14). We find no clear error in the district court’s\n\n\n                                        56\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 57      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nfinding that the State’s lackluster educational efforts resulted in additional\nburdens on Texas voters. 52 See, e.g., id. at 668.\n       We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that SB\n14 imposes significant and disparate burdens on the right to vote.\n       3. The Gingles Factors\n       We next consider the district court’s finding that SB 14 “produces a\ndiscriminatory result that is actionable because [it] . . . interact[s] with social\nand historical conditions in Texas to cause an inequality in the electoral\nopportunities enjoyed by African–Americans and Hispanic voters.” Id. at 698.\nThe district court found Gingles factors 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 probative. Id. at\n697.    Again, we conclude it was proper to utilize the Gingles factors to\ndetermine whether conditions engendered by current and former state-\nsponsored discrimination are sufficiently linked to the racial disparity in ID\npossession under SB 14.\n\n\n       52  These lackluster efforts stand in stark contrast to those of other states whose voter\nID laws have thus far passed Section 2 scrutiny.

Contrary\nto the State’s hyperbolic predictions, these different outcomes show the importance of the\nfact-bound Section 2 analysis we employ here.

We repeat Shelby\nCounty’s admonishment that “history did not end in 1965,” 133 S. Ct. at 2628,\nand emphasize that contemporary examples of discrimination are more\nprobative than historical examples. However, even long-ago acts of official\ndiscrimination give context to the analysis, 53 and the district court credited\nmore contemporary examples of state-sponsored discrimination. Veasey v.\nPerry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 635–36, 700. One contemporary example is the district\ncourt’s finding that “[i]n every redistricting cycle since 1970, Texas has been\nfound to have violated the VRA with racially gerrymandered districts.” Id. at\n636 & n.23 (collecting cases). The district court further noted that, before it\nwas vacated along with preclearance by Shelby County, “a three-judge court\n\n\n       53  The district court cited many examples of Texas’s long history of state-sponsored\ndiscrimination. See Veasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 633–36. Less recent examples include\nall-white primary elections that persisted from 1895 to 1944 despite the Supreme Court\nattempting to curb the practice in 1927, literacy and secret ballot restrictions that persisted\nuntil struck down in 1970, and poll taxes that were eventually struck down in 1966. Id. at\n633–35. When the poll tax was made unconstitutional in 1964 by the Twenty-Fourth\nAmendment, Texas attempted to separate federal and state ballots, so that the State could\nstill impose a poll tax for state ballots. That effort never succeeded because it was struck\ndown as unconstitutional after the Voting Rights Act was passed and applied to Texas.\nEventually, Texas ratified the Twenty-Fourth Amendment in 2009. In the wake of Texas’s\ninability to retain poll taxes, the district court found that Texas passed a voter re-registration\nrequirement in 1966 that persisted in the form of purging the voter rolls after re-registration\nwas ruled unconstitutional in the early 1970s. Id. at 635. Ultimately, the purging practice\nwas enjoined under the preclearance portions of the Voting Rights Act. Id. While long-ago\nhistory of discrimination is of limited probative value when considering whether the\nLegislature acted with discriminatory intent, it cannot be ignored in the discriminatory effect\nanalysis, because even these seemingly remote instances of State-sponsored discrimination\ncontinue to produce socioeconomic conditions that the district court found caused the racial\ndisparities in possession of SB 14 ID.\n                                               58\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 59     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nhad found that two of Texas’s 2011 redistricting plans violated the VRA.” Id.\nat 636 n.23. In other words, the 2011 Texas Legislature was found to have\nviolated the Voting Rights Act by passing two redistricting plans that were\nfound to have a retrogressive or racially discriminatory impact in the same\nlegislative session that resulted in SB 14. 54\n       The district court found that these past instances of discrimination, all\nthe way through the 2011 legislative session that produced SB 14, were\nrelevant in part because each time, “the Texas Legislature relied on the\njustification that its discriminatory measures were necessary to combat voter\nfraud.” Id. at 636. The Texas Legislature relied on that same justification in\npassing SB 14, even though the evidence showed that in-person voter fraud “is\nvery rare.” Id.\n       Even acknowledging that long-ago evidence of discrimination has less\nforce than more contemporary evidence under Shelby County, this factor and\nother factors support the district court’s finding that SB 14 has a\ndiscriminatory effect.\n       (b) Gingles Factor 2: Racially Polarized Voting\n       The district court relied primarily on the testimony of Dr. Barry Burden,\na political science professor, and Mr. George Korbel, an expert on voting rights,\n\n\n\n       54  Of course, the preclearance analysis differs from the Section 2 discriminatory effect\nanalysis. The State had the burden to show it should receive preclearance in Texas v. Holder,\nwhereas the Plaintiffs have the burden to show a discriminatory effect in the analysis we\nemploy here. Cf.

However, the opinion was not vacated on the merits and remains factually\nrelevant as a contemporary example of State-sponsored discrimination based on the finding\nof a three-judge federal court.\n                                              59\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 60      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\nin concluding that racially polarized voting exists throughout Texas.

For support, the district court noted that the gap\nbetween Anglo and Latino Republican support is between 30 and 40 percentage\npoints, the Supreme Court has previously acknowledged the existence of\nracially polarized voting in Texas, and that in other litigation, Texas has\nconceded that racially polarized voting exists in 252 of its 254 counties. Id. at\n637–38. The State did not contest these findings before the district court. 55\n        (c) Gingles Factor 5: Effects of Past Discrimination\n       Next, the district court appraised “[t]he extent to which members of the\nminority group . . . bear the effects of discrimination in areas such as\neducation, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate\neffectively in the political process.” Veasey v.

Id. at 666–67.\n         The    district   court   found   that   the     history   of   State-sponsored\ndiscrimination led to these disparities in education, employment, housing, and\ntransportation. See id. at 636. For example, according to Dr. Vernon Burton,\na professor with an expertise in race relations, past State-sponsored\nemployment discrimination and Texas’s maintenance of a “separate but equal”\neducation system both contributed to the unequal outcomes that presently\nexist.

In other words, SB 14 does not\n       disproportionately impact African–Americans and Hispanics by\n       mere chance.

Abridgement is defined as “[t]he reduction or diminution of\n\n\n       56According to Dr. Ansolabehere’s expert report, 83 to 87% of Anglos of voting age and\n84 to 88% of Anglo citizens of voting age in Texas are registered to vote, compared to 65 to\n77% of Blacks of voting age and 75 to 80% of Black citizens of voting age, and 50 to 55% of\nHispanics of voting age and 75 to 80% of Hispanic citizens of voting age. Likewise, 41.8% of\nAnglos voted in 2010 compared to 31.3% of Blacks and 22% of Hispanics. In 2012, 64.3% of\nregistered Anglos voted, compared to 45% of registered Blacks and 59.8% of registered\nHispanics.\n                                             62\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530         Page: 63   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\nsomething,” Abridgement, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014), while the\nVoting Rights Act defines “vote” to include “all action necessary to make a vote\neffective including, but not limited to, registration or other action required by\nState law prerequisite to voting, casting a ballot, and having such ballot\ncounted.” 52 U.S.C. § 10101(e). The district court’s finding that SB 14 abridges\nthe right to vote by causing a racial disparity in voter ID possession falls\ncomfortably within this definition. Our case law dictates the same outcome.\nSee Operation Push, 932 F.2d at 409, 413 (affirming the district court’s finding\nthat a voter registration law violated Section 2 when it resulted in a 25%\ndifference in the registration rates between eligible black and white voters);\nsee also Chisom, 501 U.S. at 408 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“If, for example, a\ncounty permitted voter registration for only three hours one day a week, and\nthat made it more difficult for blacks to register than whites, blacks would have\nless opportunity ‘to participate in the political process’ than whites, and\n[Section] 2 would therefore be violated . . . .”).\n      For the same reason, we decline to require a showing of lower turnout to\nprove a Section 2 violation. An election law may keep some voters from going\nto the polls, but in the same election, turnout by different voters might increase\nfor some other reason. See Veasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 655 (discussing\nthe effect of President Obama’s candidacy on voter turnout). That does not\nmean the voters kept away were any less disenfranchised.                Requiring a\nshowing of lower turnout also presents problems for pre-election challenges to\nvoting laws, when no such data is yet available. More fundamentally, no\nauthority supports requiring a showing of lower turnout, since abridgement of\nthe right to vote is prohibited along with denial. U.S. CONST. amend. XV; 52\nU.S.C. § 10301(a). Illuminating this last point is the State’s answer at oral\nargument to a question about whether its proposed Section 2 effects test would\n                                         63\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 64     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nprohibit literacy tests (if they were not otherwise specifically prohibited) from\nbeing imposed as a condition for voting. 57 The State contended that literacy\ntests “would almost certainly” be struck down under its proposed Section 2\neffects test—but only if plaintiffs could show a resulting “denial of equal\nopportunity,” i.e., a “voter turnout disparity.” 58\n       We decline to cripple the Voting Rights Act by using the State’s proposed\nanalysis. Doing so would unmoor the Voting Rights Act from its history and\ndecades of well-established interpretations about its protections. See Allen,\n393 U.S. at 565 (“The Voting Rights Act was aimed at the subtle, as well as the\nobvious, state regulations which have the effect of denying citizens their right\n\n\n       57 In full, the exchange between a member of our court at the en banc oral argument\nand the State’s counsel follows:\n               JUDGE: “[I]f literacy tests weren’t separately prohibited, would a\n      literacy test be invalidated by your proposed equal treatment test?”\n               STATE’S COUNSEL: “Insofar as literacy tests, you know, first of all,\n      that would obviously be separately banned under —”\n               JUDGE: “Beside[s] the separate ban.”\n               STATE’S COUNSEL: “I–I believe insofar as you’re putting aside the\n      separate banning, and insofar as you’re putting aside a purpose claim, I think\n      you would still ask, ‘is this a denial of equal opportunity?’ And in that scenario\n      you’d have to show a prima facie case, and it would almost certainly, in the\n      relevant jurisdictions that we’re talking about, have been able to show a voter\n      turnout disparity, ah, particularly, you know, Operation Push v. Mabus would\n      have been another case like this where you had legacy systems in place, and\n      under those legacy systems, there would have been liability.”\n       58  One of the dissenting opinions would require a showing of decreased turnout to\nprevail on a discriminatory effect claim. This argument is unsupported by case law and\nignores the following points. First, such an approach would foreclose the ability to file pre-\nenforcement challenges, which are particularly important now that preclearance is not\nrequired. As the concurring opinion acknowledges, the Supreme Court suggested in Shelby\nCounty that courts could “block voting laws from going into effect” through injunctive relief\nunder Section 2. See Shelby Cty., 133 S. Ct. at 2619. Second, turnout itself does not answer\nthe question of a particular voter being denied access: turnout of certain people might\nincrease while turnout of others decreases, leaving overall turnout the same; yet, those\ndenied the right to vote are still disenfranchised. Third, this argument also conflates\nabridgement and denial: in previous times, some people paid the poll tax or passed the\nliteracy test and therefore voted, but their rights were still abridged.\n                                             64\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 65   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nto vote because of their race.”); Chisom, 501 U.S. at 406 (Scalia, J., dissenting)\n(“This new ‘results’ criterion [from the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights\nAct] provides a powerful, albeit sometimes blunt, weapon with which to attack\neven the most subtle forms of discrimination.”). Instead, we will adhere to the\nSupreme Court’s instruction to examine challenged laws and practices in an\nintensely fact-based and local totality-of-the-circumstances analysis.        See\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 36–38, 79.\n      Thus, while evidence of decreased turnout is relevant, it is not required\nto prove a Section 2 claim of vote denial or abridgement. In this case, the record\ncontains evidence that minority voters generally turn out in lower numbers\nthan non-minority voters and that State-sponsored discrimination created\nsocioeconomic disparities, which hinder minority voters’ general participation\nin the political process. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in\ndetermining that the impact of past and current discrimination on minorities\nin Texas favors finding that SB 14 has a discriminatory effect under Section 2.\n      (d) Gingles Factor 6: Racial Appeals in Political Campaigns\n      While the existence of racial appeals in political campaigns is a factor\nthat may be indicative of a law’s disparate impact, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at 40,\nit is not highly probative here (and racial appeals seem to have been used by\nboth minorities and non-minorities). The district court found that such appeals\nstill exist in Texas and cited anecdotal evidence to support its finding. See\nVeasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 638–39. While we do not overturn the\nunderlying factual finding, we do not agree that such anecdotal evidence of\nracial campaign appeals shows that SB 14 denies or abridges the right to vote.\n\n\n\n\n                                       65\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 66   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\n      (e) Gingles Factor 7 and Factor 8: Minority Public Officials and\n      Responsiveness to Minority Needs\n      The extent to which minority candidates are elected to public office also\ncontextualizes the degree to which vestiges of discrimination continue to\nreduce minority participation in the political process. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at\n45. The district court found that African Americans comprise 13.3% of the\npopulation in Texas, but only 1.7% of all Texas elected officials are African\nAmerican.    Veasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 638.       Similarly, Hispanics\ncomprise 30.3% of the population but hold only 7.1% of all elected positions.\nId. Within the Texas Legislature, however, both groups fare better—African\nAmericans hold 11.1% of seats in the Legislature while Hispanics hold 21.1%\nof seats. Id. Again, the State does not contest these findings. Id.\n      The district court also found that Texas’s history of discrimination,\ncoupled with SB 14’s effect on minorities in Texas and the Legislature’s\nresponse to ameliorative amendments, demonstrated a lack of responsiveness\nto minority needs by elected officials. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45. The evidence\nsupports the district court’s finding that “the legislature knew that minorities\nwould be most affected by the voter ID law.” Veasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n657–58.     For instance, Representative Todd Smith, a proponent of the\nlegislation, stated that it was “common sense” the law would have a\ndisproportionate effect on minorities. See id. at 657. Similarly, Bryan Hebert,\nDeputy General Counsel in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor and author\nof some of the provisions of SB 14, warned that SB 14 was unlikely to obtain\n(the now-defunct) preclearance under the Voting Rights Act without further\nforms of permissible ID. Id. at 658.\n      The district court noted that minority legislators and constituents\ntestified about the likely disparate impact of SB 14, yet their amendments to\n\n                                       66\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 67     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nameliorate that impact were rejected without explanation.

These included amendments to expand the forms of acceptable\nID to include student IDs, federal IDs, state-government employee IDs,\nmeasures to fund education and training related to the law, and indigency\nexceptions. 59     Id. at 658, 708–10.        While this does not necessarily prove\nimproper intent on the part of those legislators, it nonetheless supports a\nconclusion of lack of responsiveness. 60\n      (f) Gingles Factor 9: Tenuousness of Policies Underlying the Law\n      The district court concluded that the policies underlying SB 14’s passage\nwere only tenuously related to the State’s interests in preventing fraud and\nincreasing voter confidence in elections. We do not deny that the State’s\narticulated objectives are legitimate state interests, as the Supreme Court has\nmade clear. See Crawford, 553 U.S. at 191. Yet, the articulation of a legitimate\ninterest is not a magic incantation a state can utter to avoid a finding of\ndisparate impact.        Even under the least searching standard of review we\nemploy for these types of challenges, there cannot be a total disconnect between\nthe State’s announced interests and the statute enacted.

The Court in Gingles and the Senate that passed the 1982\nAmendments to the Voting Rights Act acknowledged as much by including\ntenuousness among the factors to be considered. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45.\nAlong with elected officials’ lack of responsiveness to minority needs, a tenuous\nfit between the expressed policy and the provisions of the law bolsters the\nconclusion that minorities are not able to equally participate in the political\nprocess. Otherwise, elected officials would be more responsive regarding the\ndisparate impact of a law, and a law not meaningfully related to its expressed\npurpose would be abandoned or ameliorated to avoid imposing a disparate\nimpact, given the preexisting socioeconomic and political disadvantages caused\nby past and present discrimination.\n      The district court found that “the stated policies behind SB 14 are only\ntenuously related to its provisions.” Veasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 698.\nThe State is entitled to make policy choices about when and how it will address\nvarious priorities. But in this case, the provisions of SB 14 fail to correspond\nin any meaningful way to the legitimate interests the State claims to have been\nadvancing through SB 14. For example, the Legislature claimed to model its\nlaw after those from Indiana, Georgia, Wisconsin, and other states that\nincluded many more forms of acceptable identification, plus indigency\nexceptions and far more extensive educational campaigns. Yet, the Legislature\nrejected many ameliorative amendments that would have brought SB 14 in\nline with those states’ voter ID laws. See id. at 643, 658. The option of mail-\n                                        68\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 69   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nin voting also showcases the dubious connection between the State’s interests\nand SB 14’s provisions. In order to prevent voter fraud, the State has pushed\nmore vulnerable elderly voters away from in-person voting—a form of voting\nwith little proven incidence of fraud—and toward mail-in voting, which the\nrecord shows is far more vulnerable to fraud, particularly among the elderly.\nId. at 639–41, 653.    In fact, SB 14 does nothing to address the far more\nprevalent issue of fraudulent absentee ballots. Id. at 641.\n      The district court likewise found that the Legislature’s expressed\nconcerns about undocumented immigrants and noncitizens voting were\nmisplaced. It credited testimony that undocumented immigrants are unlikely\nto vote as they try to avoid contact with government agents for fear of being\ndeported. Id. at 654. At least one Representative who voted for SB 14 conceded\nthat he had no evidence to substantiate his fear of undocumented immigrants\nvoting. Id. Additionally, the district court found that SB 14 would not prevent\nnoncitizens from voting, since noncitizens can legally obtain a Texas driver’s\nlicense or concealed handgun license, two forms of SB 14 ID. Id. at 654–55.\n      The district court also found “no credible evidence” to support assertions\nthat voter turnout was low due to a lack of confidence in elections, that SB 14\nwould increase public confidence in elections, or that increased confidence\nwould boost voter turnout. Id. at 655. Two State Senators and the Director of\nthe Elections Division at the Texas Secretary of State’s office were all unaware\nof anyone abstaining from voting out of concern for voter fraud, and the\nDirector testified that implementing SB 14’s provisional ballot process might\nactually undermine voter confidence. Id.\n      Rather, the district court credited testimony that SB 14 would decrease\nvoter turnout.    Id. at 655–56.     According to a well-established formula\nemployed by political scientists to assess individuals’ likelihood of voting in an\n                                       69\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 70    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nelection, increasing the cost of voting decreases voter turnout—particularly\namong low-income individuals, as they are most cost sensitive. Id. at 656.\nFurther, the district court dismissed the argument that increased turnout\nduring the 2008 presidential election was demonstrative of increased voter\nconfidence in two states that had recently passed voter ID laws. Id. at 655.\nInstead, it found that the increased turnout, which occurred nationwide, was\ndue to President Obama’s candidacy. Id. Finally, the court also found that\npublic opinion polls—which found high levels of support for photo ID\nrequirements—were not demonstrative that SB 14 itself would promote voter\nconfidence. Id. at 656. The district court discounted the polls because they did\nnot evaluate whether voters supported SB 14 itself rather than some other\nform of voter ID law when weighed against SB 14’s exceedingly burdensome\nrequirements and attendant effect on minority voters. Id.\n      (g) Discriminatory Effect Conclusion\n      In light of its findings regarding SB 14’s disparate impact and its\napplication of the Gingles factors, the district court held that SB 14 acted in\nconcert with current and historical conditions of discrimination to diminish\nAfrican Americans’ and Hispanics’ ability to participate in the political process.\nId. at 695–98. We conclude that the district court performed the “intensely\nlocal appraisal” required by Gingles. 478 U.S. at 79. The district court clearly\ndelineated each step of its analysis, finding that:\n      (1) SB 14 specifically burdens Texans living in poverty, who are\n      less likely to possess qualified photo ID, are less able to get it, and\n      may not otherwise need it; (2) a disproportionate number of Texans\n      living in poverty are African–Americans and Hispanics; and\n      (3) African–Americans and Hispanics are more likely than Anglos\n      to be living in poverty because they continue to bear the\n      socioeconomic effects caused by decades of racial discrimination.\nVeasey v.

Furthermore, the district\ncourt’s analysis comports with the Supreme Court’s recent instruction that “a\ndisparate-impact claim that relies on a statistical disparity must fail if the\nplaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy or policies causing that\ndisparity.” 61 Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523. The district court here\nacknowledged this principle and tethered its holding to two findings. First, the\ncourt found a stark, racial disparity between those who possess or have access\nto SB 14 ID, and those who do not. Second, it applied the Gingles factors to\nconclude that SB 14 worked in concert with Texas’s legacy of state-sponsored\ndiscrimination to bring about this disproportionate result.\n       We note that, because the district court’s findings link Texas’s state-\nsponsored history of discrimination to the conditions affecting minority voters\n\n\n\n       61   Some of the dissenting opinions argue that the majority opinion holds the\nLegislature “liable for racial disparities [it] did not create” by failing to show that the\nstatistical disparity in ID possession among different races is caused by a State policy, as\nopposed to socioeconomic and historical conditions. In fact, as discussed above, the district\ncourt found that SB 14 creates a racial disparity by requiring the use of certain IDs to vote\nthat minorities disproportionately lack. Certainly the passage of SB 14 did not cause fewer\nminorities to possess certain IDs (like driver’s licenses or concealed handgun licenses).\nRather, the district court found that socioeconomic and historical conditions contributed to\nthis disparity in ID possession, which demonstrates why historical evidence of racism is\nrelevant to the Section 2 analysis. But SB 14 itself caused minorities to disproportionately\nlack the documentation that is required to vote by dictating that the documents and IDs\nrequired would be those that minorities disproportionately lack. We cannot ignore that in\npassing SB 14, the Legislature carefully selected the types of IDs that would be required to\nvote. In doing so, the Legislature selected IDs that minorities disproportionately do not\npossess and excluded IDs that minorities possess in greater numbers, without providing\nsufficient justification for those choices. The fact that this occurred on a landscape where\nminorities are less likely to possess certain forms of ID or be able to obtain those IDs, at least\nin part as a result of past instances of State-sponsored discrimination, does not absolve the\nLegislature of responsibility. Accordingly, the district court’s conclusion that SB 14 created\nracial disparities in the possession of IDs required to vote is supported by the record.\n                                               71\n\f    Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 72    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nin Texas today, we need not and do not decide whether proof of such state-\nsponsored discrimination is required under the second part of this analysis. Cf.\nFrank, 768 F.3d at 755 (reasoning that the discrimination affecting minorities\nshould be linked to the state under the second part of the two-part analysis).\nThe evidence in this record suffices to meet even this higher standard as\nenunciated in Frank. Id.\n      We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that\nSB 14 has a discriminatory effect on minorities’ voting rights in violation of\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act. As discussed below, we remand for a\nconsideration of the appropriate remedy in light of the impending general\nelection.\n III. First and Fourteenth Amendment Burden on the Right to Vote\n      Plaintiffs argue that SB 14 also unconstitutionally burdens their right\nto vote, as forbidden by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

Poll Tax\n      The Veasey Plaintiffs 62 originally alleged that SB 14 imposed a poll tax\nin violation of the Fourteenth and Twenty-Fourth Amendments. After the\npassage of SB 983, the Veasey Plaintiffs filed a Rule 28(j) Letter with this\ncourt, stating that “SB14, as amended by SB983, is no longer a poll tax.” The\nVeasey Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that “the poll tax issue is still alive”\nbecause SB 14 operated as a poll tax for nearly two years, preventing Plaintiffs\nand others from voting, and because it will take a “long time” for Texas voters\nto “learn about and acquire free birth certificates.” Additionally, even without\nthe $2 to $3 fee, the Veasey Plaintiffs argue that the process of obtaining a free\nbirth certificate and a free EIC constitutes the kind of “burdensome alternative\nprocess” that was struck down in Harman v. Forssenius, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107033\"><a href=\"/opinion/107033/harman-v-forssenius/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1965).\nBefore our full court, the Veasey Plaintiffs continue to argue that we should\n\n\n\n      62  The Veasey Plaintiffs include: Marc Veasey, Jane Hamilton, Sergio Deleon, Floyd\nCarrier, Anna Burns, Michael Montez Penny Pope, Oscar Ortiz, Koby Ozias, League of\nUnited Latin American Citizens, John Mellor-Crummey, Ken Gandy, Gordon Benjamin, and\nEvelyn Brickner.

Although SB 983 was passed when this case was already on appeal,\nwe do not need to remand this issue to the district court for two reasons: (1) we\nconclude that even before SB 983, SB 14 did not create a facial poll tax; and\n(2) the issue of SB 983’s impact on the poll tax issue is a pure question of law\n(at least as far as this facial challenge) that does not necessitate any\nreweighing of evidence or consideration of new evidence.\n       The Veasey Plaintiffs previously facially challenged SB 14 with\nrespect to Texas voters born out of state (who are unaffected by SB 983’s\npassage). Those voters could face fees in their state of birth to obtain\ndocumentation required for an EIC. We conclude that SB 14 does not\nfacially impose a poll tax on those voters. Rather, SB 14 requires all Texas\nvoters to present valid identification at the polls, exercising the State’s\n“legitimate interest in assessing the eligibility and qualifications of voters.”\nGonzalez v.

Accordingly, Ken Gandy has suffered no injury that we must address\nunder the poll tax rubric, and we conclude that SB 14 is not a poll tax as applied to him.\n                                              74\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 75   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nto demonstrate the invalidity of [the challenged law], it need only be shown\nthat it imposes a material requirement solely upon those who refuse to\nsurrender their constitutional right to vote in federal elections without paying\na poll tax.” (emphasis added)).\n      Likewise, SB 14 did not impose a poll tax on voters before the passage of\nSB 983. It did not “impose[] a material requirement solely upon those who\nrefuse[d]” to pay a poll tax, as proscribed by the Twenty-Fourth Amendment.\nId. at 541–42. Rather, it drew from the State’s power to set voter qualifications\nby requiring all voters to present a valid form of photo identification at the\npolls. See Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 408. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, as\nthe Supreme Court interpreted it in Harper, the Court has observed that a\nstate invidiously discriminates when it imposes a cost to vote with a\njustification that is “irrelevant to the voter’s qualifications.” Crawford, 553\nU.S. at 189.   Although the questions presented to the Supreme Court in\nCrawford did not include whether Indiana’s voter ID law imposed a poll tax,\nthe Court observed that a statute would be invalid under Harper’s Fourteenth-\nAmendment poll tax analysis “if the State required voters to pay a tax or a fee\nto obtain a new photo identification.” 553 U.S. at 198 (emphasis added). The\nCourt implied that requiring voters to obtain photo identification and charging\na fee for the required underlying documentation would not qualify as a poll tax,\nand we similarly conclude that SB 14’s similar requirements did not operate\nas a poll tax. See id. at 198 & n.17; see also Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 407–10.\n      As amended by SB 983, Texas law no longer imposes any direct fee for\nthe underlying documentation required to obtain a qualifying voter ID. What\nremain are the requirements that such voters travel to the local registrar or\ncounty clerk’s office, gather and present certain forms of documentation to\nreceive the certified record, travel to the DPS office with that record, and\n                                       75\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 76     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\npresent the certified record, along with two forms of supporting identification,\nto receive an EIC. See 37 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 15.182(3)–(4). The Veasey\nPlaintiffs appear to argue in their Rule 28(j) Letter that these obligations make\nSB 14 unconstitutional under Harman because they “requir[e] voters to follow\na burdensome alternative process to avoid paying a . . . poll tax.” 65\n       To the extent the Veasey Plaintiffs now attempt to analogize SB 14 and\nSB 983 to the scheme in Harman, we reject that analogy. In Harman, the state\nof Virginia forced those who would vote in federal elections to choose between\npaying a poll tax and meeting a registration requirement before each election\nyear. 380 U.S. at 531–32. The Virginia constitution mandated that federal\nvoters file a certificate of residence within a specific date range, beginning on\nOctober 1 of the year before the federal election at issue and ending on a date\nsix months before the date of the federal election. Id. at 532. On a notarized,\nwitnessed certificate, the federal voter had to submit a current address and\nattest to: (1) being a resident of Virginia, both at the time of submission and\nsince the date of voter registration, and (2) an intent not to move from the city\nor county of residence before the next general election. Id. Those voters who\nchose to pay federal and state poll taxes were only required to file the\ncertificate of residence one time; those who did not pay the federal poll tax had\nto file a new certificate of residence in the designated time frame before each\nelection year. Id.\n       Here, the State does not offer Texas voters a choice between paying a fee\nand undergoing an onerous procedural process. Cf. id. at 540–41. All voters\n\n\n\n       65 This is somewhat in tension with the Veasey Plaintiffs’ initial briefing before the\npanel, which claimed SB 14 was a poll tax based on the fee involved and conceded that\n“incidental burdens on voters are not taxes,” including “[i]ncidental costs such as paying for\ngas to drive to the polls.”\n                                             76\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 77   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nmust make a trip to the DPS, local registrar, county clerk, or other government\nagency at some point to receive qualifying photo identification. This record\nreveals that Plaintiffs and those who lack both SB 14 ID and underlying\ndocumentation face more difficulty than many Texas voters in obtaining SB 14\nID. Undoubtedly, those who own vehicles, have flexible work schedules, and\nalready possess the required documentation can more easily meet these\nprocedural requirements than some of the Plaintiffs and others who lack these\nresources. Plaintiffs and others similarly situated often struggle to gather the\nrequired documentation, make travel arrangements and obtain time off from\nwork to travel to the county clerk or local registrar, and then to the DPS, all to\nreceive an EIC. These greater difficulties receive consideration in the Section 2\ndiscriminatory effect analysis, but Supreme Court jurisprudence has not\nequated these difficulties, standing alone, to a poll tax. See, e.g., Harper, 383\nU.S. at 666. In Harman, the Court specifically noted:\n      [I]t is important to emphasize that the question presented is not\n      whether it would be within a State’s power to abolish entirely the\n      poll tax and require all voters—state and federal—to file annually\n      a certificate of residence. Rather, the issue here is whether the\n      State of Virginia may constitutionally confront the federal voter\n      with a requirement that he either pay the customary poll taxes as\n      required for state elections or file a certificate of residence.\n380 U.S. at 538; see also Crawford, 553 U.S. at 198–99 (contrasting the\nunconstitutionality of a requirement that voters “pay a tax or a fee to obtain a\nnew photo identification” with a requirement that voters without ID “travel to\nthe circuit court clerk’s office within 10 days [of the election] to execute the\nrequired affidavit”). Additionally, whether the qualifying identification is a\ndriver’s license, passport, or EIC, voters need not undergo this process every\nelection year during a specific time frame six months prior to the election, as\nwas the case in Harman. Instead, the record indicates that an EIC remains\n                                       77\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 78     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nvalid for six years and must only be obtained sometime before an election.\n       In light of the recently-enacted SB 983, SB 14 does not impose an\nunconstitutional      poll    tax   under     the    Fourteenth       or   Twenty-Fourth\nAmendments, nor did it impose a poll tax before SB 983’s enactment.\nAccordingly, we vacate the district court’s judgment for the Veasey Plaintiffs\non their poll tax claim and render judgment in the State’s favor.\n                                       V.

It would be untenable to permit a law\nwith a discriminatory effect to remain in operation for that election. 71 In fact,\nthe State has not asked us to permit the Legislature to reconsider SB 14 before\nthe courts fashion a remedy and, despite filing multiple briefs with this court\nin this case before and after the panel opinion, the State has never argued that\nwe must defer to the Legislature in the first instance. When counsel for the\nState was asked about this issue during oral argument before our full court,\ncounsel responded that so long as it was a “tailored, specific remedy,” he\n“believe[s] this court could fashion the remedy itself.” Upon further pressing\nby a member of the court, the State noted it also would be proper for the state\nlegislature to act first, but repeated that this court could enact a tailored\nremedy and did not advocate that this court could or should order the Texas\nGovernor to call a special session of the Legislature to craft a remedy to any\nSection 2 violation.\n       Because of the Supreme Court’s order and the impending election, we\nwould necessarily have to give only limited time for any legislative fix. Since\nthe legislature is not scheduled to be in session this year, doing so would\nrequire that the Texas Governor call a special session of the Legislature.\nAccordingly, although legislative intercession may occur, it may not be feasible,\nand we follow the Supreme Court’s guidance and permit the district court to\nenter an order that remedies SB 14’s discriminatory effects. See Wise, 437 U.S.\nat 540; see also Perez, 132 S. Ct. at 939–41.\n\n\n       71 As discussed above, the Supreme Court has also noted the time constraints of this\ncase in light of the scheduled elections in November of 2016. See Veasey v. Abbott, 136 S. Ct.\nat 1823.\n                                             82\n\f    Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 83   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n        In the event that the Governor calls a special session to address this\nissue or should a later Legislature again address the issue of voter\nidentification, any new law would present a new circumstance not addressed\nhere.    Such a new law may cure the deficiencies addressed in this opinion.\nNeither our ruling here nor any ruling of the district court on remand should\nprevent the Legislature from acting to ameliorate the issues raised in this\nopinion. Any concerns about a new bill would be the subject of a new appeal\nfor another day.\n        On remand, the district court should refer to the policies underlying SB\n14 in fashioning a remedy. We acknowledge that the record establishes that\nthe vast majority of eligible voters possess SB 14 ID, and we do not disturb SB\n14’s effect on those voters—those who have SB 14 ID must show it to vote. The\nremedy must be tailored to rectify only the discriminatory effect on those voters\nwho do not have SB 14 ID or are unable to reasonably obtain such\nidentification. See Frank II, 819 F.3d at 386 (rejecting that “because some\nvoters face undue difficulties in obtaining acceptable photo IDs, Wisconsin\ncould not require any voter to present a photo ID,” but accepting that “high\nhurdles for some persons” might “entitle those particular persons to relief”).\nBecause the parties had an opportunity to present the evidence they desired\nduring the initial district court proceedings, the district court’s determinations\nshould be based on the current record, supplemented only by legislative action,\nif any, that occurs after this remand and any oral argument permitted by the\ndistrict court.\n        Clearly, the Legislature wished to reduce the risk of in-person voter\nfraud by strengthening the forms of identification presented for voting. Simply\nreverting to the system in place before SB 14’s passage would not fully respect\nthese policy choices—it would allow voters to cast ballots after presenting less\n                                       83\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 84     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nsecure forms of identification like utility bills, bank statements, or paychecks.\nSee TEX. ELEC. CODE § 63.001(b) (West 2010). The panel opinion noted that\none possibility would be to reinstate voter registration cards as documents that\nqualify as acceptable identification under the Texas Election Code for those\nindividuals who do not have and cannot reasonably obtain SB 14 ID. 72 During\noral argument, counsel for the State suggested that an indigency exception,\nmodeled after the exception in Indiana’s voter ID law, would be sufficient to\ncure the discriminatory effect of SB 14. These are solutions the district court\nmay consider. Further, in fashioning a remedy, the district court should also\nconsider the necessity of educational and training efforts to ensure that both\nvoters and workers at polling places are capable of making use of whatever\nremedy the district court selects.\n       In light of the impending election, we order the district court to file its\norder regarding the proper discriminatory effect remedy as soon as possible.\nThe parties have expressed a willingness to work cooperatively with the\ndistrict court to provide a prompt resolution of this matter, and we urge them\nto do so to avoid election eve uncertainties and emergencies.\n                                     VI. Conclusion\nA. Discriminatory Purpose Claim\n       For the reasons stated above, we REVERSE the district court’s judgment\nthat SB 14 was passed with a racially discriminatory purpose and REMAND\nfor the district court to consider this claim in light of the guidance we have\nprovided in this opinion. As we have discussed, to avoid disruption of the\n\n\n\n       72  While the registration card does not contain a photo, it is a more secure document\nthan a bank statement or electric bill and, presumably, one not as easily obtained by another\nperson. It is sent in a nondiscriminatory fashion, free of charge, to each registered voter and\ntherefore avoids any cost issues.\n                                              84\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 85   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nupcoming election, the district court should first focus on fashioning interim\nrelief for the discriminatory effect violation in the months leading up to the\nNovember general election. The district court should then reevaluate the\nevidence relevant to discriminatory intent and determine anew whether the\nLegislature acted with a discriminatory intent in enacting SB 14. We\nencourage the district court to wait until after the November 2016 election to\nmake this new determination. However, whether the district court waits to\nmake its findings until after the November election or does so sooner, we\ninstruct that, in light of the limited time prior to the November 2016\nelection, the district court shall not implement any remedy arising from such\nreevaluation before this November’s election.\nB. Discriminatory Effect Claim\n      We AFFIRM the district court’s finding that SB 14 violates Section 2 of\nthe Voting Rights Act through its discriminatory effects and REMAND for\nconsideration of the appropriate remedy consistent with this opinion as soon\nas possible.    The district court must ensure that any remedy enacted\nameliorates SB 14’s discriminatory effect, while respecting the Legislature’s\nstated objective to safeguard the integrity of elections by requiring more secure\nforms of voter identification.\nC. Other Claims\n      We VACATE the district court’s holding that SB 14 is a poll tax under\nthe Fourteenth and Twenty-Fourth Amendments and RENDER judgment for\nthe State on this issue. We need not and do not address whether SB 14\nunconstitutionally burdens the right to vote under the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments; therefore, we VACATE the district court’s judgment on that\nissue and DISMISS those claims.\n\n\n                                       85\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530     Page: 86   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-41127\nD. Interim Relief\n      In sum, the district court’s immediate responsibility is to ensure the\nimplementation of an interim remedy for SB 14’s discriminatory effect that\ndisrupts voter identification rules for the 2016 election season as little as\npossible, yet eliminates the Section 2 discriminatory effect violation. The\ndistrict court will need to reexamine the discriminatory purpose claim in\naccordance with the proper legal standards we have described, bearing in mind\nthe effect any interim legislative action taken with respect to SB 14 may have.\nThe district court’s task in this respect may await the November 8, 2016\ngeneral election.\n\n\n\n\n                                      86\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 87     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nSTEPHEN A.

Though some of the\nfactors may have less relevance in vote-denial cases, others, particularly\n“Senate factors one, three, five, and nine,” aid in applying the Supreme Court’s\nadmonition to discern the relevant social and historical effects of\ndiscrimination, and their interaction with a challenged law.

Here, in sharp contrast, the district court heard such\nevidence and found, in its discussion of factor five, that the effects of past\ndiscrimination “have hindered the ability of African-Americans and Hispanics\nto effectively participate in the political process”; indeed, one expert “testified\nthat these minorities register and turnout for elections at rates that lag far\nbehind Anglo voters.” Veasey v.

Id. at 655–56; see also id.\nat 664–65. 4 The majority opinion rightly rejects Texas’s attempt to stretch\nClements to require that plaintiffs wait until elections have occurred under the\nchallenged law and then prove a direct impact on turnout. That would make\nimpossible pre-enforcement Section 2 challenges, which the Supreme Court\nrecently acknowledged. See Shelby County, 133 S. Ct. at 2619 (“[I]njunctive\nrelief is available in appropriate [Section 2] cases to block voting laws from\ngoing into effect.”).      And as multiple experts testified, given the myriad\nvariables at play, it is extremely difficult to isolate the effect of a new law on\nvoter turnout. 5 Texas’s argument that the plaintiffs were required to prove a\ndirect impact on turnout is unsound.\n\n\n       4  The dissent cites law review articles for the propositions that studies collected\ntherein show no effect from voter ID laws on turnout, or even show increased turnout. Those\ncollected studies, which mostly date from 2009 and earlier, did not involve SB 14 and do not\nmake the district court’s acceptance of expert testimony that Texas’s law likely will depress\nturnout clearly erroneous. In any event, scholarship on the effects of voter ID laws is far\nfrom uniform. See, e.g., Zoltan Hajnal, et al., Voter Identification Laws and the Suppression\nof          Minority          Votes,           at         15          (February         2016),\nhttp://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/page5/documents/voterIDhajnaletal.pdf         (“For    Latinos,\nBlacks, and multi-racial Americans there are strong signs that strict photo identification\nlaws decrease turnout.”); Bill Hobby, et al., The Texas Voter ID Law and the 2014 Election: A\nStudy     of    Texas’s   23rd     Congressional     District,    at    13   (August    2015),\nhttps://bakerinstitute.org/media/files/files/e0029eb8/Politics-VoterID-Jones-080615.pdf\n(concluding that Hispanic non-voters in one Texas congressional district “were significantly\nmore likely than Anglo non-voters to strongly agree or agree that a lack of photo ID was a\nreason that they did not cast a ballot in the 2014 general election”); Michael D.

In that case, Judge Easterbrook—who\ndid not mention the applicable clear-error standard of review—overlooked\nmany of the district court’s factual findings. See Frank v.

Questioning other circuits’\napproaches to vote-denial cases without offering a clear alternative, Judge\nEasterbrook went on to uphold a different voter ID law on the rationales that\nthe law did not facially “draw any line by race,” and that the plaintiffs had not\n“show[n] a ‘denial’ of anything by Wisconsin, as § 2(a) requires” because the\nstate had not directly caused minorities to be less likely or able to own\nqualifying IDs. Frank, 768 F.3d at 753. Ultimately, the Seventh Circuit read\nSection 2 as only “an equal-treatment requirement,” and rejected the plaintiffs’\nchallenge “because in Wisconsin everyone has the same opportunity to get a\nqualifying photo ID.” Id. at 754, 755.\n      This reasoning ignores that Section 2 prohibits voting procedures\n“imposed or applied . . . in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement\n                                         94\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 95   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nof the right . . . to vote.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a) (emphasis added). Indeed, the\nopinion does not mention “abridgement” aside from a single quotation of the\nstatute.   Judge Easterbrook’s “equal-treatment” gloss—which he did not\nexplain aside from saying that is “how [the statute] reads,” Frank, 768 F.3d at\n754—is puzzling because it is undisputed that, in response to a judicial ruling\nthat Section 2 plaintiffs had to prove discriminatory intent, Congress revised\nthe statute “to make clear that a violation could be proved by showing\ndiscriminatory effect alone,” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 35; cf.

And if Section 2 requires only equal treatment, or if a Section\n2 burden is cognizable only if it is impossible for some minority voters to comply\nwith the challenged law, Justice Scalia must have mistakenly stated that\nSection 2 would be violated if “a county permitted voter registration for only\nthree hours one day a week, and that made it more difficult for blacks to\nregister than whites.” Chisom, 501 U.S. at 408 (Scalia J., dissenting). After\nall, ignoring disparities due to past discrimination, that law would give\neveryone the “same opportunity” to register.\n      Judge Easterbrook further seems to have reasoned that the only\ndiscrimination relevant to Section 2’s totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry is\nof the state-sponsored variety. See Frank, 768 F.3d at 753. The dissent agrees,\nadding that the official discrimination must be “contemporary” or at least\n“recent.” I have difficulty squaring that with Section 2’s directive to address\nthe “totality of circumstances,” and with the Supreme Court’s admonitions to\nprobe the interaction of the challenged practice “with social and historical\nconditions” as well as consider “the extent to which minority group members\nbear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment,\n                                       95\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 96     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nand health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political\nprocess.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47, 45.

Ct. at 2523; cf. id. at\n2524 (opining that a Fair Housing Act plaintiff might not be able to show “a causal connection\nbetween the Department’s policy and a disparate impact” if, “for instance . . . federal law\nsubstantially limits the Department’s discretion”).\n                                              96\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 97   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\npeople to register by checking a box when they get drivers’ licenses, would be\ninvalid, because black and Latino citizens are less likely to own cars and\ntherefore less likely to get drivers’ licenses.” Id. The dissent advances a\nsimilar point, warning that voting regulations ranging from polling locations,\nearly voting details, and registration times “can be challenged successfully\nunder the majority’s rationale.”    I agree that Section 2 challenges can be\nbrought against a variety of election laws—but that is nothing new.

Nor does it imperil our electoral system.\n      There is a difference between making voting harder in ways that interact\nwith historical and social conditions to disproportionately burden minorities\nand making voting easier in ways that may not benefit all demographics\nequally (like motor-voter).

States have reacted to the\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Crawford and Shelby County by introducing a\nrange of voting regulations that go beyond what had previously been upheld.\nIt is healthy for these initiatives to be assessed against congressional\nmandates, and courts can and should distinguish between nondiscriminatory\nones which safeguard voter integrity and those which, whatever their\nintentions, interact with the effects of past discrimination to abridge\nminorities’ opportunities to participate in the political process. Such scrutiny\nshould be seen not as heavy-handed judicial rejection of legislative priorities,\nbut as part of a process of harmonizing those priorities with the fundamental\nright to vote—a topic with which over a quarter of our Constitution’s\namendments have dealt in one way or another, and an individual right that\ncannot be compromised because an adverse impact falls on relatively few\nrather than many.

The\nmajority, however, today holds not only that Texas’s photo voter ID law, SB 14,\nviolates the “results test” declared in Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 2 but\nconcludes that there is “more than a scintilla” of evidence to support a finding\nthat the Texas Legislature passed the photo voter ID law with a racially\ndiscriminatory intent. By keeping this latter claim alive, the majority fans the\nflames of perniciously irresponsible racial name-calling. 3\n\n\n\n       1We join only Part IV of the majority opinion that renders judgment in favor of the\nState on the Plaintiffs’ poll tax claim.\n\n       2  This holding invalidates the law for that small subgroup of the subgroup of 4.5% of\nTexas registered voters, those who allegedly lack not only the law’s approved ID (drivers\nlicenses, veterans ID, etc.) but also lack the documentation (birth certificates) necessary to\nobtain a free Election Identity Card (“EIC”) and are inconvenienced by obtaining the\ndocumentation and the EIC. As I shall demonstrate, the majority offers a gravely incorrect\ninterpretation of Section 2.\n\n       3 Section 2 was amended to add the results test, footing liability on less than\nintentional conduct, in part to defuse controversy over charges of purposeful discrimination.\nSee Thornburg v.

Because of definitive Supreme Court authority, no comparable\nfederal court precedent in over forty years has found a state legislative act\nmotivated by purposeful racial discrimination. Even more telling, the multi-\nthousand page record yields not a trace, much less a legitimate inference, of\nracial bias by the Texas Legislature. Indeed, why would a racially biased\nlegislature have provided for a cost-free election ID card to assist poor\nregistered voters—of all races—who might not have drivers’ licenses? Yet the\nmajority emulates the clever capacity of Area 51 alien enthusiasts who, lacking\nany real evidence, espied a vast but clandestine government conspiracy to\nconceal the “truth.” 4\n\n\n                     (L)itigators representing excluded minorities will have to\n             explore motivations of individual council members, mayors, and other\n             citizens.

Background\n       Three points must be highlighted at the outset, with further discussion\nto follow: the true extent of the legislative process leading to passage of a photo\nvoter ID law; the catalytic effect of the Supreme Court’s decision approving\nthese IDs; and the impact of the law’s requirements on all races.\n       First, SB 14 was enacted in the 2011 biennial legislative session after\nsimilar bills requiring photo voter ID had failed in three previous sessions. For\nsix years, opponents had successfully stalled measures requiring proof of a\nvoter’s identity, not just a piece of paper from the County Registrar’s office or\na mere affidavit of “lost voter certificate.” For every shortcut the majority\nemployed to finally pass SB 14, an equal and opposite blocking tactic had\nsucceeded in earlier legislative sessions.\n       Second, the campaign for stronger voter ID laws was encouraged by\nCrawford v. Marion County Election Board, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145813\"><a href=\"/opinion/145813/crawford-v-marion-county-election-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145813\"><a href=\"/opinion/145813/crawford-v-marion-county-election-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Justice Stevens’s\n\n\n\nArea 51 conspiracy theories). Circumstantial evidence—equally probative as that relied on\nby the majority—is at odds with calling SB 14 intentionally discriminatory. Lamenting the\nlack of Latino voter turnout in Texas elections, Gilberto Hinojosa, the Texas Democratic\nChairman, was recently quoted in a news article: “Voter ID is a problem. It is. But that’s\nfixable. . . . That’s not stopping that 1 million from going out to vote . . . .” Peggy Fikac, Texas\nDemocratic Chair: It’s ‘Ridiculous’ His Party Isn’t Winning, SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS NEWS\n(June 16, 2016), http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Texas-Democratic-chair-\nIt-s-ridiculous-8261873.php.\n                                               103\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 104   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nopinion rejected the claim that Indiana had to advance “proof” of actual in-\nperson voter fraud in order to justify the statute. Fourteen states passed photo\nvoter ID laws in the wake of Crawford.\n      Third, the range of qualifying SB 14 IDs, while narrower than that in\nsome similar ID laws, poses no obstacle to voting for at least 95.5% of all Texas\nvoters who have unexpired (or no later than 60 days past expiry) driver’s\nlicenses, Texas personal identification cards, military IDs with a photo, United\nStates passports, United States citizenship certificates with a photo, or\nlicenses to carry a handgun. For those who lack such IDs, the law offers a cost-\nfree Election Identification Card (“EIC”) obtainable at state DMV offices (like\nthe free card available in Indiana). Photo voter IDs are not required for elderly\nand disabled voters, as they may vote with mail-in ballots.\n      At trial, the alleged adverse racial impact of SB 14 was derived from\nstatistical estimates of the relative numbers of Anglo, Black, and Hispanic\nvoters who “do not possess SB14-compliant IDs.” That is to say, of the 4.5%\nwho may lack qualifying IDs, a disproportionate number are Black and\nHispanic voters. Still, approximately the same number of Anglo registered\nvoters (approx. 296,000) as the total of Black (approx. 128,000) and Hispanic\n(approx. 175,000) voters lack the requisite IDs. Put otherwise, approximately\n2% of Anglo, 5.9% of Hispanic and 8.1% of Black voters comprise the 4.5% who\nlack SB 14 IDs but could vote with EICs; the law poses no obstacle for over 90%\nof minority voters.\n      Despite extraordinary efforts to find voters “disenfranchised” by SB 14,\nthe DOJ could not uncover any, and no representative of the plaintiff\norganizations found any of their members unable to vote because of SB 14.\nThree plaintiffs claimed they could not vote in person under SB 14, but two of\nthose qualified for ballots by mail. The plaintiffs’ case thus turned on the\n                                      104\n\f      Case: 14-41127   Document: 00513601530     Page: 105   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nextent to which it could be estimated that those who do not possess SB 14 IDs\nwould find it difficult to acquire EICs.       It was assumed that the 4.5%\noverwhelmingly include the poor (of all races). There was expert testimony,\nunsupported by any hard data, that “the poor” are less likely to have actual or\ncertified copies of birth certificates, the principal document required for an\nEIC. Obtaining birth certificates was testified to be challenging for the poor,\nespecially those who had moved from their original birthplaces, but no\nestimates of this class’s mobility were offered. Finally, even if the poor had\nbirth certificates or obtained them, the district court found that travelling to\nDMV offices to procure EICs could be time-consuming, burdensome and\ninterfere with hourly work schedules.\nII.     The Majority’s Erroneous Discussion of Discriminatory Intent\n        SB 14 is a facially neutral law of general applicability, whose photo ID\nrequirement poses no obstacle to the overwhelming majority of registered\nTexas voters.     The law has a racially disparate impact upon a subset of\nminority voters. But there is “no smoking gun,” not even code words that\nsuggest discriminatory intent in the thousands of pages of legislative\ndocuments and deposition transcripts that the district court compelled the\nstate to produce. The majority entirely ignores the total absence of direct\nevidence and, moreover, has to exclude (by force of precedent) the evidence\nmost heavily relied on by the district court. Still, the majority finds “more than\na scintilla of evidence” that could allow the district court on remand to condemn\nthe law as, at least in part, racially motivated. I fully agree with Judge\nClement’s application of the Arlington Heights factors and will not repeat the\ndiscussion in her separate dissent. My additional disagreements are two-fold.\nFirst, the majority fails to follow the totality of Supreme Court precedents\n\n\n                                       105\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 106     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\npertaining to the interpretation of legislative intent. 5 Second, the majority\nbutchers, when it does not ignore, the relevant facts.\n       A. Applicable Legal Principles\n       “[O]fficial action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it\nresults in a racially disproportionate impact . . . . Proof of racially\ndiscriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause.” Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264–65, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is shared ground, as it is\nthat Arlington Heights sets out certain factors that may be relevant to proving\nthe intent of the legislature.\n       Arlington Heights’s discourse on proving discriminatory legislative\nintent does not exist in a vacuum. There, the Court upheld a zoning board\ndecision that prevented the construction of a low-income housing project in a\nChicago suburb. The facially neutral zoning order had a discriminatory impact\non minorities who were more likely to inhabit the project. The Court attempted\nto catalog how a legislative decision, and the steps leading to it, might display\nan impermissible motive. Notably, in each case cited to exemplify its listed\nfactors, discriminatory motive could be easily inferred. A county closed public\n(heavily minority) schools while private segregated schools received financial\nsupport. 6 A state constitutional amendment was passed to overturn laws that\n\n\n\n       5    The majority also erroneously equates finding legislative intent with finding\ndiscrimination in employment cases. The intent of the legislature is a pastiche of each\nindividual representative’s views, mixed policies and motives. An employer, in contrast, is\nheld to have a single motive and policy. A facile equation of these two situations elides the\ndifficulty in legislative cases, which the Supreme Court plumbed in cases described above.\n\n       6 Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous.

In other\nwords, exogenous effects of past discrimination cannot be used to impute a\ncontemporary discriminatory purpose.\n      Second, the Court held, discriminatory purpose:\n      implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of\n      consequences . . . . It implies that the decisionmaker . . . selected\n      or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because\n      of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable\n      group.    Yet nothing in the record demonstrated that this\n      preference for veterans was originally devised or subsequently re-\n      enacted because it would accomplish the collateral goal of keeping\n      women in a stereotypic and predefined place in the Massachusetts\n      Civil Service.\n\n\nId. at 279. Thus, as in Arlington Heights, an absence of direct evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent should be compelling.\n      Third, the Court rejected the plaintiffs’ complaint that the law was\nexcessively broad, unfair, and controversial with a firm reminder that “the\nFourteenth Amendment ‘cannot be made a refuge from ill-advised laws.’” Id.\nat 281 (internal citation omitted).     That a law might have been written\ndifferently with respect to impact does not condemn it under the Equal\nProtection Clause.\n\n\n\n\n                                       109\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 110     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\n       In a footnote, the Court acknowledged the possibility that a strong\ninference of discrimination could perhaps be drawn from a stark sex-based\nimpact, but the Court cautioned that\n       [i]n this inquiry—made as it is under the Constitution—an\n       inference is a working tool, not a synonym for proof. When, as\n       here, the impact is essentially an unavoidable consequence of a\n       legislative policy that has in itself always been deemed to be\n       legitimate, and when, as here, the statutory history and all of the\n       available evidence affirmatively demonstrate the opposite, the\n       inference simply fails to ripen into proof.\n\n\nId. at 279 n.25. Inferences cannot substitute for proof where the available\nevidence demonstrates no invidious intent.\n       The case before us falls comfortably in line with Arlington Heights,\nWashington v. Davis, and Feeney. 11 First, the facially neutral laws in each of\nthose cases worked a far more dramatic disparate impact on minorities than\ndoes SB 14’s specification of qualifying photo voter IDs. SB 14, after all, has\nno disparate impact on over 90% of all registered Black and Hispanic voters.\nSecond, as in the Supreme Court cases, SB 14 has legitimate noninvidious\npurposes: ensuring the integrity of in-person balloting and public confidence\nin election outcomes. Third, as in Washington v. Davis, where surrounding\ncircumstances confirmed an absence of discriminatory intent, 426 U.S. at 246–\n47, 96 S. Ct. at 2051, SB 14 authorized an EIC for all voters without drivers’\nlicenses, presumably the poor, to satisfy the photo ID requirement. Fourth, as\nin Feeney, not only minority voters but an equal number of Anglo voters are\n\n\n\n       11 It is true that the primary holdings in Washington v. Davis and Feeney worked out\nthe relationship between disparate impact and the Equal Protection clause, but in each case,\nto uphold the law in question, the Court necessarily had to find no purposeful discrimination\nby the legislature. This discussion reflects that aspect of the decisions.\n\n                                            110\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 111     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nwithin the 4.5% who do not have qualifying IDs. Fifth, in not one of those cases\ndid the Court require “proof” that the challenged statute was effective or the\nbest choice to achieve the legislative objective.          Instead, the Court in Feeney\nadmonished that the Fourteenth Amendment is not a “refuge from ill-\nadvised . . . laws.” 442 U.S. at 281, 99 S.

The presence\nof preclearance under Section 5 in some jurisdictions does not explain why there are no\nfindings of purposeful discrimination by a state legislature either outside the jurisdictions\ncovered by preclearance or beyond the subject of voting regulations. Washington v. Davis,\nFeeney, and Arlington Heights all rejected discrimination claims not arising from voting\nrights. Like the majority, Judge Costa continues to fear de jure discrimination by states fifty\nyears after passage of the major federal civil rights laws in this country.\n\n                                             111\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 112      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\neffects of discrimination and “long ago” legislative actions, and by authorizing\na string of inferences to become a “synonym for proof” contrary to Feeney. See\nid. at 279 n.25.\n       But even if there were merit in the majority’s inadequate reading of the\nSupreme Court’s decisions, the “proof” adduced in support of the majority\nopinion is nonexistent. 13 We move on to address the errors and omissions\ncommitted in the majority’s analysis of the record.\n       B. Record Analysis\n       The following section tracks each of the alleged “facts” from which the\nmajority opinion draws inferences of discriminatory intent.\n       1. “the record does not contain direct evidence . . . .”\n\n\n       As the majority acknowledges, the record is barren of any “direct\nevidence that the Texas Legislature passed SB 14 with a racially invidious\n\n\n       13  Judge Costa’s separate opinion requires special comment to the extent it admits a\n“different starting point” for assessing a discriminatory purpose claim. In plain English, he\nargues a theory never litigated in this case, unsupported by any evidence, at odds with the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Feeney, and unsupported by the only cases he relies on. After\nhis lament about the duration of the instant litigation, there is no justification for bringing\nup points that are unpreserved, not briefed, and therefore not entitled to consideration on\nremand. Judge Costa’s theory is that political partisanship can be tantamount to a proxy for\ndiscriminatory intent. That is not what the Court held in Feeney: “‘Discriminatory\npurpose’ . . . implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.”\n442 U.S. at 279, 99 S. Ct. at 2296. The decisionmaker must have acted in part “because of,”\nnot merely “in spite of” the adverse effects of the legislation. Id. Judge Costa points to no\nevidence indicating such a discriminatory purpose to “suppress votes”, as opposed to ensuring\nthe voters’ identity. Further, in the single case he relies on (and only the concurring opinion,\nat that), the district court found direct evidence of purposeful discrimination as well as\npartisanship. Garza v.

Indeed,\nlegislators, their staff, and even the Lt. Governor produced thousands of\ndocuments, including office files, bill books, personal correspondence\nconcerning SB14, access to personal and official email accounts, and e-mail\ncommunications between legislators and lawyers at the Texas Legislative\nCouncil. 15     Additionally, the plaintiffs took weeks of seven-hour-long\n\n\n       14 In Arlington Heights, the Supreme Court cautioned that “judicial inquiries into\nlegislative or executive motivation represent a substantial intrusion into the workings of\nother branches of government” and that “[p]lacing a decisionmaker on the stand is therefore\n‘usually to be avoided.’” 429 U.S. at 268 n.18, 97 S.

Dewhurst’s General Counsel,\n         on talking points to senators, with implication these could be\n         construed as masks for racist motives\n\n\n      To the majority, “[t]here is evidence that the proponents of SB 14 were\ncareful about what they said and wrote about the purposes of SB 14, knowing\nit would be challenged during the preclearance process under the Voting\nRights Act.”   For this proposition, they highlight a statement by Senator\nFraser, one of SB 14’s authors, who testified that “the public legislative record\nwould either go to the Department of Justice or a three-judge panel as a part\nof the [Voting Rights Act] Section 5 review process.” Because Senator Fraser\nwas “aware that everything that [he] was saying was part of a public record,”\nthe majority imply, it is unsurprising that no direct evidence of discrimination\nwas found in the unprecedented legislative discovery.\n      The district court did not rely on Fraser’s statements to explain away the\nlack of a “smoking gun” in the legislative record or discovery.

At most, his testimony reflects\nsimple and uncontroversial facts.\n      Senator Fraser’s deposition excerpts were read into the record by the\nState during the Veasey trial. The majority opinion quotes from the plaintiff’s\n“cross-examination” portion. When asked if it was his belief “that the public\nlegislative record would either go to the Department of Justice or a three-judge\npanel as part of the Section 5 review process,” Senator Fraser testified that he\n“did believe it would go one of those two places.”    Senator Fraser was then\nasked if this made him consider “what sort of statements [he] made on the\nSenate Floor?” Senator Fraser did not respond that he was especially careful\nin his floor statements about SB 14 or anything even close to that. Instead, he\n\n                                      116\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530    Page: 117   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\nsimply responded that he “was aware that everything [he] was saying was part\nof the public record.”\n      Senator Fraser’s testimony does not support the inference that SB 14\nproponents were unusually careful about what they wrote and said.\nSenator Fraser’s awareness that the public legislative record would be\nscrutinized by the Justice Department or a three-judge court under the\npreclearance process is a statement of fact. Between 1975 and 2013, any\nchange in Texas voting procedures had to be “approved by federal authorities\nin Washington, D.C.—either the Attorney General or a court of three judges.”\nShelby Cty. v.

The legislative\nrecord is a matter of public record under the Texas Constitution. See TEX.\nCONST. art. III, § 12(a). The Texas Senate Staff Services office makes the audio\nrecordings of all Senate Floor proceedings available to the public free of charge.\n      Most importantly, however, the facts conveyed by Senator Fraser are not\nprobative about why the unprecedented discovery into the private\ncorrespondence and documents of SB 14 proponents turned up no evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent. Senator Fraser’s testimony deals with public records\nand floor statements. It says nothing about why SB 14 proponents would have\ncensored themselves privately. Based on Arlington Heights, no one could have\npredicted a federal court would order such unprecedented discovery from\nSenator Fraser or the Legislature.\n      The majority also emphasizes a piece of deposition testimony by Bryan\nHebert, the deputy general counsel for the Lt. Governor, that he sent an email\nreminding senators to emphasize the “detection and deterrence of fraud and\nprotecting public confidence in elections as the goal of SB 14.”\n                                        117\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 118   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n      Once again, the district court did not rely on this statement of\nMr. Hebert.

Hebert’s statement\nwas made in an email sent to various Senate staffers laying out plans for the\nfloor debate on SB 14.         He characterized it as “an attempt to—at\nbest . . . outline . . . how things might go.”    Stressing the detection and\ndeterrence of fraud and promoting public confidence in elections was listed as\na “floor task” because, as Hebert understood it, “that was the goal of the bill.”\n      Hebert’s statement is not probative of why there would be no evidence\nturned up in the private legislative discovery. Hebert’s statement merely urges\nthe use of talking points in Senate Floor speeches. Politicians emphasize and\nreemphasize talking points because they are effective, not because they are\nseeking to cover up ulterior motives. See Citizens United v.

Hebert’s statement offers\nno support for the proposition that the plaintiffs’ failure to uncover evidence of\ndiscrimination can be ascribed to a cover-up by SB 14 proponents.\n      3. Legislators were “aware” of racial disparate impact\n\n\n      The majority opinion also contends that SB 14 proponents were aware of\nthe disproportionate impact it would have on minority voters. The majority\nrelies on three statements.     First, in his deposition, Representative Todd\nSmith, a proponent of SB 14 in the Texas House of Representatives, was asked\nif he recalled the conclusions of studies he read about the effect of voter ID laws\non minorities. Smith testified that he did not recall the conclusions, but that\n“there’s a study for every conclusion that you want to reach.” Smith then more\nor less volunteered that, in his opinion, it was “common sense” that “the people\n\n\n                                       118\n\f   Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530         Page: 119    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-41127\nthat do not have photo IDs [are] more likely to be minority.” 18 Second, Hebert\ntestified that it was “possible” that an indigency affidavit provision would have\nreduced the burden on poor voters and that he suspected, but did not know,\nthat poor voters were disproportionately minority.            Contemporaneous with\nSB 14’s passage, Hebert prepared a memo for other Senate staffers in which\nhe opined that it was doubtful that SB 14 would be precleared by the Justice\nDepartment without additional IDs.              His memo is entirely an opinion\npredicated on a comparison of SB 14 to a Georgia voter ID law that obtained\npreclearance.     It provides only some support for the proposition that the\ndisparate impact of SB 14 was known among legislative staffers. Unmentioned\nby the majority (or the district court) is Hebert’s further opinion that though\nhe was “unclear” how a three-judge court might rule, they “might be more\nfavorable” to preclearing the law. 19\n      These three statements were the universe relied upon by the district\ncourt for the proposition that it was “clear that the legislature knew that\nminorities would be most affected by the voter ID law.” Veasey v. Perry,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 657–58.\n      The majority opinion uses the “common sense” opinion of a member of\nthe Texas House of Representatives and the “suspicions” of the Lt. Governor’s\ndeputy general counsel to leap to the conclusion that “the drafters and\nproponents of SB 14 were aware of the likely disproportionate effect of the law\non minorities.” Even if these statements were enough to imply knowledge on\n\n\n\n      18  Representative Smith’s “common sense” was only partially accurate because nearly\nhalf of those lacking SB 14 ID are White.\n\n      19     The majority wisely does not rely—as the district court did—on the fleeting\nstatement of Senator Rodney Ellis, an SB 14 opponent, who speculated that “[i]n my mind, I\nthink . . . they knew the bill had a disparate impact.”\n                                          119\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 120   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nthe part of the entire Texas Legislature, however, awareness of the disparate\nimpact of a law does not prove a legislature’s intent to discriminate.

Senator Fraser believes the Voting Rights Act has outlived its useful\n         life; Senator Fraser “not advised” about possible disparate impact;\n         Proponents have “largely refused to explain the rejection of\n         ‘ameliorative’ amendments,” an attitude that was “out of character for\n         sponsors of major bills”\n\n\n      Senator Fraser indeed testified at his deposition that he believed the\nVoting Rights Act had “outlived its useful life”; the district court did not rely\non this statement, and with good reason, too, since it has no probative value.\nNowhere in his deposition did Senator Fraser state that SB 14 sought to defy\nthe Voting Rights Act because of the law’s perceived obsolescence. And it is\nodd to hold up his personal opinion of the Act’s obsolescence for an inference of\npurposeful discrimination when it is, in part, shared by a majority of the\nSupreme Court. See Shelby Cty., 133 S. Ct. at 2628.\n      Evidence that Senator Fraser answered questions about SB 14’s\ndisparate impact with “I am not advised” is also not probative of discriminatory\nintent. Senator Fraser was asked on the Senate floor if the “elimination of\ngovernment documents as a form of ID [will] disproportionately affect African\nAmericans and Hispanics?” He responded, “I am not advised,” but he also\ntestified that such an answer merely indicates that the speaker does “not have\nsufficient information to answer [the] question.”\n      The district court relied on a statement from the bill’s opponent,\nSenator Ellis, that answering “I am not advised” was “out of character” for the\nsponsor of a major bill, which indicated to him that Senator Fraser “drew the\n\n                                      120\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 121   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nstraw.” See Veasey v.

It is frankly difficult to tell\nwhat Senator Ellis meant by the comment that Senator Fraser drew the straw.\nBut in no way does Senator Ellis imply that Senator Fraser acted with\ndiscriminatory intent.    Just the opposite, in fact.    Senator Ellis refers to\nSenator Fraser as his “friend.”      Senator Ellis acknowledges that Senator\nFraser stated on the Senate Floor that he did not intend SB 14 to have a\ndisparate impact, and Senator Ellis himself said on the Senate Floor that he\ndid not believe Senator Fraser intended SB 14 to have a disparate impact.\n      The majority states that “[a]nother senator [then-Senator Dan Patrick]\nadmitted at his deposition that he and other proponents of SB 14 voted to table\nnumerous amendments meant to expand the types of accepted IDs, expand the\noperating hours of DPS stations issuing voter IDs, delay implementation of\nSB 14 until an impact study had been completed, and other ameliorative\nmeasures.” This is a fact; there is no doubt that a number of amendments were\nrejected and that the bill’s opponents generally felt that these rejections were\ninadequately explained. See id. at 646–47. But it is incorrect to connect the\nrejection of amendments with Senator Ellis’s “out of character for major bills”\ncomment. Senator Ellis’s comment referred only to Senator Fraser’s “I am not\nadvised” answers.\n      5. Dr. Vernon Burton ties excuse of preventing voter fraud to “Texas’s\n         history of racial voter suppression”\n\n\n      The majority notes that Dr. Vernon Burton ties the excuse of preventing\nvoter fraud to Texas’s history of racial voter suppression. In both his expert\nreport and testimony, he specifically focused on: (1) all-White primaries;\n(2) secret ballots; (3) poll taxes; and (4) re-registration and voter purges. In\neach instance, the majority notes, Burton testified that the laws’ stated\n\n                                       121\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 122     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nrationale was to prevent voter fraud. From this, the majority contends it would\nbe possible to infer the Texas Legislature’s alleged discriminatory intent in\nenacting SB 14 half a century later because the stated rationale was also the\nprevention of voter fraud.\n       This recitation stands at odds with the rest of the majority’s opinion,\nwhich expressly disavows the district court’s reliance on “Texas’s use of all-\n[W]hite primaries from 1895–1944, literacy tests and secret ballots from 1905–\n1970, and poll taxes from 1902–1966” because “the district court relied too\nheavily on the evidence of State-sponsored discrimination dating back\nhundreds of years.” As for the re-registration and voter purges, Dr. Burton’s\nexpert report and testimony indicate these refer to the Texas Legislature’s\npassing a re-registration law in 1966 that was found unconstitutional in 1971 20\nand to a voter purge law enacted in 1975 that was denied preclearance and\nimmediately enjoined—41 years ago. 21 It flies in the face of the majority’s\nconclusion that “the district court’s disproportionate reliance on long-ago\nhistory was error,” to now smuggle in the very same “decades-old data and\neradicated practices” in support of a finding of intentional discrimination.\nShelby Cty., 133 S.

The majority\nexpressly condemns the district court because it “mistakenly relied in part on\nspeculation by the bill’s opponents about proponents’ motives,” yet it condones\nprecisely such speculation here. Sadly, neither the majority nor the district\ncourt tells the entire legislative saga as contained in the record.\n      Most of the district court’s pre-2011 legislative history citations are to\npublic websites that show only the results of votes, not to the record or expert\nreports that chronicle the drama behind those results. See, e.g., id. at 645–46\nnn.71–77.    The entire story appears from expert reports offered for the\nplaintiffs   (Drs.    Lichtman   and    Davidson)     and    the   testimony    of\nLt. Gov. Dewhurst, which are necessary to understand the 2011 actions taken\nby the Legislature.\n      First, a bit of background in how the Texas Senate considers legislation\nis necessary. At the start of the session, the Senate adopts by majority vote\nrules that will govern its business during the session. These rules are usually\nrolled over from the prior session and then tweaked accordingly. One rule that\nhas been consistently adopted since World War II is the “two-thirds rule.”\nUnder ordinary rules, the Senate can only consider legislation in the order in\nwhich it appears on the calendar. However, two-thirds of senators present and\n\n                                       123\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 124   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nvoting may vote to suspend the usual order of business and consider other\nbusiness out of turn. In practice, there is basically a two-thirds requirement\nto consider bills in the Texas Senate, analogous to the cloture rule in the U.S.\nSenate. This occurs because of “blocker bills.” A blocker bill is a routine or\nnon-controversial bill, such as one dealing with landscaping at the Capitol or\nthe decorations in the Senate Chamber, that is placed first on the agenda. It\nis intentionally almost never passed.       To get around the blocker bill and\nconsider legislation following it on the agenda, a two-thirds vote is required to\nsuspend the usual order of business. After receiving the required two-thirds\nvote, the legislation can be passed by a majority vote. In a chamber with\n31 senators, 11 can block under the two-thirds rule. As will be discussed, there\nare various ways around the two-thirds rule, many of which are commonly\nemployed.\n      Beginning before the 2005 session of the Texas Legislature, opinion polls\nshowed that a large majority of Texans supported photo voter ID laws.\nFurther, Texas officials believed that some Texans simply did not vote because\nthey did not have confidence in the system or that their votes would matter.\nTo address these related concerns, proponents of a voter ID law began to\nnegotiate with opponents—almost uniformly Democrats—about a compromise\nbill that could pass both houses and become law in accordance with the\noverwhelming public opinion of the citizenry in Texas. Despite voicing private\nsupport for a bill, adding language they believed would address some of their\nconcerns, and general efforts on the part of proponents to compromise,\nopponents remained intransigent. They even voiced private concerns that they\nwere “upside down” in their opposition despite strong public support for a bill,\nbut held out because they feared primary opponents if they voted in favor of a\nvoter ID bill.\n                                      124\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530           Page: 125      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                         No. 14-41127\n       Against this backdrop, the Legislature proposed the first iteration of a\nvoter ID bill in 2005. The majority ignores it, and the district court says only\nthat “[t]he bill, after being reported out of the Elections Committee, passed the\nHouse but died in the Senate Committee on State Affairs.” Id. at 645. What\nactually happened is that after the bill passed the Texas House, proponents in\nthe Senate attached it to another elections bill in order to avoid the two-thirds\nrule in the Senate, which is a common legislative maneuver on related bills.\nSenator Rodney Ellis vowed to filibuster the combined bill, and even came to\nthe Senate Chamber wearing tennis shoes and a catheter to comply with\nSenate prohibitions against sitting and restroom breaks during floor speeches.\nBefore his filibuster could begin, however, opposition Senator Leticia Van de\nPutte invoked a germaneness rule and the combined bill was withdrawn. The\nvoter ID bill was then sent to a House-Senate conference committee, but it was\ndelayed behind several other important measures and could not be considered\nbefore the end of the session.\n       Voter ID was reintroduced in the 2007 legislative session and passed the\nTexas House. Regarding the Senate, the majority says nothing and the district\ncourt says only that it was reported out of committee and “[w]hile the rules\nwere initially suspended to take it up out of order for second reading, the vote\nwas reconsidered and the measure failed. The rules were not suspended, at\nwhich point the bill died.” Id. at 646. 22 The true story is far more enthralling\nthan the district court’s sterile recitation.\n       Eleven opponents of the bill—all Democrats—had pledged going into the\nsession, as was their legislative prerogative, to block any voter ID bill under\n\n\n       22 The “rules . . . initially suspended” that the district court refers to is the two-thirds\nrule; thus, “suspending the rules” refers to getting two-thirds to move a bill past a blocker\nbill, which would be considered first under ordinary rules.\n                                               125\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 126   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nthe two-thirds rule even though Lt. Governor Dewhurst had attempted to\nreach a compromise with them before the session on the substance of the bill.\nHowever, opposition Senator Mario Gallegos was having complications from a\nliver transplant, which meant that Democrat opponents lacked the votes to\nblock the bill in his absence.    Against the advice of his doctors, Gallegos\nreturned to Austin for the session specifically so he could vote against the voter\nID bill. Senator Bob Deuell, a Republican and proponent of the bill, paid to\nhave a medical supply company put a hospital bed in a room adjacent to the\nSenate chamber for Gallegos. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, also a Republican,\nagreed to give Gallegos 24-hour notice before any vote on the voter ID bill\nwould occur.\n      Meanwhile, Democrat Senator Carlos Uresti became bedridden with the\nflu during the session. He was absent from the floor on May 15, 2007, when\nSenator Fraser, the voter ID bill’s sponsor, moved to suspend the regular order\nof business to consider the bill, which required the two-thirds vote. Dewhurst\ntestified that it is a “fairly common legislative practice” to “try and move your\nbill when you have the votes on the floor” and that it happens at least monthly\nin every legislative session. The opponents could not block the bill and it\npassed, with Senator Gallegos voting against it, 19-9 (just one more than two-\nthirds).    Democrat Senator Whitmire was also not on the floor, and\nLt. Governor Dewhurst called on him numerous times before skipping him in\nthe vote.   Meanwhile, Senator Uresti, alerted about the vote by another\nsenator, hastily returned to the Senate chambers as the vote was occurring,\nbut initially missed it.\n      After the vote had been held and the gavel fell, Democrat Senator\nShapleigh moved to verify the vote on the grounds that Senator Whitmire had\nactually been present for the vote and was improperly skipped. Lt. Governor\n                                       126\n\f   Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530      Page: 127   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nDewhurst testified that he accommodated the request because he knew “that\nthis [was] an important bill to the Democrats and to the Republicans,” and he\n“didn’t want controversy.”       He “bent over backwards to respect [Senator\nWhitmire] and his statement” that he was actually on the floor, so a\nverification (i.e. second) vote was held. This allowed all 11 opposition senators\nto vote against it, with Senator Uresti sprinting up the Capitol steps to reach\nthe floor just in time for the vote and Senator Whitmire also returning to the\nfloor. The final vote was 20-11 (just short of two-thirds). No further action was\ntaken on voter ID in the 2007 session after the verification vote failed under\nthe two-thirds rule.\n      Before the 2009 session, where voter ID would again be on the agenda,\nLt. Governor Dewhurst again reached out to Democrats in the Senate who had\nopposed legislation in 2005 and 2007. This was to no avail, as opponents\nremained entrenched. At the beginning of the session, to avoid the two-thirds\nrule that had thwarted legislation in 2007, the Senate adopted a rules change\nthat allowed voter ID legislation to proceed under a simple majority vote\ninstead. The rules change was made by majority vote. Senator Shapleigh\nraised   two   points    of   order   objecting   to   the    rules   change,   but\nLt. Governor Dewhurst overruled them “[b]ecause the rules of the Senate\npermitted a majority of the Senators to change the Senate rules, so . . . [this\nchange] was entirely within the tradition and rules of the Senate.”      According\nto Karina Davis, the Senate Parliamentarian, the Senate has only designated\ntwo categories of bills for such special treatment since 1981: redistricting and\nvoter ID. Notably, both of these categories have to do with elections. This\nmakes sense, as such matters cut to the very heart of how a representative\ndemocracy will function and concern the “highly political judgments,” Bartlett\nv.

Further, even though the two-\nthirds rule has been suspended by special treatment in only these two\ncategories, the legislative history of the Senate is replete with examples since\nWorld War II of Lt. Governors who got the Senate to pass the blocker bill,\nthereby enabling majority votes on later legislation under the Senate’s normal\nrules. 23\n       Beginning on March 10, 2009, the Senate held a 23-hour hearing on the\nproposed bill that lasted until 6 AM the next morning, at which members of\nthe public could testify. At the hearing’s conclusion, the bill passed the Senate.\nThis time, however, the House would be the source of voter ID’s demise. House\nleaders expressed a willingness to compromise, and included many so-called\nameliorative measures and a provision to delay implementation until 2013 of\nwhatever passed.        Thwarted by opposition in both parties, House leaders\ninstead moved the bill the Senate passed. House opponents decided on a\nstrategy called “chubbing” to kill the bill. 24 This was successful, as House\nopponents chubbed for 26 hours 25 over five days and prevented over 200 bills,\n\n\n       23 The 2009 rules change also provided that voter ID legislation would be referred to\nthe Senate Committee of the Whole (i.e. the entire Senate) rather than traditional committee\nstructures. More on that to come.\n\n       24  Chubbing in the Texas House is analogous to filibustering in the Texas Senate.\nWith a filibuster, a single senator speaks on a topic for a long amount of time in order to\nprevent further consideration.        House rules prevent filibustering, but allow any\nrepresentative the ability to speak for 10 minutes on any bill he favors. To chub,\nrepresentatives use their allotted 10 minutes to speak in favor of any and all legislation,\nroutine or not, that is considered before the target bill. When multiple representatives\ncombine their speaking privileges across multiple bills, they are able to run the clock out on\ntarget legislation slated to be considered later in the session.\n\n       25 There are apparently no records kept on the historical number or length of chubs\nin the Texas House, but information is kept on the number and length of analogous filibusters\nin the Texas Senate. To put the 26 hour chub into context, witness in this case and former\nState Senator Wendy Davis’s 2013 filibuster against abortion legislation lasted just 11 hours.\n                                            128\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 129     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nincluding voter ID, from being passed.              Governor Perry considered, but\nultimately decided against, placing voter ID on the agenda for the special\nlegislative session he later called.\n       After the 2009 session again ended without a bill’s being passed, voter\nID proponents decided that the 2011 session would be different.                        After\nrepeatedly     reaching     out   to   opponents,      incorporating     some     of   their\namendments/suggestions, and repeatedly being rebuffed by extraordinary\nlegislative maneuvering, proponents decided to pass whatever law they could\nthat was modeled after Indiana’s law that had been upheld by the Supreme\nCourt in Crawford 26 and Georgia’s law that had received preclearance from the\nDepartment of Justice. The majority and the district court indict Texas for\nsupposedly being unresponsive to opposition needs and for introducing\nincreasingly strict bills. At least equally plausible is that proponents perceived\na legislative necessity in the face of intransigence on this “wedge issue that the\nDemocrats were not going to agree to regardless of the fact . . . [that] a super\nmajority of Texas voters [of all races] were in favor of Voter ID.” As the district\ncourt put it, “the political lives of some legislators depended upon” voter ID’s\nsuccess.

He said in February 2010: “I might as well put [the Legislature]\n\n\n\nA 26 hour chub, were it a filibuster, would be good for the sixth longest filibuster in the\nhistory of the Texas Senate and longest since the record (43 hours) was set in 1977.

See Brief of the States of Indiana, et\nal. as Amici Curiae at 12–16, Veasey v. Abbott, No. 14-41127 (5th Cir. Apr. 29, 2016).\n\n                                            129\n\f   Case: 14-41127         Document: 00513601530          Page: 130     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-41127\non notice today: We’re going to do voter ID in 2011. We can either do it early,\nor we can do it late. [The Legislature’s] call.” The emergency designation\npermitted, but did not require, voter ID legislation to be considered during the\nfirst 60 days of the 2011 session. 27 It also meant that the Legislature could\nreasonably believe it would be called back into a special session if voter ID\nlegislation was not passed during the regular session.                     Considering the\nlegislation early in the session, however, had a tactical advantage because it\nwould prevent opponents from chubbing as they had done in 2009. Both\nDemocrats and Republicans also thought that passing the legislation early in\nthe session would “get this issue behind them” so that there “wouldn’t [be] spill-\nover on other issues” for which there was a chance of bipartisan cooperation. 28\nProponents also noted that opposition protestations to early consideration\nwere likely stall tactics similar to those employed in the prior three sessions.\nThe bill 29 was designated a priority of the Lt. Governor and accordingly\nassigned a low bill number, but this does not “expedite consideration of the bill\nin any way except for putting members on notice that it’s one of [the Lt.\nGovernor’s] priorities.”           The majority takes issue with the Senate’s\nconsideration of SB 14 by the Committee of the Whole (i.e. the entire Senate)\nrather than through its traditional committee structure. However, this was\ndone because the legislation was going to be considered on an expedited basis,\n\n\n       27Eminent domain legislation, along with perhaps a couple of other topics, were also\ndesignated emergencies for the 2011 session.\n\n       28   Further, all of the emergency legislation was considered early in the 2011 session.\n\n       29    Actually, nine photo voter ID bills were filed in the Senate, but Lt. Governor\nDewhurst selected Senator Fraser’s and asked him to refile it as priority legislation. Senator\nFraser had been the Senate sponsor of previous bills that failed. That there were so many\nbills filed demonstrates just how politically important voter ID legislation was.\n\n                                              130\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 131      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nand this is a commonly used and effective way to disseminate information\nabout such legislation to the entire Senate. 30 Far from being “unusual,” as the\ndistrict court described it, Veasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 648, it had been\nused for issues such as school finance and redistricting within the past decade\nbefore 2011.\n       To avoid what happened in 2007, the Senate rolled forward the rule from\nthe 2009 session that allowed voter ID bills to be considered by simple majority\nrather than two-thirds vote. The majority faults the Legislature for this, but\nthe decision is easily explainable on political grounds—the majority party\nwanted to avoid the two-thirds rule that had blocked similar legislation in a\nprior session. 31 Further, as just discussed, the Legislature could reasonably\nbelieve that Governor Perry would call an emergency session to consider voter\nID legislation if not passed during the regular session. The two-thirds rule\ndoes not apply during special sessions because blocker bills cannot be filed, as\n\n\n\n       30 Additionally, legislation considered in the Committee of the Whole can be referred\nto the entire Senate after just 24 hours, so it is important to ensure the entire Senate has all\nimportant information it needs.\n\n       31  As if further evidence is necessary to show that the suspension of the two-thirds\nrule was for political motivations, and not racially discriminatory ones, it is notable that the\nTexas Senate (by majority vote) completely did away with the two-thirds rule in the 2015\nsession. It is now the three-fifths rule, which has the effect of reducing from 21 to 19 the\nnumber of Senators necessary to move legislation past a blocker bill. Under the new\nthreshold in the 2015 session, the Texas Senate was able to pass Republican political\npriorities such as open carry, campus carry, moving the public integrity unit from the Travis\nCounty District Attorney’s Office to the Texas Rangers, and an A-F grading system for public\nschools. All of these bills had been designated, as SB 14 was in 2011, priority legislation by\nthe Lt. Governor and assigned correspondingly low bill numbers. Ironically, Democrats also\npassed a few bills out of the Senate under the new three-fifths rule that would have been\nblocked under the old two-thirds rule, including one that would make it easier for some state\nemployees to work from home and have more flexible work hours. See Aman Batheja,\nWithout Two-Thirds Rule, Senate Moving Patrick’s Priorities, TEX. TRIB. (May 19, 2015),\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2015/05/19/loss-two-thirds-rule-senate/.\n\n                                             131\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 132     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nwas the case in the 2011 special session that considered redistricting\nlegislation. Voter ID was going to be considered without the two-thirds rule\none way or the other. 32\n       This history thoroughly explains why voter ID legislation as eventually\ncontained in SB 14—which the majority dismisses as not “a problem of great\nmagnitude”—was considered before what the majority believes are other\n“pressing matters of great importance to Texas.” In addition, the 2011 bill that\neventually turned into SB 14 contained several notable provisions. First, in an\neffort to combat multiple types of voter fraud, a provision was included that\nwould have addressed voter registration fraud, in addition to just in-person\nfraud that voter ID laws combat. This provision was removed because the\nSenate has a one-subject rule that prohibited it from addressing this other type\nof fraud in SB 14. Next, several provisions in SB 14 were inserted into prior\nvoter ID legislation at the behest of members of the Democrat minority. For\nexample, Senators Gallegos and Shapleigh were concerned about voter ID’s\nimpact on the elderly, so proponents inserted age exemptions into the version\nof SB 14 that passed the Senate. Additionally, opponents’ concern for the law’s\nimpact on the poor during prior iterations of the bill led soon afterwards to the\nelimination of charges for ID and underlying documents. Thus, contrary to\nwhat the majority asserts, SB 14 was neither unresponsive to the concerns of\nlegislative minorities nor was there a lack of motivation to address other types\nof fraud besides in-person fraud.\n\n\n\n\n       32 Additionally, in order to pass a budget, the two-thirds rule was suspended in the\n2011 session by a procedural move different from that used to suspend it for SB 14. See Ross\nRamsey, Failed Budget Vote Threatens Texas Senate Tradition, TEX. TRIB. (May 3, 2011),\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2011/05/03/failed-budget-vote-threatens-senate-tradition/.\nThe majority reads way too much into the suspension of the two-thirds rule.\n                                           132\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 133   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n      7. Second guessing legislative priorities and why Texas Legislature\n         prioritized remedy for voter fraud without compelling evidence\n\n\n      Ignoring the legislative history of voter ID during three previous\nlegislative sessions, the majority chides the 2011 Legislature for prioritizing\nSB 14 in a busy session without—in the majority’s view—sufficient evidence\nthat there is a problem of in-person voter fraud in Texas to justify SB 14. The\ncourt critiques that SB 14 did not single out mail-in ballots for a special degree\nof scrutiny. Of course, as the majority itself rightly notes, “[t]he Legislature is\nentitled to set whatever priorities it wishes.” These gratuitous observations\nabout legislative prioritization are therefore beside the point as the federal\ncourts lack the expertise or authority to question a legislature’s prioritization\nof various issues. Recall too, that the Legislature also wanted to address other\ntypes of fraud, such as registration fraud, but was prevented from doing so\nbecause of one voter ID opponent’s objection based on one-subject rules for\nlegislation.\n      More significant, however, in Crawford, the Supreme Court flatly\nrejected the majority’s intimation that record evidence of voter fraud is\nrequired to justify the State’s interest in preventing voter fraud. 553 U.S. at\n195–97, 128 S. Ct. at 1619–20. Indeed, the Court upheld Indiana’s voter ID\nlaw in Crawford although the record there contained “no evidence of any such\nfraud actually occurring in Indiana at any time in its history.” Id. at 194. The\nCourt instead noted that “flagrant examples of such fraud in other parts of the\ncountry,” occasional examples of more recent voter fraud, and Indiana’s\nexample of voter fraud in the 2003 Democratic primary perpetrated by\nabsentee ballots “demonstrate that not only is the risk of voter fraud real but\nthat it could affect the outcome of a close election.” Id. at 195–96.

The majority takes issue,\ngenerally, with the Legislature’s rejection of various amendments that would\nhave permitted additional forms of ID to be used and allowed the use of IDs\nwith irregularities. The majority also takes issue, specifically, with the House\nof Representatives’ removal of Senator Duncan’s amendment, which would\nhave required a provisional ballot to be accepted if the person simultaneously\nexecutes an affidavit stating that he or she is indigent and cannot obtain proof\nof identification without paying the fee. See S.J. of Tex., 82nd Leg., R.S. 137–\n38 (2011).\n      Setting aside the fact that the majority’s criticism amounts to second-\nguessing the policy choices of the state legislature, the fact that the Legislature\ndid not adopt certain ameliorative amendments tells us nothing about why the\nLegislature so acted. And it certainly provides no basis to infer that the\nLegislature rejected these various amendments because it, collectively, was\nmotivated by racial animus; this remains true even if legislators knew that\n\n\n                                       134\n\f    Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530          Page: 135      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nsome of the proposed amendments would make it easier for indigents to obtain\nID. 33\n         Even if, notwithstanding Crawford, the presence or absence of an\nindigency exception is a matter of constitutional significance, SB 14 does\ncontain ameliorative provisions for indigent persons. 34 Election identification\ncertificates, which may be properly used as a form of ID, TEX. ELEC. CODE\n§ 63.0101 (West Supp. 2014), are available free of charge and have been since\nthe bill was signed into law, TEX. TRANSP. CODE § 521A.001(b) (West 2013).\nThe Legislature also passed SB 983, which eliminates the fee associated with\nobtaining a certified copy of a birth certificate in order to obtain an EIC. TEX.\nHEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 191.0046(e) (West 2015). These provisions eliminate\nfees associated with obtaining the underlying documents necessary to obtain\nthe EIC.      There is no showing whatsoever that the Legislature tried to\nauthorize EICs that in practice would not facilitate indigent voters. 35\n\n\n         33See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279, 99 S. Ct. at 2296 (awareness of potential disparate\nimpact is not enough to prove intent). Feeney also held that the legislature’s failure to pass\na bill with less discriminatory impact cannot evidence invidious purpose: the courts are not\nempowered to disapprove laws under the Equal Protection clause for this reason. Id. at 280–\n81.\n\n         34To reiterate, the Indiana law and the Texas law really aren’t that different; and\nmany of the “ameliorative” provisions that were rejected were in fact contained in earlier\niterations of the bills introduced in 2005, 2007, and 2009, at the behest of Democrats, but the\nDemocrats opposed those bills anyway.\n\n         35Furthermore, while Texas may have a comparatively strict law in terms of what ID\nmay be presented, its election laws are quite permissive regarding encouraging voter turnout.\n        These provisions include: an approximately two week early voting period with no\nrestrictions, TEX. ELEC. CODE § 85.001(a), wide availability of voter registration applications,\nsee Request for Voter Registration Applications, TEX. SEC’Y OF ST., http://www.sos.state.tx.us/\nelections/voter/reqvr.shtml (last visited June 28, 2016) (providing online voter registration\napplications), and the flexibility of mail-in ballots without photo ID requirements for the\nelderly and disabled, TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 82.002–003. Taken in “context,” it is as easy, if not\neasier, to register and vote in Texas than it is in many other states.\n\n                                             135\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530        Page: 136   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n\n\n      9. “Contemporary examples of state-sponsored discrimination”\n\n\n      The   majority    asserts   that   “[t]he     circumstantial   evidence    of\ndiscriminatory intent is augmented by contemporary examples of State-\nsponsored discrimination in the record.”      It then goes on to cite several\nexamples, taken from the district court’s opinion, of alleged recent\ndiscrimination by Texas against minorities. This recitation is riddled with\nerrors and on examination, disintegrates into forty-plus year old actions.\n      The majority first claims that “as late as 1975, Texas attempted to\nsuppress minority voting through purging the voter rolls, after its former poll\ntax and re-registration requirements were ruled unconstitutional.” (citing\nVeasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 635).          Thus, the most “contemporary”\nexample that the majority or district court can cite was in 1975.\n      In its next attempt to find recent examples of intentional discrimination\non the part of Texas, the majority credits the district court’s statement that\n“[i]n every redistricting cycle since 1970, Texas has been found to have violated\nthe VRA with racially gerrymandered districts.” (quoting Veasey v.

Many, “shifting” rationales for SB 14\n\n\n       The majority also criticizes the Texas Legislature because legislators\nallegedly proffered various, “shifting” rationales for the law. Citing to the\ndistrict court’s opinion, the majority states that the reasons for the law “shifted\nas they were challenged or disproven by opponents.” Of course, “legislators\nand administrators are properly concerned with balancing numerous\ncompeting considerations,” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266, 97 S. Ct. at 563,\nso it would be unsurprising to hear legislators advancing different rationales\nfor supporting a particular bill.         In this case, however, the depositions of\nvarious legislators who voted in favor of SB 14 revealed a consistent purpose\nbehind this voter ID law: to prevent voter fraud and thereby promote the\nintegrity of the voting process; in the minds of some legislators this would\nimprove public confidence and possibly increase voter turnout. 37 Preventing\nvoter fraud and increasing public confidence are closely interrelated,\nCrawford, 553 U.S. at 197, 128 S.

The remediation\nundertaken by the Texas Legislature undermines any inference of an intent to discriminate,\nespecially when its original plan could have been kept in place after the Supreme Court\nvacated the D.C. District’s opinion.\n\n       37  See supra note 17 (collecting statements of purpose from the deposition testimony\nof legislators who were proponents of SB 14).\n                                            138\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 139    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nrelated purposes as a cover for hiding a racially discriminatory intent, as the\nmajority asserts is a plausible inference, makes no sense.\n      The majority’s contention that the legislators shifted between these\npurposes when the rationales were “challenged or disproven by opponents,”\nsimilarly proves too much. By this statement, the majority, like the district\ncourt, presumably means that the Legislature did not, in its view, provide\nenough evidence to support its proffered interests in the face of opponents’\ncriticism.

All legislative measures have conspired to work against African-\n         American voters\n\n\n      Dr. Burton opined that, no matter the party in power, political interests\nhave always worked to deny African-Americans the right to vote: “every time\nthat African-Americans have, in fact, been perceived to be increasing their\nability to vote and participate in the process there has been State legislation\n\n                                        139\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530     Page: 140   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nto either deny them the vote or at least dilute the vote or make it much more\ndifficult for them to participate on an equal basis as Whites in the State of\nTexas.”\n      This conclusion is belied, however, by materials that Dr. Burton himself\ncites. For instance, the Supreme Court found that Democratic-led redistricting\nin the 1990s led to racial gerrymanders favoring African-American and\nHispanic Congressional candidates. See Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. at 956–57, 116\nS. Ct. at 1950–51.    The Supreme Court rejected a claim that early 2000s\nCongressional redistricting around the Dallas area diluted the African-\nAmerican vote. See LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. at 443–47, 126 S. Ct. at 2624–\n26. In addition, an expert report credited by the district court showed African-\nAmerican and Hispanic representation among state legislators to generally\nalign with their proportion in the total population. See Veasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Partisanship, however, is not racism, nor\nis it a proxy for racism on this record.      The majority, however, connects\n“extraordinary procedural measures accompanying the passage of SB 14 to a\n‘seismic demographic shift,’” and suggests that the Republicans in power could\ngain a partisan advantage through a voter ID law. But to repeat: even the\ndistrict court acknowledged that a photo voter ID requirement had wide\nmultiracial, bipartisan public support.\n      Indeed, the Supreme Court in Crawford specifically held that\npartisanship in Indiana’s voter ID law, also passed on a straight party-line\n\n                                      140\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530         Page: 141   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-41127\nbasis, could not defeat the law’s purposes in deterring fraud. 553 U.S. at 204,\n128 S. Ct. at 1624. And although the Supreme Court in LULAC v. Perry found\nthat the Texas Legislature violated Section 2 in one Congressional district it\ndrew after the 2000 census, the Court did not accuse the Legislature of racism,\nbut at most of partisanship.        The “seismic demographic shift” has been\nunderway for at least twenty years—as Republicans took over every major\nstatewide office in Texas.     The inference that SB 14 implies a sudden\nefflorescence of racial bias is contradicted by LULAC v. Perry and is a non-\nsequitur.\n                                       ****\n        For all these reasons, the weak, or unsupported inferences claimed by\nthe majority are contradicted by the overwhelming evidence from the complete\nrecord that negated any racially discriminatory purpose behind SB 14. SB 14\nmay or may not be the best approach to protecting the integrity of in-person\nvoting, but it is the approach that succeeded after more than six years of\nintransigent and uncompromising partisan opposition. The law reflects party\npolitics, not racism, and the majority of this court—in their hearts—know this.\nSee generally Samuel Issacharoff, Ballot Bedlam, 64 DUKE L.J. 1363, 1363\n(2015) (“[A]lthough issues of the franchise correlate with race, as does the\npartisan divide between Democrats and Republicans, the new battles over\nballot access do not readily lend themselves to a narrative that focuses\nprimarily on racial exclusion.”).\nIII.   Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act\n       The majority’s conclusion that SB 14 violates the “results test” defined\nin Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act misconstrues the law, misapplies the\nfacts, and raises serious constitutional questions. This decision stands alone\namong circuit court decisions to date: two circuits have upheld photo voter ID\n                                        141\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 142     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nlaws against Section 2 challenges, 38 others have upheld them as a\nconstitutional matter, 39 but no circuit court has yet invalidated a photo voter\nID law under Section 2.         The majority’s errors lead it to depart from the\nstatute’s text, resulting in the adoption of non-textual and irrelevant “factors”\nthat, in practice, amount to little more than a naked disparate impact test.

That these (unfortunately)\nreflect differences among Whites, Blacks and Hispanics is a sociological fact in\nTexas as elsewhere.

That the ballots could get lost or stolen from the mail is no more\nof a risk than the loss of a Social Security check.\n\n       47  Space does not permit elaboration, but the majority defends its application of the\nGingles factors in part by repeatedly mischaracterizing and distorting the State’s arguments.\n       48 Two Gingles factors, the existence of racially polarized voting and the lack of racial\n\ncampaign appeals, are plainly irrelevant here. Another factor, the history of state-sponsored\ndiscrimination recounted by the majority has already been shown to be legally unsupported,\nsee discussion supra, and “long-ago.” The Legislature that passed SB 14 had virtually\nproportional minority representation, rendering another Gingles factor, the extent of elected\nminority officials throughout the state, beside the point. Finally, showing the Legislature as\n“unresponsive” to minorities solely with reference to the 2011 events preceding passage of\nSB 14 fundamentally misunderstands this Gingles factor, which relates to the overall\nconduct of representative government as it applies to legislative districting; moreover, as has\nbeen shown, the majority and district court did not read the legislative record over the past\nfour sessions and six years.\n                                             149\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 150     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nconnect these findings to contemporary discrimination by the state of Texas. 49\nThe majority goes out of its way, however, to assert that it “does not decide”\nwhether this factor can only be satisfied by a legacy of official state\ndiscrimination.

The majority avers that there is hardly any evidence of in-person\nvoter fraud in Texas—the Senatorial election of “Landslide Lyndon” Johnson\nin 1948 seems to have been forgotten—and there is no proof that voter\nconfidence in the integrity of the ballot is enhanced by requiring voters to prove\ntheir ID at the polls—despite the opinion polls showing the overwhelming\npopularity of photo ID requirements. 52 Even if the district court’s findings are\ntaken at face value, however, this conclusion proves too much. If requiring a\nphoto voter ID has no rational basis, as the majority concludes, the entire law,\nnot simply its application to minority voters, would be indicted.\n      The sum of the majority’s reasoning, despite its emphasis on “an\nintensely local appraisal” and its incantation of seven Gingles factors, boils\ndown to these propositions:\n      (1) SB 14 specifically burdens Texans living in poverty, who are\n      less likely to possess qualified photo ID, are less able to get it, and\n      may not otherwise need it; (2) a disproportionate number of Texans\n      living in poverty are African–Americans and Hispanics; and\n      (3) African–Americans and Hispanics are more likely than Anglos\n      to be living in poverty because they continue to bear the\n      socioeconomic effects caused by decades of racial discrimination.\n(citing Veasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 664). As a result of finding a racial\ndisparity among those who possess or have access to SB 14 IDs and using the\nGingles factors, the majority affirms a Section 2 violation. Liability therefore\nturns, under the majority’s approach, on essentially three conclusions. First,\na particular regulation has a “disparate impact” because it creates an\nadditional voting burden upon poor, disproportionately minority voters.\nSecond, Texas has a history of official discrimination whose effects persist to\n\n\n      52 Moreover, some studies actually show that voter ID laws increase voter turnout.\nSee Gilbert, supra note 50, at 749 n.56 and accompanying text (collecting studies and\ndiscussing rationales).\n                                         152\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 153      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nthe present day. Third, the law in question could have been written more\nnarrowly. 53\n       These conclusions are incredibly open-ended. The first conclusion can be\nmet even though, as here, the law in question disadvantages only a small\npercentage of voters and contains ameliorative provisions and exemptions.\nThe second conclusion is basically a condition of American society, although\ncontrary to the majority opinion, current socioeconomic conditions cannot be\nexplained in terms of any recent state-sponsored discrimination. The third\nconclusion is at war with the Supreme Court’s acknowledgement of the State’s\nand public’s interest in ballot integrity as well as the Texas public’s approval\nof photo voter IDs.\n        Virtually any voter regulation that disproportionately affects minority\nvoters can be challenged successfully under the majority’s rationale: polling\nlocations; days allowed and reasons for early voting; mail-in ballots; time limits\nfor voter registration; language on absentee ballots; the number of vote-\ncounting machines a county must have; registering voters at a DMV (required\nby the federal Motor Voter law); holding elections on Tuesday. Such challenges\nare occurring at the present time. 54\n\n\n       53  Judge Higginson’s special opinion embraces and embroiders the majority’s position\nadopting the Gingles factors to interpret Section 2. Judge Higginson focuses principally on\nracial socioeconomic disparities as the touchstone for Section 2 liability, thus overlooking the\nSupreme Court’s warning that states cannot be held responsible to fix disparities they did\nnot create. He disparages requiring plaintiffs to prove that SB 14 itself caused (“resulted in”)\nthe abridgement of voting rights—while apparently accepting the majority’s legally upside-\ndown view that the state must prove the statute’s efficacy in preventing voter fraud. Finally,\nJudge Higginson’s disparate impact focus would create constitutional tension, to say the\nleast, by forcing states to become race-conscious in avoiding disparate impact whenever they\nenact voting regulations. This result is not a benign “evolutionary” process to “harmonize”\nlegislative priorities with the right to vote; it is judicial micromanagement of race-neutral\nvoting regulations consigned to the states.\n        54 See, e.g., Ne.

Abridgement is less\nthan outright denial of the vote. It is the challenged regulation, here SB 14,\nrather than “socioeconomic conditions” or a “history of discrimination,” that\nmust cause the disparate impact.                Moreover, Section 2(b), the “results”\nprovision, “tells us that [Section] 2(a) does not condemn a voting practice just\nbecause it has a disparate effect on minorities. (If things were that simple,\nthere wouldn’t have been a need for Gingles to list nine non-exclusive factors\nin vote-dilution cases.).” Frank, 768 F.3d at 753. After all, nearly every voting\nregulation poses some kind of obstacle or prerequisite to casting a ballot, and\nnearly every one of these may be potentially more disabling for poor and\nminority voters. 55       The totality of circumstances inquiry, leading to a\ndetermination whether minority voters have an equal opportunity to\nparticipate, also bears the important caveat that perfection, in the form of\nproportional representation, is not mandated. It logically follows that Section\n2 is not designed to abolish every incidental impact of facially neutral voting\nregulations.      Finally, as the Supreme Court has made clear, no citizen may\ncomplain of “the usual burdens of voting.” Crawford, 553 U.S. at 198, 128\nS. Ct. at 1621.\n       Using the textualist approach to Section 2, a vote abridgement claim\nshould be analyzed (absent proof of intentional discrimination) as follows:\nFirst, consider the total impact of the challenged regulation on the voting\npublic.     If the regulation disparately affects minority voters, proceed to\ndetermine whether the particular burden imposed by the regulation, examined\n\n\n       55 The majority opinion admits this in stating that, “[a]ccording to a well-established\nformula . . . to assess individuals’ likelihood of voting in an election, increasing the cost of\nvoting decreases voter turnout—particularly among low-income individuals, as they are most\ncost sensitive.” (citing Veasey v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

This analytical process, synthesized from\nFrank, fundamentally differs from that of the majority in three ways. First, it\ndispenses with the Gingles factors. Second, it requires a causal connection\nbetween the challenged regulation and the disparate impact.                           Third,\nSection 2(b) is better read as an “equal-treatment requirement (which is how\nit reads)” rather than “an equal-outcome command.” Frank, 768 F.3d at 754. 56\n       Contrary to the majority opinion, applying the statute itself in this way\ndoes not neuter or minimize minority citizens’ voting rights. The question\nunder Section 2 is whether a regulation “needlessly” burdens those rights. Id.\nat 753. Justice Scalia’s dissent in Chisom v.

Frank found the Gingles factors “unhelpful” in vote abridgment cases,\n768 F.3d at 754, and applied the two-part test only “for the sake of argument,” id. at 755. On\nrehearing, the court never mentions Section 2 liability but appears instead to foot its\ndiscussion on the Anderson/Burdick claim. See Frank v. Walker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 386 (7th Cir.\n2016) (Frank II).\n       Moreover, Frank finds no Section 2 violation where the Wisconsin voter ID law\narguably had a higher disparate impact on voter ID possession than SB 14. Compare Frank,\n768 F.3d at 752 (92.7% of Whites, 86.8% of Blacks, and 85.1% of Hispanics possessed photo\nIDs), with Veasey v.

The majority’s finding that a racial disparity “in ID\npossession” exists between Anglos and Blacks and Hispanics is not clearly\nwrong. The majority does not, however, establish that SB 14 “resulted in” or\ncaused a diminution of the right to vote, nor does the “totality of circumstances”\ndemonstrate that minority voters’ opportunity to participate has been reduced.\n      A tailored causation analysis is imperative under Section 2 case law. Not\nonly does Gingles offer ample support for a requirement that the challenged\nlaw causes the prohibited voting results, but six circuit courts, including this\ncourt, have clearly so held. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48 n.15, 106 S.

SB 14 does not adversely impact over 90% of minority voters\nwho already possess SB 14 IDs or thousands of others eligible to vote by mail\nor any voter who can readily obtain a free EIC. Moreover, the plaintiffs here\ndid not show that SB 14 had any effect on voter turnout or that any disparity\nin voter-quality ID possession was caused by SB 14. The rate of preexisting ID\npossession does not prove “that participation in the political process is in fact\ndepressed among minority citizens.” LULAC, 999 F.2d at 867. To understand\nthe totality of circumstances, at least three subsidiary questions had to be\nanswered: how many of those without SB 14 ID already have the documents\nto get one? Of those without the underlying documents, how many would have\nsignificant trouble obtaining them? And within that much smaller group, how\nmany have actually voted in the past or intend to vote in the future? The actual\nadverse racial impact of SB 14 is not demonstrated by gross no-match list\npercentages, but by the impact on these subsets of the 4.5% of Texas voters\ncurrently without SB 14 ID. The record is bereft of such information.\n      As the Ninth Circuit held, “a [Section] 2 challenge ‘based purely on a\nshowing of some relevant statistical disparity between minorities and whites,’\nwithout any evidence that the challenged voting qualification causes that\ndisparity, will be rejected.” Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 405 (citation omitted); see\n                                       158\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530       Page: 159    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\nalso Frank, 768 F.3d at 753 (Section 2 “does not condemn a voting practice just\nbecause it has a disparate effect on minorities”).         The majority’s opinion\nfundamentally turns on a statistical disparity in ID possession among different\nraces, but instead of showing that this disparity was caused by SB 14, the\nmajority relies on socioeconomic and historical conditions as the causes of this\ndisparity. This finding conflicts with the Supreme Court’s recent instruction\nthat “a disparate-impact claim that relies on a statistical disparity must fail if\nthe plaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy or policies causing that\ndisparity.” Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523. Without a showing that\nSB 14 caused the disparity in ID possession, the majority holds Texas “liable\nfor racial disparities [it] did not create.” Id. (citation omitted).\n       Moreover, past examples of State-sponsored discrimination are not\nindicative that SB 14, the “challenged voting qualification,” caused the\ndisparity in ID possession. After all, the majority itself discredited “long ago”\nevidence of State-sponsored discrimination when it reversed many parts of the\ndistrict court’s finding that SB 14 was enacted with discriminatory intent. The\nmajority’s attempt to shore up a finding of state-action-related discrimination\nwith no more than socioeconomic disparities (and even alleged local differences\nin high school discipline, which can’t be the fault of the State of Texas), fails\nthe test of LULAC, Gonzalez, and Inclusive Communities.\n      Misplacing its reliance on the Gingles factors, the majority also fatally\nerrs in discounting the State’s and the public’s interest in enforcing SB 14. The\nState’s interests are weighty, they are to be treated as a matter of law, not fact\nas the majority does, and they outweigh the insubstantial proof of diminished\nminority opportunity to participate caused by SB 14.\n      In Crawford, the Supreme Court held that the State’s legitimate interest\nin preventing voter fraud is “sufficiently strong” to justify a voter ID law even\n                                        159\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 160    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nwithout any evidence of voter fraud in the record. 553 U.S. at 204, 128 S.

Ct. at 1620. Nonetheless, the majority finds\nthat these recognized State interests are only tenuously related to SB 14’s\nprovisions.\n      The majority inaptly attempts to distinguish Crawford because that case\nreviewed a summary judgment record and involved constitutional challenges\nto the right to vote, while this case is brought under Section 2 after a full trial.\nCrawford, however, carefully balanced the voters’ difficulties in obtaining\nvoter ID under the Indiana law against the State’s interests, and concluded:\n“For most voters who need them, the inconvenience of making a trip to the\n[DMV], gathering the required documents, and posing for a photograph surely\ndoes not qualify as a substantial burden on the right to vote, or even represent\na significant increase over the usual burdens of voting.” 553 U.S. at 198,\n128 S. Ct. at 1621. Although Crawford does not control the instant case, its\ngeneral conclusion stands at odds with the majority’s implicit determination\nthat “significant” and “substantial” burdens exist in obtaining voter ID for that\nsmall percentage of Texas’s Black and Hispanic voters who do not presently\npossess SB 14 ID.\n      Further, the majority mischaracterizes the State’s interests as a matter\nof adjudicative fact. This court previously held en banc that the substantiality\nof the State’s interest is a legal question to be determined as a matter of law.\nLULAC, 999 F.2d at 871. In Crawford, the Supreme Court confirmed the\nState’s strong interests as a matter of law, as it sustained Indiana’s voter ID\n                                        160\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530       Page: 161    Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-41127\nlaw without record evidence “of any such fraud actually occurring in Indiana\nat any time in its history.” 553 U.S. at 194, 128 S. Ct. at 1619. Crawford thus\nelevated the State’s interest to a status of legislative fact, which lower courts\nare bound to respect. See Frank, 768 F.3d at 750 (“After a majority of the\nSupreme Court has concluded that photo ID requirements promote confidence,\na single district judge cannot say as a ‘fact’ that they do not, even if 20 political\nscientists disagree with the Supreme Court.”). The majority wrongly second-\nguesses and subjects the State’s interest in preventing in-person voter fraud to\nroutine factual examination. But see Crawford, 553 U.S. at 196, 128 S. Ct. at\n1619 (“While the most effective method of preventing election fraud may well\nbe debatable, the propriety of doing so is perfectly clear.”). The majority was\nwrong to require record evidence of lack of confidence in elections without voter\nID. See id. at 194, 1618 (“‘The electoral system cannot inspire public confidence\nif no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of\nvoters.’” (quoting Building Confidence in U.S. Elections § 2.5 (Sept. 2005) (a\nreport prepared by a committee co-chaired by former President Jimmy Carter\nand former Secretary of the Treasury and White House Chief of Staff James A.\nBaker III)).\n      Finally, even weighing the State’s interests as a matter of fact, the\nmajority errs. The majority credits the district court’s finding that SB 14 would\ntheoretically decrease voter turnout, yet overlooked that the minimal evidence\nin the record that anybody was actually prevented from voting. There is not\neven evidence that any voter was actually unable to obtain the proper voter\nID. LULAC held that “plaintiffs cannot overcome a substantial State interest\nby proving insubstantial dilution.”       999 F.2d at 876.     It follows that the\nmajority should not reject strong State interests without any showing of an\n“abridgement of the right . . . to vote on account of race or color.” 52 U.S.C.\n                                        161\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 162      Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\n§ 10301(a). The majority errs in its treatment of the State’s strong interests at\nstake here.\n       C. Constitutional Considerations\n       The majority claims to exercise “constitutional avoidance” by electing not\nto rule on the plaintiffs’ assertion that SB 14 burdened their right to vote\ncontrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. But the majority has no qualms about\nkeeping alive the preposterous and divisive claim that SB 14 was passed with\nunconstitutional discriminatory intent. 57            And the majority’s extra-textual\ninterpretation of Section 2 runs a severe risk of unconstitutionality. So much\nfor judicial restraint.\n       As applied here, the majority’s two-part Section 2 test authorizes judicial\nmischief in micromanaging a facially neutral state law implementing a\nSupreme Court-approved purpose in order to eliminate disparate impact (in\ntypes of qualified IDs) not caused by the law itself. This result interferes with\nthe Constitution’s assignment of the conduct of elections to the States and is\nnot congruent and proportional as a remedy for violation of voting rights\nprotected by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\n       The     Constitution’s      “Elections      Clause      empowers        Congress      to\nregulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them.”\n\n\n       57 The Supreme Court itself declined to rule on Equal Protection issues raised in a\nredistricting case where the lower court decision might rest on the alternative ground of the\nVoting Rights Act.

A faithful adherence to the statutory text of Section 2 would have\navoided constitutional difficulties.\nIV.     Conclusion\n        Today’s result moves us another step down the road of judicial\nsupremacy by potentially subjecting virtually every voter regulation to\nlitigation in federal court.   According to the twists and turns of the majority\nopinions, purposeful racial discrimination can be “inferred” even without a\nshred of discriminatory utterance—not even one document of thousands of\ninternal communications betrayed such purposes. Equally perversely, such a\ndiscrimination claim can be bolstered by legislative actions from forty to sixty\nyears ago, when Texas was a Democrat-controlled state, whose legacy has been\nrepudiated by current Republican dominance. (Not that party designation\nmatters, but that any legislature’s actions can be probative of decades-later\nactions when the legislature is controlled by the opposing party is bizarre.)\nSimilarly, a Section 2 claim can rest on a marginal racially disparate impact\nestimated from sadly intransigent socioeconomic disparities coupled with a\nstate’s “long-ago history” of discrimination. Voting rights litigation is thus\ndecoupled from any “results” caused by the state.\n                                       167\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 168     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\n      No doubt the majority believes that federal judges are well suited to\nregulate the electoral process. As with many judge-made “solutions,” however,\ntoday’s results will backfire. Judicial decisions will spawn inconsistent results\nand uncertainty, leading the public to question judges’ impartiality. This\ndecision will thus foster cynicism about the courts and more rather than less\nracial tension. Lawmakers at every level will be forced to be race-conscious,\nnot race-neutral, in protecting the sanctity of the ballot and the integrity of\npolitical processes. Finally, these unauthorized and extra-legislative transfers\nof power to the judiciary disable the working of the democratic process, which\nfor all its imperfections, best represents “we the people.”\n      For these reasons, we dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                       168\n\f   Case: 14-41127       Document: 00513601530         Page: 169     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-41127\nJERRY E.

There\nis no majority opinion, but only a plurality opinion that draws six separate\ndissenting opinions and a special concurrence. 1\n\n         Despite deep divisions on key questions, however, the en banc court is\nunanimous in roundly repudiating the district court for legal error on some\nissues. Most significantly, the district judge attempted to wipe the Texas\nvoter ID law entirely off the books―a remedy that the majority rightly observes\n“is potentially broader than the one to which Plaintiffs would be entitled . . . .”\n(Page 77.) The en banc court instead leaves the voter ID requirement essen-\ntially intact. In reversing, all fifteen judges agree that, in the words of the\nplurality opinion, “the vast majority of eligible voters possess SB 14 ID, and we\ndo not disturb SB 14’s effect on those voters―those who have SB 14 ID must\nshow it to vote.” (Page 82.) That is a global change from what the district court\nruled.\n\n         The en banc court is likewise unanimous in reversing the district judge’s\nbizarre declaration that SB 14 is a poll tax. (Part IV.) That is a frivolous claim\nthat never should have seen the light of day. Her holding reveals this judge’s\n\n\n         1This case is an apt candidate for the well-worn saying, “You can’t tell the players\nwithout a scorecard.” Harry Stevens is credited with coming up with these words.

(Part III.) The plurality opinion properly dismisses\nthose claims, criticizing the district court for ignoring the “well established\nprinciple governing the prudent exercise of . . . jurisdiction that [federal courts]\nwill not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground . . . .”\n(Page 71.)\n\n      The plurality opinion, although charitably allowing the district judge a\nsecond chance to review existing evidence, also roundly and repeatedly scolds\nher for mishandling that evidence and making erroneous findings therefrom.\nFor example, the plurality aptly declares that “some [of the] findings are\ninfirm.” (Page 10.) Some “findings are infirm because of an erroneous view of\nthe law.” (Page 10.) “[W]e hold that much of the evidence upon which the\ndistrict court relied was infirm.” (Page 13.) “Because the district court relied\nupon evidence we conclude is infirm, the district court’s opinion cannot stand\nas written.” (Page 18.) “[T]he district court’s analysis contained some legal\ninfirmities.” (Page 19.) “[S]ome of the evidence on which the district court\nrelied was infirm.” (Page 30.) The plurality gives the district court “instruc-\ntions . . . about the legal infirmities in its initial findings.” (Page 32.) The\njudge is told “to reevaluate the evidence” (Page 32) in accordance with “the\nappropriate legal standards” (Page 31).        The plurality sternly rejects the\njudge’s use of suspect evidence: “[W]e do not agree that such anecdotal evi-\ndence of racial campaign appeals shows that SB 14 denies or abridges the right\n\n                                        170\n\f   Case: 14-41127      Document: 00513601530    Page: 171   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nto vote.” (Page 64.)\n\n      In sum, the vast majority of the judges on the en banc court have\ndeclared the district judge to have substantially erred in myriad legal\nconclusions and use of evidence, and the court is unanimous in several of those\nreversals. The district court is well-advised to avoid such regrettable mis-\nadventure on remand.\n\n\n\n\n                                      171\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530       Page: 172   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nJAMES L.

See, e.g., Maj. Op. at 20-30\n(discussing part of the voluminous evidence that tends to show that SB 14 was\nenacted with a discriminatory purpose). Nevertheless, the majority reverses\nthe district court because of purported legal errors, specifically, the district\ncourt’s reliance on evidence that, in the majority’s view, is “infirm.”\n      Of course, Rule 52(a) does not apply to conclusions of law, and the district\ncourt’s findings may be set aside if they rest on an erroneous view of the law.\nPullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at 287. In my view, however, examination of the\ndistrict court’s opinion reveals no legal error and no reliance on infirm\nevidence. Instead of correcting legal errors, the majority opinion mistakenly\nlapses into an independent reweighing of the evidence and encroaches upon\nthe district court’s domain, in violation of Rule 52(a)’s clear instruction.

Id. at 298 n.20.

And, because of the\nLegislature’s repeated invocation of ballot integrity concerns to justify\ndiscriminatory practices, the district court concluded that “[t]here has been a\nclear and disturbing pattern of discrimination in the name of combatting voter\nfraud in Texas.” Id. Unlike the kind of isolated and remote evidence the\nSupreme Court rejected in McClesky, evidence of a pervasive pattern of\noperation is relevant to determining whether the legislature’s current intent\nwas discriminatory. While “history did not end in 1965,” Shelby Cty., 133 S.\nCt. at 2628, neither legal precedent nor logic requires that we act as if it started\nin 1965 and close our eyes to the historical context surrounding challenged\nstate action. 1 See W. FAULKNER, REQUIEM FOR A NUN 80 (Vintage Books 1975)\n(1951) (“The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”).\n       Next, the majority opinion faults the district court for its reliance on\nevidence that, in the majority’s view, is “limited in [its] probative value,”\nincluding the relatively recent history of official discriminatory actions in a\n\n\n       1 The majority opinion itself recognizes that this evidence is relevant and probative.\nIn surveying the evidence that tends to support the district court’s discriminatory purpose\nfinding, the majority opinion discusses evidence of Texas’ history of “justifying voter\nsuppression efforts,” including the all-white primary, literacy and secret ballot requirements,\npoll tax, and re-registration and purging, “with the race-neutral reason of promoting ballot\nintegrity.” Maj. Op. at 23. Thus, the majority opinion suggests that this evidence tends to\nshow that the Legislature’s justification of SB 14 as a measure to ensure ballot integrity was\npretext. See id. at 23. But the majority opinion does not explain why this historical evidence,\nwhich may be used to prove pretext, cannot be used to support a more direct inference of\ndiscriminatory intent.\n                                             175\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530       Page: 176   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nparticular Texas county and post-enactment testimony by proponents of the\nbill. Maj. Op. at 14-15, 18. In that respect, the majority opinion explicitly\nengages in reweighing of the evidence. See, e.g., id. at 18 (“While probative in\ntheory, even those (after-the-fact) stray statements made by a few individual\nlegislators voting for SB 14 may not be the best indicia of the Texas\nLegislature’s intent.”). But determining the weight of the evidence “is the\nspecial province of the trier of fact,” and this court may not reject the district\ncourt’s finding simply because it would have assigned different weight to\ncertain evidence than did the district court. Inwood Labs., 456 U.S. at 856.\n      Finally, the majority opinion criticizes the district court for relying on\nconjecture and conclusory accusations by the bill’s opponents in the Texas\nLegislature about the proponents’ motives. Maj. Op. at 16-18. However, in its\nanalysis of the discriminatory purpose claim, the district court did not rely on\nconjecture or conclusory assertions; instead, the court relied in part on\ntestimony by SB 14’s opponents as to particular facts and drew independent\nconclusions from those facts. See, e.g., Veasey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The majority may not simply discard the\ndistrict court’s findings by substituting its own assessment of the evidence for\nthat of the district court. See Inwood Labs., 456 U.S. at 856.\n      In sum, the majority opinion identifies legal error where there is none,\ndisturbs valid factual findings by the proper fact-finder, and thereby exceeds\nthis court’s authority under Rule 52(a).

The most pernicious of the measures cited by the district court\npredate the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. In fact, despite some\nbygone history of official discrimination, Texas’s voting practices had so\nimproved by 1965 that it was not included in the original preclearance\nrequirements of the Voting Rights Act. As the plurality must admit, the district\ncourt’s heavy reliance on such outdated historical evidence was error. Op. at\n13-15; see McCleskey v.

There is no substantial contemporary evidence of\ndiscrimination, and far from enough evidence to impugn the intentions of the\nentire Legislature in passing SB 14.\n      Second, the plurality fails to address the “specific sequence of events\nleading up [to] the challenged decision,” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267,\nbut an analysis of this factor makes clear that the district court erred. In\nArlington Heights, the Supreme Court explained that courts should look to\nwhether, for example, a legislative decision was precipitated by a sudden\nchange in circumstances. See id. at 267 & n.16 (collecting cases and providing\n                                       179\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530       Page: 180   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\nexample of sudden change in zoning laws after learning of plans to erect\nintegrated housing).

That is not the type of specific-sequence evidence, however, envisioned by\nthe Court in Arlington Heights. The events leading up to the enactment of SB\n14 demonstrate that lawmakers were concerned about protecting the integrity\nof elections, a concern backed by surveys showing that Texas voters of all races\nagreed with this goal and supported requiring photo IDs to vote. There is no\nevidence of sudden changed circumstances; in fact, the district court noted that\nSB 14 was debated over a lengthy six-year period. Id.\n      Third, the plurality claims that certain procedural departures by the\nLegislature provide a “potential link” in the “circumstantial totality of\nevidence” of possible discriminatory purpose. Op. at 24. But, as the plurality\nconcedes, “context matters.” Id. Viewed in the appropriate context, the\nprocedural maneuvers employed by the Legislature occurred precisely because\nopponents of the legislation—several of whom are the very parties who brought\nthis lawsuit—blocked three earlier iterations of voter ID legislation over the\ncourse of several years. While the Legislature made some departures from its\nnormal procedural sequence in passing SB 14, these departures are easily\nexplained as a way to avoid the obstructive tactics that had repeatedly defeated\nvoter ID bills in past sessions. In other words, the political effectiveness of SB\n14’s opponents precipitated the Legislature’s procedural departures.\n      The plurality makes much of the Legislature’s passage of SB 14 in the\nmidst of other “pressing matters of great importance to Texas.” Op. at 26. In\ndoing so, the plurality only feigns deference to the legislative process by\nclaiming that the Legislature “is entitled to set whatever priorities it wishes.”\nId. at 25. We are not entitled to supplement our policy preferences for that of\n                                       180\n\f   Case: 14-41127    Document: 00513601530      Page: 181   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-41127\nthe Legislature, and speculation such as what “one might expect” a legislature\nto do, id., is not evidence of discriminatory purpose.

The\nfit between the law’s goals and provisions does not show it was enacted with\ndiscriminatory intent.\n      Fifth, the district court identified no reliable legislative history or\ncontemporary statements that reveal discriminatory purpose. “The legislative\nor administrative history may be highly relevant, especially where there are\ncontemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body, minutes of\nits meetings, or reports.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268. “In some\nextraordinary instances the members might be called . . . to testify concerning\nthe purpose of the official action . . . .” Id.

The primary evidence cited by the plurality\nis that “[t]he record shows that drafters and proponents of SB 14 were aware\nof the likely disproportionate effect of the law on minorities . . . .” Id. at 22.

Pullman-\nStandard, 456 U.S. at 292.\n      The plurality also overlooks the total absence of direct evidence of a\ndiscriminatory purpose and the effect of plaintiffs’ failure to unearth such\nevidence—despite repeated assertions that such evidence exists. The district\ncourt allowed plaintiffs to develop an extensive discovery record that included\nthousands of documents, numerous and lengthy depositions, and confidential\nemail communications, all on plaintiffs’ assertion that such discovery would\noffer critical evidence of discriminatory motive. In the end, this intrusive\nsearch—typically reserved only for “extraordinary” cases—yielded no such\nevidence. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268. Despite no smoking gun that\nwould show discriminatory intent in the voluminous evidence, the plurality\nasserts that we should instead look to circumstantial evidence to infer intent,\nas an “invidious purpose” may be “hiding.” Op. at 30. The Court in Arlington\nHeights noted the need to consider circumstantial evidence in cases where\ntestimony by the actual decisionmakers was “barred by privilege.” 429 U.S. at\n268. But, as we found in Price v. Austin Independent School District, where\ndecisionmakers are called to testify about their actions and “the justifications\nadvanced in their testimony do not demonstrate a pretext for intentionally\ndiscriminatory actions, the logic of Arlington Heights suggests that the [direct]\nevidence . . . is actually stronger than the circumstantial evidence proffered\nby the plaintiffs.” 945 F.2d at 1318. Here too, the direct evidence, and plaintiffs’\nfailure to demonstrate discriminatory purpose from it, overwhelmingly favor a\nfinding of no discriminatory intent.

Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279.\n      The record below was fully developed. Because plaintiffs “simply failed\nto carry their burden of proving that discriminatory purpose was a motivating\nfactor in the [Legislature’s] decision,” the district court should not be allowed\nto conduct any re-weighing of the evidence.

The extensive history of obstruction\nby opponents of voter ID legislation accounts for the procedures employed to\nensure passage of SB 14, and none of the circumstantial evidence relied on by\nJudge Haynes’s opinion suggests that the Legislature acted on the basis of\nracism. 2 Judgment therefore should be rendered in favor of the State on\nPlaintiffs’ discriminatory purpose claim.\n\n\n\n       1  Part IV of Judge Haynes’s opinion correctly vacates the district court’s opinion and\nrenders judgment in the State’s favor on Plaintiffs’ claim that SB 14 imposes an\nunconstitutional poll tax.

Nor does the\nexistence of societal economic disparities render SB 14 unlawful. See Frank,\n\n\n\n       5 To establish a § 2 claim, Plaintiffs must first show that SB 14 abridges or denies an\nindividual’s ability to vote. After an exhaustive statewide search, Plaintiffs identified three\nindividuals who could not vote at one time because they lacked qualifying ID. None is now\nprevented from voting. Two of the three individuals are eligible to vote by mail and the third\nhas subsequently obtained a free election ID card. Out of the entire state of Texas, Plaintiffs\nhave not produced anyone who cannot vote today because of SB 14’s requirements. The\nburden to prove discriminatory effect lies with Plaintiffs. Without a denial or abridgement,\nno § 2 claim can stand.\n                                             188\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 189   Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n768 F.3d at 753 (“Section 2(a) forbids discrimination by ‘race or color’ but does\nnot require states to overcome societal effects of private discrimination that\naffect the income or wealth of potential voters.”).\n      The contrary approach taken by Judge Haynes’s opinion improperly\nwould permit challenges to virtually all aspects of the voting process simply\nbecause poverty adds to the burdens of everyday activities and wealth\ndistribution is unequal across racial groups. This distorts the § 2 analysis and\nraises serious constitutional questions. Cf. Inclusive Cmtys., 135 S.

The requirements imposed by SB 14 are\nnot outside the usual inconveniences expected of citizens exercising their right\nto vote, and, as in Crawford, they provide no basis for overturning a race-\nneutral law by which the State seeks to prevent in-person voter fraud. See id.\nat 196 (“[T]he interest in orderly administration and accurate recordkeeping\nprovides a sufficient justification for carefully identifying all voters\nparticipating in the election process.”).\n      Simply put, Plaintiffs have not shown that SB 14 had any effect on voter\nturnout, that any disparity in ID possession among racial groups was caused\nby SB 14, or that a single Texan is prevented from voting by SB 14.\nAccordingly, I would vacate the district court’s opinion and render judgment\nfor the State.\n\n\n                                       189\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 190     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nGREGG COSTA, Circuit Judge, dissenting from Part II(A)(1):\n       The six years of debate in the Texas Legislature before voter ID passed\ndemonstrates that it is a controversial political question. The opinions issued\ntoday demonstrate it also raises contentious legal questions. And with respect\nto how to assess vote denial (as opposed to vote dilution) claims under the\n“effects” test of the Voting Rights Act, it is a difficult one. Although I join the\nmajority opinion affirming the district court’s holding that the Texas law has\ndiscriminatory effects in violation of the Act, the Gingles factors are not a\nperfect fit for the vote denial claims that have blossomed in the post-Shelby\nCounty world. But for the reasons set forth in the majority opinion and Judge\nHigginson’s concurring opinion, it is the best guidance we have for evaluating\nsuch cases.\n           In contrast to the uncertain legal terrain for the discriminatory effects\nclaim, the discriminatory purpose claim can be resolved through application of\ntwo entrenched legal principles: the deference that appellate courts owe to\nfactfinders and the Arlington Heights framework for evaluating circumstantial\nevidence of discriminatory purpose. 1 See Pullman-Standard v.

Op. at 18, does not defer to that finding? There are two: the district court\nrelied “too heavily on the evidence of State-sponsored discrimination dating\nback hundreds of years” and “on post-enactment speculation by opponents of\nSB 14.” Maj. Op. at 13, 16. As discussed below, however, virtually none of this\nevidence that the majority opinion critiques appears in the district court’s\n\n\n       8  Because these cases often have such a significant impact (the instant case involves\na law setting voting requirements for a state of more than 25 million people), it may be\nnatural to be hesitant about giving a single district judge so much discretion in deciding the\nfate of a law. Indeed, it used to be the case that lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of\na state or federal law had to be heard by three-judge panels. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2281, 2282\n(repealed 1976). For better or worse, Congress did away with that system in 1976. Act of\nAug. 12, 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-381, 90 Stat. 1119; see also 17A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT &\nARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 4235 (3d ed.) (discussing history,\npurpose, and current status of Congressionally required three-judge panels). With these\ncases now being decided by a single judge as most others are, there is no basis for altering\nthe level of deference based on the subject matter of the case.\n        9 In the context of private Title VII suits, discriminatory intent was the disputed issue\n\nin two of the leading Supreme Court cases emphasizing the deference that district courts are\nowed on questions of fact.

As legal support for the view that the\ndistrict court gave too much weight to “long-ago history,” the majority opinion\nrelies principally on Shelby County v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"931614\"><a href=\"/opinion/931614/shelby-county-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Shelby County held that Congress exceeded its power under\nthe Fifteenth Amendment in subjecting nine states to the “extraordinary\nmeasure[]” of having to preclear every change in voting laws. Id. at 2619. It\nfound Congress’s formula for selecting these states unconstitutional because it\nrelied on “decades-old data and eradicated practices,” in particular the use of\nliteracy tests which had long been abolished and voter registration and turnout\nnumbers that had “risen dramatically” since 1965 when the Voting Rights Act\nwas first enacted. Id. at 2627.\n      Shelby County was not a case about purposeful discrimination under the\nFourteenth Amendment or Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It makes no\nmention of Arlington Heights. For those reasons alone, Shelby County should\nnot be used to curtail the use of an Arlington Heights factor. See Rodriguez de\nQuijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112261\"><a href=\"/opinion/112261/rodriguez-de-quijas-v-shearsonamerican-express-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent\nof this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons\nrejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the\ncase which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of\noverturning its own decisions.”).\n      But even if we did have the freedom to engage in a law review-like debate\nabout what Shelby County foretells for the use of history as circumstantial\nevidence under Arlington Heights, history is being used very differently in the\ntwo contexts. Shelby County rejected the use of 50-year-old history alone to\n                                        193\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530         Page: 194     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nimpose the “stringent” requirement of preclearance.                    That preclearance\nrequirement, which applied to new laws carrying no hint of unconstitutionality\n(even ones that increased access to voting), was an exception to the normal\npractice of using “case-by-case litigation” to enforce constitutional rights. 133\nS. Ct. at 2624. In the example of case-by-case litigation here that seeks to\nestablish a current constitutional violation, Arlington Heights just says that\nhistory is one of many factors that may be considered. And it’s not just any\nhistory that courts should consider, but a historical background that “reveals\na series of official actions taken for invidious purposes.” Arlington Heights, 429\nU.S. at 267.\n       That type of pattern-or-practice evidence exists here. As the majority\nopinion recognizes, most of the discriminatory laws the district court\nrecounted—all-white Democratic primaries; literacy tests; poll taxes; and the\nannual re-registration requirement that Texas imposed after the poll tax was\nabolished—were justified with the same interest cited for voter ID: prevention\nof voter fraud. Maj. Op. at 22–23. Another thread, again recognized by the\nmajority opinion, running from prior restrictive voting laws to SB 14 is that\nthey have typically been enacted (by both political parties) in response to a\nperception of increased voting power by emerging demographic groups. 10 Maj.\nOp. 29–30 & n.30; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court thus did not just\nsay “there was discrimination in the past, so there must be discrimination\ntoday;” it tied historical patterns to features of the law being challenged, as\nArlington Heights contemplates.\n\n\n        This historical practice is not limited to Texas or other southern states. In response\n       10\n\nto the growth of Irish immigrants who tended to favor Democrats, the Know-Nothing\nmovement led to the passage of more restrictive voting laws in Connecticut, Massachusetts,\nand New York during the 1850s. See ALEXANDER KEYSSAR, THE RIGHT TO VOTE: THE\nCONTESTED HISTORY OF DEMOCRACY IN THE UNITED STATES 68 (rev. ed. 2009).\n                                            194\n\f   Case: 14-41127     Document: 00513601530      Page: 195     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-41127\n      Despite recognizing that this connection was made with respect to both\nthe voter fraud rationale and historical practice of enacting voting restrictions\nin response to potential increases in minority voting strength, the majority\nopinion nonetheless holds that the district court relied too much on “evidence\nof State-sponsored discrimination dating back hundreds of years.” Maj. Op. at\n13. To be sure, historical evidence limited to the nineteenth century is of “little\nprobative value.”     McCleskey v. Kemp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111869\"><a href=\"/opinion/111869/mccleskey-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298 n.20 (1987)\n(discounting, under Arlington Heights, historical evidence focused only on\n“Georgia laws in force during and just after the Civil War” because it was not\nreasonably contemporaneous with enactment of the challenged law). But I just\ndon’t see that the district court’s finding of discriminatory purpose relied on\nsuch history at all, let alone to a significant degree.\n      The majority opinion’s contrary view seems to flow from its scrutiny of\nthe entire district court opinion for any references to evidence that may not be\nprobative of discriminatory intent. But the district court had before it not just\nthe purpose question, but claims involving discriminatory effects, impact on\nFirst Amendment interests under the Anderson/Burdick balancing test, and\nwhether the voter ID imposed a poll tax. As is customary with bench trial\nrulings, the district court first summarized the testimony and facts from the\nentire trial. Only after that discussion, which was lengthy given the vast\nrecord, did it proceed to analyze the particular claims and identify the evidence\nthat supported its legal conclusions for each.            In reviewing the factual\nsufficiency of the finding of discriminatory purpose, our review should focus on\nthe district court’s analysis of that particular claim.\n       One looking at that section of the district court’s decision after reading\ntoday’s opinions with their focus on history would be surprised that this is the\nonly mention of it:\n                                       195\n\f    Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530           Page: 196       Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                         No. 14-41127\n       Historical Background. As amply demonstrated, the Texas Legislature\n       has a long history of discriminatory voting practices. To put the current\n       events into perspective, Texas was going through a seismic demographic\n       shift at the time the legislature began considering voter ID laws.\n       Hispanics and African–Americans accounted for 78.7% of Texas’s total\n       population growth between 2000 and 2010. In addition, it was during\n       this time that Texas first became a majority-minority state, with Anglos\n       no longer comprising a majority of the state’s population. As previously\n       discussed, this Court gives great weight to the findings of Dr. Lichtman\n       that ‘[t]he combination of these demographic trends and polarized voting\n       patterns . . . demonstrate that Republicans in Texas are inevitably\n       facing a declining voter base and can gain partisan advantage by\n       suppressing the overwhelmingly Democratic votes of African–\n       Americans and Latinos.’\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The natural\nreading of this single paragraph is that the general first sentence is providing\nbackground, and it is only the demographic changes that the court is citing as\nthe Arlington Heights context for “the current events.” The majority opinion\nnot only finds no error with this latter conclusion, but endorses its relevance.\nMaj. Op. at 29–30.\n       Even if one reads the footnote at the end of the first sentence as fully\nincorporating the opening section of the opinion that chronicles “Texas’s\nhistory with respect to racial disparity in voting rights,” 11 id. at 700 n.535\n(citing id. at 633–39), I don’t see that historical overview as error. 12 Not so\nlong ago, the Supreme Court recited the same history of voting rights in Texas:\n\n\n       11  Because the opening sentence of the paragraph just refers to the Texas Legislature’s\nhistory of enacting discriminatory voting laws, there is no plausible reading that would allow\nit to incorporate prior summaries of testimony in the opinion that involve the discriminatory\nvoting acts of a single county (Waller County), another item the majority opinion criticizes.\n        12 The only parts of that section that refer to events “dating back hundreds of years”\n\nare a benign introductory statement that “On the heels of Reconstruction, freed slaves and\nother minority men were just gaining access to the right to vote,” and headings for topics\nlike the poll tax and literacy tests that, owing to the duty of historical accuracy, list the entire\nperiod they were in existence (“1905–1970: Literacy and ‘Secret Ballot’ Restrictions”; “1902–\n1966: Poll Taxes”). </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The history of official discrimination in the Texas\n      election process—stretching back to Reconstruction—led to the\n      inclusion of the State as a covered jurisdiction under Section 5 in the\n      1975 amendments to the Voting Rights Act.

The only legislator quoted is not an opponent, but bill supporter Todd\nSmith who admitted it was “common sense” that voter ID would have\ndisproportionate effects on racial minorities. Id. The majority opinion cites\nthat testimony as relevant evidence for the purpose claim. Maj. Op. at 22.\nThat leaves only the district court’s conclusion that the 2011 legislative session\nwas racially charged in light of other pending legislation, id. at 702, which\nseems like an inference a factfinder should be entitled to draw.\n      But even if not, with that factual finding being the only one specifically\nmentioned in the district court’s discussion of discriminatory purpose with\nwhich the majority opinion finds fault, it does not seem like a sufficient basis\nfor reaching “a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed”\nas to the ultimate finding.

That is\nespecially so when the majority opinion endorses the district court’s reliance\non just about all the other evidence it actually did cite in assessing the\nArlington Heights factors. See Maj. Op. at 21–30. In light of that discussion\nand the district court opinion, there is no value in repeating that evidence here.\nThe only thing to add is that the district court correctly recognized that the\ndiscriminatory impact of the law (for which the majority opinion finds\nsufficient evidentiary support on the “effects” claim and which even Judge\nJones’s dissent does not dispute, see Jones Dissent at 5) can also be considered\nin evaluating discriminatory purpose.

I would\ntherefore conclude that there was sufficient evidence from which the district\ncourt could have reasonably concluded that the law was enacted with a\ndiscriminatory purpose, even if, as is usually the case in hotly contested trials,\nthere is also evidence to support the opposite view.\n       Vacating the finding of discriminatory purpose not only is at odds with\nthe deference owed the factfinder, but also causes delay in the ultimate\nresolution of this case that could impose significant costs.

It is that uncertainty over voting\nrequirements that some studies—including a recent joint study from Rice\nUniversity’s Baker Institute for Public Policy and the University of Houston’s\nHobby Center for Public Policy—have found to be one of the more significant\nways in which voter ID laws depress turnout. See MARK JONES, ET. AL., THE\nTEXAS VOTER ID LAW AND THE 2014 ELECTION: A STUDY OF TEXAS’S 23RD\nCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 13 (2015) (noting that its study of voter turnout\nunder SB 14 “suggest[s] that the most significant impact of the current Texas\nvoter ID law is confusion and subsequently depressed voter turnout”).\n\n\n                                           * * *\n       Reluctance to hold that a legislature passed a law with a discriminatory\npurpose is understandable. Maj. Op. 12 (“We acknowledge the charged nature\nof accusations of racism, particularly against a legislative body . . . .”). Yet\ncourts are called upon all the time to decide difficult questions about whether\nstate legislatures or Congress have violated other important constitutional\nvalues like, taking the First Amendment as just one example, the right to free\nspeech or free exercise of religion. When we find that they have done so, it\ndoesn’t exactly cast those lawmakers in the best of light.\n       It is also important to note that affirming the finding of discriminatory\npurpose 14 would not be the inflammatory “racial name-calling” that Judge\nJones’s dissent suggests. Jones Dissent at 1. Such a finding, although one of\ngrave importance, is not tantamount to a finding that the law had a “racist\n\n\n       14 It’s also worth again emphasizing that unlike the findings of constitutional\nviolations we usually make in cases that present purely legal questions, affirming the district\ncourt here would not be a direct ruling from this court that the law was passed with a\ndiscriminatory purpose, only that there was evidence from which a factfinder could draw that\nconclusion.\n                                             200\n\f   Case: 14-41127        Document: 00513601530          Page: 201     Date Filed: 07/20/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-41127\nmotivation.” Id. at 3; Elrod Dissent at 1 (characterizing question as whether\n“the Legislature acted on the basis of racism”); see also Maj. Op. at 12–13 (also\nindicating that such a finding requires a showing of “racism”). As Judge\nKozinski explained in a decision upholding a district court determination that\na discriminatory purpose motivated a Los Angeles county reapportionment\nplan, nothing in an opinion finding discriminatory purpose needs to even\n“suggest[]” that lawmakers “harbored any ethnic or racial animus.” Garza v.\nCnty. of Los Angeles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 778 (9th Cir. 1990) (Kozinski, J.,\nconcurring) (explaining that “there is no indication that what the district court\nfound to be intentional discrimination was based on any dislike, mistrust,\nhatred or bigotry against Hispanics or any other minority group”). 15 The\n\n\n       15 Judge Jones’s dissent states that Garza is one of only a handful of cases in recent\ndecades finding that a law was enacted with a discriminatory purpose.

For the nine covered states (a number of counties from other states were\nalso subject to preclearance), there was little incentive for a challenger to bring a claim of\npurposeful discrimination prior to Shelby County. One of the requirements for preclearance\nwas for the public entity enacting the change to disprove that the voting change had a\ndiscriminatory purpose or effects. Reno v.
