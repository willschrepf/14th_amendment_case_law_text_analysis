APPELLATE DIVISION\n\nNEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF\nCORRECTIONS,\n\n     Respondent.\n_________________________\n\n         Argued June 16, 2016 – Decided August 11, 2016\n\n         Before Judges Fuentes, Koblitz and Gilson.\n\n         On appeal from the New Jersey Department of\n         Corrections.\n\n         Alexander   Shalom  argued   the  cause  for\n         appellant (American Civil Liberties Union of\n         New   Jersey   Foundation,   attorneys;  Mr.\n         Shalom, Edward Barocas, Jeanne LoCicero, and\n         Rebecca Livengood, on the brief; Rigoberto\n         Mejia, on the pro se brief).\n\n         Joseph Micheletti, Assistant Chief Deputy\n         Attorney General, argued the cause for\n         respondent (Robert Lougy, Acting Attorney\n         General,   attorney;   Lisa   A.   Puglisi,\n         Assistant Attorney General, of counsel;\n         Dianne M. Moratti, Deputy Attorney General,\n         and Alex J. Zowin, Deputy Attorney General,\n         on the briefs).\n\n     The opinion of the court was delivered by\n\nKOBLITZ, J.A.D.\n\f     In this prison disciplinary appeal, Rigoberto Mejia argues\n\nthat the sanction of three and one-half years in administrative\n\nsegregation was improper.        Mejia is a prisoner at New Jersey\n\nState    Prison   currently   serving   a   sentence    with   a    mandatory\n\nminimum of forty years imposed in 1995 for murder and associated\n\ncrimes.      Mejia   was   originally   sentenced      to   death    for   the\n\nshooting of another undocumented worker over $750 in December\n\n1991.1    Mejia, who is now fifty-seven years old and whose first\n\neligibility for parole is in 2031, appeals from an August 8,\n\n2013 disciplinary action taken against him by the New Jersey\n\n\n\n\n1\n  In State v. Mejia, 141 N.J. 475, 485-86 (1995), our Supreme\nCourt reversed Mejia's death penalty sentence, holding jury\ninstructions were required, in the guilt phase, on the ultimate\noutcome of a conviction of murder with the intent to kill–\ncapital murder—versus murder with the intent to cause serious\nbodily injury—which is not death-eligible.    The Court held the\ninstruction should advise the jury that it could return a non-\nunanimous guilty verdict as to the mental state of a defendant\nwho the jury unanimously found had committed a homicide. Id. at\n486.   If the jury was not unanimous as to the mens rea, the\ndefendant would then not be eligible for the death penalty.\nIbid.    The holding in Mejia was no longer authoritative\nfollowing the 1992 New Jersey constitutional amendment.      See\nState v. Cooper, 151 N.J. 326, 376-77 (1997), cert. denied, 528\nU.S. 1084, 120 S. Ct. 809, 145 L. Ed. 2d 681 (2000).         The\nLegislature later repealed the death penalty in 2007. See State\nv. Troxell, 434 N.J. Super. 502, 510 (App. Div.) (explaining the\nlegislative action), certif. denied, 221 N.J. 285 (2014).\n\n\n\n                                    2                                A-0710-13T4\n\fDepartment        of   Corrections      (DOC).2         We   reverse        the   sanction\n\nimposed because it was arbitrary and unreasonable.\n\n       On July 15, 2013, Mejia threw a bucket of hot water, urine\n\nand feces on a corrections officer who was walking by his cell.\n\nThe substance also made contact with another corrections officer\n\nwho    was     below   Mejia's     cell.        Mejia    claimed       he   had   done   so\n\nbecause he was fearful that the \"officer wanted to jump him.\"\n\n       A five-man extraction team was called to remove Mejia from\n\nhis cell.          Initially, officers were unable to enter the cell\n\nbecause Mejia had tied a bedsheet to the door, which had to be\n\ncut by the responding officers.                    Officers also utilized \"OC\n\nspray,\"       a   chemical     agent,      to    subdue      Mejia      before    finally\n\nextracting him.\n\n       Mejia was charged with several asterisk offenses:3 1) two\n\ncounts       of   *.012,     \"throwing     bodily       fluid     at    any   person      or\n\notherwise purposely subjecting such person to contact with a\n\nbodily fluid\"; 2) *.154, \"tampering with or blocking any locking\n\ndevice\"; and 3) *.306, \"conduct which disrupts or interferes\n\nwith     the      security    or   orderly       running     of      the    correctional\n\n2\n  We hereby grant the DOC's June 14, 2016 motion to supplement\nthe record with certifications and documents relating to Mejia's\nmental health screening.\n3\n  Asterisk offenses \"are considered the most serious and result\nin the most severe sanctions.\"       N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(a); see\nN.J.A.C. 10A:4-5.1(a) (providing the schedule of sanctions for\nasterisk offenses).\n\n\n\n                                            3                                     A-0710-13T4\n\ffacility.\"    See N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(a).            At the administrative\n\nhearing, Mejia pled guilty to one charge of throwing                    bodily\n\nfluid on a person, and not guilty on the remaining charges.\n\nAlthough   Mejia    waived   counsel       substitute,    according    to    the\n\nhearing officer's adjudication Form 259-A, a counsel substitute\n\nwas present for \"translation purposes.\"            Following the hearing,\n\nMejia was adjudicated guilty on all four charges.\n\n     The hearing officer sanctioned Mejia to the maximum period\n\nof administrative segregation4 on each charge, all consecutive to\n\neach other.       On the first bodily fluid charge, Mejia received\n\nfifteen    days    of   disciplinary       detention,    365   days   loss   of\n\ncommutation time, 365 days of administrative segregation, and 90\n\ndays loss of television, phone and radio privileges.                   On the\n\n4\n  The DOC argues \"solitary confinement\" does not exist in the New\nJersey state penal system and did not exist at the time Mejia\nwas sanctioned.      \"Administrative segregation\" is defined as\n\"removal of an inmate from the general population of a\ncorrectional facility to a close custody unit because of one or\nmore    disciplinary    infractions    or    other   administrative\nconsiderations.\"      N.J.A.C. 10A:1-2.2.        The DOC contends\nadministrative segregation is not solitary confinement because\ninmates have access to several services, including \"five hours\nof recreation outside of [their] cell each week\" and regular\nreviews by the mental health staff through the locked cell door.\nMejia's mental health records reflect he attended one group\nsession for stress management while housed on administrative\nsegregation for more than two-and-one-half years. \"Disciplinary\ndetention\" is the \"removal of an inmate from the general\npopulation to a short-term close custody unit because of a\ndisciplinary infraction(s).\"     Ibid.    We were informed at oral\nargument that during disciplinary detention an inmate has no\naccess to group sessions, recreation or privileges.\n\n\n\n                                       4                              A-0710-13T4\n\fsecond       bodily     fluid     charge,     Mejia       received        fifteen   days    of\n\ndisciplinary detention, 365 days loss of commutation time, 365\n\ndays administrative segregation, and 30 days loss of recreation\n\nprivileges.           On the tampering with a locking device charge,\n\nMejia received time served in disciplinary detention, 180 days\n\nloss     of     commutation          time,         180        days   of     administrative\n\nsegregation,          and    30     days     loss        of     recreation     privileges.\n\nFinally, for the conduct that disrupts charge Mejia received\n\ntime     served       in     disciplinary          detention         and    365     days    of\n\nadministrative segregation.                  The hearing officer ran all of the\n\nsanctions consecutively, other than the disciplinary detention\n\nsanctions.        Mejia's sanctions totaled 30 days of disciplinary\n\ndetention; 910 days loss of commutation time; 90 days loss of\n\ntelevision,       phone       and    radio       privileges;         60     days    loss    of\n\nrecreation        privileges;          and       1275         days   of     administrative\n\nsegregation.\n\n       Under      the       \"reasons       for      sanctions\"         portion      of     the\n\nadjudication form, the hearing officer noted Mejia \"must be held\n\nresponsible for his actions,\" the behavior was \"disgusting,\" and\n\nit     had    caused        the   corrections            officers     to     seek    medical\n\nattention.        Although the two officers were medically examined,\n\nthe record contains no evidence of any injuries to either of\n\nthem due to this incident.\n\n\n\n\n                                               5                                     A-0710-13T4\n\f      On July 22, 2013, Mejia filed an administrative appeal of\n\nthe   disciplinary     decision     written     in    Spanish.        Within    three\n\nweeks, the Assistant Superintendent of New Jersey State Prison\n\nupheld the decisions regarding both the adjudication and the\n\nsanctions in general language without directly addressing any\n\nissue raised.        In the \"explanation\" portion of the form, the\n\nAssistant    Superintendent        stated:      \"My   review     of    this     issue\n\nreveals     that    there    was    compliance        with     the     New     Jersey\n\nAdministrative       Code   on   inmate      discipline,       which    prescribes\n\nprocedural     safeguards,         and    the     charge       was     adjudicated\n\naccordingly.       The preponderance of evidence presented supports\n\nthe decision of the Hearing Officer and the sanction rendered is\n\nappropriate.       There appears to be no violation of standards.\"\n\n      In October 2013, Mejia filed an appeal to this court.                        Six\n\nmonths later, the DOC filed a successful motion for a remand to\n\nreconsider Mejia's administrative appeal after its translation\n\ninto English.       On June 6, 2014, after the appeal was translated,\n\nthe Office of the Administrator for New Jersey State Prison\n\nagain upheld the hearing officer's decision, this time rejecting\n\nthe specific arguments raised by Mejia almost a year earlier.5\n\n\n5\n  Mejia argued that, contrary to the hearing officer's report, he\nasked for a staff member legal representative at the hearing,\nand told the hearing officer that he had only seven years of\nschooling and did not understand English well.     He stated the\n                                                      (continued)\n\n\n                                         6                                   A-0710-13T4\n\f      In his pro se appeal to this court Mejia argued he had\n\nmental     health    needs      and    had    not     received     the     mental    health\n\nscreening required by N.J.A.C. 10A:4-9.5(c)(2), which requires\n\nthat a list of inmates with a pending disciplinary infraction be\n\nforwarded to the \"Mental Health Unit for a determination as to\n\nwhich inmates should be considered special needs inmates.\"                                 The\n\nDOC   responded       to    this      issue      in     its   initial      brief    in     one\n\nparagraph, stating \"there is no evidence of mental health issues\n\nand Mejia is not a special needs inmate,\" citing to notations by\n\nthe   hearing    officer         on    DOC    forms      stating    \"no     evid.     of    MH\n\n[(mental health)].\"             We sua sponte ordered the American Civil\n\nLiberties Union, with its consent, to represent Mejia on appeal\n\nand file a supplemental brief on his behalf.\n\n      In    response       to    Mejia's      supplemental         brief    raising        the\n\nargument      that    he        suffered      from       mental    illness         and     was\n\nparticularly     vulnerable           to   the    negative      effects     of   long-term\n\nsolitary confinement in administrative segregation, the DOC for\n\nthe   first    time    revealed        Mejia      had    been   screened      for    mental\n\nhealth issues and was routinely reviewed, albeit in a cursory\n\nfashion, pursuant to the settlement of a federal case in 1999.\n\nSee D.M. v. Terhune, 67 F. Supp. 2d 401, 403-05 (D.N.J. 1999).\n\n\n(continued)\ninmate interpreter was only available at the end of the hearing,\nand he was denied the material and time to prepare.\n\n\n\n                                              7                                     A-0710-13T4\n\fThe DOC further informed us at oral argument that, pursuant to\n\nan   August      14,   2015   \"Request     for   Rule   Exemption\" 6      (Rule\n\nExemption), Mejia had been returned to the general population\n\nhousing at an unknown date prior to oral argument, but after\n\nFebruary    8,   2016,   when   the   records    reflect   he   remained       in\n\nadministrative segregation.        The Rule Exemption, submitted to us\n\nafter     oral   argument,    eliminated    disciplinary    detention        and\n\nlimited     administrative      segregation      \"for   multiple   offenses\n\nimposed as a result of the same incident\" to 365 days.                       The\n\nRule Exemption also states:\n\n                 Studies have shown that isolation,\n            under   certain  circumstances,   exacerbates\n            mental health deterioration.    As such, the\n            elimination of [disciplinary] detention, and\n            the immediate transport of an inmate to a\n            less restrictive administrative segregation\n            unit upon adjudication, will have a positive\n            impact on the inmate population.\n\n                 Similarly,     maximizing inmate exposure\n            to no more than      365 days of administrative\n            segregation per      incident, rather than per\n            infraction, will     decrease the likelihood of\n            isolation.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  N.J.A.C. 10A:1-2.4 authorizes the Commissioner to \"relax and\nexempt   rules  and   regulations  for   the  administration   of\ncorrectional facilities . . . within the Department of\nCorrections\" to avoid \"undue hardship, unfairness or injustice.\"\nAlthough the DOC provided a document titled \"Request for Rule\nExemption,\" and counsel stated at oral argument that a Rule\nExemption had been applied to Mejia, we were not supplied with\nany official document designated as an approval of this request.\n\n\n\n                                      8                                A-0710-13T4\n\fThe Rule Exemption attachments include \"a replacement list of\n\nprohibited acts found in N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(a)\" separating \"the\n\noriginal list into the 5 new Categories from the Rule Exemption\"\n\nincluding      \"the   applicable         number   of    days    of    Administrative\n\nSegregation     per    category.\"          The    sanction      range      for     *.012,\n\n\"Throwing bodily fluid at any person,\" is 181 to 365 days.                             The\n\nother two infractions for which Mejia was convicted carry a\n\nsanction range of 91 to 180 days.                      Thus, the infraction of\n\n*.306, \"conduct which disrupts or interferes with the security\n\nor   orderly    running     of    the     correctional       facility,\"      has     been\n\ndowngraded to an infraction carrying a possible sanction of no\n\nmore than 180 days in administrative segregation rather than the\n\n365 days Mejia received.\n\n       The scope of our review of an agency decision is limited.\n\nCapital Health Sys., Inc. v.

The DOC regulations include\n\nfactors to be utilized in imposing sanctions, but unfortunately\n\nleave the use of those or other \"such factors\" entirely to the\n\ndiscretion of the hearing officer.                See N.J.A.C. 10A:4-9.17(a).\n\nThe hearing officer adjudication form has a section for the\n\npurpose of stating the reasons for the sanction.                          Prior to the\n\ntranslation     of   Mejia's   appeal,      the    DOC's       generic      affirmance\n\nacknowledged the sanction imposed must be equitable, stating,\n\n\n\n\n                                       13                                     A-0710-13T4\n\f\"the sanction rendered is appropriate.\"                      For a sentence to be\n\n\"appropriate,\" it is not enough that the sentence be within the\n\nmaximum limits set forth in the Administrative Code.                          With such\n\ntotally discretionary sanctioning factors, a hearing officer is\n\nnot guided to distinguish among inmates convicted of the same\n\ninfraction,      as    evidenced      by   the    articulated       reasons     for   the\n\nmaximum     period     of    isolation       imposed    on   Mejia.         Without   any\n\nregulation requiring the articulation of sanctioning factors, we\n\nhave   no    way      to    review    whether     a    sanction        is   imposed   for\n\npermissible      reasons      and     is   located     at    an   appropriate       point\n\nwithin the allowable range.                  See In re Issuance of Permit by\n\nDep't of Envtl.

Under\n\ncurrent rules Mejia could not have been sanctioned to more than\n\na total of 365 days of administrative segregation.         He could not\n\nhave received any time in disciplinary detention.          He has thus\n\nserved more than the maximum sanction presently available.              We\n\nreverse the penalties imposed on Mejia, but affirm his guilt.\n\n    Mejia raises two other issues in his appeal: the quality of\n\nthe mental health screening and mental health services he has\n\nbeen provided in prison, and the related issue of whether an\n\ninterpreter was provided to him to allow him to take advantage\n\nof the mental health services otherwise available.8         The record\n\n\n8\n   Following oral argument, the DOC provided us with a document\ntitled \"Health Services Unit Internal Management Procedures\"\nspecific to \"Privacy of Care\" that states: \"For inmates with\nspecial communication needs staff will obtain permission from\nthe inmate for use of an interpreter or telephonic translation\nservice and arrange for such services.\"    Mejia's actual mental\nhealth records reflect he was provided an interpreter for a\nmental health check-up on May 6, 2016, but had not been provided\none for psychological check-ups previously.    In April 2012 the\nsocial worker recorded that Mejia's \"[E]nglish is not so good\n.   .    .   It   became   clear   that    he    had   difficulty\nunderstanding/communicating in [E]nglish.    I was going to see\nhim with a translator later today, but in looking through the\nEMR [(electronic medical records)] it became clear that he does\nspeak [E]nglish.\" In January 2013 the records reflect Mejia had\nrejected the offer of an interpreter.

Mental health screening at times was performed through\n\na   locked     cell    door    in    English,        during    which     Mejia       was\n\nunresponsive     to    the    questions     asked      by     the     mental    health\n\nprofessional.      Based on this \"data\" Mejia was determined to be\n\noriented in all spheres and not delusional.                     We do not have a\n\nsufficient record to review the mental health services provided\n\nto Mejia against a legally required standard for prison inmates.\n\nNo hearing has been conducted; no experts have prepared reports\n\nor testified.\n\n     Not     denying    his    commission       of     at     least    one     of    the\n\ninfractions from the beginning of the appellate process, Mejia\n\nsought relief from the penalty imposed.                We have given Mejia the\n\nrelief he requested.          As is true all too often, the time taken\n\nin this appeal, including the time necessitated by the failure\n\nof the DOC to translate Mejia's agency appeal initially, has\n\nnullified any practical effect of this relief.                      Nonetheless, we\n\nanticipate     that    the    requirement     for      the     consideration         and\n\narticulation     of    sanctioning    factors    by     hearing       officers      this\n\nopinion imposes will assure the sanctioning of state prisoners\n\nbecomes more \"fair and equitable,\" a stated goal of the DOC.\n\n\n(continued)\n294 N.J.

Initially, officers were unable to enter the cell\n\nbecause Mejia had tied a bedsheet to the door, which had to be\n\ncut by the responding officers.                    Officers also utilized \"OC\n\nspray,\"       a   chemical     agent,      to    subdue      Mejia      before    finally\n\nextracting him.\n\n       Mejia was charged with several asterisk offenses:3 1) two\n\ncounts       of   *.012,     \"throwing     bodily       fluid     at    any   person      or\n\notherwise purposely subjecting such person to contact with a\n\nbodily fluid\"; 2) *.154, \"tampering with or blocking any locking\n\ndevice\"; and 3) *.306, \"conduct which disrupts or interferes\n\nwith     the      security    or   orderly       running     of      the    correctional\n\n2\n  We hereby grant the DOC's June 14, 2016 motion to supplement\nthe record with certifications and documents relating to Mejia's\nmental health screening.\n3\n  Asterisk offenses \"are considered the most serious and result\nin the most severe sanctions.\"       N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(a); see\nN.J.A.C. 10A:4-5.1(a) (providing the schedule of sanctions for\nasterisk offenses).\n\n\n\n                                            3                                     A-0710-13T4\n\ffacility.\"    See N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(a).            At the administrative\n\nhearing, Mejia pled guilty to one charge of throwing                    bodily\n\nfluid on a person, and not guilty on the remaining charges.\n\nAlthough   Mejia    waived   counsel       substitute,    according    to    the\n\nhearing officer's adjudication Form 259-A, a counsel substitute\n\nwas present for \"translation purposes.\"            Following the hearing,\n\nMejia was adjudicated guilty on all four charges.\n\n     The hearing officer sanctioned Mejia to the maximum period\n\nof administrative segregation4 on each charge, all consecutive to\n\neach other.       On the first bodily fluid charge, Mejia received\n\nfifteen    days    of   disciplinary       detention,    365   days   loss   of\n\ncommutation time, 365 days of administrative segregation, and 90\n\ndays loss of television, phone and radio privileges.                   On the\n\n4\n  The DOC argues \"solitary confinement\" does not exist in the New\nJersey state penal system and did not exist at the time Mejia\nwas sanctioned.      \"Administrative segregation\" is defined as\n\"removal of an inmate from the general population of a\ncorrectional facility to a close custody unit because of one or\nmore    disciplinary    infractions    or    other   administrative\nconsiderations.\"      N.J.A.C. 10A:1-2.2.        The DOC contends\nadministrative segregation is not solitary confinement because\ninmates have access to several services, including \"five hours\nof recreation outside of [their] cell each week\" and regular\nreviews by the mental health staff through the locked cell door.\nMejia's mental health records reflect he attended one group\nsession for stress management while housed on administrative\nsegregation for more than two-and-one-half years. \"Disciplinary\ndetention\" is the \"removal of an inmate from the general\npopulation to a short-term close custody unit because of a\ndisciplinary infraction(s).\"     Ibid.    We were informed at oral\nargument that during disciplinary detention an inmate has no\naccess to group sessions, recreation or privileges.\n\n\n\n                                       4                              A-0710-13T4\n\fsecond       bodily     fluid     charge,     Mejia       received        fifteen   days    of\n\ndisciplinary detention, 365 days loss of commutation time, 365\n\ndays administrative segregation, and 30 days loss of recreation\n\nprivileges.           On the tampering with a locking device charge,\n\nMejia received time served in disciplinary detention, 180 days\n\nloss     of     commutation          time,         180        days   of     administrative\n\nsegregation,          and    30     days     loss        of     recreation     privileges.\n\nFinally, for the conduct that disrupts charge Mejia received\n\ntime     served       in     disciplinary          detention         and    365     days    of\n\nadministrative segregation.                  The hearing officer ran all of the\n\nsanctions consecutively, other than the disciplinary detention\n\nsanctions.        Mejia's sanctions totaled 30 days of disciplinary\n\ndetention; 910 days loss of commutation time; 90 days loss of\n\ntelevision,       phone       and    radio       privileges;         60     days    loss    of\n\nrecreation        privileges;          and       1275         days   of     administrative\n\nsegregation.\n\n       Under      the       \"reasons       for      sanctions\"         portion      of     the\n\nadjudication form, the hearing officer noted Mejia \"must be held\n\nresponsible for his actions,\" the behavior was \"disgusting,\" and\n\nit     had    caused        the   corrections            officers     to     seek    medical\n\nattention.        Although the two officers were medically examined,\n\nthe record contains no evidence of any injuries to either of\n\nthem due to this incident.\n\n\n\n\n                                               5                                     A-0710-13T4\n\f      On July 22, 2013, Mejia filed an administrative appeal of\n\nthe   disciplinary     decision     written     in    Spanish.        Within    three\n\nweeks, the Assistant Superintendent of New Jersey State Prison\n\nupheld the decisions regarding both the adjudication and the\n\nsanctions in general language without directly addressing any\n\nissue raised.        In the \"explanation\" portion of the form, the\n\nAssistant    Superintendent        stated:      \"My   review     of    this     issue\n\nreveals     that    there    was    compliance        with     the     New     Jersey\n\nAdministrative       Code   on   inmate      discipline,       which    prescribes\n\nprocedural     safeguards,         and    the     charge       was     adjudicated\n\naccordingly.       The preponderance of evidence presented supports\n\nthe decision of the Hearing Officer and the sanction rendered is\n\nappropriate.       There appears to be no violation of standards.\"\n\n      In October 2013, Mejia filed an appeal to this court.                        Six\n\nmonths later, the DOC filed a successful motion for a remand to\n\nreconsider Mejia's administrative appeal after its translation\n\ninto English.       On June 6, 2014, after the appeal was translated,\n\nthe Office of the Administrator for New Jersey State Prison\n\nagain upheld the hearing officer's decision, this time rejecting\n\nthe specific arguments raised by Mejia almost a year earlier.5\n\n\n5\n  Mejia argued that, contrary to the hearing officer's report, he\nasked for a staff member legal representative at the hearing,\nand told the hearing officer that he had only seven years of\nschooling and did not understand English well.     He stated the\n                                                      (continued)\n\n\n                                         6                                   A-0710-13T4\n\f      In his pro se appeal to this court Mejia argued he had\n\nmental     health    needs      and    had    not     received     the     mental    health\n\nscreening required by N.J.A.C. 10A:4-9.5(c)(2), which requires\n\nthat a list of inmates with a pending disciplinary infraction be\n\nforwarded to the \"Mental Health Unit for a determination as to\n\nwhich inmates should be considered special needs inmates.\"                                 The\n\nDOC   responded       to    this      issue      in     its   initial      brief    in     one\n\nparagraph, stating \"there is no evidence of mental health issues\n\nand Mejia is not a special needs inmate,\" citing to notations by\n\nthe   hearing    officer         on    DOC    forms      stating    \"no     evid.     of    MH\n\n[(mental health)].\"             We sua sponte ordered the American Civil\n\nLiberties Union, with its consent, to represent Mejia on appeal\n\nand file a supplemental brief on his behalf.\n\n      In    response       to    Mejia's      supplemental         brief    raising        the\n\nargument      that    he        suffered      from       mental    illness         and     was\n\nparticularly     vulnerable           to   the    negative      effects     of   long-term\n\nsolitary confinement in administrative segregation, the DOC for\n\nthe   first    time    revealed        Mejia      had    been   screened      for    mental\n\nhealth issues and was routinely reviewed, albeit in a cursory\n\nfashion, pursuant to the settlement of a federal case in 1999.\n\nSee D.M. v.

The Rule Exemption, submitted to us\n\nafter     oral   argument,    eliminated    disciplinary    detention        and\n\nlimited     administrative      segregation      \"for   multiple   offenses\n\nimposed as a result of the same incident\" to 365 days.                       The\n\nRule Exemption also states:\n\n                 Studies have shown that isolation,\n            under   certain  circumstances,   exacerbates\n            mental health deterioration.    As such, the\n            elimination of [disciplinary] detention, and\n            the immediate transport of an inmate to a\n            less restrictive administrative segregation\n            unit upon adjudication, will have a positive\n            impact on the inmate population.\n\n                 Similarly,     maximizing inmate exposure\n            to no more than      365 days of administrative\n            segregation per      incident, rather than per\n            infraction, will     decrease the likelihood of\n            isolation.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  N.J.A.C. 10A:1-2.4 authorizes the Commissioner to \"relax and\nexempt   rules  and   regulations  for   the  administration   of\ncorrectional facilities . . . within the Department of\nCorrections\" to avoid \"undue hardship, unfairness or injustice.\"\nAlthough the DOC provided a document titled \"Request for Rule\nExemption,\" and counsel stated at oral argument that a Rule\nExemption had been applied to Mejia, we were not supplied with\nany official document designated as an approval of this request.\n\n\n\n                                      8                                A-0710-13T4\n\fThe Rule Exemption attachments include \"a replacement list of\n\nprohibited acts found in N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(a)\" separating \"the\n\noriginal list into the 5 new Categories from the Rule Exemption\"\n\nincluding      \"the   applicable         number   of    days    of    Administrative\n\nSegregation     per    category.\"          The    sanction      range      for     *.012,\n\n\"Throwing bodily fluid at any person,\" is 181 to 365 days.                             The\n\nother two infractions for which Mejia was convicted carry a\n\nsanction range of 91 to 180 days.                      Thus, the infraction of\n\n*.306, \"conduct which disrupts or interferes with the security\n\nor   orderly    running     of    the     correctional       facility,\"      has     been\n\ndowngraded to an infraction carrying a possible sanction of no\n\nmore than 180 days in administrative segregation rather than the\n\n365 days Mejia received.\n\n       The scope of our review of an agency decision is limited.\n\nCapital Health Sys., Inc. v.
