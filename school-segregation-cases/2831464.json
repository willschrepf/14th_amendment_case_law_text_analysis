Plaintiffs-appellants, taxpayers in the City of\nUnion, Ohio, sued the city and John Applegate, the City Manager, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Among\nother arguments, Plaintiffs claim that the defendants violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments\nby advertising and otherwise advocating against a citizen-sponsored ballot initiative and in favor of\na tax levy. The district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims with respect to\nall defendants on all issues except for the improper use of funds to combat the citizen initiative. The\ndistrict court subsequently granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the final issue.\nPlaintiffs appeal.\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 04-4153              Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                              Page 2\n\n\n                                                          I.\n        This case arises from a series of disputed ballot initiatives beginning in 1997 relating to the\ncreation and funding of a fire department in the City of Union (“Union”). In 1997, Union’s fire and\nemergency services (along with those of other neighboring communities) were provided by the\nneighboring township of Randolph. The combination of the restructuring of the townships and the\nperceived inadequacy in Union’s emergency services led to changes in the fire department structure.\nThe Union Council (“Council”) initially negotiated for a shared fire department with another\nneighboring town but ultimately passed an emergency resolution establishing a town fire\ndepartment. The new fire department became effective on January 1, 1998.\n        The resolution establishing a Union fire department was challenged by the plaintiffs via a\nballot initiative requiring a referendum. The referendum was preceded by a lively campaign in\nwhich the plaintiffs organized a “Vote Yes” campaign to retain the extant fire districts. The Council\nsupported the opposite position and used public funds to disseminate information supporting its\nposition to citizens. The Union City Charter permits the Council to “authorize the expenditure of\npublic funds to provide information to the members of the public in connection with elections on\nproposed tax levies and bond issues . . . and other issues affecting the Municipality and not involving\nthe election of candidates for a public office . . . .” Union City Charter § 5.09. Plaintiffs, however,\nobject to the hanging of “Vote No” banners, mailing of leaflets to residents, advertising       in local\nnewspapers, and using the town newsletter to support the Council’s position.1 The referendum\noccurred in November 1997, and the Council’s decision was ratified. Voters funded the new fire\ndepartment in a May 1998 referendum.\n        Plaintiffs allege that the city continued to disseminate information and advocate for causes\nover the next several years. The advocacy included the use of public funds in 2000 and 2001 to\noppose ballot initiatives regarding land annexation and provision of water and sewage services to\nnon-residents and to promote tax levies in anticipation of referenda in 2001. The record is silent on\nthe extent of the advertising by the Union government during these later referenda.\n         In response to Union’s actions during the fire department referendum, the plaintiffs and\nothers sued Union and Applegate, its Manager. The district court dismissed the claim. Lash v. City\nof Union, 104 F. Supp. 2d 866 (S.D. Ohio 1999). After the district court issued its ruling, the parties\nsettled the case without appeal. The settlement agreement released the defendants from some claims\nbut preserved plaintiffs’ right to seek declaratory and injunctive relief relative to the use of funds\nto advocate a position on the 1997 ballot initiative and the 1998 tax levy for the fire department and\nto bring new claims arising after May 1998. The instant lawsuit against Union, Applegate, the\nmayor, and the town council of Union followed. The district court dismissed the mayor and town\ncouncil after finding that they qualified, respectively, for qualified and absolute immunity. The\ncourt then granted summary judgment for Union and Applegate, holding that the spending for\nviewpoint-based advertising for citizen initiatives and tax levies in this case did not violate the First2\nor Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs argue on appeal that the city’s advocacy was unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n        Defendants contest the factual accuracy of some of the plaintiffs’ allegations. For example, they say that the\n“Vote No” banner was bought by a political action committee and only hung by a city employee.\n         2\n         Because we hold that defendants did not violate plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, we need not consider the\nimmunity issue. Further, plaintiffs have abandoned the state law claim for injunctive relief relating to the Manager’s\nexpenditure of funds without Council authorization.\n\fNo. 04-4153            Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                     Page 3\n\n\n                                                   II.\n        This case presents the rare instance when public citizens seek to limit the speech of a\ngovernmental entity rather than the reverse. The scenarios in which citizens may halt a\ngovernment’s speech are limited. “[W]hen the government appropriates public funds to promote\na particular policy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes.” Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors\nof Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 833 (1995). The government’s power to fund its speech is\nsimilarly limited, however. In NAACP v. Hunt, 891 F.2d 1555 (11th Cir. 1990), the Eleventh Circuit\nidentified three categories of government actions that courts have determined to be unconstitutional\ninfringement of free speech: (1) abridgment of equality in the field of ideas by granting differential\naccess to public fora based on viewpoint; (2) monopolization of the “marketplace of ideas”; and\n(3) compulsion of citizens “to support candidates, parties, ideologies, or causes that they are\nagainst.” 891 F.2d at 1565-66 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Plaintiffs assert that\nUnion’s actions violated two of these categories by denying them access to a public forum (the town\nnewsletter and town treasury) and compelling them to support causes to which they are adverse.\nPlaintiffs urge us to find that government speech relating to elections is a form of unconstitutional\ncompelled speech by distinguishing between governing and campaigning.\n         Turning first to the issue of differential access to public fora, plaintiffs argue that Union\nunconstitutionally denied them access to two public fora – the town newsletter and the town treasury\n– to which others had been granted access. A government abridges “equality in the field of ideas”\nwhen it grants “the use of a [public] forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but [denies\nits] use to those wishing to express less favored or more controversial views.” Police Dept. of City\nof Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972).\n         Plaintiffs assert that they were denied access to the town newsletter, but, as the district court\nnoted, they provide no evidence that they asked for or were refused access to that forum, even if it\nwas public. Plaintiffs have similarly failed to present evidence that any other private group was\ngiven access to the newsletter other than a single quote about the contested issue that was responsive\nto another quote advocating the contrary position. “[W]hen government property is not dedicated\nto open communication the government may–without further justification–restrict use to those who\nparticipate in the forum’s official business.” Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Educators’ Ass’n,\n460 U.S. 37, 53 (1983). The single quotation cannot be construed as opening the newsletter as a\npublic forum. See Cook v. Baca, 95 F. Supp. 2d 1215, 1221 (D.N.M. 2000) (noting that one factor\nin the determination of whether a public forum existed is the “extent of use of the forum”). Further,\n“when the government determines an overarching message and retains power to approve every word\ndisseminated at its behest, the message must be attributed to the government for First Amendment\npurposes.” ACLU of Tenn. v. Bredesen, 441 F.3d 370, 375 (6th Cir. 2006), citing Johanns v.\nLivestock Mktg. Ass’n, 544 U.S. 550, 559-67 (2005). Here, Union approved the message delivered\nin the town newsletter, so its content must be considered that of the city itself, not that of the quoted\nprivate citizen. See Int’l Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 686 (1992)\n(O’Connor, J., concurring) (agreeing that airport is not a public forum). Plaintiffs thus cannot\nprevail on their public forum claim relating to the newsletter.\n        The town treasury is not a public forum; it is not “by tradition or designation a forum for\npublic communication.” Perry, 460 U.S. at 46. Nor is the treasury a limited purpose public forum;\nUnion has not opened that treasury to the public by making any town funds available to private\nindividuals or groups. Union has used the treasury for its own speech – a use that has no effect on\nthe treasury as a public forum. Id. (“As we have stated on several occasions, the State, no less than\na private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which\nit is lawfully dedicated.” (quotations and citations omitted)); cf. Rosenberger 515 U.S. at 833\n(granting the government deference to use its funds to further its own viewpoint). To hold that\nUnion’s advocacy converts its treasury to a public forum would severely limit the town’s ability to\n\fNo. 04-4153                Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                                  Page 4\n\n\nself-regulate and would be tantamount to a heckler’s veto, where the government could not speak\nfor fear of opening its treasury to the public. This argument is therefore baseless, and the plaintiffs’\npublic forum challenge cannot succeed.\n        As to the plaintiffs’ second claim regarding compelled speech, governments cannot compel\ncitizens to support positions with which they disagree. Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 715\n(1977) (“The First Amendment protects the right of individuals to hold a point of view different\nfrom the majority and to refuse to foster . . . an idea they find morally objectionable.”). This case,\nhowever, presents a compelled subsidy – not a compelled speech – claim because the plaintiffs were\nnot themselves required to speak in any manner. While plaintiffs cast the compelled speech\nargument distinguishing governing and campaigning as separate from the compelled subsidy issue,\nwe believe that it is more appropriate to describe the speech issue as a special case of the compelled\nsubsidy issue, as dealt with in Johanns v. Livestock Mktg. Ass’n, 544 U.S. 550 (2005).\n         The Supreme Court has held in several instances that compelled subsidies may violate the\nFirst Amendment rights of citizens. See Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.S. 209 (1977) (labor\nunion political action); Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U.S. 1 (1990) (bar dues for political action);\nBd. of Regents of Univ. of Wis. Sys. v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217 (2000) (student activities fund for\nextracurricular activity). All of the cases in which the Supreme Court has held a compelled subsidy\nto be a First Amendment violation have involved subsidies of speech by private organizations rather\nthan by the government itself. Governmental subsidies are distinguishable from the labor union,\nstate bar, and state university contexts because it is imperative that government be free to make\nunpopular decisions without opening the public fisc to opposing views. The Supreme Court\nrecognized this distinction in Southworth: “The government, as a general rule, may support valid\nprograms and policies by taxes or other exactions binding on protesting parties. Within this broader\nprinciple it seems inevitable that funds raised by the government will be spent for speech and other\nexpression to defend its own policies.” 529 U.S. at 229. More recently, in Johanns v. Livestock\nMktg. Ass’n, the Court addressed a compelled subsidy directly in the governmental context:\n         Our compelled-subsidy cases have consistently respected the principle that\n         “[c]ompelled support of a private association is fundamentally different from\n         compelled support of government.” “Compelled support of government” – even\n         those programs of government one does not approve – is of course perfectly\n         constitutional, as every taxpayer must attest. And some government programs\n         involve, or entirely consist of, advocating a position.\n544 U.S. 550, 559 (2005) (quoting Abood, 431 U.S. at 259 n.13 (Powell, J., concurring in\njudgment)).\n        Here, the plaintiffs have challenged the expenditure of tax dollars by a governmental entity\nto advocate a position – a case that the Supreme Court deemed “perfectly constitutional” in\nJohanns. Id. at 2062. Though the plaintiffs acknowledge that the speech in this case is attributable\nto the government, they argue that the power of the government to compel subsidies for its speech\nis not as broad as the Supreme Court suggested in Johanns. Because the asserted subsidy arose in\nthe context of an election, the3plaintiffs argue that this court should find Union’s speech to be\nunconstitutionally compulsive.\n\n\n         3\n           Neither the plaintiffs nor the dissent have identified a single case where a court relied upon such a distinction\nto decide a free speech question. Several cases discussed in the dissenting opinion, notably Dist. of Columbia Common\nCause v. Dist. of Columbia, 858 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1988), Stanson v. Mott, 551 P.2d 1 (Cal. 1972), Citizens to Protect\nPublic Funds v. Bd. of Educ., 98 A.2d 673 (N.J. 1953), and Mountain States Legal Found. v. Denver Sch. Dist. No. 1,\n459 F. Supp. 357 (D. Colo. 1978), were decided on statutory or other non-constitutional grounds, so they lack direct\napplicability here. Moreover, they were all decided before Southworth, Rosenberger, and Johanns clarified the extent\n\fNo. 04-4153               Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                               Page 5\n\n\n        As the dissent recognizes, elections raise unique constitutional issues because they are the\nvery foundation of a democratic system: where the government uses its official voice in an attempt\nto affect the identity of the people’s elected representatives, it can undermine its legitimacy as a\nchampion of the people’s will and thereby subvert one of the principles underlying democratic\nsociety. See Stanson v. Mott, 551 P.2d 1, 9 (Cal. 1976) (discussing importance of elections in the\ndemocratic process). Although these principles require some limit on the government’s power to\nadvocate during elections, they do not support a bright line rule barring such speech, at least where\nthe government speaks within the scope of its governance functions.4 Governments must serve their\ncitizens in myriad ways, including by provision of emergency services, and these activities require\nfunding through taxation. Union’s speech related to emergency service and tax initiatives thus fits\nsquarely within its competence as governor and was made in the context of “advocat[ing] and\ndefend[ing] its own policies.” Southworth, 529 U.S. at 229. The issues on which the city advocated\nwere thus germane to the mechanics of its function, and are clearly distinguishable from the\nhypothetical cases of government speech in support of particular candidates suggested by the\ndissent. See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 833; Southworth, 529 U.S. at 229. Where speech is not so\ndirected, the result may be different: in Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Denver School District\n#1, by contrast, the court ruled illegal a local school board’s use of public funds for advocacy in a\nstatewide initiative regarding education funding. 459 F. Supp. 357, 361 (D. Colo. 1978). Unlike\nUnion’s actions, the school board’s advocacy in Mountain States was not directly related to its\ngovernance functions and was struck down.\n        In this case, Ohio’s home rule system made Union’s policies subject to acceptance or\nrejection by ballot. In this context, a limit on government speech during elections would allow\nhecklers to silence the government on issues in which it has an interest and expertise – and on which\ncitizens have an interest in hearing their government’s perspective. See Ala. Libertarian Party v.\nCity of Birmingham, 694 F. Supp. 814, 817 (N.D. Ala. 1988) (upholding promotional campaign\nrelating to levies where the subject of the campaign was “related to the common needs of all\ncitizens”). Because Union’s speech in this case was germane to its role as governor, plaintiffs have\nfailed to show that democratic legitimacy is threatened or that Union’s compelled subsidy of its\nspeech violates the Constitution.\n         The natural outcome of government speech is that some constituents will be displeased by\nthe stance their government has taken. Displeasure does not necessarily equal unconstitutional\ncompulsion, however, and in most cases the electoral process – not First Amendment litigation – is\nthe appropriate recourse for such displeasure. See Johanns, 544 U.S. at 563 (noting the importance\nof political accountability of decisionmakers). The needs of effective governance command that the\nbar limiting government speech be high. The plaintiffs in this case have failed to show that the City\nof Union’s expenditures crossed the line separating a valid compelled subsidy from an\nunconstitutional one, and valid advocacy from prescription of orthodoxy.\n         For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court decision.\n\n\n\nto which governments do have the right to support their own positions on contested issues. As a result, a close analysis\nof these cases is of limited value in this case.\n         4\n           The dissent conclusorily rejects any distinction between permissible government speech reasonably related\nto governance functions and impermissible speech, for example, speech in support of a particular candidate for office.\nCommon sense militates and Supreme Court precedent requires us to reject the dissent’s position. The dissent wrongly\nignores not only the Supreme Court’s recent strengthening of its compelled subsidy jurisprudence in Johanns, but also\nSouthworth’s and Rosenberger’s more generalized holdings as to a government’s right to defend its own policies. A\nbright line rule against any governmental speech regarding any referendum would violate these clear dictates favoring\na more nuanced test for the propriety of such speech.\n\fNo. 04-4153               Kidwell et al. v.

Although local governmental expenditures to advocate in an election may seem\ncommonplace and uninspiring, I take the position that governmental campaigning in elections is\nimplicitly prohibited by our constitutional design and republican form of government. “Free and\nhonest elections are the very foundation of our republican form of government,” MacDougall v.\nGreen, 335 U.S. 281, 288 (1948) (Douglas, J., dissenting), and when the government uses tax dollars\nto enter an electoral contest and advocate in favor of a position or candidate, it distorts the very\ncheck on governmental power so central to our constitutional design — the next election — that I\nmust conclude such activity is unconstitutional.\n        There are, of course, broad competing principles on both sides of the issue. On the side of\nthe government, it can be argued that government must be permitted to speak or it will cease to be\neffective as a government. ACLU v. Bredesen, 441 F.3d 370, 381 (6th Cir. 2006) (Martin, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (“[T]he government may generally speak and control its\nown message.”). On the other hand, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1801, “it is expected that [a\ngovernment official] will not attempt to influence the votes of others nor take any part in the\nbusiness of electioneering, that being deemed inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution and his\nduties to it.” 1 James D. Richardson, A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents,\n1789-1897, at 98-99 (1899).\n        The government speech doctrine, while in the early stages of development, provides support\nfor the proposition that government must be able to speak to function.     Government must be able\nto adopt policies and advocate for and defend against those policies.1 If private speech were the\nonly permissible speech regarding governing, the role of government would drastically change and\nthe idea that governmental policies reflect and are representative of the majority would be lost. This\nindicates that the government must, of course, be permitted to speak in order to govern and educate.\n       The taxpayers here have conceded the existence of the government speech doctrine as a\ngeneral matter, but draw a distinction between government speech related to governing and speech\nintended to campaign or to influence an election. I think they make a good point. There are several\ncases both at the state and federal district court level reviewing the propriety of governmental\nexpenditures designed to influence local elections. It is worthwhile to review these cases.\n       Most often these cases arise in the context of municipal bond initiatives where the local\ngovernment uses taxpayer funds to campaign in favor of the proposal. A prominent case from the\nSupreme Court of California is Stanson v. Mott, 551 P.2d 1 (Cal. 1976). Stanson involved a\ntaxpayer’s complaint that the California Department of Parks and Recreation had authorized the\nexpenditure of more than $5,000 of public funds to promote the passage of the bond issue placed\n\n         1\n           Of course, a necessary corollary to the doctrine of government speech is governmental accountability for that\nspeech. “Otherwise there is no check whatever on government’s power . . .” Johanns, 125 S. Ct. at 2068 (Souter, J.,\ndissenting). Thus, the government, when it speaks, ought to be required to make clear that it is in fact the government\nthat is speaking. Government speech ought to be labeled as such to prevent confusion and subliminal governmental\npropaganda in the marketplace of ideas.\n\fNo. 04-4153               Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                                  Page 7\n\n\non the ballot by the state legislature. Id. at 3. The court held that “at least in the absence of clear\nand explicit legislature authorization, a public agency may not expend public funds to promote a\npartisan position in an election campaign; in the present case, no legislative provision accorded the\nDepartment of Parks and Recreation such authorization.” Id. The court did find legislative authority\nto “disseminate ‘information’ to the public relating to the bond election” but the department “in\nfulfilling this informational role, was obligated to provide a fair presentation of the relevant facts.”\nId. The promotional materials disseminated by the department in Stanson were similar to those\ncomplained about in the instant case. See id. at 4.\n        The Supreme Court of California found that the department lacked the express legislative\nauthority for the expenditure of funds designed to influence the bond proposal. That court cited with\napproval to, Citizens to Protect Pub. Funds v. Board of Educ., 98 A.2d 673 (N.J. 1953), an opinion\nwritten by then New Jersey Supreme Court Justice and future United States Supreme Court Justice\nWilliam Brennan, discussing the legality of a school board’s expenditure of public funds on a\nbooklet concerning a school building program which was to be the subject of an upcoming bond\nelection. See Stanson, 551 P.2d at 8. The booklet in New Jersey exhorted “Vote Yes” on several\npages and warned of consequences “if You Don’t Vote Yes.” Id. The New Jersey Supreme Court,\nthrough Justice Brennan concluded that\n         the board made use of public funds to advocate one side only of the controversial\n         question without affording the dissenters the opportunity by means of that financed\n         medium to present their side, and this imperilled the propriety of the entire\n         expenditure. The public funds entrusted to the board belong equally to the\n         proponents and opponents of the proposition, and the use of the funds to finance not\n         the presentation of facts merely but also arguments to persuade the voters that only\n         one side has merit, gives the dissenters just cause for complaint. The expenditure\n         then is not within the implied power and is not lawful in the absence of express\n         authority from the legislature.\nCitizens to Protect Pub. Funds, 98 A.2d at 677.\n       In Stanson, the Supreme Court of California further remarked that “[i]ndeed, every court\nwhich has addressed the issue to date has found the use of public funds for partisan campaign\npurposes improper, either on the ground that such use was not explicitly authorized or on the broader\nground that such expenditures are never appropriate.” Stanson, 551 P.2d at 8-9 (citations omitted).\nCommenting further, the court noted that\n         [u]nderlying this uniform judicial reluctance to sanction the use of public funds for\n         election campaigns rests on an implicit recognition that such expenditures raise\n         potentially serious constitutional questions. A fundamental precept of this nation’s\n         democratic electoral process is that the government may not ‘take sides’ in election\n         contests or bestow an unfair advantage on one of several competing factions. A\n         principal danger feared by our country’s founders lay in the possibility that the\n         holders of governmental authority would use official power improperly to perpetuate\n         themselves, or their allies, in office; the selective use of public funds in election\n         campaigns, of course, raises the specter of just such an improper distortion of the\n         democratic electoral process.\nId. at 9 (citations omitted).2\n\n         2\n           The court also commented on “[t]he importance of government impartiality in electoral matters,” and observed\nthat in another recent case it had stated that “[a] fundamental goal of a democratic society is to attain the free and pure\nexpression of the voters’ choice of candidates” and that “our state and federal Constitutions mandate that the government\n\fNo. 04-4153               Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                                 Page 8\n\n\n        Notwithstanding its comments regarding the constitutional scope of the wrong, the court\nexplicitly denied resolving the federal constitutional question. According to the court, “we need not\nresolve the serious constitutional question that would be posed by an explicit legislative\nauthorization of the use of public funds for partisan campaigning, because the legislative provisions\nrelied upon by [the department] certainly do not authorize such expenditures.” Id. at 10.\n        Two additional features of the decision are relevant to my analysis of the issue. First, the\nSupreme Court of California refused to draw a distinction between public funds to support a\nparticular candidate and public funds to promote a ballot measure. Id. at 9. According to the court,\n“past authorities have not drawn such a distinction between ‘ballot measure’ and ‘candidate’\ncampaigning; to date the judicial decisions have uniformly held that the use of public funds for\ncampaign expenses is as improper in bond issue or other noncandidate elections as in candidate\nelections.” Id. Second, the court noted that reasonable expenditures for informational purposes\npose no problem, while exhortational campaign expenditures are improper. The court did concede\nthat “[p]roblems may arise, of course, in attempting to distinguish improper ‘campaign’ expenditures\nfrom proper ‘informational’ activities.” Id. at 11. The court instructed that “no hard and fast rule\ngoverns every case” and that “a careful consideration of such factors as the style, tenor and timing\nof the publication” are necessary to resolve the difficult question. Id. at 12.\n        The Stanson case is informative, but of course, not controlling. Additionally, although it\ndiscussed the constitutional question and expressed its concerns, the court explicitly declined to rule\non it. Instead, the court’s invalidation of the expenditures was based on legislative enactment (or\nan absence thereof) and not on the First Amendment. Moreover, in discussing the constitutional\nquestion, the court did not explicitly ground its concerns in any particular provision of the United\nStates Constitution. Rather, as discussed above, the court stated that the expenditures “raise\npotentially serious constitutional questions.” Id. at 9. These questions, it appears, relate to a\n“fundamental precept of this nation’s democratic electoral process,” to concerns over the use of\ngovernmental authority to “improperly perpetuate themselves,” and finally, to concerns over the\n“improper distortion of the democratic electoral process.” The concerns explicitly relate to the\nelectoral process and make no mention of government speech in the general process of governing.\nMoreover, it appears that the court’s expressed constitutional concerns stemmed from the structure\nand purpose of the Constitution and not necessarily the First Amendment (as alleged in the instant\ncase). Finally, the court did note that (to that date) every court that had reviewed such election or\ncampaign expenditures had found them improper, though all on statutory, and not constitutional\ngrounds.\n        Another case decided several years after the Stanson decision is District of Columbia\nCommon Cause v. District of Columbia, where the D.C. Circuit held that expenditures made by the\ncity government in a campaign to defeat a ballot proposal were illegal. 858 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1988)\n(“We hold that the individual appellees have standing as municipal taxpayers to challenge\nexpenditures by the District of Columbia government to influence the outcome of an initiative. On\nthe merits, we conclude that the expenditures were illegal.”). The district court found that the\nexpenditures violated both statutory law as well as the federal constitution, ruling that the promotion\nof only one side of a contested election issue amounted to a content-based government subsidy. The\nD.C. Circuit affirmed on statutory grounds but explicitly declined to address the argument that the\nexpenditures violated the First Amendment. Id. at 11.\n      Another case invalidating expenditures on statutory grounds is Mountain States Legal\nFoundation v. Denver School District # 1, 459 F. Supp. 357 (D. Colo. 1978). Mountain States Legal\n\n\nmust, if possible, avoid any feature that might adulterate or, indeed, frustrate, that free and pure choice.” Stanson, 551\nP.2d at 10 (citations omitted).\n\fNo. 04-4153            Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                     Page 9\n\n\nFoundation involved a voter proposed petition to amend the Colorado Constitution “in a manner\nwhich would affect the authority of all levels of representative government in Colorado to spend\npublic funds.” Id. at 358. The Board of Education of School District No. 1 adopted a Resolution\ndeclaring its opposition to the proposed state constitutional amendment and urging that it be\ndefeated. The Resolution also authorized the use of school district “equipment, materials, supplies,\nfacilities, funds and employees necessary to (1) Distribute campaign literature to School District\nemployees, and the parents of children in the schools. (2) The use of telephones and facilities of\nthe School District during non-working hours by volunteers for the purpose of contacting the public\nto urge the defeat of this amendment.” Id.\n         The district court in Mountain States favorably cited to both Stanson and Citizens to Protect\nPublic Funds and found that the school district had exceeded its legislatively granted authority under\nstate law. Id. at 359-60. The court further commented on the constitutional question, though it was\nnot key to the resolution of the case. The court remarked that an interpretation of Colorado’s state\nCampaign Reform Act allowing this type of “partisan use of public funds . . . would violate the First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.” Id. at 360. According to the court, “[i]t is the duty\nof this Court to protect the political freedom of the people of Colorado. The freedom of speech and\nthe right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances are fundamental\ncomponents of guaranteed liberty in the United States.” Id. (citation omitted). Thus, the court\nappears to have based its ruling on both the First Amendment’s freedom of speech clause as well\nas the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances — an apparent link to the fact that\nthe election was over a voter initiated proposed constitutional amendment to alter the structure and\npowers of government.\n        The court further stated that “[a] use of the power of publicly owned resources to\npropagandize against a proposal made and supported by a significant number of those who were\ntaxed to pay for such resources is an abridgment of those fundamental freedoms.” Id. Expressing\nconcern that governmental opposition to a proposed constitutional amendment would have “the\neffect of shifting the ultimate source of power away from the people,” the court concluded that\n“[p]ublicly financed opposition to the exercise of that right contravenes the meaning of both the First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution and Article V, Section 1 of the Constitution of\nColorado.” Id. at 361. Adding an additional basis, the court stated that “the expenditure of public\nfunds in opposition [to a citizen led effort] violates a basic precept of this nation’s democratic\nprocess. Indeed, it would seem so contrary to the root philosophy of a republican form of\ngovernment as might cause this Court to resort to the guaranty clause in Article IV, Section 4 of the\nUnited States Constitution.” Id.\n        In sum, the Mountain States court appears to have held that the expenditure of public funds\nviolated state statutes, the state constitution, and the federal constitution. In reaching that conclusion\nwith respect to the federal constitution, however, while the court mentioned the First Amendment,\nit devoted little explanation as to why citizens’s free speech rights are violated in this situation.\nInstead, the court focused more on basic democratic principles, fundamental freedoms, and\nguaranteed liberties, and it did so emphatically with reference to the fact that this involved a voter\ninitiated constitutional amendment and the government acted in opposition to it. In doing so, the\ncourt appears to have concluded that public expenditures on campaigns in this situation undermines\nthe validity of elections and the constitutional amendment process and shifts the balance of power\naway from the citizens. The court’s opinion demonstrates that grounding this principle in a specific\nconstitutional provision (as opposed to the structure and democratic purpose of the constitution)\nproves somewhat difficult.\n       While the taxpayers rely on Mountain States Legal Foundation, the City relies on Alabama\nLibertarian Party v. City of Birmingham, 694 F. Supp. 814 (N.D. Ala. 1988). Like this Court is\nasked to do in the instant case, the district court in Alabama Libertarian Party considered only the\n\fNo. 04-4153               Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                               Page 10\n\n\nfederal constitutional question and did not consider any claims arising under state law. There were\ntwo elections at issue in Alabama Libertarian Party. The first was an election regarding a city-\nproposed property tax increase for library enhancements and a levy on telephone subscribers for\nenhanced 911 emergency services. Id. at 815. Prior to the election, “the City launched a\npromotional campaign to encourage passage of the propositions.” Id. The campaign included\nnewspaper and radio advertisements. Id. The second was another special election held a year later\nover a proposed bond issue and this time the City distributed leaflets and brochures in favor of the\nbond issue. Id. The taxpayer plaintiffs claimed that the campaigning violated their First\nAmendment rights.\n        The district court in Alabama Libertarian Party began by reviewing the Supreme Court’s\ndecision, Abood v. Detroit Board of Educ., 431 U.S. 209 (1977). In Abood, the Court considered\nwhether organizations to which dues must be paid as a mandatory condition of state employment\nmay use those dues to advance political causes not supported by all of the members. The Court held\nthat the exactions violated the First Amendment by allowing the funds to be used for political and\nideological purposes — that is, the First Amendment generally prohibits compelled subsidies for\npolitical purposes. Id.\n        After considering Abood, the district court concluded that the “critical” issue is “whether a\nportion of plaintiffs’ tax funds were expended for ‘political’ and ‘ideological’ purposes.” Alabama\nLibertarian Party, 694 F. Supp. at 817. The district court then concluded that the campaigns waged\nby the City and the funds spent were not on “political” or “ideological” causes, but rather were\n“related to the common needs of all citizens.” Id. (“The court does not believe that the City’s\nadvertising campaign was political or ideological in nature.”). Rejecting the taxpayers’\nconstitutional claims, the district court found that “the City leadership has determined to promote\na cause consistent with the common needs of its citizens. It is not requiring plaintiffs to be the\ncourier for an ideological or political message.” Id. The court appears to have drawn a distinction\nbetween situations where funds are “used to support a particular candidate, doctrine or ideology”\nand the case before it where “the City merely solicited its citizens to provide funds to supply the\nperceived needs common to all.” Id. In the latter situation, the court reasoned, the “City and its\nofficials not only have the right, but the duty, to determine the needs of its citizens and to provide\nfunds to service those needs.” Id.\n        The court also noted that the City had already passed ordinances in favor of the levies and\ntherefore had already taken public positions on the issues — thus, spending funds to advertise was\nno more than publicizing the positions already taken. Id. at 818. Drawing distinctions between past\ncases, the district court noted that in Common Cause and Mountain States Legal Foundation, the\nissue confronted was a citizens’s initiative election while in Alabama, the election was over the\nCity’s own initiative. Id. at 819. Thus, the district court stated that “[w]hile this court may not agree\nthat a governmental entity can never take sides in an initiative election, it certainly cannot agree that\na governmental entity cannot expend funds to even publicly endorse its own measures.” Id. The\ncourt found further support from its ruling through the political process, noting that citizens who\ndisapprove of the governmental election campaigning may dissent at the polls. Id. at 820.\nMoreover, the court also suggested that not permitting         the government to advocate “would be\nviolative of their own First Amendment rights.” Id.3 Finally, the court concluded that\n         It would be a strange system indeed which would allow the City to determine its\n         needs, allow it to adopt ordinances calling for elections to fulfill those needs, allow\n         it to bear the expense of those elections, and then require it to stand silently by before\n\n\n         3\n          Presumably the district court was discussing the First Amendment rights of the individual city officials rather\nthan asserting that the First Amendment guarantees the government the freedom of speech — which it does not.\n\fNo. 04-4153           Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                  Page 11\n\n\n        the issues are voted on. Obviously, the City is not neutral under such circumstances\n        and should not be required to appear so.\nId. at 821.\n         The district court’s opinion in Alabama Libertarian Party is interesting for several reasons\nin addition to the fact that it is the only opinion to address solely the First Amendment and no\nquestions of state law. The first point of note is the district court’s conclusion that the “critical”\nissue is whether the funds spent are used for “political” or “ideological” purposes. More curious is\nthe district court’s conclusion that the governmental advertising campaign exhorting the citizens to\n“VOTE YES!” was neither political nor ideological, but rather “related to the common needs of all\ncitizens.” I do not endorse a distinction between electioneering expenditures for the common needs\nof citizens versus expenditures for political purposes. To determine that something is in the\ncommon needs of citizens is itself a political decision. Thus, I do not think that a principled basis\nfor such a distinction exists, and I do not find this approach to be useful in this context.\n        Second, the Alabama Libertarian Party court, like the district court in Mountain States Legal\nFoundation, emphasized the fact that the Alabama election was for tax levies and not a\nconstitutional amendment. The district court, however, did not explain why a different result is\ncompelled by this distinction. And third, the district court drew another distinction between\ngovernmental opposition to a citizen sponsored initiative and governmental promotion of proposed\nissues. Stated another way, the court appeared to find it more constitutionally troubling for the\ngovernment to say “Vote No,” than for it to say “Vote Yes.”\n        In Cook v. Baca, 95 F. Supp. 2d 1215 (D.N.M. 2000), a New Mexico district court\nconfronted the First Amendment constitutional issue posed by these cases and sided with the district\ncourt in Alabama Libertarian Party. At the outset, the court noted that “[a]t some threshold level,\na public entity must refrain from spending public funds to promote a partisan position during an\nelection campaign.” Id. at 1227 (quoting Carter v. City of Las Cruces, 915 P.2d 336 (N.M. Ct. App.\n1996)). The court was also “[m]indful that unconstitutional practices may be their ‘first footing’ in\nthe ‘mildest and least repulsive form.’” Id. (quoting Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 635\n(1886)). Nevertheless, the court found “no ominous threat to the First Amendment in Defendants’\nminimal actions,” and rejected the taxpayers’s claim. In doing so, the district court, like the court\nin Alabama Libertarian Party drew a distinction between opposition to a citizen proposed state\nconstitutional amendment and the expenditure of funds “to promote a tax initiative which was\nproposed by the mayor himself.” Id. at 1227 n.18 (emphasis deleted). The district court concluded\nby mentioning the Supreme Court’s decision in Board of Regents of the Univ. of Wisconsin System\nv. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217 (2000). There the Court stated that\n        It is inevitable that government will adopt and pursue programs and policies within\n        its constitutional powers but which nevertheless are contrary to the profound beliefs\n        and sincere convictions of some of its citizens. The government, as a general rule,\n        may support valid programs and policies by taxes or other exactions binding on\n        protesting parties. Within this broader principle it seems inevitable that funds raised\n        by the government will be spent for speech and other expression to advocate and\n        defend its own policies.\nId. at 229. The district court, however, did not necessarily address any differences, should they\nexist, between ordinary advocacy and defense of valid governmental programs and attempts to\ninfluence elections.\n         To recap, courts have been hostile toward the type of electioneering expenditures at issue\nin this case. See e.g., District of Columbia Common Cause v. District of Columbia, 858 F.2d 1 (D.C.\n\fNo. 04-4153                Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                                  Page 12\n\n\nCir. 1988) (affirming district court’s decision holding expenditures improper on statutory grounds,\nbut not reaching constitutional question); Cook, 95 F. Supp. 2d at 1227 (“At some threshold level,\na public entity must refrain from spending public funds to promote a partisan position during an\nelection campaign.”); Mountain States Legal Foundation, 459 F. Supp. at 360 (“[T]he expenditure\nof public funds in opposition [to a citizen led constitutional amendment] violates a basic precept of\nthis nation’s democratic process. Indeed, it would seem so contrary to the root philosophy of a\nrepublican form of government . . .”); Stanson, 551 P.2d at 9 (“A fundamental precept of this\nnation’s democratic electoral process is that the government may not ‘take sides’ in election contests\nor bestow an unfair advantage on one of several competing factions.”). The vast majority of courts\nthat have issued injunctions  against governmental campaign expenditures have done so based, for\nthe most part, on state law.4 The courts finding governmental campaign expenditures to be unlawful\nbased on state or local law have, in dicta, found additional support in various parts of the\nConstitution — the First Amendment, the general purpose and structure of the Constitution, the\nGuaranty Clause, and “democratic principles.” On the other hand, the courts finding no\nconstitutional problem with the expenditures have done so on various and inconsistent bases. Some\ncourts have utilized traditional forum analysis in the context of viewpoint discrimination. Other\ncourts have simply held that government has a right to speak at all times and need not remain neutral\nin the context of an election. The district court in this case applied a case involving a state’s\ndecision to fly the Confederate flag over the state house — basically an application of forum\nanalysis and consideration of viewpoint discrimination.\n        I agree with the courts who have opined that electioneering expenditures raise serious\nconstitutional concerns. I concede that the government may ordinarily speak to advocate and defend\nits own policies. The caveat, however, is always that the citizens’ remedy is at the ballot box in the\nnext election. In these cases, however, the government is distorting the only check on its power.\nI am not sure I would limit this argument to the confines of the First Amendment; rather, to me, it\nis more of a structural argument regarding democratic principles and the structure and purpose of\nthe constitution. In Burt v. Blumenauer, the Oregon Supreme Court persuasively wrote that: “It\nhardly seems necessary to rely on the First Amendment, at least when government resources are\ndevoted to promoting one side in an election on which the legitimacy of the government itself rests.\nThe principles of representative government enshrined in our constitutions would limit government\nintervention on behalf of its own candidates or against their opponents even if the First Amendment\nand its state equivalents had never been adopted.” 699 P.2d 168, 175 (Or. 1985).\n        The courts that have reviewed these questions have almost universally relied upon state or\nlocal law to invalidate them. In dicta, however, many courts have gone on to speculate as to the\nconstitutional question. These courts have referenced the Framers’ concerns with governmental\ncampaigning and the expenditure of funds in that context, specifically citing the Framers’ concern\n\n\n         4\n           As discussed earlier, the plaintiffs’s state law claim was dismissed by the district court for a failure to exhaust\nstate remedies and the plaintiffs did not appeal this decision. We therefore have before us only a First Amendment claim.\nWe do not know the status of any state proceedings or if they exist, but I take note of a provision of the Union Charter\nthat states:\n         Section 5.09. Public Information on Issues. The council shall have the power to appropriate and\n         authorize the expenditure of public funds to provide information to the members of the public in\n         connection with elections on proposed tax levies and bond issues for the purposes of the Municipality,\n         and other issues affecting the Municipality and not involving the election of candidates for a public\n         office, or the recall of a member of the Council.\nWhy the plaintiffs have not more vigorously pursued their claim under state law, or why they have not argued for\npendant jurisdiction, we can only speculate. Thus, the majority’s decision that these specific expenditures do not run\nafoul of the First Amendment might prove irrelevant if Section 5.09 is interpreted to permit, as Stanson did, expenditures\nto inform, but not to persuade.\n\fNo. 04-4153                Kidwell et al. v.

One might claim that, as at least one court did, these are issues for the common\ngood and therefore are of little constitutional concern. Continuing down this path, one might ask\nwhether the government could campaign and expend funds promoting a city council resolution\nextending the term lengths of current office holders, say for one year, for ten years, or even for life.\nThis idea, and the idea that governmental funds could be spent in an effort to perpetuate a\ngovernment in office is no doubt antithetical to the values underlying the Constitution.\n          There is no constitutional provision, however, that says governments may not make attempts\nto perpetuate themselves or spend funds pursuant thereto. And, there is no principled way, as I see\nit, to distinguish between the fire department election and any other — if one is unconstitutional, the\nothers must be as well. Another example from recent history (setting aside state laws that may\nprevent the practice) — could former California Governor Gray Davis have expended governmental\nfunds to campaign, advertise, and electioneer against his recall? Yet again another scenario that\nappears antithetical to democratic principles. Furthermore, there appears to be nothing in the First\nAmendment or any other constitutional provision that would prevent the government from spending\ntaxpayer funds or actively campaigning in support of a particular candidate. It would tear at the\nfabric of democracy to permit as much despite the absence of a specific constitutional provision to\ndefeat this type of governmental abuse, and I see no relevant distinction between that abuse and the\none before this Court today.\n        I believe that the Constitution properly prohibits the government from having a horse in the\nrace when it comes to elections. When government advocates on one side of an issue, the ultimate\nsource of governing power is shifted away from the people and the threat of official doctrine exists.\nOf course, the threat is not as omnipresent today in the United States as it is in some other countries.\nThere is no real evidence in any of these cases on point that the government as speaker crowded out\nprivate speech. There is no evidence that the government sought to suppress or in any way\ndiscourage other speech of a contrary nature. The absence of this evidence, however, does not in\nmy opinion cure the underlying evil — that is, ordinary democratic controls are insufficient as a\nremedy in  situations where governmental influence threatens to undermine the independent political\nprocess.5 Governmental advocacy and campaign expenditures could arguably threaten to undermine\n\n         5\n           Perhaps it is time for the Supreme Court to reconsider its Guarantee Clause jurisprudence. The Guarantee\nClause, found in Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution states: “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this\nUnion, a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion and on Application of the\nLegislature or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.” When a claim\nis alleged under the Guarantee Clause, the Supreme Court has dismissed it stating some version of the following: “As\nto the guaranty to every state of a republican form of government, it is well settled that the questions arising under [this\nclause] are political, not judicial, in character, and thus for the consideration of the Congress and not the courts.” Ohio\nex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metro. Park Dist., 281 U.S. 74, 79- 80 (1930) (citations omitted). Prominent scholars have\nsuggested that the Court reconsider this approach. See Erwin Chemerinsky, Cases Under The Guarantee Clause Should\nBe Justiciable, 65 U. Colo. L. Rev. 849 (1994). Additionally, in New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 184 (1984),\nJustice O’Connor, writing for the majority, stated that: “The view that the Guarantee Clause implicates only\nnonjusticiable political questions has its origin in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 12 L.Ed. 581 (1849), in which the Court\nwas asked to decide, in the wake of Dorr’s Rebellion, which of two rival governments was the legitimate government\nof Rhode Island. The Court held that ‘it rests with Congress,’ not the judiciary, ‘to decide what government is the\nestablished one in a State.’ Id., at 42. Over the following century, this limited holding metamorphosed into the sweeping\nassertion that ‘[v]iolation of the great guaranty of a republican form of government in States cannot be challenged in the\ncourts.’ Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, 556, 66 S.Ct. 1198, 1201, 90 L.Ed. 1432 (1946) (plurality opinion). This\nview has not always been accepted. In a group of cases decided before the holding of Luther was elevated into a general\nrule of nonjusticiability, the Court addressed the merits of claims founded on the Guarantee Clause without any\nsuggestion that the claims were not justiciable. See Attorney General of Michigan ex rel. Kies v. Lowrey, 199 U.S. 233,\n239, 26 S.Ct. 27, 29, 50 L.Ed. 167 (1905); Forsyth v. Hammond, 166 U.S. 506, 519, 17 S.Ct. 665, 670, 41 L.Ed. 1095\n(1897); In re Duncan, 139 U.S. 449, 461-462, 11 S.Ct. 573, 577, 35 L.Ed. 219 (1891); Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall.\n162, 175-176, 22 L.Ed. 627 (1875). See also Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 563-564, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 1148, 41 L.Ed.\n256 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (racial segregation “inconsistent with the guarantee given by the Constitution to each\n\fNo. 04-4153               Kidwell et al. v.

In the ordinary case of governmental action outside of an election, political controls can\nremedy citizen disagreement with governmental actions. Citizens can make their voices known at\nthe ballot box in the next election by voting current officeholders out. Governmental electioneering,\nhowever, diminishes the effectiveness of the political response and threatens underlying\nconstitutional values and democratic principles. The outcome of elections ideally should reflect the\npure will of the people unpolluted by government electioneering. Where the political response\ncannot provide an adequate remedy, it can be argued that courts must step in.\n         Thus, I would hold that the Constitution requires governmental neutrality in elections — that\nis, the Constitution permits the government to educate and inform the public, but it may not cross\nthe line into advocacy. Thus, government could provide factual information in newsletters and other\nforms of communication with the electorate. As the Supreme Court of California commented in\nStanson, it would not always be easy finding the line of demarcation between informing and\nadvocacy, but courts should look closely at the facts of each case, including the words used, the tone\nof the communication, the timing, and any other relevant factors. Moreover, government may\nprovide equal access to a forum (as it does in so many other contexts) allowing both sides of the\ndebate to advance their positions. Thus, a governmental newsletter such as the one at issue in this\ncase could grant equal space to competing factions to make their best case to the electorate. This\nposition, I think, would more appropriately reflective of the balance the Framers sought to strike in\nour democratic structure and goes a long way to ensuring that the true power remains with the\npeople.\n         For these reasons, I must respectfully dissent from today’s majority opinion.\n\n\n\n\nState of a republican form of government”).\nMore recently, the Court has suggested that perhaps not all claims under the Guarantee Clause present nonjusticiable\npolitical questions. See Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 582, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1392, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964) (“[S]ome\nquestions raised under the Guarantee Clause are nonjusticiable”). Contemporary commentators have likewise suggested\nthat courts should address the merits of such claims, at least in some circumstances. See, e.g., L. Tribe, AMERICAN\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW 398 (2d ed. 1988); J. Ely, DEMOCRACY AND DISTRUST: A THEORY OF JUDICIAL REVIEW 118, and\nn., 122-123 (1980); W. Wiecek, THE GUARANTEE CLAUSE OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION 287-289, 300 (1972); Merritt, 88\nColum. L. Rev., at 70-78; Bonfield, The Guarantee Clause of Article IV, Section 4: A Study in Constitutional Desuetude,\n46 Minn. L. Rev. 513, 560-565 (1962). We need not resolve this difficult question today.”\n         Perhaps that day has come.\n\f",

Plaintiffs-appellants, taxpayers in the City of\nUnion, Ohio, sued the city and John Applegate, the City Manager, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Among\nother arguments, Plaintiffs claim that the defendants violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments\nby advertising and otherwise advocating against a citizen-sponsored ballot initiative and in favor of\na tax levy. The district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims with respect to\nall defendants on all issues except for the improper use of funds to combat the citizen initiative. The\ndistrict court subsequently granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the final issue.\nPlaintiffs appeal.\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 04-4153              Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                              Page 2\n\n\n                                                          I.\n        This case arises from a series of disputed ballot initiatives beginning in 1997 relating to the\ncreation and funding of a fire department in the City of Union (“Union”). In 1997, Union’s fire and\nemergency services (along with those of other neighboring communities) were provided by the\nneighboring township of Randolph. The combination of the restructuring of the townships and the\nperceived inadequacy in Union’s emergency services led to changes in the fire department structure.\nThe Union Council (“Council”) initially negotiated for a shared fire department with another\nneighboring town but ultimately passed an emergency resolution establishing a town fire\ndepartment. The new fire department became effective on January 1, 1998.\n        The resolution establishing a Union fire department was challenged by the plaintiffs via a\nballot initiative requiring a referendum. The referendum was preceded by a lively campaign in\nwhich the plaintiffs organized a “Vote Yes” campaign to retain the extant fire districts. The Council\nsupported the opposite position and used public funds to disseminate information supporting its\nposition to citizens. The Union City Charter permits the Council to “authorize the expenditure of\npublic funds to provide information to the members of the public in connection with elections on\nproposed tax levies and bond issues . . . and other issues affecting the Municipality and not involving\nthe election of candidates for a public office . . . .” Union City Charter § 5.09. Plaintiffs, however,\nobject to the hanging of “Vote No” banners, mailing of leaflets to residents, advertising       in local\nnewspapers, and using the town newsletter to support the Council’s position.1 The referendum\noccurred in November 1997, and the Council’s decision was ratified. Voters funded the new fire\ndepartment in a May 1998 referendum.\n        Plaintiffs allege that the city continued to disseminate information and advocate for causes\nover the next several years. The advocacy included the use of public funds in 2000 and 2001 to\noppose ballot initiatives regarding land annexation and provision of water and sewage services to\nnon-residents and to promote tax levies in anticipation of referenda in 2001. The record is silent on\nthe extent of the advertising by the Union government during these later referenda.\n         In response to Union’s actions during the fire department referendum, the plaintiffs and\nothers sued Union and Applegate, its Manager. The district court dismissed the claim. Lash v. City\nof Union, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D. Ohio 1999). After the district court issued its ruling, the parties\nsettled the case without appeal. The settlement agreement released the defendants from some claims\nbut preserved plaintiffs’ right to seek declaratory and injunctive relief relative to the use of funds\nto advocate a position on the 1997 ballot initiative and the 1998 tax levy for the fire department and\nto bring new claims arising after May 1998. The instant lawsuit against Union, Applegate, the\nmayor, and the town council of Union followed. The district court dismissed the mayor and town\ncouncil after finding that they qualified, respectively, for qualified and absolute immunity. The\ncourt then granted summary judgment for Union and Applegate, holding that the spending for\nviewpoint-based advertising for citizen initiatives and tax levies in this case did not violate the First2\nor Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs argue on appeal that the city’s advocacy was unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n        Defendants contest the factual accuracy of some of the plaintiffs’ allegations. For example, they say that the\n“Vote No” banner was bought by a political action committee and only hung by a city employee.\n         2\n         Because we hold that defendants did not violate plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, we need not consider the\nimmunity issue. Further, plaintiffs have abandoned the state law claim for injunctive relief relating to the Manager’s\nexpenditure of funds without Council authorization.\n\fNo. 04-4153            Kidwell et al. v.

The scenarios in which citizens may halt a\ngovernment’s speech are limited. “[W]hen the government appropriates public funds to promote\na particular policy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes.” Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors\nof Univ. of Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117967\"><a href=\"/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 833 (1995). The government’s power to fund its speech is\nsimilarly limited, however. In NAACP v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533854\"><a href=\"/opinion/533854/national-association-for-the-advancement-of-colored-people-naacp-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1990), the Eleventh Circuit\nidentified three categories of government actions that courts have determined to be unconstitutional\ninfringement of free speech: (1) abridgment of equality in the field of ideas by granting differential\naccess to public fora based on viewpoint; (2) monopolization of the “marketplace of ideas”; and\n(3) compulsion of citizens “to support candidates, parties, ideologies, or causes that they are\nagainst.” 891 F.2d at 1565-66 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Plaintiffs assert that\nUnion’s actions violated two of these categories by denying them access to a public forum (the town\nnewsletter and town treasury) and compelling them to support causes to which they are adverse.\nPlaintiffs urge us to find that government speech relating to elections is a form of unconstitutional\ncompelled speech by distinguishing between governing and campaigning.\n         Turning first to the issue of differential access to public fora, plaintiffs argue that Union\nunconstitutionally denied them access to two public fora – the town newsletter and the town treasury\n– to which others had been granted access. A government abridges “equality in the field of ideas”\nwhen it grants “the use of a [public] forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but [denies\nits] use to those wishing to express less favored or more controversial views.” Police Dept. of City\nof Chicago v.

Plaintiffs have similarly failed to present evidence that any other private group was\ngiven access to the newsletter other than a single quote about the contested issue that was responsive\nto another quote advocating the contrary position. “[W]hen government property is not dedicated\nto open communication the government may–without further justification–restrict use to those who\nparticipate in the forum’s official business.” Perry Educ.

Plaintiffs thus cannot\nprevail on their public forum claim relating to the newsletter.\n        The town treasury is not a public forum; it is not “by tradition or designation a forum for\npublic communication.” Perry, 460 U.S. at 46. Nor is the treasury a limited purpose public forum;\nUnion has not opened that treasury to the public by making any town funds available to private\nindividuals or groups. Union has used the treasury for its own speech – a use that has no effect on\nthe treasury as a public forum. Id. (“As we have stated on several occasions, the State, no less than\na private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which\nit is lawfully dedicated.” (quotations and citations omitted)); cf. Rosenberger 515 U.S. at 833\n(granting the government deference to use its funds to further its own viewpoint).

This argument is therefore baseless, and the plaintiffs’\npublic forum challenge cannot succeed.\n        As to the plaintiffs’ second claim regarding compelled speech, governments cannot compel\ncitizens to support positions with which they disagree. Wooley v. Maynard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109638\"><a href=\"/opinion/109638/wooley-v-maynard/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 715\n(1977) (“The First Amendment protects the right of individuals to hold a point of view different\nfrom the majority and to refuse to foster . . . an idea they find morally objectionable.”). This case,\nhowever, presents a compelled subsidy – not a compelled speech – claim because the plaintiffs were\nnot themselves required to speak in any manner.

All of the cases in which the Supreme Court has held a compelled subsidy\nto be a First Amendment violation have involved subsidies of speech by private organizations rather\nthan by the government itself. Governmental subsidies are distinguishable from the labor union,\nstate bar, and state university contexts because it is imperative that government be free to make\nunpopular decisions without opening the public fisc to opposing views. The Supreme Court\nrecognized this distinction in Southworth: “The government, as a general rule, may support valid\nprograms and policies by taxes or other exactions binding on protesting parties. Within this broader\nprinciple it seems inevitable that funds raised by the government will be spent for speech and other\nexpression to defend its own policies.” 529 U.S. at 229. More recently, in Johanns v. Livestock\nMktg. Ass’n, the Court addressed a compelled subsidy directly in the governmental context:\n         Our compelled-subsidy cases have consistently respected the principle that\n         “[c]ompelled support of a private association is fundamentally different from\n         compelled support of government.” “Compelled support of government” – even\n         those programs of government one does not approve – is of course perfectly\n         constitutional, as every taxpayer must attest.

See Stanson v.

Although these principles require some limit on the government’s power to\nadvocate during elections, they do not support a bright line rule barring such speech, at least where\nthe government speaks within the scope of its governance functions.4 Governments must serve their\ncitizens in myriad ways, including by provision of emergency services, and these activities require\nfunding through taxation. Union’s speech related to emergency service and tax initiatives thus fits\nsquarely within its competence as governor and was made in the context of “advocat[ing] and\ndefend[ing] its own policies.” Southworth, 529 U.S. at 229. The issues on which the city advocated\nwere thus germane to the mechanics of its function, and are clearly distinguishable from the\nhypothetical cases of government speech in support of particular candidates suggested by the\ndissent. See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 833; Southworth, 529 U.S. at 229. Where speech is not so\ndirected, the result may be different: in Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Denver School District\n#1, by contrast, the court ruled illegal a local school board’s use of public funds for advocacy in a\nstatewide initiative regarding education funding. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1392528\"><a href=\"/opinion/1392528/mountain-states-legal-etc-v-denver-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Unlike\nUnion’s actions, the school board’s advocacy in Mountain States was not directly related to its\ngovernance functions and was struck down.\n        In this case, Ohio’s home rule system made Union’s policies subject to acceptance or\nrejection by ballot. In this context, a limit on government speech during elections would allow\nhecklers to silence the government on issues in which it has an interest and expertise – and on which\ncitizens have an interest in hearing their government’s perspective.

Ala. 1988) (upholding promotional campaign\nrelating to levies where the subject of the campaign was “related to the common needs of all\ncitizens”). Because Union’s speech in this case was germane to its role as governor, plaintiffs have\nfailed to show that democratic legitimacy is threatened or that Union’s compelled subsidy of its\nspeech violates the Constitution.\n         The natural outcome of government speech is that some constituents will be displeased by\nthe stance their government has taken. Displeasure does not necessarily equal unconstitutional\ncompulsion, however, and in most cases the electoral process – not First Amendment litigation – is\nthe appropriate recourse for such displeasure. See Johanns, 544 U.S. at 563 (noting the importance\nof political accountability of decisionmakers). The needs of effective governance command that the\nbar limiting government speech be high. The plaintiffs in this case have failed to show that the City\nof Union’s expenditures crossed the line separating a valid compelled subsidy from an\nunconstitutional one, and valid advocacy from prescription of orthodoxy.\n         For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court decision.\n\n\n\nto which governments do have the right to support their own positions on contested issues. As a result, a close analysis\nof these cases is of limited value in this case.\n         4\n           The dissent conclusorily rejects any distinction between permissible government speech reasonably related\nto governance functions and impermissible speech, for example, speech in support of a particular candidate for office.\nCommon sense militates and Supreme Court precedent requires us to reject the dissent’s position. The dissent wrongly\nignores not only the Supreme Court’s recent strengthening of its compelled subsidy jurisprudence in Johanns, but also\nSouthworth’s and Rosenberger’s more generalized holdings as to a government’s right to defend its own policies. A\nbright line rule against any governmental speech regarding any referendum would violate these clear dictates favoring\na more nuanced test for the propriety of such speech.\n\fNo. 04-4153               Kidwell et al. v.

So it is in this case. Here, we\nconfront state action that is at the same time innocuous yet threatening to our republican form of\ngovernment.

On the side of\nthe government, it can be argued that government must be permitted to speak or it will cease to be\neffective as a government. ACLU v.

On the other hand, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1801, “it is expected that [a\ngovernment official] will not attempt to influence the votes of others nor take any part in the\nbusiness of electioneering, that being deemed inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution and his\nduties to it.” 1 James D. Richardson, A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents,\n1789-1897, at 98-99 (1899).\n        The government speech doctrine, while in the early stages of development, provides support\nfor the proposition that government must be able to speak to function.     Government must be able\nto adopt policies and advocate for and defend against those policies.1 If private speech were the\nonly permissible speech regarding governing, the role of government would drastically change and\nthe idea that governmental policies reflect and are representative of the majority would be lost. This\nindicates that the government must, of course, be permitted to speak in order to govern and educate.\n       The taxpayers here have conceded the existence of the government speech doctrine as a\ngeneral matter, but draw a distinction between government speech related to governing and speech\nintended to campaign or to influence an election. I think they make a good point. There are several\ncases both at the state and federal district court level reviewing the propriety of governmental\nexpenditures designed to influence local elections. It is worthwhile to review these cases.\n       Most often these cases arise in the context of municipal bond initiatives where the local\ngovernment uses taxpayer funds to campaign in favor of the proposal. A prominent case from the\nSupreme Court of California is Stanson v. Mott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cal. 1976).

Ct. at 2068 (Souter, J.,\ndissenting). Thus, the government, when it speaks, ought to be required to make clear that it is in fact the government\nthat is speaking.

See Stanson, 551 P.2d at 8. The booklet in New Jersey exhorted “Vote Yes” on several\npages and warned of consequences “if You Don’t Vote Yes.” Id. The New Jersey Supreme Court,\nthrough Justice Brennan concluded that\n         the board made use of public funds to advocate one side only of the controversial\n         question without affording the dissenters the opportunity by means of that financed\n         medium to present their side, and this imperilled the propriety of the entire\n         expenditure. The public funds entrusted to the board belong equally to the\n         proponents and opponents of the proposition, and the use of the funds to finance not\n         the presentation of facts merely but also arguments to persuade the voters that only\n         one side has merit, gives the dissenters just cause for complaint. The expenditure\n         then is not within the implied power and is not lawful in the absence of express\n         authority from the legislature.\nCitizens to Protect Pub. Funds, 98 A.2d at 677.\n       In Stanson, the Supreme Court of California further remarked that “[i]ndeed, every court\nwhich has addressed the issue to date has found the use of public funds for partisan campaign\npurposes improper, either on the ground that such use was not explicitly authorized or on the broader\nground that such expenditures are never appropriate.” Stanson, 551 P.2d at 8-9 (citations omitted).\nCommenting further, the court noted that\n         [u]nderlying this uniform judicial reluctance to sanction the use of public funds for\n         election campaigns rests on an implicit recognition that such expenditures raise\n         potentially serious constitutional questions. A fundamental precept of this nation’s\n         democratic electoral process is that the government may not ‘take sides’ in election\n         contests or bestow an unfair advantage on one of several competing factions. A\n         principal danger feared by our country’s founders lay in the possibility that the\n         holders of governmental authority would use official power improperly to perpetuate\n         themselves, or their allies, in office; the selective use of public funds in election\n         campaigns, of course, raises the specter of just such an improper distortion of the\n         democratic electoral process.\nId. at 9 (citations omitted).2\n\n         2\n           The court also commented on “[t]he importance of government impartiality in electoral matters,” and observed\nthat in another recent case it had stated that “[a] fundamental goal of a democratic society is to attain the free and pure\nexpression of the voters’ choice of candidates” and that “our state and federal Constitutions mandate that the government\n\fNo. 04-4153               Kidwell et al. v.

Page 8\n\n\n        Notwithstanding its comments regarding the constitutional scope of the wrong, the court\nexplicitly denied resolving the federal constitutional question. According to the court, “we need not\nresolve the serious constitutional question that would be posed by an explicit legislative\nauthorization of the use of public funds for partisan campaigning, because the legislative provisions\nrelied upon by [the department] certainly do not authorize such expenditures.” Id. at 10.\n        Two additional features of the decision are relevant to my analysis of the issue. First, the\nSupreme Court of California refused to draw a distinction between public funds to support a\nparticular candidate and public funds to promote a ballot measure. Id. at 9. According to the court,\n“past authorities have not drawn such a distinction between ‘ballot measure’ and ‘candidate’\ncampaigning; to date the judicial decisions have uniformly held that the use of public funds for\ncampaign expenses is as improper in bond issue or other noncandidate elections as in candidate\nelections.” Id. Second, the court noted that reasonable expenditures for informational purposes\npose no problem, while exhortational campaign expenditures are improper. The court did concede\nthat “[p]roblems may arise, of course, in attempting to distinguish improper ‘campaign’ expenditures\nfrom proper ‘informational’ activities.” Id. at 11. The court instructed that “no hard and fast rule\ngoverns every case” and that “a careful consideration of such factors as the style, tenor and timing\nof the publication” are necessary to resolve the difficult question. Id. at 12.\n        The Stanson case is informative, but of course, not controlling. Additionally, although it\ndiscussed the constitutional question and expressed its concerns, the court explicitly declined to rule\non it. Instead, the court’s invalidation of the expenditures was based on legislative enactment (or\nan absence thereof) and not on the First Amendment. Moreover, in discussing the constitutional\nquestion, the court did not explicitly ground its concerns in any particular provision of the United\nStates Constitution. Rather, as discussed above, the court stated that the expenditures “raise\npotentially serious constitutional questions.” Id. at 9. These questions, it appears, relate to a\n“fundamental precept of this nation’s democratic electoral process,” to concerns over the use of\ngovernmental authority to “improperly perpetuate themselves,” and finally, to concerns over the\n“improper distortion of the democratic electoral process.” The concerns explicitly relate to the\nelectoral process and make no mention of government speech in the general process of governing.\nMoreover, it appears that the court’s expressed constitutional concerns stemmed from the structure\nand purpose of the Constitution and not necessarily the First Amendment (as alleged in the instant\ncase). Finally, the court did note that (to that date) every court that had reviewed such election or\ncampaign expenditures had found them improper, though all on statutory, and not constitutional\ngrounds.\n        Another case decided several years after the Stanson decision is District of Columbia\nCommon Cause v. District of Columbia, where the D.C. Circuit held that expenditures made by the\ncity government in a campaign to defeat a ballot proposal were illegal. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512373\"><a href=\"/opinion/512373/district-of-columbia-common-cause-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.

The Board of Education of School District No. 1 adopted a Resolution\ndeclaring its opposition to the proposed state constitutional amendment and urging that it be\ndefeated. The Resolution also authorized the use of school district “equipment, materials, supplies,\nfacilities, funds and employees necessary to (1) Distribute campaign literature to School District\nemployees, and the parents of children in the schools. (2) The use of telephones and facilities of\nthe School District during non-working hours by volunteers for the purpose of contacting the public\nto urge the defeat of this amendment.” Id.\n         The district court in Mountain States favorably cited to both Stanson and Citizens to Protect\nPublic Funds and found that the school district had exceeded its legislatively granted authority under\nstate law. Id. at 359-60. The court further commented on the constitutional question, though it was\nnot key to the resolution of the case. The court remarked that an interpretation of Colorado’s state\nCampaign Reform Act allowing this type of “partisan use of public funds . . . would violate the First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.” Id. at 360. According to the court, “[i]t is the duty\nof this Court to protect the political freedom of the people of Colorado. The freedom of speech and\nthe right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances are fundamental\ncomponents of guaranteed liberty in the United States.” Id. (citation omitted). Thus, the court\nappears to have based its ruling on both the First Amendment’s freedom of speech clause as well\nas the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances — an apparent link to the fact that\nthe election was over a voter initiated proposed constitutional amendment to alter the structure and\npowers of government.\n        The court further stated that “[a] use of the power of publicly owned resources to\npropagandize against a proposal made and supported by a significant number of those who were\ntaxed to pay for such resources is an abridgment of those fundamental freedoms.” Id. Expressing\nconcern that governmental opposition to a proposed constitutional amendment would have “the\neffect of shifting the ultimate source of power away from the people,” the court concluded that\n“[p]ublicly financed opposition to the exercise of that right contravenes the meaning of both the First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution and Article V, Section 1 of the Constitution of\nColorado.” Id. at 361. Adding an additional basis, the court stated that “the expenditure of public\nfunds in opposition [to a citizen led effort] violates a basic precept of this nation’s democratic\nprocess. Indeed, it would seem so contrary to the root philosophy of a republican form of\ngovernment as might cause this Court to resort to the guaranty clause in Article IV, Section 4 of the\nUnited States Constitution.” Id.\n        In sum, the Mountain States court appears to have held that the expenditure of public funds\nviolated state statutes, the state constitution, and the federal constitution. In reaching that conclusion\nwith respect to the federal constitution, however, while the court mentioned the First Amendment,\nit devoted little explanation as to why citizens’s free speech rights are violated in this situation.\nInstead, the court focused more on basic democratic principles, fundamental freedoms, and\nguaranteed liberties, and it did so emphatically with reference to the fact that this involved a voter\ninitiated constitutional amendment and the government acted in opposition to it. In doing so, the\ncourt appears to have concluded that public expenditures on campaigns in this situation undermines\nthe validity of elections and the constitutional amendment process and shifts the balance of power\naway from the citizens. The court’s opinion demonstrates that grounding this principle in a specific\nconstitutional provision (as opposed to the structure and democratic purpose of the constitution)\nproves somewhat difficult.\n       While the taxpayers rely on Mountain States Legal Foundation, the City relies on Alabama\nLibertarian Party v. City of Birmingham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1874642\"><a href=\"/opinion/1874642/alabama-libertarian-party-v-birmingham-ala/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D. Ala. 1988). Like this Court is\nasked to do in the instant case, the district court in Alabama Libertarian Party considered only the\n\fNo. 04-4153               Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                               Page 10\n\n\nfederal constitutional question and did not consider any claims arising under state law. There were\ntwo elections at issue in Alabama Libertarian Party. The first was an election regarding a city-\nproposed property tax increase for library enhancements and a levy on telephone subscribers for\nenhanced 911 emergency services. Id. at 815. Prior to the election, “the City launched a\npromotional campaign to encourage passage of the propositions.” Id. The campaign included\nnewspaper and radio advertisements. Id. The second was another special election held a year later\nover a proposed bond issue and this time the City distributed leaflets and brochures in favor of the\nbond issue. Id. The taxpayer plaintiffs claimed that the campaigning violated their First\nAmendment rights.\n        The district court in Alabama Libertarian Party began by reviewing the Supreme Court’s\ndecision, Abood v. Detroit Board of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109661\"><a href=\"/opinion/109661/abood-v-detroit-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1977). In Abood, the Court considered\nwhether organizations to which dues must be paid as a mandatory condition of state employment\nmay use those dues to advance political causes not supported by all of the members. The Court held\nthat the exactions violated the First Amendment by allowing the funds to be used for political and\nideological purposes — that is, the First Amendment generally prohibits compelled subsidies for\npolitical purposes. Id.\n        After considering Abood, the district court concluded that the “critical” issue is “whether a\nportion of plaintiffs’ tax funds were expended for ‘political’ and ‘ideological’ purposes.” Alabama\nLibertarian Party, 694 F. Supp. at 817. The district court then concluded that the campaigns waged\nby the City and the funds spent were not on “political” or “ideological” causes, but rather were\n“related to the common needs of all citizens.” Id. (“The court does not believe that the City’s\nadvertising campaign was political or ideological in nature.”). Rejecting the taxpayers’\nconstitutional claims, the district court found that “the City leadership has determined to promote\na cause consistent with the common needs of its citizens. It is not requiring plaintiffs to be the\ncourier for an ideological or political message.” Id. The court appears to have drawn a distinction\nbetween situations where funds are “used to support a particular candidate, doctrine or ideology”\nand the case before it where “the City merely solicited its citizens to provide funds to supply the\nperceived needs common to all.” Id. In the latter situation, the court reasoned, the “City and its\nofficials not only have the right, but the duty, to determine the needs of its citizens and to provide\nfunds to service those needs.” Id.\n        The court also noted that the City had already passed ordinances in favor of the levies and\ntherefore had already taken public positions on the issues — thus, spending funds to advertise was\nno more than publicizing the positions already taken. Id. at 818. Drawing distinctions between past\ncases, the district court noted that in Common Cause and Mountain States Legal Foundation, the\nissue confronted was a citizens’s initiative election while in Alabama, the election was over the\nCity’s own initiative. Id. at 819. Thus, the district court stated that “[w]hile this court may not agree\nthat a governmental entity can never take sides in an initiative election, it certainly cannot agree that\na governmental entity cannot expend funds to even publicly endorse its own measures.” Id. The\ncourt found further support from its ruling through the political process, noting that citizens who\ndisapprove of the governmental election campaigning may dissent at the polls. Id. at 820.\nMoreover, the court also suggested that not permitting         the government to advocate “would be\nviolative of their own First Amendment rights.” Id.3 Finally, the court concluded that\n         It would be a strange system indeed which would allow the City to determine its\n         needs, allow it to adopt ordinances calling for elections to fulfill those needs, allow\n         it to bear the expense of those elections, and then require it to stand silently by before\n\n\n         3\n          Presumably the district court was discussing the First Amendment rights of the individual city officials rather\nthan asserting that the First Amendment guarantees the government the freedom of speech — which it does not.\n\fNo. 04-4153           Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                  Page 11\n\n\n        the issues are voted on. Obviously, the City is not neutral under such circumstances\n        and should not be required to appear so.\nId. at 821.\n         The district court’s opinion in Alabama Libertarian Party is interesting for several reasons\nin addition to the fact that it is the only opinion to address solely the First Amendment and no\nquestions of state law. The first point of note is the district court’s conclusion that the “critical”\nissue is whether the funds spent are used for “political” or “ideological” purposes. More curious is\nthe district court’s conclusion that the governmental advertising campaign exhorting the citizens to\n“VOTE YES!” was neither political nor ideological, but rather “related to the common needs of all\ncitizens.” I do not endorse a distinction between electioneering expenditures for the common needs\nof citizens versus expenditures for political purposes. To determine that something is in the\ncommon needs of citizens is itself a political decision. Thus, I do not think that a principled basis\nfor such a distinction exists, and I do not find this approach to be useful in this context.\n        Second, the Alabama Libertarian Party court, like the district court in Mountain States Legal\nFoundation, emphasized the fact that the Alabama election was for tax levies and not a\nconstitutional amendment. The district court, however, did not explain why a different result is\ncompelled by this distinction. And third, the district court drew another distinction between\ngovernmental opposition to a citizen sponsored initiative and governmental promotion of proposed\nissues. Stated another way, the court appeared to find it more constitutionally troubling for the\ngovernment to say “Vote No,” than for it to say “Vote Yes.”\n        In Cook v. Baca, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2361456\"><a href=\"/opinion/2361456/cook-v-baca/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.N.M. 2000), a New Mexico district court\nconfronted the First Amendment constitutional issue posed by these cases and sided with the district\ncourt in Alabama Libertarian Party. At the outset, the court noted that “[a]t some threshold level,\na public entity must refrain from spending public funds to promote a partisan position during an\nelection campaign.” Id. at 1227 (quoting Carter v. City of Las Cruces, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1311083\"><a href=\"/opinion/1311083/carter-v-city-of-las-cruces-new-mexico/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.M. Ct. App.\n1996)). The court was also “[m]indful that unconstitutional practices may be their ‘first footing’ in\nthe ‘mildest and least repulsive form.’” Id. (quoting Boyd v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91573\"><a href=\"/opinion/91573/boyd-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 635\n(1886)). Nevertheless, the court found “no ominous threat to the First Amendment in Defendants’\nminimal actions,” and rejected the taxpayers’s claim. In doing so, the district court, like the court\nin Alabama Libertarian Party drew a distinction between opposition to a citizen proposed state\nconstitutional amendment and the expenditure of funds “to promote a tax initiative which was\nproposed by the mayor himself.” Id. at 1227 n.18 (emphasis deleted). The district court concluded\nby mentioning the Supreme Court’s decision in Board of Regents of the Univ. of Wisconsin System\nv. Southworth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621017\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621017/board-of-regents-of-univ-of-wis-system-v-southworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). There the Court stated that\n        It is inevitable that government will adopt and pursue programs and policies within\n        its constitutional powers but which nevertheless are contrary to the profound beliefs\n        and sincere convictions of some of its citizens. The government, as a general rule,\n        may support valid programs and policies by taxes or other exactions binding on\n        protesting parties. Within this broader principle it seems inevitable that funds raised\n        by the government will be spent for speech and other expression to advocate and\n        defend its own policies.\nId. at 229. The district court, however, did not necessarily address any differences, should they\nexist, between ordinary advocacy and defense of valid governmental programs and attempts to\ninfluence elections.\n         To recap, courts have been hostile toward the type of electioneering expenditures at issue\nin this case. See e.g., District of Columbia Common Cause v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512373\"><a href=\"/opinion/512373/district-of-columbia-common-cause-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.\n\fNo. 04-4153                Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                                  Page 12\n\n\nCir. 1988) (affirming district court’s decision holding expenditures improper on statutory grounds,\nbut not reaching constitutional question); Cook, 95 F. Supp. 2d at 1227 (“At some threshold level,\na public entity must refrain from spending public funds to promote a partisan position during an\nelection campaign.”); Mountain States Legal Foundation, 459 F. Supp. at 360 (“[T]he expenditure\nof public funds in opposition [to a citizen led constitutional amendment] violates a basic precept of\nthis nation’s democratic process. Indeed, it would seem so contrary to the root philosophy of a\nrepublican form of government . . .”); Stanson, 551 P.2d at 9 (“A fundamental precept of this\nnation’s democratic electoral process is that the government may not ‘take sides’ in election contests\nor bestow an unfair advantage on one of several competing factions.”). The vast majority of courts\nthat have issued injunctions  against governmental campaign expenditures have done so based, for\nthe most part, on state law.4 The courts finding governmental campaign expenditures to be unlawful\nbased on state or local law have, in dicta, found additional support in various parts of the\nConstitution — the First Amendment, the general purpose and structure of the Constitution, the\nGuaranty Clause, and “democratic principles.” On the other hand, the courts finding no\nconstitutional problem with the expenditures have done so on various and inconsistent bases. Some\ncourts have utilized traditional forum analysis in the context of viewpoint discrimination. Other\ncourts have simply held that government has a right to speak at all times and need not remain neutral\nin the context of an election. The district court in this case applied a case involving a state’s\ndecision to fly the Confederate flag over the state house — basically an application of forum\nanalysis and consideration of viewpoint discrimination.\n        I agree with the courts who have opined that electioneering expenditures raise serious\nconstitutional concerns. I concede that the government may ordinarily speak to advocate and defend\nits own policies. The caveat, however, is always that the citizens’ remedy is at the ballot box in the\nnext election. In these cases, however, the government is distorting the only check on its power.\nI am not sure I would limit this argument to the confines of the First Amendment; rather, to me, it\nis more of a structural argument regarding democratic principles and the structure and purpose of\nthe constitution. In Burt v. Blumenauer, the Oregon Supreme Court persuasively wrote that: “It\nhardly seems necessary to rely on the First Amendment, at least when government resources are\ndevoted to promoting one side in an election on which the legitimacy of the government itself rests.\nThe principles of representative government enshrined in our constitutions would limit government\nintervention on behalf of its own candidates or against their opponents even if the First Amendment\nand its state equivalents had never been adopted.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1174938\"><a href=\"/opinion/1174938/burt-v-blumenauer/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175 (Or. 1985).\n        The courts that have reviewed these questions have almost universally relied upon state or\nlocal law to invalidate them. In dicta, however, many courts have gone on to speculate as to the\nconstitutional question. These courts have referenced the Framers’ concerns with governmental\ncampaigning and the expenditure of funds in that context, specifically citing the Framers’ concern\n\n\n         4\n           As discussed earlier, the plaintiffs’s state law claim was dismissed by the district court for a failure to exhaust\nstate remedies and the plaintiffs did not appeal this decision. We therefore have before us only a First Amendment claim.\nWe do not know the status of any state proceedings or if they exist, but I take note of a provision of the Union Charter\nthat states:\n         Section 5.09. Public Information on Issues. The council shall have the power to appropriate and\n         authorize the expenditure of public funds to provide information to the members of the public in\n         connection with elections on proposed tax levies and bond issues for the purposes of the Municipality,\n         and other issues affecting the Municipality and not involving the election of candidates for a public\n         office, or the recall of a member of the Council.\nWhy the plaintiffs have not more vigorously pursued their claim under state law, or why they have not argued for\npendant jurisdiction, we can only speculate. Thus, the majority’s decision that these specific expenditures do not run\nafoul of the First Amendment might prove irrelevant if Section 5.09 is interpreted to permit, as Stanson did, expenditures\nto inform, but not to persuade.\n\fNo. 04-4153                Kidwell et al. v. City of Union et al.                                                Page 13\n\n\nwith attempts to perpetuate a government in office. In this case, we are faced with tax levies and\nfire departments. One might claim that, as at least one court did, these are issues for the common\ngood and therefore are of little constitutional concern. Continuing down this path, one might ask\nwhether the government could campaign and expend funds promoting a city council resolution\nextending the term lengths of current office holders, say for one year, for ten years, or even for life.\nThis idea, and the idea that governmental funds could be spent in an effort to perpetuate a\ngovernment in office is no doubt antithetical to the values underlying the Constitution.\n          There is no constitutional provision, however, that says governments may not make attempts\nto perpetuate themselves or spend funds pursuant thereto. And, there is no principled way, as I see\nit, to distinguish between the fire department election and any other — if one is unconstitutional, the\nothers must be as well. Another example from recent history (setting aside state laws that may\nprevent the practice) — could former California Governor Gray Davis have expended governmental\nfunds to campaign, advertise, and electioneer against his recall? Yet again another scenario that\nappears antithetical to democratic principles. Furthermore, there appears to be nothing in the First\nAmendment or any other constitutional provision that would prevent the government from spending\ntaxpayer funds or actively campaigning in support of a particular candidate. It would tear at the\nfabric of democracy to permit as much despite the absence of a specific constitutional provision to\ndefeat this type of governmental abuse, and I see no relevant distinction between that abuse and the\none before this Court today.\n        I believe that the Constitution properly prohibits the government from having a horse in the\nrace when it comes to elections. When government advocates on one side of an issue, the ultimate\nsource of governing power is shifted away from the people and the threat of official doctrine exists.\nOf course, the threat is not as omnipresent today in the United States as it is in some other countries.\nThere is no real evidence in any of these cases on point that the government as speaker crowded out\nprivate speech. There is no evidence that the government sought to suppress or in any way\ndiscourage other speech of a contrary nature. The absence of this evidence, however, does not in\nmy opinion cure the underlying evil — that is, ordinary democratic controls are insufficient as a\nremedy in  situations where governmental influence threatens to undermine the independent political\nprocess.5 Governmental advocacy and campaign expenditures could arguably threaten to undermine\n\n         5\n           Perhaps it is time for the Supreme Court to reconsider its Guarantee Clause jurisprudence. The Guarantee\nClause, found in Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution states: “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this\nUnion, a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion and on Application of the\nLegislature or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.” When a claim\nis alleged under the Guarantee Clause, the Supreme Court has dismissed it stating some version of the following: “As\nto the guaranty to every state of a republican form of government, it is well settled that the questions arising under [this\nclause] are political, not judicial, in character, and thus for the consideration of the Congress and not the courts.” Ohio\nex rel.

In the ordinary case of governmental action outside of an election, political controls can\nremedy citizen disagreement with governmental actions. Citizens can make their voices known at\nthe ballot box in the next election by voting current officeholders out. Governmental electioneering,\nhowever, diminishes the effectiveness of the political response and threatens underlying\nconstitutional values and democratic principles. The outcome of elections ideally should reflect the\npure will of the people unpolluted by government electioneering. Where the political response\ncannot provide an adequate remedy, it can be argued that courts must step in.\n         Thus, I would hold that the Constitution requires governmental neutrality in elections — that\nis, the Constitution permits the government to educate and inform the public, but it may not cross\nthe line into advocacy. Thus, government could provide factual information in newsletters and other\nforms of communication with the electorate. As the Supreme Court of California commented in\nStanson, it would not always be easy finding the line of demarcation between informing and\nadvocacy, but courts should look closely at the facts of each case, including the words used, the tone\nof the communication, the timing, and any other relevant factors. Moreover, government may\nprovide equal access to a forum (as it does in so many other contexts) allowing both sides of the\ndebate to advance their positions. Thus, a governmental newsletter such as the one at issue in this\ncase could grant equal space to competing factions to make their best case to the electorate. This\nposition, I think, would more appropriately reflective of the balance the Framers sought to strike in\nour democratic structure and goes a long way to ensuring that the true power remains with the\npeople.\n         For these reasons, I must respectfully dissent from today’s majority opinion.\n\n\n\n\nState of a republican form of government”).\nMore recently, the Court has suggested that perhaps not all claims under the Guarantee Clause present nonjusticiable\npolitical questions.
