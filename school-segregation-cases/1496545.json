Following a decade of\n\nenvironmental review and litigation, PUD obtained an environmental impact statement\n\n(BIS). Next, PUD needed to obtain easements over the proposed land. PUD negotiated\n\nwith approximately 85 percent of the property owners for easements on their land.\n\nUltimately, PUD filed a petition for condemnation against the remaining property owners.\n\nThis included the State, l which owned school trust lands that were required for the\n\nproject.\n\n       Conservation Northwest (CNW), a group engaged in conservation activities, filed\n\na motion to intervene. The court granted CNW's motion. Both CNW and the State filed\n\nmotions for summary judgment, arguing that PUD lacks the authority to condemn school\n\ntrust land. The State stipulated to the entry of the order on public use and necessity,\n\nwhich addressed the narrow issues of whether the transmission line project was a public\n\n\n\n      1 We refer to the following parties collectively as the \"State:\" Christine Davis,\nTrevor Kelpman, Dan Gebbers, Reba Gebbers, William Weaver, Peter Goldmark, and the\n\n                                              2\n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv.

PUD then cross appealed, challenging the trial court's\n\norder granting intervention to CNW. The State also appealed the summary judgment\n\norder, contending that PUD had no statutory authority to condemn the State trust lands at\n\nissue here.\n\n       We conclude that the State trust lands may be condemned as a matter oflaw. We\n\naffirm summary judgment in favor of PUD and the denial of summary judgment to the\n\nState and CNW. Given that we affirm the trial court's order on the PUD's condemnation\n\nauthority, we need not address the PUD's cross appeal challenging CNW's limited\n\nintervention.\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n       Introduction. In 1889, Washington became a state. At that time, the federal\n\ngovernment granted to Washington approximately three million acres of land for\n\n\nState of Washington.\n\n                                            3\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\neducational purposes and the support of common schools. Enabling Act, ch. 180,\n\n§§ 10, 11,25 STAT. 676 (1889). The lands consisted of sections 16 and 36 of each\n\ntownship in Washington. Id. Section 11 of the Enabling Act reserved these lands for\n\n\"school purposes only\" and set forth certain restrictions on their sale and lease to ensure\n\nthat the lands would derive to the sole benefit of Washington schools. Id. This concern is\n\nechoed in the Washington Constitution. The Constitution provides that all \"public lands\n\ngranted to the state are held in trust for all the people\" and restricts the manner in which\n\nsuch trust lands may be disposed. CONST. art. XVI, § 1.\n\n        The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is the state agency charged by the\n\nlegislature with the management of these lands. In 1957, the management responsibilities\n\nwere consolidated in DNR, which was created to provide effective and efficient\n\nmanagement of these state lands. RCW 43.30.010, .030. Peter Goldmark, the elected\n\nCommissioner of Public Lands (Commissioner), serves as the administrator ofDNR. The\n\nCommissioner is a member of the Board of Natural Resources that establishes policies\n\nregarding the appropriate management of state lands and resources. RCW 43.30.205,\n\n.215.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\n       DNR has been granted the exclusive statutory authority and discretion to lease trust\n\nlands for various purposes, including commercial, agricultural, and recreational uses.\n\nRCW 79.13.010.\n\n       In 1996, Okanogan PUD proposed a new transmission line to improve electrical\n\nservice to the citizens of Methow Valley. PUD sought to construct the transmission line\n\nand substation between Pateros and Twisp (hereinafter the \"project,,). 2\n\n       From the initial planning for the project in 1996, the project has been subject to\n\nextensive scrutiny. Gebbers v. Okanogan County Pub. Util. Dist. No.1, 144 Wn. App.\n\n371,376, 183 PJd 324, review denied, 165 Wn.2d 1004, 198 PJd 511 (2008). As part of\n\nthe review, PUD and the U.S. Forest Service prepared a draft EIS seeking input from\n\ncitizens, environmental groups, and governmental agencies. Fifteen alternatives were\n\nidentified and six alternatives and a no-action alternative were approved for\n\nconsideration. PUD conducted two public hearings, held several public meetings, and\n\nresponded to over 400 public comment letters. Id. A final EIS was released in March\n\n2006, and PUD made its selection later that month. Id.\n\n\n\n\n       2A lengthy discussion of the project is contained in this court's opinion in Gebbers\nv. Okanogan County Pub. Util. Dist. No.1, 144 Wn. App. 371, 183 PJd 324, review\ndenied, 165 Wn.2d 1004, 198 P.3d 511 (2008).\n\n                                             5\n\n\fNo. 29 12 l-9-III; No. 29l23-5-II1\nPUDv. State\n\n\n       Following 10 years of environmental review, the superior court and this court\n\naffinned PUD's decisions regarding the project and the sufficiency of the final EIS. Id. at\n\n393. We held that the environmental effects of the project were adequately disclosed,\n\ndiscussed, and substantiated in the fmal EIS. We also held that PUD did not act\n\narbitrarily and capriciously in selecting the transmission line route. Id. The Supreme\n\nCourt denied review. Gebbers, 165 Wn.2d at 1004.\n\n       PUD negotiated the easements required for the project with approximately 85\n\npercent of the property owners along the transmission line route, but eventually filed\n\neminent domain proceedings against the remaining owners, including the State. The State\n\nlands in question are school trust lands managed by the DNR. PUD filed its amended\n\npetition for condemnation on April 14, 2010.\n\n       At summary judgment on the condemnation petition, CNW argued that the\n\nproposed Pateros-Twisp transmission line would bisect the largest contiguous publicly\n\nowned shrub-steppe habitat in the Methow Valley and would have multiple adverse\n\nenvironmental impacts, including the introduction of noxious weeds, fragmentation of\n\nwildlife habitat, increased fire risk, and exacerbating erosion and sedimentation.\n\n       The State argued that it leased these lands for cattle grazing to generate money for\n\ntrust beneficiaries and to preserve this land as a part of the trust corpus for the benefit of\n\n\n                                               6\n\n\fNo. 29121-9-111; No. 29123-5-111\nPUDv. State\n\n\nfuture generations. To this end, the State had entered into enforceable leases for the use\n\nof these parcels and had issued pennits to allow for cattle grazing on certain parcels. In\n\ntotal, the proposed Pateros-Twisp transmission line would cross state trust lands that are\n\nsubject to five active grazing leases and two grazing pennit range areas. These leases and\n\npennits actively generate income to benefit Washington schools.\n\n       However, the leases on the property generate less than $3,000 annually for the\n\nschool beneficiaries, not including DNR administrative costs. PUD's proposed easements\n\npass over no more than an estimated 4 percent of the area of anyone lease and as little as\n\n0.02 percent for one of the leased areas. PUD modified the project to eliminate all\n\npennanent road construction within the project.\n\n       Intervention. Prior to the hearing on public use and necessity, CNW filed a motion\n\nto intervene as a respondent in support of the State. It is undisputed that CNW has no\n\nlegal or equitable property interest in the trust lands. CNW states: \"The issue at stake in\n\nthis litigation ... directly affects Conservation Northwest's ability to continue its work as\n\na representative and protector of state trust land and its ability to protect its own interests\n\nas an organization involved in land conservation.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 603. Despite\n\nopposition by PUD, the superior court granted limited intervention under CR 24.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\n\fNo. 29121-9-111; No. 29123-5-111\nPUDv. State\n\n\n       Motions for Summary Judgment. Following intervention, both CNW and the State\n\nfiled separate motions for summary judgment, arguing that the PUD does not have the\n\nauthority to condemn school trust lands. PUD also filed a motion for summary judgment.\n\n       The court rejected this statutory argument and concluded that PUD has the express\n\nauthority to condemn school trust lands under RCW 54.16.020 and .050. The court also\n\nrejected the contention that school trust lands cannot be subject to condemnation because\n\nthey are dedicated to a public use.\n\n       The trial court entered orders denying summary judgment to CNW and the State,\n\nand granting summary judgment to PUD on the issue of condemnation authority.\n\nBecause the State did not otherwise oppose an order on public use and necessity, the court\n\nalso entered its \"Findings of Fact, Conclusions ofLaw, and Order on Public Use and\n\nNecessity.\" CP at 14-18.\n\n       Appeals. CNW filed a notice of appeal challenging the summary judgment in\n\nPUD's favor, as well as the order on public use and necessity. PUD then cross appealed\n\nthe order granting intervention to CNW. The Attorney General declined to appeal the\n\ntrial court's decision despite the Commissioner's request that it do so. Subsequently, the\n\nState filed a contingent notice of appeal of the order denying summary judgment and the\n\norder on public use and necessity. Later, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that the\n\n\n                                             8\n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUD v. State\n\n\nAttorney General was required to prosecute an appeal on behalf of the Commissioner.\n\nGoldmark v. McKenna, 172 Wn.2d 568, 259 P.3d 1095 (2011). The State then continued\n\nthis appeal with special counsel.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       After the PUD filed its condemnation petition, the State and CNW filed separate\n\nmotions for summary judgment arguing that PUD does not have the authority to condemn\n\nthe school trust lands. The State concedes that PUD has the statutory authority to\n\ncondemn, but the State argues that the school trust lands in question are not subject to\n\ncondemnation because they are already devoted to a particular use by law. CNW argues\n\nthat chapter 54.16 RCW does not grant PUD express authority to condemn. CNW\n\nabandoned this argument on appeal. CNW adopts the State's arguments. CNWargues\n\nthat state school lands are dedicated to a public use as a matter of law.\n\n       This court reviews the trial court's summary judgment orders de novo. Moeller v.\n\nFarmers Ins. Co., 173 Wn.2d 264,271,267 P.3d 998 (2011). We engage in the same\n\ninquiry as the trial court. Hisle v. Todd Pac. Shipyards Corp., 151 Wn.2d 853,860,93\n\nP.3d 108 (2004).\n\n       The property in dispute is designated school trust land. Significantly, chapter 1,\n\nsection 6(e) of the LAWS OF 1931, codified at RCW 54.16.050, specifically authorizes\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\npublic utility districts to condemn school lands for transmission lines. RCW 54.16.050\n\nreads, in part, that a public utility district\n\n       may take, condemn and purchase, purchase and acquire any public and\n       private property, franchises and property rights, including state,\n       county, and school lands, and property and littoral and water rights,for\n       ... transmission lines, and all other facilities necessary or convenient.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       The PUD statute itself does not contain any limitation on the type of state land that\n\nmay be condemned. RCW 54.16.050. However, the definition of \"state lands\" in the\n\npublic lands act, Title 79 RCW, excludes lands \"devoted to or reserved for a particular\n\nuse by law.\" RCW 79.02.01O(14)(h).3 The critical issue here is whether these school\n\nlands are dedicated to a particular purpose or use and, therefore, are not subject to\n\ncondemnation.\n\n       A. Dedicated to a Public Purpose. On appeal, the State argues that all school\n\ntrust lands are dedicated to a public purpose and are, therefore, per se exempt from\n\ncondemnation.\n\n       The State's argument is not persuasive for several reasons. First, the public lands\n\nact defines \"state lands\" as including school trust lands \"that are not devoted to or\n\n\n\n       We refer to the current version ofRCW 79.02.010; subsequent amendments\n       3\nrenumbered the sections and were not substantive.\n\n                                                 10 \n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\nreserved for a particular use by law.\" RCW 79.02.010(14)(h). This means that not all\n\nschool lands are so reserved or there would be no need for the qualifier. Second, the\n\nState's interpretation would render meaningless the many statutes that specifically allow\n\nlocal government to condemn state and school trust lands. See, e.g., RCW 8.12.030\n\n(cities and towns); RCW 53.34.170 (port districts), and RCW 54.16.050 (public utility\n\ndistricts).\n\n        Finally, the State's argument ignores Washington Supreme Court precedent. In\n\nRoberts v. City o/Seattle, 63 Wash. 573, 574, 116 P. 25 (1911), the city of Seattle\n\ninstituted an action to condemn a 30-foot strip of university grounds. The court\n\nconcluded that no provision in the Enabling Act or the Constitution provided that school\n\nlands could not be sold. Id. at 575. The court held that the fact that school trust lands are\n\ndevoted to the purpose of financing education was insufficient to exempt the property\n\nfrom condemnation. Moreover, the court stated:\n\n               It is also argued that the land taken was already devoted to a public\n        use-that of education-and therefore cannot be taken for another public\n        use. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the 30-foot strip ofland\n        in question is actually in use by the university, and there is nothing to\n        indicate that the taking of the strip of land will impair the use of the land\n        remaining. On the other hand, the record shows that the remaining land\n        will be benefited. Under this condition it may be taken.\n\nId. at 576.\n\n\n                                              11 \n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\n       Dedication to a public use reserves the land from subsequent sale. Contrary to the\n\nassertions of the State, dedication to a public use requires more than simply putting the\n\nproperty to a productive use. The Washington Supreme Court has described dedication\n\nas: (1) dedication by act of the 1egislature;4 (2) \"platted, dedicated, and reserved\" land for\n\na public use;5 (3) segregating the land from the public domain and appropriating it to the\n\npublic by \"due dedication,'.6 and dedication by some \"official act or declaration.,,7 Most\n\nsignificantly, the Supreme Court held that devotion to the purpose of education is\n\ninsufficient to prevent condemnation. Roberts, 63 Wash. at 576.\n\n       The State reads State v. Jefferson County, 91 Wash. 454, 157 P. 1097 (1916) to\n\nhold that sovereign lands cannot be condemned. However, Jefferson County, which did\n\nnot involve trust lands, held that the authority to sell or condemn sovereign lands must not\n\nbe presumed, but must be expressly conferred by statute. See Jefferson County, 91 Wash.\n\n\n\n\n       4 State   v. Jefferson County, 91 Wash. 454,455-56, 157 P. 1097 (1916) (waterway\npermanently reserved from sale by statute).\n        5 Id. at 455.\n        6 City ofTacoma v. Taxpayers ofTacoma, 49 Wn.2d 781, 797,307 P.2d 567\n(1957), rev'd on other grounds, 357 U.S. 320, 78 S. Ct. 1209,2 L. Ed. 2d 1345 (1958).\nWhile this case did not explain how the land was dedicated, the case stated that the land\nwas \"dedicated.\"\n        7 City ofTacoma v. State, 121 Wash. 448, 452, 209 P. 700 (1922). PUD argues\nthat \"dedicated to a public use\" is the functional equivalent of \"devoted to or reserved for\na particular use by law.\" See RCW 79.02.010(14)(h).\n\n                                              12\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\nat 458-59. And the PUD condemnation statute expressly allows for the condemnation of\n\nschool lands. RCW 54.16.050.\n\n       Since Roberts, the Supreme Court has continued to approve the condemnation of\n\nschool trust lands, and other types of trust lands, even though they exist for the purpose of\n\nserving various trust beneficiaries. See City ofSeattle v. State, 54 Wn.2d 139, 147,338\n\nP.2d 126 (1959); City ofTacoma v. State, 121 Wash. 448,453,209 P. 700 (1922). The\n\nState argues that Roberts, City ofTacoma, and City ofSeattle are erroneous. The trial\n\ncourt disagreed, and so do we.\n\n       In City ofSeattle, the city of Seattle instituted a condemnation proceeding to\n\nacquire state school and capitol building lands for use in its proposed Tolt River aquifer.\n\nCity ofSeattle, 54 Wn.2d at 141. The court concluded that the city had the power to\n\ncondemn state property that was not dedicated to a public use. Id. at 147. In City of\n\nTacoma v. Taxpayers ofTacoma, 49 Wn.2d 781, 801,307 P.2d 567 (1957), rev 'd on\n\nother grounds, 357 U.S. 320, 78 S. Ct. 1209, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1345 (1958), the court\n\nconcluded that the city lacked the statutory authority to condemn state lands previously\n\ndedicated to a public use. State lands not dedicated to a public use are subject to\n\ncondemnation. City ofSeattle, 54 Wn.2d at 147. Here, the school lands are not dedicated\n\nto a public use and are, therefore, subject to condemnation.\n\n\n                                             13\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv: State\n\n\n       B. Reservation from Sale. As stated above, under RCW 79.02.010(14)(h), school\n\ntrust lands are reserved if they are \"devoted to or reserved for a particular use.\" In City of\n\nSeattle, the court found that the capitol building trust lands-which are ofthe same\n\ncharacter as school trust lands-were not devoted to or reserved for a particular use by\n\nlaw:\n\n       It is admitted by the state in this action that the capitol building\n       lands which the city of Seattle seeks to condemn are not devoted to or\n       reserved for a particular use but are subject to sale. If the legislature had\n       intended to exempt such state lands from condemnation, it would seem that\n       it would have expressly so limited the term \"state lands,\" as used in\n       RCW 8.12.030.... This the legislature did not see fit to do, and the realtor\n       suggests no reason why such a limitation should be inferred.\n\nCity ofSeattle, 54 Wn.2d at 147.\n\n       In other words, reservation from sale is critical to determining whether public\n\nlands have been reserved for a particular purpose. In Fransen v. Board ofNatural\n\nResources, state forest lands were found to be reserved for a particular purpose by law\n\nbecause they are'\" forever reserved from sale.'\" Fransen v. Bd ofNatural Res., 66\n\nWn.2d 672,673,404 P.2d 432 (1965) (quoting former RCW 76.12.120, recodified as\n\nRCW 79.22.050 (Laws of2003, ch. 334, § 220)). Jefferson County explained that\n\ndedicated land is '\" severed from the mass of public lands, [so] that no subsequent law, or\n\nproclamation, or sale would be construed to embrace it, or operate upon it.' \" Jefferson\n\n\n\n                                             14 \n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv.

The lands at issue here are not devoted to or\n\nreserved for a particular use by law. Moreover, the school trust lands here are not\n\ndedicated to a public use. The State cannot show that the trust lands at issue have been\n\ndedicated to a public use. Likewise, the State cannot argue that these trust lands are\n\ndedicated to a public use simply because they may be actively managed by DNR.\n\n          The fact that the State leased the trust lands for grazing does not reserve those\n\nlands for a particular use by law. Even trust lands subject to grazing leases shall not be\n\nsold during the life of the lease. RCW 79.11.290. And here, the specific leases involved\n\nreserve the State's right to sell the property, reserving the right to sell upon 60 days'\n\nnotice.\n\n          In short, the sale of leased school trust lands is simply limited to certain conditions,\n\nbut these conditions are insufficient to fall within the statutory language of \"devoted to or\n\nreserved for a particular use by law.\" RCW 79.02.010(14)(h).\n\n          Furthermore, leased lands are not devoted to a particular use by RCW 79.13.370.\n\nThis provision merely states that once a grazing lease is issued, the lessee may only use\n\nthe land for the purposes set forth in the lease.

CNW argues that school lands are exempt from condemnation because\n\nthey are public trusts.\n\n       The Washington Enabling Act and Constitution impose an express trust and\n\ncorresponding trust management principles on state trust lands, including the land at issue\n\nhere.

Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry.,\n\n102 Mn. 52,55, 112 N.W. 860 (1907)).\n\n\n\n\n                                              16 \n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\n       In short, the examination of the language of Washington's Enabling Act and\n\nConstitution reveal that state trust lands are administered under trust management\n\nprinciples to benefit public schools as the trust beneficiaries and are subject to statutory\n\ncontrols and authority.\n\n       Regardless of the trust's purpose, the legislature granted PUDs the authority to\n\ncondemn state trust lands. RCW 54.16.050 authorizes the condemnation of state and\n\nschool lands.\n\n       A statute shall not be interpreted in a manner that renders a provision meaningless\n\nor creates an absurd or strained result. Pierce County v. State, 144 Wn. App. 783, 852,\n\n185 P.3d 594 (2008). The State and CNW assert that the PUD does not have authority to\n\ncondemn trust land generally or the trust land here. But following this logic, RCW\n\n54.16.050 would have meaningless terms that would create an absurd result.\n\n       D. Easements. Regardless of whether a sale is at issue, by the State's own\n\nadmission, easements can be granted over trust lands for grazing. Here, PUD does not\n\nseek fee ownership of school trust lands. In addition to PUD's express condemnation\n\nauthority under RCW 54.16.050, the legislature also reserved PUD's right to condemn\n\neasements over state lands in DNR's land management statutes:\n\n       The foregoing sections relating to the acquiring of rights-of-way and\n       overflow rights through, over and across lands belonging to the state, shall\n\n                                              17 \n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\n       not be construed as exclusive or as affecting the right of municipal and\n       public service corporations to acquire lands belonging to or under control of\n       the state, or rights-of-way or other rights thereover, by condemnation\n       proceedings.\n\nRCW 79.36.580.\n\n       The State contends the trust lands at issue are dedicated to a public use because\n\nthey are actively managed by DNR. But all school trust land is managed by DNR in some\n\ncapacity as required under state law. See, e.g., RCW 79.10.090 (requiring periodic\n\nanalysis of all trust lands).\n\n       E. Compatibility. The State maintains that the courts look only at dedication to a\n\npublic use when determining whether condemnation is allowed.\n\n       The State misinterprets several precedents in making this assertion. For example,\n\nin City o/Tacoma the condemnation at issue involved the right to divert water from a fish\n\nhatchery and the right to condemn a 250-foot strip of the school lands. City o/Tacoma,\n\n121 Wash. at 450. In analyzing whether Tacoma could condemn the right to divert waters\n\nflowing past the fish hatchery, the court explained:\n\n       This property is now devoted to a public use, and if the proposed diversion\n       ofthe waters of the North fork would destroy this public use, or so damage\n       it as to preclude its successful operation, our inquiry would end here.\n\nId. at 453.\n\n\n\n\n                                             18 \n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\n       The court ultimately found that the public use would not be destroyed and that\n\ndiversion would even benefit the hatchery. Id. Citing Roberts, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat condemnation was permissible, despite the fact that the property was already devoted\n\nto a public use. Id. The court also held that Roberts authorized the condemnation of the\n\n250-foot strip of school trust lands. Id.\n\n       PUD points out, and the State does not dispute, that the easements will not destroy\n\nthe current uses of the State's trust land. In fact, PUD takes the position that the proposed\n\neasements will benefit the economic purpose behind the trust lands by providing revenue\n\nthrough compensation for the easements while still allowing the continuation of grazing.\n\n       Significantly, the State does not challenge its own leases, which contain specific\n\nprovisions that address the condemnation of all or part of the leased land \"by any public\n\nauthority.\" CP at 240 (section 10.06). These provisions not only recognize that\n\ncondemnation can occur, they allow for continuation of the leases after condemnation if\n\nthe parties desire.\n\n       When managing the grant lands, DNR may consider only those factors consistent\n\nwith ensuring the economic value and productivity of the federal grant land trusts. See,\n\ne.g., 1996 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 11 (Question 5(c». The condemnation of the easements\n\nwill not negatively impact the economic productivity of the trusts.\n\n\n                                             19\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-111\nPUDv.

Given our disposition in\n\nfavor of the PUD, we need not address its cross appeal related to the trial court's\n\ngrant of limited intervention to CNW.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR: \n\n\n\n\n\n~I \n\n\n\n\n\n                                             20 \n\n\f",

Following a decade of\n\nenvironmental review and litigation, PUD obtained an environmental impact statement\n\n(BIS). Next, PUD needed to obtain easements over the proposed land. PUD negotiated\n\nwith approximately 85 percent of the property owners for easements on their land.\n\nUltimately, PUD filed a petition for condemnation against the remaining property owners.\n\nThis included the State, l which owned school trust lands that were required for the\n\nproject.\n\n       Conservation Northwest (CNW), a group engaged in conservation activities, filed\n\na motion to intervene.

PUD then cross appealed, challenging the trial court's\n\norder granting intervention to CNW. The State also appealed the summary judgment\n\norder, contending that PUD had no statutory authority to condemn the State trust lands at\n\nissue here.\n\n       We conclude that the State trust lands may be condemned as a matter oflaw. We\n\naffirm summary judgment in favor of PUD and the denial of summary judgment to the\n\nState and CNW. Given that we affirm the trial court's order on the PUD's condemnation\n\nauthority, we need not address the PUD's cross appeal challenging CNW's limited\n\nintervention.\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n       Introduction. In 1889, Washington became a state. At that time, the federal\n\ngovernment granted to Washington approximately three million acres of land for\n\n\nState of Washington.\n\n                                            3\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\neducational purposes and the support of common schools. Enabling Act, ch. 180,\n\n§§ 10, 11,25 STAT. 676 (1889). The lands consisted of sections 16 and 36 of each\n\ntownship in Washington. Id. Section 11 of the Enabling Act reserved these lands for\n\n\"school purposes only\" and set forth certain restrictions on their sale and lease to ensure\n\nthat the lands would derive to the sole benefit of Washington schools. Id. This concern is\n\nechoed in the Washington Constitution. The Constitution provides that all \"public lands\n\ngranted to the state are held in trust for all the people\" and restricts the manner in which\n\nsuch trust lands may be disposed. CONST. art. XVI, § 1.\n\n        The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is the state agency charged by the\n\nlegislature with the management of these lands. In 1957, the management responsibilities\n\nwere consolidated in DNR, which was created to provide effective and efficient\n\nmanagement of these state lands. RCW 43.30.010, .030. Peter Goldmark, the elected\n\nCommissioner of Public Lands (Commissioner), serves as the administrator ofDNR.

PUD filed its amended\n\npetition for condemnation on April 14, 2010.\n\n       At summary judgment on the condemnation petition, CNW argued that the\n\nproposed Pateros-Twisp transmission line would bisect the largest contiguous publicly\n\nowned shrub-steppe habitat in the Methow Valley and would have multiple adverse\n\nenvironmental impacts, including the introduction of noxious weeds, fragmentation of\n\nwildlife habitat, increased fire risk, and exacerbating erosion and sedimentation.\n\n       The State argued that it leased these lands for cattle grazing to generate money for\n\ntrust beneficiaries and to preserve this land as a part of the trust corpus for the benefit of\n\n\n                                               6\n\n\fNo. 29121-9-111; No. 29123-5-111\nPUDv. State\n\n\nfuture generations. To this end, the State had entered into enforceable leases for the use\n\nof these parcels and had issued pennits to allow for cattle grazing on certain parcels. In\n\ntotal, the proposed Pateros-Twisp transmission line would cross state trust lands that are\n\nsubject to five active grazing leases and two grazing pennit range areas. These leases and\n\npennits actively generate income to benefit Washington schools.\n\n       However, the leases on the property generate less than $3,000 annually for the\n\nschool beneficiaries, not including DNR administrative costs. PUD's proposed easements\n\npass over no more than an estimated 4 percent of the area of anyone lease and as little as\n\n0.02 percent for one of the leased areas. PUD modified the project to eliminate all\n\npennanent road construction within the project.\n\n       Intervention. Prior to the hearing on public use and necessity, CNW filed a motion\n\nto intervene as a respondent in support of the State. It is undisputed that CNW has no\n\nlegal or equitable property interest in the trust lands. CNW states: \"The issue at stake in\n\nthis litigation ... directly affects Conservation Northwest's ability to continue its work as\n\na representative and protector of state trust land and its ability to protect its own interests\n\nas an organization involved in land conservation.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 603. Despite\n\nopposition by PUD, the superior court granted limited intervention under CR 24.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\n\fNo. 29121-9-111; No. 29123-5-111\nPUDv. State\n\n\n       Motions for Summary Judgment. Following intervention, both CNW and the State\n\nfiled separate motions for summary judgment, arguing that the PUD does not have the\n\nauthority to condemn school trust lands. PUD also filed a motion for summary judgment.\n\n       The court rejected this statutory argument and concluded that PUD has the express\n\nauthority to condemn school trust lands under RCW 54.16.020 and .050. The court also\n\nrejected the contention that school trust lands cannot be subject to condemnation because\n\nthey are dedicated to a public use.\n\n       The trial court entered orders denying summary judgment to CNW and the State,\n\nand granting summary judgment to PUD on the issue of condemnation authority.\n\nBecause the State did not otherwise oppose an order on public use and necessity, the court\n\nalso entered its \"Findings of Fact, Conclusions ofLaw, and Order on Public Use and\n\nNecessity.\" CP at 14-18.\n\n       Appeals. CNW filed a notice of appeal challenging the summary judgment in\n\nPUD's favor, as well as the order on public use and necessity. PUD then cross appealed\n\nthe order granting intervention to CNW. The Attorney General declined to appeal the\n\ntrial court's decision despite the Commissioner's request that it do so. Subsequently, the\n\nState filed a contingent notice of appeal of the order denying summary judgment and the\n\norder on public use and necessity. Later, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that the\n\n\n                                             8\n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUD v.

The State concedes that PUD has the statutory authority to\n\ncondemn, but the State argues that the school trust lands in question are not subject to\n\ncondemnation because they are already devoted to a particular use by law. CNW argues\n\nthat chapter 54.16 RCW does not grant PUD express authority to condemn. CNW\n\nabandoned this argument on appeal. CNW adopts the State's arguments. CNWargues\n\nthat state school lands are dedicated to a public use as a matter of law.\n\n       This court reviews the trial court's summary judgment orders de novo. Moeller v.\n\nFarmers Ins. Co., 173 Wn.2d 264,271,267 P.3d 998 (2011). We engage in the same\n\ninquiry as the trial court. Hisle v. Todd Pac. Shipyards Corp., 151 Wn.2d 853,860,93\n\nP.3d 108 (2004).\n\n       The property in dispute is designated school trust land. Significantly, chapter 1,\n\nsection 6(e) of the LAWS OF 1931, codified at RCW 54.16.050, specifically authorizes\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\npublic utility districts to condemn school lands for transmission lines. RCW 54.16.050\n\nreads, in part, that a public utility district\n\n       may take, condemn and purchase, purchase and acquire any public and\n       private property, franchises and property rights, including state,\n       county, and school lands, and property and littoral and water rights,for\n       ... transmission lines, and all other facilities necessary or convenient.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       The PUD statute itself does not contain any limitation on the type of state land that\n\nmay be condemned. RCW 54.16.050. However, the definition of \"state lands\" in the\n\npublic lands act, Title 79 RCW, excludes lands \"devoted to or reserved for a particular\n\nuse by law.\" RCW 79.02.01O(14)(h).3 The critical issue here is whether these school\n\nlands are dedicated to a particular purpose or use and, therefore, are not subject to\n\ncondemnation.\n\n       A. Dedicated to a Public Purpose. On appeal, the State argues that all school\n\ntrust lands are dedicated to a public purpose and are, therefore, per se exempt from\n\ncondemnation.\n\n       The State's argument is not persuasive for several reasons. First, the public lands\n\nact defines \"state lands\" as including school trust lands \"that are not devoted to or\n\n\n\n       We refer to the current version ofRCW 79.02.010; subsequent amendments\n       3\nrenumbered the sections and were not substantive.\n\n                                                 10 \n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\nreserved for a particular use by law.\" RCW 79.02.010(14)(h). This means that not all\n\nschool lands are so reserved or there would be no need for the qualifier. Second, the\n\nState's interpretation would render meaningless the many statutes that specifically allow\n\nlocal government to condemn state and school trust lands. See, e.g., RCW 8.12.030\n\n(cities and towns); RCW 53.34.170 (port districts), and RCW 54.16.050 (public utility\n\ndistricts).\n\n        Finally, the State's argument ignores Washington Supreme Court precedent.

There is nothing in the record to indicate that the 30-foot strip ofland\n        in question is actually in use by the university, and there is nothing to\n        indicate that the taking of the strip of land will impair the use of the land\n        remaining.

The State and CNW assert that the PUD does not have authority to\n\ncondemn trust land generally or the trust land here. But following this logic, RCW\n\n54.16.050 would have meaningless terms that would create an absurd result.\n\n       D. Easements. Regardless of whether a sale is at issue, by the State's own\n\nadmission, easements can be granted over trust lands for grazing. Here, PUD does not\n\nseek fee ownership of school trust lands. In addition to PUD's express condemnation\n\nauthority under RCW 54.16.050, the legislature also reserved PUD's right to condemn\n\neasements over state lands in DNR's land management statutes:\n\n       The foregoing sections relating to the acquiring of rights-of-way and\n       overflow rights through, over and across lands belonging to the state, shall\n\n                                              17 \n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\n       not be construed as exclusive or as affecting the right of municipal and\n       public service corporations to acquire lands belonging to or under control of\n       the state, or rights-of-way or other rights thereover, by condemnation\n       proceedings.\n\nRCW 79.36.580.\n\n       The State contends the trust lands at issue are dedicated to a public use because\n\nthey are actively managed by DNR. But all school trust land is managed by DNR in some\n\ncapacity as required under state law. See, e.g., RCW 79.10.090 (requiring periodic\n\nanalysis of all trust lands).\n\n       E. Compatibility. The State maintains that the courts look only at dedication to a\n\npublic use when determining whether condemnation is allowed.\n\n       The State misinterprets several precedents in making this assertion. For example,\n\nin City o/Tacoma the condemnation at issue involved the right to divert water from a fish\n\nhatchery and the right to condemn a 250-foot strip of the school lands. City o/Tacoma,\n\n121 Wash. at 450. In analyzing whether Tacoma could condemn the right to divert waters\n\nflowing past the fish hatchery, the court explained:\n\n       This property is now devoted to a public use, and if the proposed diversion\n       ofthe waters of the North fork would destroy this public use, or so damage\n       it as to preclude its successful operation, our inquiry would end here.\n\nId. at 453.\n\n\n\n\n                                             18 \n\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-III\nPUDv. State\n\n\n       The court ultimately found that the public use would not be destroyed and that\n\ndiversion would even benefit the hatchery. Id. Citing Roberts, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat condemnation was permissible, despite the fact that the property was already devoted\n\nto a public use. Id. The court also held that Roberts authorized the condemnation of the\n\n250-foot strip of school trust lands. Id.\n\n       PUD points out, and the State does not dispute, that the easements will not destroy\n\nthe current uses of the State's trust land. In fact, PUD takes the position that the proposed\n\neasements will benefit the economic purpose behind the trust lands by providing revenue\n\nthrough compensation for the easements while still allowing the continuation of grazing.\n\n       Significantly, the State does not challenge its own leases, which contain specific\n\nprovisions that address the condemnation of all or part of the leased land \"by any public\n\nauthority.\" CP at 240 (section 10.06). These provisions not only recognize that\n\ncondemnation can occur, they allow for continuation of the leases after condemnation if\n\nthe parties desire.\n\n       When managing the grant lands, DNR may consider only those factors consistent\n\nwith ensuring the economic value and productivity of the federal grant land trusts. See,\n\ne.g., 1996 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 11 (Question 5(c». The condemnation of the easements\n\nwill not negatively impact the economic productivity of the trusts.\n\n\n                                             19\n\fNo. 29121-9-III; No. 29123-5-111\nPUDv. State\n\n\n       F. Conclusion. We affinn the denial of summary judgment to the State and\n\nCNW and affinn the order on public use and necessity. Given our disposition in\n\nfavor of the PUD, we need not address its cross appeal related to the trial court's\n\ngrant of limited intervention to CNW.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR: \n\n\n\n\n\n~I \n\n\n\n\n\n                                             20 \n\n\f</pre>",
