Rodovich, Magistrate Judge.\n\n\nArgued February 20, 2001--Decided April 5, 2001\n\n\n\n  Before EASTERBROOK, EVANS, and WILLIAMS, Circuit\nJudges.\n\n  EVANS, Circuit Judge. A plaintiff seeking\ndamages and injunctive relief under the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act by virtue of a mental\nillness faces a treacherous road to recovery. If\nhe submits insufficient proof of the symptoms of\nhis illness, a trier of fact might well conclude\nthat he is not \"disabled,\" and is, therefore,\noutside the protective scope of the Act. On the\nother hand, if his mental illness manifests\nitself in the form of delusions or\nhallucinations, it is difficult to argue that an\nemployer should have accommodated the disability\nby addressing working conditions that are the\nproduct of the employee’s imagination. Kenneth\nTyler, the plaintiff in this case, was tripped up\nby this second hurdle at the summary judgment\nstage. We review de novo the district court’s\ndecision dismissing the case. Moore v. J.B. Hunt\nTransp., Inc., 221 F.3d 944, 950 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n  Tyler has worked for Ispat Inland Inc. since\n1979, most recently as an electrician. In the\nearly 1990’s, while working at Ispat’s Plant 2\nBlast Furnaces Department, Tyler began to feel\nthreatened by his coworkers. Specifically, he\nalleged that they sabotaged his work, falsely\naccused him of stealing a computer, and\nthreatened to burn his house down and poison him\nby putting asbestos in his food. Only the\n\fallegations concerning the computer theft were\never substantiated: A coworker at Ispat did\naccuse Tyler of stealing the computer, but an\ninvestigation revealed that it had not been\nstolen, and no action was taken against Tyler or\nanyone else.\n\n  In December 1994 Tyler’s doctor concluded that\nhe was \"unable psychologically to handle stress.\"\nThe doctor restricted Tyler to the day shift and\nreferred him to a psychiatrist. Ispat complied\nwith the doctor’s restrictions by limiting\nTyler’s work schedule to the day shift. The\npsychiatrist to whom Tyler was referred, Dr.\nSuhayl Nasr, concluded that Tyler suffered from\n\"Atypical Depression R/O Delusional Disorder\nPersecutory.\" Dr. Nasr prescribed antidepressant\nmedication for Tyler, and he was taken off work\nindefinitely.\n\n  Tyler returned to work in November 1995 and was\nreassigned to Plant 7, where he would be\nseparated from the individuals who allegedly\nharassed and threatened him in Plant 2. Tyler\nreceived the same wages and benefits at Plant 7\nas he had at Plant 2. Sadly, Tyler soon came to\nbelieve that his coworkers at Plant 7 were\nharassing him as well. For example, when one of\nhis car tires fell off on his way home from work,\nTyler became convinced that his coworkers had\nloosened its lug nuts. This was only a \"belief\"\non Tyler’s part, as no evidence substantiating\nthe event was ever presented. Tyler also asked\nthat he be permitted to park his car in a parking\nlot reserved for office personnel, but Ispat\ndenied his request.\n\n  Unable to resolve his fears, Tyler eventually\ndecided he wanted to be transferred back to Plant\n2. At Tyler’s request, Dr. Nasr sent a letter to\nIspat stating that Tyler \"has been feeling\nstressed by his current location at work\" and\nrecommending that he be returned to Plant 2.\nIspat did not transfer him back. On August 27,\n1997, Dr. Nasr suggested that Tyler take 2 months\noff work and offered him an antipsychotic\nmedication. Tyler refused to take the medication\nbecause it was \"for people who are seeing\nthings,\" and Tyler believed his fear of his\ncoworkers was justified.\n\n  Dr. Nasr released Tyler to return to work in\nlate December 1997. Prior to reporting for work\nin January 1998, Tyler complained that the\ncompany had done nothing to prevent his former\ncoworkers at Plant 2 from applying for transfers\nto Plant 7 so they could continue to harass him.\nFrank Wright, Tyler’s brother-in-law and the\nPlant 7 furnace maintenance planner, assured\nTyler that if anyone from Plant 2 requested a\n\ftransfer (and nothing indicates that anyone did),\nIspat would deal with the issue at that time. In\naddition, Tyler spoke with Ron Allen of the\ncompany’s Personnel Services Department and\ninformed him that the only thing that would make\nhim feel safe at work would be to confront the\nPlant 2 employees who had accused him of computer\ntheft in 1991, and for the company to make a full\ninvestigation of that incident. In an effort to\nevaluate the propriety of these requested\n\"accommodations\" and develop further appropriate\naccommodations, Ispat asked to examine Tyler’s\nmedical records, but he refused to release them.\nDr. Nasr subsequently diagnosed Tyler with a\n\"paranoid disorder,\" a diagnosis Tyler disputes.\n\n  Ispat ultimately refused to transfer Tyler back\nto Plant 2. He then brought this suit under the\nADA, 42 U.S.C. sec. 12101 et seq., alleging that\nthe company failed reasonably to accommodate his\ndisability of mental illness. The district court\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Ispat,\nfinding that Tyler suffered no adverse employment\naction and that the company had reasonably\naccommodated him.\n\n  The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating\nagainst \"a qualified individual with a disability\nbecause of the disability of such individual in\nregard to . . . [the] terms, conditions, and\nprivileges of employment.\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12112(a). Where there is no direct evidence of\ndisability discrimination, a plaintiff may prove\nhis case indirectly by employing the burden-\nshifting approach set out in McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 804 (1973). Under\nthe McDonnell Douglas method of proof, the\nplaintiff bears the initial burden of\nestablishing a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination. Bekker v. Humana Health Plan,\nInc., 229 F.3d 662, 672 (7th Cir. 2000), petition\nfor cert. filed, ___ U.S.L.W. ___ (U.S. Feb. 12,\n2001) (No. 00-1294). The burden of production\nthen shifts to the employer to articulate a\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the\nemployment action. Id. Finally, the burden shifts\nback to the plaintiff to prove that the\nemployer’s articulated reason for the employment\naction was a pretext for discrimination and that\nthe decision was in fact motivated by an unlawful\nfactor. Id. Although the burden of production\nrests on the employer for the second stage of the\nMcDonnell Douglas inquiry, \"[t]he ultimate burden\nof persuading the trier of fact that the\ndefendant intentionally discriminated against the\nplaintiff remains at all times with the\nplaintiff.\" Texas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v.\nBurdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981).\n\n Because Tyler lacks direct evidence of\n\fdiscrimination, our analysis starts with the\nelements of a prima facie case. In order to\nestablish a prima facie case of disability\ndiscrimination under the ADA, Tyler must show (1)\nthat he is a \"qualified individual with a\ndisability,\" (2) that his work performance met\nIspat’s legitimate expectations, (3) that he\nsuffered an adverse employment action, and (4)\nthat his disability was the motivation for the\nadverse employment action. See Leffel v. Valley\nFin. Servs., 113 F.3d 787, 794 (7th Cir. 1997).\nIspat does not dispute that Tyler’s mental\nillness constitutes a disability under the ADA\nand that his work performance was satisfactory,\nso we will assume he is a \"qualified individual\nwith a disability\" under the Act. Ispat argues,\nhowever, that it took no adverse employment\naction against Tyler and that it reasonably\naccommodated his disability.\n\n  We agree that Tyler suffered no adverse\nemployment action. Although an adverse employment\naction \"is defined quite broadly in this\ncircuit,\" not everything that makes an employee\nunhappy can form the basis of a federal\ndiscrimination suit. Smart v. Ball State Univ.,\n89 F.3d 437, 441 (7th Cir. 1996). Rather, the\naction must cause an adverse change in the terms\nand conditions of employment that is more\ndisruptive than a mere inconvenience or\nalteration of job responsibilities. Crady v.\nLiberty Nat’l Bank & Trust Co. of Ind., 993 F.2d\n132, 136 (7th Cir. 1993). Thus, we have held that\na lateral transfer of an employee who retains the\nsame salary and benefits is not, without more,\nsufficient to constitute an adverse employment\naction. Williams v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 85\nF.3d 270, 274 (7th Cir. 1996); Flaherty v. Gas\nResearch Inst., 31 F.3d 451, 457 (7th Cir. 1994);\nCrady, 993 F.2d at 136. Moreover, even the denial\nof a monetary perk, such as a bonus or\nreimbursement of certain expenses, does not\nconstitute an adverse employment action if it is\nwholly within the employer’s discretion to grant\nor deny and is not a component of the employee’s\nsalary. See Rabinovitz v. Pena, 89 F.3d 482, 488-\n89 (7th Cir. 1996) (bonus); Fyfe v. City of Fort\nWayne, Ind., No. 00-1396, slip op. at 9 (7th Cir.\nFeb. 22, 2001) (reimbursement of expenses).\n\n  Under this framework, Tyler can point to no\nadverse employment action taken against him.\nBecause his salary and benefits remained the same\nafter his transfer to Plant 7, the transfer alone\nis insufficient. See Flaherty, 31 F.3d at 457.\nPlus, this transfer (apparently ironed out in an\nagreement with the company and Tyler’s union) was\nsatisfactory to Tyler at the time as it removed\nhim from the harassment he perceived from the\ncrew in Plant 2. Tyler attempts to add meat to\n\fthe bones of his argument by claiming that Plant\n2 employed certain equipment that was not\navailable in Plant 7, and that he could have\napplied for a promotion if he had gained\nexperience using that equipment. But this is pure\nspeculation. Tyler does not assert that he had\nany entitlement to use the equipment in question,\nand even if he did he would not necessarily have\nbeen entitled to a promotion. Any connection\nbetween Tyler’s transfer and his failure to\nachieve a promotion is tenuous at best, and the\ntransfer, we conclude, cannot be viewed as an\nadverse employment action. See Rabinovitz, 89\nF.3d at 488-89.\n\n  Tyler also contends that Ispat failed reasonably\nto accommodate his disability. The ADA requires\nemployers to provide reasonable accommodations\nfor qualified employees--such as job\nrestructuring, modification of equipment, or\nreassignment to a vacant position--to enable\nemployees to perform the essential functions of\ntheir jobs. See 42 U.S.C. sec. 12111(9); Vande\nZande v. State of Wis. Dep’t of Admin., 44 F.3d\n538, 542 (7th Cir. 1995). Although the complaint\ndoes not explicitly spell out what accommodations\nTyler requested at various times, he makes three\nprincipal arguments: (1) his transfer to Plant 7\nwas not a reasonable accommodation, (2) the\nappropriate reasonable accommodation at the time\nof his transfer would have been to investigate\nfully his concerns and assure his safety, and (3)\nafter 2 years at Plant 7 the appropriate\nreasonable accommodation would have been to\ntransfer him back to Plant 2. We must reject each\nof these arguments.\n\n  As an initial matter, the accommodation Ispat\nsupplied--transfer from Plant 2 to Plant 7--was,\nas we have noted, entirely reasonable. Tyler’s\nmedically diagnosed paranoia and delusions of\npersecution, of which Ispat was aware, caused him\nto fear his coworkers in Plant 2. We can think of\nno better way to allay his fears, short of\npsychological treatment for his underlying\ncondition, than to physically separate him from\nthe individuals he thinks were harassing him.\nAlthough Tyler contends that the company did\nnothing to prevent Plant 2 coworkers from\ntransferring to Plant 7, there is no evidence\nthat anyone sought such a transfer. Moreover,\neven if Tyler’s fears had some basis in fact,\nseparation from the problem individuals would\nstill be an appropriate, reasonable\naccommodation.\n\n  Tyler also contends that the transfer was not a\nreasonable accommodation because it unlawfully\n\"segregated\" him. In Duda v. Board of Education\nof Franklin Park Public School District No. 84,\n\f133 F.3d 1054, 1059-60 (7th Cir. 1998), we held\nthat a school janitor stated an ADA claim when\nthe school district transferred him to a location\nin which he was forced to work alone and\ninstructed him not to speak to anyone after it\nlearned of his mental illness. Because\nsegregating an employee is a form of\ndiscrimination under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12112(b)(1), we held that the transfer raised a\ntriable issue of fact on the reasonable\naccommodation issue. Id. Our case is easily\ndistinguished, however, because there is no\nevidence that Tyler was segregated. Indeed, Tyler\ndoes not dispute Ispat’s assertion that he was\nfully integrated into the Plant 7 work force\nafter his transfer.\n\n  Tyler next argues that the only reasonable\naccommodation at the time of his transfer would\nhave been to investigate his concerns at Plant 2\nand ensure his safety. Similarly, Tyler contends\nthat the company should have permitted him to\npark in a special parking place because he feared\nthat Plant 7 workers would tamper with his car.\nBut Ispat knew that Tyler experienced delusions\nof persecution, so reason did not require the\ncompany to expend resources to investigate his\naccusations or to take unnecessary safety\nprecautions on his behalf. Quite simply, it was\nnot unreasonable for Ispat to think Tyler’s fears\nwere the product of his illness, and no\ninvestigation of the basis of those fears would\nhave allayed them. The company did its best to\naccommodate Tyler by transferring him away from\nthe individuals he feared and assuring him that\nany request by his former coworkers to transfer\nto Plant 7 would be dealt with in an appropriate\nmanner.\n\n  Finally, Tyler argues that Ispat should have\ntransferred him back to Plant 2 and that its\nfailure to do so constitutes the denial of a\nreasonable accommodation. But Plant 2 is where\nTyler’s safety concerns originated, and he was\ntransferred out to accommodate his disability.\nAlthough Dr. Nasr requested that Tyler be\ntransferred back, he never said Tyler could not\nhandle the stress at Plant 7, nor did he explain\nwhy another transfer would alleviate the safety\nconcerns or why Tyler needed to confront his\nformer coworkers concerning the 1991 computer\ntheft accusations. When the company sought access\nto Tyler’s medical records to help answer these\nquestions (or determine an alternative\nappropriate accommodation), Tyler refused to\nrelease them./1 Without this cooperation from\nTyler, Ispat cannot be held liable for failure to\ndesign a perfect accommodation. See Beck v.\nUniversity of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130,\n1136-37 (7th Cir. 1996) (affirming summary\n\fjudgment for employer because employee caused\nbreakdown of interactive process of designing\nreasonable accommodation by refusing to release\nmedical records). And without a medical\nexplanation for Tyler’s request to transfer back\nto Plant 2, old-fashioned common sense dictated\nthat he be kept away from the original source of\nhis stress.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n/1 Tyler argues that Ispat’s request for his medical\nrecords was somehow improper. We recognized in\nDuda, however, that such a request is permissible\nif related to the employee’s job and necessary to\nthe business. 133 F.3d at 1060. Here, Tyler was\nrequesting a return to the place his problems\nbegan. Because such a transfer is not a costless\ntransaction for the company, Ispat had every\nright to seek information concerning Tyler’s\npsychological ability to handle the working\nconditions in Plant 2.\n\f",

Ball State Univ.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721536\"><a href=\"/opinion/721536/vivian-j-smart-v-ball-state-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441 (7th Cir. 1996). Rather, the\naction must cause an adverse change in the terms\nand conditions of employment that is more\ndisruptive than a mere inconvenience or\nalteration of job responsibilities.

Thus, we have held that\na lateral transfer of an employee who retains the\nsame salary and benefits is not, without more,\nsufficient to constitute an adverse employment\naction. Williams v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718776\"><a href=\"/opinion/718776/michael-n-williams-v-bristol-myers-squibb-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 274 (7th Cir. 1996); Flaherty v.

Moreover, even the denial\nof a monetary perk, such as a bonus or\nreimbursement of certain expenses, does not\nconstitute an adverse employment action if it is\nwholly within the employer’s discretion to grant\nor deny and is not a component of the employee’s\nsalary. See Rabinovitz v. Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721544\"><a href=\"/opinion/721544/martin-rabinovitz-v-honorable-federico-pena-secretary-of-transportation/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488-\n89 (7th Cir. 1996) (bonus); Fyfe v. City of Fort\nWayne, Ind., No. 00-1396, slip op. at 9 (7th Cir.\nFeb. 22, 2001) (reimbursement of expenses).\n\n  Under this framework, Tyler can point to no\nadverse employment action taken against him.\nBecause his salary and benefits remained the same\nafter his transfer to Plant 7, the transfer alone\nis insufficient. See Flaherty, 31 F.3d at 457.\nPlus, this transfer (apparently ironed out in an\nagreement with the company and Tyler’s union) was\nsatisfactory to Tyler at the time as it removed\nhim from the harassment he perceived from the\ncrew in Plant 2. Tyler attempts to add meat to\n\fthe bones of his argument by claiming that Plant\n2 employed certain equipment that was not\navailable in Plant 7, and that he could have\napplied for a promotion if he had gained\nexperience using that equipment. But this is pure\nspeculation. Tyler does not assert that he had\nany entitlement to use the equipment in question,\nand even if he did he would not necessarily have\nbeen entitled to a promotion. Any connection\nbetween Tyler’s transfer and his failure to\nachieve a promotion is tenuous at best, and the\ntransfer, we conclude, cannot be viewed as an\nadverse employment action. See Rabinovitz, 89\nF.3d at 488-89.\n\n  Tyler also contends that Ispat failed reasonably\nto accommodate his disability. The ADA requires\nemployers to provide reasonable accommodations\nfor qualified employees--such as job\nrestructuring, modification of equipment, or\nreassignment to a vacant position--to enable\nemployees to perform the essential functions of\ntheir jobs. See 42 U.S.C. sec. 12111(9); Vande\nZande v. State of Wis. Dep’t of Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686498\"><a href=\"/opinion/686498/lori-l-vande-zande-v-state-of-wisconsin-department-of-administration/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 542 (7th Cir. 1995). Although the complaint\ndoes not explicitly spell out what accommodations\nTyler requested at various times, he makes three\nprincipal arguments: (1) his transfer to Plant 7\nwas not a reasonable accommodation, (2) the\nappropriate reasonable accommodation at the time\nof his transfer would have been to investigate\nfully his concerns and assure his safety, and (3)\nafter 2 years at Plant 7 the appropriate\nreasonable accommodation would have been to\ntransfer him back to Plant 2. We must reject each\nof these arguments.\n\n  As an initial matter, the accommodation Ispat\nsupplied--transfer from Plant 2 to Plant 7--was,\nas we have noted, entirely reasonable. Tyler’s\nmedically diagnosed paranoia and delusions of\npersecution, of which Ispat was aware, caused him\nto fear his coworkers in Plant 2. We can think of\nno better way to allay his fears, short of\npsychological treatment for his underlying\ncondition, than to physically separate him from\nthe individuals he thinks were harassing him.\nAlthough Tyler contends that the company did\nnothing to prevent Plant 2 coworkers from\ntransferring to Plant 7, there is no evidence\nthat anyone sought such a transfer. Moreover,\neven if Tyler’s fears had some basis in fact,\nseparation from the problem individuals would\nstill be an appropriate, reasonable\naccommodation.\n\n  Tyler also contends that the transfer was not a\nreasonable accommodation because it unlawfully\n\"segregated\" him. In Duda v. Board of Education\nof Franklin Park Public School District No. 84,\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750633\"><a href=\"/opinion/750633/john-duda-v-board-of-education-of-franklin-park-public-school-district-no/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1059-60 (7th Cir. 1998), we held\nthat a school janitor stated an ADA claim when\nthe school district transferred him to a location\nin which he was forced to work alone and\ninstructed him not to speak to anyone after it\nlearned of his mental illness. Because\nsegregating an employee is a form of\ndiscrimination under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12112(b)(1), we held that the transfer raised a\ntriable issue of fact on the reasonable\naccommodation issue. Id. Our case is easily\ndistinguished, however, because there is no\nevidence that Tyler was segregated. Indeed, Tyler\ndoes not dispute Ispat’s assertion that he was\nfully integrated into the Plant 7 work force\nafter his transfer.\n\n  Tyler next argues that the only reasonable\naccommodation at the time of his transfer would\nhave been to investigate his concerns at Plant 2\nand ensure his safety. Similarly, Tyler contends\nthat the company should have permitted him to\npark in a special parking place because he feared\nthat Plant 7 workers would tamper with his car.\nBut Ispat knew that Tyler experienced delusions\nof persecution, so reason did not require the\ncompany to expend resources to investigate his\naccusations or to take unnecessary safety\nprecautions on his behalf. Quite simply, it was\nnot unreasonable for Ispat to think Tyler’s fears\nwere the product of his illness, and no\ninvestigation of the basis of those fears would\nhave allayed them. The company did its best to\naccommodate Tyler by transferring him away from\nthe individuals he feared and assuring him that\nany request by his former coworkers to transfer\nto Plant 7 would be dealt with in an appropriate\nmanner.\n\n  Finally, Tyler argues that Ispat should have\ntransferred him back to Plant 2 and that its\nfailure to do so constitutes the denial of a\nreasonable accommodation. But Plant 2 is where\nTyler’s safety concerns originated, and he was\ntransferred out to accommodate his disability.\nAlthough Dr. Nasr requested that Tyler be\ntransferred back, he never said Tyler could not\nhandle the stress at Plant 7, nor did he explain\nwhy another transfer would alleviate the safety\nconcerns or why Tyler needed to confront his\nformer coworkers concerning the 1991 computer\ntheft accusations. When the company sought access\nto Tyler’s medical records to help answer these\nquestions (or determine an alternative\nappropriate accommodation), Tyler refused to\nrelease them./1 Without this cooperation from\nTyler, Ispat cannot be held liable for failure to\ndesign a perfect accommodation. See Beck v.\nUniversity of Wis. Bd. of Regents, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712199\"><a href=\"/opinion/712199/lorraine-beck-v-university-of-wisconsin-board-of-regents-university-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1136-37 (7th Cir. 1996) (affirming summary\n\fjudgment for employer because employee caused\nbreakdown of interactive process of designing\nreasonable accommodation by refusing to release\nmedical records). And without a medical\nexplanation for Tyler’s request to transfer back\nto Plant 2, old-fashioned common sense dictated\nthat he be kept away from the original source of\nhis stress.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n/1 Tyler argues that Ispat’s request for his medical\nrecords was somehow improper. We recognized in\nDuda, however, that such a request is permissible\nif related to the employee’s job and necessary to\nthe business. 133 F.3d at 1060. Here, Tyler was\nrequesting a return to the place his problems\nbegan. Because such a transfer is not a costless\ntransaction for the company, Ispat had every\nright to seek information concerning Tyler’s\npsychological ability to handle the working\nconditions in Plant 2.\n\f</pre>",
