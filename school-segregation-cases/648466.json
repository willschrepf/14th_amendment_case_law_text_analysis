The lower\n\n courts held that RLUIPA does entitle plaintiff to the rezoning of its property. We\n\n conclude that a refusal to rezone does not constitute an “individualized\n\n assessment,” and, thus, that RLUIPA is inapplicable. Further, even if RLUIPA is\n\fapplicable, the building of an apartment complex does not constitute a “religious\n\nexercise,” and even if it does constitute a “religious exercise,” the city of\n\nJackson’s refusal to rezone plaintiff’s property did not substantially burden\n\nplaintiff’s religious exercise, and even if it did substantially burden plaintiff’s\n\nreligious exercise, the imposition of that burden is in furtherance of a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest and constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering that\n\ninterest. Therefore, even assuming that RLUIPA is applicable, it has not been\n\nviolated. For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\n\nremand this case to the trial court for the entry of a judgment in favor of\n\ndefendants.\n\n                   I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Plaintiff wants to build an apartment complex across the street from its\n\nchurch on property that it owns in the city of Jackson. The property consists of\n\neight lots totaling 1.13 acres. The property is zoned single-family residential (R-\n\n1). One of the lots contains a single-family residence, and the remaining lots are\n\nvacant. There are single-family residences on each side of the property. Plaintiff\n\npetitioned the city to change the zoning of the property to multiple-family\n\nresidential (R-3) so that it could construct an apartment complex.\n\n       The Region 2 Planning Commission recommended denying plaintiff’s\n\nrezoning petition. After a public hearing, the city planning commission also voted\n\nto recommend that the city council deny plaintiff’s rezoning petition. Pursuant to\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\n\fthese recommendations, and following another public hearing, the city council\n\nvoted to deny plaintiff’s rezoning petition.\n\n       Plaintiff then filed a complaint against defendants, containing two counts:\n\ncount one directly challenged the city’s zoning decision and count two alleged a\n\nviolation of RLUIPA. The trial court granted defendants’ motion for summary\n\ndisposition with regard to count one, which decision was not appealed. With\n\nregard to count two, the trial court denied defendants’ motion for summary\n\ndisposition and granted plaintiff’s motion for summary disposition in part.\n\nSpecifically, the trial court ruled that RLUIPA did apply because the city’s zoning\n\ndecision constituted an “individualized assessment,” and the refusal to rezone\n\nplaintiff’s property imposed a “substantial burden” on the exercise of religion.\n\nThe trial court then ordered a trial on the issue whether the city had a compelling\n\ninterest for its refusal to rezone. After a bench trial, the trial court ruled that\n\ndefendants had failed to demonstrate such an interest. Therefore, it determined\n\nthat defendants had violated RLUIPA and that plaintiff was entitled to the\n\nrequested rezoning of its property.      The trial court enjoined defendant from\n\ninterfering in any manner with plaintiff’s efforts to construct an apartment\n\ncomplex on its property. After the final order was issued, plaintiff filed a motion\n\nfor attorney fees and costs and the trial court awarded plaintiff over $30,000 in\n\nattorney fees and costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\n\f      The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court in all respects. 268 Mich App\n\n673; 708 NW2d 756 (2005). The Court of Appeals also held that the application\n\nof RLUIPA to compel the requested rezoning did not render the statute\n\nunconstitutional. We granted defendants’ application for leave to appeal. 474\n\nMich 1133 (2006).\n\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      A trial court’s ruling on a summary disposition motion is a question of law\n\nthat this Court reviews de novo. Haynes v Neshewat, 477 Mich 29, 34; 729 NW2d\n\n488 (2007). Questions of statutory interpretation are also questions of law that\n\nthat this Court reviews de novo. Id.\n\n                           III. ORIGINS OF RLUIPA\n\n      The First Amendment of the United States Constitution provides, in\n\npertinent part, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of\n\nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . .” US Const, Am I. The\n\nsecond clause of this amendment is commonly known as the Free Exercise Clause.\n\nThe protections provided by the First Amendment, including the Free Exercise\n\nClause, have been “incorporated” and extended to the states and to their political\n\nsubdivisions by the Fourteenth Amendment. Cantwell v Connecticut, 310 US 296,\n\n303; 60 S Ct 900; 84 L Ed 1213 (1940); Santa Fe Independent School Dist v Doe,\n\n530 US 290, 301; 120 S Ct 2266; 147 L Ed 2d 295 (2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\n\f       In Sherbert v Verner, 374 US 398; 83 S Ct 1790; 10 L Ed 2d 965 (1963),\n\nthe plaintiff, a member of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church was discharged by\n\nher employer because she would not work on Saturday, the Sabbath Day of her\n\nfaith. She was unable to obtain other employment because she would not work on\n\nSaturdays. The South Carolina Unemployment Compensation Act, SC Code, Tit\n\n68, § 68-1 et seq., provided that a claimant was ineligible for benefits if the\n\nclaimant had failed “without good cause” to accept available suitable work. The\n\nEmployment Security Commission determined that the plaintiff’s religious belief\n\nagainst working on Saturdays did not constitute “good cause.” The United States\n\nSupreme Court held that denying the plaintiff unemployment compensation\n\nbenefits solely because of her refusal to accept employment in which she would\n\nhave to work on Saturdays contrary to her religious belief imposed a substantial\n\nburden on her exercise of her religion that was not justified by a compelling state\n\ninterest, and, thus, violated the Free Exercise Clause.\n\n       In Employment Div, Dep’t of Human Resources of Oregon v Smith, 494 US\n\n872; 110 S Ct 1595; 108 L Ed 2d 876 (1990), the United States Supreme Court\n\nheld that Oregon’s prohibition of the use of peyote in religious ceremonies, and\n\nthe denial of unemployment benefits to persons discharged for such use, does not\n\nviolate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Court explained\n\nthat generally applicable, religion-neutral laws that have the effect of burdening a\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\n\fparticular religious practice need not be justified, under the Free Exercise Clause,\n\nby a compelling governmental interest.1\n\n       In response to Smith, Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration\n\nAct of 1993 (RFRA),2 prohibiting the government from substantially burdening a\n\nperson’s exercise of religion, even by means of a generally applicable, religion-\n\nneutral law, unless the government could demonstrate that the burden imposed\n\nfurthers a compelling governmental interest and that it constitutes the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering such interest.\n\n\n\n       1\n          Smith, supra at 884, held that Sherbert was distinguishable because\nSherbert involved an “individualized governmental assessment”; that is, the “good\ncause” standard at issue in Sherbert allowed the government to consider the\nplaintiff’s “particular circumstances.” See pp 15-17 infra. That is, Smith held that\nwhile the “compelling governmental interest” test may be applicable to laws\nallowing for an “individualized governmental assessment,” it is not applicable to\ngenerally applicable laws that do not allow for an “individualized governmental\nassessment.”\n       2\n           RFRA provides, in pertinent part:\n\n             (a) In general. Government shall not substantially burden a\n       person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of\n       general applicability, except as provided in subsection (b).\n\n              (b) Exception. Government may substantially burden a\n       person’s exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application\n       of the burden to the person--\n\n                (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest;\n       and\n\n             (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\n       governmental interest. [42 USC 2000bb-1.]\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\n\f      However, in City of Boerne v Flores, 521 US 507; 117 S Ct 2157; 138 L Ed\n\n2d 624 (1997), the United States Supreme Court held that Congress, in enacting\n\nRFRA, had exceeded its powers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enact\n\nlegislation enforcing the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment because\n\nRFRA proscribes state conduct that the First Amendment itself does not\n\nproscribe.3 The Court explained:\n\n             Congress’ power under § 5, however, extends only to\n      “enforcing” the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The\n      Court has described this power as “remedial . . . .” The design of the\n      Amendment and the text of § 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion\n      that Congress has the power to decree the substance of the\n      Fourteenth Amendment’s restrictions on the States. Legislation\n      which alters the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause cannot be said\n      to be enforcing the Clause.         Congress does not enforce a\n      constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been given\n      the power “to enforce,” not the power to determine what constitutes\n      a constitutional violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be\n      enforcing would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the\n      “provisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].”\n\n              While the line between measures that remedy or prevent\n      unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive\n      change in the governing law is not easy to discern, and Congress\n      must have wide latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction\n      exists and must be observed. There must be a congruence and\n      proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and\n      the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a connection,\n      legislation may become substantive in operation and effect. [Id. at\n      519-520.]\n\n      3\n         Section 5, the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nprovides:\n\n              The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate\n      legislation, the provisions of this article. [US Const, Am XIV, § 5.]\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\n\fThe Supreme Court then concluded that the substantial costs that RFRA exacted\n\nthrough its “compelling governmental interest” test “far exceed any pattern or\n\npractice of unconstitutional conduct under the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted\n\nin Smith.” Id. at 534. Thus, “the Court invalidated RFRA as applied to the states,\n\nfinding it an unconstitutional exercise of Congress’ Enforcement Clause powers\n\nbecause Congress had not shown a pattern of religious discrimination meriting\n\nsuch a far-reaching remedy . . . .” Galvan, Beyond worship: The Religious Land\n\nUse and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 and religious institutions’ auxiliary\n\nuses, 24 Yale L & Policy R 207, 218 (2006).4\n\n        In response to City of Boerne, Congress enacted RLUIPA. Unlike RFRA,\n\nRLUIPA does not attempt to bar all laws that substantially burden religious\n\nexercise. Instead, it focuses on land use regulations5 and provides, in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n\n\n\n        4\n         Although RFRA no longer applies to the states, it still applies to the\nfederal government. See Gonzales v O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao Do\nVegetal, 546 US 418; 126 S Ct 1211; 163 L Ed 2d 1017 (2006) (holding that,\nunder RFRA, the Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801 et seq., cannot prohibit\na religious sect from receiving communion by drinking hoasca, a tea that contains\na hallucinogen).\n        5\n         RLUIPA also focuses on regulations pertaining to institutionalized\npersons, but that portion of RLUIPA is not applicable here.\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\n\f                (a) Substantial burdens.\n\n               (1) General rule. No government[6] shall impose or implement\n       a land use regulation[7] in a manner that imposes a substantial burden\n       on the religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly\n       or institution, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of\n       the burden on that person, assembly, or institution--\n\n                (A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest;\n       and\n\n             (B) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\n       governmental interest.\n\n\n\n       6\n           “Government” is defined as:\n\n              (i) a State, county, municipality, or other governmental entity\n       created under the authority of a State;\n\n               (ii) any branch, department, agency, instrumentality, or\n       official of an entity listed in clause (i); and\n\n                (iii) any other person acting under color of State law; and\n\n             (B) for the purposes of sections 4(b) and 5 [42 USC 2000cc-\n       2(b) and 2000cc-3], includes the United States, a branch,\n       department, agency, instrumentality, or official of the United States,\n       and any other person acting under color of Federal law. [42 USC\n       2000cc-5(4).]\n       7\n           “Land use regulation” is defined as a\n\n       zoning or landmarking law, or the application of such a law, that\n       limits or restricts a claimant’s use or development of land (including\n       a structure affixed to land), if the claimant has an ownership,\n       leasehold, easement, servitude, or other property interest in the\n       regulated land or a contract or option to acquire such an interest. [42\n       USC 2000cc-5(5).]\n\nThat the city’s denial of plaintiff’s petition to rezone its property here constitutes a\n“land use regulation” is uncontested.\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\n\f             (2) Scope of application. This subsection applies in any case\n      in which--\n\n                                         * * *\n\n             (C) the substantial burden is imposed in the implementation\n      of a land use regulation or system of land use regulations, under\n      which a government makes, or has in place formal or informal\n      procedures or practices that permit the government to make,\n      individualized assessments of the proposed uses for the property\n      involved. [42 USC 2000cc(a).][8]\n\n      “Religious exercise” is defined as “any exercise of religion, whether or not\n\ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 USC 2000cc-\n\n5(7)(A). RLUIPA specifically provides that “[t]he use, building, or conversion of\n\n\n      8\n          RLUIPA further provides:\n              (b) Discrimination and exclusion.\n\n              (1) Equal terms. No government shall impose or implement a\n      land use regulation in a manner that treats a religious assembly or\n      institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or\n      institution.\n\n            (2) Nondiscrimination. No government shall impose or\n      implement a land use regulation that discriminates against any\n      assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious\n      denomination.\n\n            (3) Exclusions and limits. No government shall impose or\n      implement a land use regulation that--\n\n              (A) totally excludes religious assemblies from a jurisdiction;\n      or\n\n             (B) unreasonably limits religious assemblies, institutions, or\n      structures within a jurisdiction. [42 USC 2000cc(b).]\n\nPlaintiff does not argue that 42 USC 2000cc(b) was violated.\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\n\freal property for the purpose of religious exercise shall be considered to be\n\nreligious exercise of the person or entity that uses or intends to use the property for\n\nthat purpose.” 42 USC 2000cc-5(7)(B). A plaintiff asserting a RLUIPA violation\n\nhas the burden of presenting prima facie evidence to support the assertion. 42\n\nUSC 2000cc-2(b).9 That is, the plaintiff has the burden to prove that RLUIPA is\n\napplicable and that the government has implemented a land use regulation that\n\nimposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion. Id. Once the plaintiff has\n\nproven this, the burden shifts to the government to prove that the imposition of\n\nsuch burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and\n\nconstitutes the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. Id. As the United\n\nStates Supreme Court has explained, “RLUIPA is [a] congressional effort[] to\n\naccord religious exercise heightened protection from government-imposed\n\nburdens, consistent with this Court’s precedents.” Cutter v Wilkinson, 544 US\n\n709, 714; 125 S Ct 2113; 161 L Ed 2d 1020 (2005). Therefore, it is clearly\n\n\n\n\n       9\n           RLUIPA provides, in pertinent part:\n\n              If a plaintiff produces prima facie evidence to support a claim\n       alleging a violation of the Free Exercise Clause or a violation of\n       section 2 [42 USC 2000cc], the government shall bear the burden of\n       persuasion on any element of the claim, except that the plaintiff shall\n       bear the burden of persuasion on whether the law (including a\n       regulation) or government practice that is challenged by the claim\n       substantially burdens the plaintiff’s exercise of religion. [42 USC\n       2000cc-2(b).]\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\n\fappropriate to examine the United States Supreme Court’s precedents when\n\nanalyzing RLUIPA.\n\n                                  IV. ANALYSIS\n\n                       A. INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT\n\n       The threshold question is whether RLUIPA is applicable to this dispute.\n\nThe burden is on plaintiff to prove that RLUIPA is applicable. 42 USC 2000cc-\n\n2(b). RLUIPA “applies only if one of three jurisdictional tests is first met . . . .”\n\nMidrash Sephardi, Inc v Town of Surfside, 366 F3d 1214, 1225 (CA 11, 2004);\n\nsee also Prater v City of Burnside, 289 F3d 417, 433 (CA 6, 2002) (“the Church\n\nmay not rely upon RLUIPA unless it first demonstrates that the facts of the present\n\ncase trigger one of the bases for jurisdiction provided in that statute”); Shepherd\n\nMontessori Ctr Milan v Ann Arbor Charter Twp, 259 Mich App 315, 326-327;\n\n627 NW2d 271 (2003) (“[i]n order to establish a claim under RLUIPA, a party\n\nmust establish that at least one of these three jurisdictional elements exists”).\n\nRLUIPA states that it “applies in any case in which,”\n\n              (C) the substantial burden is imposed in the implementation\n       of a land use regulation or system of land use regulations, under\n       which a government makes, or has in place formal or informal\n       procedures or practices that permit the government to make,\n       individualized assessments of the proposed uses for the property\n       involved. [42 USC 2000cc(a)(2) (emphasis added).][10]\n\n\n\n\n       10\n            RLUIPA also “applies in any case in which,”\n                                                                      (continued…)\n\n                                         12\n\n\fTherefore, the issue is whether a substantial burden has been imposed in the\n\nimplementation of a land use regulation under which a government is permitted to\n\nmake an individualized assessment of the proposed uses for the property involved.\n\n       This is not the first time that the phrase “individualized assessment” has\n\nbeen employed. The United States Supreme Court distinguished its decision in\n\nBowen v Roy, 476 US 693; 106 S Ct 2147; 90 L Ed 2d 735 (1986), from its\n\ndecisions in Sherbert and Thomas v Review Bd of Indiana Employment Security\n\nDiv, 450 US 707; 101 S Ct 1425; 67 L Ed 2d 624 (1981), on the basis that the\n\nlatter decisions, unlike Bowen, involved “individualized assessments.”11 “The\n\n\n\n(…continued)\n              (A) the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity\n       that receives Federal financial assistance, even if the burden results\n       from a rule of general applicability;\n\n              (B) the substantial burden affects, or removal of that\n       substantial burden would affect, commerce with foreign nations,\n       among the several States, or with Indian tribes, even if the burden\n       results from a rule of general applicability . . . . [42 USC\n       2000cc(a)(2).]\n\nHowever, it is uncontested that A and B are not applicable to the instant case.\n       11\n          In Sherbert, as discussed above, the United States Supreme Court held\nthat South Carolina’s denial of unemployment compensation benefits to a member\nof the Seventh-Day Adventist Church who could not find work because her\nreligious convictions prevented her from working on Saturdays abridged her right\nto the free exercise of her religion. In Thomas, the United States Supreme Court\nheld that Indiana’s denial of unemployment compensation benefits to a Jehovah’s\nWitness who terminated his employment because his religious beliefs prevented\nhim from participating in the production of weapons abridged his right to the free\nexercise of his religion.\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\n\fstatutory conditions at issue in [Sherbert and Thomas] provided that a person was\n\nnot eligible for unemployment compensation benefits if, ‘without good cause,’ he\n\nhad quit work or refused available work. The ‘good cause’ standard created a\n\nmechanism for individualized exemptions.” Roy, supra at 708. In Sherbert and\n\nThomas, the Court held that when the government applies individualized\n\nexemptions, but refuses to extend an exemption to an instance of genuine\n\n“religious hardship,” the government must demonstrate a compelling reason for\n\ndenying the requested exemption. Id.\n\n       In Smith, supra at 884, the United States Supreme Court again emphasized\n\nthe distinction between governmental action requiring and not requiring\n\nindividualized assessments.\n\n               The Sherbert test, it must be recalled, was developed in a\n       context that lent itself to individualized governmental assessment of\n       the reasons for the relevant conduct. . . . [A] distinctive feature of\n       unemployment compensation programs is that their eligibility\n       criteria invite consideration of the particular circumstances behind\n       an applicant’s unemployment. . . . [O]ur decisions in the\n       unemployment cases stand for the proposition that where the State\n       has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to\n       extend that system to cases of “religious hardship” without\n       compelling reason. [Id., quoting Bowen, supra at 708.]\n\n       In Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc v City of Hialeah, 508 US 520,\n\n527; 113 S Ct 2217; 124 L Ed 2d 472 (1993), the United States Supreme Court,\n\nagainst the backdrop of a ritualistic practice of animal sacrifice by practitioners of\n\nthe Santerian faith, held that a city ordinance that prohibits a person from\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\n\f“unnecessarily . . . kill[ing] . . . an animal” violates the Free Exercise Clause of the\n\nFirst Amendment. The Court explained:\n\n               [B]ecause it requires an evaluation of the particular\n       justification for the killing, this ordinance represents a system of\n       “individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the\n       relevant conduct . . . .” As we noted in Smith, in circumstances in\n       which individualized exemptions from a general requirement are\n       available, the government “may not refuse to extend that system to\n       cases of ‘religious hardship’ without compelling reason.” [Id. at 537 \n\n       (citations omitted).] \n\n\n       “Individualize” is defined as “to . . . consider individually; specify; \n\n\nparticularize.” Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1991). Therefore,\n\nan “individualized assessment” is an assessment based on one’s particular\n\ncircumstances. Accordingly, RLUIPA applies when the government makes an\n\nassessment based on one’s particular or specific circumstances or has in place\n\nprocedures or practices that would allow the government to make an assessment\n\nbased on one’s particular or specific circumstances. As the Ninth Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals recently held, “RLUIPA applies when the government may take into\n\naccount the particular details of an applicant’s proposed use of land when deciding\n\nto permit or deny that use.” Guru Nanak Sikh Society of Yuba City v Sutter Co,\n\n456 F3d 978, 986 (CA 9, 2006).\n\n       In the instant case, the city adopted a zoning ordinance that applied to the\n\nentire community, not just to plaintiff. See West v City of Portage, 392 Mich 458,\n\n469; 221 NW2d 303 (1974) (“‘[Z]oning ordinances . . . are classified as general\n\npolicy decisions which apply to the entire community.’”) (Citation omitted.)\n\n\n                                          15\n\n\fConcomitantly, if the city had granted plaintiff’s request to rezone the property,\n\nsuch rezoning would also have applied to the entire community, not just\n\nplaintiff.12 A decision whether to rezone property does not involve consideration\n\nof only a particular or specific user or only a particular or specific project; rather,\n\nit involves the enactment of a new rule of general applicability, a new rule that\n\ngoverns all persons and all projects. See Sherrill v Town of Wrightsville Beach, 81\n\nNC App 369, 373; 344 SE2d 357 (1986) (“it is the duty of the zoning authority to\n\nconsider the needs of the entire community when voting on a rezoning, and not\n\njust the needs of the individual petitioner”).       Thus, if the city had granted\n\nplaintiff’s request to rezone the property from single-family residential to\n\nmultiple-family residential, plaintiff could then have sold the property to any third\n\nparty and that third party could have sold the property to any other third party and\n\nany of these parties could have built an apartment complex or any other\n\nconforming building on that property. Therefore, the city’s decision whether to\n\nrezone the property would not have been predicated on plaintiff’s particular\n\ncircumstances or plaintiff’s particular project.13 Even if the city had affirmatively\n\n\n\n       12\n           Although a request to rezone a particular piece of property “‘may be\ndifferentiated on the basis that such a determination is narrowly confined to a\nparticular piece of property,’” West, supra at 469 (citation omitted), it still applies\nto the “entire community.” That is, the “entire community” would be bound by\nthe city’s decision to rezone or not rezone the property.\n       13\n        Plaintiff’s counsel told the trial court that “even at the planning\ncommission level, they don’t care what’s being built”; “they don’t consider a site\n                                                                    (continued…)\n\n                                          16\n\n\fwanted plaintiff to build an apartment complex on its property, it could not have\n\ngranted the requested zoning change unless it was also prepared to accommodate\n\nall projects falling within the scope of the rezoning.         Plaintiff’s particular\n\ncircumstances were simply not determinative of the city’s decision whether to\n\nrezone, and, thus, the city’s decision did not constitute an “individualized\n\nassessment” within the meaning of that term.14 Plaintiff has cited no cases in\n\nsupport of its position that a refusal to rezone property constitutes an\n\n“individualized assessment,” and we have found none.\n\n       Moreover, plaintiff has presented no evidence to suggest that the city has in\n\nplace procedures or practices that would permit the city to make “individualized\n\nassessments” when determining whether to rezone property.\n\n\n\n(…continued) \n\nplan”; “the site plan itself is irrelevant when it comes to requesting rezoning from \n\nR-1 to R-3.” Appellant’s appendix at 238a, 523a. \n\n       14\n          Possibly, if plaintiff had requested a variance and the city had refused\nthat request, this might constitute an “individualized assessment.” See Shepherd,\nsupra at 320 (holding that “[w]hen the Ann Arbor Charter Township Zoning\nBoard of Appeals examined and subsequently denied plaintiff’s petition for a\nvariance, an individualized assessment pursuant to 42 USC 2000cc(a)(2)(C)\noccurred”). A request for a variance is significantly different from a request to\nrezone. When one requests a variance, one is requesting permission to use the\nproperty for a specific use. By contrast, when one requests a rezoning, one is\nasking the city for permission to use the property for any use that would be\npermitted under the new classification. Therefore, when the city considers a\nrequest for a variance, it does consider the specific site plan proposed by the\nlandowner. But, when the city considers a request for rezoning, it considers the\nnumerous different uses that would be permitted under the new classification, and\nit does not consider a specific site plan.\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\n\f       Because the city’s refusal to rezone the property did not constitute an\n\n“individualized assessment,” and because there is no evidence that the city has in\n\nplace procedures or practices that would permit it to make “individualized\n\nassessments” when determining whether to grant requests to rezone property,\n\nRLUIPA is not applicable here.\n\n                            B. RELIGIOUS EXERCISE\n\n       Assuming that RLUIPA is applicable here, the next question is whether the\n\nbuilding of an apartment complex constitutes a “religious exercise.” The burden is\n\non plaintiff to prove that the building of an apartment complex constitutes a\n\n“religious exercise.” 42 USC 2000cc-2(b). RLUIPA provides in pertinent part:\n\n               No government shall impose or implement a land use\n       regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the\n       religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or\n       institution, unless . . . . [42 USC 2000cc(a)(1) (emphasis added).]\n\n“Religious exercise” is defined as “any exercise of religion, whether or not\n\ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 USC 2000cc-\n\n5(7)(A). RLUIPA specifically provides that “[t]he use, building, or conversion of\n\nreal property for the purpose of religious exercise shall be considered to be\n\nreligious exercise of the person or entity that uses or intends to use the property for\n\nthat purpose.” 42 USC 2000cc-5(7)(B). A “religious exercise” consists of a\n\nspecific type of exercise, an exercise of religion, and this is not the equivalent of\n\nan exercise-- any exercise-- by a religious body.          “The term ‘religion’ has\n\nreference to one’s views of his relations to his Creator, and to the obligations they\n\n\n                                          18\n\n\fimpose of reverence for his being and character, and of obedience to his will.”\n\nDavis v Beason, 133 US 333, 342; 10 S Ct 299; 33 L Ed 637 (1890), overruled on\n\nother grounds in Romer v Evans, 517 US 620, 634; 116 S Ct 1620; 134 L Ed 2d\n\n855 (1996). The United States Supreme Court has explained that “‘[t]he “exercise\n\nof religion” often involves not only belief and profession but the performance of . .\n\n. physical acts [such as] assembling with others for a worship service [or]\n\nparticipating in sacramental use of bread and wine . . . .’” Cutter, supra at 720,\n\nquoting Smith, supra at 877.15        The Supreme Court has further held that\n\n“[a]lthough RLUIPA bars inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice is\n\n‘central’ to a prisoner’s religion, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A), the Act does not\n\npreclude inquiry into the sincerity of a prisoner’s professed religiosity. Cf. Gillette\n\nv. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 457, 91 S. Ct. 828, 28 L. Ed. 2d 168, (1971) (‘“The\n\n‘truth’ of a belief is not open to question”; rather, the question is whether the\n\nobjector’s beliefs are “truly held.”’ (quoting United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163,\n\n185, 85 S. Ct. 850, 13 L. Ed. 2d 733 (1965))).” Cutter, supra at 725 n 13. Nor,\n\nobviously, does RLUIPA bar inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice\n\nconstitutes an aspect, central or otherwise, of a person’s religion.\n\n\n       15\n          In Cutter, supra at 718, the United States Supreme Court held that\n“RLUIPA’s institutionalized-persons provision, § 3 of the Act, is consistent with\nthe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.” The Court also made clear\nthat “Section 2 of RLUIPA [the land use regulation provision] is not at issue here.\nWe therefore express no view on the validity of that part of the Act.” Id. at 716 n\n3.\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\n\f       The question that we must answer is whether plaintiff is seeking to use its\n\nproperty for the purpose of religious exercise.16 Obviously, not everything that a\n\nreligious institution does constitutes a “religious exercise.” Plaintiff bears the\n\nburden of establishing that its proposed use of the property constitutes a “religious\n\nexercise.” 42 USC 2000cc-2(b). In the instant case, the only evidence that\n\nplaintiff has presented to establish that its proposed use of the property constitutes\n\na “religious exercise” is an affidavit signed by the bishop of the Greater Bible Way\n\nTemple. The affidavit states that plaintiff’s mission is set forth in its letterhead as\n\nfollows:\n\n             The Greater Bible Way Temple stands for truth, the\n       promotion of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through the Apostolic\n       Doctrine, and an exceptional level of service to the community.\n       This includes housing, employment, consulting and supports as\n       determined appropriate in fulfilling our Mission.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          Notwithstanding the inquiry required by RLUIPA into what constitutes a\n“religious exercise,” this Court is extremely cognizant of the difficulties inherent\nin a judicial body’s evaluating the practices of particular religious faiths or\nassessing the “centrality” of particular religious precepts. In accord, Smith, supra\nat 890 (“It may fairly be said that leaving accommodation to the political process\nwill place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely\nengaged in; but that unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be\npreferred to a system in which each . . . judge[] weigh[s] the social importance of\nall laws against the centrality of all religious beliefs.”); Lemon v Kurtzman, 403\nUS 602, 613; 91 S Ct 2105; 29 L Ed 2d 745 (1971) (expressing concern about\nfostering an “‘excessive government entanglement with religion’”) (citation\nomitted).\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\n\fThe affidavit further states that plaintiff “wishes to further the teachings of Jesus\n\nChrist by providing housing and living assistance to the citizens of Jackson.”17\n\n       No evidence has been presented to establish that the proposed apartment\n\ncomplex would be used for religious worship or for any other religious activity.\n\nInstead, it appears that the only connection between the proposed apartment\n\ncomplex and “religious exercise” is the fact that the apartment complex would be\n\nowned by a religious institution. Generally, the building of an apartment complex\n\nwould be considered a commercial exercise, not a religious exercise. The fact that\n\nthe apartment complex would be owned by a religious institution does not\n\ntransform the building of an apartment complex into a “religious exercise,” unless\n\nthe term is to be deprived of all practical meaning. Something does not become a\n\n“religious exercise” just because it is performed by a religious institution.\n\nBecause plaintiff has not shown that the building of the apartment complex\n\nconstitutes an exercise in religion, the city’s decision not to rezone the property\n\ncannot be said to have burdened plaintiff’s “religious exercise,” and, thus,\n\nRLUIPA has not been violated.\n\n\n\n       17\n         The bishop’s affidavit proceeds to state that “there is a substantial need in\nthe City of Jackson for clean and affordable housing, especially for the elderly and\ndisabled.” However, because there is no evidence that the proposed complex\nwould either be limited to housing elderly and disabled persons or be designed to\naccommodate elderly and disabled persons to any particular extent, it is\nunnecessary to address whether the building of such a complex would constitute a\n“religious exercise.”\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\n\f                          C. SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN \n\n\n       Assuming, however, that the building of an apartment complex does\n\nconstitute a “religious exercise,” the next question is whether the city’s refusal to\n\nrezone the property to allow the apartment complex constitutes a “substantial\n\nburden” on that “religious exercise.” The burden is on plaintiff to prove that the\n\ncity’s refusal to rezone the property constitutes a “substantial burden” on\n\nplaintiff’s exercise of religion.   42 USC 2000cc-2(b).          RLUIPA provides in\n\npertinent part:\n\n               No government shall impose or implement a land use\n       regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the\n       religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or\n       institution, unless . . . . [42 USC 2000cc(a)(1) (emphasis added).]\n\nRLUIPA does not define the phrase “substantial burden.” However, this is not the\n\nfirst time that the phrase “substantial burden” has been used.\n\n       Before deciding Smith, the United States Supreme Court held that a\n\n“substantial burden” on one’s religious exercise that was not justified by a\n\ncompelling governmental interest violated the Free Exercise Clause.           Jimmy\n\nSwaggart Ministries v Bd of Equalization of California, 493 US 378, 384-385;\n\n110 S Ct 688; 107 L Ed 2d 796 (1990), quoting Hernandez v Comm’r of Internal\n\nRevenue, 490 US 680, 699; 109 S Ct 2136; 104 L Ed 2d 766 (1989) (“Our cases\n\nhave established that ‘the free exercise inquiry asks whether government has\n\nplaced a substantial burden on the observation of a central religious belief or\n\npractice and, if so, whether a compelling governmental interest justifies the\n\n\n                                         22\n\n\fburden.’”). The United States Supreme Court’s definition of “substantial burden”\n\nin its free exercise cases is instructive in determining what Congress understood\n\n“substantial burden” to mean in RLUIPA.\n\n       In Sherbert, supra at 404, the United States Supreme Court held that a\n\n“substantial burden” exists when an individual is “force[d] . . . to choose between\n\nfollowing the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and\n\nabandoning one of the precepts of her religion . . . on the other hand.”\n\n       In Thomas, supra at 717-718, the Supreme Court explained:\n\n              Where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit\n       upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such\n       a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby\n       putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior\n       and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists. While the\n       compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise is\n       nonetheless substantial.\n\n       In Lyng v Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 US 439, 450;\n\n108 S Ct 1319; 99 L Ed 2d 534 (1988), the United States Supreme Court\n\nexplained that “incidental effects of government programs, which may make it\n\nmore difficult to practice certain religions but which have no tendency to coerce\n\nindividuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs” do not constitute\n\n“substantial burdens.”18\n\n\n       18\n           Relying on Lyng, our Court of Appeals held that “for a burden on\nreligion to be substantial, the government regulation must compel action or\ninaction with respect to the sincerely held belief; mere inconvenience to the\nreligious institution or adherent is insufficient.” Shepherd, supra at 330.\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\n\f       Several federal circuit courts of appeal have also defined the term\n\n“substantial burden.” Although we are not bound by these decisions, Abela v Gen\n\nMotors Corp, 469 Mich 603, 606; 677 NW2d 325 (2004), we find them\n\npersuasive.\n\n       In Civil Liberties for Urban Believers v Chicago, 342 F3d 752 (CA 7,\n\n2003), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that a Chicago zoning ordinance\n\nthat allows churches as a matter of right in residential zones, but requires them to\n\nobtain special use permits in other zones, does not violate RLUIPA. That court\n\nexplained:\n\n              Application of the substantial burden provision to a regulation\n      inhibiting or constraining any religious exercise, including the use of\n      property for religious purposes, would render meaningless the word\n      “substantial,” because the slightest obstacle to religious exercise\n      incidental to the regulation of land use-- however minor the burden\n      it were to impose-- could then constitute a burden sufficient to\n      trigger RLUIPA’s requirement that the regulation advance a\n      compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means. We\n      therefore hold that, in the context of RLUIPA’s broad definition of\n      religious exercise, a land-use regulation that imposes a substantial\n      burden on religious exercise is one that necessarily bears direct,\n      primary, and fundamental responsibility for rendering religious\n      exercise-- including the use of real property for the purpose thereof\n      within the regulated jurisdiction generally-- effectively\n      impracticable.[19]\n\n             While [the ordinance] may contribute to the ordinary\n      difficulties associated with location (by any person or entity,\n      religious or nonreligious) in a large city, [it does] not render\n\n       19\n          In Lighthouse Institute for Evangelism Inc v City of Long Branch, 100\nFed Appx 70 (CA 3, 2004), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals adopted this same\ndefinition of “substantial burden.”\n\n\n\n                                        24\n\n\f      impracticable the use of real property in Chicago for religious\n      exercise, much less discourage churches from locating or attempting\n      to locate in Chicago. See, e.g., Love Church v. City of Evanston,\n      896 F.2d 1082, 1086 (7th Cir. 1990) (“Whatever specific difficulties\n      [plaintiff church] claims to have encountered, they are the same ones\n      that face all [land users]. The harsh reality of the marketplace\n      sometimes dictates that certain facilities are not available to those\n      who desire them”) . . . . Otherwise, compliance with RLUIPA\n      would require municipal governments not merely to treat religious\n      land uses on an equal footing with nonreligious land uses, but rather\n      to favor them in the form of an outright exemption from land-use\n      regulations. Unfortunately for Appellants, no such free pass for\n      religious land uses masquerades among the legitimate protections\n      RLUIPA affords to religious exercise. [Id. at 761-762 (emphasis in\n      the original).]\n\n      In San Jose Christian College v City of Morgan Hill, 360 F3d 1024 (CA 9,\n\n2004), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that there was no RLUIPA\n\nviolation where the city denied the plaintiff’s rezoning application.20 That court\n\nexplained:\n\n             A “burden” is “something that is oppressive.” BLACK’S\n      LAW DICTIONARY 190 (7th ed. 1999). “Substantial,” in turn, is\n      defined as “considerable in quantity” or “significantly great.”\n      MERRIAM-WEBSTER’S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 1170\n      (10th ed. 2002). Thus, for a land use regulation to impose a\n      “substantial burden,” it must be “oppressive” to a “significantly\n      great” extent. That is, a “substantial burden” on “religious exercise”\n      must impose a significantly great restriction or onus upon such\n      exercise.\n\n\n\n\n      20\n       We note that the court did not address the preliminary question whether\nRLUIPA was even applicable to the denial of the rezoning application.\n\n\n\n                                       25\n\n\f                                         * * *\n\n              [W]hile the PUD ordinance may have rendered College\n      unable to provide education and/or worship at the Property, there is\n      no evidence in the record demonstrating that College was precluded\n      from using other sites within the city. Nor is there any evidence that\n      the City would not impose the same requirements on any other entity\n      seeking to build something other than a hospital[21] on the Property.\n      [Id. at 1034, 1035.]\n\n      In Midrash Sephardi, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that an\n\nordinance that prohibits churches and synagogues in the town’s business district\n\ndoes not impose a “substantial burden” on the exercise of religion. That court\n\nexplained:\n\n             [A] “substantial burden” must place more than an\n      inconvenience on religious exercise; a “substantial burden” is akin to\n      significant pressure which directly coerces the religious adherent to\n      conform his or her behavior accordingly. Thus, a substantial burden\n      can result from pressure that tends to force adherents to forego\n      religious precepts or from pressure that mandates religious conduct.\n      [Midrash Sephardi, supra at 1227.]\n\n      In Adkins v Kaspar, 393 F3d 559 (CA 5, 2004), the Fifth Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals held that requiring the presence of a qualified outside volunteer at prison\n\ncongregations did not impose a “substantial burden” on the plaintiff’s exercise of\n\nreligion. That court explained:\n\n            [A] government action or regulation creates a “substantial\n      burden” on a religious exercise if it truly pressures the adherent to\n\n      21\n          A city task force concluded that the city urgently needed a hospital and\nthis particular piece of property was the only suitable location in the city for a\nhospital.\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\n\f       significantly modify his religious behavior and significantly violates\n       his religious beliefs. [T]he effect of a government action or\n       regulation is significant when it either (1) influences the adherent to\n       act in a way that violates his religious beliefs, or (2) forces the\n       adherent to choose between, on the one hand, enjoying some\n       generally available, non-trivial benefit, and, on the other hand,\n       following his religious beliefs. On the opposite end of the spectrum,\n       however, a government action or regulation does not rise to the level\n       of a substantial burden on religious exercise if it merely prevents the\n       adherent from either enjoying some benefit that is not otherwise\n       generally available or acting in a way that is not otherwise generally\n       allowed. [Id. at 570.]\n\n       In Spratt v Rhode Island Dep’t of Corrections, 482 F3d 33 (CA 1, 2007),\n\nwhich involved a blanket ban against all preaching activities by prison inmates,\n\nthe First Circuit Court of Appeals asserted:\n\n              The district court decided that a “substantial burden” is one\n       that “put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his\n       behavior and to violate his beliefs,” citing Thomas v. Review Board\n       of Indiana Employment Security Division, 450 U.S. 707, 718, 101 S.\n       Ct. 1425, 67 L. Ed. 2d 624 (1981); see also Lovelace v. Lee, 472\n       F.3d 174, 187 (4th Cir. 2006) (applying the Thomas standard in a\n       RLUIPA case). Assuming arguendo that Thomas applies, . . . Spratt\n       has made a prima facie showing that his religious exercise has been\n       substantially burdened. [Id. at 38.]\n\n       In Grace United Methodist Church v City of Cheyenne, 451 F3d 643 (CA\n\n10, 2006), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the city’s denial of the\n\nplaintiff church’s request for a variance from an ordinance prohibiting any entity\n\nfrom operating a commercial day care center in a residential zone did not violate\n\nRLUIPA. That court explained:\n\n              [T]he incidental effects of otherwise lawful government\n       programs “which may make it more difficult to practice certain\n       religions but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into\n\n\n                                         27\n\n\f      acting contrary to their religious beliefs” do not constitute\n      substantial burdens on the exercise of religion. [Id. at 662 (citation\n      omitted).][22]\n\n      After reviewing the above decisions, we believe that it is clear that a\n\n“substantial burden” on one’s “religious exercise” exists where there is\n\ngovernmental action that coerces one into acting contrary to one’s religious beliefs\n\nby way of doing something that one’s religion prohibits or refraining from doing\n\nsomething that one’s religion requires. That is, a “substantial burden” exists when\n\none is forced to choose between violating a law (or forfeiting an important benefit)\n\nand violating one’s religious tenets. A mere inconvenience or irritation does not\n\nconstitute a “substantial burden.” Similarly, something that simply makes it more\n\ndifficult in some respect to practice one’s religion does not constitute a\n\n\n\n      22\n         In Murphy v Missouri Dep’t of Corrections, 372 F3d 979, 988 (CA 8,\n2004), the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that, to constitute a substantial\nburden, the government policy or actions\n\n      must “significantly inhibit or constrain conduct or expression that\n      manifests some central tenet of a [person’s] individual [religious]\n      beliefs; must meaningfully curtail a [person’s] ability to express\n      adherence to his or her faith; or must deny a [person] reasonable\n      opportunities to engage in those activities that are fundamental to a\n      [person’s] religion.” [Citation omitted.]\n\nAlthough the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has applied the same test when\napplying RFRA, Miller-Bey v Schultz, 1996 US App LEXIS 6541 (CA 6, 1996), it\nhas not yet addressed the meaning of “substantial burden” under RLUIPA. The\nMurphy definition of “substantial burden” seems inconsistent with RLUIPA\nbecause RLUIPA specifically defines “religious exercise” as “any exercise of\nreligion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.”\n42 USC 2000cc-5(7)(A).\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\n\f“substantial burden.” Rather, a “substantial burden” is something that “coerce[s]\n\nindividuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs . . . .” Lyng, supra at\n\n450.23\n\n         In the instant case, plaintiff argues that the city’s refusal to rezone its\n\nproperty to allow it to build an apartment complex constitutes a “substantial\n\nburden” on its “religious exercise.”      Even assuming that the building of an\n\napartment complex constitutes a “religious exercise,” the city’s refusal to rezone\n\nthe property so plaintiff can build an apartment complex does not constitute a\n\n“substantial burden” on that exercise. The city is not forbidding plaintiff from\n\nbuilding an apartment complex; it is simply regulating where that apartment\n\ncomplex can be built. If plaintiff wants to build an apartment complex, it can do\n\nso; it just has to build it on property that is zoned for apartment complexes. If\n\nplaintiff wants to use the property for housing, then it can build single-family\n\n\n\n\n         23\n          We recognize that some courts have held that a “substantial burden”\nexists where there is “delay, uncertainty, and expense.” See, for example, Sts\nConstantine & Helen Greek Orthodox Church v City of New Berlin, 396 F3d 895,\n901 (CA 7, 2005), and Living Water Church of God v Meridian Charter Twp, 384\nF Supp 2d 1123, 1134 (WD Mich, 2005). However, we reject this definition of\n“substantial burden” both because it is inconsistent with the United States\nSupreme Court’s definition of the phrase and because it is inconsistent with the\ncommon understanding of the phrase “substantial burden.”\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\n\fresidences on the property. In other words, in the realm of building apartments,\n\nplaintiff has to follow the law like everyone else.24\n\n       “While [the zoning ordinance] may contribute to the ordinary difficulties\n\nassociated with location (by any person or entity, religious or nonreligious) in a\n\nlarge city,” Civil Liberties for Urban Believers, supra at 761, it does not prohibit\n\nplaintiff from providing housing. “Whatever specific difficulties [plaintiff church]\n\nclaims to have encountered, they are the same ones that face all [land users].” Id.,\n\nquoting Love Church, supra at 1086. The city has not done anything to coerce\n\nplaintiff into acting contrary to its religious beliefs, and, thus, it has not\n\nsubstantially burdened plaintiff’s exercise of religion. Lyng, supra at 450.25\n\n               D. COMPELLING GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST\n\n       Assuming that the city’s refusal to rezone the property constitutes a\n\n“substantial burden” on plaintiff’s “religious exercise,” the next question is\n\nwhether it is “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest.” The burden\n\nis on defendant to prove that the imposition of the burden on plaintiff is in\n\n\n       24\n           Plaintiff was aware when it purchased the property that it was zoned\nsingle-family residential. Thus, plaintiff’s claim that the city’s refusal to rezone\nthe property will cause it to lose the money that it invested in the property is\nmeritless.\n       25\n          We note that the lower courts’ interpretation of the “substantial burden”\nprovision of RLUIPA would seem to render the “discrimination and exclusion”\nprovision of RLUIPA effectively meaningless because it will almost always be\neasier to prove a “substantial burden” on one’s “religious exercise,” as those terms\n                                                                      (continued…)\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\n\ffurtherance of a compelling governmental interest.           42 USC 2000cc-2(b).\n\nRLUIPA provides in pertinent part:\n\n               No government shall impose or implement a land use\n       regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the\n       religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or\n       institution, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of\n       the burden on that person, assembly, or institution--\n\n              (A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\n       interest . . . . [42 USC 2000cc(a)(1) (emphasis added).]\n\n       After a bench trial on this issue, the trial court held that “this mere concern\n\nover zoning [does not] establish[] a compelling State interest.” We respectfully\n\ndisagree. It has long been recognized that “local governments have a compelling\n\ninterest in protecting the health and safety of their communities through the\n\nenforcement of the local zoning regulations.” Murphy v Zoning Comm of the\n\nTown of New Milford, 148 F Supp 2d 173, 190 (D Conn, 2001). “‘All property is\n\nheld subject to the right of the government to regulate its use in the exercise of the\n\npolice power so that it shall not be injurious to the rights of the community or so\n\nthat it may promote its health, morals, safety and welfare.’” Austin v Older, 283\n\nMich 667, 677; 278 NW 727 (1938), quoting State v Hillman, 110 Conn 92, 105;\n\n147 A 294 (1929). Therefore, a municipal body “clearly has a compelling interest\n\nin enacting and enforcing fair and reasonable zoning regulations.” First Baptist\n\n\n\n(…continued) \n\nare defined by the lower courts, than it will be to prove discrimination or \n\nexclusion. See n 8 supra. \n\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\n\fChurch of Perrine v Miami-Dade Co, 768 So 2d 1114, 1118 (Fla App, 2000). “A\n\ngovernment’s interest in zoning is indeed compelling.” Konikov v Orange Co,\n\n302 F Supp 2d 1328, 1343 (MD Fla, 2004); see also Midrash Sephardi v Town of\n\nSurfside, 2000 US Dist LEXIS 22629, *51 (SD Fla, 2000) (holding that “the\n\nzoning interests of Surfside may properly be characterized as compelling”). “The\n\ncompelling state interest and, hence, the municipal concern served by zoning\n\nregulation of land use is promotion of health, safety, morals or general welfare.”\n\nHome Bldg Co v Kansas City, 609 SW2d 168, 171 (Mo App, 1980). “[T]he\n\nordinance serves a compelling state interest; the City[’s] . . . police power to\n\nregulate the private use of the land.” Lyons, supra at 5-6. “The city has a\n\ncognizable compelling interest to enforce its zoning laws. . . . Reserving areas for\n\ncommercial activity both protects residential areas from commercial intrusion and\n\nfosters economic stability and growth.” Chicago Hts v Living Word Outreach Full\n\nGospel Church and Ministries, Inc, 302 Ill App 3d 564, 572; 707 NE2d 53 (1998);\n\nsee also Daytona Rescue Mission, Inc v City of Daytona Beach, 885 F Supp 1554,\n\n1560 (MD Fla, 1995) (holding that “the City’s interest in regulating homeless\n\nshelters and food banks is a compelling interest”).\n\n       In the instant case, the city has a compelling interest in regulating where\n\napartment complexes can be built within the city. As the United States Supreme\n\nCourt has explained:\n\n             The matter of zoning has received much attention at the hands\n       of commissions and experts, and the results of their investigations\n\n\n                                         32\n\n\f      have been set forth in comprehensive reports. These reports, which\n      bear every evidence of painstaking consideration, concur in the view\n      that the segregation of residential, business, and industrial buildings\n      will make it easier to provide fire apparatus suitable for the character\n      and intensity of the development in each section; that it will increase\n      the safety and security of home life; greatly tend to prevent street\n      accidents, especially to children, by reducing the traffic and resulting\n      confusion in residential sections; decrease noise and other conditions\n      which produce or intensify nervous disorders; preserve a more\n      favorable environment in which to rear children, etc. With particular\n      reference to apartment houses, it is pointed out that the development\n      of detached house sections is greatly retarded by the coming of\n      apartment houses, which has sometimes resulted in destroying the\n      entire section for private house purposes; that in such sections very\n      often the apartment house is a mere parasite, constructed in order to\n      take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings\n      created by the residential character of the district. Moreover, the\n      coming of one apartment house is followed by others, interfering by\n      their height and bulk with the free circulation of air and\n      monopolizing the rays of the sun which otherwise would fall upon\n      the smaller homes, and bringing, as their necessary accompaniments,\n      the disturbing noises incident to increased traffic and business, and\n      the occupation, by means of moving and parked automobiles, of\n      larger portions of the streets, thus detracting from their safety and\n      depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open spaces for play,\n      enjoyed by those in more favored localities-- until, finally, the\n      residential character of the neighborhood and its desirability as a\n      place of detached residences are utterly destroyed. Under these\n      circumstances, apartment houses, which in a different environment\n      would be not only entirely unobjectionable but highly desirable,\n      come very near to being nuisances. [Village of Euclid v Ambler\n      Realty Co, 272 US 365, 394-395; 47 S Ct 114; 71 L Ed 303 (1926).]\n\nSee also Kropf v Sterling Hts, 391 Mich 139, 159-160; 215 NW2d 179 (1974)\n\n(adopting the above analysis in addressing “why the local zoning board could\n\nreasonably restrict multiple dwellings in a residential area”). That a court will\n\ndefer to zoning authorities and will only overturn a zoning ordinance excluding\n\nother uses from a single-family residential area if it is arbitrary or capricious is\n\n\n                                        33\n\n\fevidence of the magnitude of the municipalities’ interest in such zoning\n\nordinances. Kropf, supra at 161 (holding that “[i]t is not for this Court to second\n\nguess the local governing bodies in the absence of a showing that that body was\n\narbitrary or capricious in its exclusion of other uses from a single-family\n\nresidential district”).\n\n       In this case, much testimony was presented regarding the city’s interest in\n\npreserving single-family neighborhoods. Charles Reisdorf, the Executive Director\n\nof the Regional Planning Commission, testified:\n\n               [I]n an area where you have a large number of single-family\n       residences, people have made purchases with the expectation that\n       there will be some stability in the neighborhood. For most of us, the\n       purchase of a home is the major expense of our life . . . . And so\n       when you–- when you have something that’s incompatible\n       interjected into a neighborhood area, it creates problems and often\n       results in a blighting situation . . . .\n\n       Dennis Diffenderfer, a planner who has been with the city’s Department of\n\nCommunity Development for nearly 20 years, testified:\n\n              [A]ny time you even add a duplex or a three- or four-unit or a\n       number of buildings that convert to rental, it does have a negative\n       effect on the adjoining neighbors. I can speak not only as a housing\n       professional, but from experiences.\n\n       Charles Aymond, who has served as the chairman of the Jackson Planning\n\nCommission for over ten years, testified:\n\n              [T]he City has experienced a great deal of blight and\n       destabilization as the result of commercial enterprises . . . or\n       different residential uses coming into what is generally referred to as\n       a higher residential use.\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\n\f       Plaintiff’s own architect, James Pappas, testified that if the property was\n\nrezoned multiple-family residential, as the plaintiff desires, a 45-foot apartment\n\ncomplex would be permitted and this would be “inappropriate with that\n\nneighborhood.”\n\n       Given the city’s general interest in zoning, and the city’s specific interest in\n\nmaintaining the character of this single-family residential neighborhood, we\n\nconclude that the city has a compelling interest in maintaining single-family\n\nresidential zoning and in not rezoning this area of the city.\n\n                        E. LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS\n\n       Given that the imposition of the burden on plaintiff is in furtherance of a\n\ncompelling governmental interest, the final question is whether a particular\n\ngovernmental action constitutes the “least restrictive” means of furthering that\n\ninterest. 42 USC 2000cc(a)(1)(B). The burden is on defendant to prove that an\n\naction constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling\n\ngovernmental interest. 42 USC 2000cc-2(b). RLUIPA provides in pertinent part:\n\n               No government shall impose or implement a land use\n       regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the\n       religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or\n       institution, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of\n       the burden on that person, assembly, or institution--\n\n              (A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest;\n       and\n\n             (B) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\n       governmental interest. [42 USC 2000cc(a)(1) (emphasis added).]\n\n\n\n\n                                          35\n\n\f       In the instant case, plaintiff asked the city to rezone the property from\n\nsingle-family residential to multiple-family residential. In response, the city could\n\nhave done one of two things-- it could have granted or it could have denied\n\nplaintiff’s request to rezone the property. The city decided to deny plaintiff’s\n\nrequest to rezone the property. That is, the city decided to maintain the single-\n\nfamily residential zoning. There do not appear to be any less restrictive means of\n\nmaintaining the single-family residential zoning.\n\n       For these reasons, we conclude that any burden placed on plaintiff’s\n\nexercise of religion is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and\n\nconstitutes the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental\n\ninterest.26 Therefore, even assuming that RLUIPA is applicable in the instant\n\ncase, it has not been violated.27\n\n\n\n       26\n           42 USC 1988(b) provides, “In any action or proceeding to enforce a\nprovision of . . . the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000\n. . . the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the\nUnited States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs . . . .” For the\nreasons discussed herein, plaintiff is not a “prevailing party,” and, therefore, is not\nentitled to attorney fees.\n       27\n          As discussed above, in City of Boerne, the United States Supreme Court\nheld that Congress, in enacting RFRA, had exceeded its power under § 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment to enact legislation enforcing the Free Exercise Clause\nbecause RFRA proscribes state conduct that the First Amendment itself does not.\nIn Smith, the United States Supreme Court held that generally applicable, religion-\nneutral laws that have the effect of burdening a particular religious practice need\nnot be justified under the Free Exercise Clause by a compelling governmental\ninterest. However, “where the State has in place a system of individual\nexemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of ‘religious hardship’\n                                                                      (continued…)\n\n                                          36\n\n\f                                V. CONCLUSION \n\n\n        RLUIPA applies to burdens imposed by governmental bodies on “religious\n\nexercises” in the course of implementing land use regulations under which\n\n“individualized assessments” may be made of the proposed uses for the land. An\n\n“individualized assessment” is an assessment based on one’s particular or specific\n\ncircumstances.    A decision concerning a request to rezone property does not\n\ninvolve an “individualized assessment.” Therefore, RLUIPA is not applicable\n\nhere.\n\n        A “religious exercise” constitutes “any exercise of religion, whether or not\n\ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 USC 2000cc-\n\n5(7)(A). However, something does not become a “religious exercise” just because\n\nit is carried out by a religious institution. Because the only connection between\n\nreligion and the construction of the apartment complex in this case is the fact that\n\n\n\n\n(…continued)\nwithout compelling reason.” Smith, supra at 884. Proponents of RLUIPA argue\nthat Congress has the authority to enact RLUIPA because it merely codifies Smith.\nHowever, the lower courts in the instant case held that, under RLUIPA, a religious\ninstitution need not abide by a generally applicable, religion-neutral zoning\nordinance unless it is justified by a compelling governmental interest. This seems\ninconsistent with the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in Smith, which, held that\na generally applicable, religion-neutral law does not have to be justified by such\nan interest. Whenever possible, courts should construe statutes in a manner that\nrenders them constitutional. People v Bricker, 389 Mich 524, 528; 208 NW2d 172\n(1973). Because the lower courts’ interpretation of RLUIPA would render\nRLUIPA unconstitutional, we reject their interpretation and instead adopt the\ninterpretation set forth in this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\n\fthe apartment complex would be owned by a religious institution, the building of\n\nthe apartment complex does not constitute a “religious exercise.”\n\n       A “substantial burden” on one’s “religious exercise” exists where there is\n\ngovernmental action that coerces one into acting contrary to one’s religious beliefs\n\nby way of doing something that one’s religion prohibits or refraining from doing\n\nsomething that one’s religion requires. A mere inconvenience or irritation does\n\nnot constitute a “substantial burden”; similarly, something that simply makes it\n\nmore difficult in some respect to practice one’s religion does not constitute a\n\n“substantial burden.”     Because the city has not done anything to coerce plaintiff\n\ninto acting contrary to its religious beliefs, the city has not substantially burdened\n\nplaintiff’s religious exercise.\n\n       Even if the city did substantially burden plaintiff’s religious exercise,\n\nimposition of that burden here is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\n\ninterest, namely, the enforcement of local zoning ordinances, and constitutes the\n\nleast restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\n\nTherefore, even assuming that RLUIPA is applicable, RLUIPA was not violated.\n\nFor these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand\n\nthis case to the trial court for the entry of a judgment in favor of defendants.\n\n                                                   Stephen J.

The lower\n\n courts held that RLUIPA does entitle plaintiff to the rezoning of its property. We\n\n conclude that a refusal to rezone does not constitute an “individualized\n\n assessment,” and, thus, that RLUIPA is inapplicable. Further, even if RLUIPA is\n\fapplicable, the building of an apartment complex does not constitute a “religious\n\nexercise,” and even if it does constitute a “religious exercise,” the city of\n\nJackson’s refusal to rezone plaintiff’s property did not substantially burden\n\nplaintiff’s religious exercise, and even if it did substantially burden plaintiff’s\n\nreligious exercise, the imposition of that burden is in furtherance of a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest and constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering that\n\ninterest. Therefore, even assuming that RLUIPA is applicable, it has not been\n\nviolated. For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\n\nremand this case to the trial court for the entry of a judgment in favor of\n\ndefendants.\n\n                   I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Plaintiff wants to build an apartment complex across the street from its\n\nchurch on property that it owns in the city of Jackson. The property consists of\n\neight lots totaling 1.13 acres. The property is zoned single-family residential (R-\n\n1). One of the lots contains a single-family residence, and the remaining lots are\n\nvacant. There are single-family residences on each side of the property. Plaintiff\n\npetitioned the city to change the zoning of the property to multiple-family\n\nresidential (R-3) so that it could construct an apartment complex.\n\n       The Region 2 Planning Commission recommended denying plaintiff’s\n\nrezoning petition. After a public hearing, the city planning commission also voted\n\nto recommend that the city council deny plaintiff’s rezoning petition. Pursuant to\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\n\fthese recommendations, and following another public hearing, the city council\n\nvoted to deny plaintiff’s rezoning petition.\n\n       Plaintiff then filed a complaint against defendants, containing two counts:\n\ncount one directly challenged the city’s zoning decision and count two alleged a\n\nviolation of RLUIPA. The trial court granted defendants’ motion for summary\n\ndisposition with regard to count one, which decision was not appealed. With\n\nregard to count two, the trial court denied defendants’ motion for summary\n\ndisposition and granted plaintiff’s motion for summary disposition in part.\n\nSpecifically, the trial court ruled that RLUIPA did apply because the city’s zoning\n\ndecision constituted an “individualized assessment,” and the refusal to rezone\n\nplaintiff’s property imposed a “substantial burden” on the exercise of religion.\n\nThe trial court then ordered a trial on the issue whether the city had a compelling\n\ninterest for its refusal to rezone. After a bench trial, the trial court ruled that\n\ndefendants had failed to demonstrate such an interest. Therefore, it determined\n\nthat defendants had violated RLUIPA and that plaintiff was entitled to the\n\nrequested rezoning of its property.      The trial court enjoined defendant from\n\ninterfering in any manner with plaintiff’s efforts to construct an apartment\n\ncomplex on its property. After the final order was issued, plaintiff filed a motion\n\nfor attorney fees and costs and the trial court awarded plaintiff over $30,000 in\n\nattorney fees and costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\n\f      The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court in all respects. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

The South Carolina Unemployment Compensation Act, SC Code, Tit\n\n68, § 68-1 et seq., provided that a claimant was ineligible for benefits if the\n\nclaimant had failed “without good cause” to accept available suitable work. The\n\nEmployment Security Commission determined that the plaintiff’s religious belief\n\nagainst working on Saturdays did not constitute “good cause.” The United States\n\nSupreme Court held that denying the plaintiff unemployment compensation\n\nbenefits solely because of her refusal to accept employment in which she would\n\nhave to work on Saturdays contrary to her religious belief imposed a substantial\n\nburden on her exercise of her religion that was not justified by a compelling state\n\ninterest, and, thus, violated the Free Exercise Clause.\n\n       In Employment Div, Dep’t of Human Resources of Oregon v Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court explained\n\nthat generally applicable, religion-neutral laws that have the effect of burdening a\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\n\fparticular religious practice need not be justified, under the Free Exercise Clause,\n\nby a compelling governmental interest.1\n\n       In response to Smith, Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration\n\nAct of 1993 (RFRA),2 prohibiting the government from substantially burdening a\n\nperson’s exercise of religion, even by means of a generally applicable, religion-\n\nneutral law, unless the government could demonstrate that the burden imposed\n\nfurthers a compelling governmental interest and that it constitutes the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering such interest.\n\n\n\n       1\n          Smith, supra at 884, held that Sherbert was distinguishable because\nSherbert involved an “individualized governmental assessment”; that is, the “good\ncause” standard at issue in Sherbert allowed the government to consider the\nplaintiff’s “particular circumstances.” See pp 15-17 infra. That is, Smith held that\nwhile the “compelling governmental interest” test may be applicable to laws\nallowing for an “individualized governmental assessment,” it is not applicable to\ngenerally applicable laws that do not allow for an “individualized governmental\nassessment.”\n       2\n           RFRA provides, in pertinent part:\n\n             (a) In general. Government shall not substantially burden a\n       person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of\n       general applicability, except as provided in subsection (b).\n\n              (b) Exception. Government may substantially burden a\n       person’s exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application\n       of the burden to the person--\n\n                (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest;\n       and\n\n             (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\n       governmental interest.

The\n      Court has described this power as “remedial . . . .” The design of the\n      Amendment and the text of § 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion\n      that Congress has the power to decree the substance of the\n      Fourteenth Amendment’s restrictions on the States. Legislation\n      which alters the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause cannot be said\n      to be enforcing the Clause.         Congress does not enforce a\n      constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been given\n      the power “to enforce,” not the power to determine what constitutes\n      a constitutional violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be\n      enforcing would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the\n      “provisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].”\n\n              While the line between measures that remedy or prevent\n      unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive\n      change in the governing law is not easy to discern, and Congress\n      must have wide latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction\n      exists and must be observed. There must be a congruence and\n      proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and\n      the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a connection,\n      legislation may become substantive in operation and effect.

[42 USC\n       2000cc(a)(2).]\n\nHowever, it is uncontested that A and B are not applicable to the instant case.\n       11\n          In Sherbert, as discussed above, the United States Supreme Court held\nthat South Carolina’s denial of unemployment compensation benefits to a member\nof the Seventh-Day Adventist Church who could not find work because her\nreligious convictions prevented her from working on Saturdays abridged her right\nto the free exercise of her religion. In Thomas, the United States Supreme Court\nheld that Indiana’s denial of unemployment compensation benefits to a Jehovah’s\nWitness who terminated his employment because his religious beliefs prevented\nhim from participating in the production of weapons abridged his right to the free\nexercise of his religion.\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\n\fstatutory conditions at issue in [Sherbert and Thomas] provided that a person was\n\nnot eligible for unemployment compensation benefits if, ‘without good cause,’ he\n\nhad quit work or refused available work. The ‘good cause’ standard created a\n\nmechanism for individualized exemptions.” Roy, supra at 708. In Sherbert and\n\nThomas, the Court held that when the government applies individualized\n\nexemptions, but refuses to extend an exemption to an instance of genuine\n\n“religious hardship,” the government must demonstrate a compelling reason for\n\ndenying the requested exemption. Id.\n\n       In Smith, supra at 884, the United States Supreme Court again emphasized\n\nthe distinction between governmental action requiring and not requiring\n\nindividualized assessments.\n\n               The Sherbert test, it must be recalled, was developed in a\n       context that lent itself to individualized governmental assessment of\n       the reasons for the relevant conduct. . . . [A] distinctive feature of\n       unemployment compensation programs is that their eligibility\n       criteria invite consideration of the particular circumstances behind\n       an applicant’s unemployment. . . . [O]ur decisions in the\n       unemployment cases stand for the proposition that where the State\n       has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to\n       extend that system to cases of “religious hardship” without\n       compelling reason.

The Court explained:\n\n               [B]ecause it requires an evaluation of the particular\n       justification for the killing, this ordinance represents a system of\n       “individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the\n       relevant conduct . . . .” As we noted in Smith, in circumstances in\n       which individualized exemptions from a general requirement are\n       available, the government “may not refuse to extend that system to\n       cases of ‘religious hardship’ without compelling reason.” [Id. at 537 \n\n       (citations omitted).] \n\n\n       “Individualize” is defined as “to . . . consider individually; specify; \n\n\nparticularize.” Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1991). Therefore,\n\nan “individualized assessment” is an assessment based on one’s particular\n\ncircumstances. Accordingly, RLUIPA applies when the government makes an\n\nassessment based on one’s particular or specific circumstances or has in place\n\nprocedures or practices that would allow the government to make an assessment\n\nbased on one’s particular or specific circumstances. As the Ninth Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals recently held, “RLUIPA applies when the government may take into\n\naccount the particular details of an applicant’s proposed use of land when deciding\n\nto permit or deny that use.” Guru Nanak Sikh Society of Yuba City v Sutter Co,\n\n456 F3d 978, 986 (CA 9, 2006).\n\n       In the instant case, the city adopted a zoning ordinance that applied to the\n\nentire community, not just to plaintiff. See West v City of Portage, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1842735\"><a href=\"/opinion/1842735/west-v-city-of-portage/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n469; 221 NW2d 303 (1974) (“‘[Z]oning ordinances . . . are classified as general\n\npolicy decisions which apply to the entire community.’”) (Citation omitted.)\n\n\n                                          15\n\n\fConcomitantly, if the city had granted plaintiff’s request to rezone the property,\n\nsuch rezoning would also have applied to the entire community, not just\n\nplaintiff.12 A decision whether to rezone property does not involve consideration\n\nof only a particular or specific user or only a particular or specific project; rather,\n\nit involves the enactment of a new rule of general applicability, a new rule that\n\ngoverns all persons and all projects. See Sherrill v Town of Wrightsville Beach, 81\n\nNC App 369, 373; 344 SE2d 357 (1986) (“it is the duty of the zoning authority to\n\nconsider the needs of the entire community when voting on a rezoning, and not\n\njust the needs of the individual petitioner”).       Thus, if the city had granted\n\nplaintiff’s request to rezone the property from single-family residential to\n\nmultiple-family residential, plaintiff could then have sold the property to any third\n\nparty and that third party could have sold the property to any other third party and\n\nany of these parties could have built an apartment complex or any other\n\nconforming building on that property. Therefore, the city’s decision whether to\n\nrezone the property would not have been predicated on plaintiff’s particular\n\ncircumstances or plaintiff’s particular project.13 Even if the city had affirmatively\n\n\n\n       12\n           Although a request to rezone a particular piece of property “‘may be\ndifferentiated on the basis that such a determination is narrowly confined to a\nparticular piece of property,’” West, supra at 469 (citation omitted), it still applies\nto the “entire community.” That is, the “entire community” would be bound by\nthe city’s decision to rezone or not rezone the property.\n       13\n        Plaintiff’s counsel told the trial court that “even at the planning\ncommission level, they don’t care what’s being built”; “they don’t consider a site\n                                                                    (continued…)\n\n                                          16\n\n\fwanted plaintiff to build an apartment complex on its property, it could not have\n\ngranted the requested zoning change unless it was also prepared to accommodate\n\nall projects falling within the scope of the rezoning.         Plaintiff’s particular\n\ncircumstances were simply not determinative of the city’s decision whether to\n\nrezone, and, thus, the city’s decision did not constitute an “individualized\n\nassessment” within the meaning of that term.14 Plaintiff has cited no cases in\n\nsupport of its position that a refusal to rezone property constitutes an\n\n“individualized assessment,” and we have found none.\n\n       Moreover, plaintiff has presented no evidence to suggest that the city has in\n\nplace procedures or practices that would permit the city to make “individualized\n\nassessments” when determining whether to rezone property.\n\n\n\n(…continued) \n\nplan”; “the site plan itself is irrelevant when it comes to requesting rezoning from \n\nR-1 to R-3.” Appellant’s appendix at 238a, 523a. \n\n       14\n          Possibly, if plaintiff had requested a variance and the city had refused\nthat request, this might constitute an “individualized assessment.” See Shepherd,\nsupra at 320 (holding that “[w]hen the Ann Arbor Charter Township Zoning\nBoard of Appeals examined and subsequently denied plaintiff’s petition for a\nvariance, an individualized assessment pursuant to 42 USC 2000cc(a)(2)(C)\noccurred”). A request for a variance is significantly different from a request to\nrezone. When one requests a variance, one is requesting permission to use the\nproperty for a specific use. By contrast, when one requests a rezoning, one is\nasking the city for permission to use the property for any use that would be\npermitted under the new classification. Therefore, when the city considers a\nrequest for a variance, it does consider the specific site plan proposed by the\nlandowner. But, when the city considers a request for rezoning, it considers the\nnumerous different uses that would be permitted under the new classification, and\nit does not consider a specific site plan.\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\n\f       Because the city’s refusal to rezone the property did not constitute an\n\n“individualized assessment,” and because there is no evidence that the city has in\n\nplace procedures or practices that would permit it to make “individualized\n\nassessments” when determining whether to grant requests to rezone property,\n\nRLUIPA is not applicable here.\n\n                            B. RELIGIOUS EXERCISE\n\n       Assuming that RLUIPA is applicable here, the next question is whether the\n\nbuilding of an apartment complex constitutes a “religious exercise.” The burden is\n\non plaintiff to prove that the building of an apartment complex constitutes a\n\n“religious exercise.” 42 USC 2000cc-2(b). RLUIPA provides in pertinent part:\n\n               No government shall impose or implement a land use\n       regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the\n       religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or\n       institution, unless . . . . [42 USC 2000cc(a)(1) (emphasis added).]\n\n“Religious exercise” is defined as “any exercise of religion, whether or not\n\ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 USC 2000cc-\n\n5(7)(A). RLUIPA specifically provides that “[t]he use, building, or conversion of\n\nreal property for the purpose of religious exercise shall be considered to be\n\nreligious exercise of the person or entity that uses or intends to use the property for\n\nthat purpose.” 42 USC 2000cc-5(7)(B). A “religious exercise” consists of a\n\nspecific type of exercise, an exercise of religion, and this is not the equivalent of\n\nan exercise-- any exercise-- by a religious body.          “The term ‘religion’ has\n\nreference to one’s views of his relations to his Creator, and to the obligations they\n\n\n                                          18\n\n\fimpose of reverence for his being and character, and of obedience to his will.”\n\nDavis v Beason, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92674\"><a href=\"/opinion/92674/davis-v-beason/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92674\"><a href=\"/opinion/92674/davis-v-beason/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nor,\n\nobviously, does RLUIPA bar inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice\n\nconstitutes an aspect, central or otherwise, of a person’s religion.\n\n\n       15\n          In Cutter, supra at 718, the United States Supreme Court held that\n“RLUIPA’s institutionalized-persons provision, § 3 of the Act, is consistent with\nthe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.” The Court also made clear\nthat “Section 2 of RLUIPA [the land use regulation provision] is not at issue here.\nWe therefore express no view on the validity of that part of the Act.” Id. at 716 n\n3.\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\n\f       The question that we must answer is whether plaintiff is seeking to use its\n\nproperty for the purpose of religious exercise.16 Obviously, not everything that a\n\nreligious institution does constitutes a “religious exercise.” Plaintiff bears the\n\nburden of establishing that its proposed use of the property constitutes a “religious\n\nexercise.” 42 USC 2000cc-2(b). In the instant case, the only evidence that\n\nplaintiff has presented to establish that its proposed use of the property constitutes\n\na “religious exercise” is an affidavit signed by the bishop of the Greater Bible Way\n\nTemple. The affidavit states that plaintiff’s mission is set forth in its letterhead as\n\nfollows:\n\n             The Greater Bible Way Temple stands for truth, the\n       promotion of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through the Apostolic\n       Doctrine, and an exceptional level of service to the community.\n       This includes housing, employment, consulting and supports as\n       determined appropriate in fulfilling our Mission.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          Notwithstanding the inquiry required by RLUIPA into what constitutes a\n“religious exercise,” this Court is extremely cognizant of the difficulties inherent\nin a judicial body’s evaluating the practices of particular religious faiths or\nassessing the “centrality” of particular religious precepts. In accord, Smith, supra\nat 890 (“It may fairly be said that leaving accommodation to the political process\nwill place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely\nengaged in; but that unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be\npreferred to a system in which each . . . judge[] weigh[s] the social importance of\nall laws against the centrality of all religious beliefs.”); Lemon v Kurtzman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108380\"><a href=\"/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 613; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108380\"><a href=\"/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Generally, the building of an apartment complex\n\nwould be considered a commercial exercise, not a religious exercise. The fact that\n\nthe apartment complex would be owned by a religious institution does not\n\ntransform the building of an apartment complex into a “religious exercise,” unless\n\nthe term is to be deprived of all practical meaning. Something does not become a\n\n“religious exercise” just because it is performed by a religious institution.\n\nBecause plaintiff has not shown that the building of the apartment complex\n\nconstitutes an exercise in religion, the city’s decision not to rezone the property\n\ncannot be said to have burdened plaintiff’s “religious exercise,” and, thus,\n\nRLUIPA has not been violated.\n\n\n\n       17\n         The bishop’s affidavit proceeds to state that “there is a substantial need in\nthe City of Jackson for clean and affordable housing, especially for the elderly and\ndisabled.” However, because there is no evidence that the proposed complex\nwould either be limited to housing elderly and disabled persons or be designed to\naccommodate elderly and disabled persons to any particular extent, it is\nunnecessary to address whether the building of such a complex would constitute a\n“religious exercise.”\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\n\f                          C. SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN \n\n\n       Assuming, however, that the building of an apartment complex does\n\nconstitute a “religious exercise,” the next question is whether the city’s refusal to\n\nrezone the property to allow the apartment complex constitutes a “substantial\n\nburden” on that “religious exercise.” The burden is on plaintiff to prove that the\n\ncity’s refusal to rezone the property constitutes a “substantial burden” on\n\nplaintiff’s exercise of religion.   42 USC 2000cc-2(b).          RLUIPA provides in\n\npertinent part:\n\n               No government shall impose or implement a land use\n       regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the\n       religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or\n       institution, unless . . . . [42 USC 2000cc(a)(1) (emphasis added).]\n\nRLUIPA does not define the phrase “substantial burden.” However, this is not the\n\nfirst time that the phrase “substantial burden” has been used.\n\n       Before deciding Smith, the United States Supreme Court held that a\n\n“substantial burden” on one’s religious exercise that was not justified by a\n\ncompelling governmental interest violated the Free Exercise Clause.

That court\n\nexplained:\n\n              Application of the substantial burden provision to a regulation\n      inhibiting or constraining any religious exercise, including the use of\n      property for religious purposes, would render meaningless the word\n      “substantial,” because the slightest obstacle to religious exercise\n      incidental to the regulation of land use-- however minor the burden\n      it were to impose-- could then constitute a burden sufficient to\n      trigger RLUIPA’s requirement that the regulation advance a\n      compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means. We\n      therefore hold that, in the context of RLUIPA’s broad definition of\n      religious exercise, a land-use regulation that imposes a substantial\n      burden on religious exercise is one that necessarily bears direct,\n      primary, and fundamental responsibility for rendering religious\n      exercise-- including the use of real property for the purpose thereof\n      within the regulated jurisdiction generally-- effectively\n      impracticable.[19]\n\n             While [the ordinance] may contribute to the ordinary\n      difficulties associated with location (by any person or entity,\n      religious or nonreligious) in a large city, [it does] not render\n\n       19\n          In Lighthouse Institute for Evangelism Inc v City of Long Branch, 100\nFed Appx 70 (CA 3, 2004), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals adopted this same\ndefinition of “substantial burden.”\n\n\n\n                                        24\n\n\f      impracticable the use of real property in Chicago for religious\n      exercise, much less discourage churches from locating or attempting\n      to locate in Chicago.

Otherwise, compliance with RLUIPA\n      would require municipal governments not merely to treat religious\n      land uses on an equal footing with nonreligious land uses, but rather\n      to favor them in the form of an outright exemption from land-use\n      regulations. Unfortunately for Appellants, no such free pass for\n      religious land uses masquerades among the legitimate protections\n      RLUIPA affords to religious exercise.

Thus, for a land use regulation to impose a\n      “substantial burden,” it must be “oppressive” to a “significantly\n      great” extent. That is, a “substantial burden” on “religious exercise”\n      must impose a significantly great restriction or onus upon such\n      exercise.\n\n\n\n\n      20\n       We note that the court did not address the preliminary question whether\nRLUIPA was even applicable to the denial of the rezoning application.\n\n\n\n                                       25\n\n\f                                         * * *\n\n              [W]hile the PUD ordinance may have rendered College\n      unable to provide education and/or worship at the Property, there is\n      no evidence in the record demonstrating that College was precluded\n      from using other sites within the city. Nor is there any evidence that\n      the City would not impose the same requirements on any other entity\n      seeking to build something other than a hospital[21] on the Property.\n      [Id. at 1034, 1035.]\n\n      In Midrash Sephardi, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that an\n\nordinance that prohibits churches and synagogues in the town’s business district\n\ndoes not impose a “substantial burden” on the exercise of religion. That court\n\nexplained:\n\n             [A] “substantial burden” must place more than an\n      inconvenience on religious exercise; a “substantial burden” is akin to\n      significant pressure which directly coerces the religious adherent to\n      conform his or her behavior accordingly. Thus, a substantial burden\n      can result from pressure that tends to force adherents to forego\n      religious precepts or from pressure that mandates religious conduct.\n      [Midrash Sephardi, supra at 1227.]\n\n      In Adkins v Kaspar, 393 F3d 559 (CA 5, 2004), the Fifth Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals held that requiring the presence of a qualified outside volunteer at prison\n\ncongregations did not impose a “substantial burden” on the plaintiff’s exercise of\n\nreligion. That court explained:\n\n            [A] government action or regulation creates a “substantial\n      burden” on a religious exercise if it truly pressures the adherent to\n\n      21\n          A city task force concluded that the city urgently needed a hospital and\nthis particular piece of property was the only suitable location in the city for a\nhospital.\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\n\f       significantly modify his religious behavior and significantly violates\n       his religious beliefs. [T]he effect of a government action or\n       regulation is significant when it either (1) influences the adherent to\n       act in a way that violates his religious beliefs, or (2) forces the\n       adherent to choose between, on the one hand, enjoying some\n       generally available, non-trivial benefit, and, on the other hand,\n       following his religious beliefs. On the opposite end of the spectrum,\n       however, a government action or regulation does not rise to the level\n       of a substantial burden on religious exercise if it merely prevents the\n       adherent from either enjoying some benefit that is not otherwise\n       generally available or acting in a way that is not otherwise generally\n       allowed.

Assuming arguendo that Thomas applies, . . . Spratt\n       has made a prima facie showing that his religious exercise has been\n       substantially burdened. [Id. at 38.]\n\n       In Grace United Methodist Church v City of Cheyenne, 451 F3d 643 (CA\n\n10, 2006), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the city’s denial of the\n\nplaintiff church’s request for a variance from an ordinance prohibiting any entity\n\nfrom operating a commercial day care center in a residential zone did not violate\n\nRLUIPA. That court explained:\n\n              [T]he incidental effects of otherwise lawful government\n       programs “which may make it more difficult to practice certain\n       religions but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into\n\n\n                                         27\n\n\f      acting contrary to their religious beliefs” do not constitute\n      substantial burdens on the exercise of religion. [Id. at 662 (citation\n      omitted).][22]\n\n      After reviewing the above decisions, we believe that it is clear that a\n\n“substantial burden” on one’s “religious exercise” exists where there is\n\ngovernmental action that coerces one into acting contrary to one’s religious beliefs\n\nby way of doing something that one’s religion prohibits or refraining from doing\n\nsomething that one’s religion requires. That is, a “substantial burden” exists when\n\none is forced to choose between violating a law (or forfeiting an important benefit)\n\nand violating one’s religious tenets. A mere inconvenience or irritation does not\n\nconstitute a “substantial burden.” Similarly, something that simply makes it more\n\ndifficult in some respect to practice one’s religion does not constitute a\n\n\n\n      22\n         In Murphy v Missouri Dep’t of Corrections, 372 F3d 979, 988 (CA 8,\n2004), the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that, to constitute a substantial\nburden, the government policy or actions\n\n      must “significantly inhibit or constrain conduct or expression that\n      manifests some central tenet of a [person’s] individual [religious]\n      beliefs; must meaningfully curtail a [person’s] ability to express\n      adherence to his or her faith; or must deny a [person] reasonable\n      opportunities to engage in those activities that are fundamental to a\n      [person’s] religion.” [Citation omitted.]\n\nAlthough the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has applied the same test when\napplying RFRA, Miller-Bey v Schultz, 1996 US App LEXIS 6541 (CA 6, 1996), it\nhas not yet addressed the meaning of “substantial burden” under RLUIPA. The\nMurphy definition of “substantial burden” seems inconsistent with RLUIPA\nbecause RLUIPA specifically defines “religious exercise” as “any exercise of\nreligion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.”\n42 USC 2000cc-5(7)(A).\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\n\f“substantial burden.” Rather, a “substantial burden” is something that “coerce[s]\n\nindividuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs . . . .” Lyng, supra at\n\n450.23\n\n         In the instant case, plaintiff argues that the city’s refusal to rezone its\n\nproperty to allow it to build an apartment complex constitutes a “substantial\n\nburden” on its “religious exercise.”      Even assuming that the building of an\n\napartment complex constitutes a “religious exercise,” the city’s refusal to rezone\n\nthe property so plaintiff can build an apartment complex does not constitute a\n\n“substantial burden” on that exercise. The city is not forbidding plaintiff from\n\nbuilding an apartment complex; it is simply regulating where that apartment\n\ncomplex can be built. If plaintiff wants to build an apartment complex, it can do\n\nso; it just has to build it on property that is zoned for apartment complexes. If\n\nplaintiff wants to use the property for housing, then it can build single-family\n\n\n\n\n         23\n          We recognize that some courts have held that a “substantial burden”\nexists where there is “delay, uncertainty, and expense.” See, for example, Sts\nConstantine & Helen Greek Orthodox Church v City of New Berlin, 396 F3d 895,\n901 (CA 7, 2005), and Living Water Church of God v Meridian Charter Twp, 384\nF Supp 2d 1123, 1134 (WD Mich, 2005). However, we reject this definition of\n“substantial burden” both because it is inconsistent with the United States\nSupreme Court’s definition of the phrase and because it is inconsistent with the\ncommon understanding of the phrase “substantial burden.”\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\n\fresidences on the property. In other words, in the realm of building apartments,\n\nplaintiff has to follow the law like everyone else.24\n\n       “While [the zoning ordinance] may contribute to the ordinary difficulties\n\nassociated with location (by any person or entity, religious or nonreligious) in a\n\nlarge city,” Civil Liberties for Urban Believers, supra at 761, it does not prohibit\n\nplaintiff from providing housing. “Whatever specific difficulties [plaintiff church]\n\nclaims to have encountered, they are the same ones that face all [land users].” Id.,\n\nquoting Love Church, supra at 1086. The city has not done anything to coerce\n\nplaintiff into acting contrary to its religious beliefs, and, thus, it has not\n\nsubstantially burdened plaintiff’s exercise of religion. Lyng, supra at 450.25\n\n               D. COMPELLING GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST\n\n       Assuming that the city’s refusal to rezone the property constitutes a\n\n“substantial burden” on plaintiff’s “religious exercise,” the next question is\n\nwhether it is “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest.” The burden\n\nis on defendant to prove that the imposition of the burden on plaintiff is in\n\n\n       24\n           Plaintiff was aware when it purchased the property that it was zoned\nsingle-family residential. Thus, plaintiff’s claim that the city’s refusal to rezone\nthe property will cause it to lose the money that it invested in the property is\nmeritless.\n       25\n          We note that the lower courts’ interpretation of the “substantial burden”\nprovision of RLUIPA would seem to render the “discrimination and exclusion”\nprovision of RLUIPA effectively meaningless because it will almost always be\neasier to prove a “substantial burden” on one’s “religious exercise,” as those terms\n                                                                      (continued…)\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\n\ffurtherance of a compelling governmental interest.           42 USC 2000cc-2(b).\n\nRLUIPA provides in pertinent part:\n\n               No government shall impose or implement a land use\n       regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the\n       religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or\n       institution, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of\n       the burden on that person, assembly, or institution--\n\n              (A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\n       interest . . . .

As the United States Supreme\n\nCourt has explained:\n\n             The matter of zoning has received much attention at the hands\n       of commissions and experts, and the results of their investigations\n\n\n                                         32\n\n\f      have been set forth in comprehensive reports. These reports, which\n      bear every evidence of painstaking consideration, concur in the view\n      that the segregation of residential, business, and industrial buildings\n      will make it easier to provide fire apparatus suitable for the character\n      and intensity of the development in each section; that it will increase\n      the safety and security of home life; greatly tend to prevent street\n      accidents, especially to children, by reducing the traffic and resulting\n      confusion in residential sections; decrease noise and other conditions\n      which produce or intensify nervous disorders; preserve a more\n      favorable environment in which to rear children, etc. With particular\n      reference to apartment houses, it is pointed out that the development\n      of detached house sections is greatly retarded by the coming of\n      apartment houses, which has sometimes resulted in destroying the\n      entire section for private house purposes; that in such sections very\n      often the apartment house is a mere parasite, constructed in order to\n      take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings\n      created by the residential character of the district. Moreover, the\n      coming of one apartment house is followed by others, interfering by\n      their height and bulk with the free circulation of air and\n      monopolizing the rays of the sun which otherwise would fall upon\n      the smaller homes, and bringing, as their necessary accompaniments,\n      the disturbing noises incident to increased traffic and business, and\n      the occupation, by means of moving and parked automobiles, of\n      larger portions of the streets, thus detracting from their safety and\n      depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open spaces for play,\n      enjoyed by those in more favored localities-- until, finally, the\n      residential character of the neighborhood and its desirability as a\n      place of detached residences are utterly destroyed. Under these\n      circumstances, apartment houses, which in a different environment\n      would be not only entirely unobjectionable but highly desirable,\n      come very near to being nuisances.

Charles Reisdorf, the Executive Director\n\nof the Regional Planning Commission, testified:\n\n               [I]n an area where you have a large number of single-family\n       residences, people have made purchases with the expectation that\n       there will be some stability in the neighborhood.

I can speak not only as a housing\n       professional, but from experiences.\n\n       Charles Aymond, who has served as the chairman of the Jackson Planning\n\nCommission for over ten years, testified:\n\n              [T]he City has experienced a great deal of blight and\n       destabilization as the result of commercial enterprises . . . or\n       different residential uses coming into what is generally referred to as\n       a higher residential use.\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\n\f       Plaintiff’s own architect, James Pappas, testified that if the property was\n\nrezoned multiple-family residential, as the plaintiff desires, a 45-foot apartment\n\ncomplex would be permitted and this would be “inappropriate with that\n\nneighborhood.”\n\n       Given the city’s general interest in zoning, and the city’s specific interest in\n\nmaintaining the character of this single-family residential neighborhood, we\n\nconclude that the city has a compelling interest in maintaining single-family\n\nresidential zoning and in not rezoning this area of the city.\n\n                        E. LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS\n\n       Given that the imposition of the burden on plaintiff is in furtherance of a\n\ncompelling governmental interest, the final question is whether a particular\n\ngovernmental action constitutes the “least restrictive” means of furthering that\n\ninterest. 42 USC 2000cc(a)(1)(B). The burden is on defendant to prove that an\n\naction constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling\n\ngovernmental interest. 42 USC 2000cc-2(b). RLUIPA provides in pertinent part:\n\n               No government shall impose or implement a land use\n       regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the\n       religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or\n       institution, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of\n       the burden on that person, assembly, or institution--\n\n              (A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest;\n       and\n\n             (B) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\n       governmental interest. [42 USC 2000cc(a)(1) (emphasis added).]\n\n\n\n\n                                          35\n\n\f       In the instant case, plaintiff asked the city to rezone the property from\n\nsingle-family residential to multiple-family residential. In response, the city could\n\nhave done one of two things-- it could have granted or it could have denied\n\nplaintiff’s request to rezone the property. The city decided to deny plaintiff’s\n\nrequest to rezone the property. That is, the city decided to maintain the single-\n\nfamily residential zoning. There do not appear to be any less restrictive means of\n\nmaintaining the single-family residential zoning.\n\n       For these reasons, we conclude that any burden placed on plaintiff’s\n\nexercise of religion is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and\n\nconstitutes the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental\n\ninterest.26 Therefore, even assuming that RLUIPA is applicable in the instant\n\ncase, it has not been violated.27\n\n\n\n       26\n           42 USC 1988(b) provides, “In any action or proceeding to enforce a\nprovision of . . . the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000\n. . . the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the\nUnited States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs . . . .” For the\nreasons discussed herein, plaintiff is not a “prevailing party,” and, therefore, is not\nentitled to attorney fees.\n       27\n          As discussed above, in City of Boerne, the United States Supreme Court\nheld that Congress, in enacting RFRA, had exceeded its power under § 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment to enact legislation enforcing the Free Exercise Clause\nbecause RFRA proscribes state conduct that the First Amendment itself does not.\nIn Smith, the United States Supreme Court held that generally applicable, religion-\nneutral laws that have the effect of burdening a particular religious practice need\nnot be justified under the Free Exercise Clause by a compelling governmental\ninterest. However, “where the State has in place a system of individual\nexemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of ‘religious hardship’\n                                                                      (continued…)\n\n                                          36\n\n\f                                V. CONCLUSION \n\n\n        RLUIPA applies to burdens imposed by governmental bodies on “religious\n\nexercises” in the course of implementing land use regulations under which\n\n“individualized assessments” may be made of the proposed uses for the land. An\n\n“individualized assessment” is an assessment based on one’s particular or specific\n\ncircumstances.    A decision concerning a request to rezone property does not\n\ninvolve an “individualized assessment.” Therefore, RLUIPA is not applicable\n\nhere.\n\n        A “religious exercise” constitutes “any exercise of religion, whether or not\n\ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 USC 2000cc-\n\n5(7)(A). However, something does not become a “religious exercise” just because\n\nit is carried out by a religious institution. Because the only connection between\n\nreligion and the construction of the apartment complex in this case is the fact that\n\n\n\n\n(…continued)\nwithout compelling reason.” Smith, supra at 884. Proponents of RLUIPA argue\nthat Congress has the authority to enact RLUIPA because it merely codifies Smith.\nHowever, the lower courts in the instant case held that, under RLUIPA, a religious\ninstitution need not abide by a generally applicable, religion-neutral zoning\nordinance unless it is justified by a compelling governmental interest. This seems\ninconsistent with the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in Smith, which, held that\na generally applicable, religion-neutral law does not have to be justified by such\nan interest. Whenever possible, courts should construe statutes in a manner that\nrenders them constitutional.

A mere inconvenience or irritation does\n\nnot constitute a “substantial burden”; similarly, something that simply makes it\n\nmore difficult in some respect to practice one’s religion does not constitute a\n\n“substantial burden.”     Because the city has not done anything to coerce plaintiff\n\ninto acting contrary to its religious beliefs, the city has not substantially burdened\n\nplaintiff’s religious exercise.\n\n       Even if the city did substantially burden plaintiff’s religious exercise,\n\nimposition of that burden here is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\n\ninterest, namely, the enforcement of local zoning ordinances, and constitutes the\n\nleast restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\n\nTherefore, even assuming that RLUIPA is applicable, RLUIPA was not violated.\n\nFor these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand\n\nthis case to the trial court for the entry of a judgment in favor of defendants.\n\n                                                   Stephen J. Markman\n                                                   Clifford W. Taylor\n                                                   Maura D. Corrigan\n                                                   Robert P. Young, Jr.\n\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\n\f                         STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n\n                                SUPREME COURT \n\n\nTHE GREATER BIBLE WAY TEMPLE OF\nJACKSON,\n\n       Plaintiff-Appellee,\n\nv                                                             Nos. 130194, 130196\n\nCITY OF JACKSON, JACKSON PLANNING\nCOMMISSION, AND JACKSON CITY COUNCIL,\n\n       Defendants-Appellants.\n\n______________________________\n\nCAVANAGH, J. (concurring).\n\n       I agree with part IV(B) of the majority opinion. I write separately because\n\nI believe it is unnecessary to determine whether defendants made an\n\nindividualized assessment in this case or whether the statutory test of strict\n\nscrutiny was met, because plaintiff failed to show that its petition for rezoning\n\nwas related to plaintiff’s exercise of religion. Thus, I would reverse the Court of\n\nAppeals judgment on that basis and remand to the trial court for dismissal of\n\nplaintiff’s claim.\n\n                                                 Michael F. Cavanagh\n                                                 Elizabeth A. Weaver\n\f                         STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n\n                                SUPREME COURT \n\n\nTHE GREATER BIBLE WAY TEMPLE OF\nJACKSON,\n\n       Plaintiff-Appellee,\n\nv                                                              Nos. 130194, 130196\n\nCITY OF JACKSON, JACKSON PLANNING\nCOMMISSION, AND JACKSON CITY COUNCIL,\n\n       Defendants-Appellants.\n\n________________________________\n\nKELLY, J. (concurring).\n\n       I agree with the order in which the majority opinion interprets the relevant\n\nprovisions of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 USC\n\n2000cc et seq. I concur in the majority’s holding that there was no individualized\n\nassessment in this case and therefore that RLUIPA is not applicable.\n\n       I write separately because I believe it is unnecessary to discuss (1) whether\n\nthe building of an apartment complex was a religious exercise, (2) whether the\n\nrefusal to rezone plaintiff’s property substantially burdened the alleged religious\n\nexercise, and (3) whether the alleged burden was in furtherance of a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest and constituted the least restrictive means of furthering that\n\ninterest. The majority’s discussion of these issues is mere dicta.\n\f       I would reverse the Court of Appeals judgment because RLUIPA is\n\ninapplicable in the instant case.\n\n                                         Marilyn Kelly\n\n\n\n\n                                    2\n\n\f</pre>",
