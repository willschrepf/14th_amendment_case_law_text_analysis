In each of the cases before us, the Appellate Division answered that question in the negative and reversed an adjudication of delinquency based upon a criminal contempt arising out of the juvenile's violation of a court order to \"obey the rules of home and school.\"</p>\n<p>We now affirm both Appellate Division judgments substantially for the reasons expressed in Judge Wecker's thorough and thoughtful opinion in <i>State of New Jersey </i><i>in the Interest of S.S.,</i> 367 <i>N.J.Super.</i> 400, 842 <i>A.</i>2d 904 (App.Div.2004).<sup>[1]</sup> Like the Appellate Division, we have concluded that, on the backdrop of the legislative goals underlying the criminal contempt statute and our juvenile justice scheme, it was \"error to subject a status offender... to an adjudication of delinquency based upon a repetition of the runaway conduct and truancy that brought her family to the court for help in the first place.\" <i>Id.</i> at 413, 842 <i>A</i>.2d at 913.</p>\n<p>Our ruling does not leave the juvenile family-in-crisis judge impotent. <i>N.J.S.A.</i> 2A:4A-86 specifically provides: \"In the case of failure of any person to comply with any orders entered pursuant to this section, the court may proceed against such person for the enforcement of litigants' rights.\" <i>See also R.</i> 5:17-3 (quoting statute verbatim). Pursuant to that authority, juvenile family-in-crisis judges have at their disposal civil proceedings under <i>Rule</i> 1:10-3 that include the remedy of incarceration so long as the commitment order specifies \"the terms of release.\" As that requirement underscores, incarceration in the civil context is a last resort intended to be primarily coercive. <i>Anyanwu v.
