He appeals the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to all defendants. We affirm.\n      Branum contends that the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment to the defendants on his claims that particular defendants were\ndeliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of serious harm posed to him by\nthe bench in the shower for the handicapped in Dorm 14 at the Jester III unit\n\n      *\n      Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion\nshould not be published and is not precedent except under the limited\ncircumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f                                  No. 05-20920\n\nof the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division\n(TDCJ-CID). We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo.\nGuillory v. Domtar Indus., Inc., 95 F.3d 1320, 1326 (5th Cir. 1996).\n      Branum asserts that the defendants should have known of the safety risk\nposed by the design of the shower bench and were possibly negligent, but he\nfailed to produce any evidence that the defendants had actual knowledge of any\nrisk of serious harm. As to prevail, Branum must prove that the defendants had\nsuch knowledge, the district court did not err by granting the motion for\nsummary judgment on these claims. See Adames v. Perez, 331 F.3d 508, 514 (5th\nCir. 2003).\n      Branum contends that the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment to the defendants on his claims based on deliberate indifference to\nserious medical needs relative to the use of latex catheters. He maintains that\nthe defendants’ expert’s affidavit should not have been considered by the district\ncourt, because the expert was not a urology specialist.         He also seeks a\npreliminary injunction from this court to require the defendants to provide him\nwith non-latex catheters in the future.\n      The district court properly considered the affidavit of the Defendant’s\nexpert, as an expert medical witness need not be a specialist for his opinions to\nbe considered. See Peteet v. Dow Chemical Co., 868 F.2d 1428, 1431-32 (5th Cir.\n1989). The evidence produced by Branum shows only that medical professionals\nhave differing opinions on the appropriate course of treatment for him. Absence\nof unanimity is not sufficient to show deliberate indifference to serious medical\nneeds. See Stewart v. Murphy, 174 F.3d 530, 535 (5th Cir. 1999).\n      The district court did not err in granting the motion for summary\njudgment on Branum’s claims relating to the latex catheters. As Branum cannot\nshow a likelihood of success on the merits of this issue, he is not entitled to a\npreliminary injunction. See Women’s Med. Ctr. v. Bell, 248 F.3d 411, 419 n.15\n(5th Cir. 2001).\n\n                                          2\n\f                                   No. 05-20920\n\n      Branum maintains that the district court erred by granting summary\njudgment to the defendants on the remainder of his claims based for deliberate\nindifference to his serious medical needs. He specifically contends that the\ndefendants demonstrated deliberate indifference by placing him in a segregated\ncell that was not wheelchair-accessible.\n      The evidence produced by Branum showed, at most, that he did not receive\ntreatment as frequently as he wanted and that some of his treatment may have\nbeen negligently given. This is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact for trial on deliberate indifference. See Varnado v. Lynaugh, 920\nF.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir. 1991); Domino v. Texas Dep’t of Criminal Justice, 239\nF.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir. 2001). It was at the initial screening stage of the case\nthat the district court dismissed as frivolous Branum’s claim regarding his\nsegregation cell, not at the summary judgment stage. As Branum had not\nalleged any specific reasons why the segregation cell caused a substantial risk\nto his safety or health, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndismissing this claim as legally frivolous. See Arnaud v. Odom, 870 F.2d 304,\n307 (5th Cir. 1989) (holding conclusional allegations insufficient to state a claim\nunder § 1983).\n      Branum insists that the defendants were not entitled to qualified\nimmunity or Eleventh Amendment immunity. As the district court did not base\nits ruling on either of those grounds, these arguments are moot.\n      Branum asserts that the district court abused its discretion when it denied\nhis requests for full discovery disclosures from the defendants. He maintains\nthat the district court violated his due process rights by granting summary\njudgment without first requiring full disclosures, implicitly challenging the\ndistrict court’s denial of his FED. R. CIV. P. 56(f) motion.\n      The discovery materials that Branum sought were (1) a TDCJ-CID policy\nregarding safety and the duties of some of the defendants, and (2) his medical\nrecords from January 2003 forward. None of the evidence for which Branum\n\n                                         3\n\f                                  No. 05-20920\n\nsought discovery would have created a genuine issue of material fact for trial.\nAccordingly, Branum has not shown that the district court abused its discretion\nby denying his discovery requests or his FED. R. CIV. P. 56(f) motion. See Moore\nv. Willis Indep. Sch. Dist., 233 F.3d 871, 876 (5th Cir. 2000); Washington v.\nAllstate Ins. Co., 901 F.2d 1281, 1285 (5th Cir. 1990).        Branum’s further\nargument that the district court abused its discretion in denying most of his\nmotions and granting all motions of the defendants does not identify a specific\nerror of the district court and is without merit. See Brinkmann v. Dallas County\nDeputy Sheriff Abner, 813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).\n      Branum asserts that the district court erred by dismissing some of his\nclaims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. For the first time on\nappeal, he insists that some of the defendants were medical professionals\nemployed by the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), not the TDCJ-\nCID, and that he had no administrative remedies that he could exhaust against\nthem. He additionally advances that he did exhaust his administrative remedies\nregarding all of his claims.\n      As Branum did not contend that he had no administrative remedies to\nexhaust against some of the defendants below, we review this issue for plain\nerror only. See Tilmon v. Prator, 368 F.3d 521, 524 (5th Cir. 2004). This issue\ninvolves factual questions that could have been resolved if Branum had raised\nthe issue in the district court as, for example, which entity employed which of\nthe defendants and whether Branum had administrative remedies that he might\nexhaust against UTMB employees. Thus, any error committed by the district\ncourt on this issue cannot have been plain. See Robertson v. Plano City of Texas,\n70 F.3d 21, 23 (5th Cir. 1995).\n      Branum did exhaust his administrative remedies regarding one claim\ndismissed by the district court, i.e., his claim that S. Levy, a nurse at the Pack\nI unit of the TDCJ-CID, refused to provide him with an egg crate mattress for\nhis back. Branum raised the same claim against Dr. Luke Scamardo, and the\n\n                                        4\n\f                                 No. 05-20920\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment on that claim. As there was no\nmeaningful difference between Branum’s claims against Levy and Dr. Scamardo\non this point, the dismissal of the claim against Levy was harmless. Branum\nconceded in the district court that he did not exhaust his administrative\nremedies regarding most of the remaining claims dismissed by the district court,\nand the record confirms that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies\nregarding any of the remaining claims dismissed by the district court.\nAccordingly, Branum has not shown that the district court reversibly erred by\ndismissing claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(a).\n      Branum asserts that the magistrate judge and district court violated his\ndue process rights when they denied two of his motions for leave to amend his\ncomplaint. We review the denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion. Ellis\nv. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 394 F.3d 262, 268 (5th Cir. 2004).\n      The first motion to amend, which was denied by the magistrate judge, was\ndenied early in the proceedings, and Branum was allowed to assert the claims\nraised in that proposed amendment in later amendments to his complaint.\nTherefore, any error in the initial denial was harmless. In the second motion for\nleave to amend that was denied, Branum sought to revive claims dismissed by\nthe district court on initial review.       Branum filed this motion after the\ndefendants had filed their motion for summary judgment, approximately eight\nmonths after the dismissal of the claims he sought to revive. Under these\ncircumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Branum\nleave to amend. See Overseas Inn S.A. P.A. v. United States, 911 F.2d 1146,\n1150-51 (5th Cir. 1990).\n      Branum advances that the magistrate judge and district court abused\ntheir discretion by denying his motions for appointment of counsel. He also\nseeks appointment of counsel on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f                                No. 05-20920\n\n      Even though Branum’s complaint asserted numerous claims against many\ndefendants, the case concerns matters that happened to Branum personally.\nThe record clearly demonstrates Branum’s ability to present his case. As such,\nneither the magistrate judge nor the district court abused their discretion in\ndenying Branum’s motions for appointment of counsel. See Cupit v. Jones, 835\nF.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir. 1987). As Branum has not demonstrated exceptional\ncircumstances or that appointment of counsel would substantially assist the\nresolution of this appeal, we deny his motion for appointment of counsel on\nappeal. See Santana v. Chandler, 961 F.2d 514, 515-16 (5th Cir. 1992).\n      AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION DENIED;\nMOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\f",

Dallas County\nDeputy Sheriff Abner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484679\"><a href=\"/opinion/484679/reginald-r-brinkmann-jr-v-dallas-county-deputy-sheriff-abner/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).\n      Branum asserts that the district court erred by dismissing some of his\nclaims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. For the first time on\nappeal, he insists that some of the defendants were medical professionals\nemployed by the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), not the TDCJ-\nCID, and that he had no administrative remedies that he could exhaust against\nthem. He additionally advances that he did exhaust his administrative remedies\nregarding all of his claims.\n      As Branum did not contend that he had no administrative remedies to\nexhaust against some of the defendants below, we review this issue for plain\nerror only. See Tilmon v. Prator, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"35249\"><a href=\"/opinion/35249/tilmon-v-prator/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524 (5th Cir. 2004). This issue\ninvolves factual questions that could have been resolved if Branum had raised\nthe issue in the district court as, for example, which entity employed which of\nthe defendants and whether Branum had administrative remedies that he might\nexhaust against UTMB employees. Thus, any error committed by the district\ncourt on this issue cannot have been plain. See Robertson v. Plano City of Texas,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8099\"><a href=\"/opinion/8099/robertson-v-plano-city-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (5th Cir. 1995).\n      Branum did exhaust his administrative remedies regarding one claim\ndismissed by the district court, i.e., his claim that S. Levy, a nurse at the Pack\nI unit of the TDCJ-CID, refused to provide him with an egg crate mattress for\nhis back. Branum raised the same claim against Dr. Luke Scamardo, and the\n\n                                        4\n\f                                 No. 05-20920\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment on that claim. As there was no\nmeaningful difference between Branum’s claims against Levy and Dr. Scamardo\non this point, the dismissal of the claim against Levy was harmless. Branum\nconceded in the district court that he did not exhaust his administrative\nremedies regarding most of the remaining claims dismissed by the district court,\nand the record confirms that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies\nregarding any of the remaining claims dismissed by the district court.\nAccordingly, Branum has not shown that the district court reversibly erred by\ndismissing claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(a).\n      Branum asserts that the magistrate judge and district court violated his\ndue process rights when they denied two of his motions for leave to amend his\ncomplaint. We review the denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion. Ellis\nv. Liberty Life Assurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 268 (5th Cir. 2004).\n      The first motion to amend, which was denied by the magistrate judge, was\ndenied early in the proceedings, and Branum was allowed to assert the claims\nraised in that proposed amendment in later amendments to his complaint.\nTherefore, any error in the initial denial was harmless. In the second motion for\nleave to amend that was denied, Branum sought to revive claims dismissed by\nthe district court on initial review.       Branum filed this motion after the\ndefendants had filed their motion for summary judgment, approximately eight\nmonths after the dismissal of the claims he sought to revive. Under these\ncircumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Branum\nleave to amend. See Overseas Inn S.A. P.A. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546933\"><a href=\"/opinion/546933/overseas-inns-sa-pa-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1150-51 (5th Cir. 1990).\n      Branum advances that the magistrate judge and district court abused\ntheir discretion by denying his motions for appointment of counsel. He also\nseeks appointment of counsel on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f                                No. 05-20920\n\n      Even though Branum’s complaint asserted numerous claims against many\ndefendants, the case concerns matters that happened to Branum personally.\nThe record clearly demonstrates Branum’s ability to present his case. As such,\nneither the magistrate judge nor the district court abused their discretion in\ndenying Branum’s motions for appointment of counsel. See Cupit v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498455\"><a href=\"/opinion/498455/milton-eugene-cupit-v-james-sonny-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86 (5th Cir. 1987). As Branum has not demonstrated exceptional\ncircumstances or that appointment of counsel would substantially assist the\nresolution of this appeal, we deny his motion for appointment of counsel on\nappeal. See Santana v. Chandler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581395\"><a href=\"/opinion/581395/celedonio-santana-v-ronald-chandler-district-director-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515-16 (5th Cir. 1992).\n      AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION DENIED;\nMOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\f</pre>",
