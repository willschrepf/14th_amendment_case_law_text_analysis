Russell, Presiding Judge\n           ___________________________________________________\n\nTO THE TWELFTH COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      Appellant East Texas Medical Center d/b/a East Texas Medical Center\n\nEmergency Medical Services, Defendant in Cause No. 13-0984-A in the\n\n7th Judicial District Court of Smith County, Texas, Honorable Kerry L. Russell\n\npresiding, respectfully submits its Reply Brief on the Merits.    Appellees are\n\nJody Delaune, Individually and as Personal Representative of the Estate of\n\n\n\n                                       1\n\fCrystal Delaune, Deceased; and as Next Friend of D.D., D.D. and DA.D., Plaintiffs\n\nin the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\f                                  REPLY ARGUMENT\n\nI.    NECESSARY UNDERLYING “ACTIONABLE TORT” IS ABSENT:\n\n      Appellees do not dispute – and cannot dispute – that their sole claim against\n\nETMC is for an alleged failure to train Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers on the use of\n\nrestraint in patients like Ms. Delaune (See, Appellant’s Brief on the Merits,\n\npages 6-7).\n\n      A.      Lacroix Is Not Relevant or Applicable:\n\n      Appellees argue that Denton Regional Medical Center v. Lacroix,\n\n947 S.W.2d 941 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1997, pet. dism’d by agmt.) is applicable\n\nand supports their contention the existence of an actionable tort by Ms. Moore or\n\nMs. Spurgers is not an essential element of their failure to train claim (Brief of\n\nAppellees, pages 7-8). Lacroix is not relevant or applicable to this appeal because\n\nit does not involve the failure to train, or some other dependent tort. Id. at 949-50.\n\n      B.      Existence Of An Actionable Tort Is An Essential Element Of\n              Appellees’ Failure To Train Claim:\n\n      Appellees’ contention that dependent torts only require that a “recognized\n\ninjury” was suffered as a direct result of an employer’s conduct and that an\n\n“actionable tort” by the employee(s) is not required is flat wrong (See, Brief of\n\nAppellees, page 10).       The applicable case law clearly and unequivocally\n\nestablishes that in order to prevail on a dependent tort like Appellees’ failure to\n\ntrain claim against ETMC, claimant must show the employee(s) in question\n\n                                          3\n\fcommitted an “actionable tort.” See, Zidell v. Morris, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n264432 *23-24 (N.D. Tex. 2013)(to prevail on claim of negligent training, plaintiff\n\nmust “establish…that the employee committed an actionable tort…”)(applying\n\nTexas law)(emphasis added); Latimer v. Memorial Hermann Hosp. Sys., 2011 Tex.\n\nApp. LEXIS 423 *10 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.])(Jan. 20, 2011)(no\n\npet.)(mem. op.)(No negligent supervision claim against Hermann Hospital because\n\n“there is no separate actionable tort [by the hospital’s employee] to support the\n\nnegligent supervision claim”)(emphasis added); Gonzales v. Willis, 995 S.W.2d\n\n729, 740 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1999, overruled in part, on o.g., Hoffman-\n\nLaRoche, Inc. v. Zeltwanger, 144 S.W.3d 438, 447-48 (Tex. 2004)(“Because\n\n[plaintiff] failed to establish [the employee] committed an actionable tort, her\n\nnegligence claims [negligent hiring, retention, training and supervision] are\n\nprecluded as a matter of law.”)(emphasis added)\n\n      In fact, authority cited by Appellees in their brief recognizes that if\n\nMs. Moore or Ms. Spurgers did not commit an actionable tort on the occasion in\n\nquestion, Appellees have not been injured in the eyes of the law and there is no\n\nproximate cause because ETMC’s alleged failure to train did not cause Appellees a\n\nlegally compensable injury (See, Brief of Appellees, page 10 (quoting Edgar Sales,\n\nTexas Torts & Remedies, §4.01[4][d], at pages 4-10)).            Accordingly, the\n\ncommission of an actionable tort by Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers is an essential\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\felement of Appellees’ failure to train claim against ETMC.        If the essential\n\nactionable tort element is absent, there is no proximate cause because ETMC’s\n\nalleged failure to train Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers did not cause Appellees to\n\nsuffer a legally compensable injury.         Put another way, if Ms. Moore or\n\nMs. Spurgers did not cause or inflict a legally compensable injury on Appellees,\n\nETMC’s alleged failure to train Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers cannot be a proximate\n\ncause of any injury to Appellees.\n\n      Appellees sued Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers for negligence in caring for\n\nMs. Delaune (CR 6; 1 CR 10). On July 29, 2014, the trial court dismissed with\n\nprejudice Appellees’ negligence claims against Ms. Spurgers and Ms. Moore\n\n(CR 365, 2 CR 119). Thus, on July 29, 2014, the trial court determined as a matter\n\nof law that Ms. Spurgers and Ms. Moore did not commit an actionable tort in\n\nconnection with their care and treatment of Ms. Delaune (CR 365-66; 2 CR 119-\n\n20). As such, Appellees could not (and cannot) establish that essential element of\n\ntheir failure to train claim against ETMC.\n\n      Appellees argue that because their negligence claim against Ms. Spurgers’\n\nand Ms. Moore is judged under Texas law by a willful and wanton standard and\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers were not “absolved of ordinary negligence,” this is\n\nsomehow relevant to or excuses Appellees’ inability to (and failure to) establish\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers committed an actionable tort (See, Brief of\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fAppellees, page 13). Appellees’ argument is flawed because a dependent tort like\n\nnegligent hiring is not dependent on the “ordinary negligence” of an employee; it is\n\ndependent on the commission of an “actionable tort” by an employee. The bottom\n\nline is that if Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers did not commit an actionable tort, for\n\nwhatever reason, Appellees cannot recover from ETMC for negligent training.\n\nZidell v. Morris, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26432 (N.D. Tex. 2013), illustrates this\n\npoint.\n\n         In Zidell, plaintiff alleged that two Bureau of Prison employees, Morris and\n\nBrown, assaulted him and that the United States was liable to him for the negligent\n\nhiring, training, retention and supervision of Morris and Brown. Id. at *1-2, *21,\n\n*23-24. The court held that the actions of Morris and Brown fell within an\n\nimmunity privilege provided under the TEXAS PENAL CODE and, therefore, Morris\n\nand Brown did not commit an actionable tort against plaintiff. Id. at *22-24.\n\n         The court then discussed that for plaintiff to prevail on his claim of negligent\n\nhiring, training, retention and supervision, “the employee must have committed an\n\nactionable tort against the plaintiff.” Id. at *24 (emphasis added). The court then\n\nstated, “[h]ere, the court has determined that Morris and Brown committed no tort\n\nagainst plaintiff.     Accordingly, plaintiff’s claim of negligent hiring, training,\n\nretention, and supervision fails as well.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f      Zidell directly addresses and rebuts Appellees’ argument that because Texas\n\nlaw places a higher burden of proof on Appellees’ negligence claim against\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers (or effectively makes them immune from suit as\n\nargued by Appellees), the trial court’s dismissal of their negligence claim against\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers does not bar their ability to recover from ETMC\n\n(Brief of Appellees, page 11).       Zidell shows that because Ms. Moore and\n\nMs. Spurgers did not commit an actionable tort as a matter of law, Appellees\n\ncannot establish a failure to train claim against ETMC. Id.\n\n      Appellees’ argument that the Texas Supreme Court’s holding in Cash\n\nAmerica International, Inc. v. Bennett, 35 S.W.3d 12 (Tex. 2000) is relevant and\n\napplicable is also erroneous.     Appellees cite Cash America International as\n\nstanding for the propositions (1) that abrogation of a common law cause of action\n\nby reason of statutory enactment is disfavored, (2) that the existence of statutory\n\ndamage-immunity cannot prevent an actionable tort from occurring, and (3) that\n\nany statutory tightening of Appellees’ right-to-recover against Ms. Moore and\n\nMs. Spurgers would abrogate a common law right to recover from ETMC (Brief of\n\nAppellees, pages 7, 11, 12). Specifically, Appellees cite to page 16 of the Cash\n\nAmerica International opinion as where the Texas Supreme Court makes these\n\nholdings and rulings. While it is true that Cash America International stands for\n\nthe first proposition – that Texas law disfavors a statute that deprives a person of a\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fcommon law right – Cash America International does not stand for the second and\n\nthird propositions. Id. at 16.\n\n      Cash America International has no relevance or application to this matter\n\nbecause there is no abrogation or deprivation of a common law right by statute\n\nhere. Section 75.152 of the TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE & REMEDIES CODE does not\n\nabrogate or deprive any claimant of a common law right to sue for negligence, as\n\nclaimed by Appellees. It simply places a different legal standard of care on\n\nemergency medical services providers in certain circumstances.      See, Dill v.\n\nFowler, 255 S.W.3d 681, 683 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2008, no pet.)(citing Jackson\n\nv. Axelrad, 221 S.W.3d 650, 655 (Tex. 2007))(interpreting similar willful and\n\nwanton standard of proof applicable to emergency room services under Section\n\n74.153 of the TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE & REMEDIES CODE). Thus, what is at issue is\n\na different applicable standard of proof, not the abrogation or deprivation of a\n\ncommon law right. See, Nowzaradan v. Ryans, 347 S.W.3d 734, 741-42 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.)(interpreting similar willful and wanton\n\nstandard of proof applicable to emergency room services under Section 74.153 of\n\nthe TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE & REMEDIES CODE).\n\n      One cannot dispute with any degree of credibility that under Texas law a\n\ndependent tort like Appellees’ negligent training claim against ETMC is dependent\n\non Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers committing an “actionable tort.” On July 29, 2014,\n\n\n\n                                       8\n\fthe trial court determined that as a matter of law neither Ms. Moore nor\n\nMs. Spurgers committed an actionable tort. For this reason, Appellees could not\n\nestablish that essential element of their negligent training claim against ETMC.\n\n      Just as important is Appellees’ failure to prove and secure a finding at trial\n\nthat Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers were negligent (committed an actionable tort) on\n\nthe occasion in question. In fact, Appellees failed to provide any evidence at trial\n\nwould or could support a finding that Ms. Moore’s or Ms. Spurgers’ actions\n\nconstituted even ordinary negligence. In order to prevail on their dependent tort\n\nfailure to train claim, Appellees had to prove at trial that Ms. Moore or\n\nMs. Spurgers committed an actionable tort in connection with their care and\n\ntreatment of Ms. Delaune.      See, Brown v. Swett & Crawford of Texas, Inc.,\n\n178 S.W.3d 373, 384 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, no pet.)(holding that\n\nto recover on a negligent supervision claim, a plaintiff must prove that the\n\nemployee committed an actionable tort); Gonzales, 995 S.W.2d at 740 (“Because\n\n[plaintiff] failed to establish [the employee] committed an actionable tort, her\n\nnegligence claims [negligent hiring, retention, training and supervision] are\n\nprecluded as a matter of law.”)(emphasis added).\n\n      Wholly absent from the appellate record is any finding or stipulation that\n\nMs. Moore’s or Ms. Spurgers’ actions were negligent. Also wholly absent from\n\nthe record is any evidence of either the standard of care applicable to an emergency\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\fmedical technician or paramedic like Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers in treating\n\nsomeone like Ms. Delaune on the occasion in question, or a breach of the standard\n\nof care applicable to an emergency medical technician or paramedic in treating a\n\npatient like Ms. Delaune on the occasion in question. Thus, even if an ordinary\n\nnegligence standard applies, – which it does not – Appellees still failed to establish\n\nthe commission of an actionable tort by Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers (or to provide\n\nany evidence upon which such a finding could have been made), an essential\n\nelement of their failure to train claim against ETMC.\n\n      For the above reasons, there is no evidence of an essential element\n\n(proximate cause) of Appellees’ failure to train claim against ETMC. Accordingly,\n\nthe Tyler Court of Appeals should reverse the trial court’s December 23, 2014\n\nFinal Judgment against ETMC and in favor of Appellees and enter a take nothing\n\njudgment in favor of ETMC and against Appellees.\n\nII.   APPELLEES FAIL TO REBUT ETMC’S SUPPORTIVE\n      AUTHORITY THAT THERE IS LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT\n      EVIDENCE OF THE APPLICABLE STANDARD OF CARE AND\n      BREACH BY ETMC:\n\n      In its Brief on the Merits, ETMC cited case law that specifically addresses\n\nand shows the defects in and legal insufficiency of Appellees’ trial evidence on the\n\nstandard of care applicable to ETMC and a breach of that standard of care by\n\nETMC (Appellant’s Brief on the Merits, pages 39-43). Appellees do not cite or\n\nreference these cases even once in their brief. Appellees also failed to provide this\n\n                                         10\n\fCourt any authority that establishes or supports their claim the evidence presented\n\nat trial is legally sufficient evidence of the applicable standard of care and a breach\n\nof that standard by ETMC.\n\n      The only authority cited by Appellees on this issue are Durham\n\nTransportation Inc. v. Valero, 897 S.W.2d 404 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1995,\n\nwrit denied); Greater Houston Transportation v. Zrubeck, 850 S.W.2d 579 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1993, writ denied); and Ching v. Methodist Children’s\n\nHospital, 134 S.W.3d 235 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2003, pet. denied). Not one of\n\nthese cases shows that the evidence Appellees produced at trial was sufficient to\n\nestablish the standard of care applicable to ETMC in training personnel like\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers and a breach of this standard of care.\n\n      Durham Transportation, Inc. v. Valero, involves a claim that Perez, a school\n\nbus driver, was not properly trained and supervised. Durham Transportation,\n\n897 S.W.2d at 411. Testimony by a former associate of Perez, Briseno, stated how\n\nand why Perez was improperly trained to drive a school bus. Specifically, Briseno\n\ntestified Perez was not given the required hours of classroom instruction, and was\n\nnot observed driving for the required number of hours before he was allowed to\n\ndrive children. Id. at 411. The evidence also showed that time cards related to\n\ndriver training were falsified, and that Perez was not certified by the Texas\n\nEducation Association as a school bus driver. Id. at 413.\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      Greater Houston Transportation Co. v. Zrubeck, involved a bus driver’s\n\nfailure to secure a wheelchair rider to his wheelchair with a seat belt. Zrubeck,\n\n850 S.W.2d at 581. In Zrubeck, there was evidence that the driver’s employer\n\n“never instructed [the driver] with regard to proper procedures for these\n\npassengers.” Id. at 591. The driver in question also admitted that she and other\n\ndrivers regularly allowed wheelchair passengers to ride without seatbelts. Id. at\n\n592. Finally, the evidence established that the driver in question was not aware of\n\nthe employer’s safety handbook or mandatory seat belt policy until after the\n\nincident. Id.\n\n      At trial in this matter, Appellees did not provide any evidence about\n\nMs. Moore or Ms. Spurgers even remotely similar to the evidence presented in\n\nDurham Transportation and Zrubeck.            Appellees provided no evidence that\n\nMs. Moore or Ms. Spurgers were improperly trained because they were not given\n\nthe required hours of classroom instruction, that they did not demonstrate their\n\nclinical competence before ETMC allowed them to work in one of its ambulances,\n\nthat they were not certified to provide emergency medical services, that they were\n\nnot instructed on the use of restraints, that they regularly did not use restraints\n\nwhen indicated, or that they were not aware of or given the ETMC policy on the\n\nuse of restraint before they cared for Ms. Delaune.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f      In fact, the evidence at trial established just the opposite. It was undisputed\n\nat trial that by the time Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers cared for Ms. Delaune they\n\nhad gone through paramedic school, they had been trained and educated on the use\n\nof restraints before working with ETMC and while working at ETMC, they were\n\ncertified paramedics, they had demonstrated their competence through testing to\n\nobtain and maintain their certifications and by testing at ETMC, that ETMC had a\n\npolicy on the use of restraints they were aware of, that ETMC had specifically\n\ntaught Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers on the use of restraint, and that ETMC’s\n\neducational program for training personnel like Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers\n\nfollowed the standardized national training curriculum (See, Appellant’s Brief on\n\nthe Merits, pages 10-14). Thus, in no way is the evidence here in any way, shape,\n\nor form similar to the evidence presented in Durham Transportation and Zrubeck.\n\nIf anything, Durham Transportation and Zrubeck illustrate and show the deficient\n\nnature of Appellees’ evidence.\n\n      Ching v. Methodist Children’s Hospital, has nothing whatsoever to do with\n\nwhether or not the evidence produced at trial by Appellees was legally sufficient to\n\nestablish either the standard of care applicable to ETMC in training personnel like\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers or a breach of that standard of care by ETMC in\n\ntraining personnel like Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers. On page 241 of Ching, the\n\npage cited by Appellees in their brief (Brief of Appellees, pages 30 and 31), the\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fAmarillo Court of Appeals only mentions the fact that a hospital has a common\n\nlaw duty to periodically monitor and review the competency of its medical staff.\n\nChing, 134 S.W.3d at 241. Absent from Ching is any information that describes\n\nfactually what a hospital would be required to do to discharge this duty or what\n\nwould constitute legally sufficient evidence of the applicable standard of care\n\nrelated to that duty or a breach of that duty.\n\n      This brings up a final point on this authority cited by Appellees. Contrary to\n\nAppellees’ claim in their brief, at no place on page 413 of Durham Transportation,\n\npages 591-92 of Zrubreck, or page 241 of Ching – or elsewhere in these opinions\n\nfor that matter – does the Corpus Christi Court of Appeals or the Amarillo Court of\n\nAppeals hold or state that “[t]he efficacy of a hospital’s implementation and\n\nenforcement of its policies must be measured by how well it succeeds in preparing\n\nits personnel to respond to known hazards, and not by how comprehensive the\n\nsyllabus appears on paper” (Brief of Appellees, page 31). In fact, nothing even\n\nremotely close to this is stated or held by the Corpus Christi Court of Appeals or\n\nthe Amarillo Court of Appeals in these opinions. This statement in Appellees’\n\nbrief is nothing more than the argument of counsel. This statement does not\n\nrepresent the binding or persuasive opinion of any court.\n\n      For these reasons, Appellees’ authority fails to establish or support a claim\n\nthat the evidence presented at trial was legally sufficient to establish the standard\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fof care applicable to ETMC, a breach of that standard of care by ETMC, or that\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers were not properly trained.\n\n   III.   ETMC’S CASE LAW SHOWS APPELLEES’ STANDARD OF\n          CARE AND BREACH EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT:\n\n      The Mackey v. U.P. Enterprises, Inc., 935 S.W.3d 446 (Tex. App.—Tyler\n\n1996, no pet.); Patino v. Complete Tire, Inc., 158 S.W.3d 655 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2005, pet. denied); and Allsup’s Convenience Stores, Inc. v. Warren, 934 S.W.2d\n\n433 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1996, writ denied) opinions cited and discussed in\n\nETMC’s Brief on the Merits are pertinent, relevant and on point because they each\n\ndirectly address the specific evidence that a claimant like Appellees must produce\n\nto establish a failure to train (Appellant’s Brief on the Merits, pages 41-43).\n\n      The take-home points from Mackey, Patino, and Allsup’s are (1) Appellees\n\ndid not controvert ETMC’s specific factual evidence showing the sufficiency of its\n\ntraining of Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers, (2) Appellees had to provide specific\n\nfactual evidence of training that ETMC negligently failed to provide, and (3)\n\nAppellees had to present specific factual evidence showing the training ETMC\n\nshould have provided to Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers, but did not provide\n\n(Appellant’s Brief on the Merits, pages 41-43). Copies of the Mackey, Patino, and\n\nAllsup’s opinions are attached to this brief (See, Appendix A, B and C,\n\nrespectively). As shown by ETMC in its earlier brief, Appellees’ “evidence” on\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\fthese issues is legally insufficient primarily because it is conclusory in nature\n\n(Appellant’s Brief on the Merits, pages 26-39).\n\n      Lermon v. Minyard Food Stores, Inc., 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 12498 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas)(Nov. 19, 2014)(pet. denied)(mem. op.)(Appendix D) further shows\n\nthat Appellees did not present legally sufficient evidence of the standard of care\n\napplicable to ETMC or a breach of that standard of care.\n\n      In Lermon, claimant sued Minyard for malicious prosecution.          Lermon\n\nasserted Minyard was negligent in hiring, retaining, training and supervising an\n\nemployee, Rodney Lee. Id. at *23. Specifically, Lermon claimed Minyard did not\n\nadequately train Mr. Lee to perform the duties he was performing when he\n\ninvestigated a theft Lermon was claimed to have committed. Id. at *23. A jury\n\nverdict was entered in favor of Lermon and against Minyard. An appeal followed.\n\n      The Dallas Court of Appeals discussed that to support a claim for negligent\n\ntraining and supervision “a plaintiff must prove that a reasonably prudent employer\n\nwould have provided training and supervision beyond that which was given…” Id.\n\nat *25.   More specifically, the Dallas Court of Appeals required plaintiff to\n\nproduce evidence of the specific training an employer exercising ordinary\n\nprudence would provide to its employees. Id. at *28. Because Lermon failed to\n\npresent specific evidence of what additional training was available and commonly\n\nused, but was not provided, the Dallas Court of Appeals found that Lermon had\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\ffailed to establish a negligent training claim against Minyard and it reversed the\n\njury verdict and trial court judgment in favor of Lerman and against Minyard. Id.\n\nat *28-29.\n\n      As in Lerman, the evidence here establishes that Ms. Moore and\n\nMs. Spurgers had pre-existing training and experience on the use of restraint. See,\n\nid. at *27-28. As in Lerman, there is no evidence that prior to the incident that\n\ninvolved Ms. Delaune there was any basis from which a reasonable employer\n\ncould conclude that Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers were unfit or unqualified to\n\nperform their job duties. See, id. at *29. As in Lerman, Appellees failed to present\n\nany evidence of additional training available or commonly used by employers like\n\nETMC that was not used in training Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers. See, id. at *28.\n\nAs in Lerman, Appellees failed to present any evidence that there was some\n\ntraining available to employers like ETMC that was superior to the training ETMC\n\nprovided. See, id. Finally and most important, as in Lerman, Appellees presented\n\nno evidence about what additional or different training an employer like ETMC\n\nshould have provided, but failed to provide. See, id.\n\n      The fact of the matter is that Appellees did not and could not produce\n\nevidence of this nature at trial because, as admitted by Appellees’ expert\n\nDr. Wayne, ETMC’s training program tracked what is required by the national\n\nregistry for emergency medical services provider certification (3 RR 11-19). For\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fthese reasons, as established and illustrated by Lerman, Appellees “failed to\n\nproduce any evidence a reasonably prudent employer would have provided training\n\n… to [Moore and Spurgers] beyond that which [ETMC] provided,” and, thus,\n\n“failed to show [ETMC] was negligent.” See, id. at *29. As such, the Tyler Court\n\nof Appeals should reverse the trial court’s judgment in favor of Appellees and\n\nenter judgment that Appellees take nothing.\n\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\f                                  CONCLUSION\n\n        Here is where things stand prior to the submission of this matter for\n\ndetermination by the Court – with or without oral argument.\n\n        First, Appellees’ only claim against ETMC is for its alleged failure to train\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers on the use of restraint.\n\n        Second, under Texas law, Appellees’ failure to train claim is a dependent\n\ntort.\n\n        Third, in order to prevail on a dependent tort claim, Appellees had to\n\nestablish that one of ETMC’s employees, Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers, committed\n\nan actionable tort on the occasion in question.\n\n        Fourth, the trial court determined as a matter of law that Ms. Moore and\n\nMs. Spurgers did not commit an actionable tort on the occasion in question.\n\n        Fifth, at trial Appellees had to produce legally sufficient evidence of the\n\nstandard of care applicable to ETMC in training employees like Ms. Moore and\n\nMs. Spurgers on the use of restraint and a breach of that standard of care by\n\nETMC.\n\n        Sixth, Appellees’ evidence does not state what specific training a reasonably\n\nprudent emergency medical services provider like ETMC should provide to\n\nemployees like Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers.\n\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\f      Seventh, Appellees’ evidence does not state what specific training a\n\nreasonably prudent emergency medical services provider like ETMC should\n\nprovide to employees like Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers, but was not provided to\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers by ETMC.\n\n      For these reasons, Appellees’ evidence of the applicable standard of care,\n\nbreach of that standard of care and proximate cause on their claim against ETMC\n\nis legally insufficient.

Existence Of An Actionable Tort Is An Essential Element Of\n              Appellees’ Failure To Train Claim:\n\n      Appellees’ contention that dependent torts only require that a “recognized\n\ninjury” was suffered as a direct result of an employer’s conduct and that an\n\n“actionable tort” by the employee(s) is not required is flat wrong (See, Brief of\n\nAppellees, page 10).       The applicable case law clearly and unequivocally\n\nestablishes that in order to prevail on a dependent tort like Appellees’ failure to\n\ntrain claim against ETMC, claimant must show the employee(s) in question\n\n                                          3\n\fcommitted an “actionable tort.” See, Zidell v.

Accordingly, the\n\ncommission of an actionable tort by Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers is an essential\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\felement of Appellees’ failure to train claim against ETMC.        If the essential\n\nactionable tort element is absent, there is no proximate cause because ETMC’s\n\nalleged failure to train Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers did not cause Appellees to\n\nsuffer a legally compensable injury.         Put another way, if Ms. Moore or\n\nMs. Spurgers did not cause or inflict a legally compensable injury on Appellees,\n\nETMC’s alleged failure to train Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers cannot be a proximate\n\ncause of any injury to Appellees.\n\n      Appellees sued Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers for negligence in caring for\n\nMs. Delaune (CR 6; 1 CR 10). On July 29, 2014, the trial court dismissed with\n\nprejudice Appellees’ negligence claims against Ms. Spurgers and Ms. Moore\n\n(CR 365, 2 CR 119). Thus, on July 29, 2014, the trial court determined as a matter\n\nof law that Ms. Spurgers and Ms. Moore did not commit an actionable tort in\n\nconnection with their care and treatment of Ms. Delaune (CR 365-66; 2 CR 119-\n\n20). As such, Appellees could not (and cannot) establish that essential element of\n\ntheir failure to train claim against ETMC.\n\n      Appellees argue that because their negligence claim against Ms. Spurgers’\n\nand Ms. Moore is judged under Texas law by a willful and wanton standard and\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers were not “absolved of ordinary negligence,” this is\n\nsomehow relevant to or excuses Appellees’ inability to (and failure to) establish\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers committed an actionable tort (See, Brief of\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fAppellees, page 13). Appellees’ argument is flawed because a dependent tort like\n\nnegligent hiring is not dependent on the “ordinary negligence” of an employee; it is\n\ndependent on the commission of an “actionable tort” by an employee. The bottom\n\nline is that if Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers did not commit an actionable tort, for\n\nwhatever reason, Appellees cannot recover from ETMC for negligent training.\n\nZidell v.

Tex. 2013), illustrates this\n\npoint.\n\n         In Zidell, plaintiff alleged that two Bureau of Prison employees, Morris and\n\nBrown, assaulted him and that the United States was liable to him for the negligent\n\nhiring, training, retention and supervision of Morris and Brown. Id. at *1-2, *21,\n\n*23-24. The court held that the actions of Morris and Brown fell within an\n\nimmunity privilege provided under the TEXAS PENAL CODE and, therefore, Morris\n\nand Brown did not commit an actionable tort against plaintiff. Id. at *22-24.\n\n         The court then discussed that for plaintiff to prevail on his claim of negligent\n\nhiring, training, retention and supervision, “the employee must have committed an\n\nactionable tort against the plaintiff.” Id. at *24 (emphasis added). The court then\n\nstated, “[h]ere, the court has determined that Morris and Brown committed no tort\n\nagainst plaintiff.     Accordingly, plaintiff’s claim of negligent hiring, training,\n\nretention, and supervision fails as well.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f      Zidell directly addresses and rebuts Appellees’ argument that because Texas\n\nlaw places a higher burden of proof on Appellees’ negligence claim against\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers (or effectively makes them immune from suit as\n\nargued by Appellees), the trial court’s dismissal of their negligence claim against\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers does not bar their ability to recover from ETMC\n\n(Brief of Appellees, page 11).       Zidell shows that because Ms. Moore and\n\nMs. Spurgers did not commit an actionable tort as a matter of law, Appellees\n\ncannot establish a failure to train claim against ETMC.

Appellees cite Cash America International as\n\nstanding for the propositions (1) that abrogation of a common law cause of action\n\nby reason of statutory enactment is disfavored, (2) that the existence of statutory\n\ndamage-immunity cannot prevent an actionable tort from occurring, and (3) that\n\nany statutory tightening of Appellees’ right-to-recover against Ms. Moore and\n\nMs. Spurgers would abrogate a common law right to recover from ETMC (Brief of\n\nAppellees, pages 7, 11, 12). Specifically, Appellees cite to page 16 of the Cash\n\nAmerica International opinion as where the Texas Supreme Court makes these\n\nholdings and rulings. While it is true that Cash America International stands for\n\nthe first proposition – that Texas law disfavors a statute that deprives a person of a\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fcommon law right – Cash America International does not stand for the second and\n\nthird propositions. Id. at 16.\n\n      Cash America International has no relevance or application to this matter\n\nbecause there is no abrogation or deprivation of a common law right by statute\n\nhere. Section 75.152 of the TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE & REMEDIES CODE does not\n\nabrogate or deprive any claimant of a common law right to sue for negligence, as\n\nclaimed by Appellees.

Not one of\n\nthese cases shows that the evidence Appellees produced at trial was sufficient to\n\nestablish the standard of care applicable to ETMC in training personnel like\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers and a breach of this standard of care.\n\n      Durham Transportation, Inc. v. Valero, involves a claim that Perez, a school\n\nbus driver, was not properly trained and supervised. Durham Transportation,\n\n897 S.W.2d at 411. Testimony by a former associate of Perez, Briseno, stated how\n\nand why Perez was improperly trained to drive a school bus. Specifically, Briseno\n\ntestified Perez was not given the required hours of classroom instruction, and was\n\nnot observed driving for the required number of hours before he was allowed to\n\ndrive children. Id. at 411. The evidence also showed that time cards related to\n\ndriver training were falsified, and that Perez was not certified by the Texas\n\nEducation Association as a school bus driver. Id. at 413.\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      Greater Houston Transportation Co. v. Zrubeck, involved a bus driver’s\n\nfailure to secure a wheelchair rider to his wheelchair with a seat belt. Zrubeck,\n\n850 S.W.2d at 581. In Zrubeck, there was evidence that the driver’s employer\n\n“never instructed [the driver] with regard to proper procedures for these\n\npassengers.” Id. at 591. The driver in question also admitted that she and other\n\ndrivers regularly allowed wheelchair passengers to ride without seatbelts. Id. at\n\n592. Finally, the evidence established that the driver in question was not aware of\n\nthe employer’s safety handbook or mandatory seat belt policy until after the\n\nincident. Id.\n\n      At trial in this matter, Appellees did not provide any evidence about\n\nMs. Moore or Ms. Spurgers even remotely similar to the evidence presented in\n\nDurham Transportation and Zrubeck.            Appellees provided no evidence that\n\nMs. Moore or Ms. Spurgers were improperly trained because they were not given\n\nthe required hours of classroom instruction, that they did not demonstrate their\n\nclinical competence before ETMC allowed them to work in one of its ambulances,\n\nthat they were not certified to provide emergency medical services, that they were\n\nnot instructed on the use of restraints, that they regularly did not use restraints\n\nwhen indicated, or that they were not aware of or given the ETMC policy on the\n\nuse of restraint before they cared for Ms. Delaune.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f      In fact, the evidence at trial established just the opposite. It was undisputed\n\nat trial that by the time Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers cared for Ms. Delaune they\n\nhad gone through paramedic school, they had been trained and educated on the use\n\nof restraints before working with ETMC and while working at ETMC, they were\n\ncertified paramedics, they had demonstrated their competence through testing to\n\nobtain and maintain their certifications and by testing at ETMC, that ETMC had a\n\npolicy on the use of restraints they were aware of, that ETMC had specifically\n\ntaught Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers on the use of restraint, and that ETMC’s\n\neducational program for training personnel like Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers\n\nfollowed the standardized national training curriculum (See, Appellant’s Brief on\n\nthe Merits, pages 10-14). Thus, in no way is the evidence here in any way, shape,\n\nor form similar to the evidence presented in Durham Transportation and Zrubeck.\n\nIf anything, Durham Transportation and Zrubeck illustrate and show the deficient\n\nnature of Appellees’ evidence.\n\n      Ching v. Methodist Children’s Hospital, has nothing whatsoever to do with\n\nwhether or not the evidence produced at trial by Appellees was legally sufficient to\n\nestablish either the standard of care applicable to ETMC in training personnel like\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers or a breach of that standard of care by ETMC in\n\ntraining personnel like Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers. On page 241 of Ching, the\n\npage cited by Appellees in their brief (Brief of Appellees, pages 30 and 31), the\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fAmarillo Court of Appeals only mentions the fact that a hospital has a common\n\nlaw duty to periodically monitor and review the competency of its medical staff.\n\nChing, 134 S.W.3d at 241. Absent from Ching is any information that describes\n\nfactually what a hospital would be required to do to discharge this duty or what\n\nwould constitute legally sufficient evidence of the applicable standard of care\n\nrelated to that duty or a breach of that duty.\n\n      This brings up a final point on this authority cited by Appellees. Contrary to\n\nAppellees’ claim in their brief, at no place on page 413 of Durham Transportation,\n\npages 591-92 of Zrubreck, or page 241 of Ching – or elsewhere in these opinions\n\nfor that matter – does the Corpus Christi Court of Appeals or the Amarillo Court of\n\nAppeals hold or state that “[t]he efficacy of a hospital’s implementation and\n\nenforcement of its policies must be measured by how well it succeeds in preparing\n\nits personnel to respond to known hazards, and not by how comprehensive the\n\nsyllabus appears on paper” (Brief of Appellees, page 31). In fact, nothing even\n\nremotely close to this is stated or held by the Corpus Christi Court of Appeals or\n\nthe Amarillo Court of Appeals in these opinions. This statement in Appellees’\n\nbrief is nothing more than the argument of counsel. This statement does not\n\nrepresent the binding or persuasive opinion of any court.\n\n      For these reasons, Appellees’ authority fails to establish or support a claim\n\nthat the evidence presented at trial was legally sufficient to establish the standard\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fof care applicable to ETMC, a breach of that standard of care by ETMC, or that\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers were not properly trained.\n\n   III.

More specifically, the Dallas Court of Appeals required plaintiff to\n\nproduce evidence of the specific training an employer exercising ordinary\n\nprudence would provide to its employees.

Because Lermon failed to\n\npresent specific evidence of what additional training was available and commonly\n\nused, but was not provided, the Dallas Court of Appeals found that Lermon had\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\ffailed to establish a negligent training claim against Minyard and it reversed the\n\njury verdict and trial court judgment in favor of Lerman and against Minyard. Id.\n\nat *28-29.\n\n      As in Lerman, the evidence here establishes that Ms. Moore and\n\nMs. Spurgers had pre-existing training and experience on the use of restraint. See,\n\nid. at *27-28. As in Lerman, there is no evidence that prior to the incident that\n\ninvolved Ms. Delaune there was any basis from which a reasonable employer\n\ncould conclude that Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers were unfit or unqualified to\n\nperform their job duties. See, id. at *29. As in Lerman, Appellees failed to present\n\nany evidence of additional training available or commonly used by employers like\n\nETMC that was not used in training Ms. Moore and Ms. Spurgers. See, id. at *28.\n\nAs in Lerman, Appellees failed to present any evidence that there was some\n\ntraining available to employers like ETMC that was superior to the training ETMC\n\nprovided. See, id. Finally and most important, as in Lerman, Appellees presented\n\nno evidence about what additional or different training an employer like ETMC\n\nshould have provided, but failed to provide. See, id.\n\n      The fact of the matter is that Appellees did not and could not produce\n\nevidence of this nature at trial because, as admitted by Appellees’ expert\n\nDr. Wayne, ETMC’s training program tracked what is required by the national\n\nregistry for emergency medical services provider certification (3 RR 11-19). For\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fthese reasons, as established and illustrated by Lerman, Appellees “failed to\n\nproduce any evidence a reasonably prudent employer would have provided training\n\n… to [Moore and Spurgers] beyond that which [ETMC] provided,” and, thus,\n\n“failed to show [ETMC] was negligent.” See, id. at *29. As such, the Tyler Court\n\nof Appeals should reverse the trial court’s judgment in favor of Appellees and\n\nenter judgment that Appellees take nothing.\n\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\f                                  CONCLUSION\n\n        Here is where things stand prior to the submission of this matter for\n\ndetermination by the Court – with or without oral argument.\n\n        First, Appellees’ only claim against ETMC is for its alleged failure to train\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers on the use of restraint.\n\n        Second, under Texas law, Appellees’ failure to train claim is a dependent\n\ntort.\n\n        Third, in order to prevail on a dependent tort claim, Appellees had to\n\nestablish that one of ETMC’s employees, Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers, committed\n\nan actionable tort on the occasion in question.\n\n        Fourth, the trial court determined as a matter of law that Ms. Moore and\n\nMs. Spurgers did not commit an actionable tort on the occasion in question.\n\n        Fifth, at trial Appellees had to produce legally sufficient evidence of the\n\nstandard of care applicable to ETMC in training employees like Ms. Moore and\n\nMs. Spurgers on the use of restraint and a breach of that standard of care by\n\nETMC.\n\n        Sixth, Appellees’ evidence does not state what specific training a reasonably\n\nprudent emergency medical services provider like ETMC should provide to\n\nemployees like Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers.\n\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\f      Seventh, Appellees’ evidence does not state what specific training a\n\nreasonably prudent emergency medical services provider like ETMC should\n\nprovide to employees like Ms. Moore or Ms. Spurgers, but was not provided to\n\nMs. Moore and Ms. Spurgers by ETMC.\n\n      For these reasons, Appellees’ evidence of the applicable standard of care,\n\nbreach of that standard of care and proximate cause on their claim against ETMC\n\nis legally insufficient.   Because Appellees’ evidence against ETMC is legally\n\ninsufficient in these respects, the Tyler Court of Appeals should reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s Final Judgment in favor of Appellees and against ETMC, and enter a take\n\nnothing judgment in favor of ETMC and against Appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\f                                        PRAYER\n\n      WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, East Texas Medical Center\n\nd/b/a East Texas Medical Center Emergency Medical Services, respectfully\n\nrequests that the Twelfth Court of Appeals grant it the following relief:\n\n      1.
