the last time hard\r\nenough so a witness heard the victim’s “brain crack.”<span>  </span>The victim, River Phoenix Williams, died from\r\nher injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>River\r\nPhoenix was two years old.<span>  </span>The attackers\r\nwere her father and the father’s live-in girlfriend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Just as\r\nRiver Phoenix had been entitled to the protections of the law, her attackers,\r\ntoo, are entitled to all applicable protective provisions of the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Latoya\r\nSmith, the live-in girlfriend, was convicted in River Phoenix’s death, after\r\nRiver Phoenix’s father, Neil Patrick Dewitt, had pled guilty to the same crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Sentenced to\r\nlife imprisonment without parole, Smith appeals, urging a number of arguments\r\nbut making no challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the offense\r\nof capital murder.<span>  </span>We affirm the trial\r\ncourt’s judgment because (1) the State’s nondisclosure of certain evidence did not\r\nrequire an in camera inspection of the State’s file or a mistrial, (2) no\r\nConfrontation Clause violation arose from the trial court’s rulings regarding\r\nthe testimony of Wade and Roberson, (3) admitting River Phoenix’s autopsy\r\nreport did not violate the Confrontation Clause, (4) excluding evidence of\r\nSmith’s mental health history during the guilt/innocence phase was not error,\r\nand (5) admitting evidence of Smith’s prior behavior and attitude toward River\r\nPhoenix was not error.<span>  </span>We address the\r\narguments in that order, after recounting the facts in greater detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Before her\r\ndeath, River Phoenix lived with Dewitt, Smith, and River Phoenix’s minor sister,\r\nK.T.<span>  </span>Dewitt admitted that he was party\r\nto the abuse that caused his child’s death, pled guilty to capital murder, and\r\nalso received a sentence of life imprisonment without parole.<span>  </span>He testified against Smith during her trial,\r\nconsistently said that the two of them killed River Phoenix, and enlightened\r\nthe jury on the origins of Smith’s jealousy, dislike, and abuse of River\r\nPhoenix, who was Dewitt’s daughter by another woman.<span>  </span>Dewitt stated, “When I found out that [River\r\nPhoenix] was my child, [Smith] had said, well, there’s your child you could’ve\r\nhad with me.”<span>  </span>Dewitt also testified that\r\nSmith would never accept River Phoenix, and felt that Dewitt “cheated on her\r\nbecause [River Phoenix] came in after we were together.”<span>  </span>Smith’s journal complained that Dewitt told\r\nRiver Phoenix that Smith was picking on her. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So now whenever I come in the room when she’s eating\r\nshe stops eating and watches me like I’m the TV . . ., so now I don’t go into\r\nany room that she’s in and I don’t say anything to her and I leave her and\r\n[Dewitt] alone and they seem to do just fine without me around.<span>  </span>Good news, she goes home [to her mother] on\r\nthe first of the month.<span>  </span>The bad news is\r\ntoday is only the 27th of the month.<span>  </span>I\r\nhave never disliked a child so much in my life.<span> \r\n</span>I wish she didn’t exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For this reason, both Dewitt and K.T. testified, Smith had a “bad”\r\nrelationship with River Phoenix resulting in child abuse. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Some of\r\nSmith’s treatment of River Phoenix was described by Kiara Kashawn Wade and her\r\nmother, Evelyn Roberson.<span>  </span>Smith, a\r\nstay-at-home hair stylist, booked an appointment with Wade for hair\r\nbraiding.<span>  </span>When Wade and Roberson\r\narrived, they noticed that River Phoenix was left in the back yard alone.<span>  </span>Wade testified:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When\r\n[Smith] started to braid my hair, [River Phoenix] was standing next to us, and\r\n[Smith] didn’t like that.<span>  </span>She said, go\r\nplay with the toys or go play with the dog.<span> \r\n</span>And [River Phoenix] didn’t move, she just stood there.<span>  </span>And that’s when [Smith] went on saying, we\r\nbought her all these toys and she don’t play with them, and she ended up siccing\r\nthe dog on the baby, making the baby cry . . . . [Smith] was just putting the\r\ndog on the baby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Wade asked Smith to stop, to which Smith replied, “[I]f you\r\ndon’t like it, then you can take her home with you.”<span>  </span>Smith then forced River Phoenix to stand in a\r\ncorner for seven hours.<span>  </span>“After she put\r\nher in a corner, [River Phoenix] kept crying . . . . <span> </span>But as [Smith] was talking to me . . . . she\r\nwas talking about [River Phoenix’s] mother, she was throwing stuff at the baby;\r\nhairbrushes, she threw some grease at her, and she threw a shoe at her.”<span>  </span>Smith reportedly told Wade that she hoped\r\nDewitt “did get custody of the baby, that way she could do what she wanted to\r\nwith [River Phoenix].”<span>  </span>Wade said, “[Y]ou\r\ncould tell [River Phoenix] wanted to sit down.<span> \r\n</span>You know, a baby’s legs . . . she was shaking . . . . <span> </span>She had been standing for almost six hours\r\nnow.”<span>  </span>At one point, Smith checked River\r\nPhoenix’s diaper, found it dirty, told her she stank, “smashed” the diaper\r\nagainst her, and “made her sit in it.”<span> \r\n</span>Smith refused Wade’s offer of help to change the diaper.<span>  </span>When Wade offered River Phoenix food, Smith “knocked\r\nit out of [her] hand” and offered River Phoenix the food herself.<span>  </span>When River Phoenix backed away, Smith said\r\nthat she had “a nasty attitude towards the people that take care of her, but\r\nwith everybody else that she don’t know she’s very friendly.”<span>  </span>Toward the end of the evening, Dewitt arrived\r\nand was instructed not to feed River Phoenix “anything because all the food in\r\nthe house belonged to [Smith].”<span>  </span>The\r\ncouple joked and “said they treat the dog better than they treat [River\r\nPhoenix] because her attitude is so messed up.”<span> \r\n</span>A distraught Wade returned to Roberson’s house and reported the day’s\r\nevents.<span>  </span>Roberson attempted an\r\nintervention with Dewitt and Smith, which resulted in Smith cursing the child\r\nand blaming her for her stubbornness.<span> \r\n</span>The couple told Roberson that River Phoenix “was the problem.”<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>The problems\r\ncontinued.<span>  </span>The day before River Phoenix’s\r\ndeath, she “was in her chair and didn’t want to eat.”<span>  </span>Smith became upset, yelled at the child, took\r\nher from the dinner table, and gave her a bath instead.<span>  </span>Then, River Phoenix was instructed to dress\r\nherself.<span>  </span>When the two-year-old was\r\nunsuccessful at this task, Smith spanked the child with a red leather belt that\r\nhad a brass buckle, a weapon used regularly by Smith to beat the child.<span>  </span>Smith “had beat her for a while, and then she\r\ngot increasingly frustrated and passed her to” Dewitt, who beat her with a\r\nblack leather belt.<span>  </span>At one point, Dewitt\r\n“hit her once over the top of the head with the belt.”<span>  </span>Dewitt justified his actions by claiming to\r\nbe supportive of Smith’s theory that River Phoenix was coddled.<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>The couple\r\npassed the baby back and forth between themselves for continued beatings over\r\nthe course of several hours.<span>  </span>The\r\nwhippings ended after Smith grabbed the child by her arms, “rammed her into the\r\nwall,” “dropped kicked her out of the way,” and walked away from her.<span>  </span>As if the child had not suffered enough, she\r\nwas later made to stand, without shoes, on a plastic crate cast with a large\r\ngrid pattern in its plastic body.<span>  </span>After\r\nDewitt nudged her with his foot, River Phoenix fell from the crate, hit her\r\nhead on a nearby nightstand, climbed back up, and continued to stand throughout\r\nthe night. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>The next\r\nmorning, Dewitt left for work, and K.T. boarded her school bus.<span>  </span>Dewitt had been “cheating on” Smith with\r\nanother woman whom he met on the Yahoo Singles dating website.<span>  </span>Smith discovered the website and called\r\nDewitt at work to inquire about the other woman.<span>  </span>He received angry telephone calls all day\r\nculminating in threats against River Phoenix’s life, including one instructing\r\nDewitt “to be careful when I pulled into the garage because [River Phoenix]\r\nwould be lying there dead.”<span>  </span>Dewitt did\r\nnot rush home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Around 1:00\r\np.m., Karrie Sue McNeil arrived to clean the apartment next door.<span>  </span>She noticed the unmistakable sound, coming\r\nfrom the Dewitt-Smith residence, of a baby crying and screaming in pain.<span>  </span>The child continued to cry and scream for the\r\nentire hour and a half it took McNeil to finish her job.<span>  </span>While she contemplated reporting her\r\nsuspicions, McNeil did not act on that idea.<span> \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>K.T. testified\r\nthat she returned from school that day to find River Phoenix “standing in the\r\ncorner hunched over, and her knees—her legs were swelled up and she had bags\r\nunder her eyes.”<span>  </span>Smith sat on the couch\r\nand would hit River Phoenix “with the belt on her legs” when the baby would\r\nfall down from standing.<span>  </span>K.T. was\r\nforbidden to intervene.<span>  </span>When Smith had\r\nher fill of this torture, K.T. was allowed to bathe River Phoenix.<span>  </span>K.T. observed “[s]he had whip marks on her\r\nlegs and on her back” and “nail marks on the back of her ear[s].” <span> </span>After the bath, K.T. took her baby sister to\r\nthe living room where Smith was watching television.<span>  </span>Smith “kneeled down in front of” the baby,\r\nand “pushed her down.”<span>  </span>River Phoenix\r\nfell backward, hit her head on the floor, and began to cry.<span>  </span>When she stumbled up to a standing position,\r\nSmith twice repeated this action.<span>  </span>As a\r\nresult of the third push to the ground, K.T. heard River Phoenix’s “brain\r\ncrack.”<span>  </span>River Phoenix “laid there\r\nlooking at the ceiling,” and “was wobbling” after she managed to stand up\r\nagain.<span>  </span>K.T. could tell her sister was\r\nbadly injured.<span>  </span>She next witnessed Smith\r\ncall Dewitt and tell him “[s]he was going to hang [River Phoenix] with her red\r\nbelt.”<span>  </span>At 9:00 p.m., K.T. was sent to\r\nbed. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Dewitt\r\nfinally arrived around 9:30 p.m. to find River Phoenix “in a full-blown seizure”\r\nwhile Smith sat apathetically on the couch watching television.<span>  </span>Dewitt made the decision not to seek\r\nemergency medical care after observing the extensive bruising on River Phoenix’s\r\nbody.<span>  </span>He testified Smith sat on the\r\ncouch “and kept rocking backing [sic] and forth, and she was like, I’m going to\r\njail, I’m going to jail, I’m going to jail.”<span> \r\n</span>River Phoenix suffered a second seizure.<span> \r\n</span>After putting River Phoenix in K.T.’s bedroom, Dewitt ate dinner and\r\nwent to bed, while Smith stayed awake pacing the hall.<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>K.T.\r\nchecked on her sister the next morning.<span>  </span>“Her\r\nbreathing was slowing down and her heart was slowing down.”<span>  </span>She informed her father, but went to school\r\nafter his assurance that River Phoenix would be fine.<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Shortly\r\nthereafter, River Phoenix died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>The couple “talked\r\nabout blaming it on [K.T.] and saying that [K.T.] had kept hitting her, and\r\nthat [Dewitt] would drive and dispose of the belts.”<span>  </span>While Dewitt was disposing of evidence, Smith\r\ncalled the police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Officer\r\nLatriesha Grandy spoke with Smith, who “didn’t show any concern for River\r\nPhoenix or her well-being or the kind of shape she was in.<span>  </span>It seems that her goal was to make sure she”\r\nblamed K.T. for River Phoenix’s injuries. <span> </span>After speaking with Detective Gisela\r\nAltamirano, however, Smith began to blame Dewitt, and then the family dog, for\r\nRiver Phoenix’s condition.<span>  </span>Grandy found\r\nRiver Phoenix nonresponsive with “bruises all over her body” consistent with\r\nphysical abuse to her forehead, abdomen, arms, legs, and ears. <span> </span>LifeNet responder James Pappas testified “[t]here\r\nwere various bruises of different sizes, shapes, locations, everywhere.<span>  </span>The best way to describe it you couldn’t take\r\nyour hand and place it anywhere on that child that your hand would not touch a\r\nbruise or more than one bruise.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Dewitt and\r\nSmith followed River Phoenix to the hospital.<span> \r\n</span>Doctors informed Altamirano they believed the child had undergone severe\r\nphysical abuse.<span>  </span>The couple was arrested,\r\nand Smith gave inconsistent recorded statements to police about the causes of\r\nRiver Phoenix’s bruising and her death.<span> \r\n</span>River Phoenix’s autopsy report confirmed “extensive blunt force trauma,\r\nabrasions, lacerations, and contusions over much of the body surface, including\r\nthe head, the trunk, and all four extremities, widely scattered throughout the\r\nbody,” with the cause of death being blunt head trauma. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"JRMOpinionHeading\">(1)<span>        </span>The\r\nState’s Nondisclosure of Certain Evidence Did Not Require an

[Smith] was just putting the\r\ndog on the baby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Wade asked Smith to stop, to which Smith replied, “[I]f you\r\ndon’t like it, then you can take her home with you.”<span>  </span>Smith then forced River Phoenix to stand in a\r\ncorner for seven hours.<span>  </span>“After she put\r\nher in a corner, [River Phoenix] kept crying . . . . <span> </span>But as [Smith] was talking to me . . . . she\r\nwas talking about [River Phoenix’s] mother, she was throwing stuff at the baby;\r\nhairbrushes, she threw some grease at her, and she threw a shoe at her.”<span>  </span>Smith reportedly told Wade that she hoped\r\nDewitt “did get custody of the baby, that way she could do what she wanted to\r\nwith [River Phoenix].”<span>  </span>Wade said, “[Y]ou\r\ncould tell [River Phoenix] wanted to sit down.<span> \r\n</span>You know, a baby’s legs . . . she was shaking . . . . <span> </span>She had been standing for almost six hours\r\nnow.”<span>  </span>At one point, Smith checked River\r\nPhoenix’s diaper, found it dirty, told her she stank, “smashed” the diaper\r\nagainst her, and “made her sit in it.”<span> \r\n</span>Smith refused Wade’s offer of help to change the diaper.<span>  </span>When Wade offered River Phoenix food, Smith “knocked\r\nit out of [her] hand” and offered River Phoenix the food herself.<span>  </span>When River Phoenix backed away, Smith said\r\nthat she had “a nasty attitude towards the people that take care of her, but\r\nwith everybody else that she don’t know she’s very friendly.”<span>  </span>Toward the end of the evening, Dewitt arrived\r\nand was instructed not to feed River Phoenix “anything because all the food in\r\nthe house belonged to [Smith].”<span>  </span>The\r\ncouple joked and “said they treat the dog better than they treat [River\r\nPhoenix] because her attitude is so messed up.”<span> \r\n</span>A distraught Wade returned to Roberson’s house and reported the day’s\r\nevents.<span>  </span>Roberson attempted an\r\nintervention with Dewitt and Smith, which resulted in Smith cursing the child\r\nand blaming her for her stubbornness.<span> \r\n</span>The couple told Roberson that River Phoenix “was the problem.”<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>The problems\r\ncontinued.<span>  </span>The day before River Phoenix’s\r\ndeath, she “was in her chair and didn’t want to eat.”<span>  </span>Smith became upset, yelled at the child, took\r\nher from the dinner table, and gave her a bath instead.<span>  </span>Then, River Phoenix was instructed to dress\r\nherself.<span>  </span>When the two-year-old was\r\nunsuccessful at this task, Smith spanked the child with a red leather belt that\r\nhad a brass buckle, a weapon used regularly by Smith to beat the child.<span>  </span>Smith “had beat her for a while, and then she\r\ngot increasingly frustrated and passed her to” Dewitt, who beat her with a\r\nblack leather belt.<span>  </span>At one point, Dewitt\r\n“hit her once over the top of the head with the belt.”<span>  </span>Dewitt justified his actions by claiming to\r\nbe supportive of Smith’s theory that River Phoenix was coddled.<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>The couple\r\npassed the baby back and forth between themselves for continued beatings over\r\nthe course of several hours.<span>  </span>The\r\nwhippings ended after Smith grabbed the child by her arms, “rammed her into the\r\nwall,” “dropped kicked her out of the way,” and walked away from her.<span>  </span>As if the child had not suffered enough, she\r\nwas later made to stand, without shoes, on a plastic crate cast with a large\r\ngrid pattern in its plastic body.<span>  </span>After\r\nDewitt nudged her with his foot, River Phoenix fell from the crate, hit her\r\nhead on a nearby nightstand, climbed back up, and continued to stand throughout\r\nthe night. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>The next\r\nmorning, Dewitt left for work, and K.T. boarded her school bus.<span>  </span>Dewitt had been “cheating on” Smith with\r\nanother woman whom he met on the Yahoo Singles dating website.<span>  </span>Smith discovered the website and called\r\nDewitt at work to inquire about the other woman.<span>  </span>He received angry telephone calls all day\r\nculminating in threats against River Phoenix’s life, including one instructing\r\nDewitt “to be careful when I pulled into the garage because [River Phoenix]\r\nwould be lying there dead.”<span>  </span>Dewitt did\r\nnot rush home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Around 1:00\r\np.m., Karrie Sue McNeil arrived to clean the apartment next door.<span>  </span>She noticed the unmistakable sound, coming\r\nfrom the Dewitt-Smith residence, of a baby crying and screaming in pain.<span>  </span>The child continued to cry and scream for the\r\nentire hour and a half it took McNeil to finish her job.<span>  </span>While she contemplated reporting her\r\nsuspicions, McNeil did not act on that idea.<span> \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>K.T. testified\r\nthat she returned from school that day to find River Phoenix “standing in the\r\ncorner hunched over, and her knees—her legs were swelled up and she had bags\r\nunder her eyes.”<span>  </span>Smith sat on the couch\r\nand would hit River Phoenix “with the belt on her legs” when the baby would\r\nfall down from standing.<span>  </span>K.T. was\r\nforbidden to intervene.<span>  </span>When Smith had\r\nher fill of this torture, K.T. was allowed to bathe River Phoenix.<span>  </span>K.T. observed “[s]he had whip marks on her\r\nlegs and on her back” and “nail marks on the back of her ear[s].” <span> </span>After the bath, K.T. took her baby sister to\r\nthe living room where Smith was watching television.<span>  </span>Smith “kneeled down in front of” the baby,\r\nand “pushed her down.”<span>  </span>River Phoenix\r\nfell backward, hit her head on the floor, and began to cry.<span>  </span>When she stumbled up to a standing position,\r\nSmith twice repeated this action.<span>  </span>As a\r\nresult of the third push to the ground, K.T. heard River Phoenix’s “brain\r\ncrack.”<span>  </span>River Phoenix “laid there\r\nlooking at the ceiling,” and “was wobbling” after she managed to stand up\r\nagain.<span>  </span>K.T. could tell her sister was\r\nbadly injured.<span>  </span>She next witnessed Smith\r\ncall Dewitt and tell him “[s]he was going to hang [River Phoenix] with her red\r\nbelt.”<span>  </span>At 9:00 p.m., K.T. was sent to\r\nbed. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Dewitt\r\nfinally arrived around 9:30 p.m. to find River Phoenix “in a full-blown seizure”\r\nwhile Smith sat apathetically on the couch watching television.<span>  </span>Dewitt made the decision not to seek\r\nemergency medical care after observing the extensive bruising on River Phoenix’s\r\nbody.<span>  </span>He testified Smith sat on the\r\ncouch “and kept rocking backing [sic] and forth, and she was like, I’m going to\r\njail, I’m going to jail, I’m going to jail.”<span> \r\n</span>River Phoenix suffered a second seizure.<span> \r\n</span>After putting River Phoenix in K.T.’s bedroom, Dewitt ate dinner and\r\nwent to bed, while Smith stayed awake pacing the hall.<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>K.T.\r\nchecked on her sister the next morning.<span>  </span>“Her\r\nbreathing was slowing down and her heart was slowing down.”<span>  </span>She informed her father, but went to school\r\nafter his assurance that River Phoenix would be fine.<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Shortly\r\nthereafter, River Phoenix died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>The couple “talked\r\nabout blaming it on [K.T.] and saying that [K.T.] had kept hitting her, and\r\nthat [Dewitt] would drive and dispose of the belts.”<span>  </span>While Dewitt was disposing of evidence, Smith\r\ncalled the police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            </span>Officer\r\nLatriesha Grandy spoke with Smith, who “didn’t show any concern for River\r\nPhoenix or her well-being or the kind of shape she was in.<span>  </span>It seems that her goal was to make sure she”\r\nblamed K.T. for River Phoenix’s injuries. <span> </span>After speaking with Detective Gisela\r\nAltamirano, however, Smith began to blame Dewitt, and then the family dog, for\r\nRiver Phoenix’s condition.<span>  </span>Grandy found\r\nRiver Phoenix nonresponsive with “bruises all over her body” consistent with\r\nphysical abuse to her forehead, abdomen, arms, legs, and ears. <span> </span>LifeNet responder James Pappas testified “[t]here\r\nwere various bruises of different sizes, shapes, locations, everywhere.<span>  </span>The best way to
