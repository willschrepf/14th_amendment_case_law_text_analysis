Allen, Administrative Law Judge\n                          Docket No. EDra08010034\n\n\n\n                              September 5, 2014\n\n                         OPINION–FOR PUBLICATION\n\n\nBAKER, Judge\n\f       Cardinal Ritter High School, Inc. (Ritter) appeals the determination of the\n\nAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ) for the Indiana Civil Rights Commission (ICRC)\n\nfinding that Ritter violated the Indiana Civil Rights Law (ICRL) when it did not select\n\nappellee-complainant Aleesha Bullock as a member of the girls’ varsity basketball team.\n\nRitter argues that, as it is a private, religious institution owned and operated by the\n\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis, the ICRL is not applicable. Also, Ritter\n\ncontends that the findings of fact and conclusions of law issued by the ALJ are\n\nunsupported by substantial evidence and maintains that the $25,000 award to Bullock for\n\nemotional damages is based on speculative evidence.          We find that the ICRC has\n\njurisdiction over the girls’ basketball team at a private, religious institution. However, we\n\nconclude that when, as here, the case hinged entirely on the credibility of the witnesses,\n\nthe issuance of an order by an ALJ who did not hear the evidence or observe the\n\nwitnesses is not in accordance with law, is contrary to the constitutional rights of the\n\nparties, and is without observance of procedures required by law. Therefore, we vacate\n\nthe order of the ICRC and remand with instructions to conduct a new hearing and issue a\n\ntimely ruling.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n        At the time the original complaint was filed, Ritter was a ministry of the Roman\n\nCatholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis. Bullock, who is African-American, attended Ritter\n\nand played on the girls’ varsity basketball team during the academic year of 2006-2007.\n\nAt that time, she was the team’s highest scorer.\n\n                                             2\n\f       However, Bullock was not selected to play for the varsity basketball team for the\n\n2007-2008 term.     The basketball coaches, including Coach William Clark, felt that\n\nBullock had shown a lack of commitment to the basketball program because she had\n\nchosen to play soccer rather than attend basketball conditioning. Clark told Bullock’s\n\nparents that she was not chosen to play because many younger players were improving at\n\na faster rate and better fit with the way he wanted to develop the team in the future.\n\n       On January 9, 2008, Bullock’s mother, Myrna Bullock, filed a complaint against\n\nRitter, alleging that Ritter had violated the ICRL. The complaint alleged that Ritter had\n\ncut Bullock from the varsity basketball team because of her race. Ritter filed its answer\n\non February 8, 2008, and denied that the ICRC had subject matter jurisdiction. It also\n\nrefuted Bullock’s claim that she was not selected for the team due to her race,\n\nmaintaining that Bullock was not chosen for the team due to concerns over her level of\n\nimprovement and commitment to the basketball program.\n\n       On October 21, 2009, ICRC Deputy Director Joshua Brewster determined that\n\nthere was not probable cause to believe that an unlawful discriminatory practice occurred.\n\nMyrna Bullock initiated an appeal. On May 12, 2011, the ICRC reversed the finding of\n\nno probable cause. At this point, Bullock, who was now of legal age to bring the\n\ncomplaint on her own behalf, was substituted as the complainant.\n\n       On May 23, 2012, a hearing was held before ALJ Robert Lange. At the hearing,\n\nBullock’s parents testified that Clark provided them with the following reasons for\n\ncutting Bullock: 1) he was concerned about her commitment to the team due to the fact\n\n                                             3\n\fthat she had consistently failed to attend summer basketball conditioning; 2) younger\n\nplayers were playing at or above Bullock’s level; 3) he was choosing players who would\n\nhelp to develop the team for the future; and 4) Bullock had not played at her usual level at\n\nsummer camp or at tryouts.\n\n       When Clark testified at the hearing, the following exchange took place:\n\n       Q: Is it true that at the meeting at the end of the tryouts – one of those\n       meetings – it was considered by you whether to let Aleesha to be on the\n       team but with the idea that she would not be playing very much?\n\n       A: I think as a coaching staff I think you have to decide everything. If this\n       player is not playing a lot, how does it affect this other player? If this\n       player is not selected, how does that affect the other players? So as far as\n       consideration, we considered that for all of our players, the ones that we\n       selected and the ones that we did not select.\n\n       Q: Is it not true that in Aleesha’s situation you were not dissuaded from\n       letting her on that team in that capacity because of a personality conflict of\n       some sort with Samantha Lynch.\n\n       A: I would say Aleesha’s personality conflicts with members of the team\n       would deal with the team chemistry issue. So in the selection of the team\n       process, team chemistry or how the team gels together is considered. Like\n       we mentioned before.\n\n       Q: But do you agree that that was – what I think you testified to in your\n       deposition – that that held you back from deciding to let Aleesha be on that\n       team or even sitting on the bench?\n\n       A: Well I think sitting on the bench during a game has little to do with if\n       you’re on the team or not. You’re talking about at everyday practices, how\n       are they going to be having this player here, how is it going to be not\n       having that player here. How is this team going to gel based on the group\n       you have in practice. Whether you bring up players from the JV or don’t\n       even select as a player on the team, that’s how the team gels. So did that\n       have a decision? It had a decision on how we selected our team. We\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       wanted to choose the team that would gel the most and also produce the\n       most wins for us.\n\nAdministrative Hearing Tr. p. 276-278.\n\n       The decision not to allow Bullock on the team in a limited-play basis was\n\ndiscussed further:\n\n       Q: Did you understand when you were answering these questions or\n       making these statements that I was inquiring as to whether or not when you\n       had these meeting after the tryouts, whether or not the alternative, which\n       has been discussed much today, of letting Aleesha have the chance of\n       letting Aleesha be a member of the team with the thought that she might not\n       be able to play as much as, maybe, she expected.\n\n       A: Was that considered?\n\n       Q: Yes.\n\n       A: That was considered for all the girls we cut.\n\nId. at 282.\n\n       ALJ Lange retired before making a ruling on the case. The commission then\n\nappointed Noell F. Allen as ALJ for the ICRC on July 2, 2013. ALJ Allen filed her\n\nProposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions and Order on July 19, 2013, finding that the\n\nICRC had jurisdiction over Bullock’s complaint as she was excluded from an opportunity\n\nrelating to education. ALJ Allen concluded that Ritter had violated the ICRL by cutting\n\nBullock from the girls’ basketball team due to her race and ordered Ritter to pay Bullock\n\n$75,000.\n\n        Ritter filed its objections to the Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions and Order\n\non August 2, 2013. ALJ Allen’s findings of facts included the following:\n\n                                             5\n\f                                          ...\n2. Bullock is African American.\n\n3. While enrolled as students of Ritter during their senior school year\nspanning 2007-2008, both Bullock and Samantha Lynch (“Lynch”) tried\nout for inclusion as members of the Varsity Team to that they could play on\nthat team during the 2007-2008 basketball season.\n\n4. While Lynch was accepted as a member of the Varsity Team by the\ncoach, William Clark (“Clark”), he denied Bullock a place on the team\neven on a limited-play basis. The final decision was Clark’s.\n\n5. Clark who testified at the hearing is Caucasian.\n\n6. During the Varsity Team’s basketball seasons corresponding to\nBullock’s and Lynch’s sophomore and junior years, both of them were\nmembers of the Varsity Team. Bullock typically played as a point guard\nand Lynch played as a two guard but they played these positions\ninterchangeably.\n\n7. In her sophomore year, Bullock was the leading scorer of the Varsity\nTeam. And by the end of that season Bullock was awarded a [plaque]\nrecognizing her as having the highest number of steals and the second\nhighest number of assists.\n\n8. In their junior (2006-2007) year together on the Varsity team, Bullock\nand Lynch for the entire basketball season scored 235 and 151 total points\nrespectively, they made 20.68 points and 6.86 points respectively per game,\ntheir field goals to field foals attempted were 40.8 percent and 29.3 percent\nrespectively, and their free throw to free throws attempted were 38.4\npercent and 44.4 percent respectively. Their turnover rates for the season\nwere 18 and 115 respectively.\n                                          ...\n\n12. Clark ultimately explained barring Bullock from membership on the\nVarsity Team even in a limited role capacity, saying this was because of\nBullock not getting along with other players, the only one of which Clark\nspecified was Lynch. However, at a meeting with Bullock’s parents, he\ntold them his reasons had to do with younger players already playing as\nwell as Bullock and that their participation in the Varsity Team best fit in\nwith his development of a better team in the future.\n\n                                      6\n\f       13. Clark has admitted girls to membership on Ritter’s girl’s junior varsity\n       basketball team with the express understanding that they would not be put\n       in play very much. He could have done the same for Bullock and even\n       considered the possibility of doing so. In competitive play, Clark even\n       allowed Kara Curtis, a member of the junior varsity team to [don] the\n       varsity team uniform and play as a part of that team at times.\n                                              ....\n\n       18. It is reasonably inferred that by Bullock not being made a member of\n       the Varsity Team during her senior year, this negatively affected Bullock’s\n       chances to be recruited by colleges looking to place promising high school\n       basketball players on their teams with tuition and other costs funded by\n       scholarships. Nonetheless, Bullock signed the form that authorized Ritter\n       to release basketball statistics to inquiring colleges, but as it turned out the\n       full expense for the first year at Indiana State University and the final three\n       years at Trine University fell on her and her parents. For the payment of\n       this Bullock incurred $25,000 in debt, and her parents incurred $63,000.\n\n       19. Bullock suffered emotional distress due to being excluded from\n       membership on the Varsity Team during her senior year. She cried when\n       she told her parents what had happened. She found herself unable to\n       continue attending Varsity Team games as a spectator during her senior\n       year because she cried so much the times she did attend. She avoided\n       trying out to be on college basketball teams out of a fear of just being\n       rejected again to her humiliation. The experience caused her to [doubt]\n       herself and to feel betrayed. She only . . . seemed to regain some [self-\n       confidence] by securing medication when she came of age.\n\nAppellant’s App. p. iv-viii.\n\n       Additionally, ALJ Allen’s conclusions of law included the following:\n                                              ...\n\n       11. There was a prima facie showing by a preponderance of the evidence\n       that Ritter preferentially admitted the Caucasian Lynch to and excluded the\n       African American Bullock from the Varsity Team for the 2007-2008\n       basketball season. This is evidenced by the fact that for the immediately\n       preceding 2006-2007 season, Bullock bested Lynch in all of the major\n       statistical categories and dramatically so in the case of total points for the\n\n\n                                              7\n\fwhole season, Bullock having scored 84 more points than Lynch scored,\nmaking her the second highest scorer on the Varsity Team.\n\n12. Once the prima facie case of unlawful discrimination is proven, it gives\nrise to a presumption of discrimination and shifts the burden of production\nto the respondent to rebut the presumption. St. Mary’s Honor Center v.\nHicks, 589 U.S. 5012, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993). In short,\nit becomes [the] respondent’s burden to produce evidence that the adverse\naction in question was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. St.\nMary’s, supra.\n\n13. Ritter rebutted the presumption of discrimination by articulating a\nnondiscriminatory reason for Clark denying Bullock Varsity Team\nmembership on just a limited-play basis during the 2007-2008 season;\nClark explained the denial, saying it was because Bullock did not get along\nwith Lynch and with other albeit unnamed team members.\n\n14. Upon Ritter’s articulation of the nondiscriminatory reason, Bullock\nassumes the burden to prove that the adverse decision was the result of\nintentional discrimination based on an impermissible discriminatory motive\n(Burdine, supra, 450 U.S. at 256). This may be done indirectly by showing\nthat the stated reason for the adverse action was a pretext for the sort of\ndiscrimination prohibited by law, meaning proof that the given reason was\nfalse and the real reason was discrimination. St. Mary’s Honor Center v.\nHicks, supra, 113 S. Ct. At 2752 n. 6. However, these two aspects of the\nrequisite level of proof may be simply realized in one step for the United\nStates Supreme Court has determined that the ultimate fact of\ndiscrimination may be inferred from the falsity of the nondiscriminatory\nexplanation. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 120 S. Ct.\n2097, 2108 (2000).\n\n15. Bullock proved that Ritter’s articulated reason for denying her\nmembership in the Varsity Team on a limited-play basis was a pretext for\ndiscrimination, that it was likely false, on account of the following:\n\n      a. Very soon after Ritter denied Bullock membership on the Varsity\n      Team in her senior year, Clark’s explanation to Bullock’s parents of\n      why he made the decision to not admit Bullock to the Varsity Team\n      included no reference to Bullock’s relationship to Lynch or other\n      team members. This supports a conclusion that Clark was not really\n\n\n                                     8\n\f             motivated to deny Bullock membership on the basis of any conflict\n             between her and Lynch and the other Varsity team members.\n\n             b. The evidence of the highly subjective quality of Clark’s reason for\n             denying Bullock membership in the Varsity team on a limited-play\n             basis [sic]. Outside of Lynch, he did not even name the other team\n             members with whom Bullock was supposed to have had a bad\n             relationship[,] much less specify any factual basis for such\n             conclusions regarding these unnamed persons. And Ritter’s only\n             specially stated evidence of Bullock and Lynch not getting along\n             with each other were the statements of Joy Hoy. She is the principal\n             of Ritter. In addition to just generally and subjectively saying that\n             Bullock and Lynch did not get along, she specified that Lynch told\n             her she wanted to be transferred out of Ritter as a consequence of\n             Bullock’s treatment of her. However there was no evidence by way\n             of testimony of Hoy or by any other means indicating that when\n             Clark denied Bullock membership on the Varsity Team he was\n             aware of Hoy’s specific information and/or that Hoy had shared this\n             information with Clark. At best, Clark testified that he subjectively\n             “thought” that Bullock said something that made the relationship\n             between Bullock and Lynch not a good one.\n\n      16. In that Ritter’s and Clark’s reason for denying Bullock membership on\n      the Varsity Team in even just a limited role is a pretext for discrimination\n      on the basis of race contrary to the Indiana Civil Rights Law, Bullock\n      sustained her burden of proving that Ritter denied to her an education\n      opportunity contrary to the Indiana Civil Rights Law and is entitled to\n      damages sufficient to compensate her for the harm Ritter’s discriminatory\n      acts caused her.\n\nAppellant’s App. p. 62-71.\n\n      On November 15, 2013, oral argument was held before the ICRC, and on\n\nDecember 30, 2013, the ICRC adopted ALJ Allen’s Proposed Findings of Fact,\n\nConclusions and Order. The ICRC also reduced the monetary award from $75,000 to\n\n$25,000, which it stated was an award for emotional distress.\n\n      Ritter now appeals.\n\n                                            9\n\f                                DISCUSSION AND DECISION\n\n       When reviewing a decision of an administrative agency, we apply the same\n\nstandard as the trial court. Ind. Dep’t. of Natural Res. v. Hoosier Envtl. Council, Inc.,\n\n831 N.E.2d 804, 808 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005). We will reverse the Board’s order only if it is\n\n“(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;\n\n(2) contrary to a constitutional right, power, privilege or immunity; (3) in excess of\n\nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitation, or short of statutory right; (4) without\n\nobservance of procedure required by law; or (5) unsupported by substantial evidence.”\n\nId. at 809; Ind. Code § 4-21.5-5-14(d)(1)-(5). We give deference to the expertise of the\n\nagency and will not reverse simply because we may have reached a different result than\n\nthe Commission. Ind. Civil Rights Comm’n v. Adler, 714 N.E.2d 632, 635 (Ind. 1999).\n\nThe burden of demonstrating the invalidity of an action is on the party challenging its\n\nvalidity. Ind. Code § 4-21.5-5-14(a). An interpretation of statutes and regulations by the\n\nadministrative agency charged with enforcing those statutes and regulations is entitled to\n\ngreat weight, Ind. Dept. of Envtl. Mgmt. v. Steel Dynamics Inc., 894 N.E.2d 271, 274\n\n(Ind. Ct. App. 2008).\n\n                                          I. Jurisdiction\n\n       At the outset, we address Bullock’s contention that Ritter has waived its\n\njurisdictional arguments. Bullock argues that Ritter may not assert lack of jurisdiction\n\nwhen it failed to do so in its objections to the findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\nHowever, while Bullock is correct that generally, when an ALJ has issued a non-final\n\n                                            10\n\forder recommended for adoption by the ICRC, issues are only preserved by assertion of\n\nobjections to the recommendation under Indiana Code section 4-21.5-3-29, subject matter\n\njurisdiction may not be waived or conferred by agreement, and may be raised by the\n\nparties at any time, including on appeal. Weldon v. Universal Reagents, Inc., 714 N.E.2d\n\n1104, 1107 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999). Therefore, Ritter has not waived its jurisdictional\n\narguments.\n\n       Turning to the merits, we address the issue of whether the ICRL applies to\n\nBullock’s claim. Ritter challenges ALJ Allen’s conclusion that the ICRC has jurisdiction\n\nover Ritter because participation on the girls’ varsity basketball team at Ritter “relates to”\n\neducation under Indiana Code section 22-9-1-3(l).\n\n       The goal of statutory construction is to determine, give effect to, and implement\n\nthe intent of the legislature. Sales v. State, 723 N.E.2d 416, 420 (Ind. 2000). The best\n\nevidence of legislative intent is surely the language of the statute itself, and courts strive\n\nto give the words in a statute their plain and ordinary meaning. A statute should be\n\nexamined as a whole, avoiding excessive reliance upon a strict literal meaning or the\n\nselective reading of individual words. Prewitt v. State, 878 N.E.2d 184 (Ind. 2007).\n\n       The purpose of the ICRL is “[t]he promotion of equal opportunity without regard\n\nto race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin, or ancestry through reasonable\n\nmethods.” Ind. Code § 22-9-1-2(b). This aligns with the public policy underlying the\n\nstatute:\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       It is the public policy of the state to provide all of its citizens equal\n       opportunity for education, employment, access to public conveniences and\n       accommodations, and acquisition through purchase or rental of real\n       property, including but not limited to housing, and to eliminate segregation\n       or separation based solely on race, religion, color, sex, disability, national\n       origin, or ancestry, since such segregation is an impediment to equal\n       opportunity. Equal education and employment opportunities and equal\n       access to and use of public accommodations and equal opportunity for\n       acquisition of real property are hereby declared to be civil rights.\n\nI.C. § 22-9-1-2(a).\n\n       In order to effect the purpose and policies underlying the ICRL, discriminatory\n\npractices are prohibited. The ICRL defines discriminatory practice as follows:\n\n       (1) the exclusion of a person from equal opportunities because of race,\n       religion, color, sex, disability, national origin, ancestry, or status as a\n       veteran;\n\n       (2) a system that excludes persons from equal opportunities because of\n       race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin, ancestry, or status as a\n       veteran;\n\n       (3) the promotion of racial segregation or separation in any manner,\n       including but not limited to the inducing of or the attempting to induce for\n       profit any person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding\n       the entry or prospective entry in the neighborhood of a person or persons of\n       a particular race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin, or ancestry;\n       or\n\n       (4) a violation of IC 22-9-5 that occurs after July 25, 1992, and is\n       committed by a covered entity (as defined in IC 22-9-5-4).\n\nI.C. § 22-9-1-3(l).    That section further states that “[e]very discriminatory practice\n\nrelating to the acquisition or sale of real estate, education, public accommodations,\n\nemployment, or the extending of credit . . . shall be considered unlawful unless it is\n\nspecifically exempted by this chapter.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n                                              12\n\f       Ritter argues that to construe membership on the extracurricular girls’ basketball\n\nteam at a private, religious high school as within the ICRC’s jurisdiction is “contrary to\n\nthe language and structure of the statute and creates absurd results.” Appellant’s Br. p. 8.\n\nSpecifically, Ritter argues that the ICRC’s finding that it had jurisdiction over\n\nextracurricular activities at Ritter because Ritter engages in activities relating to\n\neducation is inconsistent with the statute as a whole. As support for this argument, Ritter\n\npoints to the exclusion of “any school, educational, or charitable religious institution\n\nowned or conducted by or affiliated with a church or religious institution” from the\n\ndefinition of “employer” for purposes of employment discrimination. I.C. § 22-9-1-3(h).\n\nRitter implies that the legislature’s decision to exempt private, religious institutions from\n\nthe definition of “employer” evidences an intent to exempt the same from the jurisdiction\n\nof the ICRL for purposes of discrimination relating to education.\n\n       However, we find that a plain reading of the statute renders Ritter’s interpretation\n\nuntenable. First, we note that the legislature explicitly indicated that the ICRL “shall be\n\nconstrued broadly to effectuate its purpose.” I.C. section 22-9-1-2(g). Second, the ICRL\n\nclearly states that “[e]very discriminatory practice relating to the acquisition or sale of\n\nreal estate, education, public accommodations, employment, or the extending of credit . .\n\n. shall be considered unlawful unless it is specifically exempted by this chapter.” I.C. §\n\n22-9-1-3(l) (emphasis added).       The legislature chose to exempt private, religious\n\ninstitutions from the ICRC’s jurisdiction with regard to employment discrimination\n\ncomplaints; they did not choose to provide the same exemption for discrimination\n\n                                             13\n\f“relating to . . . education.” Id. Therefore, we find that membership on the girls’ varsity\n\nbasketball team at Ritter relates to education under the statute and Bullock’s complaint\n\ncomes within the jurisdiction of the ICRC.\n\n                                  II. Constitutional Claims\n\n       Ritter also contends that to affirm the ALJ’s determination that the ICRC has\n\njurisdiction over Ritter because participation on the girls’ varsity basketball team at Ritter\n\nrelates to education would violate Ritter’s rights to religious liberty and expressive\n\nassociation under both the United States Constitution and the Indiana Constitution.\n\n       In support of this argument, Ritter points us to N.L.R.B v. Catholic Bishop of\n\nChicago, 440 U.S. 490 (1979), in which the United States Supreme Court determined that\n\nthe National Labor Relations Board could not exercise jurisdiction over teachers in\n\nreligiously operated institutions because such exercise would violate the guarantees of the\n\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment. In that case, the Supreme Court focused on “the\n\nunique role of the teacher in fulfilling the mission of a church operated school,” and the\n\n“importance of the teacher’s function in a church school.” Id. at 501. The opinion\n\nfocused on the church-teacher relationship and cited concerns regarding the religious\n\nentanglement that might result when the Board might be asked to investigate claims of\n\nunfair labor practices where a religious school claimed that such practices were mandated\n\nby religious creeds; the Court stated that an inquiry into those claims would “necessarily\n\ninvolve inquiry into the good faith of the position asserted by clergy administrators and\n\nits relationship to the school’s religious mission.” Id. at 502.\n\n                                             14\n\f       This case does not involve employment; if it did, Ritter would be exempted by the\n\nICRL. I.C. § 22-9-1-3(h). Rather, this case involves Bullock’s claim that she was\n\nexcluded from an opportunity related to education and discriminated against on the basis\n\nof her race. To affirm the determination of the ALJ and award Bullock damages for\n\nemotional distress does not implicate interference with the religious creed of the Roman\n\nCatholic faith. Therefore, Ritter’s reliance on N.L.R.B v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago is\n\nmisplaced.\n\n       Ritter next argues that the United States Supreme Court has recognized that\n\nforbidding “interference in matters concerning religious doctrine and organization and by\n\ndictating neutrality on the part of our courts” allows religious organizations to determine\n\nmatters of church government, faith, and doctrine without State interference. Appellant’s\n\nBr. p. 14. Ritter cites several cases to support this principle.\n\n       However, none of the cases cited by Ritter have bearing on the instant case. In\n\nKedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in North America, the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court determined that a New York statute that attempted to\n\ntransfer control of churches violated the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.\n\n344 U.S. 94 (1952). In Kreshik v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral, the United States Supreme\n\nCourt dismissed a complaint asking the Court to determine the right to use and occupancy\n\nof a Cathedral as the question was strictly a matter of ecclesiastical government. 363\n\nU.S. 190 (1960). The Supreme Court of Maine held that the First Amendment barred a\n\nhusband and wife’s negligent supervision complaint against a priest from whom they had\n\n                                              15\n\freceived marriage counseling in Swanson v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Portland, 692\n\nA.2d 441 (Me. 1997). In Pentecostal Tabernacle of Muncie v. Pentecostal Tabernacle of\n\nMuncie, this Court determined that to decide who was right between two disputing\n\nreligious factions would constitute an interference with religious freedom. 146 N.E.2d\n\n573, 128 Ind. App. 145 (Ind. Ct. App. 1957). And in McEnroy v. St. Meinrad School of\n\nTheology, this Court found that resolving a terminated professor’s contract claims would\n\nexcessively entangle the Court in religious affairs. 713 N.E.2d 334 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999).\n\n       All of the above cases cited by Ritter deal with administrative/teaching functions\n\nor ecclesiastical government; they deal directly with matters of faith and creed. The case\n\nbefore us involves a complaint of racial discrimination against a student who wished to\n\nbe admitted to play on the girls’ varsity basketball team. We do not find that Ritter’s\n\nrights under either the United States Constitution or the Indiana Constitution are\n\nimplicated here.\n\n                                      III. Procedural Issues\n\n       While we find that the ICRC did have jurisdiction over the girls’ basketball team\n\nat Ritter, we must address the serious procedural inadequacies that present themselves in\n\nthis case.\n\n       First, it is evident from the record that the ICRC took an inordinate amount of time\n\nto perform its statutory duties. Bullock was denied admission to the girls’ basketball\n\nteam in the fall of 2007. Appellant’s App. p. 63. Her mother filed a claim with the ICRC\n\nin January 2008. Id. at 1. In May 2012, the same year that Bullock’s high school class\n\n                                            16\n\fgraduated from college, the matter was heard by an ALJ. Id. at 61. Then in July 2013,\n\nmore than a full year after the evidentiary hearing, a different ICRC ALJ issued its\n\nProposed Findings of Facts, Conclusions and Order, which were amended and adopted by\n\nthe ICRC on December 30, 2013, more than six years after Bullock was cut from the\n\ngirls’ basketball team. Id. at 61-62. We find that such a delay cannot be considered\n\nappropriate.\n\n       Second, the procedure utilized by the ICRC was deficient. Courts that review\n\nadministrative decisions are prohibited from reweighing the evidence or judging the\n\ncredibility of witnesses and must accept the facts as found by the administrative body.\n\nNatural Res. Comm'n v. Sugar Creek Mobile Estates, 646 N.E.2d 61, 64 (Ind. Ct. App.\n\n1995). This prohibition arises from the fact that the administrative agency, through its\n\nduly appointed ALJ, is the party who heard directly the witnesses’ testimony, observed\n\ntheir demeanor, and determined their credibility.\n\n       Here, the ALJ who heard the witnesses’ testimony retired six months after the\n\nhearing in this matter and did not enter proposed findings. Then, a different ALJ, who\n\ndid not hear the parties’ testimony, did not observe their demeanor, and did not make any\n\ncredibility determinations based on what she heard or observed, entered the Proposed\n\nFindings of Fact, Conclusions and Order. Therefore, in entering the proposed findings,\n\nthe ALJ was weighing evidence that she did not hear and determining the credibility of\n\nwitnesses that she did not see.\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f      As the ALJ entered her Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions and Order without\n\npersonally observing the demeanor of the witnesses, she was effectively in the same\n\nposition this Court usually holds as a reviewing court. We have previously held that,\n\nwhen examining “cold evidence,” a reviewing court may “assess independently this\n\nevidence without invading the province of the trial court.” State v. Bisard, 973 N.E.2d\n\n1229, 1237 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012) (holding that an independent assessment of blood\n\nevidence was appropriate); See also Bunch v. State, 964 N.E.2d 274, 293 (Ind. Ct. App.\n\n2012) (holding that it was not necessary to defer to the post-conviction court’s\n\nassessment of expert’s scientific evidence where the assessment was not based on\n\ndemeanor but on evidence that was also in front of the appellate court). However, in\n\nBisard and Bunch, the evidence to be examined did not involve credibility; if it had, “we\n\nwould defer to the post-conviction court’s assessment of fact witnesses.” Id.\n\n      Here, the case hinges entirely on credibility. ALJ Allen found, as a conclusion of\n\nlaw, that Ritter’s nondiscriminatory explanation for cutting Bullock from the team–that\n\nBullock was not admitted to the team on a limited-play basis because she did not get\n\nalong with the other girls–was a pretext for discrimination. ALJ Allen also found that,\n\nbecause Clark’s explanation to Bullock’s parents regarding Bullock’s exclusion from the\n\nteam cited other reasons, and did not include information about Bullock’s ability to get\n\nalong with other members of the team, such a reason was a pretext. Id.\n\n      The danger inherent in the issuance of an order by an ALJ who did not hear the\n\nevidence and must make credibility determinations becomes apparent when one looks to\n\n                                           18\n\fthe record in this case, which shows that ALJ Allen erroneously determined that Ritter\n\nproffered the explanation that Bullock did not get along with other players as a\n\nnondiscriminatory purpose for cutting Bullock from the girls’ varsity basketball team.\n\nClark and the other coaches made two decisions concerning Bullock. First, the coaches\n\ndetermined which of the forty-one girls who tried out for the varsity team should be cut.\n\nAdministrative Hearing Tr. p. 277. After they made cuts, they determined which of the\n\ngirls who had been cut would be suitable to be members of the team on a limited-play\n\nbasis, wherein they would perhaps get limited playing time or help the team in other\n\nways. Id. at 277, 282.\n\n       The record shows that when considering the first decision, whether to cut Bullock\n\nfrom the team, Clark and the other coaches never mentioned that she did not get along\n\nwith other girls. Rather, they gave the reasons which he cited to her parents–that Bullock\n\nwas not improving as quickly as some of the girls, that he questioned her commitment to\n\nthe team due to her failure to participate in summer workouts and conditioning, and that\n\nchoosing younger players who were playing at or beyond Bullock’s level was a better\n\ndecision for the team’s future. Id. at 201, 209, 213, 217, 218, 223, 233, 252, 257.\n\n       Once Clark and the other coaches had determined which girls to cut from the\n\nteam, they then considered whether to allow some of the girls to play on a limited-play\n\nbasis. It was when making this second decision that it was determined that Bullock’s\n\nissues with Lynch and other teammates might make for bad team chemistry and that\n\nBullock was unlikely to be happy playing in a limited capacity. Id. at 277 – 284. The\n\n                                            19\n\frecord shows that Clark understood that, when he cited team chemistry as a reason for\n\nexcluding Bullock from the team in a limited-play capacity, he was looking at a separate\n\ndecision from allowing her on the team in a full capacity.   Indeed, Clark testified that he\n\nmade a determination regarding limited-play membership “for all the girls that we cut.”\n\nId. at 282.\n\n       Therefore, two separate sets of nondiscriminatory reasons were provided for two\n\ndistinct sets of decisions. The nondiscriminatory purpose underlying the decision not to\n\nallow Bullock on the team in a limited-play capacity was not a pretext for discrimination.\n\nA separate nondiscriminatory purpose was set forth for cutting Bullock from the team in\n\na full-capacity role.\n\n       We find that when, as here, a case hinges entirely on credibility, the issuance of an\n\norder by an ALJ who did not hear the evidence or observe the witnesses is not in\n\naccordance with law, is contrary to the constitutional rights of the parties, and is without\n\nobservance of procedures required by law. Therefore, we vacate the order of the ICRC\n\nand remand with instructions to conduct a new hearing and issue a timely ruling.\n\n       The judgment of the ICRC is vacated and remanded.\n\nKIRSCH, J., and ROBB, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\f",

(Ritter) appeals the determination of the\n\nAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ) for the Indiana Civil Rights Commission (ICRC)\n\nfinding that Ritter violated the Indiana Civil Rights Law (ICRL) when it did not select\n\nappellee-complainant Aleesha Bullock as a member of the girls’ varsity basketball team.\n\nRitter argues that, as it is a private, religious institution owned and operated by the\n\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis, the ICRL is not applicable. Also, Ritter\n\ncontends that the findings of fact and conclusions of law issued by the ALJ are\n\nunsupported by substantial evidence and maintains that the $25,000 award to Bullock for\n\nemotional damages is based on speculative evidence.          We find that the ICRC has\n\njurisdiction over the girls’ basketball team at a private, religious institution. However, we\n\nconclude that when, as here, the case hinged entirely on the credibility of the witnesses,\n\nthe issuance of an order by an ALJ who did not hear the evidence or observe the\n\nwitnesses is not in accordance with law, is contrary to the constitutional rights of the\n\nparties, and is without observance of procedures required by law. Therefore, we vacate\n\nthe order of the ICRC and remand with instructions to conduct a new hearing and issue a\n\ntimely ruling.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n        At the time the original complaint was filed, Ritter was a ministry of the Roman\n\nCatholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis. Bullock, who is African-American, attended Ritter\n\nand played on the girls’ varsity basketball team during the academic year of 2006-2007.\n\nAt that time, she was the team’s highest scorer.\n\n                                             2\n\f       However, Bullock was not selected to play for the varsity basketball team for the\n\n2007-2008 term.     The basketball coaches, including Coach William Clark, felt that\n\nBullock had shown a lack of commitment to the basketball program because she had\n\nchosen to play soccer rather than attend basketball conditioning. Clark told Bullock’s\n\nparents that she was not chosen to play because many younger players were improving at\n\na faster rate and better fit with the way he wanted to develop the team in the future.\n\n       On January 9, 2008, Bullock’s mother, Myrna Bullock, filed a complaint against\n\nRitter, alleging that Ritter had violated the ICRL. The complaint alleged that Ritter had\n\ncut Bullock from the varsity basketball team because of her race. Ritter filed its answer\n\non February 8, 2008, and denied that the ICRC had subject matter jurisdiction. It also\n\nrefuted Bullock’s claim that she was not selected for the team due to her race,\n\nmaintaining that Bullock was not chosen for the team due to concerns over her level of\n\nimprovement and commitment to the basketball program.\n\n       On October 21, 2009, ICRC Deputy Director Joshua Brewster determined that\n\nthere was not probable cause to believe that an unlawful discriminatory practice occurred.\n\nMyrna Bullock initiated an appeal. On May 12, 2011, the ICRC reversed the finding of\n\nno probable cause. At this point, Bullock, who was now of legal age to bring the\n\ncomplaint on her own behalf, was substituted as the complainant.\n\n       On May 23, 2012, a hearing was held before ALJ Robert Lange. At the hearing,\n\nBullock’s parents testified that Clark provided them with the following reasons for\n\ncutting Bullock: 1) he was concerned about her commitment to the team due to the fact\n\n                                             3\n\fthat she had consistently failed to attend summer basketball conditioning; 2) younger\n\nplayers were playing at or above Bullock’s level; 3) he was choosing players who would\n\nhelp to develop the team for the future; and 4) Bullock had not played at her usual level at\n\nsummer camp or at tryouts.\n\n       When Clark testified at the hearing, the following exchange took place:\n\n       Q: Is it true that at the meeting at the end of the tryouts – one of those\n       meetings – it was considered by you whether to let Aleesha to be on the\n       team but with the idea that she would not be playing very much?\n\n       A: I think as a coaching staff I think you have to decide everything. If this\n       player is not playing a lot, how does it affect this other player? If this\n       player is not selected, how does that affect the other players? So as far as\n       consideration, we considered that for all of our players, the ones that we\n       selected and the ones that we did not select.\n\n       Q: Is it not true that in Aleesha’s situation you were not dissuaded from\n       letting her on that team in that capacity because of a personality conflict of\n       some sort with Samantha Lynch.\n\n       A: I would say Aleesha’s personality conflicts with members of the team\n       would deal with the team chemistry issue. So in the selection of the team\n       process, team chemistry or how the team gels together is considered. Like\n       we mentioned before.\n\n       Q: But do you agree that that was – what I think you testified to in your\n       deposition – that that held you back from deciding to let Aleesha be on that\n       team or even sitting on the bench?\n\n       A: Well I think sitting on the bench during a game has little to do with if\n       you’re on the team or not. You’re talking about at everyday practices, how\n       are they going to be having this player here, how is it going to be not\n       having that player here. How is this team going to gel based on the group\n       you have in practice. Whether you bring up players from the JV or don’t\n       even select as a player on the team, that’s how the team gels. So did that\n       have a decision? It had a decision on how we selected our team. We\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       wanted to choose the team that would gel the most and also produce the\n       most wins for us.\n\nAdministrative Hearing Tr. p. 276-278.\n\n       The decision not to allow Bullock on the team in a limited-play basis was\n\ndiscussed further:\n\n       Q: Did you understand when you were answering these questions or\n       making these statements that I was inquiring as to whether or not when you\n       had these meeting after the tryouts, whether or not the alternative, which\n       has been discussed much today, of letting Aleesha have the chance of\n       letting Aleesha be a member of the team with the thought that she might not\n       be able to play as much as, maybe, she expected.\n\n       A: Was that considered?\n\n       Q: Yes.\n\n       A: That was considered for all the girls we cut.\n\nId. at 282.\n\n       ALJ Lange retired before making a ruling on the case. The commission then\n\nappointed Noell F. Allen as ALJ for the ICRC on July 2, 2013. ALJ Allen filed her\n\nProposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions and Order on July 19, 2013, finding that the\n\nICRC had jurisdiction over Bullock’s complaint as she was excluded from an opportunity\n\nrelating to education. ALJ Allen concluded that Ritter had violated the ICRL by cutting\n\nBullock from the girls’ basketball team due to her race and ordered Ritter to pay Bullock\n\n$75,000.\n\n        Ritter filed its objections to the Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions and Order\n\non August 2, 2013. ALJ Allen’s findings of facts included the following:\n\n                                             5\n\f                                          ...\n2. Bullock is African American.\n\n3. While enrolled as students of Ritter during their senior school year\nspanning 2007-2008, both Bullock and Samantha Lynch (“Lynch”) tried\nout for inclusion as members of the Varsity Team to that they could play on\nthat team during the 2007-2008 basketball season.\n\n4. While Lynch was accepted as a member of the Varsity Team by the\ncoach, William Clark (“Clark”), he denied Bullock a place on the team\neven on a limited-play basis. The final decision was Clark’s.\n\n5. Clark who testified at the hearing is Caucasian.\n\n6. During the Varsity Team’s basketball seasons corresponding to\nBullock’s and Lynch’s sophomore and junior years, both of them were\nmembers of the Varsity Team. Bullock typically played as a point guard\nand Lynch played as a two guard but they played these positions\ninterchangeably.\n\n7. In her sophomore year, Bullock was the leading scorer of the Varsity\nTeam. And by the end of that season Bullock was awarded a [plaque]\nrecognizing her as having the highest number of steals and the second\nhighest number of assists.\n\n8. In their junior (2006-2007) year together on the Varsity team, Bullock\nand Lynch for the entire basketball season scored 235 and 151 total points\nrespectively, they made 20.68 points and 6.86 points respectively per game,\ntheir field goals to field foals attempted were 40.8 percent and 29.3 percent\nrespectively, and their free throw to free throws attempted were 38.4\npercent and 44.4 percent respectively. Their turnover rates for the season\nwere 18 and 115 respectively.\n                                          ...\n\n12. Clark ultimately explained barring Bullock from membership on the\nVarsity Team even in a limited role capacity, saying this was because of\nBullock not getting along with other players, the only one of which Clark\nspecified was Lynch. However, at a meeting with Bullock’s parents, he\ntold them his reasons had to do with younger players already playing as\nwell as Bullock and that their participation in the Varsity Team best fit in\nwith his development of a better team in the future.\n\n                                      6\n\f       13. Clark has admitted girls to membership on Ritter’s girl’s junior varsity\n       basketball team with the express understanding that they would not be put\n       in play very much. He could have done the same for Bullock and even\n       considered the possibility of doing so. In competitive play, Clark even\n       allowed Kara Curtis, a member of the junior varsity team to [don] the\n       varsity team uniform and play as a part of that team at times.\n                                              ....\n\n       18. It is reasonably inferred that by Bullock not being made a member of\n       the Varsity Team during her senior year, this negatively affected Bullock’s\n       chances to be recruited by colleges looking to place promising high school\n       basketball players on their teams with tuition and other costs funded by\n       scholarships. Nonetheless, Bullock signed the form that authorized Ritter\n       to release basketball statistics to inquiring colleges, but as it turned out the\n       full expense for the first year at Indiana State University and the final three\n       years at Trine University fell on her and her parents. For the payment of\n       this Bullock incurred $25,000 in debt, and her parents incurred $63,000.\n\n       19. Bullock suffered emotional distress due to being excluded from\n       membership on the Varsity Team during her senior year. She cried when\n       she told her parents what had happened. She found herself unable to\n       continue attending Varsity Team games as a spectator during her senior\n       year because she cried so much the times she did attend. She avoided\n       trying out to be on college basketball teams out of a fear of just being\n       rejected again to her humiliation. The experience caused her to [doubt]\n       herself and to feel betrayed. She only . . . seemed to regain some [self-\n       confidence] by securing medication when she came of age.\n\nAppellant’s App. p. iv-viii.\n\n       Additionally, ALJ Allen’s conclusions of law included the following:\n                                              ...\n\n       11. There was a prima facie showing by a preponderance of the evidence\n       that Ritter preferentially admitted the Caucasian Lynch to and excluded the\n       African American Bullock from the Varsity Team for the 2007-2008\n       basketball season. This is evidenced by the fact that for the immediately\n       preceding 2006-2007 season, Bullock bested Lynch in all of the major\n       statistical categories and dramatically so in the case of total points for the\n\n\n                                              7\n\fwhole season, Bullock having scored 84 more points than Lynch scored,\nmaking her the second highest scorer on the Varsity Team.\n\n12. Once the prima facie case of unlawful discrimination is proven, it gives\nrise to a presumption of discrimination and shifts the burden of production\nto the respondent to rebut the presumption.

In short,\nit becomes [the] respondent’s burden to produce evidence that the adverse\naction in question was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. St.\nMary’s, supra.\n\n13. Ritter rebutted the presumption of discrimination by articulating a\nnondiscriminatory reason for Clark denying Bullock Varsity Team\nmembership on just a limited-play basis during the 2007-2008 season;\nClark explained the denial, saying it was because Bullock did not get along\nwith Lynch and with other albeit unnamed team members.\n\n14. Upon Ritter’s articulation of the nondiscriminatory reason, Bullock\nassumes the burden to prove that the adverse decision was the result of\nintentional discrimination based on an impermissible discriminatory motive\n(Burdine, supra, 450 U.S. at 256). This may be done indirectly by showing\nthat the stated reason for the adverse action was a pretext for the sort of\ndiscrimination prohibited by law, meaning proof that the given reason was\nfalse and the real reason was discrimination. St. Mary’s Honor Center v.\nHicks, supra, 113 S. Ct. At 2752 n. 6. However, these two aspects of the\nrequisite level of proof may be simply realized in one step for the United\nStates Supreme Court has determined that the ultimate fact of\ndiscrimination may be inferred from the falsity of the nondiscriminatory\nexplanation.

Bullock proved that Ritter’s articulated reason for denying her\nmembership in the Varsity Team on a limited-play basis was a pretext for\ndiscrimination, that it was likely false, on account of the following:\n\n      a. Very soon after Ritter denied Bullock membership on the Varsity\n      Team in her senior year, Clark’s explanation to Bullock’s parents of\n      why he made the decision to not admit Bullock to the Varsity Team\n      included no reference to Bullock’s relationship to Lynch or other\n      team members. This supports a conclusion that Clark was not really\n\n\n                                     8\n\f             motivated to deny Bullock membership on the basis of any conflict\n             between her and Lynch and the other Varsity team members.\n\n             b. The evidence of the highly subjective quality of Clark’s reason for\n             denying Bullock membership in the Varsity team on a limited-play\n             basis [sic]. Outside of Lynch, he did not even name the other team\n             members with whom Bullock was supposed to have had a bad\n             relationship[,] much less specify any factual basis for such\n             conclusions regarding these unnamed persons. And Ritter’s only\n             specially stated evidence of Bullock and Lynch not getting along\n             with each other were the statements of Joy Hoy. She is the principal\n             of Ritter. In addition to just generally and subjectively saying that\n             Bullock and Lynch did not get along, she specified that Lynch told\n             her she wanted to be transferred out of Ritter as a consequence of\n             Bullock’s treatment of her. However there was no evidence by way\n             of testimony of Hoy or by any other means indicating that when\n             Clark denied Bullock membership on the Varsity Team he was\n             aware of Hoy’s specific information and/or that Hoy had shared this\n             information with Clark. At best, Clark testified that he subjectively\n             “thought” that Bullock said something that made the relationship\n             between Bullock and Lynch not a good one.\n\n      16. In that Ritter’s and Clark’s reason for denying Bullock membership on\n      the Varsity Team in even just a limited role is a pretext for discrimination\n      on the basis of race contrary to the Indiana Civil Rights Law, Bullock\n      sustained her burden of proving that Ritter denied to her an education\n      opportunity contrary to the Indiana Civil Rights Law and is entitled to\n      damages sufficient to compensate her for the harm Ritter’s discriminatory\n      acts caused her.\n\nAppellant’s App. p. 62-71.\n\n      On November 15, 2013, oral argument was held before the ICRC, and on\n\nDecember 30, 2013, the ICRC adopted ALJ Allen’s Proposed Findings of Fact,\n\nConclusions and Order. The ICRC also reduced the monetary award from $75,000 to\n\n$25,000, which it stated was an award for emotional distress.\n\n      Ritter now appeals.\n\n                                            9\n\f                                DISCUSSION AND DECISION\n\n       When reviewing a decision of an administrative agency, we apply the same\n\nstandard as the trial court.

Bullock argues that Ritter may not assert lack of jurisdiction\n\nwhen it failed to do so in its objections to the findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\nHowever, while Bullock is correct that generally, when an ALJ has issued a non-final\n\n                                            10\n\forder recommended for adoption by the ICRC, issues are only preserved by assertion of\n\nobjections to the recommendation under Indiana Code section 4-21.5-3-29, subject matter\n\njurisdiction may not be waived or conferred by agreement, and may be raised by the\n\nparties at any time, including on appeal.

Ct. App. 1999). Therefore, Ritter has not waived its jurisdictional\n\narguments.\n\n       Turning to the merits, we address the issue of whether the ICRL applies to\n\nBullock’s claim. Ritter challenges ALJ Allen’s conclusion that the ICRC has jurisdiction\n\nover Ritter because participation on the girls’ varsity basketball team at Ritter “relates to”\n\neducation under Indiana Code section 22-9-1-3(l).\n\n       The goal of statutory construction is to determine, give effect to, and implement\n\nthe intent of the legislature. Sales v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"853681\"><a href=\"/opinion/853681/sales-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 420 (Ind. 2000). The best\n\nevidence of legislative intent is surely the language of the statute itself, and courts strive\n\nto give the words in a statute their plain and ordinary meaning. A statute should be\n\nexamined as a whole, avoiding excessive reliance upon a strict literal meaning or the\n\nselective reading of individual words. Prewitt v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"852509\"><a href=\"/opinion/852509/prewitt-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ind. 2007).\n\n       The purpose of the ICRL is “[t]he promotion of equal opportunity without regard\n\nto race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin, or ancestry through reasonable\n\nmethods.” Ind. Code § 22-9-1-2(b). This aligns with the public policy underlying the\n\nstatute:\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       It is the public policy of the state to provide all of its citizens equal\n       opportunity for education, employment, access to public conveniences and\n       accommodations, and acquisition through purchase or rental of real\n       property, including but not limited to housing, and to eliminate segregation\n       or separation based solely on race, religion, color, sex, disability, national\n       origin, or ancestry, since such segregation is an impediment to equal\n       opportunity. Equal education and employment opportunities and equal\n       access to and use of public accommodations and equal opportunity for\n       acquisition of real property are hereby declared to be civil rights.\n\nI.C. § 22-9-1-2(a).\n\n       In order to effect the purpose and policies underlying the ICRL, discriminatory\n\npractices are prohibited. The ICRL defines discriminatory practice as follows:\n\n       (1) the exclusion of a person from equal opportunities because of race,\n       religion, color, sex, disability, national origin, ancestry, or status as a\n       veteran;\n\n       (2) a system that excludes persons from equal opportunities because of\n       race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin, ancestry, or status as a\n       veteran;\n\n       (3) the promotion of racial segregation or separation in any manner,\n       including but not limited to the inducing of or the attempting to induce for\n       profit any person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding\n       the entry or prospective entry in the neighborhood of a person or persons of\n       a particular race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin, or ancestry;\n       or\n\n       (4) a violation of IC 22-9-5 that occurs after July 25, 1992, and is\n       committed by a covered entity (as defined in IC 22-9-5-4).\n\nI.C. § 22-9-1-3(l).    That section further states that “[e]very discriminatory practice\n\nrelating to the acquisition or sale of real estate, education, public accommodations,\n\nemployment, or the extending of credit . . . shall be considered unlawful unless it is\n\nspecifically exempted by this chapter.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n                                              12\n\f       Ritter argues that to construe membership on the extracurricular girls’ basketball\n\nteam at a private, religious high school as within the ICRC’s jurisdiction is “contrary to\n\nthe language and structure of the statute and creates absurd results.” Appellant’s Br. p. 8.\n\nSpecifically, Ritter argues that the ICRC’s finding that it had jurisdiction over\n\nextracurricular activities at Ritter because Ritter engages in activities relating to\n\neducation is inconsistent with the statute as a whole. As support for this argument, Ritter\n\npoints to the exclusion of “any school, educational, or charitable religious institution\n\nowned or conducted by or affiliated with a church or religious institution” from the\n\ndefinition of “employer” for purposes of employment discrimination. I.C. § 22-9-1-3(h).\n\nRitter implies that the legislature’s decision to exempt private, religious institutions from\n\nthe definition of “employer” evidences an intent to exempt the same from the jurisdiction\n\nof the ICRL for purposes of discrimination relating to education.\n\n       However, we find that a plain reading of the statute renders Ritter’s interpretation\n\nuntenable. First, we note that the legislature explicitly indicated that the ICRL “shall be\n\nconstrued broadly to effectuate its purpose.” I.C. section 22-9-1-2(g). Second, the ICRL\n\nclearly states that “[e]very discriminatory practice relating to the acquisition or sale of\n\nreal estate, education, public accommodations, employment, or the extending of credit . .\n\n. shall be considered unlawful unless it is specifically exempted by this chapter.” I.C. §\n\n22-9-1-3(l) (emphasis added).       The legislature chose to exempt private, religious\n\ninstitutions from the ICRC’s jurisdiction with regard to employment discrimination\n\ncomplaints; they did not choose to provide the same exemption for discrimination\n\n                                             13\n\f“relating to . . . education.” Id. Therefore, we find that membership on the girls’ varsity\n\nbasketball team at Ritter relates to education under the statute and Bullock’s complaint\n\ncomes within the jurisdiction of the ICRC.\n\n                                  II. Constitutional Claims\n\n       Ritter also contends that to affirm the ALJ’s determination that the ICRC has\n\njurisdiction over Ritter because participation on the girls’ varsity basketball team at Ritter\n\nrelates to education would violate Ritter’s rights to religious liberty and expressive\n\nassociation under both the United States Constitution and the Indiana Constitution.\n\n       In support of this argument, Ritter points us to N.L.R.B v. Catholic Bishop of\n\nChicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110040\"><a href=\"/opinion/110040/nlrb-v-catholic-bishop-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), in which the United States Supreme Court determined that\n\nthe National Labor Relations Board could not exercise jurisdiction over teachers in\n\nreligiously operated institutions because such exercise would violate the guarantees of the\n\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment. In that case, the Supreme Court focused on “the\n\nunique role of the teacher in fulfilling the mission of a church operated school,” and the\n\n“importance of the teacher’s function in a church school.” Id. at 501. The opinion\n\nfocused on the church-teacher relationship and cited concerns regarding the religious\n\nentanglement that might result when the Board might be asked to investigate claims of\n\nunfair labor practices where a religious school claimed that such practices were mandated\n\nby religious creeds; the Court stated that an inquiry into those claims would “necessarily\n\ninvolve inquiry into the good faith of the position asserted by clergy administrators and\n\nits relationship to the school’s religious mission.” Id. at 502.\n\n                                             14\n\f       This case does not involve employment; if it did, Ritter would be exempted by the\n\nICRL. I.C. § 22-9-1-3(h). Rather, this case involves Bullock’s claim that she was\n\nexcluded from an opportunity related to education and discriminated against on the basis\n\nof her race. To affirm the determination of the ALJ and award Bullock damages for\n\nemotional distress does not implicate interference with the religious creed of the Roman\n\nCatholic faith. Therefore, Ritter’s reliance on N.L.R.B v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago is\n\nmisplaced.\n\n       Ritter next argues that the United States Supreme Court has recognized that\n\nforbidding “interference in matters concerning religious doctrine and organization and by\n\ndictating neutrality on the part of our courts” allows religious organizations to determine\n\nmatters of church government, faith, and doctrine without State interference. Appellant’s\n\nBr. p. 14. Ritter cites several cases to support this principle.\n\n       However, none of the cases cited by Ritter have bearing on the instant case. In\n\nKedroff v.

Ct. App. 1999).\n\n       All of the above cases cited by Ritter deal with administrative/teaching functions\n\nor ecclesiastical government; they deal directly with matters of faith and creed. The case\n\nbefore us involves a complaint of racial discrimination against a student who wished to\n\nbe admitted to play on the girls’ varsity basketball team. We do not find that Ritter’s\n\nrights under either the United States Constitution or the Indiana Constitution are\n\nimplicated here.\n\n                                      III. Procedural Issues\n\n       While we find that the ICRC did have jurisdiction over the girls’ basketball team\n\nat Ritter, we must address the serious procedural inadequacies that present themselves in\n\nthis case.\n\n       First, it is evident from the record that the ICRC took an inordinate amount of time\n\nto perform its statutory duties. Bullock was denied admission to the girls’ basketball\n\nteam in the fall of 2007. Appellant’s App. p. 63. Her mother filed a claim with the ICRC\n\nin January 2008. Id. at 1. In May 2012, the same year that Bullock’s high school class\n\n                                            16\n\fgraduated from college, the matter was heard by an ALJ. Id. at 61. Then in July 2013,\n\nmore than a full year after the evidentiary hearing, a different ICRC ALJ issued its\n\nProposed Findings of Facts, Conclusions and Order, which were amended and adopted by\n\nthe ICRC on December 30, 2013, more than six years after Bullock was cut from the\n\ngirls’ basketball team. Id. at 61-62. We find that such a delay cannot be considered\n\nappropriate.\n\n       Second, the procedure utilized by the ICRC was deficient. Courts that review\n\nadministrative decisions are prohibited from reweighing the evidence or judging the\n\ncredibility of witnesses and must accept the facts as found by the administrative body.\n\nNatural Res. Comm'n v. Sugar Creek Mobile Estates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2225481\"><a href=\"/opinion/2225481/natural-res-comn-v-sugar-creek-mob-est/\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 (Ind. Ct. App.\n\n1995). This prohibition arises from the fact that the administrative agency, through its\n\nduly appointed ALJ, is the party who heard directly the witnesses’ testimony, observed\n\ntheir demeanor, and determined their credibility.\n\n       Here, the ALJ who heard the witnesses’ testimony retired six months after the\n\nhearing in this matter and did not enter proposed findings. Then, a different ALJ, who\n\ndid not hear the parties’ testimony, did not observe their demeanor, and did not make any\n\ncredibility determinations based on what she heard or observed, entered the Proposed\n\nFindings of Fact, Conclusions and Order. Therefore, in entering the proposed findings,\n\nthe ALJ was weighing evidence that she did not hear and determining the credibility of\n\nwitnesses that she did not see.\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f      As the ALJ entered her Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions and Order without\n\npersonally observing the demeanor of the witnesses, she was effectively in the same\n\nposition this Court usually holds as a reviewing court. We have previously held that,\n\nwhen examining “cold evidence,” a reviewing court may “assess independently this\n\nevidence without invading the province of the trial court.” State v. Bisard, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1229</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1237 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012) (holding that an independent assessment of blood\n\nevidence was appropriate); See also Bunch v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2440615\"><a href=\"/opinion/2440615/bunch-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 293 (Ind. Ct. App.\n\n2012) (holding that it was not necessary to defer to the post-conviction court’s\n\nassessment of expert’s scientific evidence where the assessment was not based on\n\ndemeanor but on evidence that was also in front of the appellate court). However, in\n\nBisard and Bunch, the evidence to be examined did not involve credibility; if it had, “we\n\nwould defer to the post-conviction court’s assessment of fact witnesses.” Id.\n\n      Here, the case hinges entirely on credibility. ALJ Allen found, as a conclusion of\n\nlaw, that Ritter’s nondiscriminatory explanation for cutting Bullock from the team–that\n\nBullock was not admitted to the team on a limited-play basis because she did not get\n\nalong with the other girls–was a pretext for discrimination. ALJ Allen also found that,\n\nbecause Clark’s explanation to Bullock’s parents regarding Bullock’s exclusion from the\n\nteam cited other reasons, and did not include information about Bullock’s ability to get\n\nalong with other members of the team, such a reason was a pretext. Id.\n\n      The danger inherent in the issuance of an order by an ALJ who did not hear the\n\nevidence and must make credibility determinations becomes apparent when one looks to\n\n                                           18\n\fthe record in this case, which shows that ALJ Allen erroneously determined that Ritter\n\nproffered the explanation that Bullock did not get along with other players as a\n\nnondiscriminatory purpose for cutting Bullock from the girls’ varsity basketball team.\n\nClark and the other coaches made two decisions concerning Bullock. First, the coaches\n\ndetermined which of the forty-one girls who tried out for the varsity team should be cut.\n\nAdministrative Hearing Tr. p. 277. After they made cuts, they determined which of the\n\ngirls who had been cut would be suitable to be members of the team on a limited-play\n\nbasis, wherein they would perhaps get limited playing time or help the team in other\n\nways. Id. at 277, 282.\n\n       The record shows that when considering the first decision, whether to cut Bullock\n\nfrom the team, Clark and the other coaches never mentioned that she did not get along\n\nwith other girls. Rather, they gave the reasons which he cited to her parents–that Bullock\n\nwas not improving as quickly as some of the girls, that he questioned her commitment to\n\nthe team due to her failure to participate in summer workouts and conditioning, and that\n\nchoosing younger players who were playing at or beyond Bullock’s level was a better\n\ndecision for the team’s future. Id. at 201, 209, 213, 217, 218, 223, 233, 252, 257.\n\n       Once Clark and the other coaches had determined which girls to cut from the\n\nteam, they then considered whether to allow some of the girls to play on a limited-play\n\nbasis. It was when making this second decision that it was determined that Bullock’s\n\nissues with Lynch and other teammates might make for bad team chemistry and that\n\nBullock was unlikely to be happy playing in a limited capacity. Id. at 277 – 284. The\n\n                                            19\n\frecord shows that Clark understood that, when he cited team chemistry as a reason for\n\nexcluding Bullock from the team in a limited-play capacity, he was looking at a separate\n\ndecision from allowing her on the team in a full capacity.   Indeed, Clark testified that he\n\nmade a determination regarding limited-play membership “for all the girls that we cut.”\n\nId. at 282.\n\n       Therefore, two separate sets of nondiscriminatory reasons were provided for two\n\ndistinct sets of decisions. The nondiscriminatory purpose underlying the decision not to\n\nallow Bullock on the team in a limited-play capacity was not a pretext for discrimination.\n\nA separate nondiscriminatory purpose was set forth for cutting Bullock from the team in\n\na full-capacity role.\n\n       We find that when, as here, a case hinges entirely on credibility, the issuance of an\n\norder by an ALJ who did not hear the evidence or observe the witnesses is not in\n\naccordance with law, is contrary to the constitutional rights of the parties, and is without\n\nobservance of procedures required by law. Therefore, we vacate the order of the ICRC\n\nand remand with instructions to conduct a new hearing and issue a timely ruling.\n\n       The judgment of the ICRC is vacated and remanded.\n\nKIRSCH, J., and ROBB, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\f</pre>",
