A primary driver, according to prison\nauthorities, was the lack of female correctional officers to\noversee female offenders and administer sensitive tasks, such\nas observing inmates showering and dressing and performing\nthe pat (or “pat-down”) and strip searches that are stitched\ninto the fabric of day-to-day prison life. After long wrestling\nwith this gender gap, the state undertook a comprehensive\nassessment and ultimately designated a limited number of\nfemale-only correctional positions—specifically, 110\npositions to patrol housing units, prison grounds, and work\nsites. The prison guards’ union, Teamsters Local No. 117\n\f4   TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n\n(“Teamsters” or the “Union”), challenged this practice,\nthough it acknowledges the legitimacy of 50 of the female-\nonly designations. This case juxtaposes the prison’s\npenological interests against male correctional officers who\nclaim the staffing policy discriminates against them on the\nbasis of sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e.\n\n    We conclude that the Washington Department of\nCorrections’ (the “Department” or the “state”) individualized,\nwell-researched decision to designate discrete sex-based\ncorrectional officer categories was justified because sex is a\nbona-fide occupational qualification (“BFOQ”) for those\npositions.          The Union’s thin evidentiary\nsubmissions—coupled with expert claims that were largely\nunsubstantiated or missed the point—failed to raise a material\nfactual issue. Indeed, the startling statement by one of the\nUnion’s experts underscores the legitimacy of the state’s\nefforts to combat sexual abuse: “Sexual abuse is present in all\nareas of our society. . .[F]emale inmates must be taught as\npart of the rehabilitation process to deal with all abusive staff:\nmales and females . . .” The Department was well-justified\nin concluding that rampant abuse should not be an accepted\npart of prison life and taking steps to protect the welfare of\ninmates under its care. We affirm the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the Department.\n\n                        BACKGROUND\n\n   The Department runs two women’s prisons. The\nWashington Corrections Center for Women in Gig Harbor\nhas a capacity of 738 inmates, although it is often\novercrowded. That prison runs the gamut from minimum\nsecurity facilities to housing for violent offenders and those\n\f     TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.              5\n\nwith mental health issues. It also houses Washington’s death\nrow for female prisoners. The second facility is Mission\nCreek Corrections Center for Women in Belfair, a smaller\nminimum-security prison that houses around 300 inmates.\n\n    For decades, men dominated the ranks of prison guards,\nthough neither party has provided precise figures. Facing a\nshortage of female guards in the late 1980s, state prison\nadministrators began allowing male guards to perform\nrandom, clothed body searches—commonly known as pat\nsearches—of the female inmates at Washington Corrections\nCenter. Female inmates challenged these cross-gender\nsearches as unconstitutional. The district court granted an\ninjunction and halted the practice. Sitting en banc, we\naffirmed, concluding that cross-gender body searches inflict\nunnecessary and wanton pain on female inmates, many of\nwhom have suffered a history of sexual abuse before\nincarceration, and, therefore, violate the Eighth Amendment.1\nJordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521, 1531 (9th Cir. 1993) (en\nbanc). Under both Jordan and a later-enacted Washington\nlaw, female correctional officers must perform all non-\nemergency pat searches of female inmates. Wash. Rev. Code\n§ 9.94A.631(2) (2012).\n\n    In the years following Jordan, the Department struggled\nwith the challenges posed by having an overwhelmingly male\nworkforce. In 1998, it asked the Washington Human Rights\nCommission (the “Commission”) for an opinion on proposed\ncorrectional assignments reserved exclusively for female\n\n\n\n  1\n    Experts in the case noted that 85% of female offenders reported a pre-\nincarceration history of sexual abuse. Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1525–26.\n\f6       TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n\nofficers. The Commission did not favor the Department’s\napproach at that time.2\n\n    In 2003, Congress passed the Prison Rape Elimination\nAct, which included findings that, based upon experts’\nconservative estimates, 13% of prisoners had been sexually\nassaulted while in prison. See 42 U.S.C. § 15601. The\nlegislation also noted that many instances of abuse go\nunreported and prison personnel were inadequately trained to\ndeal with these issues. See id. §§ 15601–09. Under the Act,\nthe Department received a $1 million grant to hire two full-\ntime employees to investigate sexual misconduct allegations\nin prisons.\n\n    In the years that followed, the Department fielded\nwidespread allegations of sexual abuse in its women’s\nprisons. State officials, for example, substantiated 46\ninstances of misconduct in a single two-and-a-half-year\nstretch. In the aftermath, in 2007, female inmates brought a\nclass action in state court alleging misconduct at the\nWashington Corrections Center. The complaint detailed\nincidents where guards assaulted and fondled female inmates\nand forced them to perform oral sex and masturbate in the\npresence of male officers. Complaint, Jane Doe v. Clarke,\n\n\n\n    2\n        The Human Rights Commission, established in 1949, is the\nadministrative agency responsible for administering and enforcing the\nstate’s antidiscrimination laws. See Wash. Rev. Code § 49.60.120 (2007).\nThe Commission’s view is treated as an “advisory interpretative\nstatement” under Washington Revised Code Section 34.05.010(8). Before\nadopting female-only guard positions, the Department requested opinion\nletters from the Commission. Teamsters Local Union No. 117 v. State of\nWash. Human Rights Comm’n, 235 P.3d 858, 860 (Wash. Ct. App. 2010).\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.   7\n\nNo. 07-2-01513-0, Dkt. No. 4 (Thurston Co. Super. Ct. July\n31, 2007).\n\n    Within a week of the filing of that lawsuit, the\nDepartment hired a consultant to investigate sexual activity\nand misconduct. After a four-month internal investigation,\nthe consultant detailed the facts in a 240-plus-page report.\nThe investigation included interviews with 72 “Jane Doe”\ninmates, who alleged that they faced sexual advances and\nharassment from prison guards. Among the lurid details,\nmale guards twice impregnated inmates and smuggled\ncontraband in exchange for sexual favors.\n\n    The Department also hired two additional consultants to\nreview prison practices. Marianne McNabb, of the Social\nResearch Institute based in Olympia, Washington, wrote:\n\n       Cross-sex supervision is currently one of the\n       most significant issues facing the\n       administration of women’s prisons. Today in\n       many states, over 50 percent of the custody\n       force in prisons for women are men. The fact\n       that so many women in prison have\n       experienced sexual abuse by men makes them\n       different from male prisoners who do not\n       share that history and therefore do not\n       experience the same level of anxiety or\n       violation as do women, when under the\n       custody or supervision of an officer of the\n       opposite sex.\n\n    McNabb noted that several jurisdictions, including Idaho\nand Michigan, “have established sex-specific posts in female\ninstitutions” in response to these dynamics. Her report\n\f8   TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n\nconcluded, “While this may seem to be a solution for many\nof the concerns identified, this practice is generally not fully\nunderstood or accepted by staff and has faced some legal\nchallenges.”\n\n    Donald Kelchner, superintendent of the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Corrections, urged the Department to adopt a\nhost of reforms, including guard assignments reserved\nspecifically for women.          In particular, Kelchner\nrecommended that the state ensure any double-staffed\nhousing units have at least one female guard. Kelchner\nconcluded, “It is more desirable in an institution housing\nfemales to have a higher number of female staff, to work with\nand supervise the inmates.”\n\n    Following the expert recommendations, the Department\nin January 2008 implemented an array of reforms to “reduce\nprison sexual assaults and related behavior.” Those efforts\nincluded aggressive recruitment of female prison guards;\npre-hiring psychological testing; training programs to\nenhance “gender awareness”; and the installation of privacy\ncurtains, security cameras, and restricted access entry cards.\n\n    Then, in May 2008, prison administrators again requested\nguidance from the Commission on the Department’s\nproposed 110 female-only guard post assignments at the two\nprisons. The Department submitted a tailored request for\neach post, explaining the job responsibilities and why the\npositions needed a female officer. The state told the\nCommission that “[i]ncreasing the number of female staff\nwill reduce the risk of sexual misconduct, reduce allegations\nof sexual misconduct, and protect male staff exposed to\nvulnerable situations” and unfounded complaints of abuse.\nThe state also emphasized the privacy requirements of female\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.    9\n\ninmates and the operational need to have female officers on\nhand to perform necessary searches and other tasks. The\nrequested staffing changes, according to the state, would\n“ensure the security of the prisons, safety of incarcerated\noffenders, and protection of the privacy and dignity of female\noffenders.”\n\n    After touring the prisons, interviewing administrators, and\ncollecting detailed documentation, the Commission in\nFebruary 2009 approved the Department’s request for all 110\npositions. The Commission offered Teamsters the chance to\nprovide input but none was forthcoming. The Commission\ndetermined that, with the then-existing staff makeup at the\nprisons, the state was “unable to ensure a proper balance\nbetween security considerations and the privacy rights of\noffenders” and that there were no reasonable alternatives to\nsex-based staffing.\n\n    The class action settled soon after. As part of the\nsettlement agreement, the Department agreed to enforce a\n“zero tolerance” policy regarding sexual misconduct, not to\nrehire five male correctional officers accused of abuse, and to\nsubmit regular reports on staff misconduct in women’s\nprisons. The settlement also included an undisclosed payout\nto abused prisoners. Stipulation and Proposed Order, Jane\nDoe v. Clarke, No. 07-2-01513-0, Dkt. No. 170 (Thurston Co.\nSuper. Ct. Aug. 6, 2010).\n\n    The Department’s reprieve from the courtroom did not\nlast long. In September 2011, Teamsters, which represents\nsome 6,000 state correctional workers, filed this federal\nlawsuit, alleging that the sex-based staffing policy\n\f10 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nimplemented in 2009 violates the civil rights of male prison\nguards.3\n\n    At the conclusion of discovery, the district court granted\nsummary judgment for the state. Teamsters Local Union No.\n117 v. Wash. Dep’t of Corr., No. C11-5760 BHS, 2013 WL\n1412335 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 8, 2013). The district court first\nfound that the Union had failed to demonstrate the type of\n“cognizable injury” required to trigger Title VII liability. The\ncourt noted that the record developed by Teamsters included\nonly “hypothetical evidence” of the damages its members\nwould face, thus entitling the state to summary judgment. Id.\nat *4. Alternatively, the district court also granted summary\njudgment for the state on the question of sex discrimination.\nAs an initial matter, the district court ruled that judicial\ndeference to state prison officials was warranted. Id. The\ncourt concluded that, although there may have been factual\nquestions on whether female guards were needed inside the\nhousing units to prevent sexual assaults, the staffing policy\nwas justified as a BFOQ to protect the privacy of inmates for\neach job category. Id. at 5–9.\n\n                               ANALYSIS\n\nI. STANDING\n\n   This case is a cautionary tale about the threshold\nimportance of standing. The state argues, for the first time on\n\n\n  3\n    Teamsters also represents female correctional officers. The Union\nasserts in its brief that the female-only correction positions result in “an\nincrease in mandatory overtime” for female guards. The Union presented\nno evidence to support that contention. Our analysis therefore focuses on\nthe male guards.\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.   11\n\nappeal, and after receiving Teamsters’ opening brief, that the\nUnion lacks standing because it produced no evidence that\nany of its members suffered concrete injury. The issue is not,\nas Teamsters urges, whether the question was addressed by\nthe district court; rather, as a jurisdictional matter, “a\nchallenge to constitutional standing is one which we are\nrequired to consider” apart from whether it was argued or\naddressed below. Laub v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 342 F.3d\n1080, 1085 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation mark and\ncitation omitted).\n\n    The standing inquiry is governed by the familiar elements\nof injury-in-fact, traceability, and redressability. “To\nestablish Article III standing, an injury must be concrete,\nparticularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the\nchallenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.”\nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1147 (2013)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). For\nassociational standing, Teamsters must show in addition that\n“its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their\nown right.” Associated Gen. Contractors of Am., San Diego\nChapter v. Cal. Dep’t of Transp., 713 F.3d 1187, 1194 (9th\nCir. 2013). In other words, the Union “must show that a\nmember suffers an injury-in-fact that is traceable to the\ndefendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.”\nId.\n\n    The complaint posited varied theories of injury: male\nguards were forced to transfer jobs and prisons; suffered lost\nearnings, including overtime pay; were laid off; and\nexperienced “loss of status, diminished sense of self-worth,\nanxiety, emotional distress, embarrassment, humiliation,\nmental anguish, and other related damages.” Surprisingly,\nproof of these general allegations did not materialize as\n\f12 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nevidence. The Union’s submissions on summary judgment\nare thin, at best, in terms of identifying one or more specific\nmembers who suffered injury. Ironically, it is the testimony\nthe Union elicited from the state that provides the strongest\nsupport for the Teamsters’ constitutional standing.\nThroughout discovery, the state did not dispute the general\nallegations that its staffing policy resulted in the transfer of\nmale guards and lost overtime opportunities. While no\nevidence linked a specific officer with a discrete wage loss,\nSuperintendent Doug Cole indicated that six male officers\nhad been displaced from their regular shifts—mentioning two\nby name—and agreed with the Union’s lawyer that, with\nrespect to male correctional officers, the staffing changes\nwould result in “some reduction in their overtime opportunity\n. . .” Every male correctional officer who was displaced from\nhis regular shift, however, was offered a position on a\ndifferent shift.\n\n     As the state points out, when a challenge to standing is\nraised at summary judgment, a plaintiff organization must\n“submit competent evidence, not mere allegations, to\ndemonstrate that at least one of its members had standing.”\nAssociated General, 713 F.3d at 1194. This is a settled\nproposition, though curiously the state never moved for\nsummary judgment on standing nor contested the Union’s\nstanding allegations. Nonetheless, a party is not excused\nfrom establishing standing simply because the opposing party\ndid not tumble to the issue until the appeals stage. See Gest\nv. Bradbury, 443 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir. 2006) (“The[]\nelements of standing must be supported in the same way as\nany other matter for which a plaintiff bears the burden of\nproof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required\nat the successive stages of the litigation.”).\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.    13\n\n     In response to the state’s motion to dismiss on appeal,\nTeamsters moved to supplement the record with affidavits\nfrom five Union members and an administrator. Why this\nevidence surfaced only on appeal is a mystery. Ordinarily,\nwe do not allow parties to supplement the record on appeal\nabsent “extraordinary circumstances.” United States v.\nBoulware, 558 F.3d 971, 975–76 (9th Cir. 2009). Here,\nhowever, we accept the affidavits for the limited purpose of\nconfirming the job-related harms that the Department\nacknowledged in general terms during discovery. Doing so\nis “in the interests of justice and efficiency,” Ouachita Watch\nLeague v. Jacobs, 463 F.3d 1163, 1170 (11th Cir. 2006)\n(internal citation omitted), since the hiring policy has been on\nthe books since 2009 and has been the subject of multiple\nproceedings; a remand or dismissal on procedural grounds\nwould merely prolong resolution of the underlying issues. In\nthe affidavits, male correctional officers assert that they have\nsuffered precisely the types of harm that the state\nacknowledged in discovery—most importantly, lost overtime.\n\n    Although the Union hardly made a slam-dunk showing of\nprospective harm, the record as supplemented on appeal\nreflects the bare minimum necessary to satisfy the threshold\nrequirement of standing. The Department’s motion to\ndismiss the appeal on standing grounds is denied.\n\nII. TITLE VII AND THE BONA FIDE OCCUPATIONAL\n    QUALIFICATION\n\n    Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits\nemployment practices that discriminate on the basis of race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2.\nNevertheless, a facially discriminatory employment practice,\nsuch as the sex-based hiring practice we have here, may pass\n\f14 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nlegal muster if sex is a bona fide occupational qualification or\nBFOQ. That narrow exception—found in § 2000e-2(e)(1)—\nprovides:\n\n       [I]t shall not be an unlawful employment\n       practice for an employer to hire and employ\n       employees . . . on the basis of . . . sex . . .\n       where . . . sex . . . is a bona fide occupational\n       qualification reasonably necessary to the\n       normal operation of that particular business or\n       enterprise.\n\n    The Supreme Court has emphasized that “[t]he BFOQ\ndefense is written narrowly, and this Court has read it\nnarrowly.” UAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 201\n(1991). The BFOQ defense applies to “special situations”\nwhere employment discrimination is based upon “objective,\nverifiable requirements” that “concern job-related skills and\naptitudes.” Id. An “occupational qualification” means a\n“qualification[] that affect[s] an employee’s ability to do the\njob.” Id.\n\n    Under our precedent, the BFOQ defense “may be invoked\nonly when the essence of the business operation would be\nundermined by hiring individuals of both sexes.” Breiner v.\nNev. Dep’t of Corr., 610 F.3d 1202, 1210 (9th Cir. 2010)\n(emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). To justify discrimination under the BFOQ\nexception, an employer must show, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that: (1) the “job qualification justifying the\ndiscrimination is reasonably necessary to the essence of its\nbusiness”; and (2) that “sex is a legitimate proxy for\ndetermining” whether a correctional officer has the necessary\njob qualifications. Ambat v. City & Cty. of San Francisco,\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.   15\n\n757 F.3d 1017, 1025 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Breiner,\n610 F.3d at 1210).\n\n    In light of these demanding legal standards, BFOQs are\nfew and far between. In many industries, it is difficult to\nimagine any jobs that would qualify as BFOQs. However, the\n“unique context of prison employment,” id. at 1028, is one\narea where courts have found sex-based classifications\njustified. The Supreme Court directly addressed the prison\nenvironment in just one case, Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S.\n321 (1977). The Court held that, in the context of a\nmaximum-security facility “where violence is the order of the\nday” and sex offenders were interspersed with other\nprisoners, a female guard’s sex may “undermine her capacity\nto provide the security that is the essence of a correctional\ncounselor’s responsibility.” Id. at 335–36. Referencing\nDothard, the Court in Johnson Controls explained that “[s]ex\ndiscrimination was tolerated because sex was related to the\nguard’s ability to do the job—maintaining prison security.”\n499 U.S. at 202.\n\n    When justified under the circumstances, we and other\ncircuits similarly have upheld sex-based correctional officer\nassignments in women’s prisons. See Robino v. Iranon,\n145 F.3d 1109, 1110 (9th Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (BFOQ\ndesignation of six correctional officer positions at Hawaii\nwomen’s prison); Everson v. Mich. Dep’t of Corr., 391 F.3d\n737, 749–50 (6th Cir. 2004) (BFOQ designation of 250\ncorrectional officer positions at Michigan women’s prisons);\nTharp v. Iowa Dep’t of Corr., 68 F.3d 223, 224 (8th Cir.\n1995) (BFOQ designation of all correctional officer positions\nin women’s residential unit within a mixed-gender minimum\nsecurity prison); cf. Torres v. Wisc. Dep’t of Health and Soc.\nServs., 859 F.2d 1523, 1532 (7th Cir. 1988) (en banc) (noting\n\f16 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nthat prison officials are not required to provide “objective\nevidence, either from empirical studies or otherwise,” and\nremanding the denial of a BFOQ designation for evaluation\n“on the basis of the totality of the circumstances contained in\nthe entire record.”).\n\n    Although limited gender discrimination may be\npermissible in the prison employment context, prison\nadministrators do not get a free pass. The Department must\nhave an objective “basis in fact” for “its belief that gender\ndiscrimination is ‘reasonably necessary’—not merely\nreasonable or convenient—to the normal operation of its\nbusiness.” Everson, 391 F.3d at 748 (citing W. Air Lines, Inc.\nv. Criswell, 472 U.S. 400, 414 (1985)). This means prison\nadministrators “seeking to justify a BFOQ must show a high\ncorrelation between sex and ability to perform job functions.”\nBreiner, 610 F.3d at 1213 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). Speculation about gender roles is\ninsufficient—the evidence must demonstrate that prison\nadministrators had a “concrete, logical basis for concluding\nthat gender restrictions are reasonably necessary” and that\nalternatives to sex discrimination have been “reasonably\nconsidered and refuted.” Ambat, 757 F.3d at 1028 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n    An additional significant factor is at play: deference to\nprison officials. “Judgments by prison administrators that are\nthe product of a reasoned decision-making process, based on\navailable information and expertise, are entitled to some\ndeference.” Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1212 n.6 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see also Robino, 145 F.3d at 1110 (holding\nthat, where Hawaii prison administrators appointed a task\nforce to review prison policies, their “professional judgment\nis entitled to deference”).\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.     17\n\n    Although we have not offered up a cookbook for a\n“reasoned decision-making process,” cases that have invoked\nthe deference principle point to undertakings that address\nsystemic issues, consider outside views and data, and weigh\nreasonable alternatives. See Robino, 145 F.3d at 1111\n(deferring to Hawaii prison administrators who directed a\n“specially appointed task force” to study prison problems);\nEverson, 391 F.3d at 741–45 (deferring to Michigan prison\nadministrators where they conducted three studies, one\npursuant to a settlement with the Department of Justice). To\nbe sure, although studies and empirical data are indicia of a\ndeliberative approach, we have emphasized that “the\ndecision-making process supporting a discriminatory policy”\nneed not “take any particular form.” Ambat, 757 F.3d at\n1026. Deference is a threshold legal determination.\n\n    The Department’s exhaustive process fits well within the\nrubric of “reasoned decision making” and is entitled to\ndeference. After the Jane Doe prisoner class action was filed\nin 2007, the Department did not rush headlong into sex-based\nstaffing. Instead, it hired experts, consulted with other states,\nreviewed relevant caselaw, documented scores of sexual\nmisconduct allegations and investigated many more, and\nsought advice from the Human Rights Commission. Drawing\non its decades of experience, the state did not view sex-based\nstaffing as a panacea, instead proposing a package of reforms\nthat included measures such as applicant psychological\ntesting, sex-awareness training, and security cameras.\n\n    Teamsters argues that the Department implemented sex-\nbased staffing “during a time of Departmental crisis” and in\na “panic” that was little more than a “desperate attempt” to\nsettle the state court class action.            The Union’s\ncharacterization begs the question: If sordid details of sexual\n\f18 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nabuse and constitutional violations do not inspire a “crisis”\nand feelings of “panic,” then what does? The state shouldn’t\nbe demonized for kicking into gear to find a remedy for its\nlong-running challenges. In any event, our inquiry does not\nturn on the subjective state of mind of the Department’s\nleadership. The Department undertook a rigorous review of\nits staffing policies to address the issues raised in the report\nand the class action.\n\n    The Department’s thorough, thoughtful approach stands\nin stark contrast to the sheriff in Ambat, who rejected out of\nhand alternatives to discrimination—such as pre-hiring\nscreening, surveillance cameras, and training—and declined\nto order an internal investigation or hire outside consultants.\nSee 757 F.3d at 1022, 1026. The sheriff did not consult\ndeputies directly responsible for prisoner supervision or other\njurisdictions with similar policies, and no internal review\ndocumented the extent of misconduct. Id.\n\n    Ambat instructs that “[d]etermining whether a corrections\nofficial is entitled to deference is a fact-intensive and\ncase-specific inquiry” that is “generally within the discretion\nof the district court.” Id. at 1026. The district court found\nthat the Department’s process merited deference, and we see\nno reason to conclude otherwise. Accordingly, we give\n“some deference,” Robino, 145 F.3d at 1110, to Washington’s\nprison administrators, although we remain mindful of the\nantidiscrimination mandate of Title VII.\n\nIII.   THE PRISON POLICY AND BFOQ REQUIREMENTS\n\n   In 2009 the Department determined that designating 110\nfemale-only guard positions at the two prisons would\nsubstantially improve prison security, protect the privacy of\n\f      TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.      19\n\nfemale inmates, and prevent sexual assaults. Teamsters\nchallenges approximately sixty of those positions, which fall\ninto four general categories: medium- and high-security\nhousing units (18 positions); programs and activities\nsupervisors (3 positions); work crew supervisors (6\npositions); and relief posts to replace female guards who are\non breaks or absent from work (32 positions).4\n\n     The Union paints the Department staffing policy as\n“broad and overreaching”—a “blunderbuss approach to the\nissue.” The record demonstrates the opposite. Instead of a\nblanket ban on male prison personnel, the Department crafted\nthe staffing needs to fit each specific facility and guard post.\nIt targeted only guard assignments that require direct, day-to-\nday interaction with inmates and entail sensitive job\nresponsibilities such as conducting pat and strip searches and\nobserving inmates while they shower and use the restroom.\n\n    As the Union’s expert acknowledged, “[n]o remedy is\nperfect nor perfectly effective.” We couldn’t agree more.\nThis reality underscores the rationale for deference to prison\nadministrators and the hazard of nitpicking the state’s\nthoughtful response to deep-rooted problems in its women’s\nprisons.\n\n\n\n\n  4\n    The Union acknowledges that the remaining 50 positions—such as\nguard assignments in minimum-security housing units and those on the\ngraveyard shift, where repeated instances of sexual misconduct\noccurred—are properly designated as female-only.\n\f20 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n    A. The Department’s Policy Rationales Are\n       Reasonably Necessary to the Essence of Prison\n       Administration\n\n    At issue on appeal is whether the state established as a\nmatter of law that sex-based restrictions are “a bona fide\noccupational qualification reasonably necessary” to normal\nprison operations. Under the well-worn standard of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 56, we affirm the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment because there is “no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the [state] is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\nTeamsters failed to produce “specific facts showing there is\na genuine issue for trial” to survive summary judgment.\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986) (quoting\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).\n\n    Curiously, Teamsters did not offer specific testimony\nfrom its members, former guards, or others with actual\nknowledge of on-the-block operations at the prisons.\nAlthough Teamsters offered up the reports of two experts, in\nthe end their testimony does not create a material factual\nissue. For starters, the reports generally fail to address the\nspecific posts at issue. Instead, they rehash alternatives to\nsex-based staffing that were exhausted and rejected by prison\nadministrators or serve up proposals without any evidence of\nefficacy or practicality. Finally, the Union’s experts opine on\nthe interpretation of social science research that is not central\nto the state policy in any event.\n\n    Although the sexual assaults that spawned the Jane Doe\nclass action permeate this lawsuit, the state did not justify its\nBFOQ positions solely as a means to prevent sexual assaults.\nInstead, it identified several intertwined reasons for\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.    21\n\ndesignating the female-only positions. In the initial request\nto the Human Rights Commission, the Department cited the\nneed to “enhance the security of the prisons, safety of staff\nand offenders, and to protect the privacy and dignity of\nfemale offenders.” The Commission, in turn, concluded that\nabsent the BFOQ designations, the prison is “unable to ensure\na proper balance between security considerations and privacy\nrights of offenders” and endorsed the female job assignments\n“for the explicit purpose of ensuring privacy rights of female\noffenders.”\n\n    Not surprisingly, under our precedent all of these\ninterrelated objectives go to the heart of prison operations. In\nAmbat, we held that, as a matter of law, “protecting female\ninmates from sexual misconduct by male deputies,\nmaintaining jail security, [and] protecting inmate privacy”\nwere all reasonably necessary to the essence of prison\nadministration. 757 F.3d at 1027–28. The same holds true\nhere.\n\n    Security, of course, is the paramount concern of prison\nadministrators. As the Supreme Court has noted: “The\nessence of a correctional counselor’s job is to maintain prison\nsecurity.” Dothard, 433 U.S. at 335; see also Everson,\n391 F.3d at 753 (“Unquestionably, the security of the prisons\nrelates to the essence of [prison business].”). That maxim is\nno less true today. Security concerns are necessarily\nintertwined with prison programs and objectives.\n\n    Inmate privacy encompasses the inmate’s “interest in not\nbeing viewed unclothed by members of the opposite sex”—an\ninterest that “survives incarceration” despite prisoners’\ndiminished privacy expectations. See Robino, 145 F.3d at\n1111. In the same vein, inmates have a privacy interest in\n\f22 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nhaving non-emergency strip and pat searches—a pervasive\nfact of prison life—performed by guards of the same sex. See\nJordan, 986 F.2d at 1524; Tharp, 68 F.3d at 226.\n\n    Preventing sexual assaults is also a legitimate prison\nobjective. First and foremost, prison administrators have a\nhigh interest in shielding inmates from abusive and inherently\ncoercive encounters. Indeed, even allegations of sexual\nmisconduct can destabilize prison life: they can breed\nmistrust and damage morale among officers and prisoners;\ndrain prison resources; and undercut the effectiveness of male\nofficers with the looming threat of a career-ending\naccusation. See Robino, 145 F.3d at 1111 (discussing damage\nto prison morale caused by allegations of male staff sexual\nmisconduct); Everson, 391 F.3d at 753 (“[A]llegations of\nsexual abuse, whether true or not, create a ‘poisoned\natmosphere’ that breeds misconduct on the part of inmates\nand guards.”).\n\n    Amazingly, one of the Union’s experts offered the\nfollowing view:\n\n       Female inmates cannot be shielded from the\n       world in which we live. If they are to\n       reintegrate into society, they have to be taught\n       how to deal with abusive staff, male or\n       female. They have to be taught what\n       constitutes a healthy interaction and what does\n       not. They cannot learn those skills if they are\n       sheltered from contact with males in a\n       position of authority. ¶ Sexual abuse is\n       present in all areas of our society: in schools,\n       (at all levels), business, government, military\n       and families. Just as females have to be\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.     23\n\n        taught how to deal with those abuses in the\n        larger society, female inmates must be taught\n        as part of the rehabilitation process how to\n        deal with all abusive staff: males and females,\n        custody staff and civilian staff.\n\n    To state something so obvious we never imagined it\nwould need to be written: we reject any suggestion that\nfemale prisoners would benefit from being subjected to\nabusive prison guards as “part of the rehabilitation process”\nso that they may better “reintegrate into society.” See, e.g.,\nPrison Rape Elimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 15601(11)\n(“Victims of prison rape suffer severe physical and\npsychological effects that hinder their ability to integrate into\nthe community and maintain stable employment upon their\nrelease from prison.”).\n\n    We have little difficulty holding that the state’s reasons\nfor adopting the BFOQ designations—improving security,\nprotecting inmate privacy, and preventing sexual\nassaults—are each reasonably necessary to the essence of\noperating Washington’s women’s prisons. That conclusion\ndoes not end the analysis, however. The state also must\ndemonstrate that sex is a “legitimate proxy” to achieve one or\nmore of these goals, meaning that there is a “high correlation\nbetween sex and ability to perform job functions.” Breiner,\n610 F.3d at 1213 (quoting Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at\n202). In addition, the state must show that alternatives to the\nsex-based classification were “reasonably considered and\nrefuted.” Ambat, 757 F.3d at 1028.\n\n   Before addressing these remaining requirements in the\ncontext of specific positions, we consider Teamsters’\noverarching arguments that the staffing policy is based on\n\f24 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nstereotypes and that the state                  failed    to    consider\nnondiscriminatory alternatives.\n\n    Teamsters argues at length that the state policy is based\non an impermissible stereotype that male guards are more\nlikely to commit sexual misconduct than their female\ncounterparts. This stereotyping argument misses the mark.\nTo begin, the Union acknowledged that the policy was\nadopted in the face of documented allegations of abuse.5 The\nDepartment also did not rest on assumptions; it provided\nobjective legal and operational justifications for why only\nwomen can perform particular job functions, like observing\ninmates unclothed and conducting non-emergency searches.\n\n    We also reject Teamsters’ argument that the Department\ncould simply have hired new executives or reconfigured\nprison layouts. As our discussion of the day-to-day realities\nof the positions at issue demonstrates, neither of those\nalternatives actually addresses the specific operational\nchallenges of maintaining prison security, preserving\ninmates’ privacy, and stopping abuse.\n\n\n\n\n 5\n   Because the 2009 policy stemmed from a documented history of sexual\nmisconduct in Washington prisons, this case is distinguishable from\nBreiner. There, Nevada prison officials designated as female-only three\nupper-management positions based on the assumption that men were\n“incapable of adequately supervising front line staff in female prisons.”\n610 F.3d at 1213. The record disclosed no evidence that anyone in\nupper-management had ever abused an inmate. Id. at 1214. Here, by\ncontrast, the sex-based job assignments are all “front line” positions that\nrequire direct, day-to-day interaction with female inmates. Washington\nhas substantiated dozens of instances of sexual abuse implicating every\njob category at issue in this lawsuit.\n\f     TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.              25\n\n     B. Sex is an Objective, Verifiable Job Qualification\n        for the Designated Positions\n\n    We conclude that sex is an objective, verifiable job\nqualification for the posts designated as female-only by the\nDepartment and that the Department appropriately considered\nreasonable alternatives.\n\n         1. Housing Units\n\n    The staffing restriction with the “largest impact,”\naccording to the Union, involves 18 positions at the medium-\nand high-security housing units at Washington Corrections\nCenter.6 The housing units have two guards on duty on each\nshift. Unlike other states, the Department did not ban male\nguards entirely; rather, the staffing policy requires at least one\nfemale guard per shift, an approach recommended by one of\nthe state’s consultants.\n\n    In the housing units, correctional officers “must conduct\npat and strip searches of female offenders entering and\nleaving the facility” as well as frequent random and\nsuspicion-based searches within the housing units. In the\nsegregation and mental illness units, inmates are strip\nsearched every time they enter or leave their cells. Except in\nemergency circumstances, male guards cannot legally\nperform any of these searches. Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1523; see\nalso Wash. Rev. Code § 9.94A.631(2).\n\n\n\n 6\n    The Union concedes that positions in minimum-security housing units\nare properly designated female-only. Because Mission Creek is a\nminimum-security facility, the housing-unit positions at that prison are not\nat issue here.\n\f26 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n    Beyond searches, officers in the housing units also “may\nencounter female offenders in varying states of undress while\nshowering, toileting, and dressing.” Guards must collect\nurine samples from inmates, and a failure to “observ[e] the\noffenders during the entire process of urinalysis collection\nsignificantly impacts the reliability of the test results . . .”\nAccording to the state, “[m]ale staff cannot observe female\noffenders when they are engaged in these activities.”\n\n    Given these operational needs, there is no reasonable\nsubstitute for having female guards inside housings units,\naccording to the Department. Notably, temporarily removing\na female guard from another part of the prison to cover in a\nhousing unit “creates a gap for dealing with privacy issues at\nthe post vacated.” At best, that solution fixes one problem\nbut creates another.\n\n    The evidence Teamsters puts forward to counter the\nDepartment’s justifications is entirely inapposite. One of its\nexperts points out that sexual assault is not a severe problem\nin medium- and high-security housing because “as the level\nof security increases, the opportunity for sexual assault\ndecreases.” This may be true, but it fails to acknowledge that\nthe staffing decisions were designed to protect inmate\nprivacy, which is “essential to the operation of a corrections\nfacility and has been recognized as justifying facially\ndiscriminatory policies in other contexts.” Ambat, 757 F.3d\nat 1028. The Union’s other expert quarrels with citations to\nsocial science regarding female inmates’ privacy needs and\nmatters relating to sexual relationships between inmates and\nguards. This testimony again fails to raise any genuine\ndispute of material fact as to the Department’s reasoned\ndetermination that the realities of operating Washington’s\n\f     TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.           27\n\nwomen’s prisons necessitate designating these specific\npositions as female-only.\n\n     2. Programs and Activities\n\n    Programs and activities officers directly supervise inmate\nactivities such as educational and religious classes, gym,\ncrafts, and visitation hours. During these programs and\nactivities, inmates are searched at random and if suspected of\nhiding contraband. Guards must collect urine samples from\ninmates and at times relieve housing unit officers, which\nrequires “room checks” where they may “encounter female\noffenders in varying states of undress. . . .” These guards also\nsupervise visitation hours, after which 50% of inmates are pat\nsearched and 50% are strip searched. To fulfill these job\nfunctions, the state designated three programs and activities\npositions as female-only.\n\n    The Union’s proposed alternative to designating these\npositions as female-only is a return to the system employed\nfor the last two decades: dispatching female officers as\nrovers—or “response and movement” guards, in prison\nlingo—who could be paged when needed for searches.7 The\nUnion offers no data, expert testimony, or other evidence to\nsupport the efficacy of this approach. Instead, undisputed\nevidence established that the rover system was rife with\nproblems, to say the least. During this era, prison\nadministrators “shuttle[d] women staff from location to\nlocation throughout the prisons to perform essential security\n\n 7\n    Union expert Gladwin says the female-only designation of programs\nand activities posts is “arbitrary,” because the programs and activities\nofficer who supervises the bike program can be a male guard. That\nofficer, however, is not required to perform searches.\n\f28 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nprocedures, leaving other areas of the prison without\nappropriate staffing.” Wait times for searches lasted an hour\nor more. With female guards stretched thin, inmates went\nunsupervised showering, using the restroom, or\ndressing—raising security and safety risks. Superintendent\nEldon Vail testified that, before the BFOQ positions were\nimplemented, the prison functioned “in the broadest sense”\nbut the shortage of female guards restricted the prison’s\nability to deploy unannounced, random pat searches, an\nimportant tool in preventing the flow of contraband.\n\n    In light of this checkered history, the Union’s conclusory\nassertion that the Department successfully “managed [privacy\nand search] issues for at least two decades” rings hollow.\nFTC v. Publ’g Clearing House, Inc., 104 F.3d 1168, 1171\n(9th Cir. 1997) (“[C]onclusory, self-serving statements in\nappellate briefs . . . are insufficient to create a genuine issue\nof material fact.”).          We will not displace prison\nadministrators’ experience and expertise in favor of an\nalternative that boils down to the “same old, same old.” Cf.\nTorres, 859 F.2d at 1529 (“[P]rison administrators always\nhave been expected to innovate and experiment.” (citing\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 (1987) (prison\nadministrators must be allowed “to adopt innovative solutions\nto the intractable problems of prison administration”)).\n\n        3. Work Crews\n\n    Work crew officers escort groups of ten prisoners to off-\nsite work locations and supervise their workdays. Searches\nare again part and parcel of the job—comprising 70% of day-\nto-day responsibilities. Strip searches are required each time\nan inmate leaves and reenters the prison grounds. Before the\n2009 staffing policy, female officers had to be “pulled from\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.    29\n\nsomewhere else in the facility” to conduct these searches,\nwhich can “creat[e] [] a staff shortage in another area of the\nfacility” and pose “a potential security risk,” according to the\nHuman Rights Commission. During the workday, officers\nalso must accompany female inmates as they use the\nrestroom. The Department concluded that, because of these\njob responsibilities, it needed female officers alongside work\ncrews. The Department therefore designated six positions as\nfemale-only.\n\n    Nonetheless, with respect to work crews, the Union\nargues that the Department should merely station female\nguards at prison entry and exit points. If the need for a search\narises “while work is in progress, this would constitute an\n‘emergent’ search which is not prohibited for a male officer\nas a matter of law, policy or contract.” The Union produced\nno evidence or legal support for its emergency-search\nproposal. Even if the Department could disingenuously label\nevery work-site search as an emergency, the state’s interest is\nbroader than merely avoiding illegal searches. Having male\nofficers conduct pat searches under any non-emergency\ncircumstances is undesirable and harmful to prisoner privacy\nand security.\n\n    Staging female officers at entry and exit points also\nignores the state’s interest in preserving security during work\nassignments. The record showed that at least two inmates\nescaped from public bathrooms while on work crews, when\nthey were not watched by male guards and no female guards\nwere on hand. The Union does not explain, much less\nprovide evidence for, how its alternative proposal would\naddress concerns about on-the-job observation.\n\f30 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n       4. Relief Posts\n\n     Officers in the 32 relief positions substitute for female\nguards in female-only positions when they have a regular day\noff, are on vacation, or are out sick. The relief officers\nperform the job responsibilities described above in housing\nunits and elsewhere. As the Human Rights Commission put\nit, the relief positions “alleviate understaffing of female\nofficers, because a BFOQ position needs to be relieved by a\nBFOQ position.” In other words, if only male officers are\navailable to fill in for BFOQ positions, it undermines the\ndocumented need of making those positions female-only in\nthe first place.\n\n    According to the Union, 32 relief positions is too many,\nso the issue “must be reserved for trial because the Court\ncannot assess whether the relief sought was excessive without\nconducting a careful analysis of all such positions.” To\nsurvive summary judgment, however, the Union “may not\nmerely state that it will discredit the moving party’s evidence\nat trial and proceed in the hope that something can be\ndeveloped at trial in the way of evidence to support its claim.”\nT.W. Elec. Serv. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass’n, 809 F.2d\n626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987). Argument without evidence is\nhollow rhetoric that cannot defeat summary judgment.\n\n                        CONCLUSION\n\n    We affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment\nfor the state. The Washington Department’s creation of a\nnarrow category of female-only job assignments is a “bona\n\f     TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.           31\n\nfide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the\nnormal operation” of the women’s prisons.8\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n 8\n   In light of our holding that the positions are lawful BFOQs, we need\nnot decide whether the district court correctly granted summary judgment\non the alternative ground that the Union has not shown that any of its\nmembers suffered cognizable injury under Title VII.\n\f",

A primary driver, according to prison\nauthorities, was the lack of female correctional officers to\noversee female offenders and administer sensitive tasks, such\nas observing inmates showering and dressing and performing\nthe pat (or “pat-down”) and strip searches that are stitched\ninto the fabric of day-to-day prison life. After long wrestling\nwith this gender gap, the state undertook a comprehensive\nassessment and ultimately designated a limited number of\nfemale-only correctional positions—specifically, 110\npositions to patrol housing units, prison grounds, and work\nsites. The prison guards’ union, Teamsters Local No. 117\n\f4   TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n\n(“Teamsters” or the “Union”), challenged this practice,\nthough it acknowledges the legitimacy of 50 of the female-\nonly designations. This case juxtaposes the prison’s\npenological interests against male correctional officers who\nclaim the staffing policy discriminates against them on the\nbasis of sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e.\n\n    We conclude that the Washington Department of\nCorrections’ (the “Department” or the “state”) individualized,\nwell-researched decision to designate discrete sex-based\ncorrectional officer categories was justified because sex is a\nbona-fide occupational qualification (“BFOQ”) for those\npositions.          The Union’s thin evidentiary\nsubmissions—coupled with expert claims that were largely\nunsubstantiated or missed the point—failed to raise a material\nfactual issue. Indeed, the startling statement by one of the\nUnion’s experts underscores the legitimacy of the state’s\nefforts to combat sexual abuse: “Sexual abuse is present in all\nareas of our society. . .[F]emale inmates must be taught as\npart of the rehabilitation process to deal with all abusive staff:\nmales and females . . .” The Department was well-justified\nin concluding that rampant abuse should not be an accepted\npart of prison life and taking steps to protect the welfare of\ninmates under its care. We affirm the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the Department.\n\n                        BACKGROUND\n\n   The Department runs two women’s prisons. The\nWashington Corrections Center for Women in Gig Harbor\nhas a capacity of 738 inmates, although it is often\novercrowded. That prison runs the gamut from minimum\nsecurity facilities to housing for violent offenders and those\n\f     TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.              5\n\nwith mental health issues. It also houses Washington’s death\nrow for female prisoners. The second facility is Mission\nCreek Corrections Center for Women in Belfair, a smaller\nminimum-security prison that houses around 300 inmates.\n\n    For decades, men dominated the ranks of prison guards,\nthough neither party has provided precise figures. Facing a\nshortage of female guards in the late 1980s, state prison\nadministrators began allowing male guards to perform\nrandom, clothed body searches—commonly known as pat\nsearches—of the female inmates at Washington Corrections\nCenter. Female inmates challenged these cross-gender\nsearches as unconstitutional. The district court granted an\ninjunction and halted the practice. Sitting en banc, we\naffirmed, concluding that cross-gender body searches inflict\nunnecessary and wanton pain on female inmates, many of\nwhom have suffered a history of sexual abuse before\nincarceration, and, therefore, violate the Eighth Amendment.1\nJordan v.

Under both Jordan and a later-enacted Washington\nlaw, female correctional officers must perform all non-\nemergency pat searches of female inmates. Wash. Rev. Code\n§ 9.94A.631(2) (2012).\n\n    In the years following Jordan, the Department struggled\nwith the challenges posed by having an overwhelmingly male\nworkforce. In 1998, it asked the Washington Human Rights\nCommission (the “Commission”) for an opinion on proposed\ncorrectional assignments reserved exclusively for female\n\n\n\n  1\n    Experts in the case noted that 85% of female offenders reported a pre-\nincarceration history of sexual abuse.

The Commission did not favor the Department’s\napproach at that time.2\n\n    In 2003, Congress passed the Prison Rape Elimination\nAct, which included findings that, based upon experts’\nconservative estimates, 13% of prisoners had been sexually\nassaulted while in prison. See 42 U.S.C. § 15601. The\nlegislation also noted that many instances of abuse go\nunreported and prison personnel were inadequately trained to\ndeal with these issues. See id. §§ 15601–09. Under the Act,\nthe Department received a $1 million grant to hire two full-\ntime employees to investigate sexual misconduct allegations\nin prisons.\n\n    In the years that followed, the Department fielded\nwidespread allegations of sexual abuse in its women’s\nprisons. State officials, for example, substantiated 46\ninstances of misconduct in a single two-and-a-half-year\nstretch. In the aftermath, in 2007, female inmates brought a\nclass action in state court alleging misconduct at the\nWashington Corrections Center. The complaint detailed\nincidents where guards assaulted and fondled female inmates\nand forced them to perform oral sex and masturbate in the\npresence of male officers. Complaint, Jane Doe v. Clarke,\n\n\n\n    2\n        The Human Rights Commission, established in 1949, is the\nadministrative agency responsible for administering and enforcing the\nstate’s antidiscrimination laws. See Wash. Rev. Code § 49.60.120 (2007).\nThe Commission’s view is treated as an “advisory interpretative\nstatement” under Washington Revised Code Section 34.05.010(8). Before\nadopting female-only guard positions, the Department requested opinion\nletters from the Commission. Teamsters Local Union No. 117 v. State of\nWash.

July\n31, 2007).\n\n    Within a week of the filing of that lawsuit, the\nDepartment hired a consultant to investigate sexual activity\nand misconduct. After a four-month internal investigation,\nthe consultant detailed the facts in a 240-plus-page report.\nThe investigation included interviews with 72 “Jane Doe”\ninmates, who alleged that they faced sexual advances and\nharassment from prison guards. Among the lurid details,\nmale guards twice impregnated inmates and smuggled\ncontraband in exchange for sexual favors.\n\n    The Department also hired two additional consultants to\nreview prison practices. Marianne McNabb, of the Social\nResearch Institute based in Olympia, Washington, wrote:\n\n       Cross-sex supervision is currently one of the\n       most significant issues facing the\n       administration of women’s prisons. Today in\n       many states, over 50 percent of the custody\n       force in prisons for women are men. The fact\n       that so many women in prison have\n       experienced sexual abuse by men makes them\n       different from male prisoners who do not\n       share that history and therefore do not\n       experience the same level of anxiety or\n       violation as do women, when under the\n       custody or supervision of an officer of the\n       opposite sex.\n\n    McNabb noted that several jurisdictions, including Idaho\nand Michigan, “have established sex-specific posts in female\ninstitutions” in response to these dynamics. Her report\n\f8   TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n\nconcluded, “While this may seem to be a solution for many\nof the concerns identified, this practice is generally not fully\nunderstood or accepted by staff and has faced some legal\nchallenges.”\n\n    Donald Kelchner, superintendent of the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Corrections, urged the Department to adopt a\nhost of reforms, including guard assignments reserved\nspecifically for women.          In particular, Kelchner\nrecommended that the state ensure any double-staffed\nhousing units have at least one female guard. Kelchner\nconcluded, “It is more desirable in an institution housing\nfemales to have a higher number of female staff, to work with\nand supervise the inmates.”\n\n    Following the expert recommendations, the Department\nin January 2008 implemented an array of reforms to “reduce\nprison sexual assaults and related behavior.” Those efforts\nincluded aggressive recruitment of female prison guards;\npre-hiring psychological testing; training programs to\nenhance “gender awareness”; and the installation of privacy\ncurtains, security cameras, and restricted access entry cards.\n\n    Then, in May 2008, prison administrators again requested\nguidance from the Commission on the Department’s\nproposed 110 female-only guard post assignments at the two\nprisons. The Department submitted a tailored request for\neach post, explaining the job responsibilities and why the\npositions needed a female officer. The state told the\nCommission that “[i]ncreasing the number of female staff\nwill reduce the risk of sexual misconduct, reduce allegations\nof sexual misconduct, and protect male staff exposed to\nvulnerable situations” and unfounded complaints of abuse.\nThe state also emphasized the privacy requirements of female\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.    9\n\ninmates and the operational need to have female officers on\nhand to perform necessary searches and other tasks. The\nrequested staffing changes, according to the state, would\n“ensure the security of the prisons, safety of incarcerated\noffenders, and protection of the privacy and dignity of female\noffenders.”\n\n    After touring the prisons, interviewing administrators, and\ncollecting detailed documentation, the Commission in\nFebruary 2009 approved the Department’s request for all 110\npositions. The Commission offered Teamsters the chance to\nprovide input but none was forthcoming. The Commission\ndetermined that, with the then-existing staff makeup at the\nprisons, the state was “unable to ensure a proper balance\nbetween security considerations and the privacy rights of\noffenders” and that there were no reasonable alternatives to\nsex-based staffing.\n\n    The class action settled soon after. As part of the\nsettlement agreement, the Department agreed to enforce a\n“zero tolerance” policy regarding sexual misconduct, not to\nrehire five male correctional officers accused of abuse, and to\nsubmit regular reports on staff misconduct in women’s\nprisons. The settlement also included an undisclosed payout\nto abused prisoners. Stipulation and Proposed Order, Jane\nDoe v. Clarke, No. 07-2-01513-0, Dkt. No. 170 (Thurston Co.\nSuper. Ct. Aug. 6, 2010).\n\n    The Department’s reprieve from the courtroom did not\nlast long. In September 2011, Teamsters, which represents\nsome 6,000 state correctional workers, filed this federal\nlawsuit, alleging that the sex-based staffing policy\n\f10 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nimplemented in 2009 violates the civil rights of male prison\nguards.3\n\n    At the conclusion of discovery, the district court granted\nsummary judgment for the state.

Wash. Apr. 8, 2013). The district court first\nfound that the Union had failed to demonstrate the type of\n“cognizable injury” required to trigger Title VII liability. The\ncourt noted that the record developed by Teamsters included\nonly “hypothetical evidence” of the damages its members\nwould face, thus entitling the state to summary judgment. Id.\nat *4. Alternatively, the district court also granted summary\njudgment for the state on the question of sex discrimination.\nAs an initial matter, the district court ruled that judicial\ndeference to state prison officials was warranted. Id. The\ncourt concluded that, although there may have been factual\nquestions on whether female guards were needed inside the\nhousing units to prevent sexual assaults, the staffing policy\nwas justified as a BFOQ to protect the privacy of inmates for\neach job category. Id. at 5–9.\n\n                               ANALYSIS\n\nI. STANDING\n\n   This case is a cautionary tale about the threshold\nimportance of standing. The state argues, for the first time on\n\n\n  3\n    Teamsters also represents female correctional officers. The Union\nasserts in its brief that the female-only correction positions result in “an\nincrease in mandatory overtime” for female guards. The Union presented\nno evidence to support that contention. Our analysis therefore focuses on\nthe male guards.\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.   11\n\nappeal, and after receiving Teamsters’ opening brief, that the\nUnion lacks standing because it produced no evidence that\nany of its members suffered concrete injury. The issue is not,\nas Teamsters urges, whether the question was addressed by\nthe district court; rather, as a jurisdictional matter, “a\nchallenge to constitutional standing is one which we are\nrequired to consider” apart from whether it was argued or\naddressed below.

In other words, the Union “must show that a\nmember suffers an injury-in-fact that is traceable to the\ndefendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.”\nId.\n\n    The complaint posited varied theories of injury: male\nguards were forced to transfer jobs and prisons; suffered lost\nearnings, including overtime pay; were laid off; and\nexperienced “loss of status, diminished sense of self-worth,\nanxiety, emotional distress, embarrassment, humiliation,\nmental anguish, and other related damages.” Surprisingly,\nproof of these general allegations did not materialize as\n\f12 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nevidence. The Union’s submissions on summary judgment\nare thin, at best, in terms of identifying one or more specific\nmembers who suffered injury. Ironically, it is the testimony\nthe Union elicited from the state that provides the strongest\nsupport for the Teamsters’ constitutional standing.\nThroughout discovery, the state did not dispute the general\nallegations that its staffing policy resulted in the transfer of\nmale guards and lost overtime opportunities. While no\nevidence linked a specific officer with a discrete wage loss,\nSuperintendent Doug Cole indicated that six male officers\nhad been displaced from their regular shifts—mentioning two\nby name—and agreed with the Union’s lawyer that, with\nrespect to male correctional officers, the staffing changes\nwould result in “some reduction in their overtime opportunity\n. . .” Every male correctional officer who was displaced from\nhis regular shift, however, was offered a position on a\ndifferent shift.\n\n     As the state points out, when a challenge to standing is\nraised at summary judgment, a plaintiff organization must\n“submit competent evidence, not mere allegations, to\ndemonstrate that at least one of its members had standing.”\nAssociated General, 713 F.3d at 1194. This is a settled\nproposition, though curiously the state never moved for\nsummary judgment on standing nor contested the Union’s\nstanding allegations. Nonetheless, a party is not excused\nfrom establishing standing simply because the opposing party\ndid not tumble to the issue until the appeals stage. See Gest\nv.

In\nthe affidavits, male correctional officers assert that they have\nsuffered precisely the types of harm that the state\nacknowledged in discovery—most importantly, lost overtime.\n\n    Although the Union hardly made a slam-dunk showing of\nprospective harm, the record as supplemented on appeal\nreflects the bare minimum necessary to satisfy the threshold\nrequirement of standing.

TITLE VII AND THE BONA FIDE OCCUPATIONAL\n    QUALIFICATION\n\n    Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits\nemployment practices that discriminate on the basis of race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2.\nNevertheless, a facially discriminatory employment practice,\nsuch as the sex-based hiring practice we have here, may pass\n\f14 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nlegal muster if sex is a bona fide occupational qualification or\nBFOQ. That narrow exception—found in § 2000e-2(e)(1)—\nprovides:\n\n       [I]t shall not be an unlawful employment\n       practice for an employer to hire and employ\n       employees . . . on the basis of . . . sex . . .\n       where . . . sex . . . is a bona fide occupational\n       qualification reasonably necessary to the\n       normal operation of that particular business or\n       enterprise.\n\n    The Supreme Court has emphasized that “[t]he BFOQ\ndefense is written narrowly, and this Court has read it\nnarrowly.” UAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112563\"><a href=\"/opinion/112563/automobile-workers-v-johnson-controls-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201\n(1991). The BFOQ defense applies to “special situations”\nwhere employment discrimination is based upon “objective,\nverifiable requirements” that “concern job-related skills and\naptitudes.” Id. An “occupational qualification” means a\n“qualification[] that affect[s] an employee’s ability to do the\njob.” Id.\n\n    Under our precedent, the BFOQ defense “may be invoked\nonly when the essence of the business operation would be\nundermined by hiring individuals of both sexes.” Breiner v.\nNev.

To justify discrimination under the BFOQ\nexception, an employer must show, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that: (1) the “job qualification justifying the\ndiscrimination is reasonably necessary to the essence of its\nbusiness”; and (2) that “sex is a legitimate proxy for\ndetermining” whether a correctional officer has the necessary\njob qualifications.

In many industries, it is difficult to\nimagine any jobs that would qualify as BFOQs. However, the\n“unique context of prison employment,” id. at 1028, is one\narea where courts have found sex-based classifications\njustified. The Supreme Court directly addressed the prison\nenvironment in just one case, Dothard v. Rawlinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109725\"><a href=\"/opinion/109725/dothard-v-rawlinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1977). The Court held that, in the context of a\nmaximum-security facility “where violence is the order of the\nday” and sex offenders were interspersed with other\nprisoners, a female guard’s sex may “undermine her capacity\nto provide the security that is the essence of a correctional\ncounselor’s responsibility.” Id. at 335–36.

Speculation about gender roles is\ninsufficient—the evidence must demonstrate that prison\nadministrators had a “concrete, logical basis for concluding\nthat gender restrictions are reasonably necessary” and that\nalternatives to sex discrimination have been “reasonably\nconsidered and refuted.” Ambat, 757 F.3d at 1028 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n    An additional significant factor is at play: deference to\nprison officials. “Judgments by prison administrators that are\nthe product of a reasoned decision-making process, based on\navailable information and expertise, are entitled to some\ndeference.” Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1212 n.6 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see also Robino, 145 F.3d at 1110 (holding\nthat, where Hawaii prison administrators appointed a task\nforce to review prison policies, their “professional judgment\nis entitled to deference”).\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.     17\n\n    Although we have not offered up a cookbook for a\n“reasoned decision-making process,” cases that have invoked\nthe deference principle point to undertakings that address\nsystemic issues, consider outside views and data, and weigh\nreasonable alternatives. See Robino, 145 F.3d at 1111\n(deferring to Hawaii prison administrators who directed a\n“specially appointed task force” to study prison problems);\nEverson, 391 F.3d at 741–45 (deferring to Michigan prison\nadministrators where they conducted three studies, one\npursuant to a settlement with the Department of Justice). To\nbe sure, although studies and empirical data are indicia of a\ndeliberative approach, we have emphasized that “the\ndecision-making process supporting a discriminatory policy”\nneed not “take any particular form.” Ambat, 757 F.3d at\n1026. Deference is a threshold legal determination.\n\n    The Department’s exhaustive process fits well within the\nrubric of “reasoned decision making” and is entitled to\ndeference. After the Jane Doe prisoner class action was filed\nin 2007, the Department did not rush headlong into sex-based\nstaffing. Instead, it hired experts, consulted with other states,\nreviewed relevant caselaw, documented scores of sexual\nmisconduct allegations and investigated many more, and\nsought advice from the Human Rights Commission. Drawing\non its decades of experience, the state did not view sex-based\nstaffing as a panacea, instead proposing a package of reforms\nthat included measures such as applicant psychological\ntesting, sex-awareness training, and security cameras.\n\n    Teamsters argues that the Department implemented sex-\nbased staffing “during a time of Departmental crisis” and in\na “panic” that was little more than a “desperate attempt” to\nsettle the state court class action.            The Union’s\ncharacterization begs the question: If sordid details of sexual\n\f18 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nabuse and constitutional violations do not inspire a “crisis”\nand feelings of “panic,” then what does? The state shouldn’t\nbe demonized for kicking into gear to find a remedy for its\nlong-running challenges. In any event, our inquiry does not\nturn on the subjective state of mind of the Department’s\nleadership. The Department undertook a rigorous review of\nits staffing policies to address the issues raised in the report\nand the class action.\n\n    The Department’s thorough, thoughtful approach stands\nin stark contrast to the sheriff in Ambat, who rejected out of\nhand alternatives to discrimination—such as pre-hiring\nscreening, surveillance cameras, and training—and declined\nto order an internal investigation or hire outside consultants.\nSee 757 F.3d at 1022, 1026. The sheriff did not consult\ndeputies directly responsible for prisoner supervision or other\njurisdictions with similar policies, and no internal review\ndocumented the extent of misconduct. Id.\n\n    Ambat instructs that “[d]etermining whether a corrections\nofficial is entitled to deference is a fact-intensive and\ncase-specific inquiry” that is “generally within the discretion\nof the district court.” Id. at 1026. The district court found\nthat the Department’s process merited deference, and we see\nno reason to conclude otherwise. Accordingly, we give\n“some deference,” Robino, 145 F.3d at 1110, to Washington’s\nprison administrators, although we remain mindful of the\nantidiscrimination mandate of Title VII.\n\nIII.   THE PRISON POLICY AND BFOQ REQUIREMENTS\n\n   In 2009 the Department determined that designating 110\nfemale-only guard positions at the two prisons would\nsubstantially improve prison security, protect the privacy of\n\f      TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.      19\n\nfemale inmates, and prevent sexual assaults. Teamsters\nchallenges approximately sixty of those positions, which fall\ninto four general categories: medium- and high-security\nhousing units (18 positions); programs and activities\nsupervisors (3 positions); work crew supervisors (6\npositions); and relief posts to replace female guards who are\non breaks or absent from work (32 positions).4\n\n     The Union paints the Department staffing policy as\n“broad and overreaching”—a “blunderbuss approach to the\nissue.” The record demonstrates the opposite. Instead of a\nblanket ban on male prison personnel, the Department crafted\nthe staffing needs to fit each specific facility and guard post.\nIt targeted only guard assignments that require direct, day-to-\nday interaction with inmates and entail sensitive job\nresponsibilities such as conducting pat and strip searches and\nobserving inmates while they shower and use the restroom.\n\n    As the Union’s expert acknowledged, “[n]o remedy is\nperfect nor perfectly effective.” We couldn’t agree more.\nThis reality underscores the rationale for deference to prison\nadministrators and the hazard of nitpicking the state’s\nthoughtful response to deep-rooted problems in its women’s\nprisons.\n\n\n\n\n  4\n    The Union acknowledges that the remaining 50 positions—such as\nguard assignments in minimum-security housing units and those on the\ngraveyard shift, where repeated instances of sexual misconduct\noccurred—are properly designated as female-only.\n\f20 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n    A. The Department’s Policy Rationales Are\n       Reasonably Necessary to the Essence of Prison\n       Administration\n\n    At issue on appeal is whether the state established as a\nmatter of law that sex-based restrictions are “a bona fide\noccupational qualification reasonably necessary” to normal\nprison operations. Under the well-worn standard of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 56, we affirm the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment because there is “no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the [state] is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\nTeamsters failed to produce “specific facts showing there is\na genuine issue for trial” to survive summary judgment.\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324 (1986) (quoting\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).\n\n    Curiously, Teamsters did not offer specific testimony\nfrom its members, former guards, or others with actual\nknowledge of on-the-block operations at the prisons.\nAlthough Teamsters offered up the reports of two experts, in\nthe end their testimony does not create a material factual\nissue. For starters, the reports generally fail to address the\nspecific posts at issue. Instead, they rehash alternatives to\nsex-based staffing that were exhausted and rejected by prison\nadministrators or serve up proposals without any evidence of\nefficacy or practicality. Finally, the Union’s experts opine on\nthe interpretation of social science research that is not central\nto the state policy in any event.\n\n    Although the sexual assaults that spawned the Jane Doe\nclass action permeate this lawsuit, the state did not justify its\nBFOQ positions solely as a means to prevent sexual assaults.\nInstead, it identified several intertwined reasons for\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.    21\n\ndesignating the female-only positions. In the initial request\nto the Human Rights Commission, the Department cited the\nneed to “enhance the security of the prisons, safety of staff\nand offenders, and to protect the privacy and dignity of\nfemale offenders.” The Commission, in turn, concluded that\nabsent the BFOQ designations, the prison is “unable to ensure\na proper balance between security considerations and privacy\nrights of offenders” and endorsed the female job assignments\n“for the explicit purpose of ensuring privacy rights of female\noffenders.”\n\n    Not surprisingly, under our precedent all of these\ninterrelated objectives go to the heart of prison operations. In\nAmbat, we held that, as a matter of law, “protecting female\ninmates from sexual misconduct by male deputies,\nmaintaining jail security, [and] protecting inmate privacy”\nwere all reasonably necessary to the essence of prison\nadministration. 757 F.3d at 1027–28. The same holds true\nhere.\n\n    Security, of course, is the paramount concern of prison\nadministrators. As the Supreme Court has noted: “The\nessence of a correctional counselor’s job is to maintain prison\nsecurity.” Dothard, 433 U.S. at 335; see also Everson,\n391 F.3d at 753 (“Unquestionably, the security of the prisons\nrelates to the essence of [prison business].”). That maxim is\nno less true today. Security concerns are necessarily\nintertwined with prison programs and objectives.\n\n    Inmate privacy encompasses the inmate’s “interest in not\nbeing viewed unclothed by members of the opposite sex”—an\ninterest that “survives incarceration” despite prisoners’\ndiminished privacy expectations. See Robino, 145 F.3d at\n1111. In the same vein, inmates have a privacy interest in\n\f22 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nhaving non-emergency strip and pat searches—a pervasive\nfact of prison life—performed by guards of the same sex. See\nJordan, 986 F.2d at 1524; Tharp, 68 F.3d at 226.\n\n    Preventing sexual assaults is also a legitimate prison\nobjective. First and foremost, prison administrators have a\nhigh interest in shielding inmates from abusive and inherently\ncoercive encounters. Indeed, even allegations of sexual\nmisconduct can destabilize prison life: they can breed\nmistrust and damage morale among officers and prisoners;\ndrain prison resources; and undercut the effectiveness of male\nofficers with the looming threat of a career-ending\naccusation. See Robino, 145 F.3d at 1111 (discussing damage\nto prison morale caused by allegations of male staff sexual\nmisconduct); Everson, 391 F.3d at 753 (“[A]llegations of\nsexual abuse, whether true or not, create a ‘poisoned\natmosphere’ that breeds misconduct on the part of inmates\nand guards.”).\n\n    Amazingly, one of the Union’s experts offered the\nfollowing view:\n\n       Female inmates cannot be shielded from the\n       world in which we live. If they are to\n       reintegrate into society, they have to be taught\n       how to deal with abusive staff, male or\n       female. They have to be taught what\n       constitutes a healthy interaction and what does\n       not. They cannot learn those skills if they are\n       sheltered from contact with males in a\n       position of authority. ¶ Sexual abuse is\n       present in all areas of our society: in schools,\n       (at all levels), business, government, military\n       and families. Just as females have to be\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.     23\n\n        taught how to deal with those abuses in the\n        larger society, female inmates must be taught\n        as part of the rehabilitation process how to\n        deal with all abusive staff: males and females,\n        custody staff and civilian staff.\n\n    To state something so obvious we never imagined it\nwould need to be written: we reject any suggestion that\nfemale prisoners would benefit from being subjected to\nabusive prison guards as “part of the rehabilitation process”\nso that they may better “reintegrate into society.” See, e.g.,\nPrison Rape Elimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 15601(11)\n(“Victims of prison rape suffer severe physical and\npsychological effects that hinder their ability to integrate into\nthe community and maintain stable employment upon their\nrelease from prison.”).\n\n    We have little difficulty holding that the state’s reasons\nfor adopting the BFOQ designations—improving security,\nprotecting inmate privacy, and preventing sexual\nassaults—are each reasonably necessary to the essence of\noperating Washington’s women’s prisons. That conclusion\ndoes not end the analysis, however. The state also must\ndemonstrate that sex is a “legitimate proxy” to achieve one or\nmore of these goals, meaning that there is a “high correlation\nbetween sex and ability to perform job functions.” Breiner,\n610 F.3d at 1213 (quoting Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at\n202). In addition, the state must show that alternatives to the\nsex-based classification were “reasonably considered and\nrefuted.” Ambat, 757 F.3d at 1028.\n\n   Before addressing these remaining requirements in the\ncontext of specific positions, we consider Teamsters’\noverarching arguments that the staffing policy is based on\n\f24 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nstereotypes and that the state                  failed    to    consider\nnondiscriminatory alternatives.\n\n    Teamsters argues at length that the state policy is based\non an impermissible stereotype that male guards are more\nlikely to commit sexual misconduct than their female\ncounterparts. This stereotyping argument misses the mark.\nTo begin, the Union acknowledged that the policy was\nadopted in the face of documented allegations of abuse.5 The\nDepartment also did not rest on assumptions; it provided\nobjective legal and operational justifications for why only\nwomen can perform particular job functions, like observing\ninmates unclothed and conducting non-emergency searches.\n\n    We also reject Teamsters’ argument that the Department\ncould simply have hired new executives or reconfigured\nprison layouts. As our discussion of the day-to-day realities\nof the positions at issue demonstrates, neither of those\nalternatives actually addresses the specific operational\nchallenges of maintaining prison security, preserving\ninmates’ privacy, and stopping abuse.\n\n\n\n\n 5\n   Because the 2009 policy stemmed from a documented history of sexual\nmisconduct in Washington prisons, this case is distinguishable from\nBreiner. There, Nevada prison officials designated as female-only three\nupper-management positions based on the assumption that men were\n“incapable of adequately supervising front line staff in female prisons.”\n610 F.3d at 1213. The record disclosed no evidence that anyone in\nupper-management had ever abused an inmate. Id. at 1214. Here, by\ncontrast, the sex-based job assignments are all “front line” positions that\nrequire direct, day-to-day interaction with female inmates. Washington\nhas substantiated dozens of instances of sexual abuse implicating every\njob category at issue in this lawsuit.\n\f     TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.              25\n\n     B. Sex is an Objective, Verifiable Job Qualification\n        for the Designated Positions\n\n    We conclude that sex is an objective, verifiable job\nqualification for the posts designated as female-only by the\nDepartment and that the Department appropriately considered\nreasonable alternatives.\n\n         1. Housing Units\n\n    The staffing restriction with the “largest impact,”\naccording to the Union, involves 18 positions at the medium-\nand high-security housing units at Washington Corrections\nCenter.6 The housing units have two guards on duty on each\nshift. Unlike other states, the Department did not ban male\nguards entirely; rather, the staffing policy requires at least one\nfemale guard per shift, an approach recommended by one of\nthe state’s consultants.\n\n    In the housing units, correctional officers “must conduct\npat and strip searches of female offenders entering and\nleaving the facility” as well as frequent random and\nsuspicion-based searches within the housing units. In the\nsegregation and mental illness units, inmates are strip\nsearched every time they enter or leave their cells. Except in\nemergency circumstances, male guards cannot legally\nperform any of these searches. Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1523; see\nalso Wash. Rev. Code § 9.94A.631(2).\n\n\n\n 6\n    The Union concedes that positions in minimum-security housing units\nare properly designated female-only. Because Mission Creek is a\nminimum-security facility, the housing-unit positions at that prison are not\nat issue here.\n\f26 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n    Beyond searches, officers in the housing units also “may\nencounter female offenders in varying states of undress while\nshowering, toileting, and dressing.” Guards must collect\nurine samples from inmates, and a failure to “observ[e] the\noffenders during the entire process of urinalysis collection\nsignificantly impacts the reliability of the test results . . .”\nAccording to the state, “[m]ale staff cannot observe female\noffenders when they are engaged in these activities.”\n\n    Given these operational needs, there is no reasonable\nsubstitute for having female guards inside housings units,\naccording to the Department. Notably, temporarily removing\na female guard from another part of the prison to cover in a\nhousing unit “creates a gap for dealing with privacy issues at\nthe post vacated.” At best, that solution fixes one problem\nbut creates another.\n\n    The evidence Teamsters puts forward to counter the\nDepartment’s justifications is entirely inapposite. One of its\nexperts points out that sexual assault is not a severe problem\nin medium- and high-security housing because “as the level\nof security increases, the opportunity for sexual assault\ndecreases.” This may be true, but it fails to acknowledge that\nthe staffing decisions were designed to protect inmate\nprivacy, which is “essential to the operation of a corrections\nfacility and has been recognized as justifying facially\ndiscriminatory policies in other contexts.” Ambat, 757 F.3d\nat 1028. The Union’s other expert quarrels with citations to\nsocial science regarding female inmates’ privacy needs and\nmatters relating to sexual relationships between inmates and\nguards. This testimony again fails to raise any genuine\ndispute of material fact as to the Department’s reasoned\ndetermination that the realities of operating Washington’s\n\f     TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.           27\n\nwomen’s prisons necessitate designating these specific\npositions as female-only.\n\n     2. Programs and Activities\n\n    Programs and activities officers directly supervise inmate\nactivities such as educational and religious classes, gym,\ncrafts, and visitation hours. During these programs and\nactivities, inmates are searched at random and if suspected of\nhiding contraband. Guards must collect urine samples from\ninmates and at times relieve housing unit officers, which\nrequires “room checks” where they may “encounter female\noffenders in varying states of undress. . . .” These guards also\nsupervise visitation hours, after which 50% of inmates are pat\nsearched and 50% are strip searched. To fulfill these job\nfunctions, the state designated three programs and activities\npositions as female-only.\n\n    The Union’s proposed alternative to designating these\npositions as female-only is a return to the system employed\nfor the last two decades: dispatching female officers as\nrovers—or “response and movement” guards, in prison\nlingo—who could be paged when needed for searches.7 The\nUnion offers no data, expert testimony, or other evidence to\nsupport the efficacy of this approach. Instead, undisputed\nevidence established that the rover system was rife with\nproblems, to say the least. During this era, prison\nadministrators “shuttle[d] women staff from location to\nlocation throughout the prisons to perform essential security\n\n 7\n    Union expert Gladwin says the female-only designation of programs\nand activities posts is “arbitrary,” because the programs and activities\nofficer who supervises the bike program can be a male guard. That\nofficer, however, is not required to perform searches.\n\f28 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nprocedures, leaving other areas of the prison without\nappropriate staffing.” Wait times for searches lasted an hour\nor more. With female guards stretched thin, inmates went\nunsupervised showering, using the restroom, or\ndressing—raising security and safety risks. Superintendent\nEldon Vail testified that, before the BFOQ positions were\nimplemented, the prison functioned “in the broadest sense”\nbut the shortage of female guards restricted the prison’s\nability to deploy unannounced, random pat searches, an\nimportant tool in preventing the flow of contraband.\n\n    In light of this checkered history, the Union’s conclusory\nassertion that the Department successfully “managed [privacy\nand search] issues for at least two decades” rings hollow.\nFTC v.

We will not displace prison\nadministrators’ experience and expertise in favor of an\nalternative that boils down to the “same old, same old.” Cf.\nTorres, 859 F.2d at 1529 (“[P]rison administrators always\nhave been expected to innovate and experiment.” (citing\nTurner v.

Work Crews\n\n    Work crew officers escort groups of ten prisoners to off-\nsite work locations and supervise their workdays. Searches\nare again part and parcel of the job—comprising 70% of day-\nto-day responsibilities. Strip searches are required each time\nan inmate leaves and reenters the prison grounds. Before the\n2009 staffing policy, female officers had to be “pulled from\n\f    TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.    29\n\nsomewhere else in the facility” to conduct these searches,\nwhich can “creat[e] [] a staff shortage in another area of the\nfacility” and pose “a potential security risk,” according to the\nHuman Rights Commission. During the workday, officers\nalso must accompany female inmates as they use the\nrestroom. The Department concluded that, because of these\njob responsibilities, it needed female officers alongside work\ncrews. The Department therefore designated six positions as\nfemale-only.\n\n    Nonetheless, with respect to work crews, the Union\nargues that the Department should merely station female\nguards at prison entry and exit points. If the need for a search\narises “while work is in progress, this would constitute an\n‘emergent’ search which is not prohibited for a male officer\nas a matter of law, policy or contract.” The Union produced\nno evidence or legal support for its emergency-search\nproposal. Even if the Department could disingenuously label\nevery work-site search as an emergency, the state’s interest is\nbroader than merely avoiding illegal searches. Having male\nofficers conduct pat searches under any non-emergency\ncircumstances is undesirable and harmful to prisoner privacy\nand security.\n\n    Staging female officers at entry and exit points also\nignores the state’s interest in preserving security during work\nassignments. The record showed that at least two inmates\nescaped from public bathrooms while on work crews, when\nthey were not watched by male guards and no female guards\nwere on hand. The Union does not explain, much less\nprovide evidence for, how its alternative proposal would\naddress concerns about on-the-job observation.\n\f30 TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH. DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n       4. Relief Posts\n\n     Officers in the 32 relief positions substitute for female\nguards in female-only positions when they have a regular day\noff, are on vacation, or are out sick. The relief officers\nperform the job responsibilities described above in housing\nunits and elsewhere. As the Human Rights Commission put\nit, the relief positions “alleviate understaffing of female\nofficers, because a BFOQ position needs to be relieved by a\nBFOQ position.” In other words, if only male officers are\navailable to fill in for BFOQ positions, it undermines the\ndocumented need of making those positions female-only in\nthe first place.\n\n    According to the Union, 32 relief positions is too many,\nso the issue “must be reserved for trial because the Court\ncannot assess whether the relief sought was excessive without\nconducting a careful analysis of all such positions.” To\nsurvive summary judgment, however, the Union “may not\nmerely state that it will discredit the moving party’s evidence\nat trial and proceed in the hope that something can be\ndeveloped at trial in the way of evidence to support its claim.”\nT.W.

Argument without evidence is\nhollow rhetoric that cannot defeat summary judgment.\n\n                        CONCLUSION\n\n    We affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment\nfor the state. The Washington Department’s creation of a\nnarrow category of female-only job assignments is a “bona\n\f     TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 117 V. WASH.
