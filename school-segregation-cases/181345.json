In 1978, the Court entered a\n\nconsent decree pursuant to which defendants agreed that plaintiffs’ constitutional rights had been\n\nviolated and that they would take certain actions to remedy those violations.1 A series of consent\n\norders and remedial plans followed in which defendants admitted that they were still violating\n\nclass members’ constitutional rights and agreed to take additional actions to remedy those\n\nconstitutional violations. The last such consent order and remedial plan was entered into in\n\n\n       1\n        Plaintiffs are a class of former residents of Forest Haven. As of December 2009, there\nwere 600 class members (see Court Monitor Report at 2, Dec. 10, 2009); the original class has\ndecreased due to the deaths of class members. The sole remaining defendants are the District of\nColumbia (“the District”) and the Mayor Adrian Fenty (collectively “the District” or\n“defendants”). The United States is also a party, having been permitted to intervene as a plaintiff\nin January 1977.\n\f2001, when the parties jointly agreed to a Plan for Compliance, pursuant to which defendants\n\ncould demonstrate compliance with the Court’s orders and terminate the litigation.\n\n        In 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion to find defendants in noncompliance and to appoint a\n\nreceiver. On March 30, 2007, the Court granted that motion in part, concluding, based on\n\nextensive factual findings, that there had been “systemic, continuous, and serious noncompliance\n\nwith many of the Court’s Orders.” Evans v. Fenty, 480 F. Supp. 2d 280, 325 (D.D.C. 2007)\n\n(“March 2007 Liability Opinion”). With respect to remedy, the Court asked the Special Masters\n\nto assist by making findings and recommendations to the Court that address, inter alia, “the\n\ncurrent status of defendants’ compliance, what are the available options for curing the identified\n\ndeficiencies, and whether a receivership is the most effective and efficient remedy available to\n\nthe Court.” Id. at 326.\n\n       Now before the Court is the Special Masters’ Report and Recommendation, which\n\nconcludes that, as of December 2008, defendants were still in noncompliance with the Court’s\n\norders and recommends the appointment of an “Independent Compliance Administrator” to bring\n\ndefendants into compliance and to end to this litigation. (Special Masters’ Report and\n\nRecommendation Regarding A Remedy For Defendants’ Noncompliance With Court Orders at\n\n128, Aug. 14, 2009 [“2009 Special Masters’ Report”].) Defendants have filed limited objections\n\nto the report and oppose the imposition of the proposed remedy;2 plaintiffs have no objections to\n\n\n       2\n        However, on March 29, 2010 – only a matter of days before the issuance of this\nMemorandum Opinion – defendants, having rebuffed all recent efforts to settle this matter and\nhaving resisted offering any alternatives to the Special Masters’ proposed remedies unless the\nremedy promised the swift cessation of Court supervision, filed a proposed alternate remedy for\nending this litigation. (See Defs.’ Mot. for Consideration of Alternative to Appointment of\nIndependent Compliance Administrator and for Entry of Exit Plan, March 29, 2010 [“Defs.’\nMot. for Alternate Remedy”].) Obviously, there has been insufficient time for plaintiffs to\n\n                                                 2\n\fthe report and ask that the Court adopt the findings of the Special Masters and their\n\nrecommended remedy. Also before the Court is a motion the District filed, after the Special\n\nMasters concluded their proceedings in January 2009, to vacate all consent orders and to dismiss\n\nthe entire case. For the reasons stated herein, defendants’ motion to vacate and dismiss will be\n\ndenied. The Court will address, in a future memorandum opinion and order, defendants’\n\nobjections to the Special Masters’ Report and Recommendations.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n       The lengthy procedural history of this litigation prior to March 30, 2007, will not be\n\nrepeated here, as it was fully summarized in the Memorandum Opinion filed on that date. See\n\nEvans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 281. Certain events, however, are relevant to defendants’ pending\n\nmotions and will be briefly noted below, followed by a more detailed summary of the facts and\n\nprocedural history that post-date that decision.3\n\nI.     KEY EVENTS PRIOR TO THE MARCH 30, 2007 LIABILITY OPINION\n\n       A.      1978 Final Judgment and Order\n\n       On June 14, 1978, the Court4 entered a “Final Judgment and Order” providing for\n\npermanent injunctive relief. Evans v. Washington, 459 F. Supp. 483 (D.D.C. 1978) (“1978\n\n\nrespond to this proposal, which, if nothing else, as a matter of fairness, should have been\nsubmitted during the remedy phase of this litigation so that the parties, the Special Masters, and\nthe Court could have had some chance to address defendants’ new 17-page plan, which, on its\nface, appears to dramatically depart from the definition of outcomes and measurement of success\nthat were agreed to by the parties when they entered into the 2001 Plan.\n       3\n        Although the Court will address the Special Masters’ Report and Recommendation in a\nseparate memorandum opinion and order, many of the relevant facts will be included here as\nthey are also relevant to the pending motion.\n       4\n       The Honorable John H. Pratt presided over this case from its inception until his death in\nAugust 1995.\n\n                                                    3\n\fConsent Order”). The 1978 Consent Order was premised on the recognition, which was\n\nconsented to by the parties, that plaintiffs had federal constitutional rights under the due process\n\nclause of the Fifth Amendment “to be kept free from harm” and “to receive habilitative care and\n\ntreatment in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty” and that “violations of [those]\n\nfederal constitutional rights . . . have occurred.” Id. at 484. To remedy those violations, the\n\n1978 Consent Order required defendants and their successors to take a number of specific\n\nactions, see id. at 484-90, that, loosely classified, fell into three categories: health care, safety,\n\nand welfare/habilitation. Defendants “consented to the entry of [the 1978 Consent Order] so as\n\nto assure protection of the rights of plaintiffs.” Id. at 484.\n\n        B.      1981 Consent Order\n\n        In 1981, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor filed motions for contempt, based on\n\ndefendants’ noncompliance with the 1978 Consent Order. Those motions led to the entry of a\n\nsecond Consent Order, which supplemented defendants’ obligations under the 1978 Consent\n\nOrder with a list of agreed-upon “measures necessary to the implementation of this Court’s\n\nOrder of June 14, 1978.” (Consent Order at 1, June 25, 1981 [“1981 Consent Order”].) The\n\n1981 Consent Order did not revisit the legal conclusions of the 1978 Consent Order nor did it\n\n“release defendants from their obligations” thereunder. (Id. at 10.) Rather, the parties came to\n\nan agreement that defendants needed to take additional measures to assure protection of\n\nplaintiffs’ constitutional rights. The agreed-upon measures supplemented defendants’\n\nobligations in each area addressed by the 1978 Consent Order – health, safety and\n\nwelfare/habilitation. (Id. at 1-10.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                    4\n\f       C.      1982 Supreme Court Decision (Youngberg v. Romeo)\n\n       In 1982, the Supreme Court decided Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982),\n\naddressing for the first time the constitutional rights of an individual who had been involuntarily\n\ncommitted to a state institution for the mentally retarded. As discussed infra, defendants’ motion\n\nto vacate is based in part on the Youngberg decision and defendants’ contention, made for the\n\nfirst time in the 28 years since Youngberg was decided, that Youngberg changed the law and\n\nestablished that the 1978 Consent Order rested on “extraconstitutional” rights.\n\n       D.      1983 Consent Order\n\n       In 1982, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor again filed motions for contempt, which led to\n\nthe entry of a third Consent Order. (Consent Order, Feb. 8, 1983 [“1983 Consent Order”]). The\n\n1983 Consent Order similarly did not revisit the legal conclusions of the 1978 Consent Order nor\n\ndid it release defendants from their obligations under prior orders; it merely added to those\n\nobligations “to assist in the implementation of those orders.” (Id. at 14-15.) Again, the agreed-\n\nupon measures supplemented defendants’ obligations in each area addressed by the 1978\n\nConsent Order – health, safety and welfare/habilitation. (Id. at 2-14.)\n\n       E.      1990 Contempt Order\n\n       In 1989, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor again filed motions for contempt. In 1990, the\n\nCourt issued an Order holding the District in civil contempt based on its “consistent and\n\ncontinuing violation of the three Consent Orders [of 1978, 1981 and 1983].” Evans, 480 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 284 (quoting Order, Jan. 30, 1990 [“Jan. 1990 Contempt Order”].) After a sanctions\n\nhearing, the Court issued an Order that, inter alia, required defendants to complete the\n\noutplacement of the 233 plaintiffs remaining at Forest Haven by September 30, 1991. Id. (citing\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fOrder, Apr. 9, 1990 [“Apr. 1990 Contempt Order”]). By October 1991, all plaintiffs had been\n\nmoved from Forest Haven and the institution was closed.\n\n        F.     1995 Contempt Order, Appointment of Special Master, 1996 Remedial Plan\n\n        In 1995, four years after the closure of Forest Haven, plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor\n\nfiled motions for contempt, for remedial sanctions and for appointment of a Special Master.\n\nAfter two hearings, the Court again found the District to be in contempt based on “clear and\n\nconvincing evidence, including defendants’ conceded violations, that the District is not in\n\ncompliance with the consent orders in this case . . . .” (Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law\n\nat 7, Oct. 11, 1995 [“1995 Contempt Order”].) In its decision, the Court5 observed that as of\n\n1995, it had “entered numerous orders, including consent orders between the parties, to\n\nsafeguard the rights of class members and ensure their adequate and appropriate habilitation.”\n\n(Id. at 1.) The Court further noted that “[d]efendants admit that the District has a continuing\n\nresponsibility to provide the class members with habilitation in accordance with their needs” and\n\n“admit that they also are required to provide adequate medical care, psychological care, day\n\nprogramming, community residential placements and other support systems as set forth in the\n\nclass members’ [individual habilitation plans].” (Id. at 5-6 (emphasis added).) The Court\n\nproceeded to find the District in contempt because it (1) was delinquent in ensuring timely\n\npayment of providers, in violation of the 1983 Consent Order; (2) permitted inadequate case\n\nmanager ratios, in violation of the 1983 Consent Order; and (3) offered inadequate “community\n\nliving arrangements” and “community-based day programs and services as are necessary to\n\n\n\n        5\n         The case was reassigned to the Honorable Stanley S. Harris upon Judge Pratt’s death in\n1995.\n\n                                                  6\n\fprovide them with minimally adequate habilitation,” in violation of the 1978 Consent Order. (Id.\n\nat 7-8.)\n\n           The Court further found that defendants’ “history of noncompliance, compounded by the\n\ncomplicated and factually elusive nature of the matters under consideration,” required the\n\nappointment of a “Special Master” pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53 to “evaluate\n\nand ensure defendants’ compliance with the Court’s Orders and Consent Decrees . . . and to\n\nrecommend remedies for any deficiencies in defendants’ compliance with the Orders.” (Order of\n\nReference at 2, Oct. 11, 1995 [“1995 Reference Order”].)6\n\n           In August 1996, the Court, based on a Report and Recommendation from the Special\n\nMaster, adopted a “Remedial Plan,” designed “to enable defendants to come into compliance\n\nwith the terms of this Court’s multiple Consent Orders” and to establish the conditions by which\n\ndefendants could purge their civil contempt. Evans v. Barry, No. 76-CV-293, 1996 WL 451054,\n\nat *1-*2 (D.D.C. Aug. 2, 1996) (“1996 Order & Remedial Plan”). In adopting the Remedial\n\nPlan, the Court observed that\n\n           [d]efendants have, for over two years, chronically and unapologetically violated\n           the terms of nearly every aspect of this Court’s multiple Consent Orders.\n           Defendants’ unrelenting contempt of this Court’s orders, and their seeming\n           inability to bring themselves in compliance therewith, have created chaos for the\n           care providers vested with day-to-day responsibility for the members of this\n           plaintiff class. The plaintiffs comprising this class, as defendants well know, are\n           ill-equipped to adjust to or defend against the city’s failure to assist their care\n           providers in giving them the care and treatment they desperately need.\n\nId. at *2. The Court also warned defendants that:\n\n           the point has been reached beyond which this Court will not tolerate further and\n           continuing incidences of contempt by defendants. Any further noncompliance\n\n\n           6\n            The Court appointed Margaret G. Farrell to serve as Special Master.\n\n                                                    7\n\f       with this Court’s longstanding Consent Orders, and noncompliance with the\n       Remedial Plan issued this date, must be expected by defendants to result in\n       serious consequences.\n\nId. The remedial plan concerned defendants’ obligations in each area addressed by the 1978\n\nConsent Order – health, safety and welfare/habilitation. Id. at *3-*8\n\n       G.      1999 Sanctions Order\n\n       In April 1997, less than a year after the Court adopted the 1996 Remedial Plan, plaintiffs\n\nmoved for sanctions based on the District’s admitted failure to pay providers within 30 days, as\n\nrequired under that Plan. In February 1999, the Court granted the motion and imposed a $5\n\nmillion fine on defendants.7 Evans v. Williams, 35 F. Supp. 2d 88 (D.D.C. 1999). As part of that\n\ndecision, the Court modified the 1996 Remedial Plan to order the Special Master to work with\n\nthe parties to “develop and recommend to the Court a plan for the conclusion of the [litigation]”\n\nand the termination of the Court’s jurisdiction in a manner that would ensure that plaintiffs’\n\ninterests would continue to be protected. Id. at 97. As envisioned by the Court, the plan would\n\ninclude “recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the following topics”:\n\n       a. Goals. A summary and articulation of the goals of this lawsuit as reflected in\n       the 1978 and 1983 Consent Orders, the 1996 Remedial Plan, and all other\n       Court-ordered obligations (hereafter collectively “Court-ordered requirements”).\n\n       b. Current compliance. An evaluation of existing programs to determine the\n       extent of defendants’ compliance with requirements for the protection of the\n       health and safety of the plaintiff class and their effectiveness in meeting the goals\n       described in subparagraph a, including but not limited to the provision of\n       necessary medical and other health services and the compliance of private\n       vendors with District of Columbia licensing and payment requirements governing\n       community residence facilities, intermediate care facilities, foster care, day\n\n\n       7\n        The imposition of $5 million in contempt fines was reversed by the D.C. Circuit on the\nground that the fines amounted to a criminal sanction that could not be imposed without a\ncriminal trial. Evans v. Williams, 206 F.3d 1292 (D.C. Cir. 2000).\n\n                                                 8\n\f       treatment programs, day programs, employment programs, representative\n       payment and guardianship.\n\n       c. Adequate habilitation. The extent of defendants’ compliance with\n       Court-ordered requirements for the provision of adequate habilitation in the least\n       restrictive setting and their effectiveness (strengths and weaknesses) in meeting\n       the goals described in subparagraph a, including individual habilitation planning,\n       individual financial planning, case management, appropriate residential services,\n       adequate habilitation services, and the safeguarding of client funds.\n\n       d. Payment of providers. The extent of defendants’ compliance with\n       Court-ordered requirements for the timely payment of private providers who\n       provide the plaintiff class with appropriate residential services, day treatment\n       programs, vocational and supported employment services, day programs, medical,\n       mental health, dental, and other services required by the Court.\n\n       e. Quality assurance. The quality assurance methods to be developed and\n       implemented by defendants to monitor continually the performance of public and\n       private providers of service in meeting the goals of the suit.\n\n       f. Standards and compliance measurement. The standards, including outcome\n       standards to be developed and implemented by defendants, that should be used to\n       determine defendants’ continued compliance with Court-ordered requirements,\n       and the way in which compliance with such standards should be measured.\n\n       g. Substantial compliance standards. The degree of compliance that should be\n       required with each of the standards recommended.\n\n       h. Permanent monitoring. The steps necessary to establish permanent, objective,\n       efficient, and effective post-termination monitoring of the programs serving class\n       members by independent entities (for example, private accreditation services and\n       independent monitoring bodies).\n\n       I. Individual and community advocacy. The steps necessary to coordinate\n       existing mechanisms and to develop needed mechanisms for the advocacy of the\n       interests of class members, on a[n] individual and community-wide basis, in\n       compliance with Court-ordered requirements, including but not limited to the use\n       of court-appointed attorneys, guardianships, and medical decision-making\n       procedures for class members.\n\nId. at 97-98.\n\n       H.       Appointment of Independent Court Monitor\n\n\n                                                9\n\f       In November 2000, the Court entered an Order granting the parties’ joint motion for the\n\nappointment of an independent Court Monitor. (Order Regarding the Appointment of an\n\nIndependent Court Monitor, Nov. 21, 2000.) The Order specified that the duties of the Court\n\nMonitor were to include observing, monitoring, reporting findings, and making\n\nrecommendations to the parties, the Special Master, and the Court regarding implementation of\n\nthe Court’s Orders, and to submit quarterly reports on defendants’ “compliance” with the Court’s\n\nOrders. (Id. at 2-5.) The Order also provided that the “findings, recommendations and reports of\n\nthe Court Monitor . . . may be introduced as evidence when relevant and admissible in\n\naccordance with the Federal Rules of Evidence.” (Id. at 5.) In order to perform these duties, the\n\nMonitor was granted broad access “to the persons, residences, facilities, buildings, programs,\n\nservices, documents, records, personnel and materials the Monitor deems necessary or\n\nappropriate in performing [her duties].” (Id. at 4.)8\n\n       I.      2001 Opinion and Order: Joint Stipulated Findings of Fact; Plan for\n               Compliance; Consent Order and Settlement Agreement\n\n       In 2001, after “lengthy negotiations” – almost two years of work by the Special Master,\n\nthe parties, and an expert to the Special Master – the parties came to a series of agreements that\n\n“set forth a careful and detailed blueprint for achieving compliance with the Court’s Orders, for\n\nthe development of permanent and independent mechanisms to safeguard the rights of class\n\nmembers, and for the phased withdrawal of judicial oversight of the District of Columbia’s\n\nmental retardation system as compliance with the Court Orders [wa]s achieved.” Evans v.\n\n\n       8\n        On January 19, 2001, Dr. Jane Haddad was appointed as the first Independent Court\nMonitor. After her resignation, effective February 10, 2004, the Court appointed, with the\nconcurrence of the parties, Elizabeth Jones as the Court Monitor. Ms. Jones has continued to\nserve admirably in that capacity and has been of great assistance to the Court and to the parties.\n\n                                                 10\n\fWilliams, 139 F. Supp. 2d 79, 81 (D.D.C. 2001) (“2001 Consent Order”). Upon consideration of\n\nthese agreements, the Court, on March 30, 2001, (1) adopted the Parties’ Joint Stipulated\n\nFindings of Fact, id. at 96-107;9 (2) approved the 2001 Plan for Compliance and Conclusion of\n\nEvans v. Williams, id. at 85 (“2001 Plan”);10 and (3) entered a Consent Order, with a Settlement\n\nAgreement attached thereto. Id. at 85-96. Two aspects of these agreements remain critically\n\nimportant today: the 2001 Plan to achieve compliance and the creation of the Quality Trust in\n\nexchange for plaintiffs’ waiver of claims on noncompliance.\n\n               1.     2001 Compliance Plan\n\n       The 2001 Plan started from the premise “that there is already in place a declaratory\n\njudgment and permanent injunction recognizing a federal constitutional right to receive\n\n\n       9\n        As previously described by the Court, the joint stipulated findings of fact:\n\n       painted a bleak picture as to defendants’ record of noncompliance. The findings\n       acknowledged that there had been a “serious breakdown” in the District’s system\n       of support for individuals with developmental disabilities and that the system,\n       which had suffered from years of neglect and mismanagement, “urgently need[ed]\n       to be fixed.” Evans, 139 F. Supp. 2d at 96-97; see also, e.g., id. at 98 (noting that\n       District’s mental retardation and developmental delivery system was “broken”\n       and needed to be “redefined and rebuilt”). The findings noted that defendants’\n       compliance with the prior Court Orders had deteriorated following the closure of\n       Forest Haven in 1991 and that defendants were not complying with many of the\n       requirements of those Orders. Id. at 98. The findings also identified numerous\n       “fundamental problems,” including problems with respect to staffing, staff\n       training, and monitoring; management; reporting of and response to unusual\n       incidents; safeguarding of class members’ funds; the budgeting process; and the\n       District’s Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services waiver. See id. at\n       98-107.\n\nEvans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 286-87.\n       10\n         Clarence Sundram was the expert to the Special Master who “conceived, shaped, and\ndrafted significantly” the 2001 Plan. (2001 Plan at 5 n.1). He was appointed as a co-Special\nMaster on January 30, 2001. (Order, Jan. 30, 2001.)\n\n                                                11\n\findividualized habilitative care and treatment in the least separate, most integrated, and least\n\nrestrictive settings, and to be kept free from harm.” (2001 Plan at 6.) The Plan then identified\n\n(as the Court’s 1999 Order had requested) the agreed-upon “goals” of the existing Court orders.\n\nAccording to the Plan, the parties agreed that existing Court Orders embodied eight goals:\n\n       (1) Appropriate individual habilitation in the community in the least separate,\n       most integrated, and least restrictive environment;\n\n       (2) Protection from harm;\n\n       (3) Safeguarding consumers’ personal possessions;\n\n       (4) Monitoring the service system;\n\n       (5) Advocacy for consumers;\n\n       (6) Adequate budget;\n\n       (7) Timely payment of vendors; and\n\n       (8) Essential systemic conditions.\n\nEvans, 139 F. Supp. 2d at 81.11 For each goal (or subgoal), the Plan identified the “relevant\n\nCourt Orders,” the “specific tasks that must be performed to implement those Orders,” the “time\n\nframes within which the tasks must be performed,” the “specific outcome criteria for measuring\n\ncompliance,” the “standard of compliance,” and the “methods by which evidence will be\n\ncollected and evaluated to assess compliance.” Id. at 81-82.\n\n       The Court approved the 2001 Plan “as, in effect, a statement of the conditions for the\n\nexpected vacating of the Court’s relevant prior Orders.” Id. at 85. It was anticipated that\n\n       [w]hile the Plan is not intended to be an independently enforceable document, the\n\n\n       11\n          The Court’s order and opinion included extensive factual findings documenting the\nDistrict’s failure to meet each of the goals. Id. at 97-107.\n\n                                                 12\n\f        parties do intend that there will be accountability for its implementation. The\n        Plan requires periodic progress reports to the Special Master on its\n        implementation and calls for status conferences with the Court to be scheduled at\n        least bimonthly. The parties agree that if the Court finds that defendants have\n        satisfied the outcome criteria set forth in the Plan, they also will be in compliance\n        with the related Court Orders. Any failure of defendants to implement the tasks\n        identified in the Plan so as to meet the requirements of the related Court Orders\n        would be evidence of noncompliance with those Orders. The Plan provides that\n        until the existing Court Orders are vacated, plaintiffs may seek appropriate\n        judicial relief, including requesting orders requiring compliance with the Order(s)\n        underlying the objectives of the Plan.\n\nId. at 83.\n\n               2.      Creation of the Quality Trust\n\n        The Consent Order and attached Settlement Agreement provided that, in exchange for the\n\nplaintiffs waiving “any and all claims for past violations of the Court’s Orders,” the District\n\nwould “endow and annually fund . . . a durable, independent, nonprofit organization that will\n\nmonitor and advance the individual and collective interests of people with developmental\n\ndisabilities in the District of Columbia’s service delivery system.” Id. at 86. Defendants agreed\n\nto fund the organization, denominated the Quality Trust, with a total of $31.5 million over eleven\n\nyears.12 Ultimately, the goal was for the Quality Trust to be “an external monitoring body to\n\npermanently protect the interests of the class members once this case ends.” Id. at 83.\n\n                                                ***\n\n        The 2001 agreements, which the Court accepted and adopted, contemplated that as\n\ndefendants satisfied the outcome criteria in the 2001 Plan for particular groups of Court Orders,\n\nthey would move the Court to have those Orders vacated and dismissed with the ultimate goal\n\n\n\n        12\n         Of that amount, Quality Trust estimates that the District still has $5 million left to\ncontribute. (Hr’g Tr. at 138, Dec. 17, 2009 [“12/17/09 Tr.”].)\n\n                                                 13\n\fthat, over time, defendants would\n\n        implement all of the required actions and meet the specified outcome criteria in\n        order to successfully move the Court to vacate and dismiss the related Court\n        Orders, except the declaratory judgment on the constitutional rights of the\n        consumers to receive individualized habilitation in the least separate, most\n        integrated and least restrictive environment and to be protected from harm.\n\n(2001 Plan at 9-10 (emphasis added).) Once the Court orders were vacated and dismissed, the\n\nplaintiffs agreed that they would not “seek recourse to the federal court to litigate individual\n\nviolations of rights in this case pursuant to the declaratory judgment which will remain unless:\n\n(1) there are systemic violations of the declaratory judgment; or (2) legal remedies are\n\nunavailable in Superior Court (e.g., due to repeal of the statutes); or (3) there is a failure to\n\nadequately fund the Quality Trust pursuant to the Consent Order dated January 19, 2001.” (Id.)\n\n        Since 2001, however, defendants have not invoked the procedures set forth in the 2001\n\nPlan, to which they agreed, to vacate any Court Orders based on their implementation of the\n\nnecessary tasks and satisfaction of the specified outcome criteria.13 Accordingly, the Court\n\nOrders “continue to remain enforceable in federal court.” (Id.) Moreover, even though the 2001\n\nPlan itself was “not intended to be an enforceable document,” the parties agreed that plaintiffs\n\n“have a great interest in ensuring that the agreed upon actions identified in this Plan are in fact\n\nimplemented effectively and in a timely manner by defendants to secure the benefits and\n\nprotections provided for by the Court Orders,” and provided, therefore, that “in the event that\n\ndefendants do not implement the provisions of this Plan effectively and on a timely basis,\n\n\n        13\n         As noted above (see supra note 2), defendants have now made half-hearted reference to\na limited number of orders that they believe should be vacated (Mem. in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. for\nAlternate Remedy at 3 [“Defs.’ Mem. re Alternate Remedy”]), but prior to this, defendants\nsteadfastly maintained that modification was not realistic; instead, all orders must be vacated and\nthe case dismissed. (See infra note 34.)\n\n                                                  14\n\fplaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor retain the right to seek appropriate judicial relief, based on this\n\nevidence of noncompliance with the Court Orders, including Orders requiring specific\n\nperformance of the Plan.” (Id.)\n\n        J.      2004 Order\n\n        In 2004, after several years of receiving discouraging monitor reports on the\n\nimplementation of the 2001 Plan, this Court14 issued an order to address the “need for greater\n\ncoordination among District of Columbia agencies which have responsibilities for actions that\n\nare necessary to achieve compliance with the 2001 Plan.” (Order at 1, Jan. 21, 2004 [“2004\n\nCoordination Order”].) As described therein, the parties had met with the Court on December\n\n12, 2003, and agreed that “the current lack of such coordination has impeded the timely\n\ncompletion of necessary tasks identified in the 2001 Plan.” (Id. at 1-2.) The 2004 Order\n\nreiterated that the District remained subject to the Court’s previous orders, which were issued “to\n\neffectuate the rights of class members to adequate habilitation in a manner least restrictive of\n\ntheir liberty” and that the purpose of the 2001 Plan was to require defendants to take certain\n\nactions to achieve compliance with those orders. (Id. at 1.) The Order required, inter alia, that\n\nthe Mayor appoint a Deputy Mayor or other senior official “to be responsible for the day-to-day\n\nefforts of District of Columbia agencies to achieve compliance with this Court’s orders and the\n\n2001 Plan.” (Id. at 2.) That individual was to “have the necessary authority to supervise and\n\ndirect the activities of” and “coordinate the efforts of all District of Columbia agencies” as\n\nnecessary to “carry out their obligations under the 2001 Plan and previous orders of this Court,”\n\n\n\n        14\n         Shortly after the 2001 Plan was approved, Judge Harris retired and this case was\nreassigned to the undersigned.\n\n                                                  15\n\fand was to “cooperate with and report periodically to the Special Masters and Court Monitor on\n\ndefendants’ progress,” and “appear before this Court at each status conference and report to the\n\nCourt on behalf of defendants regarding the status of defendants’ compliance with the 2001 Plan\n\nand orders of this Court.” (Id. at 3.)15\n\nII.    MOTION FOR RECEIVERSHIP: LIABILITY PHASE\n\n       In May 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Court to find defendants in\n\nnoncompliance with the outstanding Court Orders and to place the District’s Mental Retardation\n\nand Developmental Disabilities Administration (“MRDDA”) into receivership.16 The Court\n\nbifurcated proceedings into a “liability” and a “remedy” phase. Evans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 291\n\n(“March 2007 Liability Opinion”).\n\n       While the liability phase was ongoing, several notable events occurred. On December\n\n20, 2006, the “Developmental Disabilities Services Agency,” later renamed the “Department on\n\nDisability Services,” was established by emergency legislation as a separate Cabinet-level\n\nagency to serve consumers formerly served by the MRDDA, including the Evans class members.\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities Services Management Reform Emergency Amendment Act of 2006,\n\n§§ 103, 105(1), (2). In January 2007, Adrian Fenty took office as Mayor for the District of\n\nColumbia. On February 5, 2007, defendants asked the Court to delay its liability ruling in light\n\nof the new administration’s “commitment to DDS and its consumers” and its newly adopted\n\n\n       15\n         Since January 2004, several different individuals have served in this capacity.\nPresently, the Mayor’s appointee is Peter Nickles, the Attorney General for the District of\nColumbia. But see infra pp. 30-31.\n       16\n        The United States, as plaintiff-intervenor, also filed a motion for an order to show cause\nwhy defendants should not be held in contempt. The Court denied that motion on March 30,\n2007. (Order, Mar. 30, 2007.)\n\n                                                16\n\f“Systems Improvement Plan” in order “to allow sufficient time for the DDS to appropriately\n\naddress the continuing concerns of the Court, the Monitor, the Department of Justice, and\n\nplaintiffs.” (Defs.’ Notice of Filing of Supplemental Information in Resp. to the Ct. Monitor’s\n\nQuarterly Report at 10, Feb. 5, 2007.) In making its request, the District indicated that it was\n\n“cognizant that much remains to be done to bring DDS into compliance with outstanding court\n\norders and the 2001 Plan,” but promised the Court that the “Fenty Administration is fully\n\ncommitted to the success of the new agency, the delivery of improved services and care to the\n\nconsumers served by the agency, and compliance with the 2001 Plan.” (Id. at 8.) At a status\n\nhearing the next day, the Court rejected this request and indicated that it intended to issue its\n\nliability ruling based on the record as of November 29, 2006, when the Court Monitor had filed\n\nher supplemental report as requested by the Court, but that information about improvements and\n\naccomplishments after that date would be considered in any remedy phase. (Hr’g Tr. at 23-24,\n\nFeb. 6, 2007.)\n\n       On March 30, 2007, the Court issued its liability ruling, concluding that plaintiffs had\n\nmet their burden to show that there had been “systemic, continuous, and serious noncompliance”\n\nwith the Court’s prior Orders. Evans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 325.\n\n       A.        Findings: Health, Safety and Welfare\n\n       The Court organized its findings in terms of these three broad subject areas: health, safety\n\nand welfare. Based on a record that closed in November 2006, the Court found that\n\n       plaintiffs have demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that defendants\n       have failed to comply with existing Court Orders in the core areas of health,\n       safety, and welfare. These failures are systemic in that they affect many class\n       members served by a cross-section of providers and occur throughout defendants’\n       service delivery system. They are serious in that they concern matters that are\n       integral to class members’ health, safety, and well-being. And, they are\n\n                                                 17\n\f       continuous in that the same issues of noncompliance have persisted year after\n       year.\n\nId. at 298. A brief summary of the Court’s findings follows.\n\n       In the category of “health,” the Court found that:\n\n       defendants have failed in many significant respects to accomplish the tasks and to\n       achieve the outcome criteria in the 2001 Plan that relate to the Court’s Orders\n       regarding the provision of health care and to comply with the terms of the Orders\n       themselves. Defendants’ deficient performance with respect to these measures\n       provides ample evidence that defendants have failed to comply with the Court’s\n       Order that “[a] program of medical, dental and health related services which\n       provides accessibility, quality and continuity of care is required,” as well as with\n       Court Orders requiring development of habilitation plans and programs that\n       incorporate all services needed by class members and implementation of\n       appropriate training programs for all staff.\n\nId. at 305 (citations omitted).\n\n       In the category of “safety,” the Court found that:\n\n       defendants have failed in many significant respects to accomplish the tasks and\n       outcome criteria associated with the Court’s Orders relating to class member\n       safety and to comply with the terms of the Orders themselves. Defendants’\n       performance in the areas discussed above provides ample evidence that\n       defendants have failed to comply with the Court’s Orders prohibiting all acts of\n       “physical or psychological abuse, neglect or mistreatment” of class members,\n       requiring the prompt reporting and investigation of all such incidents and the\n       prompt dissemination of the reports of such investigations to the Court Monitor\n       and other interested parties, requiring the development and implementation of\n       appropriate training programs for all staff, including staff assigned to residential\n       settings, and requiring defendants to provide necessary monitoring mechanisms.\n\nId. at 313-314 (citations omitted).\n\n       Finally, in the category of “welfare,” the Court found that defendants were not in\n\ncompliance in several respects. First, in terms of the “least restrictive, most integrated setting\n\nrequirement,” the Court found that:\n\n       defendants have not complied with the Court’s 1978 Order that all class members\n       be provided with “community living arrangements suitable to each, together with\n\n                                                 18\n\f        such community-based day programs and services as are necessary to provide\n        them within minimally adequate habilitation . . . in the least separate, most\n        integrated and least restrictive community settings.”\n\nId. at 319 (quoting Evans, 459 F. Supp. at 484). The Court also found serious problems in the\n\nareas of implementing “individual support plans” (“ISPs”) and thus in “ensuring that class\n\nmembers actually receive the services and supports they require,” id. at 320, and a failure to\n\ncomply with orders regarding “adaptive equipment.” Id. at 321. Finally, the Court found\n\nproblems in the area of case management, concluding that:\n\n        defendants “fail[ed] to ensure that case managers complete the required number\n        of visits and that they take appropriate action when a class member has been the\n        subject of a serious incident”; “[f]ail[ed] to ensure that case managers are\n        properly trained before receiving caseloads”; and that case managers “fail[ed] to\n        ensure that ISPs are fully implemented.”\n\nId. at 324.\n\n        The Court summarized its findings as follows:\n\n        As a result of these failings, class members continue to be placed in inappropriate\n        and overly restrictive residential and day programs, rather than in the least\n        restrictive, most integrated settings. Provider and MRDDA staff, including case\n        managers, are not adequately trained, and case managers do not visit class\n        members with the required frequency and do not adequately address deficiencies\n        in class members’ care. In many instances, class members do not receive the\n        needed services and supports that have been identified in their ISPs. Protocols\n        necessary to protect class members’ health and safety, such as feeding,\n        positioning, and behavioral plans, are routinely not followed. Health risks are not\n        adequately assessed and monitored for many class members, and\n        recommendations by health care providers are not implemented in a timely\n        manner. While incidents of abuse and neglect of class members persist,\n        defendants have failed to ensure that these and other serious incidents, including\n        class member deaths, are investigated in a timely manner, that the results of such\n        investigations are shared with providers, and that recommended corrective and\n        preventive actions are implemented. Defendants have also compromised the\n        monitoring process by altering death investigation reports.\n\nId. at 324-25. These findings were the basis for the Court’s ultimate conclusion that defendants’\n\n\n                                                19\n\fnoncompliance with Court orders had been “systemic, continuous and serious.” Id. at 325.\n\n       B.      Remedy\n\n       As for the remedy of receivership sought by the plaintiffs, the Court observed:\n\n       Although it is clear based on the tortured history of this case that there have been\n       repeated failures to comply with the Court’s Orders, this determination is in no\n       way determinative of the question whether plaintiffs are correct in their argument\n       that a receivership should be imposed.\n\nId. at 326. Rather, receivership is a “remedy of last resort,” that “should be undertaken only\n\nwhen absolutely necessary.” Id. (quoting District of Columbia v. Jerry M., 738 A.2d 1206,\n\n1213 (D.C. 1999)).\n\n       In light of the complexity of this inquiry, and the fact that “recent developments . . . are\n\nencouraging and will be highly relevant to the remedial phase of this action,” the Court\n\ndetermined that it would “enlist the assistance of the Special Masters, who have ably served in\n\nthis capacity for many years, to make findings and recommendations to the Court that address,\n\ninter alia, the current status of defendants’ compliance, what are the available options for curing\n\nthe identified deficiencies, and whether a receivership is the most effective and efficient remedy\n\navailable to the Court.” Id. at 326. The Court instructed that the “determination whether other\n\nremedies are inadequate and whether receivership remains the only viable option to effectuate\n\ncompliance with court orders is to be guided by a number of factors, including\n\n       (1) “whether there were repeated failures to comply with the Court’s orders”; (2)\n       whether further efforts to secure compliance would only lead to “confrontation\n       and delay”; (3) whether leadership is available which can “turn the tide within a\n       reasonable time period”; (4) “whether there was bad faith”; (5) “whether\n       resources are being wasted”; and, (6) “whether a receiver can provide a quick and\n       efficient remedy.”\n\nId. (quoting Jerry M., 738 A.2d at 1213 (quoting Dixon v. Barry, 967 F. Supp. 535, 550 (D.D.C.\n\n\n                                                 20\n\f1997))). The Court’s final observation was that “the daunting task of finding ways to remedy the\n\nproblems still remains. In this regard, the Court expects the parties to continue their prior efforts\n\nto resolve this matter so that the plight of the class members can be improved as expeditiously as\n\npossible, and they will not have to continue to await the outcome of this painfully lengthy and\n\ncumbersome litigation.” Id. at 327.\n\nIII.    MOTION FOR RECEIVERSHIP: REMEDY PHASE\n\n        A.      Supplemental Order of Reference to the Special Masters\n\n        Following the issuance of the March 30, 2007 decision, the parties conferred and jointly\n\nagreed on a supplemental order of reference to the Special Masters. (Supp. Order of Reference,\n\nMay 3, 2007 [“2007 Reference Order”].) The 2007 Reference Order provided, inter alia, as\n\nfollows:\n\n        Both Margaret G. Farrell and Clarence J. Sundram have served as Special Masters\n        in this case for many years under prior Orders of Reference. The Court finds that\n        it is justified and necessary to continue their appointment to assist the Court for as\n        long as the Court deems necessary in this matter.\n\n(Id. at 1.) It further provided that:\n\n        The Masters are authorized to conduct proceedings relating to the necessity for\n        remedial relief, including, as needed, discovery, hearings, mediation and\n        settlement negotiations. At the conclusion of such proceedings, the Masters will\n        issue a report to the Court making recommended findings of fact, conclusions of\n        law and recommendations regarding appropriate remedies.\n\n(Id. at 2.) Following the issuance of the Special Masters’ report and recommendations, the\n\nparties were to “file objections to (or file a motion to adopt or to modify) such order, report or\n\nrecommendations.” (Id. at 4.) The parties were directed that all objections should “specifically\n\nidentify the portions of the order, or report containing proposed findings of fact, conclusions of\n\nlaw and recommendations for remedial action, to which objection is made and the basis for the\n\n                                                 21\n\fobjection.” (Id.) Finally, the Order provided that this Court would review de novo “all\n\nobjections to the Masters’ proposed findings of fact and recommendations regarding remedial\n\nrelief” and “all objections to conclusions of law made or recommended by the Masters.” (Id.)\n\n       B.      September 12, 2007 Consent Order (“90-Day Order”)\n\n       After a quarterly status conference on August 9, 2007,17 the parties agreed to develop,\n\nand the Court ultimately entered, a consent order “setting forth a limited number of concrete,\n\nshort-term goals related to retaining and increasing the number of qualified providers and\n\nimproving the health and safety of class members” that the District agreed to achieve “during the\n\nthree-month period from October 1, 2007, to December 31, 2007.” (Order at 1, Sept. 12, 2007\n\n[“2007 90-Day Consent Order”]). Pursuant to that Order, defendants agreed to take a number of\n\nspecific actions that were focused on these two critical goals. (Id. at 2.) The Special Masters\n\nwere tasked with determining defendants’ compliance with the 2007 90-Day Consent Order,\n\nbeginning in January 2008. (Id. at 1.)\n\n       On August 18, 2008, the Special Masters filed their Report and Recommendation\n\nregarding defendants’ compliance with the 2007 90-Day Order. (Special Masters’ Report &\n\nRecommendation Regarding Defs.’ Compliance with the Consent Order of Sept. 12, 2007, Aug.\n\n18, 2008 [“2008 Special Masters’ Report”].) The 2008 Special Masters’ Report concluded that\n\noverall defendants “did not demonstrate substantial compliance with six out of the 13 provisions\n\nof the Consent Order that they recently agreed-upon, and whose obligations they concede they\n\n\n\n       17\n          At the August 9, 2007 status conference, the director of DDS, Judith Heumann,\ninformed the Court that (1) the name of the MRDDA was changing to the Developmental\nDisabilities Administration (“DDA”); and (2) that Laura Nuss would be the new deputy\noverseeing the DDA. (Hr’g. Tr. at 5, Aug. 9, 2007.)\n\n                                                22\n\fclearly understood.”18 Id. at 107.\n\n       C.      Monitoring Compliance\n\n       At the same time it issued the 2007 90-Day Consent Order, the Court ordered the parties\n\nto “file with the Court the agreed-upon methodology to be used by the Court Monitor to monitor\n\ndefendants’ compliance with the requirements of the 2001 Plan and the existing Court Orders by\n\nJanuary 10, 2008.” (Minute Order, Sept. 12, 2007). Following the issuance of this Order, the\n\nCourt Monitor circulated to the parties and the Special Masters a proposed monitoring protocol.\n\nOn November 21, 2007, defendants filed a notice stating:\n\n       By communication of November 16, 2007, faced with the expenditure of\n       substantial resources and time to develop the above-referenced methodology,\n       Defendants informed the Court Monitor that a meeting to develop a methodology\n       would not be needed since Defendants would not assert that conditions have so\n       fundamentally changed at this point that such comprehensive monitoring is\n       appropriate. Accordingly, Defendants expressed the view that there was no need\n       for the comprehensive monitoring proposed by the Court Monitor and the\n       significant expense attendant thereto that would be incurred.\n\n(Defs.’ Notice Concerning Proposed Comprehensive Monitoring at 2, Nov. 21, 2007 (emphasis\n\nadded).) By May 2008, a monitoring protocol had still not been agreed upon. Just prior to the\n\nstatus conference set for May 15, 2008, defendants filed a motion to stay discovery during the\n\nremedial phase of the case, which was denied by the Court. (Hr’g Tr. at 38, May 15, 2008.) On\n\nMay 19, 2008, the Court issued a scheduling order to govern the remedy phase.\n\n\n\n       18\n         On September 15, 2008, defendants filed a motion for an order modifying the 2008\nSpecial Masters’ Report to find defendants in compliance with the 2007 90-Day Consent Order.\n(Defs.’ Mot. to Modify the Special Masters’ Report & Recommendation, Consistent with Defs.’\nObjections, to Find Defs. in Compliance with the Consent Order of Sept. 12, 2007, at 1, Sept. 15,\n2008.) On October 6, 2008, the Court held this motion in abeyance and to the extent it is\nnecessary to address this motion, it will be done in the Court’s opinion regarding defendants’\nobjections to the 2008 Special Masters’ Report and Recommendation.\n\n                                               23\n\f       On June 13, 2008, plaintiffs, in response to the Court’s request, filed a summary of the\n\nremedies they were seeking. That filing set forth a range of possible remedies, “running from no\n\naction by the Court up to court-appointed receivership over the entire Department on Disability\n\nServices, with oversight of all District agency functions pertaining to Evans class members and\n\nother individuals with developmental disabilities served by the defendants.” (Pls.’ Filing on\n\nRemedies at 1, June 13, 2008.) Among these alternatives, plaintiffs endorsed the remedy of\n\nappointing a “Special Administrator,” who would “oversee[] government agencies and functions\n\npertaining to class members until the District achieves substantial compliance with the Court’s\n\nOrders,” but who would not have all the powers of a receiver. (Id. at 3.)\n\n       D.      Proceedings Before the Special Masters\n\n       Following additional discovery and pretrial proceedings, the Special Masters conducted a\n\nthree-day trial on December 10-12, 2008. Direct testimony from both fact and expert witnesses\n\nwas presented by declaration or excerpts from depositions. (Special Masters’ Final Pretrial\n\nOrder at 6, Nov. 28, 2008.) All witnesses were subject to live cross-examination. (Trial Tr.,\n\nDec. 10, 2008; Trial Tr., Dec. 11, 2008.) Plaintiffs presented the testimony of two fact\n\nwitnesses19 and two expert witnesses.20 Defendants presented the testimony of six fact\n\nwitnesses21 and three expert witnesses.22 In addition, more than 200 exhibits were introduced\n\n       19\n         John M. Cook, Executive Director, L’Arche, Inc.; Thomas F. Wilds, member of\ninteragency rate-setting task force.\n       20\n       Martha B. Knisley; Lewis H. Spence, lecturer, Harvard School of Education and\nKennedy School of Government (remedy).\n       21\n         Laura L. Nuss, Deputy Director of the Department on Disability Services, responsible\nfor the Developmental Disabilities Administration; John McCarthy, Deputy Director of the\nDepartment of Health Care Finance and District of Columbia State Medicaid Director; Kathy\nSawyer, former consultant and Interim Director, DDS, former Evans Compliance Officer\n\n                                               24\n\finto evidence. Subsequently, both parties submitted Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions\n\nof Law, as well as post-trial briefs. The Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities filed an\n\namicus brief in support of plaintiffs’ motion and for the appointment of a Special Administrator.\n\nOn February 9, 2009, closing arguments were heard by the Special Masters.\n\n       E.      Districts’ Motions to Vacate: April 20, 2009\n\n       On April 20, 2009, shortly before the Special Masters issued a draft of their Report and\n\nRecommendation, defendants filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n60(b)(5) to vacate all consent orders and dismiss the case. Defendants asserted that “[c]ontinued\n\nfederal-court oversight is no longer equitable, as there is no question that the District has\n\nremedied the alleged constitutional and statutory violations that gave rise to the 1978 Consent\n\nOrder and its progeny” and “there is no reasonable basis for asserting that the District will revert\n\nto violating the law if the Court’s orders are lifted.” (Defs.’ Mot. to Vacate Consent Orders and\n\nDismiss Action at 1, Apr. 20, 2009.) For the first time, in a litigation that has been ongoing for\n\nmore than 30 years and despite repeated promises to comply with the existing Court orders,\n\ndefendants took the position that their noncompliance was irrelevant to the question of whether\n\nthe Court should continue enforcing its orders because those orders went “beyond minimum\n\nstandards necessary to satisfy constitutional requirements.” (Id. at 3.) In a minute order filed on\n\nMay 1, 2009, the Court advised the parties that no opposition to defendants’ motion should be\n\n\n\n(through Jan. 31, 2008) and former Interim Administrator, MRDDA; Judith Heumann, Director,\nDDS; Amy Brooks, President of RCM, a provider agency; Lisa Alexander, M.D., DC HRP.\n       22\n          David L. Jackson, M.D., PhD, President, Jackson & Assocs. (2007 mortality review and\nfollow-up on recommendations for improvement); Nancy Thaler, Executive Director, National\nAssociation of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services; and John Sumner, Ph.D\n(statistical analysis).\n\n                                                 25\n\ffiled because it intended to hold it in abeyance until it received the Special Masters’ final Report\n\nand Recommendation.\n\n       F.      Special Masters’ Report and Recommendations\n\n       On May 22, 2009, the Special Masters circulated, as required by the 2007 Supplemental\n\nOrder of Reference, a draft of their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for\n\ncomment. In that draft, the Special Masters “recommended that the Court’s 2004 Order be\n\namended to provide for a Special Compliance Officer to be jointly appointed by the Court and\n\nthe Mayor with enhanced authority to coordinate and direct the activities of the various District\n\nagencies urgently needed to deliver constitutionally acceptable services to the plaintiff class.”\n\n(2009 Special Masters’ Report at 4.) The draft recommended “that the Court appoint the Deputy\n\nDirector of DDS/DDA, Laura Nuss, as the Special Compliance Officer merging in one person\n\nthe legal responsibility under local law with the responsibilities and authority to be conferred by\n\nthe Court, to lead defendants’ efforts to achieve compliance with the court orders.” (Id. at 135.)\n\nThe Special Masters believed that “this least intrusive, and least expensive, remedy was most\n\nlikely . . . to achieve compliance with Court Orders.” (Id. at 4.) However, this remedy “required\n\nthe Mayor’s agreement.” (Id.) On July 6, 2009, the parties filed their comments on and\n\nobjections to the draft report. Defendants’ comments indicated that the Mayor would not agree\n\nto the proposal to appoint a Special Compliance Officer, making that remedy “no longer a viable\n\none.” (Id. at 135.)\n\n       On August 14, 2009, the Special Masters filed their final Report and Recommendations,\n\nbased on the record from November 29, 2006, the close of the record for the liability phase,\n\nthrough December 2008, when they closed the record before them. (Id. at 3.) As described\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fherein, the Special Masters found that “plaintiffs had proved by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat defendants continue to be in serious noncompliance with critical provisions of outstanding\n\ncourt orders” in the areas of health, safety, and welfare. (Id.) They recommended as a remedy\n\nthe appointment of an “Independent Compliance Administrator accountable only to the Court to\n\nsupervise and coordinate defendants’ serial compliance with individual court ordered obligations\n\nso that the suit may be dismissed in three years time or less.” (Id. at 4-5).\n\n               1.       Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n                        a.     Health\n\n       In the area of health, the Special Masters found that defendants were noncompliant in\n\nseveral significant respects. First, regarding medical care, they found that defendants had “failed\n\nto completely perform some or all of the following duties”: “documenting significant health\n\nproblems in class members’ health management plans; monitoring implementation of health\n\nplans; implementing recommendations put forward by class members’ physicians and medical\n\nspecialists and completing lab work and physician-ordered diagnostic tests.” (Id. at 26-27.)\n\nThus, they concluded:\n\n       The evidence in the record indicates that a significant portion of the plaintiff class\n       have health care needs that are not identified in their health plans. Furthermore,\n       too often needs identified in health plans are not met because health plans are not\n       implemented – i.e. diagnostic tests, consultations and treatments and follow up\n       appointments are not provided or documented in their health records.\n\n(Id. at 31.) The Special Masters also found “ongoing and significant problems with the delivery\n\nof timely and appropriate mental health and behavioral healthcare.” (Id. at 35.) These problems\n\nincluded:\n\n       a) lack of access to sufficient psychiatric and psychological services; b) improper\n       professional practices that are inconsistent with professional standards; c)\n\n                                                 27\n\f       recommended clinical therapies not being implemented; d) the failure to integrate\n       the use of psychotropic medications into an overall treatment plan; e) the failure\n       to obtain informed consent and approval from Human Rights Committees for use\n       of these restrictive measures; and f) the lack of monitoring of the usage and side\n       effects of psychotropic medications.\n\n(Id.)23 Finally, the Special Masters found that “delays in obtaining guardianship for the\n\nprovision of informed consent for medical and dental treatment of class members . . . have\n\ncontinued” (id. at 45), sometimes “for months, sometimes more than a year, after the need for a\n\nguardian is first identified.” (Id. at 50.) As a result, treatment is delayed and class members\n\nsuffer harmful consequences. (Id. at 49-50.)\n\n       Based on these findings, the Special Masters concluded that “plaintiffs have established\n\nby clear and convincing evidence” that defendants continue “to be in non-compliance with . . .\n\noutstanding consent orders” with regard to (1) “class members’ health” (id. at 31); (2) “mental\n\nand behavioral health care” (id. at 41-42); and (3) timely appointment of guardians. (Id. at 49-\n\n50.)\n\n                       b.      Safety and Protection from Harm\n\n       The Special Masters found the following problems with respect to defendants’\n\nobligations to ensure plaintiffs’ safety and protection from harm: (1) “a significant number of\n\nuntimely investigations” into “serious reportable incidents” and deaths (id. at 52-53); (2) “some\n\nIMEU reports continue to fail to thoroughly investigate serious reportable incidents” (id. at 54);\n\n(3) except for Level I incidents, “the investigation report format does not inquire about potential\n\ncauses and contributory factors leading to the incident under investigation” (id. at 56); (4) an\n\n\n\n       23\n         “About one third of the class members (228) receive psychotropic medications,” and\n“305 class members have behavior support plans.” (Id. at 35.)\n\n                                                 28\n\finability to “identif[y] and address[] systemic issues arising in investigations (id. at 57); (5)\n\n“numerous instances of providers filing late incident reports or no reports at all, conducting\n\ninadequate investigations, or failing to conduct required investigations with no recommendations\n\nfor or evidence of enforcement actions being taken in response to these deficiencies” (id. at 60);\n\n(6) “[i]ncidents of harm . . . , including serious physical injury, physical abuse and neglect” (id.\n\nat 60); (7) harm resulting from “delays in treatment due to problems with getting informed\n\nconsent (id. at 61); (8) “harm due to inadequate health care management” (id.); and (9) harm\n\nresulting from problems with the District’s “transportation broker contract.” (Id. at 64).\n\n       Based on these findings, the Special Masters concluded that “while there are some\n\nnascent signs of progress in a few areas,” there was “clear and convincing evidence that the\n\nproblems being experienced by class members in the area of safety and protection from harm are\n\ncontinuing, serious and systemic.” (Id. at 67.)\n\n                       c.      Welfare\n\n       In terms of court orders concerning plaintiff’s “welfare,” the Special Masters found the\n\nplaintiffs had “not sustained their burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence\n\nnon-compliance with court orders requiring residential placements in less restrictive settings”\n\n(id. at 72); with court orders requiring that “all class members have written ISPs containing\n\ncurrent habilitation plans, behavioral support plans and health plans” (id. at 78); or with court\n\norders requiring a minimum of eight visits per year by a service coordinator/case manager. (Id.\n\nat 82). However, they did find continuing problems in the following areas: (1) segregated day\n\nprograms with arts and crafts as the primary activity and a lack of opportunity for community\n\nexperiences (id. at 73-74); (2) supported employment (id. at 74); (3) implementation of ISPs (id.\n\n\n                                                  29\n\fat 77-79); and (4) service coordinators not ensuring that ISPs are fully implemented or following\n\nup when they are not. (Id. at 81-84.)\n\n       Based on these findings, the Special Masters concluded that there is “clear and\n\nconvincing evidence” that defendants have “not met their obligation . . . to provide adequate\n\nhabilitation in non-residential, least restrictive, community-integrated settings” (id. at 74), or to\n\n“[p]rovide all necessary and proper monitoring mechanisms to assure that community living\n\narrangements, programs and supportive community services of the necessary quantity and\n\nquality are provided and maintained.” (Id. at 83-84).\n\n                       d.      Interagency Coordination\n\n       As the Special Masters noted,\n\n       [a]lthough the primary responsibility for providing timely and effective services\n       and supports to class members rests with DDS/DDA, the success of this enterprise\n       depends upon the coordinated efforts of several District agencies, including\n       MAA/DHCF (formerly the Medical Assistance Administration (MAA) in the\n       Department of Health (DOH) and now the Department of Health Care Finance\n       (DHCF)), through which most of the funding is provided, the Health Regulation\n       and Licensing Agency (HRLA) in the DOH, which is responsible for licensing\n       and enforcement with respect to ICFs/MR, the Office of the Inspector General,\n       which has investigative responsibilities for Medicaid fraud and abuse, the Office\n       of Attorney General which files petitions for guardianships in court, and other\n       agencies involved in the personnel, procurement, and budget process . . .\n       includ[ing] the Office of Contracts and Procurement, which has a significant role\n       in the contracting process.\n\n(Id. at 84.) As described supra, the 2004 Coordination Order was aimed at improving\n\ninteragency communication coordination. The Special Masters found that despite evidence of\n\nimprovement, “[t]here has been little evidence submitted regarding specific compliance with [the\n\n2004 Order].” (Id. at 90.) According to the Special Masters\n\n       [w]hat is missing is evidence of leadership or coordination by the Mayor’s\n       designee—the central point of the order—to give focus, direction and priority to\n\n                                                  30\n\f        interagency communication and coordination, to identify planned actions of one\n        agency that may adversely affect the mission of another and to take proactive\n        steps to prevent such a consequence. In the absence of evidence of such efforts,\n        the interagency efforts at the staff level between agencies have not been\n        consistently successful, and gaps in communication and coordination have\n        resulted in harm to class members.\n\n(Id. at 90.) Indeed, the Special Masters found that “[t]he evidence is that leaders in the key\n\nagencies that have the most significant interagency relationship . . . were unaware of the existing\n\ncourt order or of the responsibility of the Mayor’s designee in implementing it.” (Id. at 92.)\n\nThese findings led the Special Masters to conclude that\n\n        the current lack of awareness by key senior officials of the Order’s existence and\n        its requirements, coupled with the absence of evidence of regular interagency\n        meetings or communications with the Mayor’s designee regarding significant\n        initiatives, and the evidence of breakdowns in interagency coordination leading to\n        the problems discussed above, are all clear and convincing evidence of ongoing\n        noncompliance with this court order which was that this Court Order has not been\n        implemented as intended to remedy a long-standing problem of lack of\n        interagency coordination.\n\n(Id. at 93.)\n\n               2.      Remedy\n\n        The Special Masters concluded “that the plaintiffs have demonstrated by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that there is a need for additional remedial measures ordered by the Court.”\n\n(Id. at 133.) Having been unsuccessful in their attempt to get defendants to agree to their first\n\nchoice of remedy, and after many years of futile attempts to reach an agreement with the Fenty\n\nAdministration as to a workable remedy, the Special Masters’ final report recommended the\n\nappointment of an “Independent Compliance Administrator” who “would be appointed by the\n\nCourt, be accountable only to the Court and would not hold an executive appointment.” (Id. at\n\n134.) As described by the Special Masters, the Independent Compliance Administrator would\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fnot have the same powers of a receiver but would\n\n       serve as the focal point for the compliance efforts of the defendants and work in\n       close collaboration with them, resulting in regular submissions of compliance\n       reports as set forth in the 2001 Plan, and phased judicial disengagement from\n       active supervision of the defendants’ developmental disabilities service system\n       within three years. The Independent Compliance Administrator is not intended to\n       have the powers of a receiver or to generally displace the power and authority of\n       agency heads or subordinate officers. Rather, the authority and role of the\n       Independent Compliance Administrator is limited to actions necessary to achieve\n       compliance with the court orders within a three year period. All District agencies\n       and personnel should be directed to cooperate with the Independent Compliance\n       Administrator. If there is a lack of cooperation, or resistance or intransigence, the\n       Independent Compliance Administrator should be required to report it\n       immediately to the Special Masters or the Court.\n\n(Id. at 134-35.)\n\nIV.    CURRENT PROCEDURAL POSTURE\n\n       At a status conference on August 19, 2009, the Court set a briefing schedule for plaintiffs\n\nto respond to defendants’ motion for vacatur and dismissal, combined with a timetable for filing\n\nobjections to the 2009 Special Masters’ Report. Pursuant to the Court’s order, defendants\n\nrenewed their motion to vacate the consent orders and dismiss the action and combined it with\n\ntheir objections to the 2009 Special Masters’ Report. (Defs.’ Renewed Mot. to Vacate Consent\n\nOrders and To Dismiss Action, Oct. 7, 2009 [“Defs.’ Mot. to Vacate”].) On November 6, 2009,\n\nplaintiffs filed their opposition to that motion (combined with their endorsement of the Special\n\nMasters’ Report and Recommendations (Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Objections to the Special Masters’\n\nReport & Recommendation, and Opp’n to their Mot. to Vacate All Prior Orders and Dismiss the\n\nCase, Nov. 6, 2009 [“Pls.’ Opp’n”]). Plaintiff-intervenor, the United States, and the Quality\n\nTrust, as amicus curiae, also filed oppositions to defendants’ motion. (Pl. Intervenor’s Opp’n to\n\nDefs.’ Renewed Mot. to Vacate Consent Orders and To Dismiss Action, Nov. 6, 2009; Amicus\n\n\n                                                32\n\fCuriae Br. of Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities, Inc., Nov. 11, 2009 [“Quality Trust\n\nOpp’n”].) Defendants filed their reply on December 2, 2009. (Defs.’ Consolidated Reply in\n\nSupport of Mot. to Vacate Consent Orders and To Dismiss Action, Dec. 2, 2009.) On December\n\n17-18, 2009, the Court heard argument on defendants’ motions to vacate and to dismiss and on\n\nwhether to adopt the 2009 Special Masters’ Report. The Court will address herein defendants’\n\nmotions and will address plaintiffs’ request that the Court adopt the 2009 Special Masters’\n\nReport in a subsequent memorandum.\n\n                                           ANALYSIS\n\n       Defendants have moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), “at the\n\nconclusion of a period of monitoring not to exceed three months,24 to vacate the Consent Order\n\nentered on June 14, 1978 . . . together with all subsequent remedial orders, and to dismiss the\n\naction.” (Defs.’ Mot. to Vacate at 1.)\n\n       Rule 60(b)(5) provides that “the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from\n\na final judgment, order, or proceeding” if “the judgment has been satisfied, released or\n\ndischarged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it\n\nprospectively is no longer equitable . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) (emphasis added).\n\nDefendants seek relief solely on the ground that enforcing the existing orders prospectively is\n\n“no longer equitable.” (Defs.’ Mot. to Vacate at 4.) Conceding they are not in compliance with\n\nexisting court orders (see 12/17/09 Tr. at 14-16), defendants nonetheless contend that all court\n\n\n\n       24\n         Under their latest filing, defendants propose the period of court monitoring and\nsupervision to end at the end of 2010. (Defs.’ Mot. for Alternate Remedy at 2.). Defendants,\nhowever, seek to have the Court accept their alternative remedy while still preserving their rights\nto appeal the denial of their motion for vacatur and dismissal. (Id. at 2 & n.2.)\n\n                                                33\n\forders should be vacated because they have “remedied the alleged constitutional and statutory\n\nviolations that gave rise to the 1978 Consent Order and its progeny, and continued federal-court\n\noversight is therefore no longer either equitable or permissible.” (Mem. in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot.\n\nto Vacate at 3 [“Defs.’ Mem.”] (citing Horne v. Flores, 125 S. Ct. 2579 (2009)).\n\n       A party seeking modification of a judgment or order on the ground that applying it\n\nprospectively is no longer equitable “bears the burden of establishing that a significant change in\n\ncircumstances warrants revision of the decree.” Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S.\n\n367, 383 (1992); Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2593. A party seeking relief “may meet its initial burden\n\nby showing . . . a significant change in either factual conditions or in law.” Rufo, 502 U.S. at\n\n384 (emphasis added); Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2593. Changed factual conditions may include\n\nwhen “‘the objects of the decree have been attained.’” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2596 (quoting Frew\n\nv. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 442 (2004)). “To determine the merits of this claim, [a court]\n\n‘need[s] to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement of the original order [is] supported by an\n\nongoing violation of . . . law.’” Id. at 2597 (citing Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 282\n\n(1977)); see also Frew, 540 U.S. at 442 (“The federal court must exercise its equitable powers to\n\nensure that when the objects of the decree have been attained, responsibility for discharging the\n\nState’s obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials.”) If the party seeking\n\nmodification or vacatur can establish that the “objective of the [district court’s] order . . . has\n\nbeen achieved” and “a durable remedy has been implemented, continued enforcement of the\n\norder is not only unnecessary, but improper.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2595. In the alternative, a\n\nsignificant change in law may warrant modification or vacatur of a decree “when the statutory or\n\ndecisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was designed to prevent.” Rufo, 502\n\n\n                                                  34\n\fU.S. at 388; see also Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2595 (“[C]ourts must remain attentive to the fact that\n\n‘federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that\n\ndoes not violate [federal law] or does not flow from such a violation.’” (quoting Milliken, 433\n\nU.S. at 282 )).\n\n       In considering a request for modification in an institutional reform case, a district court\n\nmust take a “flexible approach.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2594; see also Rufo, 502 U.S. at 381; Frew,\n\n540 U.S. at 441. “A flexible approach allows courts to ensure that ‘responsibility for discharging\n\nthe State’s obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials’ when the circumstances\n\nwarrant.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2595 (quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 442). “If the State establishes\n\nreason to modify the decree, the court should make the necessary changes; where it has not done\n\nso, however, the decree should be enforced according to its terms.” Frew, 540 U.S. at 442.\n\nRelief is warranted if the significant change “renders continued enforcement ‘detrimental to the\n\npublic interest.’” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2593 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384).\n\n       Defendants contend that there has been both a significant change in law and a significant\n\nchange in factual conditions and that these changes satisfy Horne’s requirements for vacatur.\n\nDefendants could, of course, obtain vacatur by complying with the court orders. However, they\n\nconcede they have not achieved compliance. (12/17/09 Tr. at 20-21.) Nonetheless, they argue\n\nthat the objects of the court orders have been attained because (1) the scope of the right to\n\nhabilitation recognized in the 1978 Consent Order and the many subsequent consent orders is\n\npremised on an incorrect understanding of the law, as established by the Supreme Court’s 1982\n\ndecision in Youngberg and, therefore, those parts of the consent orders that are dependent on that\n\ndefinition are “extraconstitutional,”(i.e., not based on any constitutional violation) and thus are\n\n\n                                                 35\n\flegally unenforceable; and (2) the remaining parts of the 1978 Consent Order and subsequent\n\nconsent orders impose requirements that exceed minimal constitutional standards, and thus,\n\nunder Horne, defendants are entitled to vacatur once they achieve the minimum, which they\n\nclaim to have done.\n\n       Defendants’ argument for vacatur fails because (1) Youngberg does not represent a\n\nsignificant change in law (Section I(A)); (2) even if Youngberg constituted a significant change,\n\ndefendants failed to make that argument within a reasonable time after Youngberg was decided\n\n(Section I(B)); (3) no matter how Youngberg is interpreted, it can only support a limited\n\nmodification of the consent orders (Section I(C)); (4) defendants have misinterpreted Horne\n\nwhen arguing that the objectives of the consent decrees have been met because they have\n\nsatisfied the constitutional floor (Section II(A)); and (5) defendants have failed to establish that a\n\ndurable remedy is in place (Section II(B)).\n\nI.     DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO VACATUR BASED ON A CHANGE\n       IN LAW\n\n       A.      Youngberg Was Not a Significant Change in Law\n\n        According to defendants, Youngberg was a significant change in law because “[i]n its\n\n1978 Consent Order, this Court adopted a much more expansive definition of the Fifth\n\nAmendment right to habilitative care and treatment” than Youngberg recognizes or permits.\n\n(Defs.’ Mem. at 16 n.13.) Specifically, defendants take issue with the portions of the 1978\n\nConsent Order, to which they agreed, emphasized below:\n\n       Each class member has a federal constitutional right, based upon the Due Process\n       Clause of the Fifth Amendment, to receive habilitative care and treatment in the\n       alternative least restrictive of individual liberty and to be kept free from harm.\n\n       Habilitation is the process by which a resident is assisted in acquiring and\n\n                                                 36\n\f       maintaining those life skills which enable him to cope more effectively with the\n       demands of his own person and of his environment and to raise the level of his\n       physical, mental, and social capabilities. Habilitation includes but is not limited\n       to[] programs of formal, structured education and training.\n\n       Habilitative care in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty means\n       living as normally as possible and receiving appropriate individualized services\n       in the community in the least separate, most integrated and least restrictive\n       settings.\n\n       As used in this Order, “integrated” refers to the integration of mentally retarded\n       persons with nonretarded persons in the community.\n\n(Id. (quoting 1978 Consent Order at 2 ¶ 3) (emphases added).) According to defendants, “[t]he\n\nportions of this definition emphasized above are not required by the Fifth Amendment’s due\n\nprocess clause but, rather, reach far beyond any constitutionally guaranteed minimum.” (Id. at\n\n16-17 n.13) Defendants maintain, for the first time in over 30 years, that they “cannot now be\n\nbound by their three-decades-old consent to the use of an overly expansive, erroneous\n\ndefinition.” (Id.) Rather, they argue, “this Court should disregard the 1978 Consent Order’s\n\nincorrect statement of the applicable standard and implement the correct standard, which the\n\nDistrict has more than satisfied.” (Id. at 17 n.13.)\n\n        It is well-established that a Court can modify or vacate a consent decree based on a\n\nsignificant change in law. In many cases where this type of argument has been raised, it is\n\nundisputed that the law has in fact changed, that a legal basis for the decree has evaporated, and\n\nthe only question for the Court is whether the change in the legal landscape warrants\n\nmodification (or vacatur) of the decree. See, e.g, Sys. Fed’n No. 91, Ry. Employes’ Dep’t, AFL-\n\nCIO v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 652 (1961) (“The parties have no power to require of the court\n\ncontinuing enforcement of rights the statute no longer gives.”); Sweeton v. Brown, 27 F.3d 1162,\n\n1164-65 (6th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (dissolving injunction pertaining to state parole procedures\n\n                                                 37\n\fwhere subsequent controlling caselaw established that there was no federal due process interest\n\nat stake and thus that the “legal theory and analysis upon which the consent decree was\n\nformulated was erroneous”); Evans v. City of Chicago,10 F.3d 474, 480 (7th Cir. 1993) (en banc)\n\n(vacating consent decree because its “continued enforcement” was “inequitable” where the\n\nunderlying “substantial claim” under federal law had evaporated); Doe v. Briley, 511 F. Supp. 2d\n\n904, 923-26 (M.D. Tenn. 2007) (dissolving consent decree precluding publication of names of\n\npersons arrested but not convicted due to Supreme Court decision holding that due process did\n\nnot protect against stigmatizing publications by law enforcement officials), aff’d, 562 F.3d 777\n\n(6th Cir. 2009).\n\n       Here, however, the first question for the Court is whether there has in fact been a\n\nsignificant change in the law. See, e.g., United States v. Rueth Dev. Co., 335 F.3d 598, 604 (7th\n\nCir. 2003) (refusing to modify or vacate consent decree where Supreme Court decision “did not\n\nexpressly make [the relevant regulation] illegal” even though that “reading might be the only\n\nlogical extension of the case”); see also Rufo, 502 U.S. at 389 (“To hold that a clarification in the\n\nlaw automatically opens the door for relitigation of the merits of every affected consent decree\n\nwould undermine the finality of such agreements and could serve as a disincentive to negotiation\n\nof settlements in institutional reform litigation.”) That is, does the 1978 Consent Order, in\n\ndefendants’ words, use “an overly expansive, erroneous definition” of the right to habilitative\n\ncare and treatment. (Defs.’ Mot. at 14 n.2.) As explained herein, the answer to this question is\n\nsimply that defendants cannot argue for vacatur based on a significant change in the law.\n\n               1.      Youngberg\n\n       In Youngberg, the Supreme Court considered “for the first time the substantive rights of\n\n\n                                                 38\n\finvoluntarily committed mentally retarded persons under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n\nConstitution.” 457 U.S. at 314. The plaintiff in Youngberg, Nicholas Romeo, had been\n\ninvoluntarily committed under the laws of Pennsylvania to a state institution. As described in\n\nthe Supreme Court’s decision, he was “profoundly retarded,” with “the mental capacity of an 18-\n\nmonth old child, with an I.Q. between 8 and 10,” who could not “talk and lack[ed] the most basic\n\nself-care skills.” Id. at 309. He had been committed to a state facility at the age of 26 because\n\nhis mother could no longer care for him after his father’s death. After he suffered a number of\n\ninjuries, both self-inflicted and from other residents, his mother filed a complaint in federal\n\ndistrict court. The precise question before the Supreme Court was whether a person\n\ninvoluntarily committed to a state institution for the mentally retarded had “substantive rights\n\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to (I) safe conditions of\n\nconfinement; (ii) freedom from bodily restraints; and (iii) training, or ‘habilitation.’”25 Id. at\n\n309.\n\n        Based on its prior decisions, the Court concluded, without the need for explication, that\n\nthe plaintiff’s right to safe conditions and right to freedom from bodily restraint were the “core\n\nof the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause,” noting that since both rights survived\n\ncriminal conviction and incarceration, they certainly survived involuntary commitment. Id. at\n\n315-16 (quotations omitted). As for the right to habilitation, the Court had never before\n\n\n\n       25\n         It was conceded by the State of Pennsylvania that the plaintiff “ha[d] a right to adequate\nfood, shelter, clothing, and medical care,” so the Court limited its inquiry to the narrow question\nof “whether liberty interests also exist in safety, freedom of movement, and training.”\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 315 (emphasis added). As discussed infra, this fact is relevant because\nno matter how Youngberg is interpreted, it has no effect on a host of issues covered by the\nconsent decrees and the 2001 Plan. See infra pp. 55-58.\n\n                                                  39\n\fconsidered whether such a right existed or what its scope might be. Ultimately, it held that\n\nplaintiff had a right to the habilitation he sought – a right to “minimally adequate or reasonable\n\ntraining to ensure safety and freedom from undue restraint.” Id. at 319. In reaching this\n\nconclusion, the Court noted that because the plaintiff “seeks only training related to safety and\n\nfreedom from restraints, this case does not present the difficult question whether a mentally\n\nretarded person, involuntarily committed to a state institution, has some general constitutional\n\nright to training per se, even when no type or amount of training would lead to freedom.” Id. at\n\n318 (emphasis added). In a footnote, the Court added:\n\n       It is not feasible, as is evident from the variety of language and formulations in\n       the opinions below and the various briefs here, to define or identify the type of\n       training that may be required in every case. A court properly may start with the\n       generalization that there is a right to minimally adequate training. The basic\n       requirement of adequacy, in terms more familiar to courts, may be stated as that\n       training which is reasonable in light of identifiable liberty interests and the\n       circumstances of the case.\n\nId. at 319 n.25.\n\n       Having concluded that the plaintiff in Youngberg retained liberty interests in safety,\n\nfreedom from bodily restraint, and minimally adequate habilitation, the Court addressed the\n\nquestion of how a court should identify possible violations of those rights. It held that whether\n\nRomeo’s rights had been violated “must be determined by balancing his liberty interests against\n\nthe relevant state interests,” but that this balancing “cannot be left to the unguided discretion of a\n\njudge or jury.” Id. at 321. Rather, “the proper standard for determining whether a State\n\nadequately has protected the rights of the involuntarily committed mentally retarded” is for a\n\ncourt to “make certain that professional judgment was in fact exercised.” Id. (quotations\n\nomitted). Thus, the Court concluded, “the State [was] under a duty to provide respondent with\n\n\n                                                 40\n\fsuch training as an appropriate professional would consider reasonable to ensure his safety and\n\nto facilitate his ability to function free from bodily restraints.” Id. at 324.\n\n        In a concurring opinion, Justice Blackmun, joined by Justices Brennan and O’Connor,\n\nnoted that the majority opinion “properly leaves unresolved” “whether respondent has an\n\nindependent constitutional claim, grounded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, to that ‘habilitation’ or training necessary to preserve those basic self-care skills he\n\npossessed when he first entered” the state institution. Id. at 325, 327. Justice Blackmun opined\n\nthat “it would be consistent with the Court’s reasoning today to include within the minimally\n\nadequate training required by the Constitution such training as is reasonably necessary to prevent\n\na person’s pre-existing self-care skills from deteriorating because of his commitment.” Id. at\n\n327 (quotation and citation omitted). As explained by Justice Blackmun,\n\n        If a person could demonstrate that he entered a state institution with minimal self-\n        care skills, but lost those skills after commitment because of the State’s\n        unreasonable refusal to provide him training, then, it seems to me, he has alleged\n        a loss of liberty quite distinct from – and as serious as – the loss of safety and\n        freedom from unreasonable restraints. For many mentally retarded people, the\n        difference between the capacity to do things for themselves within an institution\n        and total dependence on the institution for all of their needs is as much liberty as\n        they ever will know.\n\nId. at 327.\n\n        Thus, contrary to defendants’ suggestion, there is absolutely nothing in the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Youngberg that overrules the 1978 Consent Order and the subsequent orders\n\nthat were entered both before and after Youngberg regarding plaintiffs’ constitutional right “to\n\nreceive habilitative care and treatment in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty” or\n\nthe definition of what that right means. Indeed, the Court in Youngberg expressly stated that it\n\nwas not answering the “difficult question whether a mentally retarded person, involuntarily\n\n                                                   41\n\fcommitted to a state institution, has some general constitutional right to training per se.” Id. at\n\n318.\n\n               2.      Post-Youngberg Cases\n\n       In the almost 30 years since Youngberg was decided, the Supreme Court has not revisited\n\nthe daunting task of explicating the constitutional rights of the involuntarily-committed\n\ndevelopmentally disabled, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\n\nCircuit has not had the occasion to ever address this issue. Thus, there is no controlling\n\nprecedent, other than Youngberg, and there is no consensus among the courts regarding\n\ndefendants’ proposed interpretation of Youngberg. On the contrary, courts and judges have\n\nreached differing conclusions about Youngberg’s scope.\n\n       For example, in Clark v. Cohen, 794 F.2d 79 (3d Cir. 1986), the court held that plaintiff’s\n\nrights were violated where she was confined at an institution “in the face of unanimous\n\nprofessional opinion that she should be placed in a far less restrictive environment . . . .” Id at\n\n87. In a concurring opinion, Judge Edward Becker elaborated on his view of the scope of the\n\nconstitutional right to habilitation,26 which he believed Youngberg did not address. See id. at 92-\n\n98 (Becker, J., concurring). In his view, “Youngberg dealt exclusively with training related to\n\nphysical restraints; the Court expressly stated that it was neither considering nor ruling on any\n\nbroader right to habilitation.” Id. at 95. Citing Justice Blackmun’s concurrence in Youngberg,\n\nJudge Becker stated that he also “would endorse the non-deterioration principle,” because “[t]he\n\nmentally disabled cannot have meaningful autonomy, and hence meaningful liberty, without\n\n\n       26\n        The judge examined two possible theories of the right to habilitation – quid pro quo and\nparens patriae – and concluded that both apply to a person who has been involuntarily\ncommitted. Clark, 794 F.2d at 95.\n\n                                                 42\n\fbasic skills; therefore, for the state to allow disabled persons’ skills to deteriorate is as sure a\n\ndenial of their liberty as is their confinement to an institution.” Id. at 96. He then went further\n\nthan Justice Blackmun, endorsing what he called a “[m]odified non-deterioration principle”:\n\n        the State should be required to provide such a person with at least as much\n        training as would match the improvement that he or she would have experienced\n        if never committed. The reasoning behind this position is analogous to the\n        reasoning supporting the non-deterioration principle: by committing people and\n        preventing them from developing self-care skills, the state is effectively depriving\n        them of the opportunity to develop and exercise their autonomy. This is a\n        deprivation of their due process right to liberty. . . . [Thus,] involuntarily civilly\n        committed persons have a right to treatment sufficient to develop their self-care\n        skills to at least the level at which they would be if the persons had not been\n        institutionalized.\n\n794 F.2d at 96. As he explained:\n\n        Because [the plaintiff’s] institutionalization has led to her debilitation, the modified\n        non-deterioration principle requires the state to provide [her] . . . with training and\n        treatment sufficient to put her in the position in which she would have been had she\n        never been institutionalized. Because it appears from the numerous, uncontradicted\n        doctors’ reports in the record that placement in a [community living arrangement]\n        is the only or best way for [her] to receive the training she is due, I believe she has\n        a right to placement in the [community living arrangement], until she has acquired\n        the skills she would have had had she never been institutionalized.\n\nId. at 97. Finally, and significantly, Judge Becker’s opinion left open “the question whether the\n\ninvoluntarily civilly committed have a right to even greater habilitation than the modified non-\n\ndeterioration principle would allow.” Id. at 98. For example, as noted in the concurring opinion,\n\n        [i]t might be argued . . . under the theories discussed here or some other theory of\n        habilitation, that the involuntarily civilly committed have a right to as much\n        habilitation as their capacity will allow. Alternatively, one might argue that all\n        involuntarily civilly committed persons are entitled to treatment up to an absolute\n        level, regardless of their status upon entrance to the institution.\n\nId. at 98 (emphasis added). Thus, according to this circuit judge, Youngberg is merely the\n\nstarting point for defining the constitutional right to habilitation; it by no means precludes\n\n\n                                                   43\n\frecognition of additional rights for plaintiffs who, unlike the plaintiff in Youngberg, could\n\nbenefit from more extensive habilitation.\n\n       The court’s decision in Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 699 F. Supp. 1178, 1184 (W.D.N.C.\n\n1988), aff’d, 902 F.2d 250 (4th Cir. 1990), is another example of a post-Youngberg case that\n\nendorses a broader right to habilitation than defendants advocate here.27 In Thomas S., the court\n\nheld that the State of North Carolina was violating the constitutional rights of approximately four\n\nhundred mentally retarded persons who were confined in the state’s four psychiatric hospitals.\n\nThe court approved the parties’ agreement that in terms of habilitation, “minimum professional\n\nstandards require developmentally oriented habilitation for persons with mental retardation.” Id.\n\nat 1192. Such developmental habilitation requires, inter alia; “[a]dequate involvement in\n\ncommunity activities,” defined as “being as involved as that individual is capable of being at the\n\ntime”; “a good interdisciplinary evaluation” that provides an “adequate assessment of the\n\nindividual needs of each class member”; “[p]roperly trained staff”; “[h]umane living conditions,”\n\nwhich includes more than “endless days of boredom without variation”; “treat[ment] in as\n\nnormal a setting as possible” featuring “access to ordinary activities,” and the chance “to learn\n\nand grow through observing and participating in the commonplace events of daily life,”\n\n“developmental training and structured programs,” including “training in basic self-care skills,\n\ncommunity living skills, speech therapy, and vocational services.” Id. at 1192-94. The court\n\nalso found that “[b]ecause vocational activities are often a key to greater independence and\n\nenjoyment of liberty, they are for most class members an essential service to avoid unnecessary\n\n\n       27\n          Although the Fourth Circuit stated that it rejected the idea that class members “had a\nright to treatment in the least restrictive environment,” Thomas S., 902 F. 2d at 253-54, it also\naffirmed the district court’s order which arguably could not exist absent such a right.\n\n                                                 44\n\frestraint.” Id. at 1194. The court relied on its finding that there was “professional consensus\n\nthat developmental, behavior-based treatment called ‘habilitation’ is the appropriate milieu for\n\npeople with mental retardation.” Id. at 1185. Finally, the court found that habilitation “is\n\ndefined as . . . [t]he process by which the staff of an agency assists an individual to acquire and\n\nmaintain those life skills that enable the individual to cope more effectively with the demands of\n\nhis or her own person and environmental and social functioning. Habilitation includes, but is not\n\nlimited to, programs of formal structured education and treatment.” Id. at 1184 (quoting\n\nAccreditation Council for Services for Mentally Retarded and Other Developmentally Disabled\n\nPersons (1981 ed.) (quotation and citation omitted)). Not only did the court recognize a broad\n\nright to habilitation, it emphasized that plaintiffs were entitled both to appropriate professional\n\ndecisionmaking and implementation of those decisions. See id. at 1185 (faulting defendants for\n\nnot implementing community placement recommendations by treating professionals and noting\n\nthat “[t]he record is replete with other examples of placement and treatment recommendations\n\nbeing ignored or their implementation being unjustifiably delayed”).28\n\n       Certainly there are cases in which courts applying Youngberg have defined the right to\n\nhabilitation more narrowly than the Court and the parties did in the 1978 Consent Order. For\n\nexample, in Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.\n\n1984), the Second Circuit held that the right to freedom from undue restraint included the right\n\n\n\n       28\n         The court in Thomas S. also found that “the conditions and services at the state\npsychiatric institutions are substantially below minimally accepted professional standard” in part\nbecause of “[i]nadequate treatment plans and inadequate documentation of their\nimplementation.” Id. at 1197. As discussed herein, the constitutional requirement that\nprofessional judgment be exercised in making decisions also requires that those decisions be\nimplemented. See infra pp. 61-62.\n\n                                                 45\n\fto be free from “excess locking of doors, locking of otherwise ambulatory persons into\n\nwheelchairs, and failing to put on leg braces for individuals who can walk with their assistance,”\n\nbut it did not include “visiting shops, restaurants and recreational facilities in the outside\n\ncommunity.” Id. at 1247. It also held that there was no “entitlement to community placement or\n\na ‘least restrictive environment’ under the federal Constitution,” and that “[w]here the state does\n\nnot provide treatment designed to improve a mentally retarded individual’s condition, it deprives\n\nthe individual of nothing guaranteed by the Constitution; it simply fails to grant a benefit of\n\noptimum treatment that it is under no constitutional obligation to grant.” Id. at 1250; see also\n\nLelsz v. Kavanagh, 807 F.2d 1243, 1250-51 (5th Cir. 1987) (no “right to habilitation in the least\n\nrestrictive environment” because “[t]he constitutional minimum standard of habilitation . . .\n\nrelate[s], not to the qualitative betterment of a retarded person’s life, but only to the training\n\nnecessary to afford him safety and freedom from bodily restraint”); Phillips v. Thompson, 715\n\nF.2d 365, 368 (7th Cir. 1983) (“With respect to training, Youngberg teaches that, at the most, the\n\nclass members were entitled to minimally adequate training as is reasonable in light of their\n\ninterest in freedom of movement and that deference must be shown to the professional judgment\n\nof those directing the operation of the institution. Such training as is required, therefore, is\n\ntraining to enhance the ability of the class members to exercise their right to liberty of\n\nmovement.”); Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hosp. & Training Sch., 757 F. Supp. 1243, 1309 (D.N.M.\n\n1990) (“no substantive due process right to habilitation in the least restrictive environment and\n\nthere is no constitutional right to placement in a community setting”), rev’d in part, 964 F.2d\n\n980 (10th Cir. 1992); S.H. v. Edwards, 886 F.2d 292 (11th Cir. 1989) (affirming district court’s\n\ndenial of “plaintiffs’ claims for relief in the nature of habilitation in the least restrictive\n\n\n                                                   46\n\fenvironment in accordance with the recommendation of professional treatment staff” (quotation\n\nomitted)).\n\n       And then there are cases that fall somewhere in between. For example, in Association for\n\nRetarded Citizens of North Dakota v. Olson, 561 F. Supp. 473 (N.D. 1982), aff’d, 713 F.2d 1384\n\n(8th Cir. 1983), the court held that\n\n       the right to freedom from undue restraint . . . imposes a standard for the court’s\n       determination whether professional judgment is being exercised in the use of\n       medication and physical means to restrain residents. This right obligates the state\n       to provide capable retarded residents with reasonable opportunities to make trips\n       into the outside communities. It also tests the freedoms allowed to residents, such\n       as the opportunity to make small personal decisions concerning what to wear,\n       what to eat, recreation, etc. This right against unreasonable restraint also\n       involves the much discussed question of alternatives to institutionalization, such\n       as community homes. Prior to the Youngberg decision, this court held that the\n       [F]ourteenth [A]mendment secures a right to the least restrictive practicable\n       alternatives to institutionalization. While the Youngberg decision does not\n       directly address this specific right, the Court’s analysis indicates that it would\n       reject an absolute right to the least restrictive alternatives . . . . Following this\n       analysis, this court must conclude that a constitutional right to the least restrictive\n       method of care or treatment exists only insofar as professional judgment\n       determines that such alternatives would measurably enhance the resident’s\n       enjoyment of basic liberty interests.\n\nId. at 486 (emphasis added; citation omitted). As for “the right to minimally adequate training,”\n\nthe court held that “the resident possesses a right to training only insofar as that training serves to\n\nenhance or further that resident’s exercise of basic liberty.” Id. at 486-87. Thus, it does not\n\ninclude “training in music or vocational skills,” but it does include “training in walking or basic\n\ncommunication . . . if the resident could benefit therefrom . . . .” Id. at 487. It also includes “a\n\nright to reasonable training which enables the resident to acquire or maintain minimum self-care\n\nskills – skills in feeding, bathing, dressing, self-control, and toilet training.” Id. (emphasis\n\nomitted). The court also adopted Justice Blackmun’s view that the right to training includes\n\n\n                                                  47\n\ftraining “to enable them to maintain the minimum self-care skills that they possessed when they\n\nentered the institution,” and based on this view, it held that the “the acquisition and maintenance\n\nof those skills [are] essential to the exercise of basic liberties.” Id. at 487 (emphasis added).\n\n       Accordingly, all that can be said about the post-Youngberg cases, none of which is\n\ncontrolling precedent, is that they disagree about how narrowly Youngberg should be interpreted\n\nand even if interpreted narrowly, how it should be applied to everyday situations. This very lack\n\nof clarity dooms defendants’ suggestion that Youngberg precludes recognition of a constitutional\n\nright to habilitation as described in the 1978 Consent Order.\n\n       In the end, the critical question in a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether defendants have met\n\ntheir burden to show that Youngberg was a “significant change” in the law. They have not.\n\nThere is language in Youngberg that arguably contradicts defendants’ reading of the case; there\n\nis no subsequent Supreme Court decision or post-Youngberg decision from our circuit court\n\nregarding the meaning of Youngberg; and among those that have addressed it, there is no\n\nagreement. In the face of disagreement about what the law is and no controlling precedent, the\n\nmere fact that some courts have adopted the interpretation defendants propose here is not\n\nsufficient to meet that burden. Moreover, as explained herein, defendants’ position that\n\nYoungberg is a significant change in law is seriously undermined by the fact that for almost 28\n\nyears they have accepted the constitutional standard in the 1978 Consent Order and promised to\n\nachieve compliance with court orders based on that standard.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  48\n\f       B.      Defendants’ Argument Regarding Youngberg Was Not Made Within a\n               Reasonable Time\n\n       Defendants concede that if Youngberg is not treated as a significant change in law, their\n\nmotion to vacate must fail.29 But even if the Court agreed with defendants that Youngberg\n\nrepresented a significant change in the law, that does not ensure success under Rule 60(b)(5).30\n\nSee Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384. It remains for the Court to decide whether modification in light of\n\nthat change is warranted. See id. at 391. Given the particular (and probably unique) facts of this\n\ncase, the Court does not believe that the relief sought by defendants is warranted.\n\n       Rule 60(b)(5) requires that a motion for modification be made within “a reasonable\n\ntime.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). “[W]hat constitutes ‘reasonable time’ for a filing under Rule\n\n60(b) depends on the facts of each case.” Ingram v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.,\n\n371 F.3d 950, 952 (7th Cir. 2004); see also McCorvey v. Hill, 385 F.3d 846, 849 n.4 (5th Cir.\n\n2004); Fed. Land Bank of St. Louis v. Cupples Bros., 889 F.2d 764, 767 (8th Cir. 1989). Factors\n\nto consider include “the length of the delay, the explanations for the delay, the prejudice to the\n\nopposing party caused by the delay and the circumstances warranting relief.” Associated\n\nBuilders & Contractors v. Mich. Dep’t of Labor, 543 F.3d 275 (6th Cir. 2008); see also\n\nShakman v. City of Chicago, 426 F.3d 925 (7th Cir. 2005) (relevant factors include “the litigants’\n\n\n       29\n        At oral argument, the Court asked defense counsel: “If I say the ‘78 [order] is a correct\nstatement and that the subsequent orders incorporate and flow from [it], what happens then? End\nof my analysis?” Defendants’ counsel replied: “I think it is the end of your analysis, Your\nHonor.” (12/17/09 Tr. at 49.)\n       30\n         As discussed infra, defendants also ignore the fact that even if the Court accepts their\nYoungberg argument, it would justify, at most, partial modification of some court orders\npertaining to plaintiffs’ right to habilitation and would have no impact on those portions of the\norders, arguably the most critical provisions, which address plaintiffs’ constitutional rights to\nsafety and health care. (See infra pp. 54-58.)\n\n                                                 49\n\fknowledge of the grounds for relief,” “the interest in finality, the reason for delay, the practical\n\nability of the litigant to learn earlier of the grounds relied upon, and [the consideration of]\n\nprejudice [if any] to other parties” (quotations omitted)). Even applying the flexible approach a\n\ncourt must take in considering a Rule 60(b)(5) motion in institutional reform litigation, see\n\nHorne, 129 S. Ct. at 2594-95; Rufo, 502 U.S. at 381, defendants’ Youngberg argument comes\n\ndecades too late, long after the entry of countless remedial court orders, many of which\n\ndefendant agreed to and all of which were relied upon these many years by the Court, the Special\n\nMasters, the plaintiffs and the Department of Justice.\n\n       The Supreme Court decided Youngberg in 1982, almost 30 years ago. Defendants could\n\nhave sought modification of the 1978 Consent Order at any time thereafter based on the same\n\nargument they make today – that Youngberg effectively overruled parts of this Court’s 1978\n\nconsent decree, thereby requiring modification of that decree. And if there was any question that\n\na change in law could provide the basis for modification of a consent decree, that question was\n\nanswered in 1992 by Rufo. 502 U.S. at 393. Indeed, there have been a number of cases in the\n\nintervening years, which defendants rely upon, where parties have sought and courts have agreed\n\nthat modifications or vacatur based on a change in law was appropriate. See, e.g., Sweeton, 27\n\nF.3d at 1164-65; Evans, 10 F.3d at 480, 482-83; Briley, 511 F. Supp. 2d at 927.31\n\n       Nor is this a case where defendants can justify the delay by claiming that they were\n\n“unaware” of the existence of the decree or its impact. Cf. Briley, 511 F. Supp. 2d at 912\n\n(“Municipal entities, . . . however, do not have perfect institutional memory, and where a consent\n\n\n       31\n         Significantly, defendants cannot justify their delay by arguing that Horne is the change\nin law that they are relying on. In fact, defendants filed their motion even before Horne was\ndecided on June 25, 2009.\n\n                                                  50\n\fdecree has gone unenforced for many years, the individuals who administer those entities may\n\nnot have any knowledge of its existence.”). To the contrary, defendants have been in Court\n\ncontinually and repeatedly since the 1978 Consent Order defending against plaintiffs’ charges of\n\nnoncompliance, and when their efforts failed for good reason, numerous substantive court orders\n\nresulted.32\n\n        The only reason defendants give for their 27-year delay in making their Youngberg\n\nargument is that they only just realized that the 1978 Consent Order was based on a\n\n“misunderstanding of the governing law.” (See 12/17/09 Tr. at 8.) Even assuming such a\n\n“mistake” could ever justify a delay of this magnitude, it does not do so here. Defendants cannot\n\nmake a plausible argument that they, along with everyone else involved in this case, have been\n\noperating under a misguided view of the law and only now, with the arrival of a new Attorney\n\nGeneral, has the law become clear. (See 12/17/09 Tr. at 19.) Not only did it take 27 years for\n\ndefendants to realize their purported mistake, during that period, they entered into a number of\n\nadditional consent orders and agreements that were designed to achieve the constitutional\n\nstandards enunciated in the 1978 Consent Order. (See 1983 Consent Order; 1995 Reference\n\nOrder; 2001 Joint Findings of Fact; 2001 Plan; 2001 Consent Order; 2007 90-Day Consent\n\nOrder.) For example, in 1995 defendants “admit[ted] that the District has a continuing\n\nresponsibility to provide the class members with habilitation in accordance with their needs” and\n\n\n\n        32\n         (See, e.g., 1981 Consent Order; 1983 Consent Order; Jan. 1990 Contempt Order; Apr.\n1990 Contempt Order; Order Denying Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions, May 15, 1991;\n1995 Contempt Order; 1996 Order & Remedial Plan; 2001 Joint Findings of Fact, Consent\nOrder, Plan for Compliance; 2004 Coordination Order; 2007 Order and Opinion on Liability;\n2007 90-Day Consent Order; 2008 Special Masters’ Report re 90-Day Consent Order; 2009\nSpecial Masters’ Report.)\n\n                                                51\n\f“admit[ted] that they also are required to provide adequate medical care, psychological care, day\n\nprogramming, community residential placements and other support systems as set forth in the\n\nclass members’ [individual habilitation plans].” (1995 Contempt Order at 5-6.) And as recently\n\nas September 2007, the current administration under Mayor Fenty agreed to take a number of\n\nspecific actions, including “recruiting five new providers” and ensuring that the residences\n\noperated by these providers, inter alia, “are located close to shops, restaurants, community\n\nresources and public transportation, or there is transportation available to class members in order\n\nto access these resources” – an obligation that clearly flows from the parts of the 1978 Consent\n\nOrder the District now contends are “extraconstitutional.” (2007 90-Day Order at 2.) Moreover,\n\nthe Court’s March 2007 Liability Opinion and the 2009 Special Masters’ Report are replete with\n\nreferences to a legal standard that only now does the District find convenient to repudiate.\n\n“Modification of a consent decree may be warranted when changed factual conditions make\n\ncompliance with the decree substantially more onerous,” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384, but not simply\n\nbecause “it is no longer convenient to live with the terms of a consent decree.” Id. at 383.\n\n       Finally, and perhaps most importantly, defendants’ actions over the past 30 years – their\n\nrepeated representations, promises and agreements – have led the Court and the plaintiffs to\n\nbelieve that defendants had every intention of complying with the existing orders. For example,\n\nin asking the Court in February 2007 to delay its liability ruling, the District stated that it was\n\n“cognizant that much remains to be done to bring DDS into compliance with outstanding court\n\norders and the 2001 Plan,” but assured the Court that the “Fenty Administration is fully\n\ncommitted to the success of the new agency, the delivery of improved services and care to the\n\nconsumers served by the agency, and compliance with the 2001 Plan.” (Defs.’ Notice of Filing\n\n\n                                                  52\n\fof Supplemental Info. in Resp. to the Court Monitor’s Quarterly Report at 8, Feb. 5, 2007\n\n(emphasis added).) Again, in May 2008, Peter Nickles, the Attorney General for the District,\n\nassured the Court “I am not seeking . . . to take away what [the plaintiffs] won.” (Hr’g Tr. at 37,\n\nMay 15, 2008.) But that is exactly what the District seeks to do.\n\n       Everyone, including the three judges of this Court, who has struggled with this case for\n\nover 30 years has relied on defendants’ repeated promises that they intended to comply.\n\nPlaintiffs have repeatedly entered into new agreements with defendants. (See, e.g., 1981\n\nConsent Decree, 1983 Consent Decree; 2001 Consent Order; 2001 Plan; 2007 90-Day Consent\n\nOrder.) Plaintiff have also withdrawn motions to find defendants in noncompliance or in\n\ncontempt that they might otherwise have successfully pursued. (See, e.g., 1983 Consent Order at\n\n14 (withdrawing motion for contempt); Evans, 139 F. Supp. 2d at 84 (waiving “all claims for\n\npast contumacious conduct of defendants as of the date of the entry of the [2001] Consent Order\n\nand approval of the Settlement Agreement”).)\n\n       Moreover, the Court has on numerous occasions endorsed agreements between the\n\nparties and adopted them as court orders. (See, e.g., 1981 Consent Decree, 1983 Consent\n\nDecree; 2001 Consent Order; 2001 Plan; 2001 Joint Findings of Fact; 2007 90-Day Order.)\n\nJudge Stanley Harris’s reliance on defendants’ stated intention to achieve compliance with\n\nexisting court orders is especially apparent in his 2001 opinion, wherein he notes that “[t]he\n\ndispute seemed intractable until last year, towards the end of which there were commendable and\n\nextensive efforts by Mrs. Farrell, Mr. Sundram, and counsel for the parties seeking to resolve the\n\nproblems faced by all.” Evans, 139 F. Supp. 2d at 85. The Court commended the Special\n\nMasters and counsel not only for “resolving their differences, but for the exceptionally thorough\n\n\n                                                53\n\fmanner in which they have agreed upon procedures for dealing with the problems that have\n\npersisted for so long” and explained that it approved the Plan and adopted the parties’ consent\n\norder and settlement agreement because it “readily conclude[d] that the proposed compromise of\n\nthe controversy, which will be of substantially greater benefit to the class than would continued\n\nlitigation over how to deal with past conduct by defendants, is fair, reasonable, and adequate.”\n\nId.; (see also 1995 Contempt Order at 1 (emphasizing that “[a]n integral part of this litigation has\n\nbeen the closure of Forest Haven and the relocation of class members to community living\n\narrangements with adequate habilitation suitable to each class member” and “[t]o this end, the\n\nCourt has entered numerous orders, including consent orders between the parties, to safeguard\n\nthe rights of class members and ensure their adequate and appropriate habilitation.”).)\n\n       In sum, no factor supports a finding that defendants have filed their Rule 60(b)(5)\n\nmotion, to the extent it is based Youngberg, within a “reasonable time.” Defendants have no\n\nexcuse for their delay; they have repeatedly consented to the constitutional standard as stated in\n\nthe 1978 Consent Order; they successfully convinced the plaintiffs and the Court on numerous\n\noccasions that they intended to comply with the court orders; and the vulnerable class members,\n\ntheir counsel, the Department of Justice and three judges of this Court have relied to their\n\ndetriment on the District’s endless promises.\n\n       C.      At Most, Defendants’ View of Youngberg Supports Only a Limited\n               Modification of the Consent Orders\n\n       Even if defendants could argue that Youngberg was a significant change in the law\n\n(which they cannot), that argument would support nothing more than a limited modification of\n\nthe consent orders. In the first place, even if Youngberg changed the law with respect to the\n\nscope of the constitutional right to habilitation, that would not undermine the legal basis for the\n\n                                                 54\n\fhost of provisions in the court orders and the 2001 Plan that relate solely to health care and\n\nsafety. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16 (not disputed that plaintiff had “a right to adequate\n\nfood, shelter, clothing, and medical care” and Court held that right to safe conditions and right to\n\nfreedom from bodily restraint were the “core of the liberty protected by the Due Process\n\nClause”). Requirements relating to these rights (as opposed to habilitation) are a substantial part\n\nof the challenged court orders and the 2001 Plan. (See 1978 Consent Order; Evans, 459 F. Supp.\n\nat 484, 488-89; 1981 Consent Order at 6-7; 1983 Consent Order at 4-8; 2001 Consent Order;\n\n2001 Plan; 2007 90-Day Consent Order.) Moreover, these provisions are arguably the most\n\ncritical and cover areas where defendants have been most deficient. Certainly, in recent years,\n\nhealth and safety have been the primary focus and concern of the Court, the Special Masters, the\n\nCourt Monitor and the parties. See Evans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 298-314 (factual findings in March\n\n2007 Liability Opinion regarding health and safety); (2007 90-Day Order (addressing two\n\ncritical goals: increasing the number of qualified providers and improving the health and safety\n\nof class members); 2009 Special Masters’ Report at 18-67 (findings and conclusions of law\n\nregarding health care, mental and behavioral health care, guardianship, safety and protection\n\nfrom harm); Court Monitor’s Report, June 11, 2009; and Court Monitor’s Report, Dec. 10,\n\n2009.)\n\n         For example, according to the 2001 Plan, the crux of plaintiffs’ right to be kept free from\n\nharm is addressed by six specific directives in the 1978 Consent Order and the 1983 Consent\n\nOrder. (2001 Plan at 27-28). These directives\n\n         require conducting timely and thorough investigations into serious incidents,\n         including deaths; identifying causes and contributory factors as well as preventive\n         and corrective actions that appear to be warranted; and ensuring the\n         implementation of recommendations that are made as a result of the\n\n                                                 55\n\f       investigations. In addition to responding to individual cases, the defendants are\n       required to identify systemic patterns and trends and communicate them to\n       providers to facilitate corrective action for recurrent problems on an individual\n       consumer level, provider level and a systemic level. . . . [and to] ensure that\n       appropriate training programs for all staff, including staff assigned to residential\n       settings are developed and implemented.\n\n(2009 Special Masters’ Report at 50.) In March 2007, this Court found “defendants ha[d] failed\n\nin many significant respects to accomplish the tasks and outcome criteria associated with the\n\nCourt’s Orders relating to class member safety and to comply with the terms of the Orders\n\nthemselves.” Evans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 313. In late November 2007, defendants conceded that\n\nas of yet, conditions had not fundamentally changed. (Def.’s Notice Concerning Proposed\n\nComprehensive Monitoring at 2.) And, as of December 2008, the Special Masters found that\n\n“there is clear and convincing evidence that the problems being experienced by class members in\n\nthe area of safety and protection from harm are continuing, serious and systemic.” (2009 Special\n\nMasters’ Report at 67). Thus, no matter how Youngberg is interpreted, it would not excuse\n\ndefendants from these obligations.\n\n       Moreover, even if defendants’ overly narrow interpretation of Youngberg were to be\n\nadopted, it would only entitle defendants to partial modification of the court orders concerning\n\nhabilitation. For example, as the 2007 Liability Opinion makes clear, the right to receive\n\nhabilitative care and treatment in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty, see Evans,\n\n480 F. Supp. 2d at 314-19, is only one aspect of plaintiffs’ right to habilitation/welfare.\n\nPlaintiffs are also entitled to “a written ISP based upon individualized assessments and\n\nformulated in accordance with professional standards”; “an individualized habilitation program\n\ndesigned in accordance with the ISP”; identification in the ISP of “all services and supports\n\nrequired by class members regardless of availability”; annual review of the ISP; “adaptive\n\n                                                  56\n\fequipment” if needed; “enough case manager positions to meet the required case manager to\n\nclient ratio”; “appropriate training programs for staff, including case managers”; and case\n\nmanagers who ensure implementation of ISPs and take appropriate action after incidents. See id\n\nat 319, 321-22; (see also 2009 Special Masters’ Report at 67-75 (same)). Similarly, in the six-\n\npage, single-spaced 2007 90-Day Consent Order (which defendants agreed to after the Fenty\n\nadministration took office), the only provision arguably affected by Youngberg would be the\n\nrequirement that defendants ensure that residences operated by new providers “are located close\n\nto shops, restaurants, community resources and public transportation, or there is transportation\n\navailable to class members in order to access these resources.” (2007 90-Day Consent Order at\n\n2.)\n\n       Finally, one of defendants’ primary points about Youngberg is that it rejects any right to\n\ncommunity placement, but the present record establishes that plaintiffs failed to prove that\n\ndefendants are in noncompliance with the 2001 Plan with respect to moving a significant number\n\nof class members into group homes. (See 2009 Special Masters’ Report at 72.)33 For those class\n\n\n       33\n            As described in the 2009 Special Masters’ Report:\n\n       The unchallenged testimony of defendants’ witness, Laura Nuss, is that there have\n       been 250 placements into less restrictive environments. Defendants have moved\n       a significant number of class members to apartments and group homes. The\n       evidence during the liability phase of this action was that 55% of class members\n       resided in ICFs/MR (366 of 659 class members, 480 F. Supp 2d at 315 n.43.)\n       That number is down to a little over 250 class members (approximately 40% of\n       the class), and defendants reasonably expect to accelerate that movement with the\n       further development of the community-based waiver and the Money Follows The\n       Person Grant, which is expected to further reduce the utilization of ICFs/MR by\n       60% (Nuss Trial Tr. 275:18-21). Based on these findings of fact, the Special\n       Masters find that plaintiffs have not sustained their burden of proving by clear\n       and convincing evidence non-compliance with court orders requiring residential\n       placements in less restrictive settings.\n\n                                                 57\n\fmembers who continue to reside in ICF/MR settings, the Report noted that “there was no\n\nevidence submitted to establish that continued placement of all or some subset of these class\n\nmembers in such settings was improper or contrary to a choice made by the class member or an\n\nauthorized surrogate decision-maker.” (Id. at 73.)\n\n        In the end, then, defendants’ argument that Youngberg changed the law on habilitation\n\nwould, at most, require partial modification of a limited number of court orders concerning\n\nhabilitation; it would not affect the legitimacy of any other order, including many critical orders,\n\nconcerning plaintiffs’ health, welfare and safety. But defendants do not seek such a limited\n\nmodification; rather they make an “all or nothing” argument for vacatur.34\n\n\n\n\n(Id. at 72.)\n        34\n          (See 12/17/2009 Tr. at 22 (“Your Honor, I do not think there is a middle ground.”); id at\n24 (“modification as to the plan would be something that would almost be a futile act”).) In\ndefendants’ brief, they state that if the Court rejects this option, “[i]n the alternative, the Court\nshould at the very least modify the orders currently in force, to eliminate any provisions that are\nnot reasonably necessary to remedy a current and ongoing constitutional violation.” (Defs.’\nMem. at 7.) However, if defendants want a modification, it is their burden to show the Court\nthat the modification is narrowly tailored to the change in circumstances. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383\n(“[A] party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the burden of establishing that a\nsignificant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree. If the moving party meets\nthis standard, the court should consider whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to\nthe changed circumstance.”). Defendants have made no effort to offer a modification suitably\ntailored to the arguably changed circumstances. (See 12/17/09 Tr. at 39 (“Your Honor, in all\ncandor, if you do not vacate the orders, we would have to look at them anew and see if any – if –\nwhat modifications could be made to them that are realistic.”)); see also See LaShawn v. Fenty,\nNo. 89-CV-1754, 2010 WL 1270202, at *21 (D.D.C. Apr. 5, 2010) (defendants similarly did not\n“propose[] a modification tailored to the alleged changed circumstances” leaving the court\nwithout “an adequate proposal to consider”). Moreover, they have steadfastly refused to invoke\nthe procedures provided for by the 2001 Plan (see 2001 Plan at 6-10) or under Rule 60(b)(5) for\nmodification or termination of orders that have been achieved or those that are no longer relevant\nor obtainable.\n\n                                                 58\n\fII.    DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO VACATUR BASED ON CHANGE IN\n       FACTS\n\n       A.      Defendants Are Not in Substantial Compliance with Constitutional\n               Requirements\n\n       Defendants argue that, even though they have not achieved compliance with the court\n\norders or the 2001 Plan, the objects of those orders have been attained because defendants have\n\nsatisfied the “constitutional minimum.” (Defs.’ Mem. at 32 (“District’s current system for\n\nserving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities . . . patently satisfies class\n\nmembers’ Fifth . . . Amendment rights to be free from harm and to receive minimally adequate\n\nhabilitative care and treatment.”).) Defendants’ argument fails because (1) it rests on a flawed\n\ndefinition of the constitutional minimum; and (2) its rests on an erroneous interpretation of\n\nHorne as allowing properly entered consent orders to be vacated, despite defendants’ non-\n\ncompliance with those orders, once defendants achieve the constitutional minimum.\n\n               1.      Defendants Cannot Provide a Workable Definition of Constitutional\n                       Requirements Based on Youngberg\n\n       Defendants’ argument that they have satisfied the “constitutional minimum” requires that\n\nthat concept be defined, but defendants’ proffered definition is fundamentally flawed.\n\nAccording to defendants, Youngberg establishes as the constitutional minimum that involuntarily\n\ncommitted individuals have only the right to be kept “free from harm” and the right to\n\n“minimally adequate habilitation,” defined as “such training as may be reasonable in light of [the\n\nindividual’s] liberty interests in safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints.” (Def. Mot. to\n\nVacate at 16 (quotations omitted) (quoting Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 322). Defendants then baldly\n\nassert that they have met this constitutional minimum because “[w]e’re exercising professional\n\njudgment in the care and treatment of consumers within the class. They’re free from harm. And\n\n                                                  59\n\fthey’re getting sufficient training and habilitation so that their liberty interests are protected.”\n\n(12/17/09 Tr. at 104.)\n\n        Although the constitutional minimum certainly includes the rights articulated in\n\nYoungberg, defendants’ argument that no more is required is premised on an error of law. First,\n\nas noted, Youngberg did not concern an involuntarily committed person’s constitutional right to\n\n“food, shelter, clothing, and medical care.” Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315. It is indisputable that\n\nany constitutional minimum standard must include protection of these rights.35 Moreover, as\n\nthese rights were not at issue in Youngberg, Youngberg provides no guidance as to what is\n\nrequired to meet the constitutional minimum with respect to the protection of these rights.\n\n        In addition, to the extent defendants contend that the constitutional minimum is met as\n\nlong as there is a system in place that calls for the exercise of professional judgment (see\n\n12/17/09 Tr. at 103;36 Defs.’ Mem. at 33 (“no credible argument can be made that there is a\n\nsystemic lack of professional judgment exercised by treating professionals in the IDD system”)),\n\n\n        35\n          When asked to explain what a minimal right to medical care encompasses, defense\ncounsel suggested that plaintiffs’ right to medical care was limited to the “health implications” of\nthe “very minimal” “duty to keep them safe and free from unreasonable restraints.” (12/17/09\nTr. at 100.) As an example of what might be covered, defense counsel suggested “if a person\nneeds certain treatment so that they can be free from unreasonable restraints, yes, that is part of\nwhat Youngberg dictates.” (Id.) Or, if a person has a tumor, there may be a some duty to act if\nthe person “may not be safe, depending on the invasiveness of the tumor.” (Id. at 101.) Not only\nis it incomprehensible that an involuntarily committed developmentally disabled person is not\nentitled to more than counsel’s meaningless and inadequate level of care, but counsel’s inability\nto provide any workable definition illustrates the inherent difficulty prescribing in the abstract\nwhat services are required so that a constitutionally protected right will be something more than\na hollow promise.\n        36\n         During oral argument, the Court asked defense counsel whether it mattered if “the\nhealthcare provider’s recommendations as to the class members are not implemented in a timely\nmanner,” to which counsel responded, “I don’t think Youngberg speaks to the timeliness of the\nmatter.” (12/17/09 Tr. at 103.)\n\n                                                  60\n\fthat proposition is not supported by Youngberg. Youngberg expressly states that a court must\n\n“make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised” in attempting to protect the\n\nrights of an involuntarily committed individual. 457 U.S. at 321 (emphasis added) (quotation\n\nomitted). As other courts have recognized, in order for this requirement to have any substance, it\n\ncannot be met purely at the systemic level; rather, professional judgments must be implemented\n\nin a timely fashion. See, e.g., Thomas S., 902 F.2d at 252 (holding that district court properly\n\nimposed liability because it “found that many of the decisions of the treating professionals had\n\nnot been implemented” and “found areas in which the decisions of the treating professional\n\nsubstantially departed from accepted standards”); Haldeman v. Pennhurst, 901 F.2d 311, 324 (3d\n\nCir. 1990) (“obligations [under the consent decree] clearly run to class members as individuals,\n\nnot as a group” and thus “substantial compliance must be measured with respect to the services\n\neach individual retarded class member is receiving and not with respect to the services received\n\nby the class as a whole”).\n\n       Finally, defendants again ignore, as discussed above, that Youngberg did not address the\n\nright to habilitation generally; it decided only that the plaintiff, who was profoundly retarded and\n\nwould not benefit from any other habilitation, was entitled to the limited habilitation he sought –\n\nsuch training as may be reasonable in light of his liberty interests in safety and freedom from\n\nunreasonable restraints. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 318 (because plaintiff “seeks only training\n\nrelated to safety and freedom from restraints, this case does not present the difficult question\n\nwhether a mentally retarded person, involuntarily committed to a state institution, has some\n\ngeneral constitutional right to training per se” (emphasis added)). For all these reasons, the\n\nrights recognized by Youngberg are necessary, but not sufficient, to give meaning to plaintiffs’\n\n\n                                                 61\n\fbasic constitutional rights.\n\n               2.      Even If Defendants Have Satisfied Minimum Constitutional\n                       Requirements, This Does Not Justify Vacatur Under Horne\n\n       The second problem for defendants is that they cannot seek vacatur of all court orders\n\nbased on Horne. In Horne, the district court concluded, after a trial, that the State of Arizona\n\nwas violating the requirement in the Equal Educational Opportunities Act (“EEOA”) “to take\n\nappropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students\n\nin its instructional programs,” 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f), because “the amount of funding the State\n\nallocated for the special needs of ELL students . . . was arbitrary and not related to the actual\n\nfunding needed to cover the costs of ELL instruction.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2589. Pursuant to\n\nthis judgment, the court ordered the State, inter alia, to “prepare a cost study to establish the\n\nproper appropriation to effectively implement ELL programs,” “to provide funding that bears a\n\nrational relationship to the actual funding needed,” and to “appropriately and constitutionally\n\nfund” the ELL program. Id. at 2590 (quotations and citations omitted).\n\n       The defendants never complied with any of the court’s orders, but in 2006 the State\n\nLegislature passed a new law that “increased ELL incremental funding [by a fixed amount] (with\n\na 2-year per-student limit on such funding) and created two new funds – a structured English\n\nimmersion fund and a compensatory instruction fund – to cover additional costs of ELL\n\nprogramming.” Id. at 2590. Based on this new legislation, the state legislature asked the district\n\ncourt to vacate its orders. The district court concluded that Rule 60(b)(5) relief was not\n\nwarranted because the new law “did not establish a funding system that rationally relates funding\n\navailable to the actual costs of all elements of ELL instruction.” Id. at 2591 (quotations\n\nomitted). The Ninth Circuit affirmed, emphasizing that because the original declaratory\n\n                                                 62\n\fjudgment order centered on the adequacy of ELL incremental funding, relief would be\n\nappropriate only if “there are no longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs in\n\nArizona,” or if “Arizona had altered its funding model.” Id. at 2591-92 (quotations omitted).\n\n       The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, holding that the lower courts had erred by\n\nlooking only to whether the State was fulfilling the specific terms of the judgment instead of\n\nconsidering whether “Arizona is now fulfilling its statutory obligation by new means that reflect\n\nnew policy insights and other changed circumstances.” Id. at 2589. The Court remanded the\n\ncase with instructions to consider “whether the objective of the District Court’s 2000 declaratory\n\njudgment order – i.e. satisfaction of the EEOA’s appropriate action standard – has been\n\nachieved.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2595 (quotations omitted).\n\n       Under Horne and earlier Supreme Court decisions, a motion to vacate, such as defendants\n\nhave filed here, requires the Court to determine whether the “objective” of the court orders has\n\nbeen attained. Id.; Frew, 540 U.S. at 442 (“The federal court must exercise its equitable powers\n\nto ensure that when the objects of the decree have been attained, responsibility for discharging\n\nthe State’s obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials.”); see also LaShawn,\n\n2010 WL 1270202, at *11 (in addressing motion to vacate consent decree, “it is appropriate to\n\nconsider whether the objectives of the decree have been achieved”).\n\n       Defendants attempt, nevertheless, to read Horne as a new rule of law that equates\n\nsatisfying the constitutional minimum with attaining the objective of a consent decree. (See\n\nDefs.’ Mem. at 18 (no ongoing constitutional violations because the “current IDD system\n\nadministered by DDS/DDA . . . not only satisfies but greatly surpasses the minimum\n\nconstitutional standards established by the Fifth Amendment.” ); 12/17/09 Tr. at 10-11, 13, 16,\n\n\n                                                 63\n\f42, 48.) This Court cannot accept this exceedingly broad interpretation of Horne, for Horne\n\ncannot mean that when a defendant agrees to a series of measures designed to remedy\n\nconstitutional violations, these agreements are necessarily unenforceable because the measures\n\nexceed some ill-defined constitutional floor.\n\n       Unlike Horne, the present case involves a consent decree, not a litigated judgment. A\n\nconsent decree “‘embodies an agreement of the parties’ and is also ‘an agreement that the parties\n\ndesire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to\n\nthe rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees.’” Frew, 540 U.S. at 437 (quoting\n\nRufo, 502 U.S. at 378). “[A] federal consent decree must spring from, and serve to resolve, a\n\ndispute within the court’s subject-matter jurisdiction; must come within the general scope of the\n\ncase made by the pleadings; and must further the objectives of the law upon which the complaint\n\nwas based.” Id. (citing Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 525). “Consent decrees entered in federal court\n\nmust be directed to protecting federal interests.” Id.; see also LaShawn, 2010 WL 1270202, at\n\n*13.\n\n       The decision in Horne was obviously motivated by the perceived dangers of long-term\n\njudicial involvement in local government institutions, noting that “Rule 60(b)(5) serves a\n\nparticularly important function in . . . ‘institutional reform litigation’” because “injunctions\n\nissued in such cases often remain in force for many years, and the passage of time frequently\n\nbrings about changed circumstances – changes . . . in governing law . . . and new policy insights\n\n– that warrant reexamination of the original judgment.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2593. The Court\n\nin Horne also noted that “institutional reform injunctions often raise sensitive federalism\n\nconcerns,” particularly where they “involve[] areas of core state responsibility” or “ha[ve] the\n\n\n                                                 64\n\feffect of dictating state or local budget priorities.” Id. at 2593-94. And in dicta it suggests that\n\nthese problems are exacerbated in cases governed by consent decrees rather than litigated\n\njudgments because consent decrees often “go well beyond what is required” by law, and\n\n“thereby ‘improperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and executive\n\npowers.’” Id. at 2594 (quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 441).\n\n       But in Horne, the Supreme Court also endorsed and cited its prior decisions in Rufo and\n\nFrew – decisions approving the use of consent decrees in institutional reform cases. See Horne,\n\n129 S. Ct. at 2593-95; see also Salazar v. District of Columbia, No. 93-452, 2010 WL 547834, at\n\n*3 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2010) (concluding that Horne “reaffirmed the vitality of [Rufo,] 502 U.S.\n\n367, 368 (1992), the leading case setting forth the standards for modifying a final judgment\n\nunder Rule 60(b)(5) in institutional reform cases.”); LaShawn, 2010 WL 1270202, at *8, *12-\n\n*13 (applying Rufo standards).37 If, as defendants argue, there is an inherent conflict between\n\nHorne and Rufo or Frew, the Supreme Court certainly did not acknowledge it. Thus, this Court\n\nis bound by those earlier decisions, and it will not adopt defendants’ attempt to use Horne to\n\nundermine their holdings. See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997) (“If a precedent of\n\nthis Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other\n\nline of decisions, the [lower court] should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this\n\nCourt the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.”).\n\n       Significantly for purposes of the present case, Rufo and Frew establish that a consent\n\ndecree may appropriately go beyond the bare bones of what a court could order without the local\n\n\n       37\n         As noted by Judge Hogan, 2010 WL 1270202, at *13, the D.C. Circuit in LaShawn\nupheld a decree even assuming that it “imposes requirements beyond those of District law.”\nLaShawn A. v. Barry, No. 94-7044, 1996 WL 679301, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 30, 1996).\n\n                                                 65\n\fgovernment’s consent.38 See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 389 (“But we have no doubt that, to ‘save\n\nthemselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of litigation,’ [the defendants] could settle the\n\ndispute over the proper remedy for the constitutional violations that had been found by\n\nundertaking to do more than the Constitution itself requires (almost any affirmative decree\n\nbeyond a directive to obey the Constitution necessarily does that), but also more than what a\n\ncourt would have ordered absent the settlement.” (citation omitted)); Frew, 540 U.S. at 437-38\n\n(rejecting argument that consent decree violates the Eleventh Amendment on the that “state\n\nofficials [may agree] to bind state governments to significantly more commitments than what\n\nfederal law requires”); see also Local No. 93, Int’l Ass’n of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, 478\n\nU.S. 501, 525 (1986) (consent decree may properly “provide[] broader relief than the court could\n\nhave awarded after a trial”). Indeed, that is one reason why consent decrees are a valuable tool\n\nfor resolving such cases. See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383 (noting that if plaintiffs enter into a consent\n\n\n       38\n          Even without consent, a court may impose a remedy that goes beyond ordering\ndefendants to satisfy the constitutional floor. Federal court decrees “exceed appropriate limits if\nthey are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate the Constitution or does not flow\nfrom such a violation,” Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282, but “where . . . a constitutional violation has\nbeen found, the remedy does not ‘exceed’ the violation if the remedy is tailored to cure the\ncondition that offends the Constitution.” Id. (quotation omitted). For example, in Milliken,\n“[t]he ‘condition’ offending the Constitution is Detroit’s de jure segregated school system, which\nwas so pervasively and persistently segregated that the District Court found that the need for the\neducational components flowed directly from constitutional violations by both state and local\nofficials. These specific educational remedies, although normally left to the discretion of the\nelected school board and professional educators, were deemed necessary to restore the victims of\ndiscriminatory conduct to the position they would have enjoyed in terms of education had these\nfour components been provided in a nondiscriminatory manner in a school system free from\npervasive de jure racial segregation.” Id.\n\n        Significantly, this same principle was adopted in Horne, where the Court recognized that\nfederal court decrees are not limited to the constitutional floor in awarding relief for a violation\nof law. Rather, federal court decrees do not “exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at\neliminating a condition that . . . flow[s] from such a violation.” See Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2495.\n\n                                                 66\n\fdecree “[a]t least they will avoid further litigation and perhaps will negotiate a decree providing\n\nmore than what would have been ordered without the local government’s consent”); Local No.\n\n93, 478 U.S. at 522 (“Consent decrees are entered into by parties to a case after careful\n\nnegotiation has produced agreement on their precise terms. The parties waive their right to\n\nlitigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable\n\nrisk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in\n\nexchange for the saving of cost and elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they\n\nmight have won had they proceeded with the litigation.” (quoting United States v. Armour &\n\nCo., 402 U.S. 673, 681 (1971)); see also LaShawn, 2010 WL 1270202, at *12-*13.\n\n       In addition, federal district courts retain the power to enforce consent decrees in\n\ninstitutional reform cases. A consent decree “‘embodies an agreement of the parties’ and is also\n\n‘an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a\n\njudicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees.’”\n\nSee Frew, 540 U.S. at 437 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 378.) “Federal courts are not reduced to\n\napproving consent decrees and hoping for compliance. Once entered, a consent decree may be\n\nenforced.” Id. at 440.39\n\n\n       39\n            As noted by the Supreme Court in Local No. 93:\n\n       Parties may choose to settle their disputes by consent decree rather than by\n       private contract for a number of reasons. As one commentator points out, [p]ublic\n       law settlements are often complicated documents designed to be carried out over\n       a period of years, . . . so any purely out-of-court settlement would suffer the\n       decisive handicap of not being subject to continuing oversight and interpretation\n       by the court. . . . A consent decree has several other advantages as a means of\n       settling litigation. It is easier to obtain enforcement of a consent decree because it\n       will be unnecessary to prove many facts that would otherwise have to be shown in\n       order to establish the validity of an ordinary contract. A court that maintains\n\n                                                67\n\f       Because Horne did not involve a consent decree, it had no occasion to address\n\ndefendants’ claim that all they have to do is satisfy the constitutional minimum as opposed to\n\nprovisions of a consent decree that arguably exceed the minimum but were agreed to by the\n\nparties to cure conditions that flow from constitutional violations. But this very claim was\n\naddressed and rejected in Rufo. There, the Supreme Court made clear that where there is a\n\nconsent decree in place, the legally enforceable obligations are “not confined to meeting minimal\n\nconstitutional requirements.” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 390. Moreover, “[a] proposed modification\n\nshould not strive to rewrite a consent decree so that it conforms to the constitutional floor,” Rufo,\n\n502 U.S. at 391, and a party cannot “require a court to retrace old legal ground, say, by\n\nre-making or rejustifying its original ‘constitutional decision every time an effort [is] made to\n\nenforce or modify’” an order. Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2619 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 389-390,\n\n392); see also LaShawn, 2010 WL 1270202, at *11-*13.\n\n       Despite this binding precedent, defendants cite to a number of cases decided since Horne\n\nwhere courts have vacated consent decrees. (See Defs.’ Reply at 6 & n.9; Defs.’ Notice of\n\nSupplemental Authority, Dec. 9, 2009; Defs.’ Notice of Supplemental Authority, Mar. 30, 2010).\n\nHowever, none of the cited cases is analogous to our case, for, in each of them, there were\n\ncompelling circumstances that supported the termination of the consent decree that are not\n\n\n\n\n       continuing jurisdiction over a consent decree will have a more flexible repertoire\n       of enforcement measures. And it is likely to be easier to channel litigation\n       concerning the validity and implications of a consent decree into a single\n       forum-the court that entered the decree-thus avoiding the waste of resources and\n       the risk of inconsistent or conflicting obligations. . . . For all of these reasons,\n       consent decrees have become widely used as devices to facilitate settlement.\n\n478 U.S. at 524 n.13 (quotations and citations omitted).\n\n                                                 68\n\fpresent here.\n\n       In three of the four cases, defendants were found to be in full compliance with the\n\nconsent decree. In United States v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago, 663 F. Supp. 2d\n\n649 (N.D. Ill. 2009), the district court terminated a consent decree that addressed segregation in\n\nthe Chicago school system based on its determination that defendants had complied in good faith\n\nwith the consent decree and court orders over a reasonable period of time, had eliminated all\n\nvestiges of segregation to the extent practicable, and had demonstrated its good faith\n\ncommitment to the constitutional rights that were the predicate for intervention. Id. at 654, 660-\n\n62. Similarly, in Consumer Advisory Board v. Harvey, No. 91-CV-321-P-S, 2010 WL 1037593\n\n(D. Me. Mar 19, 2010), defendants had “achieved substantial compliance” with the consent\n\ndecree by meeting the benchmarks set forth in the decree itself. Id. at *3.40 Finally, in Basel v.\n\nBielaczyz, No. 74-40135-BC, 2009 WL 2843906 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 1, 2009), the court vacated a\n\nconsent judgment that was entered to correct the substantial backlog of hearing requests before a\n\nstate agency after noting that “[i]n the years closely following entry of the consent judgment,\n\nthere is no suggestion on the docket or by the parties that Defendants were ever held in contempt\n\nbased on a failure to comply with the consent judgment. . . . The terms of the consent judgment\n\nand the history of apparent compliance suggest that the consent judgment served its purpose, and\n\nat some point, the need for the injunction passed .” Id. at *7.\n\n       In contrast, defendants here have a proven 30-year history of noncompliance. And, in\n\n\n       40\n         Notably, Clarence Sundram was the Special Master in Harvey, which had a similar\nfactual history to our case. One key difference, though, is that in his final report to the district\ncourt, Special Master Sundram concluded that the defendants were in compliance and the time\nwas ripe for a Rule 60(b)(5) motion to vacate the consent decree. See Final Report of the Special\nMaster, Harvey, 2009 WL 5792159, at *11-*12.\n\n                                                 69\n\ffact, based on the representations of defense counsel at oral argument, there is a serious question\n\nas to whether defendants are even trying to comply with these orders.41\n\n       The fourth post-Horne case cited by defendants is also inapposite. In Cleveland Fire\n\nFighters for Fair Hiring Practices v City of Cleveland, No. 1:00-CV-301, 2009 WL 2602366\n\n(N.D. Ohio Aug. 20, 2009), the district court denied a Rule 60(b)(5) motion to extend the term of\n\na consent decree that had been entered in 1975 to address discrimination in the hiring practices\n\nof the Cleveland Fire Department. Id. at *3, *16. The court declined to extend the decree\n\nbecause if found that (1) defendant City has “extended its best efforts to achieve the hiring\n\ngoals” in the decree; (2) all parties used their best efforts to produce dynamic change; (3)\n\n“changes relating to, among other things, this nation’s declining economy have taken place,\n\n\n       41\n            As explained by defense counsel:\n\n       MS. EFROS: I think what matters is, looking at it today, this is not something that\n       this administration embraces. It is not something that this administration\n       necessarily needs to embrace.\n\n       THE COURT: It does as long as the orders exist. I’m sorry to tell you that. You\n       may not like to embrace it happily, but there are Court orders out there.\n       MS. EFROS: That is the purpose of our motion today.\n       THE COURT: Sure.\n       MS. EFROS: If you deny our motion, then we’re left with an appeal or\n       conforming to the Court order. But the very purpose of our motion today is to say\n       that these orders should be vacated.\n       THE COURT: Yes. But until and unless they are, you are, I hope, agreeing they\n       bind you?\n       MS. EFROS: Until they are vacated, we are not consciously ignoring any Court\n       order.\n       THE COURT: Well, that’s not much of a consolation. All you are saying is you\n       are not intentionally committing contempt of Court.\n(12/17/09 Tr. at 20-21.)\n\n                                                70\n\fwhich could not have been anticipated at the time the [decree] was entered into” – and (4)\n\n“circumstances were . . .\n\nunforeseen and, hence, despite a good faith effort, the City has not satisfied the goals” in the\n\ndecree. Id. at *13-*14. The court therefore concluded that “[t]he evidence demonstrates that it\n\nwas not the City’s lack of effort, but rather circumstances beyond its control, that resulted in it\n\nfalling short of satisfying the goals in the [decree].” Id. at *16. Not only was Cleveland Fire\n\nFighters in a different procedural posture because movants were seeking to extend a decree past\n\nan already established termination date, but unlike Cleveland Fire Fighters, the record before the\n\nCourt does not support a finding that defendants have “extended [their] best efforts” to satisfy\n\nthe obligations in the consent orders or that there are “circumstances beyond its control” that\n\nhave caused it to fall short.42 To the contrary, defendants freely admit that they are determined to\n\nseek vacatur and not compliance.43\n\n\n       42\n          While defendants refer to the obligations imposed on the District as having become ever\nmore “exacting and onerous” (Defs.’ Mot. to Vacate at 2), it is unclear whether defendants argue\nthat any circumstance or obstacle makes the decree “unworkable” or “substantially more\nonerous.” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384; see also NLRB v. Harris Teeter Supermarkets, 215 F.3d 32, 36\n(D.C. Cir. 2000) (“Compliance over an extended period of time is not in and of itself sufficient\nto warrant relief. . . . [P]arties who have successfully sought modification have also established\nevents or changed circumstances which ‘make compliance with the decree substantially more\nonerous,’ make the decree ‘unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles,’ or make ‘enforcement\n[of the decree] detrimental to the public interest.’”). But of course, Rufo teaches that “[i]nternal\ncompliance mechanisms instituted to effectuate the decree . . . and hurdles inherent in a consent\ndecree’s entry do not count as ‘obstacles.’” Harris Teeter Supermarkets, 215 F.3d at 35-36\n(citing Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391). Moreover, other than a reference to the District’s financial\nsituation (see infra note 43), defendants, as in LaShawn, 2010 WL 1270202, at *14, provide no\nsubstance to their conclusory claim that the consent decrees and 2001 Plan should be viewed as\n“exacting and onerous.”\n       43\n         Defendants also argue in passing that the Court must take account of the District’s dire\neconomic climate and budget shortfall of $583.5 million. (Defs.’ Mem. at 54.) But defendants\ndo not complain about the costs of providing services to the class members, but rather they want\n\n                                                 71\n\f        Indeed, what the courts did in these cases is similar to the analysis courts engaged in\n\nbefore Horne, which was, in considering whether the objects of a consent decree had been met,\n\nto look to whether defendants had in good faith complied with the decree. For example, in\n\nBoard of Education v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237 (1991), the Supreme Court remanded with\n\ninstructions to the district court to decide “whether the [defendant] had complied in good faith\n\nwith the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past\n\n\n\n\nto be relieved of the costs associated with the Special Masters, the Court Monitor, the Quality\nTrust, and the attorneys’ fees incurred in litigating this case. (Id. at 55.) While “[f]inancial\nconstraints may not be used to justify the creation or perpetuation of constitutional violations, . .\n. they are a legitimate concern of government defendants in institutional reform litigation and\ntherefore are appropriately considered in tailoring a consent decree modification.” Rufo, 502\nU.S. at 592-93. However, in this case, as in LaShawn, 2010 WL 1270202, at *14, defendants\nhave failed to demonstrate that financial circumstances warrant modification.\n\n        Most importantly, the District’s lengthy history of intransigence and noncompliance have\nbeen the major factors in the increased need for monitoring, reliance on Special Masters, and the\nlarge costs and fees incurred by plaintiffs and their counsel. Second, the funding of the Quality\nTrust has almost been completed and is arguably not within the Court’s power to modify; the\nresponsibilities of the Special Masters have declined; and the Monitor returned over $180,000 of\nher budget in an effort to reduce costs. (12/17/09 Tr. at 115.) Third, this litigation has actually\nresulted in cost savings for the District, since as a result of the efforts of the Court, the plaintiffs,\nand the Special Masters, many class members and DDA customers have been put on the waiver,\nthereby shifting costs from the District to the federal government. (Id. at 27-28.) This effort,\nwhile now reaching fruition (see supra pp. 57-58), was started long before this administration\nand thus can hardly be credited only to the efforts of the current leadership. Fourth, as Judge\nHogan held, the costs of monitoring are not properly considered to be obstacles. LaShawn, 2010\nWL 1270202, at *14 (citing Agostini, 521 U.S. at 216 (holding that anticipated costs of\ncompliance with an injunctive order are not changed circumstances under Rufo)). Fifth,\ndefendants do not address the impact from the three-year multi-million dollar grant the District\nreceived from CMS in July 2008 via its “Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration\nProgram” (Defs.’ Mem. at 27) or the “Medicaid Infrastructure Grant,” that was “awarded to\nDHCF by CMS to improve the DDA’s day and vocational service system.” (Defs.’ Mem. re\nAlternate Remedy at 7.) Finally, if financial concerns are truly a problem, it is incumbent on the\nDistrict to propose a specific modification for addressing the shortfall, as opposed to advocating\nfor wholesale dismissal of the case so that the District can escape future court supervision and\nindependent monitoring.\n\n                                                   72\n\fdiscrimination had been eliminated to the extent practicable.” Id. at 249-50. Similarly, in\n\nLabor/Community Strategy Center v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation\n\nAuthority, 564 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 2009), the court affirmed the district court’s decision not to\n\nextend a consent decree addressing the day-to-day operations of the Los Angeles County bus\n\nsystem because “the evidence presented supported the district court’s finding that the\n\nimperfections with respect to load factor targets were de minimis in relation to the overall\n\nscheme of things.” Id. at 1123. And, in McDonald v. Bowersox, No. 89-1086 C(2), 1995 WL\n\n17013058 (E.D. Mo. Sep 18, 1995), aff’d, McDonald v. Carnahan, 109 F.3d 1319, 1321-22 (8th\n\nCir. 1997), the district court dissolved a consent decree regulating day-to-day life on death row,\n\ndescribing the critical question as whether “the underlying constitutional rights addressed\n\nthrough the decree are ensured through defendants’ compliance with the decree’s provisions in\n\ngood faith for a reasonable period of time.” Id. at *3.\n\n       In none of these cases is there support for defendants’ novel proposition that they can\n\nattain the objects of the consent orders without complying with their terms as long as they meet\n\nsome ill-defined “constitutional minimum.” See LaShawn, 2010 WL 1270202, at *20-*21;\n\nJohnson v. Sheldon, No. 8:87-CV-369, 2009 WL 3231226, at *7 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2009)\n\n(declining to vacate a consent decree despite defendant’s “substantial compliance” and\n\n“sweeping modifications and improvements to the community mental health system” where\n\ndecree specified exit criteria, which defendant had not yet fully satisfied); R.C. v. Walley, 475 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1118, 1123 (M.D. Ala. 2007) (“termination of consent decree is not appropriate unless\n\nthe decree’s purposes have been fully achieved”) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nNor does Horne support this proposition.\n\n\n                                                 73\n\f       Unlike Horne, this case involves a thirty-year series of consent orders whereby the\n\nDistrict committed itself to take certain actions to remedy the violations of plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional rights. These consent orders are what gives content to otherwise vague rights and\n\nsubstance to a remedy when those rights are violated.44 Moreover, as the Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized, consent decrees are a valuable tool for resolving litigation – with benefits to\n\nplaintiffs, defendants and the courts. But if the Court were to permit defendants to walk away\n\nfrom their obligations under the consent orders simply because there is a new administration that\n\nbelieves that all it needs to do is achieve the constitutional floor (whatever that means), that\n\nwould mean that there would be no future consent decrees involving governmental entities.\n\nPlaintiffs would have no incentive to enter into consent decrees if the next administration could\n\nattack a prior administration’s agreement by saying it promised more than was required. And,\n\ncourts would be unlikely to approve a consent decree if each new administration could force a\n\nretrial based on a claim that the constitutional floor has now been met. While Horne may have\n\nprovided parameters for court involvement in institutional reform litigation and consent decrees,\n\nit did not declare their demise. In light of the continued vitality of Rufo and Frew, and as long as\n\nthe obligations voluntarily assumed by defendants flow from constitutional violations, this Court\n\nmay not rewrite the existing consent orders so as to reduce defendants’ promise to some ill-\n\ndefined constitutional floor. See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391; LaShawn, 2010 WL 1270202, at *21.\n\nAccordingly, as defendants concede they are not in compliance with the court orders, they have\n\nnot satisfied Horne’s first requirement of showing that the object of the consent orders has been\n\n\n       44\n          (See Pls.’ Opp’n, Ex. 27 (charting flow of orders, starting with the rights recognized in\nthe 1978 Consent Order and then identifying the remedial actions defendants were ordered to\ntake to remedy the violations of those rights).)\n\n                                                 74\n\fattained.\n\n       B.      Defendants Have Not Yet Implemented a “Durable Remedy”\n\n       Nor have defendants satisfied Horne’s second requirement of showing that a “durable\n\nremedy” has been implemented. 129 S. Ct. at 2595. What it means to have a “durable remedy”\n\nis a question that Horne does not answer, but at a minimum, a “durable” remedy means a remedy\n\nthat gives the Court confidence that defendants will not resume their violations of plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional rights once judicial oversight ends. See LaShawn, 2010 WL 1270202, at *21;\n\nHarvey, 2009 WL 5792159, at *11 (suggesting that a “durable remedy” is the equivalent of\n\nhaving in place “a mechanism for future compliance”). Whether there is a durable remedy thus\n\nnecessarily depends on the actual impacts or outcomes experienced by the plaintiffs. The Court\n\nhas to be persuaded that defendants are no longer violating plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and\n\nthat they will “not return to [their] former ways.” Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247-48. As was the case\n\nin LaShawn, 2010 WL 1270202, at *22, defendants ask the Court to conclude that it has a\n\ndurable remedy in place because it has implemented permanent structural changes and will\n\nremain subject to extensive monitoring even without judicial involvement.\n\n               1.      Permanent Structural Changes\n\n       Defendants focus on the following permanent structural changes: (1) the establishment\n\nof the Department on Disability Services (“DDS”) as a cabinet-level department with\n\nindependent personnel and procurement authority;45 (2) the creation of the Department of Health\n\n\n       45\n          Defendants also refer to the fact that “the District has recruited high-quality and\ndedicated leadership for the new agency” (Defs.’ Mem. at 38), which is clearly an important\ndevelopment in this case given the often inadequate and transitory nature of management over\nthe last 30 years. However, as defense counsel conceded during argument, a “durable” remedy\ncannot depend on the retention of particular personnel. (12/17/09 Tr. at 29 (“I don’t think it does\n\n                                                75\n\fCare Finance (“DHCF”) as an independent, cabinet-level agency that functions as the single-\n\nstate Medicaid agency with two (to increase to four) staff dedicated to persons with\n\ndevelopmental disabilities; (3) increased interagency cooperation between DDS/DDA and\n\nDHCF, including routine weekly telephone calls, staff co-location and extensive collaboration on\n\na number of ongoing projects; (4) increased interagency collaboration between DDS/DDA and\n\nthe Health Regulation and Licensing Administration (“HRLA”), including sharing findings and\n\nconducting joint investigations; and (5) the establishment in July 2009 of a Task Force including\n\nrepresentatives from DDS/DDA, DHCF, and HRLA to advise the Mayor regarding all services\n\nfor individuals with developmental disabilities. (Defs.’ Mem. at 37-43.)\n\n       These structural changes are all extremely positive developments, but they do not\n\nnecessarily translate into proof of a durable remedy.46 All of the changes have occurred within\n\nthe past year or two, and, especially in view of the fact that this litigation has spanned over 30\n\nyears and still defendants achieved compliance, it is simply too soon to tell whether they will\n\nresult in improved outcomes for the plaintiffs, and, if so, whether the improvements will be\n\nsustained absent judicial involvement. Even defendants admit that systemic change can take\n\nthree to five years.47 (Defs.’ Mem.’ at 70; Defs.’ Mem., Ex. 16, Expert Report of Nancy Thaler,\n\n\ndepend on Ms. Nuss staying, although we certainly want Ms. Nuss to stay”).) Indeed,\ndefendants’ recent filing suggests that if the Court imposes the remedy recommended in the 2009\nSpecial Masters’ Report, Ms. Nuss will decline to remain in her job. (See Defs.’ Mem. re\nAlternate Remedy at 3-8.)\n       46\n         Similar arguments were raised by the District and rejected by LaShawn, 2010 WL\n1270202, at *13-*14 and by the D.C. Circuit in Harris Teeter, 215 F.3d at 36, where the Court\nrefused to terminate a consent decree even though defendant had instituted personnel changes\nand an internal reorganization.\n       47\n            Even in their latest filing, defendants acknowledges that there are\n\n\n                                                   76\n\fJuly 14, 2008 (“In no state have problems been solved over night. The full transformation of a\n\nsystem – the building of structure and processes and the appointment of strong leaders to manage\n\nthe way it all works together – takes several years. Three to five years is the standard time frame\n\nassumed to be necessary to turn a system around. Progress, that is evidence of the effort to\n\nchange things, becomes evident only over time.”); see also 12/11/08 Trial Tr. at 353 (Test. of\n\nLaura Nuss) (“you don’t see the outcomes that you want to see as fast as you would like to see\n\nthem. You know, this is a historically plagued service system. So I think it is taking time to see\n\nthe outcomes. But, you know, we still see the bad outcomes for individual issues. But we’re also\n\nseeing a lot of positive ones”).\n\n       Moreover, with respect to interagency coordination and collaboration, there have been\n\nimprovements, but the District’s performance has been less than consistent given the problems in\n\nthis area as recently as December 2008. (See 2009 Special Masters’ Report at 129 (“Time has\n\nshown that the problems with interagency coordination persist under the Fenty Administration as\n\nthey had under the previous administration, and have resulted in the same sub-standard\n\nconditions, lack of necessary medical care, as well as inappropriate and ineffective day\n\nprograms.”).) For example, defendants’ expert, Nancy Thaler, concluded that it was a failure in\n\ninteragency communication that caused “[t]he recent decision made by MAA to change the\n\n\n\n       remaining systemic weaknesses specific to the District’s IDD system: access to\n       high-quality behavioral health services; clinical services, including physical\n       therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), speech therapy (SPL), and nutrition\n       services; and transformation of the legacy facility-based day services to\n       person-centered habilitation and vocational-preparation programs that provide\n       quality habilitative, vocational and community-integrated services appropriate to\n       each consumer’s needs and preferences.\n\n(Defs.’ Mem. re Alternate Remedy at 11-12.)\n\n                                                77\n\fMedical Assistance transportation arrangements [to have] a negative impact on the consumers in\n\nthe DDA program by limiting their capacity to travel to medical and other appointments.”\n\n(Defs.’ Mem., Ex. 16, Addendum to Expert Report of Nancy Thaler at 11-12, Oct. 7, 2008.)\n\nSimilarly, as of December 2008, there continued to be problems with obtaining guardianships in\n\na timely fashion. (2009 Special Masters’ Report at 45, 49 (“The delays in obtaining\n\nguardianship for the provision of informed consent for medical and dental treatment of class\n\nmembers . . . have continued in the compliance period,” leading to defendants continued inability\n\n“to provide class members with medical treatment and health care that is timely, particularly for\n\nclass members who have acute medical needs.”).)\n\n                 2.     Monitoring\n\n       The second part of defendants’ durable remedy argument is their claim that their\n\nperformance is subject to extensive monitoring, including monitoring by the Superior Court, the\n\nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the Quality Trust, and the District’s\n\ninternal monitoring by the Health Regulation and Licensing Administration (“HRLA”) and the\n\nfour units of DDA’s Quality Management Division – Health and Wellness, Quality Enhancement\n\nand Quality Improvement, Incident Management and Enforcement, and Mortality Review.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a number of problems with defendants’ contention that this monitoring\n\nis proof of a durable remedy.\n\n                 i. Superior Court – As described by defendants, the Superior Court for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia plays a significant role in overseeing plaintiffs.48 However, the Superior\n\n\n       48\n            According to defendants,\n\n       any person brought before the Court (to be admitted or committed to DDS/DDA)\n\n                                                78\n\fCourt’s authority is limited to treatment decisions about individual class members, and although\n\nthis system has been in place since 1979,49 significant systemic reforms have not been achieved.\n\nMoreover, proposed legislation may signification alter the role of the Superior Court. See D.C.\n\nCouncil, B18-0501, Developmental Disabilities Reform Act of 2009 (introduced Oct. 20, 2009).\n\nThus, although Superior Court reviews individual cases and does play an important role, its job\n\nis limited and in light of the pending legislation, the Court can hardly count on its continued\n\ninvolvement.\n\n               ii. CMS – According to defendants, CMS, the federal agency that administers the\n\nMedicare and Medicaid programs, “already provides extensive oversight for services provided\n\nby DDS/DDA.” (Defs.’ Mem. at 44.) For example, the District must submit an annual report to\n\nCMS that addresses both fiscal and quality performance measures, and CMS conducts\n\n“unannounced random audits on various areas of its six assurances, including level of care,\n\nservice plan, qualified providers, health and welfare, administrative oversight, and financial\n\naccountability.” (Id. (citing Nuss. Decl. ¶ 4, Oct. 7, 2009) (Ex. 4 to Defs.’ Mem.).) In addition,\n\n\n\n       has a right to be represented by retained or appointed counsel. See SCR-MRP 11;\n       see also D.C OFFICIAL CODE § 7-1304.12(2) (authorizing fees to be a paid to\n       appointed counsel). Moreover, any interested party has the right to initiate an\n       action in Superior Court to compel DDS to accord persons with IDD the rights\n       afforded them under District law. D.C OFFICIAL CODE § 7-1305.13(a).\n       Indeed, each person committed to DDS/DDA supervision is entitled to an annual\n       judicial hearing to determine whether the person has “benefitted from . . .\n       habilitation.” Id. at § 1304.11(a)(1). These procedures conclusively demonstrate\n       that members of the Evans class have an adequate remedy at law for any potential\n       future failure by the District to provide them with appropriate treatment.\n\n(Defs.’ Mem. at 43-44.)\n       49\n         See The Mentally Retarded Citizens Constitutional Rights and Dignity Act of 1978,\neffective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-137; D.C. Official Code § 7-1301.02 33 et seq.).\n\n                                                79\n\faccording to defendants, “CMS will be initiating expanded . . . quality-reporting in the next\n\nfiscal year that mirrors the expanded quality management requirements now found in the HCBS\n\nwaiver program.” (Id.) Finally, defendants assert that:\n\n       From February 2007 to March 2009, CMS engaged in even more intensive\n       monitoring to ensure the then-MAA and DDS/DDA’s compliance with the federal\n       HCBS waiver requirements. This included monthly written and telephonic\n       monitoring of a corrective action plan in three of the six assurances: Plan of Care;\n       Health and Welfare; and Administrative Oversight. In March 2009, however,\n       CMS determined that the District had “made major changes in the performance,\n       structure, oversight mechanism, and systems sufficient enough to engage in\n       continuous Quality Improvement (QI).” To qualify for such a finding, a state\n       must demonstrate a robust system of “discovery, remediation and improvement”\n       in all six assurances. Citing the “demonstrated effectiveness of the many newly\n       implemented systems to meet the CMS quality requirements,” CMS discontinued\n       its intensified monitoring.\n\n(Defs.’ Mem. at 45 (quoting and citing CMS Letter, March 9, 2009 (Ex. 19 to Defs.’ Mem.).)50\n\nPlaintiff responds that the CMS monitoring “is irrelevant . . . [because] CMS monitors all states\n\nthat participate in the federal Medicaid program. All such states are required to file the type of\n\nannual reports that the defendants reference.” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 82.) But more importantly, CMS\n\ndoes not perform regular on-site audits to determine the quality of care provided to class\n\nmembers and other DDA consumers. According to the DOJ counsel who represents plaintiff-\n\nintervenors, the District conducts the on-site reviews of community placements and the regional\n\noffice of CMS, “as part of their quality review that occurs every five years, . . . requests evidence\n\nfrom the District that it is meeting all the statutory and regulatory assurances required for CMS.”\n\n(12/18/09 Tr. at 195.) Given CMS’ limited role in conducting on-site visits so that it can assess\n\n\n       50\n          Of course, prior to CMS issuing its Letter of March 9, 2009, the District had been put\non a “corrective action plan” – a program of intensified monitoring – due to the fact that the\nDistrict failed to substantially meet three of the six waiver assurances. (Defs. Mem., Ex. 19; see\nalso Court Monitor Rep. at 27, Jan. 26, 2007.)\n\n                                                 80\n\fthe impact of the systems on class members, the Court can take little solace from the increased\n\nrole of CMS, which is a recent development that will not begin until sometime this year and will\n\nbe a far cry from the type of monitoring that has any direct impact on the day-to-day lives of the\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n               iii. Quality Trust – As part of the 2001 Plan and as part of the settlement of the\n\nEvans litigation, the Quality Trust was established in 2001 as an quasi-independent entity tasked\n\nwith providing “monitoring, legal services and lay advocacy services for consumers in the\n\nDistrict of Columbia.” (2001 Plan at 45 (footnote omitted).) As part of its function, the Quality\n\nTrust was to monitor services being provided to the over 1400 non-class members and would\n\neventually take over from the Court Monitor the job of monitoring the Evans class members.\n\n(Id. at 46; see also supra pp. 13-15.) Specifically, the Quality Trust is tasked with developing\n\nand implementing an annual monitoring plan with input from all stakeholders; reviewing all\n\nreports and investigations of serious incidents involving DDS consumers; issuing annual reports;\n\nand reviewing and providing input regarding DDS budgeting information. (2001 Plan at 47-48.)\n\nHowever, although defendants point to the Quality Trust as an important monitoring component,\n\nthe Quality Trust has informed the Court in its most recent filing that the “proposal to transition\n\nthe monitoring function solely to Quality Trust is premature.” (Quality Trust Opp’n at 21; see\n\nalso id. at 27 (“When adequate structures are in place, and an opportunity for meaningful\n\ntransition from the Court Monitor has occurred, Quality Trust will be able to assume\n\npost-litigation monitoring of the Evans class members along with its current monitoring\n\nfunction.”).) The Quality Trust estimates that it will take 12-18 months “to have a meaningful\n\ntransition.” (12/17/09 Tr. at 140.) Given this assessment, the Court cannot yet look to the\n\n\n                                                 81\n\fQuality Trust to support defendants’ durable remedy argument.51\n\n                iv. Internal DDS Quality Assurance System – According to defendants,\n\n“internal monitoring methods will ensure that it sustains the extensive reforms now in place.”\n\n(Defs.’ Mem. at 48). Within the Developmental Disabilities Administration, the Quality\n\nManagement Division (“QMD”) “monitors all aspects of the service-delivery system to ensure\n\ncompliance with federal and local law, national best practices, and applicable court orders.” (Id.\n\n(quoting 10/7/09 Nuss Decl. ¶ 51).) The QMD is divided into four functional units: Health and\n\nWellness, Quality Enhancement and Quality Improvement (“QE/QI”), Incident Management and\n\nEnforcement (“IMEU”), and Mortality Review. (Defs.’ Mem. at 48-50 (quoting 10/7/09 Nuss\n\nDecl. ¶ 52).)\n\n       While improvements in internal monitoring are critical to the existence of a durable\n\nremedy, over the lengthy history of this case, defendants’ monitoring has been woefully\n\ninadequate both in terms of the quality and speed of internal investigations of both deaths and\n\nserious incidents involving class members and DDA consumers. This problem has continued\n\nthrough 2009. (See, e.g., Quarterly Report of the Court Monitor at 7, December 10, 2009;\n\nQuality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities Monitoring Unit Annual Report and Data\n\nSummary at 1, Oct. 1, 2008 – Sept. 30, 2009 (concluding that “progress in improving the\n\nsystems and supports for people with developmental disabilities in the District of Columbia is\n\n\n       51\n         The District’s proposed alternate remedy, set forth in a motion filed just days ago (see\nsupra note 2), the Quality Trust’s responsibility for on-the-ground monitoring appears to have\nshrunk and it is now described as an “active[] members of oversight committees that review\nfindings generated by these systems and initiatives and contribute to recommendations for\nimprovements going forward.” (Defs.’ Mem. re Alternate Remedy at 13.) Obviously, if its\nremedy were to be adopted, the Quality Trust’s role (despite the District’s obligation to fund it\nwith over $30 million) would be reduced to “ad hoc monitoring.” (Id., Ex. A at 7.)\n\n                                                82\n\fmixed. . . . A more consistent and transparent process for investigating Serious Reportable\n\nIncidents at DA is also necessary . . . . Our data indicates that investigation reports are not being\n\ncompleted consistent with policy.)\n\n       The flaws in the District’s internal monitoring also became apparent recently when the\n\nDistrict had to put into receivership one of its largest providers, Individual Development, Inc.\n\n(“IDI”). While the District touts this action as an example of “[t]he new institutional culture and\n\ncollaborative ethos” of officials from DDA, DHCF, and HRLA (Defs.’ Mem. re Alternate\n\nRemedy at 5), what it conveniently fails to disclose is that many of the problems with this\n\nprovider that led to the receivership were uncovered by the Court Monitor and reported by the\n\nCourt Monitor and the plaintiffs, not by the District’s internal monitoring apparatus. (See\n\n12/18/09 Tr. at 239.)\n\n       In sum, defendants have not demonstrated a durable remedy as required by Horne.\n\nWhile it is true that the District has made significant strides in the last year or two under new\n\nleadership, the Court does not have confidence that the agency’s progress is durable and self-\n\nsustaining. Accord LaShawn, 2010 WL 1270202, at *21-*22. As documented by the 2009\n\nSpecial Masters’ Report, the three most recent Court Monitor Reports and the 2009 Quality\n\nTrust’s Monitoring Unit Annual Report and Data Summary, results are, at best, uneven, and it is\n\nfar too soon to determine whether the structural changes, some of which are still in the\n\nimplementation phase, will have the desired impacts on the safety, health and welfare of the class\n\nmembers.\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n       In 1978, the parties agreed, and the Court endorsed that agreement in an Order and\n\nJudgment, that plaintiffs had certain constitutional rights, that those rights had been violated, and\n\n\n                                                 83\n\fthat to remedy those violations, defendants would have to take certain remedial actions. More\n\nthan 30 years later, defendants ask the Court to relieve them of those obligations under Rule\n\n60(b)(5) on the grounds that enforcing those promises prospectively is no longer equitable.\n\nWhile defendants certainly have the right to file a 60(b)(5) motion, they have the burden to\n\njustify their motion. Defendants have failed: the objectives of the original consent decree and\n\nsubsequent court orders, as incorporated in the 2001 Plan, have not been achieved and\n\ndefendants have not demonstrated that the prospective enforcement of the court orders would be\n\ninequitable or “detrimental to the public interest.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2593. Accordingly,\n\ndefendants’ motion for vacatur and dismissal will be DENIED.\n\n\n\n                                                        /s/\n                                             ELLEN SEGAL HUVELLE\n                                             United States District Judge\n\nDate: April 7, 2010.\n\n\n\n\n                                                84\n\f",

In 1978, the Court entered a\n\nconsent decree pursuant to which defendants agreed that plaintiffs’ constitutional rights had been\n\nviolated and that they would take certain actions to remedy those violations.1 A series of consent\n\norders and remedial plans followed in which defendants admitted that they were still violating\n\nclass members’ constitutional rights and agreed to take additional actions to remedy those\n\nconstitutional violations. The last such consent order and remedial plan was entered into in\n\n\n       1\n        Plaintiffs are a class of former residents of Forest Haven. As of December 2009, there\nwere 600 class members (see Court Monitor Report at 2, Dec. 10, 2009); the original class has\ndecreased due to the deaths of class members. The sole remaining defendants are the District of\nColumbia (“the District”) and the Mayor Adrian Fenty (collectively “the District” or\n“defendants”). The United States is also a party, having been permitted to intervene as a plaintiff\nin January 1977.\n\f2001, when the parties jointly agreed to a Plan for Compliance, pursuant to which defendants\n\ncould demonstrate compliance with the Court’s orders and terminate the litigation.\n\n        In 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion to find defendants in noncompliance and to appoint a\n\nreceiver. On March 30, 2007, the Court granted that motion in part, concluding, based on\n\nextensive factual findings, that there had been “systemic, continuous, and serious noncompliance\n\nwith many of the Court’s Orders.” Evans v. Fenty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2487220\"><a href=\"/opinion/2487220/evans-v-fenty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 325 (D.D.C. 2007)\n\n(“March 2007 Liability Opinion”). With respect to remedy, the Court asked the Special Masters\n\nto assist by making findings and recommendations to the Court that address, inter alia, “the\n\ncurrent status of defendants’ compliance, what are the available options for curing the identified\n\ndeficiencies, and whether a receivership is the most effective and efficient remedy available to\n\nthe Court.” Id. at 326.\n\n       Now before the Court is the Special Masters’ Report and Recommendation, which\n\nconcludes that, as of December 2008, defendants were still in noncompliance with the Court’s\n\norders and recommends the appointment of an “Independent Compliance Administrator” to bring\n\ndefendants into compliance and to end to this litigation. (Special Masters’ Report and\n\nRecommendation Regarding A Remedy For Defendants’ Noncompliance With Court Orders at\n\n128, Aug. 14, 2009 [“2009 Special Masters’ Report”].) Defendants have filed limited objections\n\nto the report and oppose the imposition of the proposed remedy;2 plaintiffs have no objections to\n\n\n       2\n        However, on March 29, 2010 – only a matter of days before the issuance of this\nMemorandum Opinion – defendants, having rebuffed all recent efforts to settle this matter and\nhaving resisted offering any alternatives to the Special Masters’ proposed remedies unless the\nremedy promised the swift cessation of Court supervision, filed a proposed alternate remedy for\nending this litigation. (See Defs.’ Mot. for Consideration of Alternative to Appointment of\nIndependent Compliance Administrator and for Entry of Exit Plan, March 29, 2010 [“Defs.’\nMot. for Alternate Remedy”].) Obviously, there has been insufficient time for plaintiffs to\n\n                                                 2\n\fthe report and ask that the Court adopt the findings of the Special Masters and their\n\nrecommended remedy. Also before the Court is a motion the District filed, after the Special\n\nMasters concluded their proceedings in January 2009, to vacate all consent orders and to dismiss\n\nthe entire case. For the reasons stated herein, defendants’ motion to vacate and dismiss will be\n\ndenied. The Court will address, in a future memorandum opinion and order, defendants’\n\nobjections to the Special Masters’ Report and Recommendations.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n       The lengthy procedural history of this litigation prior to March 30, 2007, will not be\n\nrepeated here, as it was fully summarized in the Memorandum Opinion filed on that date. See\n\nEvans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 281. Certain events, however, are relevant to defendants’ pending\n\nmotions and will be briefly noted below, followed by a more detailed summary of the facts and\n\nprocedural history that post-date that decision.3\n\nI.     KEY EVENTS PRIOR TO THE MARCH 30, 2007 LIABILITY OPINION\n\n       A.      1978 Final Judgment and Order\n\n       On June 14, 1978, the Court4 entered a “Final Judgment and Order” providing for\n\npermanent injunctive relief. Evans v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1392659\"><a href=\"/opinion/1392659/evans-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Pratt presided over this case from its inception until his death in\nAugust 1995.\n\n                                                    3\n\fConsent Order”). The 1978 Consent Order was premised on the recognition, which was\n\nconsented to by the parties, that plaintiffs had federal constitutional rights under the due process\n\nclause of the Fifth Amendment “to be kept free from harm” and “to receive habilitative care and\n\ntreatment in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty” and that “violations of [those]\n\nfederal constitutional rights . . . have occurred.” Id. at 484. To remedy those violations, the\n\n1978 Consent Order required defendants and their successors to take a number of specific\n\nactions, see id. at 484-90, that, loosely classified, fell into three categories: health care, safety,\n\nand welfare/habilitation. Defendants “consented to the entry of [the 1978 Consent Order] so as\n\nto assure protection of the rights of plaintiffs.” Id. at 484.\n\n        B.      1981 Consent Order\n\n        In 1981, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor filed motions for contempt, based on\n\ndefendants’ noncompliance with the 1978 Consent Order. Those motions led to the entry of a\n\nsecond Consent Order, which supplemented defendants’ obligations under the 1978 Consent\n\nOrder with a list of agreed-upon “measures necessary to the implementation of this Court’s\n\nOrder of June 14, 1978.” (Consent Order at 1, June 25, 1981 [“1981 Consent Order”].) The\n\n1981 Consent Order did not revisit the legal conclusions of the 1978 Consent Order nor did it\n\n“release defendants from their obligations” thereunder. (Id. at 10.) Rather, the parties came to\n\nan agreement that defendants needed to take additional measures to assure protection of\n\nplaintiffs’ constitutional rights. The agreed-upon measures supplemented defendants’\n\nobligations in each area addressed by the 1978 Consent Order – health, safety and\n\nwelfare/habilitation. (Id. at 1-10.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                    </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>\n\f       <span class=\"reporter\">Cow.</span>      <span class=\"page\">1982</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Supreme Court Decision (Youngberg v.

As discussed infra, defendants’ motion\n\nto vacate is based in part on the Youngberg decision and defendants’ contention, made for the\n\nfirst time in the 28 years since Youngberg was decided, that Youngberg changed the law and\n\nestablished that the 1978 Consent Order rested on “extraconstitutional” rights.\n\n       D.      1983 Consent Order\n\n       In 1982, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor again filed motions for contempt, which led to\n\nthe entry of a third Consent Order. (Consent Order, Feb. 8, 1983 [“1983 Consent Order”]). The\n\n1983 Consent Order similarly did not revisit the legal conclusions of the 1978 Consent Order nor\n\ndid it release defendants from their obligations under prior orders; it merely added to those\n\nobligations “to assist in the implementation of those orders.” (Id. at 14-15.) Again, the agreed-\n\nupon measures supplemented defendants’ obligations in each area addressed by the 1978\n\nConsent Order – health, safety and welfare/habilitation. (Id. at 2-14.)\n\n       E.      1990 Contempt Order\n\n       In 1989, plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor again filed motions for contempt. In 1990, the\n\nCourt issued an Order holding the District in civil contempt based on its “consistent and\n\ncontinuing violation of the three Consent Orders [of 1978, 1981 and 1983].” Evans, 480 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 284 (quoting Order, Jan. 30, 1990 [“Jan. 1990 Contempt Order”].) After a sanctions\n\nhearing, the Court issued an Order that, inter alia, required defendants to complete the\n\noutplacement of the 233 plaintiffs remaining at Forest Haven by September 30, 1991. Id. (citing\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fOrder, Apr. 9, 1990 [“Apr. 1990 Contempt Order”]). By October 1991, all plaintiffs had been\n\nmoved from Forest Haven and the institution was closed.\n\n        F.     1995 Contempt Order, Appointment of Special Master, 1996 Remedial Plan\n\n        In 1995, four years after the closure of Forest Haven, plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor\n\nfiled motions for contempt, for remedial sanctions and for appointment of a Special Master.\n\nAfter two hearings, the Court again found the District to be in contempt based on “clear and\n\nconvincing evidence, including defendants’ conceded violations, that the District is not in\n\ncompliance with the consent orders in this case . . . .” (Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law\n\nat 7, Oct. 11, 1995 [“1995 Contempt Order”].) In its decision, the Court5 observed that as of\n\n1995, it had “entered numerous orders, including consent orders between the parties, to\n\nsafeguard the rights of class members and ensure their adequate and appropriate habilitation.”\n\n(Id. at 1.) The Court further noted that “[d]efendants admit that the District has a continuing\n\nresponsibility to provide the class members with habilitation in accordance with their needs” and\n\n“admit that they also are required to provide adequate medical care, psychological care, day\n\nprogramming, community residential placements and other support systems as set forth in the\n\nclass members’ [individual habilitation plans].” (Id. at 5-6 (emphasis added).) The Court\n\nproceeded to find the District in contempt because it (1) was delinquent in ensuring timely\n\npayment of providers, in violation of the 1983 Consent Order; (2) permitted inadequate case\n\nmanager ratios, in violation of the 1983 Consent Order; and (3) offered inadequate “community\n\nliving arrangements” and “community-based day programs and services as are necessary to\n\n\n\n        5\n         The case was reassigned to the Honorable Stanley S. Harris upon Judge Pratt’s death in\n1995.\n\n                                                  6\n\fprovide them with minimally adequate habilitation,” in violation of the 1978 Consent Order. (Id.\n\nat 7-8.)\n\n           The Court further found that defendants’ “history of noncompliance, compounded by the\n\ncomplicated and factually elusive nature of the matters under consideration,” required the\n\nappointment of a “Special Master” pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53 to “evaluate\n\nand ensure defendants’ compliance with the Court’s Orders and Consent Decrees . . . and to\n\nrecommend remedies for any deficiencies in defendants’ compliance with the Orders.” (Order of\n\nReference at 2, Oct. 11, 1995 [“1995 Reference Order”].)6\n\n           In August 1996, the Court, based on a Report and Recommendation from the Special\n\nMaster, adopted a “Remedial Plan,” designed “to enable defendants to come into compliance\n\nwith the terms of this Court’s multiple Consent Orders” and to establish the conditions by which\n\ndefendants could purge their civil contempt. Evans v. Barry, No. 76-CV-293, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">451054</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\nat *1-*2 (D.D.C. Aug. 2, 1996) (“1996 Order & Remedial Plan”). In adopting the Remedial\n\nPlan, the Court observed that\n\n           [d]efendants have, for over two years, chronically and unapologetically violated\n           the terms of nearly every aspect of this Court’s multiple Consent Orders.\n           Defendants’ unrelenting contempt of this Court’s orders, and their seeming\n           inability to bring themselves in compliance therewith, have created chaos for the\n           care providers vested with day-to-day responsibility for the members of this\n           plaintiff class. The plaintiffs comprising this class, as defendants well know, are\n           ill-equipped to adjust to or defend against the city’s failure to assist their care\n           providers in giving them the care and treatment they desperately need.\n\nId. at *2.

(Order Regarding the Appointment of an\n\nIndependent Court Monitor, Nov. 21, 2000.) The Order specified that the duties of the Court\n\nMonitor were to include observing, monitoring, reporting findings, and making\n\nrecommendations to the parties, the Special Master, and the Court regarding implementation of\n\nthe Court’s Orders, and to submit quarterly reports on defendants’ “compliance” with the Court’s\n\nOrders. (Id. at 2-5.) The Order also provided that the “findings, recommendations and reports of\n\nthe Court Monitor . . . may be introduced as evidence when relevant and admissible in\n\naccordance with the Federal Rules of Evidence.” (Id. at 5.) In order to perform these duties, the\n\nMonitor was granted broad access “to the persons, residences, facilities, buildings, programs,\n\nservices, documents, records, personnel and materials the Monitor deems necessary or\n\nappropriate in performing [her duties].” (Id. at 4.)8\n\n       I.      2001 Opinion and Order: Joint Stipulated Findings of Fact; Plan for\n               Compliance; Consent Order and Settlement Agreement\n\n       In 2001, after “lengthy negotiations” – almost two years of work by the Special Master,\n\nthe parties, and an expert to the Special Master – the parties came to a series of agreements that\n\n“set forth a careful and detailed blueprint for achieving compliance with the Court’s Orders, for\n\nthe development of permanent and independent mechanisms to safeguard the rights of class\n\nmembers, and for the phased withdrawal of judicial oversight of the District of Columbia’s\n\nmental retardation system as compliance with the Court Orders [wa]s achieved.” Evans v.\n\n\n       8\n        On January 19, 2001, Dr. Jane Haddad was appointed as the first Independent Court\nMonitor.

Upon consideration of\n\nthese agreements, the Court, on March 30, 2001, (1) adopted the Parties’ Joint Stipulated\n\nFindings of Fact, id. at 96-107;9 (2) approved the 2001 Plan for Compliance and Conclusion of\n\nEvans v. Williams, id. at 85 (“2001 Plan”);10 and (3) entered a Consent Order, with a Settlement\n\nAgreement attached thereto. Id. at 85-96. Two aspects of these agreements remain critically\n\nimportant today: the 2001 Plan to achieve compliance and the creation of the Quality Trust in\n\nexchange for plaintiffs’ waiver of claims on noncompliance.\n\n               1.     2001 Compliance Plan\n\n       The 2001 Plan started from the premise “that there is already in place a declaratory\n\njudgment and permanent injunction recognizing a federal constitutional right to receive\n\n\n       9\n        As previously described by the Court, the joint stipulated findings of fact:\n\n       painted a bleak picture as to defendants’ record of noncompliance. The findings\n       acknowledged that there had been a “serious breakdown” in the District’s system\n       of support for individuals with developmental disabilities and that the system,\n       which had suffered from years of neglect and mismanagement, “urgently need[ed]\n       to be fixed.” Evans, 139 F. Supp. 2d at 96-97; see also, e.g., id. at 98 (noting that\n       District’s mental retardation and developmental delivery system was “broken”\n       and needed to be “redefined and rebuilt”). The findings noted that defendants’\n       compliance with the prior Court Orders had deteriorated following the closure of\n       Forest Haven in 1991 and that defendants were not complying with many of the\n       requirements of those Orders. Id. at 98. The findings also identified numerous\n       “fundamental problems,” including problems with respect to staffing, staff\n       training, and monitoring; management; reporting of and response to unusual\n       incidents; safeguarding of class members’ funds; the budgeting process; and the\n       District’s Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services waiver. See id. at\n       98-107.\n\nEvans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 286-87.\n       10\n         Clarence Sundram was the expert to the Special Master who “conceived, shaped, and\ndrafted significantly” the 2001 Plan. (2001 Plan at 5 n.1). He was appointed as a co-Special\nMaster on January 30, 2001. (Order, Jan. 30, 2001.)\n\n                                                11\n\findividualized habilitative care and treatment in the least separate, most integrated, and least\n\nrestrictive settings, and to be kept free from harm.” (2001 Plan at 6.) The Plan then identified\n\n(as the Court’s 1999 Order had requested) the agreed-upon “goals” of the existing Court orders.\n\nAccording to the Plan, the parties agreed that existing Court Orders embodied eight goals:\n\n       (1) Appropriate individual habilitation in the community in the least separate,\n       most integrated, and least restrictive environment;\n\n       (2) Protection from harm;\n\n       (3) Safeguarding consumers’ personal possessions;\n\n       (4) Monitoring the service system;\n\n       (5) Advocacy for consumers;\n\n       (6) Adequate budget;\n\n       (7) Timely payment of vendors; and\n\n       (8) Essential systemic conditions.\n\nEvans, 139 F. Supp. 2d at 81.11 For each goal (or subgoal), the Plan identified the “relevant\n\nCourt Orders,” the “specific tasks that must be performed to implement those Orders,” the “time\n\nframes within which the tasks must be performed,” the “specific outcome criteria for measuring\n\ncompliance,” the “standard of compliance,” and the “methods by which evidence will be\n\ncollected and evaluated to assess compliance.” Id. at 81-82.\n\n       The Court approved the 2001 Plan “as, in effect, a statement of the conditions for the\n\nexpected vacating of the Court’s relevant prior Orders.” Id. at 85. It was anticipated that\n\n       [w]hile the Plan is not intended to be an independently enforceable document, the\n\n\n       11\n          The Court’s order and opinion included extensive factual findings documenting the\nDistrict’s failure to meet each of the goals. Id. at 97-107.\n\n                                                 12\n\f        parties do intend that there will be accountability for its implementation. The\n        Plan requires periodic progress reports to the Special Master on its\n        implementation and calls for status conferences with the Court to be scheduled at\n        least bimonthly. The parties agree that if the Court finds that defendants have\n        satisfied the outcome criteria set forth in the Plan, they also will be in compliance\n        with the related Court Orders. Any failure of defendants to implement the tasks\n        identified in the Plan so as to meet the requirements of the related Court Orders\n        would be evidence of noncompliance with those Orders. The Plan provides that\n        until the existing Court Orders are vacated, plaintiffs may seek appropriate\n        judicial relief, including requesting orders requiring compliance with the Order(s)\n        underlying the objectives of the Plan.\n\nId. at 83.\n\n               2.      Creation of the Quality Trust\n\n        The Consent Order and attached Settlement Agreement provided that, in exchange for the\n\nplaintiffs waiving “any and all claims for past violations of the Court’s Orders,” the District\n\nwould “endow and annually fund . . . a durable, independent, nonprofit organization that will\n\nmonitor and advance the individual and collective interests of people with developmental\n\ndisabilities in the District of Columbia’s service delivery system.” Id. at 86. Defendants agreed\n\nto fund the organization, denominated the Quality Trust, with a total of $31.5 million over eleven\n\nyears.12 Ultimately, the goal was for the Quality Trust to be “an external monitoring body to\n\npermanently protect the interests of the class members once this case ends.” Id. at 83.\n\n                                                ***\n\n        The 2001 agreements, which the Court accepted and adopted, contemplated that as\n\ndefendants satisfied the outcome criteria in the 2001 Plan for particular groups of Court Orders,\n\nthey would move the Court to have those Orders vacated and dismissed with the ultimate goal\n\n\n\n        12\n         Of that amount, Quality Trust estimates that the District still has $5 million left to\ncontribute. (Hr’g Tr. at 138, Dec. 17, 2009 [“12/17/09 Tr.”].)\n\n                                                 13\n\fthat, over time, defendants would\n\n        implement all of the required actions and meet the specified outcome criteria in\n        order to successfully move the Court to vacate and dismiss the related Court\n        Orders, except the declaratory judgment on the constitutional rights of the\n        consumers to receive individualized habilitation in the least separate, most\n        integrated and least restrictive environment and to be protected from harm.\n\n(2001 Plan at 9-10 (emphasis added).) Once the Court orders were vacated and dismissed, the\n\nplaintiffs agreed that they would not “seek recourse to the federal court to litigate individual\n\nviolations of rights in this case pursuant to the declaratory judgment which will remain unless:\n\n(1) there are systemic violations of the declaratory judgment; or (2) legal remedies are\n\nunavailable in Superior Court (e.g., due to repeal of the statutes); or (3) there is a failure to\n\nadequately fund the Quality Trust pursuant to the Consent Order dated January 19, 2001.” (Id.)\n\n        Since 2001, however, defendants have not invoked the procedures set forth in the 2001\n\nPlan, to which they agreed, to vacate any Court Orders based on their implementation of the\n\nnecessary tasks and satisfaction of the specified outcome criteria.13 Accordingly, the Court\n\nOrders “continue to remain enforceable in federal court.” (Id.) Moreover, even though the 2001\n\nPlan itself was “not intended to be an enforceable document,” the parties agreed that plaintiffs\n\n“have a great interest in ensuring that the agreed upon actions identified in this Plan are in fact\n\nimplemented effectively and in a timely manner by defendants to secure the benefits and\n\nprotections provided for by the Court Orders,” and provided, therefore, that “in the event that\n\ndefendants do not implement the provisions of this Plan effectively and on a timely basis,\n\n\n        13\n         As noted above (see supra note 2), defendants have now made half-hearted reference to\na limited number of orders that they believe should be vacated (Mem. in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. for\nAlternate Remedy at 3 [“Defs.’ Mem. re Alternate Remedy”]), but prior to this, defendants\nsteadfastly maintained that modification was not realistic; instead, all orders must be vacated and\nthe case dismissed. (See infra note 34.)\n\n                                                  14\n\fplaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor retain the right to seek appropriate judicial relief, based on this\n\nevidence of noncompliance with the Court Orders, including Orders requiring specific\n\nperformance of the Plan.” (Id.)\n\n        J.      2004 Order\n\n        In 2004, after several years of receiving discouraging monitor reports on the\n\nimplementation of the 2001 Plan, this Court14 issued an order to address the “need for greater\n\ncoordination among District of Columbia agencies which have responsibilities for actions that\n\nare necessary to achieve compliance with the 2001 Plan.” (Order at 1, Jan. 21, 2004 [“2004\n\nCoordination Order”].) As described therein, the parties had met with the Court on December\n\n12, 2003, and agreed that “the current lack of such coordination has impeded the timely\n\ncompletion of necessary tasks identified in the 2001 Plan.” (Id. at 1-2.) The 2004 Order\n\nreiterated that the District remained subject to the Court’s previous orders, which were issued “to\n\neffectuate the rights of class members to adequate habilitation in a manner least restrictive of\n\ntheir liberty” and that the purpose of the 2001 Plan was to require defendants to take certain\n\nactions to achieve compliance with those orders. (Id. at 1.) The Order required, inter alia, that\n\nthe Mayor appoint a Deputy Mayor or other senior official “to be responsible for the day-to-day\n\nefforts of District of Columbia agencies to achieve compliance with this Court’s orders and the\n\n2001 Plan.” (Id. at 2.) That individual was to “have the necessary authority to supervise and\n\ndirect the activities of” and “coordinate the efforts of all District of Columbia agencies” as\n\nnecessary to “carry out their obligations under the 2001 Plan and previous orders of this Court,”\n\n\n\n        14\n         Shortly after the 2001 Plan was approved, Judge Harris retired and this case was\nreassigned to the undersigned.\n\n                                                  15\n\fand was to “cooperate with and report periodically to the Special Masters and Court Monitor on\n\ndefendants’ progress,” and “appear before this Court at each status conference and report to the\n\nCourt on behalf of defendants regarding the status of defendants’ compliance with the 2001 Plan\n\nand orders of this Court.” (Id. at 3.)15\n\nII.    MOTION FOR RECEIVERSHIP: LIABILITY PHASE\n\n       In May 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Court to find defendants in\n\nnoncompliance with the outstanding Court Orders and to place the District’s Mental Retardation\n\nand Developmental Disabilities Administration (“MRDDA”) into receivership.16 The Court\n\nbifurcated proceedings into a “liability” and a “remedy” phase. Evans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 291\n\n(“March 2007 Liability Opinion”).\n\n       While the liability phase was ongoing, several notable events occurred. On December\n\n20, 2006, the “Developmental Disabilities Services Agency,” later renamed the “Department on\n\nDisability Services,” was established by emergency legislation as a separate Cabinet-level\n\nagency to serve consumers formerly served by the MRDDA, including the Evans class members.\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities Services Management Reform Emergency Amendment Act of 2006,\n\n§§ 103, 105(1), (2). In January 2007, Adrian Fenty took office as Mayor for the District of\n\nColumbia. On February 5, 2007, defendants asked the Court to delay its liability ruling in light\n\nof the new administration’s “commitment to DDS and its consumers” and its newly adopted\n\n\n       15\n         Since January 2004, several different individuals have served in this capacity.\nPresently, the Mayor’s appointee is Peter Nickles, the Attorney General for the District of\nColumbia. But see infra pp. 30-31.\n       16\n        The United States, as plaintiff-intervenor, also filed a motion for an order to show cause\nwhy defendants should not be held in contempt. The Court denied that motion on March 30,\n2007. (Order, Mar. 30, 2007.)\n\n                                                16\n\f“Systems Improvement Plan” in order “to allow sufficient time for the DDS to appropriately\n\naddress the continuing concerns of the Court, the Monitor, the Department of Justice, and\n\nplaintiffs.” (Defs.’ Notice of Filing of Supplemental Information in Resp. to the Ct. Monitor’s\n\nQuarterly Report at 10, Feb. 5, 2007.) In making its request, the District indicated that it was\n\n“cognizant that much remains to be done to bring DDS into compliance with outstanding court\n\norders and the 2001 Plan,” but promised the Court that the “Fenty Administration is fully\n\ncommitted to the success of the new agency, the delivery of improved services and care to the\n\nconsumers served by the agency, and compliance with the 2001 Plan.” (Id. at 8.) At a status\n\nhearing the next day, the Court rejected this request and indicated that it intended to issue its\n\nliability ruling based on the record as of November 29, 2006, when the Court Monitor had filed\n\nher supplemental report as requested by the Court, but that information about improvements and\n\naccomplishments after that date would be considered in any remedy phase. (Hr’g Tr. at 23-24,\n\nFeb. 6, 2007.)\n\n       On March 30, 2007, the Court issued its liability ruling, concluding that plaintiffs had\n\nmet their burden to show that there had been “systemic, continuous, and serious noncompliance”\n\nwith the Court’s prior Orders. Evans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 325.\n\n       A.        Findings: Health, Safety and Welfare\n\n       The Court organized its findings in terms of these three broad subject areas: health, safety\n\nand welfare. Based on a record that closed in November 2006, the Court found that\n\n       plaintiffs have demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that defendants\n       have failed to comply with existing Court Orders in the core areas of health,\n       safety, and welfare. These failures are systemic in that they affect many class\n       members served by a cross-section of providers and occur throughout defendants’\n       service delivery system. They are serious in that they concern matters that are\n       integral to class members’ health, safety, and well-being. And, they are\n\n                                                 17\n\f       continuous in that the same issues of noncompliance have persisted year after\n       year.\n\nId. at 298. A brief summary of the Court’s findings follows.\n\n       In the category of “health,” the Court found that:\n\n       defendants have failed in many significant respects to accomplish the tasks and to\n       achieve the outcome criteria in the 2001 Plan that relate to the Court’s Orders\n       regarding the provision of health care and to comply with the terms of the Orders\n       themselves. Defendants’ deficient performance with respect to these measures\n       provides ample evidence that defendants have failed to comply with the Court’s\n       Order that “[a] program of medical, dental and health related services which\n       provides accessibility, quality and continuity of care is required,” as well as with\n       Court Orders requiring development of habilitation plans and programs that\n       incorporate all services needed by class members and implementation of\n       appropriate training programs for all staff.\n\nId. at 305 (citations omitted).\n\n       In the category of “safety,” the Court found that:\n\n       defendants have failed in many significant respects to accomplish the tasks and\n       outcome criteria associated with the Court’s Orders relating to class member\n       safety and to comply with the terms of the Orders themselves. Defendants’\n       performance in the areas discussed above provides ample evidence that\n       defendants have failed to comply with the Court’s Orders prohibiting all acts of\n       “physical or psychological abuse, neglect or mistreatment” of class members,\n       requiring the prompt reporting and investigation of all such incidents and the\n       prompt dissemination of the reports of such investigations to the Court Monitor\n       and other interested parties, requiring the development and implementation of\n       appropriate training programs for all staff, including staff assigned to residential\n       settings, and requiring defendants to provide necessary monitoring mechanisms.\n\nId. at 313-314 (citations omitted).\n\n       Finally, in the category of “welfare,” the Court found that defendants were not in\n\ncompliance in several respects. First, in terms of the “least restrictive, most integrated setting\n\nrequirement,” the Court found that:\n\n       defendants have not complied with the Court’s 1978 Order that all class members\n       be provided with “community living arrangements suitable to each, together with\n\n                                                 18\n\f        such community-based day programs and services as are necessary to provide\n        them within minimally adequate habilitation . . . in the least separate, most\n        integrated and least restrictive community settings.”\n\nId. at 319 (quoting Evans, 459 F. Supp. at 484). The Court also found serious problems in the\n\nareas of implementing “individual support plans” (“ISPs”) and thus in “ensuring that class\n\nmembers actually receive the services and supports they require,” id. at 320, and a failure to\n\ncomply with orders regarding “adaptive equipment.” Id. at 321. Finally, the Court found\n\nproblems in the area of case management, concluding that:\n\n        defendants “fail[ed] to ensure that case managers complete the required number\n        of visits and that they take appropriate action when a class member has been the\n        subject of a serious incident”; “[f]ail[ed] to ensure that case managers are\n        properly trained before receiving caseloads”; and that case managers “fail[ed] to\n        ensure that ISPs are fully implemented.”\n\nId. at 324.\n\n        The Court summarized its findings as follows:\n\n        As a result of these failings, class members continue to be placed in inappropriate\n        and overly restrictive residential and day programs, rather than in the least\n        restrictive, most integrated settings. Provider and MRDDA staff, including case\n        managers, are not adequately trained, and case managers do not visit class\n        members with the required frequency and do not adequately address deficiencies\n        in class members’ care. In many instances, class members do not receive the\n        needed services and supports that have been identified in their ISPs. Protocols\n        necessary to protect class members’ health and safety, such as feeding,\n        positioning, and behavioral plans, are routinely not followed. Health risks are not\n        adequately assessed and monitored for many class members, and\n        recommendations by health care providers are not implemented in a timely\n        manner. While incidents of abuse and neglect of class members persist,\n        defendants have failed to ensure that these and other serious incidents, including\n        class member deaths, are investigated in a timely manner, that the results of such\n        investigations are shared with providers, and that recommended corrective and\n        preventive actions are implemented. Defendants have also compromised the\n        monitoring process by altering death investigation reports.\n\nId. at 324-25. These findings were the basis for the Court’s ultimate conclusion that defendants’\n\n\n                                                19\n\fnoncompliance with Court orders had been “systemic, continuous and serious.” Id. at 325.\n\n       B.      Remedy\n\n       As for the remedy of receivership sought by the plaintiffs, the Court observed:\n\n       Although it is clear based on the tortured history of this case that there have been\n       repeated failures to comply with the Court’s Orders, this determination is in no\n       way determinative of the question whether plaintiffs are correct in their argument\n       that a receivership should be imposed.\n\nId. at 326. Rather, receivership is a “remedy of last resort,” that “should be undertaken only\n\nwhen absolutely necessary.” Id. (quoting District of Columbia v. Jerry M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1213 (D.C. 1999)).\n\n       In light of the complexity of this inquiry, and the fact that “recent developments . . . are\n\nencouraging and will be highly relevant to the remedial phase of this action,” the Court\n\ndetermined that it would “enlist the assistance of the Special Masters, who have ably served in\n\nthis capacity for many years, to make findings and recommendations to the Court that address,\n\ninter alia, the current status of defendants’ compliance, what are the available options for curing\n\nthe identified deficiencies, and whether a receivership is the most effective and efficient remedy\n\navailable to the Court.” Id. at 326. The Court instructed that the “determination whether other\n\nremedies are inadequate and whether receivership remains the only viable option to effectuate\n\ncompliance with court orders is to be guided by a number of factors, including\n\n       (1) “whether there were repeated failures to comply with the Court’s orders”; (2)\n       whether further efforts to secure compliance would only lead to “confrontation\n       and delay”; (3) whether leadership is available which can “turn the tide within a\n       reasonable time period”; (4) “whether there was bad faith”; (5) “whether\n       resources are being wasted”; and, (6) “whether a receiver can provide a quick and\n       efficient remedy.”\n\nId. (quoting Jerry M., 738 A.2d at 1213 (quoting Dixon v. Barry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1467532\"><a href=\"/opinion/1467532/dixon-v-barry/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Court’s final observation was that “the daunting task of finding ways to remedy the\n\nproblems still remains. In this regard, the Court expects the parties to continue their prior efforts\n\nto resolve this matter so that the plight of the class members can be improved as expeditiously as\n\npossible, and they will not have to continue to await the outcome of this painfully lengthy and\n\ncumbersome litigation.” Id. at 327.\n\nIII.    MOTION FOR RECEIVERSHIP: REMEDY PHASE\n\n        A.      Supplemental Order of Reference to the Special Masters\n\n        Following the issuance of the March 30, 2007 decision, the parties conferred and jointly\n\nagreed on a supplemental order of reference to the Special Masters. (Supp. Order of Reference,\n\nMay 3, 2007 [“2007 Reference Order”].) The 2007 Reference Order provided, inter alia, as\n\nfollows:\n\n        Both Margaret G. Farrell and Clarence J. Sundram have served as Special Masters\n        in this case for many years under prior Orders of Reference. The Court finds that\n        it is justified and necessary to continue their appointment to assist the Court for as\n        long as the Court deems necessary in this matter.\n\n(Id. at 1.) It further provided that:\n\n        The Masters are authorized to conduct proceedings relating to the necessity for\n        remedial relief, including, as needed, discovery, hearings, mediation and\n        settlement negotiations. At the conclusion of such proceedings, the Masters will\n        issue a report to the Court making recommended findings of fact, conclusions of\n        law and recommendations regarding appropriate remedies.\n\n(Id. at 2.) Following the issuance of the Special Masters’ report and recommendations, the\n\nparties were to “file objections to (or file a motion to adopt or to modify) such order, report or\n\nrecommendations.” (Id. at 4.) The parties were directed that all objections should “specifically\n\nidentify the portions of the order, or report containing proposed findings of fact, conclusions of\n\nlaw and recommendations for remedial action, to which objection is made and the basis for the\n\n                                                 21\n\fobjection.” (Id.) Finally, the Order provided that this Court would review de novo “all\n\nobjections to the Masters’ proposed findings of fact and recommendations regarding remedial\n\nrelief” and “all objections to conclusions of law made or recommended by the Masters.” (Id.)\n\n       B.      September 12, 2007 Consent Order (“90-Day Order”)\n\n       After a quarterly status conference on August 9, 2007,17 the parties agreed to develop,\n\nand the Court ultimately entered, a consent order “setting forth a limited number of concrete,\n\nshort-term goals related to retaining and increasing the number of qualified providers and\n\nimproving the health and safety of class members” that the District agreed to achieve “during the\n\nthree-month period from October 1, 2007, to December 31, 2007.” (Order at 1, Sept. 12, 2007\n\n[“2007 90-Day Consent Order”]). Pursuant to that Order, defendants agreed to take a number of\n\nspecific actions that were focused on these two critical goals. (Id. at 2.) The Special Masters\n\nwere tasked with determining defendants’ compliance with the 2007 90-Day Consent Order,\n\nbeginning in January 2008. (Id. at 1.)\n\n       On August 18, 2008, the Special Masters filed their Report and Recommendation\n\nregarding defendants’ compliance with the 2007 90-Day Order. (Special Masters’ Report &\n\nRecommendation Regarding Defs.’ Compliance with the Consent Order of Sept. 12, 2007, Aug.\n\n18, 2008 [“2008 Special Masters’ Report”].) The 2008 Special Masters’ Report concluded that\n\noverall defendants “did not demonstrate substantial compliance with six out of the 13 provisions\n\nof the Consent Order that they recently agreed-upon, and whose obligations they concede they\n\n\n\n       17\n          At the August 9, 2007 status conference, the director of DDS, Judith Heumann,\ninformed the Court that (1) the name of the MRDDA was changing to the Developmental\nDisabilities Administration (“DDA”); and (2) that Laura Nuss would be the new deputy\noverseeing the DDA. (Hr’g. Tr. at 5, Aug. 9, 2007.)\n\n                                                22\n\fclearly understood.”18 Id. at 107.\n\n       C.      Monitoring Compliance\n\n       At the same time it issued the 2007 90-Day Consent Order, the Court ordered the parties\n\nto “file with the Court the agreed-upon methodology to be used by the Court Monitor to monitor\n\ndefendants’ compliance with the requirements of the 2001 Plan and the existing Court Orders by\n\nJanuary 10, 2008.” (Minute Order, Sept. 12, 2007). Following the issuance of this Order, the\n\nCourt Monitor circulated to the parties and the Special Masters a proposed monitoring protocol.\n\nOn November 21, 2007, defendants filed a notice stating:\n\n       By communication of November 16, 2007, faced with the expenditure of\n       substantial resources and time to develop the above-referenced methodology,\n       Defendants informed the Court Monitor that a meeting to develop a methodology\n       would not be needed since Defendants would not assert that conditions have so\n       fundamentally changed at this point that such comprehensive monitoring is\n       appropriate. Accordingly, Defendants expressed the view that there was no need\n       for the comprehensive monitoring proposed by the Court Monitor and the\n       significant expense attendant thereto that would be incurred.\n\n(Defs.’ Notice Concerning Proposed Comprehensive Monitoring at 2, Nov. 21, 2007 (emphasis\n\nadded).) By May 2008, a monitoring protocol had still not been agreed upon. Just prior to the\n\nstatus conference set for May 15, 2008, defendants filed a motion to stay discovery during the\n\nremedial phase of the case, which was denied by the Court. (Hr’g Tr. at 38, May 15, 2008.) On\n\nMay 19, 2008, the Court issued a scheduling order to govern the remedy phase.\n\n\n\n       18\n         On September 15, 2008, defendants filed a motion for an order modifying the 2008\nSpecial Masters’ Report to find defendants in compliance with the 2007 90-Day Consent Order.\n(Defs.’ Mot. to Modify the Special Masters’ Report & Recommendation, Consistent with Defs.’\nObjections, to Find Defs. in Compliance with the Consent Order of Sept. 12, 2007, at 1, Sept. 15,\n2008.) On October 6, 2008, the Court held this motion in abeyance and to the extent it is\nnecessary to address this motion, it will be done in the Court’s opinion regarding defendants’\nobjections to the 2008 Special Masters’ Report and Recommendation.\n\n                                               23\n\f       On June 13, 2008, plaintiffs, in response to the Court’s request, filed a summary of the\n\nremedies they were seeking. That filing set forth a range of possible remedies, “running from no\n\naction by the Court up to court-appointed receivership over the entire Department on Disability\n\nServices, with oversight of all District agency functions pertaining to Evans class members and\n\nother individuals with developmental disabilities served by the defendants.” (Pls.’ Filing on\n\nRemedies at 1, June 13, 2008.) Among these alternatives, plaintiffs endorsed the remedy of\n\nappointing a “Special Administrator,” who would “oversee[] government agencies and functions\n\npertaining to class members until the District achieves substantial compliance with the Court’s\n\nOrders,” but who would not have all the powers of a receiver. (Id. at 3.)\n\n       D.      Proceedings Before the Special Masters\n\n       Following additional discovery and pretrial proceedings, the Special Masters conducted a\n\nthree-day trial on December 10-12, 2008. Direct testimony from both fact and expert witnesses\n\nwas presented by declaration or excerpts from depositions. (Special Masters’ Final Pretrial\n\nOrder at 6, Nov. 28, 2008.) All witnesses were subject to live cross-examination. (Trial Tr.,\n\nDec. 10, 2008; Trial Tr., Dec. 11, 2008.) Plaintiffs presented the testimony of two fact\n\nwitnesses19 and two expert witnesses.20 Defendants presented the testimony of six fact\n\nwitnesses21 and three expert witnesses.22 In addition, more than 200 exhibits were introduced\n\n       19\n         John M. Cook, Executive Director, L’Arche, Inc.; Thomas F. Wilds, member of\ninteragency rate-setting task force.\n       20\n       Martha B. Knisley; Lewis H. Spence, lecturer, Harvard School of Education and\nKennedy School of Government (remedy).\n       21\n         Laura L. Nuss, Deputy Director of the Department on Disability Services, responsible\nfor the Developmental Disabilities Administration; John McCarthy, Deputy Director of the\nDepartment of Health Care Finance and District of Columbia State Medicaid Director; Kathy\nSawyer, former consultant and Interim Director, DDS, former Evans Compliance Officer\n\n                                               24\n\finto evidence. Subsequently, both parties submitted Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions\n\nof Law, as well as post-trial briefs. The Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities filed an\n\namicus brief in support of plaintiffs’ motion and for the appointment of a Special Administrator.\n\nOn February 9, 2009, closing arguments were heard by the Special Masters.\n\n       E.      Districts’ Motions to Vacate: April 20, 2009\n\n       On April 20, 2009, shortly before the Special Masters issued a draft of their Report and\n\nRecommendation, defendants filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n60(b)(5) to vacate all consent orders and dismiss the case. Defendants asserted that “[c]ontinued\n\nfederal-court oversight is no longer equitable, as there is no question that the District has\n\nremedied the alleged constitutional and statutory violations that gave rise to the 1978 Consent\n\nOrder and its progeny” and “there is no reasonable basis for asserting that the District will revert\n\nto violating the law if the Court’s orders are lifted.” (Defs.’ Mot. to Vacate Consent Orders and\n\nDismiss Action at 1, Apr. 20, 2009.) For the first time, in a litigation that has been ongoing for\n\nmore than 30 years and despite repeated promises to comply with the existing Court orders,\n\ndefendants took the position that their noncompliance was irrelevant to the question of whether\n\nthe Court should continue enforcing its orders because those orders went “beyond minimum\n\nstandards necessary to satisfy constitutional requirements.” (Id. at 3.) In a minute order filed on\n\nMay 1, 2009, the Court advised the parties that no opposition to defendants’ motion should be\n\n\n\n(through Jan. 31, 2008) and former Interim Administrator, MRDDA; Judith Heumann, Director,\nDDS; Amy Brooks, President of RCM, a provider agency; Lisa Alexander, M.D., DC HRP.\n       22\n          David L. Jackson, M.D., PhD, President, Jackson & Assocs. (2007 mortality review and\nfollow-up on recommendations for improvement); Nancy Thaler, Executive Director, National\nAssociation of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services; and John Sumner, Ph.D\n(statistical analysis).\n\n                                                 25\n\ffiled because it intended to hold it in abeyance until it received the Special Masters’ final Report\n\nand Recommendation.\n\n       F.      Special Masters’ Report and Recommendations\n\n       On May 22, 2009, the Special Masters circulated, as required by the 2007 Supplemental\n\nOrder of Reference, a draft of their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for\n\ncomment. In that draft, the Special Masters “recommended that the Court’s 2004 Order be\n\namended to provide for a Special Compliance Officer to be jointly appointed by the Court and\n\nthe Mayor with enhanced authority to coordinate and direct the activities of the various District\n\nagencies urgently needed to deliver constitutionally acceptable services to the plaintiff class.”\n\n(2009 Special Masters’ Report at 4.) The draft recommended “that the Court appoint the Deputy\n\nDirector of DDS/DDA, Laura Nuss, as the Special Compliance Officer merging in one person\n\nthe legal responsibility under local law with the responsibilities and authority to be conferred by\n\nthe Court, to lead defendants’ efforts to achieve compliance with the court orders.” (Id. at 135.)\n\nThe Special Masters believed that “this least intrusive, and least expensive, remedy was most\n\nlikely . . . to achieve compliance with Court Orders.” (Id. at 4.) However, this remedy “required\n\nthe Mayor’s agreement.” (Id.) On July 6, 2009, the parties filed their comments on and\n\nobjections to the draft report. Defendants’ comments indicated that the Mayor would not agree\n\nto the proposal to appoint a Special Compliance Officer, making that remedy “no longer a viable\n\none.” (Id. at 135.)\n\n       On August 14, 2009, the Special Masters filed their final Report and Recommendations,\n\nbased on the record from November 29, 2006, the close of the record for the liability phase,\n\nthrough December 2008, when they closed the record before them. (Id. at 3.) As described\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fherein, the Special Masters found that “plaintiffs had proved by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat defendants continue to be in serious noncompliance with critical provisions of outstanding\n\ncourt orders” in the areas of health, safety, and welfare. (Id.) They recommended as a remedy\n\nthe appointment of an “Independent Compliance Administrator accountable only to the Court to\n\nsupervise and coordinate defendants’ serial compliance with individual court ordered obligations\n\nso that the suit may be dismissed in three years time or less.” (Id. at 4-5).\n\n               1.       Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n                        a.     Health\n\n       In the area of health, the Special Masters found that defendants were noncompliant in\n\nseveral significant respects. First, regarding medical care, they found that defendants had “failed\n\nto completely perform some or all of the following duties”: “documenting significant health\n\nproblems in class members’ health management plans; monitoring implementation of health\n\nplans; implementing recommendations put forward by class members’ physicians and medical\n\nspecialists and completing lab work and physician-ordered diagnostic tests.” (Id. at 26-27.)\n\nThus, they concluded:\n\n       The evidence in the record indicates that a significant portion of the plaintiff class\n       have health care needs that are not identified in their health plans. Furthermore,\n       too often needs identified in health plans are not met because health plans are not\n       implemented – i.e. diagnostic tests, consultations and treatments and follow up\n       appointments are not provided or documented in their health records.\n\n(Id. at 31.) The Special Masters also found “ongoing and significant problems with the delivery\n\nof timely and appropriate mental health and behavioral healthcare.” (Id. at 35.) These problems\n\nincluded:\n\n       a) lack of access to sufficient psychiatric and psychological services; b) improper\n       professional practices that are inconsistent with professional standards; c)\n\n                                                 27\n\f       recommended clinical therapies not being implemented; d) the failure to integrate\n       the use of psychotropic medications into an overall treatment plan; e) the failure\n       to obtain informed consent and approval from Human Rights Committees for use\n       of these restrictive measures; and f) the lack of monitoring of the usage and side\n       effects of psychotropic medications.\n\n(Id.)23 Finally, the Special Masters found that “delays in obtaining guardianship for the\n\nprovision of informed consent for medical and dental treatment of class members . . . have\n\ncontinued” (id. at 45), sometimes “for months, sometimes more than a year, after the need for a\n\nguardian is first identified.” (Id. at 50.) As a result, treatment is delayed and class members\n\nsuffer harmful consequences. (Id. at 49-50.)\n\n       Based on these findings, the Special Masters concluded that “plaintiffs have established\n\nby clear and convincing evidence” that defendants continue “to be in non-compliance with . . .\n\noutstanding consent orders” with regard to (1) “class members’ health” (id. at 31); (2) “mental\n\nand behavioral health care” (id. at 41-42); and (3) timely appointment of guardians. (Id. at 49-\n\n50.)\n\n                       b.      Safety and Protection from Harm\n\n       The Special Masters found the following problems with respect to defendants’\n\nobligations to ensure plaintiffs’ safety and protection from harm: (1) “a significant number of\n\nuntimely investigations” into “serious reportable incidents” and deaths (id. at 52-53); (2) “some\n\nIMEU reports continue to fail to thoroughly investigate serious reportable incidents” (id. at 54);\n\n(3) except for Level I incidents, “the investigation report format does not inquire about potential\n\ncauses and contributory factors leading to the incident under investigation” (id. at 56); (4) an\n\n\n\n       23\n         “About one third of the class members (228) receive psychotropic medications,” and\n“305 class members have behavior support plans.” (Id. at 35.)\n\n                                                 28\n\finability to “identif[y] and address[] systemic issues arising in investigations (id. at 57); (5)\n\n“numerous instances of providers filing late incident reports or no reports at all, conducting\n\ninadequate investigations, or failing to conduct required investigations with no recommendations\n\nfor or evidence of enforcement actions being taken in response to these deficiencies” (id. at 60);\n\n(6) “[i]ncidents of harm . . . , including serious physical injury, physical abuse and neglect” (id.\n\nat 60); (7) harm resulting from “delays in treatment due to problems with getting informed\n\nconsent (id. at 61); (8) “harm due to inadequate health care management” (id.); and (9) harm\n\nresulting from problems with the District’s “transportation broker contract.” (Id. at 64).\n\n       Based on these findings, the Special Masters concluded that “while there are some\n\nnascent signs of progress in a few areas,” there was “clear and convincing evidence that the\n\nproblems being experienced by class members in the area of safety and protection from harm are\n\ncontinuing, serious and systemic.” (Id. at 67.)\n\n                       c.      Welfare\n\n       In terms of court orders concerning plaintiff’s “welfare,” the Special Masters found the\n\nplaintiffs had “not sustained their burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence\n\nnon-compliance with court orders requiring residential placements in less restrictive settings”\n\n(id. at 72); with court orders requiring that “all class members have written ISPs containing\n\ncurrent habilitation plans, behavioral support plans and health plans” (id. at 78); or with court\n\norders requiring a minimum of eight visits per year by a service coordinator/case manager. (Id.\n\nat 82). However, they did find continuing problems in the following areas: (1) segregated day\n\nprograms with arts and crafts as the primary activity and a lack of opportunity for community\n\nexperiences (id. at 73-74); (2) supported employment (id. at 74); (3) implementation of ISPs (id.\n\n\n                                                  29\n\fat 77-79); and (4) service coordinators not ensuring that ISPs are fully implemented or following\n\nup when they are not. (Id. at 81-84.)\n\n       Based on these findings, the Special Masters concluded that there is “clear and\n\nconvincing evidence” that defendants have “not met their obligation . . . to provide adequate\n\nhabilitation in non-residential, least restrictive, community-integrated settings” (id. at 74), or to\n\n“[p]rovide all necessary and proper monitoring mechanisms to assure that community living\n\narrangements, programs and supportive community services of the necessary quantity and\n\nquality are provided and maintained.” (Id. at 83-84).\n\n                       d.      Interagency Coordination\n\n       As the Special Masters noted,\n\n       [a]lthough the primary responsibility for providing timely and effective services\n       and supports to class members rests with DDS/DDA, the success of this enterprise\n       depends upon the coordinated efforts of several District agencies, including\n       MAA/DHCF (formerly the Medical Assistance Administration (MAA) in the\n       Department of Health (DOH) and now the Department of Health Care Finance\n       (DHCF)), through which most of the funding is provided, the Health Regulation\n       and Licensing Agency (HRLA) in the DOH, which is responsible for licensing\n       and enforcement with respect to ICFs/MR, the Office of the Inspector General,\n       which has investigative responsibilities for Medicaid fraud and abuse, the Office\n       of Attorney General which files petitions for guardianships in court, and other\n       agencies involved in the personnel, procurement, and budget process . . .\n       includ[ing] the Office of Contracts and Procurement, which has a significant role\n       in the contracting process.\n\n(Id. at 84.) As described supra, the 2004 Coordination Order was aimed at improving\n\ninteragency communication coordination. The Special Masters found that despite evidence of\n\nimprovement, “[t]here has been little evidence submitted regarding specific compliance with [the\n\n2004 Order].” (Id. at 90.) According to the Special Masters\n\n       [w]hat is missing is evidence of leadership or coordination by the Mayor’s\n       designee—the central point of the order—to give focus, direction and priority to\n\n                                                  30\n\f        interagency communication and coordination, to identify planned actions of one\n        agency that may adversely affect the mission of another and to take proactive\n        steps to prevent such a consequence. In the absence of evidence of such efforts,\n        the interagency efforts at the staff level between agencies have not been\n        consistently successful, and gaps in communication and coordination have\n        resulted in harm to class members.\n\n(Id. at 90.) Indeed, the Special Masters found that “[t]he evidence is that leaders in the key\n\nagencies that have the most significant interagency relationship . . . were unaware of the existing\n\ncourt order or of the responsibility of the Mayor’s designee in implementing it.” (Id. at 92.)\n\nThese findings led the Special Masters to conclude that\n\n        the current lack of awareness by key senior officials of the Order’s existence and\n        its requirements, coupled with the absence of evidence of regular interagency\n        meetings or communications with the Mayor’s designee regarding significant\n        initiatives, and the evidence of breakdowns in interagency coordination leading to\n        the problems discussed above, are all clear and convincing evidence of ongoing\n        noncompliance with this court order which was that this Court Order has not been\n        implemented as intended to remedy a long-standing problem of lack of\n        interagency coordination.\n\n(Id. at 93.)\n\n               2.      Remedy\n\n        The Special Masters concluded “that the plaintiffs have demonstrated by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that there is a need for additional remedial measures ordered by the Court.”\n\n(Id. at 133.) Having been unsuccessful in their attempt to get defendants to agree to their first\n\nchoice of remedy, and after many years of futile attempts to reach an agreement with the Fenty\n\nAdministration as to a workable remedy, the Special Masters’ final report recommended the\n\nappointment of an “Independent Compliance Administrator” who “would be appointed by the\n\nCourt, be accountable only to the Court and would not hold an executive appointment.” (Id. at\n\n134.) As described by the Special Masters, the Independent Compliance Administrator would\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fnot have the same powers of a receiver but would\n\n       serve as the focal point for the compliance efforts of the defendants and work in\n       close collaboration with them, resulting in regular submissions of compliance\n       reports as set forth in the 2001 Plan, and phased judicial disengagement from\n       active supervision of the defendants’ developmental disabilities service system\n       within three years. The Independent Compliance Administrator is not intended to\n       have the powers of a receiver or to generally displace the power and authority of\n       agency heads or subordinate officers. Rather, the authority and role of the\n       Independent Compliance Administrator is limited to actions necessary to achieve\n       compliance with the court orders within a three year period. All District agencies\n       and personnel should be directed to cooperate with the Independent Compliance\n       Administrator. If there is a lack of cooperation, or resistance or intransigence, the\n       Independent Compliance Administrator should be required to report it\n       immediately to the Special Masters or the Court.\n\n(Id. at 134-35.)\n\nIV.    CURRENT PROCEDURAL POSTURE\n\n       At a status conference on August 19, 2009, the Court set a briefing schedule for plaintiffs\n\nto respond to defendants’ motion for vacatur and dismissal, combined with a timetable for filing\n\nobjections to the 2009 Special Masters’ Report. Pursuant to the Court’s order, defendants\n\nrenewed their motion to vacate the consent orders and dismiss the action and combined it with\n\ntheir objections to the 2009 Special Masters’ Report. (Defs.’ Renewed Mot. to Vacate Consent\n\nOrders and To Dismiss Action, Oct. 7, 2009 [“Defs.’ Mot. to Vacate”].) On November 6, 2009,\n\nplaintiffs filed their opposition to that motion (combined with their endorsement of the Special\n\nMasters’ Report and Recommendations (Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Objections to the Special Masters’\n\nReport & Recommendation, and Opp’n to their Mot. to Vacate All Prior Orders and Dismiss the\n\nCase, Nov. 6, 2009 [“Pls.’ Opp’n”]). Plaintiff-intervenor, the United States, and the Quality\n\nTrust, as amicus curiae, also filed oppositions to defendants’ motion. (Pl. Intervenor’s Opp’n to\n\nDefs.’ Renewed Mot. to Vacate Consent Orders and To Dismiss Action, Nov. 6, 2009; Amicus\n\n\n                                                32\n\fCuriae Br. of Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities, Inc., Nov. 11, 2009 [“Quality Trust\n\nOpp’n”].) Defendants filed their reply on December 2, 2009. (Defs.’ Consolidated Reply in\n\nSupport of Mot. to Vacate Consent Orders and To Dismiss Action, Dec. 2, 2009.) On December\n\n17-18, 2009, the Court heard argument on defendants’ motions to vacate and to dismiss and on\n\nwhether to adopt the 2009 Special Masters’ Report. The Court will address herein defendants’\n\nmotions and will address plaintiffs’ request that the Court adopt the 2009 Special Masters’\n\nReport in a subsequent memorandum.\n\n                                           ANALYSIS\n\n       Defendants have moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), “at the\n\nconclusion of a period of monitoring not to exceed three months,24 to vacate the Consent Order\n\nentered on June 14, 1978 . . . together with all subsequent remedial orders, and to dismiss the\n\naction.” (Defs.’ Mot. to Vacate at 1.)\n\n       Rule 60(b)(5) provides that “the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from\n\na final judgment, order, or proceeding” if “the judgment has been satisfied, released or\n\ndischarged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it\n\nprospectively is no longer equitable . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) (emphasis added).\n\nDefendants seek relief solely on the ground that enforcing the existing orders prospectively is\n\n“no longer equitable.” (Defs.’ Mot. to Vacate at 4.) Conceding they are not in compliance with\n\nexisting court orders (see 12/17/09 Tr. at 14-16), defendants nonetheless contend that all court\n\n\n\n       24\n         Under their latest filing, defendants propose the period of court monitoring and\nsupervision to end at the end of 2010. (Defs.’ Mot. for Alternate Remedy at 2.). Defendants,\nhowever, seek to have the Court accept their alternative remedy while still preserving their rights\nto appeal the denial of their motion for vacatur and dismissal. (Id. at 2 & n.2.)\n\n                                                33\n\forders should be vacated because they have “remedied the alleged constitutional and statutory\n\nviolations that gave rise to the 1978 Consent Order and its progeny, and continued federal-court\n\noversight is therefore no longer either equitable or permissible.” (Mem. in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot.\n\nto Vacate at 3 [“Defs.’ Mem.”] (citing Horne v.

Ct. at 2595. In the alternative, a\n\nsignificant change in law may warrant modification or vacatur of a decree “when the statutory or\n\ndecisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was designed to prevent.” Rufo, 502\n\n\n                                                  34\n\fU.S. at 388; see also Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2595 (“[C]ourts must remain attentive to the fact that\n\n‘federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that\n\ndoes not violate [federal law] or does not flow from such a violation.’” (quoting Milliken, 433\n\nU.S. at 282 )).\n\n       In considering a request for modification in an institutional reform case, a district court\n\nmust take a “flexible approach.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2594; see also Rufo, 502 U.S. at 381; Frew,\n\n540 U.S. at 441. “A flexible approach allows courts to ensure that ‘responsibility for discharging\n\nthe State’s obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials’ when the circumstances\n\nwarrant.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2595 (quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 442). “If the State establishes\n\nreason to modify the decree, the court should make the necessary changes; where it has not done\n\nso, however, the decree should be enforced according to its terms.” Frew, 540 U.S. at 442.\n\nRelief is warranted if the significant change “renders continued enforcement ‘detrimental to the\n\npublic interest.’” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2593 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384).\n\n       Defendants contend that there has been both a significant change in law and a significant\n\nchange in factual conditions and that these changes satisfy Horne’s requirements for vacatur.\n\nDefendants could, of course, obtain vacatur by complying with the court orders. However, they\n\nconcede they have not achieved compliance. (12/17/09 Tr. at 20-21.) Nonetheless, they argue\n\nthat the objects of the court orders have been attained because (1) the scope of the right to\n\nhabilitation recognized in the 1978 Consent Order and the many subsequent consent orders is\n\npremised on an incorrect understanding of the law, as established by the Supreme Court’s 1982\n\ndecision in Youngberg and, therefore, those parts of the consent orders that are dependent on that\n\ndefinition are “extraconstitutional,”(i.e., not based on any constitutional violation) and thus are\n\n\n                                                 35\n\flegally unenforceable; and (2) the remaining parts of the 1978 Consent Order and subsequent\n\nconsent orders impose requirements that exceed minimal constitutional standards, and thus,\n\nunder Horne, defendants are entitled to vacatur once they achieve the minimum, which they\n\nclaim to have done.\n\n       Defendants’ argument for vacatur fails because (1) Youngberg does not represent a\n\nsignificant change in law (Section I(A)); (2) even if Youngberg constituted a significant change,\n\ndefendants failed to make that argument within a reasonable time after Youngberg was decided\n\n(Section I(B)); (3) no matter how Youngberg is interpreted, it can only support a limited\n\nmodification of the consent orders (Section I(C)); (4) defendants have misinterpreted Horne\n\nwhen arguing that the objectives of the consent decrees have been met because they have\n\nsatisfied the constitutional floor (Section II(A)); and (5) defendants have failed to establish that a\n\ndurable remedy is in place (Section II(B)).\n\nI.     DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO VACATUR BASED ON A CHANGE\n       IN LAW\n\n       A.      Youngberg Was Not a Significant Change in Law\n\n        According to defendants, Youngberg was a significant change in law because “[i]n its\n\n1978 Consent Order, this Court adopted a much more expansive definition of the Fifth\n\nAmendment right to habilitative care and treatment” than Youngberg recognizes or permits.\n\n(Defs.’ Mem. at 16 n.13.) Specifically, defendants take issue with the portions of the 1978\n\nConsent Order, to which they agreed, emphasized below:\n\n       Each class member has a federal constitutional right, based upon the Due Process\n       Clause of the Fifth Amendment, to receive habilitative care and treatment in the\n       alternative least restrictive of individual liberty and to be kept free from harm.\n\n       Habilitation is the process by which a resident is assisted in acquiring and\n\n                                                 36\n\f       maintaining those life skills which enable him to cope more effectively with the\n       demands of his own person and of his environment and to raise the level of his\n       physical, mental, and social capabilities. Habilitation includes but is not limited\n       to[] programs of formal, structured education and training.\n\n       Habilitative care in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty means\n       living as normally as possible and receiving appropriate individualized services\n       in the community in the least separate, most integrated and least restrictive\n       settings.\n\n       As used in this Order, “integrated” refers to the integration of mentally retarded\n       persons with nonretarded persons in the community.\n\n(Id. (quoting 1978 Consent Order at 2 ¶ 3) (emphases added).) According to defendants, “[t]he\n\nportions of this definition emphasized above are not required by the Fifth Amendment’s due\n\nprocess clause but, rather, reach far beyond any constitutionally guaranteed minimum.” (Id. at\n\n16-17 n.13) Defendants maintain, for the first time in over 30 years, that they “cannot now be\n\nbound by their three-decades-old consent to the use of an overly expansive, erroneous\n\ndefinition.” (Id.) Rather, they argue, “this Court should disregard the 1978 Consent Order’s\n\nincorrect statement of the applicable standard and implement the correct standard, which the\n\nDistrict has more than satisfied.” (Id. at 17 n.13.)\n\n        It is well-established that a Court can modify or vacate a consent decree based on a\n\nsignificant change in law. In many cases where this type of argument has been raised, it is\n\nundisputed that the law has in fact changed, that a legal basis for the decree has evaporated, and\n\nthe only question for the Court is whether the change in the legal landscape warrants\n\nmodification (or vacatur) of the decree.

(Defs.’ Mot. at 14 n.2.) As explained herein, the answer to this question is\n\nsimply that defendants cannot argue for vacatur based on a significant change in the law.\n\n               1.      Youngberg\n\n       In Youngberg, the Supreme Court considered “for the first time the substantive rights of\n\n\n                                                 38\n\finvoluntarily committed mentally retarded persons under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n\nConstitution.” 457 U.S. at 314. The plaintiff in Youngberg, Nicholas Romeo, had been\n\ninvoluntarily committed under the laws of Pennsylvania to a state institution. As described in\n\nthe Supreme Court’s decision, he was “profoundly retarded,” with “the mental capacity of an 18-\n\nmonth old child, with an I.Q. between 8 and 10,” who could not “talk and lack[ed] the most basic\n\nself-care skills.” Id. at 309. He had been committed to a state facility at the age of 26 because\n\nhis mother could no longer care for him after his father’s death. After he suffered a number of\n\ninjuries, both self-inflicted and from other residents, his mother filed a complaint in federal\n\ndistrict court. The precise question before the Supreme Court was whether a person\n\ninvoluntarily committed to a state institution for the mentally retarded had “substantive rights\n\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to (I) safe conditions of\n\nconfinement; (ii) freedom from bodily restraints; and (iii) training, or ‘habilitation.’”25 Id. at\n\n309.\n\n        Based on its prior decisions, the Court concluded, without the need for explication, that\n\nthe plaintiff’s right to safe conditions and right to freedom from bodily restraint were the “core\n\nof the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause,” noting that since both rights survived\n\ncriminal conviction and incarceration, they certainly survived involuntary commitment. Id. at\n\n315-16 (quotations omitted). As for the right to habilitation, the Court had never before\n\n\n\n       25\n         It was conceded by the State of Pennsylvania that the plaintiff “ha[d] a right to adequate\nfood, shelter, clothing, and medical care,” so the Court limited its inquiry to the narrow question\nof “whether liberty interests also exist in safety, freedom of movement, and training.”\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 315 (emphasis added). As discussed infra, this fact is relevant because\nno matter how Youngberg is interpreted, it has no effect on a host of issues covered by the\nconsent decrees and the 2001 Plan. See infra pp. 55-58.\n\n                                                  39\n\fconsidered whether such a right existed or what its scope might be. Ultimately, it held that\n\nplaintiff had a right to the habilitation he sought – a right to “minimally adequate or reasonable\n\ntraining to ensure safety and freedom from undue restraint.” Id. at 319. In reaching this\n\nconclusion, the Court noted that because the plaintiff “seeks only training related to safety and\n\nfreedom from restraints, this case does not present the difficult question whether a mentally\n\nretarded person, involuntarily committed to a state institution, has some general constitutional\n\nright to training per se, even when no type or amount of training would lead to freedom.” Id. at\n\n318 (emphasis added). In a footnote, the Court added:\n\n       It is not feasible, as is evident from the variety of language and formulations in\n       the opinions below and the various briefs here, to define or identify the type of\n       training that may be required in every case. A court properly may start with the\n       generalization that there is a right to minimally adequate training. The basic\n       requirement of adequacy, in terms more familiar to courts, may be stated as that\n       training which is reasonable in light of identifiable liberty interests and the\n       circumstances of the case.\n\nId. at 319 n.25.\n\n       Having concluded that the plaintiff in Youngberg retained liberty interests in safety,\n\nfreedom from bodily restraint, and minimally adequate habilitation, the Court addressed the\n\nquestion of how a court should identify possible violations of those rights. It held that whether\n\nRomeo’s rights had been violated “must be determined by balancing his liberty interests against\n\nthe relevant state interests,” but that this balancing “cannot be left to the unguided discretion of a\n\njudge or jury.” Id. at 321. Rather, “the proper standard for determining whether a State\n\nadequately has protected the rights of the involuntarily committed mentally retarded” is for a\n\ncourt to “make certain that professional judgment was in fact exercised.” Id. (quotations\n\nomitted). Thus, the Court concluded, “the State [was] under a duty to provide respondent with\n\n\n                                                 40\n\fsuch training as an appropriate professional would consider reasonable to ensure his safety and\n\nto facilitate his ability to function free from bodily restraints.” Id. at 324.\n\n        In a concurring opinion, Justice Blackmun, joined by Justices Brennan and O’Connor,\n\nnoted that the majority opinion “properly leaves unresolved” “whether respondent has an\n\nindependent constitutional claim, grounded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, to that ‘habilitation’ or training necessary to preserve those basic self-care skills he\n\npossessed when he first entered” the state institution. Id. at 325, 327. Justice Blackmun opined\n\nthat “it would be consistent with the Court’s reasoning today to include within the minimally\n\nadequate training required by the Constitution such training as is reasonably necessary to prevent\n\na person’s pre-existing self-care skills from deteriorating because of his commitment.” Id. at\n\n327 (quotation and citation omitted). As explained by Justice Blackmun,\n\n        If a person could demonstrate that he entered a state institution with minimal self-\n        care skills, but lost those skills after commitment because of the State’s\n        unreasonable refusal to provide him training, then, it seems to me, he has alleged\n        a loss of liberty quite distinct from – and as serious as – the loss of safety and\n        freedom from unreasonable restraints. For many mentally retarded people, the\n        difference between the capacity to do things for themselves within an institution\n        and total dependence on the institution for all of their needs is as much liberty as\n        they ever will know.\n\nId. at 327.\n\n        Thus, contrary to defendants’ suggestion, there is absolutely nothing in the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Youngberg that overrules the 1978 Consent Order and the subsequent orders\n\nthat were entered both before and after Youngberg regarding plaintiffs’ constitutional right “to\n\nreceive habilitative care and treatment in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty” or\n\nthe definition of what that right means. Indeed, the Court in Youngberg expressly stated that it\n\nwas not answering the “difficult question whether a mentally retarded person, involuntarily\n\n                                                   41\n\fcommitted to a state institution, has some general constitutional right to training per se.” Id. at\n\n318.\n\n               2.      Post-Youngberg Cases\n\n       In the almost 30 years since Youngberg was decided, the Supreme Court has not revisited\n\nthe daunting task of explicating the constitutional rights of the involuntarily-committed\n\ndevelopmentally disabled, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\n\nCircuit has not had the occasion to ever address this issue. Thus, there is no controlling\n\nprecedent, other than Youngberg, and there is no consensus among the courts regarding\n\ndefendants’ proposed interpretation of Youngberg. On the contrary, courts and judges have\n\nreached differing conclusions about Youngberg’s scope.\n\n       For example, in Clark v. Cohen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"472164\"><a href=\"/opinion/472164/carolyn-clark-v-walter-s-cohen-individually-and-in-his-official-capacity/\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1986), the court held that plaintiff’s\n\nrights were violated where she was confined at an institution “in the face of unanimous\n\nprofessional opinion that she should be placed in a far less restrictive environment . . . .” Id at\n\n87. In a concurring opinion, Judge Edward Becker elaborated on his view of the scope of the\n\nconstitutional right to habilitation,26 which he believed Youngberg did not address. See id. at 92-\n\n98 (Becker, J., concurring). In his view, “Youngberg dealt exclusively with training related to\n\nphysical restraints; the Court expressly stated that it was neither considering nor ruling on any\n\nbroader right to habilitation.” Id. at 95. Citing Justice Blackmun’s concurrence in Youngberg,\n\nJudge Becker stated that he also “would endorse the non-deterioration principle,” because “[t]he\n\nmentally disabled cannot have meaningful autonomy, and hence meaningful liberty, without\n\n\n       26\n        The judge examined two possible theories of the right to habilitation – quid pro quo and\nparens patriae – and concluded that both apply to a person who has been involuntarily\ncommitted. Clark, 794 F.2d at 95.\n\n                                                 42\n\fbasic skills; therefore, for the state to allow disabled persons’ skills to deteriorate is as sure a\n\ndenial of their liberty as is their confinement to an institution.” Id. at 96. He then went further\n\nthan Justice Blackmun, endorsing what he called a “[m]odified non-deterioration principle”:\n\n        the State should be required to provide such a person with at least as much\n        training as would match the improvement that he or she would have experienced\n        if never committed. The reasoning behind this position is analogous to the\n        reasoning supporting the non-deterioration principle: by committing people and\n        preventing them from developing self-care skills, the state is effectively depriving\n        them of the opportunity to develop and exercise their autonomy. This is a\n        deprivation of their due process right to liberty. . . . [Thus,] involuntarily civilly\n        committed persons have a right to treatment sufficient to develop their self-care\n        skills to at least the level at which they would be if the persons had not been\n        institutionalized.\n\n794 F.2d at 96. As he explained:\n\n        Because [the plaintiff’s] institutionalization has led to her debilitation, the modified\n        non-deterioration principle requires the state to provide [her] . . . with training and\n        treatment sufficient to put her in the position in which she would have been had she\n        never been institutionalized. Because it appears from the numerous, uncontradicted\n        doctors’ reports in the record that placement in a [community living arrangement]\n        is the only or best way for [her] to receive the training she is due, I believe she has\n        a right to placement in the [community living arrangement], until she has acquired\n        the skills she would have had had she never been institutionalized.\n\nId. at 97. Finally, and significantly, Judge Becker’s opinion left open “the question whether the\n\ninvoluntarily civilly committed have a right to even greater habilitation than the modified non-\n\ndeterioration principle would allow.” Id. at 98. For example, as noted in the concurring opinion,\n\n        [i]t might be argued . . . under the theories discussed here or some other theory of\n        habilitation, that the involuntarily civilly committed have a right to as much\n        habilitation as their capacity will allow. Alternatively, one might argue that all\n        involuntarily civilly committed persons are entitled to treatment up to an absolute\n        level, regardless of their status upon entrance to the institution.\n\nId. at 98 (emphasis added). Thus, according to this circuit judge, Youngberg is merely the\n\nstarting point for defining the constitutional right to habilitation; it by no means precludes\n\n\n                                                   43\n\frecognition of additional rights for plaintiffs who, unlike the plaintiff in Youngberg, could\n\nbenefit from more extensive habilitation.\n\n       The court’s decision in Thomas S. v. Flaherty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1418955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1418955/thomas-s-by-brooks-v-flaherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Such developmental habilitation requires, inter alia; “[a]dequate involvement in\n\ncommunity activities,” defined as “being as involved as that individual is capable of being at the\n\ntime”; “a good interdisciplinary evaluation” that provides an “adequate assessment of the\n\nindividual needs of each class member”; “[p]roperly trained staff”; “[h]umane living conditions,”\n\nwhich includes more than “endless days of boredom without variation”; “treat[ment] in as\n\nnormal a setting as possible” featuring “access to ordinary activities,” and the chance “to learn\n\nand grow through observing and participating in the commonplace events of daily life,”\n\n“developmental training and structured programs,” including “training in basic self-care skills,\n\ncommunity living skills, speech therapy, and vocational services.” Id. at 1192-94. The court\n\nalso found that “[b]ecause vocational activities are often a key to greater independence and\n\nenjoyment of liberty, they are for most class members an essential service to avoid unnecessary\n\n\n       27\n          Although the Fourth Circuit stated that it rejected the idea that class members “had a\nright to treatment in the least restrictive environment,” Thomas S., 902 F. 2d at 253-54, it also\naffirmed the district court’s order which arguably could not exist absent such a right.\n\n                                                 44\n\frestraint.” Id. at 1194. The court relied on its finding that there was “professional consensus\n\nthat developmental, behavior-based treatment called ‘habilitation’ is the appropriate milieu for\n\npeople with mental retardation.” Id. at 1185. Finally, the court found that habilitation “is\n\ndefined as . . . [t]he process by which the staff of an agency assists an individual to acquire and\n\nmaintain those life skills that enable the individual to cope more effectively with the demands of\n\nhis or her own person and environmental and social functioning. Habilitation includes, but is not\n\nlimited to, programs of formal structured education and treatment.” Id. at 1184 (quoting\n\nAccreditation Council for Services for Mentally Retarded and Other Developmentally Disabled\n\nPersons (1981 ed.) (quotation and citation omitted)). Not only did the court recognize a broad\n\nright to habilitation, it emphasized that plaintiffs were entitled both to appropriate professional\n\ndecisionmaking and implementation of those decisions. See id. at 1185 (faulting defendants for\n\nnot implementing community placement recommendations by treating professionals and noting\n\nthat “[t]he record is replete with other examples of placement and treatment recommendations\n\nbeing ignored or their implementation being unjustifiably delayed”).28\n\n       Certainly there are cases in which courts applying Youngberg have defined the right to\n\nhabilitation more narrowly than the Court and the parties did in the 1978 Consent Order. For\n\nexample, in Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437629\"><a href=\"/opinion/437629/society-for-good-will-to-retarded-children-inc-russell-cohen-by-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir.\n\n1984), the Second Circuit held that the right to freedom from undue restraint included the right\n\n\n\n       28\n         The court in Thomas S. also found that “the conditions and services at the state\npsychiatric institutions are substantially below minimally accepted professional standard” in part\nbecause of “[i]nadequate treatment plans and inadequate documentation of their\nimplementation.” Id. at 1197. As discussed herein, the constitutional requirement that\nprofessional judgment be exercised in making decisions also requires that those decisions be\nimplemented. See infra pp. 61-62.\n\n                                                 45\n\fto be free from “excess locking of doors, locking of otherwise ambulatory persons into\n\nwheelchairs, and failing to put on leg braces for individuals who can walk with their assistance,”\n\nbut it did not include “visiting shops, restaurants and recreational facilities in the outside\n\ncommunity.” Id. at 1247. It also held that there was no “entitlement to community placement or\n\na ‘least restrictive environment’ under the federal Constitution,” and that “[w]here the state does\n\nnot provide treatment designed to improve a mentally retarded individual’s condition, it deprives\n\nthe individual of nothing guaranteed by the Constitution; it simply fails to grant a benefit of\n\noptimum treatment that it is under no constitutional obligation to grant.” Id. at 1250; see also\n\nLelsz v.

For example, in Association for\n\nRetarded Citizens of North Dakota v. Olson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D. 1982), aff’d, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"422282\"><a href=\"/opinion/422282/association-for-retarded-citizens-of-north-dakota-lindley-black-by-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(8th Cir. 1983), the court held that\n\n       the right to freedom from undue restraint . . . imposes a standard for the court’s\n       determination whether professional judgment is being exercised in the use of\n       medication and physical means to restrain residents. This right obligates the state\n       to provide capable retarded residents with reasonable opportunities to make trips\n       into the outside communities. It also tests the freedoms allowed to residents, such\n       as the opportunity to make small personal decisions concerning what to wear,\n       what to eat, recreation, etc. This right against unreasonable restraint also\n       involves the much discussed question of alternatives to institutionalization, such\n       as community homes. Prior to the Youngberg decision, this court held that the\n       [F]ourteenth [A]mendment secures a right to the least restrictive practicable\n       alternatives to institutionalization. While the Youngberg decision does not\n       directly address this specific right, the Court’s analysis indicates that it would\n       reject an absolute right to the least restrictive alternatives . . . . Following this\n       analysis, this court must conclude that a constitutional right to the least restrictive\n       method of care or treatment exists only insofar as professional judgment\n       determines that such alternatives would measurably enhance the resident’s\n       enjoyment of basic liberty interests.\n\nId. at 486 (emphasis added; citation omitted). As for “the right to minimally adequate training,”\n\nthe court held that “the resident possesses a right to training only insofar as that training serves to\n\nenhance or further that resident’s exercise of basic liberty.” Id. at 486-87. Thus, it does not\n\ninclude “training in music or vocational skills,” but it does include “training in walking or basic\n\ncommunication . . . if the resident could benefit therefrom . . . .” Id. at 487. It also includes “a\n\nright to reasonable training which enables the resident to acquire or maintain minimum self-care\n\nskills – skills in feeding, bathing, dressing, self-control, and toilet training.” Id. (emphasis\n\nomitted). The court also adopted Justice Blackmun’s view that the right to training includes\n\n\n                                                  47\n\ftraining “to enable them to maintain the minimum self-care skills that they possessed when they\n\nentered the institution,” and based on this view, it held that the “the acquisition and maintenance\n\nof those skills [are] essential to the exercise of basic liberties.” Id. at 487 (emphasis added).\n\n       Accordingly, all that can be said about the post-Youngberg cases, none of which is\n\ncontrolling precedent, is that they disagree about how narrowly Youngberg should be interpreted\n\nand even if interpreted narrowly, how it should be applied to everyday situations. This very lack\n\nof clarity dooms defendants’ suggestion that Youngberg precludes recognition of a constitutional\n\nright to habilitation as described in the 1978 Consent Order.\n\n       In the end, the critical question in a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether defendants have met\n\ntheir burden to show that Youngberg was a “significant change” in the law. They have not.\n\nThere is language in Youngberg that arguably contradicts defendants’ reading of the case; there\n\nis no subsequent Supreme Court decision or post-Youngberg decision from our circuit court\n\nregarding the meaning of Youngberg; and among those that have addressed it, there is no\n\nagreement. In the face of disagreement about what the law is and no controlling precedent, the\n\nmere fact that some courts have adopted the interpretation defendants propose here is not\n\nsufficient to meet that burden. Moreover, as explained herein, defendants’ position that\n\nYoungberg is a significant change in law is seriously undermined by the fact that for almost 28\n\nyears they have accepted the constitutional standard in the 1978 Consent Order and promised to\n\nachieve compliance with court orders based on that standard.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  48\n\f       B.      Defendants’ Argument Regarding Youngberg Was Not Made Within a\n               Reasonable Time\n\n       Defendants concede that if Youngberg is not treated as a significant change in law, their\n\nmotion to vacate must fail.29 But even if the Court agreed with defendants that Youngberg\n\nrepresented a significant change in the law, that does not ensure success under Rule 60(b)(5).30\n\nSee Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384. It remains for the Court to decide whether modification in light of\n\nthat change is warranted. See id. at 391. Given the particular (and probably unique) facts of this\n\ncase, the Court does not believe that the relief sought by defendants is warranted.\n\n       Rule 60(b)(5) requires that a motion for modification be made within “a reasonable\n\ntime.” Fed.

Defendants could\n\nhave sought modification of the 1978 Consent Order at any time thereafter based on the same\n\nargument they make today – that Youngberg effectively overruled parts of this Court’s 1978\n\nconsent decree, thereby requiring modification of that decree. And if there was any question that\n\na change in law could provide the basis for modification of a consent decree, that question was\n\nanswered in 1992 by Rufo. 502 U.S. at 393. Indeed, there have been a number of cases in the\n\nintervening years, which defendants rely upon, where parties have sought and courts have agreed\n\nthat modifications or vacatur based on a change in law was appropriate. See, e.g., Sweeton, 27\n\nF.3d at 1164-65; Evans, 10 F.3d at 480, 482-83; Briley, 511 F. Supp. 2d at 927.31\n\n       Nor is this a case where defendants can justify the delay by claiming that they were\n\n“unaware” of the existence of the decree or its impact. Cf. Briley, 511 F. Supp. 2d at 912\n\n(“Municipal entities, . . . however, do not have perfect institutional memory, and where a consent\n\n\n       31\n         Significantly, defendants cannot justify their delay by arguing that Horne is the change\nin law that they are relying on. In fact, defendants filed their motion even before Horne was\ndecided on June 25, 2009.\n\n                                                  50\n\fdecree has gone unenforced for many years, the individuals who administer those entities may\n\nnot have any knowledge of its existence.”). To the contrary, defendants have been in Court\n\ncontinually and repeatedly since the 1978 Consent Order defending against plaintiffs’ charges of\n\nnoncompliance, and when their efforts failed for good reason, numerous substantive court orders\n\nresulted.32\n\n        The only reason defendants give for their 27-year delay in making their Youngberg\n\nargument is that they only just realized that the 1978 Consent Order was based on a\n\n“misunderstanding of the governing law.” (See 12/17/09 Tr. at 8.) Even assuming such a\n\n“mistake” could ever justify a delay of this magnitude, it does not do so here. Defendants cannot\n\nmake a plausible argument that they, along with everyone else involved in this case, have been\n\noperating under a misguided view of the law and only now, with the arrival of a new Attorney\n\nGeneral, has the law become clear. (See 12/17/09 Tr. at 19.) Not only did it take 27 years for\n\ndefendants to realize their purported mistake, during that period, they entered into a number of\n\nadditional consent orders and agreements that were designed to achieve the constitutional\n\nstandards enunciated in the 1978 Consent Order. (See 1983 Consent Order; 1995 Reference\n\nOrder; 2001 Joint Findings of Fact; 2001 Plan; 2001 Consent Order; 2007 90-Day Consent\n\nOrder.) For example, in 1995 defendants “admit[ted] that the District has a continuing\n\nresponsibility to provide the class members with habilitation in accordance with their needs” and\n\n\n\n        32\n         (See, e.g., 1981 Consent Order; 1983 Consent Order; Jan. 1990 Contempt Order; Apr.\n1990 Contempt Order; Order Denying Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions, May 15, 1991;\n1995 Contempt Order; 1996 Order & Remedial Plan; 2001 Joint Findings of Fact, Consent\nOrder, Plan for Compliance; 2004 Coordination Order; 2007 Order and Opinion on Liability;\n2007 90-Day Consent Order; 2008 Special Masters’ Report re 90-Day Consent Order; 2009\nSpecial Masters’ Report.)\n\n                                                51\n\f“admit[ted] that they also are required to provide adequate medical care, psychological care, day\n\nprogramming, community residential placements and other support systems as set forth in the\n\nclass members’ [individual habilitation plans].” (1995 Contempt Order at 5-6.) And as recently\n\nas September 2007, the current administration under Mayor Fenty agreed to take a number of\n\nspecific actions, including “recruiting five new providers” and ensuring that the residences\n\noperated by these providers, inter alia, “are located close to shops, restaurants, community\n\nresources and public transportation, or there is transportation available to class members in order\n\nto access these resources” – an obligation that clearly flows from the parts of the 1978 Consent\n\nOrder the District now contends are “extraconstitutional.” (2007 90-Day Order at 2.) Moreover,\n\nthe Court’s March 2007 Liability Opinion and the 2009 Special Masters’ Report are replete with\n\nreferences to a legal standard that only now does the District find convenient to repudiate.\n\n“Modification of a consent decree may be warranted when changed factual conditions make\n\ncompliance with the decree substantially more onerous,” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384, but not simply\n\nbecause “it is no longer convenient to live with the terms of a consent decree.” Id. at 383.\n\n       Finally, and perhaps most importantly, defendants’ actions over the past 30 years – their\n\nrepeated representations, promises and agreements – have led the Court and the plaintiffs to\n\nbelieve that defendants had every intention of complying with the existing orders. For example,\n\nin asking the Court in February 2007 to delay its liability ruling, the District stated that it was\n\n“cognizant that much remains to be done to bring DDS into compliance with outstanding court\n\norders and the 2001 Plan,” but assured the Court that the “Fenty Administration is fully\n\ncommitted to the success of the new agency, the delivery of improved services and care to the\n\nconsumers served by the agency, and compliance with the 2001 Plan.” (Defs.’ Notice of Filing\n\n\n                                                  52\n\fof Supplemental Info. in Resp. to the Court Monitor’s Quarterly Report at 8, Feb. 5, 2007\n\n(emphasis added).) Again, in May 2008, Peter Nickles, the Attorney General for the District,\n\nassured the Court “I am not seeking . . . to take away what [the plaintiffs] won.” (Hr’g Tr. at 37,\n\nMay 15, 2008.) But that is exactly what the District seeks to do.\n\n       Everyone, including the three judges of this Court, who has struggled with this case for\n\nover 30 years has relied on defendants’ repeated promises that they intended to comply.\n\nPlaintiffs have repeatedly entered into new agreements with defendants. (See, e.g., 1981\n\nConsent Decree, 1983 Consent Decree; 2001 Consent Order; 2001 Plan; 2007 90-Day Consent\n\nOrder.) Plaintiff have also withdrawn motions to find defendants in noncompliance or in\n\ncontempt that they might otherwise have successfully pursued. (See, e.g., 1983 Consent Order at\n\n14 (withdrawing motion for contempt); Evans, 139 F. Supp. 2d at 84 (waiving “all claims for\n\npast contumacious conduct of defendants as of the date of the entry of the [2001] Consent Order\n\nand approval of the Settlement Agreement”).)\n\n       Moreover, the Court has on numerous occasions endorsed agreements between the\n\nparties and adopted them as court orders. (See, e.g., 1981 Consent Decree, 1983 Consent\n\nDecree; 2001 Consent Order; 2001 Plan; 2001 Joint Findings of Fact; 2007 90-Day Order.)\n\nJudge Stanley Harris’s reliance on defendants’ stated intention to achieve compliance with\n\nexisting court orders is especially apparent in his 2001 opinion, wherein he notes that “[t]he\n\ndispute seemed intractable until last year, towards the end of which there were commendable and\n\nextensive efforts by Mrs. Farrell, Mr. Sundram, and counsel for the parties seeking to resolve the\n\nproblems faced by all.” Evans, 139 F. Supp. 2d at 85. The Court commended the Special\n\nMasters and counsel not only for “resolving their differences, but for the exceptionally thorough\n\n\n                                                53\n\fmanner in which they have agreed upon procedures for dealing with the problems that have\n\npersisted for so long” and explained that it approved the Plan and adopted the parties’ consent\n\norder and settlement agreement because it “readily conclude[d] that the proposed compromise of\n\nthe controversy, which will be of substantially greater benefit to the class than would continued\n\nlitigation over how to deal with past conduct by defendants, is fair, reasonable, and adequate.”\n\nId.; (see also 1995 Contempt Order at 1 (emphasizing that “[a]n integral part of this litigation has\n\nbeen the closure of Forest Haven and the relocation of class members to community living\n\narrangements with adequate habilitation suitable to each class member” and “[t]o this end, the\n\nCourt has entered numerous orders, including consent orders between the parties, to safeguard\n\nthe rights of class members and ensure their adequate and appropriate habilitation.”).)\n\n       In sum, no factor supports a finding that defendants have filed their Rule 60(b)(5)\n\nmotion, to the extent it is based Youngberg, within a “reasonable time.” Defendants have no\n\nexcuse for their delay; they have repeatedly consented to the constitutional standard as stated in\n\nthe 1978 Consent Order; they successfully convinced the plaintiffs and the Court on numerous\n\noccasions that they intended to comply with the court orders; and the vulnerable class members,\n\ntheir counsel, the Department of Justice and three judges of this Court have relied to their\n\ndetriment on the District’s endless promises.\n\n       C.      At Most, Defendants’ View of Youngberg Supports Only a Limited\n               Modification of the Consent Orders\n\n       Even if defendants could argue that Youngberg was a significant change in the law\n\n(which they cannot), that argument would support nothing more than a limited modification of\n\nthe consent orders. In the first place, even if Youngberg changed the law with respect to the\n\nscope of the constitutional right to habilitation, that would not undermine the legal basis for the\n\n                                                 54\n\fhost of provisions in the court orders and the 2001 Plan that relate solely to health care and\n\nsafety. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16 (not disputed that plaintiff had “a right to adequate\n\nfood, shelter, clothing, and medical care” and Court held that right to safe conditions and right to\n\nfreedom from bodily restraint were the “core of the liberty protected by the Due Process\n\nClause”). Requirements relating to these rights (as opposed to habilitation) are a substantial part\n\nof the challenged court orders and the 2001 Plan. (See 1978 Consent Order; Evans, 459 F. Supp.\n\nat 484, 488-89; 1981 Consent Order at 6-7; 1983 Consent Order at 4-8; 2001 Consent Order;\n\n2001 Plan; 2007 90-Day Consent Order.) Moreover, these provisions are arguably the most\n\ncritical and cover areas where defendants have been most deficient. Certainly, in recent years,\n\nhealth and safety have been the primary focus and concern of the Court, the Special Masters, the\n\nCourt Monitor and the parties. See Evans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 298-314 (factual findings in March\n\n2007 Liability Opinion regarding health and safety); (2007 90-Day Order (addressing two\n\ncritical goals: increasing the number of qualified providers and improving the health and safety\n\nof class members); 2009 Special Masters’ Report at 18-67 (findings and conclusions of law\n\nregarding health care, mental and behavioral health care, guardianship, safety and protection\n\nfrom harm); Court Monitor’s Report, June 11, 2009; and Court Monitor’s Report, Dec. 10,\n\n2009.)\n\n         For example, according to the 2001 Plan, the crux of plaintiffs’ right to be kept free from\n\nharm is addressed by six specific directives in the 1978 Consent Order and the 1983 Consent\n\nOrder. (2001 Plan at 27-28). These directives\n\n         require conducting timely and thorough investigations into serious incidents,\n         including deaths; identifying causes and contributory factors as well as preventive\n         and corrective actions that appear to be warranted; and ensuring the\n         implementation of recommendations that are made as a result of the\n\n                                                 55\n\f       investigations. In addition to responding to individual cases, the defendants are\n       required to identify systemic patterns and trends and communicate them to\n       providers to facilitate corrective action for recurrent problems on an individual\n       consumer level, provider level and a systemic level. . . . [and to] ensure that\n       appropriate training programs for all staff, including staff assigned to residential\n       settings are developed and implemented.\n\n(2009 Special Masters’ Report at 50.) In March 2007, this Court found “defendants ha[d] failed\n\nin many significant respects to accomplish the tasks and outcome criteria associated with the\n\nCourt’s Orders relating to class member safety and to comply with the terms of the Orders\n\nthemselves.” Evans, 480 F. Supp. 2d at 313. In late November 2007, defendants conceded that\n\nas of yet, conditions had not fundamentally changed. (Def.’s Notice Concerning Proposed\n\nComprehensive Monitoring at 2.) And, as of December 2008, the Special Masters found that\n\n“there is clear and convincing evidence that the problems being experienced by class members in\n\nthe area of safety and protection from harm are continuing, serious and systemic.” (2009 Special\n\nMasters’ Report at 67). Thus, no matter how Youngberg is interpreted, it would not excuse\n\ndefendants from these obligations.\n\n       Moreover, even if defendants’ overly narrow interpretation of Youngberg were to be\n\nadopted, it would only entitle defendants to partial modification of the court orders concerning\n\nhabilitation. For example, as the 2007 Liability Opinion makes clear, the right to receive\n\nhabilitative care and treatment in the alternative least restrictive of individual liberty, see Evans,\n\n480 F. Supp. 2d at 314-19, is only one aspect of plaintiffs’ right to habilitation/welfare.\n\nPlaintiffs are also entitled to “a written ISP based upon individualized assessments and\n\nformulated in accordance with professional standards”; “an individualized habilitation program\n\ndesigned in accordance with the ISP”; identification in the ISP of “all services and supports\n\nrequired by class members regardless of availability”; annual review of the ISP; “adaptive\n\n                                                  56\n\fequipment” if needed; “enough case manager positions to meet the required case manager to\n\nclient ratio”; “appropriate training programs for staff, including case managers”; and case\n\nmanagers who ensure implementation of ISPs and take appropriate action after incidents. See id\n\nat 319, 321-22; (see also 2009 Special Masters’ Report at 67-75 (same)). Similarly, in the six-\n\npage, single-spaced 2007 90-Day Consent Order (which defendants agreed to after the Fenty\n\nadministration took office), the only provision arguably affected by Youngberg would be the\n\nrequirement that defendants ensure that residences operated by new providers “are located close\n\nto shops, restaurants, community resources and public transportation, or there is transportation\n\navailable to class members in order to access these resources.” (2007 90-Day Consent Order at\n\n2.)\n\n       Finally, one of defendants’ primary points about Youngberg is that it rejects any right to\n\ncommunity placement, but the present record establishes that plaintiffs failed to prove that\n\ndefendants are in noncompliance with the 2001 Plan with respect to moving a significant number\n\nof class members into group homes. (See 2009 Special Masters’ Report at 72.)33 For those class\n\n\n       33\n            As described in the 2009 Special Masters’ Report:\n\n       The unchallenged testimony of defendants’ witness, Laura Nuss, is that there have\n       been 250 placements into less restrictive environments. Defendants have moved\n       a significant number of class members to apartments and group homes. The\n       evidence during the liability phase of this action was that 55% of class members\n       resided in ICFs/MR (366 of 659 class members, 480 F. Supp 2d at 315 n.43.)\n       That number is down to a little over 250 class members (approximately 40% of\n       the class), and defendants reasonably expect to accelerate that movement with the\n       further development of the community-based waiver and the Money Follows The\n       Person Grant, which is expected to further reduce the utilization of ICFs/MR by\n       60% (Nuss Trial Tr. 275:18-21). Based on these findings of fact, the Special\n       Masters find that plaintiffs have not sustained their burden of proving by clear\n       and convincing evidence non-compliance with court orders requiring residential\n       placements in less restrictive settings.\n\n                                                 57\n\fmembers who continue to reside in ICF/MR settings, the Report noted that “there was no\n\nevidence submitted to establish that continued placement of all or some subset of these class\n\nmembers in such settings was improper or contrary to a choice made by the class member or an\n\nauthorized surrogate decision-maker.” (Id. at 73.)\n\n        In the end, then, defendants’ argument that Youngberg changed the law on habilitation\n\nwould, at most, require partial modification of a limited number of court orders concerning\n\nhabilitation; it would not affect the legitimacy of any other order, including many critical orders,\n\nconcerning plaintiffs’ health, welfare and safety. But defendants do not seek such a limited\n\nmodification; rather they make an “all or nothing” argument for vacatur.34\n\n\n\n\n(Id. at 72.)\n        34\n          (See 12/17/2009 Tr. at 22 (“Your Honor, I do not think there is a middle ground.”); id at\n24 (“modification as to the plan would be something that would almost be a futile act”).) In\ndefendants’ brief, they state that if the Court rejects this option, “[i]n the alternative, the Court\nshould at the very least modify the orders currently in force, to eliminate any provisions that are\nnot reasonably necessary to remedy a current and ongoing constitutional violation.” (Defs.’\nMem. at 7.) However, if defendants want a modification, it is their burden to show the Court\nthat the modification is narrowly tailored to the change in circumstances. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383\n(“[A] party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the burden of establishing that a\nsignificant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree. If the moving party meets\nthis standard, the court should consider whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to\nthe changed circumstance.”). Defendants have made no effort to offer a modification suitably\ntailored to the arguably changed circumstances. (See 12/17/09 Tr. at 39 (“Your Honor, in all\ncandor, if you do not vacate the orders, we would have to look at them anew and see if any – if –\nwhat modifications could be made to them that are realistic.”)); see also See LaShawn v. Fenty,\nNo. 89-CV-1754, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1270202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *21 (D.D.C. Apr. 5, 2010) (defendants similarly did not\n“propose[] a modification tailored to the alleged changed circumstances” leaving the court\nwithout “an adequate proposal to consider”). Moreover, they have steadfastly refused to invoke\nthe procedures provided for by the 2001 Plan (see 2001 Plan at 6-10) or under Rule 60(b)(5) for\nmodification or termination of orders that have been achieved or those that are no longer relevant\nor obtainable.\n\n                                                 58\n\fII.    DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO VACATUR BASED ON CHANGE IN\n       FACTS\n\n       A.      Defendants Are Not in Substantial Compliance with Constitutional\n               Requirements\n\n       Defendants argue that, even though they have not achieved compliance with the court\n\norders or the 2001 Plan, the objects of those orders have been attained because defendants have\n\nsatisfied the “constitutional minimum.” (Defs.’ Mem. at 32 (“District’s current system for\n\nserving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities . . . patently satisfies class\n\nmembers’ Fifth . . . Amendment rights to be free from harm and to receive minimally adequate\n\nhabilitative care and treatment.”).) Defendants’ argument fails because (1) it rests on a flawed\n\ndefinition of the constitutional minimum; and (2) its rests on an erroneous interpretation of\n\nHorne as allowing properly entered consent orders to be vacated, despite defendants’ non-\n\ncompliance with those orders, once defendants achieve the constitutional minimum.\n\n               1.      Defendants Cannot Provide a Workable Definition of Constitutional\n                       Requirements Based on Youngberg\n\n       Defendants’ argument that they have satisfied the “constitutional minimum” requires that\n\nthat concept be defined, but defendants’ proffered definition is fundamentally flawed.\n\nAccording to defendants, Youngberg establishes as the constitutional minimum that involuntarily\n\ncommitted individuals have only the right to be kept “free from harm” and the right to\n\n“minimally adequate habilitation,” defined as “such training as may be reasonable in light of [the\n\nindividual’s] liberty interests in safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints.” (Def. Mot. to\n\nVacate at 16 (quotations omitted) (quoting Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 322). Defendants then baldly\n\nassert that they have met this constitutional minimum because “[w]e’re exercising professional\n\njudgment in the care and treatment of consumers within the class. They’re free from harm. And\n\n                                                  59\n\fthey’re getting sufficient training and habilitation so that their liberty interests are protected.”\n\n(12/17/09 Tr. at 104.)\n\n        Although the constitutional minimum certainly includes the rights articulated in\n\nYoungberg, defendants’ argument that no more is required is premised on an error of law. First,\n\nas noted, Youngberg did not concern an involuntarily committed person’s constitutional right to\n\n“food, shelter, clothing, and medical care.” Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315. It is indisputable that\n\nany constitutional minimum standard must include protection of these rights.35 Moreover, as\n\nthese rights were not at issue in Youngberg, Youngberg provides no guidance as to what is\n\nrequired to meet the constitutional minimum with respect to the protection of these rights.\n\n        In addition, to the extent defendants contend that the constitutional minimum is met as\n\nlong as there is a system in place that calls for the exercise of professional judgment (see\n\n12/17/09 Tr. at 103;36 Defs.’ Mem. at 33 (“no credible argument can be made that there is a\n\nsystemic lack of professional judgment exercised by treating professionals in the IDD system”)),\n\n\n        35\n          When asked to explain what a minimal right to medical care encompasses, defense\ncounsel suggested that plaintiffs’ right to medical care was limited to the “health implications” of\nthe “very minimal” “duty to keep them safe and free from unreasonable restraints.” (12/17/09\nTr. at 100.) As an example of what might be covered, defense counsel suggested “if a person\nneeds certain treatment so that they can be free from unreasonable restraints, yes, that is part of\nwhat Youngberg dictates.” (Id.) Or, if a person has a tumor, there may be a some duty to act if\nthe person “may not be safe, depending on the invasiveness of the tumor.” (Id. at 101.) Not only\nis it incomprehensible that an involuntarily committed developmentally disabled person is not\nentitled to more than counsel’s meaningless and inadequate level of care, but counsel’s inability\nto provide any workable definition illustrates the inherent difficulty prescribing in the abstract\nwhat services are required so that a constitutionally protected right will be something more than\na hollow promise.\n        36\n         During oral argument, the Court asked defense counsel whether it mattered if “the\nhealthcare provider’s recommendations as to the class members are not implemented in a timely\nmanner,” to which counsel responded, “I don’t think Youngberg speaks to the timeliness of the\nmatter.” (12/17/09 Tr. at 103.)\n\n                                                  60\n\fthat proposition is not supported by Youngberg. Youngberg expressly states that a court must\n\n“make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised” in attempting to protect the\n\nrights of an involuntarily committed individual. 457 U.S. at 321 (emphasis added) (quotation\n\nomitted). As other courts have recognized, in order for this requirement to have any substance, it\n\ncannot be met purely at the systemic level; rather, professional judgments must be implemented\n\nin a timely fashion. See, e.g., Thomas S., 902 F.2d at 252 (holding that district court properly\n\nimposed liability because it “found that many of the decisions of the treating professionals had\n\nnot been implemented” and “found areas in which the decisions of the treating professional\n\nsubstantially departed from accepted standards”); Haldeman v.

See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 318 (because plaintiff “seeks only training\n\nrelated to safety and freedom from restraints, this case does not present the difficult question\n\nwhether a mentally retarded person, involuntarily committed to a state institution, has some\n\ngeneral constitutional right to training per se” (emphasis added)). For all these reasons, the\n\nrights recognized by Youngberg are necessary, but not sufficient, to give meaning to plaintiffs’\n\n\n                                                 61\n\fbasic constitutional rights.\n\n               2.      Even If Defendants Have Satisfied Minimum Constitutional\n                       Requirements, This Does Not Justify Vacatur Under Horne\n\n       The second problem for defendants is that they cannot seek vacatur of all court orders\n\nbased on Horne. In Horne, the district court concluded, after a trial, that the State of Arizona\n\nwas violating the requirement in the Equal Educational Opportunities Act (“EEOA”) “to take\n\nappropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students\n\nin its instructional programs,” 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f), because “the amount of funding the State\n\nallocated for the special needs of ELL students . . . was arbitrary and not related to the actual\n\nfunding needed to cover the costs of ELL instruction.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2589. Pursuant to\n\nthis judgment, the court ordered the State, inter alia, to “prepare a cost study to establish the\n\nproper appropriation to effectively implement ELL programs,” “to provide funding that bears a\n\nrational relationship to the actual funding needed,” and to “appropriately and constitutionally\n\nfund” the ELL program. Id. at 2590 (quotations and citations omitted).\n\n       The defendants never complied with any of the court’s orders, but in 2006 the State\n\nLegislature passed a new law that “increased ELL incremental funding [by a fixed amount] (with\n\na 2-year per-student limit on such funding) and created two new funds – a structured English\n\nimmersion fund and a compensatory instruction fund – to cover additional costs of ELL\n\nprogramming.” Id. at 2590. Based on this new legislation, the state legislature asked the district\n\ncourt to vacate its orders. The district court concluded that Rule 60(b)(5) relief was not\n\nwarranted because the new law “did not establish a funding system that rationally relates funding\n\navailable to the actual costs of all elements of ELL instruction.” Id. at 2591 (quotations\n\nomitted). The Ninth Circuit affirmed, emphasizing that because the original declaratory\n\n                                                 62\n\fjudgment order centered on the adequacy of ELL incremental funding, relief would be\n\nappropriate only if “there are no longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs in\n\nArizona,” or if “Arizona had altered its funding model.” Id. at 2591-92 (quotations omitted).\n\n       The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, holding that the lower courts had erred by\n\nlooking only to whether the State was fulfilling the specific terms of the judgment instead of\n\nconsidering whether “Arizona is now fulfilling its statutory obligation by new means that reflect\n\nnew policy insights and other changed circumstances.” Id. at 2589. The Court remanded the\n\ncase with instructions to consider “whether the objective of the District Court’s 2000 declaratory\n\njudgment order – i.e. satisfaction of the EEOA’s appropriate action standard – has been\n\nachieved.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2595 (quotations omitted).\n\n       Under Horne and earlier Supreme Court decisions, a motion to vacate, such as defendants\n\nhave filed here, requires the Court to determine whether the “objective” of the court orders has\n\nbeen attained. Id.; Frew, 540 U.S. at 442 (“The federal court must exercise its equitable powers\n\nto ensure that when the objects of the decree have been attained, responsibility for discharging\n\nthe State’s obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials.”); see also LaShawn,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1270202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11 (in addressing motion to vacate consent decree, “it is appropriate to\n\nconsider whether the objectives of the decree have been achieved”).\n\n       Defendants attempt, nevertheless, to read Horne as a new rule of law that equates\n\nsatisfying the constitutional minimum with attaining the objective of a consent decree. (See\n\nDefs.’ Mem. at 18 (no ongoing constitutional violations because the “current IDD system\n\nadministered by DDS/DDA . . . not only satisfies but greatly surpasses the minimum\n\nconstitutional standards established by the Fifth Amendment.” ); 12/17/09 Tr. at 10-11, 13, 16,\n\n\n                                                 63\n\f42, 48.) This Court cannot accept this exceedingly broad interpretation of Horne, for Horne\n\ncannot mean that when a defendant agrees to a series of measures designed to remedy\n\nconstitutional violations, these agreements are necessarily unenforceable because the measures\n\nexceed some ill-defined constitutional floor.\n\n       Unlike Horne, the present case involves a consent decree, not a litigated judgment. A\n\nconsent decree “‘embodies an agreement of the parties’ and is also ‘an agreement that the parties\n\ndesire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to\n\nthe rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees.’” Frew, 540 U.S. at 437 (quoting\n\nRufo, 502 U.S. at 378). “[A] federal consent decree must spring from, and serve to resolve, a\n\ndispute within the court’s subject-matter jurisdiction; must come within the general scope of the\n\ncase made by the pleadings; and must further the objectives of the law upon which the complaint\n\nwas based.” Id. (citing Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 525). “Consent decrees entered in federal court\n\nmust be directed to protecting federal interests.” Id.; see also LaShawn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1270202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n*13.\n\n       The decision in Horne was obviously motivated by the perceived dangers of long-term\n\njudicial involvement in local government institutions, noting that “Rule 60(b)(5) serves a\n\nparticularly important function in . . . ‘institutional reform litigation’” because “injunctions\n\nissued in such cases often remain in force for many years, and the passage of time frequently\n\nbrings about changed circumstances – changes . . . in governing law . . . and new policy insights\n\n– that warrant reexamination of the original judgment.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2593. The Court\n\nin Horne also noted that “institutional reform injunctions often raise sensitive federalism\n\nconcerns,” particularly where they “involve[] areas of core state responsibility” or “ha[ve] the\n\n\n                                                 64\n\feffect of dictating state or local budget priorities.” Id. at 2593-94. And in dicta it suggests that\n\nthese problems are exacerbated in cases governed by consent decrees rather than litigated\n\njudgments because consent decrees often “go well beyond what is required” by law, and\n\n“thereby ‘improperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and executive\n\npowers.’” Id. at 2594 (quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 441).\n\n       But in Horne, the Supreme Court also endorsed and cited its prior decisions in Rufo and\n\nFrew – decisions approving the use of consent decrees in institutional reform cases.

Indeed, that is one reason why consent decrees are a valuable tool\n\nfor resolving such cases. See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383 (noting that if plaintiffs enter into a consent\n\n\n       38\n          Even without consent, a court may impose a remedy that goes beyond ordering\ndefendants to satisfy the constitutional floor. Federal court decrees “exceed appropriate limits if\nthey are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate the Constitution or does not flow\nfrom such a violation,” Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282, but “where . . . a constitutional violation has\nbeen found, the remedy does not ‘exceed’ the violation if the remedy is tailored to cure the\ncondition that offends the Constitution.” Id. (quotation omitted). For example, in Milliken,\n“[t]he ‘condition’ offending the Constitution is Detroit’s de jure segregated school system, which\nwas so pervasively and persistently segregated that the District Court found that the need for the\neducational components flowed directly from constitutional violations by both state and local\nofficials. These specific educational remedies, although normally left to the discretion of the\nelected school board and professional educators, were deemed necessary to restore the victims of\ndiscriminatory conduct to the position they would have enjoyed in terms of education had these\nfour components been provided in a nondiscriminatory manner in a school system free from\npervasive de jure racial segregation.” Id.\n\n        Significantly, this same principle was adopted in Horne, where the Court recognized that\nfederal court decrees are not limited to the constitutional floor in awarding relief for a violation\nof law. Rather, federal court decrees do not “exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at\neliminating a condition that . . . flow[s] from such a violation.” See Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2495.\n\n                                                 66\n\fdecree “[a]t least they will avoid further litigation and perhaps will negotiate a decree providing\n\nmore than what would have been ordered without the local government’s consent”); Local No.\n\n93, 478 U.S. at 522 (“Consent decrees are entered into by parties to a case after careful\n\nnegotiation has produced agreement on their precise terms. The parties waive their right to\n\nlitigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable\n\nrisk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in\n\nexchange for the saving of cost and elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they\n\nmight have won had they proceeded with the litigation.” (quoting United States v.

A consent decree “‘embodies an agreement of the parties’ and is also\n\n‘an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a\n\njudicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees.’”\n\nSee Frew, 540 U.S. at 437 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 378.) “Federal courts are not reduced to\n\napproving consent decrees and hoping for compliance. Once entered, a consent decree may be\n\nenforced.” Id. at 440.39\n\n\n       39\n            As noted by the Supreme Court in Local No. 93:\n\n       Parties may choose to settle their disputes by consent decree rather than by\n       private contract for a number of reasons. As one commentator points out, [p]ublic\n       law settlements are often complicated documents designed to be carried out over\n       a period of years, . . . so any purely out-of-court settlement would suffer the\n       decisive handicap of not being subject to continuing oversight and interpretation\n       by the court. . . . A consent decree has several other advantages as a means of\n       settling litigation. It is easier to obtain enforcement of a consent decree because it\n       will be unnecessary to prove many facts that would otherwise have to be shown in\n       order to establish the validity of an ordinary contract. A court that maintains\n\n                                                67\n\f       Because Horne did not involve a consent decree, it had no occasion to address\n\ndefendants’ claim that all they have to do is satisfy the constitutional minimum as opposed to\n\nprovisions of a consent decree that arguably exceed the minimum but were agreed to by the\n\nparties to cure conditions that flow from constitutional violations. But this very claim was\n\naddressed and rejected in Rufo. There, the Supreme Court made clear that where there is a\n\nconsent decree in place, the legally enforceable obligations are “not confined to meeting minimal\n\nconstitutional requirements.” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 390. Moreover, “[a] proposed modification\n\nshould not strive to rewrite a consent decree so that it conforms to the constitutional floor,” Rufo,\n\n502 U.S. at 391, and a party cannot “require a court to retrace old legal ground, say, by\n\nre-making or rejustifying its original ‘constitutional decision every time an effort [is] made to\n\nenforce or modify’” an order. Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2619 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 389-390,\n\n392); see also LaShawn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1270202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11-*13.\n\n       Despite this binding precedent, defendants cite to a number of cases decided since Horne\n\nwhere courts have vacated consent decrees. (See Defs.’ Reply at 6 & n.9; Defs.’ Notice of\n\nSupplemental Authority, Dec. 9, 2009; Defs.’ Notice of Supplemental Authority, Mar. 30, 2010).\n\nHowever, none of the cited cases is analogous to our case, for, in each of them, there were\n\ncompelling circumstances that supported the termination of the consent decree that are not\n\n\n\n\n       continuing jurisdiction over a consent decree will have a more flexible repertoire\n       of enforcement measures. And it is likely to be easier to channel litigation\n       concerning the validity and implications of a consent decree into a single\n       forum-the court that entered the decree-thus avoiding the waste of resources and\n       the risk of inconsistent or conflicting obligations. . . .

Id. at 654, 660-\n\n62. Similarly, in Consumer Advisory Board v.

Not only was Cleveland Fire\n\nFighters in a different procedural posture because movants were seeking to extend a decree past\n\nan already established termination date, but unlike Cleveland Fire Fighters, the record before the\n\nCourt does not support a finding that defendants have “extended [their] best efforts” to satisfy\n\nthe obligations in the consent orders or that there are “circumstances beyond its control” that\n\nhave caused it to fall short.42 To the contrary, defendants freely admit that they are determined to\n\nseek vacatur and not compliance.43\n\n\n       42\n          While defendants refer to the obligations imposed on the District as having become ever\nmore “exacting and onerous” (Defs.’ Mot. to Vacate at 2), it is unclear whether defendants argue\nthat any circumstance or obstacle makes the decree “unworkable” or “substantially more\nonerous.” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384; see also NLRB v. Harris Teeter Supermarkets, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185196\"><a href=\"/opinion/185196/nlrb-v-harris-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36\n(D.C.

But of course, Rufo teaches that “[i]nternal\ncompliance mechanisms instituted to effectuate the decree . . . and hurdles inherent in a consent\ndecree’s entry do not count as ‘obstacles.’” Harris Teeter Supermarkets, 215 F.3d at 35-36\n(citing Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391). Moreover, other than a reference to the District’s financial\nsituation (see infra note 43), defendants, as in LaShawn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1270202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *14, provide no\nsubstance to their conclusory claim that the consent decrees and 2001 Plan should be viewed as\n“exacting and onerous.”\n       43\n         Defendants also argue in passing that the Court must take account of the District’s dire\neconomic climate and budget shortfall of $583.5 million.

For example, in\n\nBoard of Education v. Dowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991), the Supreme Court remanded with\n\ninstructions to the district court to decide “whether the [defendant] had complied in good faith\n\nwith the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past\n\n\n\n\nto be relieved of the costs associated with the Special Masters, the Court Monitor, the Quality\nTrust, and the attorneys’ fees incurred in litigating this case. (Id. at 55.) While “[f]inancial\nconstraints may not be used to justify the creation or perpetuation of constitutional violations, . .\n. they are a legitimate concern of government defendants in institutional reform litigation and\ntherefore are appropriately considered in tailoring a consent decree modification.” Rufo, 502\nU.S. at 592-93. However, in this case, as in LaShawn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1270202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *14, defendants\nhave failed to demonstrate that financial circumstances warrant modification.\n\n        Most importantly, the District’s lengthy history of intransigence and noncompliance have\nbeen the major factors in the increased need for monitoring, reliance on Special Masters, and the\nlarge costs and fees incurred by plaintiffs and their counsel. Second, the funding of the Quality\nTrust has almost been completed and is arguably not within the Court’s power to modify; the\nresponsibilities of the Special Masters have declined; and the Monitor returned over $180,000 of\nher budget in an effort to reduce costs. (12/17/09 Tr. at 115.) Third, this litigation has actually\nresulted in cost savings for the District, since as a result of the efforts of the Court, the plaintiffs,\nand the Special Masters, many class members and DDA customers have been put on the waiver,\nthereby shifting costs from the District to the federal government. (Id. at 27-28.) This effort,\nwhile now reaching fruition (see supra pp. 57-58), was started long before this administration\nand thus can hardly be credited only to the efforts of the current leadership. Fourth, as Judge\nHogan held, the costs of monitoring are not properly considered to be obstacles.

These consent orders are what gives content to otherwise vague rights and\n\nsubstance to a remedy when those rights are violated.44 Moreover, as the Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized, consent decrees are a valuable tool for resolving litigation – with benefits to\n\nplaintiffs, defendants and the courts. But if the Court were to permit defendants to walk away\n\nfrom their obligations under the consent orders simply because there is a new administration that\n\nbelieves that all it needs to do is achieve the constitutional floor (whatever that means), that\n\nwould mean that there would be no future consent decrees involving governmental entities.\n\nPlaintiffs would have no incentive to enter into consent decrees if the next administration could\n\nattack a prior administration’s agreement by saying it promised more than was required. And,\n\ncourts would be unlikely to approve a consent decree if each new administration could force a\n\nretrial based on a claim that the constitutional floor has now been met. While Horne may have\n\nprovided parameters for court involvement in institutional reform litigation and consent decrees,\n\nit did not declare their demise. In light of the continued vitality of Rufo and Frew, and as long as\n\nthe obligations voluntarily assumed by defendants flow from constitutional violations, this Court\n\nmay not rewrite the existing consent orders so as to reduce defendants’ promise to some ill-\n\ndefined constitutional floor. See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391; LaShawn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1270202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *21.\n\nAccordingly, as defendants concede they are not in compliance with the court orders, they have\n\nnot satisfied Horne’s first requirement of showing that the object of the consent orders has been\n\n\n       44\n          (See Pls.’ Opp’n, Ex. 27 (charting flow of orders, starting with the rights recognized in\nthe 1978 Consent Order and then identifying the remedial actions defendants were ordered to\ntake to remedy the violations of those rights).)\n\n                                                 74\n\fattained.\n\n       B.

Ct. at 2595. What it means to have a “durable remedy”\n\nis a question that Horne does not answer, but at a minimum, a “durable” remedy means a remedy\n\nthat gives the Court confidence that defendants will not resume their violations of plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional rights once judicial oversight ends. See LaShawn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1270202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *21;\n\nHarvey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5792159</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11 (suggesting that a “durable remedy” is the equivalent of\n\nhaving in place “a mechanism for future compliance”). Whether there is a durable remedy thus\n\nnecessarily depends on the actual impacts or outcomes experienced by the plaintiffs. The Court\n\nhas to be persuaded that defendants are no longer violating plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and\n\nthat they will “not return to [their] former ways.” Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247-48. As was the case\n\nin LaShawn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1270202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *22, defendants ask the Court to conclude that it has a\n\ndurable remedy in place because it has implemented permanent structural changes and will\n\nremain subject to extensive monitoring even without judicial involvement.\n\n               1.      Permanent Structural Changes\n\n       Defendants focus on the following permanent structural changes: (1) the establishment\n\nof the Department on Disability Services (“DDS”) as a cabinet-level department with\n\nindependent personnel and procurement authority;45 (2) the creation of the Department of Health\n\n\n       45\n          Defendants also refer to the fact that “the District has recruited high-quality and\ndedicated leadership for the new agency” (Defs.’ Mem. at 38), which is clearly an important\ndevelopment in this case given the often inadequate and transitory nature of management over\nthe last 30 years. However, as defense counsel conceded during argument, a “durable” remedy\ncannot depend on the retention of particular personnel. (12/17/09 Tr. at 29 (“I don’t think it does\n\n                                                75\n\fCare Finance (“DHCF”) as an independent, cabinet-level agency that functions as the single-\n\nstate Medicaid agency with two (to increase to four) staff dedicated to persons with\n\ndevelopmental disabilities; (3) increased interagency cooperation between DDS/DDA and\n\nDHCF, including routine weekly telephone calls, staff co-location and extensive collaboration on\n\na number of ongoing projects; (4) increased interagency collaboration between DDS/DDA and\n\nthe Health Regulation and Licensing Administration (“HRLA”), including sharing findings and\n\nconducting joint investigations; and (5) the establishment in July 2009 of a Task Force including\n\nrepresentatives from DDS/DDA, DHCF, and HRLA to advise the Mayor regarding all services\n\nfor individuals with developmental disabilities. (Defs.’ Mem. at 37-43.)\n\n       These structural changes are all extremely positive developments, but they do not\n\nnecessarily translate into proof of a durable remedy.46 All of the changes have occurred within\n\nthe past year or two, and, especially in view of the fact that this litigation has spanned over 30\n\nyears and still defendants achieved compliance, it is simply too soon to tell whether they will\n\nresult in improved outcomes for the plaintiffs, and, if so, whether the improvements will be\n\nsustained absent judicial involvement. Even defendants admit that systemic change can take\n\nthree to five years.47 (Defs.’ Mem.’ at 70; Defs.’ Mem., Ex. 16, Expert Report of Nancy Thaler,\n\n\ndepend on Ms. Nuss staying, although we certainly want Ms. Nuss to stay”).) Indeed,\ndefendants’ recent filing suggests that if the Court imposes the remedy recommended in the 2009\nSpecial Masters’ Report, Ms. Nuss will decline to remain in her job. (See Defs.’ Mem. re\nAlternate Remedy at 3-8.)\n       46\n         Similar arguments were raised by the District and rejected by LaShawn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1270202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *13-*14 and by the D.C. Circuit in Harris Teeter, 215 F.3d at 36, where the Court\nrefused to terminate a consent decree even though defendant had instituted personnel changes\nand an internal reorganization.\n       47\n            Even in their latest filing, defendants acknowledges that there are\n\n\n                                                   76\n\fJuly 14, 2008 (“In no state have problems been solved over night. The full transformation of a\n\nsystem – the building of structure and processes and the appointment of strong leaders to manage\n\nthe way it all works together – takes several years. Three to five years is the standard time frame\n\nassumed to be necessary to turn a system around. Progress, that is evidence of the effort to\n\nchange things, becomes evident only over time.”); see also 12/11/08 Trial Tr. at 353 (Test. of\n\nLaura Nuss) (“you don’t see the outcomes that you want to see as fast as you would like to see\n\nthem. You know, this is a historically plagued service system. So I think it is taking time to see\n\nthe outcomes. But, you know, we still see the bad outcomes for individual issues. But we’re also\n\nseeing a lot of positive ones”).\n\n       Moreover, with respect to interagency coordination and collaboration, there have been\n\nimprovements, but the District’s performance has been less than consistent given the problems in\n\nthis area as recently as December 2008. (See 2009 Special Masters’ Report at 129 (“Time has\n\nshown that the problems with interagency coordination persist under the Fenty Administration as\n\nthey had under the previous administration, and have resulted in the same sub-standard\n\nconditions, lack of necessary medical care, as well as inappropriate and ineffective day\n\nprograms.”).) For example, defendants’ expert, Nancy Thaler, concluded that it was a failure in\n\ninteragency communication that caused “[t]he recent decision made by MAA to change the\n\n\n\n       remaining systemic weaknesses specific to the District’s IDD system: access to\n       high-quality behavioral health services; clinical services, including physical\n       therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), speech therapy (SPL), and nutrition\n       services; and transformation of the legacy facility-based day services to\n       person-centered habilitation and vocational-preparation programs that provide\n       quality habilitative, vocational and community-integrated services appropriate to\n       each consumer’s needs and preferences.\n\n(Defs.’ Mem. re Alternate Remedy at 11-12.)\n\n                                                77\n\fMedical Assistance transportation arrangements [to have] a negative impact on the consumers in\n\nthe DDA program by limiting their capacity to travel to medical and other appointments.”\n\n(Defs.’ Mem., Ex. 16, Addendum to Expert Report of Nancy Thaler at 11-12, Oct. 7, 2008.)\n\nSimilarly, as of December 2008, there continued to be problems with obtaining guardianships in\n\na timely fashion. (2009 Special Masters’ Report at 45, 49 (“The delays in obtaining\n\nguardianship for the provision of informed consent for medical and dental treatment of class\n\nmembers . . . have continued in the compliance period,” leading to defendants continued inability\n\n“to provide class members with medical treatment and health care that is timely, particularly for\n\nclass members who have acute medical needs.”).)\n\n                 2.     Monitoring\n\n       The second part of defendants’ durable remedy argument is their claim that their\n\nperformance is subject to extensive monitoring, including monitoring by the Superior Court, the\n\nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the Quality Trust, and the District’s\n\ninternal monitoring by the Health Regulation and Licensing Administration (“HRLA”) and the\n\nfour units of DDA’s Quality Management Division – Health and Wellness, Quality Enhancement\n\nand Quality Improvement, Incident Management and Enforcement, and Mortality Review.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a number of problems with defendants’ contention that this monitoring\n\nis proof of a durable remedy.\n\n                 i. Superior Court – As described by defendants, the Superior Court for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia plays a significant role in overseeing plaintiffs.48 However, the Superior\n\n\n       48\n            According to defendants,\n\n       any person brought before the Court (to be admitted or committed to DDS/DDA)\n\n                                                78\n\fCourt’s authority is limited to treatment decisions about individual class members, and although\n\nthis system has been in place since 1979,49 significant systemic reforms have not been achieved.\n\nMoreover, proposed legislation may signification alter the role of the Superior Court. See D.C.\n\nCouncil, B18-0501, Developmental Disabilities Reform Act of 2009 (introduced Oct. 20, 2009).\n\nThus, although Superior Court reviews individual cases and does play an important role, its job\n\nis limited and in light of the pending legislation, the Court can hardly count on its continued\n\ninvolvement.\n\n               ii. CMS – According to defendants, CMS, the federal agency that administers the\n\nMedicare and Medicaid programs, “already provides extensive oversight for services provided\n\nby DDS/DDA.” (Defs.’ Mem. at 44.) For example, the District must submit an annual report to\n\nCMS that addresses both fiscal and quality performance measures, and CMS conducts\n\n“unannounced random audits on various areas of its six assurances, including level of care,\n\nservice plan, qualified providers, health and welfare, administrative oversight, and financial\n\naccountability.” (Id. (citing Nuss. Decl. ¶ 4, Oct. 7, 2009) (Ex. 4 to Defs.’ Mem.).) In addition,\n\n\n\n       has a right to be represented by retained or appointed counsel. See SCR-MRP 11;\n       see also D.C OFFICIAL CODE § 7-1304.12(2) (authorizing fees to be a paid to\n       appointed counsel). Moreover, any interested party has the right to initiate an\n       action in Superior Court to compel DDS to accord persons with IDD the rights\n       afforded them under District law. D.C OFFICIAL CODE § 7-1305.13(a).\n       Indeed, each person committed to DDS/DDA supervision is entitled to an annual\n       judicial hearing to determine whether the person has “benefitted from . . .\n       habilitation.” Id. at § 1304.11(a)(1). These procedures conclusively demonstrate\n       that members of the Evans class have an adequate remedy at law for any potential\n       future failure by the District to provide them with appropriate treatment.\n\n(Defs.’ Mem. at 43-44.)\n       49\n         See The Mentally Retarded Citizens Constitutional Rights and Dignity Act of 1978,\neffective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-137; D.C. Official Code § 7-1301.02 33 et seq.).\n\n                                                79\n\faccording to defendants, “CMS will be initiating expanded . . . quality-reporting in the next\n\nfiscal year that mirrors the expanded quality management requirements now found in the HCBS\n\nwaiver program.” (Id.) Finally, defendants assert that:\n\n       From February 2007 to March 2009, CMS engaged in even more intensive\n       monitoring to ensure the then-MAA and DDS/DDA’s compliance with the federal\n       HCBS waiver requirements. This included monthly written and telephonic\n       monitoring of a corrective action plan in three of the six assurances: Plan of Care;\n       Health and Welfare; and Administrative Oversight. In March 2009, however,\n       CMS determined that the District had “made major changes in the performance,\n       structure, oversight mechanism, and systems sufficient enough to engage in\n       continuous Quality Improvement (QI).” To qualify for such a finding, a state\n       must demonstrate a robust system of “discovery, remediation and improvement”\n       in all six assurances. Citing the “demonstrated effectiveness of the many newly\n       implemented systems to meet the CMS quality requirements,” CMS discontinued\n       its intensified monitoring.\n\n(Defs.’ Mem. at 45 (quoting and citing CMS Letter, March 9, 2009 (Ex. 19 to Defs.’ Mem.).)50\n\nPlaintiff responds that the CMS monitoring “is irrelevant . . . [because] CMS monitors all states\n\nthat participate in the federal Medicaid program. All such states are required to file the type of\n\nannual reports that the defendants reference.” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 82.) But more importantly, CMS\n\ndoes not perform regular on-site audits to determine the quality of care provided to class\n\nmembers and other DDA consumers. According to the DOJ counsel who represents plaintiff-\n\nintervenors, the District conducts the on-site reviews of community placements and the regional\n\noffice of CMS, “as part of their quality review that occurs every five years, . . . requests evidence\n\nfrom the District that it is meeting all the statutory and regulatory assurances required for CMS.”\n\n(12/18/09 Tr. at 195.) Given CMS’ limited role in conducting on-site visits so that it can assess\n\n\n       50\n          Of course, prior to CMS issuing its Letter of March 9, 2009, the District had been put\non a “corrective action plan” – a program of intensified monitoring – due to the fact that the\nDistrict failed to substantially meet three of the six waiver assurances. (Defs. Mem., Ex. 19; see\nalso Court Monitor Rep. at 27, Jan. 26, 2007.)\n\n                                                 80\n\fthe impact of the systems on class members, the Court can take little solace from the increased\n\nrole of CMS, which is a recent development that will not begin until sometime this year and will\n\nbe a far cry from the type of monitoring that has any direct impact on the day-to-day lives of the\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n               iii. Quality Trust – As part of the 2001 Plan and as part of the settlement of the\n\nEvans litigation, the Quality Trust was established in 2001 as an quasi-independent entity tasked\n\nwith providing “monitoring, legal services and lay advocacy services for consumers in the\n\nDistrict of Columbia.” (2001 Plan at 45 (footnote omitted).) As part of its function, the Quality\n\nTrust was to monitor services being provided to the over 1400 non-class members and would\n\neventually take over from the Court Monitor the job of monitoring the Evans class members.\n\n(Id. at 46; see also supra pp. 13-15.) Specifically, the Quality Trust is tasked with developing\n\nand implementing an annual monitoring plan with input from all stakeholders; reviewing all\n\nreports and investigations of serious incidents involving DDS consumers; issuing annual reports;\n\nand reviewing and providing input regarding DDS budgeting information. (2001 Plan at 47-48.)\n\nHowever, although defendants point to the Quality Trust as an important monitoring component,\n\nthe Quality Trust has informed the Court in its most recent filing that the “proposal to transition\n\nthe monitoring function solely to Quality Trust is premature.” (Quality Trust Opp’n at 21; see\n\nalso id. at 27 (“When adequate structures are in place, and an opportunity for meaningful\n\ntransition from the Court Monitor has occurred, Quality Trust will be able to assume\n\npost-litigation monitoring of the Evans class members along with its current monitoring\n\nfunction.”).) The Quality Trust estimates that it will take 12-18 months “to have a meaningful\n\ntransition.” (12/17/09 Tr. at 140.) Given this assessment, the Court cannot yet look to the\n\n\n                                                 81\n\fQuality Trust to support defendants’ durable remedy argument.51\n\n                iv. Internal DDS Quality Assurance System – According to defendants,\n\n“internal monitoring methods will ensure that it sustains the extensive reforms now in place.”\n\n(Defs.’ Mem. at 48). Within the Developmental Disabilities Administration, the Quality\n\nManagement Division (“QMD”) “monitors all aspects of the service-delivery system to ensure\n\ncompliance with federal and local law, national best practices, and applicable court orders.” (Id.\n\n(quoting 10/7/09 Nuss Decl. ¶ 51).) The QMD is divided into four functional units: Health and\n\nWellness, Quality Enhancement and Quality Improvement (“QE/QI”), Incident Management and\n\nEnforcement (“IMEU”), and Mortality Review. (Defs.’ Mem. at 48-50 (quoting 10/7/09 Nuss\n\nDecl. ¶ 52).)\n\n       While improvements in internal monitoring are critical to the existence of a durable\n\nremedy, over the lengthy history of this case, defendants’ monitoring has been woefully\n\ninadequate both in terms of the quality and speed of internal investigations of both deaths and\n\nserious incidents involving class members and DDA consumers. This problem has continued\n\nthrough 2009. (See, e.g., Quarterly Report of the Court Monitor at 7, December 10, 2009;\n\nQuality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities Monitoring Unit Annual Report and Data\n\nSummary at 1, Oct. 1, 2008 – Sept. 30, 2009 (concluding that “progress in improving the\n\nsystems and supports for people with developmental disabilities in the District of Columbia is\n\n\n       51\n         The District’s proposed alternate remedy, set forth in a motion filed just days ago (see\nsupra note 2), the Quality Trust’s responsibility for on-the-ground monitoring appears to have\nshrunk and it is now described as an “active[] members of oversight committees that review\nfindings generated by these systems and initiatives and contribute to recommendations for\nimprovements going forward.” (Defs.’ Mem. re Alternate Remedy at 13.) Obviously, if its\nremedy were to be adopted, the Quality Trust’s role (despite the District’s obligation to fund it\nwith over $30 million) would be reduced to “ad hoc monitoring.” (Id., Ex. A at 7.)\n\n                                                82\n\fmixed. . . . A more consistent and transparent process for investigating Serious Reportable\n\nIncidents at DA is also necessary . . . . Our data indicates that investigation reports are not being\n\ncompleted consistent with policy.)\n\n       The flaws in the District’s internal monitoring also became apparent recently when the\n\nDistrict had to put into receivership one of its largest providers, Individual Development, Inc.\n\n(“IDI”). While the District touts this action as an example of “[t]he new institutional culture and\n\ncollaborative ethos” of officials from DDA, DHCF, and HRLA (Defs.’ Mem. re Alternate\n\nRemedy at 5), what it conveniently fails to disclose is that many of the problems with this\n\nprovider that led to the receivership were uncovered by the Court Monitor and reported by the\n\nCourt Monitor and the plaintiffs, not by the District’s internal monitoring apparatus. (See\n\n12/18/09 Tr. at 239.)\n\n       In sum, defendants have not demonstrated a durable remedy as required by Horne.\n\nWhile it is true that the District has made significant strides in the last year or two under new\n\nleadership, the Court does not have confidence that the agency’s progress is durable and self-\n\nsustaining.

As documented by the 2009\n\nSpecial Masters’ Report, the three most recent Court Monitor Reports and the 2009 Quality\n\nTrust’s Monitoring Unit Annual Report and Data Summary, results are, at best, uneven, and it is\n\nfar too soon to determine whether the structural changes, some of which are still in the\n\nimplementation phase, will have the desired impacts on the safety, health and welfare of the class\n\nmembers.\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n       In 1978, the parties agreed, and the Court endorsed that agreement in an Order and\n\nJudgment, that plaintiffs had certain constitutional rights, that those rights had been violated, and\n\n\n                                                 83\n\fthat to remedy those violations, defendants would have to take certain remedial actions. More\n\nthan 30 years later, defendants ask the Court to relieve them of those obligations under Rule\n\n60(b)(5) on the grounds that enforcing those promises prospectively is no longer equitable.\n\nWhile defendants certainly have the right to file a 60(b)(5) motion, they have the burden to\n\njustify their motion. Defendants have failed: the objectives of the original consent decree and\n\nsubsequent court orders, as incorporated in the 2001 Plan, have not been achieved and\n\ndefendants have not demonstrated that the prospective enforcement of the court orders would be\n\ninequitable or “detrimental to the public interest.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2593. Accordingly,\n\ndefendants’ motion for vacatur and dismissal will be DENIED.\n\n\n\n                                                        /s/\n                                             ELLEN SEGAL HUVELLE\n                                             United States District Judge\n\nDate: April 7, 2010.\n\n\n\n\n                                                84\n\f</pre>",
