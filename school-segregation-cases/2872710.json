We conclude that the\nPlaintiffs may seek money damages on behalf of the fund,\nnotwithstanding the fact the alleged fiduciary violations affected\nonly a subset of the saving plan’s participants.\n\n\n      Accordingly, we will reverse and remand for further\nproceedings.\n\n\n                                I\n\n\n                                A\n\n\n       The complaint alleges the following facts. Jingdong Zhu\nand Adrian Fields (the Plaintiffs) are former employees of\nSchering-Plough Corporation (“Schering”). During their\nemployment with Schering, the Plaintiffs elected to participate\nin the Schering-Plough Employees’ Savings Plan (“the Savings\nPlan” or “the Plan”). Under the Savings Plan, a Schering\n\n\n                                5\n\femployee agreed to reduce his or her take-home compensation\nin order to invest that amount in one or more investment funds\non a pre-tax basis 1 . The Savings Plan authorized a participant to\nselect from different investment funds. One of the investment\nfunds was the Schering Plan Company Stock Fund (“the\nCompany Stock Fund”), which consisted of company stock.\nUnder the Savings Plan, a participant was not permitted to invest\nmore than 50% of his or her future contributions in Schering\nstock. Some of the Plaintiffs’ deferred compensation included\nan investment in the Company Stock Fund.\n\n\n      As of December 31, 2001, Schering stock made up\napproximately 31% of the value of the Saving Plan’s assets.\nMore than 60% of the employees who participated in the Saving\n\n\n       1\n          An employee who participates in a deferred\ncompensation plan to save for retirement qualifies for tax\nbenefits pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 401(k). The type of deferred\ncompensation plan offered to Schering employees is referred to\nin ERISA as an “individual account plan” or a “defined\ncontribution plan.” 29 U.S.C. § 1002(34). These terms refer to\n“a pension plan which provides for an individual account for\neach participant and for benefits based solely upon the amount\ncontributed to the participant’s account, and any income,\nexpenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts of\nother participants which may be allocated to such participant’s\naccount.” Id.\n\n                                6\n\fPlan had at least some of their assets allocated to the Company\nStock Fund. In fiscal year 2001 the loss in the value of Schering\nstock constituted 87% of the drop in value of the Saving Plan’s\nassets, and in 2002 the loss in Schering’s stock’s value\nconstituted 50% of the Saving Plan’s net loss. The loss to the\nSavings Plan was approximately $138,000,000. By June of 2003\nthe price of Schering stock had fallen below $20 per share from\na class-period high of better than $60 a share.\n\n\n                               B\n\n\n      On October 6, 2003, the Plaintiffs filed this class action\npursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2) on behalf of the Savings Plan\nand “[a]ll persons who were participants in or beneficiaries of\nthe Saving Plan at any time between July 29, 1998 and the\npresent (the ‘Class Period’), and whose accounts included\ninvestments in Schering stock.” The complaint named as\ndefendants and as fiduciaries of the Savings Plan Schering,\nRichard Kogan, its former CEO, members of the Schering\nBoard’s Pension Committee, the Schering-Plough Employees\nBenefits Committee and one of its members, the Schering-\nPlough Benefits Investment Committee and three of its\nmembers, the counsel of the Investment Committee, and\nVanguard Group, Inc., the Trustee of the Savings Plan\n(collectively “the Defendants”).\n\n\n\n                               7\n\f       The complaint alleges that the Defendants breached their\nfiduciary duties of prudence, care, and loyalty by continuing to\noffer the Company Stock Fund as one of the Savings Plan\nalternatives when they knew that Schering’s stock price was\nunlawfully and artificially inflated. Additionally, the Plaintiffs\nalleged that the Defendants failed to disclose negative material\ninformation about Schering, which induced participants in the\nSavings Plan to elect to invest in the Company Stock Fund. The\ncomplaint also alleges that some of the Defendants did not\nloyally serve the Saving Plan participants by taking steps to\navoid a conflict of interest such as making appropriate public\ndisclosures, divesting the Savings Plan of Schering stock,\ndiscontinuing further investments in Schering stock, consulting\nindependent fiduciaries, or resigning as Savings Plan fiduciaries.\n\n\n       In lieu of answering the complaint, the Defendants filed\na motion to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim under\n§ 1109(a).2 The Defendants argued that “[b]ecause [Section\n\n\n\n       2\n         29 U.S.C. § 1109 reads as follows:\n       Liability for breach of fiduciary duty\n       (a) Any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan\n       who breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or\n       duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this title shall be\n       personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to\n       the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore\n\n                                8\n\f1109(a)] authorizes relief only for ‘the plan’, a participant can\nstate a claim only if he proceeds in a representative capacity on\nbehalf of ‘the plan as a whole’ and seeks to recover for all plan\nparticipants allegedly injured by the fiduciary breach.”\n(Emphasis in the original.). In addition, they asserted that the\nPlaintiffs do not seek relief on behalf of the Plan as a whole\nbecause the complaint allegedly excludes current employees\nwho were part of the sub-group that invested in the Company\nStock Fund.\n\n\n       They further maintained that the consolidated complaint\nimproperly seeks “individual relief for each Plan participant”\nbecause it prays for “an allocation ‘among the Participants’\nindividualized accounts in proportion to the accounts’ losses.’”\n(Emphasis added in the Defendants’ motion.). Finally, the\nDefendants contended that the Plaintiffs failed to allege facts\n\n\n       to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have\n       been made through use of assets of the plan by the\n       fiduciary, and shall be subject to such other equitable or\n       remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate,\n       including removal of such fiduciary. A fiduciary may\n       also be removed for a violation of 29 USCS § 1111.\n       (b) No fiduciary shall be liable with respect to a breach\n       of fiduciary duty under this title if such breach was\n       committed before he became a fiduciary or after he\n       ceased to be a fiduciary.\n\n                               9\n\fshowing detrimental reliance by the Saving Plan’s participants\non the Defendants’ alleged misrepresentations and non-\ndisclosures.\n\n\n       The District Court granted the Defendant’s motion and\ndismissed the consolidated complaint with prejudice. It held that\nthe Plaintiffs lacked standing to prosecute this action under 29\nU.S.C. §§ 1109(a) and 1132(a)(2) 3 because the consolidated\ncomplaint alleges only “harm suffered by the individual Plan\nParticipants and not the Savings Plan, and seeks relief measured\nby the harm to individuals and tailored for the benefit of\nindividuals, and not the Savings Plan.” The District Court\nsummarized its conclusion in these words:\n\n\n              Even assuming that each defendant\n              is an ERISA fiduciary, that each of\n              plaintiffs’ allegations concerning\n              defendants’ conduct were true, and\n              that this conduct rose to a level to\n              breach ERISA’s fiduciary duties\n              (without the Court opining as to\n\n\n       3\n         29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2) reads as follows: “A civil action\nmay be brought . . . by the Secretary, or by a participant,\nbeneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section 1109\nof this title.”\n\n                               10\n\f              merits   of   these   assumptions),\n              plaintiffs cannot demonstrate how\n              any defendant would be “personally\n              liable for damages (‘to make good\n              to [the] plan any losses to the plan\n              resulting from each such breach’)”\n              to the Saving Plans because it is\n              only Plan Participants who might\n              be able to show that they suffered\n              individualized losses.\n\n\n       The District Court commented further that because\n“plaintiffs can point to no set of facts that would demonstrate\nlosses to the plan. . . . the Court need not reach defendants’\nfurther arguments in favor of dismissal.”\n\n\n       The Plaintiffs have timely appealed. The District Court\nhad subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 29 U.S.C. §\n1132(e)(1) of ERISA. This Court has appellate jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291, 1294(1).\n\n\n                               II\n\n\n                               A\n\n\n       The Plaintiffs contend that “[t]he district court erred in\n\n\n                               11\n\ffailing to distinguish between the plan-wide nature of the losses\ncaused by defendants’ fiduciary breaches, and the fact that the\nlosses caused by those breaches are reflected in the Plan’s\nindividual participant accounts.” They argue that the District\nCourt erred in concluding that their contributions were kept in\nseparate, segregated accounts and never became a part of the\nSaving Plan’s assets. Instead, the Plaintiffs maintain that the\nSavings Plan was a unitary trust that purchased and maintained\nstock in the Company Stock Fund, which was one of the\nfourteen investment alternatives in a defined contribution\nemployee benefit plan. The Plaintiffs also assert that the District\nCourt erred in determining that the Company Stock Fund was an\nindividual account plan and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan\n(“ESOP”).\n\n\n              We exercise de novo review over\n              the dismissal of claims under\n              Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n              12(b)(6).

Id.\n\n\nMariana v. Fisher, 338 F.3d 189, 195 (3d Cir. 2003) (full\ncitation provided).\n\n\n       Under § 1002(21)A of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)A,\nthose having discretionary authority or discretionary\nresponsibility in the administration of a plan are fiduciaries.\nSection 1104 imposes upon them fiduciary duties including the\nduties of “care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the\ncircumstances.” 29 U.S.C. § 1104. Section 1109(a) makes plan\nfiduciaries “personally liable to make good to [the] plan any\nlosses to the plan resulting from each . . . breach” of fiduciary\nduty. 29 U.S.C. § 1109(a). And, finally, § 1132(a)(2) provides\nthat a “civil action may be brought . . . by a participant or\nbeneficiary . . . for appropriate relief under section 1109.” 29\nU.S.C. § 1109.\n\n\n       The issue presented here is whether the complaint states\na claim under § 1109 – i.e., whether the complaint seeks relief\nfor the Schering-Plough Employees’ Savings Plan based on\nallegations that there were “losses to the plan resulting from [a]\nbreach” of fiduciary duty. We believe it clearly does.\n\n\n                               13\n\f       The complaint alleges that “[a]s a consequence of the\ndefendants’ breaches [of fiduciary duty], the Plan suffered\nsignificant losses” and seeks “a monetary payment to the Plan to\nmake good to the Plan the losses to the Plan resulting from\n[those] breaches of fiduciary duty.” Section 1109 allows the\nPlan to recover “any losses” from a breach of fiduciary duty. 29\nU.S.C. § 1109 (emphasis added). The fiduciary’s liability is not\nlimited to plan “losses that will ultimately redound to the benefit\nof all participants.” The Plan held Schering-Plough stock as an\nasset and that asset was greatly reduced in value allegedly\nbecause of breaches of fiduciary duty. This clearly was a “loss”\nto the Plan within the meaning of § 1109.4\n\n\n       Just as the fact that the assets at issue were held for the\nultimate benefit of Plaintiffs does not alter the fact that they\nwere held by the Plan, so, too, the fact that Plaintiffs may have\nto show individual reliance on the defendants’ alleged\n\n       4\n          The Supreme Court did not hold otherwise in\nMassachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Russell, 473\nU.S. 134 (1985). While the Court did observe in that case that\n§ 1132(a)(2) actions seek remedies which provide a benefit “to\nthe plan as a whole,” the issue presented here was not before the\nCourt. Moreover, the recovery in this case would go to the Plan\nas a whole to be held in accordance with the terms of the plan,\nincluding the payment of operating expenses and the like, which\nwould redound to the benefit of all participants.\n\n                                14\n\fmisrepresentations to prevail on some claims does not mean they\ndo not seek recovery for Plan losses. As the Court aptly put it in\nIn re Honeywell Int’l ERISA Litigation, Civil No. 03-1214\n(D.N.J., June 14, 2004) at 30:\n\n\n       [L]osses to the Plan may have resulted from\n       decisions by individual participants, but that does\n       not mean that those losses were not losses of the\n       Plan; it simply means that some of the decision\n       making for Plan investments was conducted by\n       the participants who contributed to it.\n\n\n       It is a non sequitur to say, as the District Court did, that\nPlaintiffs cannot demonstrate any losses to the Plan because it\nis an “individual account plan which includes an ESOP\ninvestment alternative.” First, while the Plan is, indeed, an\n“individual account plan,” this does not preclude the Plan from\nhaving losses. Second, the Plan is not an “employee stock\nownership plan” or an “ESOP.” Under § 1107(d)(6)(A), an\n“employee stock ownership plan” is “designed to invest\nprimarily in qualifying employer securities.” 29 U.S.C. §\n1107(d)(6)(A). As this Court explained in Moench v. Robertson,\n62 F.3d 553, 568 (3d Cir. 1995):\n\n\n       [ESOPs are] “device[s] for expanding the national\n       capital base among employees – an effective\n\n\n                                 15\n\f       merger of the roles of capitalist and worker.”\n       Donovan v. Cunningham, 716 F.2d at 1458. Thus,\n       the concept of employee ownership constituted a\n       goal in and of itself. To accomplish this end,\n       “Congress . . . enacted a number of laws designed\n       to encourage employers to set up such plans.” Id.\n\n\n      The Plan before us was designed to provide opportunities\nfor saving and investment. It was not designed to invest\nprimarily in securities of the employer. Indeed, the Plan was not\nrequired to offer Schering-Plough stock as one of its investment\nopportunities.\n\n\n       The District Court’s conclusions (1) that Plaintiffs’\ncontributions were never assets of the Savings Plan and never\naggregated, and (2) that Plaintiffs only seek damages for their\nindividualized losses, directly conflict with the express terms of\nthe Savings Plan as well as other allegations of the complaint.\n\n\n       The Savings Plan provides in Article 4.01(a) that\ncontributions to the Savings Plan\n\n\n                 shall be invested in one or more\n                 Investment Funds authorized by the\n                 Investment Committee, which,\n                 from time to time, may include\n\n\n                                16\n\f       such equity funds, international\n       equity funds, fixed income funds,\n       money market funds, a Company\n       Stock Fund, and other funds or\n       investm ent veh icles as the\n       Investment Committee elects to\n       offer.\n\n\nArticle 4.02 provides as follows:\n\n\n       A participant shall make one\n       investment election covering his or\n       her Accounts in accordance with\n       the following options:\n\n\n              (a) 100 percent in\n              one of the available\n              Investment Funds;\n\n\n              (b) in more than one\n              Investm e n t F u n d\n              allocated in multiples\n              of 1 percent;\n\n\n\n\n                       17\n\f      provided, however, that in no event\n      may a Participant allocate more\n      than 50 percent of future\n      contributions to the Company Stock\n      Fund. If a Participant fails to make\n      an investment election with respect\n      to 100 percent of his or her\n      Accounts, the portion of such\n      Accounts not subject to the\n      Participant’s investment election\n      shall be invested in a money market\n      fund or equivalent investment\n      vehicle.\n\n\nSection 4.03 reads as follows:\n\n\n      Each     Participant       is   solely\n      responsible for the selection of his\n      or her investment options. The\n      Trustee, the Committee, the\n      Investm e nt C o m m itte e , a ny\n      Employer, and the officers,\n      supervisors and other employees of\n      any Employer are not empowered\n      to advise a Participant as to the\n      manner in which his or her\n\n\n                       18\n\f       accounts shall be invested. The fact\n       that an Investment Fund is\n       available to Participants for\n       investment under the Plan shall not\n       be construed as a recommendation\n       for investment in that Investment\n       Fund.\n\n\nPursuant to Article 4.05,\n\n\n       [a]   participant        may   elect   to\n       reallocate his or her Accounts\n       among the Investment Funds, in\n       multiples of 1 percent, by giving\n       such Notice as the Committee or its\n       delegate shall prescribe; provided,\n       however, that in no event may a\n       Participant allocate more than 50\n       percent of the value of his or her\n       Accounts at the time of the\n       reallocation to the Company Stock\n       Fund. The reallocation shall be\n       effective     as    soon     as\n       administratively practicable after\n       the Trustee receives such Notice.\n\n\n\n                           19\n\f       Article 5.01 requires the trustee of the Savings Fund to\nvalue each of the Investment Funds each business day. “On each\nValuation Date there shall be allocated to the Accounts of each\nParticipant his or her proportionate share of the increase or\ndecrease in the fair market value of his or her Accounts in each\nof the Investment Funds.” Article 5.03 requires the trustee to\nfurnish each participant with a statement setting forth the value\nof his or her Accounts each calendar quarter.\n\n\n       Article 9.06 provides that until the accounts of a\nparticipant who is entitled to distribution because of the\ntermination of employment or after the 65th anniversary of the\nParticipant’s date of birth, are completely distributed, “the\nAccounts of a Participant who is entitled to a distribution shall\ncontinue to be invested as part of the funds of the Plan . . . .”\n\n\n       In Section 10.09, the Savings Plan provides that “[t]he\nCommittee or its delegate shall maintain, or cause to be\nmaintained, records showing the individual balances in each\nParticipant’s Accounts. However, maintenance of those records\nand Accounts shall not require any segregation of the funds of\nthe Plan.”\n\n\n       In Section 11.01, the Savings Plan provides that “[a]ll the\nfunds of the Plan shall be held by the Trustee appointed from\ntime to time by the Investment Committee or its delegate under\n\n\n                               20\n\fa trust agreement adopted, or as amended, by the Board of\nDirectors.”\n\n\n       Pursuant to Article 11.03, “Company Stock held by the\nTrustee shall be voted by the Trustee at each annual meeting and\nat each special meeting of stockholders of the Company as\ndirected by the Participant to whose Accounts such Company\nStock is credited.” (emphasis added).\n\n\n       Thus, contrary to the District Court’s interpretation of the\nprovisions of the Savings Plan, each participant’s deferred\npayroll compensation was held in trust as the assets of the\nSavings Plan. Each participant in the Savings Plan was provided\nwith an individualized account and periodically informed of the\nindividual balance in his or her account. The Savings Plan also\nmakes clear the fact that each participant has an individual\naccount does not “require any segregation of the funds of the\nPlan.” Article 10.09.\n\n\n      The District Court cited this Court’s decision in Moench\nin support of its determination that a plan that permits\nemployees to become part owners of their employer is an ESOP\nand not a traditional pension plan governed by ERISA. As noted\nabove, the Defendants have conceded that the Savings Plan we\nare considering is not an ESOP. In Moench, this Court held that\n“in limited circumstances, ESOP fiduciaries can be liable under\n\n\n                                21\n\fERISA for continuing to invest in employer stock according to\nthe plan’s direction . . . .” Id. at 556. It went on to say that\n“[w]hile fiduciaries of pension benefit plans generally must\ndiversify investments of the plan assets . . ., fiduciaries of\nESOPS are exempted from this duty.” Id. at 568. In reversing\nthe District Court’s holding that an ESOP cannot be held liable\nfor investing solely in employer common stock, this Court\nexplained that “an ESOP fiduciary who invests the assets in\nemployer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted\nconsistently with ERISA by virtue of that decision. However,\nthe plaintiff may overcome that presumption by establishing that\nthe fiduciary abused its decision by investing in employer\nsecurities.” Id. at 571. The principle announced in Moench has\nno application to the duty of a fiduciary of pension benefit plans\nto diversify investments “so as to minimize the risk of large\nlosses.” Id. at 568. “ESOPs, unlike pension plans, are not\nintended to guarantee retirement benefits, and indeed, by its very\nnature, ‘an ESOP places employee retirements assets at much\ngreater risk than does the typical diversified ERISA plan.’” Id.\nat 568. Because the Savings Plan in this case was not an ESOP,\nthe Moench decision does not resolve the issue presented in this\nmatter.\n\n\n      In a letter to this Court filed pursuant to Rule 28(j) of the\nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Defendants cited a\nrecent decision of the Fifth Circuit, Milofsky v. American\n\n\n                                22\n\fAirlines, Inc., 404 F.3d 338 (5th Cir. 2005) reh’g en banc\ngranted, No. 03-11087, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 15122, (5th Cir.\nJuly 19, 2005)5 in support of their argument that a participant\nlacks standing to bring an action on behalf of an individual\naccount pension plan if he or she does not seek plan-wide relief.\n\n\n       In Milofsky, the plaintiffs were employed as pilots by\nBusiness Express, Inc. (“BEX”) when it was acquired by AMR\nEagle Holding Corporation, the holding company of American\nEagle, Inc. (“American Eagle”). While employed by BEX, the\nplaintiffs participated in its individual account pension plan. Id.\nat 340. At the time of the acquisition of BEX, the plaintiffs were\ngiven notice that the balance of their accounts in the BEX plan\nwould be transferred to a comparable American Eagle 401k\nplan. The notices advised the plaintiffs when the transfers would\noccur. The transfers did not occur, however, until months after\nthe time written in the notice. Id. at 340-41.\n\n\n       The plaintiffs filed a class action against American\nAirlines and Towers Perrin, a benefits consulting firm hired by\nAmerican Airlines to render administrative services in\n\n\n       5\n       Fifth Circuit Rule 41.3 states that “[u]nless otherwise\nexpressly provided, the granting of a rehearing en banc vacates\nthe panel opinion and judgment of the court and stays the\nmandate.”\n\n                                23\n\fconnection with the plan. Id. at 340. The action, which was filed\nunder 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2), alleged that American Airlines\nand Towers Perrin had violated fiduciary duties in\nmisrepresenting how and when their accounts would be\ntransferred to the American Eagle 401(k) plan. Id. “They alleged\nthat because of the failure to effect the transfer of the class\nmembers’ account balances in a timely and prudent manner, the\nvalues of their accounts decreased because the assets remained\ninvested in the floundering BEX Plan longer than expected.” Id.\nat 341. The plaintiffs requested “actual damages to be paid to\nthe [American Eagle] $ uper $ aver Plan, to be allocated among\ntheir individual accounts proportionately to their losses resulting\nfrom the alleged breach.” Id.\n\n\n       The majority of the three-judge panel in Milofsky held\nthat “plaintiffs lack standing because this case in essence is\nabout an alleged particularized harm targeting a specific subset\nof plan beneficiaries, with claims for damages to benefits [sic]\nmembers of the subclass only, and not the plan generally.” Id. at\n347.\n\n\n       The facts in Milofsky are clearly distinguishable from\nthose in the matter sub judice. In Milofsky, the plaintiffs alleged\nthat the value of their investments in the BEX plan decreased\nbecause of the failure of the defendants to transfer the funds to\nthe American Eagle 401(k) plan. Id. at 351. Thus, this alleged\n\n\n                                24\n\floss occurred prior to the transfer of the BEX plan participants’\ninvestments to the American Eagle 401(k) plan. In Milofsky, the\nplaintiffs sought damages on behalf of the BEX plan members,\nand did not seek to restore assets of the American Eagle 401(k)\nfund. Here, the Plaintiffs seek damages from the fiduciaries for\ntheir violation of their duty to a subclass which had transferred\nits funds to the trustee of the Savings Fund.\n\n\n       In Kuper v. Iovenko, 66 F.3d 1447 (6th Cir. 1995), the\nSixth Circuit held that a subset of employee benefit participants\nhas standing to bring an action for breach of fiduciary duty\nunder 29 U.S.C. §1109. The Court rejected the same argument\npresented by the Defendants in this matter that “an action under\n29 U.S.C. § 1109 must be brought on behalf of a plan as a whole\nand that a claim brought by a subclass of plan participants fails\nto satisfy this requirement.” Id. at 1452. The Sixth Circuit in\nKuper concluded that the plaintiffs had standing to bring this\naction pursuant to §1132(a)(2). Citing Moench, however, it\naffirmed the dismissal of the action on the merits, adopting this\nCourt’s rule that a fiduciary who invests in an employer’s stock\nis entitled to a rebuttable presumption that it acted consistently\nwith ERISA in continuing to invest in an employer’s securities.\nKuper, 66 F.3d at 1458-59. The Sixth Circuit affirmed because\nit concluded that the plaintiffs had failed “to rebut the\npresumption that defendants acted reasonably in continuing to\nhold Quantum stock.” Id. at 1459. In sum, the court concluded\n\n\n                               25\n\fin Kuper that § 1132(a)(2) does not authorize a plaintiff to\nrecover damages on his or her own behalf. Instead, a plaintiff\nmust seek to have the fiduciary reimburse the plan. Id. at 1453.6\n\n\n       6\n         At least one other circuit court, and several district\ncourts, have reached a similar conclusion. In Roth v. Sawyer-\nCleator Lumber Co., 61 F.3d 599 (8th Cir. 1995), the Eighth\nCircuit addressed the issue of whether plaintiffs were bringing\ntheir action under Section 1132(a)(2) individually or on behalf\nof the plan. Id. at 605. The court explained that the defendants’\nbreach of fiduciary duty resulted in two types of loss: individual\nloss to the beneficiaries, which is not actionable under Russell,\nand a loss to the plan, which is actionable under Section\n1132(a)(2), because the plan itself was also harmed due to the\nbreach. Id; see also In re Honeywell International ERISA Litg.,\nNo. 03-1214, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21585, at *51-52. (D.N.J.\nSept. 14, 2004) (holding that even though plaintiffs could\nchoose the investment vehicles in which their funds were\ninvested, those funds were still held by the plan, and therefore\nplaintiffs were permitted to bring their claim under Section\n1132(a)(2)); In re CMS Energy ERISA Litg., 312 F. Supp. 2d\n898, 913 (E.D. Mich. 2004) (citing Kuper in support of the\nCourt’s decision to reject defendant’s argument that a claim\nmust be dismissed under Section 1132(a)(2) unless it alleges\nharm to all of a plan’s participants); Kayes v. Pac. Lumber Co.,\nNos. C-89-3500 SBA, C-91-1812 SBA, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n21090, *6-7 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 1993), aff’d in part and rev’d in\npart on other grounds, 51 F.3d 1449, 1462 (9th Cir. 1995)\n\n                               26\n\f       The majority in Milofsky stated that the Court’s reasoning\nin Kuper is directly contrary to the principle announced in\nSupreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts Mutual Life\nInsurance Company v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134 (1985), that a\nparticipant’s action filed pursuant to § 1132(a)(2) must seek\nremedies that provide a “benefit to the plan as a whole . . . .”\nMilofsky, 404 F.3d at 346. In her dissent, Chief Judge Carolyn\nDineen King wrote that\n\n\n              Russell never         reached the\n              conclusion that       the majority\n              reaches, i.e., that standing can exist\n              under [§ 1132(a)(2)] only if all plan\n              participants would benefit from the\n              litigation. Instead, it only held that\n              a single plan participant, seeking\n              individual recovery for extra-\n              contractual damages payable\n              directly to her, could not proceed\n              with    her   lawsuit     under    [§\n\n\n\n(holding that a plaintiff who sues under Section 1132(a)(2)\n“does so on behalf of the plan and not in his individual capacity.\nWhile the individual has standing to bring the suit, and stands to\ngain if the suit is successful, his benefit is secondary or\nderivative of the plans [sic] gain”).\n\n                               27\n\f                1132(a)(2)]. Russell, 473 U.S. at\n                134, 105 S.Ct. 3085. Accordingly,\n                the majority’s holding goes far\n                beyond the holding of Russell.\n\n\nId. at 349 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\n\n\n          In footnote 4 of her opinion, Chief Judge King also\nstated:\n\n\n                The majority correctly notes that\n                Russell distinguishes between relief\n                for individuals and relief for the\n                plan as a whole. Majority Opinion,\n                [344-45]. Russell does not,\n                however, stand for the proposition\n                that the ‘plan as a whole’ is\n                synonymous with ‘all participants\n                of the plan,’ and several courts\n                have rejected this definition of the\n                ‘plan as a whole.’\n\n\nId. We agree with Chief Judge King’s interpretation of Russell,\nand decline to follow the majority’s opinion in Milofsky.\n\n\n          In Russell, the plaintiff was a beneficiary under two\n\n\n                                28\n\femployee health benefit plans funded by her employer and\ngoverned by ERISA. 473 U.S. at 136. She became disabled and\nreceived plan benefits until October 17, 1979. She requested\ninternal review of the termination decision. The plan\nadministrator reinstated her benefits on March 11, 1980, and she\nwas paid retroactive benefits in full. Id.\n\n\n      The plaintiff in Russell filed an action in state court\nseeking damages for mental and emotional distress under state\nlaw and ERISA claims resulting from the interruption of her\nbenefit payments, as well as punitive damages. Id. at 137. The\ndefendant removed the action to the District Court and moved\nfor summary judgment. The District Court granted the motion.\nIt held that the state-law claims were preempted by ERISA, and\nthat ERISA barred claims for extra-contractual and punitive\ndamages. Id. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s\ndetermination that the state law claims were pre-empted by\nERISA, but also concluded that the complaint alleged a cause of\naction under §1132(a)(2) and that punitive damages could be\nawarded. Id. at 138.\n\n\n       The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Ninth\nCircuit. It held that § 1109 does not authorize extracontractual\nor punitive damages. The Court also rejected the plaintiff’s\nargument that a private right of action for extracontractual\ndamages was implied in § 1109. Id. at 148. In rejecting the\n\n\n                                29\n\femployee’s claims, the Court stated that “[a] fair contextual\nreading of the statute makes it abundantly clear that its\ndraftsmen were primarily concerned with the possible misuse of\nplan assets, and with remedies that would protect the entire plan,\nrather than with the rights of an individual beneficiary.” Id. at\n142.\n\n\n      Unlike the circumstances presented in this matter, in\nRussell the plaintiff did not file a class action on behalf of an\nERISA employee benefits plan to require the defendants to pay\ndamages to the health benefit plan because of their alleged\nbreach of their fiduciary duty. Instead, she filed a private cause\nof action for extracontractual and punitive damages.7 The Court\ndid not hold in Russell that a subgroup of plan participants\ncannot file derivative action on behalf of an ERISA employee\nbenefits plan if the fiduciaries’ alleged breach did not affect the\ninvestments of participants in other subgroups. That issue\nsimply was not before the Court.\n\n\n      The District Court relied in part on Russell and its\nprogeny in holding that\n\n\n\n\n       7\n        Thus, Russell involved an action brought by one\nindividual who erroneously sought to recover extra contractual\ndamages under ERISA.\n\n                                30\n\f              [a]lthough individual employees’\n              contributions          were never\n              aggregated and         all employees\n              remained capable of investing on\n              an individualized basis, plaintiffs\n              now seek to theoretically aggregate\n              these individualized losses into\n              losses by “the plan.” Such an\n              after-the-fact aggregation by\n              individuals in order to sue on\n              behalf of the plan is not permitted\n              under the language of Sections\n              1104, 1109 or, most importantly\n              1132(a)(2).\n\n\nThe District Court based this holding on its misreading of the\nSavings Plan. While employees were able to choose which fund\nto invest their assets in, the Savings Plan makes clear that its\nassets are aggregated and are held in trust by the Savings Plan\ntrustees at all times. The District Court’s reliance on Russell and\nits progeny in support of its holding in this particular case was,\ntherefore, misplaced.\n\n\n      The Defendants cite the Ninth Circuit’s decision in\nHoran v. Kaiser Steel Retirement Plan, 947 F.2d 1412 (9th Cir.\n1991), in support of their argument that the Plaintiffs’ cause of\n\n\n                                31\n\faction in this case should be dismissed because the remedies\nthey seek are for their own benefit, and not on behalf of the\nSavings Plan. In Horan, former employees of Kaiser Steel\nsought to force it to use plan assets in order to purchase\nannuities for the benefit of each former employee. Id. at 1415.\nThe Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiffs could not state a claim\nbecause “[t]he remedies sought by the plaintiffs are for their\nown benefit, and not for the benefit of the Plan. The objective of\nthe plaintiffs’ suit is to recover an annuity for each individual\nplaintiff.” Id. at 1418.\n\n\n        Horan is easily distinguishable from this case. Unlike the\nplaintiffs in Horan, the Plaintiffs in this case do not seek to\nforce the Savings Plan to purchase annuities for their individual\nbenefit. Instead, they seek to force the Defendants to make\npayments to the Savings Plan for the Defendants’ alleged failure\nto fulfill their fiduciary obligations, in order to remedy the\ndamage their actions caused to the Savings Plan. The fact that\ndamages paid to the Savings Plan for breaches of fiduciary\nduties will also indirectly benefit its participants does not bar a\nderivative action under §§ 1109 and 1132(a)(2). Smith v.\nSydnor, 184 F.3d 356, 363 (4th Cir. 1999).\n\n\n      We are persuaded that the District Court erred in\nconcluding that the complaint fails to state a claim on behalf of\nthe Savings Plan pursuant to §1109.\n\n\n                                32\n\f                                 B\n\n\n       The Defendants contend that the “individualized nature”\nof Plaintiffs’ claims is reflected in the fact that the consolidated\ncomplaint “expressly excludes all Plan participants currently\nemployed by Schering” in the class definition. While this\nstatement is literally true, it seems to us more likely than not that\nthe referenced allegation was inadvertent, given the other\nallegations of the complaint making it clear that this action was\nbrought for the ultimate benefit of “[a]ll persons who were\nparticipants in . . . the Plan at any time [during the class period],\nand whose accounts included investments in Schering stock.”\nApp. at 67. Compare Complaint paragraph 62, App. at 67, with\nparagraph 3, App. at 48 (“Defendants, as fiduciaries of the Plan,\nbreached their duties to [the Plaintiffs] and to other participants\nand beneficiaries of the Plan . . . particularly with regard to\nholdings of Schering stock.”) At this point, however, any\nambiguity thus created is not significant8 and can be clarified by\namendment on remand.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          The District Court has yet to address the propriety of\nthis suit being maintained as a class action and we, of course\nexpress no view thereon.\n\n                                 33\n\f                                III\n\n\n       In their motion to dismiss, the Defendants requested that\nthe District Court dismiss the action on the merits because the\nPlaintiffs failed to allege facts showing a breach of duty by any\nof the fiduciaries named in the consolidated complaint. The\nDistrict Court expressly declined to determine the merits of\nPlaintiffs’ allegations that the Defendants breached their\nfiduciary duties, or whether the counts against Mr. Kogan\nshould be dismissed “because the complaint failed to allege that\nMr. Kogan performed any specific fiduciary acts.”\n\n\n       The issues raised by the Defendants regarding the merits\nof the claims of breaches of fiduciary duties involve complex\nlegal and factual questions. This matter was dismissed for lack\nof standing prior to the filing of an answer, or any other pre-trial\nproceedings. We decline to review the merits of the Defendants’\nalternative bases for dismissing this action because “the record\nas presented to us is not sufficiently adequate for us to give the\ncareful and thoughtful consideration these issues merit. Since\nthe case must go back to the District Court, we think these issues\nwould benefit from further elaboration there in the first\ninstance.” Callahan v. A.E.V., Inc., 182 F.3d 237, 249 (3d Cir.\n1999). Additional discovery proceedings and possible\namendments to the pleadings may clarify the issues should\nfurther appellate review become necessary to finally dispose of\n\n\n                                34\n\fthis matter.\n\n\n                           Conclusion\n\n\n       We conclude that the District Court erred in dismissing\nthis action on the sole ground that the Plaintiffs failed to state a\nclaim under § 1109 on behalf of the Savings Plan. Accordingly,\nwe reverse the judgment dismissing this action with prejudice\nand remand with instructions to the District Court to conduct\nfurther proceedings regarding the merits of the claims asserted\nin the consolidated complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                35\n\f",

We conclude that the\nPlaintiffs may seek money damages on behalf of the fund,\nnotwithstanding the fact the alleged fiduciary violations affected\nonly a subset of the saving plan’s participants.\n\n\n      Accordingly, we will reverse and remand for further\nproceedings.\n\n\n                                I\n\n\n                                A\n\n\n       The complaint alleges the following facts. Jingdong Zhu\nand Adrian Fields (the Plaintiffs) are former employees of\nSchering-Plough Corporation (“Schering”). During their\nemployment with Schering, the Plaintiffs elected to participate\nin the Schering-Plough Employees’ Savings Plan (“the Savings\nPlan” or “the Plan”). Under the Savings Plan, a Schering\n\n\n                                5\n\femployee agreed to reduce his or her take-home compensation\nin order to invest that amount in one or more investment funds\non a pre-tax basis 1 . The Savings Plan authorized a participant to\nselect from different investment funds. One of the investment\nfunds was the Schering Plan Company Stock Fund (“the\nCompany Stock Fund”), which consisted of company stock.\nUnder the Savings Plan, a participant was not permitted to invest\nmore than 50% of his or her future contributions in Schering\nstock. Some of the Plaintiffs’ deferred compensation included\nan investment in the Company Stock Fund.\n\n\n      As of December 31, 2001, Schering stock made up\napproximately 31% of the value of the Saving Plan’s assets.\nMore than 60% of the employees who participated in the Saving\n\n\n       1\n          An employee who participates in a deferred\ncompensation plan to save for retirement qualifies for tax\nbenefits pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 401(k). The type of deferred\ncompensation plan offered to Schering employees is referred to\nin ERISA as an “individual account plan” or a “defined\ncontribution plan.” 29 U.S.C. § 1002(34). These terms refer to\n“a pension plan which provides for an individual account for\neach participant and for benefits based solely upon the amount\ncontributed to the participant’s account, and any income,\nexpenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts of\nother participants which may be allocated to such participant’s\naccount.” Id.\n\n                                6\n\fPlan had at least some of their assets allocated to the Company\nStock Fund. In fiscal year 2001 the loss in the value of Schering\nstock constituted 87% of the drop in value of the Saving Plan’s\nassets, and in 2002 the loss in Schering’s stock’s value\nconstituted 50% of the Saving Plan’s net loss. The loss to the\nSavings Plan was approximately $138,000,000. By June of 2003\nthe price of Schering stock had fallen below $20 per share from\na class-period high of better than $60 a share.\n\n\n                               B\n\n\n      On October 6, 2003, the Plaintiffs filed this class action\npursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2) on behalf of the Savings Plan\nand “[a]ll persons who were participants in or beneficiaries of\nthe Saving Plan at any time between July 29, 1998 and the\npresent (the ‘Class Period’), and whose accounts included\ninvestments in Schering stock.” The complaint named as\ndefendants and as fiduciaries of the Savings Plan Schering,\nRichard Kogan, its former CEO, members of the Schering\nBoard’s Pension Committee, the Schering-Plough Employees\nBenefits Committee and one of its members, the Schering-\nPlough Benefits Investment Committee and three of its\nmembers, the counsel of the Investment Committee, and\nVanguard Group, Inc., the Trustee of the Savings Plan\n(collectively “the Defendants”).\n\n\n\n                               7\n\f       The complaint alleges that the Defendants breached their\nfiduciary duties of prudence, care, and loyalty by continuing to\noffer the Company Stock Fund as one of the Savings Plan\nalternatives when they knew that Schering’s stock price was\nunlawfully and artificially inflated. Additionally, the Plaintiffs\nalleged that the Defendants failed to disclose negative material\ninformation about Schering, which induced participants in the\nSavings Plan to elect to invest in the Company Stock Fund. The\ncomplaint also alleges that some of the Defendants did not\nloyally serve the Saving Plan participants by taking steps to\navoid a conflict of interest such as making appropriate public\ndisclosures, divesting the Savings Plan of Schering stock,\ndiscontinuing further investments in Schering stock, consulting\nindependent fiduciaries, or resigning as Savings Plan fiduciaries.\n\n\n       In lieu of answering the complaint, the Defendants filed\na motion to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim under\n§ 1109(a).2 The Defendants argued that “[b]ecause [Section\n\n\n\n       2\n         29 U.S.C. § 1109 reads as follows:\n       Liability for breach of fiduciary duty\n       (a) Any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan\n       who breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or\n       duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this title shall be\n       personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to\n       the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore\n\n                                8\n\f1109(a)] authorizes relief only for ‘the plan’, a participant can\nstate a claim only if he proceeds in a representative capacity on\nbehalf of ‘the plan as a whole’ and seeks to recover for all plan\nparticipants allegedly injured by the fiduciary breach.”\n(Emphasis in the original.). In addition, they asserted that the\nPlaintiffs do not seek relief on behalf of the Plan as a whole\nbecause the complaint allegedly excludes current employees\nwho were part of the sub-group that invested in the Company\nStock Fund.\n\n\n       They further maintained that the consolidated complaint\nimproperly seeks “individual relief for each Plan participant”\nbecause it prays for “an allocation ‘among the Participants’\nindividualized accounts in proportion to the accounts’ losses.’”\n(Emphasis added in the Defendants’ motion.). Finally, the\nDefendants contended that the Plaintiffs failed to allege facts\n\n\n       to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have\n       been made through use of assets of the plan by the\n       fiduciary, and shall be subject to such other equitable or\n       remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate,\n       including removal of such fiduciary. A fiduciary may\n       also be removed for a violation of 29 USCS § 1111.\n       (b) No fiduciary shall be liable with respect to a breach\n       of fiduciary duty under this title if such breach was\n       committed before he became a fiduciary or after he\n       ceased to be a fiduciary.\n\n                               9\n\fshowing detrimental reliance by the Saving Plan’s participants\non the Defendants’ alleged misrepresentations and non-\ndisclosures.\n\n\n       The District Court granted the Defendant’s motion and\ndismissed the consolidated complaint with prejudice. It held that\nthe Plaintiffs lacked standing to prosecute this action under 29\nU.S.C. §§ 1109(a) and 1132(a)(2) 3 because the consolidated\ncomplaint alleges only “harm suffered by the individual Plan\nParticipants and not the Savings Plan, and seeks relief measured\nby the harm to individuals and tailored for the benefit of\nindividuals, and not the Savings Plan.” The District Court\nsummarized its conclusion in these words:\n\n\n              Even assuming that each defendant\n              is an ERISA fiduciary, that each of\n              plaintiffs’ allegations concerning\n              defendants’ conduct were true, and\n              that this conduct rose to a level to\n              breach ERISA’s fiduciary duties\n              (without the Court opining as to\n\n\n       3\n         29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2) reads as follows: “A civil action\nmay be brought . . . by the Secretary, or by a participant,\nbeneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section 1109\nof this title.”\n\n                               10\n\f              merits   of   these   assumptions),\n              plaintiffs cannot demonstrate how\n              any defendant would be “personally\n              liable for damages (‘to make good\n              to [the] plan any losses to the plan\n              resulting from each such breach’)”\n              to the Saving Plans because it is\n              only Plan Participants who might\n              be able to show that they suffered\n              individualized losses.\n\n\n       The District Court commented further that because\n“plaintiffs can point to no set of facts that would demonstrate\nlosses to the plan. . . . the Court need not reach defendants’\nfurther arguments in favor of dismissal.”\n\n\n       The Plaintiffs have timely appealed. The District Court\nhad subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 29 U.S.C. §\n1132(e)(1) of ERISA. This Court has appellate jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291, 1294(1).\n\n\n                               II\n\n\n                               A\n\n\n       The Plaintiffs contend that “[t]he district court erred in\n\n\n                               11\n\ffailing to distinguish between the plan-wide nature of the losses\ncaused by defendants’ fiduciary breaches, and the fact that the\nlosses caused by those breaches are reflected in the Plan’s\nindividual participant accounts.” They argue that the District\nCourt erred in concluding that their contributions were kept in\nseparate, segregated accounts and never became a part of the\nSaving Plan’s assets. Instead, the Plaintiffs maintain that the\nSavings Plan was a unitary trust that purchased and maintained\nstock in the Company Stock Fund, which was one of the\nfourteen investment alternatives in a defined contribution\nemployee benefit plan. The Plaintiffs also assert that the District\nCourt erred in determining that the Company Stock Fund was an\nindividual account plan and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan\n(“ESOP”).\n\n\n              We exercise de novo review over\n              the dismissal of claims under\n              Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n              12(b)(6).

Section 1109(a) makes plan\nfiduciaries “personally liable to make good to [the] plan any\nlosses to the plan resulting from each . . . breach” of fiduciary\nduty. 29 U.S.C. § 1109(a). And, finally, § 1132(a)(2) provides\nthat a “civil action may be brought . . . by a participant or\nbeneficiary . . . for appropriate relief under section 1109.” 29\nU.S.C. § 1109.\n\n\n       The issue presented here is whether the complaint states\na claim under § 1109 – i.e., whether the complaint seeks relief\nfor the Schering-Plough Employees’ Savings Plan based on\nallegations that there were “losses to the plan resulting from [a]\nbreach” of fiduciary duty. We believe it clearly does.\n\n\n                               13\n\f       The complaint alleges that “[a]s a consequence of the\ndefendants’ breaches [of fiduciary duty], the Plan suffered\nsignificant losses” and seeks “a monetary payment to the Plan to\nmake good to the Plan the losses to the Plan resulting from\n[those] breaches of fiduciary duty.” Section 1109 allows the\nPlan to recover “any losses” from a breach of fiduciary duty. 29\nU.S.C. § 1109 (emphasis added). The fiduciary’s liability is not\nlimited to plan “losses that will ultimately redound to the benefit\nof all participants.” The Plan held Schering-Plough stock as an\nasset and that asset was greatly reduced in value allegedly\nbecause of breaches of fiduciary duty. This clearly was a “loss”\nto the Plan within the meaning of § 1109.4\n\n\n       Just as the fact that the assets at issue were held for the\nultimate benefit of Plaintiffs does not alter the fact that they\nwere held by the Plan, so, too, the fact that Plaintiffs may have\nto show individual reliance on the defendants’ alleged\n\n       4\n          The Supreme Court did not hold otherwise in\nMassachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Russell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111499\"><a href=\"/opinion/111499/massachusetts-mut-life-ins-co-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985). While the Court did observe in that case that\n§ 1132(a)(2) actions seek remedies which provide a benefit “to\nthe plan as a whole,” the issue presented here was not before the\nCourt. Moreover, the recovery in this case would go to the Plan\nas a whole to be held in accordance with the terms of the plan,\nincluding the payment of operating expenses and the like, which\nwould redound to the benefit of all participants.\n\n                                14\n\fmisrepresentations to prevail on some claims does not mean they\ndo not seek recovery for Plan losses. As the Court aptly put it in\nIn re Honeywell Int’l ERISA Litigation, Civil No. 03-1214\n(D.N.J., June 14, 2004) at 30:\n\n\n       [L]osses to the Plan may have resulted from\n       decisions by individual participants, but that does\n       not mean that those losses were not losses of the\n       Plan; it simply means that some of the decision\n       making for Plan investments was conducted by\n       the participants who contributed to it.\n\n\n       It is a non sequitur to say, as the District Court did, that\nPlaintiffs cannot demonstrate any losses to the Plan because it\nis an “individual account plan which includes an ESOP\ninvestment alternative.” First, while the Plan is, indeed, an\n“individual account plan,” this does not preclude the Plan from\nhaving losses. Second, the Plan is not an “employee stock\nownership plan” or an “ESOP.” Under § 1107(d)(6)(A), an\n“employee stock ownership plan” is “designed to invest\nprimarily in qualifying employer securities.” 29 U.S.C. §\n1107(d)(6)(A). As this Court explained in Moench v. Robertson,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701747\"><a href=\"/opinion/701747/charles-moench-in-his-own-right-and-on-behalf-of-those-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 568 (3d Cir. 1995):\n\n\n       [ESOPs are] “device[s] for expanding the national\n       capital base among employees – an effective\n\n\n                                 15\n\f       merger of the roles of capitalist and worker.”\n       Donovan v. Cunningham, 716 F.2d at 1458. Thus,\n       the concept of employee ownership constituted a\n       goal in and of itself. To accomplish this end,\n       “Congress . . . enacted a number of laws designed\n       to encourage employers to set up such plans.” Id.\n\n\n      The Plan before us was designed to provide opportunities\nfor saving and investment. It was not designed to invest\nprimarily in securities of the employer. Indeed, the Plan was not\nrequired to offer Schering-Plough stock as one of its investment\nopportunities.\n\n\n       The District Court’s conclusions (1) that Plaintiffs’\ncontributions were never assets of the Savings Plan and never\naggregated, and (2) that Plaintiffs only seek damages for their\nindividualized losses, directly conflict with the express terms of\nthe Savings Plan as well as other allegations of the complaint.\n\n\n       The Savings Plan provides in Article 4.01(a) that\ncontributions to the Savings Plan\n\n\n                 shall be invested in one or more\n                 Investment Funds authorized by the\n                 Investment Committee, which,\n                 from time to time, may include\n\n\n                                16\n\f       such equity funds, international\n       equity funds, fixed income funds,\n       money market funds, a Company\n       Stock Fund, and other funds or\n       investm ent veh icles as the\n       Investment Committee elects to\n       offer.\n\n\nArticle 4.02 provides as follows:\n\n\n       A participant shall make one\n       investment election covering his or\n       her Accounts in accordance with\n       the following options:\n\n\n              (a) 100 percent in\n              one of the available\n              Investment Funds;\n\n\n              (b) in more than one\n              Investm e n t F u n d\n              allocated in multiples\n              of 1 percent;\n\n\n\n\n                       17\n\f      provided, however, that in no event\n      may a Participant allocate more\n      than 50 percent of future\n      contributions to the Company Stock\n      Fund. If a Participant fails to make\n      an investment election with respect\n      to 100 percent of his or her\n      Accounts, the portion of such\n      Accounts not subject to the\n      Participant’s investment election\n      shall be invested in a money market\n      fund or equivalent investment\n      vehicle.\n\n\nSection 4.03 reads as follows:\n\n\n      Each     Participant       is   solely\n      responsible for the selection of his\n      or her investment options. The\n      Trustee, the Committee, the\n      Investm e nt C o m m itte e , a ny\n      Employer, and the officers,\n      supervisors and other employees of\n      any Employer are not empowered\n      to advise a Participant as to the\n      manner in which his or her\n\n\n                       18\n\f       accounts shall be invested. The fact\n       that an Investment Fund is\n       available to Participants for\n       investment under the Plan shall not\n       be construed as a recommendation\n       for investment in that Investment\n       Fund.\n\n\nPursuant to Article 4.05,\n\n\n       [a]   participant        may   elect   to\n       reallocate his or her Accounts\n       among the Investment Funds, in\n       multiples of 1 percent, by giving\n       such Notice as the Committee or its\n       delegate shall prescribe; provided,\n       however, that in no event may a\n       Participant allocate more than 50\n       percent of the value of his or her\n       Accounts at the time of the\n       reallocation to the Company Stock\n       Fund. The reallocation shall be\n       effective     as    soon     as\n       administratively practicable after\n       the Trustee receives such Notice.\n\n\n\n                           19\n\f       Article 5.01 requires the trustee of the Savings Fund to\nvalue each of the Investment Funds each business day. “On each\nValuation Date there shall be allocated to the Accounts of each\nParticipant his or her proportionate share of the increase or\ndecrease in the fair market value of his or her Accounts in each\nof the Investment Funds.” Article 5.03 requires the trustee to\nfurnish each participant with a statement setting forth the value\nof his or her Accounts each calendar quarter.\n\n\n       Article 9.06 provides that until the accounts of a\nparticipant who is entitled to distribution because of the\ntermination of employment or after the 65th anniversary of the\nParticipant’s date of birth, are completely distributed, “the\nAccounts of a Participant who is entitled to a distribution shall\ncontinue to be invested as part of the funds of the Plan . . . .”\n\n\n       In Section 10.09, the Savings Plan provides that “[t]he\nCommittee or its delegate shall maintain, or cause to be\nmaintained, records showing the individual balances in each\nParticipant’s Accounts. However, maintenance of those records\nand Accounts shall not require any segregation of the funds of\nthe Plan.”\n\n\n       In Section 11.01, the Savings Plan provides that “[a]ll the\nfunds of the Plan shall be held by the Trustee appointed from\ntime to time by the Investment Committee or its delegate under\n\n\n                               20\n\fa trust agreement adopted, or as amended, by the Board of\nDirectors.”\n\n\n       Pursuant to Article 11.03, “Company Stock held by the\nTrustee shall be voted by the Trustee at each annual meeting and\nat each special meeting of stockholders of the Company as\ndirected by the Participant to whose Accounts such Company\nStock is credited.” (emphasis added).\n\n\n       Thus, contrary to the District Court’s interpretation of the\nprovisions of the Savings Plan, each participant’s deferred\npayroll compensation was held in trust as the assets of the\nSavings Plan. Each participant in the Savings Plan was provided\nwith an individualized account and periodically informed of the\nindividual balance in his or her account. The Savings Plan also\nmakes clear the fact that each participant has an individual\naccount does not “require any segregation of the funds of the\nPlan.” Article 10.09.\n\n\n      The District Court cited this Court’s decision in Moench\nin support of its determination that a plan that permits\nemployees to become part owners of their employer is an ESOP\nand not a traditional pension plan governed by ERISA. As noted\nabove, the Defendants have conceded that the Savings Plan we\nare considering is not an ESOP. In Moench, this Court held that\n“in limited circumstances, ESOP fiduciaries can be liable under\n\n\n                                21\n\fERISA for continuing to invest in employer stock according to\nthe plan’s direction . . . .” Id. at 556. It went on to say that\n“[w]hile fiduciaries of pension benefit plans generally must\ndiversify investments of the plan assets . . ., fiduciaries of\nESOPS are exempted from this duty.” Id. at 568. In reversing\nthe District Court’s holding that an ESOP cannot be held liable\nfor investing solely in employer common stock, this Court\nexplained that “an ESOP fiduciary who invests the assets in\nemployer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted\nconsistently with ERISA by virtue of that decision. However,\nthe plaintiff may overcome that presumption by establishing that\nthe fiduciary abused its decision by investing in employer\nsecurities.” Id. at 571. The principle announced in Moench has\nno application to the duty of a fiduciary of pension benefit plans\nto diversify investments “so as to minimize the risk of large\nlosses.” Id. at 568. “ESOPs, unlike pension plans, are not\nintended to guarantee retirement benefits, and indeed, by its very\nnature, ‘an ESOP places employee retirements assets at much\ngreater risk than does the typical diversified ERISA plan.’” Id.\nat 568. Because the Savings Plan in this case was not an ESOP,\nthe Moench decision does not resolve the issue presented in this\nmatter.\n\n\n      In a letter to this Court filed pursuant to Rule 28(j) of the\nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Defendants cited a\nrecent decision of the Fifth Circuit, Milofsky v. American\n\n\n                                22\n\fAirlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789895\"><a href=\"/opinion/789895/michael-milofsky-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-on-behalf-of-all-others/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2005) reh’g en banc\ngranted, No. 03-11087, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. App. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">15122</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, (5th Cir.\nJuly 19, 2005)5 in support of their argument that a participant\nlacks standing to bring an action on behalf of an individual\naccount pension plan if he or she does not seek plan-wide relief.\n\n\n       In Milofsky, the plaintiffs were employed as pilots by\nBusiness Express, Inc. (“BEX”) when it was acquired by AMR\nEagle Holding Corporation, the holding company of American\nEagle, Inc. (“American Eagle”). While employed by BEX, the\nplaintiffs participated in its individual account pension plan. Id.\nat 340. At the time of the acquisition of BEX, the plaintiffs were\ngiven notice that the balance of their accounts in the BEX plan\nwould be transferred to a comparable American Eagle 401k\nplan. The notices advised the plaintiffs when the transfers would\noccur. The transfers did not occur, however, until months after\nthe time written in the notice. Id. at 340-41.\n\n\n       The plaintiffs filed a class action against American\nAirlines and Towers Perrin, a benefits consulting firm hired by\nAmerican Airlines to render administrative services in\n\n\n       5\n       Fifth Circuit Rule 41.3 states that “[u]nless otherwise\nexpressly provided, the granting of a rehearing en banc vacates\nthe panel opinion and judgment of the court and stays the\nmandate.”\n\n                                23\n\fconnection with the plan. Id. at 340. The action, which was filed\nunder 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2), alleged that American Airlines\nand Towers Perrin had violated fiduciary duties in\nmisrepresenting how and when their accounts would be\ntransferred to the American Eagle 401(k) plan. Id. “They alleged\nthat because of the failure to effect the transfer of the class\nmembers’ account balances in a timely and prudent manner, the\nvalues of their accounts decreased because the assets remained\ninvested in the floundering BEX Plan longer than expected.” Id.\nat 341. The plaintiffs requested “actual damages to be paid to\nthe [American Eagle] $ uper $ aver Plan, to be allocated among\ntheir individual accounts proportionately to their losses resulting\nfrom the alleged breach.” Id.\n\n\n       The majority of the three-judge panel in Milofsky held\nthat “plaintiffs lack standing because this case in essence is\nabout an alleged particularized harm targeting a specific subset\nof plan beneficiaries, with claims for damages to benefits [sic]\nmembers of the subclass only, and not the plan generally.” Id. at\n347.\n\n\n       The facts in Milofsky are clearly distinguishable from\nthose in the matter sub judice. In Milofsky, the plaintiffs alleged\nthat the value of their investments in the BEX plan decreased\nbecause of the failure of the defendants to transfer the funds to\nthe American Eagle 401(k) plan. Id. at 351. Thus, this alleged\n\n\n                                24\n\floss occurred prior to the transfer of the BEX plan participants’\ninvestments to the American Eagle 401(k) plan. In Milofsky, the\nplaintiffs sought damages on behalf of the BEX plan members,\nand did not seek to restore assets of the American Eagle 401(k)\nfund. Here, the Plaintiffs seek damages from the fiduciaries for\ntheir violation of their duty to a subclass which had transferred\nits funds to the trustee of the Savings Fund.\n\n\n       In Kuper v. Iovenko, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705176\"><a href=\"/opinion/705176/19-employee-benefits-cas-1969-pens-plan-guide-p-23913r-glenn-kuper-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1995), the\nSixth Circuit held that a subset of employee benefit participants\nhas standing to bring an action for breach of fiduciary duty\nunder 29 U.S.C. §1109. The Court rejected the same argument\npresented by the Defendants in this matter that “an action under\n29 U.S.C. § 1109 must be brought on behalf of a plan as a whole\nand that a claim brought by a subclass of plan participants fails\nto satisfy this requirement.” Id. at 1452. The Sixth Circuit in\nKuper concluded that the plaintiffs had standing to bring this\naction pursuant to §1132(a)(2). Citing Moench, however, it\naffirmed the dismissal of the action on the merits, adopting this\nCourt’s rule that a fiduciary who invests in an employer’s stock\nis entitled to a rebuttable presumption that it acted consistently\nwith ERISA in continuing to invest in an employer’s securities.\nKuper, 66 F.3d at 1458-59. The Sixth Circuit affirmed because\nit concluded that the plaintiffs had failed “to rebut the\npresumption that defendants acted reasonably in continuing to\nhold Quantum stock.” Id. at 1459. In sum, the court concluded\n\n\n                               25\n\fin Kuper that § 1132(a)(2) does not authorize a plaintiff to\nrecover damages on his or her own behalf. Instead, a plaintiff\nmust seek to have the fiduciary reimburse the plan. Id. at 1453.6\n\n\n       6\n         At least one other circuit court, and several district\ncourts, have reached a similar conclusion. In Roth v.

Id. at 605. The court explained that the defendants’\nbreach of fiduciary duty resulted in two types of loss: individual\nloss to the beneficiaries, which is not actionable under Russell,\nand a loss to the plan, which is actionable under Section\n1132(a)(2), because the plan itself was also harmed due to the\nbreach.

Accordingly,\n                the majority’s holding goes far\n                beyond the holding of Russell.\n\n\nId. at 349 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\n\n\n          In footnote 4 of her opinion, Chief Judge King also\nstated:\n\n\n                The majority correctly notes that\n                Russell distinguishes between relief\n                for individuals and relief for the\n                plan as a whole. Majority Opinion,\n                [344-45]. Russell does not,\n                however, stand for the proposition\n                that the ‘plan as a whole’ is\n                synonymous with ‘all participants\n                of the plan,’ and several courts\n                have rejected this definition of the\n                ‘plan as a whole.’\n\n\nId. We agree with Chief Judge King’s interpretation of Russell,\nand decline to follow the majority’s opinion in Milofsky.\n\n\n          In Russell, the plaintiff was a beneficiary under two\n\n\n                                28\n\femployee health benefit plans funded by her employer and\ngoverned by ERISA. 473 U.S. at 136. She became disabled and\nreceived plan benefits until October 17, 1979. She requested\ninternal review of the termination decision. The plan\nadministrator reinstated her benefits on March 11, 1980, and she\nwas paid retroactive benefits in full. Id.\n\n\n      The plaintiff in Russell filed an action in state court\nseeking damages for mental and emotional distress under state\nlaw and ERISA claims resulting from the interruption of her\nbenefit payments, as well as punitive damages. Id. at 137. The\ndefendant removed the action to the District Court and moved\nfor summary judgment. The District Court granted the motion.\nIt held that the state-law claims were preempted by ERISA, and\nthat ERISA barred claims for extra-contractual and punitive\ndamages. Id. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s\ndetermination that the state law claims were pre-empted by\nERISA, but also concluded that the complaint alleged a cause of\naction under §1132(a)(2) and that punitive damages could be\nawarded. Id. at 138.\n\n\n       The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Ninth\nCircuit. It held that § 1109 does not authorize extracontractual\nor punitive damages. The Court also rejected the plaintiff’s\nargument that a private right of action for extracontractual\ndamages was implied in § 1109. Id. at 148. In rejecting the\n\n\n                                29\n\femployee’s claims, the Court stated that “[a] fair contextual\nreading of the statute makes it abundantly clear that its\ndraftsmen were primarily concerned with the possible misuse of\nplan assets, and with remedies that would protect the entire plan,\nrather than with the rights of an individual beneficiary.” Id. at\n142.\n\n\n      Unlike the circumstances presented in this matter, in\nRussell the plaintiff did not file a class action on behalf of an\nERISA employee benefits plan to require the defendants to pay\ndamages to the health benefit plan because of their alleged\nbreach of their fiduciary duty. Instead, she filed a private cause\nof action for extracontractual and punitive damages.7 The Court\ndid not hold in Russell that a subgroup of plan participants\ncannot file derivative action on behalf of an ERISA employee\nbenefits plan if the fiduciaries’ alleged breach did not affect the\ninvestments of participants in other subgroups. That issue\nsimply was not before the Court.\n\n\n      The District Court relied in part on Russell and its\nprogeny in holding that\n\n\n\n\n       7\n        Thus, Russell involved an action brought by one\nindividual who erroneously sought to recover extra contractual\ndamages under ERISA.\n\n                                30\n\f              [a]lthough individual employees’\n              contributions          were never\n              aggregated and         all employees\n              remained capable of investing on\n              an individualized basis, plaintiffs\n              now seek to theoretically aggregate\n              these individualized losses into\n              losses by “the plan.” Such an\n              after-the-fact aggregation by\n              individuals in order to sue on\n              behalf of the plan is not permitted\n              under the language of Sections\n              1104, 1109 or, most importantly\n              1132(a)(2).\n\n\nThe District Court based this holding on its misreading of the\nSavings Plan. While employees were able to choose which fund\nto invest their assets in, the Savings Plan makes clear that its\nassets are aggregated and are held in trust by the Savings Plan\ntrustees at all times. The District Court’s reliance on Russell and\nits progeny in support of its holding in this particular case was,\ntherefore, misplaced.\n\n\n      The Defendants cite the Ninth Circuit’s decision in\nHoran v. Kaiser Steel Retirement Plan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571120\"><a href=\"/opinion/571120/robert-patrick-horan-and-jonnie-s-koch-v-kaiser-steel-retirement-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n1991), in support of their argument that the Plaintiffs’ cause of\n\n\n                                31\n\faction in this case should be dismissed because the remedies\nthey seek are for their own benefit, and not on behalf of the\nSavings Plan. In Horan, former employees of Kaiser Steel\nsought to force it to use plan assets in order to purchase\nannuities for the benefit of each former employee. Id. at 1415.\nThe Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiffs could not state a claim\nbecause “[t]he remedies sought by the plaintiffs are for their\nown benefit, and not for the benefit of the Plan. The objective of\nthe plaintiffs’ suit is to recover an annuity for each individual\nplaintiff.” Id. at 1418.\n\n\n        Horan is easily distinguishable from this case. Unlike the\nplaintiffs in Horan, the Plaintiffs in this case do not seek to\nforce the Savings Plan to purchase annuities for their individual\nbenefit. Instead, they seek to force the Defendants to make\npayments to the Savings Plan for the Defendants’ alleged failure\nto fulfill their fiduciary obligations, in order to remedy the\ndamage their actions caused to the Savings Plan. The fact that\ndamages paid to the Savings Plan for breaches of fiduciary\nduties will also indirectly benefit its participants does not bar a\nderivative action under §§ 1109 and 1132(a)(2). Smith v.\nSydnor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765250\"><a href=\"/opinion/765250/n-glenn-smith-for-himself-and-all-plan-participants-similarly-situated-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 363 (4th Cir. 1999).\n\n\n      We are persuaded that the District Court erred in\nconcluding that the complaint fails to state a claim on behalf of\nthe Savings Plan pursuant to §1109.\n\n\n                                32\n\f                                 B\n\n\n       The Defendants contend that the “individualized nature”\nof Plaintiffs’ claims is reflected in the fact that the consolidated\ncomplaint “expressly excludes all Plan participants currently\nemployed by Schering” in the class definition. While this\nstatement is literally true, it seems to us more likely than not that\nthe referenced allegation was inadvertent, given the other\nallegations of the complaint making it clear that this action was\nbrought for the ultimate benefit of “[a]ll persons who were\nparticipants in . . . the Plan at any time [during the class period],\nand whose accounts included investments in Schering stock.”\nApp. at 67. Compare Complaint paragraph 62, App. at 67, with\nparagraph 3, App. at 48 (“Defendants, as fiduciaries of the Plan,\nbreached their duties to [the Plaintiffs] and to other participants\nand beneficiaries of the Plan . . . particularly with regard to\nholdings of Schering stock.”) At this point, however, any\nambiguity thus created is not significant8 and can be clarified by\namendment on remand.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          The District Court has yet to address the propriety of\nthis suit being maintained as a class action and we, of course\nexpress no view thereon.\n\n                                 33\n\f                                III\n\n\n       In their motion to dismiss, the Defendants requested that\nthe District Court dismiss the action on the merits because the\nPlaintiffs failed to allege facts showing a breach of duty by any\nof the fiduciaries named in the consolidated complaint. The\nDistrict Court expressly declined to determine the merits of\nPlaintiffs’ allegations that the Defendants breached their\nfiduciary duties, or whether the counts against Mr. Kogan\nshould be dismissed “because the complaint failed to allege that\nMr. Kogan performed any specific fiduciary acts.”\n\n\n       The issues raised by the Defendants regarding the merits\nof the claims of breaches of fiduciary duties involve complex\nlegal and factual questions. This matter was dismissed for lack\nof standing prior to the filing of an answer, or any other pre-trial\nproceedings. We decline to review the merits of the Defendants’\nalternative bases for dismissing this action because “the record\nas presented to us is not sufficiently adequate for us to give the\ncareful and thoughtful consideration these issues merit. Since\nthe case must go back to the District Court, we think these issues\nwould benefit from further elaboration there in the first\ninstance.” Callahan v. A.E.V., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765006\"><a href=\"/opinion/765006/michael-w-callahan-perry-beer-inc-peter-g-petousis-norman-bernardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 249 (3d Cir.\n1999). Additional discovery proceedings and possible\namendments to the pleadings may clarify the issues should\nfurther appellate review become necessary to finally dispose of\n\n\n                                34\n\fthis matter.\n\n\n                           Conclusion\n\n\n       We conclude that the District Court erred in dismissing\nthis action on the sole ground that the Plaintiffs failed to state a\nclaim under § 1109 on behalf of the Savings Plan. Accordingly,\nwe reverse the judgment dismissing this action with prejudice\nand remand with instructions to the District Court to conduct\nfurther proceedings regarding the merits of the claims asserted\nin the consolidated complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                35\n\f</pre>",
