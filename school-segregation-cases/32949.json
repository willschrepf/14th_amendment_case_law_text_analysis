We affirm the judgments.\n                                          FACTS\n                                              I\n                                 PROSECUTION EVIDENCE\n       On March 22, 2008, Tommy and Eloisa Gonzales were married in Turlock.2\nRoger Villanueva, whose nickname was “Smoke da Villain,” was one of the groomsmen.\nHis girlfriend, Irma Bernal, was a bridesmaid. Members of the wedding party wore red\nand white. The wedding reception was held at the Grange Hall in Hilmar. More than\n100 people attended. In keeping with the wedding party‟s color scheme, the color red\npredominated in their clothing. Entertainment at the reception included a group of\nEloisa‟s friends who called themselves Spit Flame and who rapped and sang. Villanueva\nand Rene Zarate (“Bullet G”) were among the group‟s members.3\n1      All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n2      Except as otherwise specified, references to dates in the statement of facts are to\nthe year 2008.\n       For the sake of clarity, and because sometimes last names were not given, we refer\nto several persons by their first names. No disrespect is intended.\n3       One of the group‟s founders Moses Rodriguez (“Rap Addict”), had been shot and\nkilled in the “Woods” area of Turlock about a year earlier. Eloisa was godmother to his\nson.\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f       Defendants (who are brothers) did not attend the wedding, but were present at the\nreception. They did not get along with Zarate or Villanueva. Miguel Perez, a good\nfriend of Eloisa and Villanueva, also attended the reception. Perez‟s status with the\nNorteño gang was “inactive.” He had “just kind of walked away from it” 10 to 15 years\nearlier, creating friction between him and gang members. He had had prior verbal\nconfrontations with Gutierrez because of it. He had not had any confrontations with\nSaldana. Perez also had personal issues with Gutierrez that went back a number of years\nand were not gang related.\n       At some point, defendants were yelling at Chico, Perez‟s friend, on the front lawn\nof the Grange Hall. Perez went to get Chico to take him across the street to a bar. Perez\nalso tried to put his hand out and tell them to “squash” all the problems, but Gutierrez\nlooked at him and laughed. Perez and Gutierrez then exchanged blows. Gutierrez fell\nback after Perez struck him. Meanwhile, Saldana was standing behind Perez, and there\nwere several people hitting Perez from behind. Someone — Perez thought Villanueva,\nalthough he did not see who threw the punch — knocked Saldana out. Tommy was\nyelling at Gutierrez and Perez, and Perez told Gutierrez they would see each other when\nthey saw each other.4\n       About four days after the wedding, Villanueva and Bernal moved to Arizona.\nSometime during that four days, they were driving near the Turlock Cemetery when they\nsaw Saldana, who was alone, driving the opposite direction. He stopped the car, pointed\nat Villanueva, and made a gun gesture with his hands. Villanueva told Bernal “they”\nwere looking for him, although he did not say who.\n\n\n\n\n4      Near the end of the reception, there was a fight involving Tommy, some of his\ngroomsmen, and about 50 people in the bar‟s parking lot. Defendants had already left by\nthe time this fight broke out.\n\n\n\n                                             3.\n\f       Jorge Tapia was defendants‟ second cousin. He grew up in the Angelus Street\narea of Turlock and, as of May 25, resided in the area of Angelus and Ninth Street. He\nknew of the Norteño gang, which claimed red and whose members sometimes had tattoos\nsuch as “XIV” and “X4.” Tapia sometimes socialized with persons who “claim[ed]\nNorteño,” but he denied being a gang member himself.\n       About a week before May 25, Gutierrez gave Tapia an item wrapped in cloth and\nasked him to hold it for him. Gutierrez did not say anything about a gun or tell Tapia\nwhat the item was. Although it felt heavy and hard, Tapia did not unwrap it to see what it\nwas, but put it in a shoebox in his room and left it there.5\n       Around the same time, Villanueva and Bernal returned to Villanueva‟s mother‟s\nhouse in Keyes. They planned to return to Arizona the week following May 25.\n       On May 25, Gutierrez telephoned Tapia and asked him for “that thing.” An hour\nor so later, Gutierrez came by Tapia‟s residence in his white Nissan Altima. Saldana was\nwith him. Both were wearing blue pants and black shirts. Tapia met them at the car and\ngave Gutierrez the wrapped item, then got into the back seat. Gutierrez said they were\ngoing to go check out some shoes “from Tommy.”6 Villanueva‟s name was not brought\nup, and nobody said anything about what had happened at the wedding reception. Before\nthe car pulled away, however, Saldana said maybe somebody would get in a fight.\n       Around 6:00 p.m. on May 25, Eloisa attended a barbecue at her friend Brandy‟s\nresidence, a duplex in the 200 block of Angelus Street. The barbecue was being held\nbecause it was Moses Rodriguez‟s birthday. About 20 people had met up at the cemetery\n\n\n\n5      Detective Bertram and Investigator Bunch of the district attorney‟s office\ninterviewed Tapia some two to three weeks after May 25. During the interview, Tapia\nmade it clear he knew Gutierrez had given him a gun. Tapia said it was a .40-caliber\nGlock with a red laser sight.\n6      Tommy sold knockoff Michael Jordan tennis shoes.\n\n\n\n                                              4.\n\fwhere he was buried, then gone to the house on Angelus. Villanueva was one of those at\nthe cemetery.\n       Eloisa went to the grocery store, then returned to the duplex. By the time she got\nback, more people — including defendants — had arrived. They and at least seven\npeople were standing against the fence of an abandoned house next to the duplexes.\nDefendants both were wearing black T-shirts. Gutierrez had on a hat. A chunky,\nHispanic male appeared to be in their company.\n       Villanueva and Darnell Lambert drove up and parked across the street, then\nwalked up to the group of men. Villanueva told Saldana that he wanted to “squash it” (let\nit go) and did not want any problems with “them,” but, when Villanueva extended his\nhand, Saldana refused to shake it. Eloisa saw the look on Saldana‟s face; it was angry\nand he was grinding his teeth. He stayed like that until he turned away. Villanueva —\nwho was considerably larger than Saldana — followed him to the backyard of the\nabandoned house. None of the other men went with them. As Villanueva went toward\nthe back, he took off his Oakland A‟s hat and jacket (underneath which he was wearing a\nwhite T-shirt) and hung them on the fence. He also removed a thick chain with a cross\nthat he wore all the time. Eloisa did not see where he put it.\n       Concerned, Eloisa yelled at Lambert to do something, and not to let them go to the\nback. Lambert responded that it was going to be fine, as they were just going to talk out\nwhatever it was. Eloisa then yelled for Tommy. Tommy was at his father‟s house, which\nwas on the other side of the abandoned house.7 He came out onto the front porch and\ntold Lambert to go back there.\n       Meanwhile, Gutierrez was pacing quickly back and forth by the fence. Saldana\nand Villanueva moved out of Eloisa‟s sight. While Lambert was responding to Tommy,\nGutierrez ran to the back. Eloisa lost sight of him, then, within seconds, she heard\n7      The abandoned house was between Brandy‟s duplex and Tommy‟s father‟s house.\n\n\n\n                                             5.\n\fmultiple gunshots fired in rapid succession from a single gun. As soon as the shots\nstopped, she saw defendants run down Angelus Street. She ran toward the back and\nfound Villanueva bleeding to death on the ground.\n      Eloisa did not think the shooting was gang related. She did not see anyone flash\ngang signs or any indication of gang activity. She was aware that the color red was\nassociated with Norteños. She was also aware defendants were members of Varrio West\nSide Turlock or Turlocos, a Norteño gang that claimed the color red and number 14.\nEloisa denied Tommy was a Norteño; she chose red accents for her wedding colors\nbecause Tommy‟s birthstone is red garnet.\n      At approximately 6:10 p.m. on May 25, Turlock police received a report of the\nshooting. Sergeant Morgan and Officer Ramon were the first to respond, arriving at the\nscene within a minute or two of being dispatched. At least 50 to 70 hostile people were\nin the street, yelling and pointing toward the back of an apartment complex. In the back\nwere a few people and Villanueva, who appeared to be dead.\n      Eloisa was angry and yelling that it was not right. Morgan made contact with her,\nbut Tommy tried to hush her and told her that she did not see anything. Morgan tried to\ntalk to Tommy, but Tommy said he did not see anything. Tommy said he and Eloisa had\nbeen inside his father‟s home next door.\n      Morgan had had prior dealings with Tommy and considered him a gangster. From\nworking in the area for 20 years, Morgan considered Angelus Street in this part of town\nto be the heart of Turlock‟s gang area. Morgan was also familiar with the “Woods,” a\npart of Turlock in which many of the street names ended with “wood.” He believed, but\nwas not positive, it was Sureño territory. Morgan was familiar with the Moses Rodriguez\nhomicide. No one was ever apprehended; it was deemed at the time possibly to be self-\ndefense.\n      An autopsy revealed multiple bullet wounds, including five entrance wounds, to\nVillanueva‟s body. Some were from front to back, while others were from back to front.\n\n                                            6.\n\fOne bullet, which entered the right side of the head, was found inside the brain.\nAbrasions surrounding the bullet hole indicated it was likely a close-range shot. Another\nbullet entered the left side of the neck and struck the mandible. Fragments of that bullet\nwere located in the body. Another bullet was located near the pelvic bone area. The\ngunshot wound to the head was fatal, while the wounds to the left side of the back and\nleft side of the hip could also have been fatal. It was not possible to determine in which\norder the wounds were received, or the position Villanueva was in at the time he received\nthem. Similarly, the gun‟s position when any given shot was fired could not be\ndetermined. The cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds. Toxicology reports\nrevealed small amounts of alcohol, cocaine, MDMA (Ecstasy), and methamphetamine in\nVillanueva‟s system. Cocaine and methamphetamine are stimulants that can cause some\nusers to become aggressive.\n       Thirteen spent .40-caliber shell casings were found at the scene, as were five\nexpended bullets.8 Subsequent examination showed the shell casings were all fired from\nthe same firearm, most likely a Glock pistol. Subsequent analysis of the fired projectiles\nshowed they were .40 caliber, and the rifling was consistent with the standard rifling of a\n.40-caliber Glock pistol.\n       On the night of May 29, the white Nissan involved in the shooting was found in\nSan Jose, partially burned and smelling of a gasolinelike accelerant. A singed black\nbeanie cap was found about 25 feet from the vehicle. Subsequent testing showed\nGutierrez to be the major contributor to DNA found on the hat. When Gutierrez was\nbrought to the Turlock Police Department following his arrest, he complained that his\narm was hurting and said he burned it when he was barbecuing. At the hospital,\n\n\n\n8      One of the bullets was lying on the ground, while the others were recovered from\nwalls of buildings and other nearby objects.\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\fhowever, he told the doctor the burn was from gasoline. His face also appeared to have\nbeen burned.\n         Tapia assisted the police in locating defendants in North Highlands. Gutierrez‟s\nidentification, and the Nissan‟s registration and key were found at the same location\n         On August 15, there was a fight between Manuel Nunez and Steven Ramirez, two\ninmates housed in the SHU at the Stanislaus County Public Safety Center (jail).9 As a\nresult, their cell was searched. Two large rolls of wilas were found.10 The wilas were\nturned over to Paul Teso, a gang expert in the Classification Unit. Teso had worked as a\ngang officer for more than 11 years. His expertise came from interviewing hundreds of\nsuspected and admitted gang members, as well as classes he took on gangs in general and\nStanislaus County gangs in particular.\n         Teso explained that if an inmate coming into custody claims gang membership, he\nis housed with the gang with which he claims affiliation. For inmate protection and\nsecurity, Norteño gang members are segregated from the general population and from\nmembers of other criminal street gangs.\n         There is a Norteño chain of command at the jail. The lowest level is yard security.\nThis inmate is in charge of security out in the yard, and makes sure Norteño inmates\n“program” on the yard the same way they would in prison. Next is the teacher, who is in\ncharge of education. Norteño gang members have mandatory training an hour a day.\nThe training covers a variety of topics, including writing wilas. The next level is the\ngroup leader. He is in charge of a particular cell in which a group of Norteño inmates are\nhoused. Next is tier security. He is in charge of a group of cells on a tier. Next is the\n\n9        The SHU is the jail‟s maximum security housing unit. Many Norteños are housed\nthere.\n10     A wila is microwriting — a small written note — used by prisoners (usually gang\nmembers) to communicate with each other, and with those in other custodial facilities and\nout on the streets, without jail personnel being privy to the communication.\n\n\n\n                                              8.\n\fchannel, who usually has communication to the streets. The highest person at the county\nlevel is the overall, who is in charge of all three county facilities.\n       The “14 Bonds” are rules and regulations used by the Norteños to keep everyone\nin line. Norteños take the 14 Bonds and household policies (which vary, depending upon\nthe facility) “very seriously, serious [enough] to kill for.” A Norteño who does not\nfollow the rules is “subject to discipline up to death.” Fear and intimidation are how\nNorteños keep each other in check; someone not following the rules is subject to\ndiscipline at the discretion of the person in charge. A removal occurs when an inmate is\nno longer welcome in the gang due to his rule violation(s), and so his face will be sliced\nto leave a scar. No matter where he goes within any custodial facility, a background\ncheck will be done to determine why he was removed.\n       Once an active Norteño gang member is booked into the jail, he will be placed “on\nfreeze.” This means he cannot hold any position, no information is supposed to be\nfiltered through him, he is not supposed to have access to wilas, and he cannot participate\nin education or exercises or program with the active Norteños. The rules of the gang\nrequire that the new arrival report his incarceration to the gang higher-ups by filling out a\nnew arrival questionnaire, which is given to the group leader and from there moves up the\nchain of command. This allows the gang to do a security check by channeling the\ninformation from the questionnaire to the streets and prisons, to find out if there is any\nnegative information about the new arrival. If the information shows anything for which\nthe new arrival could be removed and he was not cleared, then the new arrival will be\nassaulted or even killed. The new arrival will be on freeze until the security check is run\nand he is cleared and in good standing.\n       A Norteño dropout is supposed to be assaulted (with weapons, if available) and\neven killed on sight. A dropout is considered a degenerate who is worse than a child\nmolester. If an active member knows someone to be a dropout and has access to that\nperson, the active member is to assault the dropout. If an inmate is labeled a degenerate,\n\n                                               9.\n\fthis shows he was once a Norteño gang member and has stepped away from the\norganization. To a Norteño, a Norteño dropout is probably the worst thing someone can\nbe. If an active gang member associates with a dropout (something that does not happen\nin custody, but does occur out on the streets) and is identified by another active member\nas doing so, the person who was associating with the dropout will have to explain why he\ndid so and will usually have to “put in work” to clear himself and get back in the\norganization‟s good graces. Coming to the aid of a dropout who was fighting with an\nactive Norteño would be a very severe rule violation, because it would be considered\naiding the enemy “against your homeboys.”\n       “Red-on-red violence” refers to when a Norteño assaults another active Norteño.\nIt is not activity that is sanctioned by the gang, as Norteños are supposed to stick\ntogether. Red-on-red crime is seen as weakening the organization. Accordingly, in order\nfor a Norteño to remove another active Norteño, he has to have clearance from higher up\nthe chain of command. If he removes or assaults another active Norteño without\nclearance, he himself will be subject to removal. In Teso‟s experience, if there is red-on-\nred violence that is not cleared beforehand or sanctioned from above, the people\nresponsible will have to write a report and explain their actions. That information will\nget channeled to the prisons, and the prison shotcallers will determine if the perpetrators\nwill remain in good standing in the gang. If it is determined the removal was a bad one,\nthe perpetrators will be disciplined for their actions and possibly removed themselves.\n       Insofar as the wilas seized following the fight were concerned, Teso knew Steven\nRamirez to be tier security of the east quarters of the county jail. The east quarters\nhoused Norteños. Manuel Nunez was the overall, meaning the person in charge, or shot\ncaller, of all three county facilities.\n       Two new arrival questionnaires were among the 60-plus wilas related to this case.\nOne was written from “Tito” to “La Casa,” which refers to the stronghold or household of\nthe Norteños. It was dated June 14; defendants were both booked into the jail on June 12,\n\n                                             10.\n\fand it generally takes a day for a new arrival to complete and submit a new arrival\nquestionnaire. The wila gave information such as full name, booking number, date of\nbirth, physical description, and tattoos, all of which corresponded to the information Teso\nhad about Saldana. As of June 14, Saldana was an active Norteño; however, as with all\nnew arrivals, he was placed on freeze. Teso surmised he was cleared not long after his\narrival, because Teso found his name on an active tier roster, which is a list of all active\nNorteño gang members in custody and where they are housed. As of March 2011, when\nTeso testified, Saldana was still housed with the active Norteños, which would not have\nbeen the case if officers had received information he was in bad standing and subject to\nremoval.\n       The other wila, which was dated June 15, was also addressed to La Casa. It gave a\nname, nickname (“Ramo”), date of birth, booking number, physical description, and\ntattoos, all of which corresponded to the information Teso had about Gutierrez.\n       In the wilas, defendants both gave their town as Turlock, and their “hood” as\nVWST, meaning Varrio West Side Turlock. Neither wila stated what happened in the\nbackyard with respect to Villanueva. During his career, however, Teso had reviewed\nthousands of wilas written by Norteños, and he had never read one in which the gang\nmember confessed to the crime that put him in custody.\n       According to Teso, fear and intimidation are “hallmarks” of the Norteño criminal\nstreet gang. They keep their members in line through fear and intimidation on the streets\nand in the neighborhoods, plus citizens are reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement\nbecause of fear of retaliation from the gang. Fear and intimidation create a reputation for\nthe gang, and the gang benefits because the fear and intimidation allow gang members to\ncarry on with their criminal activity. Reputation is important for a gang, as it intimidates\nother gangs and allows the gang to establish control over a specific area, for example, for\ndrug sales, while making it less likely a rival gang will attempt to infringe on that area.\nFear and intimidation among the ranks of Norteños benefits the gang as a whole, because\n\n                                             11.\n\fall members benefit from the gang‟s reputation, even in prison. If a gang is known in the\nprison system as being weak, it will be victimized by other gangs. If a gang has a strong\nreputation, it will be easier for that gang to recruit new gang members and build the gang\nstronger in numbers.\n         Investigator Froilan Mariscal of the district attorney‟s office also testified as a\ngang expert. He had been raised in Modesto and exposed to the Norteño criminal street\ngang from childhood. He had training and experience with respect to Hispanic gangs,\nprimarily Norteños and Sureños.\n         Mariscal explained that the Norteño criminal street gang is a large organization\nwith approximately 3,000 to 4,000 documented members in Stanislaus County as of May\n2008. Depending on the neighborhood, it may break up into little subgroups or subsets of\nmore tightly knit gang members who claim a particular neighborhood as their own and\nuse a certain name for that neighborhood. For example, Deep South Side Modesto and\nOGL, South Side Modesto are both groups of Norteño gang members, and they unify\nunder the Norteño organization, the color red, and the number 14. Because they are from\ndifferent neighborhoods, however, they use different names. “Turloco” — a combination\nof “Turlock” and “loco,” Spanish for “crazy” — is a word Norteño gang members in\nTurlock adopted for themselves. Varrio West Side Turlock, which goes by the acronym\nVWST, is the primary Norteño gang in Turlock. Angelus Street is a very active location\nfor Norteño gang activity in Turlock.\n         Based on his personal involvement with hundreds of investigations of gang\ncrimes, Mariscal opined that as of May 2008, the primary activities of the Norteño\ncriminal street gang were murders, attempted murders, assaults, drug dealing, robberies,\ncar thefts, burglaries, various crimes associated with weapons violations, and various\ncrimes associated with narcotic violations. The Norteño gang had a reputation for being\nviolent within its own gang, and also in the eyes of rival gangs and communities as a\nwhole.\n\n                                               12.\n\f       According to Mariscal, gangs thrive through fear and intimidation. Those are\nhallmarks of the Norteño criminal street gang. Respect is a big issue for gang members.\nThey want to be respected, and to them, the more someone fears them, the more they are\nrespected. Instilling fear and intimidation in others equals respect to them.\n       For a known dropout physically to assault an active gang member in the presence\nof other gang members is “an ultimate sign of disrespect.” A dropout is considered\n“lower than scum” and the enemy of the gang. In Mariscal‟s experience, the only way an\nactive gang member can rebound from that is to respond “with ultimate violence” against\nthe dropout. If he does not, he will be viewed as weak. He has to prove he is still worthy\nof being in the gang and can respond with violence when confronted with violence.\nBecause the Norteño gang thrives off of the fear and intimidation coming from violent\nacts within the gang, if there are members who are not willing to participate in violent\nacts or to prove their violent tendencies, especially after being disrespected, the gang and\nits reputation fall apart. The gang will not be able to function and commit the crimes that\nallow a gang to thrive.\n       Villanueva had gang tattoos, but also had a tattoo reading “Bidnezz First.” This\nwas consistent with the contents of the Saldana wila, which stated that the author did not\nknow if the person he was accused of murdering was active or nonactive, but that on\nseveral occasions he promoted himself as a degenerate: He was known for hanging\naround with inactive individuals and, when confronted about the people with whom he\nassociated, made comments about how he was all about his money and the homies did\nnot put money in his pocket. Nothing in his investigation led Mariscal to believe\nVillanueva was a Norteño dropout. Rather, investigation showed he was an active gang\nmember at the time of the wedding and the date he was shot.\n       Mariscal had information Villanueva was in trouble with the gang at the time he\nwas killed. Although he was still an active gang member at that point, the fact he came to\nthe aid of a dropout (Perez) against active gang members two months earlier at the\n\n                                            13.\n\fwedding is something that would get a person in trouble with the gang.11 If Villanueva\nwas not considered to be in good standing with the gang, it would have been very unwise\nfor him to go to the area that has the most Norteño gang activity in Turlock. In\nMariscal‟s opinion, Villanueva may have thought he was in good standing when he went\nto Angelus Street.\n       In giving an opinion as to whether someone is a gang member, Mariscal considers\nthe totality of the circumstances based on the result of an investigation he conducts of the\nperson. He uses 12 criteria, which include whether the person has been arrested with\nother gang members in the past; whether the person associates with gang members;\nwhether the person has been identified as a gang member by a reliable source; whether\nthe person has admitted being a gang member in the past; whether the person has been\ncontacted wearing gang colors; whether the person has possessed gang paraphernalia;\nwhether the person has admitted gang membership during a classification interview;\nwhether the person has used gang symbols; whether the person frequents gang areas;\nwhether the person has gang tattoos; and whether the person‟s name has been found on a\ngang roster. A person must meet at least two of the criteria before Mariscal will call that\nperson a gang member.\n       In Mariscal‟s opinion, Gutierrez was a Norteño gang member on May 25.\nMariscal based this opinion on everything he reviewed involving Gutierrez: Gutierrez\nwas contacted, on four occasions, while associating with other Norteño gang members;\non nine occasions, he was arrested alone or with other gang members; he had gang\n\n\n11     There is a difference between not being an active gang member and being a\ndropout. Being inactive does not necessarily mean the person is not in the gang anymore,\nbut simply that the person stepped away or is not currently associating or conducting\ncriminal activity with the gang. Being a dropout means the person is no longer part of the\ngang and has decided to disassociate completely from the gang. Although Perez testified\nhe was not active, he previously told Mariscal he was a dropout.\n\n\n\n                                            14.\n\ftattoos, including “Varrio West Side Turlock”; he admitted being a Northerner on three\noccasions; he used gang hand signs and symbols; on one occasion, he was identified as a\ngang member by a reliable source; and he admitted being a gang member during a\nclassification interview at the jail.12\n       In Mariscal‟s opinion, Saldana also was a Norteño gang member on May 25.\nMariscal based this opinion on everything he reviewed concerning Saldana: Saldana\nassociated with Norteño gang members on nine occasions; he was arrested alone or with\ngang members on 12 occasions; he had gang tattoos, including “VWST”; he was\nidentified as a Norteño gang member by a reliable source; he used or possessed gang\nsymbols on three occasions; his name appeared on an active gang member roster; and he\nadmitted being a Northerner on four occasions.\n       In Mariscal‟s experience, red-on-red violence is disfavored by Norteños. A\nNorteño wanting to assault a fellow gang member must first get approval from the gang.\nIf there is red-on-red violence, the parties involved submit reports to the gang leaders.\nThe gang leaders actually conduct an investigation into the incident to determine whether\nthe person who committed the assault was in the right. Often, the gang members who\ncommit these assaults are cleared, because the investigation reveals the victim of the\nassault violated the rules of the gang first.\n       Mariscal reviewed the wilas found in the cell of Nunez and Ramirez, and was able\nto gather gang intelligence from them that formed the basis for some of his opinions. In\nparticular, he looked for an active tier roster, which was a list of active gang members\nwithin a certain area of the jail. One of the wilas was such a roster; Gutierrez was on the\nlist of active gang members within the jail.\n\n12     With respect to both defendants, Mariscal described in detail for the jury the\nreports and other information upon which he based his opinions. We discuss this\ntestimony in more detail in conjunction with defendants‟ claim it was improperly\nadmitted, post.\n\n\n\n                                                15.\n\f       From one of the wilas that was seized, Mariscal was able to form an opinion\nconcerning whether defendants were cleared following their arrival in the county jail. In\nthe wila, it was reported they were under investigation, both had submitted their full\naccounts of what occurred, and Villanueva‟s cousins had submitted reports about what\ntook place. If defendants had not been cleared of this incident, they would have been\nremoved from the gang setting and gang housing long before trial, which was almost\nthree years after the homicide. Instead, they had been active, and functioning as part of\nthe gang, the entire time. This indicated the gang investigated the incident and concluded\neither Villanueva was justifiably killed or defendants did not kill him.\n       The fact defendants were cleared was “extremely important” to Mariscal‟s opinion\nas to whether the Norteño gang benefited from the crime. When two active Norteños kill\nanother active Norteño and do not suffer penalties for it from the gang, it sends a strong\nmessage to the remainder of the gang that members will follow the gang‟s rules or be\n“dealt with up to murder.” Someone considered a degenerate will not be allowed to\nfunction within the gang. The gang thrives off of fear and intimidation, within both the\ncommunity and its own members. That is how the gang keeps its members functioning,\ncommitting crimes, and working for the benefit of the gang.\n                                             II\n                                   DEFENSE EVIDENCE\n       On May 25, Alicia Gutierrez resided in the 200 block of Angelus Street. That day,\nthere was a big party next door. Alicia could tell there were a lot of gang members\npresent, because they had head bandanas and wore red.13\n       Alicia saw two people arguing angrily on the sidewalk, in front of the empty\nbuilding, for about five minutes. Perhaps 100 people were watching, but none\nintervened. Alicia could not describe the two who were arguing because they were not\n13     Alicia, who was not a gang member, did not like gangs.\n\n\n\n                                            16.\n\fturned toward her, but one, who was wearing a white shirt and hat, was taller and\nchunkier than the other.\n       The two started shoving each other while the people around them just watched and\negged them on. The two then went into the backyard of the vacant duplex. They went by\nthemselves, with the bigger man walking first, but after a few minutes about 20 people\nwent back with them. At that point, Alicia returned to her apartment. She could hear\nthem continuing to argue, and she saw them pushing and shoving each other. They were\nalmost to the end of the backyard, close to the alley. The people who followed them back\nwere closer to the front of the duplex. They were watching, but making no effort to stop\nthe altercation.\n       The pushing went on for a couple of minutes. Alicia could see fists going up. She\ndid not see anybody with a weapon, although she did see one of them reach into his\nwaistband area. She did not know which one. The fighting went on for a couple of\nminutes, then she heard gunshots. She heard one shot, then a half-second pause, then\nanother shot, and “then they were on top of each other.” Then there was a longer pause\nand a final shot. She believed she heard at least five or six shots altogether.\n       During the course of his investigation at the scene of the shooting, Detective Tosta\nfound bullets and bullet holes in the south fence line of the property. They ranged from\n15 to 27 inches above the ground, and from 13 feet 9 inches to 18 feet 6 inches west of\nthe east fence line. There were also several bullets, bullet holes, and ricochet marks in\nthe building directly south, across the alley from the fence. They ranged from four feet to\nnine feet three inches above the ground.\n       On May 28, Detective Bertram interviewed Debbie Dunuan (Villanueva‟s mother)\nand Irma Bernal. Both concluded Tommy had some complicity in Villanueva‟s death\ndue to numerous telephone calls Tommy made to Villanueva, insisting he come to the\nbarbecue. During the neighborhood canvas that was conducted after the shooting,\nhowever, several residents reported overhearing individuals present at the party say\n\n                                             17.\n\fdefendants were the ones responsible for shooting Villanueva. Even those who suspected\nTommy was involved clearly identified defendants as being “the responsibles.”\n       Tapia‟s story about what happened evolved and changed during the course of his\ninterview with Bertram and Bunch. When Bertram and Bunch went to Tapia‟s house,\nthey discovered he had lied about where the gun had been stored. They did not discover\nanything to change Tapia‟s assertion Gutierrez had the firearm when he went to the\nlocation of the shooting, however.\n       Gunsmith Paul Mangelos testified as an expert on firearms in general and Glocks\nin particular. He explained that a .40-caliber Glock is a semiautomatic firearm, meaning\nit has a clip or magazine; and ejects a spent shell, feeds in a new cartridge, and fires a\nbullet each time the trigger is pulled. Changing one part on the gun makes it fully\nautomatic; conversion kits are available on the Internet, although converting the gun to\nfully automatic is not legal in California. With a fully automatic firearm, one trigger pull\nmay fire multiple rounds. A fully automatic Glock can fire approximately 1,200 rounds\nper minute, meaning it should fire 13 shots in less than a second. While firing, the gun\nwill be hard to control and will be moving due to recoil. Someone hearing a fully\nautomatic Glock being fired will not be able to determine how many rounds were fired.\n       Gutierrez, who was 31 years old at the time of trial, testified that he had been\nacquainted with Perez for about 25 years. The two had a hostile relationship, because\nPerez had molested Gutierrez‟s cousin when she was about seven years old. As a result,\nGutierrez and Perez had had a number of fights, most of which were won by Perez.\nThese had nothing to do with a gang.\n       Gutierrez attended Tommy‟s wedding reception. A lot of his family members\nwere there, and they all were talking and having a good time.\n       It was kind of hot inside the Grange Hall, so at some point, defendants went\noutside to get some fresh air. Perez, Villanueva, and possibly more men approached.\nPrior to this time, Villanueva and Gutierrez had had some problems. Villanueva had\n\n                                             18.\n\f“pretty much acted stupid toward[]” Gutierrez, although Gutierrez did not know why.\nAlso prior to this time, Gutierrez had been in a lot of fights, mostly because of the people\nwith whom he associated. At the time of the wedding reception, he was affiliated with a\nNorteño gang, as were Villanueva and Perez. Gutierrez was not angry at Perez about\nwhether he was in or out of a gang; that had nothing to do with anything.\n       Perez approached Gutierrez and asked to talk to him, indicating kind of toward the\nback. Gutierrez was willing to go with Perez even though he did not think they were\ngoing to talk, but Saldana said no, that they could talk right there. Perez then punched\nGutierrez in the face. Gutierrez stumbled back, then got up and started fighting with\nPerez. At some point, Gutierrez saw Saldana on the ground. Villanueva kicked Saldana\nin the face while Saldana was down. Saldana did not appear to be conscious.\n       Gutierrez and Perez continued fighting, and a large group of people surrounded\nthem. Tommy and Eloisa then came out and broke it up. Eloisa was upset and accused\nGutierrez of disrupting her wedding. Saldana had been down for two or three minutes;\nGutierrez helped him up and they both left. They were already gone by the time the fight\nstarted across the street. They had been at the reception for two to three hours when they\nleft, during which time they had had no problems with Perez and Villanueva. Gutierrez\nconsidered this “just another fight”; he was not out for revenge afterward, despite what\nhappened to Saldana.\n       Gutierrez did not see Villanueva, and was not looking for him or Perez, between\nthe date of the wedding reception and the day of the shooting. He did not even know\nVillanueva was in town. As of the day of the shooting, Gutierrez was living with his\nmother on the north side of Turlock, across town from Angelus Street. He did not own a\n.40-caliber Glock, and never left a gun with Tapia. He did leave some marijuana at\nTapia‟s house, however, because Gutierrez‟s mother would not allow it at her house. The\nmarijuana was about the size of a brick, and was wrapped with plastic wrap inside cloth.\nGutierrez took it to Tapia‟s house about a week before picking it up.\n\n                                            19.\n\f       Gutierrez had been friends with Moses Rodriguez, but he did not know about or\nattend the celebration at the cemetery. He contacted Tapia because he had a buyer for the\nmarijuana and wanted to pick up the package. The plan was for defendants to pick it up,\nthen go to Ranch Burger, a restaurant off Lander, where they would meet the buyer and\nalso get something to eat.\n       Tapia lived on Angelus Street, about three blocks from where the shooting took\nplace. On the way there, defendants did not discuss Villanueva and had no plans to\nconfront him. Defendants picked up Tapia in the white Nissan, which was registered to a\nrelative of Gutierrez‟s wife, but on which Gutierrez had taken over the payments.\nGutierrez was driving. Gutierrez remained in the car; he had telephoned Tapia earlier,\nand Tapia came out with the marijuana. Tapia did not provide Gutierrez with a gun, and\nGutierrez did not show one to Tapia. Saldana did not have any gun that Gutierrez saw.\nThere was no discussion about Villanueva.\n       Once Tapia got in the car, the plan was to go eat at Ranch Burger, which was\nabout half a mile to a mile away. As they drove down Angelus, they saw 70 to 80 people\nin the street and in front of the houses. When Tapia saw Tommy, he told Gutierrez to\nstop. He said he wanted to see if Tommy had any new Jordans. Gutierrez pulled over.\nTapia got out of the car and went toward the carport, where Tommy was located.\nDefendants also got out. Alcohol was being served, and Gutierrez accepted the offer of a\nbeer. Defendants were not angry; Gutierrez did not see Villanueva.\n       Defendants stood by the opening in the fence, watching two men play dice on the\nsidewalk. The plan was for Tapia to look at the shoes, then he and defendants would go\non and eat, and Gutierrez would get rid of the marijuana. They had been there for about\nfive to 10 minutes when Gutierrez noticed Villanueva approaching. Villanueva was\nwearing a jacket; he took it halfway off, then a light-complected Hispanic male stopped\nhim and they argued a bit. Gutierrez did not know who the man was. The man was\ntelling Villanueva just to let it go, that it was not the time or place.\n\n                                               20.\n\f       Villanueva went up to Gutierrez and said, “Let me holler at you.” Villanueva did\nnot exchange words with Saldana or offer to shake hands. Gutierrez did not believe it\nwas going to be a friendly talk, but he said, “All right.” Villanueva then walked through\nthe gate and Gutierrez followed. Gutierrez thought there would probably be a fight. He\ndid not hear anyone yell at Darnell Lambert.\n       About 25 or 30 people followed them into the backyard. Villanueva handed his\nhat and jacket to someone. He then turned around and rushed Gutierrez. Villanueva\nswung at Gutierrez, so they started to fight. There were no words exchanged, either out\nfront or in the backyard. Gutierrez did not know where Saldana was at that point. No\none tried to separate the combatants.\n       Gutierrez and Villanueva fought for a minute, then Gutierrez turned away,\nalthough he did not completely turn his back on Villanueva. He was worried about what\nthe people behind him, many of whom he did not know, might be doing. Gutierrez and\nVillanueva were both breathing hard from trading punches. Gutierrez, who was\nunarmed, thought Villanueva was trying to catch his breath, but the next he knew, he\nlooked up and there was a pistol in his face. Gutierrez did not know from where\nVillanueva had produced the gun, but he feared for his life and so he grabbed it.\nVillanueva had his finger on the trigger at the time.\n       The two men wrestled for the gun, and Gutierrez fell over a shopping cart. He\nwent down on his back, and Villanueva fell on top of him. They landed hard, and the gun\ncame loose. Both men got to their feet and went for it. Gutierrez bent down, and as he\nwas picking it up, Villanueva kicked him in the face. Gutierrez‟s finger was on the\ntrigger when he got kicked, and he unintentionally fired. He did not mean to shoot\nVillanueva. Gutierrez only pulled the trigger one time, but bullets came out “kind of like\na machine gun.” There was no pause between any of the shots. Gutierrez could not\ncontrol the gun, which was going off as it was being raised. Villanueva turned and fell.\n\n\n\n                                            21.\n\fGutierrez could not tell if he was shot. Neither Gutierrez nor anyone he saw put the gun\nto Villanueva‟s head and pulled the trigger.\n       Gutierrez‟s ears started ringing when the gun went off, and he was “kind of\nblacked out” and had blurred vision from the kick. Everyone was screaming, and he\ndropped the gun and ran. He went to his car, and Saldana also got in.14 Gutierrez did not\nknow where Tapia was. Gutierrez dropped Saldana off by a church and left. He never\nmade it to Ranch Burger or to deliver the marijuana.\n       Gutierrez was afraid for his wife and children. He feared both retaliation and the\npolice. He left Turlock and ended up in San Jose. He burned the car not to destroy\nevidence, but because the registered owner could not make the payments. He himself\nwas burned while doing this.\n       Gutierrez was arrested in Sacramento. Once he was in custody in Stanislaus\nCounty, he learned that as someone affiliated with the Norteño gang who came into\ncustody for allegedly hurting another Norteño, he was supposed to answer a number of\nquestions. Saldana actually wrote the wila bearing Gutierrez‟s name, but Gutierrez\nprovided the information on it. Answering the questions was mandatory.\n       Gutierrez was not aware of any difference between being affiliated with a gang\nand being a gang member. On March 22, he considered himself a Norteño gang member.\nRespect was important to him as a gang member, including with regard to the way his\ngang member peers viewed him.\n       Gutierrez explained that to a gang member, a degenerate is someone who is no\nlonger associating with the gang. It is not a bad thing. A degenerate can “hang out” with\nan active member. Gutierrez was not sure what happens when a degenerate disrespects\nan active gang member in public in the presence of other gang members. For the gang\nmember who is disrespected in public to do nothing but walk away may lead to\n14     Saldana had not been involved in the fight in any way.\n\n\n\n                                               22.\n\frepercussions such as discipline. However, Gutierrez would not necessarily be looked on\nas a coward or as letting the gang down if he let a degenerate punch him in front of other\ngang members and then just walked away.\n        Gutierrez denied that either the fight at the wedding reception or the shooting had\nanything to do with a gang. Perez molested Gutierrez‟s cousin when she was seven years\nold, 20 years or more ago. A known child molester cannot affiliate with Norteños, but\nonly the family was aware of the molestation. Villanueva previously threatened\nGutierrez‟s family and pulled guns on him. The information contained in the wila\nconcerning what Villanueva had done was accurate. It was not Gutierrez‟s attempt to\nclear himself for an unauthorized killing of a Norteño; he did not feel threatened in any\nway by the Norteño gang after killing another Norteño without authorization from the\ngang.\n        Saldana testified that he was 26 years old at the time of trial and had lived with\nGutierrez all his life. He did not have a good memory of what happened at the wedding\nreception, because he was knocked out. He recalled Gutierrez and Perez having words\noutside the reception hall, and Perez saying to Gutierrez, “Let‟s talk,” and motioning with\nhis head. Saldana told Gutierrez that if Perez had something to say, he could say it right\nthere. Because of past problems, Saldana assumed they were going to fight, and he did\nnot think they should be fighting right then and messing up Tommy‟s wedding. Saldana\nrecalled there being a fight between Gutierrez, Perez, and Villanueva, but did not\nremember who threw the first blow or how long he himself was unconscious. He just\nremembered walking to the car afterward and leaving.\n        In May 2008, Saldana was living on Geer, in Turlock, with his wife and son. On\nMay 25, he went to his mother‟s house and did some yard work for her. He then drove\nwith Gutierrez to Tapia‟s house. Saldana did not know anything about any marijuana\nuntil he saw the package and asked what was in it. There was no talk about the fight at\nthe wedding reception or doing anything to Villanueva. Saldana did not even know if\n\n                                             23.\n\fVillanueva was in Turlock that day and knew nothing about any barbecue or anything\ngoing on at the cemetery. He did not conspire with Tommy or anyone else to try to get\nVillanueva to be at the barbecue. Saldana was not armed and did not see a gun possessed\nby anyone.\n       After leaving Tapia‟s house, they were going to go eat at Ranch Burger off of\nLander. They stopped on Angelus, however, because Tapia saw Tommy and wanted to\nsee what new shoes he had. Tapia walked up to Tommy, while Saldana and Gutierrez got\nout of the car and walked over to where everyone else was, in front of the duplexes.\nSaldana did not recognize anyone there.\n       Saldana had never had a physical encounter with Villanueva other than at the\nwedding reception. As he and Gutierrez stood by the gate, Saldana heard Villanueva\narguing with a man Saldana did not know. The man told Villanueva to let it go.\nVillanueva was looking in the direction of Saldana and Gutierrez.\n       Saldana and Villanueva did not speak to each other, but Villanueva told Gutierrez,\n“Let me holler at you,” and then walked into the backyard. There were 40 or 50 people\naround, and Saldana understood it to be a challenge to fight. He did not hear Eloisa yell\nanything.\n       Gutierrez followed Villanueva into the back, as did people who had been standing\nthere. As they walked to the backyard, Villanueva took off his jacket, hat, and chain.\nEveryone formed a circle around Villanueva and Gutierrez. Villanueva handed his stuff\nto someone, then turned around and rushed Gutierrez. Villanueva threw the first punch,\nthen they started fighting. Saldana did not try to help Gutierrez, because it was one on\none. Although Gutierrez was outweighed, Saldana was not afraid for him because\nGutierrez could hold his own. No one else tried to intervene, but instead just cheered the\nfighters on. Villanueva was landing the most punches.\n       There was a pause in the fight, then Saldana saw Villanueva pull a pistol from his\nwaistband and put it in Gutierrez‟s face. Gutierrez quickly grabbed it. He and\n\n                                            24.\n\fVillanueva started wrestling for it and tripped over a shopping cart. Gutierrez fell back\nand Villanueva fell on top of him, and the gun came loose. Gutierrez and Villanueva\nscrambled to their feet, looking around, and Gutierrez went for the pistol. He was bent\nover, picking up the gun from the ground, when he got kicked in the face. Saldana saw\nGutierrez come up with the gun and heard seven or eight shots fired all together.15\nSaldana saw Villanueva get hit and kind of spin around. It appeared to Saldana that when\nthe firearm discharged, Gutierrez was defending himself.\n       The gunshots frightened Saldana, so he turned around and ran out of the backyard.\nWhen he got to the street, he saw Gutierrez running out of the backyard toward the car.\nGutierrez was holding his face. He did not have a gun.\n       Saldana denied shooting Villanueva, setting him up, or being part of a plan to lure\nhim into the backyard. He admitted being a Norteño gang member, but denied the\nshooting was gang related.\n       Saldana admitted writing in the wila that he was told by some of the “younger\nhomies” that they made up a gang called Turlocos, but some individuals from Varrio\nWest Side Turlock, including Villanueva, told them they were not allowed “to represent\nit” because the only gang in Turlock was VWST. Saldana stated in the wila that he was\ntold the whole purpose of starting Turlocos was to unite all the youngsters who were\nfighting among themselves, but the individuals he mentioned started jumping the\n“younger homies.” As a result, Saldana told the individuals from VWST that that was\n“red on red” and “not cool.” Ever since then, Villanueva and the others did not like him.\nThe wila related how Villanueva, Bullet G, and some of the others told Saldana‟s wife\nthey were going to kill Saldana and Gutierrez. It also related that Villanueva tried to start\na fight with Saldana and Gutierrez three times at a wedding. At the end of the wedding,\n\n15      Saldana was guessing at the number of shots. There was no pause, like Alicia\ntestified; “[w]hen the gunshots stopped, they stopped.”\n\n\n\n                                             25.\n\fVillanueva called some of his friends who were known dropouts and degenerates, and\nthey pulled up in a car driven by Anthony Fuentes (“Chubbs”), who “snitched” on\nSaldana for carjacking in 2004. Perez, Bullet G, and a number of others surrounded\nSaldana and Gutierrez, and Saldana was struck and knocked out by Villanueva, who then\ncontinued to kick him in the face while Saldana was unconscious.\n        Everything Saldana wrote in the wila about Villanueva was accurate, but Saldana\ndid not hate him at the time of the shooting. Saldana denied ever making a shooting\ngesture at Villanueva. He attempted to listen to everything to which the prosecution‟s\ngang experts testified. He did not know all of the “stuff” they said about the Norteño\ngang.\n                                     DISCUSSION16\n                                             I\n                                 EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\nA.      Tapia’s Trial Testimony (Gutierrez, Saldana)\n        Defendants say Tapia‟s trial testimony was coerced, and was the product of a\ncoerced police statement. As a result, they claim, its admission violated their due process\nright to a fair trial. We conclude the testimony was properly admitted.\n        1.    Background\n        Tapia‟s trial testimony is summarized in the statement of facts, ante. Before he\ntestified, Gutierrez requested an Evidence Code section 402 hearing concerning the\nvoluntariness of Tapia‟s pretrial statement and trial testimony.17\n\n16     We have reordered the contentions set forth in defendants‟ opening briefs to\nconform more closely to the chronology of events at trial. (See People v. Wash (1993) 6\nCal.4th 215, 235, fn. 4.)\n17     In addition to arguing the claim fails on the merits, the Attorney General says\nSaldana forfeited his claim because the record does not show he objected or joined in\nGutierrez‟s objections to Tapia‟s testimony. We recognize that “[a] claim of coercion is\nnot cognizable on appeal in the absence of an objection to the testimony at trial” (People\n\n\n                                            26.\n\f       At the Evidence Code section 402 hearing, Tapia was represented by Attorney\nJohn Hillenbrand. On direct examination by the prosecutor, Tapia testified that\nHillenbrand also represented him at the time of the preliminary hearing. At the\npreliminary hearing, Tapia invoked his Fifth Amendment rights. At that time, however,\nhe did not have any agreement with the prosecution. After the preliminary hearing, the\nprosecutor entered into a written agreement with Tapia, whereby Tapia would not be\nprosecuted for any of the events leading up to the murder of Villanueva, including\nproviding the firearm to Gutierrez, and anything that occurred at the Angelus Street\naddress. Tapia signed the agreement, after consultation with his attorney, because he\nbelieved it was the right thing to do.\n       Tapia testified that he recalled some of the interview he had on June 11, 2008,\nwith Bertram and Bunch. He was not shackled or handcuffed, no weapon was pointed at\nhim, and he gave the statement of his own free will. Tapia did not recall Bertram saying\nhe could leave any time he wanted and they would give him a ride back home, although\nthat was reflected in the transcript. Tapia “believe[d]” he told Bertram what he knew\nabout the events of May 25, 2008, although at the time, he had not been promised\nimmunity. To the best of his ability, he provided a truthful statement to the officers.\nAsked if he was testifying of his own free will, Tapia responded, “I‟m doing this because\nI guess I have to.”\n\n\nv. Kennedy (2005) 36 Cal.4th 595, 612, disapproved on another ground in People v.\nWilliams (2010) 49 Cal.4th 405, 459), and failure to join in the objection of a codefendant\ngenerally constitutes a forfeiture of the issue on appeal (People v. Wilson (2008) 44\nCal.4th 758, 793). However, “[i]n requiring an objection at trial, the forfeiture rule\nensures that the opposing party is given an opportunity to address the objection, and it\nprevents a party from engaging in gamesmanship by choosing not to object, awaiting the\noutcome, and then claiming error. [Citation.]” (People v. Kennedy, supra, 36 Cal.4th at\np. 612.) Here, the record shows that, although counsel for Gutierrez took the lead in\npresenting the issue, the trial court and prosecutor treated the objection as having been\nmade by both defendants. Under these circumstances, we find no forfeiture.\n\n\n\n                                            27.\n\f       On cross-examination, Tapia testified that in June 2008, the police left a card on\nhis door. He called them back. He was subsequently taken down to the police\ndepartment. Prior to that, he had not told his mother anything about the shooting. He\nrecalled Bertram mentioning that he knew her, but did not recall him saying several times\nduring the interview that he was going to have a talk with Tapia‟s mother.\n       Tapia did not recall Bertram or Bunch telling him that he was lying, that he was at\na crossroads, or that his future was at issue. He acknowledged, however, that the\ntranscript of the interview reflected Bunch saying, “You want to do the right thing. It‟s\nokay. It‟s very important. This day is your day. Right now. This second. You are\nstanding right now at a crossroads,” and “So it‟s very important for your future.”18 The\ntranscript also showed Bertram saying, “We talked to your mom before we came over\nhere, but I don‟t think you are being honest with us. As a matter of fact, I know you‟re\nnot. Because I know that within a half hour of the shooting you were on the phone with\nRay.” However, Tapia did not recall being told it was his future, he was at a crossroads,\nor to do the right thing.\n       Tapia first denied that talking to the officers was frightening. He did not know if\nhe was going to be charged for having some involvement in the case. The transcript\nshowed Bunch saying, “This is a crossroads for you. It seriously is. I can‟t stress that\nenough. It‟s a crossroad.” Bertram then said, “We‟re right on the cusp of arresting them.\nOkay? And a lot of people are going to get caught up in this, and a lot of people are\ngoing to go down for their involvement.” Bunch followed with, “He‟s not -- it‟s no\nthreat. It‟s a sure thing,” whereupon Bertram said, “And I really don‟t think you want to\ngo down for being involved with this at all.” Tapia acknowledged the foregoing was\n\n18      Unlike the parties at trial, we do not have the transcript before us. It appears the\ncourt reporter used quotation marks when one of the attorneys was reading directly from\nthe transcript. Where quotation marks are not used, we have no way of knowing whether\nthe words accurately represent the transcript‟s contents.\n\n\n\n                                            28.\n\fshown in the transcript, but denied that when he was told that, he understood he could be\ncharged in a possible murder case. The officers were just asking him questions about\nwhere he was “and stuff,” and he was answering them truthfully. With respect to\nwhether the officers kept telling Tapia that he was not being truthful, the officers were\nspeaking very fast and Tapia could not hear everything, which was why, he thought, they\nsaid it so many times. He did not remember the officers telling him what they wanted\nhim to say, or arguing with them that something was not as he remembered.\n       Tapia later admitted it had scared him to have the officers say he was involved in\nmurder. He did not do anything, so “of course” he did not want to be charged with\nanything to do with the murder. He did not think that he could be charged if he did not\ntalk to them, because he did not do anything.\n       Tapia invoked his constitutional right not to testify at the preliminary hearing not\nbecause he was afraid of testifying, but because he thought requiring a lawyer would be\nbetter for him. He did not understand a lot of what was going on, which was why he got\na lawyer. The fact he was now testifying did not have anything to do with any sort of\npromise the government made to him, although he did read and understand the letter from\nthe prosecutor to his lawyer.19\n       Tapia understood the letter said his statement could result in him being prosecuted\nfor crimes associated with Villanueva‟s murder. His understanding was, however, that he\ncould only be prosecuted for such crimes if he did not say the truth. Tapia acknowledged\nthe letter said, “Your client has represented that the statements [sic] he gave is true\nregarding the event and circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Roger\nVillanueva on May 25th, 2008.” Asked if he understood the truth was supposed to be the\nsame as the statement he gave to the officers in June 2008, Tapia replied that his\n\n19     The immunity agreement was contained in a letter from the prosecutor to Tapia‟s\nattorney.\n\n\n\n                                             29.\n\funderstanding was, if he testified truthfully to what he remembered, he would be granted\nimmunity. Asked if he came to court to voluntarily give a statement without any order\nthat he do so, Tapia responded, “I just listened to my lawyer, I guess.” Apart from what\nhis lawyer told him, he was not given any order or subpoena to be present. He believed,\nhowever, that he did have to testify.\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found no evidence of coercion,\neither with respect to Tapia‟s statement to Bertram and Bunch or his trial testimony.\nAccordingly, the court ruled Tapia would be allowed to testify before the jury.\n       2.     Analysis\n       In People v. Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th 405, the California Supreme Court stated:\n\n               “Defendants have limited standing to challenge the trial testimony of\n       a witness on the ground that an earlier out-of-court statement made by the\n       witness was the product of police coercion.… A defendant may assert a\n       violation of his or her own right to due process of the law and a fair trial\n       based upon third party witness coercion … if the defendant can establish\n       that trial evidence was coerced or rendered unreliable by prior coercion and\n       that the admission of this evidence would deprive the defendant of a fair\n       trial. [Citations.] Although the out-of-court statement itself may be subject\n       to exclusion because coercion rendered it unreliable, it is more difficult for\n       a defendant to establish that the court should exclude the witness‟s trial\n       testimony. As [the court] explained [in People v. Badgett (1995) 10 Cal.4th\n       330, 348], „[t]estimony of third parties that is offered at trial should not be\n       subject to exclusion unless the defendant demonstrates that improper\n       coercion has impaired the reliability of the testimony.‟ [Citation.] The\n       burden rests upon the defendant to demonstrate how the earlier coercion\n       „directly impaired the free and voluntary nature of the anticipated testimony\n       in the trial itself‟ [citation] and impaired the reliability of the trial testimony\n       [citation].” (People v. Williams, supra, at pp. 452-453, fn. omitted.)\n       “On appeal, we independently review the entire record to determine whether a\nwitness‟s testimony was coerced, so as to render the defendant‟s trial unfair. [Citation.]\nIn doing so, however, we defer to the trial court‟s credibility determinations, and to its\nfindings of physical and chronological fact, insofar as they are supported by substantial\nevidence.” (People v. Boyer (2006) 38 Cal.4th 412, 444.)\n\n\n                                              30.\n\f       As an initial matter, we are not convinced Tapia‟s statement to Bertram and Bunch\nwas coerced. Cases involving the admissibility of a defendant‟s own statement are\ninstructive. In that regard, the California Supreme Court stated: “The business of police\ndetectives is investigation, and they may elicit incriminating information from a suspect\nby any legal means. „[A]lthough adversarial balance, or rough equality, may be the norm\nthat dictates trial procedures, it has never been the norm that dictates the rules of\ninvestigation and the gathering of proof.‟ [Citation.] „The courts have prohibited only\nthose psychological ploys which, under all the circumstances, are so coercive that they\ntend to produce a statement that is both involuntary and unreliable.‟ [Citation.]” (People\nv. Jones (1998) 17 Cal.4th 279, 297-298.) “„“[M]ere advice or exhortation by the police\nthat it would be better for the accused to tell the truth when unaccompanied by either a\nthreat or a promise does not render a subsequent confession involuntary.” [Citation.] In\nterms of assessing inducements assertedly offered to a suspect, “„[when] the benefit\npointed out by the police … is merely that which flows naturally from a truthful and\nhonest course of conduct,‟ the subsequent statement will not be considered involuntarily\nmade. [Citation.]” [Citation.]‟” (People v. McWhorter (2009) 47 Cal.4th 318, 357-358.)\n“„[M]ere questions, or exhortations to tell the truth or clear [one‟s] conscience or help\n[one]self by revealing facts as to the dominant part of [a codefendant] or some other\nperson in the criminal enterprise‟” are insufficient: “„[I]ntellectual persuasion is not the\nequivalent of coercion.‟ [Citation.]” (People v. Hill (1967) 66 Cal.2d 536, 548-549; see\nalso People v. Jones, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 298 [detective‟s telling defendant his\nanswers could affect the rest of defendant‟s life did not establish coercion].)\n       Defendants‟ protestations notwithstanding, the record before us fails to show\nTapia was frightened or otherwise coerced “into making a statement that was both\n\n\n\n\n                                             31.\n\finvoluntary and unreliable.” (People v. Jones, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 298.)20 That it may\nhave scared him to have the officers say they thought he had something to do with a\nmurder simply does not establish coercion.\n       More importantly, even assuming an element of coercion was present in the\ninterview, reversal is not required. Defendants have failed to demonstrate Tapia‟s trial\ntestimony was coerced or rendered unreliable by any such prior coercion, or that\nadmission of his testimony deprived them of a fair trial.\n       Almost three years had elapsed between the time of the interview (June 2008) and\nTapia‟s appearance at trial (March 2011). Such passage of time serves at least partially to\ndissipate the coercive effect of an interrogation, especially when, as here, the witness has\nreceived immunity under an agreement that is not conditioned upon the consistency of\ntrial testimony with an earlier statement, and the witness is represented by independent\ncounsel. (See People v. Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pp. 454-455.)\n       The immunity agreement required Tapia to testify “fully, fairly, and truthfully,”\nnot consistently with his statement to Bertram and Bunch. Under the agreement, whether\nTapia‟s testimony was truthful would be determined by the trial judge, not the prosecutor.\nWhether the immunity agreement remained in effect did not depend on whether\ndefendants were convicted.\n       The California Supreme Court has made it clear that “[t]here is nothing improperly\ncoercive about confronting a lesser participant in a crime with his or her predicament, and\noffering immunity from prosecution for the witness‟s criminal role in return for the\nwitness‟s promise to testify fully and fairly. [Citations.]” (People v. Boyer, supra, 38\nCal.4th at p. 445.) “A prosecutor may grant immunity from prosecution to a witness on\n\n\n20      Defendants suggested at trial, but never actually established through the transcript\nof the interview or testimony, that Bertram and Bunch told Tapia what they wanted him\nto say.\n\n\n\n                                             32.\n\fcondition that he or she testify truthfully to the facts involved. [Citation.] But if the\nimmunity agreement places the witness under a strong compulsion to testify in a\nparticular fashion, the testimony is tainted by the witness‟s self-interest, and thus\ninadmissible. [Citation.] Such a „strong compulsion‟ may be created by a condition\n„“that the witness not materially or substantially change [his or] her testimony from [his\nor] her tape-recorded statement already given to … law enforcement officers.”‟\n[Citation.] [¶] On the other hand, [the high court has] upheld the admission of testimony\nsubject to grants of immunity which simply suggested the prosecution believed the prior\nstatement to be the truth, and where the witness understood that his or her sole obligation\nwas to testify fully and fairly.” (Id. at p. 455; see also People v. Williams, supra, 49\nCal.4th at p. 455; People v. Badgett, supra, 10 Cal.4th at pp. 354-355.) This is so even\nwhen the witness is legally deemed an accomplice. (People v. Avila (2006) 38 Cal.4th\n491, 594; see § 1111.)21\n       The immunity agreement here did not place Tapia under a “strong compulsion” to\ntestify in any particular fashion. Although he was aware that if he did not testify, he\ncould be charged in this case — something he did not wish to happen — this does not\namount to coercion such that his testimony should have been excluded. (See People v.\nBoyer, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 445 [no improper coercion found despite witness‟s making\nclear her primary reason for cooperating at trial was prosecution‟s offer of immunity\nfrom prosecution as accessory to murder in return for truthful testimony].) “All\nimmunized witnesses are offered some quid pro quo, usually an offer of leniency. [The\nCalifornia Supreme Court has] never held, nor has any authority been offered in support\nof the proposition, that an offer of leniency in return for cooperation with the police\n\n\n\n21   The trial court here instructed jurors that if they determined murder was\ncommitted, then Tapia was an accomplice to that crime.\n\n\n\n                                             33.\n\frenders a third party statement involuntary or eventual trial testimony coerced.” (People\nv. Badgett, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 354.)\n       Tapia clearly understood he was required to testify truthfully, not in a specific\nmanner, his professed lack of memory concerning what was said during the interview\nnotwithstanding.22 Indeed, he did not testify in conformity with his statement to\ninvestigators concerning the key subject of the gun. “Thus defendants fail in the essential\ntask of connecting the pressures brought to bear on the witness before trial with [his]\nultimate trial testimony.” (People v. Badgett, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 355.)23\nB.     Gang Expert’s Testimony (Gutierrez, Saldana)\n       Defendants claim their Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, and their federal\nand state due process rights to a fair trial, were violated by admission of the gang expert‟s\n\n\n22     The following exchanges occurred during Tapia‟s cross-examination by counsel\nfor Gutierrez: “Q. As you sit here and testify, do you understand that you could be\nprosecuted for crimes associated with the supposed murder of Roger Villanueva? [¶] A.\nIf I‟m not truthful, yes, I could be prosecuted. [¶] Q. Well, if you are not truthful today\nor whether you are not truthful in June of 2008? [¶] A. Based on being truthful of what\nI remember today. [¶] Q. What you remember today; right? [¶] A. Correct.”\n       “[Q.] Then -- then the next part [of the prosecutor‟s letter to Tapia‟s attorney], I\nwant to draw your attention is -- is that, if the above-stated conditions are not met or it is\nfound that you have testified falsely or refused to testify, then the District Attorney is not\nbound by this agreement, and you will be -- you can be prosecuted for aiding and abetting\nthe murder of Roger Villanueva, additionally prosecuted for perjury, if applicable. Did\nyou read and understand that? [¶] A. Yes. [¶] Q. All right. So you understood that if\nyou either testified falsely or if you even refused to testify, you are going to be charged in\nthe murder of Roger Villanueva; isn‟t that true? [¶] A. Correct. [¶] Q. And you don‟t\nwant to be charged that way, do you? [¶] A. I believe nobody wants to be charged.”\n23      We note that, although defendants did not succeed in having Tapia‟s trial\ntestimony excluded, they fully cross-examined the parties to the interview (and, in the\ncase of Bertram and Bunch, called them as defense witnesses and examined them further\nconcerning the interview), thereby availing themselves of “the most powerful means in\n[their] arsenal for challenging the reliability of the witness‟s statements.” (People v.\nWilliams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 455.)\n\n\n\n                                             34.\n\ftestimony concerning their prior bad acts. They say the hearsay relied on by the expert as\na basis for his opinion they were members of a criminal street gang was testimonial\nwithin the meaning of Crawford v. Washington (2004) 541 U.S. 36 (Crawford) and was\noffered for the truth of the matters contained therein, yet they had no opportunity to\nconfront the declarants. They further contend the prior-bad-acts hearsay should have\nbeen excluded because it was unreliable and more prejudicial than probative. The\nAttorney General argues the testimony did not violate Crawford, and says the remaining\nchallenges to the evidence were forfeited by defendants‟ failure to object on the same\ngrounds in the trial court. We conclude any error was harmless.\n       1.     Background\n       Gutierrez moved, in limine, to preclude expert gang testimony based on police\nreports, field identification reports, jail records, and the like, on the ground such\ntestimony would violate his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation under Crawford and\nits progeny. He asserted the erroneous admission of such evidence would prejudice his\nright to a fair trial, as gang evidence has an inherent prejudice and creates a risk the jury\nwill infer defendant has a criminal disposition and is, therefore, guilty of the alleged\noffense. Saldana joined in the motion.\n       After argument, during which the prosecutor asserted the type of evidence\ndefendants were challenging was prejudicial but also extremely probative, the trial court\nobserved that even if it were to rule as a general matter that the gang expert could rely on\nhearsay information as the basis for his opinions, that hearsay had to be reliable. The\ncourt surmised that before the gang expert was allowed to testify, “it may be … that\nwe‟re going to conduct a further hearing as to the basis of his opinions, and the Court\nmay have to rule that some, none, or all of the things … upon which he bases his opinion\naren‟t reliable. [¶] … [¶] … I don‟t know that.” After additional argument, the following\ntook place:\n\n\n\n                                              35.\n\f              “THE COURT: … I think, in general, the case that I cited [People v.\n       Ramirez (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1422], plus the case cited in that, the\n       Thomas case [People v. Thomas (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1202], at least\n       gives me, as the trial Court, the very clear impression … that Crawford\n       does not prohibit an expert from relying on certain hearsay evidence.\n\n                “It‟s still the rule that it has to be reliable hearsay evidence. And it\n       is still the rule that the expert‟s testimony must be based, at least in part, on\n       his or her own personal knowledge. [¶] … [¶] Unfortunately, this motion\n       is just painted with a very broad brush. It says they can‟t do this under\n       Crawford. Well, there are certain things that can be done under Crawford.\n       There are certain things that can‟t be, whether it is under Crawford or\n       general rulings of evidence as to the admissibility of hearsay in general, and\n       hearsay as relied upon by an expert.\n\n              “I cannot make a blanket ruling on this issue. And, unfortunately, it\n       is going to have to be handled on a piecemeal basis as each type of\n       evidence is being introduced or attempted to be introduced.\n\n              “So all I‟m saying at this point is, I‟m not going to make a ruling\n       that Crawford prohibits an expert from testifying as to certain hearsay. But\n       there are still requirements that the People have to meet before that\n       hearsay can be relied upon and testified to. [¶] … [¶] … So at this point,\n       … all I’m saying is that I’m not going to make a blanket ruling that\n       Crawford prohibits the use of hearsay. It does in certain circumstances. It\n       does not in other circumstances. So we’re just going to have to take it one\n       by one and go from there.” (Italics added.)\n       As previously described, Investigator Mariscal of the district attorney‟s office\ntestified as an expert on gangs. He explained that in preparation for his testimony in a\ntrial like this, he reads the case and then conducts an investigation into the defendants.\nHe pulls all police reports in which they have been listed or contacted, field interview\ncards from different police departments, probation records, and school records if he finds\nthem. His purpose is to conduct a thorough investigation of the individuals, their\nbackgrounds, and their gang involvement, if any. He did not automatically conclude\nsomething was a gang crime simply because gang members were involved.\n       In his written gang workup, Mariscal listed a total of 13 incidents under the\nheading, “Activity for Ray Gutierrez.” The information formed part of the basis of his\n\n\n                                             36.\n\fopinion in the case, both as to gang membership and gang benefit. The incidents and\nsources of information to which Mariscal testified, were:\n       (1) Turlock Police Department No. 99-0773: On January 30, 1999, Turlock\npolice officers responded to a hardware store in Turlock regarding a shooting. Four\nindividuals had been shot at by the passenger of a vehicle. Gutierrez was identified as the\nshooter. A search of his residence revealed a stolen .25-caliber handgun.\n       (2) Turlock Police Department No. 01-683: On January 23, 2001, a Turlock\npolice officer responded to the area of Spruce and Angelus in Turlock in response to a\nreport of a reckless driver. When the vehicle was stopped, the front passenger fled on\nfoot. Gutierrez was one of the rear passengers. A stolen .22-caliber handgun was found\nunderneath the right front passenger seat, and marijuana, a glass methamphetamine pipe,\nand a knife were found in the backseat.\n       (3) Turlock Police Department No. 01-2814: On March 31, 2001, Turlock police\nofficers responded to a bar regarding a large crowd gathering in the parking lot. Shots\nwere fired, and a security guard pointed out a black Cadillac as being responsible for the\nshooting. A witness identified Gutierrez as the passenger in the car and the person\nresponsible for shooting four times into the air. The witness said Gutierrez and the car‟s\ndriver had gotten into a fight with some other males at the bar. Another witness heard\nHispanic males claiming West Side.\n       (4) Stanislaus County Auto Theft Task Force (StanCATT) Nos. 01-6427 and 01-\n6744: On August 2, 2001, task force agents stopped a stolen vehicle at Angelus and\nSpruce. Gutierrez was the front passenger. A methamphetamine pipe with a useable\namount of methamphetamine was located on the front passenger side floorboard, where\nGutierrez was sitting.\n       (5) Turlock Police Department No. 04-3475: On April 4, 2004, a Turlock police\nofficer responded to a medical center in Turlock regarding a shooting victim. There, he\ncontacted Gutierrez, who reported he had been approached by four males, one of whom\n\n                                            37.\n\fpointed a gun at his face. Gutierrez reached up and grabbed the gun, which discharged\ninto his left hand. Gutierrez told the officer he had claimed West Side Turlock Norteño\nfor six years, but no longer claimed it.\n       (6) Turlock Police Department No. 04-9570: On September 21, 2004, Gutierrez\nwas involved in a fight in Turlock in which the victim was injured. Gutierrez fled, but\nlater turned himself in. He stated he used to be involved in gangs, but had not been for\nthe last seven years.\n       (7) StanCATT report listed under CHP No. F-19-465-08: On January 9, 2008,\ntask force officers located a stolen vehicle in an apartment complex. They observed\nGutierrez drive up. One of his passengers drove the stolen vehicle away, followed by the\ncar Gutierrez was driving. Both vehicles were stopped and the occupants arrested. While\nbeing booked into jail, Gutierrez and one of his passengers admitted being Norteños.\nAnother passenger was wearing a red belt.\n       (8) Modesto Police Department No. 07-73364: On August 3, 2007, Gutierrez was\nin a vehicle driven by a Norteño gang member. Also present in the car, which had the\npersonalized license plate “Turloco,” were Saldana and two other males.\n       (9) Turlock Police Department No. 07-11403: On November 21, 2007, officers\nresponded to the area of Vermont and Spruce Streets, because Mylo Lopez reported the\ndriver of a gold Chrysler Concord had pointed a gun at him. Officers located the vehicle,\nwhich was driven by Gutierrez, but did not find a handgun when they searched the car\nand then could not locate Lopez. Gutierrez was arrested for driving on a suspended\ndriver‟s license.\n       (10) Turlock Police Department No. 08-2844: On March 23, 2008, an officer was\ndispatched to Vermont Street in response to an anonymous report of two subjects, whom\nthe reporting party said were “June Bug” and Raymond, firing a weapon from a moving\nburgundy Mustang. Officers conducted a high-risk stop on the vehicle; Gutierrez was the\ndriver, and the passenger was Joseph Gonzales, also known as June Bug. No weapon\n\n                                            38.\n\fwas found in the vehicle, but Gutierrez was arrested for driving on a suspended license.\nGonzales, a documented Norteño, was arrested for a parole violation.\n         (11) Turlock Police Department No. 08-4312: On May 5, 2008, an officer was\ndispatched to a call of a suspicious vehicle. Gutierrez was found in the same white\nNissan Altima as was involved in the present case. A search of the vehicle revealed 390\npseudoephedrine pills. Gutierrez was arrested for two warrants and possession of the\npills.\n         (12) Turlock Police Department No. 08-4975: The current offense.\n         (13) Booking information from June 12, 2008: When booked into the county jail,\nGutierrez claimed South as his enemies in jail who might harm him. He also responded\nyes and said Norte when asked if he affiliated with a gang.\n         As described in the statement of facts, ante, Mariscal opined that, on the date\nVillanueva was shot, Gutierrez was a Norteño gang member. Mariscal based this opinion\non everything he reviewed involving Gutierrez.\n         Prior to Mariscal testifying specifically as to Saldana, Saldana requested, and was\ngranted, a continuing objection on confrontation clause grounds.24 The trial court\ncautioned: “I don‟t want you to be misled that that means any other objections that stated\ndon‟t need to be stated.”\n         Mariscal testified that his investigative report contained the following incidents\nand sources of information concerning Saldana:\n         (1) Turlock Police Department No. 98-9638: On November 21, 1998, when\nSaldana was approximately 14 years old, a teacher at Turlock Junior High School caught\n\n24      The reporter‟s transcript reflects counsel for Saldana asked for a “consultation\nclause” objection. When Mariscal began to testify concerning his review of Saldana‟s\nactivities, however, counsel again objected to the line of questioning as a violation of the\nconfrontation clause, and the trial court confirmed Saldana had a continuing objection —\noverruled for the reasons stated pretrial — on that ground.\n\n\n\n                                              39.\n\fhim and another student spray-painting Norteño-related graffiti on school walls. The\nstudents were arrested for vandalism.\n       (2) Modesto Police Department No. 99-21601: On March 15, 1999, an officer\nattempted to stop a stolen vehicle in which Saldana was one of the passengers. After a\npursuit, those in the car were arrested. Saldana was charged with conspiracy and auto\ntheft. The vehicle‟s interior was spray painted with “14” and “X4,” and “Norteño” was\nscratched in the dash.\n       (3) Turlock Police Department No. 00-96: On January 4, 2000, Saldana and a\ngang member were arrested after they were identified by the victim of an attempted\nresidential burglary. Saldana acted as the lookout. Both were arrested for attempted\nburglary and conspiracy.\n       (5)25 Merced Sheriff‟s Department No. 00-17441: On June 18, 2000, a deputy\nwas dispatched to Hilmar for a report of juveniles vandalizing a residence. Upon arrival,\nhe saw a white Ford Escort flee the area at a high rate of speed. When the vehicle was\nstopped, it was found to have been stolen. Saldana was the driver. One of the six\npassengers was Anthony Fuentes (Fuentes), whom Saldana identified in his wila as\nhaving snitched on him for carjacking. All were arrested for possession of stolen\nproperty, and Saldana was also arrested for reckless driving and driving without a license.\n       (6) Turlock Police Department No. 00-9172: On November 7, 2000, Fuentes was\nstopped by police while driving a stolen vehicle and was arrested for auto theft,\npossession of stolen property, and driving without a license. He said Saldana had given\nhim the car and car keys earlier that day. Saldana was then arrested for vehicle theft.\n       (7) Probation report by Probation Officer Delgado: On May 2, 2001, Saldana\nadmitted his moniker was Tito and that he began associating with Norteños while in\njunior high. Saldana said, however, he was no longer associated.\n25     For unknown reasons, no testimony was elicited concerning incident number 4.\n\n\n\n                                            40.\n\f       (8) Modesto Police Department No. 02-46694: On April 26, 2002, an officer\nstopped a vehicle driven by Michael Perez. Saldana and Fuentes were passengers. Both\nwere arrested for warrants.\n       (9) Notation by Probation Officer Garcia: On May 29, 2002, Saldana said the\nfour dots on his hand indicated being a Northerner. He admitted associating with\nNorteños.\n       (10) Turlock Police Department No. 02-10424: On October 29, 2002, officers\nwere dispatched to a shots-fired call in the 700 block of Angelus Street. The victim\nreported that her nephew, Saldana, had shot at her, after she got into an argument with\nSaldana and Fuentes. Another witness saw Saldana with an arm extended, pointing\ntoward the area of the victim, then he heard a gunshot. Saldana was arrested for assault\nwith a firearm. A latex balloon containing ten .22-caliber bullets was found on his\nperson.\n       (11) Juvenile hall intake assessment by Probation Officer Childers: On\nOctober 30, 2002, Saldana admitted being involved in the Norteño gang, but denied\n“claiming.”\n       (12) Probation report by Probation Officer Garcia: On April 17, 2003, Saldana\nadmitted associating with the Norteño gang.\n       (13) Notation by Officer Sharkie: On June 7, 2003, Sharkie conducted a\nprobation search of Saldana‟s bedroom. She found and confiscated one red hat, one red\nsweatshirt, and one red Heat jersey.\n       (14) Turlock Police Department No. 03-8782: On September 2, 2003, an officer\nresponded to Farr Street in Turlock in response to a report of a carjacking and\nkidnapping. The victim reported he had stopped at an intersection when a vehicle\nstopped in front of him and two individuals got out. One punched the victim and\nknocked him out. The victim identified Saldana and Fuentes as being with this person.\nThe victim said he was pulled from his car, thrown into its backseat, and driven to\n\n                                            41.\n\fanother area. This occurred because the victim had been associating with Sureños and\nwas believed to be giving them information. Fuentes and Saldana were arrested for\ncarjacking and kidnapping for carjacking.\n      (15) Turlock Police Department No. 04-7738: On August 4, 2004, police officers\nconducted a probation search at Saldana‟s residence. They located several firearms,\nincluding a sawed-off shotgun and ammunition, another modified shotgun, an illegally\nmodified .22-caliber rifle, a nine-millimeter revolver, and handgun ammunition. Saldana\nadmitted the firearms and ammunition were his, and said he had them to protect his\nresidence. His tattoos were documented as “W” on his left forearm and “S” on his right\nforearm, which Saldana stated stood for West Side. He had the word “Turlock” tattooed\non his upper back, and said he used the moniker Tito.\n      (16) Modesto Police Department No. 05-40681: On April 15, 2005, a Norteño\ngang membership roster was found on a wila in a cell at the Stanislaus County Jail that\nhoused Norteño gang members. Saldana‟s name was on the roster.\n      (17) DA Report No. 05-DA0234: On September 6, 2005, Mariscal interviewed\nthe victim of the earlier carjacking. The victim related he had been walking down the\nstreet when he was jumped by two individuals he identified as Saldana‟s cousins. They\ncalled him a rat and beat him up because he was going to testify against Saldana in the\ncarjacking case. The victim said he had been an active Norteño gang member with\nSaldana, and he identified Saldana as an active member.\n      (18) Modesto Police Department No. 07-73364: On August 3, 2007, Saldana was\nthe passenger in a vehicle with the license plate “Turloco.” Gutierrez and three others\nwere also in the car. Saldana said “VWS” stood for “Varrio West Side,” and he stated he\nwas a “Norteño only.”\n      (19) Turlock Police Department No. 07-11617: On November 27, 2007, officers\nconducted a parole search of Saldana‟s residence. In his bedroom closet, they found a\nloaded .38-caliber handgun. Saldana‟s girlfriend said the gun belonged to her, but gave\n\n                                            42.\n\fconflicting statements. Saldana was arrested for being a felon in possession of a firearm.\nDuring subsequent telephone calls to his girlfriend from jail, Saldana said Gutierrez was\ngoing to take blame for the gun. When the girlfriend said she would take the blame\nbecause she had already told police the gun was hers, Saldana said he would not allow\nher to take the blame, and that Gutierrez would do it.\n       (20) The current offense. When Gutierrez‟s wife was interviewed, she identified\nboth defendants as active gang members. On June 12, when booked into jail, Saldana\nadmitted he affiliated with Norteños.\n       As described in the statement of facts, ante, Mariscal opined that, on the date\nVillanueva was shot, Saldana was a Norteño gang member. Mariscal based this opinion\non all the reports and incidents he reviewed concerning Saldana.\n       2.     Applicable Legal Principles\n       “The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment [to the United States\nConstitution] provides: „In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right …\nto be confronted with the witnesses against him.‟ In [Crawford, supra,] 541 U.S. [at\npages] 53-54, [the United States Supreme Court] held that this provision bars „admission\nof testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was\nunavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-\nexamination.‟ A critical portion of this holding … is the phrase „testimonial statements.‟\nOnly statements of this sort cause the declarant to be a „witness‟ within the meaning of\nthe Confrontation Clause. [Citation.] It is the testimonial character of the statement that\nseparates it from other hearsay that, while subject to traditional limitations upon hearsay\nevidence, is not subject to the Confrontation Clause.” (Davis v. Washington (2006) 547\nU.S. 813, 821 (Davis). “Accordingly, after Davis, the determination of whether the\nadmission of a hearsay statement violates a defendant‟s rights under the confrontation\nclause turns on whether the statement is testimonial. If the statement is testimonial, it\nmust be excluded unless the declarant is unavailable as a witness and the defendant had a\n\n                                             43.\n\fprior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. If the statement is not testimonial, it\ndoes not implicate the confrontation clause, and the issue is simply whether the statement\nis admissible under state law as an exception to the hearsay rule.” (People v. Garcia\n(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 261, 291; see People v. Cage (2007) 40 Cal.4th 965, 981-982 &\nfn. 10, 984.)\n       In Crawford, the United States Supreme Court declined to give a precise definition\nof “testimonial statements,” although it gave as “formulations of [the] core class of\n„testimonial‟ statements” “„ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent — that\nis, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant\nwas unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would\nreasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,‟ [citation]; „extrajudicial statements …\ncontained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior\ntestimony, or confessions,‟ [citation]; „statements that were made under circumstances\nwhich would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be\navailable for use at a later trial,‟ [citation]”; and “[s]tatements taken by police officers in\nthe course of interrogations,” with the term “interrogation” being used in its colloquial,\nrather than any technical legal, sense. (Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. at pp. 51-52, 53, fn. 4.)\nThe court observed that “[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government\nofficers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an\nacquaintance does not.” (Id. at p. 51.)\n       In Davis, the high court declined to attempt to classify all conceivable statements\n— even those made in response to questioning by police — as either testimonial or\nnontestimonial. (Davis, supra, 547 U.S. at p. 822.) It did further define the categories,\nhowever, stating: “Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police\ninterrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the\ninterrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are\ntestimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing\n\n                                              44.\n\femergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past\nevents potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.” (Ibid., fn. omitted.)\n       From Davis, the California Supreme Court has derived several basic principles.\n“First, …, the confrontation clause is concerned solely with hearsay statements that are\ntestimonial, in that they are out-of-court analogs, in purpose and form, of the testimony\ngiven by witnesses at trial. Second, though a statement need not be sworn under oath to\nbe testimonial, it must have occurred under circumstances that imparted, to some degree,\nthe formality and solemnity characteristic of testimony. Third, the statement must have\nbeen given and taken primarily for the purpose ascribed to testimony — to establish or\nprove some past fact for possible use in a criminal trial. Fourth, the primary purpose for\nwhich a statement was given and taken is to be determined „objectively,‟ considering all\nthe circumstances that might reasonably bear on the intent of the participants in the\nconversation. Fifth, sufficient formality and solemnity are present when, in a\nnonemergency situation, one responds to questioning by law enforcement officials, where\ndeliberate falsehoods might be criminal offenses. Sixth, statements elicited by law\nenforcement officials are not testimonial if the primary purpose in giving and receiving\nthem is to deal with a contemporaneous emergency, rather than to produce evidence\nabout past events for possible use at a criminal trial.” (People v. Cage, supra, 40 Cal.4th\nat p. 984, fns. omitted.) “It is the „primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute\nfor trial testimony‟ that implicates the confrontation clause. [Citation.] Consequently, if\na statement is not offered for its truth, or is nontestimonial in character, the confrontation\nclause is not a bar to admission.” (People v. Blacksher (2011) 52 Cal.4th 769, 813; see\nMichigan v. Bryant (2011) 562 U.S. ___ [131 S.Ct. 1143, 1155].)\n       It is settled that, “because the culture and habits of gangs are matters which are\n„sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the\ntrier of fact‟ [citation], opinion testimony from a gang expert, subject to the limitations\napplicable to expert testimony generally, is proper. [Citation.]” (People v. Vy (2004) 122\n\n                                             45.\n\fCal.App.4th 1209, 1223, fn. 9.) “„An expert may generally base his opinion on any\n“matter” known to him, including hearsay not otherwise admissible, which may\n“reasonably … be relied upon” for that purpose. [Citations.]‟” (People v. Carpenter\n(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 403, superseded by statute on another ground as stated in Verdin\nv. Superior Court (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1096, 1106-1107.) “And because Evidence Code\nsection 802 allows an expert witness to „state on direct examination the reasons for his\nopinion and the matter … upon which it is based,‟ an expert witness whose opinion is\nbased on such inadmissible matter can, when testifying, describe the material that forms\nthe basis of the opinion. [Citations.]” (People v. Gardeley (1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 618-\n619 (Gardeley).)\n       The application of Crawford to such “basis evidence” is less settled. Several\nappellate opinions have held Crawford does not apply, reasoning variously that hearsay\nin support of expert opinion is not the sort of testimonial hearsay the use of which\nCrawford condemned (People v. Ramirez, supra, 153 Cal.App.4th at p. 1427) or that\nhearsay relied on by experts in formulating their opinions is not testimonial because it is\nnot offered for the truth of the fact stated (People v. Cooper (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 731,\n747; People v. Thomas, supra, 130 Cal.App.4th at p. 1210) and the expert is subject to\ncross-examination concerning his or her opinions (People v. Sisneros (2009) 174\nCal.App.4th 142, 154). In People v. Hill (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1104, by contrast, the\ncourt determined that “where basis evidence consists of an out-of-court statement, the\njury will often be required to determine or assume the truth of the statement in order to\nutilize it to evaluate the expert‟s opinion.” (Id. at p. 1131, fn. omitted.) Nevertheless, the\ncourt found itself bound by Gardeley and similar California Supreme Court precedent,\nand so concluded the trial court in the case before it properly determined the challenged\nbasis evidence did not violate the hearsay rule or confrontation clause, since it was not\noffered for its truth but only to evaluate the expert‟s opinions. (Hill, supra, at p. 1131.)\n\n\n\n                                             46.\n\f       The United States Supreme Court itself has produced fractured opinions\nconcerning Crawford‟s application to expert testimony and the information on which\nsuch testimony is based. (See, e.g., Williams v. Illinois (2012) 567 U.S. ___ [132 S.Ct.\n2221]; Bullcoming v. New Mexico (2011) 564 U.S. ___ [131 S.Ct. 2705]; Melendez-Diaz\nv. Massachusetts (2009) 557 U.S. 305.) Thus far, the California Supreme Court has\nattempted to make sense out of these opinions in cases involving basis evidence such as\nautopsy and laboratory analysis reports. (People v. Rutterschmidt (2012) 55 Cal.4th 650,\n655-656, 658-659 (Rutterschmidt); People v. Dungo (2012) 55 Cal.4th 608, 612, 617-\n618; People v. Lopez (2012) 55 Cal.4th 569, 573, 579-582; see also People v. Geier\n(2007) 41 Cal.4th 555, 593-594, 596-607.) It has yet to do so, however, with respect to\nthe basis evidence of a gang expert, whose testimony is usually based, at least in part, on\nhis or her own experience and investigation.\n       Post-Crawford, reliability is not part of the confrontation clause inquiry. (People\nv. Wilson (2005) 36 Cal.4th 309, 343.) It remains relevant with respect to expert\ntestimony, however: “[A]ny material that forms the basis of an expert‟s opinion\ntestimony must be reliable. [Citation.] For „the law does not accord to the expert‟s\nopinion the same degree of credence or integrity as it does the data underlying the\nopinion. Like a house built on sand, the expert‟s opinion is no better than the facts on\nwhich it is based.‟ [Citation.] [¶] So long as this threshold requirement of reliability is\nsatisfied, even matter that is ordinarily inadmissible can form the proper basis for an\nexpert‟s opinion testimony. [Citations.]” (Gardeley, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 618.)\n       The California Supreme Court has cautioned that “prejudice may arise if, „“under\nthe guise of reasons,”‟ the expert‟s detailed explanation „“[brings] before the jury\nincompetent hearsay evidence.”‟ [Citations.]” (People v. Montiel (1993) 5 Cal.4th 877,\n918-919.) “Because an expert‟s need to consider extrajudicial matters, and a jury‟s need\nfor information sufficient to evaluate an expert opinion, may conflict with an accused‟s\n\n\n\n                                             47.\n\finterest in avoiding substantive use of unreliable hearsay, disputes in this area must\ngenerally be left to the trial court‟s sound judgment. [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 919.)\n       “Most often, hearsay problems will be cured by an instruction that matters\nadmitted through an expert go only to the basis of his opinion and should not be\nconsidered for their truth. [Citation.]” (People v. Montiel, supra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 919.) In\naddition, “[a] trial court … „has considerable discretion to control the form in which the\nexpert is questioned to prevent the jury from learning of incompetent hearsay.‟\n[Citation.] A trial court also has discretion „to weigh the probative value of inadmissible\nevidence relied upon by an expert witness … against the risk that the jury might\nimproperly consider it as independent proof of the facts recited therein.‟ [Citation.] This\nis because a witness‟s on-the-record recitation of sources relied on for an expert opinion\ndoes not transform inadmissible matter into „independent proof‟ of any fact. [Citations.]”\n(Gardeley, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 619.) Evidence Code section 352 further “authorizes\nthe court to exclude from an expert‟s testimony any hearsay matter whose irrelevance,\nunreliability, or potential for prejudice outweighs its proper probative value. [Citation.]”\n(People v. Montiel, supra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 919.)\n       3.     Analysis\n       As previously described, defendants challenge Mariscal‟s recitation of their prior\nbad acts on Crawford, reliability, and Evidence Code section 352 grounds. “„It is, of\ncourse, “the general rule”‟ — to which we find no exception here — „“that questions\nrelating to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of\na specific and timely objection in the trial court on the ground sought to be urged on\nappeal.”‟ [Citations.]” (People v. Alvarez (1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 186.) This rule applies\nto constitutional claims (People v. Rudd (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 620, 628-629), unless\n“(1) it „is of a kind (e.g., failure to instruct sua sponte; erroneous instruction affecting\ndefendant‟s substantial rights) that required no trial court action by the defendant to\npreserve it, or (2) the new arguments do not invoke facts or legal standards different from\n\n                                              48.\n\fthose the trial court itself was asked to apply, but merely assert that the trial court‟s act or\nomission, insofar as wrong for the reasons actually presented to that court, had the\nadditional legal consequence of violating the Constitution.‟ [Citation.]” (People v.\nZamudio (2008) 43 Cal.4th 327, 353, italics omitted.)\n       The Crawford objection was clearly before the trial court. We will assume, for the\nsake of argument, that the isolated references by the court and counsel to reliability,\nprejudice, and probative value were sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a timely and\nspecific objection with respect to those grounds. (Compare People v. Waidla (2000) 22\nCal.4th 690, 726, fn. 8 [“„bare reference‟” to inability to cross-examine insufficient to\npreserve confrontation clause claim] with People v. Bojorquez (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th\n335, 343, fn. 5 [objection that “„the prejudice would outweigh the probative value‟”\nsufficient to invoke Evid. Code, § 352].) The problem is, Gutierrez neither secured a\nruling initially nor reiterated his objections when Mariscal testified before the jury.\nSaldana likewise did not secure a ruling initially; although he did request and obtain a\ncontinuing objection on confrontation clause grounds, he did not reiterate any of the other\ngrounds for exclusion he now asserts.\n       “„[T]he absence of an adverse ruling precludes any appellate challenge.‟\n[Citation.] In other words, when, as here, the defendant does not secure a ruling, he does\nnot preserve the point. That is the rule. No exception is available.” (People v. Rowland\n(1992) 4 Cal.4th 238, 259.) A “properly directed” in limine motion may preserve an\nobjection for appeal, but again, “the proponent must secure an express ruling from the\ncourt. [Citation.]” (People v. Ramos (1997) 15 Cal.4th 1133, 1171, italics added.)\n       “[A] motion in limine to exclude evidence is a sufficient manifestation of\nobjection to protect the record on appeal when it satisfies the basic requirements of\n\n\n\n\n                                              49.\n\fEvidence Code section 353,[26] i.e.: (1) a specific legal ground for exclusion is advanced\nand subsequently raised on appeal; (2) the motion is directed to a particular, identifiable\nbody of evidence; and (3) the motion is made at a time before or during trial when the\ntrial judge can determine the evidentiary question in its appropriate context. When such a\nmotion is made and denied, the issue is preserved for appeal. On the other hand, if a\nmotion in limine does not satisfy each of these requirements, a proper objection satisfying\nEvidence Code section 353 must be made to preserve the evidentiary issue for appeal.”\n(People v. Morris (1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 190, disapproved on another ground in People v.\nStansbury (1995) 9 Cal.4th 824, 830, fn. 1.)\n       In responding to the in limine motion, the trial court here made it clear it could not\nmake a blanket ruling on defendants‟ Crawford claim, was making no ruling on whether\nthe basis evidence met any other requirements for being placed before the jury, and\nwould have to consider each type of evidence as it was presented. Subsequently, it also\nmade clear that Saldana‟s continuing objection under Crawford did not encompass, or\nexcuse Saldana from making, objections on other grounds.\n       Under these circumstances, we conclude defendants failed to preserve some, if not\nall, of the issues for appeal. “Because the trial court did not rule on [their] objections in\nlimine, [they] „[were] obligated to press for such a ruling and to object to [the evidence]\nuntil [they] obtained one. [They] failed to do so, thus depriving the trial court of the\n\n\n\n\n26      Evidence Code section 353 provides: “A verdict or finding shall not be set aside,\nnor shall the judgment or decision based thereon be reversed, by reason of the erroneous\nadmission of evidence unless: [¶] (a) There appears of record an objection to or a\nmotion to exclude or to strike the evidence that was timely made and so stated as to make\nclear the specific ground of the objection or motion; and [¶] (b) The court which passes\nupon the effect of the error or errors is of the opinion that the admitted evidence should\nhave been excluded on the ground stated and that the error or errors complained of\nresulted in a miscarriage of justice.”\n\n\n\n                                             50.\n\fopportunity to correct potential error.‟ [Citation.]” (People v. Ramos, supra, 15 Cal.4th\nat p. 1171.)\n       In any event, we disagree with defendants‟ assertion they were prejudiced by\nadmission of the challenged evidence.27 In this regard, defendants argue that gang\nevidence is “powerfully prejudicial.” They say there was ample evidence, apart from\ntheir prior acts, upon which Mariscal could have opined they were gang members.\nAccordingly, they conclude, the prosecutor brought in those bad acts to show criminal\ndisposition and bad character, as a means of creating an inference defendants were guilty\nas charged based on their longstanding gang involvement. Defendants say the evidence\nwas “designed to inflame the passions and prejudices of the jury” against them.\n       Generally speaking, “[t]he erroneous admission of expert testimony only warrants\nreversal if „it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party\nwould have been reached in the absence of the error.‟ [Citations.]” (People v. Prieto\n(2003) 30 Cal.4th 226, 247, quoting People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836\n(Watson).) Error in the admission of nontestimonial hearsay is also assessed under the\nWatson standard (People v. Davis (2005) 36 Cal.4th 510, 538; People v. Garcia, supra,\n\n\n27      Accordingly, we need not address Saldana‟s undeveloped assertion that if trial\ncounsel forfeited the issue, Saldana received ineffective assistance of counsel. Saldana\nchides the Attorney General for merging two issues contained in Saldana‟s opening brief.\nSaldana says this violates California Rules of Court, rule 8.204(a)(1)(B), which requires\nthat a brief “[s]tate each point under a separate heading or subheading summarizing the\npoint, and support each point by argument and, if possible, by citation of authority .…”\nSaldana says the Attorney General has “waived response to these arguments by failing to\ncomply with the rules of court.”\n        In our view, the Attorney General has fully complied with the rule. The true issue\nis whether the gang expert should have been permitted to testify to defendants‟ prior bad\nacts. That Saldana has chosen to place constitutional and state evidentiary grounds for\nhis claim of error into separate issues does not mean the Attorney General was required\nto employ identical organization. On the other hand, we doubt Saldana‟s ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim complies with the same rule.\n\n\n\n                                             51.\n\f168 Cal.App.4th at p. 292), as are error in the admission of prior crimes evidence (People\nv. Williams (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 587, 612) and a trial court‟s determinations under\nEvidence Code section 352 (People v. Gonzales (2011) 51 Cal.4th 894, 924). Crawford\nerror, on the other hand, is assessed under the harmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt\nstandard of Chapman v. California (1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 (Chapman) (People v. Archer\n(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1380, 1394; see also People v. Harrison (2005) 35 Cal.4th 208,\n239), as are due process violations (see People v. Mena (2012) 54 Cal.4th 146, 159;\nPeople v. Malone (1988) 47 Cal.3d 1, 22). “Harmless-error review looks … to the basis\non which „the jury actually rested its verdict.‟ [Citation.] The inquiry, in other words, is\nnot whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty verdict would surely have\nbeen rendered, but whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in this trial was surely\nunattributable to the error.” (Sullivan v. Louisiana (1993) 508 U.S. 275, 279.)\n       “Only when evidence „is so extremely unfair that its admission violates\nfundamental conceptions of justice,‟ [citation], [has the United States Supreme Court]\nimposed a constraint tied to the Due Process Clause.” (Perry v. New Hampshire (2012)\n565 U.S. ___ [132 S.Ct. 716, 723]; see also People v. Fuiava (2012) 53 Cal.4th 622, 696-\n697 & cases cited.) “„Only if there are no permissible inferences the jury may draw from\nthe evidence can its admission violate due process. Even then, the evidence must “be of\nsuch quality as necessarily prevents a fair trial.” [Citations.] Only under such\ncircumstances can it be inferred that the jury must have used the evidence for an\nimproper purpose.‟ [Citation.]” (People v. Albarran (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 214, 229,\nitalics added.)\n\n              “California courts have long recognized the potential prejudicial\n       effect of gang evidence. However, they have admitted such evidence when\n       the very reason for the crime, usually murder, is gang related. [Citations.]\n       Evidence of gang membership has also been admitted to prove bias,\n       provided it is not cumulative to other properly admitted and less\n       inflammatory evidence. [Citations.]\n\n\n\n                                            52.\n\f              “Due to its potential prejudicial impact on a jury, our Supreme Court\n       has condemned the introduction of „evidence of gang membership if only\n       tangentially relevant, given its highly inflammatory impact.‟ [Citation.]\n       Gang evidence should not be admitted at trial where its sole relevance is to\n       show a defendant‟s criminal disposition or bad character as a means of\n       creating an inference the defendant committed the charged offense.\n       [Citations.] Such evidence is only admissible when it is logically relevant\n       to some material issue at trial other than character trait evidence.\n       [Citation.]” (People v. Sanchez (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1449.)\n       In the present case, the evidence was logically relevant to material issues at trial\nother than character trait or disposition, including membership in the gang (which in turn\nwas relevant to the gang enhancement allegations), the existence of a criminal street gang\nas defined in section 186.22, subdivision (f), and to corroborate information contained in\nthe wilas (which in turn was relevant to identifying defendants as the authors thereof).28\n(See People v. Gutierrez (2009) 45 Cal.4th 789, 820 [evidence regarding defendant‟s\naffiliation with gang, gang‟s prior criminal activities, and notes found in defendant‟s cell\nwere relevant to gang enhancement allegation].) Although prosecutors may not “have\nany right to „over-prove their case or put on all the evidence that they have‟” (People v.\nWilliams, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 610), neither will we require them to risk “under-\nproving” their case. Even assuming some of the prior bad acts may have been\ncumulative, some were not. “Such relevant and admissible evidence could properly have\nincluded even the most inflammatory incidents. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 613.)\n       As the evidence was relevant to prove “a fact of consequence,” its admission did\nnot violate due process. (People v. Foster (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1301, 1335.) Assuming\nsome was testimonial, we likewise have no problem concluding any error was harmless\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Defendants testified and admitted being Norteños. Gutierrez\n\n28     “„Relevant evidence‟ means evidence, including evidence relevant to the\ncredibility of a witness or hearsay declarant, having any tendency in reason to prove or\ndisprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action.”\n(Evid. Code, § 210.)\n\n\n\n                                             53.\n\fadmitted having been convicted in 1999 of felony assault, while Saldana admitted having\nbeen convicted of carjacking in 2006, at which time he was also charged with\nkidnapping. (See People v. Allison (1989) 48 Cal.3d 879, 889-890 [defendant not\nprejudiced by prosecutor‟s elicitation of testimony from witness that defendant was in\ncounty jail on unrelated charges at particular time, where defense counsel elicited same\ninformation in cross-examination of said witness and defendant revealed same\ninformation in own testimony].) The record does not support defendants‟ claim the\nevidence was offered in an attempt to show criminal disposition or inflame the jury\n(compare People v. Memory (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 835, 858-859, 862-864), and we\nfind no reasonable likelihood jurors‟ passions were inflamed (see People v. Williams,\nsupra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 612). Counsel for Gutierrez elicited, in his cross-\nexamination of Mariscal, that the prior incidents were merely contacts with law\nenforcement, and that if counsel yelled at a police officer out in the hall or something\nsimilar, that could be listed as a contact. Counsel further elicited that Gutierrez was not\nconvicted for the prior acts except for the one in 1999. Counsel for Saldana elicited, in\nhis cross-examination of Mariscal, that part of Mariscal‟s opinion was based on reports as\nopposed to his own personal knowledge, and that reliability was always an issue with\nrespect to reports, in that Mariscal had to make a determination whether a report was to\nbe believed.\n       Significantly, jurors were instructed not to disregard the testimony of any witness\n(which here included defendants) “without a reason or because of prejudice or desire to\nfavor one side or the other.” They were told they had to decide whether information on\nwhich an expert relied was “true and accurate.” They were also told, however, that in\nreaching their conclusions as expert witnesses, Mariscal and Teso “considered statements\nmade by the defendants, other gang members, other gang experts, police officers,\ndetectives, probation officers, and parole officers. You may consider those statements\nonly to evaluate the expert‟s opinion. Do not consider those statements as proof that the\n\n                                             54.\n\finformation contained in the statements is true.” (Italics added.) Finally, jurors were\ninstructed:\n\n             “You may consider evidence of gang activity only for the limited\n       purpose of deciding whether defendant acted within [sic] the intent,\n       purpose, and knowledge that are required to prove the gang-related crime\n       and enhancement charge or the defendant had a motive to commit the crime\n       charged.\n\n              “You may also consider this evidence when you evaluate the\n       credibility or believability of a witness. And when you consider the facts\n       and information relied on by an expert in reaching his or her opinion.\n\n             “You may not consider this evidence for any other purpose.\n       [¶] … [¶]\n\n               “You may not conclude from this evidence that the defendant is a\n       person of bad character or that he has a disposition to commit crime.”\n       (Italics added.)\n       We presume jurors followed these instructions. (People v. Yeoman (2003) 31\nCal.4th 93, 139; People v. Williams, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 613.) Taken together\nwith evidence of guilt that, in our view, was very strong, we conclude any error was\nharmless under any standard.\nC.     The Wilas (Gutierrez, Saldana)\n       Defendants claim the trial court erred when it failed to redact those portions of the\nwilas attributed to them that were more prejudicial than probative. They say admission\nof the evidence violated their federal and state due process rights to a fair trial. We\nconclude any error was harmless.\n       1.     Background\n       The prosecutor moved, in limine, for admission of the wilas that are described in\nthe statement of facts, ante. He asserted they were highly probative on the issues of\npremeditation, motive for Villanueva‟s removal from Norteño ranks, and defendants‟\n\n\n\n\n                                             55.\n\fknowledge of the criminal gang activity of the Norteño gang as required for proof of the\ngang enhancement allegation. Copies of the wilas were attached to the motion.29\n       Gutierrez asserted that portions of the wilas were irrelevant, highly prejudicial,\nand inflammatory, and should be excluded under Evidence Code section 352. An attempt\nby counsel to reach an agreement on redactions was unsuccessful, and so the matter was\nleft for the court‟s determination.\n       Saldana objected only to certain portions of his wila. He first objected to No. 6, in\nwhich Saldana related he had two strikes, one for carjacking and one for assault with a\nfirearm.30 The prosecutor conceded Saldana only had one strike — for carjacking — and\nthat the strike allegation had been bifurcated. He argued, however, that the same\ninformation was going to come in through the gang expert‟s testimony concerning the\nprimary activities of the gang, and also that, considered in conjunction with the answer in\nNo. 15 about “Chubbs” (Anthony Fuentes), it was probative on the now-jury-issue of\nauthentication. Gutierrez joined, noting No. 6 of his wila related that he had one strike.\nHe argued the connotation of having a strike was particularly prejudicial, beyond even\nthe criminal record itself. The trial court directed the prosecutor to redact references to\nstrikes, but to leave the charges. As for the reference in Saldana‟s wila to assault with a\nfirearm, the court declined to redact it, saying, “[I]f that is what he or somebody else puts,\nthat‟s what stays in there,” and if it was incorrect, the defense could address the\ndiscrepancy at trial.\n\n\n29     The prosecutor‟s in limine motion also addressed authentication. The trial court\nheld an Evidence Code section 403 hearing on the issue. It determined there was\nsufficient proof of authenticity to allow the wilas to go before the jury, but permitted\ndefendants to challenge authentication in front of the jury.\n30     The information contained in the wilas corresponded to the Norteño new arrival\nquestionnaire and apparently was numbered accordingly. The questionnaire itself is not\ncontained in the record.\n\n\n\n                                             56.\n\f       Saldana next objected to No. 10, which set out the times and places he was\nincarcerated beginning in 2004, the charges he faced, the fact he was on parole at one\npoint, and three people who were in custody with him at each location. He argued this\nportion of the wila was confusing and had no real probative value. The prosecutor\nresponded that there would be expert testimony the people listed were Norteños. He\nsought admission of No. 10 in its entirety, to show an ongoing association of three or\nmore members and to counter any suggestion Varrio West Side Turlock was merely a\nneighborhood or club. The prosecutor argued that the listing in the wila of individuals\nfrom other cliques was consistent with the gang expert‟s anticipated testimony, and went\ndirectly to one of the required elements of section 186.22. The prosecutor agreed the\ninformation was being offered for a limited purpose, and noted the jury instructions\nwould directly address the limited use to which the gang expert‟s testimony could be put.\nThe trial court ruled No. 10 would be allowed, subject to a limiting instruction.\n       Counsel for Saldana stated: “Then I would object to a copy of [exhibit] 56 being\npresented to the jury if -- it sounds like it is all going to get in, then let‟s let it all in and\ngive them the original and let them decide whether that was actually written by Mr.\nSaldana.” He emphasized that he wanted the jury to have the original, not an enlarged\ncopy. Asked by the court if he was withdrawing any objections, counsel stated: “Yes.\nBut I want them to see the original.” After a brief discussion about whether the\nenlargement could also be admitted, the court clarified, “[Saldana] is withdrawing any\nobjection, so long as the original is introduced into evidence.” Counsel for Saldana\nresponded, “Yes.”\n       The hearing then turned to Gutierrez‟s objections. He first objected to No. 6,\nwhich related that he had one strike for assault with a firearm in 1999. Gutierrez argued\nthe whole area ought to be redacted, because typically a jury would not be told about\nsomeone‟s criminal background. The court ruled the word “strike” would be redacted,\nbut the remainder would be admitted for a limited purpose.\n\n                                                57.\n\f       Gutierrez next objected to No. 10, which related the same sort of information as\nwas contained in No. 10 of Saldana‟s wila, and stated that at one point, Gutierrez was\nreturned to county jail for “666/187” but charges were never filed. Counsel for Gutierrez\nargued that allowing the jury to hear about assaults with a firearm and attempted murder,\nfor which charges were never filed, was “incredibly prejudicial” and would cause jurors\nto be biased against him because they would think somehow he got away with something.\nCounsel also argued this was in essence a coerced statement rather than an admission,\nsince people were required to answer these questions in order to survive in jail. The\nprosecutor responded that, as was the case with Saldana, No. 10 showed association with\ngang members from other groups and the requisite ongoing association of three or more\npeople. The prosecutor also argued it would counter the anticipated defense argument,\nthat “this is nothing but a bunch of boys who were foolish or knuckleheads .…” The\ncourt found no evidence of coercion, and ruled No. 10 was admissible, subject to a\nlimiting instruction.\n       Gutierrez next objected to No. 24, which read, “Yes, I will assist La Casa in a\nremoval at any time.” Defense counsel expressed concern the jury could take that to\nmean Gutierrez was prepared to kill someone. He also related that he “probably” did not\nintend to contest that Gutierrez was the source of at least some of the information in the\nwila, and so, since he was “not going to be aggressively or non-aggressively disputing a\nlot of things in front of this jury,” did not believe the prosecutor had “all these big\nhurdles .…” The trial court ruled No. 24 would be received, subject to a limiting\ninstruction.\n       Gutierrez next objected to No. 25, which listed other charges pending against him.\nDefense counsel argued the fact someone might have charges pending was not relevant\nand was prejudicial overkill, and he expressed concern the jury would conclude Gutierrez\nwas someone who did not observe the law. The prosecutor argued the information, when\nconsidered in conjunction with the chronology and charges listed in No. 10, was\n\n                                              58.\n\fprobative of authentication, and the fact Gutierrez said he was arrested for manufacturing\nwent to the primary activities of the gang. The information coming from Gutierrez\nhimself would add to the credibility of the gang expert‟s opinion testimony concerning\nthe primary activities of the gang. The trial court ruled the evidence would be allowed,\nsubject to a limiting instruction.\n       Gutierrez had no further objections. The trial court again confirmed that counsel\nfor Saldana wanted the entire wila admitted as to his client.\n       The wilas were admitted into evidence during Mariscal‟s testimony. With respect\nto Gutierrez‟s wila, Mariscal testified in part that his investigation revealed other\nevidence showing Gutierrez had a conviction for assault with a firearm in 1999; one of\nthe charges listed — possessing pills for sale — was consistent with one of the primary\nactivities of the Norteño gang; and Gutierrez‟s pending charges included a moving\nviolation, which involved Gutierrez being stopped approximately two weeks before the\nshooting in the white Altima that was burned in San Jose after the shooting.\n       Mariscal read No. 10 to the jury. He explained that the references to “3Ns” were\nconsistent with someone reporting other active Norteños with whom he was housed, and\nthat this played into the requirement of an ongoing association of three or more people.\nThis was an example of a gang member associating with other Norteños. Mariscal\ntestified No. 16 read, “I have no problems functioning with la casa‟s expectations,” which\ntold Mariscal that Gutierrez was fully willing to be an active participant in the Norteño\norganization in custody, and to follow their rules, policies, and expected behavior. With\nrespect to No. 24, in which Gutierrez wrote he would assist La Casa in a removal at any\ntime, Mariscal testified this indicated Gutierrez was willing to participate in a removal or\nassault upon someone if the gang determined a fellow gang member was to be removed\nor assaulted for any reason. Mariscal also read No. 15 to the jury, in which Gutierrez\nexplained how Villanueva was threatening the lives of Gutierrez and his children, and\nabout the altercation in which Saldana was assaulted.\n\n                                             59.\n\f        Mariscal‟s testimony concerning Saldana‟s wila was similar with respect to the\nmeaning and significance of various portions, and how the wila played into his opinions\nin this case.31 Mariscal read No. 15 to the jury; in it, Saldana stated that, although he was\nnot aware if Villanueva was active or nonactive, on several occasions he promoted\nhimself as a degenerate. Mariscal explained that a degenerate was the worse possible\nthing a gang member could be in the eyes of the gang. Saldana also wrote about how\nVillanueva and his companions threatened Saldana and his family, and about the\naltercation at the wedding reception. Saldana said they arrived in a car driven by\nFuentes, also known as Chubbs, who “snitched” on Saldana for carjacking in 2004.\nSaldana wrote that people were saying “they” killed Villanueva because they had the\nmost problems with him, and now people were threatening to kill their children and their\nmother.\n        Gutierrez testified that he suffered a felony assault conviction in 1999. He\nadmitted Northerners dealt drugs as one of their primary activities, and that, after the\nMarch 22 fight, he hung around with other gang members, dealing drugs. He testified\nMariscal was correct when he said Norteños dealt drugs as one of their primary activities.\nHe testified that although he did not know Bond No. 13, he answered yes to the question\nabout it just to let “them” know he would assist in “whatever it was.” He also testified\nthat when he wrote he had no problem functioning with La Casa‟s expectations, he meant\nwhatever was expected or asked by the Norteño gang. With respect to his answer about\nassisting in removal, he explained that to him, removal meant assaulting someone,\npossibly a fellow gang member. So far as he knew, there was no way a Norteño got\nremoved other than being assaulted.\n\n\n\n31      At one point, counsel for Saldana objected that Mariscal was not reading the entire\nwila.\n\n\n\n                                             60.\n\f       Saldana testified that he was convicted of carjacking in 2006. He was also facing\na kidnapping charge with a potential life sentence, and so he accepted a deal in which the\nkidnapping charge was dropped and he received three years. Asked why, if he did not\nshoot Villanueva, he fled with his brother, Saldana brought up his parole status. Asked\nwhat he meant when he wrote, “It would be an honor to assist la casa in a removal,” he\nresponded he did not know. Asked if he would do anything the gang told him to do, he\nreplied, “Yeah, pretty much.”\n       The limiting instructions given to the jury with respect to the gang evidence are\ndescribed ante. In addition, jurors were told they had heard evidence defendants made an\noral or written statement before trial; jurors were to decide whether a defendant made any\nsuch statement in whole or in part; if they decided a defendant made such a statement, it\nwas to be considered along with all the other evidence, and jurors were to decide how\nmuch importance to give it; and they could not convict a defendant of any crime based on\nhis out-of-court statements alone.\n\n\n\n\n                                            61.\n\f       2.     Analysis32\n       Evidence Code section 352 provides: “The court in its discretion may exclude\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its\nadmission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger\nof undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.” Under this\nstatute,\n\n       “[a] trial court may exclude otherwise relevant evidence when its probative\n       value is substantially outweighed by concerns of undue prejudice,\n       confusion, or consumption of time. [Citations.] „“„Prejudice‟ as\n       contemplated by [Evidence Code] section 352 is not so sweeping as to\n       include any evidence the opponent finds inconvenient. Evidence is not\n       prejudicial, as that term is used in a section 352 context, merely because it\n       undermines the opponent‟s position or shores up that of the proponent. The\n       ability to do so is what makes evidence relevant. The code speaks in terms\n       of undue prejudice. Unless the dangers of undue prejudice, confusion, or\n       time consumption „“substantially outweigh”‟ the probative value of\n       relevant evidence, a section 352 objection should fail. [Citation.] „“The\n       „prejudice‟ referred to in Evidence Code section 352 applies to evidence\n       which uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against the defendant as\n\n32     The Attorney General says Saldana forfeited his claim of error when his trial\ncounsel expressly withdrew his objections and request for redaction and asked that the\nwila attributed to Saldana be presented to the jury in its entirety. Generally speaking, a\ndefendant who withdraws his or her objection to evidence cannot complain, on appeal, of\nits admission. (People v. Jones (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1229, 1255; People v. Robertson\n(1989) 48 Cal.3d 18, 44.) Under the circumstances here, however, “[w]e will assume …\nthat [Saldana‟s] decision to do so was an instance of a party making the best of an\nallegedly erroneous ruling, and therefore does not bar his claim on appeal. [Citation.]”\n(People v. Riggs (2008) 44 Cal.4th 248, 289.)\n       The Attorney General also contends Gutierrez‟s claim has been forfeited, because\nGutierrez has simply joined in Saldana‟s contention on appeal without supplying\nargument on the issue as it applies to Gutierrez himself. The Attorney General says\nGutierrez‟s claim involves different evidence and a different defendant than Saldana‟s\nclaim; hence, the prejudice analysis must be different. In light of the similarity between\nthe wilas and the overall trial evidence as it pertains to both defendants — as\ndemonstrated by the Attorney General‟s own argument on the merits of admission of the\nwilas — we decline to find forfeiture on Gutierrez‟s part.\n\n\n\n                                             62.\n\f       an individual and which has very little effect on the issues.… [E]vidence\n       should be excluded as unduly prejudicial when it is of such nature as to\n       inflame the emotions of the jury, motivating them to use the information,\n       not to logically evaluate the point upon which it is relevant, but to reward\n       or punish one side because of the jurors‟ emotional reaction. In such a\n       circumstance, the evidence is unduly prejudicial because of the substantial\n       likelihood the jury will use it for an illegitimate purpose.” [Citation.]‟\n       [Citation.]” (People v. Scott (2011) 52 Cal.4th 452, 490-491; see People v.\n       Holford (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 155, 167.)\n       “[T]he trial court enjoys broad discretion in assessing whether the probative value\nof particular evidence is outweighed by concerns of undue prejudice, confusion or\nconsumption of time. [Citation.] Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily\nvested in the trial court, its exercise of that discretion „must not be disturbed on appeal\nexcept on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or\npatently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]‟\n[Citation.]” (People v. Rodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125.) The trial court\nneed not expressly weigh prejudice against probative value, or state it has done so.\n(People v. Waidla, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 724, fn. 6.)\n       We find no abuse of discretion in the present case. Some of the information\nrecited in the wilas about defendants‟ criminal activity came before the jury through their\nown testimony, and so was probative on the question of the wilas‟ authenticity, a disputed\nquestion upon which the jury had to make the final determination. It can hardly have\ncome as a surprise to jurors that defendants had been in custody and faced charges\nbeyond those for which they were on trial; in addition to admitting he had a prior felony\nconviction for assault, Gutierrez testified he had been in a lot of fights, mostly because of\nthe people with whom he associated, said he planned to sell marijuana on the day of the\nshooting, and admitted intentionally burning a vehicle; while Saldana admitted his prior\nconviction for carjacking also originally involved a kidnapping charge, and that he was\non parole at the time of the shooting.\n\n\n\n\n                                             63.\n\f       Many of the past or pending charges recited in the wilas were probative of\nMariscal‟s opinions concerning the Norteños‟ primary activities and pattern of criminal\ngang activity, and the prosecutor questioned Mariscal about them in that context.\nDefendants point to the fact there was testimony Stanislaus County contained 3,000 to\n4,000 documented Norteños, but the prosecutor was still required to prove every element\nof the section 186.22, subdivision (b) enhancement, including the existence of a criminal\nstreet gang as defined in subdivision (f) of section 186.22. Thus, he had to prove not only\nan ongoing association of three or more persons, but also the primary activity or activities\nof that group, and that the group‟s members engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity\nas defined in subdivision (e) of the statute. (See People v. Coddington (2000) 23 Cal.4th\n529, 597, overruled on another ground in Price v. Superior Court (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1046,\n1069, fn. 13.) The prosecutor was not obliged to prove those elements through other\nevidence simply because he might have had the means to do so. (See People v. Watson\n(2008) 43 Cal.4th 652, 684.) The information in the wilas concerning other Norteños\nwith whom defendants had been incarcerated was also probative; it demonstrated that the\nvarious cliques — including Varrio West Side Turlock — were not simply neighborhood\ngroups, but were under the larger Norteño criminal street gang umbrella. (See People v.\nWilliams (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 983, 987-988.)\n       Under the circumstances, most, if not all, of the challenged evidence was highly\nprobative of issues actually in dispute, and was not substantially outweighed by the risk\nof undue prejudice, especially in light of the limiting instructions given by the trial court.\n(See People v. Fuiava, supra, 53 Cal.4th at pp. 669-670; People v. Richardson (2008) 43\nCal.4th 959, 1004.) Accordingly, defendants have failed to establish the trial court\nabused its discretion in admitting the bulk of the wilas‟ contents. (See People v. Branch\n(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 274, 286-287.)\n       To the extent there was error (for example, in the admission of Saldana‟s\ninaccurate representation that he had a prior conviction for assault with a firearm;\n\n                                             64.\n\fGutierrez‟s apparent arrest, without charges ever being filed, for attempted murder; and\nboth defendants‟ professed willingness to assist in a removal), we have examined the\nrecord and conclude there is no reasonable probability the jury would have reached a\ndifferent result had the evidence been excluded. (People v. Whitson (1998) 17 Cal.4th\n229, 251; Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836.) Defendants claim the error rendered their\ntrial fundamentally unfair, so that we must assess prejudice under the more rigorous\nChapman standard. (See People v. Williams, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 612.) In light\nof the properly admitted evidence and the trial court‟s limiting instructions, however, we\nconclude defendants have failed to satisfy the required “high constitutional standard to\nshow that the erroneous admission of evidence resulted in an unfair trial.” (People v.\nAlbarran, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at p. 229; see People v. Richardson, supra, 43 Cal.4th\nat p. 1004; People v. Champion (1995) 9 Cal.4th 879, 925, overruled on another ground\nin People v. Combs (2004) 34 Cal.4th 821, 860.) This case simply does not present “one\nof those rare and unusual occasions where the admission of evidence has violated federal\ndue process and rendered the defendant‟s trial fundamentally unfair.” (People v.\nAlbarran, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at p. 232.)\n                                              II\n                 THE SECTION 186.22, SUBDIVISION (B) ENHANCEMENT\nA.     Sufficiency of the Evidence (Gutierrez, Saldana)\n       Defendants contend the evidence is insufficient to sustain the jury‟s true finding\non the section 186.22, subdivision (b) enhancement. We disagree.\n       To establish the gang enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b), “the\nprosecution must prove that the crime for which the defendant was convicted had been\n„committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street\ngang, [and that it was committed] with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in\nany criminal conduct by gang members.‟ [Citations.]” (Gardeley, supra, 14 Cal.4th at\n\n\n\n                                             65.\n\fpp. 616-617.)33 Defendants say the evidence fails to prove the shooting was to benefit\nthe gang or that it was done with the requisite specific intent.\n       The test of sufficiency of the evidence is whether, reviewing the whole record in\nthe light most favorable to the judgment below, substantial evidence is disclosed such\nthat a reasonable trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a\nreasonable doubt. (People v. Johnson (1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578; accord, Jackson v.\nVirginia (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319.) Substantial evidence is that evidence which is\n“reasonable, credible, and of solid value.” (People v. Johnson, supra, at p. 578.) An\nappellate court must “presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the\ntrier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.” (People v. Reilly (1970) 3 Cal.3d 421,\n425.) An appellate court must not reweigh the evidence (People v. Culver (1973) 10\nCal.3d 542, 548), reappraise the credibility of the witnesses, or resolve factual conflicts,\nas these are functions reserved for the trier of fact (In re Frederick G. (1979) 96\nCal.App.3d 353, 367.) “Where the circumstances support the trier of fact‟s finding of\nguilt, an appellate court cannot reverse merely because it believes the evidence is\nreasonably reconciled with the defendant‟s innocence. [Citations.]” (People v. Meza\n(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1741, 1747.) This standard of review is applicable to both\nconvictions and gang enhancements (People v. Leon (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 149, 161),\nand regardless of whether the prosecution relies primarily on direct or on circumstantial\nevidence (People v. Lenart (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1107, 1125).\n\n33     The prosecution must also prove “that the gang (1) is an ongoing association of\nthree or more persons with a common name or common identifying sign or symbol;\n(2) has as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more of the criminal acts\nenumerated in the statute; and (3) includes members who either individually or\ncollectively have engaged in a „pattern of criminal gang activity‟ by committing,\nattempting to commit, or soliciting, two or more of the enumerated offenses (the so-\ncalled „predicate offenses‟) during the statutorily defined period. [Citations.]”\n(Gardeley, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 617, italics omitted.) Defendants do not claim these\nelements were insufficiently established.\n\n\n\n                                             66.\n\f       “[T]he Legislature included the requirement that the crime to be enhanced be\ncommitted for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street\ngang to make it „clear that a criminal offense is subject to increased punishment … only\nif the crime is “gang related.”‟ [Citation.]” (People v. Albillar (2010) 51 Cal.4th 47, 60\n(Albillar).) “The crucial element … requires that the crime be committed (1) for the\nbenefit of, (2) at the direction of, or (3) in association with a gang.” (People v. Morales\n(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1198.)34\n       In this case, the People presented evidence defendants, who were fellow gang\nmembers, committed the crime in association with each other. (See People v. Leon,\nsupra, 161 Cal.App.4th at p. 163.) “Not every crime committed by gang members is\nrelated to a gang.” (Albillar, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 60.) “Admittedly, it is conceivable\nthat several gang members could commit a crime together, yet be on a frolic and detour\nunrelated to the gang.” (People v. Morales, supra, 112 Cal.App.4th at p. 1198.) From\nthe information contained in the wilas, together with the testimony of the gang experts,\nhowever, the jury here reasonably could have concluded the shooting was gang related,\nand that defendants “relied on their common gang membership and the apparatus of the\ngang” — particularly the assumption none of the witnesses would interfere with\ndefendants‟ actions or later talk to police — in committing the crime. (Albillar, supra, 51\nCal.4th at pp. 60, 61-62.) That defendants are brothers “does not cancel out that [joint\ngang] membership.” (People v. Martinez (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1324, 1332.)\n       We recognize that it has been said an expert‟s testimony alone is not sufficient to\nfind that an offense is gang related. (People v. Ferraez (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 925,\n931.) Nevertheless, such testimony constitutes circumstantial evidence jurors may take\n\n34     The verdicts in this case accurately stated the requirement in the disjunctive.\nNeither the jury nor we need find evidence showing the crime was committed for the\nbenefit of or at the direction of the Norteño gang, if there is substantial evidence the\ncrime was committed in association with a gang.\n\n\n\n                                             67.\n\finto consideration in determining whether the prosecution has proven the elements of the\ncriminal street gang enhancement. (People v. Hernandez (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1040, 1047-\n1048; Ferraez, supra, at p. 930.) Here, beyond the expert testimony, the record provided\n“„some evidentiary support, other than merely the defendant‟s record of prior offenses\nand past gang activities or personal affiliations .…‟” (People v. Ochoa (2009) 179\nCal.App.4th 650, 657.)35\n       The record also contains substantial evidence of the requisite intent, namely, “the\nspecific intent to promote, further, or assist criminal conduct by gang members.”\n(Albillar, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 67.) “„[T]he scienter requirement in section 186.22[,\nsubdivision] (b)(1) … applies to any criminal conduct, without a further requirement that\nthe conduct be “apart from” the criminal conduct underlying the offense of conviction\nsought to be enhanced.‟ [Citation.] „[I]f substantial evidence establishes that the\ndefendant intended to and did commit the charged felony with known members of a\ngang, the jury may fairly infer that the defendant had the specific intent to promote,\nfurther, or assist criminal conduct by those gang members.‟ [Citation.]” (People v.\nLivingston (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1145, 1171.) A specific intent to benefit the gang is not\nrequired. (People v. Leon, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at p. 163; People v. Morales, supra,\n112 Cal.App.4th at p. 1198.)\n       In the present case, jurors reasonably could have inferred, particularly from the\ninformation in the wilas and the gang experts‟ testimony, that, in fighting with and then\nshooting Villanueva, defendants had the specific intent to promote, further, or assist\n\n\n\n35     The record also contains support for the notion the homicide benefited the Norteño\ncriminal street gang. The fact there was also evidence the Norteño gang disapproved of\n“red-on-red” violence, and that Miguel Perez, a gang dropout, nevertheless socialized\nwith a number of individuals with ties to the gang, was something for jurors to assess and\ndoes not render the evidence supporting the enhancement insufficient.\n\n\n\n                                            68.\n\fcriminal conduct by each other as gang members.36 Section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)\n“applies when a defendant has personally committed a gang-related felony with the\nspecific intent to aid members of that gang.” (Albillar, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 68.) Here,\nthere was ample evidence defendants intended to attack Villanueva, assisted each other in\nbringing about his demise, and were each members of the Norteño criminal street gang.\n“Accordingly, there was substantial evidence that defendants acted with the specific\nintent to promote, further, or assist gang members in that criminal conduct.” (Ibid.; see\nEmery v. Clark (9th Cir. 2011) 643 F.3d 1210, 1216.)\n       We recognize there was evidence from which jurors could have concluded\nVillanueva was shot by accident or in self-defense, or even intentionally but for reasons\nthat were personal to defendants and unrelated to a gang. This does not mean, however,\nthe gang enhancement was unsupported by substantial evidence. It was up to jurors to\ndetermine what evidence to believe. Reversal on the ground of insufficiency of the\nevidence “is unwarranted unless it appears „that upon no hypothesis whatever is there\nsufficient substantial evidence to support‟” the jury‟s finding. (People v. Bolin (1998) 18\nCal.4th 297, 331.) Reversal is not warranted here.\n\nB.     Omission of Gang Enhancement Finding on Abstract of Judgment (Attorney\n       General)\n       The information filed for each defendant alleged an enhancement under\nsubdivision (b)(1) of section 186.22.37 The jury‟s verdicts contained the same statutory\n\n36     The nature of the evidence in this case distinguishes it from cases such as People\nv. Ramon (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 843, 846-851; In re Frank S. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th\n1192, 1195-1199; and People v. Killebrew (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 644, 647-659,\ndisapproved on another ground in People v. Vang (2011) 52 Cal.4th 1038, 1047-1048 and\nfootnote 3.\n37     Section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) states: “Except as provided in paragraphs (4)\nand (5), any person who is convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of, at the\ndirection of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to\npromote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, shall, upon\n\n\n                                            69.\n\fdesignation. At sentencing, nothing was said about the section 186.22 finding and the\nabstract of judgment for each defendant does not reflect it.\n       The Attorney General contends the abstract of judgment for each defendant should\nbe corrected to state: “„Alternately, defendant is required by PC 186.22(b)(5)[38] to serve\na minimum of 15 years on count 1 before he is eligible for parole.‟”39 Under the\ncircumstances here, we decline the invitation to so order.\n       As we have stated, nothing was said about the section 186.22, subdivsion (b)(1)\nfinding at the sentencing hearing. “Courts may correct clerical errors at any time, and\nappellate courts … that have properly assumed jurisdiction of cases have ordered\ncorrection of abstracts of judgment that did not accurately reflect the oral judgments of\nsentencing courts. [Citations.]” (People v. Mitchell (2001) 26 Cal.4th 181, 185, italics\nadded.) It does not appear from the record in this case that the omission of any reference\nto a section 186.22 finding on defendants‟ abstracts of judgment was a mere clerical error\n(See In re Candelario (1970) 3 Cal.3d 702, 705.)\n\n\n\nconviction of that felony, in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for\nthe felony or attempted felony of which he or she has been convicted, be punished as\nfollows: [¶] (A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the person shall be\npunished by an additional term of two, three, or four years at the court‟s discretion. [¶]\n(B) If the felony is a serious felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7, the\nperson shall be punished by an additional term of five years. [¶] (C) If the felony is a\nviolent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, the person shall be\npunished by an additional term of 10 years.”\n38    Section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5) states: “Except as provided in paragraph (4),\nany person who violates this subdivision in the commission of a felony punishable by\nimprisonment in the state prison for life shall not be paroled until a minimum of 15\ncalendar years have been served.”\n39     Although neither defendant responded to this argument despite the Attorney\nGeneral‟s full compliance with California Rules of Court, rule 8.204(a)(1)(B), we will\nnot assume defendants‟ silence constitutes concession.\n\n\n\n                                             70.\n\f       Additionally, the prosecutor did not raise the issue in the trial court. This being\nthe case, the People can raise it for the first time without filing their own appeal only if\nthe omission of the section 186.22 finding somehow constituted an unauthorized\nsentence. (People v. Johnwell (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1267, 1284; see People v. Scott\n(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 354.) The Attorney General makes no attempt to address this issue.\n       Last, subdivision (e)(2) of section 12022.53 provides: “An enhancement for\nparticipation in a criminal street gang pursuant to Chapter 11 (commencing with\nSection 186.20) of Title 7 of Part 1 shall not be imposed on a person in addition to an\nenhancement imposed pursuant to this subdivision, unless the person personally used or\npersonally discharged a firearm in the commission of the offense.” In People v.\nBrookfield (2009) 47 Cal.4th 583, 590-592, the California Supreme Court held that\nsubdivision (e)(2) of section 12022.53 applies to the penalty provision contained in\nsection 186.22, subdivision (b)(4). In People v. Gonzalez (2010) 180 Cal.App.4th 1420,\n1424-1427, the Court of Appeal relied on Brookfield to hold that section 12022.53,\nsubdivision (e)(2) precludes imposition of the minimum parole eligibility period\ncontained in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5). The Attorney General makes no attempt\nto explain how, under these authorities, subdivision (b)(5) of section 186.22 presently\napplies to Saldana — or, for that matter, if it even applies to Gutierrez, since, although\nthe trial evidence established Gutierrez was the only shooter, both defendants were\nsentenced, pursuant to the jury‟s findings, under both subdivision (d) and\nsubdivision (e)(1) of section 12022.53.\n                                              III\n                             SECURITY MEASURES (Saldana)\n       Saldana says he was denied a fair trial when the trial court imposed allegedly\nunsupported security measures on him while he testified. We agree with the Attorney\nGeneral that there was no abuse of discretion and, in any event, Saldana cannot show\nprejudice.\n\n                                             71.\n\fA.        Background\n          At the outset of trial, security apparently consisted of having two bailiffs in the\ncourtroom. Late in the prosecution‟s case-in-chief, the trial court was informed\nGutierrez‟s cell had been searched and a potential weapon found. The court proposed to\nimpose additional security measures “incrementally,” by allowing defendants to remain\nunshackled in the courtroom, but requiring them to be separated by a chair‟s width or\nmore and to keep their hands visible at all times while in court. It was the court‟s intent\nthat if they put their hands into their pockets for any reason, the jury would be recessed\nand defendants would be placed in shackles. After discussion, the court adopted these\nmeasures, finding them the “most-minimum thing this Court should be doing at this\npoint.”\n          Prior to Gutierrez testifying, the trial court noted its inclination to have a bailiff sit\nnear Gutierrez during that testimony. Counsel for Gutierrez objected. He conceded that,\nsince the earlier incident, a small razor had been found in the cell Gutierrez shared with\nanother inmate, but represented Gutierrez simply used it to shave around the sides of his\nhead. Counsel argued “it inherently would be viewed as prejudicial to have somebody up\nthere by him.” He further suggested that if a bailiff were placed by Gutierrez when\nGutierrez testified, the court would be obliged to do the same if Saldana took the stand.\nWhen the court agreed, counsel for Saldana stated he would be opposed. The court\nsuggested Gutierrez could be allowed to testify without a bailiff present, with the\nunderstanding he was required to keep his hands on the witness box, fully visible at all\ntimes, and if he pulled his hands down, the bailiff would “go[] up.” Counsel for\nGutierrez agreed to that procedure. Counsel for Saldana requested that the issue be\nrevisited, with respect to his client, after everyone saw how things went during\nGutierrez‟s testimony. The court agreed. With respect to Gutierrez, the court ordered\nthat there would not be a bailiff immediately next to him as long as he kept his hands on\nthe witness box, fully visible, at all times; if he moved either hand off the wood of the\n\n                                                 72.\n\fwitness box, security would be put in place; and if he was called upon by counsel to stand\nfor demonstration purposes, counsel was to notify the court before asking such questions,\nwhereupon a bailiff would come up and be in Gutierrez‟s immediate presence.\n       Gutierrez‟s testimony proceeded in accord with the court‟s order.40 The record\nshows he was allowed to stand up and demonstrate the position he was in when,\naccording to his testimony, Villanueva kicked him, and also what happened with the gun\nat that time.\n       Counsel for Saldana subsequently advised the court that he intended to call\nSaldana to testify, but he wanted him to be able to do so without having to be constantly\nconscious of keeping his hands in a certain position. Counsel did not believe that was\n“conducive to giving well-considered answers to the questions,” and argued there had to\nbe some showing Saldana himself posed some kind of threat. The court ruled that if\nSaldana wished to testify, he was to keep his hands visible at all times. If he failed to do\nso, a bailiff would be placed next to him during his testimony. The court stated it was\n“taking minimal-security precautions in light of the nature of this case and the\ninformation … received about the defendant, Gutierrez, in particular.”\n       Saldana‟s testimony proceeded in accord with the court‟s order.

Hernandez (2011) 51 Cal.4th 733, 741;\n\n\n\n40      Apparently, there were now three bailiffs in the courtroom, the third being added\nduring Gutierrez‟s testimony (and apparently also being present for Saldana‟s testimony)\nbecause of the objection to having security immediately behind Gutierrez when he\ntestified. Insofar as the record shows, one bailiff was at the back by the entryway, one\nwas standing by the rail, and one was next to where defendants were seated.\n\n\n\n                                             73.\n\faccord, People v.

The level of findings\nrequired by the trial court depends on the nature of the security measure involved.\n       “Many courtroom security procedures are routine and do not impinge on a\ndefendant‟s ability to present a defense or enjoy the presumption of innocence.\n[Citation.] However, some security practices inordinately risk prejudice to a defendant‟s\nright to a fair trial and must be justified by a higher showing of need. For example,\nvisible physical restraints like handcuffs or leg irons may erode the presumption of\ninnocence because they suggest to the jury that the defendant is a dangerous person who\nmust be separated from the rest of the community. [Citations.] Because physical\nrestraints carry such risks, their use is considered inherently prejudicial and must be\njustified by a particularized showing of manifest need. [Citations.]” (People v.\nHernandez, supra, 51 Cal.4th at pp. 741-742; see, e.g., Deck v. Missouri (2005) 544 U.S.\n622, 629; People v. Duran, supra, 16 Cal.3d at pp. 290-291.) So too must a security\ndevice such as a stun belt, which, although not visible to the jury, may have a debilitating\npsychological effect on a testifying defendant. (People v. Mar (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1201,\n1219-1220, 1226-1227.)\n       By contrast, “[u]nless armed guards are present in an unreasonable number,” their\npresence in the courtroom need not be justified by the trial court. (People v. Ainsworth\n(1988) 45 Cal.3d 984, 1003.) Even stationing a bailiff near the witness stand while a\ndefendant testifies is not inherently prejudicial; “evaluat[ing] the likely effects of the\nprocedure „based on reason, principle, and common human experience‟ [citation],” no\n“„“unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.”‟\n[Citation.]” (People v. Stevens (2009) 47 Cal.4th 625, 638.) Because such a practice is\nnot inherently prejudicial, “it need not be justified by a compelling case-specific showing\nof need. [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 637.)\n       Even where a security procedure is not inherently prejudicial, a trial court must\nexercise its own discretion, rather than deferring to a generic policy or abdicating\n\n                                              74.\n\fdecisionmaking to law enforcement officers, in determining whether a particular security\nmeasure is appropriate on a case-by-case basis. (People v. Hernandez, supra, 51 Cal.4th\nat p. 742.) Similarly, although the prosecutor “may bring to the court‟s attention matters\nwhich bear on the issue,” the prosecutor “plays no necessary part” in the trial court‟s\ndetermination whether security measures should be imposed and, if so, of what nature\nand to what degree. (People v. Duran, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 293, fn. 12.)\n       An order to a testifying defendant to keep his or her hands visible at all times is\nclearly not inherently prejudicial, especially where, as here, the defendant is permitted to\ngesticulate while testifying and the only threatened consequence for disobedience is to\nhave a bailiff placed near the witness box — itself not an inherently prejudicial measure.\nThe record amply demonstrates that before making any orders, the trial court here\nundertook “a thoughtful, case-specific consideration of the need for heightened security,\n[and] of the potential prejudice that might result.” (People v. Hernandez, supra, 51\nCal.4th at p. 743.) It did not abuse its discretion in imposing what it accurately termed\n“minimal” security precautions.\n       Saldana complains, however, that the court made no findings specifically with\nrespect to him and the potential threat he posed, as opposed to making findings based on\nGutierrez‟s alleged misconduct. Recent California Supreme Court cases speak in terms\nof case-specific or case-by-case determinations, and not in terms of defendant-specific\nones. (See People v. Hernandez, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 743; People v. Stevens, supra, 47\nCal.4th at pp. 642-643.) We are not aware of any authority precluding a court from\ntaking into account one defendant‟s conduct in determining whether to impose security\nmeasures on a codefendant, especially where the codefendants are relatives and fellow\ngang members who are charged with premeditated murder, where the alleged misconduct\nby one of them involves possession of potential weapons, and where the security\nmeasures imposed are minimal and not inherently prejudicial. (See People v. Ainsworth,\n\n\n\n                                             75.\n\fsupra, 45 Cal.3d at p. 1004 [assessing reasonableness of security measures in light of\nnature of charges].)\n       Assuming the trial court erred, however, in not making particularized findings as\nto Saldana, because the measure imposed was not inherently prejudicial, any error is one\nof state law only and so is assessed under the Watson standard. (People v. Hernandez,\nsupra, 51 Cal.4th at pp. 745-746.)41 The record shows no prejudice. Although defense\ncounsel argued potential adverse effects on Saldana‟s testimony before Saldana actually\ntook the witness stand, there is no suggestion they came to fruition during the testimony.\nSaldana clearly was not deterred from testifying (and had the benefit of seeing how the\n“hands visible” order would work during Gutierrez‟s testimony), and the record contains\nno hint the order affected the quality or content of his testimony, his ability to concentrate\non the questions and give well-thought-out answers, his demeanor, or his ability to\ncommunicate with counsel or participate in his defense. (Compare People v. Ervine\n(2009) 47 Cal.4th 745, 773-774 with People v. Mar, supra, 28 Cal.4th at pp. 1224-1225;\nPeople v. Miller (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1115-1117; People v.

He says that in order to convict\nan aider and abettor of murder, the jury must find he or she had the individual specific\nintent to kill; hence, by refusing Saldana‟s requested modification of the instruction, the\ntrial court committed federal constitutional error by omitting or at least misdescribing an\nelement of the offense. The Attorney General says the jury was properly instructed. We\nagree with the Attorney General.\nA.     Background\n       During the jury instruction conference, the trial court stated its intent to give\nCALCRIM No. 400 (Aiding and Abetting: General Principles) and CALCRIM No. 401\n(Aiding and Abetting: Intended Crimes). Although there was no objection to CALCRIM\nNo. 400, counsel for Saldana objected that CALCRIM No. 401 was “inadequate” because\nit failed to say the aider and abettor had to share the intent of the perpetrator, meaning\n“the person has to have the same specific intent here, the specific intent to kill.” When\nthe court expressed its belief the instruction said what was necessary, counsel responded\nthat he did not believe it was clear enough. Counsel for Saldana requested that the\nsecond element, which read, “The defendant knew that the perpetrator intended to\ncommit the crime;” be modified to state, “The defendant knew that the perpetrator\nintended to commit the crime with the same specific intent to kill, and does, in fact, aid\nand facilitate, promote, encourage.” The court refused the proposed modification, but\nstated Saldana was nevertheless free to argue the point to the jury.\n       The trial court subsequently instructed the jury in the language of CALCRIM\nNo. 400 as follows:\n\n              “A person may be guilty of a crime in two ways:\n\n              “One, he or she may have directly committed the crime. I will call\n       that person the perpetrator.\n\n              “Two, he or she may have aided and abetted a perpetrator who\n       directly committed the crime.\n\n\n                                             77.\n\f             “A person is guilty of a crime whether he or she committed it\n       personally or aided and abetted the perpetrator.”\nThis was immediately followed by CALCRIM No. 401, to wit:\n\n              “To prove that a defendant is guilty of a crime based on aiding and\n       abetting that crime, the People must prove that:\n\n              “One, the perpetrator committed the crime;\n\n              “Two, the defendant knew that the perpetrator intended to commit\n       the crime;\n\n              “Three, before or during the commission of the crime, the defendant\n       intended to aid and abet the perpetrator in committing the crime;\n\n              “And, four, the defendant[‟]s words or conduct did, in fact, aid and\n       abet the perpetrator‟s commission of the crime.\n\n              “Someone aid[]s and abets a crime if he or she knows of the\n       perpetrator’s unlawful purpose, and he or she specifically intends to, and\n       does, in fact, aid, facility [sic], promote, encourage, or instigate the\n       perpetrator’s commission of that crime.\n\n               “If all of these requirements are proved, the defendants not need\n       [sic] to have actually been present when the crime was committed to be\n       guilty as an aider and abett[o]r.\n\n              “If you conclude that a defendant was present at the scene of the\n       crime or failed to prevent the crime, you may consider that fact to\n       determine whether the defendant was an aider and abett[o]r.\n\n               “However, the fact that a person is present at the scene of a crime or\n       failed to prevent the crime, does not by itself make him or her an aider and\n       abett[o]r.” (Italics added.)\nB.

Pearson (2013) 56 Cal.4th 393, 476, the California\nSupreme Court stated that in determining the meaning the instructional charge conveys,\n“the question is, how would a reasonable juror understand the instruction. [Citation.]”\nAs authority for this proposition, the court cited California v. Brown (1987) 479 U.S.\n538, 541. In Boyde v. California (1990) 494 U.S. 370, 379-380, however, the United\nStates Supreme Court observed that a number of its cases (including California v. Brown)\nhad used numerous different phrasings, and made it a point to settle on the “reasonable\nlikelihood” standard as the single standard of review for jury instructions. In Estelle v.\nMcGuire (1991) 502 U.S. 62, 72-73, footnote 4, the United States Supreme Court\nreaffirmed its commitment to the “reasonable likelihood” standard, and disapproved the\nstandard of review language contained in Cage v. Louisiana (1990) 498 U.S. 39, 41 (“In\nconstruing the instruction, we consider how reasonable jurors could have understood the\ncharge as a whole”) and Yates v. Evatt (1991) 500 U.S. 391, 401 (“We think a reasonable\njuror would have understood the [instruction] to mean …”).

Lopez, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 1305.) “„Instructions should\nbe interpreted, if possible, so as to support the judgment rather than defeat it if they are\nreasonably susceptible to such interpretation.‟ [Citation.]” (People v. Ramos (2008) 163\nCal.App.4th 1082, 1088.)\n       After independent review, we find no error.\n       The seminal case concerning the definition of aiding and abetting as it currently\nstands in California is People v. Beeman (1984) 35 Cal.3d 547 (Beeman). There, the\nstate high court declared:\n\n              “[W]e conclude that the weight of authority and sound law require\n       proof that an aider and abettor act with knowledge of the criminal purpose\n       of the perpetrator and with an intent or purpose either of committing, or of\n       encouraging or facilitating commission of, the offense. [Citations.]\n\n               “When the definition of the offense includes the intent to do some\n       act or achieve some consequence beyond the actus reus of the crime\n       [citation], the aider and abettor must share the specific intent of the\n       perpetrator. By „share‟ we mean neither that the aider and abettor must be\n       prepared to commit the offense by his or her own act should the perpetrator\n       fail to do so, nor that the aider and abettor must seek to share the fruits of\n       the crime. [Citation.] Rather, an aider and abettor will ‘share’ the\n       perpetrator’s specific intent when he or she knows the full extent of the\n       perpetrator’s criminal purpose and gives aid or encouragement with the\n       intent or purpose of facilitating the perpetrator’s commission of the crime.\n       [Citation.]” (Beeman, supra, 35 Cal.3d at p. 560, original italics omitted,\n       italics added.)\nThe court went on to say: “[A]n appropriate instruction should inform the jury that a\nperson aids and abets the commission of a crime when he or she, acting with\n(1) knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator; and (2) the intent or purpose of\ncommitting, encouraging, or facilitating the commission of the offense, (3) by act or\nadvice aids, promotes, encourages or instigates, the commission of the crime.” (Id. at\np. 561.)\n\n                                             80.\n\f        Beeman‟s definition of aiding and abetting, and of what it means to share the\nperpetrator‟s specific intent, remains good law to this day. (See, e.g., People v. Delgado,\nsupra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 486; People v. Houston, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 1224; People v.\nMarshall (1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 40; People v. Prettyman (1996) 14 Cal.4th 248, 259.)\nCALCRIM No. 401, as given here, adequately conveys those principles. (See People v.\nHouston, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 1224.)\n        Saldana claims, however, the instruction failed to tell jurors that, for Saldana to be\nliable for murder, he must — independently of Gutierrez — have the specific intent to\nkill.\n        Although “[a]ll persons concerned in the commission of a crime, … whether they\ndirectly commit the act constituting the offense, or aid and abet in its commission, … are\nprincipals in any crime so committed” (§ 31), “[t]he mental state necessary for conviction\nas an aider and abettor … is different from the mental state necessary for conviction as\nthe actual perpetrator. [¶] The actual perpetrator must have whatever mental state is\nrequired for each crime charged .… An aider and abettor, on the other hand, must „act\nwith knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator and with an intent or purpose\neither of committing, or of encouraging or facilitating commission of, the offense.‟\n[Citation.]” (People v. Mendoza (1998) 18 Cal.4th 1114, 1122-1123, quoting Beeman,\nsupra, 35 Cal.3d at p. 560.)\n        An aider and abettor‟s guilt for an intended crime “is based on a combination of\nthe direct perpetrator‟s acts and the aider and abettor‟s own acts and own mental state.”\n(People v. McCoy (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1111, 1117.)43 Thus, the California Supreme Court\n\n43     “[U]nder the natural and probable consequences doctrine, an aider and abettor is\nguilty not only of the intended crime, but also „for any other offense that was a “natural\nand probable consequence” of the crime aided and abetted.‟ [Citation.]” (People v.\nMcCoy, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 1117.) Only the intended crime is at issue here;\naccordingly, nothing we say takes into account natural and probable consequences.\n\n\n\n                                              81.\n\fhas “defined the required mental states and acts for aiding and abetting as: „(a) the direct\nperpetrator‟s actus reus — a crime committed by the direct perpetrator, (b) the aider and\nabettor‟s mens rea — knowledge of the direct perpetrator‟s unlawful intent and an intent\nto assist in achieving those unlawful ends, and (c) the aider and abettor‟s actus reus —\nconduct by the aider and abettor that in fact assists the achievement of the crime.‟\n[Citation.]” (People v. Thompson (2010) 49 Cal.4th 79, 116-117.) “When the offense\ncharged is a specific intent crime, the accomplice must “share the specific intent of the\nperpetrator”; this occurs when the accomplice “knows the full extent of the perpetrator‟s\ncriminal purpose and gives aid or encouragement with the intent or purpose of facilitating\nthe perpetrator‟s commission of the crime.” [Citation.]‟ [Citation.] What this means\nhere, when the charged offense and the intended offense — [murder] — are the same, …\nis that the aider and abettor must know and share the murderous intent of the actual\nperpetrator.” (People v. McCoy, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 1118, fn. omitted.) “Aider and\nabettor liability is thus vicarious only in the sense that the aider and abettor is liable for\nanother‟s actions as well as that person‟s own actions. When a person „chooses to\nbecome a part of the criminal activity of another, [he] says in essence, “your acts are my\nacts .…”‟ [Citations.] But that person‟s own acts are also [his] acts for which [he] is also\nliable. Moreover, that person‟s mental state is [his] own; [he] is liable for [his] mens rea,\nnot the other person‟s.” (Ibid.)\n       In the present case, jurors were instructed on first and second degree murder,\njustifiable homicide based on self-defense, accident, and voluntary manslaughter based\non sudden quarrel or heat of passion. They were also told to separately consider the\nevidence as it applied to each defendant, and that they must decide each charge for each\ndefendant separately. Further, they were instructed that in order to convict a defendant of\nfirst degree murder, they had to find, inter alia, intent to kill and premeditation.\n       Pursuant to CALCRIM No. 401, in order to find Saldana guilty of first degree\nmurder based on aiding and abetting that crime, jurors had to find proven beyond a\n\n                                              82.\n\freasonable doubt that Gutierrez committed first degree murder; Saldana knew Gutierrez\nintended to commit first degree murder; before or during the commission of first degree\nmurder, Saldana intended to aid and abet Gutierrez in committing first degree murder;\nand Saldana‟s words or conduct did in fact aid and abet Gutierrez‟s commission of first\ndegree murder. CALCRIM No. 401 further explained that Saldana aided and abetted first\ndegree murder if he knew of Gutierrez‟s unlawful purpose — the commission of\nintentional, premeditated murder — and he specifically intended to, and did in fact, aid,\nfacilitate, promote, encourage, or instigate Gutierrez‟s commission of such murder. (See\nPeople v. Mendoza, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 1123.)\n       In our view, the instructions as a whole clearly and unmistakably required the jury\nto make an individual determination of Saldana‟s mental state. Saldana says he might\nhave known Gutierrez had the intent to kill, but might not have had the same intent. This\nis true. However, CALCRIM No. 401 required jurors to find not only that Saldana knew\nof Gutierrez‟s intent to kill, but also that Saldana intended to aid and abet Gutierrez in\ncommitting murder. This, considered with the instructions on lesser and justifiable forms\nof homicide, manifestly required jurors to consider Saldana‟s mental state separate and\napart from Gutierrez‟s mental state.44 Significantly, CALCRIM No. 400, as given here,\ndid not tell jurors, misleadingly, that a person is equally guilty of the crime of which the\nperpetrator is guilty whether he or she committed it personally or aided and abetted the\nperpetrator. (See People v. Samaniego, supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1164-1165.)\n\n44     “Murder includes both actus reus and mens rea elements.” (People v. Concha\n(2009) 47 Cal.4th 653, 660.) The actus reus element requires that an act of either the\ndefendant or an accomplice be the proximate cause of death. The mens rea element\nrequires that the defendant personally act with malice aforethought. (Ibid.; People v.\nMcCoy, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 1118.) As a practical matter, “[i]t would be virtually\nimpossible for a person to know of another‟s intent to murder and decide to aid in\naccomplishing the crime without at least a brief period of deliberation and premeditation,\nwhich is all that is required. [Citation.]” (People v. Samaniego (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th\n1148, 1166, italics added; see People v. Lee (2003) 31 Cal.4th 613, 624.)\n\n\n\n                                             83.\n\f       We recognize CALCRIM No. 401 does not use the word “share” or explicitly state\nthat in order for an aider and abettor to be liable for murder, he must — independently of\nthe perpetrator — have the specific intent to kill.45 (See People v. Acero (1984) 161\nCal.App.3d 217, 224-226.) This does not mean there exists a reasonable likelihood the\njury was misled, however. “Implicit in the notion of someone „sharing‟ another‟s intent\nis knowledge of that intent and harboring the same purpose oneself.” (People v. Williams\n(1997) 16 Cal.4th 635, 676.) What matters is not the specific words used, but rather “that\nthe jury receive an accurate description of the required state of mind. [Citation.]”\n(People v. Stallworth (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1104-1105.) The instructions here\nconveyed that description, and the arguments of counsel reinforced the instructions.\nSince the meaning the instructions communicated to the jury was unobjectionable, “the\ninstructions cannot be deemed erroneous. [Citation.]” (People v. Benson (1990) 52\nCal.3d 754, 801; accord, People v. Dieguez (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 266, 276.)\n                                             V\n                 PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT (Gutierrez, Saldana)\n       Defendants contend they are entitled to a new trial due to prosecutorial\nmisconduct. They say the prosecutor‟s remarks undermined their due process rights to a\nfundamentally fair trial, an admonition was not sufficient to cure the prejudice, and the\ntrial court erred by refusing to grant a mistrial upon defense request. We conclude\ndefendants received the relief they requested, and the trial court‟s admonition adequately\naddressed any impropriety.\nA.     Background\n       At the conclusion of his opening summation, the prosecutor stated:\n\n\n\n45      For that matter, neither does the version of CALJIC No. 3.01 that has been in\neffect for years.\n\n\n\n                                            84.\n\f              “Everything you heard in testimony, everything I‟ve been saying in\n      this closing, the gang benefit, once again, with the clearance of Tito and\n      Ramo in jail, what does that send, what message does that send to every\n      other gang member out there who may dare to go to the aid of a\n      degenerate .… What message is sent when a blatant, brazen, violent\n      execution in broad daylight occurs, and the gang members are cleared?\n\n             “This is the fear and intimidation I talked about, the hallmarks of the\n      Norteno gang, what the Norteno gang needs in order to function the way\n      they do, carrying out their primary activities on the citizens of Stanislaus\n      County. That‟s one benefit. Second benefit, what does that do to the\n      individual status of the two assailants?\n\n              “You know, are Tito and Ramo fledgling gang members? Are they\n      wannabes? After committing this type of crime, justifying it the way they\n      did, they are gang superstars at this point. Other gang members are going\n      to see this. The Norteno gang, once again, is proven as a violent, predatory\n      criminal street gang. And now it is time for you all to send a message to the\n      gang. You won’t tolerate it.\n\n              “This is not just another dead gang member. It‟s not a little trophy\n      for the community. A gang member is dead. This is a human being and a\n      message that must be sent to the Nortenos through you 12. You heard the\n      evidence. You gave them their day in court, and you convicted them of the\n      righteous charge of premeditated, first-degree murder with the two\n      enhancements. Thank you very much.” (Italics added.)\n      Counsel for Gutierrez then began his summation. After the lunch recess, the\nfollowing took place outside the jury‟s presence:\n\n             “[COUNSEL FOR GUTIERREZ]: Yes, your Honor. I reflected\n      over lunch, I didn‟t want to draw any more attention to it, but … I‟d ask the\n      Court to consider, either now or ongoing, a defense motion for a mistrial\n      and/or a possible admonition to the jury about that this is really not a\n      referendum.\n\n             That‟s not [the prosecutor‟s] words, but I think what was\n      objectionable was his last comment, and I don‟t want to waive the objection\n      about they need to send a message, and I think take a stand, you know,\n      against gangsters. And I think that that‟s impermissible argument, and it‟s\n      designed to incite and inflame the jury and have them forget their purpose\n      and role in these proceedings. [¶] … [¶]\n\n\n\n\n                                           85.\n\f               “[COUNSEL FOR SALDANA]: I thought the same thing. The\n       verdicts should be based on the evidence and should not be based on some\n       kind of moral stance or some view that they have to take a stand against\n       gang members in general. I don‟t think that is their argument, so I would\n       join in that motion. [¶] … [¶]\n\n              “[PROSECUTOR]: Absolutely permissible argument, your Honor.\n       And any type of admonition against the prosecution will stamp approval on\n       the defense argument to the detriment of the prosecution.…\n\n              “[COUNSEL FOR SALDANA]: The problem with [the prosecutor]\n       is he got a little personal. You, Members of the Jury, you got to send a\n       message to your fellow citizens, and that is crossing over the line.\n\n              “THE COURT: Here‟s my position. I agree with defense. I don‟t\n       think that‟s appropriate argument, however, there was not a timely\n       objection made; therefore, the motion is denied.[46] [¶] … [¶] … I‟ve made\n       my ruling, and I will advise [the prosecutor] not to make that type of\n       argument in his rebuttal. [¶] … [¶]\n\n             “[COUNSEL FOR GUTIERREZ]: … [T]here‟s kind of an\n       admonishment that the Court is supposed to essentially yell at the\n       prosecutor. It‟s not something that has to happen right now -- [¶] … [¶]\n\n              “THE COURT: Here‟s what the book indicates, and when I say the\n       book, I‟m talking about California Criminal Law of Procedure and Practice\n       2010 edition, Section 30.27, „Counsel should be specific in objecting to\n       misconduct at any stage of the trial, especially during closing argument.\n       Conduct may be found improper by the Court on appeal, but the error may\n       be held to have been waived by the failure to object or by an ambiguous\n       objection on the ground that the effect of the misconduct could have been\n       cured by timely admonition.‟\n\n             “[COUNSEL FOR GUTIERREZ]: I’m asking for an admonition,\n       your Honor.\n\n             “THE COURT: You‟re asking me to bring emphasis to that\n       statement now?\n\n              “[COUNSEL FOR SALDANA]: Now, yes, I am. [¶] … [¶]\n\n46      The court had warned counsel at the beginning of trial that it expected objections\nto be timely made.\n\n\n\n                                            86.\n\f        “[COUNSEL FOR GUTIERREZ]: If the Court would consider it,\nthat‟s all, you know, it doesn‟t have to be right now at this point, but I do\nwant to raise the issues, and I think it‟s still timely.\n\n      “THE COURT: Well, let me ask defense counsel, if I were to give\nthem an admonition, what would you want me to say to them?\n\n       “[COUNSEL FOR GUTIERREZ]: It is improper to suggest that\nyour role in these proceedings as the trier of fact is to, quote, send a\nmessage to anybody or on any issue.\n\n       “[COUNSEL FOR SALDANA]: Yeah, and that they should base\ntheir decision on the evidence and nothing more.\n\n       “[COUNSEL FOR GUTIERREZ]: The evidence and the Court‟s\ninstructions but not for any other purpose.\n\n      “THE COURT: Can you find in the transcript that part where [the\nprosecutor] was telling them they need to send a message?\n\n       “(Whereupon, the requested portion was read back.) [¶] … [¶]\n\n        “[COUNSEL FOR GUTIERREZ]: Well, then, that‟s it, your Honor,\nthis sending a message.\n\n      “[COUNSEL FOR SALDANA]: I remember. As I recall you sent a\nmessage. The jury sent a message. That‟s what I found objectionable.\n\n        “THE COURT: Here‟s what I‟m going to do. When they come\nback in, I‟m going to tell them that [the prosecutor] made an argument that\nthe Court considers improper and that part of the argument was that the jury\nis to send a message, and that their job is not to send messages. Their job is\ndecide what the facts are and to follow the law and come to a just and final\nconclusion.\n\n       “[COUNSEL FOR GUTIERREZ]: That’s fine.\n\n      “[COUNSEL FOR SALDANA]: Sounds very good to me.\n[¶] … [¶]\n\n       “THE COURT: All right. All the ladies and gentlemen of the jury\nare back.\n\n       “Ladies and Gentlemen, there‟s a matter I want to address the jury\nabout. [The prosecutor] made some comments during this final argument\n\n\n                                      87.\n\f       this morning that the Court considers to have been improper. When he\n       asked you to send a message to the community, or words to that effect, and\n       any similar type of argument, that was an improper argument, and I‟m\n       admonishing you to disregard it. It‟s not your job to send a message to\n       anybody. It‟s your job to decide what the facts are, apply the facts of [sic]\n       the law and reach a fair and just verdict. Okay?” (Italics added.)\nB.     Analysis\n       “Prosecutorial misconduct may constitute an appropriate basis for a mistrial\nmotion. [Citation.]” (People v. Rodrigues, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 1154.) “A mistrial\nshould be granted if the court is apprised of prejudice that it judges incurable by\nadmonition or instruction. [Citation.] Whether a particular incident is incurably\nprejudicial is by its nature a speculative matter, and the trial court is vested with\nconsiderable discretion in ruling on mistrial motions. [Citation.]” (People v. Haskett\n(1982) 30 Cal.3d 841, 854; accord, People v. Bolden (2002) 29 Cal.4th 515, 555.)\n       Settled standards govern review of misconduct claims. “„A prosecutor‟s conduct\nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution when it infects the trial\nwith such unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process. Conduct by a\nprosecutor that does not render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair is prosecutorial\nmisconduct under state law only if it involves the use of deceptive or reprehensible\nmethods to attempt to persuade either the trial court or the jury.‟ [Citation.]” (People v.\nGonzales and Soliz (2011) 52 Cal.4th 254, 305.) “To preserve a claim of prosecutorial\nmisconduct for appeal, a defendant must make a timely and specific objection and ask the\ntrial court to admonish the jury to disregard the improper argument. [Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       “Prosecutors have wide latitude to discuss and draw inferences from the evidence\nat trial. [Citation.]” (People v. Dennis (1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 522.) “When a claim of\nmisconduct is based on the prosecutor‟s comments before the jury, … „“the question is\nwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied any of the\ncomplained-of remarks in an objectionable fashion.”‟ [Citations.]” (People v. Gonzales\nand Soliz, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 305.) In making this determination, “we must view the\n\n\n                                              88.\n\fstatements in the context of the argument as a whole. [Citation.]” (People v. Dennis,\nsupra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 522.) A showing the prosecutor acted in bad faith is not required.\n(People v. Hill (1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 822-823.)\n       It is improper for a prosecutor to appeal to the passions or prejudice of the jury at\nthe guilt phase of a criminal trial. (People v. Cornwell (2005) 37 Cal.4th 50, 92,\ndisapproved on another ground in People v. Doolin, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 421, fn. 22;\nPeople v. Pensinger (1991) 52 Cal.3d 1210, 1250; People v. Fields (1983) 35 Cal.3d 329,\n362.) “[T]emperate speech[es] concerning the function of the jury and of the rule of law”\nhave been found to be proper (People v. Cornwell, supra, 37 Cal.4th at pp. 92-93), as\nhave “references to the idea of restoring law and order to the community” where such\ncomments “were an appeal for the jury to take its duty seriously, rather than efforts to\nincite the jury” against the accused (People v. Adanandus (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 496,\n511-512, 513).47 On the other hand, misconduct has been found where the prosecutor\nasked jurors to base their verdict on considerations outside the merits of the case, such as\npublic opinion and the reactions of those closest to them. (People v. Morales (1992) 5\nCal.App.4th 917, 928.)\n       We need not decide whether the prosecutor‟s “send a message” remarks crossed\nthe line into impropriety: The trial court told jurors the argument was improper and\nexplicitly “admonished the jury to disregard the comments; it is assumed the jury\nfollowed the admonishment and that prejudice was therefore avoided. [Citation.]”\n(People v. Mendoza (2007) 42 Cal.4th 686, 701.) “A jury will generally be presumed to\n\n\n47     Isolated references to retribution or community vengeance, or arguing the jury\nshould send a message or make a statement by returning a verdict of death, have been\nheld not to constitute misconduct when made in the penalty phase of trial, so long as such\narguments do not form the principal basis for advocating imposition of the death penalty.\n(See, e.g., People v. Brady (2010) 50 Cal.4th 547, 586; People v. Martinez (2010) 47\nCal.4th 911, 965-966; People v. Wash, supra, 6 Cal.4th at pp. 261-262.)\n\n\n\n                                             89.\n\fhave followed an admonition to disregard improper evidence or comments, as „[i]t is only\nin the exceptional case that “the improper subject matter is of such a character that its\neffect … cannot be removed by the court‟s admonitions.” [Citation.]‟ [Citation.]”\n(People v. Pitts (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 606, 692.)\n       Defendants fail to persuade us this is such an exceptional case. Contrary to\ndefendants‟ assertion that they did not receive the relief they requested because they\nasked for a mistrial and the trial court refused to grant one, the record shows they\nrequested a mistrial and/or an admonition, and they agreed to the trial court‟s admonition\nas an alternative to their untimely mistrial request. (See People v. Thompson, supra, 49\nCal.4th at p. 130.) They expressly agreed to the trial court‟s proposed admonition —\nwhich it ultimately gave — and did not claim it was inadequate or seek any additional\ncharge to the jury. (See People v. Chatman (2006) 38 Cal.4th 344, 385.)\n       Presuming, as we do, that the jury understood and obeyed the trial court‟s\ninstruction to disregard the prosecutor‟s “send a message” remarks, we conclude the trial\ncourt did not err. Any prejudice was cured by its admonition. (See People v. Tully\n(2012) 54 Cal.4th 952, 1020.) The prosecutor‟s “isolated, brief remark, when viewed in\nthe context of the entire argument, … could not have inflamed the jury‟s passions to the\npoint where the outcome of the trial was affected or the trial became fundamentally\nunfair.” (People v. Rundle (2008) 43 Cal.4th 76, 162, disapproved on another ground in\nPeople v. Doolin, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 421, fn. 22.) This is simply not a case in which\n“improper comments and assertions [were] interspersed throughout trial and/or closing\nargument” (People v. Pitts, supra, 223 Cal.App.3d at p. 692), or where “the sheer number\nof instances of prosecutorial misconduct and other legal errors raises the strong\npossibility the aggregate prejudicial effect of such errors was greater than the sum of the\nprejudice of each error standing alone” (People v. Hill, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 845).\n\n\n\n\n                                             90.\n\f                                            VI\n                                   SENTENCING ISSUES\nA.     Constitutionality of Section 12022.53, Subdivision (e) (Saldana)\n       No evidence was presented at trial that Saldana shot Villanueva. Nevertheless, his\nsentence was enhanced by a term of 25 years to life in prison pursuant to section\n12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1).48 Saldana now contends subdivision (e)(1) of\nsection 12022.53 violates his right to equal protection of the laws by treating aiders and\nabettors of shootings committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang differently from\naiders and abettors of shootings committed in concert by criminal organizations or groups\nnot defined as street gangs. We reject his claim.49\n       “The constitutional guaranty of equal protection of the laws has been judicially\ndefined to mean that no person or class of persons shall be denied the same protection of\nthe laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in like circumstances in their\nlives, liberty and property and in their pursuit of happiness. [Citations.] The concept\nrecognizes that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the\nlaw receive like treatment, but it does not, however, require absolute equality.\n\n\n48     Section 12022.53 provides, in pertinent part: “(d) Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of law, any person who, in the commission of a [specified felony including\nmurder], personally and intentionally discharges a firearm and proximately causes …\ndeath, to any person other than an accomplice, shall be punished by an additional and\nconsecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years to life. [¶] (e)(1) The\nenhancements provided in this section shall apply to any person who is a principal in the\ncommission of an offense if both of the following are pled and proved: [¶] (A) The\nperson violated subdivision (b) of Section 186.22. [¶] (B) Any principal in the offense\ncommitted any act specified in subdivision … (d).”\n49      This type of challenge to the constitutionality of a statute may be raised for the\nfirst time on appeal. (People v. Letner and Tobin (2010) 50 Cal.4th 99, 200; see also\nPeople v. Lord (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1722, fn. 2.) Accordingly, we reject the\nAttorney General‟s argument the claim was forfeited by Saldana‟s failure to object in the\ntrial court.\n\n\n\n                                            91.\n\f[Citations.] Accordingly, a state may provide for differences as long as the result does\nnot amount to invidious discrimination. [Citations.]” (People v. Romo (1975) 14 Cal.3d\n189, 196.)\n       “„“The first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause is\na showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly\nsituated groups in an unequal manner.” [Citations.]‟ [Citation.]” (People v. Miranda\n(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1427.) “If persons are not similarly situated for purposes\nof the law, an equal protection claim fails at the threshold.” (People v. Buffington (1999)\n74 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1155.)\n       In People v. Gonzales (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1 (Gonzales), the Court of Appeal\nrejected an argument that appears to be very close to Saldana‟s claim.50 The court\nreasoned: “Unlike other aiders and abettors who have encouraged the commission of a\ntarget offense resulting in a murder, defendants committed their crime with the purpose\nof promoting and furthering their street gang in its criminal conduct.… [¶] Defendants\nwere not similarly situated with other aiders and abettors, and on that basis, their equal\nprotection argument fails.” (Id. at p. 13.)\n\n50     In Gonzales, a fistfight among members of rival gangs resulted in the victim being\nshot and killed. The three defendants all were tried and convicted of first degree murder\ncommitted for the benefit of a criminal street gang, and the sentence of each was\nenhanced by a term of 25 years to life pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivisions (d)\nand (e). (Gonzales, supra, 87 Cal.App.4th at p. 7.) One of the defendants, Steven,\nchallenged imposition of the enhancement. As initially stated by the Court of Appeal,\nSteven argued the statute violated his right to equal protection “because it treats aiders\nand abettors of gang crimes differently from other aiders and abettors .…” (Id. at p. 12.)\nA short time later, however, the appellate court stated: “Steven argues that an aider and\nabettor of a gang member is similarly situated to aiders and abettors of firearm users who\nare not members of a criminal street gang.” (Id. at p. 13.) We assume the first\nformulation of Steven‟s argument is more accurate than the second one, since\nsection 12022.53, subdivision (e) refers to section 186.22, subdivision (b) — the gang\nenhancement — and section 186.22, subdivision (b) does not require gang membership.\n(People v. Bragg (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1402.)\n\n\n\n                                              92.\n\f       Were we to find no disparate treatment of similarly situated groups, Saldana‟s\nclaim would fail under Gonzales. Were we to conclude he made the requisite threshold\nshowing, however, a second level of analysis would be required: “„If the law in question\nimpinges on the exercise of a fundamental right, it is subject to strict scrutiny and will be\nupheld only if it is necessary to further a compelling state interest. All other legislation\nsatisfies the requirements of equal protection if it bears a rational relationship to a\nlegitimate state purpose. [Citation.]‟” (Gonzales, supra, 87 Cal.App.4th at pp. 12-13.)\nSaldana asserts strict scrutiny must be applied, because the statute abridges his\nfundamental liberty interest.\n       In People v. Hernandez (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 474 (Hernandez), the Court of\nAppeal examined Gonzales, then considered and rejected the argument Saldana now\nmakes. “Where as here the question is not whether to deprive Hernandez of his liberty\nbut for how long, we believe rational basis review, not strict scrutiny, is the appropriate\ntest to resolve an equal protection challenge.” (Hernandez, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at\np. 483.) The court concluded the enhancement provided by section 12022.53,\nsubdivision (e)(1) satisfied the rational basis test: “Clearly the Legislature had a rational\nbasis for imposing a 25-years-to-life enhancement on one who aids and abets a gang-\nrelated murder in which the perpetrator uses a gun, regardless of the relationship between\nthe aider and abettor and the perpetrator. As we previously observed, the purpose of this\nenhancement is to reduce through punishment and deterrence „the serious threats posed to\nthe citizens of California by gang members using firearms.‟ One way to accomplish this\npurpose is to punish equally with the perpetrator a person who, acting with knowledge of\nthe perpetrator‟s criminal purpose, promotes, encourages or assists the perpetrator to\ncommit the murder.” (Hernandez, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p. 483, fn. omitted.)51\n\n51      “The legislative intent behind section 12022.53 is clear: „The Legislature finds\nand declares that substantially longer prison sentences must be imposed on felons who\nuse firearms in the commission of their crimes, in order to protect our citizens and to\n\n\n                                              93.\n\f      Relying on People v. Olivas (1976) 17 Cal.3d 236 (Olivas), Saldana argues we\nshould not adopt the rational basis test endorsed by Hernandez. We are not persuaded.\nIn People v. Wilkinson (2004) 33 Cal.4th 821, 837-838 (Wilkinson), the California\nSupreme Court stated:\n\n              “The language in Olivas could be interpreted to require application\n      of the strict scrutiny standard whenever one challenges upon equal\n      protection grounds a penal statute or statutes that authorize different\n      sentences for comparable crimes, because such statutes always implicate\n      the right to „personal liberty‟ of the affected individuals. Nevertheless,\n      Olivas properly has not been read so broadly. As the court observed in\n      People v. Davis (1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 250: „It appears … that the Olivas\n      court did not want to increase substantially the degree of judicial\n      supervision of the Legislature‟s criminal justice policies. Such a highly\n      intrusive judicial reexamination of legislative classifications is not merited\n      by a close reading of Olivas. There is language in the Olivas opinion that\n      emphasizes the narrowness of the holding.… This language requires only\n      that the boundaries between the adult and juvenile criminal justice systems\n      be rigorously maintained. We do not read Olivas as requiring the courts to\n      subject all criminal classifications to strict scrutiny requiring the showing of\n      a compelling state interest therefor.‟ [Citation.] Other courts similarly\n      have concluded that a broad reading of Olivas, as advocated by defendant\n      here, would „intrude[] too heavily on the police power and the Legislature‟s\n      prerogative to set criminal justice policy.‟ [Citations.]\n\n              “We find the rational basis test applicable here. Defendant contends\n      that the statutory scheme regarding battery on a custodial officer violates\n      equal protection principles because it allows the „lesser‟ offense of battery\n      without injury to be punished more severely than the „greater‟ offense of\n      battery with injury. A defendant, however, ‘does not have a fundamental\n      interest in a specific term of imprisonment or in the designation a particular\n      crime receives.‟ [Citations.] Defendant makes no claim that the\n      classification here at issue involves a suspect class, nor does her claim\n\ndeter violent crime.‟ [Citation.]” (People v.

Garcia, supra, at p. 1172.)\n\n\n\n                                            94.\n\f       implicate any interest akin to that at issue in Olivas, in which an individual\n       faced a longer period of confinement if treated as a juvenile rather than as\n       an adult. Application of the strict scrutiny standard in this context would be\n       incompatible with the broad discretion the Legislature traditionally has\n       been understood to exercise in defining crimes and specifying punishment.”\n       (Italics added.)\n       Under Wilkinson, the rational basis test is applicable to Saldana‟s claim.\nApplication of this test results in the conclusion section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(1) does\nnot violate equal protection principles.\nB.     Imposition of Maximum Restitution Fine (Gutierrez, Saldana)\n       Defendants contend the trial court erred by imposing the maximum restitution fine\nover their objections, without first holding a hearing on their ability to pay.52 The\nAttorney General says defendants forfeited their claim by failing to make a timely and\nspecific objection in the trial court; moreover, the trial court implicitly found an ability to\npay. We find no error.\n       1.     Background\n       Defendants‟ probation officer‟s reports recommended, in pertinent part, that each\ndefendant be ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $8,200 ($7,500 for losses already\n\n52      This issue is briefed by Gutierrez, with Saldana joining. In his opening brief,\nGutierrez (and, by virtue of the joinder, Saldana) challenges only imposition of the\nrestitution fine. In his reply brief, Gutierrez expands his claim of error to include the\nvictim restitution order. Victim restitution is covered by subdivision (f) et seq. of\nsection 1202.4, different provisions of the statute than govern a restitution fine. The\nstatute treats victim restitution differently from a restitution fine; for example, expressly\naffording a defendant the right to a hearing to dispute determination of the amount of\nrestitution (id., subd. (f)(1)) and permitting enforcement of a restitution order as if it were\na civil judgment (id., subd. (i)).\n        In light of the significant statutory differences between victim restitution and\nrestitution fines, we find it appropriate to apply the general principle that points raised for\nthe first time in a reply brief will not be considered unless good reason is shown for\nfailure to present them earlier. (People v. Smithey (1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 1017, fn. 26.)\nNo reason has been shown here, and to address the propriety of the victim restitution\namount would, under the circumstances, be unfair to the Attorney General.\n\n\n\n                                              95.\n\fsubmitted plus $700 for bills yet to be submitted), a probation report fee in the amount of\n$900, and a restitution fine in an unspecified amount. This took place at sentencing:\n\n               “[THE COURT:] Both defendants are to pay -- [¶] Before I get\n       there, do either defense counsel have any comments about the restitution\n       request?\n\n               “[COUNSEL FOR SALDANA]: My client is not prepared to agree\n       to that, your Honor.\n\n              “[COUNSEL FOR GUTIERREZ]: Nor is mine. And my client has\n       no ability to pay whatsoever, your Honor.\n\n               “THE COURT: All right. [¶] Both defendants are to pay actual\n       restitution in the amount of $7,500 to the California Victim Compensation\n       and Government Claims Board, and full restitution for any other economic\n       losses .… [¶] … [¶] Pursuant to Penal Code §1202.4(b)(1), both\n       defendants are ordered to pay a restitution fine in the amount of $10,000.\n       The Director of Corrections may collect this restitution from the\n       defendants‟ earnings in prison. [¶] … [¶] Each defendant is also ordered to\n       pay for a probation report fee in the amount of $900 .…”\n       2.     Analysis\n       Section 1202.4 requires a trial court to order a defendant convicted of a crime to\npay both victim restitution and a restitution fine. (Id., subd. (a)(3)(A), (B).) At all times\nrelevant,53 the statute provided, in pertinent part:\n\n              “(b) In every case where a person is convicted of a crime, the court\n       shall impose a separate and additional restitution fine, unless it finds\n       compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so, and states those\n       reasons on the record.\n\n\n\n53     “It is well established that the imposition of restitution fines constitutes\npunishment, and therefore is subject to the proscriptions of the ex post facto clause and\nother constitutional provisions. [Citations.]” (People v. Souza (2012) 54 Cal.4th 90,\n143.) Although section 1202.4 has been amended numerous times over the years, the\nportions with which we are concerned were the same when defendants were sentenced as\nwhen they committed their crime.\n\n\n\n                                              96.\n\f             “(1) The restitution fine shall be set at the discretion of the court and\n       commensurate with the seriousness of the offense, but shall not be less than\n       two hundred dollars ($200), and not more than ten thousand dollars\n       ($10,000) .…\n\n              “(2) In setting a felony restitution fine, the court may determine the\n       amount of the fine as the product of two hundred dollars ($200) multiplied\n       by the number of years of imprisonment the defendant is ordered to serve,\n       multiplied by the number of felony counts of which the defendant is\n       convicted.\n\n               “(c) The court shall impose the restitution fine unless it finds\n       compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so, and states those\n       reasons on the record. A defendant‟s inability to pay shall not be\n       considered a compelling and extraordinary reason not to impose a\n       restitution fine. Inability to pay may be considered only in increasing the\n       amount of the restitution fine in excess of the two hundred-dollar ($200) …\n       minimum .…\n\n              “(d) In setting the amount of the fine … in excess of the two\n       hundred-dollar ($200) … minimum, the court shall consider any relevant\n       factors including, but not limited to, the defendant‟s inability to pay, the\n       seriousness and gravity of the offense and the circumstances of its\n       commission, any economic gain derived by the defendant as a result of the\n       crime, the extent to which any other person suffered any losses as a result\n       of the crime, and the number of victims involved in the crime. Those losses\n       may include pecuniary losses to the victim or his or her dependents as well\n       as intangible losses, such as psychological harm caused by the crime.\n       Consideration of a defendant‟s inability to pay may include his or her future\n       earning capacity. A defendant shall bear the burden of demonstrating his or\n       her inability to pay. Express findings by the court as to the factors bearing\n       on the amount of the fine shall not be required. A separate hearing for the\n       fine shall not be required.”\n       A claim the trial court failed to consider (or adequately consider) ability to pay in\nimposing a restitution fine is forfeited by failure to object at the sentencing hearing.\n(People v. Nelson (2011) 51 Cal.4th 198, 227; People v. Gamache (2010) 48 Cal.4th 347,\n409.) Gutierrez‟s objection appears to be sufficient: The most reasonable interpretation\nof “no ability to pay whatsoever” (italics added) is that he claimed inability to pay both\ndirect restitution and anything else the court might order, including a restitution fine.\n\n\n\n                                             97.\n\fSaldana, on the other hand, merely stated disagreement with the restitution request. The\nmost reasonable interpretation of Saldana‟s counsel‟s statement is that he was disputing\nthe amount of restitution requested. He did not clarify whether this was due to a\nprofessed inability to pay or because, for example, he felt the claimed amount of loss was\ninaccurate or inflated.\n       In any event, defendants‟ claim fails on the merits. They “point[] to no evidence\nin the record supporting [their] inability to pay, beyond the bare fact of [their] impending\nincarceration. Nor [do they] identify anything in the record indicating the trial court\nbreached its duty to consider [their] ability to pay; as the trial court was not obligated to\nmake express findings concerning [their] ability to pay, the absence of any findings does\nnot demonstrate it failed to consider this factor. Thus, we cannot say on this record that\nthe trial court abused its discretion.” (People v. Gamache, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 409.)\n       People v. Romero (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 440 addresses an earlier version of\nsection 1202.4, but its comments remain applicable. There, after determining the trial\ncourt was not required to make an express finding on the issue of ability to pay, the\nappellate court stated: “Nor need the record in this case contain substantial evidence\nshowing defendant‟s ability to pay the fine. Subdivision (d) of section 1202.4 also\nprovides, „A defendant shall bear the burden of demonstrating lack of his or her ability to\npay.‟ This express statutory command makes sense only if the statute is construed to\ncontain an implied rebuttable presumption, affecting the burden of proof, that a defendant\nhas the ability to pay a restitution fine. Whatever is necessarily implied in a statute is as\nmuch a part of it as that which is expressed. [Citations.] The statute thus impliedly\npresumes a defendant has the ability to pay and expressly places the burden on a\ndefendant to prove lack of ability. Where, as here, a defendant adduces no evidence of\ninability to pay, the trial court should presume ability to pay, as the trial court correctly\ndid here. Since here defendant‟s ability to pay was supplied by the implied presumption,\nthe record need not contain evidence of defendant‟s ability to pay.” (People v. Romero,\n\n                                              98.\n\fsupra, 43 Cal.App.4th at pp. 448-449; see People v. Kinsey (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1621,\n1631-1632 [$10,000 restitution fine imposed; because defendant “will have earnings,\nalbeit minimal, while in state prison he will have ability to pay”].)\n       Defendants complain there could be no such evidence in the record because the\ntrial court erroneously failed to conduct the hearing that would have allowed them the\nchance to make a showing of inability to pay. Defendants misplace the burden for\ninitiating a hearing. Nothing contained in section 1202.4 concerning imposition of\nrestitution fines requires the court to hold a hearing sua sponte. (See People v. Menius\n(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1298-1299.) If defendants had evidence they could have\npresented on the issue, it was incumbent on them to request a hearing.\n       Defendants cite three cases they say stand for the proposition that, “when the court\nimposes a fine in excess of the statutory minimum, a defendant is entitled, upon\nobjection, to a hearing concerning his ability to pay.” (Fn. omitted.) In fact, the cases do\nnot so hold and do not impose any sort of duty on a trial court to initiate a hearing merely\nupon objection, as opposed to on request therefor.54\n\n54      The cases cited by defendants are People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, People v.\nRichardson, supra, 43 Cal.4th 959, and a case out of this court, In re Enrique Z. (1994)\n30 Cal.App.4th 464. In Avila, the California Supreme Court rejected the argument that,\nbecause the defendant did not have the ability to pay, a $10,000 fine constituted an\nunauthorized sentence, and so he was not required to bring his claim of inability to pay to\nthe trial court‟s attention. (Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 729.) The high court observed\nthat, because former section 1202.4 mandated imposition of a fine regardless of the\ndefendant‟s present ability to pay, while the then-current restitution statute required a trial\ncourt to consider a defendant‟s inability to pay when imposing a fine greater than the\nstatutory minimum, it had, in other cases, remanded the matter to the trial court for\nreconsideration of the question of a restitution fine under the presently applicable statute.\n(Avila, supra, at pp. 728-729.) Richardson also involved a change in the applicable\nstatute between the time the crime was committed and the defendant was sentenced; the\nhigh court remanded the case to the trial court for reconsideration of the question of a\nrestitution fine under the then-applicable statute, which allowed consideration of ability\nto pay. (Richardson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1038.) Enrique Z. dealt with a version of\nGovernment Code section 13967 (repealed by Stats. 2003, ch. 230, § 2, eff. Aug. 11,\n\n\n                                             99.\n\f       Defendants are not entitled to a remand for a hearing on their ability to pay the\nrestitution fine.55\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgments are affirmed.\n\n                                                                  _____________________\n                                                                             DETJEN, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n _____________________\n GOMES, Acting P.J.\n\n\n _____________________\n POOCHIGIAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n2003) that required imposition of a restitution fine “„of not less than two hundred dollars\n($200), subject to the defendant‟s ability to pay, and not more than ten thousand dollars\n($10,000).‟” (Enrique Z., supra, 30 Cal.App.4th at p. 468.) We concluded the trial court\nwas required to make an ability-to-pay finding only if it imposed a restitution fine\nexceeding the statutory minimum. (Id. at p. 469.)\n55      Were we to expand defendants‟ claim to encompass the victim restitution order,\nwe would reach the same result. Section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(1) gives a defendant the\nright to a hearing “to dispute the determination of the amount of restitution.” Defendants\ncite no pertinent authority placing on the court the obligation of initiating such a hearing,\non its own motion, merely because a defendant has objected. (See People v. Menius,\nsupra, 25 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1298-1299.)\n\n\n\n                                            100.\n\f",

Members of the wedding party wore red\nand white. The wedding reception was held at the Grange Hall in Hilmar. More than\n100 people attended. In keeping with the wedding party‟s color scheme, the color red\npredominated in their clothing. Entertainment at the reception included a group of\nEloisa‟s friends who called themselves Spit Flame and who rapped and sang. Villanueva\nand Rene Zarate (“Bullet G”) were among the group‟s members.3\n1      All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n2      Except as otherwise specified, references to dates in the statement of facts are to\nthe year 2008.\n       For the sake of clarity, and because sometimes last names were not given, we refer\nto several persons by their first names. No disrespect is intended.\n3       One of the group‟s founders Moses Rodriguez (“Rap Addict”), had been shot and\nkilled in the “Woods” area of Turlock about a year earlier. Eloisa was godmother to his\nson.\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f       Defendants (who are brothers) did not attend the wedding, but were present at the\nreception. They did not get along with Zarate or Villanueva. Miguel Perez, a good\nfriend of Eloisa and Villanueva, also attended the reception. Perez‟s status with the\nNorteño gang was “inactive.” He had “just kind of walked away from it” 10 to 15 years\nearlier, creating friction between him and gang members. He had had prior verbal\nconfrontations with Gutierrez because of it. He had not had any confrontations with\nSaldana. Perez also had personal issues with Gutierrez that went back a number of years\nand were not gang related.\n       At some point, defendants were yelling at Chico, Perez‟s friend, on the front lawn\nof the Grange Hall. Perez went to get Chico to take him across the street to a bar. Perez\nalso tried to put his hand out and tell them to “squash” all the problems, but Gutierrez\nlooked at him and laughed. Perez and Gutierrez then exchanged blows. Gutierrez fell\nback after Perez struck him. Meanwhile, Saldana was standing behind Perez, and there\nwere several people hitting Perez from behind. Someone — Perez thought Villanueva,\nalthough he did not see who threw the punch — knocked Saldana out. Tommy was\nyelling at Gutierrez and Perez, and Perez told Gutierrez they would see each other when\nthey saw each other.4\n       About four days after the wedding, Villanueva and Bernal moved to Arizona.\nSometime during that four days, they were driving near the Turlock Cemetery when they\nsaw Saldana, who was alone, driving the opposite direction. He stopped the car, pointed\nat Villanueva, and made a gun gesture with his hands. Villanueva told Bernal “they”\nwere looking for him, although he did not say who.\n\n\n\n\n4      Near the end of the reception, there was a fight involving Tommy, some of his\ngroomsmen, and about 50 people in the bar‟s parking lot. Defendants had already left by\nthe time this fight broke out.\n\n\n\n                                             3.\n\f       Jorge Tapia was defendants‟ second cousin. He grew up in the Angelus Street\narea of Turlock and, as of May 25, resided in the area of Angelus and Ninth Street. He\nknew of the Norteño gang, which claimed red and whose members sometimes had tattoos\nsuch as “XIV” and “X4.” Tapia sometimes socialized with persons who “claim[ed]\nNorteño,” but he denied being a gang member himself.\n       About a week before May 25, Gutierrez gave Tapia an item wrapped in cloth and\nasked him to hold it for him. Gutierrez did not say anything about a gun or tell Tapia\nwhat the item was. Although it felt heavy and hard, Tapia did not unwrap it to see what it\nwas, but put it in a shoebox in his room and left it there.5\n       Around the same time, Villanueva and Bernal returned to Villanueva‟s mother‟s\nhouse in Keyes. They planned to return to Arizona the week following May 25.\n       On May 25, Gutierrez telephoned Tapia and asked him for “that thing.” An hour\nor so later, Gutierrez came by Tapia‟s residence in his white Nissan Altima. Saldana was\nwith him. Both were wearing blue pants and black shirts. Tapia met them at the car and\ngave Gutierrez the wrapped item, then got into the back seat. Gutierrez said they were\ngoing to go check out some shoes “from Tommy.”6 Villanueva‟s name was not brought\nup, and nobody said anything about what had happened at the wedding reception. Before\nthe car pulled away, however, Saldana said maybe somebody would get in a fight.\n       Around 6:00 p.m. on May 25, Eloisa attended a barbecue at her friend Brandy‟s\nresidence, a duplex in the 200 block of Angelus Street. The barbecue was being held\nbecause it was Moses Rodriguez‟s birthday. About 20 people had met up at the cemetery\n\n\n\n5      Detective Bertram and Investigator Bunch of the district attorney‟s office\ninterviewed Tapia some two to three weeks after May 25. During the interview, Tapia\nmade it clear he knew Gutierrez had given him a gun. Tapia said it was a .40-caliber\nGlock with a red laser sight.\n6      Tommy sold knockoff Michael Jordan tennis shoes.\n\n\n\n                                              4.\n\fwhere he was buried, then gone to the house on Angelus. Villanueva was one of those at\nthe cemetery.\n       Eloisa went to the grocery store, then returned to the duplex. By the time she got\nback, more people — including defendants — had arrived. They and at least seven\npeople were standing against the fence of an abandoned house next to the duplexes.\nDefendants both were wearing black T-shirts. Gutierrez had on a hat. A chunky,\nHispanic male appeared to be in their company.\n       Villanueva and Darnell Lambert drove up and parked across the street, then\nwalked up to the group of men. Villanueva told Saldana that he wanted to “squash it” (let\nit go) and did not want any problems with “them,” but, when Villanueva extended his\nhand, Saldana refused to shake it. Eloisa saw the look on Saldana‟s face; it was angry\nand he was grinding his teeth. He stayed like that until he turned away. Villanueva —\nwho was considerably larger than Saldana — followed him to the backyard of the\nabandoned house. None of the other men went with them. As Villanueva went toward\nthe back, he took off his Oakland A‟s hat and jacket (underneath which he was wearing a\nwhite T-shirt) and hung them on the fence. He also removed a thick chain with a cross\nthat he wore all the time. Eloisa did not see where he put it.\n       Concerned, Eloisa yelled at Lambert to do something, and not to let them go to the\nback. Lambert responded that it was going to be fine, as they were just going to talk out\nwhatever it was. Eloisa then yelled for Tommy. Tommy was at his father‟s house, which\nwas on the other side of the abandoned house.7 He came out onto the front porch and\ntold Lambert to go back there.\n       Meanwhile, Gutierrez was pacing quickly back and forth by the fence. Saldana\nand Villanueva moved out of Eloisa‟s sight. While Lambert was responding to Tommy,\nGutierrez ran to the back. Eloisa lost sight of him, then, within seconds, she heard\n7      The abandoned house was between Brandy‟s duplex and Tommy‟s father‟s house.\n\n\n\n                                             5.\n\fmultiple gunshots fired in rapid succession from a single gun. As soon as the shots\nstopped, she saw defendants run down Angelus Street. She ran toward the back and\nfound Villanueva bleeding to death on the ground.\n      Eloisa did not think the shooting was gang related. She did not see anyone flash\ngang signs or any indication of gang activity. She was aware that the color red was\nassociated with Norteños. She was also aware defendants were members of Varrio West\nSide Turlock or Turlocos, a Norteño gang that claimed the color red and number 14.\nEloisa denied Tommy was a Norteño; she chose red accents for her wedding colors\nbecause Tommy‟s birthstone is red garnet.\n      At approximately 6:10 p.m. on May 25, Turlock police received a report of the\nshooting. Sergeant Morgan and Officer Ramon were the first to respond, arriving at the\nscene within a minute or two of being dispatched. At least 50 to 70 hostile people were\nin the street, yelling and pointing toward the back of an apartment complex. In the back\nwere a few people and Villanueva, who appeared to be dead.\n      Eloisa was angry and yelling that it was not right. Morgan made contact with her,\nbut Tommy tried to hush her and told her that she did not see anything. Morgan tried to\ntalk to Tommy, but Tommy said he did not see anything. Tommy said he and Eloisa had\nbeen inside his father‟s home next door.\n      Morgan had had prior dealings with Tommy and considered him a gangster. From\nworking in the area for 20 years, Morgan considered Angelus Street in this part of town\nto be the heart of Turlock‟s gang area. Morgan was also familiar with the “Woods,” a\npart of Turlock in which many of the street names ended with “wood.” He believed, but\nwas not positive, it was Sureño territory. Morgan was familiar with the Moses Rodriguez\nhomicide. No one was ever apprehended; it was deemed at the time possibly to be self-\ndefense.\n      An autopsy revealed multiple bullet wounds, including five entrance wounds, to\nVillanueva‟s body. Some were from front to back, while others were from back to front.\n\n                                            6.\n\fOne bullet, which entered the right side of the head, was found inside the brain.\nAbrasions surrounding the bullet hole indicated it was likely a close-range shot. Another\nbullet entered the left side of the neck and struck the mandible. Fragments of that bullet\nwere located in the body. Another bullet was located near the pelvic bone area. The\ngunshot wound to the head was fatal, while the wounds to the left side of the back and\nleft side of the hip could also have been fatal. It was not possible to determine in which\norder the wounds were received, or the position Villanueva was in at the time he received\nthem. Similarly, the gun‟s position when any given shot was fired could not be\ndetermined. The cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds. Toxicology reports\nrevealed small amounts of alcohol, cocaine, MDMA (Ecstasy), and methamphetamine in\nVillanueva‟s system. Cocaine and methamphetamine are stimulants that can cause some\nusers to become aggressive.\n       Thirteen spent .40-caliber shell casings were found at the scene, as were five\nexpended bullets.8 Subsequent examination showed the shell casings were all fired from\nthe same firearm, most likely a Glock pistol. Subsequent analysis of the fired projectiles\nshowed they were .40 caliber, and the rifling was consistent with the standard rifling of a\n.40-caliber Glock pistol.\n       On the night of May 29, the white Nissan involved in the shooting was found in\nSan Jose, partially burned and smelling of a gasolinelike accelerant. A singed black\nbeanie cap was found about 25 feet from the vehicle. Subsequent testing showed\nGutierrez to be the major contributor to DNA found on the hat. When Gutierrez was\nbrought to the Turlock Police Department following his arrest, he complained that his\narm was hurting and said he burned it when he was barbecuing. At the hospital,\n\n\n\n8      One of the bullets was lying on the ground, while the others were recovered from\nwalls of buildings and other nearby objects.\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\fhowever, he told the doctor the burn was from gasoline. His face also appeared to have\nbeen burned.\n         Tapia assisted the police in locating defendants in North Highlands. Gutierrez‟s\nidentification, and the Nissan‟s registration and key were found at the same location\n         On August 15, there was a fight between Manuel Nunez and Steven Ramirez, two\ninmates housed in the SHU at the Stanislaus County Public Safety Center (jail).9 As a\nresult, their cell was searched. Two large rolls of wilas were found.10 The wilas were\nturned over to Paul Teso, a gang expert in the Classification Unit. Teso had worked as a\ngang officer for more than 11 years. His expertise came from interviewing hundreds of\nsuspected and admitted gang members, as well as classes he took on gangs in general and\nStanislaus County gangs in particular.\n         Teso explained that if an inmate coming into custody claims gang membership, he\nis housed with the gang with which he claims affiliation. For inmate protection and\nsecurity, Norteño gang members are segregated from the general population and from\nmembers of other criminal street gangs.\n         There is a Norteño chain of command at the jail. The lowest level is yard security.\nThis inmate is in charge of security out in the yard, and makes sure Norteño inmates\n“program” on the yard the same way they would in prison. Next is the teacher, who is in\ncharge of education. Norteño gang members have mandatory training an hour a day.\nThe training covers a variety of topics, including writing wilas. The next level is the\ngroup leader. He is in charge of a particular cell in which a group of Norteño inmates are\nhoused. Next is tier security. He is in charge of a group of cells on a tier. Next is the\n\n9        The SHU is the jail‟s maximum security housing unit. Many Norteños are housed\nthere.\n10     A wila is microwriting — a small written note — used by prisoners (usually gang\nmembers) to communicate with each other, and with those in other custodial facilities and\nout on the streets, without jail personnel being privy to the communication.\n\n\n\n                                              8.\n\fchannel, who usually has communication to the streets. The highest person at the county\nlevel is the overall, who is in charge of all three county facilities.\n       The “14 Bonds” are rules and regulations used by the Norteños to keep everyone\nin line. Norteños take the 14 Bonds and household policies (which vary, depending upon\nthe facility) “very seriously, serious [enough] to kill for.” A Norteño who does not\nfollow the rules is “subject to discipline up to death.” Fear and intimidation are how\nNorteños keep each other in check; someone not following the rules is subject to\ndiscipline at the discretion of the person in charge. A removal occurs when an inmate is\nno longer welcome in the gang due to his rule violation(s), and so his face will be sliced\nto leave a scar. No matter where he goes within any custodial facility, a background\ncheck will be done to determine why he was removed.\n       Once an active Norteño gang member is booked into the jail, he will be placed “on\nfreeze.” This means he cannot hold any position, no information is supposed to be\nfiltered through him, he is not supposed to have access to wilas, and he cannot participate\nin education or exercises or program with the active Norteños. The rules of the gang\nrequire that the new arrival report his incarceration to the gang higher-ups by filling out a\nnew arrival questionnaire, which is given to the group leader and from there moves up the\nchain of command. This allows the gang to do a security check by channeling the\ninformation from the questionnaire to the streets and prisons, to find out if there is any\nnegative information about the new arrival. If the information shows anything for which\nthe new arrival could be removed and he was not cleared, then the new arrival will be\nassaulted or even killed. The new arrival will be on freeze until the security check is run\nand he is cleared and in good standing.\n       A Norteño dropout is supposed to be assaulted (with weapons, if available) and\neven killed on sight. A dropout is considered a degenerate who is worse than a child\nmolester. If an active member knows someone to be a dropout and has access to that\nperson, the active member is to assault the dropout. If an inmate is labeled a degenerate,\n\n                                               9.\n\fthis shows he was once a Norteño gang member and has stepped away from the\norganization. To a Norteño, a Norteño dropout is probably the worst thing someone can\nbe. If an active gang member associates with a dropout (something that does not happen\nin custody, but does occur out on the streets) and is identified by another active member\nas doing so, the person who was associating with the dropout will have to explain why he\ndid so and will usually have to “put in work” to clear himself and get back in the\norganization‟s good graces. Coming to the aid of a dropout who was fighting with an\nactive Norteño would be a very severe rule violation, because it would be considered\naiding the enemy “against your homeboys.”\n       “Red-on-red violence” refers to when a Norteño assaults another active Norteño.\nIt is not activity that is sanctioned by the gang, as Norteños are supposed to stick\ntogether. Red-on-red crime is seen as weakening the organization. Accordingly, in order\nfor a Norteño to remove another active Norteño, he has to have clearance from higher up\nthe chain of command. If he removes or assaults another active Norteño without\nclearance, he himself will be subject to removal. In Teso‟s experience, if there is red-on-\nred violence that is not cleared beforehand or sanctioned from above, the people\nresponsible will have to write a report and explain their actions. That information will\nget channeled to the prisons, and the prison shotcallers will determine if the perpetrators\nwill remain in good standing in the gang. If it is determined the removal was a bad one,\nthe perpetrators will be disciplined for their actions and possibly removed themselves.\n       Insofar as the wilas seized following the fight were concerned, Teso knew Steven\nRamirez to be tier security of the east quarters of the county jail. The east quarters\nhoused Norteños. Manuel Nunez was the overall, meaning the person in charge, or shot\ncaller, of all three county facilities.\n       Two new arrival questionnaires were among the 60-plus wilas related to this case.\nOne was written from “Tito” to “La Casa,” which refers to the stronghold or household of\nthe Norteños. It was dated June 14; defendants were both booked into the jail on June 12,\n\n                                             10.\n\fand it generally takes a day for a new arrival to complete and submit a new arrival\nquestionnaire. The wila gave information such as full name, booking number, date of\nbirth, physical description, and tattoos, all of which corresponded to the information Teso\nhad about Saldana. As of June 14, Saldana was an active Norteño; however, as with all\nnew arrivals, he was placed on freeze. Teso surmised he was cleared not long after his\narrival, because Teso found his name on an active tier roster, which is a list of all active\nNorteño gang members in custody and where they are housed. As of March 2011, when\nTeso testified, Saldana was still housed with the active Norteños, which would not have\nbeen the case if officers had received information he was in bad standing and subject to\nremoval.\n       The other wila, which was dated June 15, was also addressed to La Casa. It gave a\nname, nickname (“Ramo”), date of birth, booking number, physical description, and\ntattoos, all of which corresponded to the information Teso had about Gutierrez.\n       In the wilas, defendants both gave their town as Turlock, and their “hood” as\nVWST, meaning Varrio West Side Turlock. Neither wila stated what happened in the\nbackyard with respect to Villanueva. During his career, however, Teso had reviewed\nthousands of wilas written by Norteños, and he had never read one in which the gang\nmember confessed to the crime that put him in custody.\n       According to Teso, fear and intimidation are “hallmarks” of the Norteño criminal\nstreet gang. They keep their members in line through fear and intimidation on the streets\nand in the neighborhoods, plus citizens are reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement\nbecause of fear of retaliation from the gang. Fear and intimidation create a reputation for\nthe gang, and the gang benefits because the fear and intimidation allow gang members to\ncarry on with their criminal activity. Reputation is important for a gang, as it intimidates\nother gangs and allows the gang to establish control over a specific area, for example, for\ndrug sales, while making it less likely a rival gang will attempt to infringe on that area.\nFear and intimidation among the ranks of Norteños benefits the gang as a whole, because\n\n                                             11.\n\fall members benefit from the gang‟s reputation, even in prison. If a gang is known in the\nprison system as being weak, it will be victimized by other gangs. If a gang has a strong\nreputation, it will be easier for that gang to recruit new gang members and build the gang\nstronger in numbers.\n         Investigator Froilan Mariscal of the district attorney‟s office also testified as a\ngang expert. He had been raised in Modesto and exposed to the Norteño criminal street\ngang from childhood. He had training and experience with respect to Hispanic gangs,\nprimarily Norteños and Sureños.\n         Mariscal explained that the Norteño criminal street gang is a large organization\nwith approximately 3,000 to 4,000 documented members in Stanislaus County as of May\n2008. Depending on the neighborhood, it may break up into little subgroups or subsets of\nmore tightly knit gang members who claim a particular neighborhood as their own and\nuse a certain name for that neighborhood. For example, Deep South Side Modesto and\nOGL, South Side Modesto are both groups of Norteño gang members, and they unify\nunder the Norteño organization, the color red, and the number 14. Because they are from\ndifferent neighborhoods, however, they use different names. “Turloco” — a combination\nof “Turlock” and “loco,” Spanish for “crazy” — is a word Norteño gang members in\nTurlock adopted for themselves. Varrio West Side Turlock, which goes by the acronym\nVWST, is the primary Norteño gang in Turlock. Angelus Street is a very active location\nfor Norteño gang activity in Turlock.\n         Based on his personal involvement with hundreds of investigations of gang\ncrimes, Mariscal opined that as of May 2008, the primary activities of the Norteño\ncriminal street gang were murders, attempted murders, assaults, drug dealing, robberies,\ncar thefts, burglaries, various crimes associated with weapons violations, and various\ncrimes associated with narcotic violations. The Norteño gang had a reputation for being\nviolent within its own gang, and also in the eyes of rival gangs and communities as a\nwhole.\n\n                                               12.\n\f       According to Mariscal, gangs thrive through fear and intimidation. Those are\nhallmarks of the Norteño criminal street gang. Respect is a big issue for gang members.\nThey want to be respected, and to them, the more someone fears them, the more they are\nrespected. Instilling fear and intimidation in others equals respect to them.\n       For a known dropout physically to assault an active gang member in the presence\nof other gang members is “an ultimate sign of disrespect.” A dropout is considered\n“lower than scum” and the enemy of the gang. In Mariscal‟s experience, the only way an\nactive gang member can rebound from that is to respond “with ultimate violence” against\nthe dropout. If he does not, he will be viewed as weak. He has to prove he is still worthy\nof being in the gang and can respond with violence when confronted with violence.\nBecause the Norteño gang thrives off of the fear and intimidation coming from violent\nacts within the gang, if there are members who are not willing to participate in violent\nacts or to prove their violent tendencies, especially after being disrespected, the gang and\nits reputation fall apart. The gang will not be able to function and commit the crimes that\nallow a gang to thrive.\n       Villanueva had gang tattoos, but also had a tattoo reading “Bidnezz First.” This\nwas consistent with the contents of the Saldana wila, which stated that the author did not\nknow if the person he was accused of murdering was active or nonactive, but that on\nseveral occasions he promoted himself as a degenerate: He was known for hanging\naround with inactive individuals and, when confronted about the people with whom he\nassociated, made comments about how he was all about his money and the homies did\nnot put money in his pocket. Nothing in his investigation led Mariscal to believe\nVillanueva was a Norteño dropout. Rather, investigation showed he was an active gang\nmember at the time of the wedding and the date he was shot.\n       Mariscal had information Villanueva was in trouble with the gang at the time he\nwas killed. Although he was still an active gang member at that point, the fact he came to\nthe aid of a dropout (Perez) against active gang members two months earlier at the\n\n                                            13.\n\fwedding is something that would get a person in trouble with the gang.11 If Villanueva\nwas not considered to be in good standing with the gang, it would have been very unwise\nfor him to go to the area that has the most Norteño gang activity in Turlock. In\nMariscal‟s opinion, Villanueva may have thought he was in good standing when he went\nto Angelus Street.\n       In giving an opinion as to whether someone is a gang member, Mariscal considers\nthe totality of the circumstances based on the result of an investigation he conducts of the\nperson. He uses 12 criteria, which include whether the person has been arrested with\nother gang members in the past; whether the person associates with gang members;\nwhether the person has been identified as a gang member by a reliable source; whether\nthe person has admitted being a gang member in the past; whether the person has been\ncontacted wearing gang colors; whether the person has possessed gang paraphernalia;\nwhether the person has admitted gang membership during a classification interview;\nwhether the person has used gang symbols; whether the person frequents gang areas;\nwhether the person has gang tattoos; and whether the person‟s name has been found on a\ngang roster. A person must meet at least two of the criteria before Mariscal will call that\nperson a gang member.\n       In Mariscal‟s opinion, Gutierrez was a Norteño gang member on May 25.\nMariscal based this opinion on everything he reviewed involving Gutierrez: Gutierrez\nwas contacted, on four occasions, while associating with other Norteño gang members;\non nine occasions, he was arrested alone or with other gang members; he had gang\n\n\n11     There is a difference between not being an active gang member and being a\ndropout. Being inactive does not necessarily mean the person is not in the gang anymore,\nbut simply that the person stepped away or is not currently associating or conducting\ncriminal activity with the gang. Being a dropout means the person is no longer part of the\ngang and has decided to disassociate completely from the gang. Although Perez testified\nhe was not active, he previously told Mariscal he was a dropout.\n\n\n\n                                            14.\n\ftattoos, including “Varrio West Side Turlock”; he admitted being a Northerner on three\noccasions; he used gang hand signs and symbols; on one occasion, he was identified as a\ngang member by a reliable source; and he admitted being a gang member during a\nclassification interview at the jail.12\n       In Mariscal‟s opinion, Saldana also was a Norteño gang member on May 25.\nMariscal based this opinion on everything he reviewed concerning Saldana: Saldana\nassociated with Norteño gang members on nine occasions; he was arrested alone or with\ngang members on 12 occasions; he had gang tattoos, including “VWST”; he was\nidentified as a Norteño gang member by a reliable source; he used or possessed gang\nsymbols on three occasions; his name appeared on an active gang member roster; and he\nadmitted being a Northerner on four occasions.\n       In Mariscal‟s experience, red-on-red violence is disfavored by Norteños. A\nNorteño wanting to assault a fellow gang member must first get approval from the gang.\nIf there is red-on-red violence, the parties involved submit reports to the gang leaders.\nThe gang leaders actually conduct an investigation into the incident to determine whether\nthe person who committed the assault was in the right. Often, the gang members who\ncommit these assaults are cleared, because the investigation reveals the victim of the\nassault violated the rules of the gang first.\n       Mariscal reviewed the wilas found in the cell of Nunez and Ramirez, and was able\nto gather gang intelligence from them that formed the basis for some of his opinions. In\nparticular, he looked for an active tier roster, which was a list of active gang members\nwithin a certain area of the jail. One of the wilas was such a roster; Gutierrez was on the\nlist of active gang members within the jail.\n\n12     With respect to both defendants, Mariscal described in detail for the jury the\nreports and other information upon which he based his opinions. We discuss this\ntestimony in more detail in conjunction with defendants‟ claim it was improperly\nadmitted, post.\n\n\n\n                                                15.\n\f       From one of the wilas that was seized, Mariscal was able to form an opinion\nconcerning whether defendants were cleared following their arrival in the county jail. In\nthe wila, it was reported they were under investigation, both had submitted their full\naccounts of what occurred, and Villanueva‟s cousins had submitted reports about what\ntook place. If defendants had not been cleared of this incident, they would have been\nremoved from the gang setting and gang housing long before trial, which was almost\nthree years after the homicide. Instead, they had been active, and functioning as part of\nthe gang, the entire time. This indicated the gang investigated the incident and concluded\neither Villanueva was justifiably killed or defendants did not kill him.\n       The fact defendants were cleared was “extremely important” to Mariscal‟s opinion\nas to whether the Norteño gang benefited from the crime. When two active Norteños kill\nanother active Norteño and do not suffer penalties for it from the gang, it sends a strong\nmessage to the remainder of the gang that members will follow the gang‟s rules or be\n“dealt with up to murder.” Someone considered a degenerate will not be allowed to\nfunction within the gang. The gang thrives off of fear and intimidation, within both the\ncommunity and its own members. That is how the gang keeps its members functioning,\ncommitting crimes, and working for the benefit of the gang.\n                                             II\n                                   DEFENSE EVIDENCE\n       On May 25, Alicia Gutierrez resided in the 200 block of Angelus Street. That day,\nthere was a big party next door. Alicia could tell there were a lot of gang members\npresent, because they had head bandanas and wore red.13\n       Alicia saw two people arguing angrily on the sidewalk, in front of the empty\nbuilding, for about five minutes. Perhaps 100 people were watching, but none\nintervened. Alicia could not describe the two who were arguing because they were not\n13     Alicia, who was not a gang member, did not like gangs.\n\n\n\n                                            16.\n\fturned toward her, but one, who was wearing a white shirt and hat, was taller and\nchunkier than the other.\n       The two started shoving each other while the people around them just watched and\negged them on. The two then went into the backyard of the vacant duplex. They went by\nthemselves, with the bigger man walking first, but after a few minutes about 20 people\nwent back with them. At that point, Alicia returned to her apartment. She could hear\nthem continuing to argue, and she saw them pushing and shoving each other. They were\nalmost to the end of the backyard, close to the alley. The people who followed them back\nwere closer to the front of the duplex. They were watching, but making no effort to stop\nthe altercation.\n       The pushing went on for a couple of minutes. Alicia could see fists going up. She\ndid not see anybody with a weapon, although she did see one of them reach into his\nwaistband area. She did not know which one. The fighting went on for a couple of\nminutes, then she heard gunshots. She heard one shot, then a half-second pause, then\nanother shot, and “then they were on top of each other.” Then there was a longer pause\nand a final shot. She believed she heard at least five or six shots altogether.\n       During the course of his investigation at the scene of the shooting, Detective Tosta\nfound bullets and bullet holes in the south fence line of the property. They ranged from\n15 to 27 inches above the ground, and from 13 feet 9 inches to 18 feet 6 inches west of\nthe east fence line. There were also several bullets, bullet holes, and ricochet marks in\nthe building directly south, across the alley from the fence. They ranged from four feet to\nnine feet three inches above the ground.\n       On May 28, Detective Bertram interviewed Debbie Dunuan (Villanueva‟s mother)\nand Irma Bernal. Both concluded Tommy had some complicity in Villanueva‟s death\ndue to numerous telephone calls Tommy made to Villanueva, insisting he come to the\nbarbecue. During the neighborhood canvas that was conducted after the shooting,\nhowever, several residents reported overhearing individuals present at the party say\n\n                                             17.\n\fdefendants were the ones responsible for shooting Villanueva. Even those who suspected\nTommy was involved clearly identified defendants as being “the responsibles.”\n       Tapia‟s story about what happened evolved and changed during the course of his\ninterview with Bertram and Bunch. When Bertram and Bunch went to Tapia‟s house,\nthey discovered he had lied about where the gun had been stored. They did not discover\nanything to change Tapia‟s assertion Gutierrez had the firearm when he went to the\nlocation of the shooting, however.\n       Gunsmith Paul Mangelos testified as an expert on firearms in general and Glocks\nin particular. He explained that a .40-caliber Glock is a semiautomatic firearm, meaning\nit has a clip or magazine; and ejects a spent shell, feeds in a new cartridge, and fires a\nbullet each time the trigger is pulled. Changing one part on the gun makes it fully\nautomatic; conversion kits are available on the Internet, although converting the gun to\nfully automatic is not legal in California. With a fully automatic firearm, one trigger pull\nmay fire multiple rounds. A fully automatic Glock can fire approximately 1,200 rounds\nper minute, meaning it should fire 13 shots in less than a second. While firing, the gun\nwill be hard to control and will be moving due to recoil. Someone hearing a fully\nautomatic Glock being fired will not be able to determine how many rounds were fired.\n       Gutierrez, who was 31 years old at the time of trial, testified that he had been\nacquainted with Perez for about 25 years. The two had a hostile relationship, because\nPerez had molested Gutierrez‟s cousin when she was about seven years old. As a result,\nGutierrez and Perez had had a number of fights, most of which were won by Perez.\nThese had nothing to do with a gang.\n       Gutierrez attended Tommy‟s wedding reception. A lot of his family members\nwere there, and they all were talking and having a good time.\n       It was kind of hot inside the Grange Hall, so at some point, defendants went\noutside to get some fresh air. Perez, Villanueva, and possibly more men approached.\nPrior to this time, Villanueva and Gutierrez had had some problems. Villanueva had\n\n                                             18.\n\f“pretty much acted stupid toward[]” Gutierrez, although Gutierrez did not know why.\nAlso prior to this time, Gutierrez had been in a lot of fights, mostly because of the people\nwith whom he associated. At the time of the wedding reception, he was affiliated with a\nNorteño gang, as were Villanueva and Perez. Gutierrez was not angry at Perez about\nwhether he was in or out of a gang; that had nothing to do with anything.\n       Perez approached Gutierrez and asked to talk to him, indicating kind of toward the\nback. Gutierrez was willing to go with Perez even though he did not think they were\ngoing to talk, but Saldana said no, that they could talk right there. Perez then punched\nGutierrez in the face. Gutierrez stumbled back, then got up and started fighting with\nPerez. At some point, Gutierrez saw Saldana on the ground. Villanueva kicked Saldana\nin the face while Saldana was down. Saldana did not appear to be conscious.\n       Gutierrez and Perez continued fighting, and a large group of people surrounded\nthem. Tommy and Eloisa then came out and broke it up. Eloisa was upset and accused\nGutierrez of disrupting her wedding. Saldana had been down for two or three minutes;\nGutierrez helped him up and they both left. They were already gone by the time the fight\nstarted across the street. They had been at the reception for two to three hours when they\nleft, during which time they had had no problems with Perez and Villanueva. Gutierrez\nconsidered this “just another fight”; he was not out for revenge afterward, despite what\nhappened to Saldana.\n       Gutierrez did not see Villanueva, and was not looking for him or Perez, between\nthe date of the wedding reception and the day of the shooting. He did not even know\nVillanueva was in town. As of the day of the shooting, Gutierrez was living with his\nmother on the north side of Turlock, across town from Angelus Street. He did not own a\n.40-caliber Glock, and never left a gun with Tapia. He did leave some marijuana at\nTapia‟s house, however, because Gutierrez‟s mother would not allow it at her house. The\nmarijuana was about the size of a brick, and was wrapped with plastic wrap inside cloth.\nGutierrez took it to Tapia‟s house about a week before picking it up.\n\n                                            19.\n\f       Gutierrez had been friends with Moses Rodriguez, but he did not know about or\nattend the celebration at the cemetery. He contacted Tapia because he had a buyer for the\nmarijuana and wanted to pick up the package. The plan was for defendants to pick it up,\nthen go to Ranch Burger, a restaurant off Lander, where they would meet the buyer and\nalso get something to eat.\n       Tapia lived on Angelus Street, about three blocks from where the shooting took\nplace. On the way there, defendants did not discuss Villanueva and had no plans to\nconfront him. Defendants picked up Tapia in the white Nissan, which was registered to a\nrelative of Gutierrez‟s wife, but on which Gutierrez had taken over the payments.\nGutierrez was driving. Gutierrez remained in the car; he had telephoned Tapia earlier,\nand Tapia came out with the marijuana. Tapia did not provide Gutierrez with a gun, and\nGutierrez did not show one to Tapia. Saldana did not have any gun that Gutierrez saw.\nThere was no discussion about Villanueva.\n       Once Tapia got in the car, the plan was to go eat at Ranch Burger, which was\nabout half a mile to a mile away. As they drove down Angelus, they saw 70 to 80 people\nin the street and in front of the houses. When Tapia saw Tommy, he told Gutierrez to\nstop. He said he wanted to see if Tommy had any new Jordans. Gutierrez pulled over.\nTapia got out of the car and went toward the carport, where Tommy was located.\nDefendants also got out. Alcohol was being served, and Gutierrez accepted the offer of a\nbeer. Defendants were not angry; Gutierrez did not see Villanueva.\n       Defendants stood by the opening in the fence, watching two men play dice on the\nsidewalk. The plan was for Tapia to look at the shoes, then he and defendants would go\non and eat, and Gutierrez would get rid of the marijuana. They had been there for about\nfive to 10 minutes when Gutierrez noticed Villanueva approaching. Villanueva was\nwearing a jacket; he took it halfway off, then a light-complected Hispanic male stopped\nhim and they argued a bit. Gutierrez did not know who the man was. The man was\ntelling Villanueva just to let it go, that it was not the time or place.\n\n                                               20.\n\f       Villanueva went up to Gutierrez and said, “Let me holler at you.” Villanueva did\nnot exchange words with Saldana or offer to shake hands. Gutierrez did not believe it\nwas going to be a friendly talk, but he said, “All right.” Villanueva then walked through\nthe gate and Gutierrez followed. Gutierrez thought there would probably be a fight. He\ndid not hear anyone yell at Darnell Lambert.\n       About 25 or 30 people followed them into the backyard. Villanueva handed his\nhat and jacket to someone. He then turned around and rushed Gutierrez. Villanueva\nswung at Gutierrez, so they started to fight. There were no words exchanged, either out\nfront or in the backyard. Gutierrez did not know where Saldana was at that point. No\none tried to separate the combatants.\n       Gutierrez and Villanueva fought for a minute, then Gutierrez turned away,\nalthough he did not completely turn his back on Villanueva. He was worried about what\nthe people behind him, many of whom he did not know, might be doing. Gutierrez and\nVillanueva were both breathing hard from trading punches. Gutierrez, who was\nunarmed, thought Villanueva was trying to catch his breath, but the next he knew, he\nlooked up and there was a pistol in his face. Gutierrez did not know from where\nVillanueva had produced the gun, but he feared for his life and so he grabbed it.\nVillanueva had his finger on the trigger at the time.\n       The two men wrestled for the gun, and Gutierrez fell over a shopping cart. He\nwent down on his back, and Villanueva fell on top of him. They landed hard, and the gun\ncame loose. Both men got to their feet and went for it. Gutierrez bent down, and as he\nwas picking it up, Villanueva kicked him in the face. Gutierrez‟s finger was on the\ntrigger when he got kicked, and he unintentionally fired. He did not mean to shoot\nVillanueva. Gutierrez only pulled the trigger one time, but bullets came out “kind of like\na machine gun.” There was no pause between any of the shots. Gutierrez could not\ncontrol the gun, which was going off as it was being raised. Villanueva turned and fell.\n\n\n\n                                            21.\n\fGutierrez could not tell if he was shot. Neither Gutierrez nor anyone he saw put the gun\nto Villanueva‟s head and pulled the trigger.\n       Gutierrez‟s ears started ringing when the gun went off, and he was “kind of\nblacked out” and had blurred vision from the kick. Everyone was screaming, and he\ndropped the gun and ran. He went to his car, and Saldana also got in.14 Gutierrez did not\nknow where Tapia was. Gutierrez dropped Saldana off by a church and left. He never\nmade it to Ranch Burger or to deliver the marijuana.\n       Gutierrez was afraid for his wife and children. He feared both retaliation and the\npolice. He left Turlock and ended up in San Jose. He burned the car not to destroy\nevidence, but because the registered owner could not make the payments. He himself\nwas burned while doing this.\n       Gutierrez was arrested in Sacramento. Once he was in custody in Stanislaus\nCounty, he learned that as someone affiliated with the Norteño gang who came into\ncustody for allegedly hurting another Norteño, he was supposed to answer a number of\nquestions. Saldana actually wrote the wila bearing Gutierrez‟s name, but Gutierrez\nprovided the information on it. Answering the questions was mandatory.\n       Gutierrez was not aware of any difference between being affiliated with a gang\nand being a gang member. On March 22, he considered himself a Norteño gang member.\nRespect was important to him as a gang member, including with regard to the way his\ngang member peers viewed him.\n       Gutierrez explained that to a gang member, a degenerate is someone who is no\nlonger associating with the gang. It is not a bad thing. A degenerate can “hang out” with\nan active member. Gutierrez was not sure what happens when a degenerate disrespects\nan active gang member in public in the presence of other gang members. For the gang\nmember who is disrespected in public to do nothing but walk away may lead to\n14     Saldana had not been involved in the fight in any way.\n\n\n\n                                               22.\n\frepercussions such as discipline. However, Gutierrez would not necessarily be looked on\nas a coward or as letting the gang down if he let a degenerate punch him in front of other\ngang members and then just walked away.\n        Gutierrez denied that either the fight at the wedding reception or the shooting had\nanything to do with a gang. Perez molested Gutierrez‟s cousin when she was seven years\nold, 20 years or more ago. A known child molester cannot affiliate with Norteños, but\nonly the family was aware of the molestation. Villanueva previously threatened\nGutierrez‟s family and pulled guns on him. The information contained in the wila\nconcerning what Villanueva had done was accurate. It was not Gutierrez‟s attempt to\nclear himself for an unauthorized killing of a Norteño; he did not feel threatened in any\nway by the Norteño gang after killing another Norteño without authorization from the\ngang.\n        Saldana testified that he was 26 years old at the time of trial and had lived with\nGutierrez all his life. He did not have a good memory of what happened at the wedding\nreception, because he was knocked out. He recalled Gutierrez and Perez having words\noutside the reception hall, and Perez saying to Gutierrez, “Let‟s talk,” and motioning with\nhis head. Saldana told Gutierrez that if Perez had something to say, he could say it right\nthere. Because of past problems, Saldana assumed they were going to fight, and he did\nnot think they should be fighting right then and messing up Tommy‟s wedding. Saldana\nrecalled there being a fight between Gutierrez, Perez, and Villanueva, but did not\nremember who threw the first blow or how long he himself was unconscious. He just\nremembered walking to the car afterward and leaving.\n        In May 2008, Saldana was living on Geer, in Turlock, with his wife and son. On\nMay 25, he went to his mother‟s house and did some yard work for her. He then drove\nwith Gutierrez to Tapia‟s house. Saldana did not know anything about any marijuana\nuntil he saw the package and asked what was in it. There was no talk about the fight at\nthe wedding reception or doing anything to Villanueva. Saldana did not even know if\n\n                                             23.\n\fVillanueva was in Turlock that day and knew nothing about any barbecue or anything\ngoing on at the cemetery. He did not conspire with Tommy or anyone else to try to get\nVillanueva to be at the barbecue. Saldana was not armed and did not see a gun possessed\nby anyone.\n       After leaving Tapia‟s house, they were going to go eat at Ranch Burger off of\nLander. They stopped on Angelus, however, because Tapia saw Tommy and wanted to\nsee what new shoes he had. Tapia walked up to Tommy, while Saldana and Gutierrez got\nout of the car and walked over to where everyone else was, in front of the duplexes.\nSaldana did not recognize anyone there.\n       Saldana had never had a physical encounter with Villanueva other than at the\nwedding reception. As he and Gutierrez stood by the gate, Saldana heard Villanueva\narguing with a man Saldana did not know. The man told Villanueva to let it go.\nVillanueva was looking in the direction of Saldana and Gutierrez.\n       Saldana and Villanueva did not speak to each other, but Villanueva told Gutierrez,\n“Let me holler at you,” and then walked into the backyard. There were 40 or 50 people\naround, and Saldana understood it to be a challenge to fight. He did not hear Eloisa yell\nanything.\n       Gutierrez followed Villanueva into the back, as did people who had been standing\nthere. As they walked to the backyard, Villanueva took off his jacket, hat, and chain.\nEveryone formed a circle around Villanueva and Gutierrez. Villanueva handed his stuff\nto someone, then turned around and rushed Gutierrez. Villanueva threw the first punch,\nthen they started fighting. Saldana did not try to help Gutierrez, because it was one on\none. Although Gutierrez was outweighed, Saldana was not afraid for him because\nGutierrez could hold his own. No one else tried to intervene, but instead just cheered the\nfighters on. Villanueva was landing the most punches.\n       There was a pause in the fight, then Saldana saw Villanueva pull a pistol from his\nwaistband and put it in Gutierrez‟s face. Gutierrez quickly grabbed it. He and\n\n                                            24.\n\fVillanueva started wrestling for it and tripped over a shopping cart. Gutierrez fell back\nand Villanueva fell on top of him, and the gun came loose. Gutierrez and Villanueva\nscrambled to their feet, looking around, and Gutierrez went for the pistol. He was bent\nover, picking up the gun from the ground, when he got kicked in the face. Saldana saw\nGutierrez come up with the gun and heard seven or eight shots fired all together.15\nSaldana saw Villanueva get hit and kind of spin around. It appeared to Saldana that when\nthe firearm discharged, Gutierrez was defending himself.\n       The gunshots frightened Saldana, so he turned around and ran out of the backyard.\nWhen he got to the street, he saw Gutierrez running out of the backyard toward the car.\nGutierrez was holding his face. He did not have a gun.\n       Saldana denied shooting Villanueva, setting him up, or being part of a plan to lure\nhim into the backyard. He admitted being a Norteño gang member, but denied the\nshooting was gang related.\n       Saldana admitted writing in the wila that he was told by some of the “younger\nhomies” that they made up a gang called Turlocos, but some individuals from Varrio\nWest Side Turlock, including Villanueva, told them they were not allowed “to represent\nit” because the only gang in Turlock was VWST. Saldana stated in the wila that he was\ntold the whole purpose of starting Turlocos was to unite all the youngsters who were\nfighting among themselves, but the individuals he mentioned started jumping the\n“younger homies.” As a result, Saldana told the individuals from VWST that that was\n“red on red” and “not cool.” Ever since then, Villanueva and the others did not like him.\nThe wila related how Villanueva, Bullet G, and some of the others told Saldana‟s wife\nthey were going to kill Saldana and Gutierrez. It also related that Villanueva tried to start\na fight with Saldana and Gutierrez three times at a wedding. At the end of the wedding,\n\n15      Saldana was guessing at the number of shots. There was no pause, like Alicia\ntestified; “[w]hen the gunshots stopped, they stopped.”\n\n\n\n                                             25.\n\fVillanueva called some of his friends who were known dropouts and degenerates, and\nthey pulled up in a car driven by Anthony Fuentes (“Chubbs”), who “snitched” on\nSaldana for carjacking in 2004. Perez, Bullet G, and a number of others surrounded\nSaldana and Gutierrez, and Saldana was struck and knocked out by Villanueva, who then\ncontinued to kick him in the face while Saldana was unconscious.\n        Everything Saldana wrote in the wila about Villanueva was accurate, but Saldana\ndid not hate him at the time of the shooting. Saldana denied ever making a shooting\ngesture at Villanueva. He attempted to listen to everything to which the prosecution‟s\ngang experts testified. He did not know all of the “stuff” they said about the Norteño\ngang.\n                                     DISCUSSION16\n                                             I\n                                 EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\nA.      Tapia’s Trial Testimony (Gutierrez, Saldana)\n        Defendants say Tapia‟s trial testimony was coerced, and was the product of a\ncoerced police statement. As a result, they claim, its admission violated their due process\nright to a fair trial. We conclude the testimony was properly admitted.\n        1.    Background\n        Tapia‟s trial testimony is summarized in the statement of facts, ante. Before he\ntestified, Gutierrez requested an Evidence Code section 402 hearing concerning the\nvoluntariness of Tapia‟s pretrial statement and trial testimony.17\n\n16     We have reordered the contentions set forth in defendants‟ opening briefs to\nconform more closely to the chronology of events at trial. (See People v. Wash (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158185\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158185/people-v-wash/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235, fn. 4.)\n17     In addition to arguing the claim fails on the merits, the Attorney General says\nSaldana forfeited his claim because the record does not show he objected or joined in\nGutierrez‟s objections to Tapia‟s testimony. We recognize that “[a] claim of coercion is\nnot cognizable on appeal in the absence of an objection to the testimony at trial” (People\n\n\n                                            26.\n\f       At the Evidence Code section 402 hearing, Tapia was represented by Attorney\nJohn Hillenbrand. On direct examination by the prosecutor, Tapia testified that\nHillenbrand also represented him at the time of the preliminary hearing. At the\npreliminary hearing, Tapia invoked his Fifth Amendment rights. At that time, however,\nhe did not have any agreement with the prosecution. After the preliminary hearing, the\nprosecutor entered into a written agreement with Tapia, whereby Tapia would not be\nprosecuted for any of the events leading up to the murder of Villanueva, including\nproviding the firearm to Gutierrez, and anything that occurred at the Angelus Street\naddress. Tapia signed the agreement, after consultation with his attorney, because he\nbelieved it was the right thing to do.\n       Tapia testified that he recalled some of the interview he had on June 11, 2008,\nwith Bertram and Bunch. He was not shackled or handcuffed, no weapon was pointed at\nhim, and he gave the statement of his own free will. Tapia did not recall Bertram saying\nhe could leave any time he wanted and they would give him a ride back home, although\nthat was reflected in the transcript. Tapia “believe[d]” he told Bertram what he knew\nabout the events of May 25, 2008, although at the time, he had not been promised\nimmunity. To the best of his ability, he provided a truthful statement to the officers.\nAsked if he was testifying of his own free will, Tapia responded, “I‟m doing this because\nI guess I have to.”\n\n\nv.

However, “[i]n requiring an objection at trial, the forfeiture rule\nensures that the opposing party is given an opportunity to address the objection, and it\nprevents a party from engaging in gamesmanship by choosing not to object, awaiting the\noutcome, and then claiming error. [Citation.]” (People v. Kennedy, supra, 36 Cal.4th at\np. 612.) Here, the record shows that, although counsel for Gutierrez took the lead in\npresenting the issue, the trial court and prosecutor treated the objection as having been\nmade by both defendants. Under these circumstances, we find no forfeiture.\n\n\n\n                                            27.\n\f       On cross-examination, Tapia testified that in June 2008, the police left a card on\nhis door. He called them back. He was subsequently taken down to the police\ndepartment. Prior to that, he had not told his mother anything about the shooting. He\nrecalled Bertram mentioning that he knew her, but did not recall him saying several times\nduring the interview that he was going to have a talk with Tapia‟s mother.\n       Tapia did not recall Bertram or Bunch telling him that he was lying, that he was at\na crossroads, or that his future was at issue. He acknowledged, however, that the\ntranscript of the interview reflected Bunch saying, “You want to do the right thing. It‟s\nokay. It‟s very important. This day is your day. Right now. This second. You are\nstanding right now at a crossroads,” and “So it‟s very important for your future.”18 The\ntranscript also showed Bertram saying, “We talked to your mom before we came over\nhere, but I don‟t think you are being honest with us. As a matter of fact, I know you‟re\nnot. Because I know that within a half hour of the shooting you were on the phone with\nRay.” However, Tapia did not recall being told it was his future, he was at a crossroads,\nor to do the right thing.\n       Tapia first denied that talking to the officers was frightening. He did not know if\nhe was going to be charged for having some involvement in the case. The transcript\nshowed Bunch saying, “This is a crossroads for you. It seriously is. I can‟t stress that\nenough. It‟s a crossroad.” Bertram then said, “We‟re right on the cusp of arresting them.\nOkay? And a lot of people are going to get caught up in this, and a lot of people are\ngoing to go down for their involvement.” Bunch followed with, “He‟s not -- it‟s no\nthreat. It‟s a sure thing,” whereupon Bertram said, “And I really don‟t think you want to\ngo down for being involved with this at all.” Tapia acknowledged the foregoing was\n\n18      Unlike the parties at trial, we do not have the transcript before us. It appears the\ncourt reporter used quotation marks when one of the attorneys was reading directly from\nthe transcript. Where quotation marks are not used, we have no way of knowing whether\nthe words accurately represent the transcript‟s contents.\n\n\n\n                                            28.\n\fshown in the transcript, but denied that when he was told that, he understood he could be\ncharged in a possible murder case. The officers were just asking him questions about\nwhere he was “and stuff,” and he was answering them truthfully. With respect to\nwhether the officers kept telling Tapia that he was not being truthful, the officers were\nspeaking very fast and Tapia could not hear everything, which was why, he thought, they\nsaid it so many times. He did not remember the officers telling him what they wanted\nhim to say, or arguing with them that something was not as he remembered.\n       Tapia later admitted it had scared him to have the officers say he was involved in\nmurder. He did not do anything, so “of course” he did not want to be charged with\nanything to do with the murder. He did not think that he could be charged if he did not\ntalk to them, because he did not do anything.\n       Tapia invoked his constitutional right not to testify at the preliminary hearing not\nbecause he was afraid of testifying, but because he thought requiring a lawyer would be\nbetter for him. He did not understand a lot of what was going on, which was why he got\na lawyer. The fact he was now testifying did not have anything to do with any sort of\npromise the government made to him, although he did read and understand the letter from\nthe prosecutor to his lawyer.19\n       Tapia understood the letter said his statement could result in him being prosecuted\nfor crimes associated with Villanueva‟s murder. His understanding was, however, that he\ncould only be prosecuted for such crimes if he did not say the truth. Tapia acknowledged\nthe letter said, “Your client has represented that the statements [sic] he gave is true\nregarding the event and circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Roger\nVillanueva on May 25th, 2008.” Asked if he understood the truth was supposed to be the\nsame as the statement he gave to the officers in June 2008, Tapia replied that his\n\n19     The immunity agreement was contained in a letter from the prosecutor to Tapia‟s\nattorney.\n\n\n\n                                             29.\n\funderstanding was, if he testified truthfully to what he remembered, he would be granted\nimmunity. Asked if he came to court to voluntarily give a statement without any order\nthat he do so, Tapia responded, “I just listened to my lawyer, I guess.” Apart from what\nhis lawyer told him, he was not given any order or subpoena to be present. He believed,\nhowever, that he did have to testify.\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found no evidence of coercion,\neither with respect to Tapia‟s statement to Bertram and Bunch or his trial testimony.\nAccordingly, the court ruled Tapia would be allowed to testify before the jury.\n       2.     Analysis\n       In People v. Williams, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801669\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801669/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the California Supreme Court stated:\n\n               “Defendants have limited standing to challenge the trial testimony of\n       a witness on the ground that an earlier out-of-court statement made by the\n       witness was the product of police coercion.… A defendant may assert a\n       violation of his or her own right to due process of the law and a fair trial\n       based upon third party witness coercion … if the defendant can establish\n       that trial evidence was coerced or rendered unreliable by prior coercion and\n       that the admission of this evidence would deprive the defendant of a fair\n       trial. [Citations.] Although the out-of-court statement itself may be subject\n       to exclusion because coercion rendered it unreliable, it is more difficult for\n       a defendant to establish that the court should exclude the witness‟s trial\n       testimony. As [the court] explained [in People v. Badgett (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1265814\"><a href=\"/opinion/1265814/people-v-badgett/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n       <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 348], „[t]estimony of third parties that is offered at trial should not be\n       subject to exclusion unless the defendant demonstrates that improper\n       coercion has impaired the reliability of the testimony.‟ [Citation.] The\n       burden rests upon the defendant to demonstrate how the earlier coercion\n       „directly impaired the free and voluntary nature of the anticipated testimony\n       in the trial itself‟ [citation] and impaired the reliability of the trial testimony\n       [citation].” (People v.

Cases involving the admissibility of a defendant‟s own statement are\ninstructive. In that regard, the California Supreme Court stated: “The business of police\ndetectives is investigation, and they may elicit incriminating information from a suspect\nby any legal means. „[A]lthough adversarial balance, or rough equality, may be the norm\nthat dictates trial procedures, it has never been the norm that dictates the rules of\ninvestigation and the gathering of proof.‟ [Citation.] „The courts have prohibited only\nthose psychological ploys which, under all the circumstances, are so coercive that they\ntend to produce a statement that is both involuntary and unreliable.‟ [Citation.]” (People\nv. Jones (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194882\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194882/people-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 297-298.) “„“[M]ere advice or exhortation by the police\nthat it would be better for the accused to tell the truth when unaccompanied by either a\nthreat or a promise does not render a subsequent confession involuntary.” [Citation.] In\nterms of assessing inducements assertedly offered to a suspect, “„[when] the benefit\npointed out by the police … is merely that which flows naturally from a truthful and\nhonest course of conduct,‟ the subsequent statement will not be considered involuntarily\nmade. [Citation.]” [Citation.]‟” (People v. McWhorter (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2590326\"><a href=\"/opinion/2590326/people-v-mcwhorter/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357-358.)\n“„[M]ere questions, or exhortations to tell the truth or clear [one‟s] conscience or help\n[one]self by revealing facts as to the dominant part of [a codefendant] or some other\nperson in the criminal enterprise‟” are insufficient: “„[I]ntellectual persuasion is not the\nequivalent of coercion.‟ [Citation.]” (People v. Hill (1967) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1288659\"><a href=\"/opinion/1288659/people-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 548-549; see\nalso People v. Jones, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 298 [detective‟s telling defendant his\nanswers could affect the rest of defendant‟s life did not establish coercion].)\n       Defendants‟ protestations notwithstanding, the record before us fails to show\nTapia was frightened or otherwise coerced “into making a statement that was both\n\n\n\n\n                                             31.\n\finvoluntary and unreliable.” (People v. Jones, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 298.)20 That it may\nhave scared him to have the officers say they thought he had something to do with a\nmurder simply does not establish coercion.\n       More importantly, even assuming an element of coercion was present in the\ninterview, reversal is not required. Defendants have failed to demonstrate Tapia‟s trial\ntestimony was coerced or rendered unreliable by any such prior coercion, or that\nadmission of his testimony deprived them of a fair trial.\n       Almost three years had elapsed between the time of the interview (June 2008) and\nTapia‟s appearance at trial (March 2011). Such passage of time serves at least partially to\ndissipate the coercive effect of an interrogation, especially when, as here, the witness has\nreceived immunity under an agreement that is not conditioned upon the consistency of\ntrial testimony with an earlier statement, and the witness is represented by independent\ncounsel. (See People v. Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pp. 454-455.)\n       The immunity agreement required Tapia to testify “fully, fairly, and truthfully,”\nnot consistently with his statement to Bertram and Bunch. Under the agreement, whether\nTapia‟s testimony was truthful would be determined by the trial judge, not the prosecutor.\nWhether the immunity agreement remained in effect did not depend on whether\ndefendants were convicted.\n       The California Supreme Court has made it clear that “[t]here is nothing improperly\ncoercive about confronting a lesser participant in a crime with his or her predicament, and\noffering immunity from prosecution for the witness‟s criminal role in return for the\nwitness‟s promise to testify fully and fairly. [Citations.]” (People v. Boyer, supra, 38\nCal.4th at p. 445.) “A prosecutor may grant immunity from prosecution to a witness on\n\n\n20      Defendants suggested at trial, but never actually established through the transcript\nof the interview or testimony, that Bertram and Bunch told Tapia what they wanted him\nto say.\n\n\n\n                                             32.\n\fcondition that he or she testify truthfully to the facts involved. [Citation.] But if the\nimmunity agreement places the witness under a strong compulsion to testify in a\nparticular fashion, the testimony is tainted by the witness‟s self-interest, and thus\ninadmissible. [Citation.] Such a „strong compulsion‟ may be created by a condition\n„“that the witness not materially or substantially change [his or] her testimony from [his\nor] her tape-recorded statement already given to … law enforcement officers.”‟\n[Citation.] [¶] On the other hand, [the high court has] upheld the admission of testimony\nsubject to grants of immunity which simply suggested the prosecution believed the prior\nstatement to be the truth, and where the witness understood that his or her sole obligation\nwas to testify fully and fairly.” (Id. at p. 455; see also People v. Williams, supra, 49\nCal.4th at p. 455; People v. Badgett, supra, 10 Cal.4th at pp. 354-355.) This is so even\nwhen the witness is legally deemed an accomplice. (People v. Avila (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515784\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515784/people-v-avila/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594; see § 1111.)21\n       The immunity agreement here did not place Tapia under a “strong compulsion” to\ntestify in any particular fashion. Although he was aware that if he did not testify, he\ncould be charged in this case — something he did not wish to happen — this does not\namount to coercion such that his testimony should have been excluded. (See People v.\nBoyer, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 445 [no improper coercion found despite witness‟s making\nclear her primary reason for cooperating at trial was prosecution‟s offer of immunity\nfrom prosecution as accessory to murder in return for truthful testimony].) “All\nimmunized witnesses are offered some quid pro quo, usually an offer of leniency. [The\nCalifornia Supreme Court has] never held, nor has any authority been offered in support\nof the proposition, that an offer of leniency in return for cooperation with the police\n\n\n\n21   The trial court here instructed jurors that if they determined murder was\ncommitted, then Tapia was an accomplice to that crime.\n\n\n\n                                             33.\n\frenders a third party statement involuntary or eventual trial testimony coerced.” (People\nv. Badgett, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 354.)\n       Tapia clearly understood he was required to testify truthfully, not in a specific\nmanner, his professed lack of memory concerning what was said during the interview\nnotwithstanding.22 Indeed, he did not testify in conformity with his statement to\ninvestigators concerning the key subject of the gun. “Thus defendants fail in the essential\ntask of connecting the pressures brought to bear on the witness before trial with [his]\nultimate trial testimony.” (People v. Badgett, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 355.)23\nB.     Gang Expert’s Testimony (Gutierrez, Saldana)\n       Defendants claim their Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, and their federal\nand state due process rights to a fair trial, were violated by admission of the gang expert‟s\n\n\n22     The following exchanges occurred during Tapia‟s cross-examination by counsel\nfor Gutierrez: “Q. As you sit here and testify, do you understand that you could be\nprosecuted for crimes associated with the supposed murder of Roger Villanueva? [¶] A.\nIf I‟m not truthful, yes, I could be prosecuted. [¶] Q. Well, if you are not truthful today\nor whether you are not truthful in June of 2008? [¶] A. Based on being truthful of what\nI remember today. [¶] Q. What you remember today; right? [¶] A. Correct.”\n       “[Q.] Then -- then the next part [of the prosecutor‟s letter to Tapia‟s attorney], I\nwant to draw your attention is -- is that, if the above-stated conditions are not met or it is\nfound that you have testified falsely or refused to testify, then the District Attorney is not\nbound by this agreement, and you will be -- you can be prosecuted for aiding and abetting\nthe murder of Roger Villanueva, additionally prosecuted for perjury, if applicable. Did\nyou read and understand that? [¶] A. Yes. [¶] Q. All right. So you understood that if\nyou either testified falsely or if you even refused to testify, you are going to be charged in\nthe murder of Roger Villanueva; isn‟t that true? [¶] A. Correct. [¶] Q. And you don‟t\nwant to be charged that way, do you? [¶] A. I believe nobody wants to be charged.”\n23      We note that, although defendants did not succeed in having Tapia‟s trial\ntestimony excluded, they fully cross-examined the parties to the interview (and, in the\ncase of Bertram and Bunch, called them as defense witnesses and examined them further\nconcerning the interview), thereby availing themselves of “the most powerful means in\n[their] arsenal for challenging the reliability of the witness‟s statements.” (People v.\nWilliams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 455.)\n\n\n\n                                             34.\n\ftestimony concerning their prior bad acts. They say the hearsay relied on by the expert as\na basis for his opinion they were members of a criminal street gang was testimonial\nwithin the meaning of Crawford v. Washington (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Crawford) and was\noffered for the truth of the matters contained therein, yet they had no opportunity to\nconfront the declarants. They further contend the prior-bad-acts hearsay should have\nbeen excluded because it was unreliable and more prejudicial than probative. The\nAttorney General argues the testimony did not violate Crawford, and says the remaining\nchallenges to the evidence were forfeited by defendants‟ failure to object on the same\ngrounds in the trial court. We conclude any error was harmless.\n       1.     Background\n       Gutierrez moved, in limine, to preclude expert gang testimony based on police\nreports, field identification reports, jail records, and the like, on the ground such\ntestimony would violate his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation under Crawford and\nits progeny. He asserted the erroneous admission of such evidence would prejudice his\nright to a fair trial, as gang evidence has an inherent prejudice and creates a risk the jury\nwill infer defendant has a criminal disposition and is, therefore, guilty of the alleged\noffense. Saldana joined in the motion.\n       After argument, during which the prosecutor asserted the type of evidence\ndefendants were challenging was prejudicial but also extremely probative, the trial court\nobserved that even if it were to rule as a general matter that the gang expert could rely on\nhearsay information as the basis for his opinions, that hearsay had to be reliable. The\ncourt surmised that before the gang expert was allowed to testify, “it may be … that\nwe‟re going to conduct a further hearing as to the basis of his opinions, and the Court\nmay have to rule that some, none, or all of the things … upon which he bases his opinion\naren‟t reliable. [¶] … [¶] … I don‟t know that.” After additional argument, the following\ntook place:\n\n\n\n                                              35.\n\f              “THE COURT: … I think, in general, the case that I cited [People v.\n       Ramirez (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1422</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">], plus the case cited in that, the\n       Thomas case [People v. Thomas (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2245792\"><a href=\"/opinion/2245792/people-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">], at least\n       gives me, as the trial Court, the very clear impression … that Crawford\n       does not prohibit an expert from relying on certain hearsay evidence.\n\n                “It‟s still the rule that it has to be reliable hearsay evidence. And it\n       is still the rule that the expert‟s testimony must be based, at least in part, on\n       his or her own personal knowledge. [¶] … [¶] Unfortunately, this motion\n       is just painted with a very broad brush. It says they can‟t do this under\n       Crawford. Well, there are certain things that can be done under Crawford.\n       There are certain things that can‟t be, whether it is under Crawford or\n       general rulings of evidence as to the admissibility of hearsay in general, and\n       hearsay as relied upon by an expert.\n\n              “I cannot make a blanket ruling on this issue. And, unfortunately, it\n       is going to have to be handled on a piecemeal basis as each type of\n       evidence is being introduced or attempted to be introduced.\n\n              “So all I‟m saying at this point is, I‟m not going to make a ruling\n       that Crawford prohibits an expert from testifying as to certain hearsay. But\n       there are still requirements that the People have to meet before that\n       hearsay can be relied upon and testified to. [¶] … [¶] … So at this point,\n       … all I’m saying is that I’m not going to make a blanket ruling that\n       Crawford prohibits the use of hearsay. It does in certain circumstances. It\n       does not in other circumstances. So we’re just going to have to take it one\n       by one and go from there.” (Italics added.)\n       As previously described, Investigator Mariscal of the district attorney‟s office\ntestified as an expert on gangs. He explained that in preparation for his testimony in a\ntrial like this, he reads the case and then conducts an investigation into the defendants.\nHe pulls all police reports in which they have been listed or contacted, field interview\ncards from different police departments, probation records, and school records if he finds\nthem. His purpose is to conduct a thorough investigation of the individuals, their\nbackgrounds, and their gang involvement, if any. He did not automatically conclude\nsomething was a gang crime simply because gang members were involved.\n       In his written gang workup, Mariscal listed a total of 13 incidents under the\nheading, “Activity for Ray Gutierrez.” The information formed part of the basis of his\n\n\n                                             36.\n\fopinion in the case, both as to gang membership and gang benefit. The incidents and\nsources of information to which Mariscal testified, were:\n       (1) Turlock Police Department No. 99-0773: On January 30, 1999, Turlock\npolice officers responded to a hardware store in Turlock regarding a shooting. Four\nindividuals had been shot at by the passenger of a vehicle. Gutierrez was identified as the\nshooter. A search of his residence revealed a stolen .25-caliber handgun.\n       (2) Turlock Police Department No. 01-683: On January 23, 2001, a Turlock\npolice officer responded to the area of Spruce and Angelus in Turlock in response to a\nreport of a reckless driver. When the vehicle was stopped, the front passenger fled on\nfoot. Gutierrez was one of the rear passengers. A stolen .22-caliber handgun was found\nunderneath the right front passenger seat, and marijuana, a glass methamphetamine pipe,\nand a knife were found in the backseat.\n       (3) Turlock Police Department No. 01-2814: On March 31, 2001, Turlock police\nofficers responded to a bar regarding a large crowd gathering in the parking lot. Shots\nwere fired, and a security guard pointed out a black Cadillac as being responsible for the\nshooting. A witness identified Gutierrez as the passenger in the car and the person\nresponsible for shooting four times into the air. The witness said Gutierrez and the car‟s\ndriver had gotten into a fight with some other males at the bar. Another witness heard\nHispanic males claiming West Side.\n       (4) Stanislaus County Auto Theft Task Force (StanCATT) Nos. 01-6427 and 01-\n6744: On August 2, 2001, task force agents stopped a stolen vehicle at Angelus and\nSpruce. Gutierrez was the front passenger. A methamphetamine pipe with a useable\namount of methamphetamine was located on the front passenger side floorboard, where\nGutierrez was sitting.\n       (5) Turlock Police Department No. 04-3475: On April 4, 2004, a Turlock police\nofficer responded to a medical center in Turlock regarding a shooting victim. There, he\ncontacted Gutierrez, who reported he had been approached by four males, one of whom\n\n                                            37.\n\fpointed a gun at his face. Gutierrez reached up and grabbed the gun, which discharged\ninto his left hand. Gutierrez told the officer he had claimed West Side Turlock Norteño\nfor six years, but no longer claimed it.\n       (6) Turlock Police Department No. 04-9570: On September 21, 2004, Gutierrez\nwas involved in a fight in Turlock in which the victim was injured. Gutierrez fled, but\nlater turned himself in. He stated he used to be involved in gangs, but had not been for\nthe last seven years.\n       (7) StanCATT report listed under CHP No. F-19-465-08: On January 9, 2008,\ntask force officers located a stolen vehicle in an apartment complex. They observed\nGutierrez drive up. One of his passengers drove the stolen vehicle away, followed by the\ncar Gutierrez was driving. Both vehicles were stopped and the occupants arrested. While\nbeing booked into jail, Gutierrez and one of his passengers admitted being Norteños.\nAnother passenger was wearing a red belt.\n       (8) Modesto Police Department No. 07-73364: On August 3, 2007, Gutierrez was\nin a vehicle driven by a Norteño gang member.

Officers conducted a high-risk stop on the vehicle; Gutierrez was the\ndriver, and the passenger was Joseph Gonzales, also known as June Bug. No weapon\n\n                                            38.\n\fwas found in the vehicle, but Gutierrez was arrested for driving on a suspended license.\nGonzales, a documented Norteño, was arrested for a parole violation.\n         (11) Turlock Police Department No. 08-4312: On May 5, 2008, an officer was\ndispatched to a call of a suspicious vehicle. Gutierrez was found in the same white\nNissan Altima as was involved in the present case. A search of the vehicle revealed 390\npseudoephedrine pills. Gutierrez was arrested for two warrants and possession of the\npills.\n         (12) Turlock Police Department No. 08-4975: The current offense.\n         (13) Booking information from June 12, 2008: When booked into the county jail,\nGutierrez claimed South as his enemies in jail who might harm him. He also responded\nyes and said Norte when asked if he affiliated with a gang.\n         As described in the statement of facts, ante, Mariscal opined that, on the date\nVillanueva was shot, Gutierrez was a Norteño gang member. Mariscal based this opinion\non everything he reviewed involving Gutierrez.\n         Prior to Mariscal testifying specifically as to Saldana, Saldana requested, and was\ngranted, a continuing objection on confrontation clause grounds.24 The trial court\ncautioned: “I don‟t want you to be misled that that means any other objections that stated\ndon‟t need to be stated.”\n         Mariscal testified that his investigative report contained the following incidents\nand sources of information concerning Saldana:\n         (1) Turlock Police Department No. 98-9638: On November 21, 1998, when\nSaldana was approximately 14 years old, a teacher at Turlock Junior High School caught\n\n24      The reporter‟s transcript reflects counsel for Saldana asked for a “consultation\nclause” objection. When Mariscal began to testify concerning his review of Saldana‟s\nactivities, however, counsel again objected to the line of questioning as a violation of the\nconfrontation clause, and the trial court confirmed Saldana had a continuing objection —\noverruled for the reasons stated pretrial — on that ground.\n\n\n\n                                              39.\n\fhim and another student spray-painting Norteño-related graffiti on school walls. The\nstudents were arrested for vandalism.\n       (2) Modesto Police Department No. 99-21601: On March 15, 1999, an officer\nattempted to stop a stolen vehicle in which Saldana was one of the passengers.

Upon arrival,\nhe saw a white Ford Escort flee the area at a high rate of speed. When the vehicle was\nstopped, it was found to have been stolen. Saldana was the driver. One of the six\npassengers was Anthony Fuentes (Fuentes), whom Saldana identified in his wila as\nhaving snitched on him for carjacking. All were arrested for possession of stolen\nproperty, and Saldana was also arrested for reckless driving and driving without a license.\n       (6) Turlock Police Department No. 00-9172: On November 7, 2000, Fuentes was\nstopped by police while driving a stolen vehicle and was arrested for auto theft,\npossession of stolen property, and driving without a license. He said Saldana had given\nhim the car and car keys earlier that day. Saldana was then arrested for vehicle theft.\n       (7) Probation report by Probation Officer Delgado: On May 2, 2001, Saldana\nadmitted his moniker was Tito and that he began associating with Norteños while in\njunior high. Saldana said, however, he was no longer associated.\n25     For unknown reasons, no testimony was elicited concerning incident number 4.\n\n\n\n                                            40.\n\f       (8) Modesto Police Department No. 02-46694: On April 26, 2002, an officer\nstopped a vehicle driven by Michael Perez. Saldana and Fuentes were passengers. Both\nwere arrested for warrants.\n       (9) Notation by Probation Officer Garcia: On May 29, 2002, Saldana said the\nfour dots on his hand indicated being a Northerner. He admitted associating with\nNorteños.\n       (10) Turlock Police Department No. 02-10424: On October 29, 2002, officers\nwere dispatched to a shots-fired call in the 700 block of Angelus Street. The victim\nreported that her nephew, Saldana, had shot at her, after she got into an argument with\nSaldana and Fuentes. Another witness saw Saldana with an arm extended, pointing\ntoward the area of the victim, then he heard a gunshot. Saldana was arrested for assault\nwith a firearm. A latex balloon containing ten .22-caliber bullets was found on his\nperson.\n       (11) Juvenile hall intake assessment by Probation Officer Childers: On\nOctober 30, 2002, Saldana admitted being involved in the Norteño gang, but denied\n“claiming.”\n       (12) Probation report by Probation Officer Garcia: On April 17, 2003, Saldana\nadmitted associating with the Norteño gang.\n       (13) Notation by Officer Sharkie: On June 7, 2003, Sharkie conducted a\nprobation search of Saldana‟s bedroom. She found and confiscated one red hat, one red\nsweatshirt, and one red Heat jersey.\n       (14) Turlock Police Department No. 03-8782: On September 2, 2003, an officer\nresponded to Farr Street in Turlock in response to a report of a carjacking and\nkidnapping. The victim reported he had stopped at an intersection when a vehicle\nstopped in front of him and two individuals got out. One punched the victim and\nknocked him out. The victim identified Saldana and Fuentes as being with this person.\nThe victim said he was pulled from his car, thrown into its backseat, and driven to\n\n                                            41.\n\fanother area. This occurred because the victim had been associating with Sureños and\nwas believed to be giving them information. Fuentes and Saldana were arrested for\ncarjacking and kidnapping for carjacking.\n      (15) Turlock Police Department No. 04-7738: On August 4, 2004, police officers\nconducted a probation search at Saldana‟s residence. They located several firearms,\nincluding a sawed-off shotgun and ammunition, another modified shotgun, an illegally\nmodified .22-caliber rifle, a nine-millimeter revolver, and handgun ammunition. Saldana\nadmitted the firearms and ammunition were his, and said he had them to protect his\nresidence. His tattoos were documented as “W” on his left forearm and “S” on his right\nforearm, which Saldana stated stood for West Side. He had the word “Turlock” tattooed\non his upper back, and said he used the moniker Tito.\n      (16) Modesto Police Department No. 05-40681: On April 15, 2005, a Norteño\ngang membership roster was found on a wila in a cell at the Stanislaus County Jail that\nhoused Norteño gang members. Saldana‟s name was on the roster.\n      (17) DA Report No. 05-DA0234: On September 6, 2005, Mariscal interviewed\nthe victim of the earlier carjacking. The victim related he had been walking down the\nstreet when he was jumped by two individuals he identified as Saldana‟s cousins. They\ncalled him a rat and beat him up because he was going to testify against Saldana in the\ncarjacking case. The victim said he had been an active Norteño gang member with\nSaldana, and he identified Saldana as an active member.\n      (18) Modesto Police Department No. 07-73364: On August 3, 2007, Saldana was\nthe passenger in a vehicle with the license plate “Turloco.” Gutierrez and three others\nwere also in the car. Saldana said “VWS” stood for “Varrio West Side,” and he stated he\nwas a “Norteño only.”\n      (19) Turlock Police Department No. 07-11617: On November 27, 2007, officers\nconducted a parole search of Saldana‟s residence. In his bedroom closet, they found a\nloaded .38-caliber handgun. Saldana‟s girlfriend said the gun belonged to her, but gave\n\n                                            42.\n\fconflicting statements. Saldana was arrested for being a felon in possession of a firearm.\nDuring subsequent telephone calls to his girlfriend from jail, Saldana said Gutierrez was\ngoing to take blame for the gun. When the girlfriend said she would take the blame\nbecause she had already told police the gun was hers, Saldana said he would not allow\nher to take the blame, and that Gutierrez would do it.\n       (20) The current offense. When Gutierrez‟s wife was interviewed, she identified\nboth defendants as active gang members. On June 12, when booked into jail, Saldana\nadmitted he affiliated with Norteños.\n       As described in the statement of facts, ante, Mariscal opined that, on the date\nVillanueva was shot, Saldana was a Norteño gang member. Mariscal based this opinion\non all the reports and incidents he reviewed concerning Saldana.\n       2.     Applicable Legal Principles\n       “The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment [to the United States\nConstitution] provides: „In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right …\nto be confronted with the witnesses against him.‟ In [Crawford, supra,] 541 U.S. [at\npages] 53-54, [the United States Supreme Court] held that this provision bars „admission\nof testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was\nunavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-\nexamination.‟ A critical portion of this holding … is the phrase „testimonial statements.‟\nOnly statements of this sort cause the declarant to be a „witness‟ within the meaning of\nthe Confrontation Clause. [Citation.] It is the testimonial character of the statement that\nseparates it from other hearsay that, while subject to traditional limitations upon hearsay\nevidence, is not subject to the Confrontation Clause.” (Davis v. Washington (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145641\"><a href=\"/opinion/145641/davis-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 821 (Davis). “Accordingly, after Davis, the determination of whether the\nadmission of a hearsay statement violates a defendant‟s rights under the confrontation\nclause turns on whether the statement is testimonial. If the statement is testimonial, it\nmust be excluded unless the declarant is unavailable as a witness and the defendant had a\n\n                                             43.\n\fprior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. If the statement is not testimonial, it\ndoes not implicate the confrontation clause, and the issue is simply whether the statement\nis admissible under state law as an exception to the hearsay rule.” (People v. Garcia\n(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. at pp. 51-52, 53, fn. 4.)\nThe court observed that “[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government\nofficers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an\nacquaintance does not.” (Id. at p. 51.)\n       In Davis, the high court declined to attempt to classify all conceivable statements\n— even those made in response to questioning by police — as either testimonial or\nnontestimonial. (Davis, supra, 547 U.S. at p. 822.) It did further define the categories,\nhowever, stating: “Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police\ninterrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the\ninterrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are\ntestimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing\n\n                                              44.\n\femergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past\nevents potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.” (Ibid., fn. omitted.)\n       From Davis, the California Supreme Court has derived several basic principles.\n“First, …, the confrontation clause is concerned solely with hearsay statements that are\ntestimonial, in that they are out-of-court analogs, in purpose and form, of the testimony\ngiven by witnesses at trial. Second, though a statement need not be sworn under oath to\nbe testimonial, it must have occurred under circumstances that imparted, to some degree,\nthe formality and solemnity characteristic of testimony. Third, the statement must have\nbeen given and taken primarily for the purpose ascribed to testimony — to establish or\nprove some past fact for possible use in a criminal trial. Fourth, the primary purpose for\nwhich a statement was given and taken is to be determined „objectively,‟ considering all\nthe circumstances that might reasonably bear on the intent of the participants in the\nconversation. Fifth, sufficient formality and solemnity are present when, in a\nnonemergency situation, one responds to questioning by law enforcement officials, where\ndeliberate falsehoods might be criminal offenses. Sixth, statements elicited by law\nenforcement officials are not testimonial if the primary purpose in giving and receiving\nthem is to deal with a contemporaneous emergency, rather than to produce evidence\nabout past events for possible use at a criminal trial.” (People v. Cage, supra, 40 Cal.4th\nat p. 984, fns. omitted.) “It is the „primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute\nfor trial testimony‟ that implicates the confrontation clause. [Citation.] Consequently, if\na statement is not offered for its truth, or is nontestimonial in character, the confrontation\nclause is not a bar to admission.” (People v.

Nevertheless, the\ncourt found itself bound by Gardeley and similar California Supreme Court precedent,\nand so concluded the trial court in the case before it properly determined the challenged\nbasis evidence did not violate the hearsay rule or confrontation clause, since it was not\noffered for its truth but only to evaluate the expert‟s opinions. (Hill, supra, at p. 1131.)\n\n\n\n                                             46.\n\f       The United States Supreme Court itself has produced fractured opinions\nconcerning Crawford‟s application to expert testimony and the information on which\nsuch testimony is based.

It has yet to do so, however, with respect to\nthe basis evidence of a gang expert, whose testimony is usually based, at least in part, on\nhis or her own experience and investigation.\n       Post-Crawford, reliability is not part of the confrontation clause inquiry. (People\nv. Wilson (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2590700\"><a href=\"/opinion/2590700/people-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343.) It remains relevant with respect to expert\ntestimony, however: “[A]ny material that forms the basis of an expert‟s opinion\ntestimony must be reliable. [Citation.] For „the law does not accord to the expert‟s\nopinion the same degree of credence or integrity as it does the data underlying the\nopinion.

[Citations.]” (Gardeley, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 618.)\n       The California Supreme Court has cautioned that “prejudice may arise if, „“under\nthe guise of reasons,”‟ the expert‟s detailed explanation „“[brings] before the jury\nincompetent hearsay evidence.”‟ [Citations.]” (People v.

[Citation.]” (People v. Montiel, supra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 919.) In\naddition, “[a] trial court … „has considerable discretion to control the form in which the\nexpert is questioned to prevent the jury from learning of incompetent hearsay.‟\n[Citation.] A trial court also has discretion „to weigh the probative value of inadmissible\nevidence relied upon by an expert witness … against the risk that the jury might\nimproperly consider it as independent proof of the facts recited therein.‟ [Citation.] This\nis because a witness‟s on-the-record recitation of sources relied on for an expert opinion\ndoes not transform inadmissible matter into „independent proof‟ of any fact. [Citations.]”\n(Gardeley, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 619.) Evidence Code section 352 further “authorizes\nthe court to exclude from an expert‟s testimony any hearsay matter whose irrelevance,\nunreliability, or potential for prejudice outweighs its proper probative value. [Citation.]”\n(People v. Montiel, supra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 919.)\n       3.     Analysis\n       As previously described, defendants challenge Mariscal‟s recitation of their prior\nbad acts on Crawford, reliability, and Evidence Code section 352 grounds. “„It is, of\ncourse, “the general rule”‟ — to which we find no exception here — „“that questions\nrelating to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of\na specific and timely objection in the trial court on the ground sought to be urged on\nappeal.”‟ [Citations.]” (People v.

We will assume, for the\nsake of argument, that the isolated references by the court and counsel to reliability,\nprejudice, and probative value were sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a timely and\nspecific objection with respect to those grounds. (Compare People v.

The problem is, Gutierrez neither secured a\nruling initially nor reiterated his objections when Mariscal testified before the jury.\nSaldana likewise did not secure a ruling initially; although he did request and obtain a\ncontinuing objection on confrontation clause grounds, he did not reiterate any of the other\ngrounds for exclusion he now asserts.\n       “„[T]he absence of an adverse ruling precludes any appellate challenge.‟\n[Citation.] In other words, when, as here, the defendant does not secure a ruling, he does\nnot preserve the point.

When such a\nmotion is made and denied, the issue is preserved for appeal.

Subsequently, it also\nmade clear that Saldana‟s continuing objection under Crawford did not encompass, or\nexcuse Saldana from making, objections on other grounds.\n       Under these circumstances, we conclude defendants failed to preserve some, if not\nall, of the issues for appeal. “Because the trial court did not rule on [their] objections in\nlimine, [they] „[were] obligated to press for such a ruling and to object to [the evidence]\nuntil [they] obtained one. [They] failed to do so, thus depriving the trial court of the\n\n\n\n\n26      Evidence Code section 353 provides: “A verdict or finding shall not be set aside,\nnor shall the judgment or decision based thereon be reversed, by reason of the erroneous\nadmission of evidence unless: [¶] (a) There appears of record an objection to or a\nmotion to exclude or to strike the evidence that was timely made and so stated as to make\nclear the specific ground of the objection or motion; and [¶] (b) The court which passes\nupon the effect of the error or errors is of the opinion that the admitted evidence should\nhave been excluded on the ground stated and that the error or errors complained of\nresulted in a miscarriage of justice.”\n\n\n\n                                             50.\n\fopportunity to correct potential error.‟ [Citation.]” (People v.

Defendants say the evidence\nwas “designed to inflame the passions and prejudices of the jury” against them.\n       Generally speaking, “[t]he erroneous admission of expert testimony only warrants\nreversal if „it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party\nwould have been reached in the absence of the error.‟ [Citations.]” (People v.

Counsel for Gutierrez elicited, in his cross-\nexamination of Mariscal, that the prior incidents were merely contacts with law\nenforcement, and that if counsel yelled at a police officer out in the hall or something\nsimilar, that could be listed as a contact. Counsel further elicited that Gutierrez was not\nconvicted for the prior acts except for the one in 1999. Counsel for Saldana elicited, in\nhis cross-examination of Mariscal, that part of Mariscal‟s opinion was based on reports as\nopposed to his own personal knowledge, and that reliability was always an issue with\nrespect to reports, in that Mariscal had to make a determination whether a report was to\nbe believed.\n       Significantly, jurors were instructed not to disregard the testimony of any witness\n(which here included defendants) “without a reason or because of prejudice or desire to\nfavor one side or the other.” They were told they had to decide whether information on\nwhich an expert relied was “true and accurate.” They were also told, however, that in\nreaching their conclusions as expert witnesses, Mariscal and Teso “considered statements\nmade by the defendants, other gang members, other gang experts, police officers,\ndetectives, probation officers, and parole officers. You may consider those statements\nonly to evaluate the expert‟s opinion.

The Wilas (Gutierrez, Saldana)\n       Defendants claim the trial court erred when it failed to redact those portions of the\nwilas attributed to them that were more prejudicial than probative. They say admission\nof the evidence violated their federal and state due process rights to a fair trial. We\nconclude any error was harmless.\n       1.     Background\n       The prosecutor moved, in limine, for admission of the wilas that are described in\nthe statement of facts, ante. He asserted they were highly probative on the issues of\npremeditation, motive for Villanueva‟s removal from Norteño ranks, and defendants‟\n\n\n\n\n                                             55.\n\fknowledge of the criminal gang activity of the Norteño gang as required for proof of the\ngang enhancement allegation. Copies of the wilas were attached to the motion.29\n       Gutierrez asserted that portions of the wilas were irrelevant, highly prejudicial,\nand inflammatory, and should be excluded under Evidence Code section 352. An attempt\nby counsel to reach an agreement on redactions was unsuccessful, and so the matter was\nleft for the court‟s determination.\n       Saldana objected only to certain portions of his wila. He first objected to No. 6, in\nwhich Saldana related he had two strikes, one for carjacking and one for assault with a\nfirearm.30 The prosecutor conceded Saldana only had one strike — for carjacking — and\nthat the strike allegation had been bifurcated. He argued, however, that the same\ninformation was going to come in through the gang expert‟s testimony concerning the\nprimary activities of the gang, and also that, considered in conjunction with the answer in\nNo. 15 about “Chubbs” (Anthony Fuentes), it was probative on the now-jury-issue of\nauthentication. Gutierrez joined, noting No. 6 of his wila related that he had one strike.\nHe argued the connotation of having a strike was particularly prejudicial, beyond even\nthe criminal record itself. The trial court directed the prosecutor to redact references to\nstrikes, but to leave the charges. As for the reference in Saldana‟s wila to assault with a\nfirearm, the court declined to redact it, saying, “[I]f that is what he or somebody else puts,\nthat‟s what stays in there,” and if it was incorrect, the defense could address the\ndiscrepancy at trial.\n\n\n29     The prosecutor‟s in limine motion also addressed authentication. The trial court\nheld an Evidence Code section 403 hearing on the issue. It determined there was\nsufficient proof of authenticity to allow the wilas to go before the jury, but permitted\ndefendants to challenge authentication in front of the jury.\n30     The information contained in the wilas corresponded to the Norteño new arrival\nquestionnaire and apparently was numbered accordingly. The questionnaire itself is not\ncontained in the record.\n\n\n\n                                             56.\n\f       Saldana next objected to No. 10, which set out the times and places he was\nincarcerated beginning in 2004, the charges he faced, the fact he was on parole at one\npoint, and three people who were in custody with him at each location. He argued this\nportion of the wila was confusing and had no real probative value. The prosecutor\nresponded that there would be expert testimony the people listed were Norteños. He\nsought admission of No. 10 in its entirety, to show an ongoing association of three or\nmore members and to counter any suggestion Varrio West Side Turlock was merely a\nneighborhood or club. The prosecutor argued that the listing in the wila of individuals\nfrom other cliques was consistent with the gang expert‟s anticipated testimony, and went\ndirectly to one of the required elements of section 186.22. The prosecutor agreed the\ninformation was being offered for a limited purpose, and noted the jury instructions\nwould directly address the limited use to which the gang expert‟s testimony could be put.\nThe trial court ruled No. 10 would be allowed, subject to a limiting instruction.\n       Counsel for Saldana stated: “Then I would object to a copy of [exhibit] 56 being\npresented to the jury if -- it sounds like it is all going to get in, then let‟s let it all in and\ngive them the original and let them decide whether that was actually written by Mr.\nSaldana.” He emphasized that he wanted the jury to have the original, not an enlarged\ncopy. Asked by the court if he was withdrawing any objections, counsel stated: “Yes.\nBut I want them to see the original.” After a brief discussion about whether the\nenlargement could also be admitted, the court clarified, “[Saldana] is withdrawing any\nobjection, so long as the original is introduced into evidence.” Counsel for Saldana\nresponded, “Yes.”\n       The hearing then turned to Gutierrez‟s objections. He first objected to No. 6,\nwhich related that he had one strike for assault with a firearm in 1999. Gutierrez argued\nthe whole area ought to be redacted, because typically a jury would not be told about\nsomeone‟s criminal background. The court ruled the word “strike” would be redacted,\nbut the remainder would be admitted for a limited purpose.\n\n                                                57.\n\f       Gutierrez next objected to No. 10, which related the same sort of information as\nwas contained in No. 10 of Saldana‟s wila, and stated that at one point, Gutierrez was\nreturned to county jail for “666/187” but charges were never filed. Counsel for Gutierrez\nargued that allowing the jury to hear about assaults with a firearm and attempted murder,\nfor which charges were never filed, was “incredibly prejudicial” and would cause jurors\nto be biased against him because they would think somehow he got away with something.\nCounsel also argued this was in essence a coerced statement rather than an admission,\nsince people were required to answer these questions in order to survive in jail. The\nprosecutor responded that, as was the case with Saldana, No. 10 showed association with\ngang members from other groups and the requisite ongoing association of three or more\npeople. The prosecutor also argued it would counter the anticipated defense argument,\nthat “this is nothing but a bunch of boys who were foolish or knuckleheads .…” The\ncourt found no evidence of coercion, and ruled No. 10 was admissible, subject to a\nlimiting instruction.\n       Gutierrez next objected to No. 24, which read, “Yes, I will assist La Casa in a\nremoval at any time.” Defense counsel expressed concern the jury could take that to\nmean Gutierrez was prepared to kill someone. He also related that he “probably” did not\nintend to contest that Gutierrez was the source of at least some of the information in the\nwila, and so, since he was “not going to be aggressively or non-aggressively disputing a\nlot of things in front of this jury,” did not believe the prosecutor had “all these big\nhurdles .…” The trial court ruled No. 24 would be received, subject to a limiting\ninstruction.\n       Gutierrez next objected to No. 25, which listed other charges pending against him.\nDefense counsel argued the fact someone might have charges pending was not relevant\nand was prejudicial overkill, and he expressed concern the jury would conclude Gutierrez\nwas someone who did not observe the law. The prosecutor argued the information, when\nconsidered in conjunction with the chronology and charges listed in No. 10, was\n\n                                              58.\n\fprobative of authentication, and the fact Gutierrez said he was arrested for manufacturing\nwent to the primary activities of the gang. The information coming from Gutierrez\nhimself would add to the credibility of the gang expert‟s opinion testimony concerning\nthe primary activities of the gang. The trial court ruled the evidence would be allowed,\nsubject to a limiting instruction.\n       Gutierrez had no further objections. The trial court again confirmed that counsel\nfor Saldana wanted the entire wila admitted as to his client.\n       The wilas were admitted into evidence during Mariscal‟s testimony. With respect\nto Gutierrez‟s wila, Mariscal testified in part that his investigation revealed other\nevidence showing Gutierrez had a conviction for assault with a firearm in 1999; one of\nthe charges listed — possessing pills for sale — was consistent with one of the primary\nactivities of the Norteño gang; and Gutierrez‟s pending charges included a moving\nviolation, which involved Gutierrez being stopped approximately two weeks before the\nshooting in the white Altima that was burned in San Jose after the shooting.\n       Mariscal read No. 10 to the jury. He explained that the references to “3Ns” were\nconsistent with someone reporting other active Norteños with whom he was housed, and\nthat this played into the requirement of an ongoing association of three or more people.\nThis was an example of a gang member associating with other Norteños. Mariscal\ntestified No. 16 read, “I have no problems functioning with la casa‟s expectations,” which\ntold Mariscal that Gutierrez was fully willing to be an active participant in the Norteño\norganization in custody, and to follow their rules, policies, and expected behavior. With\nrespect to No. 24, in which Gutierrez wrote he would assist La Casa in a removal at any\ntime, Mariscal testified this indicated Gutierrez was willing to participate in a removal or\nassault upon someone if the gang determined a fellow gang member was to be removed\nor assaulted for any reason. Mariscal also read No. 15 to the jury, in which Gutierrez\nexplained how Villanueva was threatening the lives of Gutierrez and his children, and\nabout the altercation in which Saldana was assaulted.\n\n                                             59.\n\f        Mariscal‟s testimony concerning Saldana‟s wila was similar with respect to the\nmeaning and significance of various portions, and how the wila played into his opinions\nin this case.31 Mariscal read No. 15 to the jury; in it, Saldana stated that, although he was\nnot aware if Villanueva was active or nonactive, on several occasions he promoted\nhimself as a degenerate. Mariscal explained that a degenerate was the worse possible\nthing a gang member could be in the eyes of the gang. Saldana also wrote about how\nVillanueva and his companions threatened Saldana and his family, and about the\naltercation at the wedding reception. Saldana said they arrived in a car driven by\nFuentes, also known as Chubbs, who “snitched” on Saldana for carjacking in 2004.\nSaldana wrote that people were saying “they” killed Villanueva because they had the\nmost problems with him, and now people were threatening to kill their children and their\nmother.\n        Gutierrez testified that he suffered a felony assault conviction in 1999. He\nadmitted Northerners dealt drugs as one of their primary activities, and that, after the\nMarch 22 fight, he hung around with other gang members, dealing drugs. He testified\nMariscal was correct when he said Norteños dealt drugs as one of their primary activities.\nHe testified that although he did not know Bond No. 13, he answered yes to the question\nabout it just to let “them” know he would assist in “whatever it was.” He also testified\nthat when he wrote he had no problem functioning with La Casa‟s expectations, he meant\nwhatever was expected or asked by the Norteño gang. With respect to his answer about\nassisting in removal, he explained that to him, removal meant assaulting someone,\npossibly a fellow gang member. So far as he knew, there was no way a Norteño got\nremoved other than being assaulted.\n\n\n\n31      At one point, counsel for Saldana objected that Mariscal was not reading the entire\nwila.\n\n\n\n                                             60.\n\f       Saldana testified that he was convicted of carjacking in 2006. He was also facing\na kidnapping charge with a potential life sentence, and so he accepted a deal in which the\nkidnapping charge was dropped and he received three years. Asked why, if he did not\nshoot Villanueva, he fled with his brother, Saldana brought up his parole status. Asked\nwhat he meant when he wrote, “It would be an honor to assist la casa in a removal,” he\nresponded he did not know. Asked if he would do anything the gang told him to do, he\nreplied, “Yeah, pretty much.”\n       The limiting instructions given to the jury with respect to the gang evidence are\ndescribed ante. In addition, jurors were told they had heard evidence defendants made an\noral or written statement before trial; jurors were to decide whether a defendant made any\nsuch statement in whole or in part; if they decided a defendant made such a statement, it\nwas to be considered along with all the other evidence, and jurors were to decide how\nmuch importance to give it; and they could not convict a defendant of any crime based on\nhis out-of-court statements alone.\n\n\n\n\n                                            61.\n\f       2.     Analysis32\n       Evidence Code section 352 provides: “The court in its discretion may exclude\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its\nadmission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger\nof undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.” Under this\nstatute,\n\n       “[a] trial court may exclude otherwise relevant evidence when its probative\n       value is substantially outweighed by concerns of undue prejudice,\n       confusion, or consumption of time. [Citations.] „“„Prejudice‟ as\n       contemplated by [Evidence Code] section 352 is not so sweeping as to\n       include any evidence the opponent finds inconvenient. Evidence is not\n       prejudicial, as that term is used in a section 352 context, merely because it\n       undermines the opponent‟s position or shores up that of the proponent.

Some of the information\nrecited in the wilas about defendants‟ criminal activity came before the jury through their\nown testimony, and so was probative on the question of the wilas‟ authenticity, a disputed\nquestion upon which the jury had to make the final determination. It can hardly have\ncome as a surprise to jurors that defendants had been in custody and faced charges\nbeyond those for which they were on trial; in addition to admitting he had a prior felony\nconviction for assault, Gutierrez testified he had been in a lot of fights, mostly because of\nthe people with whom he associated, said he planned to sell marijuana on the day of the\nshooting, and admitted intentionally burning a vehicle; while Saldana admitted his prior\nconviction for carjacking also originally involved a kidnapping charge, and that he was\non parole at the time of the shooting.\n\n\n\n\n                                             63.\n\f       Many of the past or pending charges recited in the wilas were probative of\nMariscal‟s opinions concerning the Norteños‟ primary activities and pattern of criminal\ngang activity, and the prosecutor questioned Mariscal about them in that context.\nDefendants point to the fact there was testimony Stanislaus County contained 3,000 to\n4,000 documented Norteños, but the prosecutor was still required to prove every element\nof the section 186.22, subdivision (b) enhancement, including the existence of a criminal\nstreet gang as defined in subdivision (f) of section 186.22. Thus, he had to prove not only\nan ongoing association of three or more persons, but also the primary activity or activities\nof that group, and that the group‟s members engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity\nas defined in subdivision (e) of the statute. (See People v.

The information in the wilas concerning other Norteños\nwith whom defendants had been incarcerated was also probative; it demonstrated that the\nvarious cliques — including Varrio West Side Turlock — were not simply neighborhood\ngroups, but were under the larger Norteño criminal street gang umbrella. (See People v.\nWilliams (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2260066\"><a href=\"/opinion/2260066/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In light\nof the properly admitted evidence and the trial court‟s limiting instructions, however, we\nconclude defendants have failed to satisfy the required “high constitutional standard to\nshow that the erroneous admission of evidence resulted in an unfair trial.” (People v.\nAlbarran, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at p. 229; see People v.

We disagree.\n       To establish the gang enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b), “the\nprosecution must prove that the crime for which the defendant was convicted had been\n„committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street\ngang, [and that it was committed] with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in\nany criminal conduct by gang members.‟ [Citations.]” (Gardeley, supra, 14 Cal.4th at\n\n\n\n                                             65.\n\fpp. 616-617.)33 Defendants say the evidence fails to prove the shooting was to benefit\nthe gang or that it was done with the requisite specific intent.\n       The test of sufficiency of the evidence is whether, reviewing the whole record in\nthe light most favorable to the judgment below, substantial evidence is disclosed such\nthat a reasonable trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a\nreasonable doubt.

Morales, supra, 112 Cal.App.4th at p. 1198.) From\nthe information contained in the wilas, together with the testimony of the gang experts,\nhowever, the jury here reasonably could have concluded the shooting was gang related,\nand that defendants “relied on their common gang membership and the apparatus of the\ngang” — particularly the assumption none of the witnesses would interfere with\ndefendants‟ actions or later talk to police — in committing the crime. (Albillar, supra, 51\nCal.4th at pp. 60, 61-62.) That defendants are brothers “does not cancel out that [joint\ngang] membership.” (People v.

Nevertheless, such testimony constitutes circumstantial evidence jurors may take\n\n34     The verdicts in this case accurately stated the requirement in the disjunctive.\nNeither the jury nor we need find evidence showing the crime was committed for the\nbenefit of or at the direction of the Norteño gang, if there is substantial evidence the\ncrime was committed in association with a gang.\n\n\n\n                                             67.\n\finto consideration in determining whether the prosecution has proven the elements of the\ncriminal street gang enhancement.

The fact there was also evidence the Norteño gang disapproved of\n“red-on-red” violence, and that Miguel Perez, a gang dropout, nevertheless socialized\nwith a number of individuals with ties to the gang, was something for jurors to assess and\ndoes not render the evidence supporting the enhancement insufficient.\n\n\n\n                                            68.\n\fcriminal conduct by each other as gang members.36 Section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)\n“applies when a defendant has personally committed a gang-related felony with the\nspecific intent to aid members of that gang.” (Albillar, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 68.) Here,\nthere was ample evidence defendants intended to attack Villanueva, assisted each other in\nbringing about his demise, and were each members of the Norteño criminal street gang.\n“Accordingly, there was substantial evidence that defendants acted with the specific\nintent to promote, further, or assist gang members in that criminal conduct.” (Ibid.; see\nEmery v.

This does not mean, however,\nthe gang enhancement was unsupported by substantial evidence. It was up to jurors to\ndetermine what evidence to believe.

We agree with the Attorney\nGeneral that there was no abuse of discretion and, in any event, Saldana cannot show\nprejudice.\n\n                                             71.\n\fA.        Background\n          At the outset of trial, security apparently consisted of having two bailiffs in the\ncourtroom. Late in the prosecution‟s case-in-chief, the trial court was informed\nGutierrez‟s cell had been searched and a potential weapon found. The court proposed to\nimpose additional security measures “incrementally,” by allowing defendants to remain\nunshackled in the courtroom, but requiring them to be separated by a chair‟s width or\nmore and to keep their hands visible at all times while in court. It was the court‟s intent\nthat if they put their hands into their pockets for any reason, the jury would be recessed\nand defendants would be placed in shackles. After discussion, the court adopted these\nmeasures, finding them the “most-minimum thing this Court should be doing at this\npoint.”\n          Prior to Gutierrez testifying, the trial court noted its inclination to have a bailiff sit\nnear Gutierrez during that testimony. Counsel for Gutierrez objected. He conceded that,\nsince the earlier incident, a small razor had been found in the cell Gutierrez shared with\nanother inmate, but represented Gutierrez simply used it to shave around the sides of his\nhead. Counsel argued “it inherently would be viewed as prejudicial to have somebody up\nthere by him.” He further suggested that if a bailiff were placed by Gutierrez when\nGutierrez testified, the court would be obliged to do the same if Saldana took the stand.\nWhen the court agreed, counsel for Saldana stated he would be opposed. The court\nsuggested Gutierrez could be allowed to testify without a bailiff present, with the\nunderstanding he was required to keep his hands on the witness box, fully visible at all\ntimes, and if he pulled his hands down, the bailiff would “go[] up.” Counsel for\nGutierrez agreed to that procedure. Counsel for Saldana requested that the issue be\nrevisited, with respect to his client, after everyone saw how things went during\nGutierrez‟s testimony. The court agreed. With respect to Gutierrez, the court ordered\nthat there would not be a bailiff immediately next to him as long as he kept his hands on\nthe witness box, fully visible, at all times; if he moved either hand off the wood of the\n\n                                                 72.\n\fwitness box, security would be put in place; and if he was called upon by counsel to stand\nfor demonstration purposes, counsel was to notify the court before asking such questions,\nwhereupon a bailiff would come up and be in Gutierrez‟s immediate presence.\n       Gutierrez‟s testimony proceeded in accord with the court‟s order.40 The record\nshows he was allowed to stand up and demonstrate the position he was in when,\naccording to his testimony, Villanueva kicked him, and also what happened with the gun\nat that time.\n       Counsel for Saldana subsequently advised the court that he intended to call\nSaldana to testify, but he wanted him to be able to do so without having to be constantly\nconscious of keeping his hands in a certain position. Counsel did not believe that was\n“conducive to giving well-considered answers to the questions,” and argued there had to\nbe some showing Saldana himself posed some kind of threat. The court ruled that if\nSaldana wished to testify, he was to keep his hands visible at all times. If he failed to do\nso, a bailiff would be placed next to him during his testimony. The court stated it was\n“taking minimal-security precautions in light of the nature of this case and the\ninformation … received about the defendant, Gutierrez, in particular.”\n       Saldana‟s testimony proceeded in accord with the court‟s order. The record shows\nhe gestured with his hand or hands during at least one portion of his testimony.\nB.

Insofar as the record shows, one bailiff was at the back by the entryway, one\nwas standing by the rail, and one was next to where defendants were seated.\n\n\n\n                                             73.\n\faccord, People v.

So too must a security\ndevice such as a stun belt, which, although not visible to the jury, may have a debilitating\npsychological effect on a testifying defendant. (People v.

Even stationing a bailiff near the witness stand while a\ndefendant testifies is not inherently prejudicial; “evaluat[ing] the likely effects of the\nprocedure „based on reason, principle, and common human experience‟ [citation],” no\n“„“unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.”‟\n[Citation.]” (People v.

Because such a practice is\nnot inherently prejudicial, “it need not be justified by a compelling case-specific showing\nof need. [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 637.)\n       Even where a security procedure is not inherently prejudicial, a trial court must\nexercise its own discretion, rather than deferring to a generic policy or abdicating\n\n                                              74.\n\fdecisionmaking to law enforcement officers, in determining whether a particular security\nmeasure is appropriate on a case-by-case basis. (People v. Hernandez, supra, 51 Cal.4th\nat p. 742.) Similarly, although the prosecutor “may bring to the court‟s attention matters\nwhich bear on the issue,” the prosecutor “plays no necessary part” in the trial court‟s\ndetermination whether security measures should be imposed and, if so, of what nature\nand to what degree. (People v. Duran, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 293, fn. 12.)\n       An order to a testifying defendant to keep his or her hands visible at all times is\nclearly not inherently prejudicial, especially where, as here, the defendant is permitted to\ngesticulate while testifying and the only threatened consequence for disobedience is to\nhave a bailiff placed near the witness box — itself not an inherently prejudicial measure.\nThe record amply demonstrates that before making any orders, the trial court here\nundertook “a thoughtful, case-specific consideration of the need for heightened security,\n[and] of the potential prejudice that might result.” (People v. Hernandez, supra, 51\nCal.4th at p. 743.) It did not abuse its discretion in imposing what it accurately termed\n“minimal” security precautions.\n       Saldana complains, however, that the court made no findings specifically with\nrespect to him and the potential threat he posed, as opposed to making findings based on\nGutierrez‟s alleged misconduct. Recent California Supreme Court cases speak in terms\nof case-specific or case-by-case determinations, and not in terms of defendant-specific\nones. (See People v. Hernandez, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 743; People v. Stevens, supra, 47\nCal.4th at pp. 642-643.) We are not aware of any authority precluding a court from\ntaking into account one defendant‟s conduct in determining whether to impose security\nmeasures on a codefendant, especially where the codefendants are relatives and fellow\ngang members who are charged with premeditated murder, where the alleged misconduct\nby one of them involves possession of potential weapons, and where the security\nmeasures imposed are minimal and not inherently prejudicial. (See People v. Ainsworth,\n\n\n\n                                             75.\n\fsupra, 45 Cal.3d at p. 1004 [assessing reasonableness of security measures in light of\nnature of charges].)\n       Assuming the trial court erred, however, in not making particularized findings as\nto Saldana, because the measure imposed was not inherently prejudicial, any error is one\nof state law only and so is assessed under the Watson standard. (People v. Hernandez,\nsupra, 51 Cal.4th at pp. 745-746.)41 The record shows no prejudice. Although defense\ncounsel argued potential adverse effects on Saldana‟s testimony before Saldana actually\ntook the witness stand, there is no suggestion they came to fruition during the testimony.\nSaldana clearly was not deterred from testifying (and had the benefit of seeing how the\n“hands visible” order would work during Gutierrez‟s testimony), and the record contains\nno hint the order affected the quality or content of his testimony, his ability to concentrate\non the questions and give well-thought-out answers, his demeanor, or his ability to\ncommunicate with counsel or participate in his defense.

He says that in order to convict\nan aider and abettor of murder, the jury must find he or she had the individual specific\nintent to kill; hence, by refusing Saldana‟s requested modification of the instruction, the\ntrial court committed federal constitutional error by omitting or at least misdescribing an\nelement of the offense. The Attorney General says the jury was properly instructed. We\nagree with the Attorney General.\nA.     Background\n       During the jury instruction conference, the trial court stated its intent to give\nCALCRIM No. 400 (Aiding and Abetting: General Principles) and CALCRIM No. 401\n(Aiding and Abetting: Intended Crimes). Although there was no objection to CALCRIM\nNo. 400, counsel for Saldana objected that CALCRIM No. 401 was “inadequate” because\nit failed to say the aider and abettor had to share the intent of the perpetrator, meaning\n“the person has to have the same specific intent here, the specific intent to kill.” When\nthe court expressed its belief the instruction said what was necessary, counsel responded\nthat he did not believe it was clear enough. Counsel for Saldana requested that the\nsecond element, which read, “The defendant knew that the perpetrator intended to\ncommit the crime;” be modified to state, “The defendant knew that the perpetrator\nintended to commit the crime with the same specific intent to kill, and does, in fact, aid\nand facilitate, promote, encourage.” The court refused the proposed modification, but\nstated Saldana was nevertheless free to argue the point to the jury.\n       The trial court subsequently instructed the jury in the language of CALCRIM\nNo. 400 as follows:\n\n              “A person may be guilty of a crime in two ways:\n\n              “One, he or she may have directly committed the crime. I will call\n       that person the perpetrator.\n\n              “Two, he or she may have aided and abetted a perpetrator who\n       directly committed the crime.\n\n\n                                             77.\n\f             “A person is guilty of a crime whether he or she committed it\n       personally or aided and abetted the perpetrator.”\nThis was immediately followed by CALCRIM No. 401, to wit:\n\n              “To prove that a defendant is guilty of a crime based on aiding and\n       abetting that crime, the People must prove that:\n\n              “One, the perpetrator committed the crime;\n\n              “Two, the defendant knew that the perpetrator intended to commit\n       the crime;\n\n              “Three, before or during the commission of the crime, the defendant\n       intended to aid and abet the perpetrator in committing the crime;\n\n              “And, four, the defendant[‟]s words or conduct did, in fact, aid and\n       abet the perpetrator‟s commission of the crime.\n\n              “Someone aid[]s and abets a crime if he or she knows of the\n       perpetrator’s unlawful purpose, and he or she specifically intends to, and\n       does, in fact, aid, facility [sic], promote, encourage, or instigate the\n       perpetrator’s commission of that crime.\n\n               “If all of these requirements are proved, the defendants not need\n       [sic] to have actually been present when the crime was committed to be\n       guilty as an aider and abett[o]r.\n\n              “If you conclude that a defendant was present at the scene of the\n       crime or failed to prevent the crime, you may consider that fact to\n       determine whether the defendant was an aider and abett[o]r.\n\n               “However, the fact that a person is present at the scene of a crime or\n       failed to prevent the crime, does not by itself make him or her an aider and\n       abett[o]r.” (Italics added.)\nB.

Only the intended crime is at issue here;\naccordingly, nothing we say takes into account natural and probable consequences.\n\n\n\n                                              81.\n\fhas “defined the required mental states and acts for aiding and abetting as: „(a) the direct\nperpetrator‟s actus reus — a crime committed by the direct perpetrator, (b) the aider and\nabettor‟s mens rea — knowledge of the direct perpetrator‟s unlawful intent and an intent\nto assist in achieving those unlawful ends, and (c) the aider and abettor‟s actus reus —\nconduct by the aider and abettor that in fact assists the achievement of the crime.‟\n[Citation.]” (People v.

McCoy, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 1118, fn. omitted.) “Aider and\nabettor liability is thus vicarious only in the sense that the aider and abettor is liable for\nanother‟s actions as well as that person‟s own actions. When a person „chooses to\nbecome a part of the criminal activity of another, [he] says in essence, “your acts are my\nacts .…”‟ [Citations.] But that person‟s own acts are also [his] acts for which [he] is also\nliable. Moreover, that person‟s mental state is [his] own; [he] is liable for [his] mens rea,\nnot the other person‟s.” (Ibid.)\n       In the present case, jurors were instructed on first and second degree murder,\njustifiable homicide based on self-defense, accident, and voluntary manslaughter based\non sudden quarrel or heat of passion. They were also told to separately consider the\nevidence as it applied to each defendant, and that they must decide each charge for each\ndefendant separately. Further, they were instructed that in order to convict a defendant of\nfirst degree murder, they had to find, inter alia, intent to kill and premeditation.\n       Pursuant to CALCRIM No. 401, in order to find Saldana guilty of first degree\nmurder based on aiding and abetting that crime, jurors had to find proven beyond a\n\n                                              82.\n\freasonable doubt that Gutierrez committed first degree murder; Saldana knew Gutierrez\nintended to commit first degree murder; before or during the commission of first degree\nmurder, Saldana intended to aid and abet Gutierrez in committing first degree murder;\nand Saldana‟s words or conduct did in fact aid and abet Gutierrez‟s commission of first\ndegree murder. CALCRIM No. 401 further explained that Saldana aided and abetted first\ndegree murder if he knew of Gutierrez‟s unlawful purpose — the commission of\nintentional, premeditated murder — and he specifically intended to, and did in fact, aid,\nfacilitate, promote, encourage, or instigate Gutierrez‟s commission of such murder. (See\nPeople v. Mendoza, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 1123.)\n       In our view, the instructions as a whole clearly and unmistakably required the jury\nto make an individual determination of Saldana‟s mental state. Saldana says he might\nhave known Gutierrez had the intent to kill, but might not have had the same intent. This\nis true. However, CALCRIM No. 401 required jurors to find not only that Saldana knew\nof Gutierrez‟s intent to kill, but also that Saldana intended to aid and abet Gutierrez in\ncommitting murder. This, considered with the instructions on lesser and justifiable forms\nof homicide, manifestly required jurors to consider Saldana‟s mental state separate and\napart from Gutierrez‟s mental state.44 Significantly, CALCRIM No. 400, as given here,\ndid not tell jurors, misleadingly, that a person is equally guilty of the crime of which the\nperpetrator is guilty whether he or she committed it personally or aided and abetted the\nperpetrator. (See People v. Samaniego, supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1164-1165.)\n\n44     “Murder includes both actus reus and mens rea elements.” (People v.

The actus reus element requires that an act of either the\ndefendant or an accomplice be the proximate cause of death. The mens rea element\nrequires that the defendant personally act with malice aforethought. (Ibid.; People v.\nMcCoy, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 1118.) As a practical matter, “[i]t would be virtually\nimpossible for a person to know of another‟s intent to murder and decide to aid in\naccomplishing the crime without at least a brief period of deliberation and premeditation,\nwhich is all that is required.

This does not mean there exists a reasonable likelihood the\njury was misled, however. “Implicit in the notion of someone „sharing‟ another‟s intent\nis knowledge of that intent and harboring the same purpose oneself.” (People v.

That‟s one benefit. Second benefit, what does that do to the\n      individual status of the two assailants?\n\n              “You know, are Tito and Ramo fledgling gang members? Are they\n      wannabes? After committing this type of crime, justifying it the way they\n      did, they are gang superstars at this point. Other gang members are going\n      to see this. The Norteno gang, once again, is proven as a violent, predatory\n      criminal street gang. And now it is time for you all to send a message to the\n      gang. You won’t tolerate it.\n\n              “This is not just another dead gang member. It‟s not a little trophy\n      for the community. A gang member is dead.

(Gonzales, supra, 87 Cal.App.4th at p. 7.) One of the defendants, Steven,\nchallenged imposition of the enhancement. As initially stated by the Court of Appeal,\nSteven argued the statute violated his right to equal protection “because it treats aiders\nand abettors of gang crimes differently from other aiders and abettors .…” (Id. at p. 12.)\nA short time later, however, the appellate court stated: “Steven argues that an aider and\nabettor of a gang member is similarly situated to aiders and abettors of firearm users who\nare not members of a criminal street gang.” (Id. at p. 13.) We assume the first\nformulation of Steven‟s argument is more accurate than the second one, since\nsection 12022.53, subdivision (e) refers to section 186.22, subdivision (b) — the gang\nenhancement — and section 186.22, subdivision (b) does not require gang membership.\n(People v.

Were we to conclude he made the requisite threshold\nshowing, however, a second level of analysis would be required: “„If the law in question\nimpinges on the exercise of a fundamental right, it is subject to strict scrutiny and will be\nupheld only if it is necessary to further a compelling state interest.

The court concluded the enhancement provided by section 12022.53,\nsubdivision (e)(1) satisfied the rational basis test: “Clearly the Legislature had a rational\nbasis for imposing a 25-years-to-life enhancement on one who aids and abets a gang-\nrelated murder in which the perpetrator uses a gun, regardless of the relationship between\nthe aider and abettor and the perpetrator.

There is language in the Olivas opinion that\n      emphasizes the narrowness of the holding.… This language requires only\n      that the boundaries between the adult and juvenile criminal justice systems\n      be rigorously maintained.

Victim restitution is covered by subdivision (f) et seq. of\nsection 1202.4, different provisions of the statute than govern a restitution fine. The\nstatute treats victim restitution differently from a restitution fine; for example, expressly\naffording a defendant the right to a hearing to dispute determination of the amount of\nrestitution (id., subd. (f)(1)) and permitting enforcement of a restitution order as if it were\na civil judgment (id., subd. (i)).\n        In light of the significant statutory differences between victim restitution and\nrestitution fines, we find it appropriate to apply the general principle that points raised for\nthe first time in a reply brief will not be considered unless good reason is shown for\nfailure to present them earlier.

Analysis\n       Section 1202.4 requires a trial court to order a defendant convicted of a crime to\npay both victim restitution and a restitution fine. (Id., subd. (a)(3)(A), (B).) At all times\nrelevant,53 the statute provided, in pertinent part:\n\n              “(b) In every case where a person is convicted of a crime, the court\n       shall impose a separate and additional restitution fine, unless it finds\n       compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so, and states those\n       reasons on the record.\n\n\n\n53     “It is well established that the imposition of restitution fines constitutes\npunishment, and therefore is subject to the proscriptions of the ex post facto clause and\nother constitutional provisions.

Although section 1202.4 has been amended numerous times over the years, the\nportions with which we are concerned were the same when defendants were sentenced as\nwhen they committed their crime.\n\n\n\n                                              96.\n\f             “(1) The restitution fine shall be set at the discretion of the court and\n       commensurate with the seriousness of the offense, but shall not be less than\n       two hundred dollars ($200), and not more than ten thousand dollars\n       ($10,000) .…\n\n              “(2) In setting a felony restitution fine, the court may determine the\n       amount of the fine as the product of two hundred dollars ($200) multiplied\n       by the number of years of imprisonment the defendant is ordered to serve,\n       multiplied by the number of felony counts of which the defendant is\n       convicted.\n\n               “(c) The court shall impose the restitution fine unless it finds\n       compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so, and states those\n       reasons on the record. A defendant‟s inability to pay shall not be\n       considered a compelling and extraordinary reason not to impose a\n       restitution fine. Inability to pay may be considered only in increasing the\n       amount of the restitution fine in excess of the two hundred-dollar ($200) …\n       minimum .…\n\n              “(d) In setting the amount of the fine … in excess of the two\n       hundred-dollar ($200) … minimum, the court shall consider any relevant\n       factors including, but not limited to, the defendant‟s inability to pay, the\n       seriousness and gravity of the offense and the circumstances of its\n       commission, any economic gain derived by the defendant as a result of the\n       crime, the extent to which any other person suffered any losses as a result\n       of the crime, and the number of victims involved in the crime. Those losses\n       may include pecuniary losses to the victim or his or her dependents as well\n       as intangible losses, such as psychological harm caused by the crime.\n       Consideration of a defendant‟s inability to pay may include his or her future\n       earning capacity. A defendant shall bear the burden of demonstrating his or\n       her inability to pay. Express findings by the court as to the factors bearing\n       on the amount of the fine shall not be required. A separate hearing for the\n       fine shall not be required.”\n       A claim the trial court failed to consider (or adequately consider) ability to pay in\nimposing a restitution fine is forfeited by failure to object at the sentencing hearing.\n(People v.

Gutierrez‟s objection appears to be sufficient: The most reasonable interpretation\nof “no ability to pay whatsoever” (italics added) is that he claimed inability to pay both\ndirect restitution and anything else the court might order, including a restitution fine.\n\n\n\n                                             97.\n\fSaldana, on the other hand, merely stated disagreement with the restitution request. The\nmost reasonable interpretation of Saldana‟s counsel‟s statement is that he was disputing\nthe amount of restitution requested. He did not clarify whether this was due to a\nprofessed inability to pay or because, for example, he felt the claimed amount of loss was\ninaccurate or inflated.\n       In any event, defendants‟ claim fails on the merits. They “point[] to no evidence\nin the record supporting [their] inability to pay, beyond the bare fact of [their] impending\nincarceration. Nor [do they] identify anything in the record indicating the trial court\nbreached its duty to consider [their] ability to pay; as the trial court was not obligated to\nmake express findings concerning [their] ability to pay, the absence of any findings does\nnot demonstrate it failed to consider this factor. Thus, we cannot say on this record that\nthe trial court abused its discretion.” (People v. Gamache, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 409.)\n       People v.

There, after determining the trial\ncourt was not required to make an express finding on the issue of ability to pay, the\nappellate court stated: “Nor need the record in this case contain substantial evidence\nshowing defendant‟s ability to pay the fine. Subdivision (d) of section 1202.4 also\nprovides, „A defendant shall bear the burden of demonstrating lack of his or her ability to\npay.‟ This express statutory command makes sense only if the statute is construed to\ncontain an implied rebuttable presumption, affecting the burden of proof, that a defendant\nhas the ability to pay a restitution fine. Whatever is necessarily implied in a statute is as\nmuch a part of it as that which is expressed. [Citations.] The statute thus impliedly\npresumes a defendant has the ability to pay and expressly places the burden on a\ndefendant to prove lack of ability. Where, as here, a defendant adduces no evidence of\ninability to pay, the trial court should presume ability to pay, as the trial court correctly\ndid here. Since here defendant‟s ability to pay was supplied by the implied presumption,\nthe record need not contain evidence of defendant‟s ability to pay.” (People v.

Defendants misplace the burden for\ninitiating a hearing. Nothing contained in section 1202.4 concerning imposition of\nrestitution fines requires the court to hold a hearing sua sponte.

If defendants had evidence they could have\npresented on the issue, it was incumbent on them to request a hearing.\n       Defendants cite three cases they say stand for the proposition that, “when the court\nimposes a fine in excess of the statutory minimum, a defendant is entitled, upon\nobjection, to a hearing concerning his ability to pay.” (Fn. omitted.)

In Avila, the California Supreme Court rejected the argument that,\nbecause the defendant did not have the ability to pay, a $10,000 fine constituted an\nunauthorized sentence, and so he was not required to bring his claim of inability to pay to\nthe trial court‟s attention. (Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 729.) The high court observed\nthat, because former section 1202.4 mandated imposition of a fine regardless of the\ndefendant‟s present ability to pay, while the then-current restitution statute required a trial\ncourt to consider a defendant‟s inability to pay when imposing a fine greater than the\nstatutory minimum, it had, in other cases, remanded the matter to the trial court for\nreconsideration of the question of a restitution fine under the presently applicable statute.\n(Avila, supra, at pp. 728-729.) Richardson also involved a change in the applicable\nstatute between the time the crime was committed and the defendant was sentenced; the\nhigh court remanded the case to the trial court for reconsideration of the question of a\nrestitution fine under the then-applicable statute, which allowed consideration of ability\nto pay. (Richardson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1038.) Enrique Z. dealt with a version of\nGovernment Code section 13967 (repealed by Stats. 2003, ch. 230, § 2, eff.

We concluded the trial court\nwas required to make an ability-to-pay finding only if it imposed a restitution fine\nexceeding the statutory minimum. (Id. at p. 469.)\n55      Were we to expand defendants‟ claim to encompass the victim restitution order,\nwe would reach the same result. Section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(1) gives a defendant the\nright to a hearing “to dispute the determination of the amount of restitution.” Defendants\ncite no pertinent authority placing on the court the obligation of initiating such a hearing,\non its own motion, merely because a defendant has objected.
