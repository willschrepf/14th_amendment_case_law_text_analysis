The City filed\r\na motion for summary judgment on both traditional and no-evidence grounds, specifically alleging that (1) there was no\r\nevidence to show a waiver of sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act, (2) appellant's claims were barred by\r\nlimitations, (3) appellant's claims were barred by sovereign immunity, and (4) appellant's claims were foreclosed by section\r\n93.01(a)(2) of the Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code, which bars certain actions where the plaintiff's conduct in\r\ncommitting or attempting to commit suicide was the sole cause of the damages alleged.  The trial court granted appellee's\r\nmotion for summary judgment without specifying the basis for its decision.  We reverse and remand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Procedural Background</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The instant suit originated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Brownsville Division.  In\r\nthat court, Martinez brought claims against the City under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Texas Tort Claims Act.  After the\r\nexchange of discovery, the City filed a motion for summary judgment as to all of Martinez's causes of action.  The\r\nmagistrate's report recommended that the City's motion be granted regarding Martinez's federal claims, and that Martinez's\r\nstate law claims be dismissed without prejudice.  According to the magistrate, \"it appears the plaintiff may be able to\r\nrecover\" under the Texas Tort Claims Act based on the act's statutory waiver of immunity for personal injury or death\r\ncaused by a condition or use of tangible personal or real property.  The magistrate's report was adopted by the federal\r\ndistrict judge, and judgment was entered granting the summary judgment on Martinez's federal claims and declining to\r\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction on her state claims, dismissing them without prejudice.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the pendency of the action in federal court, Martinez filed the underlying proceeding under the Texas Tort Claims\r\nAct in state district court. </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Factual Background </p>\r\n\r\n<p>  On January 10, 1996, Reyes, a schizophrenic who was showing signs of erratic behavior,  was arrested and charged with\r\nintoxication by paint.  He was determined to be \"highly\" intoxicated by aerosol paint and \"to be a threat to himself and\r\nothers.\"  He was booked into the Brownsville City Jail at 2:25 a.m. and was placed in a single cell.  The jail staff was\r\nfamiliar with Reyes due to his prior incarcerations, and admittedly knew that the decedent was at risk for suicide.  In fact,\r\nduring some of Reyes's prior incarcerations, the jailers had transferred Reyes to Tropical Texas MHMR for treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the jailers' testimony, the City had three options for incarcerating suicidal inmates.  As one option, suicidal\r\ninmates could be locked in the jail's padded cell, which was monitored \"a lot\" more closely than the other cells and which\r\ndid not contain \"anything for them to kill themselves with.\"  Alternatively, inmates prone to suicide could be locked in a\r\n\"general population\" cell so that the other prisoners could \"watch them while we're busy.\"  As a final option, suicide-prone\r\ninmates could be locked in a single cell.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inmates posing a known risk of suicide were to be kept \"in close observation.\"  All of the jail's cells were subject to varying\r\ndegrees of surveillance by camera and television monitoring.  The padded cell could be seen in its entirety, except for its\r\nceiling, through its television monitor.  In contrast, the cameras for the other cells monitored the jail cell's bars rather than\r\nthe whole cell. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the jail's padded cell was available, the jailers placed Reyes in a single regular cell, rather than the padded cell or\r\nin a communal cell with other prisoners.  The jailers were admittedly aware that the jail cell bars on the single cells could\r\nbe used by suicidal inmates to hang themselves.  According to Bryan Castro, one of the two detention officers on duty at\r\nthe time of Reyes' suicide, \"Anybody could hang themselves anywhere on those bars.\"  According to Eliborio Rios, the jail\r\nadministrator, \"The cameras in the cell areas are mainly there so that we can see the bars, where most of the problems seem\r\nto happen or where the problems would seem to happen, foreseeing something like this.\"   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the jail staff had received training and instruction that inmates could use items of clothing to hang themselves, the\r\nstaff failed to issue Reyes rip-away paper garments.  When admitting prisoners who are a suicide risk, the jailers remove\r\nthe inmate's shoelaces and belt, and issue a blue paper suit to the inmate.  According to Maria Garcia, the other detention\r\nofficer on duty at the time of the suicide, \"If it comes down to take off their clothing, we go ahead and take off - remove\r\ntheir clothing, give them blue suits.\"  The blue paper garments were kept in the jail and were easily accessible to the jailers.\r\nNevertheless, the City incarcerated Reyes without replacing his own clothing with paper garments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following day, Reyes, showing clear signs of disturbed behavior, repeatedly asked the jail staff for his psychiatric\r\nmedication.  At approximately 2:00 p.m., Ricardo Vargas, the decedent's case manager from Tropical Texas MHMR, called\r\nthe jail and notified the staff that he was bringing the decedent's psychiatric prescription medicines to the jail.  He delivered\r\nthe medicines Haldol, Zoloft, Buspar, and Ativan at about 3:00 p.m., and told the staff that Reyes needed his medication,\r\nand that it was important that he receive it.  According to Vargas, Reyes was \"apprehensive\" and \"scared\" if he did not have\r\nhis medication, that \"He was afraid he was going to get - something was going to happen to him.\"  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The jail staff did not administer the drugs to Reyes.  At around 6:50 p.m., the jail staff found the decedent had hung himself\r\nwith his shirt from the bars on his cell door.  Although Reyes's cell was subject to surveillance by camera and television\r\nmonitoring, the jail staff failed to see Reyes in the act of committing suicide.  According to Castro and Garcia, the camera\r\nmonitoring Reyes's cell did not cover the area on the bars where Reyes hung himself.  In fact, Garcia testified that she could\r\nnot see Reyes via monitor even after being told that he had hung himself.  However, according to Rios, the camera covered\r\nthe area where Reyes hung himself, and according to his investigation, Castro and Garcia failed to see Reyes because \"they\r\nwere busy doing other functions in the jail.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">No Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The City based its motion for summary judgment on both traditional and no evidence grounds.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(b),\r\n(i).  Specifically, the City argued that  under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i), there was no evidence to show a waiver\r\nof sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i), the City could only bring a no-evidence motion for summary judgment on a\r\nclaim or defense on which Martinez would have the burden of proof at trial.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i).  Governmental\r\nimmunity is an affirmative defense on which the City would have had the burden of proof at trial.  <em>See Davis v. City of San\r\nAntonio</em>, 752 S.W.2d 518, 519-20 (Tex. 1988); <em>Battin v. Samaniego</em>, 23 S.W.3d 183, 185-86 (Tex. App.-El Paso 2000, pet.\r\ndenied).  Therefore, to the extent that the trial court's summary judgment may have been based on the City's argument there\r\nwas no evidence to show a waiver of sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act, it was error.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the City's argument that Martinez has \"no evidence sufficient to show a waiver of sovereign immunity\" - is\r\ninsufficient as a matter of law to raise any duty to respond under rule 166a(i) because this is nothing more than a prohibited\r\n\"conclusory\" motion or \"general\" no-evidence challenge.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a cmt.  On its face, this rule 166a(i) challenge\r\nfails to meet the requirement that \"the motion must be specific in challenging the evidentiary support for an element of a\r\nclaim.\"  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see Michael v. Dyke</em>, 41 S.W.3d 746, 751 n.3 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2001, no pet.)(requiring strict\r\nconstruction of no evidence motions for summary judgment).  Accordingly, the City's no evidence motion did not meet the\r\nrequirements of rule 166a(i) and the trial court could not have appropriately granted summary judgment on that ground.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the traditional standard for summary judgment, the City again argued that appellant's claims were barred by\r\nsovereign immunity, and further argued that appellant's claims were barred by the statute of limitations and foreclosed by\r\nsection 93.01(a)(2) of the civil practice and remedies code.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a summary judgment, the movant has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.  <em>American Tobacco Co., v. Grinnell</em>, 951 S.W.2d 420, 425 (Tex. 1997).  In deciding\r\nwhether there is a disputed material fact issue precluding summary judgment, evidence favorable to the nonmovant will be\r\ntaken as true.  <em>Id.</em>  Every reasonable inference must be indulged in favor of the nonmovant, and any doubts must be\r\nresolved in favor of the nonmovant.  <em>Id.  </em>When a defendant moves for summary judgment on its affirmative defense, it\r\nmust prove each element of its defense as a matter of law, leaving no issues of material fact.  <em>Lear Siegler, Inc. v. Perez</em>,\r\n819 S.W.2d 470, 471 (Tex. 1991), <em>see, e.g.,City of Lancaster v. Chambers</em>, 883 S.W.2d 650, 653 (Tex. 1994)(official\r\nimmunity).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the trial court's order granting the City's  motion for summary judgment does not specify the grounds for its ruling,\r\nthe summary judgment will be upheld if any of the theories advanced by the City are meritorious.  <em>See Bradley v.</em>State, 990\r\nS.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 1999); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. S.S. &amp; G.W.</em>, 858 S.W.2d 374, 380 (Tex. 1993).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Statute of Limitations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the City's motion for summary judgment, Martinez's claims are barred by the applicable two-year statute of\r\nlimitations for personal injury or death.  The incident made the basis of this lawsuit occurred on January 10, 1996. Martinez\r\noriginally brought suit in federal court on or about November 26, 1997.  While this federal action was pending, Martinez\r\nfiled an action in state district court on October 8, 1999.  The federal court action was dismissed on November 3, 1999,\r\nwith the federal court declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Martinez's state law claims.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martinez contends that the statute of limitations was tolled by section 16.064 of the civil practice and remedies code.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง 16.064 (Vernon 1997).  Section 16.064 provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(a) The period between the date of filing an action in a trial court and the date of a second filing of the same action in a\r\ndifferent court suspends the running of the applicable statute of limitations for the period if:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1) because of lack of jurisdiction in the trial court where the action was first filed, the action is dismissed or the judgment\r\nis set aside or annulled in a direct proceeding; and <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) not later than the 60th day after the date the dismissal or other disposition becomes final, the action is commenced in a\r\ncourt of proper jurisdiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง 16.064 (Vernon 1997).  For purposes of the applicability of this section, a federal\r\ncourt's refusal to exercise jurisdiction over a pendent state claim is tantamount to a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.  <em>Vale\r\nv. Ryan</em>, 809 S.W.2d 324, 327 (Tex. App.--Austin 1991, no writ).  Therefore, under the statute, appellant's suit was tolled\r\nfrom November 26, 1997, the date that she originally filed suit in federal court, until October 8, 1999, the date that she filed\r\nsuit in state district court.  We conclude that Martinez's suit was not barred by limitations, thus, the City's motion for\r\nsummary judgment would not have been appropriately granted on this ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Affirmative Defense of Suicide<em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The City next contends that summary judgment was proper under section 93.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\r\nCode.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง 93.001 (Vernon Supp. 2001).<sup> (1)</sup>  This section of the code provides that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(a) It is an affirmative defense to a civil action for damages for personal injury or death that the plaintiff, at the time the\r\ncause of action arose, was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) committing or attempting to commit suicide, and the plaintiff's conduct in committing or attempting to commit suicide\r\nwas the sole cause of the damages sustained; provided, however, if the suicide or attempted suicide was caused in whole or\r\nin part by a failure on the part of any defendant to comply with an applicable legal standard, then such suicide or attempted\r\nsuicide shall not be a defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(c) In an action to which this section applies, this section shall prevail over any other law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง 93.001 (Vernon Supp. 2001). The City had no defense under this section if it failed to\r\ncomply with the applicable standard of care, and this failure was a cause of Reyes's suicide.  <em>Id.; see Kassen v. Hatley</em>, 887\r\nS.W.2d 4, 13 (Tex. 1994). The jailers admitted that they had specific duties and responsibilities to inmates who posed a risk\r\nof suicide.  Martinez has presented uncontradicted evidence that the jailers knew that Reyes was a suicide risk, and knew\r\nthat suicidal inmates could use their clothing to hang themselves from the bars of their jail cells.  Reyes in fact hung\r\nhimself with his clothing from the bars of his cell.  The jailers failed to place Reyes in a padded cell, failed to issue\r\nsuicide-proof clothing, failed to monitor him, and failed to institute the jail's procedures to ensure Reyes received his\r\nmedication. This evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact on whether the City met the applicable legal standard of\r\ncare. Therefore, summary judgment on this ground would be improper.  <em>Kassen</em>, 887 S.W.2d at 13 (citing<em>  Evans v. City of\r\nMarlin</em>, 986 F.2d 104, 109 (5th Cir. 1993)).</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Sovereign Immunity</p>\r\n\r\n<p>   The City also argued that Martinez's claims were barred by sovereign immunity.  A governmental unit is immune from\r\ntort liability unless the legislature has waived immunity.  <em>See Harris County v. Dillard, </em>883 S.W.2d 166, 168 (Tex. 1994).\r\nExceptions to sovereign immunity are generally dependent entirely upon statute.  <em>See Dallas County MHMR v. Bossley</em>, 968\r\nS.W.2d 339, 341 (Tex. 1998).  Section 101.021(2) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides a limited\r\nwaiver of sovereign immunity: a governmental unit in the state is liable for personal injury and death caused by a condition\r\nor use of tangible personal or real property if the governmental unit would, were it a private person, be liable to the\r\nclaimant according to Texas law. <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง101.021(2) (Vernon 1997).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To state an actionable complaint under the act, the personal injury or death must be proximately caused by the condition or\r\nuse of tangible property.  <em>Dallas County MHMR</em>, 968 S.W.2d at 341-42. \"Property does not cause injury if it does no more\r\nthan furnish the condition that makes the injury possible.\"  <em>Id. </em>at 343 (citing <em>Union Pump Co. v. Allbritton</em>, 898 S.W.2d\r\n773, 775 (Tex. 1995)).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under section 101.021(2), the State can waive immunity if it provides property that lacks an integral safety component, and\r\nthe lack of this integral component led to plaintiff's injuries.  <em>Kerrville State Hosp. v. Clark</em>, 923 S.W.2d 582, 585 (Tex.\r\n1996); <em>see, e.g., Robinson v. Central Texas MHMR Ctr.</em>, 780 S.W.2d 169, 171 (Tex. 1989)(state liable for employee's\r\nprovision of swimming attire that did not include life preserver); <em>Lowe v. Texas Tech. Univ</em>, 540 S.W.2d 297, 300 (Tex.\r\n1976)(university liable for providing uniform without knee pad to football player); <em>Overton  Mem'l  Hosp. v. McGuire</em>, 518\r\nS.W.2d 528, 529 (Tex. 1975)(hospital liable for providing hospital bed without side rails); <em>Texas Dept. of MHMR v.\r\nMcClain</em>, 947 S.W.2d 694, 697 (Tex. App.-Austin 1997, writ denied)(department liable for providing lockers with\r\nremovable metal rods and wheelchairs with removable pedals). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Tort Claims Act and case law have distinguished claims involving the failure to use property, which do not\r\nwaive sovereign immunity, from claims involving a condition or use of tangible personal property that causes injury, which\r\ndo effect a waiver.  <em>Texas Dep't of Criminal Justice v. Miller</em>, 44 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 963, ___, 2001 Tex. LEXIS 66, *9 (June\r\n21, 2001).  \"Use\" means \"to put or bring into action or service; to employ for or apply to a given purpose.\"  <em>Texas Natural\r\nRes. &amp; Conservation Comm'n v. White</em>, 46 S.W.3d 864, 869 (Tex. 2001).  Use of the property must have actually caused\r\ninjury.  <em>Miller</em>, 2001 Tex. LEXIS *11 (misuse of medication masked symptoms of meningitis but did not cause death).    </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the Tort Claims Act, if a claim arises from a \"premise defect,\" the governmental unit owes to the claimant only the\r\nduty that a private person owes to a licensee on private property, unless the claimant pays for the use of the premises.  Tex.\r\nCiv. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง101.022 (a) (Vernon 1997); <em>see Tex. Dept. of Transp. v. Able</em>, 35 S.W.2d 608, 612 (Tex.\r\n2000).  That duty requires that a landowner not injure a licensee by willful, wanton or grossly neglectful conduct.  <em>State\r\nDept. of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp. v. Payne</em>, 838 S.W.2d 235, 237 (Tex. 1992) (op. on reh'g).  Absent allegations of\r\nwillful, wanton, or grossly negligent conduct, a licensee must prove that (1) a condition of the premises created an\r\nunreasonable risk of harm to the licensee, (2) the owner actually knew of the condition, (3) the licensee did not know of the\r\ncondition, (4) the owner failed to exercise ordinary care to protect the licensee from danger, and (5) the owner's failure was\r\na proximate cause of injury to the licensee.  <em>Id.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its motion for summary judgment, the City makes three arguments that Martinez's claims are barred by sovereign\r\nimmunity.<sup> (2)</sup>  First, the City argues that the negligent use of government property by someone other than a government\r\nemployee does not give rise to a waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act, and that Reyes's death was caused by\r\nReyes's use of the cell door rather than a City employee's use of the cell door.  Second, the City argues that because the cell\r\ndoor is an appurtenance of a premises, Martinez's claim is for a premises defect, and is thus exclusively governed by\r\nsection 101.022 of the Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง101.022 (Vernon\r\n1997).  Third, the City argues that Martinez cannot recover for the City's negligent formulation of policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response, Martinez alleged that (1) Reyes's death was caused by a  condition or use of tangible personal or real property,\r\n(2) the City provided property lacking an integral safety component and the lack of the component led to Reyes's death, and\r\n(3) Reyes's death was caused by the negligent implementation of formulated policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Use of Tangible Property</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We first address the City's argument that Reyes's suicide was caused by Reyes's use of the cell door rather than a City\r\nemployee's use of tangible real or personal property.  According to the City, the \"only use any City employee arguably made\r\nof the cell door in question was to close Plaintiff in a cell behind it: such does not constitute a negligent use of the cell door,\r\nas that is exactly what a cell door is supposed to be used for.\"  Citing <em>LeLeaux v. Hamshire-Fannett Ind. Sch. Dist.</em>, 835\r\nS.W.2d 49 (Tex. 1992), the City thus argues that the negligent use of government property by someone other than a\r\ngovernment employee does not give rise to a waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act,.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to the City's argument, Martinez's pleadings and response allege that the City misused tangible property.  More\r\nspecifically, Martinez alleges that, contrary to its own policies, the City furnished Reyes a regular cell without furnishing\r\nhim the rip away garments necessary to render Reyes's use of the cell safe.  Martinez's response to the City's motion for\r\nsummary judgment specifically provides that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cell door at the Brownsville City Jail was directly used in [Reyes's] suicide and thus proximately caused his death. The\r\njailers had received on the job training as to what articles of clothing inmates could use to hang themselves using the\r\ntangible property of the cell door in jails and as such, the jailers were under instructions to issue blue paper garments to\r\ninmates that might be suicidal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe summary judgment evidence adduced by Martinez substantiates these allegations.  Moreover, many of the acts giving\r\nrise to liability under the Tort Claims Act involve some nexus between the injured party's \"use\" of the tangible property and\r\nthe governmental employee's use of the property.  This  nexus appears in the context of property lacking a safety\r\ncomponent, for example, as when a patient uses a bed without side rails, <em>see, e.g., Overton Mem'l Hosp.</em>, 518 S.W.2d 528,\r\nor a football player uses a uniform without a kneepad, <em>see, e.g., Lowe</em>, 540 S.W.2d at 300. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, even if we were to focus solely on Martinez's allegations concerning the jail cell, in isolation, without considering\r\nthe jail's failure to furnish paper garments, this Court has held that governmental employees can \"use\" a room for purposes\r\nof the Tort Claims Act.  <em>See Vela v. City of McAllen</em>, 894 S.W.2d 836, 840 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 1995, no\r\nwrit)(officer's negligent use of booking room at jail caused injury to epileptic inmate); <em>see also Waco v. Hester</em>, 805 S.W.2d\r\n807, 814-15 (Tex. App.-Waco 1990, writ denied)(jail's failure to segregate inmate contrary to policy caused injury to\r\nanother); <em>but see Laman v. Big Spring State Hosp.</em>, 970 S.W.2d 670, 671-72 (Tex. App.-Eastland 1998, pet. denied)(claims\r\nconcerning use of a room alleged premises defect). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We must also reject the City's argument that the instant case is analogous to <em>Dallas County MHMR v. Bossley</em>, 968 S.W.2d\r\n339 (Tex. 1998).  In <em>Bossley</em>, a mental patient who had previously attempted to take his own life escaped from a county\r\nmental health facility through an unlocked door.  During the subsequent pursuit by employees of the facility and the police,\r\nthe patient leaped into the path of a truck and was killed.  The patient's family brought suit against the facility alleging that\r\ntheir son's death was caused by an employee of the facility unlocking the outer door of the facility without first ensuring\r\nthat the inner doors were locked.  The family therefore claimed that their son's death came within the statutory waiver of\r\nimmunity under section 101.021(2) of the Tort Claims Act as a \"use or condition\" of tangible property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>   The court of appeals agreed with the patient's family, but the Texas Supreme Court reversed the intermediate court on\r\ngrounds that causation requires more than the mere involvement of tangible personal or real property.  <em>Id.</em> at 343.\r\nAccording to the supreme court, property does not cause injury if it does no more than furnish the condition that makes the\r\ninjury possible.  <em>Id.</em>  Although the patient's escape through the unlocked doors was part of a sequence of events that ended\r\nin his suicide, the use and condition of the doors were too distant geographically, temporally, and causally from the patient's\r\ndeath to have caused the death.  <em>Id.</em>  Furthermore, the court pointed out that the real substance of the plaintiffs' complaint\r\nwas that the patient's death was caused not by the condition or use of property, but by the failure of the county mental\r\nhospital staff to restrain the patient once they learned he was suicidal.  <em>Id.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Bossley </em> is distinguishable from the instant case on several grounds.  As an initial matter, Martinez's pleadings and evidence\r\nconcern the City's provision of property lacking a safety component and the City's negligent implementation of policy;\r\nneither argument was made in <em>Bossley</em>.  Not only did the staff fail to restrain Reyes from committing suicide, but by placing\r\nReyes in a regular cell with his clothing, the staff actually furnished the means for him to commit suicide.  Further,\r\ncausation in the instant case is direct: the decedent hung himself on his jail door, thus providing a close causal nexus both\r\ngeographically and temporally.  In fact, the City's own motion for summary judgment recites that \"it was Plaintiff's use of\r\nhis shirt and of the cell door that proximately caused his injuries.\" </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Characterization of Claims</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the City argues that because the cell door is an appurtenance of a premises, Reyes's claim is in the nature of a\r\npremises defect, and is thus exclusively governed by section 101.022 of the Tort Claims Act concerning premises liability\r\nclaims.  According to the City, Martinez neither pleaded nor proved that (1) a condition of the premises created an\r\nunreasonable risk of harm to the licensee; (2) the owner actually knew of the condition; (3) the licensee did not know of the\r\ncondition; (4) the owner failed to exercise ordinary care to protect the licensee from danger; (5) the owner's failure was a\r\nproximate cause of injury to the licensee.  <em>See Payne</em>, 838 S.W.2d at 237.  The City notes that these \"elements of proof\r\nwere not pleaded in any form, perhaps because they make absolutely no sense in the context of Plaintiff's allegations.\"   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an initial matter, we disagree with the City's position that Martinez has failed to plead a cause of action for premises\r\nliability.  A licensee need only prove the foregoing allegations absent allegations of wilful, wanton, or grossly negligent\r\nconduct, and Martinez has clearly pleaded wilful, wanton, and grossly negligent conduct on the part of the City.  <em>See id.\r\n</em>Moreover, the testimony discussed above represents more than a scintilla of evidence supporting these claims.  Thus, even\r\nif we were to construe Martinez's claims as sounding in premises liability, Martinez has established a waiver of immunity\r\nunder section 101.022, and the motion for summary judgment was improvidently granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, more fundamentally, we disagree with the City's characterization of this action as a premises liability claim under\r\nsection 101.022. In a premises defect case, liability is based on the duty of care owed by the governmental unit to the\r\nclaimant for premise and special defects under section 101.022.  <em>Texas Dept. of Transp. v. Able</em>, 35 S.W.3d 608, 612 (Tex.\r\n2000); <em>DeWitt v. Harris County</em>, 904 S.W.2d 650, 653 (Tex. 1995).  In contrast, for a claim under section 101.021, liability\r\nis based on the actions of the governmental unit's employees.  <em>See Able</em>, 35 S.W.3d at 612.  In the instant case, Martinez's\r\nallegations are based on the actions of the jail's employees in furnishing Reyes a cell without padding and without paper\r\ngarments and in failing to follow its own policies regarding the treatment of suicidal inmates.  Martinez alleges that the use\r\nor condition of a jail cell with bars instead of a padded cell when used in conjunction with the lack of anti-suicide clothing\r\nwas a substantial factor in bringing about Reyes's death.  Martinez's claim does not merely relate to the bars on the jail cell,\r\nnor is her complaint that the jail cell was defective in some manner as would be the case were this a premises defect claim.\r\n<em>Cf. Laman</em>, 970 S.W.2d at 627 (no cause of action for premises defect where no defect, shortcoming, or imperfection in\r\nroom or door)(citing <em>Billstrom v. Memorial Med. Ctr.</em>, 598 S.W.2d 642, 646 (Tex. Civ. App. -Corpus Christi 1980, no\r\nwrit).  Rather, Martinez's complaint is that, contrary to jail policy and procedure, Reyes was furnished a cell without being\r\nissued the paper garments necessary to make his use of the cell safe. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This case can most clearly be understood in relation to <em>Robinson v. Cent. Texas MHMR Ctr.</em>, 780 S.W.2d 169 (Tex. 1989).\r\nIn <em>Robinson</em>, the State was held liable for the drowning death of a state school patient when it provided the patient with\r\nswimming attire that did not include a life preserver, and the patient  drowned.  The MHMR employees knew that the\r\npatient suffered from epilepsy that occasionally caused him to lose consciousness.  Although the employees had life\r\npreservers available, they failed to issue one to the patient.  According to the Texas Supreme Court, the MHMR employees\r\nwere responsible for seeing that those for whom they cared were dressed in proper swimming attire, and a life preserver\r\nwas part of the patient's swimming attire. <em>Id.</em> at 171.    </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, in the instant case, the jailers were responsible for placement of suicide risks in particular cells, and were\r\nresponsible for ensuring that the clothing worn by suicide risks was safe.  The jailers removed belts and shoelaces, and\r\nissued blue paper suits.  The jailers knew that Martinez was a suicide risk, and knew, on the day of the incident, that he was\r\nagitated and asking for his medication.  They knew that the jail bars on regular cells could be used by suicide risks to hang\r\nthemselves, and they knew that inmates could use their clothing to hang themselves.  They had the option of placing\r\nMartinez in a padded cell or issuing him paper tear away garments, yet failed to do either.  Martinez in fact hung himself\r\nfrom the jail bars by his clothing.  Although we concur with other courts that the distinction between non-use and the\r\nfailure to provide something with safety components is difficult to draw, we conclude that the instant case implicates more\r\nthan the mere non-use of the paper garments.  <em>See Miller</em>, 2000 Tex. LEXIS at *14 (Hecht, J. concurring)(discussing\r\ndifficulty of applying \"use\" of property standard under the Tort Claims Act).</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Formulation or Implementation of Policy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>  Third, the City argues that the decedent's death was caused by the negligent formulation of policy.  With regard to\r\ngovernmental liability for policy decisions, sovereign immunity is preserved for the negligent formulation of policy, but\r\nwaived for the negligent implementation of policy.  <em>City of Brownsville v. Alvarado</em>, 897 S.W.2d 750, 754 (Tex.\r\n1995);<em>State v. Terrell</em>, 588 S.W.2d 784, 787-88 (Tex. 1979); <em>see City of San Augustine v. Parrish</em>, 10 S.W.3d 734 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Tyler 1999, pet. dism'd w.o.j.)(negligent implementation of governmental policy in undertaking training, but failing to\r\nadequately train and supervise); <em>City of Waco v. Hester</em>, 805 S.W.2d 807, 812-13 (Tex. App.-Waco 1990, writ\r\ndenied)(failing to follow city policy regarding segregation of certain inmates related to policy implementation by\r\njailers);<em>Forbus v. City of Denton</em>, 595 S.W.2d 621, 623 (Tex. Civ. App.-Fort Worth 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.)(deciding type of\r\nmattress to provide to prisoners related to policy implementation).  We agree with the City that, to the extent that\r\nMartinez's claims relate to the formulation of policy rather than the implementation of policy, her claims must fail. Second,\r\nto the extent that she is generally claiming that the City failed to furnish proper training and instruction to its employees,\r\nthis claim will also fail.  <em>See Texas Dept. of Public Safety v. Petta</em>, 44 S.W.3d 575, 580 (Tex. 2001)(negligent training\r\nclaim did not involve requisite tangible personal property).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, plaintiff's petition and response clearly raise fact issues regarding the City's negligent implementation of policy\r\nregarding the use or misuse of tangible property.  As discussed above, the jailers failed to follow the jail's policy regarding\r\nthe provision of paper garments to Reyes.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the jailers had a policy of closely monitoring suicidal inmates.  We agree that under many circumstances the\r\njailers' failure to monitor could be considered a discretionary function and therefore not actionable under the Tort Claims\r\nAct.  <em>See  e.g., City of Coppell v. Waltman</em>, 997 S.W.2d 633, 637 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1998, no pet.).  In this case, however,\r\nthe conflicting deposition testimony raises the issue that the physical focus of the camera covering Reyes's cell was\r\ndeficient.  As noted previously, Castro and Garcia testified that the camera monitoring Reyes's cell did not cover the area\r\non the bars where he hung himself.  Garcia even testified that she could not see Reyes via monitor even after being told that\r\nhe had hung himself.  However, according to Rios, the camera covered the area where Reyes hung himself, and according\r\nto his investigation, Castro and Garcia failed to see Reyes because \"they were busy doing other functions in the jail.\"  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, Martinez's petition and response show that the jailers failed to follow their own policy regarding the provision of\r\nmedicine to Reyes.  With regard to the provision of medications, the law is clear that the failure to provide medication or\r\nthe failure to provide appropriate medication is not actionable under the tort claims act.  <em>See Kerrville State Hosp. v. Clark</em>,\r\n923 S.W.2d 582, 585 (Tex. 1996)(failure to provide specific form of medication not actionable); <em>Kassen v. Hatley</em>, 887\r\nS.W.2d 4, 14 (Tex. 1994)(failure to provide medication constituted nonuse).  However, Martinez's petition recites that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The City of Brownsville, Texas, knew decedent Roberto Martinez Reyes as having psychiatric problems which required\r\nprescription medicine for control.  While in the custody of the City of Brownsville, Roberto Martinez Reyes exhibited\r\nobvious signs and behavior of mental illness.  During Roberto Martinez Reyes' incarceration the City of Brownsville not\r\nonly failed to provide Roberto Martinez Reyes with his required medication, but also refused to administer the requisite\r\nmedication when it was brought to the jail for Roberto Martinez Reyes.  As a result of such acts, Roberto Martinez Reyes\r\ndied while in the custody of the City of Brownsville . . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, the petition argues that the City was negligent in failing to \"implement and/or use proper procedures for a\r\nreferral to mental health and/or medical personnel.\"  Maria Garcia testified regarding the jail's procedures in administering\r\nmedication to inmates.  Before medication can be dispensed to an inmate, the jailers call an officer to transport the inmate\r\nto the hospital for review and approval of administration of the medication.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, the record evidence shows that the jailers were aware that Martinez required medication from their experience\r\nwith him during his prior incarcerations, and were similarly aware that Martinez posed a risk of suicide.  Castro was aware\r\nthat Martinez had been asking for his medication since the evening before he began his shift at approximately 2:30 p.m.\r\nMartinez continued to repeatedly asked the jailers for his medication during the day, and showed obvious signs of erratic\r\nbehavior.  Vargas sais that Martinez was apprehensive and scared if he didn't have his medication, and that he was afraid\r\nsomething was going to happen to him.   Vargas testified that he delivered the medication at approximately 3:00 p.m. that\r\nday, and told the jailers that it was important for Martinez to take the medication.  Nevertheless, the undisputed evidence\r\nshows that the jailers failed to institute the jail's procedure to enable Martinez to take his medication because they were too\r\nbusy with other duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>  In order for the City to be entitled to summary judgment, it must have established the affirmative defense of sovereign\r\nimmunity as a matter of law.  <em>Amer. Tobacco</em>, 951 S.W.2d at 425.  In order to determine if the trial court erred in granting\r\nthe City's motion for summary judgment, we must consider the summary judgment evidence in the light most favorable to\r\nMartinez, indulging all reasonable inferences in her favor.  <em>See id.  </em>We must further bear in mind that summary judgment\r\nwas intended to be a procedure to allow summary dismissal of \"patently unmeritorious claims or untenable defenses.\"  <em>See\r\nGulbenkian v. Penn</em>, 252 S.W.2d 929, 931 (Tex. 1952).   After reviewing the summary judgment evidence, we cannot\r\nconclude that this is such a case.  A governmental unit in the state is liable for personal injury and death caused by a\r\ncondition or use of tangible personal or real property if the governmental unit would, were it a private person, be liable to\r\nthe claimant according to Texas law. <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง101.021(2) (Vernon 1997).  Considering the\r\nsummary judgment evidence in the light most favorable to Martinez and indulging all reasonable inferences in her favor,\r\nMartinez produced evidence that Reyes's death was proximately caused by the City's use of tangible property.  The City\r\nfurnished Reyes property lacking an integral safety component, and the lack of the safety component resulted in Reyes's\r\ndeath.  Specifically, the City utilized a regular cell to incarcerate Reyes, a known suicide risk,  without replacing his\r\nclothing with paper garments.  The City did so despite full awareness that Reyes could hang himself on the cell's bars with\r\nhis clothes.  Under the facts of this case, a barred cell could not be used to safely incarcerate Reyes without paper garments.\r\nFurther, as discussed herein, Martinez produced evidence that the City negligently failed to implement its policies regarding\r\nthe use of tangible property, specifically, the provision of paper garments to inmates posing a risk of suicide, the use of\r\ncameras and monitors to observe suicidal prisoners, and the procedures for dispensing medicines to inmates.  In conclusion,\r\nthe City failed to establish that Martinez's suit was barred by sovereign immunity as a matter of law, and summary\r\njudgment would be improperly granted on this ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have examined each of the theories underlying the City's motion for summary judgment, and have found that none of\r\nthe theories advanced by the City are meritorious.  <em>See Bradley</em>, 990 S.W.2d at 247.  Accordingly, the summary judgment\r\nin favor of the City is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                         </p>\r\n\r\n<p>ROGELIO VALDEZ</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief Justice</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo not publish .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tex.

On appeal, the City raises additional grounds for summary judgment; however, a motion for summary judgment must\r\nexpressly present the grounds upon which it is made, and it must stand or fall on these grounds alone.  <em>See</em> Tex.

The City filed\r\na motion for summary judgment on both traditional and no-evidence grounds, specifically alleging that (1) there was no\r\nevidence to show a waiver of sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act, (2) appellant's claims were barred by\r\nlimitations, (3) appellant's claims were barred by sovereign immunity, and (4) appellant's claims were foreclosed by section\r\n93.01(a)(2) of the Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code, which bars certain actions where the plaintiff's conduct in\r\ncommitting or attempting to commit suicide was the sole cause of the damages alleged.  The trial court granted appellee's\r\nmotion for summary judgment without specifying the basis for its decision.  We reverse and remand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Procedural Background</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The instant suit originated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Brownsville Division.  In\r\nthat court, Martinez brought claims against the City under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Texas Tort Claims Act.  After the\r\nexchange of discovery, the City filed a motion for summary judgment as to all of Martinez's causes of action.  The\r\nmagistrate's report recommended that the City's motion be granted regarding Martinez's federal claims, and that Martinez's\r\nstate law claims be dismissed without prejudice.  According to the magistrate, \"it appears the plaintiff may be able to\r\nrecover\" under the Texas Tort Claims Act based on the act's statutory waiver of immunity for personal injury or death\r\ncaused by a condition or use of tangible personal or real property.  The magistrate's report was adopted by the federal\r\ndistrict judge, and judgment was entered granting the summary judgment on Martinez's federal claims and declining to\r\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction on her state claims, dismissing them without prejudice.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the pendency of the action in federal court, Martinez filed the underlying proceeding under the Texas Tort Claims\r\nAct in state district court. </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Factual Background </p>\r\n\r\n<p>  On January 10, 1996, Reyes, a schizophrenic who was showing signs of erratic behavior,  was arrested and charged with\r\nintoxication by paint.  He was determined to be \"highly\" intoxicated by aerosol paint and \"to be a threat to himself and\r\nothers.\"  He was booked into the Brownsville City Jail at 2:25 a.m. and was placed in a single cell.  The jail staff was\r\nfamiliar with Reyes due to his prior incarcerations, and admittedly knew that the decedent was at risk for suicide.  In fact,\r\nduring some of Reyes's prior incarcerations, the jailers had transferred Reyes to Tropical Texas MHMR for treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the jailers' testimony, the City had three options for incarcerating suicidal inmates.  As one option, suicidal\r\ninmates could be locked in the jail's padded cell, which was monitored \"a lot\" more closely than the other cells and which\r\ndid not contain \"anything for them to kill themselves with.\"  Alternatively, inmates prone to suicide could be locked in a\r\n\"general population\" cell so that the other prisoners could \"watch them while we're busy.\"  As a final option, suicide-prone\r\ninmates could be locked in a single cell.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inmates posing a known risk of suicide were to be kept \"in close observation.\"  All of the jail's cells were subject to varying\r\ndegrees of surveillance by camera and television monitoring.  The padded cell could be seen in its entirety, except for its\r\nceiling, through its television monitor.  In contrast, the cameras for the other cells monitored the jail cell's bars rather than\r\nthe whole cell. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the jail's padded cell was available, the jailers placed Reyes in a single regular cell, rather than the padded cell or\r\nin a communal cell with other prisoners.  The jailers were admittedly aware that the jail cell bars on the single cells could\r\nbe used by suicidal inmates to hang themselves.  According to Bryan Castro, one of the two detention officers on duty at\r\nthe time of Reyes' suicide, \"Anybody could hang themselves anywhere on those bars.\"  According to Eliborio Rios, the jail\r\nadministrator, \"The cameras in the cell areas are mainly there so that we can see the bars, where most of the problems seem\r\nto happen or where the problems would seem to happen, foreseeing something like this.\"   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the jail staff had received training and instruction that inmates could use items of clothing to hang themselves, the\r\nstaff failed to issue Reyes rip-away paper garments.  When admitting prisoners who are a suicide risk, the jailers remove\r\nthe inmate's shoelaces and belt, and issue a blue paper suit to the inmate.  According to Maria Garcia, the other detention\r\nofficer on duty at the time of the suicide, \"If it comes down to take off their clothing, we go ahead and take off - remove\r\ntheir clothing, give them blue suits.\"  The blue paper garments were kept in the jail and were easily accessible to the jailers.\r\nNevertheless, the City incarcerated Reyes without replacing his own clothing with paper garments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following day, Reyes, showing clear signs of disturbed behavior, repeatedly asked the jail staff for his psychiatric\r\nmedication.  At approximately 2:00 p.m., Ricardo Vargas, the decedent's case manager from Tropical Texas MHMR, called\r\nthe jail and notified the staff that he was bringing the decedent's psychiatric prescription medicines to the jail.  He delivered\r\nthe medicines Haldol, Zoloft, Buspar, and Ativan at about 3:00 p.m., and told the staff that Reyes needed his medication,\r\nand that it was important that he receive it.  According to Vargas, Reyes was \"apprehensive\" and \"scared\" if he did not have\r\nhis medication, that \"He was afraid he was going to get - something was going to happen to him.\"  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The jail staff did not administer the drugs to Reyes.  At around 6:50 p.m., the jail staff found the decedent had hung himself\r\nwith his shirt from the bars on his cell door.  Although Reyes's cell was subject to surveillance by camera and television\r\nmonitoring, the jail staff failed to see Reyes in the act of committing suicide.  According to Castro and Garcia, the camera\r\nmonitoring Reyes's cell did not cover the area on the bars where Reyes hung himself.  In fact, Garcia testified that she could\r\nnot see Reyes via monitor even after being told that he had hung himself.  However, according to Rios, the camera covered\r\nthe area where Reyes hung himself, and according to his investigation, Castro and Garcia failed to see Reyes because \"they\r\nwere busy doing other functions in the jail.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">No Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The City based its motion for summary judgment on both traditional and no evidence grounds.  <em>See</em> Tex.

Specifically, the City argued that  under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i), there was no evidence to show a waiver\r\nof sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i), the City could only bring a no-evidence motion for summary judgment on a\r\nclaim or defense on which Martinez would have the burden of proof at trial.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i).  Governmental\r\nimmunity is an affirmative defense on which the City would have had the burden of proof at trial.  <em>See Davis v.

Therefore, to the extent that the trial court's summary judgment may have been based on the City's argument there\r\nwas no evidence to show a waiver of sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act, it was error.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the City's argument that Martinez has \"no evidence sufficient to show a waiver of sovereign immunity\" - is\r\ninsufficient as a matter of law to raise any duty to respond under rule 166a(i) because this is nothing more than a prohibited\r\n\"conclusory\" motion or \"general\" no-evidence challenge.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a cmt.  On its face, this rule 166a(i) challenge\r\nfails to meet the requirement that \"the motion must be specific in challenging the evidentiary support for an element of a\r\nclaim.\"  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see Michael v.

The incident made the basis of this lawsuit occurred on January 10, 1996. Martinez\r\noriginally brought suit in federal court on or about November 26, 1997.  While this federal action was pending, Martinez\r\nfiled an action in state district court on October 8, 1999.  The federal court action was dismissed on November 3, 1999,\r\nwith the federal court declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Martinez's state law claims.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martinez contends that the statute of limitations was tolled by section 16.064 of the civil practice and remedies code.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง 16.064 (Vernon 1997).  Section 16.064 provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(a) The period between the date of filing an action in a trial court and the date of a second filing of the same action in a\r\ndifferent court suspends the running of the applicable statute of limitations for the period if:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1) because of lack of jurisdiction in the trial court where the action was first filed, the action is dismissed or the judgment\r\nis set aside or annulled in a direct proceeding; and <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) not later than the 60th day after the date the dismissal or other disposition becomes final, the action is commenced in a\r\ncourt of proper jurisdiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง 16.064 (Vernon 1997).  For purposes of the applicability of this section, a federal\r\ncourt's refusal to exercise jurisdiction over a pendent state claim is tantamount to a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.  <em>Vale\r\nv.

App.--Austin 1991, no writ).  Therefore, under the statute, appellant's suit was tolled\r\nfrom November 26, 1997, the date that she originally filed suit in federal court, until October 8, 1999, the date that she filed\r\nsuit in state district court.  We conclude that Martinez's suit was not barred by limitations, thus, the City's motion for\r\nsummary judgment would not have been appropriately granted on this ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Affirmative Defense of Suicide<em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The City next contends that summary judgment was proper under section 93.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\r\nCode.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง 93.001 (Vernon Supp. 2001).<sup> (1)</sup>  This section of the code provides that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(a) It is an affirmative defense to a civil action for damages for personal injury or death that the plaintiff, at the time the\r\ncause of action arose, was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) committing or attempting to commit suicide, and the plaintiff's conduct in committing or attempting to commit suicide\r\nwas the sole cause of the damages sustained; provided, however, if the suicide or attempted suicide was caused in whole or\r\nin part by a failure on the part of any defendant to comply with an applicable legal standard, then such suicide or attempted\r\nsuicide shall not be a defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(c) In an action to which this section applies, this section shall prevail over any other law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง 93.001 (Vernon Supp. 2001). The City had no defense under this section if it failed to\r\ncomply with the applicable standard of care, and this failure was a cause of Reyes's suicide.  <em>Id.; see Kassen v. Hatley</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1757094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1757094/kassen-v-hatley/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 13 (Tex. 1994). The jailers admitted that they had specific duties and responsibilities to inmates who posed a risk\r\nof suicide.  Martinez has presented uncontradicted evidence that the jailers knew that Reyes was a suicide risk, and knew\r\nthat suicidal inmates could use their clothing to hang themselves from the bars of their jail cells.  Reyes in fact hung\r\nhimself with his clothing from the bars of his cell.  The jailers failed to place Reyes in a padded cell, failed to issue\r\nsuicide-proof clothing, failed to monitor him, and failed to institute the jail's procedures to ensure Reyes received his\r\nmedication. This evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact on whether the City met the applicable legal standard of\r\ncare. Therefore, summary judgment on this ground would be improper.  <em>Kassen</em>, 887 S.W.2d at 13 (citing<em>  Evans v.

A governmental unit is immune from\r\ntort liability unless the legislature has waived immunity.  <em>See Harris County v. Dillard, </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525119\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525119/harris-county-v-dillard/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span>, 168 (Tex. 1994).\r\nExceptions to sovereign immunity are generally dependent entirely upon statute.  <em>See Dallas County MHMR v.

Section 101.021(2) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides a limited\r\nwaiver of sovereign immunity: a governmental unit in the state is liable for personal injury and death caused by a condition\r\nor use of tangible personal or real property if the governmental unit would, were it a private person, be liable to the\r\nclaimant according to Texas law. <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง101.021(2) (Vernon 1997).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To state an actionable complaint under the act, the personal injury or death must be proximately caused by the condition or\r\nuse of tangible property.  <em>Dallas County MHMR</em>, 968 S.W.2d at 341-42. \"Property does not cause injury if it does no more\r\nthan furnish the condition that makes the injury possible.\"  <em>Id. </em>at 343 (citing <em>Union Pump Co. v.

Absent allegations of\r\nwillful, wanton, or grossly negligent conduct, a licensee must prove that (1) a condition of the premises created an\r\nunreasonable risk of harm to the licensee, (2) the owner actually knew of the condition, (3) the licensee did not know of the\r\ncondition, (4) the owner failed to exercise ordinary care to protect the licensee from danger, and (5) the owner's failure was\r\na proximate cause of injury to the licensee.  <em>Id.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its motion for summary judgment, the City makes three arguments that Martinez's claims are barred by sovereign\r\nimmunity.<sup> (2)</sup>  First, the City argues that the negligent use of government property by someone other than a government\r\nemployee does not give rise to a waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act, and that Reyes's death was caused by\r\nReyes's use of the cell door rather than a City employee's use of the cell door.  Second, the City argues that because the cell\r\ndoor is an appurtenance of a premises, Martinez's claim is for a premises defect, and is thus exclusively governed by\r\nsection 101.022 of the Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง101.022 (Vernon\r\n1997).  Third, the City argues that Martinez cannot recover for the City's negligent formulation of policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response, Martinez alleged that (1) Reyes's death was caused by a  condition or use of tangible personal or real property,\r\n(2) the City provided property lacking an integral safety component and the lack of the component led to Reyes's death, and\r\n(3) Reyes's death was caused by the negligent implementation of formulated policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Use of Tangible Property</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We first address the City's argument that Reyes's suicide was caused by Reyes's use of the cell door rather than a City\r\nemployee's use of tangible real or personal property.  According to the City, the \"only use any City employee arguably made\r\nof the cell door in question was to close Plaintiff in a cell behind it: such does not constitute a negligent use of the cell door,\r\nas that is exactly what a cell door is supposed to be used for.\"  Citing <em>LeLeaux v. Hamshire-Fannett Ind. Sch. Dist.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1674333\"><a href=\"/opinion/1674333/leleaux-v-hamshire-fannett-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span> (Tex. 1992), the City thus argues that the negligent use of government property by someone other than a\r\ngovernment employee does not give rise to a waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act,.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to the City's argument, Martinez's pleadings and response allege that the City misused tangible property.  More\r\nspecifically, Martinez alleges that, contrary to its own policies, the City furnished Reyes a regular cell without furnishing\r\nhim the rip away garments necessary to render Reyes's use of the cell safe.  Martinez's response to the City's motion for\r\nsummary judgment specifically provides that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cell door at the Brownsville City Jail was directly used in [Reyes's] suicide and thus proximately caused his death. The\r\njailers had received on the job training as to what articles of clothing inmates could use to hang themselves using the\r\ntangible property of the cell door in jails and as such, the jailers were under instructions to issue blue paper garments to\r\ninmates that might be suicidal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe summary judgment evidence adduced by Martinez substantiates these allegations.  Moreover, many of the acts giving\r\nrise to liability under the Tort Claims Act involve some nexus between the injured party's \"use\" of the tangible property and\r\nthe governmental employee's use of the property.  This  nexus appears in the context of property lacking a safety\r\ncomponent, for example, as when a patient uses a bed without side rails, <em>see, e.g., Overton Mem'l Hosp.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1715002\"><a href=\"/opinion/1715002/overton-memorial-hospital-v-mcguire/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>,\r\nor a football player uses a uniform without a kneepad, <em>see, e.g., Lowe</em>, 540 S.W.2d at 300. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, even if we were to focus solely on Martinez's allegations concerning the jail cell, in isolation, without considering\r\nthe jail's failure to furnish paper garments, this Court has held that governmental employees can \"use\" a room for purposes\r\nof the Tort Claims Act.  <em>See Vela v.

App.-Eastland 1998, pet. denied)(claims\r\nconcerning use of a room alleged premises defect). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We must also reject the City's argument that the instant case is analogous to <em>Dallas County MHMR v. Bossley</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1652488\"><a href=\"/opinion/1652488/dallas-cty-mental-health-and-mental-retardation-v-bossley/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span> (Tex. 1998).  In <em>Bossley</em>, a mental patient who had previously attempted to take his own life escaped from a county\r\nmental health facility through an unlocked door.  During the subsequent pursuit by employees of the facility and the police,\r\nthe patient leaped into the path of a truck and was killed.  The patient's family brought suit against the facility alleging that\r\ntheir son's death was caused by an employee of the facility unlocking the outer door of the facility without first ensuring\r\nthat the inner doors were locked.  The family therefore claimed that their son's death came within the statutory waiver of\r\nimmunity under section 101.021(2) of the Tort Claims Act as a \"use or condition\" of tangible property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>   The court of appeals agreed with the patient's family, but the Texas Supreme Court reversed the intermediate court on\r\ngrounds that causation requires more than the mere involvement of tangible personal or real property.  <em>Id.</em> at 343.\r\nAccording to the supreme court, property does not cause injury if it does no more than furnish the condition that makes the\r\ninjury possible.  <em>Id.</em>  Although the patient's escape through the unlocked doors was part of a sequence of events that ended\r\nin his suicide, the use and condition of the doors were too distant geographically, temporally, and causally from the patient's\r\ndeath to have caused the death.  <em>Id.</em>  Furthermore, the court pointed out that the real substance of the plaintiffs' complaint\r\nwas that the patient's death was caused not by the condition or use of property, but by the failure of the county mental\r\nhospital staff to restrain the patient once they learned he was suicidal.  <em>Id.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Bossley </em> is distinguishable from the instant case on several grounds.  As an initial matter, Martinez's pleadings and evidence\r\nconcern the City's provision of property lacking a safety component and the City's negligent implementation of policy;\r\nneither argument was made in <em>Bossley</em>.  Not only did the staff fail to restrain Reyes from committing suicide, but by placing\r\nReyes in a regular cell with his clothing, the staff actually furnished the means for him to commit suicide.  Further,\r\ncausation in the instant case is direct: the decedent hung himself on his jail door, thus providing a close causal nexus both\r\ngeographically and temporally.  In fact, the City's own motion for summary judgment recites that \"it was Plaintiff's use of\r\nhis shirt and of the cell door that proximately caused his injuries.\" </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Characterization of Claims</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the City argues that because the cell door is an appurtenance of a premises, Reyes's claim is in the nature of a\r\npremises defect, and is thus exclusively governed by section 101.022 of the Tort Claims Act concerning premises liability\r\nclaims.  According to the City, Martinez neither pleaded nor proved that (1) a condition of the premises created an\r\nunreasonable risk of harm to the licensee; (2) the owner actually knew of the condition; (3) the licensee did not know of the\r\ncondition; (4) the owner failed to exercise ordinary care to protect the licensee from danger; (5) the owner's failure was a\r\nproximate cause of injury to the licensee.  <em>See Payne</em>, 838 S.W.2d at 237.  The City notes that these \"elements of proof\r\nwere not pleaded in any form, perhaps because they make absolutely no sense in the context of Plaintiff's allegations.\"   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an initial matter, we disagree with the City's position that Martinez has failed to plead a cause of action for premises\r\nliability.  A licensee need only prove the foregoing allegations absent allegations of wilful, wanton, or grossly negligent\r\nconduct, and Martinez has clearly pleaded wilful, wanton, and grossly negligent conduct on the part of the City.  <em>See id.\r\n</em>Moreover, the testimony discussed above represents more than a scintilla of evidence supporting these claims.  Thus, even\r\nif we were to construe Martinez's claims as sounding in premises liability, Martinez has established a waiver of immunity\r\nunder section 101.022, and the motion for summary judgment was improvidently granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, more fundamentally, we disagree with the City's characterization of this action as a premises liability claim under\r\nsection 101.022. In a premises defect case, liability is based on the duty of care owed by the governmental unit to the\r\nclaimant for premise and special defects under section 101.022.  <em>Texas Dept. of Transp. v. Able</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1575896\"><a href=\"/opinion/1575896/texas-dept-of-transp-v-able/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></a></span>, 612 (Tex.\r\n2000); <em>DeWitt v. Harris County</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523354\"><a href=\"/opinion/1523354/dewitt-v-harris-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span>, 653 (Tex. 1995).  In contrast, for a claim under section 101.021, liability\r\nis based on the actions of the governmental unit's employees.  <em>See Able</em>, 35 S.W.3d at 612.  In the instant case, Martinez's\r\nallegations are based on the actions of the jail's employees in furnishing Reyes a cell without padding and without paper\r\ngarments and in failing to follow its own policies regarding the treatment of suicidal inmates.  Martinez alleges that the use\r\nor condition of a jail cell with bars instead of a padded cell when used in conjunction with the lack of anti-suicide clothing\r\nwas a substantial factor in bringing about Reyes's death.  Martinez's claim does not merely relate to the bars on the jail cell,\r\nnor is her complaint that the jail cell was defective in some manner as would be the case were this a premises defect claim.\r\n<em>Cf. Laman</em>, 970 S.W.2d at 627 (no cause of action for premises defect where no defect, shortcoming, or imperfection in\r\nroom or door)(citing <em>Billstrom v. Memorial Med. Ctr.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2437612\"><a href=\"/opinion/2437612/billstrom-v-memorial-medical-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span>, 646 (Tex. Civ. App. -Corpus Christi 1980, no\r\nwrit).  Rather, Martinez's complaint is that, contrary to jail policy and procedure, Reyes was furnished a cell without being\r\nissued the paper garments necessary to make his use of the cell safe. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This case can most clearly be understood in relation to <em>Robinson v. Cent. Texas MHMR Ctr.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2412871\"><a href=\"/opinion/2412871/robinson-v-central-texas-mhmr-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span> (Tex. 1989).\r\nIn <em>Robinson</em>, the State was held liable for the drowning death of a state school patient when it provided the patient with\r\nswimming attire that did not include a life preserver, and the patient  drowned.  The MHMR employees knew that the\r\npatient suffered from epilepsy that occasionally caused him to lose consciousness.  Although the employees had life\r\npreservers available, they failed to issue one to the patient.  According to the Texas Supreme Court, the MHMR employees\r\nwere responsible for seeing that those for whom they cared were dressed in proper swimming attire, and a life preserver\r\nwas part of the patient's swimming attire. <em>Id.</em> at 171.    </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, in the instant case, the jailers were responsible for placement of suicide risks in particular cells, and were\r\nresponsible for ensuring that the clothing worn by suicide risks was safe.  The jailers removed belts and shoelaces, and\r\nissued blue paper suits.  The jailers knew that Martinez was a suicide risk, and knew, on the day of the incident, that he was\r\nagitated and asking for his medication.  They knew that the jail bars on regular cells could be used by suicide risks to hang\r\nthemselves, and they knew that inmates could use their clothing to hang themselves.  They had the option of placing\r\nMartinez in a padded cell or issuing him paper tear away garments, yet failed to do either.  Martinez in fact hung himself\r\nfrom the jail bars by his clothing.  Although we concur with other courts that the distinction between non-use and the\r\nfailure to provide something with safety components is difficult to draw, we conclude that the instant case implicates more\r\nthan the mere non-use of the paper garments.  <em>See Miller</em>, 2000 Tex. LEXIS at *14 (Hecht, J. concurring)(discussing\r\ndifficulty of applying \"use\" of property standard under the Tort Claims Act).</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Formulation or Implementation of Policy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>  Third, the City argues that the decedent's death was caused by the negligent formulation of policy.  With regard to\r\ngovernmental liability for policy decisions, sovereign immunity is preserved for the negligent formulation of policy, but\r\nwaived for the negligent implementation of policy.  <em>City of Brownsville v. Alvarado</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2435512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2435512/city-of-brownsville-v-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 754 (Tex.\r\n1995);<em>State v.

Civ. App.-Fort Worth 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.)(deciding type of\r\nmattress to provide to prisoners related to policy implementation).  We agree with the City that, to the extent that\r\nMartinez's claims relate to the formulation of policy rather than the implementation of policy, her claims must fail. Second,\r\nto the extent that she is generally claiming that the City failed to furnish proper training and instruction to its employees,\r\nthis claim will also fail.  <em>See Texas Dept. of Public Safety v. Petta</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1772033\"><a href=\"/opinion/1772033/texas-dept-of-public-safety-v-petta/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 580 (Tex. 2001)(negligent training\r\nclaim did not involve requisite tangible personal property).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, plaintiff's petition and response clearly raise fact issues regarding the City's negligent implementation of policy\r\nregarding the use or misuse of tangible property.  As discussed above, the jailers failed to follow the jail's policy regarding\r\nthe provision of paper garments to Reyes.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the jailers had a policy of closely monitoring suicidal inmates.  We agree that under many circumstances the\r\njailers' failure to monitor could be considered a discretionary function and therefore not actionable under the Tort Claims\r\nAct.  <em>See  e.g., City of Coppell v. Waltman</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419878\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419878/city-of-coppell-v-waltman/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></a></span>, 637 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1998, no pet.).  In this case, however,\r\nthe conflicting deposition testimony raises the issue that the physical focus of the camera covering Reyes's cell was\r\ndeficient.  As noted previously, Castro and Garcia testified that the camera monitoring Reyes's cell did not cover the area\r\non the bars where he hung himself.  Garcia even testified that she could not see Reyes via monitor even after being told that\r\nhe had hung himself.  However, according to Rios, the camera covered the area where Reyes hung himself, and according\r\nto his investigation, Castro and Garcia failed to see Reyes because \"they were busy doing other functions in the jail.\"  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, Martinez's petition and response show that the jailers failed to follow their own policy regarding the provision of\r\nmedicine to Reyes.  With regard to the provision of medications, the law is clear that the failure to provide medication or\r\nthe failure to provide appropriate medication is not actionable under the tort claims act.  <em>See Kerrville State Hosp. v. Clark</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1640366\"><a href=\"/opinion/1640366/kerrville-state-hosp-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span>, 585 (Tex. 1996)(failure to provide specific form of medication not actionable); <em>Kassen v. Hatley</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1757094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1757094/kassen-v-hatley/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 14 (Tex. 1994)(failure to provide medication constituted nonuse).  However, Martinez's petition recites that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The City of Brownsville, Texas, knew decedent Roberto Martinez Reyes as having psychiatric problems which required\r\nprescription medicine for control.  While in the custody of the City of Brownsville, Roberto Martinez Reyes exhibited\r\nobvious signs and behavior of mental illness.  During Roberto Martinez Reyes' incarceration the City of Brownsville not\r\nonly failed to provide Roberto Martinez Reyes with his required medication, but also refused to administer the requisite\r\nmedication when it was brought to the jail for Roberto Martinez Reyes.  As a result of such acts, Roberto Martinez Reyes\r\ndied while in the custody of the City of Brownsville . . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, the petition argues that the City was negligent in failing to \"implement and/or use proper procedures for a\r\nreferral to mental health and/or medical personnel.\"  Maria Garcia testified regarding the jail's procedures in administering\r\nmedication to inmates.  Before medication can be dispensed to an inmate, the jailers call an officer to transport the inmate\r\nto the hospital for review and approval of administration of the medication.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, the record evidence shows that the jailers were aware that Martinez required medication from their experience\r\nwith him during his prior incarcerations, and were similarly aware that Martinez posed a risk of suicide.  Castro was aware\r\nthat Martinez had been asking for his medication since the evening before he began his shift at approximately 2:30 p.m.\r\nMartinez continued to repeatedly asked the jailers for his medication during the day, and showed obvious signs of erratic\r\nbehavior.  Vargas sais that Martinez was apprehensive and scared if he didn't have his medication, and that he was afraid\r\nsomething was going to happen to him.   Vargas testified that he delivered the medication at approximately 3:00 p.m. that\r\nday, and told the jailers that it was important for Martinez to take the medication.  Nevertheless, the undisputed evidence\r\nshows that the jailers failed to institute the jail's procedure to enable Martinez to take his medication because they were too\r\nbusy with other duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>  In order for the City to be entitled to summary judgment, it must have established the affirmative defense of sovereign\r\nimmunity as a matter of law.  <em>Amer. Tobacco</em>, 951 S.W.2d at 425.  In order to determine if the trial court erred in granting\r\nthe City's motion for summary judgment, we must consider the summary judgment evidence in the light most favorable to\r\nMartinez, indulging all reasonable inferences in her favor.  <em>See id.  </em>We must further bear in mind that summary judgment\r\nwas intended to be a procedure to allow summary dismissal of \"patently unmeritorious claims or untenable defenses.\"  <em>See\r\nGulbenkian v. Penn</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2394389\"><a href=\"/opinion/2394389/gulbenkian-v-penn/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span>, 931 (Tex. 1952).   After reviewing the summary judgment evidence, we cannot\r\nconclude that this is such a case.  A governmental unit in the state is liable for personal injury and death caused by a\r\ncondition or use of tangible personal or real property if the governmental unit would, were it a private person, be liable to\r\nthe claimant according to Texas law. <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง101.021(2) (Vernon 1997).  Considering the\r\nsummary judgment evidence in the light most favorable to Martinez and indulging all reasonable inferences in her favor,\r\nMartinez produced evidence that Reyes's death was proximately caused by the City's use of tangible property.  The City\r\nfurnished Reyes property lacking an integral safety component, and the lack of the safety component resulted in Reyes's\r\ndeath.  Specifically, the City utilized a regular cell to incarcerate Reyes, a known suicide risk,  without replacing his\r\nclothing with paper garments.  The City did so despite full awareness that Reyes could hang himself on the cell's bars with\r\nhis clothes.  Under the facts of this case, a barred cell could not be used to safely incarcerate Reyes without paper garments.\r\nFurther, as discussed herein, Martinez produced evidence that the City negligently failed to implement its policies regarding\r\nthe use of tangible property, specifically, the provision of paper garments to inmates posing a risk of suicide, the use of\r\ncameras and monitors to observe suicidal prisoners, and the procedures for dispensing medicines to inmates.  In conclusion,\r\nthe City failed to establish that Martinez's suit was barred by sovereign immunity as a matter of law, and summary\r\njudgment would be improperly granted on this ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have examined each of the theories underlying the City's motion for summary judgment, and have found that none of\r\nthe theories advanced by the City are meritorious.  <em>See Bradley</em>, 990 S.W.2d at 247.  Accordingly, the summary judgment\r\nin favor of the City is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                         </p>\r\n\r\n<p>ROGELIO VALDEZ</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief Justice</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo not publish .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tex.
