The court\ngenerally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order\nand judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n\fof this appeal.   See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is\n\ntherefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n       Plaintiff-appellant, a Colorado state prisoner, filed a pro se civil rights\n\ncomplaint making numerous interrelated claims, which can be grouped in three\n\ngeneral categories: (1) the defendants violated his due process and equal\n\nprotection rights by placing him in punitive segregation; (2) the defendants\n\nconspired to have him convicted of a fabricated disciplinary offense in retaliation\n\nfor his exercise of his right to free speech and right against self-incrimination;\n\nand (3) the defendants engaged in a racially-motivated conspiracy to deprive him\n\nof his due process and equal protection rights.\n\n       All of plaintiff’s claims originated with his frequent and open leering at\n\na female staff member over a period of two to three months. When he admitted\n\nthe conduct but refused to sign a document identifying the behavior as\n\n“inappropriate” and stating that it “made female staff feel uncomfortable\n\nand threatened,” he was removed from the general prison population pending\n\na hearing. R., Vol. 2, doc. 49, ex. B. In a disciplinary proceeding, plaintiff was\n\nfound to have engaged in threatening behavior. As a result of this determination,\n\nand in light of plaintiff’s prior history of sexual violence, he was reclassified\n\nand placed in administrative segregation. When his administrative appeals were\n\nrejected, plaintiff sought relief in district court.\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\f      The district court referred plaintiff’s complaint to a magistrate judge for\n\npreliminary proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636. In a thorough and\n\nwell-written recommendation, the magistrate judge recommended that the district\n\ncourt grant the defendants’ motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. The\n\ndistrict court adopted the recommendation and dismissed the complaint.    1\n\n\n\n      On appeal, plaintiff continues to argue broadly that his placement in\n\nadministrative segregation was unwise, unfair, and unconstitutional. We review\n\nde novo the district court’s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim\n\n\n1\n       The magistrate judge recommended dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6) of plaintiff’s due process and equal protection claims relating to\nhis placement in punitive segregation pending a disciplinary hearing. She\nrecommended entry of summary judgment on the claim that the pre-hearing\nplacement was in retaliation for his exercise of constitutional rights. With regard\nto plaintiff’s assertions that he was unlawfully reclassified to administrative\nsegregation after the hearing, the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the\ndue process, equal protection, and retaliation claims. Concerning plaintiff’s\nchallenges to the validity of the disciplinary proceeding and conviction, she\nrecommended dismissal without prejudice, as either premature or cognizable\nexclusively in a habeas action under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, rather than the instant civil\nrights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Finally, she recommended dismissal of all\nconspiracy claims and any remaining miscellaneous claims.\n\n       The district court judge “conclude[d] that the recommendation is correct,”\nand granted defendants’ motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary\njudgment. R., Vol. 2, doc. 83. The clerk of the district court entered a judgment\nstating that the entire complaint was dismissed with prejudice.    See R., Vol. 3,\ndoc. 90. Although not at issue in this appeal, we note that the clerk’s blanket\ndismissal with prejudice is inconsistent with the district court’s order and with\nour case law. See Fottler v. United States , 73 F.3d 1064, 1065-66 (10th Cir.\n1996) (holding that dismissal of a claim mistakenly brought under § 1983 instead\nof § 2254 should be without prejudice).\n\n                                          -3-\n\ffor which relief may be granted and grant of a motion for summary judgment.\n\nSee McKnight v. Kimberly Clark Corp.       , 149 F.3d 1125, 1128 (10th Cir. 1998)\n\n(summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56);        Bauchman ex rel. Bauchman v.\n\nWest High Sch. , 132 F.3d 542, 550 (10th Cir. 1997) (dismissal under Rule\n\n12(b)(6)). We construe the pleadings and papers of a pro se appellant liberally.\n\nSee Haines v. Kerner , 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972) (per curiam).\n\n       The United States Constitution does not entitle an inmate to any particular\n\ndegree of liberty in prison; thus, changes to an inmate’s prison classification do\n\nnot involve deprivations of liberty.    See Templeman v. Gunter , 16 F.3d 367, 369\n\n(10th Cir. 1994). Although a state may create liberty interests that are protected\n\nby the Due Process Clause, such interests\n\n       will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which, while not\n       exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise\n       to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own force . . .\n       nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate\n       in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\n\nSandin v. Conner , 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995).\n\n       We have held that Colorado prison regulations do not create a liberty\n\ninterest in an inmate’s prison placement classification.      See Templeman , 16 F.3d\n\nat 369. Moreover, our review of the record fails to reveal the imposition of the\n\n“atypical and significant hardship” contemplated by        Sandin , or procedural\n\nirregularities in the disciplinary proceedings leading to his placement in\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\fadministrative segregation. Under these circumstances, there was no violation\n\nof plaintiff’s due process rights. Nor were plaintiff’s equal protection rights\n\naffected. Plaintiff has failed to allege or show that similarly-situated individuals\n\nof different races were treated differently.         See Powells v. Minnehaha County\n\nSheriff Dep’t , 198 F.3d 711, 712 (8th Cir. 1999).        2\n\n\n\n       With respect to plaintiff’s retaliation claim, he must demonstrate that the\n\naction was taken because of the exercise of his constitutional rights.       See Peterson\n\nv. Shanks , 149 F.3d 1140, 1144 (10th Cir. 1998). Standing alone, temporal\n\nproximity between the alleged exercise of rights and the administrative\n\nsegregation does not constitute sufficient circumstantial proof of a retaliatory\n\nmotive. Cf. Smith v. Maschner , 899 F.2d 940, 949 (10th Cir. 1990) (reversing\n\nsummary judgment because “circumstantial evidence of the suspicious timing\n\nof [plaintiff’s] discipline, coincidental transfers of his witnesses and assistants,\n\n\n2\n       We agree with the magistrate judge that, to the extent plaintiff attacks the\nsubstantive validity of the disciplinary proceedings and seeks injunctive relief\nrequiring restoration of his good-time credits, with the consequent reduction of\nthe length of his confinement, the claim is cognizable only in a § 2254 habeas\ncorpus action, not a § 1983 action.     See Heck v. Humphrey , 512 U.S. 477, 481\n(1994) (citing Preiser v. Rodriguez , 411 U.S. 475, 488-90 (1973) for the\nproposition that “habeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who\nchallenges the fact or duration of his confinement and seeks immediate or\nspeedier release, even though such a claim may come within the literal terms of\n§ 1983”). Moreover, any request for damages arising from the alleged\ndeprivation of good-time credits is premature, in that plaintiff cannot show that\nthe disciplinary conviction has been expunged, declared invalid, or called into\nquestion by an issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.    See id. at 486-87.\n\n                                               -5-\n\fand an alleged pattern by defendants of blocking his access to legal materials\n\nand assistance” was sufficient to create a jury question on a claim of retaliation\n\nfor exercise of the right to access to the courts). On this issue, plaintiff offered\n\nonly speculation and conclusory allegations. Because he failed to raise a genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact, summary judgment was appropriate.\n\n       Plaintiff’s final group of claims relates to his allegations that, due to racial\n\nanimus, defendants conspired to remove him from the general prison population\n\nand place him in segregation on false disciplinary charges. He has not alleged\n\nany specific facts showing a discriminatory motive, an agreement to deprive\n\nplaintiff of a constitutional right, or the actual deprivation of a constitutional\n\nright. The claim was properly dismissed.         See Boddie v. Schnieder , 105 F.3d 857,\n\n862 (2d Cir. 1997) (“[A] complaint containing only conclusory, vague, or general\n\nallegations of conspiracy to deprive a person of constitutional rights cannot\n\nwithstand a motion to dismiss.”) (quotation omitted).\n\n       The magistrate judge’s recommendation, which was adopted by the district\n\ncourt, fully explained why plaintiff’s claims lacked any legal merit. We also\n\nconclude plaintiff’s claims are without merit and further conclude that this appeal,\n\ntaken from the district court’s ruling, is frivolous.    See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(i); Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 327 (1989) (stating that a\n\nclaim is frivolous if it relies on an “indisputably meritless legal theory”).\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\fAccordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B), to count as a “prior occasion” for purposes of the three-strikes\n\nprovision set out in 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).    See Jennings v. Natrona County\n\nDetention Ctr. Med. Facility , 175 F.3d 775, 780-81 (10th Cir. 1999). Plaintiff’s\n\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is DENIED. The mandate shall\n\nissue forthwith.\n\n\n\n                                                     Entered for the Court\n\n\n\n                                                     Mary Beck Briscoe\n                                                     Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\f",

Although a state may create liberty interests that are protected\n\nby the Due Process Clause, such interests\n\n       will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which, while not\n       exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise\n       to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own force . . .\n       nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate\n       in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\n\nSandin v.

See Templeman , 16 F.3d\n\nat 369. Moreover, our review of the record fails to reveal the imposition of the\n\n“atypical and significant hardship” contemplated by        Sandin , or procedural\n\nirregularities in the disciplinary proceedings leading to his placement in\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\fadministrative segregation. Under these circumstances, there was no violation\n\nof plaintiff’s due process rights. Nor were plaintiff’s equal protection rights\n\naffected. Plaintiff has failed to allege or show that similarly-situated individuals\n\nof different races were treated differently.         See Powells v.

Moreover, any request for damages arising from the alleged\ndeprivation of good-time credits is premature, in that plaintiff cannot show that\nthe disciplinary conviction has been expunged, declared invalid, or called into\nquestion by an issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.

Because he failed to raise a genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact, summary judgment was appropriate.\n\n       Plaintiff’s final group of claims relates to his allegations that, due to racial\n\nanimus, defendants conspired to remove him from the general prison population\n\nand place him in segregation on false disciplinary charges. He has not alleged\n\nany specific facts showing a discriminatory motive, an agreement to deprive\n\nplaintiff of a constitutional right, or the actual deprivation of a constitutional\n\nright.
