(UPS),  alleging that\r\n\nUPS  refused  to hire  him  because of  his  disability, diabetes\r\n\nmellitus, in  violation of  the Americans  with Disabilities  Act\r\n\n(ADA), 42 U.S.C.    12101  et seq.   The  district court  granted\r                                           \r\n\nsummary judgment to UPS, on the ground that Arnold had not  shown\r\n\nthat  he had a disability and therefore  was not protected by the\r\n\nADA's antidiscrimination provision.  In making its determination,\r\n\nthe  court considered  Arnold's diabetes  in  its treated  state,\r\n\nafter taking into account the ameliorative effects of his insulin\r\n\nmedication.   Arnold appeals, arguing  that such an  analysis was\r\n\nlegally erroneous, inconsistent  with the ADA and with the EEOC's\r\n\ninterpretive regulations.   He also argues that the  facts he has\r\n\nintroduced prove that he satisfies the statutory definition of an\r\n\n\"individual  with  a  disability,\" and  that  UPS  has failed  to\r\n\ndemonstrate that it is  entitled to judgment as a matter  of law.\r\n\nUPS  argues  that  the  district  court's  analysis  of  Arnold's\r\n\ndisability   was   proper,   including   its   consideration   of\r\n\nameliorative  medication.  As an alternative ground for upholding\r\n\nthe   grant  of  summary  judgment,  UPS  contends  that  federal\r\n\nregulations  required  it   to  deny  Arnold's   application  for\r\n\nemployment, and UPS  is thereby entitled to judgment  as a matter\r\n\nof law.  We reverse and remand.\r\n\n                              Facts\r                                        Facts\r                                             \r\n\n          Because this  is  an appeal  from  a grant  of  summary\r\n\njudgment in  favor of  defendant UPS, we  state the facts  in the\r\n\n                               -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nlight most favorable to the  nonmovant, Arnold.

United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates Dep't of Agriculture, 102 F.3d 1273, 1284 (1st Cir. 1996),\r                                     \r\n\ncert.  denied, 117 S. Ct.  2510 (1997).  Plaintiff-Appellant Glen\r                       \r\n\nArnold has Type I insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.   As such,\r\n\nhe is required to monitor his blood glucose levels throughout the\r\n\nday, and give  himself injections of insulin two  to four times a\r\n\nday.   He is also required to  pay constant attention to possible\r\n\nsigns of hypoglycemia,  and to follow a strict  diet and exercise\r\n\nregimen to control the disease.  His physician states that Arnold\r\n\nwould die in  the absence of his insulin injections.   Arnold has\r\n\nsuccessfully controlled his diabetes for twenty-three years.\r\n\n          In  October, 1995, Arnold  telephoned a human resources\r\n\nrepresentative at UPS about applying  for the position of  \"cover\r\n\nmechanic.\"  The position called for covering the shifts of night-\r\n\ntime  mechanics  in four  locations:   Wells,  Maine,  and Dover,\r\n\nLaconia, and Twin Mountain, New  Hampshire.  Arnold had worked as\r\n\nan  automotive  mechanic  for  six years,  and  had  obtained  an\r\n\nassociate degree in automotive technology.\r\n\n          After the  initial  phone conversation,  Arnold met  in\r\n\nperson with both the human resources representative for UPS, Paul\r\n\nTanguay, and with  John Kennedy, UPS's  fleet supervisor for  its\r\n\nNorth  New Hampshire division.   By  all accounts,  both meetings\r\n\nwent well.  As a result, Kennedy indicated to Arnold that the job\r\n\nwas his if he wanted it.\r\n\n          The next day,  Arnold contacted Kennedy, and  said that\r\n\nhe wanted the job.   The two agreed on an  October 16, 1995 start\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ndate.   Arnold was informed  shortly thereafter that he  would be\r\n\nrequired to  pass a driving  test, have  his fingerprints  taken,\r\n\nfill  out additional  paperwork, and  submit to  a  Department of\r\n\nTransportation  (DOT) physical.1   On or about  October 12, 1995,\r\n\nArnold  filled out the  paperwork, was fingerprinted,  and passed\r\n\nthe  driving  test.   He was  then  sent to  a local  health care\r\n\nfacility,  Seacoast  Redicare, for  the  DOT  physical.   At  the\r\n\nphysical,  Arnold, responding to  a question from  the physician,\r\n\nindicated  that  he  was  an  insulin-dependent  diabetic.    The\r\n\nphysician  informed him  that DOT  regulations preclude  insulin-\r\n\ndependent diabetics from obtaining the DOT certification required\r\n\nto operate commercial motor vehicles.   On return to UPS, Tanguay\r\n\ninformed Arnold that UPS could not hire him because he was unable\r\n\nto obtain DOT certification.   Tanguay instead offered Arnold  an\r\n\nalternate position, as  a package \"pre-loader,\" a  position which\r\n\nprovides substantially lower pay.  Arnold did not respond to this\r\n\nalternate job offer.\r\n\n          Arnold instituted this action on October 9, 1996 in the\r\n\nUnited States District Court for  the District of Maine under the\r\n\nADA, 42 U.S.C.   12101 et seq., and the Maine Human Rights Act, 5\r                                        \r\n\nM.R.S.A.   4551 et  seq.  On March 14, 1997,  after discovery had\r                                  \r\n\nbeen completed, UPS filed a motion for summary judgment.   On May\r\n\n5, 1997, Magistrate  Judge David Cohen submitted  his Recommended\r\n\nDecision, ruling  in favor  of UPS on  the grounds  that, because\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1.  UPS requires all of its mechanics to acquire certification to\r\noperate commercial motor  vehicles as ostensibly mandated  by the\r\nUnited States Department of Transportation.\r\n\n                               -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nArnold's   diabetes  was   effectively   controlled  by   insulin\r\n\ninjections, he  was not disabled  within the meaning of  the ADA.\r\n\nOn  May  30, 1997,  the  district  court  (Hornby,  J.)  affirmed\r\n\nMagistrate Judge Cohen's recommendation, and  entered judgment in\r\n\nfavor of UPS.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n          The district court determined that, as a matter of law,\r\n\nArnold was  not disabled within  the meaning of the  ADA, because\r\n\nhis insulin-dependent  diabetic condition  did not  substantially\r\n\nlimit one  or more of his  major life activities.2   The district\r\n\ncourt  addressed  the  question  of   substantial  limitation  by\r\n\nanalyzing   Arnold's  diabetic  condition   after  he   took  his\r                                                           \r\n\nameliorative medications, rather than analyzing his unameliorated\r\n\ndiabetes.   For the reasons  that follow, we think  this analysis\r\n\nwas erroneous as a matter of law.\r\n\n                                A\r                                          A\r\n\n          The \"starting point for interpretation of a statute 'is\r\n\nthe language  of the statute  itself.'\"  Kaiser Aluminum  &amp; Chem.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp. v.

If the language of a statute \"is\r\n\nplain and admits of no more than one meaning\" and \"if  the law is\r\n\nwithin  the constitutional authority of the law-making body which\r\n\npassed it,\" then \"the duty  of interpretation does not arise\" and\r\n\n\"the  sole function  of  the  courts is  to  enforce the  statute\r\n\naccording to  its terms.\"   Caminetti v.

If the plain  language and  legislative history  still\r\n\nleave some room  for uncertainty about the statute's meaning, the\r\n\ncourt defers  to  the interpretation  by an  agency charged  with\r\n\nenforcement of the statute, as long as that interpretation \"flows\r\n\nrationally from a permissible construction of the statute.\"  Id.;\r                                                                          \r\n\nsee Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.\r                     \r\n\n                                B\r                                          B\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3.  \"[E]ven  the  most  basic  general  principles  of  statutory\r\nconstruction must yield to clear contrary evidence of legislative\r\nintent.\"  National R.R.

The statute defines \"disability\" to\r\n\nmean  \"(A) a  physical or  mental  impairment that  substantially\r\n\nlimits  one  or  more  of  the  major  life  activities  of  [an]\r\n\nindividual;  (B) a  record of  such an  impairment; or  (C) being\r\n\nregarded  as having such  an impairment.\"   42  U.S.C.   12102(2)\r\n\n(1994).  An  individual must meet  one of these  three prongs  in\r\n\norder to  be covered  under the  ADA.   If an  individual is  not\r\n\n\"disabled\" within the meaning of one of the three prongs, the ADA\r\n\ndoes not protect that person  against discrimination on the basis\r\n\nof his disability, and we  need not proceed beyond this threshold\r\n\nissue to  determine either  whether any  adverse action  has been\r\n\ntaken based upon the person's disability or whether  the employer\r\n\nshould have reasonably accommodated that disability.\r\n\n          The   statute  does   not  itself   define   the  terms\r\n\n\"impairment,\" \"substantially  limits,\" or \"major  life activity,\"\r\n\nall of  which could have more  than one meaning.   In particular,\r\n\nthe  statute  does not  indicate whether  medications, prosthetic\r\n\ndevices, or other ameliorative treatments should be considered by\r\n\n                               -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\na  court in  determining whether  an individual  suffers from  an\r\n\nimpairment  and whether  such impairment  substantially limits  a\r\n\nmajor   life  activity.  \"The  statute  certainly  does  not  say\r\n\n'impairment plus treatment'  or 'impairment  after treatment'  or\r\n\n'treated impairment'; it just says 'impairment.'\"  Sicard v.

A\r                        \r\n\nreasonable person could interpret the plain statutory language to\r\n\nrequire  an   evaluation  either  before  or  after  ameliorative\r\n\ntreatment.  \r\n\n          If  Congress has not expressly defined a statutory term\r\n\nor phrase,  a court should  \"normally construe  it in  accordance\r\n\nwith its ordinary  or natural meaning.\"  Smith  v.

But\r                                                   \r\n\neven as to the \"ordinary or natural meanings\" of the ADA's words,\r\n\nreasonable  minds  can   differ,  especially  regarding   whether\r\n\nameliorative measures should be taken into account in determining\r\n\nwhether an individual is disabled  within the meaning of the ADA.\r\n\n          UPS argues  that  the statutory  language  plainly  and\r\n\nunambiguously requires consideration of the impairment as treated\r\n\nwith  all ameliorative medications and  other measures.  In UPS's\r\n\nwords, \"substantially  limits means  substantially limits.\"   But\r\n\nthis  formulation begs  the  question.   The  ambiguous issue  is\r\n\nwhether the ADA's  reference to an  \"impairment\" (which might  or\r\n\nmight not  substantially limit  a major life  activity) means  an\r\n\nimpairment  without treatment or  an impairment  after treatment.\r\n\n                               -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nThe  word  \"impairment\"   could  conceivably  be  read   to  mean\r\n\n\"impairment  after  the  underlying  condition  is  treated  with\r\n\nameliorative  therapy,\" which is essentially the way the district\r\n\ncourt  interpreted  it.    Or  the word  could  be  read  to mean\r\n\n\"impairment that  results from  the underlying  condition in  the\r\n\nabsence  of  any ameliorative  treatment,\"  as the  EEOC  and the\r\n\nJustice Department have read it.   The statutory language, on its\r\n\nface, gives no clue as to which interpretation Congress intended.\r\n\nCertainly that language does not plainly and unambiguously refute\r\n\nArnold's  contention that  his  underlying  medical condition  --\r\n\ndiabetes  mellitus  --   constitutes  an  \"impairment\"  that   is\r\n\nprotected   by  the  ADA.     Similarly,  \"[a]lthough   the  term\r\n\n'substantially  limits' may be  unambiguous in and  of itself, it\r\n\nnonetheless does not speak to the issue before [us]; that is, the\r\n\nstatute is silent as to whether a substantial limitation is to be\r\n\nconsidered  with  or  without  regard  to  mitigating  measures.\"\r\n\nWilson v. Pennsylvania State Police  Dep't, 964 F. Supp. 898, 904\r                                                    \r\n\n(E.D. Pa. 1997) (footnote omitted).\r\n\n          Thus, the plain language of the ADA is not so clear and\r\n\nunambiguous as the district court and UPS have  characterized it,\r\n\nso we turn to other tools of statutory construction.  \r\n\n                                C\r                                          C\r\n\n          We begin with the legislative history of the ADA.  Both\r\n\nthe explicit language  and the illustrative examples  included in\r\n\nthe  ADA's  legislative  history make  it  abundantly  clear that\r\n\nCongress  intended the  analysis of  an \"impairment\"  and of  the\r\n\n                               -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nquestion  whether it \"substantially limits a major life activity\"\r\n\nto be  made on the basis  of the underlying (physical  or mental)\r\n\ncondition,  without  considering  the   ameliorative  effects  of\r\n\nmedication,  prostheses,  or  other  mitigating  measures.    For\r\n\nexample,  the House and Senate Committee reports explicitly state\r\n\nthat, in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a\r\n\nmajor life activity,  the impairment \"should be  assessed without\r\n\nconsidering whether mitigating measures,  such as auxiliary  aids\r\n\nor  reasonable  accommodations,  would  result  in  a  less-than-\r\n\nsubstantial limitation.\"   H.R.

The  district  court  reasoned that  the  Senate\r\n\nReport's  allusion to  uncontrolled diabetes  in  the context  of\r\n\nprong  three   demonstrates   that  Congress   did   not   intend\r\n\nuncontrolled medical conditions  to be included  in prong one  of\r\n\nthe definition  of \"disability.\"   But the district court  has no\r\n\nexplanation for why the Senate Report had previously said, in its\r\n\ndiscussion of prong one, that  the question \"whether a person has\r                                 \r\n\na  disability   should  be   assessed  without   regard  to   the\r\n\navailability   of  mitigating   measures,   such  as   reasonable\r\n\naccommodations or  auxiliary aids.\"   Senate Report  at 23.   Nor\r\n\ndoes  the court  explain why  both House  Reports and  the Senate\r\n\nReport do not mean exactly what they say (evaluating \"disability\"\r\n\nwithout consideration of  mitigating measures), especially  since\r                 \r\n\nonly  the Senate Report made the supposedly significant statement\r\n\nlimited to prong three.\r\n\n          Most significantly, this  \"prong three\" passage in  the\r\n\nSenate Report  is not  actually inconsistent  with that  report's\r\n\nprior language (identical with that of the House  Report) stating\r\n\nthat courts  should focus  on the  untreated impairments:   these\r\n\npassages can be easily squared by recognizing  that an individual\r\n\ncould  have a  \"disability\"  under  both  prong  one  (having  an\r                                                  \r\n\nimpairment that substantially  limits a major life  activity) and\r                                                                           \r\n\nprong three (\"regarded as\" having such an impairment) at the same\r\n\ntime;  one does  not preclude  the other.

In   the   context   of  employment\r\n\ndiscrimination,  the thrust  of this  purpose  is essentially  to\r\n\nprotect individuals who  have an underlying medical  condition or\r\n\nother limiting impairment,  but who are in fact  capable of doing\r                                                 \r\n\n                               -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nthe  job, with  or without  the help  of medications,  prosthetic\r\n\ndevices, or  other ameliorative measures,  and with or  without a\r\n\nreasonable accommodation by the employer.

But that  is what Congress\r\n\nintended.  The very first finding Congress listed in the preamble\r\n\nto the Act  is that \"some  43,000,000 Americans have one  or more\r\n\nphysical or mental disabilities, and this number is increasing as\r\n\nthe  population  as a  whole  is  growing older.\"    42  U.S.C.  \r\n\n12101(a)(1).  It  thus appears that Congress  not only considered\r\n\nbut actually intended  that the ADA's protections  sweep broadly,\r\n\ncovering a significant portion of the American populace.\r\n\n          One example that demonstrates how UPS's  interpretation\r\n\nof  the  statute would  be  inconsistent  with  the  Act's  broad\r\n\nremedial  purposes was  pointed out  by  the EEOC  in its  amicus\r\n\nbrief.   Under UPS's interpretation, someone who could not afford\r\n\ntreatment for his  impairment would be protected by  the ADA from\r\n\ndiscrimination in  hiring.   But once he  was hired  and obtained\r\n\ntreatment under  the employer's  health plan,  he would  lose the\r\n\n                               -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nADA's protection because  he would no longer be  \"disabled.\"  The\r\n\nemployer  could then  fire him  on  the basis  of his  disability\r\n\nwithout fear of  the protective consequences embodied in the ADA.\r\n\nUPS argues that \"[t]his is simply not true; such conduct would be\r\n\nthe very sort  of situation the 'regarded as'  prong was designed\r\n\nto cover.\"  Even if such conduct were covered under prong  three,\r\n\nthat would not mean  the same conduct is  not also covered  under\r\n\nprong  one.   Indeed,  the  House  Report  specifically  mentions\r\n\n\"persons  with impairments, such  as epilepsy or  diabetes, which\r                                                                    \r\n\nsubstantially limit a major life activity\" and says that they are\r\n\n\"covered  under the first prong of  the definition of disability,\r                                   \r\n\neven  if  the   effects  of  the  impairment  are  controlled  by\r\n\nmedication.\"   House Report  at 52  (emphasis added);  see Senate\r                                                                    \r\n\nReport  at 22.   There is  no reason  this employee could  not be\r\n\nprotected under two prongs simultaneously.  In light of the broad\r\n\nremedial purposes of  the ADA,  see Penny,  128 F.3d  at 414,  we\r                                                   \r\n\nbelieve Congress intended the Act  to prohibit such a termination\r\n\nunder prong one.  \r\n\n          Similarly,  UPS's  reading  would treat  differently  a\r\n\nplaintiff  like Arnold (who takes his  medications and thus would\r\n\nnot be  protected by the ADA,  according to UPS) and  a plaintiff\r\n\nwho is  also  diabetic (i.e.,  suffering  from the  same  medical\r\n\ncondition  as  Arnold)  but   who  cannot  afford  to  take   his\r\n\nmedications.  The latter plaintiff  would be protected by the ADA\r\n\naccording to UPS's  analysis, but Arnold  would not.   We do  not\r\n\nthink Congress intended such an anomalous result.\r\n\n                               -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n          Arnold's diabetes makes him just the type of person the\r\n\nADA was designed to protect.  He would have been hired by UPS but\r\n\nfor his inability to get  a commercial vehicle license, which was\r\n\nprevented  only because he  had diabetes (the  underlying medical\r\n\ncondition, without  taking into account  ameliorative treatment).\r\n\nBut Arnold alleges  that, with treatment, he can  perform the job\r\n\ndespite  his impairment if  UPS will reasonably  accommodate him.\r\n\nThis would ordinarily be a factual question on the merits for the\r\n\ncourt to  determine.   Yet under UPS's  and the  district court's\r\n\ninterpretation of the ADA, a  person in this archetypal situation\r\n\nis not protected from discrimination by the ADA because he is not\r\n\ndisabled and  hence not  even a proper  plaintiff under  the Act.\r\n\nAccording to UPS, in such  circumstances, the trier of fact never\r\n\ngets  to  the  merits  of  the  alleged  discrimination,  of  the\r\n\n\"qualified individual\" requirement,or of reasonableaccommodation.\r\n\n          UPS's interpretation fails because, by \"confus[ing] the\r\n\ndisease  with  its  treatment,\"  Matczak  v.  Frankford  Candy  &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nChocolate  Co., No.  96-1057, slip  op. at  6 (3d  Cir.  Nov. 18,\r                        \r\n\n1997),  it  conflates  two  separate  parts  of  the  ADA.    The\r\n\ndetermination  as to  whether  an individual  is \"disabled\"  is a\r\n\nthreshold  issue;  if  one  is  not disabled,  then  one  is  not\r\n\nprotected  by the ADA  against discrimination.   See Soileau, 105\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d  at 15.  Once  a person is  determined to be  covered by the\r\n\nADA, then that person has a right not to be discriminated against\r\n\nin employment  (inter alia)  on the basis  of her  disability, as\r\n\nlong  as  she is  qualified  for  the  job,  with  or  without  a\r\n\n                               -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nreasonable accommodation.   Were  we to  adopt UPS's  position in\r\n\nthis  case,  a  plaintiff  would   have  to  prove  that  she  is\r\n\n\"substantially limited\" even with  ameliorative medication -- and\r\n\ntherefore  possibly unable  to  perform  some  of  the  essential\r\n\nelements of  the job -- in order just  to be covered by the ADA's\r\n\nprotective  umbrella.    Thus,  under  UPS's  interpretation, the\r\n\nemployer  could avoid  liability for discrimination  by excluding\r\n\nthe  plaintiff  from  the  ADA's  coverage,  without  giving  the\r\n\napplicant an  opportunity to show  that she is qualified  for the\r\n\njob   (with  or   without  a   reasonable  accommodation),   with\r\n\nameliorative  medication.

UPS\r\n\nwill have every opportunity to  demonstrate that Arnold is unable\r\n\nto perform  one or more  of the essential  functions of the  job.\r\n\nIndeed, the  burden will be on  Arnold to demonstrate that  he is\r\n\nqualified for the job.  UPS will also be free to try to show that\r\n\nany  accommodations  Arnold  needs  would  be  too  expensive  or\r\n\notherwise too burdensome to be considered \"reasonable.\"  But none\r\n\nof UPS's  articulated concerns  are applicable  at the  threshold\r\n\nstage where  the court is  determining whether the  individual is\r\n\n                               -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\ndisabled and therefore  protected by the ADA in  the first place.\r\n\nThus,   contrary  to  UPS's  reading,  the  ADA's  definition  of\r\n\n\"disability\" is most  consistent with the  broad purposes of  the\r\n\nstatute if Arnold's impairment and  its effects are evaluated  in\r\n\ntheir  untreated  state,  without  the  ameliorative   effect  of\r\n\nmedications on his underlying medical condition.7\r\n\n          Evaluating the statutory  language of the ADA  in light\r\n\nof the legislative history and the broad remedial purposes of the\r\n\nAct, we  conclude that  Congress  intended a  reviewing court  to\r\n\nevaluate  Arnold's disability  based  on  his underlying  medical\r\n\ncondition  without  considering the  ameliorative effects  of his\r\n\ninsulin medication.   The district court erred in  holding to the\r\n\ncontrary.\r\n\n                                E\r                                          E\r\n\n          Even if the legislative history were  not clear on this\r\n\npoint, the  court  also  erred  in  failing  to  afford  adequate\r\n\nconsideration to the similar interpretation set forth by the EEOC\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7.  UPS's   interpretation  could   very  well   produce  results\r\nantithetical to its expressed  concerns and to the  Act's attempt\r\nto take  such  concerns  into account.    That a  person  with  a\r\ndisability  is able  to use  medical  knowledge or  technology to\r\novercome many of the effects of his illness (in Arnold's case, by\r\na continuing regimen of medicine, proper eating habits, and rest)\r\nmay mean  that he will,  in practice, rarely require  any sort of\r\naccommodation from his  employer; but his achievement  should not\r\nleave  him  subject  to discrimination  based  on  his underlying\r\ndisability.   He should not be denied  the protections of the ADA\r\nbecause   he  has   independently   taken   the  initiative   and\r\nsuccessfully brought his  diabetes under control.  It  is hard to\r\nimagine that Congress wished to provide protection to workers who\r\nleave  it to their employer  to accommodate their impairments but\r\nto deny protection  to workers who act  independently to overcome\r\ntheir disabilities, thereby creating a disincentive to self-help.\r\n\n                               -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nin its  guidelines.

In\r                                  \r\n\naddition,  the  reasonableness of  the  EEOC's  interpretation is\r\n\nbolstered by a  virtually identical interpretation by  the United\r\n\nStates Department of Justice, which is charged with enforcing the\r\n\nADA's  prohibition of discrimination  based on disability  on the\r\n\npart of  state and  local governmental entities.   See  28 C.F.R.\r                                                                \r\n\nPart 35, App. A    35.104 (\"disability should be assessed without\r\n\nregard to the availability of mitigating measures\").\r\n\n          Defendant  UPS claims  that  the EEOC's  interpretation\r\n\n(and,  inferentially, the Justice  Department's) reads  the words\r\n\n\"substantially limits\" out of the statute.   The Eleventh Circuit\r\n\nrejected this argument  in Harris v.  H &amp; W Contracting  Co., 102\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 516, 521  (11th Cir. 1996),  and so do  we.  UPS's  argument\r\n\nessentially begs the  question.  The key question  is whether the\r\n\nstatutory  word  \"impairment\"  refers  to  treated  or  untreated\r\n\nimpairments.  The \"substantially limits\"  requirement pertains to\r\n\nthe impairment referred to in  the first part of the definitional\r\n\nsentence,  regardless of whether that impairment  is read to mean\r\n\nthe condition in its treated or  untreated state.  Thus, far from\r\n\nreading  that  requirement   out  of  the  statute,   the  EEOC's\r\n\ninterpretive  guideline  helps  to clarify  an  ambiguity  in the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9.  UPS itself  relies on  a different section  of the  same EEOC\r\nInterpretive Guidance, 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, App.   1630.15(e), in\r\nmaking its  argument that the  district court decision  should be\r\naffirmed for a different reason than the court gave.\r\n\n                               -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nstatute, and places the statutory words \"substantially limits\" in\r\n\nproper  relation  to   the  impairment.    The   guideline  reads\r\n\n\"substantially limits\"  as referring to the  untreated impairment\r\n\nrather than the treated impairment.  The trier of fact must still\r\n\ndecide whether  the untreated  impairment \"substantially  limits\"\r\n\nany  major   life  activity  before   the  untreated   impairment\r\n\nconstitutes a \"disability\"  within the meaning of the  ADA.  This\r\n\nis a  permissible reading  of the  ambiguous statutory  language.\r\n\nId.  Surely,  nothing in the language  of the Act rules  out this\r             \r\n\napproach.   Indeed,  as noted  supra,  at least  with respect  to\r                                              \r\n\ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Congress appears to have had\r\n\nsuch an  interpretation specifically  in mind.   See House  Labor\r                                                              \r\n\nReport at 51-52; Senate Report at 22-23.\r\n\n          UPS further  argues that the EEOC \"must be saying\" that\r\n\na person taking insulin is per se significantly restricted.  This\r                                           \r\n\nclaim  is also  meritless.   Nowhere  does the  EEOC interpretive\r\n\nguideline say that any particular  medical condition would per se\r                                                                           \r\n\nbe treated as a disability or that any similar per se rule should\r                                                               \r\n\napply.   On  the contrary,  the EEOC  regulations and  guidelines\r\n\nemphasize  the  requirement  that  every  person's  situation  be\r\n\ntreated  individually.  See  Appendix to Part  1630, \"Background\"\r                                     \r\n\n(observing that  \"[t]his case-by-case approach is essential\"); 29\r\n\nC.F.R.

The\r\n\nEEOC's  reading of  the statute  does not  become a  per  se rule\r                                                                      \r\n\nsimply because, when  an individualized evaluation is  applied to\r\n\nindividuals who have  a particular medical condition,  the result\r\n\nwill almost always  turn out to be  the same.  For  example, even\r\n\nunder UPS's reading  of the statute, virtually  all quadriplegics\r\n\nwill   probably  be  found   to  qualify  as   \"individuals  with\r\n\ndisabilities\" under the ADA, but this result does not mean courts\r\n\nare  applying  a  per  se  rule  rather  than  an  individualized\r                                   \r\n\nanalysis.\r\n\n                                F\r                                          F\r\n\n          Finally, the  majority of  federal circuit  courts that\r\n\nhave  considered this issue have followed the EEOC interpretation\r\n\nthat  ameliorative   measures   should  not   be  considered   in\r\n\ndetermining  whether   an  impairment  substantially   limits  an\r\n\nindividual's major life activities.

But  the conclusion  in Harris  remains\r                                                                  \r\n\nvalid, including its determination that the EEOC's interpretation\r\n\nof the ADA  is a permissible one.  UPS has no persuasive rebuttal\r\n\nto the lesser  degree of deference that we  have applied pursuant\r\n\nto  Meritor   --  giving   some  consideration   to  the   EEOC's\r                                         \r\n\ninterpretation.    Like the  Harris  court,  we find  the  EEOC's\r                                             \r\n\ninterpretation  to  be  consistent  with  the  ADA's  legislative\r\n\nhistory,  as outlined  supra,   and with  the overall  protective\r                                      \r\n\npurpose of the ADA; the interpretation is therefore permissible.\r\n\n          We  conclude, therefore, that  the ADA  protects Arnold\r\n\nfrom  discrimination if he  is disabled  based on  his underlying\r\n\nmedical   condition,  without  regard  to  whether  some  of  his\r\n\nlimitations   are   ameliorated  through   medication   or  other\r\n\ntreatment.   This holding is based on the  facts of this case and\r\n\nis  limited  to  the condition  presented  here,  namely diabetes\r\n\nmellitus.  We venture no opinion as to whether we would reach the\r\n\nsame conclusion if  other medical conditions or  other facts were\r\n\npresented.10  We conclude in this case that the EEOC's guidelines\r\n\nare worthy of  consideration and that  Arnold's diabetes, in  its\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10.  For example, we  might reach a different result  in the case\r\nof  a  myopic   individual  whose  vision  is   correctable  with\r\neyeglasses.    The  availability of  such  a  simple, inexpensive\r\nremedy,  that can provide assured, total and relatively permanent\r\ncontrol of all  symptoms, would seem  to make correctable  myopia\r\nthe kind of  \"minor, trivial impairment[],\" Senate  Report at 23,\r\nthat would not be considered a disability under the ADA.\r\n\n                               -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nuntreated state, is a disability protected from discrimination by\r\n\nthe ADA.11 \r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the\r                                                          reversed\r                                                                  \r\n\ncase is  remanded for  further proceedings  consistent with  this\r                   remanded\r                           \r\n\nopinion.

(UPS), alleging that UPS refused to hire him because of his disability, diabetes mellitus, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq.   The district court granted summary judgment to UPS, on the ground that Arnold had not shown that he had a disability and therefore was not protected by the ADA's antidiscrimination provision.  In making its determination, the court considered Arnold's diabetes in its treated state, after taking into account the ameliorative effects of his insulin medication.  Arnold appeals, arguing that such an analysis was legally erroneous, inconsistent with the ADA and with the EEOC's interpretive regulations.  He also argues that the facts he has introduced prove that he satisfies the statutory definition of an \"individual with a disability,\" and that UPS has failed to demonstrate that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  UPS argues that the district court's analysis of Arnold's disability was proper, including its consideration of ameliorative medication.  As an alternative ground for upholding the grant of summary judgment, UPS contends that federal regulations required it to deny Arnold's application for employment, and UPS is thereby entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  We reverse and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant UPS, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, Arnold.  Dubois v. United States Dep't of Agriculture, 102 F.3d 1273, 1284 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2510, 138 L.Ed.2d 1013 (1997).  Plaintiff-Appellant Glen Arnold has Type I insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  As such, he is required to monitor his blood glucose levels throughout the day, and give himself injections of insulin two to four times a day.  He is also required to pay constant attention to possible signs of hypoglycemia, and to follow a strict diet and exercise regimen to control the disease.  His physician states that Arnold would die in the absence of his insulin injections.  Arnold has successfully controlled his diabetes for twenty-three years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October, 1995, Arnold telephoned a human resources representative at UPS about applying for the position of \"cover mechanic.\"   The position called for covering the shifts of night-time mechanics in four locations:  Wells, Maine, and Dover, Laconia, and Twin Mountain, New Hampshire.  Arnold had worked as an automotive mechanic for six years, and had obtained an associate degree in automotive technology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the initial phone conversation, Arnold met in person with both the human resources representative for UPS, Paul Tanguay, and with John Kennedy, UPS's fleet supervisor for its North New Hampshire division.  By all accounts, both meetings went well.  As a result, Kennedy indicated to Arnold that the job was his if he wanted it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Arnold contacted Kennedy, and said that he wanted the job.  The two agreed on an October 16, 1995 start date.  Arnold was informed shortly thereafter that he would be required to pass a driving test, have his fingerprints taken, fill out additional paperwork, and submit to a Department of Transportation (DOT) physical.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On or about October 12, 1995, Arnold filled out the paperwork, was fingerprinted, and passed the driving test.  He was then sent to a local health care facility, Seacoast Redicare, for the DOT physical.  At the physical, Arnold, responding to a question from the physician, indicated that he was an insulin-dependent diabetic.  The physician informed him that DOT regulations preclude insulin-dependent diabetics from obtaining the DOT certification required to operate commercial motor vehicles.  On return to UPS, Tanguay informed Arnold that UPS could not hire him because he was unable to obtain DOT certification.  Tanguay instead offered Arnold an alternate position, as a package \"pre-loader,\" a position which provides substantially lower pay.  Arnold did not respond to this alternate job offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arnold instituted this action on October 9, 1996 in the United States District Court for the District of Maine under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq., and the Maine Human Rights Act, 5 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4551 et seq.   On March 14, 1997, after discovery had been completed, UPS filed a motion for summary judgment.  On May 5, 1997, Magistrate Judge David Cohen submitted his Recommended Decision, ruling in favor of UPS on the grounds that, because Arnold's diabetes was effectively controlled by insulin injections, he was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA.  On May 30, 1997, the district court (Hornby, J.) affirmed Magistrate Judge Cohen's recommendation, and entered judgment in favor of UPS.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The district court determined that, as a matter of law, Arnold was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA, because his insulin-dependent diabetic condition did not substantially limit one or more of his major life activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court addressed the question of substantial limitation by analyzing Arnold's diabetic condition after he took his ameliorative medications, rather than analyzing his unameliorated diabetes.  For the reasons that follow, we think this analysis was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The \"starting point for interpretation of a statute 'is the language of the statute itself.' \"  Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem.

GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980));  see Telematics Int'l, Inc. v. NEMLC Leasing Corp., 967 F.2d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1992).  If the language of a statute \"is plain and admits of no more than one meaning\" and \"if the law is within the constitutional authority of the law-making body which passed it,\" then \"the duty of interpretation does not arise\" and \"the sole function of the courts is to enforce the statute according to its terms.\"  Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 485, 37 S.Ct. 192, 194, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917);  see also Chevron USA Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).  The plain meaning of a statute's text must be given effect \"unless it would produce an absurd result or one manifestly at odds with the statute's intended effect.\"  Parisi by Cooney v. Chater, 69 F.3d 614, 617 (1st Cir.1995).  Of course, we focus on \"the plain meaning of the whole statute, not of isolated sentences.\"  Beecham v. United States, 511 U.S. 368, 372, 114 S.Ct. 1669, 1671, 128 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and we interpret the statute's words \" 'in light of the purposes Congress sought to serve,' \" Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc., 460 U.S. 103, 118, 103 S.Ct. 986, 995, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983) (quoting Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., 441 U.S. 600, 608, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the district court is correct that we need not look into a statute's legislative history if the statutory language is plain, see Summit Inv. &amp; Dev.  Corp. v. Leroux, 69 F.3d 608, 610 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Plain statutory language does not prompt recourse to countervailing legislative history.\"), at least in the absence of a \"clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 110, 103 S.Ct. at 990 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);  United States v. Caron, 77 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1996).  If the text is not unambiguously clear, however, we are obliged to turn to other sources to discern the legislature's meaning.  One important source, of course, is the legislative history.  If that history reveals an unequivocal answer, we do not look to the interpretation that may be given to the statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.  Strickland v. Commissioner, Maine Dep't of Human Servs., 48 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1995) (applying the test of Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-44, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-83).   If the plain language and legislative history still leave some room for uncertainty about the statute's meaning, the court defers to the interpretation by an agency charged with enforcement of the statute, as long as that interpretation \"flows rationally from a permissible construction of the statute.\"  Id.;  see Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the statutory language is far from clear, particularly with respect to the key question in dispute here:  should a court, in determining whether Arnold is \"an individual with a disability,\" consider his untreated medical condition or his condition after treatment with ameliorating medications?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA protects a qualified individual with a disability from discrimination in employment, among other things.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a) (1994).  The statute defines \"disability\" to mean \"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual;  (B) a record of such an impairment;  or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2) (1994).  An individual must meet one of these three prongs in order to be covered under the ADA.  If an individual is not \"disabled\" within the meaning of one of the three prongs, the ADA does not protect that person against discrimination on the basis of his disability, and we need not proceed beyond this threshold issue to determine either whether any adverse action has been taken based upon the person's disability or whether the employer should have reasonably accommodated that disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute does not itself define the terms \"impairment,\" \"substantially limits,\" or \"major life activity,\" all of which could have more than one meaning.  In particular, the statute does not indicate whether medications, prosthetic devices, or other ameliorative treatments should be considered by a court in determining whether an individual suffers from an impairment and whether such impairment substantially limits a major life activity.  \"The statute certainly does not say 'impairment plus treatment' or 'impairment after treatment' or 'treated impairment';  it just says 'impairment.' \"  Sicard v. City of Sioux City, 950 F.Supp. 1420, 1436 (N.D.Iowa 1996).  A reasonable person could interpret the plain statutory language to require an evaluation either before or after ameliorative treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Congress has not expressly defined a statutory term or phrase, a court should \"normally construe it in accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning.\"  Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 228, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2054, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993);  see Telematics, 967 F.2d at 706.   But even as to the \"ordinary or natural meanings\" of the ADA's words, reasonable minds can differ, especially regarding whether ameliorative measures should be taken into account in determining whether an individual is disabled within the meaning of the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS argues that the statutory language plainly and unambiguously requires consideration of the impairment as treated with all ameliorative medications and other measures.  In UPS's words, \"substantially limits means substantially limits.\"   But this formulation begs the question.  The ambiguous issue is whether the ADA's reference to an \"impairment\" (which might or might not substantially limit a major life activity) means an impairment without treatment or an impairment after treatment.  The word \"impairment\" could conceivably be read to mean \"impairment after the underlying condition is treated with ameliorative therapy,\" which is essentially the way the district court interpreted it.  Or the word could be read to mean \"impairment that results from the underlying condition in the absence of any ameliorative treatment,\" as the EEOC and the Justice Department have read it.  The statutory language, on its face, gives no clue as to which interpretation Congress intended.  Certainly that language does not plainly and unambiguously refute Arnold's contention that his underlying medical condition--diabetes mellitus--constitutes an \"impairment\" that is protected by the ADA.  Similarly, \"[a]lthough the term 'substantially limits' may be unambiguous in and of itself, it nonetheless does not speak to the issue before [us];  that is, the statute is silent as to whether a substantial limitation is to be considered with or without regard to mitigating measures.\"  Wilson v. Pennsylvania State Police Dep't, 964 F.Supp. 898, 904 (E.D.Pa.1997) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the plain language of the ADA is not so clear and unambiguous as the district court and UPS have characterized it, so we turn to other tools of statutory construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the legislative history of the ADA.  Both the explicit language and the illustrative examples included in the ADA's legislative history make it abundantly clear that Congress intended the analysis of an \"impairment\" and of the question whether it \"substantially limits a major life activity\" to be made on the basis of the underlying (physical or mental) condition, without considering the ameliorative effects of medication, prostheses, or other mitigating measures.  For example, the House and Senate Committee reports explicitly state that, in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, the impairment \"should be assessed without considering whether mitigating measures, such as auxiliary aids or reasonable accommodations, would result in a less-than-substantial limitation.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt.  III, at 28 (1989), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 451 (House Judiciary Report);  see H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt.  II, at 52 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 334 (\"House Labor Report\") (The determination whether an individual has a \"disability\" within the scope of ADA coverage \"should be assessed without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids.\");   S.Rep. No. 101-116, at 23 (1989) (\"Senate Report\")(same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, Congress spoke directly to the medical condition at issue in this case:  \"persons with impairments, such as epilepsy or diabetes, which substantially limit a major life activity,\" are considered to have an actual disability, \"even if the effects of the impairment are controlled by medication.\"   House Labor Report at 52;  see id. at 51 (Although it is not possible to list all impairments covered by the ADA, \"[t]he term includes ... diabetes.\");   Senate Report at 22 (same).  These reports make it abundantly clear that Congress intended that the statutory definition of disability--an \"impairment that substantially limits [a] major life activit[y]\"--refers to the underlying medical condition, in this case Arnold's diabetes, without regard to whether \"the effects of the impairment are controlled by medication.\"   House Labor Report at 52.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court focused on another statement in the Senate Report (contained in the Report's discussion of prong 3 but not contained in the House Reports):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Another important goal of the third prong of the definition is to ensure that persons with medical conditions that are under control, and that therefore do not currently limit major life activities, are not discriminated against on the basis of their medical conditions.  For example, individuals with controlled diabetes or epilepsy are often denied jobs for which they are qualified.  Such denials are the result of negative attitudes and misinformation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Senate Report at 24;  see Arnold v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., No. 96-294-P-H, slip op. at 13 (D.Me. May 5, 1997).  Noting that this \"speaks to the 'uncertainty' about the value of legislative history, and the attendant skepticism with which courts should view such documents,\" the district court relies on the above-quoted passage from the Senate Report to conclude that the EEOC's interpretation does not flow rationally from a \"permissible construction of the statute.\"  Arnold, slip op. at 13 (applying the test of Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82).   The court reached this conclusion despite its recognition that \"the need for deference to the agency's view 'looms large.' \"  Id. (quoting Strickland, 48 F.3d at 17).   The district court reasoned that the Senate Report's allusion to uncontrolled diabetes in the context of prong three demonstrates that Congress did not intend uncontrolled medical conditions to be included in prong one of the definition of \"disability.\"   But the district court has no explanation for why the Senate Report had previously said, in its discussion of prong one, that the question \"whether a person has a disability should be assessed without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids.\"   Senate Report at 23.  Nor does the court explain why both House Reports and the Senate Report do not mean exactly what they say (evaluating \"disability\" without consideration of mitigating measures), especially since only the Senate Report made the supposedly significant statement limited to prong three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most significantly, this \"prong three\" passage in the Senate Report is not actually inconsistent with that report's prior language (identical with that of the House Report) stating that courts should focus on the untreated impairments:  these passages can be easily squared by recognizing that an individual could have a \"disability\" under both prong one (having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity) and prong three (\"regarded as\" having such an impairment) at the same time;  one does not preclude the other.  The ADA protects any individual with a \"disability\" against both discrimination based on prong one and discrimination based on prong three.D</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" 'As in all cases of statutory construction, our task is to interpret the words of [the statute] in light of the purposes Congress sought to serve.' \"  Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 118, 103 S.Ct. at 995 (quoting Chapman, 441 U.S. at 608, 99 S.Ct. at 1911) (alteration in Dickerson );  see Caron, 77 F.3d at 3-4.   Thus, \"[t]he definition of disability must be understood in light of congressional objectives in enacting the ADA.\"  Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir.1997).  The district court's interpretation of the ADA to require evaluation of an impairment like Arnold's diabetes only after ameliorative treatment such as insulin medication is inconsistent with those congressional objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA is a \"broad remedial statute.\"  Penny v. United Parcel Serv., 128 F.3d 408, 414 (6th Cir.1997).  It is a \"familiar canon of statutory construction that remedial legislation,\" such as the ADA, \"should be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes.\"  Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336, 88 S.Ct. 548, 553, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967).  The fundamental purpose of the ADA is \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(b)(1) (1994).  In the context of employment discrimination, the thrust of this purpose is essentially to protect individuals who have an underlying medical condition or other limiting impairment, but who are in fact capable of doing the job, with or without the help of medications, prosthetic devices, or other ameliorative measures, and with or without a reasonable accommodation by the employer.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(a)(7) (\"individuals with disabilities ... have been faced with restrictions and limitations, [and] subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, ... based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of such individuals to participate in, and contribute to, society\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The ADA protects such individuals from discriminatory actions by some employers who might erroneously believe the individual's medical condition renders her unable to do the particular job for which she has applied, or who might harbor an irrational prejudice against people suffering from such medical conditions.  Cf. School Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 284-86 &amp; n. 13, 107 S.Ct. 1123, 1129-30 &amp; n. 13, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987) (discussing the purpose of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794 (1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceptually, it seems more consistent with Congress's broad remedial goals in enacting the ADA, and it also makes more sense, to interpret the words \"individual with a disability\" broadly, so the Act's coverage protects more types of people against discrimination.  Even with such a broad view of \"disability,\" the concerns and interests of employers are still amply protected through the Act's other provisions.  For example, the individual with a disability who seeks a job must still be \"qualified,\" i.e., able to perform the essential functions of the job.  42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12111(8), 12112(a) (1994).  Additionally, if an accommodation is required in order to enable the individual to perform some of those job functions, we will examine the reasonableness of that accommodation, including its cost and other burdens on the employer's business operations.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(9), (10);  see also Arline, 480 U.S. at 285, 107 S.Ct. at 1129 (\"[T]he definition of 'handicapped individual' [in &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act] is broad, but only those individuals who are both handicapped and otherwise qualified are eligible for relief.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The structure of the Act supports this conceptual distinction:  the term \"disability\" is defined in &#167; 12102, a general section applicable to all subchapters and to all areas.  The Act thus covers all \"disabled\" individuals and protects their rights to the extent defined in each subchapter.  The terms \"qualified\" and \"reasonable accommodation\" are defined in &#167; 12111, limited to \"Subchapter 1--Employment.\"   This particular subchapter defines and limits the substantive rights and responsibilities of employers and employees (or applicants for employment), balancing the interests of each, in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, within the particular context of employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS argues that, were we to accept a broad definition of \"individual with a disability\" (i.e., if we examine the definition without considering ameliorative measures), then an unacceptably large percentage of the population will fall within the protective umbrella of the ADA.  But that is what Congress intended.  The very first finding Congress listed in the preamble to the Act is that \"some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities, and this number is increasing as the population as a whole is growing older.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(a)(1).  It thus appears that Congress not only considered but actually intended that the ADA's protections sweep broadly, covering a significant portion of the American populace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One example that demonstrates how UPS's interpretation of the statute would be inconsistent with the Act's broad remedial purposes was pointed out by the EEOC in its amicus brief.  Under UPS's interpretation, someone who could not afford treatment for his impairment would be protected by the ADA from discrimination in hiring.  But once he was hired and obtained treatment under the employer's health plan, he would lose the ADA's protection because he would no longer be \"disabled.\"   The employer could then fire him on the basis of his disability without fear of the protective consequences embodied in the ADA.  UPS argues that \"[t]his is simply not true;  such conduct would be the very sort of situation the 'regarded as' prong was designed to cover.\"   Even if such conduct were covered under prong three, that would not mean the same conduct is not also covered under prong one.  Indeed, the House Report specifically mentions \"persons with impairments, such as epilepsy or diabetes, which substantially limit a major life activity\" and says that they are \"covered under the first prong of the definition of disability, even if the effects of the impairment are controlled by medication.\"   House Report at 52 (emphasis added);  see Senate Report at 22.  There is no reason this employee could not be protected under two prongs simultaneously.  In light of the broad remedial purposes of the ADA, see Penny, 128 F.3d at 414, we believe Congress intended the Act to prohibit such a termination under prong one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, UPS's reading would treat differently a plaintiff like Arnold (who takes his medications and thus would not be protected by the ADA, according to UPS) and a plaintiff who is also diabetic (i.e., suffering from the same medical condition as Arnold) but who cannot afford to take his medications.  The latter plaintiff would be protected by the ADA according to UPS's analysis, but Arnold would not.  We do not think Congress intended such an anomalous result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arnold's diabetes makes him just the type of person the ADA was designed to protect.  He would have been hired by UPS but for his inability to get a commercial vehicle license, which was prevented only because he had diabetes (the underlying medical condition, without taking into account ameliorative treatment).  But Arnold alleges that, with treatment, he can perform the job despite his impairment if UPS will reasonably accommodate him.  This would ordinarily be a factual question on the merits for the court to determine.  Yet under UPS's and the district court's interpretation of the ADA, a person in this archetypical situation is not protected from discrimination by the ADA because he is not disabled and hence not even a proper plaintiff under the Act.  According to UPS, in such circumstances, the trier of fact never gets to the merits of the alleged discrimination, of the \"qualified individual\" requirement, or of reasonable accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS's interpretation fails because, by \"confus[ing] the disease with its treatment,\" Matczak v. Frankford Candy &amp; Chocolate Co., 136 F.3d 933, 937 (3d Cir.1997), it conflates two separate parts of the ADA.  The determination as to whether an individual is \"disabled\" is a threshold issue;  if one is not disabled, then one is not protected by the ADA against discrimination.  See Soileau, 105 F.3d at 15.   Once a person is determined to be covered by the ADA, then that person has a right not to be discriminated against in employment (inter alia) on the basis of her disability, as long as she is qualified for the job, with or without a reasonable accommodation.  Were we to adopt UPS's position in this case, a plaintiff would have to prove that she is \"substantially limited\" even with ameliorative medication--and therefore possibly unable to perform some of the essential elements of the job--in order just to be covered by the ADA's protective umbrella.  Thus, under UPS's interpretation, the employer could avoid liability for discrimination by excluding the plaintiff from the ADA's coverage, without giving the applicant an opportunity to show that she is qualified for the job (with or without a reasonable accommodation), with ameliorative medication.  See Robert L. Burgdorf, Jr., The Americans With Disabilities Act:  Analysis and Implications of a Second-Generation Civil Rights Statute, 26 Harv.  C.R.-C.L. L.Rev. 413, 448 (1991) (describing this as a \"Catch-22 situation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the policy concerns that UPS raises in its brief can be addressed in the discrimination determination, i.e., the determination of whether the plaintiff is otherwise qualified for the job or can be made so with a reasonable accommodation.  UPS will have every opportunity to demonstrate that Arnold is unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of the job.  Indeed, the burden will be on Arnold to demonstrate that he is qualified for the job.  UPS will also be free to try to show that any accommodations Arnold needs would be too expensive or otherwise too burdensome to be considered \"reasonable.\"   But none of UPS's articulated concerns are applicable at the threshold stage where the court is determining whether the individual is disabled and therefore protected by the ADA in the first place.  Thus, contrary to UPS's reading, the ADA's definition of \"disability\" is most consistent with the broad purposes of the statute if Arnold's impairment and its effects are evaluated in their untreated state, without the ameliorative effect of medications on his underlying medical condition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evaluating the statutory language of the ADA in light of the legislative history and the broad remedial purposes of the Act, we conclude that Congress intended a reviewing court to evaluate Arnold's disability based on his underlying medical condition without considering the ameliorative effects of his insulin medication.  The district court erred in holding to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the legislative history were not clear on this point, the court also erred in failing to afford adequate consideration to the similar interpretation set forth by the EEOC in its guidelines.  The ADA authorizes--indeed \"requires\"--the EEOC to \"issue regulations in an accessible format to carry out\" the Act. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12116 (1994).  Pursuant to that authority, the EEOC has promulgated regulations, attached to which as an appendix it has compiled guidelines for interpreting the statute.  According to those guidelines, the determinations of whether an individual has an \"impairment\" and whether that impairment \"substantially limits a major life activity\" should be made \"on a case by case basis, without regard to mitigating measures such as medicines, or assistive or prosthetic devices.\"   EEOC Interpretive Guidance, 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, App. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(h) (1997) (physical impairment) and 1630.2(j) (substantially limits) (noting that \"a diabetic who without insulin would lapse into a coma would be substantially limited because the individual cannot perform major life activities without the aid of medication\" (citing Senate Report at 23;  House Labor Report at 52)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the EEOC interpretive guidelines are not controlling in the way that regulations promulgated pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552, are controlling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Nevertheless, such interpretive guidelines \" 'do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.' \"  Meritor Sav.

See supra at Parts C and D. Moreover, this court has previously \"looked to\" the same body of EEOC Interpretive Guidance that is at issue here, 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, App. &#167; 1630, to illuminate our efforts to \"interpret[ ] the ADA.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Grenier, 70 F.3d at 672;  see Carparts Distrib.  Ctr. v. Automotive Wholesaler's Ass'n, Inc., 37 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1994).  In addition, the reasonableness of the EEOC's interpretation is bolstered by a virtually identical interpretation by the United States Department of Justice, which is charged with enforcing the ADA's prohibition of discrimination based on disability on the part of state and local governmental entities.  See 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App.  A &#167; 35.104 (\"disability should be assessed without regard to the availability of mitigating measures\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant UPS claims that the EEOC's interpretation (and, inferentially, the Justice Department's) reads the words \"substantially limits\" out of the statute.  The Eleventh Circuit rejected this argument in Harris v. H &amp; W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 521 (11th Cir.1996), and so do we.  UPS's argument essentially begs the question.  The key question is whether the statutory word \"impairment\" refers to treated or untreated impairments.  The \"substantially limits\" requirement pertains to the impairment referred to in the first part of the definitional sentence, regardless of whether that impairment is read to mean the condition in its treated or untreated state.  Thus, far from reading that requirement out of the statute, the EEOC's interpretive guideline helps to clarify an ambiguity in the statute, and places the statutory words \"substantially limits\" in proper relation to the impairment.  The guideline reads \"substantially limits\" as referring to the untreated impairment rather than the treated impairment.  The trier of fact must still decide whether the untreated impairment \"substantially limits\" any major life activity before the untreated impairment constitutes a \"disability\" within the meaning of the ADA.  This is a permissible reading of the ambiguous statutory language.  Id. Surely, nothing in the language of the Act rules out this approach.  Indeed, as noted supra, at least with respect to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Congress appears to have had such an interpretation specifically in mind.  See House Labor Report at 51-52;  Senate Report at 22-23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS further argues that the EEOC \"must be saying\" that a person taking insulin is per se significantly restricted.  This claim is also meritless.  Nowhere does the EEOC interpretive guideline say that any particular medical condition would per se be treated as a disability or that any similar per se rule should apply.  On the contrary, the EEOC regulations and guidelines emphasize the requirement that every person's situation be treated individually.  See Appendix to Part 1630, \"Background\" (observing that \"[t]his case-by-case approach is essential\");  29 C.F.R. Part 1630, App. &#167; 1630.2(j) (Determinations of \"impairment\" and \"substantial limit[ation]\" should be made \"on a case by case basis.\");  id.  (\"Some impairments may be disabling for particular individuals but not for others.\").  Again, the only question before us is whether the impairment whose effects are evaluated in this case-by-case approach is the treated or the untreated medical condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS's argument blurs the distinction between our analytical process or methodology, on the one hand, and the substantive conclusion that results from that process.  The EEOC's reading of the statute does not become a per se rule simply because, when an individualized evaluation is applied to individuals who have a particular medical condition, the result will almost always turn out to be the same.  For example, even under UPS's reading of the statute, virtually all quadriplegics will probably be found to qualify as \"individuals with disabilities\" under the ADA, but this result does not mean courts are applying a per se rule rather than an individualized analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>F</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the majority of federal circuit courts that have considered this issue have followed the EEOC interpretation that ameliorative measures should not be considered in determining whether an impairment substantially limits an individual's major life activities.

Matczak, Doane, Roth, and Harris do not merely \"acknowledge\" the \"existence\" of the guidelines.  They state a principle of law--that ameliorative medications are not to be considered in determining whether an individual is disabled and therefore protected by the ADA from discrimination--and then cite the EEOC guidelines as one ground in support of this principle.  See Matczak, 136 F.3d at 936-37;  Doane, 115 F.3d at 627 (stating that \"analysis of whether [plaintiff] is disabled does not include consideration of mitigating measures\");  Roth, 57 F.3d at 1454;  Harris, 102 F.3d at 521 (concluding that the EEOC's interpretation is \"firmly rooted in the ADA's legislative history\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS is correct that the Harris court, in reaching the same conclusion, applied full Chevron deference to the EEOC's guidelines, rather than the lesser degree of deference that Meritor requires for interpretive rules that have not undergone the full APA promulgation process.  See Meritor, 477 U.S. at 65, 106 S.Ct. at 2404-05;  see also supra at 22.   But the conclusion in Harris remains valid, including its determination that the EEOC's interpretation of the ADA is a permissible one.  UPS has no persuasive rebuttal to the lesser degree of deference that we have applied pursuant to Meritor--giving some consideration to the EEOC's interpretation.  Like the Harris court, we find the EEOC's interpretation to be consistent with the ADA's legislative history, as outlined supra, and with the overall protective purpose of the ADA;  the interpretation is therefore permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that the ADA protects Arnold from discrimination if he is disabled based on his underlying medical condition, without regard to whether some of his limitations are ameliorated through medication or other treatment.  This holding is based on the facts of this case and is limited to the condition presented here, namely diabetes mellitus.  We venture no opinion as to whether we would reach the same conclusion if other medical conditions or other facts were presented.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  We conclude in this case that the EEOC's guidelines are worthy of consideration and that Arnold's diabetes, in its untreated state, is a disability protected from discrimination by the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

(UPS), alleging that UPS refused to hire him because of his disability, diabetes mellitus, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq.   The district court granted summary judgment to UPS, on the ground that Arnold had not shown that he had a disability and therefore was not protected by the ADA's antidiscrimination provision.  In making its determination, the court considered Arnold's diabetes in its treated state, after taking into account the ameliorative effects of his insulin medication.  Arnold appeals, arguing that such an analysis was legally erroneous, inconsistent with the ADA and with the EEOC's interpretive regulations.  He also argues that the facts he has introduced prove that he satisfies the statutory definition of an \"individual with a disability,\" and that UPS has failed to demonstrate that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  UPS argues that the district court's analysis of Arnold's disability was proper, including its consideration of ameliorative medication.  As an alternative ground for upholding the grant of summary judgment, UPS contends that federal regulations required it to deny Arnold's application for employment, and UPS is thereby entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  We reverse and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant UPS, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, Arnold.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1013</span></span> (1997).  Plaintiff-Appellant Glen Arnold has Type I insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  As such, he is required to monitor his blood glucose levels throughout the day, and give himself injections of insulin two to four times a day.  He is also required to pay constant attention to possible signs of hypoglycemia, and to follow a strict diet and exercise regimen to control the disease.  His physician states that Arnold would die in the absence of his insulin injections.  Arnold has successfully controlled his diabetes for twenty-three years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October, 1995, Arnold telephoned a human resources representative at UPS about applying for the position of \"cover mechanic.\"   The position called for covering the shifts of night-time mechanics in four locations:  Wells, Maine, and Dover, Laconia, and Twin Mountain, New Hampshire.  Arnold had worked as an automotive mechanic for six years, and had obtained an associate degree in automotive technology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the initial phone conversation, Arnold met in person with both the human resources representative for UPS, Paul Tanguay, and with John Kennedy, UPS's fleet supervisor for its North New Hampshire division.  By all accounts, both meetings went well.  As a result, Kennedy indicated to Arnold that the job was his if he wanted it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Arnold contacted Kennedy, and said that he wanted the job.  The two agreed on an October 16, 1995 start date.  Arnold was informed shortly thereafter that he would be required to pass a driving test, have his fingerprints taken, fill out additional paperwork, and submit to a Department of Transportation (DOT) physical.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On or about October 12, 1995, Arnold filled out the paperwork, was fingerprinted, and passed the driving test.  He was then sent to a local health care facility, Seacoast Redicare, for the DOT physical.  At the physical, Arnold, responding to a question from the physician, indicated that he was an insulin-dependent diabetic.  The physician informed him that DOT regulations preclude insulin-dependent diabetics from obtaining the DOT certification required to operate commercial motor vehicles.  On return to UPS, Tanguay informed Arnold that UPS could not hire him because he was unable to obtain DOT certification.  Tanguay instead offered Arnold an alternate position, as a package \"pre-loader,\" a position which provides substantially lower pay.  Arnold did not respond to this alternate job offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arnold instituted this action on October 9, 1996 in the United States District Court for the District of Maine under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq., and the Maine Human Rights Act, 5 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4551 et seq.   On March 14, 1997, after discovery had been completed, UPS filed a motion for summary judgment.  On May 5, 1997, Magistrate Judge David Cohen submitted his Recommended Decision, ruling in favor of UPS on the grounds that, because Arnold's diabetes was effectively controlled by insulin injections, he was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA.  On May 30, 1997, the district court (Hornby, J.) affirmed Magistrate Judge Cohen's recommendation, and entered judgment in favor of UPS.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The district court determined that, as a matter of law, Arnold was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA, because his insulin-dependent diabetic condition did not substantially limit one or more of his major life activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court addressed the question of substantial limitation by analyzing Arnold's diabetic condition after he took his ameliorative medications, rather than analyzing his unameliorated diabetes.

If the text is not unambiguously clear, however, we are obliged to turn to other sources to discern the legislature's meaning.  One important source, of course, is the legislative history.

The statute defines \"disability\" to mean \"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual;  (B) a record of such an impairment;  or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2) (1994).  An individual must meet one of these three prongs in order to be covered under the ADA.  If an individual is not \"disabled\" within the meaning of one of the three prongs, the ADA does not protect that person against discrimination on the basis of his disability, and we need not proceed beyond this threshold issue to determine either whether any adverse action has been taken based upon the person's disability or whether the employer should have reasonably accommodated that disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute does not itself define the terms \"impairment,\" \"substantially limits,\" or \"major life activity,\" all of which could have more than one meaning.  In particular, the statute does not indicate whether medications, prosthetic devices, or other ameliorative treatments should be considered by a court in determining whether an individual suffers from an impairment and whether such impairment substantially limits a major life activity.  \"The statute certainly does not say 'impairment plus treatment' or 'impairment after treatment' or 'treated impairment';  it just says 'impairment.' \"  Sicard v.

But even as to the \"ordinary or natural meanings\" of the ADA's words, reasonable minds can differ, especially regarding whether ameliorative measures should be taken into account in determining whether an individual is disabled within the meaning of the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS argues that the statutory language plainly and unambiguously requires consideration of the impairment as treated with all ameliorative medications and other measures.  In UPS's words, \"substantially limits means substantially limits.\"   But this formulation begs the question.  The ambiguous issue is whether the ADA's reference to an \"impairment\" (which might or might not substantially limit a major life activity) means an impairment without treatment or an impairment after treatment.  The word \"impairment\" could conceivably be read to mean \"impairment after the underlying condition is treated with ameliorative therapy,\" which is essentially the way the district court interpreted it.  Or the word could be read to mean \"impairment that results from the underlying condition in the absence of any ameliorative treatment,\" as the EEOC and the Justice Department have read it.  The statutory language, on its face, gives no clue as to which interpretation Congress intended.  Certainly that language does not plainly and unambiguously refute Arnold's contention that his underlying medical condition--diabetes mellitus--constitutes an \"impairment\" that is protected by the ADA.  Similarly, \"[a]lthough the term 'substantially limits' may be unambiguous in and of itself, it nonetheless does not speak to the issue before [us];  that is, the statute is silent as to whether a substantial limitation is to be considered with or without regard to mitigating measures.\"  Wilson v.

Both the explicit language and the illustrative examples included in the ADA's legislative history make it abundantly clear that Congress intended the analysis of an \"impairment\" and of the question whether it \"substantially limits a major life activity\" to be made on the basis of the underlying (physical or mental) condition, without considering the ameliorative effects of medication, prostheses, or other mitigating measures.  For example, the House and Senate Committee reports explicitly state that, in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, the impairment \"should be assessed without considering whether mitigating measures, such as auxiliary aids or reasonable accommodations, would result in a less-than-substantial limitation.\"   H.R.Rep.

The district court reasoned that the Senate Report's allusion to uncontrolled diabetes in the context of prong three demonstrates that Congress did not intend uncontrolled medical conditions to be included in prong one of the definition of \"disability.\"   But the district court has no explanation for why the Senate Report had previously said, in its discussion of prong one, that the question \"whether a person has a disability should be assessed without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids.\"   Senate Report at 23.

The fundamental purpose of the ADA is \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(b)(1) (1994).  In the context of employment discrimination, the thrust of this purpose is essentially to protect individuals who have an underlying medical condition or other limiting impairment, but who are in fact capable of doing the job, with or without the help of medications, prosthetic devices, or other ameliorative measures, and with or without a reasonable accommodation by the employer.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(a)(7) (\"individuals with disabilities ... have been faced with restrictions and limitations, [and] subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, ... based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of such individuals to participate in, and contribute to, society\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The ADA protects such individuals from discriminatory actions by some employers who might erroneously believe the individual's medical condition renders her unable to do the particular job for which she has applied, or who might harbor an irrational prejudice against people suffering from such medical conditions.

Even with such a broad view of \"disability,\" the concerns and interests of employers are still amply protected through the Act's other provisions.  For example, the individual with a disability who seeks a job must still be \"qualified,\" i.e., able to perform the essential functions of the job.  42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12111(8), 12112(a) (1994).  Additionally, if an accommodation is required in order to enable the individual to perform some of those job functions, we will examine the reasonableness of that accommodation, including its cost and other burdens on the employer's business operations.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(9), (10);  see also Arline, 480 U.S. at 285, 107 S.Ct. at 1129 (\"[T]he definition of 'handicapped individual' [in &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act] is broad, but only those individuals who are both handicapped and otherwise qualified are eligible for relief.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The structure of the Act supports this conceptual distinction:  the term \"disability\" is defined in &#167; 12102, a general section applicable to all subchapters and to all areas.  The Act thus covers all \"disabled\" individuals and protects their rights to the extent defined in each subchapter.  The terms \"qualified\" and \"reasonable accommodation\" are defined in &#167; 12111, limited to \"Subchapter 1--Employment.\"   This particular subchapter defines and limits the substantive rights and responsibilities of employers and employees (or applicants for employment), balancing the interests of each, in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, within the particular context of employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS argues that, were we to accept a broad definition of \"individual with a disability\" (i.e., if we examine the definition without considering ameliorative measures), then an unacceptably large percentage of the population will fall within the protective umbrella of the ADA.  But that is what Congress intended.  The very first finding Congress listed in the preamble to the Act is that \"some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities, and this number is increasing as the population as a whole is growing older.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(a)(1).  It thus appears that Congress not only considered but actually intended that the ADA's protections sweep broadly, covering a significant portion of the American populace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One example that demonstrates how UPS's interpretation of the statute would be inconsistent with the Act's broad remedial purposes was pointed out by the EEOC in its amicus brief.  Under UPS's interpretation, someone who could not afford treatment for his impairment would be protected by the ADA from discrimination in hiring.  But once he was hired and obtained treatment under the employer's health plan, he would lose the ADA's protection because he would no longer be \"disabled.\"   The employer could then fire him on the basis of his disability without fear of the protective consequences embodied in the ADA.  UPS argues that \"[t]his is simply not true;  such conduct would be the very sort of situation the 'regarded as' prong was designed to cover.\"   Even if such conduct were covered under prong three, that would not mean the same conduct is not also covered under prong one.  Indeed, the House Report specifically mentions \"persons with impairments, such as epilepsy or diabetes, which substantially limit a major life activity\" and says that they are \"covered under the first prong of the definition of disability, even if the effects of the impairment are controlled by medication.\"   House Report at 52 (emphasis added);  see Senate Report at 22.  There is no reason this employee could not be protected under two prongs simultaneously.  In light of the broad remedial purposes of the ADA, see Penny, 128 F.3d at 414, we believe Congress intended the Act to prohibit such a termination under prong one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, UPS's reading would treat differently a plaintiff like Arnold (who takes his medications and thus would not be protected by the ADA, according to UPS) and a plaintiff who is also diabetic (i.e., suffering from the same medical condition as Arnold) but who cannot afford to take his medications.  The latter plaintiff would be protected by the ADA according to UPS's analysis, but Arnold would not.  We do not think Congress intended such an anomalous result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arnold's diabetes makes him just the type of person the ADA was designed to protect.  He would have been hired by UPS but for his inability to get a commercial vehicle license, which was prevented only because he had diabetes (the underlying medical condition, without taking into account ameliorative treatment).  But Arnold alleges that, with treatment, he can perform the job despite his impairment if UPS will reasonably accommodate him.  This would ordinarily be a factual question on the merits for the court to determine.  Yet under UPS's and the district court's interpretation of the ADA, a person in this archetypical situation is not protected from discrimination by the ADA because he is not disabled and hence not even a proper plaintiff under the Act.  According to UPS, in such circumstances, the trier of fact never gets to the merits of the alleged discrimination, of the \"qualified individual\" requirement, or of reasonable accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS's interpretation fails because, by \"confus[ing] the disease with its treatment,\" Matczak v.

The determination as to whether an individual is \"disabled\" is a threshold issue;  if one is not disabled, then one is not protected by the ADA against discrimination.  See Soileau, 105 F.3d at 15.   Once a person is determined to be covered by the ADA, then that person has a right not to be discriminated against in employment (inter alia) on the basis of her disability, as long as she is qualified for the job, with or without a reasonable accommodation.  Were we to adopt UPS's position in this case, a plaintiff would have to prove that she is \"substantially limited\" even with ameliorative medication--and therefore possibly unable to perform some of the essential elements of the job--in order just to be covered by the ADA's protective umbrella.  Thus, under UPS's interpretation, the employer could avoid liability for discrimination by excluding the plaintiff from the ADA's coverage, without giving the applicant an opportunity to show that she is qualified for the job (with or without a reasonable accommodation), with ameliorative medication.  See Robert L. Burgdorf, Jr., The Americans With Disabilities Act:  Analysis and Implications of a Second-Generation Civil Rights Statute, 26 Harv.  C.R.-C.L. L.Rev. 413, 448 (1991) (describing this as a \"Catch-22 situation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the policy concerns that UPS raises in its brief can be addressed in the discrimination determination, i.e., the determination of whether the plaintiff is otherwise qualified for the job or can be made so with a reasonable accommodation.  UPS will have every opportunity to demonstrate that Arnold is unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of the job.  Indeed, the burden will be on Arnold to demonstrate that he is qualified for the job.  UPS will also be free to try to show that any accommodations Arnold needs would be too expensive or otherwise too burdensome to be considered \"reasonable.\"   But none of UPS's articulated concerns are applicable at the threshold stage where the court is determining whether the individual is disabled and therefore protected by the ADA in the first place.  Thus, contrary to UPS's reading, the ADA's definition of \"disability\" is most consistent with the broad purposes of the statute if Arnold's impairment and its effects are evaluated in their untreated state, without the ameliorative effect of medications on his underlying medical condition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evaluating the statutory language of the ADA in light of the legislative history and the broad remedial purposes of the Act, we conclude that Congress intended a reviewing court to evaluate Arnold's disability based on his underlying medical condition without considering the ameliorative effects of his insulin medication.

The ADA authorizes--indeed \"requires\"--the EEOC to \"issue regulations in an accessible format to carry out\" the Act. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12116 (1994).  Pursuant to that authority, the EEOC has promulgated regulations, attached to which as an appendix it has compiled guidelines for interpreting the statute.  According to those guidelines, the determinations of whether an individual has an \"impairment\" and whether that impairment \"substantially limits a major life activity\" should be made \"on a case by case basis, without regard to mitigating measures such as medicines, or assistive or prosthetic devices.\"   EEOC Interpretive Guidance, 29 C.F.R.

H &amp; W Contracting Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"731052\"><a href=\"/opinion/731052/ellen-t-harris-v-h-w-contracting-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>, 521 (11th Cir.1996), and so do we.  UPS's argument essentially begs the question.  The key question is whether the statutory word \"impairment\" refers to treated or untreated impairments.  The \"substantially limits\" requirement pertains to the impairment referred to in the first part of the definitional sentence, regardless of whether that impairment is read to mean the condition in its treated or untreated state.  Thus, far from reading that requirement out of the statute, the EEOC's interpretive guideline helps to clarify an ambiguity in the statute, and places the statutory words \"substantially limits\" in proper relation to the impairment.  The guideline reads \"substantially limits\" as referring to the untreated impairment rather than the treated impairment.  The trier of fact must still decide whether the untreated impairment \"substantially limits\" any major life activity before the untreated impairment constitutes a \"disability\" within the meaning of the ADA.  This is a permissible reading of the ambiguous statutory language.  Id. Surely, nothing in the language of the Act rules out this approach.  Indeed, as noted supra, at least with respect to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Congress appears to have had such an interpretation specifically in mind.  See House Labor Report at 51-52;  Senate Report at 22-23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS further argues that the EEOC \"must be saying\" that a person taking insulin is per se significantly restricted.  This claim is also meritless.  Nowhere does the EEOC interpretive guideline say that any particular medical condition would per se be treated as a disability or that any similar per se rule should apply.  On the contrary, the EEOC regulations and guidelines emphasize the requirement that every person's situation be treated individually.  See Appendix to Part 1630, \"Background\" (observing that \"[t]his case-by-case approach is essential\");  29 C.F.R. Part 1630, App. &#167; 1630.2(j) (Determinations of \"impairment\" and \"substantial limit[ation]\" should be made \"on a case by case basis.\");  id.  (\"Some impairments may be disabling for particular individuals but not for others.\").  Again, the only question before us is whether the impairment whose effects are evaluated in this case-by-case approach is the treated or the untreated medical condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS's argument blurs the distinction between our analytical process or methodology, on the one hand, and the substantive conclusion that results from that process.  The EEOC's reading of the statute does not become a per se rule simply because, when an individualized evaluation is applied to individuals who have a particular medical condition, the result will almost always turn out to be the same.  For example, even under UPS's reading of the statute, virtually all quadriplegics will probably be found to qualify as \"individuals with disabilities\" under the ADA, but this result does not mean courts are applying a per se rule rather than an individualized analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>F</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the majority of federal circuit courts that have considered this issue have followed the EEOC interpretation that ameliorative measures should not be considered in determining whether an impairment substantially limits an individual's major life activities.

Matczak, Doane, Roth, and Harris do not merely \"acknowledge\" the \"existence\" of the guidelines.  They state a principle of law--that ameliorative medications are not to be considered in determining whether an individual is disabled and therefore protected by the ADA from discrimination--and then cite the EEOC guidelines as one ground in support of this principle.  See Matczak, 136 F.3d at 936-37;  Doane, 115 F.3d at 627 (stating that \"analysis of whether [plaintiff] is disabled does not include consideration of mitigating measures\");  Roth, 57 F.3d at 1454;  Harris, 102 F.3d at 521 (concluding that the EEOC's interpretation is \"firmly rooted in the ADA's legislative history\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS is correct that the Harris court, in reaching the same conclusion, applied full Chevron deference to the EEOC's guidelines, rather than the lesser degree of deference that Meritor requires for interpretive rules that have not undergone the full APA promulgation process.  See Meritor, 477 U.S. at 65, 106 S.Ct. at 2404-05;  see also supra at 22.   But the conclusion in Harris remains valid, including its determination that the EEOC's interpretation of the ADA is a permissible one.  UPS has no persuasive rebuttal to the lesser degree of deference that we have applied pursuant to Meritor--giving some consideration to the EEOC's interpretation.  Like the Harris court, we find the EEOC's interpretation to be consistent with the ADA's legislative history, as outlined supra, and with the overall protective purpose of the ADA;  the interpretation is therefore permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that the ADA protects Arnold from discrimination if he is disabled based on his underlying medical condition, without regard to whether some of his limitations are ameliorated through medication or other treatment.
