The primary issue presented in this landlord-\n\ntenant case is the proper application of the security deposit\n\n\n     1\n         Fadi Karaa.\n     2\n       China Real Estate Development Investment & Trust Fund\nCorporation and Chiung Fong.\n\f                                                                      2\n\n\nprovisions in G. L. c. 186, § 15B.    The residential property was\n\nowned by Shoreh Karaa and Fadi Karaa (collectively, the Karaas),\n\nand rented by China Real Estate Development Investment & Trust\n\nFund Corporation (CREDIT), Kuk Yim, and Chiung Fong\n\n(collectively, the tenants).    After a bench trial, the Superior\n\nCourt judge found that the tenants had breached their lease with\n\nthe Karaas, and that the tenants' obligations under the lease\n\nwere not excused under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\n\nThe judge also found that the Karaas were not liable for alleged\n\nviolations of G. L. c. 186, § 15B, stemming from their\n\nmishandling of the tenants' security deposit.     The judge further\n\ndetermined that the Karaas had not committed fraud or breached\n\nthe covenant of quiet enjoyment, that they properly had\n\nmitigated their damages, and that they were not liable for\n\nalleged violations of G. L. c. 93A.    The trial judge did find,\n\nhowever, that the Karaas were liable under G. L. c. 186,\n\n§ 15B(2)(a), for their failure to pay interest on the tenants'\n\nlast month's rent.    On appeal, the tenants take issue with the\n\ntrial judge's holdings in favor of the Karaas.     We affirm.\n\n    Background.      In March, 2010, the Karaas placed their home\n\nlocated at 83 Spring Valley Road in Belmont (property) up for\n\nrent at $4,500 per month through listings on the Internet site\n\n\"Craigslist\" and with a real estate agent.     On May 10, 2010, the\n\ntenants and the Karaas entered into a written lease agreement\n\f                                                                    3\n\n\nfor the property at a reduced rent of $4,300 per month, with a\n\nstarting date of June 16, 2010.   The lease was for one year and\n\nfifteen days.   The lessees initially listed on the lease were\n\nCREDIT and Yim, as the lease was signed by Yim both in her\n\npersonal capacity and in her capacity as chief financial officer\n\nfor CREDIT.   Subsequently, a new cover page to the lease was\n\nsubstituted, listing Yim and Fong as lessees.   This change was\n\nmade to allow their children to attend school in Belmont.\n\n     At the time Yim signed the lease, the tenants gave the\n\nKaraas a check for $8,600, which included $4,300 for a security\n\ndeposit and $4,300 for the last month's rent.   Shoreh3 requested\n\na tax identification or Social Security number so that she could\n\nopen an escrow account to deposit the funds, and the tenants\n\nresponded that they would provide the number at a later date.\n\nShoreh deposited the check into her own interest-bearing account\n\nthe same day the lease was signed.   Over the course of the\n\ntenancy, the tenants never provided the Karaas a tax\n\nidentification or Social Security number.   Though the Karaas\n\npreviously had leased other properties and knew that they were\n\nrequired to segregate the security deposit from their personal\n\naccount and to provide the tenants with a receipt in compliance\n\nwith G. L. c. 186, § 15B, they did not do so.\n\n\n     3\n       We use the first names of the Karaas, where applicable, to\navoid confusion.\n\f                                                                    4\n\n\n     In August of 2010, Fong and Yim, and their children,\n\ntraveled to China.   They intended to return to Belmont later\n\nthat month, but due to complications with their visas, they were\n\nunable to reenter the United States.    The tenants paid rent for\n\nAugust, September, and October.4    On October 26, 2010, Yim sent\n\nthe Karaas an electronic mail message (e-mail) stating that,\n\nbecause the visa applications for herself and the three children\n\nhad been rejected, they would not be able to return to the\n\nUnited States, and that the tenants therefore would be\n\nterminating the lease.    She stated that the Karaas should apply\n\nthe tenants' earlier check of $8,600 to cover the November rent\n\nand as \"compensation\" for the termination of the lease.     Yim\n\nfurther stated that Fong would be returning to the United States\n\naround November 15 and would arrange for the move and any\n\nnecessary paperwork.\n\n     In early December, the Karaas posted the house for rent on\n\nCraigslist and with a real estate agent.    Because of their past\n\nexperience leasing other properties, the Karaas were aware that\n\nit likely would be more difficult to lease the property during\n\nthe winter months.     They eventually relet the house for $4,200\n\nper month beginning April 1, 2011.    On September 30, 2011, the\n\nKaraas brought a two-count complaint against the tenants for\n\n\n     4\n       The tenants earlier had paid rent covering June 16 through\nJuly 31.\n\f                                                                   5\n\n\nbreach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing.   Prior to litigation, the Karaas sent\n\nthe tenants a check, dated September 25, 2011, for $4,604.88 for\n\n\"security deposit return.\"5   The Karaas did not pay the tenants\n\nany interest on the last month's rent.\n\n     In response, Yim brought counterclaims alleging that the\n\nKaraas breached the lease by failing to deliver the entire\n\nproperty, did not comply with the statutory requirements of the\n\nsecurity deposit statute and the last month's rent statute, and\n\nengaged in unfair and deceptive practices in violation of G. L.\n\nc. 93A.   Yim additionally claimed that her purpose in entering\n\nthe lease, i.e., to allow her children to attend school in\n\nBelmont, was frustrated by circumstances beyond her control, the\n\nrejection of their visa applications.    Lastly, Yim claimed the\n\nKaraas failed to mitigate their damages subsequent to the\n\nbreach.\n\n     After a jury-waived trial, the judge found for the Karaas,\n\nawarding them $19,861,6 plus statutory interest of $5,106.23, and\n\n\n     5\n       The Karaas voluntarily added twelve percent interest to\nthis amount.\n     6\n       The judge arrived at $19,861 by calculating as follows:\nrent of $4,300 per month for the seven-month period from\nDecember 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011 ($30,100); utilities for\nDecember of 2010, through March of 2011 ($1,800); and the real\nestate agent's fee of $750, for a total of $32,650. Subtracted\nfrom this amount was the rent collected from the successor\ntenant for the months of April, May, and June, 2011 ($4,200 per\n\f                                                                      6\n\n\nattorney's fees in the amount of $24,098.70.7     The judge included\n\nan offset of $189 for trebled interest on Yim's last month's\n\nrent deposit,8 though the judge otherwise dismissed the\n\ncounterclaims.\n\n     Discussion.     1.   The tenants' obligations under the lease.\n\nA.   Yim's frustration of purpose defense.    Yim cannot be excused\n\nfrom her obligation under the lease to pay rent on the basis of\n\na frustration of purpose argument.     Yim argues that her\n\nprincipal purpose in leasing the property was to send her\n\ndaughter to school in Belmont, and that once her and her\n\nfamily's visa applications were rejected, thereby preventing\n\nthem from reentering the United States, this purpose was\n\nsubstantially frustrated.     Yim maintains that this frustration\n\ndischarged her obligations under the lease.\n\n     The Supreme Judicial Court has held that the doctrine of\n\nfrustration of purpose is a companion rule to the doctrine of\n\nimpossibility.     See Mishara Constr. Co. v. Transit-Mixed\n\n\nmonth, totaling $12,600), and $189 for interest due to Yim on\nthe last month's rent.\n     7\n       The terms of the lease provided the basis for the award of\nattorney's fees.\n     8\n       The judge held that because the Karaas paid no interest on\nthe last month's rent payment of $4,300, Yim was entitled to\nrecover five percent interest on that amount from June 16, 2010,\nthe date of commencement of the tenancy, through October 31,\n2010, the last day she paid rent for the premises. That\namounted to sixty-three dollars, which then was trebled in\naccordance with the statute. G. L. c. 186, § 15B(2)(a).\n\f                                                                        7\n\n\nConcrete Corp., 365 Mass. 122, 128-129 (1974); Chase Precast\n\nCorp. v. John J. Paonessa Co., 409 Mass. 371, 374 (1991).       \"The\n\nprincipal question in both kinds of cases remains whether an\n\nunanticipated circumstance, the risk of which should not fairly\n\nbe thrown on the promisor, has made performance vitally\n\ndifferent from what was reasonably to be expected.\"     Chase\n\nPrecast Corp., supra (citations omitted).     When applying the\n\ndoctrine of frustration of purpose, a judge must consider \"the\n\nforeseeability of the supervening event, allocation of the risk\n\nof occurrence of the event, and the degree of hardship to the\n\npromisor.\"    Id. at 375 n.4.   Given the importance of the factual\n\ncontext surrounding the lease agreement, the determination of\n\nthese questions is reserved for the trier of fact.    See Mishara\n\nConstr. Co., supra at 127, 130; Chase Precast Corp., supra at\n\n376.    In the case before us, the trial judge found the tenants'\n\nvisa problems to be a foreseeable risk.\n\n       \"[A] contracting party cannot be excused where the only\n\n'frustration' consists in the fact that known risks assumed by\n\nhim have turned out to his disadvantage.\"     Baetjer v. New\n\nEngland Alcohol Co., 319 Mass. 592, 602 (1946).     See Essex-\n\nLincoln Garage, Inc. v. Boston, 342 Mass. 719, 721 (1961).        The\n\ntrial judge found that Yim \"knew or should have known that there\n\nwas a possibility that the family's visa status might change,\n\nand she voluntarily undertook that risk.\"     The record supports\n\f                                                                    8\n\n\nthis conclusion.9   Thus, the trial judge was correct in finding\n\nthat the doctrine of frustration of purpose did not excuse the\n\ntenants' obligations under the lease.\n\n     B.   CREDIT's obligations under the lease.   The tenants\n\nposit that CREDIT should not be held liable for breach of the\n\nlease due to the later substitution of the lease cover page,\n\nwhich listed Yim and Fong, not CREDIT, as tenants.   However, the\n\ntenants did not raise this issue in their pleadings or at trial.\n\nTherefore, we decline to consider this argument, as it was not\n\nproperly preserved for appeal.   See Milton v. Civil Serv.\n\nCommn., 365 Mass. 368, 379 (1974); R.W. Granger & Sons, Inc. v.\n\n     9\n       As stated in Yim's testimony at trial, the tenants planned\ntheir trip to China in large part because, though Yim had been\ngranted L-1A status as of April 15, 2010, she and her children\nwould need to reenter the country in order to secure their\nvisas. L-1A visas are available to executives and managers of\ninternational companies, and allow these foreign employees to\nrelocate to their company's United States office or, for those\nforeign companies that do not yet have affiliated United States\noffices, allow them to send an executive or manager to the\nUnited States to help establish a United States office or\nsubsidiary. In order to qualify, the foreign employee must have\nworked abroad for the company for at least one continuous year\nwithin the three years prior to their admission into the United\nStates. Yet, Yim had spent the prior three years living in the\nUnited States to care for her children, who were attending\nUnited States schools. The record shows that Yim and Fong\nsubmitted their visa applications months prior to their trip to\nChina, with the assistance of legal counsel. This, in\nconjunction with the trial judge's finding that Yim had prior\nexperience traveling between the United States and China,\nsuggests that Yim knew or should have known that she was in\nviolation of her L-1A status. These facts support the trial\njudge's conclusion that Yim knowingly and voluntarily undertook\nthe risk that she and her family might not be able to reenter\nthe United States.\n\f                                                                   9\n\n\nJ & S Insulation, Inc., 435 Mass. 66, 73-74 (2001); Reading Co-\n\nOp. Bank v. Suffolk Constr. Co., 464 Mass. 543, 545 n.1 (2013).\n\n     2.   Burden to prove mitigation of damages.   The tenants\n\nargued at trial that, despite the underlying breach of the\n\nlease, the Karaas failed to mitigate their damages by diligently\n\nattempting to relet the property.   Nonetheless, the trial judge\n\nheld that the Karaas \"used reasonable precautions to mitigate\n\ntheir damages.\"   In reaching her conclusion, the trial judge\n\nstated that the \"defendant bears the burden of proving that a\n\nplaintiff has failed to mitigate [her] damages . . . [and] Yim\n\nhas failed to meet her burden of proof on this issue.\"    On\n\nappeal, the tenants argue that the trial judge improperly placed\n\nthe burden of proof regarding mitigation on the tenants, and\n\nthat the burden should have been on the Karaas, as the\n\nlandlords.\n\n     Though who bears the burden at trial regarding the\n\nmitigation of damages within the landlord-tenant context is the\n\nsubject of some uncertainty in Massachusetts,10 we need not\n\n\n     10\n       In Woodbury v. Sparrell Print, the Supreme Judicial Court\nheld that, in a claim for unpaid rent after termination of a\ntenancy, the burden falls upon the landlord to show a reasonable\nattempt to mitigate damages: \"When therefore the answer sets up\nneglect of the plaintiffs it must be considered not as a defence\nin the way of confession and avoidance, but as a denial of the\nexistence of one of the essential elements of the case of the\nplaintiffs, namely, due diligence as to reletting. The burden\nof showing due diligence was upon the plaintiffs.\" 198 Mass. 1,\n10 (1908). However, more than eighty years later in Atkinson v.\n\f                                                                     10\n\n\nresolve that issue here, as the trial judge explicitly found\n\nthat the Karaas did in fact mitigate their damages by acting in\n\na \"timely and diligent manner\" based on the evidence provided by\n\nthe Karaas at trial.   As discussed in the judge's order, the\n\nKaraas advertised the house for rent in early December, 2010,\n\napproximately one month after the tenants notified them of their\n\nintention to terminate the tenancy.    The trial judge credited\n\nShoreh's testimony that she and Fadi paid a fee of $750 to a\n\nreal estate agent in an effort to relet the property.    Moreover,\n\nthe Karaas were able to secure a tenant by April of 2011,\n\ndespite the difficulty of the winter rental market.     Regardless\n\nof which party the burden ultimately fell on, the evidence\n\nsupports the trial judge's conclusion that the Karaas indeed\n\nfulfilled their duty to mitigate their damages, and we decline\n\nto overturn such a finding.\n\n    3.   General Laws c. 186, § 15B.    We are confronted with how\n\nto apply the security deposit law requirements and penalties to\n\n\n\nRosenthal, this court took the opposite approach, stating that\n\"the burden of proving that the landlord had not made a\ncommercially reasonable lease, i.e., had not been diligent in\nobtaining a reasonably fair rent, fell on the tenants.\" 33\nMass. App. Ct. 219, 224-225 (1992). The case cited by the trial\njudge, McKenna v. Commissioner of Mental Health, addresses the\nburden of proof issue only in the context of labor and\nemployment. 347 Mass. 674, 676 (1964). For further discussion\nof the uncertainty in the case law, see Daher & Chopp, Landlord\nand Tenant Law § 15:27, at 231-232 (3d ed. 2000); Warshaw,\nMassachusetts Landlord-Tenant Law § 6:10 (2d ed. 2001 & Supp.\n2014).\n\f                                                                    11\n\n\nthe Karaas, who failed to place the security deposit in a\n\nseparate account when their tenants, who terminated the lease\n\nseven months early, offered the security deposit and the last\n\nmonth's rent as compensation for the early termination.     The\n\nKaraas returned the security deposit five months after the\n\ntermination of the lease, shortly before bringing suit for\n\nbreach of the lease for failure to pay rent.     The tenants seek\n\ntreble damages for the failure to segregate the security deposit\n\nand return it to them within thirty days of the termination of\n\nthe lease.   To resolve these claims, we must interpret the\n\ncomplicated interplay between three subsections of G. L. c. 186,\n\n§ 15B:   subsections (3)(a), (6), and (7), particularly as they\n\nhave been interpreted in two prior decisions of this court,\n\nCastenholz v. Caira, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 758 (1986); and Taylor v.\n\nBeaudry, 75 Mass. App. Ct. 411 (2009), S.C., 82 Mass. App. Ct.\n\n105 (2012) (Taylor I).\n\n    A.   The Karaas' § 15B(3)(a) violation.     Subsection (3)(a)\n\n\"imposes two duties on the landlord:     first, to establish the\n\nescrow account, and, second, to furnish the tenant with a\n\nconforming receipt, both within a thirty-day period measured\n\nfrom receipt of the security deposit.\"     Castenholz, 21 Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. at 760.   The purpose of this subsection is to insure\n\nthat \"tenant monies are protected from potential diversion to\n\nthe personal use of the landlord, earn interest for the tenant,\n\f                                                                       12\n\n\nand are kept from the reach of the landlord's creditors.\"\n\nNeihaus v. Maxwell, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 558, 561 (2002).       Failure\n\nto establish a separate, interest-bearing account or to provide\n\na tenant with an appropriate receipt represents a failure to\n\ncomply with the subsection, and entitles the tenant to\n\n\"immediate return of the security deposit.\"    G. L. c. 186,\n\n§ 15B(3)(a), as appearing in St. 1978, c. 553, § 2.    See\n\nCastenholz, supra.\n\n    In the instant case, the Karaas clearly violated these\n\nrequirements.    The failure of the tenants to provide a Social\n\nSecurity number did not preclude the Karaas from establishing a\n\nseparate account in compliance with § 15B.    See Neihaus, supra\n\nat 560-561 (security deposit held separately from landlord's\n\nfunds in management company's account, in combination with\n\nmanagement company's internal accounting system, did not violate\n\n§ 15B[3][a]).    The consequence of the violation, however, is\n\nless obvious.\n\n    Subsection (3)(a) works in tandem with subsection (6).        In\n\nrelevant part, subsection (6), as appearing in St. 1978, c. 553,\n\n§ 2, provides:   \"The lessor shall forfeit his right to retain\n\nany portion of the security deposit for any reason, or, in any\n\naction by a tenant to recover a security deposit, to\n\ncounterclaim for any damage to the premises if he:     (a) fails to\n\ndeposit such funds in an account as required by subsection (3)\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\n. . . [or] (e) fails to return to the tenant the security\n\ndeposit or balance thereof to which the tenant is entitled after\n\ndeducting therefrom any sums in accordance with the provisions\n\nof this section, together with any interest thereon, within\n\nthirty days after termination of the tenancy.\"\n\n    The subsection (6) violations also trigger subsection (7),\n\nwhich provides:   \"If the lessor or his agent fails to comply\n\nwith clauses (a) . . . or (e) of subsection 6, the tenant shall\n\nbe awarded damages in an amount equal to three times the amount\n\nof such security deposit or balance thereof to which the tenant\n\nis entitled plus interest at the rate of five per cent from the\n\ndate when such payment became due, together with court costs and\n\nreasonable attorney's fees.\"    G. L. c. 186, § 15B(7), as\n\nappearing in St. 1978, c. 553, § 2.\n\n    However, the imposition of damages under subsection (7) is\n\nnot automatic.    It first will depend on whether the violation at\n\nissue concerns subsection (6)(a) or (6)(e).    As this court\n\nexplained in Castenholz, which involved a claim by a tenant\n\nstill in possession of the leased premises, subsection (7) is\n\ntriggered when the landlord \"fails to comply with\" the listed\n\nclauses of subsection (6), yet subsection (6)(a) does not\n\ninclude a deadline for returning forfeited funds to the tenant,\n\nthereby leaving no means for determining what qualifies as\n\f                                                                  14\n\n\nnoncompliance for the purpose of subsection (7).    Castenholz, 21\n\nMass. App. Ct. at 762.   See Taylor I, 75 Mass. App. Ct. at 414.\n\n    In an effort to uphold the security deposit law's original\n\npurpose of establishing \"an equitable relationship between\n\ntenants and landlords,\" rather than \"pillory[ing] the landlord\"\n\nand being \"arbitrarily penal,\" the Castenholz court emphasized\n\nthat though a tenant may be entitled to return of a security\n\ndeposit due to his landlord's noncompliance with subsection\n\n(3)(a), the landlord would not be held to be in violation of\n\nsubsection (6)(a) unless, after the tenant demands return of the\n\ndeposit, the landlord \"refuses to acknowledge his error and\n\nreturn the deposit, thus forcing the tenant to employ legal\n\nprocess to vindicate his rights.\"   Castenholz, supra at 763\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n    When applying the Castenholz framework, the facts before us\n\ndo not support the Karaas' liability under subsection (7) based\n\nsolely on their violation of subsection (3)(a).    Though the\n\ntenants' counterclaim functions as an adequate demand for the\n\nreturn of their security deposit, see Castenholz, supra at 764;\n\nYoung v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 909 (1987), the\n\nKaraas did return the security deposit four days prior to the\n\ninitiation of the underlying litigation and more than one month\n\nbefore the filing of the tenants' answer and counterclaims.     As\n\nsuch, the Karaas are in violation of subsection (3)(a), but have\n\f                                                                    15\n\n\nnot triggered the treble damages provisions of subsection (7)\n\nthrough a violation of (6)(a).    We turn next to the alleged\n\nviolation of subsection (6)(e).\n\n    B.   The Karaas' alleged § 15B(6)(e) violation.    Subsection\n\n(6)(e) provides that a lessor forfeits his right to the security\n\ndeposit if he \"fails to return to the tenant the security\n\ndeposit or balance thereof to which the tenant is entitled after\n\ndeducting therefrom any sums in accordance with the provisions\n\nof this section, together with any interest thereon, within\n\nthirty days after termination of the tenancy.\"    G. L. c. 186,\n\n§ 15B(6)(e).   Ordinarily, this subsection allows a landlord to\n\nwithhold the entirety or a portion of a tenant's security\n\ndeposit for unpaid rent that a tenant has not validly withheld.\n\nG. L. c. 186, § 15B(4)(i).   The trial judge here concluded that\n\nthe Karaas could have kept the security deposit because the\n\ntenants \"owed additional rent for the remaining lease term.\"\n\nThe Karaas, however -- due to their failure to place the\n\nsecurity deposit in a separate account -- already had forfeited\n\ntheir right to retain the security deposit \"for any reason,\"\n\nincluding the use of the security deposit as an offset for\n\nunpaid rent.   G. L. c. 186, § 15B(6)(a).\n\n    The tenants argue that by holding onto the security deposit\n\nuntil September 25, 2011, more than five months after the end of\n\nthe tenancy, the Karaas therefore violated subsection (6)(e) and\n\f                                                                         16\n\n\ntriggered the treble damages provisions of subsection (7).            The\n\ntenants rest their argument on Taylor I.    In that case a\n\nlandlord returned a portion of a security deposit back to the\n\ntenants after making deductions for cleaning and repairs.         75\n\nMass. App. Ct. at 412.   He did not make the deductions, however,\n\nin accordance with the statutory requirements,11 and the tenant\n\nfiled a complaint that the failure to return his entire deposit\n\nwithin thirty days violated subsection (6)(e).       Ibid.    After\n\nreceiving the complaint, the landlord returned to the tenant the\n\nbalance of the security deposit.   Ibid.   The trial judge\n\ndeclined to award treble damages but this court reversed,\n\nemphasizing that subsection (6)(e), unlike subsection (6)(a),\n\nincludes a set deadline for compliance -- within thirty days of\n\nthe termination of the tenancy.    Id. at 415-416.     Thus, the\n\nTaylor I court held that the Castenholz framework, which\n\ndisallowed treble damages unless the landlord failed to return\n\nthe deposit after the tenant demanded its return, \"is\n\ninapplicable to a landlord's failure to return the tenant's\n\nsecurity deposit within the specified thirty days.      The\n\nstatutory obligation to return the deposit is clear, as is the\n\n     11\n       The landlord in Taylor I sent the tenant a check \"with an\nundated letter explaining that the check covered the security\ndeposit plus accrued interest,\" minus a sum \"for cleaning and\nrepairs to the tenant's apartment. The landlord did not sign\nthe damage list under the pains and penalties of perjury, nor\ndid he provide . . . any evidence . . . of the estimated or\nactual cost of repairing the damage.\" 75 Mass. App. Ct. at 412.\n\f                                                                     17\n\n\ntime within which the deposit must be returned.     Equally\n\nunambiguous are the consequences of failing to comply with that\n\ndeadline.\"   Id. at 416.\n\n    However, Taylor I's strict application of subsection (7)\n\ndid not involve tenants who specifically offered the security\n\ndeposit as \"compensation\" for their breach of the lease.\n\nIndeed, just the opposite was true in Taylor I:      the tenant in\n\nTaylor I steadfastly demanded return of the entire security\n\ndeposit.   Id. at 412.     The record here indicates that the\n\nsecurity deposit was the subject of much of the communication\n\nbetween the parties after the termination of the tenancy, with\n\nthe tenants attempting to use the security deposit as a\n\nbargaining chip to avoid paying, and being sued about, the\n\nremaining four months' rent.     Where the tenants offer the\n\nsecurity deposit as compensation for their own breach of the\n\nlease, a landlord's failure to return the security deposit\n\nwithin thirty days will not require an award of treble damages.\n\nRather, to avoid treble damages pursuant to subsection (7), the\n\nlandlord must return the security deposit, as was done here,\n\nprior to the tenant's resort to litigation.\n\n    The security deposit law was designed to afford \"a wronged\n\ntenant easy and inexpensive means of securing the repayment of\n\nthe security deposit, with penalty awards in appropriate cases,\"\n\nJinwala v. Bizzaro, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 6 (1987), i.e., those\n\f                                                                     18\n\n\n\"that deal with conduct the Legislature considered 'particularly\n\nreprehensible.'\"     Taylor I, 75 Mass. App. Ct. at 415 (citations\n\nomitted).    Though the Karaas violated § 15B(3)(a), the tenants'\n\noffer of the security deposit as compensation prevents us from\n\nconcluding that the Karaas' failure to return it within thirty\n\ndays was the type of reprehensible conduct the Legislature\n\nintended to target with subsection (7).\n\n    4.      Evidence of attorney's fees.   General Laws c. 186,\n\n§ 15B(2)(a), requires a landlord who receives rent in advance\n\nfor the last month of a tenancy to pay interest at the rate of\n\nfive percent per year.     After the parties' jury-waived trial,\n\nthe trial judge found for the tenants on their G. L. c. 186,\n\n§ 15B(2)(a), claim.     In addition to providing a cause of action,\n\n§ 15B(2)(a) also provides for the award of attorney's fees and\n\ncourt costs.    Though the tenants assert that the trial judge\n\nabused her discretion by preventing the tenants from presenting\n\nevidence on this point, the record before us provides no support\n\nfor this contention.    The record and the trial judge's order\n\nsupport the conclusion that the tenants introduced no evidence\n\nat trial as to any court costs or attorney's fees they incurred\n\nin connection with recovering the interest owed on the last\n\nmonth's rent.    The trial judge cannot be faulted for failing to\n\nadmit evidence that was not offered at trial or even by way of\n\nposttrial motions.     Moreover, by failing to argue this issue at\n\f                                                                    19\n\n\ntrial, the tenants have failed to preserve it for appeal, and it\n\nis therefore waived.    See Milton, 365 Mass. at 379; R.W. Granger\n\n& Sons, Inc., 435 Mass. at 73-74; Reading Co-Op. Bank, 464 Mass.\n\nat 545 n.1.\n\n    5.     The tenants' G. L. c. 93A claim.   Under G. L. c. 93A,\n\n§ 2(a), only unfair methods of competition and unfair or\n\ndeceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or\n\ncommerce are prohibited.    In response to the tenants' claim that\n\nthe Karaas violated § 2(a) by failing to set up a separate\n\nsecurity deposit account, the trial judge found that the Karaas\n\ncould not be liable under the statute because they were not\n\n\"engaged in trade or commerce\" when they leased their primary\n\nresidence to the tenants.    Neihaus, 54 Mass. App. Ct. at 563\n\n(isolated rental of home while owner temporarily living overseas\n\ndid not amount to engaging in trade or commerce under G. L.\n\nc. 93A).   See Young, 24 Mass. App. Ct. at 910 (actions of owner-\n\noccupant of three-family building did not constitute trade or\n\ncommerce).    Based on the judge's factual findings, we discern no\n\nerror.\n\n    Even if we were to distinguish this case from Neihaus or\n\nYoung by finding that the evidence of the Karaas' other real\n\nestate activities suggests that the Karaas were in fact engaged\n\f                                                                   20\n\n\nin trade or commerce,12 the tenants still have failed to provide\n\nsufficient evidence to support a claim for damages under G. L.\n\nc. 93A.   The $4,300 security deposit together with interest at\n\ntwelve percent was returned to the tenants prior to the\n\ncommencement of litigation.   The security deposit also was\n\noffered by the tenants as compensation for unpaid rent before it\n\nwas returned.\n\n     \"The invasion of a consumer's legal right (a right, for\n\nexample, established by statute or regulation), without more,\n\nmay be a violation of G. L. c. 93A, § 2, and even a per se\n\nviolation of § 2, but the fact that there is such a violation\n\ndoes not necessarily mean the consumer has suffered an injury or\n\na loss entitling her to at least nominal damages and attorney's\n\nfees; instead, the violation of the legal right that has created\n\nthe unfair or deceptive act or practice must cause the consumer\n\nsome kind of separate, identifiable harm arising from the\n\nviolation itself.\"   Tyler v. Michaels Stores, Inc., 464 Mass.\n\n492, 503 (2013).   In specifically overturning their decision in\n\nLeardi v. Brown, 394 Mass. 151 (1985), the Supreme Judicial\n\n\n     12\n       Previously, the Karaas had rented out the property for a\nspan of roughly five years, starting in the late 1990s. The\nKaraas also owned several other rental properties in the prior\ndecade, up through the time of the trial. These facts are\nconsistent with the trial judge's findings that the Karaas had\nprior experience as landlords, though the judge concluded that\nthe Karaas were not engaged in trade or commerce in this\ninstance, as the property was their primary residence.\n\f                                                                  21\n\n\nCourt held in Tyler that \"a plaintiff bringing an action for\n\ndamages under c. 93A, § 9, must allege and ultimately prove that\n\nshe has, as a result, suffered a distinct injury or harm that\n\narises from the claimed unfair or deceptive act itself.\"   Tyler,\n\nsupra.\n\n    The tenants here failed to present argument, both at trial\n\nand on appeal, regarding this most salient point.   Thus, based\n\non the record before us, the trial judge's holding that the\n\nKaraas are not liable under G. L. c. 93A must stand.\n\n    6.   Appellate attorney's fees.   The Karaas in their brief\n\nhave requested, and we grant, an award of appellate attorney's\n\nfees pursuant to the lease, which provides for recovery of costs\n\nand attorney's fees for breach.   In accordance with the\n\nprocedure set forth in Fabre v. Walton, 441 Mass. 9, 10-11\n\n(2004), the Karaas may file documentation in support of their\n\nrequest within fourteen days of the date of the rescript, and\n\nthe tenants shall have fourteen days thereafter to respond.\n\n                                    Judgment affirmed.\n\f",

The primary issue presented in this landlord-\n\ntenant case is the proper application of the security deposit\n\n\n     1\n         Fadi Karaa.\n     2\n       China Real Estate Development Investment & Trust Fund\nCorporation and Chiung Fong.\n\f                                                                      2\n\n\nprovisions in G. L. c. 186, § 15B.    The residential property was\n\nowned by Shoreh Karaa and Fadi Karaa (collectively, the Karaas),\n\nand rented by China Real Estate Development Investment & Trust\n\nFund Corporation (CREDIT), Kuk Yim, and Chiung Fong\n\n(collectively, the tenants).    After a bench trial, the Superior\n\nCourt judge found that the tenants had breached their lease with\n\nthe Karaas, and that the tenants' obligations under the lease\n\nwere not excused under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\n\nThe judge also found that the Karaas were not liable for alleged\n\nviolations of G. L. c. 186, § 15B, stemming from their\n\nmishandling of the tenants' security deposit.     The judge further\n\ndetermined that the Karaas had not committed fraud or breached\n\nthe covenant of quiet enjoyment, that they properly had\n\nmitigated their damages, and that they were not liable for\n\nalleged violations of G. L. c. 93A.    The trial judge did find,\n\nhowever, that the Karaas were liable under G. L. c. 186,\n\n§ 15B(2)(a), for their failure to pay interest on the tenants'\n\nlast month's rent.    On appeal, the tenants take issue with the\n\ntrial judge's holdings in favor of the Karaas.     We affirm.\n\n    Background.      In March, 2010, the Karaas placed their home\n\nlocated at 83 Spring Valley Road in Belmont (property) up for\n\nrent at $4,500 per month through listings on the Internet site\n\n\"Craigslist\" and with a real estate agent.     On May 10, 2010, the\n\ntenants and the Karaas entered into a written lease agreement\n\f                                                                    3\n\n\nfor the property at a reduced rent of $4,300 per month, with a\n\nstarting date of June 16, 2010.   The lease was for one year and\n\nfifteen days.   The lessees initially listed on the lease were\n\nCREDIT and Yim, as the lease was signed by Yim both in her\n\npersonal capacity and in her capacity as chief financial officer\n\nfor CREDIT.   Subsequently, a new cover page to the lease was\n\nsubstituted, listing Yim and Fong as lessees.   This change was\n\nmade to allow their children to attend school in Belmont.\n\n     At the time Yim signed the lease, the tenants gave the\n\nKaraas a check for $8,600, which included $4,300 for a security\n\ndeposit and $4,300 for the last month's rent.   Shoreh3 requested\n\na tax identification or Social Security number so that she could\n\nopen an escrow account to deposit the funds, and the tenants\n\nresponded that they would provide the number at a later date.\n\nShoreh deposited the check into her own interest-bearing account\n\nthe same day the lease was signed.   Over the course of the\n\ntenancy, the tenants never provided the Karaas a tax\n\nidentification or Social Security number.   Though the Karaas\n\npreviously had leased other properties and knew that they were\n\nrequired to segregate the security deposit from their personal\n\naccount and to provide the tenants with a receipt in compliance\n\nwith G. L. c. 186, § 15B, they did not do so.\n\n\n     3\n       We use the first names of the Karaas, where applicable, to\navoid confusion.\n\f                                                                    4\n\n\n     In August of 2010, Fong and Yim, and their children,\n\ntraveled to China.   They intended to return to Belmont later\n\nthat month, but due to complications with their visas, they were\n\nunable to reenter the United States.    The tenants paid rent for\n\nAugust, September, and October.4    On October 26, 2010, Yim sent\n\nthe Karaas an electronic mail message (e-mail) stating that,\n\nbecause the visa applications for herself and the three children\n\nhad been rejected, they would not be able to return to the\n\nUnited States, and that the tenants therefore would be\n\nterminating the lease.    She stated that the Karaas should apply\n\nthe tenants' earlier check of $8,600 to cover the November rent\n\nand as \"compensation\" for the termination of the lease.     Yim\n\nfurther stated that Fong would be returning to the United States\n\naround November 15 and would arrange for the move and any\n\nnecessary paperwork.\n\n     In early December, the Karaas posted the house for rent on\n\nCraigslist and with a real estate agent.    Because of their past\n\nexperience leasing other properties, the Karaas were aware that\n\nit likely would be more difficult to lease the property during\n\nthe winter months.     They eventually relet the house for $4,200\n\nper month beginning April 1, 2011.    On September 30, 2011, the\n\nKaraas brought a two-count complaint against the tenants for\n\n\n     4\n       The tenants earlier had paid rent covering June 16 through\nJuly 31.\n\f                                                                   5\n\n\nbreach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing.   Prior to litigation, the Karaas sent\n\nthe tenants a check, dated September 25, 2011, for $4,604.88 for\n\n\"security deposit return.\"5   The Karaas did not pay the tenants\n\nany interest on the last month's rent.\n\n     In response, Yim brought counterclaims alleging that the\n\nKaraas breached the lease by failing to deliver the entire\n\nproperty, did not comply with the statutory requirements of the\n\nsecurity deposit statute and the last month's rent statute, and\n\nengaged in unfair and deceptive practices in violation of G. L.\n\nc. 93A.   Yim additionally claimed that her purpose in entering\n\nthe lease, i.e., to allow her children to attend school in\n\nBelmont, was frustrated by circumstances beyond her control, the\n\nrejection of their visa applications.    Lastly, Yim claimed the\n\nKaraas failed to mitigate their damages subsequent to the\n\nbreach.\n\n     After a jury-waived trial, the judge found for the Karaas,\n\nawarding them $19,861,6 plus statutory interest of $5,106.23, and\n\n\n     5\n       The Karaas voluntarily added twelve percent interest to\nthis amount.\n     6\n       The judge arrived at $19,861 by calculating as follows:\nrent of $4,300 per month for the seven-month period from\nDecember 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011 ($30,100); utilities for\nDecember of 2010, through March of 2011 ($1,800); and the real\nestate agent's fee of $750, for a total of $32,650. Subtracted\nfrom this amount was the rent collected from the successor\ntenant for the months of April, May, and June, 2011 ($4,200 per\n\f                                                                      6\n\n\nattorney's fees in the amount of $24,098.70.7     The judge included\n\nan offset of $189 for trebled interest on Yim's last month's\n\nrent deposit,8 though the judge otherwise dismissed the\n\ncounterclaims.\n\n     Discussion.     1.   The tenants' obligations under the lease.\n\nA.   Yim's frustration of purpose defense.    Yim cannot be excused\n\nfrom her obligation under the lease to pay rent on the basis of\n\na frustration of purpose argument.     Yim argues that her\n\nprincipal purpose in leasing the property was to send her\n\ndaughter to school in Belmont, and that once her and her\n\nfamily's visa applications were rejected, thereby preventing\n\nthem from reentering the United States, this purpose was\n\nsubstantially frustrated.     Yim maintains that this frustration\n\ndischarged her obligations under the lease.\n\n     The Supreme Judicial Court has held that the doctrine of\n\nfrustration of purpose is a companion rule to the doctrine of\n\nimpossibility.     See Mishara Constr. Co. v. Transit-Mixed\n\n\nmonth, totaling $12,600), and $189 for interest due to Yim on\nthe last month's rent.\n     7\n       The terms of the lease provided the basis for the award of\nattorney's fees.\n     8\n       The judge held that because the Karaas paid no interest on\nthe last month's rent payment of $4,300, Yim was entitled to\nrecover five percent interest on that amount from June 16, 2010,\nthe date of commencement of the tenancy, through October 31,\n2010, the last day she paid rent for the premises. That\namounted to sixty-three dollars, which then was trebled in\naccordance with the statute. G.

Burden to prove mitigation of damages.   The tenants\n\nargued at trial that, despite the underlying breach of the\n\nlease, the Karaas failed to mitigate their damages by diligently\n\nattempting to relet the property.   Nonetheless, the trial judge\n\nheld that the Karaas \"used reasonable precautions to mitigate\n\ntheir damages.\"   In reaching her conclusion, the trial judge\n\nstated that the \"defendant bears the burden of proving that a\n\nplaintiff has failed to mitigate [her] damages . . .

As discussed in the judge's order, the\n\nKaraas advertised the house for rent in early December, 2010,\n\napproximately one month after the tenants notified them of their\n\nintention to terminate the tenancy.    The trial judge credited\n\nShoreh's testimony that she and Fadi paid a fee of $750 to a\n\nreal estate agent in an effort to relet the property.    Moreover,\n\nthe Karaas were able to secure a tenant by April of 2011,\n\ndespite the difficulty of the winter rental market.     Regardless\n\nof which party the burden ultimately fell on, the evidence\n\nsupports the trial judge's conclusion that the Karaas indeed\n\nfulfilled their duty to mitigate their damages, and we decline\n\nto overturn such a finding.\n\n    3.

Failure\n\nto establish a separate, interest-bearing account or to provide\n\na tenant with an appropriate receipt represents a failure to\n\ncomply with the subsection, and entitles the tenant to\n\n\"immediate return of the security deposit.\"    G. L. c. 186,\n\n§ 15B(3)(a), as appearing in St. 1978, c. 553, § 2.    See\n\nCastenholz, supra.\n\n    In the instant case, the Karaas clearly violated these\n\nrequirements.    The failure of the tenants to provide a Social\n\nSecurity number did not preclude the Karaas from establishing a\n\nseparate account in compliance with § 15B.    See Neihaus, supra\n\nat 560-561 (security deposit held separately from landlord's\n\nfunds in management company's account, in combination with\n\nmanagement company's internal accounting system, did not violate\n\n§ 15B[3][a]).    The consequence of the violation, however, is\n\nless obvious.\n\n    Subsection (3)(a) works in tandem with subsection (6).        In\n\nrelevant part, subsection (6), as appearing in St. 1978, c. 553,\n\n§ 2, provides:   \"The lessor shall forfeit his right to retain\n\nany portion of the security deposit for any reason, or, in any\n\naction by a tenant to recover a security deposit, to\n\ncounterclaim for any damage to the premises if he:     (a) fails to\n\ndeposit such funds in an account as required by subsection (3)\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\n. . .

L. c. 186, § 15B(7), as\n\nappearing in St. 1978, c. 553, § 2.\n\n    However, the imposition of damages under subsection (7) is\n\nnot automatic.    It first will depend on whether the violation at\n\nissue concerns subsection (6)(a) or (6)(e).    As this court\n\nexplained in Castenholz, which involved a claim by a tenant\n\nstill in possession of the leased premises, subsection (7) is\n\ntriggered when the landlord \"fails to comply with\" the listed\n\nclauses of subsection (6), yet subsection (6)(a) does not\n\ninclude a deadline for returning forfeited funds to the tenant,\n\nthereby leaving no means for determining what qualifies as\n\f                                                                  14\n\n\nnoncompliance for the purpose of subsection (7).    Castenholz, 21\n\nMass. App. Ct. at 762.   See Taylor I, 75 Mass. App. Ct. at 414.\n\n    In an effort to uphold the security deposit law's original\n\npurpose of establishing \"an equitable relationship between\n\ntenants and landlords,\" rather than \"pillory[ing] the landlord\"\n\nand being \"arbitrarily penal,\" the Castenholz court emphasized\n\nthat though a tenant may be entitled to return of a security\n\ndeposit due to his landlord's noncompliance with subsection\n\n(3)(a), the landlord would not be held to be in violation of\n\nsubsection (6)(a) unless, after the tenant demands return of the\n\ndeposit, the landlord \"refuses to acknowledge his error and\n\nreturn the deposit, thus forcing the tenant to employ legal\n\nprocess to vindicate his rights.\"   Castenholz, supra at 763\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n    When applying the Castenholz framework, the facts before us\n\ndo not support the Karaas' liability under subsection (7) based\n\nsolely on their violation of subsection (3)(a).    Though the\n\ntenants' counterclaim functions as an adequate demand for the\n\nreturn of their security deposit, see Castenholz, supra at 764;\n\nYoung v. Patukonis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.

As\n\nsuch, the Karaas are in violation of subsection (3)(a), but have\n\f                                                                    15\n\n\nnot triggered the treble damages provisions of subsection (7)\n\nthrough a violation of (6)(a).    We turn next to the alleged\n\nviolation of subsection (6)(e).\n\n    B.   The Karaas' alleged § 15B(6)(e) violation.    Subsection\n\n(6)(e) provides that a lessor forfeits his right to the security\n\ndeposit if he \"fails to return to the tenant the security\n\ndeposit or balance thereof to which the tenant is entitled after\n\ndeducting therefrom any sums in accordance with the provisions\n\nof this section, together with any interest thereon, within\n\nthirty days after termination of the tenancy.\"    G. L. c. 186,\n\n§ 15B(6)(e).   Ordinarily, this subsection allows a landlord to\n\nwithhold the entirety or a portion of a tenant's security\n\ndeposit for unpaid rent that a tenant has not validly withheld.\n\nG. L. c. 186, § 15B(4)(i).   The trial judge here concluded that\n\nthe Karaas could have kept the security deposit because the\n\ntenants \"owed additional rent for the remaining lease term.\"\n\nThe Karaas, however -- due to their failure to place the\n\nsecurity deposit in a separate account -- already had forfeited\n\ntheir right to retain the security deposit \"for any reason,\"\n\nincluding the use of the security deposit as an offset for\n\nunpaid rent.   G. L. c. 186, § 15B(6)(a).\n\n    The tenants argue that by holding onto the security deposit\n\nuntil September 25, 2011, more than five months after the end of\n\nthe tenancy, the Karaas therefore violated subsection (6)(e) and\n\f                                                                         16\n\n\ntriggered the treble damages provisions of subsection (7).            The\n\ntenants rest their argument on Taylor I.    In that case a\n\nlandlord returned a portion of a security deposit back to the\n\ntenants after making deductions for cleaning and repairs.         75\n\nMass. App. Ct. at 412.   He did not make the deductions, however,\n\nin accordance with the statutory requirements,11 and the tenant\n\nfiled a complaint that the failure to return his entire deposit\n\nwithin thirty days violated subsection (6)(e).       Ibid.    After\n\nreceiving the complaint, the landlord returned to the tenant the\n\nbalance of the security deposit.   Ibid.   The trial judge\n\ndeclined to award treble damages but this court reversed,\n\nemphasizing that subsection (6)(e), unlike subsection (6)(a),\n\nincludes a set deadline for compliance -- within thirty days of\n\nthe termination of the tenancy.    Id. at 415-416.     Thus, the\n\nTaylor I court held that the Castenholz framework, which\n\ndisallowed treble damages unless the landlord failed to return\n\nthe deposit after the tenant demanded its return, \"is\n\ninapplicable to a landlord's failure to return the tenant's\n\nsecurity deposit within the specified thirty days.      The\n\nstatutory obligation to return the deposit is clear, as is the\n\n     11\n       The landlord in Taylor I sent the tenant a check \"with an\nundated letter explaining that the check covered the security\ndeposit plus accrued interest,\" minus a sum \"for cleaning and\nrepairs to the tenant's apartment. The landlord did not sign\nthe damage list under the pains and penalties of perjury, nor\ndid he provide . . . any evidence . . . of the estimated or\nactual cost of repairing the damage.\" 75 Mass. App. Ct. at 412.\n\f                                                                     17\n\n\ntime within which the deposit must be returned.     Equally\n\nunambiguous are the consequences of failing to comply with that\n\ndeadline.\"   Id. at 416.\n\n    However, Taylor I's strict application of subsection (7)\n\ndid not involve tenants who specifically offered the security\n\ndeposit as \"compensation\" for their breach of the lease.\n\nIndeed, just the opposite was true in Taylor I:      the tenant in\n\nTaylor I steadfastly demanded return of the entire security\n\ndeposit.   Id. at 412.     The record here indicates that the\n\nsecurity deposit was the subject of much of the communication\n\nbetween the parties after the termination of the tenancy, with\n\nthe tenants attempting to use the security deposit as a\n\nbargaining chip to avoid paying, and being sued about, the\n\nremaining four months' rent.     Where the tenants offer the\n\nsecurity deposit as compensation for their own breach of the\n\nlease, a landlord's failure to return the security deposit\n\nwithin thirty days will not require an award of treble damages.\n\nRather, to avoid treble damages pursuant to subsection (7), the\n\nlandlord must return the security deposit, as was done here,\n\nprior to the tenant's resort to litigation.\n\n    The security deposit law was designed to afford \"a wronged\n\ntenant easy and inexpensive means of securing the repayment of\n\nthe security deposit, with penalty awards in appropriate cases,\"\n\nJinwala v.

In addition to providing a cause of action,\n\n§ 15B(2)(a) also provides for the award of attorney's fees and\n\ncourt costs.    Though the tenants assert that the trial judge\n\nabused her discretion by preventing the tenants from presenting\n\nevidence on this point, the record before us provides no support\n\nfor this contention.    The record and the trial judge's order\n\nsupport the conclusion that the tenants introduced no evidence\n\nat trial as to any court costs or attorney's fees they incurred\n\nin connection with recovering the interest owed on the last\n\nmonth's rent.    The trial judge cannot be faulted for failing to\n\nadmit evidence that was not offered at trial or even by way of\n\nposttrial motions.     Moreover, by failing to argue this issue at\n\f                                                                    19\n\n\ntrial, the tenants have failed to preserve it for appeal, and it\n\nis therefore waived.    See Milton, 365 Mass. at 379; R.W. Granger\n\n& Sons, Inc., 435 Mass. at 73-74; Reading Co-Op. Bank, 464 Mass.\n\nat 545 n.1.\n\n    5.     The tenants' G. L. c. 93A claim.   Under G. L. c. 93A,\n\n§ 2(a), only unfair methods of competition and unfair or\n\ndeceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or\n\ncommerce are prohibited.    In response to the tenants' claim that\n\nthe Karaas violated § 2(a) by failing to set up a separate\n\nsecurity deposit account, the trial judge found that the Karaas\n\ncould not be liable under the statute because they were not\n\n\"engaged in trade or commerce\" when they leased their primary\n\nresidence to the tenants.    Neihaus, 54 Mass. App. Ct. at 563\n\n(isolated rental of home while owner temporarily living overseas\n\ndid not amount to engaging in trade or commerce under G. L.\n\nc. 93A).   See Young, 24 Mass. App. Ct. at 910 (actions of owner-\n\noccupant of three-family building did not constitute trade or\n\ncommerce).    Based on the judge's factual findings, we discern no\n\nerror.\n\n    Even if we were to distinguish this case from Neihaus or\n\nYoung by finding that the evidence of the Karaas' other real\n\nestate activities suggests that the Karaas were in fact engaged\n\f                                                                   20\n\n\nin trade or commerce,12 the tenants still have failed to provide\n\nsufficient evidence to support a claim for damages under G. L.\n\nc. 93A.   The $4,300 security deposit together with interest at\n\ntwelve percent was returned to the tenants prior to the\n\ncommencement of litigation.   The security deposit also was\n\noffered by the tenants as compensation for unpaid rent before it\n\nwas returned.\n\n     \"The invasion of a consumer's legal right (a right, for\n\nexample, established by statute or regulation), without more,\n\nmay be a violation of G. L. c. 93A, § 2, and even a per se\n\nviolation of § 2, but the fact that there is such a violation\n\ndoes not necessarily mean the consumer has suffered an injury or\n\na loss entitling her to at least nominal damages and attorney's\n\nfees; instead, the violation of the legal right that has created\n\nthe unfair or deceptive act or practice must cause the consumer\n\nsome kind of separate, identifiable harm arising from the\n\nviolation itself.\"   Tyler v.

The\nKaraas also owned several other rental properties in the prior\ndecade, up through the time of the trial. These facts are\nconsistent with the trial judge's findings that the Karaas had\nprior experience as landlords, though the judge concluded that\nthe Karaas were not engaged in trade or commerce in this\ninstance, as the property was their primary residence.\n\f                                                                  21\n\n\nCourt held in Tyler that \"a plaintiff bringing an action for\n\ndamages under c. 93A, § 9, must allege and ultimately prove that\n\nshe has, as a result, suffered a distinct injury or harm that\n\narises from the claimed unfair or deceptive act itself.\"   Tyler,\n\nsupra.\n\n    The tenants here failed to present argument, both at trial\n\nand on appeal, regarding this most salient point.   Thus, based\n\non the record before us, the trial judge's holding that the\n\nKaraas are not liable under G. L. c. 93A must stand.\n\n    6.   Appellate attorney's fees.   The Karaas in their brief\n\nhave requested, and we grant, an award of appellate attorney's\n\nfees pursuant to the lease, which provides for recovery of costs\n\nand attorney's fees for breach.
