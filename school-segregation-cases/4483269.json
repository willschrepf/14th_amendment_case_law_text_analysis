Code,\n§ 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by Pen. Code, § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a\npetition pursuant to the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (hereafter Proposition 36 or the\nAct) to have his sentence recalled and to be resentenced.1 (§ 1170.126, subd. (b).)\nFollowing a hearing, the trial court concluded resentencing would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety and denied the petition.\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we hold the People have the burden of\nproving, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts on which a finding that resentencing a\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety reasonably can be\nbased. Those facts are reviewed for substantial evidence. We further hold, the\npreponderance of the evidence standard does not apply to the trial court’s determination\nregarding dangerousness, nor does section 1170.126, subdivision (f), create a\npresumption in favor of resentencing. The ultimate decision — whether resentencing an\ninmate would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety — instead lies within\nthe sound discretion of the trial court. We also hold section 1170.18, subdivision (c) does\nnot modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f). As we explain in the unpublished portion\nof our opinion, we find no abuse of discretion and affirm.\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY*\n       At approximately 3:30 a.m. on October 15, 1995, Kern County Sheriff’s Deputy\nHakker observed a gold-colored Dodge, driven by defendant, traveling with the\npassenger door fully open.2 A woman in the passenger seat was screaming to be let out.\n\n\n\n1      All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n\n\n                                             2.\n\f       Hakker immediately initiated a pursuit of the vehicle.3 During the pursuit,\ndefendant drove through a number of posted stop signs and red lights, and reached speeds\nin excess of 65 miles per hour. At one point, with the vehicle smoking profusely,\ndefendant drove onto a dirt easement adjoining railroad tracks and used the railroad\nbridge to cross a canal. Upon his return to surface streets, he traveled erratically at\nspeeds ranging from 40 to 70 miles per hour and continued to run through red lights and\nposted stop signs at intersections. Eventually, he ended up traveling against traffic at 55\nmiles per hour, forcing other vehicles on the road to take evasive action to avoid\ncollision.\n       The Dodge pulled off the road and continued through a vacant field, where it\ncollided with a power pole guide wire. Defendant fled on foot. When apprehended, he\ncontinued to resist even after pepper spray and a baton were used in an attempt to subdue\nhim. It took several officers to finally get him handcuffed and into custody. Defendant,\nwhose speech was slurred and who had a “ ‘wild look’ ” on his face and smelled strongly\nof alcohol, gave several false names when asked to identify himself and refused to submit\nto a chemical test to determine if he was under the influence.\n       Defendant was charged with numerous offenses arising out of the incident. At\ntrial, he testified he had consumed 24 cans of beer and two pints of whiskey over the 12-\nhour period prior to the car chase. He failed to comply with the patrol car’s signal lights\nbecause he usually was beaten and hassled by the police. He denied going through stop\nsigns and red lights, and insisted he carefully looked before crossing intersections. He\nadmitted that at some point, one of the Dodge’s tires suffered a blow out and shredded to\n\n\n2      The facts of defendant’s commitment offense are derived from our nonpublished\nopinion in People v. Buford (Jan. 15, 1997, F025449), of which we have taken judicial\nnotice by separate order.\n3      As Hakker turned the corner, he saw the woman standing on the sidewalk, looking\nfrightened but unharmed.\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fthe rim, but he continued to drive on the rim because he was looking for a public area\nwhere he would feel safe to pull over.\n       On December 28, 1995, defendant was convicted of felony evasion of a police\nvehicle while driving with willful and wanton disregard for safety (Veh. Code, § 2800.2),\nas well as the following misdemeanors: resisting a police officer (§ 148), driving under\nthe influence (Veh. Code, § 23152, subd. (a); DUI), giving false identification to a police\nofficer (§ 148.9, subd. (a)), and driving without a license (Veh. Code, § 12500, subd. (a)).\nThe jury further found he had suffered four prior strike convictions and had served five\nprior prison terms (§ 667.5, subd. (b)). On January 26, 1996, he was sentenced to 25\nyears to life in prison on the felony offense, with five consecutive one-year terms for the\nsection 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancements and concurrent jail terms for the\nmisdemeanor convictions.\n       On December 7, 2012, defendant filed a petition under section 1170.126 asserting\nhe was statutorily eligible for resentencing under the Act. The probation officer\nrecommended defendant be resentenced to the upper term of six years on his current\nfelony, plus five years for the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancements, for a total\nfixed term of 11 years; and that defendant’s sentence be deemed served and he be\nreleased on parole. The People opposed the petition, arguing that releasing defendant\nwould result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. They pointed to\ndefendant’s lengthy criminal record, which included 17 convictions (including three\nrobbery strike priors and a residential burglary strike prior) since 1975, as well as the\ncontinuance of his criminal behavior while in prison, his failure to address his substance\nabuse problem, and his lack of parole plans.4\n\n4       Although the People appear to have mistaken defendant’s first strike adjudication\nfor his second strike conviction, they presented documentation showing one of\ndefendant’s strikes arose out of two incidents in November 1975, in which defendant,\nwho had a gun in his waistband, grabbed the purses of two women in two different\nLaundromats. Another arose from defendant burglarizing a residence in October 1978.\n\n                                              4.\n\f       The petition was heard on June 9, 2014.5 Defendant, who testified at the hearing,\nwas about to turn 57 years old and had spent 18 years in prison on his current\ncommitment.\n       Defendant testified that he started drinking when he was around 15 or 16 years\nold, and drank heavily “[p]retty much from the beginning.” His family was somewhat\ndysfunctional; his father was frequently drunk, verbally abusive toward defendant and his\n\nStill another resulted from an incident in March 1991, in which defendant put the barrel\nof a gun under the victim’s chin, took the victim’s car keys, struck the victim in the head\nwith the gun, and then told the victim to run. As the victim fled, he heard a couple of\nshots pass over his head.\n       The People also presented multiple prison rules violations reports. On July 22,\n2003, there was a riot between White inmates and the Mexican nationals. Defendant\nreceived a shoulder injury. He was found guilty of participation in a riot with use of\nforce. On September 30, 2005, defendant punched another inmate in the face. Defendant\nsaid he did so because he had been disrespected. Defendant pled guilty to battery on an\ninmate without serious injury. On June 25, 2006, five gallons of inmate-manufactured\nalcohol were found in defendant’s cell. Defendant was found guilty of possession of\ninmate-manufactured alcohol. On July 28, 2007, defendant told an officer that he was in\ndebt to certain inmates for his use of tobacco and heroin. Defendant refused to provide a\nurine sample and was found guilty of using a controlled substance and of refusing a urine\ntest. On April 29, 2010, officers had to use pepper spray to stop defendant and another\ninmate from fighting. Defendant pled guilty to fighting requiring the use of force. On\nDecember 27, 2010, a syringe/inmate-manufactured “hype kit” was found in a box of\ndefendant’s letters. Defendant was found guilty of possession of drug paraphernalia. On\nMarch 16, 2011, officers had to use pepper spray to stop defendant and another inmate\nfrom fighting. Defendant pled guilty to fighting resulting in the use of force. On\nMarch 23, 2011, defendant refused to rehouse with another inmate. He pled guilty to\nrefusing a bed move. On July 5, 2011, defendant refused to move and house with another\ninmate, and was found guilty of willfully delaying a peace officer in the performance of\nduty.\n       The People also presented documentation concerning other disciplinary violations\nincurred by defendant, his classification level, his time spent in administrative\nsegregation for presenting a danger to himself or others and/or endangering institutional\nsecurity, and his request to be placed in administrative segregation because he owed\ninmate groups for heroin, methamphetamine, and tobacco.\n5      Because the judge who imposed defendant’s third strike term was no longer on the\nbench, the matter was heard by a different judge. (See § 1170.126, subd. (j).)\n\n\n                                             5.\n\fbrothers, and physically abusive toward their mother. Defendant dropped out of high\nschool when he was 16, then worked in the oil fields and then for his father’s tree service.\nHe associated with the wrong crowd, drank “[e]very chance [he] got,” and also used\nmarijuana and speed.\n       Defendant got in trouble for robbery in 1976, when he was 17. He explained that\nhe and a few other males were partying — driving around drinking and smoking\nmarijuana — with an older woman. When they needed more money with which to party,\ndefendant and another male went into a Laundromat at the behest of the woman and took\nsome purses that were on the counter. There were two people present. A gun was in\ndefendant’s pants when he and his cohort entered. Defendant “guess[ed]” he brought the\ngun for “security reasons.” He intended to make the other people afraid of him, but now\nthought of himself as a coward. As a result of the offense, defendant was committed to\nthe California Youth Authority for a year. He was sent to a fire camp, and completed his\nterm without problems. He was out about 30 days when he got in trouble for drunk\ndriving.\n       In 1978 or 1979 came defendant’s residential burglary conviction. Defendant\nexplained that he and two other men went to the home of one’s ex-girlfriend. When she\nwas not there, the men went in and started partying — drinking and smoking marijuana\n— in the house. They ultimately took some things. As a result, defendant was sentenced\nto adult prison for the first time. He was paroled from prison in 1980, but got in trouble\nin 1981 for another drunk driving violation. He knew it was dangerous to human life, but\nat the time, he did not look at the consequences of anything he did. A lot of the times\nwhen he and his companions went out drinking, they would go out in the country and just\ndrive around.\n       Defendant again went to prison in 1982. Although his record showed a robbery\nconviction and a conviction for some sort of forgery or passing a bad check, defendant\ndid not remember any robbery at that time, but he did go into a market and try to pass a\n\n                                             6.\n\fbad check. He was sentenced to prison for three years, but released on parole in 1984. A\nfew months later, he was accused of grand theft of a firearm. Guns were found under a\nhouse or in the back yard, and defendant was in the area at the time. His aunt had given\nhim the guns, but she said someone broke into her house and took them. Defendant was\nsentenced to five years in prison. Although he was released on parole in 1987, he was\nreturned to prison for parole violations in 1988, 1989, and 1990. He believed the\nviolations consisted of not meeting with his parole officer and testing.\n       In 1989, defendant was arrested and convicted of resisting arrest. He explained he\nwrecked his brother’s car, suffered head trauma, and tried to run away from the officer at\nthe hospital.\n       In 1990, defendant was convicted of being under the influence of drugs and\npossessing drug paraphernalia. He was using methamphetamine at that time, simply\nbecause it was available. He was working for his father’s tree service. Sometimes the\njob kept him busy, but not always. He denied using drugs when he was bored; rather, he\nexplained, sometimes they were available and sometimes not. He used them when he\ncould get them from his uncle. Defendant related he had five other family members who\nhad been to prison, of whom two were still alive. Both of his brothers had been to prison\nfor drug offenses, but they had been clean for four or five years as of the time of the\nhearing.\n       Defendant was released from prison in January 1991. A couple months later, he\npicked up another robbery conviction.6 He and some others were at a hot springs where\npeople went skinny dipping. They were drinking and swimming and “messing around”\n\n\n6       Defendant conceded that between 1975 and 1991, there were “probably” some\ncrimes he committed for which he was not convicted. Certain people on his father’s side\nof the family sold drugs and gave loans, and defendant repossessed cars and picked up\nproperty for money owed. He committed these kinds of theft crimes so he could party\nmore.\n\n\n                                             7.\n\fwhen they saw somebody watching. One of the females in defendant’s group had a small\ntwo-shot Derringer pistol in her bag, and they pointed the gun at the man and told him\nwhat he did was not okay. They took his car keys and threw them, and the man’s Maglite\nflashlight ended up in the back of their truck. Although defendant admitted, at the\nhearing on his petition, having the gun in his hand, he denied pointing it at the victim or\nputting it under the man’s chin. Defendant believed the gun was loaded at the time. He\ndenied hitting the victim in the head with it, although he admitted firing a few shots over\nthe man’s head. He did that to get the man to run. Defendant wanted to make a point\nabout the man peeping at the girls when they were in the hot tubs.\n       Defendant was sentenced to prison for eight years, but paroled in 1995. That year,\nhe was convicted in his current case. He explained that he was out one night, drinking a\nbit. When the female in his car started screaming and kicking him, he stopped the car\nand told her to get out. He drove away, however, when the officer tried to stop him. He\ndid not really accelerate away, although he admitted running numerous stop signs and\ngoing through a yellow light. He was traveling 55 to 65 miles per hour. The car jumped\nthe curb when a tire blew out, causing him to drive into opposite lanes of traffic.\nDefendant fled when the officer tried to stop him, because he did not want to go to jail.\nPeople were getting three strikes for minor offenses. Defendant did not know if he would\nget a third strike sentence for driving under the influence. He had had a couple of six\npacks and a small bottle of wine. He was driving because his girlfriend’s mother had\nbeen yelling, and he left the house to get some air. He admitted he would have been\nsmarter simply to walk down the street. He also admitted refusing to take a blood or\nbreath test.\n       When defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate life term in 1995 for the\nevasion case, he was disillusioned, afraid, and angry at himself. He used alcohol and\ncontrolled substances at times in prison. One of the events that triggered his use was the\ndeath of his brother, who died several years after defendant began serving his sentence.\n\n                                             8.\n\fHe stopped because “[t]here was no use in it.” As of the date he testified, defendant had\nbeen clean for 44 months. He had been attending informal meetings on the yard through\na church, as there was a long waiting list to get into the formal NA and AA programs. He\nhad been attending the informal meetings for about a year “[t]his time.”7 Because he was\nattending voluntarily, it gave him a sense of accomplishment that he was doing\nsomething for himself. There was also a sense of camaraderie with other people who\nwere basically like him.\n       The last time defendant used alcohol or a controlled substance in prison was just\nbefore he went “to the hole” in 2010. He wanted to go to the hole to get off the yard, and\nused drugs as a means to get there without having to use violence. Defendant explained\nthat “[o]n regular mainline” in prison, people were judged by their race all the time. He\nwas not on the mainline as, in 2010, he went to the special needs yard (SNY) for refusing\nto submit to “gang rule.” A younger generation of gang members had come into power\nand started running the yards. They decreed that someone could not be “a loner”\nanymore, but rather had to be in the gang or out of the gang. Defendant chose to be out.\nThis made him a target. Young men wanting to get into the gang had come over and\nfought him, which resulted in him receiving several disciplinary violations even though\nhe was defending himself.\n       Defendant was written up on March 16, 2011, “for fighting requiring use of\nforce.” That incident occurred when he was in administrative segregation. Defendant\nrefused a cellmate, because guards were trying to put gang members “in the cages” so the\nguards could watch fights for their amusement.\n       Defendant was written up in 2005 for battery on an inmate, allegedly because the\ninmate disrespected him. Defendant explained the inmate touched him inappropriately\n\n7      The People presented documentation that defendant was an active member of the\nNarcotics Anonymous program for the quarter ending December 19, 1999, while housed\nat Folsom State Prison.\n\n\n                                            9.\n\fwhile they were in the shower, naked. Defendant told him not to be doing that, but when\nthey left the shower area, the inmate said something and did it again, and defendant hit\nhim.\n       Defendant was written up in 2003 for participation in a riot. He explained that the\nriot was between the Skinheads and the Mexican nationals, who were backed by the\nsouthern Hispanics. Defendant was sitting at a table on the yard, playing cards, when\nthere was a ruckus. He stood up to see what was going on. The next thing he knew, he\nwas stabbed in the shoulder. There ended up being 200 inmates fist-fighting, but being\nstabbed was defendant’s only part in the events. After the guards gained control and got\neverybody down, they checked everyone. Because defendant had a shoulder injury, he\nwas deemed to have been involved.8\n       Defendant had held various jobs while in prison. He liked working, as it passed\nthe time. It was like fire camp, where the less time he had on his hands, the less he was\ngoing to get in trouble. If he was released from prison, he would have time and freedom\non his hands. He had learned, however, that actions have consequences, and that a\nperson was responsible for his or her actions. The last thing he wanted to do was to go\nback to prison. Right Way Pumping had offered him a job as a driver and “pumping\nhand” if he was released, although to be a driver, he would need a driver’s license.9 In\naddition, two programs were willing to accept him. One was a six-month, 12-step\nprogram at the Bible Tabernacle in Santa Clarita. After the six months, he would be\noffered the chance to work at a job-paying part of the program. The program would take\none third of his money, allow him to keep one third, and put one third in the bank. It\n\n8      The probation officer’s report written in conjunction with defendant’s current\ncommitment related defendant had numerous tattoos, including swastikas in two places,\n“ ‘White’ ” on his upper left arm, and “ ‘Pride’ ” on his upper right arm. The record\ncontains no information concerning when or under what circumstances defendant\nobtained the tattoos.\n9      Defendant’s driving privilege was apparently revoked.\n\n\n                                            10.\n\fcould last as long as he was willing to stay. The other was a four-step program at the\nMission that assisted with job applications, job placement, sponsor help, and the like.\nThe residential program was for homeless only and was full, but the four-step program\nwould require defendant to check in and test four times a week. If released, defendant’s\npreference would be to go to the Bible Tabernacle program because of the length of the\nprogram, and the fact those involved worked specifically with people coming out of\nprison.\n          Defendant was willing to submit voluntarily to postrelease community\nsupervision. He felt it would give him a sense of structure and someone responsible to\ntalk to. As for living arrangements, defendant believed he had enough money to get a\nsmall apartment. In addition, a niece who lived in Oildale had said he could stay with\nher. Defendant would have no problem being subject to a search condition, submitting to\ndrug and alcohol tests, or being ordered to go to treatment and to NA and AA meetings.\nHe did not think it would be too much of a problem to stay away from alcohol; he got\nmigraines that he attributed to drinking alcohol and “pruno,” and did not feel he needed\nalcohol anymore. When he was younger, he was trying to forget things. Now he\n“need[ed] to live things.” Defendant professed not to be the same man as when he was “a\nreckless user” and when he went to prison.\n          Defendant admitted his current commitment was his fifth prison commitment. At\nthe time of his sentencing, he told the probation officer that, as far as drug use was\nconcerned, he tried a little bit of everything and considered himself to be a drug addict.\nHe also told the probation officer that he drank three to four quarts of beer and a bottle of\nwine or whiskey daily, if it was available. At the time, defendant did not realize he had a\nproblem with alcohol, which he made and continued to drink in prison.10 He realized he\nhad a serious problem with alcohol about three years before the hearing. He had no\n\n10        Defendant testified he only had alcohol three times in prison.\n\n\n                                               11.\n\fexplanation for why it took so long, even though he could now see that alcohol was\nprobably one of the driving factors behind his crimes.\n         Defendant acknowledged some inmates were in prison as long as him without\nincurring any disciplinary write-ups. Asked the difference between them and him, he\nresponded, “They didn’t get caught.” He also acknowledged he had spent most of his\nsentence in Level 3 closed custody due to the length of his sentence. A year and a half\nbefore the hearing, he was permitted to go to the dormitories. He had been involved in an\nAA and narcotics program when he was in “Old Folsom,” and participated for six or\nseven months. Then the riot happened and he was transferred to different prisons four or\nfive times. Each had a two-year waiting list for their programs. About a year before the\nhearing, the parole board changed things so that it was no longer mandatory to take NA\nor AA to get parole, but inmates could instead participate in voluntary programs on the\nyards.\n         While he was in prison on his current commitment, defendant took a vocational\njanitorial class. At the time of the hearing, he was taking a GED course. He did not take\nit years ago because it was not a requirement and getting in was difficult. Now, inmates\nbelow a certain grade level had to take a GED test or go back to school. Defendant was\nnot yet close to getting his GED, as he was not good in math. Being in Level 3 closed\ncustody meant a lot of classes and jobs were not available to him.\n         At the conclusion of the hearing, the court took the matter under submission and\nallowed defendant to submit a further response to the People’s opposition, along with\ndocumentation.11 In his response, defendant argued there was no evidence he posed a\n\n\n\n11     In part, defendant submitted postconviction progress reports, laudatory reports\nconcerning his work assignments and vocational education, and education progress\nreports and certificates of completion for numerous vocational education units, including\nthe Vocational Janitorial Services One Program. Defendant also presented a certificate of\ncompletion of the “ ‘40 Days of Purpose’ ” program, a certificate of appreciation for\n\n                                             12.\n\fcurrent unreasonable risk to public safety. He noted his strike offenses were remote in\ntime, contended his disciplinary record was for offenses not considered serious under the\ngoverning regulations, and observed he had not had a violent incident in more than three\nyears and had not had an incident involving drugs or alcohol in three and a half years.\nDefendant also chronicled his work, vocational, and educational activities, along with his\nself-help endeavors, other evidence of rehabilitation, and re-entry plans.\n       On August 8, 2014, the court issued a written ruling denying the petition. In\npertinent part, the court stated:\n\n       “[Defendant] is entitled to resentencing unless the People prove by a\n       preponderance of the evidence that [defendant] ‘would pose an\n       unreasonable risk of danger to the public safety.’ The court has considered\n       the petition, opposition and reply, along with the attachments and exhibits,\n       filed with the court in addition to the testimony presented.\n\n       “The court finds that the People have met their burden that [defendant]\n       would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public safety. The court\n       has considered all aspects of the information and evidence presented. The\n       court notes [defendant]’s committing offense was for evading a police\n       officer and for DUI. DUI is one of the most dangerous crimes the court\n       sees on a regular basis. Despite having two priors for DUI, albeit . . . they\n       are very old, and being sentenced to 25 years to life for an act during which\n       he was DUI, [defendant] continued to use alcohol in custody. This court\n       has a grave concern that if released [defendant] will consume alcohol and\n       drive again, thereby putting the public safety at significant, unreasonable\n       risk.”\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                               I\n                              The Applicable Legal Principles\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of section\n\n\nparticipating in a Victim’s Awareness Workshop, and letters from RiteWay Pumping, the\nBible Tabernacle, and the Mission at Kern County.\n\n\n                                             13.\n\f1170.126.12 (People v. Superior Court (Martinez) (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 979, 988-\n989.) If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate]’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate]’s disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (g).)\n       A.     A trial court’s ultimate determination regarding dangerousness lies within\n              its discretion; its ruling, therefore, is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n       The plain language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126 calls for an\nexercise of the sentencing court’s discretion. “ ‘Discretion is the power to make the\ndecision, one way or the other.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Carmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367,\n375.) “Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its\nexercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the\n\n\n12     “An inmate is eligible for resentencing if: [¶] (1) The inmate is serving an\nindeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (e) of Section 667 or subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 for a conviction of a\nfelony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c)\nof Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7.

Williams (1998) 17 Cal.4th\n148, 162 [abuse-of-discretion review asks whether ruling in question falls outside bounds\nof reason under applicable law and relevant facts].)\n       Under the clear language of section 1170.126, the ultimate determination that\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger is a discretionary one. We,\ntherefore, review that determination for abuse of discretion. Of course, if there is no\nevidence in the record to support the decision, the decision constitutes an abuse of\ndiscretion. (See In re Robert L. (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1066.)\n       B.     The burden of proof of preponderance of the evidence applies to proof of\n              the facts, not to the trial court’s ultimate determination.\n       Defendant asserts he cannot be denied resentencing unless the People proved\ndangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. Alternatively, he says, the People must at\nleast have proven the ultimate conclusion of dangerousness by a preponderance of the\nevidence. Although we agree preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate standard,\nwe disagree with defendant on its application to the ultimate determination.13\n\n              “The standard of proof, the United States Supreme Court has said,\n       ‘serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the\n       relative importance attached to the ultimate decision.’ [Citation.] At one\n       end of the spectrum is the ‘preponderance of the evidence’ standard, which\n       apportions the risk of error among litigants in roughly equal fashion.\n       [Citation.] At the other end of the spectrum is the ‘beyond a reasonable\n       doubt’ standard applied in criminal cases, in which ‘our society imposes\n       almost the entire risk of error upon itself.’ [Citation.] Between those two\n       standards is the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.\n       [Citation.] These three standards are codified in California’s Evidence\n\n13      The People do not dispute defendant’s claim the burden of proof lies with the\nprosecution. (E.g., People v. Flores (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1075-1076; People v.\nSuperior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1301, fn. 25 (Kaulick).) The\ntrial court here expressly placed the burden on the People.\n\n\n                                             15.\n\f       Code. Section 115 of that code states: ‘The burden of proof may require a\n       party to . . . establish the existence or nonexistence of a fact by a\n       preponderance of the evidence, by clear and convincing proof, or by proof\n       beyond a reasonable doubt. [¶] Except as otherwise provided by law, the\n       burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.’\n       (Italics added.)\n\n             “If the Legislature has not established a standard of proof, a court\n       must determine the appropriate standard by considering all aspects of the\n       law. [Citation.] No standard of proof is specified in section\n       [1170.126] . . . .\n\n               “ ‘The standard of proof that is required in a given instance has been\n       said to reflect “. . . the degree of confidence our society thinks [the\n       factfinder] should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a\n       particular type of adjudication.”. . . The standard of proof may therefore\n       vary, depending upon the gravity of the consequences that would result\n       from an erroneous determination of the issue involved.’ [Citations.]”\n       (People v. Arriaga (2014) 58 Cal.4th 950, 961-962.)\n       “In enacting section 1170.126 as part of Proposition 36, the issue before the voters\nwas not whether a defendant could or should be punished more harshly for a particular\naspect of his or her offense, but whether, having already been found to warrant an\nindeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender, he or she should now be eligible for\na lesser term.” (People v. Osuna (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1036.) Although voters\ncould have permitted automatic resentencing, under any and all circumstances, of those\neligible therefor, they did not do so. This demonstrates a recognition of two highly\nplausible scenarios: (1) Some inmates sentenced to indeterminate terms under the\noriginal version of the three strikes law for crimes not defined as serious or violent\nfelonies may have started out not posing any greater risk of danger than recidivists who\nwill now be sentenced to determinate terms as second strike offenders under the\nprospective provisions of the Act, but have become violent or otherwise dangerous while\nimprisoned, or (2) Enough time might have passed since some inmates committed their\ncriminal offenses so that those offenses no longer make such inmates dangerous, but\nother factors do. Because of the severe consequences to society that may result if a\n\n\n                                             16.\n\fdangerous inmate is resentenced as a second strike offender and released to the\ncommunity upon completion of his or her term with little or no supervision (see, e.g.,\n§ 3451) and without undergoing any suitability assessment (see, e.g., In re Lawrence\n(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1181, 1204), we believe it appropriate to apportion the risk of error in\nroughly equal fashion.\n       Division Three of the Second District Court of Appeal has stated that, where a\ncourt’s discretion under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) is concerned, the People bear\nthe burden of proving “dangerousness” by a preponderance of the evidence. (Kaulick,\nsupra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1305 & fn. 25; see Evid. Code, § 115.) That court\ndetermined this is so because “dangerousness is not a factor which enhances the sentence\nimposed when a defendant is resentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a\nhurdle which must be crossed in order for a defendant to be resentenced at all.” (Kaulick,\nsupra, at p. 1303.) Kaulick explained: “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and\nthose similarly situated to him, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life\nterm to which he was originally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him with an\nopportunity to be resentenced to a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is\nnonetheless still subject to the third strike sentence based on the facts established at the\ntime he was originally sentenced. As such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to\nmodify the sentence in his favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e.,\ndangerousness), and such factor need not be established by proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt to a jury.” (Ibid.)\n       In People v. Blakely (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1059-1062 (Blakely), we\nrejected the claim an inmate seeking resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126 had a\nSixth Amendment right to a jury determination, beyond a reasonable doubt, on the\nquestion of conduct constituting a disqualifying factor. We concluded that Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466 (Apprendi) and its progeny (e.g., Alleyne v. United\nStates (2013) 570 U.S. ___ [133 S.Ct. 2151]; Cunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S.\n\n                                             17.\n\f270 (Cunningham); Blakely v. Washington (2004) 542 U.S. 296) “do not apply to a\ndetermination of eligibility for resentencing under the Act.” (Blakely, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at p. 1060.) We also relied heavily on Kaulick.\n       In rejecting application of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, Kaulick\ndiscussed the United States Supreme Court’s conclusion in Dillon v. United States (2010)\n560 U.S. 817, 828 (Dillon), that “a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to have essential\nfacts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt do not apply to limits on downward\nsentence modifications due to intervening laws.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1304.) Kaulick found Dillon’s language applicable. Since the retrospective part of the\nAct is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate and\nprovides for a proceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward, any\nfacts found at such a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth\nAmendment issues. Thus, there is no constitutional requirement that the facts be\nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, at pp. 1304-1305.)14\n       Although in Blakely we applied Kaulick’s analysis to the initial determination of\neligibility for resentencing under the Act (Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061), it\napplies equally to the issue whether resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. A denial of an inmate’s petition does not\nincrease the penalty to which the inmate is already subject, but instead removes the\ninmate from the scope of an act of lenity on the part of the electorate to which he or she is\nnot constitutionally entitled. (Id. at p. 1062.) That the denial is based on a determination\nof dangerousness does not change that conclusion.\n\n14     Neither Descamps v. United States (2013) 570 U.S. ___ [133 S.Ct. 2276] nor\nPepper v. United States (2011) 562 U.S. 476 undermines Dillon or Kaulick’s reliance\nthereon. Unlike Dillon, Descamps dealt with judicial factfinding concerning a prior\nconviction used to enhance a sentence (Descamps, supra, 570 U.S. at pp. ___-___ [133\nS.Ct. at pp. 2281-2282]), while Pepper involved a plenary resentencing after the\ndefendant’s sentence had been set aside on appeal (Pepper, supra, 562 U.S. at p. 481).\n\n\n                                             18.\n\f       Kaulick found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness”\nby a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\nand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court can base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself.15 Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation.\n       Accordingly, we hold preponderance of the evidence is the applicable standard of\nproof, regardless whether we analyze the issue as one of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence\nor due process. (See People v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1076.)16\n       This does not, however, mean the trial court must apply that standard in making its\nultimate determination whether to resentence a petitioner, or we must review that\ndetermination for substantial evidence. Nor does it mean evidence of dangerousness\nmust preponderate over evidence of rehabilitation for resentencing to be denied.\n\n\n\n15      As noted, ante, we have previously discussed Kaulick in the context of the initial\ndetermination whether an inmate is eligible for resentencing under the Act. (Blakely,\nsupra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1058, 1060-1061; People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1033, 1039-1040.) Nothing we say here should be taken as disagreement with or\nmodification of those opinions. We deal here with a different aspect of the retrospective\nportion of the Act and a subject not before us in our prior cases.\n16     We recognize that in the case of people who are involuntarily committed as\nnarcotics addicts or for analogous reasons, the California Supreme Court has found the\nappropriate standard of proof to be beyond a reasonable doubt. (See, e.g., People v.\nThomas (1977) 19 Cal.3d 630, 637-638.) Defendant received the protections of that\nstandard of proof (and the right to a jury trial) at the time he was convicted of his\ncommitment offense and was found to have suffered his prior strike convictions. (People\nv. Nguyen (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1007, 1015; People v. Towers (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1273,\n1277.)\n\n\n                                              19.\n\f       The language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) expressly provides the petitioner\nshall be resentenced unless the court, in its discretion, makes a determination that\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. The statute\ndoes not say the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the People prove resentencing\nwould pose such a risk.\n       Considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126, we\nconclude the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,\nfacts from which a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety can reasonably be made. The reasons a trial court finds\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence\nshowing dangerousness versus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court’s\ndiscretion. The ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger is a discretionary one. While the determination must be supported by facts\nestablished by a preponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of\ndanger by a preponderance of the evidence. (See In re Robert L., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1065-1067 [discussing abuse of discretion and preponderance of the evidence\nstandards].)\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme.17 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to\nCunningham, “three terms of imprisonment [were] specified by statute for most offenses.\nThe trial court’s discretion in selecting among [those] options [was] limited by section\n1170, subdivision (b), which direct[ed] that ‘the court shall order imposition of the\n\n\n17     The determination of the appropriate penalty in a capital case “ ‘is “essentially\nmoral and normative [citation], and therefore . . . there is no burden of proof or burden of\npersuasion. [Citation.]” [Citation.]’ [Citations.]” (People v. McKinzie (2012) 54\nCal.4th 1302, 1362, disapproved on another ground in People v. Scott (2015) 61 Cal.4th\n363, 391, fn. 3.)\n\n\n                                            20.\n\fmiddle term, unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.’ ”\n(People v. Black (2007) 41 Cal.4th 799, 808, fn. omitted.) Trial courts had “broad\ndiscretion” to impose the lower or upper term instead of the middle term of imprisonment\n(People v. Scott (1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 349), and generally were required by the statutes\nand sentencing rules to state reasons for their discretionary sentencing choices (ibid.).\nSuch reasons had to be “supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the record” and\nreasonably related to the particular sentencing determination. (Ibid.; see former Cal.\nRules of Court, rule 4.420(b).) Even after the DSL was reformed and amended in\nresponse to Cunningham, so as to eliminate judicial factfinding in selection of the\nappropriate term when three possible prison terms are specified by statute, establishment\nof facts by a preponderance of the evidence remains necessary with respect to certain\ndiscretionary sentencing decisions. (See In re Coley (2012) 55 Cal.4th 524, 557-558.)18\n       In People v. Sandoval (2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 850-851, the California Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making its discretionary sentencing choices post-Cunningham, “the\ntrial court need only ‘state [its] reasons’ [citation]; it is not required to identify\naggravating and mitigating factors, apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, or\nspecify the ‘ultimate facts’ that ‘justify[] the term selected.’ [Citations.] Rather, the\ncourt must ‘state in simple language the primary factor or factors that support the exercise\nof discretion.’ [Citation.]” (Italics added.)\n       The trial court’s ultimate determination when considering a petition for\nresentencing under section 1170.126 is analogous to an evaluation of the relative weight\n\n18      After Cunningham concluded the DSL violated a defendant’s Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial (Cunningham, supra, 549 U.S. at p. 281), the Legislature amended\nsection 1170 so that “(1) the middle term is no longer the presumptive term absent\naggravating or mitigating facts found by the trial judge; and (2) a trial judge has the\ndiscretion to impose an upper, middle or lower term based on reasons he or she states.”\n(People v. Wilson (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 988, 992.) Subdivision (b) of section 1170\nstates the court “shall select the term which, in the court’s discretion, best serves the\ninterests of justice.”\n\n\n                                                21.\n\fof mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Such an evaluation “is not equivalent to a\nfactual finding.” (People v. Black, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.) It follows, then,\nthat the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, in that it\nneed not find resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not, pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means “ ‘more likely than not’ ”].)19\n       To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is\nthe court’s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review. Rather, its\nfinding will be upheld if it does not constitute an abuse of discretion, i.e., if it falls within\n\n\n19      We reject defendant’s claim that if there need only be substantial evidence of the\nunderlying facts, then review of the ultimate dangerousness determination for abuse of\ndiscretion is no more stringent than the highly deferential “some evidence” standard\napplicable to review of executive branch decisions in parole cases. (See In re\nRosenkrantz (2002) 29 Cal.4th 616, 658, 665.) Whatever the similarities between the\n“abuse of discretion” and “some evidence” standards (compare People v. Giordano\n(2007) 42 Cal.4th 644, 663 [abuse of discretion standard is “ ‘deferential’ ” but “ ‘not\nempty’ ”] with In re Lawrence, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1210 [“some evidence” standard is\n“unquestionably deferential” but “not toothless”]), examining the underlying facts for\nsubstantial evidence requires us to “ ‘review the entire record in the light most favorable\nto the judgment to determine whether it discloses evidence that is reasonable, credible,\nand of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the [challenged fact by a\npreponderance of the evidence]. [Citations.]’ [Citation.] We resolve all conflicts in the\nevidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and we indulge every\nreasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence. [Citation.]”\n(People v. Wong (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1444.) Moreover, as we have observed,\nthe language of section 1170.126, subdivisions (f) and (g) expressly allocates to the trial\ncourt’s discretion the ultimate determination of dangerousness. A review of the trial\ncourt’s exercise of discretion requires a determination whether that court reasonably and\nnonarbitrarily found resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety, and not merely a review of whether evidence established the facts\nof that inmate’s criminal and disciplinary history.

Rodrigues, supra, 8 Cal.4th at pp. 1124-1125.)\n\n\n                                               22.\n\f“the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered. [Citations.]” (People\nv. Giminez (1975) 14 Cal.3d 68, 72.) The facts upon which the court’s finding of\nunreasonable risk is based must be proven by the People by a preponderance of the\nevidence, however, and are themselves subject to our review for substantial evidence. If\na factor (for example, that the petitioner participated in a riot, is violent due to repeated\ninstances of mutual combat, etc.) is not established by a preponderance of the evidence, it\ncannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk. (See People v. Cluff (2001) 87\nCal.App.4th 991, 998 [trial court abuses its discretion when factual findings critical to\ndecision find no support in record]; cf. People v. Read (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 685, 689-\n691 [where trial court erroneously determined the defendant was statutorily ineligible for\nprobation, reviewing court had to decide whether trial court gave sufficient other reasons,\nsupported by facts of case, for probation denial].)\n       C.       Section 1170.126 does not establish or contain a presumption a petitioner’s\n                sentence must be reduced.\n       Subdivision (f) of section 1170.126 provides that an eligible petitioner “shall be\nresentenced” as a second strike offender “unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” Defendant contends this language creates a presumption in favor of\nresentencing.\n       Defendant first points to the “shall”/“unless” formulation employed by the statute.\nUnder People v. Guinn (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1130, 1141-1142 and its progeny (e.g.,\nPeople v. Murray (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 277, 282; People v. Ybarra (2008) 166\nCal.App.4th 1069, 1089), all of which deal with section 190.5, subdivision (b),20\n\n\n\n20     Section 190.5, subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part: “The penalty for a\ndefendant found guilty of murder in the first degree, in any case in which one or more\nspecial circumstances . . . has been found to be true . . . , who was 16 years of age or\nolder and under the age of 18 years at the time of the commission of the crime, shall be\n\n                                              23.\n\fdefendant argues that at the time Proposition 36 was enacted, it had long been the law\nthat the “shall” option was the presumptive punishment, and so voters must have intended\nthis then-prevailing judicial interpretation to apply. (See People v. Harrison (1989) 48\nCal.3d 321, 329; People v. Weidert (1985) 39 Cal.3d 836, 844.)\n       The California Supreme Court disapproved the foregoing line of cases in People v.\nGutierrez (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1354, 1370, 1387. Leaving aside constitutional questions\nraised by establishing a presumption in favor of life without parole for juveniles after the\nUnited States Supreme Court’s opinion in Miller v. Alabama (2012) 567 U.S. ___ [132\nS.Ct. 2455], the state high court’s review of the text of section 190.5, subdivision (b) led\nit to conclude the syntax is ambiguous concerning any presumption. The court stated: “It\nis not unreasonable to read this text . . . to mean that a court ‘shall’ impose life without\nparole unless ‘at the discretion of the court’ a sentence of 25 years to life appears more\nappropriate. [Citation.] But it is equally reasonable to read the text to mean that a court\nmay select one of the two penalties in the exercise of its discretion, with no presumption\nin favor of one or the other. The latter reading accords with common usage. For\nexample, if a teacher informed her students that ‘you must take a final exam or, at your\ndiscretion, write a term paper,’ it would be reasonable for the students to believe they\nwere equally free to pursue either option. The text of section 190.5[, subdivision ](b)\ndoes not clearly indicate whether the statute was intended to make life without parole the\npresumptive sentence.” (People v. Gutierrez, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 1371.)\n       The same example can be applied to the syntax of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). Because a reading that affords no presumption “accords with common\nusage” (People v. Gutierrez, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 1371), we reject the notion voters\nmust have intended there to be a presumption in favor of resentencing or that courts have\n\n\nconfinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole or, at the\ndiscretion of the court, 25 years to life.”\n\n\n                                              24.\n\fonly limited discretion to deny resentencing (see People v. Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at\npp. 377-378 [discussing courts’ circumscribed power to depart, under § 1385, subd. (a)\nand People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497, 529-530 (Romero), from\nsentencing norm established by three strikes law]). A court considering whether to\nresentence an eligible petitioner under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) has\ncircumscribed discretion in the sense it can only refuse to resentence if it finds that to do\nso would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety on the facts of the\nparticular case before it.21 This does not mean, however, its discretion is circumscribed\nin the sense it can only find dangerousness in extraordinary cases. To the contrary, it can\ndo so in any case in which such a finding is rational under the totality of the\ncircumstances.\n       Such a conclusion comports with the plain language of the statute. Moreover, a\nconclusion resentencing to a second strike term is a generally mandatory presumption\nfrom which courts can depart only in extraordinary cases, as defendant asserts, would run\ndirectly contrary to the intent of the voters in passing the Act. (See People v. Gutierrez,\nsupra, 58 Cal.4th at pp. 1371-1372 [examining legislative history and voter intent in\nattempt to resolve statutory ambiguity].) As we stated in People v. Osuna, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at page 1036, “ ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’\n[citation].” Thus, although one purpose of the Act was to save taxpayer dollars (People\nv. Osuna, supra, at p. 1037), “[i]t is clear the electorate’s intent was not to throw open the\nprison doors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or\nviolent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or posing little or\n\n21     Because a trial court can deny resentencing under section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f) only upon a finding of unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, a trial\ncourt would abuse its discretion, as in a Romero situation, by refusing to resentence a\npetitioner because of antipathy toward the Act or a personal belief a particular defendant\ndeserved an indeterminate term for reasons other than dangerousness. (See People v.\nWilliams, supra, 17 Cal.4th at pp. 159, 161.)\n\n\n                                             25.\n\fno risk to the public” (id. at p. 1038, second italics added). Had voters intended to permit\nretention of an indeterminate term only in extraordinary cases, they would have said so in\nsubdivision (f) of section 1170.126, rather than employing language that affords courts\nbroad discretion to find dangerousness. They also would not have afforded the trial court\nthe power to consider any evidence it determined to be relevant to the issue as they did in\nsubdivision (g)(3) of the statute.\n       D.     Section 1170.18, subdivision (c), enacted pursuant to Proposition 47, does\n              not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f).\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 reduced to\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\npetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its\ndiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (b).)22\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision\ndefendant contends applies to his petition for resentencing under Proposition 36.\n\n\n22    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n\n\n                                                26.\n\fSubdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used throughout this Code,\n‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the\npetitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of\nsubparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.” Section 667,\nsubdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called “super strike”\noffenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n              “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\n\n\n\n\n                                            27.\n\fdefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.23\n       “ ‘In interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] ‘ “The fundamental purpose of statutory\nconstruction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of\nthe law.

[Citations.]” (People v. Jones (1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142, 1146.)\n       To determine intent, “ ‘we look first to the words themselves. [Citations.]’ ”\n(People v.

Such an inmate need not wait to file a petition under\nProposition 47 until the trial court’s ruling on the inmate’s petition under the Act is final.\nA trial court is not divested of jurisdiction over a Proposition 47 petition by the fact a\npetition under the Act is pending, whether in a trial court or a Court of Appeal, with\nrespect to the same inmate. (Cf. People v. Mayfield (1993) 5 Cal.4th 220, 222-227;\nPeople v. Johnson (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1183, 1256-1257; People v. Alanis (2008) 158\nCal.App.4th 1467, 1472-1473.)

On its face, “[a]s used throughout this Code,” as\nemployed in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), clearly and unambiguously refers to the\nPenal Code, not merely section 1170.18 or the other provisions contained in\nProposition 47.

Vasquez (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 763, 766.) This does not mean, however, that\nthe definition contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) must inexorably be read into\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f). (Cf. Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist., supra,\n119 Cal.App.4th at p. 1255.) “The literal language of a statute does not prevail if it\nconflicts with the lawmakers’ intent . . . . [Citations.]” (People v.

[Citation.]” (In re Michele D., supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 606; accord,\nPeople v. Ledesma (1997) 16 Cal.4th 90, 95.)\n       Thus, “ ‘we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to\nbe achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,\ncontemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the\nstatute is a part. [Citations.]’ [Citation.] We also ‘ “refer to other indicia of the voters’\nintent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.”\n[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1034.) We\nconsider “the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation” (Dyna-Med,\nInc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1387), as well as “the\nwider historical circumstances” of the statute’s or statutes’ enactment (ibid.). “ ‘Using\nthese extrinsic aids, we “select the construction that comports most closely with the\napparent intent of the [electorate], with a view to promoting rather than defeating the\ngeneral purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd\nconsequences.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1034-1035.)\n       Proposition 47 and the Act address related, but not identical, subjects. As we\nexplain, reading them together, and considering section 1170.18, subdivision (c) in the\ncontext of the statutory framework as a whole (see People v. Acosta, supra, 29 Cal.4th at\np. 112; Lakin v. Watkins Associated Industries (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 658-659; In re\nCindy B. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 771, 781), we conclude its literal meaning does not\ncomport with the purpose of the Act, and applying it to resentencing proceedings under\nthe Act would frustrate, rather than promote, that purpose and the intent of the electorate\nin enacting both initiative measures (see People v. Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1,\n5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n                                              30.\n\f               “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n       their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n       commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n       imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘. . . to deter repeat offenders and,\n       at some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’ ” (People v. Cooper (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 823-\n       824.)24\n       A few months before the November 6, 2012, general election, the California\nSupreme Court observed: “One aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven\ncontroversial is that the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not\nonly when . . . a defendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or\nviolent felonies] is convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she\nis convicted of any offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so\neven when the current, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely\n\n24      The foregoing applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added\nsection 1170.12 to the Penal Code. The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “ ‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.’ ” (Historical and\nStatutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen. Code (2015 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 376.)\n\n\n                                             31.\n\fperceived as relatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-\n529.)\n        Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of Prop. 36, § 1, p. 105.)25\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto release existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious cases, as would be\nthe result if the definition of “ ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ ” contained\nin section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing proceedings under\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a result is amply\ndemonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory under the Act for\na wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a prior conviction for\na “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)), and that an inmate is\nrendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an array of reasons\nbeyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126, subd. (e)(2)).\n        The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, uncodified section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an\nexercise of the public power of the people of the State of California for the protection of\nthe health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be\nliberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.,\nsupra, text of Prop. 36, p. 110, some italics omitted.) As we explained in People v.\n\n\n25     The voter information guides for both the November 6, 2012, general election\n(which contains Prop. 36) and the November 4, 2014, general election (which contains\nProp. 47) can be accessed at <http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/\nvoter-information-guides/> [as of Oct. 27, 2016].\n\n\n                                             32.\n\fOsuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036, “Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three\nstrikes law somewhat [citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’\n[citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.

Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act shall\nbe broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18 states:\n“This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter Information\nGuide, Gen. Elec., supra, text of Prop. 47, p. 74.) Proposition 47 requires misdemeanor\nsentences for various drug possession and property offenses, unless the perpetrator has a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender\nregistration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c). (Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350,\nsubd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5, subd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a,\nsubd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).) Section 1170.18 renders\nineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current offense would now be a\nmisdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for an\noffense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\n\n                                             33.\n\fnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on Proposition 36 — enacted\na scant two years earlier — which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nstill be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For instance, the “Official Title and Summary”\nstated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47 would “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons\nserving felony sentences for these offenses [(i.e., offenses that require misdemeanor\nsentences under the measure),] unless court finds unreasonable public safety risk.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., supra, official title and summary of Prop. 47,\np. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do, the Legislative Analyst stated:\n“This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders convicted of nonserious and\nnonviolent property and drug crimes. The measure also allows certain offenders who\nhave been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for reduced sentences.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec., supra, analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35,\nitalics added.) With respect to the resentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst\nexplained: “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences for the\nabove crimes [(i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen property, writing bad checks,\ncheck forgery, and drug possession)] to apply to have their felony sentences reduced to\nmisdemeanor sentences. In addition, certain offenders who have already completed a\nsentence for a felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\nfelony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who has committed\na specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their conviction changed. In\naddition, the measure states that a court is not required to resentence an offender\ncurrently serving a felony sentence if the court finds it likely that the offender will\ncommit a specified severe crime. Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be\non state parole for one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\np. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The “Argument in Favor of\n\n                                             34.\n\fProposition 47” talked of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop wasting\nprison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in prisons\nfor nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation guide, Gen. Elec., supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38.) The\n“Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47” reiterated these themes, and never\nsuggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act. (See\nVoter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., supra, rebuttal to argument against Prop. 47, p. 39.)\nAlthough the “Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47” asserted 10,000 inmates\nwould be eligible for early release under the measure, and that many of them had prior\nconvictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and home burglary” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec., supra, rebuttal to argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), it\ncontained no suggestion the early release provisions would extend to inmates whose\ncurrent offenses remained felonies under the Act. The same is true of the discussion of\nresentencing contained in the “Argument Against Proposition 47.” (Voter Information\nGuide, Gen. Elec., supra, argument against Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “ ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ ” contained in section\n1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode . . . .” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are mindful “it has long been settled that ‘[t]he enacting body is deemed to be\naware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is\nenacted’ [citation], ‘and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof’ [citation].\n‘This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]”\n(People v. Superior Court (Cervantes), supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1015; accord, In re\nLance W. (1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 890, fn. 11.) Thus, we presume voters were aware\n\n                                             35.\n\f“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as\nnevertheless having no fixed definition. (People v. Garcia (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 763,\n769-770; People v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1075.) Because nowhere in the\nballot materials for Proposition 47 was it called to voters’ attention the definition of the\nphrase contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) would apply to resentencing\nproceedings under the Act, we simply cannot conclude voters intended Proposition 47 to\nalter the Act in that respect.26 Voters are not asked or presumed to be able to discern all\npotential effects of a proposed initiative measure; this is why they are provided with voter\ninformation guides containing not only the actual text of such a measure, but also a\nneutral explanation and analysis by the Legislative Analyst and arguments in support of\nand in opposition to the measure. As we have already observed, none of those materials\nso much as hinted that Proposition 47 could have the slightest effect on resentencing\nunder the Act. (Cf. Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th\n\n\n\n\n26     That one of the authors of both measures may have so intended (St. John &\nGerber, Prop. 47 jolts landscape of California justice system (Nov. 5, 2014) Los\nAngeles Times <http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/\nla-me-ff-pol-proposition47-20141106-story.html> [as of Oct. 27, 2016]; see Stanford\nLaw School Directory — Michael Romano <https://law.stanford.edu/directory/\nmichael-romano/> [as of Oct. 27, 2016]) is, in light of the information actually conveyed\nto voters, of no import (see People v. Garcia (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1166, 1175-1176, fn. 5;\nKaufman & Broad Communities, Inc. v. Performance Plastering, Inc. (2005) 133\nCal.App.4th 26, 30).\n        The concurring opinion cites People v. Cordova (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 543, 560-\n564, review granted August 31, 2016, S236179, as demonstrating the question whether\nProposition 47 would affect petitions under the Act was widely debated in the state prior\nto the election. (Conc. opn. of Peña, J., pp. 4-5, post.) We are aware of no California\nSupreme Court authority identifying Internet and media sources as reliable bases for\nascertaining voters’ intent.\n\n\n                                             36.\n\fat pp. 1255-1256 [legislative history of enactment included information bill would add\ndefinition of particular term to Pub. Contract Code].)27\n       Nor can we infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s definition\nto proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only appears in\nthose sections of the Penal Code. The only resentencing mentioned in the Proposition 47\nballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose current offenses would be reduced to\nmisdemeanors, not those who would still warrant second strike felony terms. There is a\nhuge difference, both legally and in public safety risked, between someone with multiple\nprior serious and/or violent felony convictions whose current offense is (or would be, if\ncommitted today) a misdemeanor, and someone whose current offense is a felony.\nAccordingly, treating the two groups differently for resentencing purposes does not lead\nto absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n       We recognize it is an established rule of statutory construction “that when statutes\nare in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like meanings.\n[Citations.]” (People v. Caudillo (1978) 21 Cal.3d 562, 585, overruled on another ground\nin People v. Martinez (1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 229, 237, fn. 6 & disapproved on another\nground in People v. Escobar (1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 749-751 & fn. 5; see Robbins v.\nOmnibus R. Co. (1867) 32 Cal. 472, 474.) We question whether Proposition 36 and\nProposition 47 are truly in pari materia: That phrase means “[o]n the same subject;\nrelating to the same matter” (Black’s Law Dict. (9th ed. 2009) p. 862), and the two\nmeasures (albeit with some overlap) address different levels of offenses and offenders. In\nany event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining probable\n\n\n27    For the same reasons, we reject any suggestion the definition contained in section\n1170.18, subdivision (c) was intended to clarify the true meaning of “unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety” as used in section 1170.126, subdivision (f). (Cf. Re-Open\nRambla, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1499, 1511; In re Connie M.\n(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1225, 1238.)\n\n\n                                             37.\n\flegislative intent” (Stone v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 521, fn. 10); they are\n“mere guides and will not be applied so as to defeat the underlying legislative intent\notherwise determined [citation]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com.,\nsupra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1391).\n       The Act was intended to reform the three strikes law while keeping intact that\nscheme’s core commitment to public safety. Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of nearly universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned — and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\nwisdom of the legislative choice” (Bernard v. Foley (2006) 39 Cal.4th 794, 813) —\nconstraining that discretion so that all but the worst felony offenders are released\nmanifestly does not, nor does it comport with the voters’ intent in enacting either\nmeasure. Accordingly, Proposition 47 has no effect on defendant’s petition for\nresentencing under the Act.28\n\n28      Were we to find section 1170.18, subdivision (c) modifies section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), we would conclude it does not do so retroactively. Section 3 — “No part\nof [the Penal Code] is retroactive, unless expressly so declared” — is the default rule.\n(People v. Brown (2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319.) In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740, 744-\n745, 747-748, which stands for the proposition that absent a “saving clause” providing\nfor prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to apply to all\ncases not yet final on the statute’s effective date, does not control, because applying the\ndefinition of “ ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ ” contained in section\n1170.18, subdivision (c) to petitions for resentencing under the Act does not reduce\npunishment for a particular criminal offense. (See People v. Brown, supra, 54 Cal.4th at\npp. 324-325.)\n        We believe, however, that a finding of nonretroactivity inexorably leads to the\npossibility of prospective-only application, and prospective-only application of\nProposition 47’s definition to resentencing petitions under the Act would raise serious,\nperhaps insurmountable, equal protection issues. (Indeed, the parties here engage in a\nspirited argument concerning equal protection.) “Mindful of the serious constitutional\nquestions that might arise were we to accept a literal construction of the statutory\n\n                                             38.\n\f       E.     The focus in a section 1170.126, subdivision (f) analysis is on whether the\n              petitioner currently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n       Defendant contends there must be a “logical nexus” between the factors\nconsidered in the trial court’s decision and current dangerousness. In support, he relies,\nin part, on parole cases.\n       In discussing the “some evidence” standard applicable in parole cases, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court has stated: “This standard is unquestionably deferential, but\ncertainly is not toothless, and ‘due consideration’ of the specified factors requires more\nthan rote recitation of the relevant factors with no reasoning establishing a rational nexus\nbetween those factors and the necessary basis for the ultimate decision — the\ndetermination of current dangerousness.” (In re Lawrence, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1210.)\n       Although we decline to decide how and to what extent parole cases inform the\ndecision whether to resentence a petitioner under the Act or our review of such a\ndecision, we agree with defendant that the proper focus is on whether the petitioner\ncurrently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (Cf. In re Shaputis\n(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1241, 1254; In re Lawrence, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1214.) We also\nagree a trial court may properly deny resentencing under the Act based solely on\nimmutable facts such as a petitioner’s criminal history “only if those facts support the\nultimate conclusion that an inmate continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public\nsafety. [Citation.]” (In re Lawrence, supra, at p. 1221.) “ ‘[T]he relevant inquiry is\nwhether [a petitioner’s prior criminal and/or disciplinary history], when considered in\nlight of other facts in the record, are such that they continue to be predictive of current\ndangerousness many years [later]. This inquiry is . . . an individualized one, and cannot\nbe undertaken simply by examining the circumstances of the crime in isolation, without\n\n\nlanguage, and of our obligation wherever possible both to carry out the intent of the\nelectorate and to construe statutes so as to preserve their constitutionality [citations]”\n(People v. Skinner (1985) 39 Cal.3d 765, 769), we rest our holding on the reasoning set\nout in our opinion, ante.\n\n\n                                             39.\n\fconsideration of the passage of time or the attendant changes in the inmate’s\npsychological or mental attitude. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (In re Shaputis, supra, 44\nCal.4th at pp. 1254-1255.)\n\n                                             II*\n                                 The Trial Court’s Ruling\n       Applying the foregoing principles, we conclude defendant has not borne his\nburden on appeal of establishing the trial court’s ruling exceeds the bounds of reason.\nDefendant had a longstanding substance abuse problem, involving both alcohol and\ndrugs. As the trial court noted in its written denial of the petition for resentencing,\ndespite having two prior convictions for driving under the influence and being sentenced\nto prison for 25 years to life for an offense during which he was driving under the\ninfluence, defendant continued his substance abuse in prison. The trial court was not\nrequired to ignore this past behavior. Although defendant clearly and commendably took\nsteps to change his life and, insofar as the evidence showed, had been sober for some\ntime, the evidence also showed him to have relapsed in the past. In addition, although\ndefendant professed to have realized that actions have consequences and to take\nresponsibility for his actions, probation officers’ reports (which the court considered\nwithout objection) showed defendant made similar pronouncements in the past and yet\ncontinued to offend. His explanations for his past misconduct, both in and out of prison,\nsuggested he tended to minimize that responsibility when confronted with those actions.\nTaking all the circumstances into account, the concerns expressed by the trial court in its\nruling were neither unfounded nor unreasonable.\n       On appeal, defendant presents numerous arguments why his petition should have\nbeen granted. As was the case with his testimony at the hearing, they tend to downplay\nthe seriousness and potential consequences of his behavior. In any event, “[a] record\n\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n\n\n                                             40.\n\fpresenting facts on which reasonable minds may differ is not a record establishing an\nabuse of discretion.” (People v. Moya (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 1307, 1313, fn. 2.)\n                                    DISPOSITION\n      The order denying the petition is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                               _____________________\n                                                                  DETJEN, Acting P.J.\nI CONCUR:\n\n\n _____________________\n SMITH, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                           41.\n\fPEÑA, J.,\n       I concur in the judgment and the majority opinion with the exception of part I.D. I\nagree defendant Victor Buford may not take advantage of Proposition 47’s1 newly\nenacted definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” as provided in Penal\nCode section 1170.18, subdivision (c) (§ 1170.18(c)). I do so not because there is any\nambiguity in the language used in section 1170.18(c) or the notion that the statute does\nnot mean what it says, i.e., that the new definition applies “throughout this Code.”\nRather, in my view, there is no indication the electorate, in enacting section 1170.18(c),\nintended it to apply retroactively to resentencing determinations under Proposition 36, the\nThree Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (the Act).2\nI.     After November 4, 2014, the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” in\n       Section 1170.18(c) applies throughout the Penal Code\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, long past the time of defendant’s resentencing hearing.\nUnless the legislation was designed or intended to apply retroactively, the definition in\nsection 1170.18(c) cannot apply to defendant. This is the only inquiry we must make to\nresolve the issue of whether the definition in section 1170.18(c) applies to defendant.\n\n\n1The Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014)).\n2The  issue of whether Proposition 47’s definition of unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety applies in Proposition 36 resentencing proceedings is pending before the California\nSupreme Court in People v. Chaney (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1391, review granted\nFebruary 18, 2015, S223676, and People v. Valencia (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 514, review\ngranted February 18, 2015, S223825.\n\fHowever, the majority has opted to determine whether the new definition applies to any\nresentencing provisions for this or any future petitions under the Act. I respectfully\ndisagree with the majority’s analysis and conclusion on this broader issue.\n\n               “‘When construing a statute, we must “ascertain the intent of the\n       Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.”’ [Citations.] ‘[W]e\n       begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary\n       meaning.’ [Citation.] ‘If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,\n       then we need go no further.’ [Citation.] If, however, the language supports\n       more than one reasonable construction, we may consider ‘a variety of\n       extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to\n       be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous\n       administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is\n       a part.’ [Citation.] Using these extrinsic aids, we ‘select the construction\n       that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with\n       a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,\n       and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.’\n       [Citation.]” (People v. Sinohui (2002) 28 Cal.4th 205, 211-212.)\n       Where the statutory language is so clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nstatutory construction or to resort to legislative materials or other outside sources.\n(Quarterman v. Kefauver (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1371.) Absent ambiguity, it is\npresumed the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure, and\nthe courts may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to a presumed intent not\napparent in its language. (People v. ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court (1996) 14 Cal.4th\n294, 301.)\n       In determining whether the words enacted here are unambiguous, we do not write\non a blank slate. For example, in Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) 119\nCal.App.4th 1241, 1255, the court stated there “is nothing ambiguous about the phrase\n‘as used in this code.’” It held the definition of “Emergency, as used in this code”\napplied to the entire Public Contract Code, and it was not limited to a particular chapter,\narticle, or division of that code. Also, in People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153,\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f166, the court held: “The words ‘as in this code provided’ (Penal Code, § 182) refer to\nthe Penal Code.”\n      In a similar vein, the court in People v. Leal (2004) 33 Cal.4th 999, 1007-1008,\napplied the plain meaning rule as follows:\n\n              “The statutory language of the provision defining ‘duress’ in each of\n      the rape statutes is clear and unambiguous. The definition of ‘duress’ in\n      both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n      this section, “duress” means ….’ (§§ 261, subd. (b), 262, subd. (c).) This\n      clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the definitions of\n      ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other sexual offenses.\n\n             “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n      into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n      sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n      its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n      incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n      well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n      observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n      the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n      “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n      rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n      immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n      meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n      lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n              “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n      providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n      has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n      “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n      construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n      meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n      is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n      compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n      analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n      “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n      ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n      to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n      [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n\n\n                                             3.\n\f       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       The majority pays lip service to the plain meaning rule and then ignores it. While\nacknowledging the language used is unambiguous, it nonetheless engages in statutory\nconstruction to determine whether the electorate really intended to say what it actually\nenacted. The end result is a rewriting of the statute so that it comports with the majority’s\nview of what the voters really intended. The majority has rewritten section 1170.18(c) so\nthat it now states: “As used in this section only, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’ means ….” (Italics added.) The majority does so without providing a compelling\nreason to do so and without showing the plain language used has a “‘meaning [that] is\n“‘repugnant to the general purview of the act.’”’” (People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p.\n1008.) Because the Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or\ncontradictory to the Act, nor does the majority claim the definition is repugnant to the\ngeneral purview of Proposition 47. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the\nmajority on this part of the opinion.\n       I note the Sixth District Court of Appeal in People v. Esparza (2015) 242\nCal.App.4th 726, 734-737, has reached the same result as the majority here under nearly\nidentical reasoning. There the court seemingly acknowledges that applying the plain\nmeaning rule would not lead to absurd results. However, like the majority here, the court\nrefused to give the words used their unambiguous, ordinary meaning, stating “we would\nneed the most compelling proof that the voters intended what we see as an unreasonable\nand counterintuitive result.” (Id. at p. 737.)\n       Subsequently, the Sixth Appellate District, in an opinion authored by one of the\njustices who concurred in the Esparza decision, reversed position after further reflection\nand further research on the public debate surrounding the passage of Proposition 47.\n(People v. Cordova (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 543, 552, fn. 8, review granted Aug. 31,\n\n                                                 4.\n\f2016, S236179.) The majority in Cordova extensively outlined in the opinion how the\nquestion of whether Proposition 47 could affect petitions under the Act was widely\ndebated in the state by opponents of the measure. (Cordova, supra, at pp. 560-564.)\n       The majority here dismisses these sources of information stating, “We are aware\nof no California Supreme Court authority identifying Internet and media sources as\nreliable bases for ascertaining voters’ intent.” (Maj. opn., ante, at fn. 26, ¶ 2, p. 37.)\nHowever, the Cordova case cites two such cases—Brosnahan v. Brown (1982) 32 Cal.3d\n236 and Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Equalization (1978)\n22 Cal.3d 208—that considered other informative sources on voter intent. Conversely,\nthe majority has cited to no case or authority that confines or otherwise limits the search\nfor voters’ intent to ballot summaries and arguments. I quote from the Brosnahan case:\n\n              “Finally, petitioners insist that the complexity of Proposition 8 may\n       have led to confusion or deception among voters, who were assertedly\n       uninformed regarding the contents of the measure. Yet, as was the case in\n       both Amador and FPPC,[3] Proposition 8 received widespread publicity.\n       Newspaper, radio and television editorials focused on its provisions, and\n       extensive public debate involving candidates, letters to the editor, etc.,\n       described the pros and cons of the measure.… [¶] … [¶]\n\n               “Petitioners’ entire argument that, in approving Proposition 8, the\n       voters must have been misled or confused is based upon the improbable\n       assumption that the people did not know what they were doing.… Rather,\n       in accordance with our tradition, ‘we ordinarily should assume that the\n       voters who approved a constitutional amendment “… have voted\n       intelligently upon an amendment to their organic law, the whole text of\n       which was supplied each of them prior to the election and which they must\n       be assumed to have duly considered.”’ [Citations.]” (Brosnahan v. Brown,\n       supra, 32 Cal.3d at pp. 251-252.)\n\n\n\n3“FPPC”   refers to Fair Political Practices Com. v. Superior Court (1979) 25 Cal.3d 33,\n42 (“Given the widespread public debate of initiatives, the explanations in the ballot\npamphlets and in the media, … it is unreasonable to assume the initiative measures\nreceive less scrutiny than proposed legislation.” (Italics added.))\n\n                                               5.\n\f       The majority in Cordova has debunked the arguments relied upon in Esparza and\nthe majority opinion in this case regarding what the voters must have intended based on\nlegislative history and arguments for and against the passage of Proposition 47.\nHowever, until further clarification from our California Supreme Court, I rely, as I must,\non the plain meaning rule. (People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at pp. 1007-1008.)\nII.    Section 1170.18(c) has no application to defendant’s resentencing under the\n       Act\n       I do concur in the result because there is nothing in Proposition 47 to indicate the\ndefinition enacted under section 1170.18(c) is to be applied retroactively to defendant\nunder the Act.\n       I begin my analysis with section 3 of the Penal Code, which provides that “[n]o\npart of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent.\nWhen the Legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear,” section 3 provides the\ndefault rule. (People v. Brown (2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319.) Proposition 47 is silent on\nthe question of whether it applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act. The\nanalysis of Proposition 47 by the legislative analyst and the arguments for and against\nProposition 47 are also silent on this question. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014) pp. 34-39.) Because the statute contains no express declaration that\nsection 1170.18(c) applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act, and there is no\nclearly implied intent of retroactivity in the legislative history, the default rule applies.\nDefendant cites In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 to argue retroactive application.\n       In Estrada, the court stated:\n\n       “When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it\n       has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe\n       and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission\n       of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must\n       have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now\n\n                                                6.\n\f       deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\n       constitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter\n       punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its\n       passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not\n       final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to\n       conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a\n       conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.” (In re\n       Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       Defendant argues that under the Estrada case, unless there is a “savings clause”\nproviding for prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to\napply to all cases not yet reduced to a final judgment on the statute’s effective date. (In\nre Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at pp. 744-745, 747-748.) However, the Estrada case has\nbeen revisited by our Supreme Court on several occasions. In People v. Brown, supra, 54\nCal.4th at page 324, the court stated: “Estrada is today properly understood, not as\nweakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in [Penal\nCode] section 3, but rather as informing the rule’s application in a specific context by\narticulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment\nfor a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments.” “The\nholding in Estrada was founded on the premise that ‘“[a] legislative mitigation of the\npenalty for a particular crime represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or\nthe different treatment is sufficient to meet the legitimate ends of the criminal law.”’”\n(Id. at p. 325.) In Brown, the court did not apply the Estrada rule because “a statute\nincreasing the rate at which prisoners may earn credits for good behavior does not\nrepresent a judgment about the needs of the criminal law with respect to a particular\ncriminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference of retroactive intent.”\n(People v. Brown, supra, at p. 325.)\n       Similarly here, Estrada does not control because applying the definition of\n“unreasonable risk to public safety” in Proposition 47 to petitions for resentencing under\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\fthe Act does not reduce punishment for a particular crime.4 Instead, the downward\nmodification of a sentence authorized by the Act is dependent not just on the current\noffense but on any number of unlimited factors related to the individual offender,\nincluding criminal conviction history, disciplinary and rehabilitation records, and “[a]ny\nother evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n       For this reason also, defendant’s argument his equal protection rights would be\nviolated if he is denied retroactive application is unavailing. In light of the unlimited\nfactors related to individual offenders that inform the exercise of discretion, no two\nindividual offenders may be said to be similarly situated for purposes of resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant fails to establish he has been denied equal protection as against\nany other similarly situated individual.\n       Because section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” does not apply retroactively to the Act, the sentencing court applied the correct\nstandard in exercising its discretion to not resentence defendant. Since defendant has\nfailed to show an abuse of that discretion, I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the\njudgment.\n\n                                                          ___________________________\n                                                                              PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n4The majority in People v. Cordova, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at page 568 acknowledged\nEstrada’s limited applicability, but found in favor of retroactivity for other reasons not\nurged here by defendant nor briefed by the People. As the retroactivity issue is currently\npending, I will wait for guidance from our Supreme Court on this issue.\n\n                                              8.\n\f",

Code,\n§ 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by Pen. Code, § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a\npetition pursuant to the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (hereafter Proposition 36 or the\nAct) to have his sentence recalled and to be resentenced.1 (§ 1170.126, subd. (b).)\nFollowing a hearing, the trial court concluded resentencing would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety and denied the petition.\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we hold the People have the burden of\nproving, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts on which a finding that resentencing a\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety reasonably can be\nbased. Those facts are reviewed for substantial evidence. We further hold, the\npreponderance of the evidence standard does not apply to the trial court’s determination\nregarding dangerousness, nor does section 1170.126, subdivision (f), create a\npresumption in favor of resentencing. The ultimate decision — whether resentencing an\ninmate would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety — instead lies within\nthe sound discretion of the trial court. We also hold section 1170.18, subdivision (c) does\nnot modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f). As we explain in the unpublished portion\nof our opinion, we find no abuse of discretion and affirm.\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY*\n       At approximately 3:30 a.m. on October 15, 1995, Kern County Sheriff’s Deputy\nHakker observed a gold-colored Dodge, driven by defendant, traveling with the\npassenger door fully open.2 A woman in the passenger seat was screaming to be let out.\n\n\n\n1      All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n\n\n                                             2.\n\f       Hakker immediately initiated a pursuit of the vehicle.3 During the pursuit,\ndefendant drove through a number of posted stop signs and red lights, and reached speeds\nin excess of 65 miles per hour. At one point, with the vehicle smoking profusely,\ndefendant drove onto a dirt easement adjoining railroad tracks and used the railroad\nbridge to cross a canal. Upon his return to surface streets, he traveled erratically at\nspeeds ranging from 40 to 70 miles per hour and continued to run through red lights and\nposted stop signs at intersections. Eventually, he ended up traveling against traffic at 55\nmiles per hour, forcing other vehicles on the road to take evasive action to avoid\ncollision.\n       The Dodge pulled off the road and continued through a vacant field, where it\ncollided with a power pole guide wire. Defendant fled on foot. When apprehended, he\ncontinued to resist even after pepper spray and a baton were used in an attempt to subdue\nhim. It took several officers to finally get him handcuffed and into custody. Defendant,\nwhose speech was slurred and who had a “ ‘wild look’ ” on his face and smelled strongly\nof alcohol, gave several false names when asked to identify himself and refused to submit\nto a chemical test to determine if he was under the influence.\n       Defendant was charged with numerous offenses arising out of the incident. At\ntrial, he testified he had consumed 24 cans of beer and two pints of whiskey over the 12-\nhour period prior to the car chase. He failed to comply with the patrol car’s signal lights\nbecause he usually was beaten and hassled by the police. He denied going through stop\nsigns and red lights, and insisted he carefully looked before crossing intersections. He\nadmitted that at some point, one of the Dodge’s tires suffered a blow out and shredded to\n\n\n2      The facts of defendant’s commitment offense are derived from our nonpublished\nopinion in People v. Buford (Jan. 15, 1997, F025449), of which we have taken judicial\nnotice by separate order.\n3      As Hakker turned the corner, he saw the woman standing on the sidewalk, looking\nfrightened but unharmed.\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fthe rim, but he continued to drive on the rim because he was looking for a public area\nwhere he would feel safe to pull over.\n       On December 28, 1995, defendant was convicted of felony evasion of a police\nvehicle while driving with willful and wanton disregard for safety (Veh. Code, § 2800.2),\nas well as the following misdemeanors: resisting a police officer (§ 148), driving under\nthe influence (Veh. Code, § 23152, subd. (a); DUI), giving false identification to a police\nofficer (§ 148.9, subd. (a)), and driving without a license (Veh. Code, § 12500, subd. (a)).\nThe jury further found he had suffered four prior strike convictions and had served five\nprior prison terms (§ 667.5, subd. (b)). On January 26, 1996, he was sentenced to 25\nyears to life in prison on the felony offense, with five consecutive one-year terms for the\nsection 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancements and concurrent jail terms for the\nmisdemeanor convictions.\n       On December 7, 2012, defendant filed a petition under section 1170.126 asserting\nhe was statutorily eligible for resentencing under the Act. The probation officer\nrecommended defendant be resentenced to the upper term of six years on his current\nfelony, plus five years for the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancements, for a total\nfixed term of 11 years; and that defendant’s sentence be deemed served and he be\nreleased on parole. The People opposed the petition, arguing that releasing defendant\nwould result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. They pointed to\ndefendant’s lengthy criminal record, which included 17 convictions (including three\nrobbery strike priors and a residential burglary strike prior) since 1975, as well as the\ncontinuance of his criminal behavior while in prison, his failure to address his substance\nabuse problem, and his lack of parole plans.4\n\n4       Although the People appear to have mistaken defendant’s first strike adjudication\nfor his second strike conviction, they presented documentation showing one of\ndefendant’s strikes arose out of two incidents in November 1975, in which defendant,\nwho had a gun in his waistband, grabbed the purses of two women in two different\nLaundromats. Another arose from defendant burglarizing a residence in October 1978.\n\n                                              4.\n\f       The petition was heard on June 9, 2014.5 Defendant, who testified at the hearing,\nwas about to turn 57 years old and had spent 18 years in prison on his current\ncommitment.\n       Defendant testified that he started drinking when he was around 15 or 16 years\nold, and drank heavily “[p]retty much from the beginning.” His family was somewhat\ndysfunctional; his father was frequently drunk, verbally abusive toward defendant and his\n\nStill another resulted from an incident in March 1991, in which defendant put the barrel\nof a gun under the victim’s chin, took the victim’s car keys, struck the victim in the head\nwith the gun, and then told the victim to run. As the victim fled, he heard a couple of\nshots pass over his head.\n       The People also presented multiple prison rules violations reports. On July 22,\n2003, there was a riot between White inmates and the Mexican nationals. Defendant\nreceived a shoulder injury. He was found guilty of participation in a riot with use of\nforce. On September 30, 2005, defendant punched another inmate in the face. Defendant\nsaid he did so because he had been disrespected. Defendant pled guilty to battery on an\ninmate without serious injury. On June 25, 2006, five gallons of inmate-manufactured\nalcohol were found in defendant’s cell. Defendant was found guilty of possession of\ninmate-manufactured alcohol. On July 28, 2007, defendant told an officer that he was in\ndebt to certain inmates for his use of tobacco and heroin. Defendant refused to provide a\nurine sample and was found guilty of using a controlled substance and of refusing a urine\ntest. On April 29, 2010, officers had to use pepper spray to stop defendant and another\ninmate from fighting. Defendant pled guilty to fighting requiring the use of force. On\nDecember 27, 2010, a syringe/inmate-manufactured “hype kit” was found in a box of\ndefendant’s letters. Defendant was found guilty of possession of drug paraphernalia. On\nMarch 16, 2011, officers had to use pepper spray to stop defendant and another inmate\nfrom fighting. Defendant pled guilty to fighting resulting in the use of force. On\nMarch 23, 2011, defendant refused to rehouse with another inmate. He pled guilty to\nrefusing a bed move. On July 5, 2011, defendant refused to move and house with another\ninmate, and was found guilty of willfully delaying a peace officer in the performance of\nduty.\n       The People also presented documentation concerning other disciplinary violations\nincurred by defendant, his classification level, his time spent in administrative\nsegregation for presenting a danger to himself or others and/or endangering institutional\nsecurity, and his request to be placed in administrative segregation because he owed\ninmate groups for heroin, methamphetamine, and tobacco.\n5      Because the judge who imposed defendant’s third strike term was no longer on the\nbench, the matter was heard by a different judge. (See § 1170.126, subd. (j).)\n\n\n                                             5.\n\fbrothers, and physically abusive toward their mother. Defendant dropped out of high\nschool when he was 16, then worked in the oil fields and then for his father’s tree service.\nHe associated with the wrong crowd, drank “[e]very chance [he] got,” and also used\nmarijuana and speed.\n       Defendant got in trouble for robbery in 1976, when he was 17. He explained that\nhe and a few other males were partying — driving around drinking and smoking\nmarijuana — with an older woman. When they needed more money with which to party,\ndefendant and another male went into a Laundromat at the behest of the woman and took\nsome purses that were on the counter. There were two people present. A gun was in\ndefendant’s pants when he and his cohort entered. Defendant “guess[ed]” he brought the\ngun for “security reasons.” He intended to make the other people afraid of him, but now\nthought of himself as a coward. As a result of the offense, defendant was committed to\nthe California Youth Authority for a year. He was sent to a fire camp, and completed his\nterm without problems. He was out about 30 days when he got in trouble for drunk\ndriving.\n       In 1978 or 1979 came defendant’s residential burglary conviction. Defendant\nexplained that he and two other men went to the home of one’s ex-girlfriend. When she\nwas not there, the men went in and started partying — drinking and smoking marijuana\n— in the house. They ultimately took some things. As a result, defendant was sentenced\nto adult prison for the first time. He was paroled from prison in 1980, but got in trouble\nin 1981 for another drunk driving violation. He knew it was dangerous to human life, but\nat the time, he did not look at the consequences of anything he did. A lot of the times\nwhen he and his companions went out drinking, they would go out in the country and just\ndrive around.\n       Defendant again went to prison in 1982. Although his record showed a robbery\nconviction and a conviction for some sort of forgery or passing a bad check, defendant\ndid not remember any robbery at that time, but he did go into a market and try to pass a\n\n                                             6.\n\fbad check. He was sentenced to prison for three years, but released on parole in 1984. A\nfew months later, he was accused of grand theft of a firearm. Guns were found under a\nhouse or in the back yard, and defendant was in the area at the time. His aunt had given\nhim the guns, but she said someone broke into her house and took them. Defendant was\nsentenced to five years in prison. Although he was released on parole in 1987, he was\nreturned to prison for parole violations in 1988, 1989, and 1990. He believed the\nviolations consisted of not meeting with his parole officer and testing.\n       In 1989, defendant was arrested and convicted of resisting arrest. He explained he\nwrecked his brother’s car, suffered head trauma, and tried to run away from the officer at\nthe hospital.\n       In 1990, defendant was convicted of being under the influence of drugs and\npossessing drug paraphernalia. He was using methamphetamine at that time, simply\nbecause it was available. He was working for his father’s tree service. Sometimes the\njob kept him busy, but not always. He denied using drugs when he was bored; rather, he\nexplained, sometimes they were available and sometimes not. He used them when he\ncould get them from his uncle. Defendant related he had five other family members who\nhad been to prison, of whom two were still alive. Both of his brothers had been to prison\nfor drug offenses, but they had been clean for four or five years as of the time of the\nhearing.\n       Defendant was released from prison in January 1991. A couple months later, he\npicked up another robbery conviction.6 He and some others were at a hot springs where\npeople went skinny dipping. They were drinking and swimming and “messing around”\n\n\n6       Defendant conceded that between 1975 and 1991, there were “probably” some\ncrimes he committed for which he was not convicted. Certain people on his father’s side\nof the family sold drugs and gave loans, and defendant repossessed cars and picked up\nproperty for money owed. He committed these kinds of theft crimes so he could party\nmore.\n\n\n                                             7.\n\fwhen they saw somebody watching. One of the females in defendant’s group had a small\ntwo-shot Derringer pistol in her bag, and they pointed the gun at the man and told him\nwhat he did was not okay. They took his car keys and threw them, and the man’s Maglite\nflashlight ended up in the back of their truck. Although defendant admitted, at the\nhearing on his petition, having the gun in his hand, he denied pointing it at the victim or\nputting it under the man’s chin. Defendant believed the gun was loaded at the time. He\ndenied hitting the victim in the head with it, although he admitted firing a few shots over\nthe man’s head. He did that to get the man to run. Defendant wanted to make a point\nabout the man peeping at the girls when they were in the hot tubs.\n       Defendant was sentenced to prison for eight years, but paroled in 1995. That year,\nhe was convicted in his current case. He explained that he was out one night, drinking a\nbit. When the female in his car started screaming and kicking him, he stopped the car\nand told her to get out. He drove away, however, when the officer tried to stop him. He\ndid not really accelerate away, although he admitted running numerous stop signs and\ngoing through a yellow light. He was traveling 55 to 65 miles per hour. The car jumped\nthe curb when a tire blew out, causing him to drive into opposite lanes of traffic.\nDefendant fled when the officer tried to stop him, because he did not want to go to jail.\nPeople were getting three strikes for minor offenses. Defendant did not know if he would\nget a third strike sentence for driving under the influence. He had had a couple of six\npacks and a small bottle of wine. He was driving because his girlfriend’s mother had\nbeen yelling, and he left the house to get some air. He admitted he would have been\nsmarter simply to walk down the street. He also admitted refusing to take a blood or\nbreath test.\n       When defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate life term in 1995 for the\nevasion case, he was disillusioned, afraid, and angry at himself. He used alcohol and\ncontrolled substances at times in prison. One of the events that triggered his use was the\ndeath of his brother, who died several years after defendant began serving his sentence.\n\n                                             8.\n\fHe stopped because “[t]here was no use in it.” As of the date he testified, defendant had\nbeen clean for 44 months. He had been attending informal meetings on the yard through\na church, as there was a long waiting list to get into the formal NA and AA programs. He\nhad been attending the informal meetings for about a year “[t]his time.”7 Because he was\nattending voluntarily, it gave him a sense of accomplishment that he was doing\nsomething for himself. There was also a sense of camaraderie with other people who\nwere basically like him.\n       The last time defendant used alcohol or a controlled substance in prison was just\nbefore he went “to the hole” in 2010. He wanted to go to the hole to get off the yard, and\nused drugs as a means to get there without having to use violence. Defendant explained\nthat “[o]n regular mainline” in prison, people were judged by their race all the time. He\nwas not on the mainline as, in 2010, he went to the special needs yard (SNY) for refusing\nto submit to “gang rule.” A younger generation of gang members had come into power\nand started running the yards. They decreed that someone could not be “a loner”\nanymore, but rather had to be in the gang or out of the gang. Defendant chose to be out.\nThis made him a target. Young men wanting to get into the gang had come over and\nfought him, which resulted in him receiving several disciplinary violations even though\nhe was defending himself.\n       Defendant was written up on March 16, 2011, “for fighting requiring use of\nforce.” That incident occurred when he was in administrative segregation. Defendant\nrefused a cellmate, because guards were trying to put gang members “in the cages” so the\nguards could watch fights for their amusement.\n       Defendant was written up in 2005 for battery on an inmate, allegedly because the\ninmate disrespected him. Defendant explained the inmate touched him inappropriately\n\n7      The People presented documentation that defendant was an active member of the\nNarcotics Anonymous program for the quarter ending December 19, 1999, while housed\nat Folsom State Prison.\n\n\n                                            9.\n\fwhile they were in the shower, naked. Defendant told him not to be doing that, but when\nthey left the shower area, the inmate said something and did it again, and defendant hit\nhim.\n       Defendant was written up in 2003 for participation in a riot. He explained that the\nriot was between the Skinheads and the Mexican nationals, who were backed by the\nsouthern Hispanics. Defendant was sitting at a table on the yard, playing cards, when\nthere was a ruckus. He stood up to see what was going on. The next thing he knew, he\nwas stabbed in the shoulder. There ended up being 200 inmates fist-fighting, but being\nstabbed was defendant’s only part in the events. After the guards gained control and got\neverybody down, they checked everyone. Because defendant had a shoulder injury, he\nwas deemed to have been involved.8\n       Defendant had held various jobs while in prison. He liked working, as it passed\nthe time. It was like fire camp, where the less time he had on his hands, the less he was\ngoing to get in trouble. If he was released from prison, he would have time and freedom\non his hands. He had learned, however, that actions have consequences, and that a\nperson was responsible for his or her actions. The last thing he wanted to do was to go\nback to prison. Right Way Pumping had offered him a job as a driver and “pumping\nhand” if he was released, although to be a driver, he would need a driver’s license.9 In\naddition, two programs were willing to accept him. One was a six-month, 12-step\nprogram at the Bible Tabernacle in Santa Clarita. After the six months, he would be\noffered the chance to work at a job-paying part of the program. The program would take\none third of his money, allow him to keep one third, and put one third in the bank. It\n\n8      The probation officer’s report written in conjunction with defendant’s current\ncommitment related defendant had numerous tattoos, including swastikas in two places,\n“ ‘White’ ” on his upper left arm, and “ ‘Pride’ ” on his upper right arm. The record\ncontains no information concerning when or under what circumstances defendant\nobtained the tattoos.\n9      Defendant’s driving privilege was apparently revoked.\n\n\n                                            10.\n\fcould last as long as he was willing to stay. The other was a four-step program at the\nMission that assisted with job applications, job placement, sponsor help, and the like.\nThe residential program was for homeless only and was full, but the four-step program\nwould require defendant to check in and test four times a week. If released, defendant’s\npreference would be to go to the Bible Tabernacle program because of the length of the\nprogram, and the fact those involved worked specifically with people coming out of\nprison.\n          Defendant was willing to submit voluntarily to postrelease community\nsupervision. He felt it would give him a sense of structure and someone responsible to\ntalk to. As for living arrangements, defendant believed he had enough money to get a\nsmall apartment. In addition, a niece who lived in Oildale had said he could stay with\nher. Defendant would have no problem being subject to a search condition, submitting to\ndrug and alcohol tests, or being ordered to go to treatment and to NA and AA meetings.\nHe did not think it would be too much of a problem to stay away from alcohol; he got\nmigraines that he attributed to drinking alcohol and “pruno,” and did not feel he needed\nalcohol anymore. When he was younger, he was trying to forget things. Now he\n“need[ed] to live things.” Defendant professed not to be the same man as when he was “a\nreckless user” and when he went to prison.\n          Defendant admitted his current commitment was his fifth prison commitment. At\nthe time of his sentencing, he told the probation officer that, as far as drug use was\nconcerned, he tried a little bit of everything and considered himself to be a drug addict.\nHe also told the probation officer that he drank three to four quarts of beer and a bottle of\nwine or whiskey daily, if it was available. At the time, defendant did not realize he had a\nproblem with alcohol, which he made and continued to drink in prison.10 He realized he\nhad a serious problem with alcohol about three years before the hearing. He had no\n\n10        Defendant testified he only had alcohol three times in prison.\n\n\n                                               11.\n\fexplanation for why it took so long, even though he could now see that alcohol was\nprobably one of the driving factors behind his crimes.\n         Defendant acknowledged some inmates were in prison as long as him without\nincurring any disciplinary write-ups. Asked the difference between them and him, he\nresponded, “They didn’t get caught.” He also acknowledged he had spent most of his\nsentence in Level 3 closed custody due to the length of his sentence. A year and a half\nbefore the hearing, he was permitted to go to the dormitories. He had been involved in an\nAA and narcotics program when he was in “Old Folsom,” and participated for six or\nseven months. Then the riot happened and he was transferred to different prisons four or\nfive times. Each had a two-year waiting list for their programs. About a year before the\nhearing, the parole board changed things so that it was no longer mandatory to take NA\nor AA to get parole, but inmates could instead participate in voluntary programs on the\nyards.\n         While he was in prison on his current commitment, defendant took a vocational\njanitorial class. At the time of the hearing, he was taking a GED course. He did not take\nit years ago because it was not a requirement and getting in was difficult. Now, inmates\nbelow a certain grade level had to take a GED test or go back to school. Defendant was\nnot yet close to getting his GED, as he was not good in math. Being in Level 3 closed\ncustody meant a lot of classes and jobs were not available to him.\n         At the conclusion of the hearing, the court took the matter under submission and\nallowed defendant to submit a further response to the People’s opposition, along with\ndocumentation.11 In his response, defendant argued there was no evidence he posed a\n\n\n\n11     In part, defendant submitted postconviction progress reports, laudatory reports\nconcerning his work assignments and vocational education, and education progress\nreports and certificates of completion for numerous vocational education units, including\nthe Vocational Janitorial Services One Program. Defendant also presented a certificate of\ncompletion of the “ ‘40 Days of Purpose’ ” program, a certificate of appreciation for\n\n                                             12.\n\fcurrent unreasonable risk to public safety. He noted his strike offenses were remote in\ntime, contended his disciplinary record was for offenses not considered serious under the\ngoverning regulations, and observed he had not had a violent incident in more than three\nyears and had not had an incident involving drugs or alcohol in three and a half years.\nDefendant also chronicled his work, vocational, and educational activities, along with his\nself-help endeavors, other evidence of rehabilitation, and re-entry plans.\n       On August 8, 2014, the court issued a written ruling denying the petition. In\npertinent part, the court stated:\n\n       “[Defendant] is entitled to resentencing unless the People prove by a\n       preponderance of the evidence that [defendant] ‘would pose an\n       unreasonable risk of danger to the public safety.’ The court has considered\n       the petition, opposition and reply, along with the attachments and exhibits,\n       filed with the court in addition to the testimony presented.\n\n       “The court finds that the People have met their burden that [defendant]\n       would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public safety. The court\n       has considered all aspects of the information and evidence presented. The\n       court notes [defendant]’s committing offense was for evading a police\n       officer and for DUI. DUI is one of the most dangerous crimes the court\n       sees on a regular basis. Despite having two priors for DUI, albeit . . . they\n       are very old, and being sentenced to 25 years to life for an act during which\n       he was DUI, [defendant] continued to use alcohol in custody. This court\n       has a grave concern that if released [defendant] will consume alcohol and\n       drive again, thereby putting the public safety at significant, unreasonable\n       risk.”\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                               I\n                              The Applicable Legal Principles\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of section\n\n\nparticipating in a Victim’s Awareness Workshop, and letters from RiteWay Pumping, the\nBible Tabernacle, and the Mission at Kern County.\n\n\n                                             13.\n\f1170.126.12 (People v.

If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd.

In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate]’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate]’s disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Id., subd.

The burden of proof of preponderance of the evidence applies to proof of\n              the facts, not to the trial court’s ultimate determination.\n       Defendant asserts he cannot be denied resentencing unless the People proved\ndangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. Alternatively, he says, the People must at\nleast have proven the ultimate conclusion of dangerousness by a preponderance of the\nevidence. Although we agree preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate standard,\nwe disagree with defendant on its application to the ultimate determination.13\n\n              “The standard of proof, the United States Supreme Court has said,\n       ‘serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the\n       relative importance attached to the ultimate decision.’ [Citation.] At one\n       end of the spectrum is the ‘preponderance of the evidence’ standard, which\n       apportions the risk of error among litigants in roughly equal fashion.\n       [Citation.] At the other end of the spectrum is the ‘beyond a reasonable\n       doubt’ standard applied in criminal cases, in which ‘our society imposes\n       almost the entire risk of error upon itself.’ [Citation.] Between those two\n       standards is the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.\n       [Citation.] These three standards are codified in California’s Evidence\n\n13      The People do not dispute defendant’s claim the burden of proof lies with the\nprosecution.

Although voters\ncould have permitted automatic resentencing, under any and all circumstances, of those\neligible therefor, they did not do so. This demonstrates a recognition of two highly\nplausible scenarios: (1) Some inmates sentenced to indeterminate terms under the\noriginal version of the three strikes law for crimes not defined as serious or violent\nfelonies may have started out not posing any greater risk of danger than recidivists who\nwill now be sentenced to determinate terms as second strike offenders under the\nprospective provisions of the Act, but have become violent or otherwise dangerous while\nimprisoned, or (2) Enough time might have passed since some inmates committed their\ncriminal offenses so that those offenses no longer make such inmates dangerous, but\nother factors do.

(Kaulick,\nsupra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1305 & fn. 25; see Evid. Code, § 115.) That court\ndetermined this is so because “dangerousness is not a factor which enhances the sentence\nimposed when a defendant is resentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a\nhurdle which must be crossed in order for a defendant to be resentenced at all.” (Kaulick,\nsupra, at p. 1303.) Kaulick explained: “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and\nthose similarly situated to him, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life\nterm to which he was originally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him with an\nopportunity to be resentenced to a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is\nnonetheless still subject to the third strike sentence based on the facts established at the\ntime he was originally sentenced. As such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to\nmodify the sentence in his favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e.,\ndangerousness), and such factor need not be established by proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt to a jury.” (Ibid.)\n       In People v.

We also relied heavily on Kaulick.\n       In rejecting application of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, Kaulick\ndiscussed the United States Supreme Court’s conclusion in Dillon v. United States (2010)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148795\"><a href=\"/opinion/148795/dillon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828 (Dillon), that “a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to have essential\nfacts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt do not apply to limits on downward\nsentence modifications due to intervening laws.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1304.) Kaulick found Dillon’s language applicable. Since the retrospective part of the\nAct is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate and\nprovides for a proceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward, any\nfacts found at such a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth\nAmendment issues. Thus, there is no constitutional requirement that the facts be\nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, at pp. 1304-1305.)14\n       Although in Blakely we applied Kaulick’s analysis to the initial determination of\neligibility for resentencing under the Act (Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061), it\napplies equally to the issue whether resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. A denial of an inmate’s petition does not\nincrease the penalty to which the inmate is already subject, but instead removes the\ninmate from the scope of an act of lenity on the part of the electorate to which he or she is\nnot constitutionally entitled. (Id. at p. 1062.) That the denial is based on a determination\nof dangerousness does not change that conclusion.\n\n14     Neither Descamps v.

Unlike Dillon, Descamps dealt with judicial factfinding concerning a prior\nconviction used to enhance a sentence (Descamps, supra, 570 U.S. at pp. ___-___ [133\nS.Ct. at pp. 2281-2282]), while Pepper involved a plenary resentencing after the\ndefendant’s sentence had been set aside on appeal (Pepper, supra, 562 U.S. at p. 481).\n\n\n                                             18.\n\f       Kaulick found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness”\nby a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\nand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court can base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself.15 Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation.\n       Accordingly, we hold preponderance of the evidence is the applicable standard of\nproof, regardless whether we analyze the issue as one of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence\nor due process. (See People v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1076.)16\n       This does not, however, mean the trial court must apply that standard in making its\nultimate determination whether to resentence a petitioner, or we must review that\ndetermination for substantial evidence. Nor does it mean evidence of dangerousness\nmust preponderate over evidence of rehabilitation for resentencing to be denied.\n\n\n\n15      As noted, ante, we have previously discussed Kaulick in the context of the initial\ndetermination whether an inmate is eligible for resentencing under the Act. (Blakely,\nsupra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1058, 1060-1061; People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1033, 1039-1040.) Nothing we say here should be taken as disagreement with or\nmodification of those opinions. We deal here with a different aspect of the retrospective\nportion of the Act and a subject not before us in our prior cases.\n16     We recognize that in the case of people who are involuntarily committed as\nnarcotics addicts or for analogous reasons, the California Supreme Court has found the\nappropriate standard of proof to be beyond a reasonable doubt. (See, e.g., People v.\nThomas (1977) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1186097\"><a href=\"/opinion/1186097/people-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637-638.)

The statute\ndoes not say the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the People prove resentencing\nwould pose such a risk.\n       Considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126, we\nconclude the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,\nfacts from which a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety can reasonably be made. The reasons a trial court finds\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence\nshowing dangerousness versus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court’s\ndiscretion. The ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger is a discretionary one. While the determination must be supported by facts\nestablished by a preponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of\ndanger by a preponderance of the evidence. (See In re Robert L., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1065-1067 [discussing abuse of discretion and preponderance of the evidence\nstandards].)\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme.17 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to\nCunningham, “three terms of imprisonment [were] specified by statute for most offenses.\nThe trial court’s discretion in selecting among [those] options [was] limited by section\n1170, subdivision (b), which direct[ed] that ‘the court shall order imposition of the\n\n\n17     The determination of the appropriate penalty in a capital case “ ‘is “essentially\nmoral and normative [citation], and therefore . . . there is no burden of proof or burden of\npersuasion.

(Ibid.; see former Cal.\nRules of Court, rule 4.420(b).) Even after the DSL was reformed and amended in\nresponse to Cunningham, so as to eliminate judicial factfinding in selection of the\nappropriate term when three possible prison terms are specified by statute, establishment\nof facts by a preponderance of the evidence remains necessary with respect to certain\ndiscretionary sentencing decisions.

Such an evaluation “is not equivalent to a\nfactual finding.” (People v. Black, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.) It follows, then,\nthat the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, in that it\nneed not find resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not, pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means “ ‘more likely than not’ ”].)19\n       To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is\nthe court’s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review. Rather, its\nfinding will be upheld if it does not constitute an abuse of discretion, i.e., if it falls within\n\n\n19      We reject defendant’s claim that if there need only be substantial evidence of the\nunderlying facts, then review of the ultimate dangerousness determination for abuse of\ndiscretion is no more stringent than the highly deferential “some evidence” standard\napplicable to review of executive branch decisions in parole cases.

Moreover, as we have observed,\nthe language of section 1170.126, subdivisions (f) and (g) expressly allocates to the trial\ncourt’s discretion the ultimate determination of dangerousness.

The court stated: “It\nis not unreasonable to read this text . . . to mean that a court ‘shall’ impose life without\nparole unless ‘at the discretion of the court’ a sentence of 25 years to life appears more\nappropriate. [Citation.] But it is equally reasonable to read the text to mean that a court\nmay select one of the two penalties in the exercise of its discretion, with no presumption\nin favor of one or the other. The latter reading accords with common usage. For\nexample, if a teacher informed her students that ‘you must take a final exam or, at your\ndiscretion, write a term paper,’ it would be reasonable for the students to believe they\nwere equally free to pursue either option. The text of section 190.5[, subdivision ](b)\ndoes not clearly indicate whether the statute was intended to make life without parole the\npresumptive sentence.” (People v.

Because a reading that affords no presumption “accords with common\nusage” (People v.

Osuna, supra, at p. 1037), “[i]t is clear the electorate’s intent was not to throw open the\nprison doors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or\nviolent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or posing little or\n\n21     Because a trial court can deny resentencing under section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f) only upon a finding of unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, a trial\ncourt would abuse its discretion, as in a Romero situation, by refusing to resentence a\npetitioner because of antipathy toward the Act or a personal belief a particular defendant\ndeserved an indeterminate term for reasons other than dangerousness. (See People v.\nWilliams, supra, 17 Cal.4th at pp. 159, 161.)\n\n\n                                             25.\n\fno risk to the public” (id. at p. 1038, second italics added). Had voters intended to permit\nretention of an indeterminate term only in extraordinary cases, they would have said so in\nsubdivision (f) of section 1170.126, rather than employing language that affords courts\nbroad discretion to find dangerousness. They also would not have afforded the trial court\nthe power to consider any evidence it determined to be relevant to the issue as they did in\nsubdivision (g)(3) of the statute.\n       D.     Section 1170.18, subdivision (c), enacted pursuant to Proposition 47, does\n              not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f).\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 reduced to\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\npetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its\ndiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (b).)22\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision\ndefendant contends applies to his petition for resentencing under Proposition 36.\n\n\n22    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n\n\n                                                26.\n\fSubdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used throughout this Code,\n‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the\npetitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of\nsubparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.” Section 667,\nsubdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called “super strike”\noffenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n              “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\n\n\n\n\n                                            27.\n\fdefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense.

Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1,\n5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n                                              30.\n\f               “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n       their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n       commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n       imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘. . . to deter repeat offenders and,\n       at some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’ ” (People v.

This is so\neven when the current, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely\n\n24      The foregoing applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added\nsection 1170.12 to the Penal Code. The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “ ‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.’ ” (Historical and\nStatutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann.

[Citations.]” (In re Coley, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-\n529.)\n        Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of Prop. 36, § 1, p. 105.)25\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto release existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious cases, as would be\nthe result if the definition of “ ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ ” contained\nin section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing proceedings under\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a result is amply\ndemonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory under the Act for\na wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a prior conviction for\na “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)), and that an inmate is\nrendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an array of reasons\nbeyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126, subd. (e)(2)).\n        The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, uncodified section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an\nexercise of the public power of the people of the State of California for the protection of\nthe health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be\nliberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.,\nsupra, text of Prop. 36, p. 110, some italics omitted.) As we explained in People v.\n\n\n25     The voter information guides for both the November 6, 2012, general election\n(which contains Prop. 36) and the November 4, 2014, general election (which contains\nProp. 47) can be accessed at <http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/\nvoter-information-guides/> [as of Oct. 27, 2016].\n\n\n                                             32.\n\fOsuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036, “Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three\nstrikes law somewhat [citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’\n[citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof Prop. 47, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act shall\nbe broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18 states:\n“This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter Information\nGuide, Gen. Elec., supra, text of Prop. 47, p. 74.) Proposition 47 requires misdemeanor\nsentences for various drug possession and property offenses, unless the perpetrator has a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender\nregistration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c). (Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350,\nsubd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5, subd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a,\nsubd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).) Section 1170.18 renders\nineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current offense would now be a\nmisdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for an\noffense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(§ 1170.18, subds.

For instance, the “Official Title and Summary”\nstated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47 would “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons\nserving felony sentences for these offenses [(i.e., offenses that require misdemeanor\nsentences under the measure),] unless court finds unreasonable public safety risk.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., supra, official title and summary of Prop. 47,\np. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do, the Legislative Analyst stated:\n“This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders convicted of nonserious and\nnonviolent property and drug crimes. The measure also allows certain offenders who\nhave been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for reduced sentences.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec., supra, analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35,\nitalics added.) With respect to the resentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst\nexplained: “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences for the\nabove crimes [(i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen property, writing bad checks,\ncheck forgery, and drug possession)] to apply to have their felony sentences reduced to\nmisdemeanor sentences. In addition, certain offenders who have already completed a\nsentence for a felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\nfelony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who has committed\na specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their conviction changed. In\naddition, the measure states that a court is not required to resentence an offender\ncurrently serving a felony sentence if the court finds it likely that the offender will\ncommit a specified severe crime. Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be\non state parole for one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\np. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The “Argument in Favor of\n\n                                             34.\n\fProposition 47” talked of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop wasting\nprison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in prisons\nfor nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation guide, Gen. Elec., supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38.) The\n“Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47” reiterated these themes, and never\nsuggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act. (See\nVoter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., supra, rebuttal to argument against Prop. 47, p. 39.)\nAlthough the “Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47” asserted 10,000 inmates\nwould be eligible for early release under the measure, and that many of them had prior\nconvictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and home burglary” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec., supra, rebuttal to argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), it\ncontained no suggestion the early release provisions would extend to inmates whose\ncurrent offenses remained felonies under the Act. The same is true of the discussion of\nresentencing contained in the “Argument Against Proposition 47.” (Voter Information\nGuide, Gen. Elec., supra, argument against Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “ ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ ” contained in section\n1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode . . . .” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are mindful “it has long been settled that ‘[t]he enacting body is deemed to be\naware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is\nenacted’ [citation], ‘and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof’ [citation].\n‘This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative.

The only resentencing mentioned in the Proposition 47\nballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose current offenses would be reduced to\nmisdemeanors, not those who would still warrant second strike felony terms. There is a\nhuge difference, both legally and in public safety risked, between someone with multiple\nprior serious and/or violent felony convictions whose current offense is (or would be, if\ncommitted today) a misdemeanor, and someone whose current offense is a felony.\nAccordingly, treating the two groups differently for resentencing purposes does not lead\nto absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n       We recognize it is an established rule of statutory construction “that when statutes\nare in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like meanings.\n[Citations.]” (People v.

Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of nearly universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned — and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\nwisdom of the legislative choice” (Bernard v.

(See People v. Brown, supra, 54 Cal.4th at\npp. 324-325.)\n        We believe, however, that a finding of nonretroactivity inexorably leads to the\npossibility of prospective-only application, and prospective-only application of\nProposition 47’s definition to resentencing petitions under the Act would raise serious,\nperhaps insurmountable, equal protection issues. (Indeed, the parties here engage in a\nspirited argument concerning equal protection.) “Mindful of the serious constitutional\nquestions that might arise were we to accept a literal construction of the statutory\n\n                                             38.\n\f       E.     The focus in a section 1170.126, subdivision (f) analysis is on whether the\n              petitioner currently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n       Defendant contends there must be a “logical nexus” between the factors\nconsidered in the trial court’s decision and current dangerousness. In support, he relies,\nin part, on parole cases.\n       In discussing the “some evidence” standard applicable in parole cases, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court has stated: “This standard is unquestionably deferential, but\ncertainly is not toothless, and ‘due consideration’ of the specified factors requires more\nthan rote recitation of the relevant factors with no reasoning establishing a rational nexus\nbetween those factors and the necessary basis for the ultimate decision — the\ndetermination of current dangerousness.” (In re Lawrence, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1210.)\n       Although we decline to decide how and to what extent parole cases inform the\ndecision whether to resentence a petitioner under the Act or our review of such a\ndecision, we agree with defendant that the proper focus is on whether the petitioner\ncurrently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.

We also\nagree a trial court may properly deny resentencing under the Act based solely on\nimmutable facts such as a petitioner’s criminal history “only if those facts support the\nultimate conclusion that an inmate continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public\nsafety. [Citation.]” (In re Lawrence, supra, at p. 1221.) “ ‘[T]he relevant inquiry is\nwhether [a petitioner’s prior criminal and/or disciplinary history], when considered in\nlight of other facts in the record, are such that they continue to be predictive of current\ndangerousness many years [later].

As the trial court noted in its written denial of the petition for resentencing,\ndespite having two prior convictions for driving under the influence and being sentenced\nto prison for 25 years to life for an offense during which he was driving under the\ninfluence, defendant continued his substance abuse in prison. The trial court was not\nrequired to ignore this past behavior. Although defendant clearly and commendably took\nsteps to change his life and, insofar as the evidence showed, had been sober for some\ntime, the evidence also showed him to have relapsed in the past. In addition, although\ndefendant professed to have realized that actions have consequences and to take\nresponsibility for his actions, probation officers’ reports (which the court considered\nwithout objection) showed defendant made similar pronouncements in the past and yet\ncontinued to offend. His explanations for his past misconduct, both in and out of prison,\nsuggested he tended to minimize that responsibility when confronted with those actions.\nTaking all the circumstances into account, the concerns expressed by the trial court in its\nruling were neither unfounded nor unreasonable.\n       On appeal, defendant presents numerous arguments why his petition should have\nbeen granted. As was the case with his testimony at the hearing, they tend to downplay\nthe seriousness and potential consequences of his behavior.

I do so not because there is any\nambiguity in the language used in section 1170.18(c) or the notion that the statute does\nnot mean what it says, i.e., that the new definition applies “throughout this Code.”\nRather, in my view, there is no indication the electorate, in enacting section 1170.18(c),\nintended it to apply retroactively to resentencing determinations under Proposition 36, the\nThree Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (the Act).2\nI.     After November 4, 2014, the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” in\n       Section 1170.18(c) applies throughout the Penal Code\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, long past the time of defendant’s resentencing hearing.\nUnless the legislation was designed or intended to apply retroactively, the definition in\nsection 1170.18(c) cannot apply to defendant.

Leal (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2548607\"><a href=\"/opinion/2548607/people-v-leal/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1007-1008,\napplied the plain meaning rule as follows:\n\n              “The statutory language of the provision defining ‘duress’ in each of\n      the rape statutes is clear and unambiguous. The definition of ‘duress’ in\n      both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n      this section, “duress” means ….’ (§§ 261, subd. (b), 262, subd. (c).) This\n      clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the definitions of\n      ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other sexual offenses.\n\n             “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n      into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n      sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n      its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n      incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n      well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n      observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n      the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n      “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n      rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n      immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n      meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n      lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n              “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n      providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n      has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n      “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n      construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n      meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n      is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n      compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n      analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n      “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n      ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n      to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n      [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n\n\n                                             3.\n\f       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       The majority pays lip service to the plain meaning rule and then ignores it. While\nacknowledging the language used is unambiguous, it nonetheless engages in statutory\nconstruction to determine whether the electorate really intended to say what it actually\nenacted. The end result is a rewriting of the statute so that it comports with the majority’s\nview of what the voters really intended. The majority has rewritten section 1170.18(c) so\nthat it now states: “As used in this section only, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’ means ….” (Italics added.) The majority does so without providing a compelling\nreason to do so and without showing the plain language used has a “‘meaning [that] is\n“‘repugnant to the general purview of the act.’”’” (People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p.\n1008.) Because the Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or\ncontradictory to the Act, nor does the majority claim the definition is repugnant to the\ngeneral purview of Proposition 47. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the\nmajority on this part of the opinion.\n       I note the Sixth District Court of Appeal in People v. Esparza (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 734-737, has reached the same result as the majority here under nearly\nidentical reasoning. There the court seemingly acknowledges that applying the plain\nmeaning rule would not lead to absurd results. However, like the majority here, the court\nrefused to give the words used their unambiguous, ordinary meaning, stating “we would\nneed the most compelling proof that the voters intended what we see as an unreasonable\nand counterintuitive result.” (Id. at p. 737.)\n       Subsequently, the Sixth Appellate District, in an opinion authored by one of the\njustices who concurred in the Esparza decision, reversed position after further reflection\nand further research on the public debate surrounding the passage of Proposition 47.\n(People v. Cordova (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 552, fn. 8, review granted Aug. 31,\n\n                                                 4.\n\f2016, S236179.) The majority in Cordova extensively outlined in the opinion how the\nquestion of whether Proposition 47 could affect petitions under the Act was widely\ndebated in the state by opponents of the measure. (Cordova, supra, at pp. 560-564.)\n       The majority here dismisses these sources of information stating, “We are aware\nof no California Supreme Court authority identifying Internet and media sources as\nreliable bases for ascertaining voters’ intent.” (Maj. opn., ante, at fn. 26, ¶ 2, p. 37.)\nHowever, the Cordova case cites two such cases—Brosnahan v. Brown (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">236</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> and Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Equalization (1978)\n22 Cal.3d 208—that considered other informative sources on voter intent. Conversely,\nthe majority has cited to no case or authority that confines or otherwise limits the search\nfor voters’ intent to ballot summaries and arguments. I quote from the Brosnahan case:\n\n              “Finally, petitioners insist that the complexity of Proposition 8 may\n       have led to confusion or deception among voters, who were assertedly\n       uninformed regarding the contents of the measure. Yet, as was the case in\n       both Amador and FPPC,[3] Proposition 8 received widespread publicity.\n       Newspaper, radio and television editorials focused on its provisions, and\n       extensive public debate involving candidates, letters to the editor, etc.,\n       described the pros and cons of the measure.… [¶] … [¶]\n\n               “Petitioners’ entire argument that, in approving Proposition 8, the\n       voters must have been misled or confused is based upon the improbable\n       assumption that the people did not know what they were doing.… Rather,\n       in accordance with our tradition, ‘we ordinarily should assume that the\n       voters who approved a constitutional amendment “… have voted\n       intelligently upon an amendment to their organic law, the whole text of\n       which was supplied each of them prior to the election and which they must\n       be assumed to have duly considered.”’ [Citations.]” (Brosnahan v. Brown,\n       supra, 32 Cal.3d at pp. 251-252.)\n\n\n\n3“FPPC”   refers to Fair Political Practices Com. v.

(People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at pp. 1007-1008.)\nII.    Section 1170.18(c) has no application to defendant’s resentencing under the\n       Act\n       I do concur in the result because there is nothing in Proposition 47 to indicate the\ndefinition enacted under section 1170.18(c) is to be applied retroactively to defendant\nunder the Act.\n       I begin my analysis with section 3 of the Penal Code, which provides that “[n]o\npart of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent.\nWhen the Legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear,” section 3 provides the\ndefault rule. (People v. Brown (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319.) Proposition 47 is silent on\nthe question of whether it applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act. The\nanalysis of Proposition 47 by the legislative analyst and the arguments for and against\nProposition 47 are also silent on this question. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014) pp. 34-39.) Because the statute contains no express declaration that\nsection 1170.18(c) applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act, and there is no\nclearly implied intent of retroactivity in the legislative history, the default rule applies.\nDefendant cites In re Estrada (1965) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421177\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421177/in-re-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> to argue retroactive application.\n       In Estrada, the court stated:\n\n       “When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it\n       has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe\n       and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission\n       of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must\n       have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now\n\n                                                6.\n\f       deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\n       constitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter\n       punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its\n       passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not\n       final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to\n       conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a\n       conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.” (In re\n       Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       Defendant argues that under the Estrada case, unless there is a “savings clause”\nproviding for prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to\napply to all cases not yet reduced to a final judgment on the statute’s effective date. (In\nre Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at pp. 744-745, 747-748.) However, the Estrada case has\nbeen revisited by our Supreme Court on several occasions. In People v. Brown, supra, 54\nCal.4th at page 324, the court stated: “Estrada is today properly understood, not as\nweakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in [Penal\nCode] section 3, but rather as informing the rule’s application in a specific context by\narticulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment\nfor a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments.” “The\nholding in Estrada was founded on the premise that ‘“[a] legislative mitigation of the\npenalty for a particular crime represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or\nthe different treatment is sufficient to meet the legitimate ends of the criminal law.”’”\n(Id. at p. 325.) In Brown, the court did not apply the Estrada rule because “a statute\nincreasing the rate at which prisoners may earn credits for good behavior does not\nrepresent a judgment about the needs of the criminal law with respect to a particular\ncriminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference of retroactive intent.”\n(People v. Brown, supra, at p. 325.)\n       Similarly here, Estrada does not control because applying the definition of\n“unreasonable risk to public safety” in Proposition 47 to petitions for resentencing under\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\fthe Act does not reduce punishment for a particular crime.4 Instead, the downward\nmodification of a sentence authorized by the Act is dependent not just on the current\noffense but on any number of unlimited factors related to the individual offender,\nincluding criminal conviction history, disciplinary and rehabilitation records, and “[a]ny\nother evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n       For this reason also, defendant’s argument his equal protection rights would be\nviolated if he is denied retroactive application is unavailing. In light of the unlimited\nfactors related to individual offenders that inform the exercise of discretion, no two\nindividual offenders may be said to be similarly situated for purposes of resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant fails to establish he has been denied equal protection as against\nany other similarly situated individual.\n       Because section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” does not apply retroactively to the Act, the sentencing court applied the correct\nstandard in exercising its discretion to not resentence defendant. Since defendant has\nfailed to show an abuse of that discretion, I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the\njudgment.\n\n                                                          ___________________________\n                                                                              PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n4The majority in People v. Cordova, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at page 568 acknowledged\nEstrada’s limited applicability, but found in favor of retroactivity for other reasons not\nurged here by defendant nor briefed by the People. As the retroactivity issue is currently\npending, I will wait for guidance from our Supreme Court on this issue.\n\n                                              8.\n\f</pre>",
