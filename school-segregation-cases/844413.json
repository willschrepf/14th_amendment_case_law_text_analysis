Appellants,\nan association of Gardens residents organized under the name\nMt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, and 23 current and\nformer residents of the neighborhood (collectively the\n“Residents”) filed suit against the Township alleging\nviolations of various anti-discrimination laws.\n\n       Before the Township filed an Answer or discovery on\nthese allegations had taken place, the District Court granted\nsummary judgment to the Township. Because the District\n\n\n\n\n                             4\n\fCourt misapplied the standard for deciding whether the\nResidents could establish a prima facie case under Title VIII\nand because it did not draw all reasonable inferences in the\nResidents’ favor, we will reverse.\n\n                             I. 1\n\n       The homes in this dispute are located in a 30-acre\nneighborhood called the Gardens in the Township of Mount\nHolly in Burlington County, New Jersey. The Gardens is the\nonly neighborhood in the Township comprised predominantly\nof African-American and Hispanic residents. It is poor—\nalmost all of its residents earn less than 80% of the area’s\nmedian income; with most earning much less.\n\n       The 329 2 homes in the Gardens are predominantly\ntwo-story buildings made out of solid brick. Built in the\n1950s, the homes are attached in rows of 8 to 10 and are set\nback from the curving streets to allow for front and back\nyards, with alleys running behind each housing block. Two\nmajor commercial districts abut opposite sides of the\nneighborhood, which is only a mile away from the major\n\n\n      1\n        Because this is an appeal from a motion granting\nsummary judgment, we examine the record evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving parties, here the\nResidents, while resolving all reasonable inferences in their\nfavor. Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007).\n      2\n        The record inconsistently describes the number of\nhomes as 327 or 329. (JA 61, 776, 1114).\n\n\n\n\n                             5\n\fdowntown business district. Until 2004, the neighborhood\nwas also home to a playground and a community center.\n\n        The 2000 census provides a snapshot of the\nneighborhood. 3       According to that data, the Gardens\nneighborhood was split evenly between rental properties\n(with a median rental price of $705 per month) and\nhomeowners (the median cost of homeownership was $969\nper month). Eighty-one percent of the homeowners had lived\nin their homes for at least 9 years; 72% of renters had lived\nthere for at least five years. Of the 1,031 4 residents living in\nthe neighborhood, 203, or 19.7%, were non-Hispanic Whites;\n475, or 46.1% were African-Americans; and 297, or 28.8%\nwere Hispanic, the highest concentration of minority residents\nwithin Mt. Holly. Almost all of these residents were\nclassified as “low income”; indeed, most were classified as\nhaving “very low” or “extremely low” incomes.\n\n\n       3\n        The parties dispute the utility of data from the 2000\ncensus. However, none of the parties has briefed or even\nasked the question of when precisely the violations at issue in\nthis case began. This issue is important because the\nredevelopment process began in 2002 and, as a result, the\ndemographics of the township have changed. Disputes over\nwhich census numbers to use thus create a moving target;\nhowever, the 2000 census data appears to provide the most\naccurate demographic data at the inception of the\nredevelopment process.\n       4\n          This is an approximate number provided by the\nResidents’ expert. Elsewhere in the record, the neighborhood\nis described as home to 1,605 people. (JA 1114).\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\f        The neighborhood was not perfect. For one, it was\ncrowded. This created a parking shortage, which led\nresidents to pave their backyards for use as driveways, which,\nin turn, led to drainage problems. In addition, the fact that the\nhomes were owned in fee simple meant there was no one with\na vested interest in maintaining common spaces, such as the\nalleys. Some of the owners were nothing more than absentee\nlandlords, renting to individuals with little interest in\nmaintaining the properties. Over the years, many of the\nproperties fell into disrepair. Vacant properties were boarded\nup, some yards filled with rubbish, and parts of the area\nbecame blighted. Because the houses were connected to one\nanother, the dilapidation of one house could and sometimes\ndid lead to the decay of the adjoining houses. Finally, the\ndense population, narrow streets, and vacant properties\nfacilitated crime. In 1999, 28% of crimes in the Township\noccurred in the Gardens, even though that neighborhood\ncovers only 1.5% of the Township’s land area.\n\n       These many problems were not ignored. Local\ncommunity activists and business leaders worked to revitalize\nthe Gardens through a private initiative that eventually came\nto be known as “Mt. Holly 2000.” This community endeavor\nsought to reverse the neighborhood’s decline by rehabilitating\nproperties and increasing social services. Despite sporadic\nachievements—ten homes were renovated and a community\npolicing center was established—the neighborhood’s\nproblems continued.\n\n       In the year 2000, the Township commissioned a study\nto determine whether the Gardens should be designated as an\n“area in need of redevelopment” under New Jersey’s\nredevelopment laws.       The resulting report, issued on\n\n\n\n\n                               7\n\fNovember 8, 2000 concluded that the area offered a\n“significant opportunity for redevelopment” because of\nblight, excess land coverage, poor land use, and excess crime.\n(JA 699). That same year, the Township began to acquire\nproperties in the Gardens. Those properties were left vacant.\n\n       A series of redevelopment plans followed. In 2003,\nthe Township issued the Gardens Area Redevelopment Plan\n(“GARP”). This plan called for the demolition of all of the\nhomes in the neighborhood and the permanent or temporary\nrelocation of all of its residents. In their place, the plan\nprovided for the construction of 180 new market-rate housing\nunits, thirty of which would be available only to senior\ncitizens. The plan was changed in 2005 to include a parcel of\nland immediately north of the Gardens. This plan, the West\nRancocas Redevelopment Plan, also called for the destruction\nof most of the original Gardens homes, to be replaced with\n228 new residential units composed of two-family dwellings\nand townhouses. Unlike the GARP, the West Rancocas plan\nprovided for the optional rehabilitation of some of the original\nGardens homes and allowed for the residents of those\nrehabilitated units to be temporarily relocated in phases so\nthat they could remain in the neighborhood. The West\nRancocas plan also contemplated that 10% of the 228 units\nwould be designated as affordable housing. Finally, in 2008,\nthe plan was changed again. This time, the Revised West\nRancocas Redevelopment Plan called for construction of up\nto 520 houses, 75% of which could be townhouses and 50%\nof which could be apartments. The revised plan called for\nonly 56 deed-restricted affordable housing units, 11 of which\nwould be offered on a priority basis to existing Gardens\nresidents. This revised plan did not include any rehabilitation\nof existing units.\n\n\n\n\n                               8\n\f       At each stage of the process, many Gardens residents\nobjected to the redevelopment, complaining about the\ndestruction of their neighborhood and expressing fear that\nthey would not be able to afford to live anywhere else in the\nTownship. One resident complained that the house next to\nhers was torn down and that a bulldozer had hit her home,\ntearing the wall, cracking the ceiling, and shifting her roof.\n(JA 577-78, 1001). Another resident, a 70-year-old disabled\nhomeowner, told the Township’s Planning Board that, were\nhe displaced, he would be unable to work and unable to\nafford a new home. (JA 1002). At one meeting in 2005, a\nplanning expert testified that the West Rancocas plan was\ndeficient because it only allowed rehabilitation as an option,\nwithout requiring or even encouraging it. He also said that\n90% of the Gardens’ existing residents would not be able to\nafford the newly-constructed homes and complained that the\nplan did not provide an estimate of affordable housing in the\nexisting market for displaced residents. (JA 990, 1117).\n\n       Despite these complaints, work on the development\ncontinued. In February 2006 Keating Urban Partners, LLC,\nwas chosen as the plan developer. Keating, in turn, hired\nTriad to develop a relocation plan. That plan, the Workable\nRelocation Assistance Plan (“WRAP”), was submitted to the\nNew Jersey Department of Community Affairs on September\n28, 2006 and provided that all residents living in the Gardens\non August 1, 2006 would receive relocation assistance.\nQualified homeowners would receive $15,000 and a $20,000\nno-interest loan to assist in the purchase of a replacement\nhome. The Township offered to buy homes for between\n\n\n\n\n                              9\n\f$32,000 and $49,000. 5 The estimated cost of a new home in\nthe development was between $200,000 and $275,000, well\noutside the range of affordability for a significant portion of\nthe African-American and Hispanic residents of the\nTownship.\n\n       Renters were authorized to receive up to $7,500 of\nrelocation assistance, but were not eligible for relocation\nfunds to return to the Gardens. In any case, the vast majority\nof those renters would be unable to afford the proposed\nmarket-rate rent of $1,230 per month. Eventually, the\nTownship paid to relocate 62 families, 42 of which moved\noutside of Mt. Holly Township. Renters who moved often\nhad to pay more in rent at their new homes.\n\n       Although the redevelopment plan called for building in\nphases, the Township began to acquire and demolish all of the\nhomes in the Gardens, thereby displacing many residents and\ncreating conditions that encouraged the remaining residents to\nleave. By August 2008, 75 homes had been destroyed and\n148 homes had been acquired and left vacant. Later that fall,\nthe Township demolished 60 more homes. And, in the\nsummer of 2009, 50 more homes were knocked down.\nResidents living amongst the destruction were forced to cope\nwith noise, vibration, dust, and debris.         Worse, the\ninterconnected nature of the houses triggered a cascading\narray of problems. Uninsulated interior walls were exposed\nto the outside and covered with unsightly stucco or tar. But\nthese coatings did not extend below grade, allowing moisture\nto seep into subterranean crawl spaces, creating an\n\n       5\n           One home sold for $64,000 and another sold for\n$81,000.\n\n\n\n\n                              10\n\fenvironment for mold problems. Above, the demolitions\nopened the roofs of adjoining homes. Those openings were\npatched with plywood, which was insufficient to stop water\nleaks. Around the neighborhood, homes bore the scars of\ndemolition: hanging wires and telephone boxes, ragged brick\ncorners, open masonry joints, rough surfaces, irregular\nplywood patches, and damaged porches, floors and railings.\nDestruction of the sidewalks outside demolished homes\nfurther contributed to the disarray by making it difficult to\nnavigate through the neighborhood. By June 2011, only 70\nhomes remained under private ownership and the Township\nwas in the process of demolishing 52 properties that it had\nacquired. These conditions discouraged any attempt at\nrehabilitating the neighborhood and encouraged existing\nresidents to sell their homes for less than they otherwise\nmight have been worth.\n\n       In October 2003, Citizens in Action filed a suit in state\ncourt alleging violations of New Jersey’s redevelopment laws\nand procedures, and various anti-discrimination laws.\nUltimately, the New Jersey Superior Court dismissed some\ncounts and granted summary judgment to the Township on\nthe others, concluding that there was no violation of New\nJersey law, that the area was blighted, and that the anti-\ndiscrimination claims were not ripe because the plan had not\nyet been implemented. The Appellate Division affirmed, and\nthe New Jersey Supreme Court denied a petition for\ncertiorari.\n\n       The Residents filed suit in the District Court on May\n27, 2008, raising the anti-discrimination claims that had not\nbeen ripe in their state suit. The federal complaint alleged,\namong other things, violations of the Fair Housing Act (the\n\n\n\n\n                              11\n\f“FHA”), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968; the Civil\nRights Act of 1866, as codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1982 6; and the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. 7     The Residents asked for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief to stop the redevelopment\nplan, as well as damages or compensation that would allow\nGardens residents to obtain housing in the Township. The\nResidents’ motion for a preliminary injunction was denied.\nAfter they filed an Amended Complaint, the Township, along\nwith the other named defendants, filed motions to dismiss.\nThe District Court converted these into motions for summary\njudgment and, after allowing the parties time to brief the\nmotions, granted summary judgment to the Township\ndefendants. The District Court ruled that there was no prima\nfacie case of discrimination under the FHA and that, even if\nthere was, the Residents had not shown how an alternative\ncourse of action would have had a lesser impact.\n\n      The Residents filed a timely appeal and we granted the\nResidents’ motion to stay redevelopment pending this appeal.\nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                             II.\n\n      6\n         42 U.S.C. § 1982 provides that “[a]ll citizens of the\nUnited States shall have the same right, in every State and\nTerritory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit,\npurchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal\nproperty.”\n      7\n         Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides in\npertinent part that “[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person\nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”\n\n\n\n\n                             12\n\f        We exercise plenary review over a District Court’s\nruling on summary judgment. See Disabled in Action of\nPennsylvania v. Se. Pennsylvania Transp. Auth., 635 F.3d 87,\n92 (3d Cir. 2011). “Summary judgment is appropriate only\nwhere, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the\nnonmoving party, there is no genuine issue as to any material\nfact . . . and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.” Id. (quoting Melrose, Inc. v. City of\nPittsburgh, 613 F.3d 380, 387 (3d Cir. 2010)).\n\n       The FHA makes it unlawful to “refuse to sell or rent . .\n. or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any\nperson because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or\nnational origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). A dwelling can be\nmade otherwise unavailable by, among other things, action\nthat limits the availability of affordable housing. See, e.g.,\nHuntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d\n926, 928-29, 938-39 (2d Cir. 1988); Smith v. Town of\nClarkton, 682 F.2d 1055, 1059, 1062-64 (4th Cir. 1982);\nResident Advisory Bd. v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 130 (3d Cir.\n1977). The FHA can be violated by either intentional\ndiscrimination or if a practice has a disparate impact on a\nprotected class. Cmty. Serv., Inc. v. Wind Gap Mun. Auth.,\n421 F.3d 170, 176 (3d Cir. 2005).\n\n       Disparate impact claims, which do not require proof of\ndiscriminatory intent, see Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 147-48, permit\nfederal law to reach “[c]onduct that has the necessary and\nforeseeable consequence of perpetuating segregation[, which]\ncan be as deleterious as purposefully discriminatory conduct\nin frustrating the national commitment to replace the ghettos\nby truly integrated and balanced living patterns.” Metro.\n\n\n\n\n                               13\n\fHous. Dev. Corp. v. Vill. of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d\n1283, 1289-90 (7th Cir. 1977). In order to determine whether\naction of this sort was “because of race” we look to see if it\nhad a “racially discriminatory effect,” i.e., whether it\ndisproportionately burdened a particular racial group so as to\ncause a disparate impact. Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 146-48; see also\nLapid-Laurel, LLC v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of Twp. of\nSouth Plains, 284 F.3d 442, 466-67 (3d Cir. 2002) (featuring\nclaims of a disparate impact on handicapped persons in\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)). This is called a prima facie\ncase of discrimination. Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 148 & n.31. If\nsuch a case is established, then we look to see whether the\ndefendant has a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its\nactions. Id. at 148. If it does, the defendant must then also\nestablish that “no alternative course of action could be\nadopted that would enable that interest to be served with less\ndiscriminatory impact.” Id. at 149. Finally, if the defendant\nmakes this showing, the burden once again shifts to those\nchallenging the action, who must demonstrate that there is a\nless discriminatory way to advance the defendant’s legitimate\ninterest. Id. at 149 n.37.\n\n                               A.\n\n       When viewed in the light most favorable to the\nResidents, the evidence submitted by the Residents was\nsufficient to establish a prima facie case. “[N]o single test\ncontrols in measuring disparate impact,” but the Residents\nmust offer proof of disproportionate impact, measured in a\nplausible way. Hallmark Developers, Inc. v. Fulton Cnty.,\n466 F.3d 1276, 1286 (11th Cir. 2006). Typically, “a disparate\nimpact is demonstrated by statistics,” id. at 1286, and a prima\nfacie case may be established where “gross statistical\n\n\n\n\n                              14\n\fdisparities can be shown.” Hazleton Sch. Dist. v. United\nStates, 433 U.S. 299, 307-08 (1977). According to the data in\nthe 2000 census conducted before the redevelopment plan\nbegan, 22.54% of African-American households and 32.31%\nof Hispanic households in Mount Holly will be affected by\nthe demolition of the Gardens. The same is true for only\n2.73% of White households. In short, the Residents’\nstatistical expert has calculated that African-Americans would\nbe 8 times more likely to be affected by the project than\nWhites, and Hispanics would be 11 times more likely to be\naffected. Furthermore, the 2000 data showed that only 21%\nof African-American and Hispanic households in Burlington\nCounty would be able to afford new market-rate housing in\nthe Gardens, compared to 79% of White households.\n\n        The District Court’s first error was in rejecting the\nResidents’ statistical submissions, which should have been\ntaken in the light most favorable to them at this stage in the\nproceedings. These statistics, like those presented in Rizzo\nand other prominent housing discrimination cases, show a\ndisparate impact. In Rizzo, the plaintiffs presented evidence\nthat, of the 14,000-15,000 people on a waiting list for public\nhousing, 85% were black and 95% were of a minority\nbackground. 564 F.2d at 142. Under these circumstances, we\nconcluded that the cancellation of a public housing project\nhad a “racially disproportionate effect, adverse to Blacks and\nother minorities in Philadelphia.” Id. Similarly, the plaintiffs\nin the Second Circuit case of Huntington Branch used\nstatistics showing that while only 7% of the residents in a\ntown required subsidized affordable housing, 24% of that\ntown’s Black residents required such housing, which meant\nthat Black residents were three times more likely to be\naffected by a shortage of affordable housing. 844 F.2d at\n\n\n\n\n                              15\n\f929. And in Keith v. Volpe, the Ninth Circuit concluded that\nthe FHA was violated where a blocked housing project had\ntwice the adverse impact on minorities. 858 F.2d 467, 484\n(9th Cir. 1988). The disparate impact here, while not as\nextreme as the impact in Rizzo, is similar to or greater than\nthe disparate impact found sufficient to establish a prima\nfacie case elsewhere. Under these circumstances, the District\nCourt erred in granting summary judgment to the Township.\n\n        Further, the District Court’s challenge to these\nstatistics in a footnote did not make the appropriate\ninferences. (JA 15-16 n.9). Instead, the District Court\nchallenged the statistical analysis underlying the 21% figure\nof Burlington County minority residents who could afford\nunits the redeveloped Gardens as both too broad, because it\ntook account of the entire population of Burlington County,\nand too narrow because it failed to consider minorities\noutside the county who might move in.\n\n       In addition, the District Court said the 21% figure did\nnot take into account the fact that 56 of the units in the\nRevised West Rancocas Plan would be designated as\naffordable housing. But the District Court’s analysis failed to\ntake into account the Residents’ evidence that these units,\nalthough labeled “affordable,” would be out of reach for\nalmost all of the Gardens residents.\n\n       The District Court also said that the statistics failed to\ntake into account non-minority purchasers who might rent to\nminorities. But, unless those purchasers offered below-\nmarket rents, this would not affect the inference that the\nproject had a disproportionate effect on Blacks and Hispanics\nwho would be unable to afford market-rate units.\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\f       As to the District Court’s concern that the statistics did\nnot take into account minorities who might move elsewhere\nin Mount Holly, the Residents’ expert opined that affordable\nhousing in the Township was scarce, and that most Gardens\nresidents would not be able to afford market-rate units\nelsewhere in the Township.\n\n       Lastly, the District Court erred when it rejected a\nreasonable inference in favor of the Residents by looking at\nthe absolute number of African-American and Hispanic\nhouseholds in Burlington County that could afford homes.\nInstead, the District Court should have looked to see whether\nthe African-American and Hispanic residents were\ndisproportionately affected by the redevelopment plan. See\nHuntington, 844 F.2d at 938 (“By relying on absolute\nnumbers rather than on proportional statistics, the district\ncourt significantly underestimated the disproportionate impact\nof the Town’s policy.”); Hallmark Developers, 466 F.3d at\n1286 (“[I]t may be inappropriate to rely on absolute numbers\nrather than on proportional statistics.”) (quoting Huntington,\n844 F.3d at 928.). 8\n\n       There is another problem. The District Court’s most\ntroubling error is its conflation of the concept of disparate\ntreatment with disparate impact.         The District Court\nessentially agreed with the Township that because 100% of\nminorities in the Gardens will be treated the same as 100% of\nnon-minorities in the Gardens, the Residents failed to prove\n\n       8\n         The Department of Justice filed an amicus curiae\nbrief agreeing that the District Court erred in its disparate\nimpact prima facie case analysis.\n\n\n\n\n                               17\n\fthere is a greater adverse impact on minorities. This was in\nerror. We need not simply ask whether the White residents at\nthe Gardens are treated the same as the minority residents at\nthe Gardens. The logic behind the FHA is more perceptive\nthan that. It looks beyond such specious concepts of equality\nto determine whether a person is being deprived of his lawful\nrights because of his race. Rather, a disparate impact inquiry\nrequires us to ask whether minorities are disproportionately\naffected by the redevelopment plan. Thus the Residents can\nestablish a prima facie case of disparate impact by showing\nthat minorities are disproportionately burdened by the\nredevelopment plan or that the redevelopment plan “[falls]\nmore harshly” on minorities. Doe v. City of Butler, 892 F.2d\n315, 323 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\n       The Township asserts that a disparate impact approach\nwould result in the unintended consequence of halting the\nredevelopment of minority neighborhoods and that it is\nforeclosed by the Supreme Court’s decision in City of\nMemphis v. Greene, which states that\n\n       [b]ecause urban neighborhoods are so\n      frequently characterized by a common ethnic or\n      racial heritage, a regulation’s adverse impact on\n      a particular neighborhood will often have a\n      disparate effect on an identifiable ethnic or\n      racial group.        To regard an inevitable\n      consequence of that kind as a form of stigma so\n      severe as to violate the Thirteenth Amendment\n      would trivialize the great purpose of that charter\n      of freedom.\n\n451 U.S. 100, 128 (1981).\n\n\n\n\n                             18\n\f       There are three problems with the Township’s\nposition. First, City of Memphis was concerned with the\nstandard for establishing a violation of the Thirteenth\nAmendment’s ban on the “badges and incidents of slavery in\nthe United States.” Id. at 125-26. Whatever that standard\nmight be—a question left open by the Supreme Court’s ruling\nin that case, see id. at 130 (White, J., concurring)—City of\nMemphis did not consider the FHA. All of the courts of\nappeals that have considered the matter, including this one,\nhave concluded that plaintiffs can show the FHA has been\nviolated through policies that have a disparate impact on a\nminority group. See Greater New Orleans Fair Housing\nAction Center v. HUD, 639 F.3d 1078, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 2011)\n(acknowledging the majority view but declining to take a\nposition on the matters); Simms v. First Gibraltar Bank, 83\nF.3d 1546, 1555 (5th Cir. 1996); Mountain Side Mobile\nEstates P'ship v. HUD, 56 F.3d 1243, 1250-51 (10th Cir.\n1995); Jackson v. Okaloosa County, 21 F.3d 1531, 1543\n(11th Cir. 1994); Casa Marie, Inc. v. Superior Court of\nPuerto Rico, 988 F.2d 252, 269 n.20 (1st Cir. 1993); Keith,\n858 F.2d at 482-84; United States v. Starrett City Assocs., 840\nF.2d 1096, 1100 (2d Cir. 1988); Arthur v. City of Toledo, 782\nF.2d 565, 574-75 (6th Cir. 1986); Smith, 682 F.2d at 1065;\nUnited States v. Mitchell, 580 F.2d 789, 791-92 (5th Cir.\n1978); Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 147-48; Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.,\n558 F.2d at 1290; United States v. City of Black Jack, 508\nF.2d 1179, 1184 (8th Cir. 1974).\n\n       Second, the Township’s approach urges us to conclude\nthat the FHA is violated only when a policy treats each\nindividual minority resident differently from each individual\nWhite resident. Under our precedent, a plaintiff may\n\n\n\n\n                              19\n\festablish a prima facie case of discrimination by\ndemonstrating that the policy disproportionately affects or\nimpacts one group more than another—facially disparate\ntreatment need not be shown. For instance, in Rizzo, the\nwaiting list for public housing comprised 85% African-\nAmericans and 95% minorities, meaning that 5% were White.\n564 F.2d at 142. The White residents on the list were treated\nthe same as the minority residents on the list—each was hurt\nby Philadelphia’s decision to block a public housing\nproject—but we nevertheless found a violation of the FHA\nbecause cancelling the project had a “racially disproportionate\neffect” on African-Americans. Id. at 149 (“Nor can there be\nany doubt that the impact of the governmental defendants’\ntermination of the project was felt primarily by blacks, who\nmake up a substantial proportion of those who would be\neligible to reside there.”) (emphasis added).\n\n        The Township may be correct that a disparate impact\nanalysis will often allow plaintiffs to make out a prima facie\ncase when a segregated neighborhood is redeveloped in\ncircumstances where there is a shortage of alternative\naffordable housing. But this is a feature of the FHA’s\nprogramming, not a bug. The FHA is a broadly remedial\nstatute designed to prevent and remedy invidious\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, see Havens Realty Corp.\nv. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 380 (1982), that facilitates its anti-\ndiscrimination agenda by encouraging a searching inquiry\ninto the motives behind a contested policy to ensure that it is\nnot improper. See Christine Jolls, Antidiscrimination and\nAccommodation, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 642, 652 (2001)\n(remarking that a “leading gloss” on the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971),\nis that “disparate impact functions as a means of smoking out\n\n\n\n\n                              20\n\fsubtle or underlying forms of intentional discrimination on\nthe basis of group membership.”). We need not be concerned\nthat this approach is too expansive because the establishment\nof a prima facie case, by itself, is not enough to establish\nliability under the FHA. It simply results in a more searching\ninquiry into the defendant’s motivations—precisely the sort\nof inquiry required to ensure that the government does not\ndeprive people of housing “because of race.”\n\n        Finally, the Township seems to argue that its\nredevelopment plan does not violate Title VIII unless the\nstatistics show that it increases segregation in the Township.\n(Twp. Br. at 18.). Showing that a policy has a segregative\neffect is one way to establish a violation of Title VIII, but it is\nnot the only way. See Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 937\n(observing that a policy often discriminates in one of two\nways: having a disparate impact or perpetuating segregation).\nThe Township is free to argue that its plan is less\ndiscriminatory than all of the available alternatives because it\ndoes the best job of integrating the neighborhood. However,\nthose arguments are properly considered in the context of the\nlast steps of the Title VIII analysis, not as a requirement of\nthe prima facie case.\n\n       In reality, the District Court’s decision was based on a\nvalid and practical concern, which appears to drive its\nreasoning throughout the opinion. It feared that finding a\ndisparate impact here would render the Township powerless\nto rehabilitate its blighted neighborhoods. This underlying\nrationale distorts the focus and analysis of disparate impact\ncases under the FHA. In disparate impact cases, “[e]ffect, not\nmotivation, is the touchstone because a thoughtless housing\npractice can be as unfair to minority rights as a willful\n\n\n\n\n                                21\n\fscheme.” Smith v. Anchor Bldg. Corp., 536 F.2d 231, 233\n(8th Cir. 1977). Once the Residents established a prima facie\ncase of disparate impact, the District Court’s inquiry must\ncontinue to determine whether a person is being deprived of\nhis lawful rights because of his race. It must ask whether that\nTownship’s legitimate objectives could have been achieved in\na less discriminatory way.\n\n                                 B.\n\n        Once the plaintiffs establish a prima facie case, the\ndefendants must offer a legitimate reason for their actions. In\nthis case, everyone agrees that alleviating blight is a\nlegitimate interest. The core of the dispute between the\nparties is over the next step of the FHA’s burden-shifting\nanalysis: whether the defendants have shown that there is no\nless discriminatory alternative. Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149. Only\nwhen the defendants make this showing does the burden shift\nback to the plaintiffs—where it ultimately remains—to\nprovide evidence of such an alternative. Id. at 149 n.37. The\ntest for whether there is no alternative is “similar to the test of\nwhether the defendant has demonstrated that the requested\naccommodation is ‘unreasonable’ for the purposes of\nrebutting a claim under § 3604(f)(3)(B).” Lapid-Laurel, 284\nF.3d at 468. Section 2604(f)(3)(B) of the FHA requires that\nreasonable housing accommodations be made for individuals\nwith disabilities. In other words, the defendant must show\nthat the alternatives impose an undue hardship under the\ncircumstances of this specific case. See US Airways v.\nBarnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401-02 (2002) (discussing the term\n“unreasonable accommodation” under the Americans with\nDisabilities Act).\n\n\n\n\n                                22\n\f      The District Court characterized the Residents’\nproposed alternative as follows:\n\n       [E]ffectively, plaintiffs are seeking to remain\n       living in the blighted and unsafe conditions\n       until they are awarded money damages for their\n       claims and sufficient compensation to secure\n       housing in the local housing market. Although\n       couched at times like an effort to have the\n       development go up around them, like a highway\n       built around a protected tree, or to have their\n       units rehabilitated, this makes little if no\n       practical sense after years of litigation,\n       approved redevelopment plans, and the\n       expenditure of significant public resources. At\n       this late stage, the only real practical remedy is\n       for plaintiffs to receive the fair value for their\n       home as well as proper and non-discriminatory\n       relocation procedures and benefits . . . . The\n       relief they are seeking is inconsistent with\n       proving the fourth element of their FHA claim-\n       namely, that an alternative course of action to\n       eminent domain and relocation is viable.\n\n(JA 17 n.12) (ellipsis in original).\n\n       The Residents’ evidence is susceptible to more\nfavorable inferences. The Residents are not asking for\npermission to continue to live in “blighted and unsafe”\nconditions. Instead, they argue that there is a feasible plan\nthat meets the Township’s goals and entails more substantial\nrehabilitation. Taking the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the Residents, one could credit the report of the\n\n\n\n\n                                23\n\fResidents’ planning expert, which stated that the “blighted\nand unsafe” conditions could be remedied in a far less heavy-\nhanded manner that would not entail the wholesale\ndestruction and rebuilding of the neighborhood.\n\n       The Residents’ expert pointed out that, although the\nRevised West Rancocas Plan called for development in\nstages, the Township began the development by aggressively\nacquiring houses, which it left vacant and then destroyed. He\nopined that a more gradual redevelopment plan would have\nallowed existing residents to move elsewhere in the\nneighborhood during one part of the redevelopment, and then\nmove back once the redevelopment was completed. The\nResidents’ expert further noted that the Township had not\nperformed a comparative cost analysis showing that total\ndemolition, relocation, and new construction was less feasible\nthan an alternative focused on rehabilitation. Indeed, the\nexpert went on to propose an alternative redevelopment plan\nthat would rely on the targeted acquisition and rehabilitation\nof some of the existing Gardens homes, the combination of\nsome houses to make larger homes, an initiative to make the\nhouses more attractive through the use of landscaping and\nadded amenities such as decks and porches, and selective\ndemolition and new construction, including the construction\nof more affordable units. The Residents’ expert also provided\nexamples of previous alternatives—including one developed\nas early as 1989—to show that the complete demolition of the\nneighborhood was not the only possible solution to blight in\nthe Gardens. 9 Finally, he provided a non-exhaustive list of\n\n      9\n        The 1989 plan was not provided as the alternative but\nonly to show that less discriminatory alternatives had been\nconsidered in the past and could serve as the basis for an\n\n\n\n\n                             24\n\fstate and federal funding programs that would support such a\nredevelopment plan and observed that the Township had\nfailed to make an active effort to locate a developer with\nexperience in neighborhood rehabilitation.\n\n       The Township provided the contrasting statements of\nits Township manager, who argued that a rehabilitation\nprogram was not economically feasible. In support, she cited\nthe fact that one alternative, the Mt. Holly 2000 program,\ndemonstrated that rehabilitation of each unit would be\nextremely costly. She also challenged the availability of\nsources of funding for a rehabilitation.        Lastly, she\nemphasized the many problems that led the Township to\ndeclare the Gardens an area in need of redevelopment and\nasserted the belief of the Township Council and its planning\nboard that demolition and replacement is the most effective\nand efficient approach to solving the neighborhood’s\nproblems.\n\n       These contrasting statements, as well as the parties’\ncontinued arguments on appeal as to the cost and feasibility\nof an alternative relying on rehabilitation, create genuine\nissues of material fact that require further investigation. Once\nthe record on alternatives has been more fully developed, the\nDistrict Court may entertain renewed motions for summary\njudgment, taking into account the Township’s initial burden\nof showing that there are no less discriminatory alternatives,\nas well as the standard advanced in Lapid-Laurel for\n\n\n\n\nupdated approach that would lessen the redevelopment’s\nimpact on minority residents of the Township.\n\n\n\n\n                              25\n\fultimately determining        whether      an   alternative    is\nunreasonable. 10\n\n                                    III.\n\n       The Residents are also seeking to recover under the\ntheory that the Township intentionally discriminated against\nits minority residents when it adopted the redevelopment\nplan. The District Court saw no evidence of intentional\ndiscrimination and granted the Township’s motion for\nsummary judgment. After carefully considering the matter,\nwe discern no error in the District Court’s decision and will\nthus affirm that ruling.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n       The Township has broad discretion to implement the\npolicies it believes will improve its residents’ quality of life.\nBut that discretion is bounded by laws like the FHA and by\nthe Constitution, which prevent policies that discriminate on\nthe basis of race. For this reason, “the federal courts must\n\n       10\n          Triad asserts that the portion of the District Court’s\norder relating to its involvement should be affirmed because\nthe Residents, on appeal, have waived their claims against it.\nWe disagree. In their brief, the Residents argue that the\nredevelopers, which include Triad, provided inadequate\nrelocation assistance, allowed residents to be improperly\npressured to leave, and that the redevelopment plan\nessentially pushes minority residents out of Mount Holly. For\nall of the reasons stated in this opinion, these are genuine\nissues of material fact that must be resolved through further\ndiscovery on remand.\n\n\n\n\n                               26\n\fstand prepared to provide ‘such remedies as are necessary to\nmake effective the congressional purpose.’” Rizzo, 564 F.2d\nat 149 (quoting J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433\n(1964)). A more developed factual record will assist the\nDistrict Court in crafting appropriate remedies, if necessary.\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the District Court’s order\ngranting summary judgment is vacated and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                             27\n\f",

Appellants, an association of Gardens residents organized under the name Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, and 23 current and former residents of the neighborhood (collectively the \"Residents\") filed suit against the Township alleging violations of various anti-discrimination laws.</p>\n<p>Before the Township filed an Answer or discovery on these allegations had taken place, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Township. Because the District Court misapplied the standard for deciding whether the Residents could establish a <i>prima facie</i> case under Title VIII and because it did not draw all reasonable inferences in the Residents' favor, we will reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.<sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>The homes in this dispute are located in a 30-acre neighborhood called the Gardens in the Township of Mount Holly in Burlington County, New Jersey. The Gardens is the only neighborhood in the Township comprised predominantly of African-American and Hispanic residents. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*378</span> It is pooralmost all of its residents earn less than 80% of the area's median income; with most earning much less.</p>\n<p>The 329<sup>[2]</sup> homes in the Gardens are predominantly two-story buildings made out of solid brick. Built in the 1950s, the homes are attached in rows of 8 to 10 and are set back from the curving streets to allow for front and back yards, with alleys running behind each housing block. Two major commercial districts abut opposite sides of the neighborhood, which is only a mile away from the major downtown business district. Until 2004, the neighborhood was also home to a playground and a community center.</p>\n<p>The 2000 census provides a snapshot of the neighborhood.<sup>[3]</sup> According to that data, the Gardens neighborhood was split evenly between rental properties (with a median rental price of $705 per month) and homeowners (the median cost of homeownership was $969 per month). Eighty-one percent of the homeowners had lived in their homes for at least 9 years; 72% of renters had lived there for at least five years. Of the 1,031<sup>[4]</sup> residents living in the neighborhood, 203, or 19.7%, were non-Hispanic Whites; 475, or 46.1% were African-Americans; and 297, or 28.8% were Hispanic, the highest concentration of minority residents within Mt. Holly. Almost all of these residents were classified as \"low income\"; indeed, most were classified as having \"very low\" or \"extremely low\" incomes.</p>\n<p>The neighborhood was not perfect. For one, it was crowded. This created a parking shortage, which led residents to pave their backyards for use as driveways, which, in turn, led to drainage problems. In addition, the fact that the homes were owned in fee simple meant there was no one with a vested interest in maintaining common spaces, such as the alleys. Some of the owners were nothing more than absentee landlords, renting to individuals with little interest in maintaining the properties. Over the years, many of the properties fell into disrepair. Vacant properties were boarded up, some yards filled with rubbish, and parts of the area became blighted. Because the houses were connected to one another, the dilapidation of one house could and sometimes did lead to the decay of the adjoining houses. Finally, the dense population, narrow streets, and vacant properties facilitated crime. In 1999, 28% of crimes in the Township occurred in the Gardens, even though that neighborhood covers only 1.5% of the Township's land area.</p>\n<p>These many problems were not ignored. Local community activists and business leaders worked to revitalize the Gardens through a private initiative that eventually came to be known as \"Mt. Holly 2000.\" This community endeavor sought to reverse the neighborhood's decline by rehabilitating properties and increasing social services. Despite sporadic achievementsten homes were renovated and a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*379</span> community policing center was establishedthe neighborhood's problems continued.</p>\n<p>In the year 2000, the Township commissioned a study to determine whether the Gardens should be designated as an \"area in need of redevelopment\" under New Jersey's redevelopment laws. The resulting report, issued on November 8, 2000 concluded that the area offered a \"significant opportunity for redevelopment\" because of blight, excess land coverage, poor land use, and excess crime. (JA 699). That same year, the Township began to acquire properties in the Gardens. Those properties were left vacant.</p>\n<p>A series of redevelopment plans followed. In 2003, the Township issued the Gardens Area Redevelopment Plan (\"GARP\"). This plan called for the demolition of all of the homes in the neighborhood and the permanent or temporary relocation of all of its residents. In their place, the plan provided for the construction of 180 new market-rate housing units, thirty of which would be available only to senior citizens. The plan was changed in 2005 to include a parcel of land immediately north of the Gardens. This plan, the West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan, also called for the destruction of most of the original Gardens homes, to be replaced with 228 new residential units composed of two-family dwellings and townhouses. Unlike the GARP, the West Rancocas plan provided for the optional rehabilitation of some of the original Gardens homes and allowed for the residents of those rehabilitated units to be temporarily relocated in phases so that they could remain in the neighborhood. The West Rancocas plan also contemplated that 10% of the 228 units would be designated as affordable housing. Finally, in 2008, the plan was changed again. This time, the Revised West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan called for construction of up to 520 houses, 75% of which could be townhouses and 50% of which could be apartments. The revised plan called for only 56 deed-restricted affordable housing units, 11 of which would be offered on a priority basis to existing Gardens residents. This revised plan did not include any rehabilitation of existing units.</p>\n<p>At each stage of the process, many Gardens residents objected to the redevelopment, complaining about the destruction of their neighborhood and expressing fear that they would not be able to afford to live anywhere else in the Township. One resident complained that the house next to hers was torn down and that a bulldozer had hit her home, tearing the wall, cracking the ceiling, and shifting her roof. (JA 577-78, 1001). Another resident, a 70-year-old disabled homeowner, told the Township's Planning Board that, were he displaced, he would be unable to work and unable to afford a new home. (JA 1002). At one meeting in 2005, a planning expert testified that the West Rancocas plan was deficient because it only allowed rehabilitation as an option, without requiring or even encouraging it. He also said that 90% of the Gardens' existing residents would not be able to afford the newly-constructed homes and complained that the plan did not provide an estimate of affordable housing in the existing market for displaced residents. (JA 990, 1117).</p>\n<p>Despite these complaints, work on the development continued. In February 2006 Keating Urban Partners, LLC, was chosen as the plan developer. Keating, in turn, hired Triad to develop a relocation plan. That plan, the Workable Relocation Assistance Plan (\"WRAP\"), was submitted to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs on September 28, 2006 and provided that all residents living in the Gardens on August 1, 2006 would receive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*380</span> relocation assistance. Qualified homeowners would receive $15,000 and a $20,000 no-interest loan to assist in the purchase of a replacement home. The Township offered to buy homes for between $32,000 and $49,000.<sup>[5]</sup> The estimated cost of a new home in the development was between $200,000 and $275,000, well outside the range of affordability for a significant portion of the African-American and Hispanic residents of the Township.</p>\n<p>Renters were authorized to receive up to $7,500 of relocation assistance, but were not eligible for relocation funds to return to the Gardens. In any case, the vast majority of those renters would be unable to afford the proposed market-rate rent of $1,230 per month. Eventually, the Township paid to relocate 62 families, 42 of which moved outside of Mt. Holly Township. Renters who moved often had to pay more in rent at their new homes.</p>\n<p>Although the redevelopment plan called for building in phases, the Township began to acquire and demolish all of the homes in the Gardens, thereby displacing many residents and creating conditions that encouraged the remaining residents to leave. By August 2008, 75 homes had been destroyed and 148 homes had been acquired and left vacant. Later that fall, the Township demolished 60 more homes. And, in the summer of 2009, 50 more homes were knocked down. Residents living amongst the destruction were forced to cope with noise, vibration, dust, and debris. Worse, the interconnected nature of the houses triggered a cascading array of problems. Uninsulated interior walls were exposed to the outside and covered with unsightly stucco or tar. But these coatings did not extend below grade, allowing moisture to seep into subterranean crawl spaces, creating an environment for mold problems. Above, the demolitions opened the roofs of adjoining homes. Those openings were patched with plywood, which was insufficient to stop water leaks. Around the neighborhood, homes bore the scars of demolition: hanging wires and telephone boxes, ragged brick corners, open masonry joints, rough surfaces, irregular plywood patches, and damaged porches, floors and railings. Destruction of the sidewalks outside demolished homes further contributed to the disarray by making it difficult to navigate through the neighborhood. By June 2011, only 70 homes remained under private ownership and the Township was in the process of demolishing 52 properties that it had acquired. These conditions discouraged any attempt at rehabilitating the neighborhood and encouraged existing residents to sell their homes for less than they otherwise might have been worth.</p>\n<p>In October 2003, Citizens in Action filed a suit in state court alleging violations of New Jersey's redevelopment laws and procedures, and various anti-discrimination laws. Ultimately, the New Jersey Superior Court dismissed some counts and granted summary judgment to the Township on the others, concluding that there was no violation of New Jersey law, that the area was blighted, and that the antidiscrimination claims were not ripe because the plan had not yet been implemented. The Appellate Division affirmed, and the New Jersey Supreme Court denied a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p>The Residents filed suit in the District Court on May 27, 2008, raising the antidiscrimination claims that had not been ripe in their state suit. The federal complaint alleged, among other things, violations of the Fair Housing Act (the \"FHA\"), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968; the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as codified at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*381</span> 42 U.S.C. § 1982<sup>[6]</sup>; and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<sup>[7]</sup> The Residents asked for declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the redevelopment plan, as well as damages or compensation that would allow Gardens residents to obtain housing in the Township. The Residents' motion for a preliminary injunction was denied. After they filed an Amended Complaint, the Township, along with the other named defendants, filed motions to dismiss. The District Court converted these into motions for summary judgment and, after allowing the parties time to brief the motions, granted summary judgment to the Township defendants. The District Court ruled that there was no <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination under the FHA and that, even if there was, the Residents had not shown how an alternative course of action would have had a lesser impact.</p>\n<p>The Residents filed a timely appeal and we granted the Residents' motion to stay redevelopment pending this appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We exercise plenary review over a District Court's ruling on summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania v. Se. Pennsylvania Transp. Auth.,</i> 635 F.3d 87, 92 (3d Cir.2011). \"Summary judgment is appropriate only where, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact . . . and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Melrose, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh,</i> 613 F.3d 380, 387 (3d Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p>The FHA makes it unlawful to \"refuse to sell or rent . . . or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). A dwelling can be made otherwise unavailable by, among other things, action that limits the availability of affordable housing. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington,</i> 844 F.2d 926, 928-29, 938-39 (2d Cir.1988); <i>Smith v. Town of Clarkton,</i> 682 F.2d 1055, 1059, 1062-64 (4th Cir.1982); <i>Resident Advisory Bd. v. Rizzo,</i> 564 F.2d 126, 130 (3d Cir.1977). The FHA can be violated by either intentional discrimination or if a practice has a disparate impact on a protected class. <i>Cmty. Serv., Inc. v. Wind Gap Mun. Auth.,</i> 421 F.3d 170, 176 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Disparate impact claims, which do not require proof of discriminatory intent, <i>see </i><i>Rizzo,</i> 564 F.2d at 147-48, permit federal law to reach \"[c]onduct that has the necessary and foreseeable consequence of perpetuating segregation[, which] can be as deleterious as purposefully discriminatory conduct in frustrating the national commitment to replace the ghettos by truly integrated and balanced living patterns.\" <i>Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp. v. Vill. of Arlington Heights,</i> 558 F.2d 1283, 1289-90 (7th Cir.1977). In order to determine whether action of this sort was \"because of race\" we look to see if it had a \"racially discriminatory effect,\" i.e., whether it disproportionately burdened a particular racial group so as to cause a disparate impact. <i>Rizzo,</i> 564 F.2d at 146-48; <i>see also </i><i>Lapid-Laurel, LLC v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*382</span> <i>of Twp. of Scotch Plains,</i> 284 F.3d 442, 466-67 (3d Cir.2002) (featuring claims of a disparate impact on handicapped persons in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)). This is called a prima facie case of discrimination. <i>Rizzo,</i> 564 F.2d at 148 &amp; n. 31. If such a case is established, then we look to see whether the defendant has a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. <i>Id.</i> at 148. If it does, the defendant must then also establish that \"no alternative course of action could be adopted that would enable that interest to be served with less discriminatory impact.\" <i>Id.</i> at 149. Finally, if the defendant makes this showing, the burden once again shifts to those challenging the action, who must demonstrate that there is a less discriminatory way to advance the defendant's legitimate interest. <i>Id.</i> at 149 n. 37.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>When viewed in the light most favorable to the Residents, the evidence submitted by the Residents was sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case. \"[N]o single test controls in measuring disparate impact,\" but the Residents must offer proof of disproportionate impact, measured in a plausible way. <i>Hallmark Developers, Inc. v. Fulton Cnty.,</i> 466 F.3d 1276, 1286 (11th Cir.2006). Typically, \"a disparate impact is demonstrated by statistics,\" <i>id.</i> at 1286, and a <i>prima facie</i> case may be established where \"gross statistical disparities can be shown.\" <i>Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. United States,</i> 433 U.S. 299, 307-08, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977). According to the data in the 2000 census conducted before the redevelopment plan began, 22.54% of African-American households and 32.31% of Hispanic households in Mount Holly will be affected by the demolition of the Gardens. The same is true for only 2.73% of White households. In short, the Residents' statistical expert has calculated that African-Americans would be 8 times more likely to be affected by the project than Whites, and Hispanics would be 11 times more likely to be affected. Furthermore, the 2000 data showed that only 21% of African-American and Hispanic households in Burlington County would be able to afford new market-rate housing in the Gardens, compared to 79% of White households.</p>\n<p>The District Court's first error was in rejecting the Residents' statistical submissions, which should have been taken in the light most favorable to them at this stage in the proceedings. These statistics, like those presented in <i>Rizzo</i> and other prominent housing discrimination cases, show a disparate impact. In <i>Rizzo,</i> the plaintiffs presented evidence that, of the 14,000-15,000 people on a waiting list for public housing, 85% were black and 95% were of a minority background. 564 F.2d at 142. Under these circumstances, we concluded that the cancellation of a public housing project had a \"racially disproportionate effect, adverse to Blacks and other minorities in Philadelphia.\" <i>Id.</i> Similarly, the plaintiffs in the Second Circuit case of <i>Huntington Branch</i> used statistics showing that while only 7% of the residents in a town required subsidized affordable housing, 24% of that town's Black residents required such housing, which meant that Black residents were three times more likely to be affected by a shortage of affordable housing. 844 F.2d at 929. And in <i>Keith v. Volpe,</i> the Ninth Circuit concluded that the FHA was violated where a blocked housing project had twice the adverse impact on minorities. 858 F.2d 467, 484 (9th Cir.1988). The disparate impact here, while not as extreme as the impact in <i>Rizzo,</i> is similar to or greater than the disparate impact found sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case elsewhere. Under these circumstances, the District Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> erred in granting summary judgment to the Township.</p>\n<p>Further, the District Court's challenge to these statistics in a footnote did not make the appropriate inferences. (JA 15-16 n.9). Instead, the District Court challenged the statistical analysis underlying the 21% figure of Burlington County minority residents who could afford units the redeveloped Gardens as both too broad, because it took account of the entire population of Burlington County, and too narrow because it failed to consider minorities <i>outside</i> the county who might move in.</p>\n<p>In addition, the District Court said the 21% figure did not take into account the fact that 56 of the units in the Revised West Rancocas Plan would be designated as affordable housing. But the District Court's analysis failed to take into account the Residents' evidence that these units, although labeled \"affordable,\" would be out of reach for almost all of the Gardens residents.</p>\n<p>The District Court also said that the statistics failed to take into account non-minority purchasers who might rent to minorities. But, unless those purchasers offered below-market rents, this would not affect the inference that the project had a disproportionate effect on Blacks and Hispanics who would be unable to afford market-rate units.</p>\n<p>As to the District Court's concern that the statistics did not take into account minorities who might move elsewhere in Mount Holly, the Residents' expert opined that affordable housing in the Township was scarce, and that most Gardens residents would not be able to afford market-rate units elsewhere in the Township.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the District Court erred when it rejected a reasonable inference in favor of the Residents by looking at the <i>absolute</i> number of African-American and Hispanic households in Burlington County that could afford homes. Instead, the District Court should have looked to see whether the African-American and Hispanic residents were <i>disproportionately</i> affected by the redevelopment plan. <i>See </i><i>Huntington,</i> 844 F.2d at 938 (\"By relying on absolute numbers rather than on proportional statistics, the district court significantly underestimated the disproportionate impact of the Town's policy.\"); <i>Hallmark Developers,</i> 466 F.3d at 1286 (\"[I]t may be inappropriate to rely on absolute numbers rather than on proportional statistics.\") (quoting <i>Huntington,</i> 844 F.2d at 928.).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>There is another problem. The District Court's most troubling error is its conflation of the concept of disparate treatment with disparate impact. The District Court essentially agreed with the Township that because 100% of minorities in the Gardens will be treated the same as 100% of non-minorities in the Gardens, the Residents failed to prove there is a greater adverse impact on minorities. This was in error. We need not simply ask whether the White residents at the Gardens are <i>treated</i> the same as the minority residents at the Gardens. The logic behind the FHA is more perceptive than that. It looks beyond such specious concepts of equality to determine whether a person is being deprived of his lawful rights because of his race. Rather, a disparate impact inquiry requires us to ask whether minorities are disproportionately <i>affected</i> by the redevelopment plan. Thus the Residents can establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of disparate impact by showing that minorities are disproportionately burdened by the redevelopment plan or that the redevelopment plan \"[falls] more harshly\" on minorities. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*384</span> <i>Doe v. City of Butler,</i> 892 F.2d 315, 323 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p>The Township asserts that a disparate impact approach would result in the unintended consequence of halting the redevelopment of minority neighborhoods and that it is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>City of Memphis v. Greene,</i> which states that</p>\n<blockquote>[b]ecause urban neighborhoods are so frequently characterized by a common ethnic or racial heritage, a regulation's adverse impact on a particular neighborhood will often have a disparate effect on an identifiable ethnic or racial group. To regard an inevitable consequence of that kind as a form of stigma so severe as to violate the Thirteenth Amendment would trivialize the great purpose of that charter of freedom.</blockquote>\n<p>451 U.S. 100, 128, 101 S.Ct. 1584, 67 L.Ed.2d 769 (1981).</p>\n<p>There are three problems with the Township's position. First, <i>City of Memphis</i> was concerned with the standard for establishing a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's ban on the \"badges and incidents of slavery in the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> at 125-26, 101 S.Ct. 1584. Whatever that standard might bea question left open by the Supreme Court's ruling in that case, <i>see id.</i> at 130, 101 S.Ct. 1584 (White, J., concurring)<i>City of Memphis</i> did not consider the FHA. All of the courts of appeals that have considered the matter, including this one, have concluded that plaintiffs can show the FHA has been violated through policies that have a disparate impact on a minority group. <i>See Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center v. HUD,</i> 639 F.3d 1078, 1085 (D.C.Cir.2011) (acknowledging the majority view but declining to take a position on the matters); <i>Simms v. First Gibraltar Bank,</i> 83 F.3d 1546, 1555 (5th Cir.1996); <i>Mountain Side Mobile Estates P'ship v. HUD,</i> 56 F.3d 1243, 1250-51 (10th Cir. 1995); <i>Jackson v. Okaloosa County,</i> 21 F.3d 1531, 1543 (11th Cir.1994); <i>Casa Marie, Inc. v. Superior Court of Puerto Rico,</i> 988 F.2d 252, 269 n. 20 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Keith,</i> 858 F.2d at 482-84; <i>United States v. Starrett City Assocs.,</i> 840 F.2d 1096, 1100 (2d Cir.1988); <i>Arthur v. City of Toledo,</i> 782 F.2d 565, 574-75 (6th Cir.1986); <i>Smith,</i> 682 F.2d at 1065; <i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> 580 F.2d 789, 791-92 (5th Cir. 1978); <i>Rizzo,</i> 564 F.2d at 147-48; <i>Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.,</i> 558 F.2d at 1290; <i>United States v. City of Black Jack,</i> 508 F.2d 1179, 1184 (8th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p>Second, the Township's approach urges us to conclude that the FHA is violated only when a policy treats each individual minority resident differently from each individual White resident. Under our precedent, a plaintiff may establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination by demonstrating that the policy disproportionately affects or impacts one <i>group</i> more than anotherfacially disparate treatment need not be shown. For instance, in <i>Rizzo,</i> the waiting list for public housing comprised 85% African-Americans and 95% minorities, meaning that 5% were White. 564 F.2d at 142. The White residents on the list were treated the same as the minority residents on the listeach was hurt by Philadelphia's decision to block a public housing projectbut we nevertheless found a violation of the FHA because cancelling the project had a \"racially disproportionate effect\" on African-Americans. <i>Id.</i> at 149 (\"Nor can there be any doubt that the impact of the governmental defendants' termination of the project was felt primarily by blacks, who make up a substantial <i>proportion</i> of those who would be eligible to reside there.\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Township may be correct that a disparate impact analysis will often allow <span class=\"star-pagination\">*385</span> plaintiffs to make out a <i>prima facie</i> case when a segregated neighborhood is redeveloped in circumstances where there is a shortage of alternative affordable housing. But this is a feature of the FHA's programming, not a bug. The FHA is a broadly remedial statute designed to prevent and remedy invidious discrimination on the basis of race, <i>see </i><i>Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,</i> 455 U.S. 363, 380, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982), that facilitates its antidiscrimination agenda by encouraging a searching inquiry into the motives behind a contested policy to ensure that it is not improper. <i>See</i> Christine Jolls, <i>Antidiscrimination and Accommodation,</i> 115 Harv. L. Rev. 642, 652 (2001) (remarking that a \"leading gloss\" on the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,</i> 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971), is that \"disparate impact functions as a means of smoking out subtle or underlying forms of intentional discrimination on the basis of group membership.\"). We need not be concerned that this approach is too expansive because the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case, by itself, is not enough to establish liability under the FHA. It simply results in a more searching inquiry into the defendant's motivationsprecisely the sort of inquiry required to ensure that the government does not deprive people of housing \"because of race.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, the Township seems to argue that its redevelopment plan does not violate Title VIII unless the statistics show that it increases segregation in the Township. (Twp. Br. at 18.). Showing that a policy has a segregative effect is one way to establish a violation of Title VIII, but it is not the only way. <i>See </i><i>Huntington Branch,</i> 844 F.2d at 937 (observing that a policy often discriminates in one of two ways: having a disparate impact or perpetuating segregation). The Township is free to argue that its plan is less discriminatory than all of the available alternatives because it does the best job of integrating the neighborhood. However, those arguments are properly considered in the context of the last steps of the Title VIII analysis, not as a requirement of the <i>prima facie</i> case.</p>\n<p>In reality, the District Court's decision was based on a valid and practical concern, which appears to drive its reasoning throughout the opinion. It feared that finding a disparate impact here would render the Township powerless to rehabilitate its blighted neighborhoods. This underlying rationale distorts the focus and analysis of disparate impact cases under the FHA. In disparate impact cases, \"[e]ffect, not motivation, is the touchstone because a thoughtless housing practice can be as unfair to minority rights as a willful scheme.\" <i>Smith v. Anchor Bldg. Corp.,</i> 536 F.2d 231, 233 (8th Cir.1976). Once the Residents established a <i>prima facie</i> case of disparate impact, the District Court's inquiry must continue to determine whether a person is being deprived of his lawful rights because of his race. It must ask whether that Township's legitimate objectives could have been achieved in a less discriminatory way.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Once the plaintiffs establish a <i>prima facie</i> case, the defendants must offer a legitimate reason for their actions. In this case, everyone agrees that alleviating blight is a legitimate interest. The core of the dispute between the parties is over the next step of the FHA's burden-shifting analysis: whether the defendants have shown that there is no less discriminatory alternative. <i>Rizzo,</i> 564 F.2d at 149. Only when the defendants make this showing does the burden shift back to the plaintiffswhere it ultimately remainsto provide evidence of such an alternative. <i>Id.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*386</span> at 149 n. 37. The test for whether there is no alternative is \"similar to the test of whether the defendant has demonstrated that the requested accommodation is `unreasonable' for the purposes of rebutting a claim under § 3604(f)(3)(B).\" <i>Lapid-Laurel,</i> 284 F.3d at 468. Section 2604(f)(3)(B) of the FHA requires that reasonable housing accommodations be made for individuals with disabilities. In other words, the defendant must show that the alternatives impose an undue hardship under the circumstances of this specific case. <i>See </i><i>U.S. Airways v. Barnett,</i> 535 U.S. 391, 401-02, 122 S.Ct. 1516, 152 L.Ed.2d 589 (2002) (discussing the term \"unreasonable accommodation\" under the Americans with Disabilities Act).</p>\n<p>The District Court characterized the Residents' proposed alternative as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[E]ffectively, plaintiffs are seeking to remain living in the blighted and unsafe conditions until they are awarded money damages for their claims and sufficient compensation to secure housing in the local housing market. Although couched at times like an effort to have the development go up around them, like a highway built around a protected tree, or to have their units rehabilitated, this makes little if no practical sense after years of litigation, approved redevelopment plans, and the expenditure of significant public resources. At this late stage, the only real practical remedy is for plaintiffs to receive the fair value for their home as well as proper and non-discriminatory relocation procedures and benefits. . . . The relief they are seeking is inconsistent with proving the fourth element of their FHA claim-namely, that an alternative course of action to eminent domain and relocation is viable.</blockquote>\n<p>(JA 17 n.12) (ellipsis in original).</p>\n<p>The Residents' evidence is susceptible to more favorable inferences. The Residents are not asking for permission to continue to live in \"blighted and unsafe\" conditions. Instead, they argue that there is a feasible plan that meets the Township's goals and entails more substantial rehabilitation. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Residents, one could credit the report of the Residents' planning expert, which stated that the \"blighted and unsafe\" conditions could be remedied in a far less heavy-handed manner that would not entail the wholesale destruction and rebuilding of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The Residents' expert pointed out that, although the Revised West Rancocas Plan called for development in stages, the Township began the development by aggressively acquiring houses, which it left vacant and then destroyed. He opined that a more gradual redevelopment plan would have allowed existing residents to move elsewhere in the neighborhood during one part of the redevelopment, and then move back once the redevelopment was completed. The Residents' expert further noted that the Township had not performed a comparative cost analysis showing that total demolition, relocation, and new construction was less feasible than an alternative focused on rehabilitation. Indeed, the expert went on to propose an alternative redevelopment plan that would rely on the targeted acquisition and rehabilitation of some of the existing Gardens homes, the combination of some houses to make larger homes, an initiative to make the houses more attractive through the use of landscaping and added amenities such as decks and porches, and selective demolition and new construction, including the construction of more affordable units. The Residents' expert also provided examples of previous alternativesincluding one developed as early as 1989to show that the complete demolition of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*387</span> the neighborhood was not the only possible solution to blight in the Gardens.<sup>[9]</sup> Finally, he provided a non-exhaustive list of state and federal funding programs that would support such a redevelopment plan and observed that the Township had failed to make an active effort to locate a developer with experience in neighborhood rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>The Township provided the contrasting statements of its Township manager, who argued that a rehabilitation program was not economically feasible. In support, she cited the fact that one alternative, the Mt. Holly 2000 program, demonstrated that rehabilitation of each unit would be extremely costly. She also challenged the availability of sources of funding for a rehabilitation. Lastly, she emphasized the many problems that led the Township to declare the Gardens an area in need of redevelopment and asserted the belief of the Township Council and its planning board that demolition and replacement is the most effective and efficient approach to solving the neighborhood's problems.</p>\n<p>These contrasting statements, as well as the parties' continued arguments on appeal as to the cost and feasibility of an alternative relying on rehabilitation, create genuine issues of material fact that require further investigation. Once the record on alternatives has been more fully developed, the District Court may entertain renewed motions for summary judgment, taking into account the Township's initial burden of showing that there are no less discriminatory alternatives, as well as the standard advanced in <i>Lapid-Laurel</i> for ultimately determining whether an alternative is unreasonable.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The Residents are also seeking to recover under the theory that the Township intentionally discriminated against its minority residents when it adopted the redevelopment plan. The District Court saw no evidence of intentional discrimination and granted the Township's motion for summary judgment. After carefully considering the matter, we discern no error in the District Court's decision and will thus affirm that ruling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>The Township has broad discretion to implement the policies it believes will improve its residents' quality of life. But that discretion is bounded by laws like the FHA and by the Constitution, which prevent policies that discriminate on the basis of race.

(JA 61, 776, 1114).</p>\n<p>[3]  The parties dispute the utility of data from the 2000 census. However, none of the parties has briefed or even asked the question of <i>when</i> precisely the violations at issue in this case began. This issue is important because the redevelopment process began in 2002 and, as a result, the demographics of the township have changed. Disputes over which census numbers to use thus create a moving target; however, the 2000 census data appears to provide the most accurate demographic data at the inception of the redevelopment process.</p>\n<p>[4]  This is an approximate number provided by the Residents' expert.

We disagree. In their brief, the Residents argue that the redevelopers, which include Triad, provided inadequate relocation assistance, allowed residents to be improperly pressured to leave, and that the redevelopment plan essentially pushes minority residents out of Mount Holly. For all of the reasons stated in this opinion, these are genuine issues of material fact that must be resolved through further discovery on remand.</p>\n\n</div>",

Appellants, an association of Gardens residents organized under the name Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, and 23 current and former residents of the neighborhood (collectively the \"Residents\") filed suit against the Township alleging violations of various anti-discrimination laws.</p>\n<p>Before the Township filed an Answer or discovery on these allegations had taken place, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Township. Because the District Court misapplied the standard for deciding whether the Residents could establish a <i>prima facie</i> case under Title VIII and because it did not draw all reasonable inferences in the Residents' favor, we will reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.<sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>The homes in this dispute are located in a 30-acre neighborhood called the Gardens in the Township of Mount Holly in Burlington County, New Jersey. The Gardens is the only neighborhood in the Township comprised predominantly of African-American and Hispanic residents. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*378</span> It is pooralmost all of its residents earn less than 80% of the area's median income; with most earning much less.</p>\n<p>The 329<sup>[2]</sup> homes in the Gardens are predominantly two-story buildings made out of solid brick. Built in the 1950s, the homes are attached in rows of 8 to 10 and are set back from the curving streets to allow for front and back yards, with alleys running behind each housing block. Two major commercial districts abut opposite sides of the neighborhood, which is only a mile away from the major downtown business district. Until 2004, the neighborhood was also home to a playground and a community center.</p>\n<p>The 2000 census provides a snapshot of the neighborhood.<sup>[3]</sup> According to that data, the Gardens neighborhood was split evenly between rental properties (with a median rental price of $705 per month) and homeowners (the median cost of homeownership was $969 per month). Eighty-one percent of the homeowners had lived in their homes for at least 9 years; 72% of renters had lived there for at least five years. Of the 1,031<sup>[4]</sup> residents living in the neighborhood, 203, or 19.7%, were non-Hispanic Whites; 475, or 46.1% were African-Americans; and 297, or 28.8% were Hispanic, the highest concentration of minority residents within Mt. Holly. Almost all of these residents were classified as \"low income\"; indeed, most were classified as having \"very low\" or \"extremely low\" incomes.</p>\n<p>The neighborhood was not perfect. For one, it was crowded. This created a parking shortage, which led residents to pave their backyards for use as driveways, which, in turn, led to drainage problems. In addition, the fact that the homes were owned in fee simple meant there was no one with a vested interest in maintaining common spaces, such as the alleys. Some of the owners were nothing more than absentee landlords, renting to individuals with little interest in maintaining the properties. Over the years, many of the properties fell into disrepair. Vacant properties were boarded up, some yards filled with rubbish, and parts of the area became blighted. Because the houses were connected to one another, the dilapidation of one house could and sometimes did lead to the decay of the adjoining houses. Finally, the dense population, narrow streets, and vacant properties facilitated crime. In 1999, 28% of crimes in the Township occurred in the Gardens, even though that neighborhood covers only 1.5% of the Township's land area.</p>\n<p>These many problems were not ignored. Local community activists and business leaders worked to revitalize the Gardens through a private initiative that eventually came to be known as \"Mt. Holly 2000.\" This community endeavor sought to reverse the neighborhood's decline by rehabilitating properties and increasing social services. Despite sporadic achievementsten homes were renovated and a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*379</span> community policing center was establishedthe neighborhood's problems continued.</p>\n<p>In the year 2000, the Township commissioned a study to determine whether the Gardens should be designated as an \"area in need of redevelopment\" under New Jersey's redevelopment laws. The resulting report, issued on November 8, 2000 concluded that the area offered a \"significant opportunity for redevelopment\" because of blight, excess land coverage, poor land use, and excess crime. (JA 699). That same year, the Township began to acquire properties in the Gardens. Those properties were left vacant.</p>\n<p>A series of redevelopment plans followed. In 2003, the Township issued the Gardens Area Redevelopment Plan (\"GARP\"). This plan called for the demolition of all of the homes in the neighborhood and the permanent or temporary relocation of all of its residents. In their place, the plan provided for the construction of 180 new market-rate housing units, thirty of which would be available only to senior citizens. The plan was changed in 2005 to include a parcel of land immediately north of the Gardens. This plan, the West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan, also called for the destruction of most of the original Gardens homes, to be replaced with 228 new residential units composed of two-family dwellings and townhouses. Unlike the GARP, the West Rancocas plan provided for the optional rehabilitation of some of the original Gardens homes and allowed for the residents of those rehabilitated units to be temporarily relocated in phases so that they could remain in the neighborhood. The West Rancocas plan also contemplated that 10% of the 228 units would be designated as affordable housing. Finally, in 2008, the plan was changed again. This time, the Revised West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan called for construction of up to 520 houses, 75% of which could be townhouses and 50% of which could be apartments. The revised plan called for only 56 deed-restricted affordable housing units, 11 of which would be offered on a priority basis to existing Gardens residents. This revised plan did not include any rehabilitation of existing units.</p>\n<p>At each stage of the process, many Gardens residents objected to the redevelopment, complaining about the destruction of their neighborhood and expressing fear that they would not be able to afford to live anywhere else in the Township. One resident complained that the house next to hers was torn down and that a bulldozer had hit her home, tearing the wall, cracking the ceiling, and shifting her roof. (JA 577-78, 1001). Another resident, a 70-year-old disabled homeowner, told the Township's Planning Board that, were he displaced, he would be unable to work and unable to afford a new home. (JA 1002). At one meeting in 2005, a planning expert testified that the West Rancocas plan was deficient because it only allowed rehabilitation as an option, without requiring or even encouraging it. He also said that 90% of the Gardens' existing residents would not be able to afford the newly-constructed homes and complained that the plan did not provide an estimate of affordable housing in the existing market for displaced residents. (JA 990, 1117).</p>\n<p>Despite these complaints, work on the development continued. In February 2006 Keating Urban Partners, LLC, was chosen as the plan developer. Keating, in turn, hired Triad to develop a relocation plan. That plan, the Workable Relocation Assistance Plan (\"WRAP\"), was submitted to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs on September 28, 2006 and provided that all residents living in the Gardens on August 1, 2006 would receive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*380</span> relocation assistance. Qualified homeowners would receive $15,000 and a $20,000 no-interest loan to assist in the purchase of a replacement home. The Township offered to buy homes for between $32,000 and $49,000.<sup>[5]</sup> The estimated cost of a new home in the development was between $200,000 and $275,000, well outside the range of affordability for a significant portion of the African-American and Hispanic residents of the Township.</p>\n<p>Renters were authorized to receive up to $7,500 of relocation assistance, but were not eligible for relocation funds to return to the Gardens. In any case, the vast majority of those renters would be unable to afford the proposed market-rate rent of $1,230 per month. Eventually, the Township paid to relocate 62 families, 42 of which moved outside of Mt. Holly Township. Renters who moved often had to pay more in rent at their new homes.</p>\n<p>Although the redevelopment plan called for building in phases, the Township began to acquire and demolish all of the homes in the Gardens, thereby displacing many residents and creating conditions that encouraged the remaining residents to leave. By August 2008, 75 homes had been destroyed and 148 homes had been acquired and left vacant. Later that fall, the Township demolished 60 more homes. And, in the summer of 2009, 50 more homes were knocked down. Residents living amongst the destruction were forced to cope with noise, vibration, dust, and debris. Worse, the interconnected nature of the houses triggered a cascading array of problems. Uninsulated interior walls were exposed to the outside and covered with unsightly stucco or tar. But these coatings did not extend below grade, allowing moisture to seep into subterranean crawl spaces, creating an environment for mold problems. Above, the demolitions opened the roofs of adjoining homes. Those openings were patched with plywood, which was insufficient to stop water leaks. Around the neighborhood, homes bore the scars of demolition: hanging wires and telephone boxes, ragged brick corners, open masonry joints, rough surfaces, irregular plywood patches, and damaged porches, floors and railings. Destruction of the sidewalks outside demolished homes further contributed to the disarray by making it difficult to navigate through the neighborhood. By June 2011, only 70 homes remained under private ownership and the Township was in the process of demolishing 52 properties that it had acquired. These conditions discouraged any attempt at rehabilitating the neighborhood and encouraged existing residents to sell their homes for less than they otherwise might have been worth.</p>\n<p>In October 2003, Citizens in Action filed a suit in state court alleging violations of New Jersey's redevelopment laws and procedures, and various anti-discrimination laws. Ultimately, the New Jersey Superior Court dismissed some counts and granted summary judgment to the Township on the others, concluding that there was no violation of New Jersey law, that the area was blighted, and that the antidiscrimination claims were not ripe because the plan had not yet been implemented. The Appellate Division affirmed, and the New Jersey Supreme Court denied a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p>The Residents filed suit in the District Court on May 27, 2008, raising the antidiscrimination claims that had not been ripe in their state suit. The federal complaint alleged, among other things, violations of the Fair Housing Act (the \"FHA\"), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968; the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as codified at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*381</span> 42 U.S.C. § 1982<sup>[6]</sup>; and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<sup>[7]</sup> The Residents asked for declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the redevelopment plan, as well as damages or compensation that would allow Gardens residents to obtain housing in the Township. The Residents' motion for a preliminary injunction was denied. After they filed an Amended Complaint, the Township, along with the other named defendants, filed motions to dismiss. The District Court converted these into motions for summary judgment and, after allowing the parties time to brief the motions, granted summary judgment to the Township defendants. The District Court ruled that there was no <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination under the FHA and that, even if there was, the Residents had not shown how an alternative course of action would have had a lesser impact.</p>\n<p>The Residents filed a timely appeal and we granted the Residents' motion to stay redevelopment pending this appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We exercise plenary review over a District Court's ruling on summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span> (1977). According to the data in the 2000 census conducted before the redevelopment plan began, 22.54% of African-American households and 32.31% of Hispanic households in Mount Holly will be affected by the demolition of the Gardens. The same is true for only 2.73% of White households. In short, the Residents' statistical expert has calculated that African-Americans would be 8 times more likely to be affected by the project than Whites, and Hispanics would be 11 times more likely to be affected. Furthermore, the 2000 data showed that only 21% of African-American and Hispanic households in Burlington County would be able to afford new market-rate housing in the Gardens, compared to 79% of White households.</p>\n<p>The District Court's first error was in rejecting the Residents' statistical submissions, which should have been taken in the light most favorable to them at this stage in the proceedings. These statistics, like those presented in <i>Rizzo</i> and other prominent housing discrimination cases, show a disparate impact. In <i>Rizzo,</i> the plaintiffs presented evidence that, of the 14,000-15,000 people on a waiting list for public housing, 85% were black and 95% were of a minority background. 564 F.2d at 142. Under these circumstances, we concluded that the cancellation of a public housing project had a \"racially disproportionate effect, adverse to Blacks and other minorities in Philadelphia.\" <i>Id.</i> Similarly, the plaintiffs in the Second Circuit case of <i>Huntington Branch</i> used statistics showing that while only 7% of the residents in a town required subsidized affordable housing, 24% of that town's Black residents required such housing, which meant that Black residents were three times more likely to be affected by a shortage of affordable housing. 844 F.2d at 929. And in <i>Keith v. Volpe,</i> the Ninth Circuit concluded that the FHA was violated where a blocked housing project had twice the adverse impact on minorities. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512442\"><a href=\"/opinion/512442/ralph-w-keith-v-john-a-volpe-as-secretary-of-transportation-earl/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 484 (9th Cir.1988). The disparate impact here, while not as extreme as the impact in <i>Rizzo,</i> is similar to or greater than the disparate impact found sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case elsewhere. Under these circumstances, the District Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> erred in granting summary judgment to the Township.</p>\n<p>Further, the District Court's challenge to these statistics in a footnote did not make the appropriate inferences. (JA 15-16 n.9). Instead, the District Court challenged the statistical analysis underlying the 21% figure of Burlington County minority residents who could afford units the redeveloped Gardens as both too broad, because it took account of the entire population of Burlington County, and too narrow because it failed to consider minorities <i>outside</i> the county who might move in.</p>\n<p>In addition, the District Court said the 21% figure did not take into account the fact that 56 of the units in the Revised West Rancocas Plan would be designated as affordable housing. But the District Court's analysis failed to take into account the Residents' evidence that these units, although labeled \"affordable,\" would be out of reach for almost all of the Gardens residents.</p>\n<p>The District Court also said that the statistics failed to take into account non-minority purchasers who might rent to minorities. But, unless those purchasers offered below-market rents, this would not affect the inference that the project had a disproportionate effect on Blacks and Hispanics who would be unable to afford market-rate units.</p>\n<p>As to the District Court's concern that the statistics did not take into account minorities who might move elsewhere in Mount Holly, the Residents' expert opined that affordable housing in the Township was scarce, and that most Gardens residents would not be able to afford market-rate units elsewhere in the Township.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the District Court erred when it rejected a reasonable inference in favor of the Residents by looking at the <i>absolute</i> number of African-American and Hispanic households in Burlington County that could afford homes. Instead, the District Court should have looked to see whether the African-American and Hispanic residents were <i>disproportionately</i> affected by the redevelopment plan. <i>See </i><i>Huntington,</i> 844 F.2d at 938 (\"By relying on absolute numbers rather than on proportional statistics, the district court significantly underestimated the disproportionate impact of the Town's policy.\"); <i>Hallmark Developers,</i> 466 F.3d at 1286 (\"[I]t may be inappropriate to rely on absolute numbers rather than on proportional statistics.\") (quoting <i>Huntington,</i> 844 F.2d at 928.).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>There is another problem. The District Court's most troubling error is its conflation of the concept of disparate treatment with disparate impact. The District Court essentially agreed with the Township that because 100% of minorities in the Gardens will be treated the same as 100% of non-minorities in the Gardens, the Residents failed to prove there is a greater adverse impact on minorities. This was in error. We need not simply ask whether the White residents at the Gardens are <i>treated</i> the same as the minority residents at the Gardens. The logic behind the FHA is more perceptive than that. It looks beyond such specious concepts of equality to determine whether a person is being deprived of his lawful rights because of his race. Rather, a disparate impact inquiry requires us to ask whether minorities are disproportionately <i>affected</i> by the redevelopment plan. Thus the Residents can establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of disparate impact by showing that minorities are disproportionately burdened by the redevelopment plan or that the redevelopment plan \"[falls] more harshly\" on minorities. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*384</span> <i>Doe v.

Under our precedent, a plaintiff may establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination by demonstrating that the policy disproportionately affects or impacts one <i>group</i> more than anotherfacially disparate treatment need not be shown. For instance, in <i>Rizzo,</i> the waiting list for public housing comprised 85% African-Americans and 95% minorities, meaning that 5% were White. 564 F.2d at 142. The White residents on the list were treated the same as the minority residents on the listeach was hurt by Philadelphia's decision to block a public housing projectbut we nevertheless found a violation of the FHA because cancelling the project had a \"racially disproportionate effect\" on African-Americans. <i>Id.</i> at 149 (\"Nor can there be any doubt that the impact of the governmental defendants' termination of the project was felt primarily by blacks, who make up a substantial <i>proportion</i> of those who would be eligible to reside there.\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Township may be correct that a disparate impact analysis will often allow <span class=\"star-pagination\">*385</span> plaintiffs to make out a <i>prima facie</i> case when a segregated neighborhood is redeveloped in circumstances where there is a shortage of alternative affordable housing. But this is a feature of the FHA's programming, not a bug. The FHA is a broadly remedial statute designed to prevent and remedy invidious discrimination on the basis of race, <i>see </i><i>Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110654\"><a href=\"/opinion/110654/havens-realty-corp-v-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span>, 380, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110654\"><a href=\"/opinion/110654/havens-realty-corp-v-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span> (1982), that facilitates its antidiscrimination agenda by encouraging a searching inquiry into the motives behind a contested policy to ensure that it is not improper. <i>See</i> Christine Jolls, <i>Antidiscrimination and Accommodation,</i> 115 Harv. L. Rev. 642, 652 (2001) (remarking that a \"leading gloss\" on the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108284\"><a href=\"/opinion/108284/griggs-v-duke-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108284\"><a href=\"/opinion/108284/griggs-v-duke-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span> (1971), is that \"disparate impact functions as a means of smoking out subtle or underlying forms of intentional discrimination on the basis of group membership.\"). We need not be concerned that this approach is too expansive because the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case, by itself, is not enough to establish liability under the FHA. It simply results in a more searching inquiry into the defendant's motivationsprecisely the sort of inquiry required to ensure that the government does not deprive people of housing \"because of race.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, the Township seems to argue that its redevelopment plan does not violate Title VIII unless the statistics show that it increases segregation in the Township. (Twp. Br. at 18.). Showing that a policy has a segregative effect is one way to establish a violation of Title VIII, but it is not the only way. <i>See </i><i>Huntington Branch,</i> 844 F.2d at 937 (observing that a policy often discriminates in one of two ways: having a disparate impact or perpetuating segregation). The Township is free to argue that its plan is less discriminatory than all of the available alternatives because it does the best job of integrating the neighborhood. However, those arguments are properly considered in the context of the last steps of the Title VIII analysis, not as a requirement of the <i>prima facie</i> case.</p>\n<p>In reality, the District Court's decision was based on a valid and practical concern, which appears to drive its reasoning throughout the opinion. It feared that finding a disparate impact here would render the Township powerless to rehabilitate its blighted neighborhoods. This underlying rationale distorts the focus and analysis of disparate impact cases under the FHA. In disparate impact cases, \"[e]ffect, not motivation, is the touchstone because a thoughtless housing practice can be as unfair to minority rights as a willful scheme.\" <i>Smith v. Anchor Bldg. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"335994\"><a href=\"/opinion/335994/brenda-smith-v-anchor-building-corporation-a-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 233 (8th Cir.1976). Once the Residents established a <i>prima facie</i> case of disparate impact, the District Court's inquiry must continue to determine whether a person is being deprived of his lawful rights because of his race. It must ask whether that Township's legitimate objectives could have been achieved in a less discriminatory way.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Once the plaintiffs establish a <i>prima facie</i> case, the defendants must offer a legitimate reason for their actions. In this case, everyone agrees that alleviating blight is a legitimate interest. The core of the dispute between the parties is over the next step of the FHA's burden-shifting analysis: whether the defendants have shown that there is no less discriminatory alternative. <i>Rizzo,</i> 564 F.2d at 149. Only when the defendants make this showing does the burden shift back to the plaintiffswhere it ultimately remainsto provide evidence of such an alternative. <i>Id.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*386</span> at 149 n. 37. The test for whether there is no alternative is \"similar to the test of whether the defendant has demonstrated that the requested accommodation is `unreasonable' for the purposes of rebutting a claim under § 3604(f)(3)(B).\" <i>Lapid-Laurel,</i> 284 F.3d at 468. Section 2604(f)(3)(B) of the FHA requires that reasonable housing accommodations be made for individuals with disabilities. In other words, the defendant must show that the alternatives impose an undue hardship under the circumstances of this specific case. <i>See </i><i>U.S. Airways v. Barnett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118500\"><a href=\"/opinion/118500/us-airways-inc-v-barnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, 401-02, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118500\"><a href=\"/opinion/118500/us-airways-inc-v-barnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span> (2002) (discussing the term \"unreasonable accommodation\" under the Americans with Disabilities Act).</p>\n<p>The District Court characterized the Residents' proposed alternative as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[E]ffectively, plaintiffs are seeking to remain living in the blighted and unsafe conditions until they are awarded money damages for their claims and sufficient compensation to secure housing in the local housing market. Although couched at times like an effort to have the development go up around them, like a highway built around a protected tree, or to have their units rehabilitated, this makes little if no practical sense after years of litigation, approved redevelopment plans, and the expenditure of significant public resources. At this late stage, the only real practical remedy is for plaintiffs to receive the fair value for their home as well as proper and non-discriminatory relocation procedures and benefits. . . . The relief they are seeking is inconsistent with proving the fourth element of their FHA claim-namely, that an alternative course of action to eminent domain and relocation is viable.</blockquote>\n<p>(JA 17 n.12) (ellipsis in original).</p>\n<p>The Residents' evidence is susceptible to more favorable inferences. The Residents are not asking for permission to continue to live in \"blighted and unsafe\" conditions. Instead, they argue that there is a feasible plan that meets the Township's goals and entails more substantial rehabilitation. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Residents, one could credit the report of the Residents' planning expert, which stated that the \"blighted and unsafe\" conditions could be remedied in a far less heavy-handed manner that would not entail the wholesale destruction and rebuilding of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The Residents' expert pointed out that, although the Revised West Rancocas Plan called for development in stages, the Township began the development by aggressively acquiring houses, which it left vacant and then destroyed. He opined that a more gradual redevelopment plan would have allowed existing residents to move elsewhere in the neighborhood during one part of the redevelopment, and then move back once the redevelopment was completed. The Residents' expert further noted that the Township had not performed a comparative cost analysis showing that total demolition, relocation, and new construction was less feasible than an alternative focused on rehabilitation. Indeed, the expert went on to propose an alternative redevelopment plan that would rely on the targeted acquisition and rehabilitation of some of the existing Gardens homes, the combination of some houses to make larger homes, an initiative to make the houses more attractive through the use of landscaping and added amenities such as decks and porches, and selective demolition and new construction, including the construction of more affordable units. The Residents' expert also provided examples of previous alternativesincluding one developed as early as 1989to show that the complete demolition of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*387</span> the neighborhood was not the only possible solution to blight in the Gardens.<sup>[9]</sup> Finally, he provided a non-exhaustive list of state and federal funding programs that would support such a redevelopment plan and observed that the Township had failed to make an active effort to locate a developer with experience in neighborhood rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>The Township provided the contrasting statements of its Township manager, who argued that a rehabilitation program was not economically feasible. In support, she cited the fact that one alternative, the Mt. Holly 2000 program, demonstrated that rehabilitation of each unit would be extremely costly. She also challenged the availability of sources of funding for a rehabilitation. Lastly, she emphasized the many problems that led the Township to declare the Gardens an area in need of redevelopment and asserted the belief of the Township Council and its planning board that demolition and replacement is the most effective and efficient approach to solving the neighborhood's problems.</p>\n<p>These contrasting statements, as well as the parties' continued arguments on appeal as to the cost and feasibility of an alternative relying on rehabilitation, create genuine issues of material fact that require further investigation. Once the record on alternatives has been more fully developed, the District Court may entertain renewed motions for summary judgment, taking into account the Township's initial burden of showing that there are no less discriminatory alternatives, as well as the standard advanced in <i>Lapid-Laurel</i> for ultimately determining whether an alternative is unreasonable.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The Residents are also seeking to recover under the theory that the Township intentionally discriminated against its minority residents when it adopted the redevelopment plan. The District Court saw no evidence of intentional discrimination and granted the Township's motion for summary judgment. After carefully considering the matter, we discern no error in the District Court's decision and will thus affirm that ruling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>The Township has broad discretion to implement the policies it believes will improve its residents' quality of life. But that discretion is bounded by laws like the FHA and by the Constitution, which prevent policies that discriminate on the basis of race. For this reason, \"the federal courts must stand prepared to provide `such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose.'\" <i>Rizzo,</i> 564 F.2d at 149 (quoting <i>J.I. Case Co. v. Borak,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106845\"><a href=\"/opinion/106845/ji-case-co-v-borak/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 433, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106845\"><a href=\"/opinion/106845/ji-case-co-v-borak/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span> (1964)). A more developed factual record will assist the District Court in crafting appropriate remedies, if necessary. For all of the foregoing reasons, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*388</span> District Court's order granting summary judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Because this is an appeal from a motion granting summary judgment, we examine the record evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving parties, here the Residents, while resolving all reasonable inferences in their favor. <i>Wishkin v. Potter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796750\"><a href=\"/opinion/796750/richard-m-wishkin-v-john-e-potter-postmaster-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>, 184 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[2]  The record inconsistently describes the number of homes as 327 or 329. (JA 61, 776, 1114).</p>\n<p>[3]  The parties dispute the utility of data from the 2000 census. However, none of the parties has briefed or even asked the question of <i>when</i> precisely the violations at issue in this case began. This issue is important because the redevelopment process began in 2002 and, as a result, the demographics of the township have changed. Disputes over which census numbers to use thus create a moving target; however, the 2000 census data appears to provide the most accurate demographic data at the inception of the redevelopment process.</p>\n<p>[4]  This is an approximate number provided by the Residents' expert. Elsewhere in the record, the neighborhood is described as home to 1,605 people. (JA 1114).</p>\n<p>[5]  One home sold for $64,000 and another sold for $81,000.</p>\n<p>[6]  42 U.S.C. § 1982 provides that \"[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides in pertinent part that \"[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  The Department of Justice filed an <i>amicus curiae</i> brief agreeing that the District Court erred in its disparate impact <i>prima facie</i> case analysis.</p>\n<p>[9]  The 1989 plan was not provided as <i>the</i> alternative but only to show that less discriminatory alternatives had been considered in the past and could serve as the basis for an updated approach that would lessen the redevelopment's impact on minority residents of the Township.</p>\n<p>[10]  Triad asserts that the portion of the District Court's order relating to its involvement should be affirmed because the Residents, on appeal, have waived their claims against it. We disagree. In their brief, the Residents argue that the redevelopers, which include Triad, provided inadequate relocation assistance, allowed residents to be improperly pressured to leave, and that the redevelopment plan essentially pushes minority residents out of Mount Holly. For all of the reasons stated in this opinion, these are genuine issues of material fact that must be resolved through further discovery on remand.</p>\n\n</div>",
