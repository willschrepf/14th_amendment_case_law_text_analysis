Sessums entered a plea of “true” to the enhancement paragraph, after\n\nwhich the jury, having heard additional evidence, set his punishment at eight years in prison.\n\n         On appeal, Sessums complains that there was insufficient evidence to support his\n\nconviction and that the trial court erred (for multiple reasons) in allowing the introduction of a\n\nreport from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) during the punishment phase of\n\nthe trial. We find that the evidence was sufficient to support Sessums’ conviction and that the\n\ntrial court did not err in admitting the report. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt.\n\nI.       Background\n\n         On a blustery, late-August afternoon, Chief David Short and Officer Dustin Jule of the\n\nBogata, Texas Police Department responded to a suspicious persons report on Main Street in\n\nBogata. Upon arriving at the scene, they encountered Sessums and Chris Abbs in a bar ditch by\n\nthe road. Due to some recent break-ins in the area, the officers considered their presence to raise\n\nsome suspicions regarding them. While Jule was speaking with Abbs, Short observed Sessums\n\ncrossing the street, away from them. Short requested that Sessums stop and wait for Jule to talk\n\nwith him. Sessums complied with the request, and he began conversing with Short. After first\n\nobtaining permission, Short conducted a pat-down search of Sessums and, while doing so, found\n\na screwdriver in one of his front pockets. Upon seeing the screwdriver, Jule started across the\n\n                                                2\n\fstreet to assist Short because, they explained that a screwdriver can sometimes be used as a\n\nweapon. As Short continued the pat-down search, he felt an unidentified mass in the other front\n\npocket and asked Sessums to empty his other pocket. Although Sessums initially hesitated, he\n\nremoved a cellophane bag containing what the officers believed to be marihuana.\n\n       As Sessums removed the cellophane bag from his pocket, he backed away from the\n\nofficers and began ripping the bag apart. Due to the strong wind, the contents of the bag and the\n\nremnants of the bag itself blew down the street in people’s yards and anywhere the wind carried\n\nit. Sessums testified that although he requested the initial pat-down search to better insure the\n\nofficers’ safety, as soon as Sessums removed the bag and the officers saw what they believed to\n\nbe marihuana inside it, a narcotics investigation began.\n\n       The officers grabbed both of Sessums’ arms in an attempt to prevent him from destroying\n\nevidence, handcuffed him, and placed him in the patrol car. When asked by Short why he had\n\nripped up the bag, Sessums responded, “I guess I was just trying to f*** with you, Chief.” The\n\nofficers then recovered a small remnant of the bag and a bit of the contents. Both Short and Jule\n\ntestified that based on their training and experience and observing the appearance and smell of\n\nthe contents that were recovered, it was their opinion that the bag had contained marihuana.\n\nII.    Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n       In his third point of error, Sessums contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to\n\nsupport the guilty verdict.\n\n       In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we review all the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the trier of fact’s verdict to determine whether any rational jury could have\n                                                 3\n\ffound the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Brooks v. State, 323\n\nS.W.3d 893, 912 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979));\n\nHartsfield v. State, 305 S.W.3d 859, 863 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2010, pet. ref’d) (citing\n\nClayton v. State, 235 S.W.3d 772, 778 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). We examine legal sufficiency\n\nunder the direction of the Brooks opinion, while giving deference to the responsibility of the trier\n\nof fact “to fairly resolve conflicts in testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable\n\ninferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.” Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 13 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2007) (citing Jackson, 443 U.S. at 318–19).\n\n       Legal sufficiency of the evidence is measured by the elements of the offense as defined\n\nby a measure the courts call a “hypothetically correct jury charge.” Malik v. State, 953 S.W.2d\n\n234, 240 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). The hypothetically correct jury charge “sets out the law, is\n\nauthorized by the indictment, does not unnecessarily increase the State’s burden of proof or\n\nunnecessarily restrict the State’s theories of liability, and adequately describes the particular\n\noffense for which the defendant was tried.” Id.\n\n       Here, Sessums was convicted of attempted tampering with physical evidence. A person\n\ncommits the offense of tampering with physical evidence if he (1) although knowing that an\n\ninvestigation or official proceeding is pending or in progress, (2) alters, destroys, or conceals any\n\nrecord, document, or thing (3) with the intent to impair its verity, legibility, or availability as\n\nevidence in the investigation or official proceeding. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 37.09(a)(1) (West\n\nSupp. 2014). A person commits an attempt if he (1) with specific intent to commit an offense,\n\n(2) did an act amounting to more than mere preparation that tends but fails to effect the\n                                         4\n\fcommission of the offense. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 15.01(a) (West 2011). In order to convict\n\nSessums of the crime with which he was charged, the State was required to prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Sessums took actions (which were more than mere preparation) by which\n\nhe specifically intended to achieve the offense of tampering with physical evidence but failed to\n\naccomplish the intended act. On appeal, Sessums challenges only the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nto support that he knew that an investigation was pending or in progress at the time he attempted\n\nto destroy evidence. 1\n\n        Sessums argues that the investigation began only after Sessums removed the cellophane\n\nbag from his pocket, relying principally on the officers’ testimony that a “narcotics\n\ninvestigation” began when that action occurred.                 His argument emphasizes the officers’\n\ntestimony that when they first saw Sessums, he was not doing anything illegal and that the pat-\n\ndown search (resulting in the removal of the screwdriver) was permissive, not done at the order\n\nof Short. Sessums reasons that since he was only voluntarily complying with the requests of\n\nShort, no investigation was in progress until he removed the cellophane bag. Further, Sessums\n\nreasons that since the “narcotics investigation” began only when he removed the bag (whereupon\n\nhe immediately shredded it), it would have been impossible for him to have known that an\n\ninvestigation had commenced in the instant before he began shredding the bag.\n\n        Sessums urges us to follow the reasoning of our sister court as expressed in Pannell v.\n\nState, 7 S.W.3d 222 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1999, pet. ref’d). In Pannell, the officer testified that he\n\n\n1\n Sessums frames this issue as follows: “The issue presented here is whether Sessums knew that an investigation was\npending or in progress at the time he attempted to alter or destroy the evidence.”\n                                                        5\n\fhad turned on his lights to pull Pannell over for speeding in a school zone. Before pulling over,\n\nPannell stuck his hand out of the window and emptied the contents of a plastic bag. When the\n\nofficer approached the vehicle after it stopped, he smelled a strong odor of marihuana. Id. at\n\n223. Pannell was convicted of tampering with evidence. The Dallas Court of Appeals reversed\n\nPannell’s conviction, reasoning that the investigation began as a speeding violation and only\n\nprogressed to a controlled substance investigation after the officer saw Pannell empty the\n\ncontents of the bag. In that situation, the court held that Pannell could not have known a\n\ncontrolled substance investigation was pending or in progress at the time he destroyed or altered\n\nthe marihuana. Id. at 224.\n\n       However, as Sessums acknowledges in his brief, the reasoning of Pannell has been\n\ncriticized by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Williams v. State, 270 S.W.3d 140, 143–44\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2008). In Williams, an officer approached a car parked on the wrong side of\n\nthe street in front of what was characterized as a known crack house. The peace officer saw\n\nWilliams moving his hands around his waistband and suspected from that conduct that he might\n\nhave a weapon. As the officer was performing a pat-down search, he heard an object hit the\n\nground. When he looked, the officer recognized the object that he had heard fall as a crack pipe,\n\nthis being only just before Williams stomped on the object and shattered it. Id. at 141–42.\n\nWilliams’ indictment alleged that he, “‘knowing that an investigation was in progress, to-wit:\n\nchecking [Williams] for weapons, [Williams] intentionally and knowingly destroy[ed] drug\n\nparaphernalia, to-wit: a crack pipe, with intent to impair its verity and availability as evidence in\n\nthe investigation.’” Id. at 143.\n                                                 6\n\f       On appeal, Williams challenged the sufficiency of the evidence that he had knowledge of\n\nthe existence of an investigation in which the crack pipe would be evidence when he stomped on\n\nit since the investigation that was alleged in the indictment was a weapons investigation. The\n\nintermediate court of appeals, while accepting the reasoning in Pannell, upheld Williams’\n\nconviction nonetheless, reasoning that the thrust of the investigation had turned into a narcotics\n\ninvestigation when the pipe dropped to the ground. Id. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\n\naffirmed the judgment of the court of appeals, but not its reasoning, holding that the statute only\n\nrequires that the defendant know that an investigation is in progress or pending and that he has\n\nthe intent to destroy evidence.     It neither requires that the defendant know what kind of\n\ninvestigation is in progress nor that he “will have evaluated and correctly assessed a thing’s\n\nevidentiary status upon its destruction.” Id. at 144. Rather, the statute reflects the investigatory\n\nreality and envisions a defendant “who intends for, but is not necessarily aware of, the\n\nimpairment of something’s role as evidence in the investigation.” Id. In other words, all that is\n\nrequired to satisfy that prong of the attempt law is that the defendant knows that an investigation\n\nis in progress and that he intends to impair the use of evidence in the investigation. The title of\n\nthe investigation in an indictment and the evidence destroyed need not match “as long as the\n\n[defendant] destroyed a thing with the intent to impair its availability as evidence in an\n\ninvestigation that he knows is in progress.” Id. at 145.\n\n       In this case, we find there is sufficient evidence in the record for a reasonable jury to have\n\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt that Sessums knew an investigation was progressing at the time\n\nhe shredded the plastic bag. Sessums complied with Short’s request to remain at the scene so\n                                                 7\n\fJule could talk with him. After a short time, Sessums was asked to submit to a pat-down search. 2\n\nThe pat-down search yielded a screwdriver, which both officers testified could sometimes be\n\nused as a weapon. After finding the screwdriver, Chief Short continued the pat-down search and\n\nfelt a large mass in another pocket. At about the same time, Jule crossed the street to assist\n\nShort. Upon noticing this mass, Short then asked Sessums to remove the contents of his pocket.\n\nIt was only after Sessums had complied with four successively more intrusive requests by Short\n\n(each of which revealed information that led successively to the next request), that Sessums\n\nbegan to shred the baggie.\n\n        From this evidence, we find that a reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Sessums knew an investigation was progressing at the time that he attempted to destroy or\n\nalter the evidence. Therefore, we overrule this point of error.\n\nIII.    The TDJC Report\n\n        In his first and second points of error, Sessums alleges that the trial court erred in\n\nadmitting a report during the punishment phase that had been sent by the TDCJ to the Bogata\n\nPolice Department indicating that Sessums was a member of the Aryan Circle gang. In his first\n\npoint of error, Sessums complains that the admission of the report violated his right to confront\n\nwitnesses under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and his right to free\n\nassociation under the Constitution’s First Amendment as both of these are applied to the states\n\nby the Fourteenth Amendment. See U.S. CONST. amends. I, VI, XIV. In his second point of\n\n\n2\n Sessums neither challenges the validity of the initial stop and investigative detention by the officers nor the pat\ndown by Short. Rather, Sessums acknowledges his cooperation with Short’s requests.\n                                                         8\n\ferror, Sessums complains that the trial court erred in admitting the TDCJ report (admitted as\n\nState’s Exhibit 7) 3 since it did not fall within the business records exception to the hearsay\n\nexclusionary rule.\n\n            A.       Was State’s Exhibit 7 Admissible Under a Hearsay Exception?\n\n            “We review a trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.”\n\nLund v. State, 366 S.W.3d 848, 852 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2012, pet. ref’d) (citing Osbourn v.\n\nState, 92 S.W.3d 531, 537 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002)). If the trial court’s decision is within the\n\nzone of reasonable disagreement, it has not abused its discretion, and we defer to that decision.\n\nId. (citing Powell v. State, 63 S.W.3d 435, 438 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001)).\n\n            Sessums objected at trial to Exhibit 7, asserting it did not satisfy the business records\n\nexception to the hearsay rule exclusion. Further, both Sessums and the State in their briefs\n\naddress only whether the document was admissible as a business record. However, it is not clear\n\nfrom the record whether the trial court admitted the document as a business record under Rule\n\n803(6) or as a public record under Rule 803(8)(B). See TEX. R. EVID. 803(6), (8)(B). 4 If the\n\ndocument met either of these hearsay exceptions, then the court did not err in admitting it. 5\n\n\n\n\n3\n    Hereafter referred to as Exhibit 7.\n4\n Although the State formally offered the document as a business record, it both posited a basis to the trial court in a\nhearing without the jury and later laid a testimonial predicate that would qualify the document to be admitted as a\npublic report under Rule 803(8)(B).\n5\n The record indicates that the document was admitted after the hearing, without the jury, and before any testimonial\npredicate was laid. Any error in this regard was harmless, however, since the State subsequently elicited the\nnecessary predicate testimony before the exhibit was discussed or published to the jury. In addition, it was\npublished to the jury without objection.\n                                                          9\n\f        Rule 803(8)(B) provides that the following are not excluded by the hearsay rule:\n\n               (8)     Public Records and Reports. Records, reports, statements, or\n        data compilation, in any form, of public offices or agencies setting forth:\n\n                          ....\n\n                        (B)       matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to\n                 which matters there was a duty to report, excluding in criminal cases\n                 matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement\n                 personnel; . . .\n\n                          ....\n\n                 unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of\n                 trustworthiness.\n\nTEX. R. EVID. 803(8)(B).\n\n        The Texas Government Code, among other things, places the following duty on the\n\nTDCJ:\n\n               (a)     On the release of an inmate determined by the department to be a\n        member of a security threat group, the department shall notify the sheriff of the\n        county to which the inmate is released and, if the inmate is released to a\n        municipality, the chief of police for that municipality. The notice must state the\n        date on which the inmate was released and state that the inmate has been\n        determined by the department to be a member of a security threat group. The\n        notice must be provided by e-mail or other electronic communication.\n\nTEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 499.051(a) (West 2012).\n\n        Short testified that Exhibit 7 had been sent to his office by the TDCJ pursuant to its duty\n\nunder Section 499.051. 6 Therefore, the document was admissible under Rule 803(8)(B) unless it\n\n\n6\n The first page of the report is on TDCJ letterhead and sets forth information required by Section 499.051. There\nare two additional pages that provide details regarding the Aryan Circle gang. It is unclear whether these pages\nwere also sent by the TDCJ. Sessums claims in his brief to this Court that the pages originate from a private website\n                                                        10\n\ffalls under the exclusion of matters observed by police officers or other law enforcement\n\npersonnel that are subject to the hearsay rule. See Brewer v. State, No. 06-11-00164-CR, 2012\n\nWL 626275, at *1 (Tex. App.—Texarkana Feb. 28, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for\n\npublication). 7 We must determine whether the document reflects matters observed by law\n\nenforcement personnel and, if so, whether it is nevertheless admissible because it was in the\n\nnature of a ministerial act. Id. at *2; Pondexter v. State, 942 S.W.2d 577, 585 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1996).\n\n                 1.       Observation by Law Enforcement Personnel\n\n         On its face, the document purports to be sent from the TDCJ executive director (or on his\n\nbehalf) to “Law Enforcement of BOGATA.” This kind of notice is generated by the TDCJ upon\n\nthe release of an inmate under its control when that inmate has been determined by the TDJC to\n\nbe a member of a “security threat group,” and it is an official notice of the TDCJ. In addition, it\n\nis sent to local law enforcement offices. There is little question that the document contains the\n\nobservations of law enforcement personnel.\n\n                 2.       Nature of the Document\n\n         Reports made by police officers and others investigating a crime have been held to be\n\nclearly outside the admissibility exception of Rule 803(8). See, e.g., Cole v. State, 839 S.W.2d\n\n798 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990). However, even though a document contains observations by law\n\n\nunrelated to TDCJ. However, at trial Sessums objected to the entire document, but did not make a specific objection\nto the last two pages or request that they be excluded.\n7\n Although this unpublished case has no precedential value, we may take guidance from it “as an aid in developing\nreasoning that may be employed.” Carrillo v. State, 98 S.W.3d 789, 794 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2003, pet. ref’d).\n                                                        11\n\fenforcement personnel, it may nevertheless be admissible if it was “prepared in a nonadversarial\n\nsetting, [is] unrelated to any specific litigation, and . . . record[s] objective, neutral observations.”\n\nBrewer, 2012 WL 626275, at *2.            Initially, we determine whether the document contains\n\nobjective determinations of a factual nature prepared by personnel with no inherent motivation to\n\ndistort the results. See Garcia v. State, 868 S.W.2d 337, 341 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993). The bulk\n\nof the first page of the report is boilerplate language, but the remainder contains objective facts,\n\nsuch as Sessums’ name, date of birth, TDCJ and State Identification (SID) numbers, release date,\n\nand an identification of the gang to which he is reported to belong. There is nothing of a\n\nsubjective nature in the report that would indicate any inherent motive to distort the facts. See id.\n\nAs such, this is clearly objective in nature and merely recites an objective determination made by\n\nthe TDCJ.\n\n        Documents of this nature have been held to be admissible as both public records and\n\nbusiness records. Segundo v. Texas, 270 S.W.3d 79, 106–07 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (op. on\n\nreh’g). In Segundo, parole revocation documents were admitted at the punishment stage of trial.\n\nThe documents contained statements that Segundo “‘subsequently failed to fulfill the terms and\n\nconditions of said release, and is therefore not worthy of the trust and confidence placed\n\ntherein,’” that he “‘has violated the conditions of administrative release,’” and that he was an\n\n“‘administrative release violator.’” Id. at 106. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that\n\nsuch statements were “boilerplate” and admissible “both as public records and as business\n\nrecords.” Id. at 106–07 (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                                   12\n\f       We then consider the adversarial context in which the document was prepared. Garcia,\n\n868 S.W.2d at 342. Here, the determination of gang membership was made pursuant to a\n\nstatutorily imposed duty; consequently, it constitutes part of the ordinary duties of TDCJ\n\npersonnel. In addition, it was made at a time when a prosecution was neither pending nor\n\ncontemplated. Thus, it has none of the features of a subjective incident report made by law\n\nenforcement personnel or other persons conducting a factual investigation for use in a criminal\n\nproceeding. Segundo, 270 S.W.3d at 106–07.\n\n       Therefore, we find that the first page of Exhibit 7 was unquestionably admissible as a\n\npublic record under Rule 803(8)(B). As previously noted, it is unclear whether the remaining\n\ntwo pages of Exhibit 7 also originated from the TDCJ. However, even should we assume that\n\nthey were not admissible under that exception to the hearsay rule, we review the trial court’s\n\ndecision to admit evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. Lund, 366 S.W.3d at 852.\n\nWhen an exhibit contains both admissible and inadmissible evidence, the burden is on the\n\nobjecting party to specifically point out which portion of the proffered evidence is inadmissible.\n\nWhitaker v. State, 286 S.W.3d 355, 369 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009); Reyes v. State, 314 S.W.3d 74,\n\n78 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2010, no pet.). A trial court does not abuse its discretion when it\n\nadmits an exhibit in its entirety if the objecting party fails to segregate the admissible portion\n\nfrom that which is inadmissible. Whitaker, 286 S.W.3d at 369. As previously noted, Sessums\n\nobjected to the entire document and did not limit his request to exclude only the last two pages.\n\nBecause the first page is admissible, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the\n\nentire TDCJ document as evidence.\n                                                13\n\f       Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Exhibit 7\n\nunder Rule 803(8)(B) and overrule this point of error.\n\n       B.      Did Admitting Exhibit 7 Violate the Confrontation Clause?\n\n       Since we have found that Exhibit 7 was admissible under Rule 803(8)(B), we must\n\nconsider whether its admission violated Sessums’ right to confrontation under the United States\n\nConstitutions’ Sixth Amendment, his first point of error.\n\n       The Sixth Amendment provides that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have\n\nthe right to be confronted by the witnesses against him. U.S. CONST. amend. VI. The United\n\nStates Supreme Court has held that this right applies to both in-court testimony and to out-of-\n\ncourt statements that are testimonial in nature. See, e.g., Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36\n\n(2004). Whether a particular out-of-court statement is testimonial is a question of law. De La\n\nPaz v. State, 273 S.W.3d 671, 680 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008).\n\n       Sessums argues that in considering this point of error, we should perform an analysis of\n\nthe evidence to examine whether it bears “particularized guarantees of trustworthiness” to make\n\nit sufficiently reliable to satisfy the Confrontation Clause. Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66\n\n(1980). However, under Roberts, that analysis is only appropriate if we do not find the evidence\n\nadmissible under a firmly rooted hearsay exception that “‘carr[ies] special guarantees of\n\ncredibility’ essentially equivalent to, or greater than, those produced by the Constitution’s\n\npreference for cross-examined trial testimony.” Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U.S. 116, 126 (1999)\n\n(quoting White v. State, 502 U.S. 346, 356 (1992)). In this case, we have found that Exhibit 7\n\nwas admissible as a public record or report.\n                                               14\n\f           Business and public records are generally admissible without confrontation “because—\n\nhaving been created for the administration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of\n\nestablishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not testimonial.”                        Melendez–Diaz v.\n\nMassachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 324 (2009).                   However, a business or public record may\n\nnevertheless be inadmissible if it is prepared for prosecutorial use or in anticipation that it will be\n\nused for prosecutorial purposes.            In that case, the business or public record is considered\n\ntestimonial and subject to a Confrontation Clause challenge.                    Id.   It is the “intended or\n\nanticipated use of a statement that determines whether the statement is testimonial.” Grey v.\n\nState, 299 S.W.3d 902, 909 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, pet ref’d) (citing Davis v. Washington,\n\n547 U.S. 813 (2006)).\n\n           In Grey, the appellant contended his confrontation rights were violated at the punishment\n\nstage when the trial court admitted his “pen pack” 8 that contained a history prepared by an\n\nunnamed department of corrections employee when he was admitted into prison in 1990.\n\nIncluded in the history was a summary of fifteen to nineteen prior arrests, adjudications,\n\nconvictions, and probation revocations. Appellant contended that this history was testimonial\n\nand that its admission violated the United States Constitution’s Confrontation Clause. Grey, 299\n\nS.W.3d at 906. After discussing the United States Supreme Court’s cases setting forth the test of\n\nwhat is testimonial for confrontation law purposes, the Austin Court of Appeals held the\n\nsummary was admissible since it was clearly not prepared for prosecutorial use but, rather, for\n\ninternal department purposes. Id. at 910; see also Segundo, 270 S.W.3d at 106–07 (holding\n\n8\n    Also called “pen packet.” See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 42.09 (West Supp. 2014).\n                                                        15\n\fstatements in revocation documents regarding defendant’s prior violations of terms and\n\nconditions of release were “nontestimonial” and not violative of Confrontation Clause).\n\n        As in Grey, Exhibit 7 was clearly not prepared for prosecutorial use. On its face, the\n\ndocument shows that it was prepared by the TDCJ May 2, 2011, over two years before Sessums\n\nwas arrested. As we have discussed, it was prepared and sent pursuant to a statutory duty to be\n\nused by the Bogata Police Department as it saw fit. Thus, we conclude that Exhibit 7 was not\n\ntestimonial and that its admission did not violate Sessums’ right to confrontation. We overrule\n\nthis point of error.\n\n        C.      Free Association Error Not Preserved\n\n        Sessums also complains for the first time on appeal that admitting the second and third\n\npages of Exhibit 7 violated his right to free association, relying on Dawson v. Delaware, 503\n\nU.S. 159 (1992). In Dawson, the United States Supreme Court held that it is a violation of a\n\ndefendant’s right of free association to admit evidence of gang membership and evidence of a\n\ngang’s beliefs and propensity to violence when it is not relevant to the crime being prosecuted.\n\nId. at 166–67. However, as pointed out by the court in Dawson, the defendant in that case\n\nconsistently objected to the admission of the evidence on the ground that it violated his right of\n\nfree association under the First Amendment. Id. at 162; Dawson v. State, 581 A.2d 1078, 1100\n\n(Del. 1990). That argument at trial is contrasted with what occurred in this case; here, although\n\nhe objected at trial on both hearsay and confrontation grounds, Sessums failed to object on free\n\nassociation grounds.\n\n\n                                               16\n\f       The purpose of requiring an objection at trial is to allow the trial court or opposing\n\ncounsel to either correct any error or remove the offending documents. Reyna v. State, 168\n\nS.W.3d 173, 179 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). Further, an objection on hearsay will not preserve an\n\nerror on free association grounds. Cf. Paredes v. State, 129 S.W.3d 530, 536 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2004). By failing to object to a free association violation, Sessums failed to preserve the issue.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1. We overrule this point of error.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                             Bailey C.

Sessums entered a plea of “true” to the enhancement paragraph, after\n\nwhich the jury, having heard additional evidence, set his punishment at eight years in prison.\n\n         On appeal, Sessums complains that there was insufficient evidence to support his\n\nconviction and that the trial court erred (for multiple reasons) in allowing the introduction of a\n\nreport from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) during the punishment phase of\n\nthe trial. We find that the evidence was sufficient to support Sessums’ conviction and that the\n\ntrial court did not err in admitting the report. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt.\n\nI.       Background\n\n         On a blustery, late-August afternoon, Chief David Short and Officer Dustin Jule of the\n\nBogata, Texas Police Department responded to a suspicious persons report on Main Street in\n\nBogata. Upon arriving at the scene, they encountered Sessums and Chris Abbs in a bar ditch by\n\nthe road. Due to some recent break-ins in the area, the officers considered their presence to raise\n\nsome suspicions regarding them. While Jule was speaking with Abbs, Short observed Sessums\n\ncrossing the street, away from them. Short requested that Sessums stop and wait for Jule to talk\n\nwith him. Sessums complied with the request, and he began conversing with Short. After first\n\nobtaining permission, Short conducted a pat-down search of Sessums and, while doing so, found\n\na screwdriver in one of his front pockets. Upon seeing the screwdriver, Jule started across the\n\n                                                2\n\fstreet to assist Short because, they explained that a screwdriver can sometimes be used as a\n\nweapon. As Short continued the pat-down search, he felt an unidentified mass in the other front\n\npocket and asked Sessums to empty his other pocket. Although Sessums initially hesitated, he\n\nremoved a cellophane bag containing what the officers believed to be marihuana.\n\n       As Sessums removed the cellophane bag from his pocket, he backed away from the\n\nofficers and began ripping the bag apart. Due to the strong wind, the contents of the bag and the\n\nremnants of the bag itself blew down the street in people’s yards and anywhere the wind carried\n\nit. Sessums testified that although he requested the initial pat-down search to better insure the\n\nofficers’ safety, as soon as Sessums removed the bag and the officers saw what they believed to\n\nbe marihuana inside it, a narcotics investigation began.\n\n       The officers grabbed both of Sessums’ arms in an attempt to prevent him from destroying\n\nevidence, handcuffed him, and placed him in the patrol car. When asked by Short why he had\n\nripped up the bag, Sessums responded, “I guess I was just trying to f*** with you, Chief.” The\n\nofficers then recovered a small remnant of the bag and a bit of the contents. Both Short and Jule\n\ntestified that based on their training and experience and observing the appearance and smell of\n\nthe contents that were recovered, it was their opinion that the bag had contained marihuana.\n\nII.    Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n       In his third point of error, Sessums contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to\n\nsupport the guilty verdict.\n\n       In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we review all the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the trier of fact’s verdict to determine whether any rational jury could have\n                                                 3\n\ffound the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

We examine legal sufficiency\n\nunder the direction of the Brooks opinion, while giving deference to the responsibility of the trier\n\nof fact “to fairly resolve conflicts in testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable\n\ninferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.” Hooper v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1404060\"><a href=\"/opinion/1404060/hooper-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2007) (citing Jackson, 443 U.S. at 318–19).\n\n       Legal sufficiency of the evidence is measured by the elements of the offense as defined\n\nby a measure the courts call a “hypothetically correct jury charge.” Malik v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518899\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518899/malik-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). The hypothetically correct jury charge “sets out the law, is\n\nauthorized by the indictment, does not unnecessarily increase the State’s burden of proof or\n\nunnecessarily restrict the State’s theories of liability, and adequately describes the particular\n\noffense for which the defendant was tried.” Id.\n\n       Here, Sessums was convicted of attempted tampering with physical evidence. A person\n\ncommits the offense of tampering with physical evidence if he (1) although knowing that an\n\ninvestigation or official proceeding is pending or in progress, (2) alters, destroys, or conceals any\n\nrecord, document, or thing (3) with the intent to impair its verity, legibility, or availability as\n\nevidence in the investigation or official proceeding. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 37.09(a)(1) (West\n\nSupp. 2014). A person commits an attempt if he (1) with specific intent to commit an offense,\n\n(2) did an act amounting to more than mere preparation that tends but fails to effect the\n                                         4\n\fcommission of the offense. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 15.01(a) (West 2011). In order to convict\n\nSessums of the crime with which he was charged, the State was required to prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Sessums took actions (which were more than mere preparation) by which\n\nhe specifically intended to achieve the offense of tampering with physical evidence but failed to\n\naccomplish the intended act. On appeal, Sessums challenges only the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nto support that he knew that an investigation was pending or in progress at the time he attempted\n\nto destroy evidence. 1\n\n        Sessums argues that the investigation began only after Sessums removed the cellophane\n\nbag from his pocket, relying principally on the officers’ testimony that a “narcotics\n\ninvestigation” began when that action occurred.                 His argument emphasizes the officers’\n\ntestimony that when they first saw Sessums, he was not doing anything illegal and that the pat-\n\ndown search (resulting in the removal of the screwdriver) was permissive, not done at the order\n\nof Short. Sessums reasons that since he was only voluntarily complying with the requests of\n\nShort, no investigation was in progress until he removed the cellophane bag. Further, Sessums\n\nreasons that since the “narcotics investigation” began only when he removed the bag (whereupon\n\nhe immediately shredded it), it would have been impossible for him to have known that an\n\ninvestigation had commenced in the instant before he began shredding the bag.\n\n        Sessums urges us to follow the reasoning of our sister court as expressed in Pannell v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1870458\"><a href=\"/opinion/1870458/pannell-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Dallas 1999, pet. ref’d). In Pannell, the officer testified that he\n\n\n1\n Sessums frames this issue as follows: “The issue presented here is whether Sessums knew that an investigation was\npending or in progress at the time he attempted to alter or destroy the evidence.”\n                                                        5\n\fhad turned on his lights to pull Pannell over for speeding in a school zone. Before pulling over,\n\nPannell stuck his hand out of the window and emptied the contents of a plastic bag. When the\n\nofficer approached the vehicle after it stopped, he smelled a strong odor of marihuana. Id. at\n\n223. Pannell was convicted of tampering with evidence. The Dallas Court of Appeals reversed\n\nPannell’s conviction, reasoning that the investigation began as a speeding violation and only\n\nprogressed to a controlled substance investigation after the officer saw Pannell empty the\n\ncontents of the bag. In that situation, the court held that Pannell could not have known a\n\ncontrolled substance investigation was pending or in progress at the time he destroyed or altered\n\nthe marihuana. Id. at 224.\n\n       However, as Sessums acknowledges in his brief, the reasoning of Pannell has been\n\ncriticized by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Williams v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1590570\"><a href=\"/opinion/1590570/williams-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143–44\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2008). In Williams, an officer approached a car parked on the wrong side of\n\nthe street in front of what was characterized as a known crack house. The peace officer saw\n\nWilliams moving his hands around his waistband and suspected from that conduct that he might\n\nhave a weapon. As the officer was performing a pat-down search, he heard an object hit the\n\nground. When he looked, the officer recognized the object that he had heard fall as a crack pipe,\n\nthis being only just before Williams stomped on the object and shattered it. Id. at 141–42.\n\nWilliams’ indictment alleged that he, “‘knowing that an investigation was in progress, to-wit:\n\nchecking [Williams] for weapons, [Williams] intentionally and knowingly destroy[ed] drug\n\nparaphernalia, to-wit: a crack pipe, with intent to impair its verity and availability as evidence in\n\nthe investigation.’” Id. at 143.\n                                                 6\n\f       On appeal, Williams challenged the sufficiency of the evidence that he had knowledge of\n\nthe existence of an investigation in which the crack pipe would be evidence when he stomped on\n\nit since the investigation that was alleged in the indictment was a weapons investigation. The\n\nintermediate court of appeals, while accepting the reasoning in Pannell, upheld Williams’\n\nconviction nonetheless, reasoning that the thrust of the investigation had turned into a narcotics\n\ninvestigation when the pipe dropped to the ground. Id. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\n\naffirmed the judgment of the court of appeals, but not its reasoning, holding that the statute only\n\nrequires that the defendant know that an investigation is in progress or pending and that he has\n\nthe intent to destroy evidence.     It neither requires that the defendant know what kind of\n\ninvestigation is in progress nor that he “will have evaluated and correctly assessed a thing’s\n\nevidentiary status upon its destruction.” Id. at 144. Rather, the statute reflects the investigatory\n\nreality and envisions a defendant “who intends for, but is not necessarily aware of, the\n\nimpairment of something’s role as evidence in the investigation.” Id. In other words, all that is\n\nrequired to satisfy that prong of the attempt law is that the defendant knows that an investigation\n\nis in progress and that he intends to impair the use of evidence in the investigation. The title of\n\nthe investigation in an indictment and the evidence destroyed need not match “as long as the\n\n[defendant] destroyed a thing with the intent to impair its availability as evidence in an\n\ninvestigation that he knows is in progress.” Id. at 145.\n\n       In this case, we find there is sufficient evidence in the record for a reasonable jury to have\n\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt that Sessums knew an investigation was progressing at the time\n\nhe shredded the plastic bag. Sessums complied with Short’s request to remain at the scene so\n                                                 7\n\fJule could talk with him. After a short time, Sessums was asked to submit to a pat-down search. 2\n\nThe pat-down search yielded a screwdriver, which both officers testified could sometimes be\n\nused as a weapon. After finding the screwdriver, Chief Short continued the pat-down search and\n\nfelt a large mass in another pocket. At about the same time, Jule crossed the street to assist\n\nShort. Upon noticing this mass, Short then asked Sessums to remove the contents of his pocket.\n\nIt was only after Sessums had complied with four successively more intrusive requests by Short\n\n(each of which revealed information that led successively to the next request), that Sessums\n\nbegan to shred the baggie.\n\n        From this evidence, we find that a reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Sessums knew an investigation was progressing at the time that he attempted to destroy or\n\nalter the evidence. Therefore, we overrule this point of error.\n\nIII.    The TDJC Report\n\n        In his first and second points of error, Sessums alleges that the trial court erred in\n\nadmitting a report during the punishment phase that had been sent by the TDCJ to the Bogata\n\nPolice Department indicating that Sessums was a member of the Aryan Circle gang. In his first\n\npoint of error, Sessums complains that the admission of the report violated his right to confront\n\nwitnesses under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and his right to free\n\nassociation under the Constitution’s First Amendment as both of these are applied to the states\n\nby the Fourteenth Amendment. See U.S. CONST. amends. I, VI, XIV. In his second point of\n\n\n2\n Sessums neither challenges the validity of the initial stop and investigative detention by the officers nor the pat\ndown by Short. Rather, Sessums acknowledges his cooperation with Short’s requests.\n                                                         8\n\ferror, Sessums complains that the trial court erred in admitting the TDCJ report (admitted as\n\nState’s Exhibit 7) 3 since it did not fall within the business records exception to the hearsay\n\nexclusionary rule.\n\n            A.

Further, both Sessums and the State in their briefs\n\naddress only whether the document was admissible as a business record. However, it is not clear\n\nfrom the record whether the trial court admitted the document as a business record under Rule\n\n803(6) or as a public record under Rule 803(8)(B). See TEX. R.

Any error in this regard was harmless, however, since the State subsequently elicited the\nnecessary predicate testimony before the exhibit was discussed or published to the jury. In addition, it was\npublished to the jury without objection.\n                                                          9\n\f        Rule 803(8)(B) provides that the following are not excluded by the hearsay rule:\n\n               (8)     Public Records and Reports.

Observation by Law Enforcement Personnel\n\n         On its face, the document purports to be sent from the TDCJ executive director (or on his\n\nbehalf) to “Law Enforcement of BOGATA.” This kind of notice is generated by the TDCJ upon\n\nthe release of an inmate under its control when that inmate has been determined by the TDJC to\n\nbe a member of a “security threat group,” and it is an official notice of the TDCJ. In addition, it\n\nis sent to local law enforcement offices. There is little question that the document contains the\n\nobservations of law enforcement personnel.\n\n                 2.       Nature of the Document\n\n         Reports made by police officers and others investigating a crime have been held to be\n\nclearly outside the admissibility exception of Rule 803(8). See, e.g., Cole v.

However, at trial Sessums objected to the entire document, but did not make a specific objection\nto the last two pages or request that they be excluded.\n7\n Although this unpublished case has no precedential value, we may take guidance from it “as an aid in developing\nreasoning that may be employed.” Carrillo v.

Initially, we determine whether the document contains\n\nobjective determinations of a factual nature prepared by personnel with no inherent motivation to\n\ndistort the results. See Garcia v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1728786\"><a href=\"/opinion/1728786/garcia-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993). The bulk\n\nof the first page of the report is boilerplate language, but the remainder contains objective facts,\n\nsuch as Sessums’ name, date of birth, TDCJ and State Identification (SID) numbers, release date,\n\nand an identification of the gang to which he is reported to belong. There is nothing of a\n\nsubjective nature in the report that would indicate any inherent motive to distort the facts. See id.\n\nAs such, this is clearly objective in nature and merely recites an objective determination made by\n\nthe TDCJ.\n\n        Documents of this nature have been held to be admissible as both public records and\n\nbusiness records. Segundo v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1590541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1590541/segundo-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106–07 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (op. on\n\nreh’g). In Segundo, parole revocation documents were admitted at the punishment stage of trial.\n\nThe documents contained statements that Segundo “‘subsequently failed to fulfill the terms and\n\nconditions of said release, and is therefore not worthy of the trust and confidence placed\n\ntherein,’” that he “‘has violated the conditions of administrative release,’” and that he was an\n\n“‘administrative release violator.’” Id. at 106. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that\n\nsuch statements were “boilerplate” and admissible “both as public records and as business\n\nrecords.” Id. at 106–07 (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                                   12\n\f       We then consider the adversarial context in which the document was prepared. Garcia,\n\n868 S.W.2d at 342. Here, the determination of gang membership was made pursuant to a\n\nstatutorily imposed duty; consequently, it constitutes part of the ordinary duties of TDCJ\n\npersonnel. In addition, it was made at a time when a prosecution was neither pending nor\n\ncontemplated. Thus, it has none of the features of a subjective incident report made by law\n\nenforcement personnel or other persons conducting a factual investigation for use in a criminal\n\nproceeding. Segundo, 270 S.W.3d at 106–07.\n\n       Therefore, we find that the first page of Exhibit 7 was unquestionably admissible as a\n\npublic record under Rule 803(8)(B). As previously noted, it is unclear whether the remaining\n\ntwo pages of Exhibit 7 also originated from the TDCJ. However, even should we assume that\n\nthey were not admissible under that exception to the hearsay rule, we review the trial court’s\n\ndecision to admit evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. Lund, 366 S.W.3d at 852.\n\nWhen an exhibit contains both admissible and inadmissible evidence, the burden is on the\n\nobjecting party to specifically point out which portion of the proffered evidence is inadmissible.\n\nWhitaker v.

A trial court does not abuse its discretion when it\n\nadmits an exhibit in its entirety if the objecting party fails to segregate the admissible portion\n\nfrom that which is inadmissible. Whitaker, 286 S.W.3d at 369. As previously noted, Sessums\n\nobjected to the entire document and did not limit his request to exclude only the last two pages.\n\nBecause the first page is admissible, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the\n\nentire TDCJ document as evidence.\n                                                13\n\f       Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Exhibit 7\n\nunder Rule 803(8)(B) and overrule this point of error.\n\n       B.      Did Admitting Exhibit 7 Violate the Confrontation Clause?\n\n       Since we have found that Exhibit 7 was admissible under Rule 803(8)(B), we must\n\nconsider whether its admission violated Sessums’ right to confrontation under the United States\n\nConstitutions’ Sixth Amendment, his first point of error.\n\n       The Sixth Amendment provides that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have\n\nthe right to be confronted by the witnesses against him. U.S. CONST. amend. VI. The United\n\nStates Supreme Court has held that this right applies to both in-court testimony and to out-of-\n\ncourt statements that are testimonial in nature. See, e.g., Crawford v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(2004). Whether a particular out-of-court statement is testimonial is a question of law. De La\n\nPaz v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2190033\"><a href=\"/opinion/2190033/de-la-paz-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 680 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008).\n\n       Sessums argues that in considering this point of error, we should perform an analysis of\n\nthe evidence to examine whether it bears “particularized guarantees of trustworthiness” to make\n\nit sufficiently reliable to satisfy the Confrontation Clause. Ohio v. Roberts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66\n\n(1980). However, under Roberts, that analysis is only appropriate if we do not find the evidence\n\nadmissible under a firmly rooted hearsay exception that “‘carr[ies] special guarantees of\n\ncredibility’ essentially equivalent to, or greater than, those produced by the Constitution’s\n\npreference for cross-examined trial testimony.” Lilly v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118300\"><a href=\"/opinion/118300/lilly-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 126 (1999)\n\n(quoting White v.

In this case, we have found that Exhibit 7\n\nwas admissible as a public record or report.\n                                               14\n\f           Business and public records are generally admissible without confrontation “because—\n\nhaving been created for the administration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of\n\nestablishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not testimonial.”                        Melendez–Diaz v.\n\nMassachusetts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145853\"><a href=\"/opinion/145853/melendez-diaz-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324 (2009).                   However, a business or public record may\n\nnevertheless be inadmissible if it is prepared for prosecutorial use or in anticipation that it will be\n\nused for prosecutorial purposes.            In that case, the business or public record is considered\n\ntestimonial and subject to a Confrontation Clause challenge.                    Id.   It is the “intended or\n\nanticipated use of a statement that determines whether the statement is testimonial.” Grey v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1872505\"><a href=\"/opinion/1872505/grey-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 909 (Tex.

Appellant contended that this history was testimonial\n\nand that its admission violated the United States Constitution’s Confrontation Clause. Grey, 299\n\nS.W.3d at 906. After discussing the United States Supreme Court’s cases setting forth the test of\n\nwhat is testimonial for confrontation law purposes, the Austin Court of Appeals held the\n\nsummary was admissible since it was clearly not prepared for prosecutorial use but, rather, for\n\ninternal department purposes. Id. at 910; see also Segundo, 270 S.W.3d at 106–07 (holding\n\n8\n    Also called “pen packet.” See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 42.09 (West Supp. 2014).\n                                                        15\n\fstatements in revocation documents regarding defendant’s prior violations of terms and\n\nconditions of release were “nontestimonial” and not violative of Confrontation Clause).\n\n        As in Grey, Exhibit 7 was clearly not prepared for prosecutorial use. On its face, the\n\ndocument shows that it was prepared by the TDCJ May 2, 2011, over two years before Sessums\n\nwas arrested. As we have discussed, it was prepared and sent pursuant to a statutory duty to be\n\nused by the Bogata Police Department as it saw fit. Thus, we conclude that Exhibit 7 was not\n\ntestimonial and that its admission did not violate Sessums’ right to confrontation. We overrule\n\nthis point of error.\n\n        C.      Free Association Error Not Preserved\n\n        Sessums also complains for the first time on appeal that admitting the second and third\n\npages of Exhibit 7 violated his right to free association, relying on Dawson v. Delaware, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112702\"><a href=\"/opinion/112702/dawson-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992). In Dawson, the United States Supreme Court held that it is a violation of a\n\ndefendant’s right of free association to admit evidence of gang membership and evidence of a\n\ngang’s beliefs and propensity to violence when it is not relevant to the crime being prosecuted.\n\nId. at 166–67. However, as pointed out by the court in Dawson, the defendant in that case\n\nconsistently objected to the admission of the evidence on the ground that it violated his right of\n\nfree association under the First Amendment. Id. at 162; Dawson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2075877\"><a href=\"/opinion/2075877/dawson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1078</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1100\n\n(Del. 1990). That argument at trial is contrasted with what occurred in this case; here, although\n\nhe objected at trial on both hearsay and confrontation grounds, Sessums failed to object on free\n\nassociation grounds.\n\n\n                                               16\n\f       The purpose of requiring an objection at trial is to allow the trial court or opposing\n\ncounsel to either correct any error or remove the offending documents.
