Whether he raises a\n\nconstitutional challenge to his convictions, and, if so, how we\n\nshould rule on that challenge, are questions that have divided our\n\npanel three ways, as will become clear from our separate writings.\n\nDespite    this     tripartite   fractionation,   however,   different\n\nmajorities of the panel conclude that (1) the question of § 666’s\n\nas-applied constitutionality is properly before the panel and\n\nshould be addressed; (2) the district court had subject-matter\n\fjurisdiction of this criminal bribery case against Lipscomb; and\n\n(3) the court abused its discretion in transferring the trial sua\n\nsponte over Lipscomb’s objections.            We therefore reverse his\n\nconviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for a new trial.\n\n                                  I. FACTS\n\n     Both Lipscomb’s conduct and particular jurisdictional facts\n\nare important to the varying views of the members of this panel.\n\nWe therefore recount them in considerable detail.\n\nA.   Lipscomb’s Offense Conduct\n\n     Lipscomb served on the Dallas City Council (the “Council”)\n\nfrom 1984 to 1993 and again from 1995 until 2000.          During his first\n\nperiod   of   service,   Lipscomb    vigorously       opposed   any    measure\n\nfavorable to taxicab companies, including Yellow Cab and Checker\n\nCab (together, “Yellow Cab”), both owned by his co-conspirator,\n\nFloyd Richards. Lipscomb’s animus against cab companies apparently\n\nwas grounded in a belief that cab companies perennially failed to\n\nserve the minority community adequately.\n\n     During his second period of service on the Council, however,\n\nLipscomb demonstrated a considerably kinder disposition toward cab\n\ncompanies, especially Yellow Cab.            In 1994, during Lipscomb’s\n\nhiatus from the Council, Richards asked Lipscomb to help improve\n\nYellow Cab’s reputation in the minority community and offered to\n\npay Lipscomb $1,000 a month in cash for that help.                    Lipscomb\n\nassented to    this   proposal.     Richards    and    Lipscomb   agreed    to\n\ncontinue this arrangement as long as it was mutually agreeable.\n\n                                     2\n\fAll this transpired orally.\n\n      Richards continued to make the monthly payments to Lipscomb\n\nafter he was re-elected to the Council.         At times, Richards would\n\nreceive phone calls from Lipscomb indicating that he needed a\n\npayment, after which Lipscomb would visit Yellow Cab’s office and\n\nreceive cash that Richards took from the company safe.           Sometimes\n\nduring these meetings, Richards and Lipscomb would discuss taxicab\n\nissues then pending before the Council.           The government alleged\n\nthat in addition to making these monthly payments to Lipscomb,\n\nRichards gave Lipscomb free use of cars, free cellular telephone\n\nservice, and free cab rides worth more than $3,300.\n\n      When Lipscomb ran again, his advisers heard Richards declare\n\nthat he was willing to spend up to $30,000 to get Lipscomb elected.\n\nWhen Richards learned that corporations could not contribute to\n\ncampaigns and that individuals could contribute no more than\n\n$1,000, however, he decided to “lend” $20,500 to a business owned\n\nby Lipscomb’s daughter and son-in-law.         That money was intended by\n\nall concerned to help fund Lipscomb’s campaign, and it did so; but\n\nLipscomb did not report the campaign “loan” or any of the payments\n\nin   his   campaign   finance   reports   or    his   personal   financial\n\nstatements.\n\n      Richards testified that although he never made the quid pro\n\nquo explicit, he expected that, in return for the monthly payments\n\nand the campaign funding, Lipscomb would cast votes favorable to\n\nYellow Cab. Richards testified further that he and Lipscomb had an\n\n                                    3\n\funderstanding, and that Richards was satisfied that Lipscomb knew\n\nthat the payments would stop if he voted the wrong way.\n\n     Lipscomb’s support of Yellow Cab went far beyond the casting\n\nof favorable votes at meetings of the Council.   Over time, he and\n\nRichards discussed each of the taxicab issues on which Lipscomb\n\nallegedly was influenced by this bribery: (1) operating authority\n\nand fleet increases, (2) location of dispatch offices, (3) age\n\nlimits and inspections, and (4) insurance ratings.    Lipscomb had\n\nopposed Yellow Cab on these issues before 1994, but when he\n\nreturned to the Council, he supported that company vigorously and\n\noften.\n\n     For example, in 1994 Lipscomb, as a private citizen, had\n\nspoken out against authority for Yellow Cab and two other cab\n\ncompanies to operate in Dallas.   Once he returned to the council,\n\nthough, he supported Yellow Cab’s requests for increases in the\n\nsize of its cab fleets.   Yet when cab companies unaffiliated with\n\nRichards sought authority to operate in Dallas, Lipscomb urged that\n\ntheir applications be removed from the council’s agenda.      When\n\nanother cab company’s request for operating authority was taken up\n\nby the council, Lipscomb tried to require a voice vote on the\n\nmatter.\n\n     Yellow Cab also needed relief from a city ordinance requiring\n\ncab companies to maintain their dispatch offices inside the Dallas\n\ncity limits.   After a city staffer learned that Yellow Cab was\n\nviolating this policy, she sought to enforce it, but the Council\n\n                                  4\n\freferred the matter to its Transportation Committee.          Even though\n\nLipscomb did not serve on that committee, he attended its meeting\n\nand browbeat the staffer, going so far as to ask her when she would\n\nretire.   Eventually, with Lipscomb’s encouragement, the Council\n\npermitted cab companies to operate dispatch offices in the Dallas\n\nsuburbs, thus legitimating Yellow Cab’s office, the only one in\n\nviolation, in which Yellow Cab had invested $15,000.\n\n     Because   Yellow   Cab   had   the   newest   fleet   among   the   cab\n\ncompanies serving Dallas, the City was encouraged by Yellow Cab\n\nenergetically to enforce against its competitors the City’s age\n\nlimit on vehicles for hire and its requirement that they be\n\ninspected.   In 1992, Lipscomb had favored relaxing both rules, but\n\nin 1996, after he was told by Richards that he wanted stricter\n\nenforcement, Lipscomb began to support age limits on sedan-style\n\nlimousines similar to the limits that applied to taxicabs.         He also\n\nsought to remove older shuttles and limousines from service more\n\nquickly, and he opposed the Council’s effort to revisit its earlier\n\nvote —— favorable to Yellow Cab —— to approve stricter age limits.\n\n     Lipscomb also acted on Yellow Cab’s behalf with respect to\n\ninsurance issues.    Yellow Cab lobbied the Council to require that\n\nthe insurance coverage mandated for taxis be written by insurers\n\nwith favorable financial ratings.          This proposal proved to be\n\ncontroversial:      The City’s Director of Human Services, whose\n\ndepartment handled insurance matters, was concerned that a rating\n\nrequirement might favor large firms and exclude small businesses\n\n                                    5\n\fowned by minorities or women.   Lipscomb nevertheless sought to put\n\nthe rating requirement on the Council’s agenda, and both seconded\n\nand voted for a motion to increase the minimum rating.\n\n     In sum, Lipscomb energetically used many of the tools at the\n\ndisposal of a Council member —— his vote, his oversight authority,\n\nhis agenda-setting power, and his other parliamentary privileges ——\n\nto support policies favorable to Yellow Cab, even though these\n\npolicies conflicted with his previous positions.\n\nB.   Jurisdictional Facts\n\n     During Lipscomb’s second period of council service, the City,\n\nthrough many of its agencies and departments, received substantial\n\nfederal funds.    In the year ending in September 1996, Dallas\n\nreceived $44.3 million and spent $48.1 million in federal financial\n\nassistance which funded a wide range of joint priorities: community\n\ndevelopment, farmer’s market infrastructure, emergency shelter,\n\nhousing, community policing, airport and freeway improvements, arts\n\ndevelopment, pollution control, emergency management, interlibrary\n\ncooperation,   child   immunization,   homeless   health   care,   and\n\nsubstance abuse control, among others.     Federal support in 1996\n\ndwarfed state support, which totaled only $3.7 million received and\n\n$3.1 million spent.    Other years were similar: in 1997, the city\n\nreceived $54.3 million and spent $53.3 million in federal funds,\n\nbut received only $3.0 million and spent $3.8 million in state\n\nfunds.\n\n     Testimony of the city’s chief financial officer showed that in\n\n                                 6\n\fDallas’s efforts to obtain and then allocate federal funds, the\n\nCouncil played an integral role:\n\n          Q. And once the City gets the Department of Housing money\n     or grant funds, does the City then disburse those funds?\n          A. Yes, we do.\n          Q. And is the disbursement by approval of a City\n     Councilmember or the City Council at large?\n          A. If the individual expenditure is greater than $50,000,\n     or $15,000 in the case of professional services, it would come\n     back to the Council for approval of that specific contract.\n          Q. And does that frequently happen?\n          A. Yes, uh-huh.\n          Q. All right. And, in fact, does the Council have to\n     approve, vote for and approve the application to HUD and the\n     other agencies of the federal government to get federal money?\n          A. Yes. They vote for the application and the acceptance\n     of the money.\n\nThe Council as a whole thus controlled —— and individual council\n\nmembers influenced —— the City’s applications for, and receipt and\n\nexpenditure of, at least forty million federal dollars each year.\n\n                                 II. PROCEEDINGS\n\n     The government secured a lengthy indictment against Lipscomb.\n\nCounts 2 through 33 charged him with specific substantive                bribery\n\nviolations of § 666(a)(1)(B) and charged Richards with aiding and\n\nabetting those offenses.          Conversely, counts 34 through 65 charged\n\nRichards       with   bribery    violations   of   §   666(a)(2)   and   charged\n\nLipscomb with aiding and abetting.            Count 1 charged Lipscomb with\n\nconspiring to violate § 666.             Notably, the government did not\n\ncharge Lipscomb with the misuse of state or federal funds.\n\n     Three weeks before the long-scheduled trial date, the district\n\ncourt, acting sua sponte, without giving notice to the parties or\n\nholding    a    hearing,   and    over   Lipscomb’s    strenuous   objections,\n\n                                         7\n\ftransferred the trial from the Dallas Division of the Northern Dis-\n\ntrict of Texas to the Amarillo Division.               Thereafter, Richards\n\nentered into a plea agreement which, among other things, required\n\nhim to testify at trial.         The jury convicted Lipscomb on all\n\ncounts.       The   district   court       sentenced   him   to   41   months’\n\nimprisonment, imposed a $7,500 fine, and ordered him to pay a\n\n$6,500 special assessment.           The court also directed that the\n\nsentence be served under home confinement because of Lipscomb’s\n\nfailing health and advanced age.\n\n     Lipscomb appeals his conviction on several grounds.                    The\n\ngovernment    cross-appeals    the     home-confinement      aspect    of   his\n\nsentence.\n\n                     III. STATUTORY INTERPRETATION\n\nA.   Lipscomb’s Challenge to the Jurisdictional Reach of § 666\n\n     As it stood at the time and now stands, § 666 contains two\n\nmonetary thresholds.     Section 666 reads, in principal part:\n\n     § 666.    Theft or bribery concerning programs receiving\n               Federal funds\n          (a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in\n     subsection (b) of this section exists——\n               (1) being an agent of an organization, or of a\n          State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any\n          agency thereof——\n               ...\n                    (B) corruptly solicits or demands for the\n               benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to\n               accept, anything of value from any person,\n               intending to be influenced or rewarded in\n               connection with any business, transaction, or\n               series of transactions of such organization,\n               government, or agency involving anything of\n               value of $5,000 or more;\n\n\n                                       8\n\f               ...\n     shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than\n     10 years, or both.\n          (b) The circumstance referred to in subsection (a)\n     of this section is that the organization, government, or\n     agency receives, in any one year period, benefits in\n     excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a\n     grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or\n     other form of Federal assistance.1\n\nLipscomb insists that we should narrowly construe § 666 to avoid\n\nthe constitutional question that arises if we interpret the statute\n\nto prohibit activity not directly related to federal spending or\n\nfederally funded programs.     He proposes that we construe the\n\nstatute to require a nexus between his offense conduct and federal\n\nfunds —— or, put differently, that his conduct implicate a tangible\n\nfederal interest.   He also contends that, when so construed, the\n\nstatute does not reach his conduct.   Neither contention succeeds.\n\n     The phylogeny of § 666 jurisprudence does reflect a growing\n\ntension between two possible focuses of the statute.    One, which\n\nanother court has dubbed the “funds focus,” would concentrate on\n\ndeterring direct depletion of federal funds; the other, the so-\n\ncalled “corruption focus,” would combat “the corrupting, public-\n\ntrust eroding effects of bribery” and would not require that\n\nfederal funds be depleted or misallocated as a direct result of the\n\nbribe.2   Lipscomb’s proposal that we adopt the narrower, funds\n\nfocus, however, would require us to ignore our consistently broad\n\n     1\n      18 U.S.C. § 666 (2000) (emphasis added).\n     2\n      United States v. Apple, 927 F. Supp. 1119, 1124 (N.D. Ind.\n1996).\n\n                                9\n\finterpretation of § 666 as targeting corruption qua corruption.\n\nFurthermore, even if we were to read § 666 and our cases to\n\nconstrue it narrowly, to superimpose a nexus element, we would\n\nstill    conclude     that   there    is    a    sufficient   linkage   between\n\nLipscomb’s conduct and federal funds to support jurisdiction of\n\nLipscomb’s case.\n\nB.   Westmoreland and Its Progeny: The Corruption Focus —— No\n     Further Nexus Required\n\n     We first interpreted § 666 in United States v. Westmoreland.3\n\nThe defendant, Westmoreland, was a county supervisor who was\n\nconvicted of accepting bribes and kickbacks in connection with the\n\npurchasing    of    supplies   for   the    county’s    highway   construction\n\nprojects.4    The county received slightly more than $200,000 in\n\ntotal federal revenue-sharing funds, of which roughly 15% was\n\nallocated to Westmoreland’s district.5\n\n     Westmoreland contended that “the federal revenue sharing funds\n\nreceived [by her district]...were segregated and not expended for\n\nthe types of purchases she made.”6              She therefore argued that the\n\nbribery “concerned only state monies and did not fall within the\n\npurview of the statute.”7            We rejected such a construction as\n\n\n     3\n        841 F.2d 572 (5th Cir. 1988).\n     4\n        Id. at 573–75.\n     5\n        Id. at 575.\n     6\n        Id.\n     7\n        Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 575.\n\n                                       10\n\fcontrary to the statute’s text:\n\n     Despite Westmoreland’s protestations, we find the\n     relevant statutory language plain and unambiguous. By\n     the terms of section 666, when a local government agency\n     receives an annual benefit of more than $10,000 under a\n     federal assistance program, its agents are governed by\n     the statute, and an agent violates subsection (b) when he\n     engages in the prohibited conduct “in any transaction or\n     matter or series of transactions or matters involving\n     $5,000 or more concerning the affairs of” the local\n     government agency.     18 U.S.C. § 666(b) (Supp. 1984)\n     (emphasis added).    Subsection (b) contains nothing to\n     indicate that “any transaction involving $5,000” means\n     “any federally funded transaction involving $5,000” or\n     “any transaction involving $5,000 of federal funds[.]”8\n\nWestmoreland also made the argument that Lipscomb makes here:\n\n“[A]n expansive interpretation [of § 666]...extends federal power\n\nin a manner that, in many instances, the federal interest at stake\n\ndoes not warrant.”9    The Westmoreland panel responded:\n\n     Once Congress has spoken, however, we do not sit to judge\n     the wisdom of its action. It is sufficient that Congress\n     seeks to preserve the integrity of federal funds by\n     assuring the integrity of the organizations or agencies\n     that receive them.... [T]he direct involvement of federal\n     funds in a transaction is not an essential element of\n     bribery under section 666(b); the government need not\n     prove that federal monies funded a corrupt transaction.10\n\nWestmoreland thus held that no connection was required between the\n\nfederal funds allocated to the county and the supervisor’s illegal\n\n\n\n     8\n      Id. at 576.\n     9\n      Id. at 577–78.\n     10\n      Id. at 578. We noted that “any reference to federal funds\nis conspicuously absent from the operative provisions [of § 666],\nand it is clear that Congress has cast a broad net to encompass\nlocal officials who may administer federal funds, regardless of\nwhether they actually do.” Id. at 577.\n\n                                  11\n\fconduct.     Instead, the only requisite involvement of federal funds\n\nwas the county’s receipt of more than $10,000 per year.11\n\n     Since     Westmoreland,   we   have   sometimes   applied   its   broad\n\nreading of § 666 unconditionally.         For example, in United States v.\n\nMoeller,12 the government appealed the dismissal of § 666 counts\n\nagainst employees of the Texas Federal Inspection Service (“TFIS”),\n\na cooperative venture of the agriculture departments of Texas and\n\nthe United States, in which state workers were empowered to conduct\n\nfederal inspections.13     Although we said that “there must be some\n\nnexus between the criminal conduct and the agency receiving federal\n\nassistance,” that nexus was purely textual:            It was present when\n\nthe Texas Department of Agriculture, a government agency for\n\npurposes of § 666, received more than $10,000 a year in federal\n\nfunds, and the defendants, TFIS employees, were agents of that\n\nfederally-funded agency.14      Thus Moeller cannot be read to have\n\nimposed the extratextual nexus that Lipscomb urges us to engraft on\n\n§ 666.\n\n     Some uncertainty seeped into our § 666 jurisprudence as a\n\n\n\n\n     11\n      Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 575–76.

Marmolejo.15               There, we upheld the\n\nconviction of a county sheriff in Texas who had accepted bribes in\n\nreturn for permitting conjugal visits to a federal prisoner whom\n\nthe State of Texas, in return for a federal per diem fee, housed in\n\na state prison renovated with federal funds.16 In addressing wheth-\n\ner § 666 gave jurisdiction to prosecute, we noted that “[w]e have\n\npreviously held that § 666(a)(1)(B) does not require the government\n\nto prove that federal funds were directly involved in a bribery\n\ntransaction,     or   that   the   federal   monies    funded   the   corrupt\n\ntransaction.”17       Nevertheless, when discussing whether conjugal\n\nvisits were “anything of value” under § 666, we stated that\n\n     [b]ecause the conduct in this case involves serious acts\n     of bribery by agents of a local government who were\n     carrying out their duties under a Federal program, we\n     conclude that this case is within the scope of conduct\n     Congress intended to encompass with 18 U.S.C. § 666.18\n\nWe did not identify whence we derived any limits on the “scope of\n\nconduct Congress intended to encompass.”         The dissent argued that\n\nWestmoreland interpreted § 666 to reach “only those acts of bribery\n\nthat could somehow be traced, directly or indirectly, to the\n\n\n\n     15\n      89 F.3d 1185 (5th Cir. 1996), aff’d sub nom.

The Salinas Speculation and Its Sequellae: The Funds Focus,\n     Requiring a Further Nexus\n\n     In reviewing Marmolejo, under the caption Salinas v. United\n\nStates,20 the Supreme Court asked whether § 666 is “limited to cases\n\nin which the bribe has a demonstrated effect upon federal funds.”21\n\nThe Court stated that “[t]he statute’s plain language fails to\n\nprovide any basis” for such a limitation and that the legislative\n\nhistory forecloses it.22       The Court thus agreed with our Marmolejo\n\nholding that federal funds need not be directly involved in a\n\nviolation of § 666.23         The Court nonetheless obliquely suggested\n\n\n     19\n      Id. at 1203 (Jolly, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original).\n“Turning to the precise legislative history, I find that it clearly\nreveals that Congress did not intend for § 666(a)(1)(B) to be\napplied to conduct such as the acceptance of bribes to allow\nconjugal visits.     Instead, Congress was only concerned with\nprotecting the federal monies disbursed to non-federal entities.”\nId.\n     20\n          522 U.S. 52 (1997).\n     21\n          Id. at 54.\n     22\n          Id. at 57, 59.\n     23\n      Id. at 56–57 (citation omitted and brackets original):\n     The enactment’s expansive, unqualified language, both as\n     to the bribes forbidden and the entities covered, does\n     not support the interpretation that federal funds must be\n     affected to violate § 666(a)(1)(B)....     [T]he statute\n     forbids acceptance of a bribe by a covered official who\n     intends “to be influenced or rewarded in connection with\n\n                                       14\n\fthat there might be obstacles to applying § 666 to different facts:\n\n          We need not consider whether the statute requires\n     some other kind of connection between a bribe and the\n     expenditure of federal funds, for in this case the bribe\n     was related to the housing of a prisoner in facilities\n     paid for in significant part by federal funds themselves.\n     And that relationship is close enough to satisfy whatever\n     connection the statute might require.24\n\nEven so, the Court disposed of any constitutional question:\n\n          [T]here    is   no    serious   doubt   about    the\n     constitutionality of § 666(a)(1)(B) as applied to the\n     facts of this case. [The briber] was without question a\n     prisoner held in a jail managed pursuant to a series of\n     agreements with the Federal Government. The preferential\n     treatment accorded to him was a threat to the integrity\n     and proper operation of the federal program. Whatever\n     might be said about § 666(a)(1)(B)’s application in other\n     cases, the application of § 666(a)(1)(B) to Salinas did\n     not extend federal power beyond its proper bounds.25\n\n     Since Salinas, the Supreme Court has decided only one more\n\n§ 666 case: United States v. Fischer,26 which also sent mixed\n\nmessages.      Echoing Salinas, the Fischer Court described § 666 as\n\n“expansive, both as to the conduct forbidden and the entities\n\ncovered”27 and read the statute to reveal Congress’s “expansive,\n\n\n     any business, transaction, or series of transactions of\n     [the defined] organization, government or agency.” The\n     prohibition is not confined to a business or transaction\n     which affects federal funds.     The word “any,” which\n     prefaces the business or transaction clause, undercuts\n     the attempt to impose this narrowing construction.\n     24\n          Salinas, 522 U.S. at 59.\n     25\n          Id. at 60–61 (emphases added).\n     26\n          Fischer v. United States, 529 U.S. 667 (2000).\n     27\n      Id. at 678 (internal quotations and brackets omitted) (citing\nSalinas, 522 U.S. at 56).\n\n                                     15\n\funambiguous      intent    to   ensure        the   integrity     of   organizations\n\nparticipating in federal assistance programs”28 —— clearly embracing\n\nthe   “corruption        focus.”        The    Court       therefore   affirmed   the\n\nconviction of a defendant who had defrauded a municipal hospital\n\nauthority that participated in the federal Medicare program.29                     In\n\nso doing, however, the Court once again mentioned in passing a\n\nconceivable constitutional problem:                   To read the statutory term\n\n“benefits” too broadly, the Court cautioned, so as to mean “[a]ny\n\nreceipt of federal funds,” could “turn almost every act of fraud or\n\nbribery into a federal offense, upsetting the proper federal\n\nbalance.”30      Justice Thomas, joined in dissent by Justice Scalia,\n\nlikewise warned that “[w]ithout a jurisdictional provision that\n\nwould ensure that in each case the exercise of federal power is\n\nrelated to the federal interest in a federal program, § 666 would\n\ncriminalize      routine    acts    of    fraud       or    bribery”   and   threaten\n\nprinciples of federalism.31\n\n      Although Salinas and Fischer did not unconditionally validate\n\nour view that once a local government accepts more than $10,000 per\n\nyear from the federal government, no further federal interest is\n\nneeded to justify prosecution under § 666, neither did either of\n\n\n      28\n           Fischer, 529 U.S. at 678 (emphasis added).\n      29\n           Id. at 669–70, 681–82.\n      30\n           Id. at 681.\n      31\n      Fischer, 529 U.S.            at    690    n.3    (Thomas,    J.,   dissenting)\n(emphasis in original).\n\n                                          16\n\fthose cases condemn our broad approach.         The Salinas Court merely\n\nobserved in passing that, even if a federal interest were required,\n\nsuch an interest clearly existed in preventing federal prisoners\n\nfrom bribing local jail officials participating in a federal\n\nincarceration program.       Similarly, the Fischer Court construed a\n\nterm in § 666 broadly, simply musing that federalism principles\n\nmight somehow limit the statute’s sweep.         As either a statutory or\n\nconstitutional matter, then, the Court might be seen as harboring\n\ninchoate qualms about whether, for § 666 to apply, there might be\n\nsome need for a direct interest in the funds involved in the\n\nprohibited conduct (or, alternatively, a need for either a nexus\n\nbetween the federal dollars and the offense conduct or an extra-\n\ntextual jurisdictional element to § 666).           Lipscomb argues this\n\ninference forcefully, noting that Salinas left open the question\n\nwhether § 666 “requires some other kind of connection between a\n\nbribe and the expenditure of federal funds.”32               He urges us to\n\noverlook Westmoreland and answer this question in the affirmative.\n\n     This, of course, we could not do even if we were so inclined.\n\nMere ruminations      in   Supreme   Court   opinions   do   not   empower   a\n\nsubsequent panel of our court to disregard, much less overrule, the\n\nholding of a prior panel.      And, as we noted just last year, “[w]e\n\nare not convinced that Salinas wrought a change upon our earlier\n\n\n\n\n     32\n          Salinas, 522 U.S. at 59.\n\n                                     17\n\fprecedents.”33    Because Salinas and Fischer went no further than to\n\nadvert in dicta to the mere possibility that the argument now\n\nadvanced by Lipscomb might someday be favored, we are bound to\n\nadhere to Westmoreland’s statutory holding.34\n\n     Likewise, our post-Salinas decisions interpreting § 666 must\n\nbe read as adhering to this rule.         Nevertheless, the cautionary\n\nwords in Salinas and Fischer, combined with our prior opinions’\n\nsilence on the constitutional question, divided the next panel of\n\nthis court to interpret § 666.    The panel majority in United States\n\nv. Phillips35 reiterated Moeller’s requirement of a nexus between\n\nthe misconduct and the agency (as distinct from a nexus between the\n\nmisconduct and the federal funds themselves),36 but added some\n\nextra-textual teeth in holding that defendant Phillips, a tax\n\nassessor, was not an “agent” of Louisiana’s St. Helena Parish,\n\nwhich received over $10,000 in federal funds, so as to be liable\n\nhimself under § 666 for putting on his payroll a political ally who\n\n\n\n     33\n      United States v.

Parish of St. Tammany, 187 F.3d 452,      466 (5th Cir.\n1999) (“It is a firm rule of this circuit that in the    absence of an\nintervening contrary or superseding decision by this     court sitting\nen banc or by the United States Supreme Court, a          panel cannot\noverrule a prior panel’s decision.”).\n     35\n          219 F.3d 404 (5th Cir. 2000).\n     36\n      Id. at 413–14 (“[T]here must be some nexus between the\ncriminal conduct and the agency receiving federal assistance.”)\n(quoting Moeller, 987 F.2d at 1137) (emphasis original to\nPhillips).\n\n                                   18\n\fthen did no work.37           The panel instead viewed Phillips as an agent\n\nof the Louisiana Tax Commission, which received no federal funds,\n\nand    concluded       that    the   statute    did    not     reach   his   activity.\n\nUnderlying         this    definitional    question      about    “agent,”    however,\n\nlurked       the     majority’s      concern    that     the     defendant   was    too\n\nfunctionally distant from the flow of federal funds to the parish:\n\n       We know from the Supreme Court’s decision in Salinas that\n       the funds in question need not be purely federal, nor\n       must the conduct in question have a direct effect on\n       federal funds. The statute possibly can reach misuse of\n       virtually all funds of an agency that administers the\n       federal program in question. It is a different matter\n       altogether, however, to suggest that the statute can\n       reach any government employee who misappropriates purely\n       local funds, without regard to how organizationally\n       removed the employee is from the particular agency that\n       administers the federal program.38\n\nWe acknowledge that it is at least arguable, albeit tenuously, that\n\nthis        “organizationally          removed”       language      conflicts       with\n\nWestmoreland         and    Moeller,    even    though    the     Phillips    majority\n\npurported       to    distinguish      those    two    cases    factually,    and   the\n\nPhillips panel may be perceived as having favored the “funds focus”\n\n\n       37\n            Phillips, 219 F.3d at 407–08, 411–15.\n       38\n      Id. at 411 (citations omitted and emphasis added). To the\npanel majority, the legislative history of § 666 revealed\n“Congress’ concern with a defendant’s ability to administer or\ncontrol the federal funds provided to a particular agency,” id. at\n411 n.7, and Fischer counseled that “the fraud must have the\npotential to affect the identified federal funds or program,” id.\nat 412 n.13. But in the “absence of evidence that connects the\nassessor’s office to control or expenditure of any funds of the\nparish,” id. at 411 n.9, prosecuting under § 666 “advances no\nfederal interest in safeguarding a particular federal program,” id.\nat 414.\n\n                                           19\n\ffor § 666.      To the extent that there is a conflict, however, the\n\nolder case controls, as the Phillips dissenter correctly noted.39\n\n     Only     by   interpreting      “agent”     narrowly   was    the    Phillips\n\nmajority able to avoid the constitutional question.40                 The Phillips\n\ndissent read our own precedents as rejecting any nexus requirement\n\nwhatsoever     and   took    issue   with    the   panel    majority’s      narrow\n\ndefinition of “agent.”41         The dissent asserted that a “specific\n\nnexus —— between Phillips and the federal funds inside Parish\n\ncoffers —— is not required” and furthermore that “it is sufficient\n\nthat the criminal conduct affect the agency receiving federal\n\nassistance:        in essence, we have determined that there is an\n\ninherent federal interest in insuring that agencies receiving\n\nsignificant amounts of federal funding are not corrupt.”42                      In a\n\nnutshell, this is precisely the “corruption focus” that we had\n\nfirmly adopted       in    Westmoreland,     a   focus   that   has     never   been\n\noverruled either by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\n\nD.   Reyes and Williams: Either Way, § 666 Covers Lipscomb\n\n     Two     cases   decided     last   year     demonstrate      our    continued\n\ncommitment to applying § 666 to members of municipal and parochial\n\ngoverning bodies.         These cases provide additional support for the\n\n\n\n     39\n          Id. at 423 n.4 (E.

Reyes,43 we affirmed the § 666 conviction of city\n\ncouncil members who had been bribed to vote in favor of awarding a\n\nmunicipal construction project to a particular contractor.44      The\n\ngovernment noted that a federal loan would have supported the\n\nproject had it gone forward, but we explicitly declined to rely on\n\nthat fact, stating instead that federal support of the three city\n\ndepartments involved in the project —— the finance, housing, and\n\nlegal departments —— justified prosecuting under § 66645:\n\n     Applying Westmoreland and Moeller..., we conclude that\n     the connection between federal benefits and the charged\n     conduct is sufficient to uphold Reyes’s convictions under\n     § 666.... Like the county supervisor in Westmoreland and\n     the senior agency officials in Moeller, here the charged\n     criminal conduct related to city council members, who, by\n     voting up or down on bids, ultimately decide how federal\n     money will be spent.46\n\nSuch an analysis firmly supports Lipscomb’s susceptibility to\n\nconviction under § 666: In Dallas, federal money supports the\n\nCity’s transportation and human services departments —— the very\n\nagencies of city government that Lipscomb sought corruptly to\n\ninfluence.     Reyes reaffirms, as a statutory matter, that whatever\n\nnexus § 666 requires —— if any —— is present in this case.\n\n\n\n\n     43\n          United States v. Reyes, 239 F.2d 722 (5th Cir. 2001).\n     44\n          Id. at 726–32.\n     45\n          Id. at 734 & n.5.\n     46\n          Id. at 734 (emphasis added).\n\n                                   21\n\f     More recently, we decided United States v. Williams47 without\n\ndiscussing any jurisdictional element or nexus requirement at all\n\n—— despite the fact that if there had been a jurisdictional flaw,\n\nit would have been incumbent on the Williams panel to address that\n\nproblem, even sua sponte.             Williams involved facts virtually\n\nidentical to those present in Reyes, in Westmoreland, and here.\n\nWilliams, a former member of the Jackson, Mississippi City Council,\n\nwas convicted under § 666 of aiding and abetting the solicitation\n\nand acceptance of bribes —— specifically, $150,000 in exchange for\n\na re-vote on a cable television license contract.48               The Williams\n\ncourt did not describe any direct federal fiscal interest at stake\n\nin that re-vote.           Such questions, however, may not have been\n\nbriefed     or    argued   in   Williams,   as   the   opinion   in   that   case\n\nexpressly rejected only other challenges —— those grounded in equal\n\nprotection, due process, and sufficiency and admissibility of the\n\nevidence     ——    to   Williams’s   conviction.49      Taken    in   isolation,\n\nWilliams has little if any precedential value on the nexus issue,\n\none way or the other.\n\n     But of course Williams does not stand alone.            It is merely the\n\nmost recent in a series of our opinions —— Westmoreland, Moeller,\n\nMarmolejo, Reyes, and Williams —— that have consistently applied\n\n\n\n     47\n          United States v. Williams, 264 F.3d 561 (5th Cir. 2001).\n     48\n          Id. at 566–67.\n     49\n          Id. at 567–78.\n\n                                       22\n\fthe broad “corruption focus” of § 666.                      The Phillips panel did\n\nconstrue the term “agent” to avoid the constitutional question, but\n\nwe cannot do that here: As a textual matter, the term “agent”\n\nplainly includes city council members.                    Westmoreland applied § 666\n\nto a county supervisor; Reyes and Williams both applied it to city\n\ncouncil members.       Hence Westmoreland’s view of § 666 continues to\n\nbe   the   law   in    this    circuit       and     to    preclude    a    more   narrow\n\nconstruction of the statute.             Even though we get to the question\n\nfrom different jurisdictional perspectives, Judge Duhé and I are in\n\ncomplete accord        on   the    result     for     Lipscomb    of       the   foregoing\n\nanalysis of § 666:            He was subject to being tried in federal\n\ndistrict court for violating that statute, and he was subject to\n\nbeing convicted by a jury.\n\n           IV. DID LIPSCOMB RAISE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE?\n\n      Before addressing the constitutional problem that Lipscomb’s\n\nstatutory-construction argument presages (and writing for myself\n\nalone, although supplementing Judge Smith’s analysis), I must make\n\nthree observations on our intrapanel disagreement over whether the\n\nconstitutional issue is properly before us.                     To me, this debate:\n\n(1) is more semantical than substantive, (2) is in tension with\n\ncontrolling Supreme Court precedent, and (3) overlooks the real\n\nnature of the constitutional question at issue.\n\n      Semantics       first:      As   the        Supreme    Court     recently     said,\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f“jurisdiction...is a word of many, too many, meanings.”50                             This\n\nimprecision is one source of our panel’s split here.                          Judge Duhé\n\nreads “jurisdiction” in the pleadings, briefs, and record to mean\n\nadjudicative jurisdiction only —— the authority of federal courts\n\nto   hear       only    those         categories        of   cases    (subject-matter\n\njurisdiction) authorized by Congress, between those categories of\n\npersons (personal jurisdiction) permitted by the Constitution. But\n\nin the context of the expressly constitutional arguments that\n\nLipscomb sometimes makes, Judge Smith and I read his use of\n\n“jurisdiction”         ——     at     least    on   those     occasions    ——    to    mean\n\nlegislative jurisdiction, the “authority” of Congress “to make its\n\nlaw applicable to particular persons or activities.”51\n\n     Lipscomb          also        uses      the    ambiguous        phrase     “federal\n\njurisdiction,” which could be either adjudicative or legislative.\n\nThat ambiguity is not only terminological, but also conceptual. To\n\nstate     the    obvious,          legislative     jurisdiction       flows    from   the\n\nConstitution to the Congress and limits, in today’s context, the\n\nsubject matter         and     the    classes      of   persons   that   Congress     may\n\nregulate    by    statute.           In   contrast,      adjudicative    jurisdiction\n\ngenerally flows from Congress to the courts as grants of subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction, grants made by Congress in enacting laws\n\n     50\n      Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83,\n90 (1998).\n     51\n      Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 813\n(1993) (Scalia, J., dissenting).

Consequently, a court’s\n\nadjudicative jurisdiction to convict a defendant of a federal crime\n\ncannot exist in the absence of Congress’s legislative jurisdiction\n\nto criminalize the particular conduct of which the particular\n\ndefendant is accused.\n\n     The reach of Congress’s legislative jurisdiction, of course,\n\nis sometimes bounded by structural constitutional provisions.                    For\n\nexample, grants of jurisdiction are limited by the Necessary and\n\nProper Clause, which covers laws that “carry into Execution...all\n\nother powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the\n\nUnited States or in any Department or Officer thereof.”53                   I cannot\n\neven imagine how it could be “necessary and proper” to the exercise\n\nof either the judicial power or the power to constitute inferior\n\ncourts for      us   to    have   adjudicative      jurisdiction     over    a   case\n\nimplicating      a   statute      that   Congress     lacked   the    legislative\n\njurisdiction to enact.            It should go without saying, therefore,\n\nthat our subject-matter jurisdiction has constitutional as well as\n\nstatutory      limits54:     It    involves   “the     courts’     statutory      or\n\n     52\n          U.S. CONST. art.

If I am correct in my position that this case implicates\n\nour constitutional duty, at every level and at every stage of the\n\nproceedings,    to   ensure    the      existence   of    our   adjudicative\n\njurisdiction, then that duty trumps the canon of constitutional\n\navoidance that Justice Brandeis discussed in Ashwander v. TVA,56 a\n\ncanon that on other occasions I have dutifully obeyed.57              At the\n\nrisk of exposing my own intellectual shortcomings, then, I confess\n\nthat neither semantically nor substantively can I understand the\n\ndistinction, which Judge Duhé detects in Lipscomb’s pleadings and\n\nbriefs,    between   adjudicative,      subject-matter    jurisdiction    and\n\nlegislative    jurisdiction    (structural       constitutionality)     ——   a\n\ndistinction that is clear to Judge Duhé but in this case remains\n\nblurred to me.       If a successful as-applied challenge to the\n\nconstitutionality of § 666 would limit Congress’s legislative\n\njurisdiction, i.e., would identify someone or some act beyond\n\n     55\n      Steel Co.,      523   U.S.   at    89   (original   emphasis   removed,\nemphasis added).\n     56\n      Ashwander v.

In this sense, because Lipscomb\n\nappears to raise a structural jurisdictional challenge, I question\n\nwhether his is the kind of constitutional argument that may be\n\nwaived through delay or disuse; if it “involves a court’s power to\n\nhear a case, [it] can never be forfeited or waived.”58\n\n     As I read them, Lipscomb’s pleadings and briefs do raise ——\n\nand thus do not waive —— the constitutional issue.          Rather, they\n\nquestion both Congress’s legislative jurisdiction (constitutional\n\nauthority) to enact § 666 and our adjudicative power to apply § 666\n\nhere.      Lipscomb has raised a classic challenge to subject-matter\n\njurisdiction: He “argues that the extension of federal jurisdiction\n\nover acts such as [his] would exceed the power of Congress.”59\n\n     My belief that we should consider this argument finds support\n\nin Salinas itself.      There the Supreme Court easily undertook to\n\ndetermine whether § 666 was constitutional, and squarely held that\n\nit was, as applied,60 despite the fact that neither we nor the\n\ndistrict court had addressed the statute’s constitutionality.61        In\n\n\n     58\n      United States v.

United States, 1997 U.S.\n\n                                     27\n\fsupport of its “holding,”62 the Court explained:\n\n     [s]tatutes should be construed to avoid constitutional\n     questions, but this interpretative canon is not a license\n     for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the\n     legislature. Any other conclusion, while purporting to\n     be an exercise in judicial restraint, would trench upon\n     the legislative powers vested in Congress....\n          These principles apply to the rules of statutory\n     construction we have followed to give proper respect to\n     the federal-state balance.... [W]e cannot press statutory\n     construction to the point of disingenuous evasion even to\n     avoid a constitutional question.63\n\nThis is why, with all due respect, I find it odd, as we labor to\n\ninterpret 18 U.S.C. § 666, for Judge Duhé to urge obeisance to the\n\nAshwander canon, which the Supreme Court itself in Salinas first\n\nacknowledged and then declined to observe or apply.\n\n     To the extent that the real question is whether Lipscomb\n\nadequately raised constitutionality, I trust Judge Duhé would\n\nconcede two premises: first, that Lipscomb urged the district court\n\n(and this one) so to construe § 666 as to avoid a serious and\n\nidentified constitutional flaw; and second, that this panel has\n\nunanimously concluded that we cannot so construe the statute.\n\nStarting with these two premises, I cannot avoid the conclusion\n\n\n\nTrans.

That jurisprudence has focused on whether Congress\n\nmay condition grants of federal funds.                       Even if § 666 is not a\n\nconditional-grant statute —— a conclusion of which I am less\n\ncertain       than       is   Judge     Smith     ——   the   conditional-grant   cases\n\nestablish both that “internal limits on congressional spending\n\npower are difficult to discern”65 and that, to whatever extent the\n\nTenth Amendment is an external limit on the spending power, that\n\nAmendment does not function as “a prohibition on the indirect\n\nachievement of objectives which Congress is not empowered to\n\nachieve directly.”66            The Tenth Amendment thus is not as great an\n\n\n\n       64\n            See United States v.

Conditional-Grant Precedents\n\n     Congress likely enacted § 666 pursuant to the Spending Clause\n\nof the Constitution.67     Under that clause, it is settled, Congress\n\nmay regulate the states by conditioning grants.68      Cases on such\n\nconditions have established that the structural limits on federal\n\npower that often arise in the commerce-clause context do not\n\noperate with the same force against conditional-grant provisions.\n\n     United States v. Butler,69 for example, is still good law for\n\nits announcement that Congress’s spending power, like its power to\n\ntax, is “to provide for the general welfare,”70 and is therefore\n\nuntrammeled by the specific grants of legislative power found\n\nelsewhere in Article I, Section 8:\n\n     While, therefore, the power to tax is not unlimited, its\n     confines are set in the clause which confers it, and not\n     in those of section 8 which bestow and define the\n     legislative powers of the Congress. It results that the\n     power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public\n\n\n     67\n      Fischer, 529 U.S. at 689 n.3 (Thomas, J., dissenting)\n(“Section 666 was adopted pursuant to Congress’ spending power.”);\nPhillips, 219 F.3d at 414 (“Congress’ authority to enact § 666\nrests on the Spending Clause of the Constitution.”). The spending\npower is not granted in such terms but is an outgrowth of the\n“Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises, to\npay the Debts and provide for the Common Defence and general\nWelfare of the United States.” U.S. CONST. art.

United States Civil Service Commission,73\n\nwhich rejected a constitutional challenge to the Hatch Act.              That\n\nAct then forbade political activities by any “officer or employee\n\nof any State or local agency whose principal employment is in\n\nconnection with any activity which is financed in whole or in part\n\nby loans or grants made by the United States.”74         Oklahoma and its\n\nState      Highway   Commissioner    challenged    the      Civil     Service\n\nCommission’s attempt to force on the State the choice between\n\ndismissing     the   Commissioner,   who   had    engaged    in     political\n\nactivities, or forgoing highway funds in the amount of twice the\n\ncommissioner’s salary.75     The Court responded:\n\n     While the United States is not concerned with and has no\n     power to regulate local political activities as such of\n     state officials, it does have power to fix the terms upon\n\n\n     71\n          Butler, 297 U.S. at 66.\n     72\n          Id. at 66–78.\n     73\n          330 U.S. 127 (1947).\n     74\n      Id. at 129 n.1, citing 18 U.S.C.A. § 61l. The Hatch Act,\nalthough recently reformed, remains on the statute books; today it\ncriminalizes the extortion of political contributions under threat\nof withholding employment, payments, or benefits that are “provided\nfor or made possible in whole or in part by an Act of Congress.”\nThis language shows that Congress knows how to link criminal\nsanctions tightly to federal spending, should it so desire.\n     75\n          Oklahoma, 330 U.S. at 129–34.\n\n                                     31\n\f     which its money allotments to states shall be disbursed.\n          The Tenth Amendment does not forbid the exercise of\n     this power in the way that Congress has proceeded in this\n     case....   [T]he Tenth Amendment has been consistently\n     construed “as not depriving the national government of\n     authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a\n     granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted\n     to the permitted end.”.... The offer of benefits to a\n     state...dependent upon cooperation by the state with\n     federal plans, assumedly for the general welfare, is not\n     unusual.76\n\nOklahoma, the Court said, could evade the condition by the “simple\n\nexpedient” of not yielding to the enticement of federal funds.77\n\n     The apex of the Court’s conditional-grant jurisprudence is\n\nSouth Dakota v. Dole,78 which involved a statute conditioning a\n\nsmall portion of each state’s federal highway aid on the state’s\n\nestablishing a minimum drinking age.79            The Court upheld the\n\ndrinking-age requirement as an exercise of Congress’s Spending-\n\nClause authority to condition federal grants.80         The Court also\n\nannounced that when Congress chooses to go beyond its enumerated\n\npowers, and to use its spending power “to further broad policy\n\nobjectives     by   conditioning   receipt   of   federal   monies   upon\n\ncompliance with federal statutory...directives,” the statutory\n\ncondition must itself meet four conditions, the failure to meet any\n\n\n\n     76\n          Id. at 143–44.\n     77\n          Id. at 143.\n     78\n          483 U.S. 203 (1987).\n     79\n          Id. at 205.\n     80\n          Id. at 206.\n\n                                    32\n\fone of which might render a statute unconstitutionally broad.81\n\nB.   The Dole Test Is Instructive Here\n\n     Given Dole’s context, applying its test to § 666 could be\n\ntrebly problematic.        First, like Judge Smith, two district courts\n\nhave concluded that § 666 is not a conditional-grant statute at\n\nall, because it does not require the state (here, Texas) or its\n\npolitical subdivision (here, Dallas) to do anything.82 As the court\n\nin United States v. Cantor noted, § 666 “does not impose a\n\ncondition on the receipt of federal funds.            The statute neither\n\nrequires   a     state’s    compliance    with   federal...directives   nor\n\nprevents state action.”83 Like the Cantor court, however, I believe\n\nthat this lack of direct effect on states and localities actually\n\nsupports   the    statute’s    constitutionality.84      Furthermore,   the\n\n     81\n      Id. at 207-08. At least one court has concluded that use of\n§ 666 to prosecute crimes with no federal nexus violates the Dole\ntest’s third condition.    See United States v. McCormack, 31 F.\nSupp. 2d 176 (D. Mass. 1998) (finding the statute unconstitutional\nas applied to a defendant who had bribed a local police officer to\nprevent that officer’s further investigation into a state crime,\nand the entity that received federal funds was the police\ndepartment that employed the bribed officer).\n     82\n      United States v. Sabri, 183 F. Supp. 2d 1145, 1156 (D. Minn.\n2002) (“[T]he    statute   does  not   apply   to  the   recipient\ngovernment.”).\n     83\n      United States v. Cantor, 897 F. Supp. 110, 113 (S.D.N.Y.\n1995). A condition statute generally requires a state’s compliance\nwith federal regulatory or administrative directives in exchange\nfor receipt of federal funds. Va.

(“All Congress has done in Section 666 is to pass a law\nmaking the conduct of individuals, not the state, criminal. Hence,\nI do not believe that a Tenth Amendment argument is appropriate in\n\n                                     33\n\fSupreme Court has not held that, for a statute to be a conditional-\n\ngrant provision and stand or fall under a Dole analysis, the\n\nstatute must require states or localities either to take or to\n\nrefrain from taking any action.85    Dole may describe Congress’s\n\nspending power generally, not just its power to condition grants.\n\n     Second, § 666 is a freestanding ban: It neither grants any\n\nfunds nor takes part in a broader funding statute.     This fact has\n\nprompted the objection that its criminal sanction cannot be a\n\ncondition.86   Although   superficially   appealing,   this   argument\n\nelevates form too highly over substance.        The anticorruption\n\nprinciple in § 666 applies equally to every federal dollar granted,\n\nand § 666 logically cuts across all federal grants to states and\n\nlocalities.87 To require Congress to insert a mini-§ 666 into every\n\nchapter of the United States Code that authorizes intergovernmental\n\nfinancial assistance would constitute excessive scrupulosity.\n\n\n\nthis case.”) (citation omitted).\n     85\n      See New York v.

Neither did Congress bestow\n     gifts of funds upon those governments. Rather, Congress\n     passed a federal criminal statute designed to punish\n     conduct that falls within the domain of traditional state\n     concerns (bribery, embezzlement, fraud, etc.). Section\n     666 reaches beyond punishment of the state and local\n     governments who receive those funds to proscribe the\n     conduct of third persons who aren’t parties to the\n     funding contract.

We have held that the spending\npower requires, at least, that the exercise of federal power be\nrelated ‘to the federal interest in particular national projects or\nprograms.’”) (citing Dole); Phillips, 219 F.3d 404, 414 (“[T]he\npower of Congress to impose duties on non-federal entities under\nthe Spending Clause is not without limits.”) (citing Dole); Zwick,\n199 F.3d at 687 (“To pass muster under the Spending Clause,\nlegislation regulating behavior of entities receiving federal funds\nmust, among other things, be based upon a federal interest in the\nparticular conduct.”) (citing Dole); McCormack, 31 F. Supp. 2d 176,\n188 (“Of the four limits established in Dole, limit (3) ——\nrequiring that the conditions be related to the federal interest in\nparticular national projects or programs —— provides the most\nplausible attack on § 666(a).”).\n\n                                      35\n\fthe § 666 peg fits the conditional-grant hole, I shall test it\n\nunder the four prongs of Dole.\n\nC.   The Dole Analysis\n\n     Dole first requires that “exercise of the spending power must\n\nbe in pursuit of the general welfare.”90          In assessing whether this\n\nis so, Dole cautions, “courts should defer substantially to the\n\njudgment of Congress.”91         Congress has stated that the purpose of\n\n§ 666 is to “protect the integrity of the vast sums of money\n\ndistributed through Federal programs from theft, fraud, and undue\n\ninfluence     by   bribery.”92     Mindful   of   the    deference   due   this\n\njudgment, I accept that Congress easily could have thought that\n\n§ 666 advanced the general welfare by protecting the federal fisc\n\nand by ensuring that state and local decisions regarding federal\n\nprograms are not made by corrupt officials.             I do not doubt, then,\n\nthat Congress enacted § 666 “in pursuit of the general welfare.”\n\n     Second, Dole warns that “if Congress desires to condition the\n\nStates’ receipt of federal funds, it must do so unambiguously...,\n\nenabl[ing] the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant\n\n\n\n\n     90\n      Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 (citing Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.S.\n619, 640–41 (1937)).\n     91\n      Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 (citing Helvering, 301 U.S. at 640,\n645).   “[T]he concept of welfare or the opposite is shaped by\nCongress.” Helvering, 301 U.S. at 645.\n     92\n          S. REP. NO. 98-225, at 370 (1983).\n\n                                      36\n\fof the consequences of their participation.”93      Even though § 666\n\ndoes not require the states to act, it does make state and local\n\ngovernment officers criminally liable for specific misdeeds.     Thus\n\nthe states arguably have a dignity interest at stake, and if so,\n\nthey have a right to know the threat to that interest that § 666\n\nwould pose —— and the language of § 666, which is anything but\n\nambiguous, surely lets them know.       To the extent that § 666 is a\n\nconditional-grant statute, both the grant (of $10,000 or more in\n\nfederal funds) and the condition (criminalizing official bribery\n\nand theft) are pellucid.94      I see little danger that a state or\n\nlocality that receives federal funds could mistake the potential of\n\n§ 666 to criminalize conduct by its officials.\n\n     Third, Dole mandates that conditions on federal spending be\n\nrelated “to the federal interest in particular national projects or\n\nprograms,”95 or that conditions “bear some relationship to the\n\nfederal spending.”96    “The required degree of this relationship is\n\none of reasonableness or minimum rationality.”97     It suffices here\n\n\n     93\n      Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 (citing Pennhurst State School and\nHospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)).\n     94\n      Even a critic of the broad reading of § 666 concedes that its\ntext is “unambiguously broad.” Brown, supra note 74, at 277.\n     95\n      Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 (quoting Massachusetts v.

At least one court has so concluded\n\nwhen the offense conduct did not involve federal funds.98         Some of\n\nthe other decisions arriving at this conclusion, however, may have\n\ndismissed   facial,   rather   than    as-applied,   challenges   to   the\n\nstatute99; and other cases have affirmed convictions for conduct\n\nthat implicated federal funds more directly than did Lipscomb’s\n\n\n\n\nrelated to the purpose of the expenditure”).\n     98\n      United States v.

Because this\n\nreasonably-related prong of Dole is a specific application of the\n\n\n\n     100\n       See, e.g., United States v. Rooney, 37 F.3d 847, 851 (2d\nCir. 1994) (“[Section] 666's manifest purpose is to safeguard\nfinite federal resources from corruption and to police those with\ncontrol of federal funds.”); id. at 849 (stating that the defendant\nwas developing a federally-funded housing project).\n     101\n           Dole, 483 U.S. at 208 (collecting cases).\n     102\n           Id. at 210 (emphasis added).\n     103\n           Id.\n\n                                        39\n\fmore general test for whether an act of Congress is necessary and\n\nproper to an enumerated power,104 I treat these questions together.\n\n                                   VI.\n\n              AS-APPLIED CONSTITUTIONALITY UNDER McCULLOCH\n\n     In addition to assigning Congress the spending power, which\n\nbrings with it the power to condition grants, the Constitution also\n\ngives Congress the power “[t]o make all Laws which shall be\n\nnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution” the powers\n\nexpressly delegated to the federal government.105          Prosecuting\n\nLipscomb under § 666 is therefore constitutional if § 666 is “nec-\n\nessary and proper” to Congress’s spending power.\n\nA.   McCulloch and the Necessary and Proper Clause\n\n     In testing for necessity and propriety, courts should remain\n\nmindful of Justice John Marshall’s prescient explanation, in McCul-\n\nloch v. Maryland,106 of what “necessary and proper” means:\n\n     Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n     the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n     which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not pro-\n     hibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\n\n\n\n\n     104\n       See United States v. Ardoin, 19 F.3d 177, 188 & n.37 (5th\nCir. 1994) (Wiener, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part and\nin the result) (“[T]he enumerated-power test of a federal statute’s\nvalidity is whether ‘the Congress might reasonably find that the\nact relates to one of the federal powers.’”) (quoting John E. Nowak\n& Ronald D. Rotunda, Constitutional Law § 3.3 (West Publishing\n1991)).\n     105\n           U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8. cl. 18 (emphasis added).\n     106\n           17 U.S. 316 (1819).\n\n                                    40\n\f       constitution, are constitutional.107\n\nImportantly for the instant case, Marshall derived an expansive\n\nmeaning of “necessary” from the principle that Congress can derive\n\nfrom     its     enumerated   powers   the     power   to   impose   criminal\n\nsanctions.108       From the enumerated power to “establish Post Offices\n\nand post Roads,”109 Congress had “inferred the right to punish those\n\nwho steal letters from the post-office, or rob the mail.”110               In\n\nother words, Congress’s postal power carried with it the ability to\n\nimpose criminal penalties to protect federal interests advanced by\n\nthat power. To the McCulloch Court, this example demonstrated that\n\n“necessary” has a range of meanings, including “needful, requisite,\n\nessential, or conducive to.”111           It was through the lens of this\n\nbroad construction of the Necessary and Proper Clause that Marshall\n\nsaw justification for Congress’s creation of the national bank, the\n\npower to create which is nowhere enumerated in Article I.             Whether\n\nthat broad construction justifies applying § 666 here depends on\n\nCongress’s intent in enacting the statute, as well as on the nature\n\n\n\n       107\n             Id. at 421.\n       108\n       Id. at 416–17 (“So, with respect to the whole penal code of\nthe United States: whence arises the power to punish, in cases not\nprescribed by the constitution?

Legislative History\n\n      History often tells us why Congress deemed a statute necessary\n\nand proper.       Not so for § 666, however, because it was enacted as\n\npart of an omnibus spending bill of the type that makes the search\n\nfor   legislative     history   Sisyphean.    What   history   exists   is\n\nmultilayered, sparse, equivocal, and even mysterious. By no means,\n\nI respectfully submit, is it capable of supporting Judge Smith’s\n\ncontention that “Congress did not find it necessary that § 666 be\n\napplied in cases not involving federal funds or programs.”112\n\n      1.       The 1986 Technical Amendment\n\n      We owe the current language of § 666 to the Criminal Law and\n\nProcedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986.113       As that Act’s title\n\nsuggests, and as we recognized in Westmoreland,114 Congress did not\n\nintend the Act to change § 666 substantively in ways that would\n\naffect our reading of it here.115        This is important, because the\n\n\n      112\n            Infra at __.\n      113\n            P.L. 99-646, § 59, 100 Stat. 3592, 3612–13 (1986).\n      114\n       Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 577 (“[T]he amended version of\nsection 666 reinforces our interpretation. . . .

The 1984 Enactment\n\n     As first enacted, § 666(b) read:\n\n     Whoever, being an agent of an organization, or of a State\n     or local government agency...[that receives more than\n     $10,000 a year in federal funds], solicits, demands,\n     accepts, or agrees to accept anything of value from a\n     person or organization other than his employer or\n     principal for or because of the recipient’s conduct in\n     any transaction or matter or a series of transactions or\n     matters involving $5,000 or more concerning the affairs\n     of such organization or State or local government agency,\n     shall be imprisoned....116\n\nThe emphasized phrase strongly suggests that in 1984 Congress\n\nbelieved it necessary and proper for § 666 to reach bribery that\n\nhad no relation to federal funds.\n\n     3.

Thus, 18 U.S.C. 666\n     prohibits corruptly giving or receiving anything of value\n     for the purpose of influencing or being influenced in\n     connection with any business, transaction, or series of\n     transactions.\n     116\n       Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473,\n§ 1104(a), 98 Stat. 1837, 2143—44 (1984).\n\n                                43\n\fJudge Smith relies heavily on a Senate Judiciary Committee report,\n\nbut this report described a different bill that never became law.\n\nAs eventually enacted, § 666 was a small part of a large crime bill\n\nwhich was engrafted on a huge omnibus spending bill that funded\n\nmany departments and agencies.117            None of this bill’s reports,\n\nwritten as they were by the Appropriations Committees, gives\n\ncontext      for   §   666,   a   criminal    statute   which,   of   course,\n\nappropriated no funds.118\n\n     Section 666 as enacted was identical to a provision in the\n\nComprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, which passed the Senate\n\nbut never made it out of the House Judiciary Committee on its own\n\nand evidently had to piggyback on the omnibus spending bill to gain\n\nlegislative momentum.119          The Senate report on the crime bill,\n\n\n\n     117\n       See Pub L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. at 1837–2199. Entering “98\nP.L. 473” on Lexis retrieves a list of the omnibus bill’s twenty-\neight short titles and a sense of its massive scope; it included\nfive of the thirteen appropriations bills for fiscal year 1985.\nA summary of the bill, H.J. Res. 648 (98th Cong.), is available at\nhttp://thomas.loc.gov (visited Oct. 13, 2001).\n     118\n       See H.R. REP. NO. 98-1159 (1984) (conference report),\nreprinted in 130 Cong. Rec. 31445 (Oct. 10, 1984); S. REP. NO. 98-\n634 (1984) (Senate Appropriations, accompanying S.J. Res. 356); and\nH.R. REP. NO. 98-1030 (1984) (House Appropriations). Parts of the\nconference report are reprinted at 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3710–17; for\nthe conference report’s entire discussion of the crime bill, see\n130 Cong. Rec. at 31565–67.\n     The absence of language interpreting § 666 from the reports on\nthis bill is understandable also as a result of the omnibus bill’s\ntiming. Congress enacted it and the President signed it during\nOctober 10–12, 1984, less than a month before an election. See 98\nStat. at 2199.\n     119\n           See 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3182.\n\n                                      44\n\fprinted in 1983, can be taken as an authoritative statement of the\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee’s intent for what became § 666.         It is\n\ntenuous at best, however, to rely, as does Judge Smith, solely on\n\none committee report —— on a wholly separate bill —— as stating the\n\nviews of the entire Congress.\n\n     The questionable probative weight of the Senate report aside,\n\nthat report is still not determinative here, for the evidence goes\n\nboth ways.       The relevant passage is titled “Part C—Program Fraud\n\nand Bribery,” and states that § 666\n\n     is designed to create new offenses to augment the ability\n     of the United States to vindicate significant acts of\n     theft, fraud, and bribery involving Federal monies that\n     are disbursed to private organizations or State and local\n     governments pursuant to a Federal program.120\n\nThe report notes, however, that under the prior law banning theft\n\nof federal property, prosecuting was often impossible\n\n     because title has passed to the recipient [government]\n     before the property is stolen, or the funds are so\n     commingled that the Federal character of the funds cannot\n     be shown. This gives rise to a serious gap in the law,\n     since even though title to the monies may have passed,\n     the Federal Government clearly retains a strong interest\n     in assuring the integrity of such program funds.121\n\nEven though the report’s emphasis on program funds would support a\n\nnarrow reading of the necessity and propriety of § 666, its\n\nemphasis on commingling supports a broad one.     In fact, the Senate\n\nJudiciary Committee’s most explicit direction actually suggests\n\n     120\n       S. REP NO. 98-225, at 369 (1984),          reprinted   in    1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3510 (emphases added).\n     121\n           Id.\n\n                                   45\n\fthat the Committee intended to limit the scope of § 666, but in a\n\nway that still would cover Lipscomb-like conduct:\n\n     The Committee intends that the term “Federal program\n     involving a grant, a contract, a subsidy, a loan, a\n     guarantee, insurance, or another form of Federal\n     assistance” be construed broadly, consistent with the\n     purpose of this section to protect the integrity of the\n     vast sums of money distributed through Federal programs\n     from theft, fraud, and undue influence by bribery.\n     However, the concept is not unlimited. The term “Federal\n     program” means that there must exist a specific statutory\n     scheme authorizing the Federal assistance in order to\n     promote and achieve certain policy objectives. Thus, not\n     every Federal contract or disbursement of funds would be\n     covered. For example, if a government agency lawfully\n     purchases more than $10,000 in equipment from a supplier,\n     it is not the intent of this section to make a theft of\n     $5,000 or more from the supplier a Federal crime.122\n\nThus one of the two lines that the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nexpressly drew —— to exclude theft from a supplier from the\n\ncoverage     of     §   666   ——   would   not   exclude   Lipscomb’s   conduct,\n\nquintessentially “undue influence by bribery.”\n\n     4.          The Specified Cases\n\n     The immediate next sentence in the report, subject to much\n\nexegesis by Judge Smith, states:            “It is, however, the intent [‘of\n\nthis section’] to reach thefts and bribery in situations of the\n\ntypes involved in the Del Toro, Hinton, and Mosley cases.”123               With\n\ncontinued due respect to Judge Smith, I do not discern in this\n\nsentence any clear direction to us.

REP NO. 98-225, at 370, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\n3511 (emphasis added).\n     123\n           Id.\n\n                                           46\n\fsustained      convictions    of   bribed     local   officials   whom   courts\n\nconsidered to be federal officials under the prior bribery statute\n\nbecause      they   exerted   federal        authority   and   controlled   the\n\ndisbursement of federal funds.124            Simple logic dictates that just\n\nbecause the Committee intended § 666 in part to codify these cases\n\ndoes not meant that it sought to limit § 666 to these cases\n\nexclusively.\n\n     In Del Toro, the federal interest was more attenuated.                 The\n\ndefendants were convicted of bribing a New York City official to\n\nensure that they would supply office space to a city program that\n\nwas eligible for federal funds.125              The Del Toro court reversed\n\nthese bribery convictions, noting that even if the official had\n\nsucceeded in provisionally securing the lease as desired, three\n\nlocal agencies would have had to approve the lease before the city\n\ncould apply to the federal government for funds, so that “[t]here\n\nwere no existing committed federal funds for the purpose.”126               The\n\nSenate Committee’s intent to overrule Del Toro thus reflects that\n\nthe Committee thought it necessary and proper for § 666 to reach\n\n\n\n\n     124\n       United States v.

I\n\ndo not see the report as shedding much light on our question.\n\nLipscomb’s conduct falls into a middle ground that the report\n\nsimply does not address.\n\n     5.    The 1981 Bill\n\n     The plot thickens still further when an effort is made to\n\nverify the assertion in the 1983 report that the language of § 666\n\nwas derived from a 1981 bill that never became law.128     The 1981\n\nbill and its report emerged from Senate Judiciary —— the same\n\ncommittee that later wrote the 1983 bill and report.   The Committee\n\nomitted from both the 1983 bill and the 1984 act, however, the very\n\nlanguage in the 1981 bill that would have answered our question:\n\n          (c) Jurisdiction.——There is federal jurisdiction\n     over an offense described in this section if——\n          ...\n               (6) the public servant is an agent of a\n          State or local government charged by a federal\n\n     127\n       “Arguably [ ] Congress did not intend the involvement of\nfederal funds in a corrupt transaction to be a factual certainty.”\nWestmoreland, 841 F.2d at 577 (interpreting Del Toro).\n     128\n       S. REP.

Yet the\n\n1983 bill and 1984 enactment contained none of that language or\n\nanything similar.130   The reason for that absence is unclear.   In\n\n1981, when the Committee clearly sought to require a federal nexus,\n\nit had sufficient command of the English language to do so.      To\n\nsuppose that the Committee lost that faculty over either two or\n\nfour years is ludicrous.     Section 666 as enacted and amended,\n\ntherefore, might have reflected a change in the Senate Judiciary\n\nCommittee’s view on whether to require a federal nexus, but we\n\n\n     129\n       S. 1630, 97th Cong. § 101 (1981) (recodifying all of Title\n18). This jurisdictional language in the proposed bribery section\nwould have been the new 18 U.S.C. § 1351(c)(6). See S. 1630, 97th\nCong. § 101, at 76–77 (codifying program bribery offense).\n     The commercial bribery section in the 1981 bill contained a\nsimilar   nexus   requirement  for   the  existence  of   federal\njurisdiction.    See S. 1630, 97th Cong. § 101, at 134 (1981)\n(proposing a new 18 U.S.C. § 1751(c)(1)(I)).\n     130\n       Any attempt to rely on the legislative history of the 1981\nbill is therefore misguided. Unfortunately, a panel of this court\nhas done so, quoting the 1981 report as if it were the 1983 report\nthat shed light on the enacted text. See Phillips, 219 F.3d at 413\nn.14 (citing United States v. Coyne, 4 F.3d 100, 110 n.1 (2d Cir.\n1993) for its description of the “Committee Report,” but failing to\nnote that the quote was from the 1981 report, not the 1983 report).\nBoth Phillips and Coyne erred in relying on a report interpreting\na jurisdictional requisite that never became law.\n\n                                 49\n\fcannot say this with certainty: For all we know, the Committee\n\nmight well have sought to exercise federal criminal jurisdiction up\n\nto its constitutional limits, leaving the issue to the courts to\n\ndecide.\n\nC.   The Views of Other Courts\n\n     Whatever the reason for § 666’s silence on this question, the\n\ncourts have struggled to produce the answer.   Some district courts\n\nhave tested § 666 against the Tenth Amendment, treating the statute\n\nas an emanation of the spending power, and have come to varying\n\nconclusions.131   Additionally, four of our fellow appellate courts\n\nhave examined the sweep of § 666, either as a statutory matter or\n\na constitutional one, and are also divided.\n\n     131\n       Compare United States v. Sabri, 183 F. Supp. 2d 1145,\n1154–58 (D. Minn. 2002) (seemingly holding, contra Salinas, § 666\nto be a facially unconstitutional exercise of the spending power)\nand United States v. McCormack, 31 F. Supp. 2d 176, 178, 183–89 (D.\nMass. 1998) (finding § 666 unconstitutional, because exceeding\nCongress’s spending power, as applied to indict defendant who\nbribed a local police officer to prevent investigation and\nprosecution of state crimes, despite the fact that the police\ndepartment received federal funds) with United States v. Ferrara,\n990 F. Supp. 146, 152 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (rejecting federalism\nchallenge to indictment of defendant who attempted to bribe members\nof a town board so that they would vote to approve zoning changes\nnecessary to the construction of a radio tower completely\nunconnected to federal funds) and United States v. Bigler, 907 F.\nSupp. 401, 402 (S.D. Fla. 1995) (sustaining indictment against\nfederalism and Tenth-Amendment attack, and finding § 666 a\nconstitutional exercise of, because necessary and proper to, the\nspending and general-welfare powers, without detailing any\nconnection to federal funds). See also United States v. Cantor,\n897 F. Supp. 110, 112–13 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (affirming the\nconstitutionality of § 666 under the spending power and against\nTenth-Amendment attack, and thus sustaining indictment of defendant\nwho had facilitated bribery of official of Board of Education,\nwithout detailing any connection to federal funds).\n\n                                 50\n\f     Lipscomb relies on United States v. Zwick,132 in which the\n\nThird Circuit declined to apply § 666 to conduct such as his:\n\n     Interpreting § 666 to have no federal interest\n     requirement produces serious concerns as to whether\n     Congress exceeded its power under the Spending Clause in\n     enacting this statute. See McCormack, 31 F. Supp. 2d at\n     187–89.    To pass muster under the Spending Clause,\n     legislation regulating behavior of entities receiving\n     federal funds must, among other things, be based upon a\n     federal interest in the particular conduct. See South\n     Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987). Applying § 666\n     to offense conduct, absent evidence of any federal\n     interest, would appear to be an unconstitutional exercise\n     of power under the Spending Clause.133\n\nTo avoid this supposed constitutional problem, the Zwick court\n\nbelieved that to read § 666 literally is to err, and held that\n\n“§ 666 requires that the government prove a federal interest is\n\nimplicated by the defendant’s offense conduct.”134    Not to require\n\na nexus, reasoned the Third Circuit, would erase significant\n\nfederal-state boundaries by turning § 666 into a general anti-\n\ncorruption law, which, in the Third Circuit’s view, Congress had\n\nnot intended.135\n\n     What then, under Zwick, would constitute a federal interest?\n\n“The amount of federal funds” alone, reasoned the Zwick court,\n\ncould constitute the interest if the federal funds provided “the\n\ngreater part of a township’s budget”; if not, the offense conduct\n\n     132\n           199 F.3d 672 (3d Cir. 1999).\n     133\n           Id. at 687 (parallel citations omitted).\n     134\n           Id.\n     135\n           Id. at 686.\n\n                                   51\n\fwould have to implicate a substantive or programmatic interest,\n\neven though “a highly attenuated implication of a federal interest\n\nwill suffice.”136     Since deciding Zwick, the Third Circuit has\n\nclarified that the federal interest can reach very deep into the\n\nranks of local government.137\n\n     In diametric opposition to the Third Circuit, two other\n\ncircuits have declined to read an extra-textual nexus into § 666.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit has rejected a constitutional attack on its pre-\n\nSalinas position that except for the textual $10,000 threshold,\n\n§ 666 does not require a nexus between federal funds and the\n\noffense conduct.138    The Supreme Court recently declined to review\n\n\n\n     136\n       Id.

In\n\nUnited States v. Santopietro,142 that court stood by its earlier\n\n\n       139\n             Suarez v. United States, 122 S. Ct. 1547 (2002) (mem.).\n       140\n             United States v. Grossi, 143 F.3d 348, 350 (7th Cir. 1998);\nid.:\n       Grossi wants us to say that, unless the program or\n       activity that was touched by bribery itself received\n       $10,000 in federal funds, the “circumstance described in\n       subsection (b)” does not obtain. Yet money is fungible\n       and its effect transcends program boundaries.        The\n       general assistance program has more to spend on welfare\n       (or dangle as a lure for bribes) if the federal\n       government meets some of the Township’s other expenses.\n            Congress has on occasion limited regulation to the\n       specific    activity   that    receives   the    federal\n       money. [Giving examples of statutory language] . . .\n       Section 666(b), by contrast, refers not to a “program or\n       activity” but to the “organization, government, or\n       agency.” The difference is palpable.\n       141\n       Id. at 350.    The court also stated that “the district\ncourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction is supplied by 18 U.S.C. § 3231\nand is secure.” Id. at 351.\n       142\n             United States v. Santopietro, 166 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n                                      53\n\frequirement of “at least some connection between the bribe and a\n\nrisk to the integrity of the federal [sic] funded program.”143 ——\n\nobviously a “corruption focus.” Nevertheless, the example that the\n\nSecond Circuit gave of bribery that § 666 would not reach —— a\n\nbribe paid to the hypothetical meat inspector of a city that\n\nreceived a federal grant only for its parks department —— involves\n\na   federal       interest   that   is   much    more   attenuated   from   the\n\nperpetrator than does this case.144             Furthermore, the Santopietro\n\ncourt affirmed the convictions of former officials of Waterbury,\n\nConnecticut, who had accepted bribes from real estate developers.145\n\nLinkage between the officials’ offense conduct and federal funds\n\nwas actually more remote than the connection in the instant case:\n\n      [C]orrupt payments were made by real estate developers to\n      secure the use of the appellants’ influence with city\n      agencies including the City Plan Commission, the Zoning\n      Commission, the Water Department, and the Fire Marshal,\n      and the use of their influence to further the interests\n      of the developers in the appointments of members and\n      chairpersons of land use boards and relevant committees\n      and agencies in the City of Waterbury.        During the\n      relevant periods, substantial federal funds were received\n      by Waterbury for housing, urban development, and other\n      programs within the purview of these agencies and\n      officials.     Since federal funds were received by\n      Waterbury for housing and urban development programs and\n      the corrupt payments concerned real estate transactions\n      within the purview of the agencies administering federal\n      funds, the requisite connection between the bribes and\n      the integrity of federally funded programs is satisfied.\n      Thus, this is not a case where the transactions sought to\n\n      143\n            Id. at 93.\n      144\n            Id.\n      145\n            Id. at 91.\n\n                                         54\n\f     be influenced concerned one department of a city and the\n     requisite $10,000 of federal funds were received by a\n     totally unrelated department.146\n\nSantopietro thus stands indisputably for a purview test: To be\n\nprosecuted under § 666, a bribed official must at least influence\n\nother officials who have within their purview federally funded\n\nprograms, but the corruption need not touch those programs.                In\n\nother words, Santopietro asks whether a defendant could have\n\ninfluenced   the   use   of   federal   funds    by   controlling   the   same\n\nagencies or staffers whom he actually corruptly influenced with\n\nrespect to purely local matters.\n\n     Such a purview test, applied to the case at bar, supports\n\nconvicting Lipscomb, who took bribes in return for influencing\n\nmatters within the purviews of two Dallas departments, human\n\nservices and transportation, which both received federal funds.\n\nThe connection between federal funds and corrupt conduct is closer\n\nhere than in Santopietro, where the court did not explain how the\n\n“City Plan Commission, the Zoning Commission, the Water Department,\n\nand the Fire Marshal” administered federal funds, but rather\n\nsuggested that these agencies and officials made decisions ——\n\npresumably determining whether proposed developments complied with\n\nzoning, fire, and other codes147 —— with respect to housing and\n\n     146\n       Id. at 93–94 (emphasis           added;    citations   and   internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n     147\n       See United States v. Santopietro, 996 F.2d 17, 18 (2d Cir.\n1993) (prior merits appeal) (“Benefits to certain bankers and land\ndevelopers included zoning changes, subdivision approvals,\n\n                                    55\n\furban development programs, likely administered by other agencies,\n\nthat did receive federal funds.148            In other words, the federal\n\ninterest in Santopietro was more remote than it is here, as\n\nLipscomb himself cast votes to approve requests for federal funds,\n\nand himself both lobbied and pressured officials who ran federally-\n\nfunded programs.\n\n       A less cumbersome and more direct purview rule would apply\n\n§ 666 to defendants who themselves influence or control federal\n\nfunds.149      Such a rule also would support convicting Lipscomb here.\n\nThe Santopietro court, however, did not affirmatively adopt this\n\nrule, explicitly leaving open the question whether the former mayor\n\ncould be prosecuted under § 666 for any transaction involving the\n\ncity    if     the   federal   funds   were   entirely   unrelated   to   that\n\ntransaction.150 Santopietro, therefore, although confirming a nexus\n\n\nconfidential appraisal information for use in bidding on city-owned\nproperty, expedited treatment from city agencies, and input into\nappointments.”).\n       148\n             Santopietro, 166 F.3d at 93.\n       149\n       This may be the rule in the Fourth Circuit, which has\nsummarized § 666 as banning “payoffs to state and local officials\nwho influence the distribution of federal funds.” United States v.\nJennings, 160 F.3d 1006, 1012 (4th Cir. 1998).       However, the\noffense conduct in Jennings clearly involved federally funded\nprograms: the bribed official gave federally funded housing-\nconstruction contracts to the briber. Id. at 1010–12.\n       150\n         Santopietro, 166 F.3d at 94 n.3:\n       We need not consider whether Santopietro’s role as\n       mayor——the chief executive officer of the city and hence\n       the officer ultimately responsible for all city\n       departments——would render the statute applicable to\n       corrupt payments received by him for any transaction\n\n                                        56\n\frule, also could be read as supporting Lipscomb’s conviction under\n\nsuch a rule or (just possibly) as skirting the relevant question\n\nentirely.      Thus, of the two cases from other circuits —— Zwick and\n\nSantopietro —— that Lipscomb relies on heavily, only Zwick could\n\nsupport finding § 666 unconstitutional as applied here.\n\nD.   Federal Interests at Stake\n\n     My      own   review   is   guided    by   the   traditional,   rational-\n\nrelationship test for whether a statute is necessary and proper to\n\nan enumerated federal power.151 In this case, two federal interests\n\nsupport the view that Congress reasonably could have thought it\n\nnecessary and proper to apply § 666 to agents and officials like\n\nLipscomb.\n\n     1.       Absolute Amount of Federal Dollars\n\n     The government argues that the total federal funding received\n\nby Dallas —— $56 million in 1998 —— justified federal jurisdiction\n\nover Lipscomb’s conduct.          Lipscomb focuses on the fact that $56\n\nmillion was only 3.5% of Dallas’s city budget in that year.                 In\n\npart, this is a dispute over the meaning of one passage in Zwick:\n\n     We can conceive of several ways in which the government\n     could prove a federal interest in a § 666 [case].... The\n     amount of federal funds could provide the requisite\n     federal implication, even if the purpose of those funds\n     has no explicit relationship to the subject of the bribe.\n     If, for example, in a given year, the greater part of a\n\n\n     involving the city, even though the federal funds were\n     received for a program entirely unrelated to the program\n     in connection with which the corrupt payments were made.\n     151\n           See TRIBE, supra note 65, § 5–3, at 798–802, 805.\n\n                                          57\n\f      township’s budget came from federal funds, bribery of a\n      township agent for any purpose might be said to implicate\n      federal interests.152\n\nIn   the     abstract,    this    “greater    part”   yardstick    may    have    an\n\nappealing ring, but it is utterly divorced from reality.                          In\n\nactuality, no state government and, I suspect, only a rare county\n\nor city government (not even the District of Columbia), is so\n\nwholly a creature of the United States as to rely on Washington for\n\n“the greater part” of its revenue.153           In the rare case that federal\n\nfunding       is   a   majority    of   total   revenue,    federal      power    to\n\ncriminalize local corruption would undoubtedly exist; but surely\n\nthe absolute level of federal grants, as well as their relative\n\nimportance to the city’s budget, would provide a federal interest,\n\nto the protection of which § 666 is necessary and proper.\n\n      To determine whether this is so —— to judge if § 666 is indeed\n\nreasonably related to the federal interest in safeguarding $56\n\nmillion —— I would analogize the federal government and Dallas to\n\npartners in spending federal dollars to advance shared goals.                     In\n\nthe private sector, what would a reasonable funding partner who has\n\nadvanced $56 million do after learning that its service partner\n\ntakes       kickbacks,    albeit    regarding     matters    not    within       the\n\n      152\n            Zwick, 199 F.3d at 687.\n      153\n        See U.S. BUREAU OF THE CENSUS, U.S. DEP’T OF COMMERCE, STATISTICAL\nABSTRACT OF THE UNITED STATES: 2001, tables 435, 437, 439, 445, 447\n(121st ed. 2001) (showing total revenue and federal revenue of the\nstates and the largest cities and counties by population). None of\nthe states, and none of the cities and counties listed, relies on\nthe federal government for a majority of its revenue.\n\n                                         58\n\fpartnership’s scope?      The funding partner might well dissolve the\n\npartnership rather than wait for the service partner’s corruption\n\nto widen and infect partnership dealings.\n\n      The partnership analogy does not bear close inspection, but\n\nits failure, instead of undermining the constitutionality of § 666,\n\nactually supports it.     The analogy founders on the fact that in the\n\npublic sector, states, counties, and municipalities hold monopolies\n\non delivering many governmental services to their citizens.          Thus,\n\nwhen Congress seeks to benefit the citizenry of a particular state\n\nand locality, it can turn to very few potential public partners.\n\nThis scarcity suggests that if the federal-Dallas partnership were\n\ndissolved when corruption among Dallas officials is discovered ——\n\nor if the federal government were to withhold funds in such a case\n\n—— the purpose of the federally funded programs would be defeated,\n\nand Congress would be prevented from using the spending power to\n\npromote the welfare of citizens of Dallas. The populace of Dallas,\n\nhowever, is by definition innocent of official corruption, and\n\nshould not suffer a cut in federally funded services on account of\n\nit.   The prospective specter of criminal sanctions against corrupt\n\nofficials   themselves,    rather   than   post-hoc,   fiscally   punitive\n\nmeasures against Dallas, is therefore a logical and appropriate\n\nsolution for local corruption that threatens —— even indirectly, as\n\nhere —— $56 million in federal funds.\n\n      The Council votes to apply for federal funds, to accept\n\nfederal funds, and to approve all large contracts, including those\n\n                                    59\n\finvolving federal funds.        Congress could rationally believe that\n\nthe integrity of $56 million of federal funds applied for by the\n\nCouncil —— particularly when the federal treasury is funding not\n\njust one or two projects but many —— suffices as a federal interest\n\nweighty     enough   to   justify   federal   criminal   jurisdiction   over\n\nCouncil members who are bribed with respect to local issues.\n\n     2.       The Integrity of State and Local Officials\n              with Authority over Federal Funds\n\n     A second federal interest at stake here is the integrity vel\n\nnon of federal programs and funds, regardless of the quantum or\n\nbudget percentage of funds at issue.             A corrupt state or city\n\nofficial who has real responsibility for, or often participates in,\n\nthe allocation of federal funds is a “threat to the integrity”154 of\n\nthose funds, even if they are not actually or directly infected by\n\nhis corruption.      Congress may legitimately view as necessary and\n\nproper the imposition of federal criminal liability for bribery, so\n\nas to ensure the honesty of state and local officials who have\n\nfederal funds in their purview or federal programs under their\n\nauthority.\n\n     Judge Smith advances two explicit arguments against such\n\nliability (neither of which, with respect, I find persuasive) and\n\none implicit argument that is defeated by the text of the statute\n\nand the facts of this case.            The implicit contention is that\n\nbribery of Lipscomb alone, apart from any of his fourteen council\n\n     154\n           Salinas, 522 U.S. at 61.\n\n                                      60\n\fcolleagues, cannot create a sufficient federal interest or nexus,\n\nbecause Lipscomb cannot act for the Council.   This argument might\n\nalso be grounded in the fact that, alone, one legislator does not\n\nadminister program funds.    The text of § 666 disposes of this\n\nargument, as a statutory matter, because Congress clearly sought to\n\napply § 666 to legislative-branch officials.155 As a constitutional\n\nmatter, there is little or no basis for holding that federal\n\njurisdiction over bribery of Council members depends on whether the\n\nbriber can command a majority.    One Council member’s vote, after\n\nall, can tip the balance on a close question; and, as Lipscomb’s\n\nconduct here demonstrates, a member has a number of arrows in his\n\nparliamentary quiver besides the final vote.\n\n     Judge Smith also speculates that the State of Texas would have\n\nprosecuted Lipscomb had it known of the evidence against him.   This\n\nis not a constitutional argument; it merely begs the constitutional\n\nquestion regarding the limits of the spending power.156    And, as\n\n     155\n       Lipscomb is an “agent” under the statute because he is an\n“officer” of Dallas. 18 U.S.C. § 666(d)(1) (2000). Even if he\nwere merely an agent of a “subdivision of the [ ] legislative...\nbranch of government,” the statute’s text would still cover him.\n18 U.S.C. § 666(d)(2) (2000).\n     156\n       See United States v. Bailey, 990 F.2d 119, 126 (4th Cir.\n1993) (citations omitted):\n          We find no merit to this claim.... [T]he Tenth\n     Amendment does not prohibit the federal government from\n     enforcing its laws, even when there are state laws\n     addressing the same criminal act.\n          . . .\n          Although South Carolina could have brought state\n     criminal charges against Bailey based upon the same\n     facts, this does not prevent the United States from\n\n                                 61\n\feither a positive or a normative statement —— that the federal\n\ngovernment either does or should leave such prosecutions to the\n\nstates —— it fails.       There are at least three reasons why federal\n\nrather than state bribery prosecutions might be necessary and\n\nproper in cases like Lipscomb’s.             First, the federal government\n\nmight have a greater incentive to prosecute than does the state\n\ngovernment,      either   because   the      offense    conduct      directly   or\n\npotentially affects federal funds or because the federal government\n\nprovides      more   money   to   the    locality      than   does    the   state\n\ngovernment.157       The latter proposition is true in this case: In\n\nterms of dollars provided to Dallas, the federal government has a\n\nstake in the city’s fiscal integrity that is between fifteen and\n\ntwenty times greater than the state’s stake.158\n\n     Second, federal officials might be less corruptible than state\n\n\n     enforcing its criminal statutes.\n     157\n       Both reasons were part of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s\nthinking in recommending that the Senate enact § 666. See S. REP.\nNO. 98-225 at 369, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3510:\n     In many cases, such prosecution is impossible because\n     title has passed to the recipient before the property is\n     stolen, or the funds are so commingled that the Federal\n     character of the funds cannot be shown. This situation\n     gives rise to a serious gap in the law, since even though\n     title to the monies may have passed, the Federal\n     Government clearly retains a strong interest in assuring\n     the integrity of such program funds. Indeed, a recurring\n     problem in this area (as well as in the related area of\n     bribery of the administrators of such funds) has been\n     that State and local prosecutors are often unwilling to\n     commit their limited resources to pursue such thefts,\n     deeming the United States the principal party aggrieved.\n     158\n           See Part I.B., supra (discussing jurisdictional facts).\n\n                                        62\n\fand local officials,159 and an informant with evidence of misconduct\n\nby a state or local official might feel safer in taking his\n\ninformation to federal authorities; indeed, he could even prefer\n\nthat it not be shared with state or local authorities.                  Third,\n\nfederal prosecutors are less likely to be linked to state and local\n\npoliticians and are generally more independent of local political\n\nforces that might try to protect high officials from aggressive\n\nstate enforcement.\n\n     Judge        Smith’s    second   contention    against    high-official\n\nliability is a law-and-economics argument that, in my opinion, does\n\nnot hold water and affords courts little basis, if any, on which to\n\npronounce     a    statute    unconstitutional,    whether   facially   or   as\n\napplied. As I understand his argument, it is that if courts permit\n\nthe United States as well as states to prosecute high local\n\nofficials for bribery involving local funds and programs, corrupt\n\nofficials will change their behavior and, on the margin, take more\n\nbribes directly related to federal funds and programs than they\n\notherwise would.160         With respect, I perceive at least three flaws\n\n     159\n       See RICHARD A. POSNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE LAW 698 (5th ed.\n1998) (emphasis added):\n     Some federal criminal jurisdiction can be explained by\n     reference to the point...that monopolies of political\n     power are more easily achieved at the state than at the\n     federal level. Federal criminal prosecutions of corrupt\n     local   government    officials     exploit    the    relative\n     incorruptibility of federal officials —— stemming from\n     the greater costs of corrupting a federal agency... —— in\n     order to reduce corruption at the local level.\n     160\n           See infra at ___.\n\n                                       63\n\fof logic in this argument.\n\n       First, social science has not yet proven that the rational-\n\nactor model adequately explains the real-world behavior of white-\n\ncollar       criminals:     As     behavioral     law    and   economics      warns     us,\n\ninadequate        information,       biases,     and    heuristics        often    prevent\n\nindividuals from acting rationally.                    For example, unless a local\n\nofficial        is   well   integrated      into    a     culture    of    white-collar\n\ncriminality (which would itself suggest that federal prosecution\n\nmay    be     necessary),     he    will   lack    even    anecdotal       data    on   the\n\nprobability that either the state or the federal government will\n\ndetect and prosecute bribery. (Anecdotal data would, of course, be\n\nthe only data available.)                  Therefore, an official considering\n\nwhether to take a bribe would not be likely to calculate the odds\n\nof detection or prosecution in the dispassionately mathematical way\n\nthat the rational-actor model might suggest.\n\n       Furthermore,         standard    law-and-economics           analysis      actually\n\njustifies federal criminal jurisdiction on the basis of interstate\n\nexternalities, an argument eminently applicable here.161 If bribery\n\nin    Dallas     threatens       federally-provided        funds,     that   corruption\n\nthreatens the federal Treasury, which is funded by taxes collected\n\nnot just from Texas but from all across the Nation.\n\n       Lastly and most importantly, even if Judge Smith’s law-and-\n\neconomics objection to federal jurisdiction here were an accurate\n\n\n       161\n             See POSNER, supra note 120, at 697.\n\n                                            64\n\fpredictor, it has little force. The most that his prediction might\n\nprove is that Congress has deluded itself into passing a law that\n\nmay be self-defeating, because it increases the vulnerability of\n\nfederal funds to corruption and thus disregards economic facts.\n\n“But a law can be both economic folly and constitutional.”162                  A\n\nmeans-ends tradeoff, weighing costs against benefits, is precisely\n\nthe sort    of   political    judgment     that    members    of   Congress   are\n\nentitled —— and better equipped than judges —— to make, and that\n\ncourts should generally defer to.          As judges, we do not experience\n\nthe perils attendant on taxing one’s own constituents, do not enjoy\n\nthe political significance of bringing home the fiscal bacon, and\n\ndo not share the frustration of seeing hard-won federal dollars\n\nbleed off through the hands of corrupt local officials.                 Lacking\n\nthe power to tax and spend, federal judges should defer to a\n\nplausible   risk-reward      construct     that    Congress   has   enacted   to\n\nprotect the federal fisc.\n\nE.   Constitutional Limits to § 666?\n\n     Lipscomb    strongly    argues   that    if    §   666   constitutionally\n\ncriminalizes conduct like his by state and local agents, then there\n\nare no limits to its sweep, and federal criminal law extends to\n\nbriberies totally removed from federal funds.             As I have analyzed\n\nLipscomb’s constitutional challenge to the statute as it applies to\n\nhim, I need not determine here whether there is a constitutional\n\n     162\n       CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, 481 U.S. 69, 96–97\n(1987) (Scalia, J., concurring).\n\n                                      65\n\flimit on § 666’s reach.       A brief comment is nonetheless in order.\n\n     As a statutory matter, even Westmoreland —— our broadest (and\n\ncontrolling) reading of § 666 —— did not address whether § 666 can\n\nreach      the   lowest   levels   of   state   and   local   bureaucracies.\n\nWestmoreland did, however, advert to the limits in the statute’s\n\ntext:\n\n     [T]he statute does not encompass every local bribery as\n     Westmoreland suggests.     Although the extent of the\n     federal government’s assistance programs will bring many\n     organizations and agencies within the statute’s scope,\n     the statute limits its reach to entities that receive a\n     substantial amount of federal funds and to agents who\n     have the authority to effect significant transactions.163\n\n     As a constitutional matter, under the Necessary and Proper\n\nClause, the test is whether prosecution would be rationally related\n\nto a federal interest —— that is, to effecting Congress’s spending\n\npower.      In this case, two already-noted federal interests justify\n\napplying § 666 to Lipscomb’s conduct: (1) the total amount of\n\nfederal funds extended to Dallas and (2) Lipscomb’s purview —— his\n\nhigh rank and his broad influence over many programs that receive\n\nfederal funds.       Of these two interests, his purview would easily\n\naccommodate, in another case, the Second Circuit’s hypothetical\n\nimplication in Santopietro that it could not be necessary and\n\nproper to the spending power for federal criminal liability to\n\nextend to a corrupt city meat inspector when the city receives\n\n\n\n\n     163\n           Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 578.\n\n                                        66\n\ffederal funds only for its parks.164    That case is not before us\n\ntoday, however, so I need not predict, in double dicta, whether\n\nthere might be categories of prosecutions under § 666 that are not\n\nnecessary and proper to the spending power.     For today’s purposes\n\nit is sufficient to note that if there are such categories,\n\nLipscomb is far removed from them.\n\nF.   Conclusion\n\n     The constitutional argument in this case boils down to how\n\ndirect must local corruption’s threat to federal funds be for § 666\n\nto apply.   Lipscomb insists that, although federal funds need not\n\nbe directly involved in the offense conduct, the state or local\n\nofficial’s conduct still must threaten the integrity of federal\n\nfunds more directly than did his.    Not so.   The foregoing analysis\n\nhas shown that (1) the text of § 666 reads otherwise; (2) the\n\nlegislative history does not clearly contradict it (as it must to\n\noverride a clear criminal statute165); and (3) our controlling\n\nprecedents on point reject such a limit.        Reduced to the bare\n\n\n     164\n       Santopietro, 166 F.3d at 93. Meat inspection is very much\na federal responsibility, however, and the Second Circuit may have\noverlooked the Federal Meat Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. § 601 et\nseq., especially 21 U.S.C. § 622 (banning bribery of meat\ninspectors employed by the United States).\n     165\n       Salinas, 522 U.S. at 57 (“Courts in applying criminal laws\ngenerally must follow the plain and unambiguous meaning of the\nstatutory language.    Only the most extraordinary showing of\ncontrary intentions in the legislative history will justify a\ndeparture from that language.”) (quoting United States v.\nAlbertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680 (1985)) (further citations, internal\nquotation marks, and brackets omitted).\n\n                                67\n\fessentials, application of § 666 to Lipscomb’s conduct is indeed\n\nreasonably related to a federal interest, and thus is necessary and\n\nproper to Congress’s exercise of its spending power.                Congress\n\ncould have believed, quite legitimately, that preventing federal\n\nfunds from passing through state and local legislative bodies whose\n\nmembers   are   corrupt,   and    to    do   so   with   the   deterrent   of\n\ncriminalizing the legislators’ corruption, even with respect to\n\npurely state or local issues, was necessary and proper to the\n\nfederal spending power.    As courts can require of Congress nothing\n\nmore than such a rational relationship to the spending power, § 666\n\nis constitutional as applied here.\n\n                                 VII. VENUE\n\n     Having established that the federal courts have jurisdiction\n\nof this case, we turn to Lipscomb’s assignments of reversible error\n\nby the district court.     Chief among these is his contention that\n\nthe court abused its discretion in transferring the trial from\n\nDallas to Amarillo sua sponte, shortly before trial, and over\n\nLipscomb’s objection.\n\nA.   The Transfer Order\n\n     The district court read its unexpected transfer order into the\n\nrecord at the end of a hearing on December 20, 1999.              The order\n\nreads, nearly in its entirety:\n\n     As everyone knows this case will involve the trial of one\n     of the best[-]known sitting elected officials in the\n     Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex for allegations of public\n     corruption. This Court cannot recall such a trial of a\n     sitting elected official in Dallas for allegations of\n\n                                       68\n\fpublic corruption.     This case has already received\nsignificant media attention and undoubtedly will receive\nmore.\n      The Court notes that both sides have requested or\nnot opposed requests for individual voir dire examination\nof the prospective jury panel and both sides have\nrequested use of a jury questionnaire. Both motions,\nunusual and rare motions in federal criminal cases in\nDallas, are made precisely because of the high profile of\nDefendant Lipscomb, a Dallas City Councilman of twelve\nyears[’] experience and one of the most influential and\nwell[-]known political leaders in the Dallas African[-\n]American community for the last three decades.\nCouncilman Lipscomb has been an effective representative\nof his constituency and locally has strong supporters and\ndetractors. These facts will obviously make selection of\na jury of twelve with no preconceived opinions about Al\nLipscomb no easy task.\n      As stated this case has thus far generated\nsubstantial publicity in the local media and will\ngenerate more throughout the trial. Such coverage has\nresulted in the Court reading in the newspapers certain\ninformation that has been filed under seal. The Court is\nalso concerned about the ability to select a fair and\nimpartial jury.\n      In considering the various motions regarding jury\nselection that both sides have filed[,] the Court is not\nconvinced that such measures would be sufficient to\nassure Councilman Lipscomb, the other defendants, and the\nGovernment a fair trial.     It is this Court’s fervent\ndesire and absolute obligation to see to it that a fair\ntrial is conducted —— fair to both the defendants and the\nGovernment. This Court will do all in its power under\nthe law to make sure the verdict in this case is based on\nthe evidence presented in the courtroom, and absolutely\nnothing else.\n      There is no “divisional” venue in criminal cases\nunder Federal Criminal Rule [sic] of Procedure 18. Since\nthe 1966 amendment of this rule[,] providing for\nprosecution to be had in the district in which the\noffense was committed, a division of a federal judicial\ndistrict is no longer a unit of venue in criminal cases.\nUnited States vs. Burns, 662 F.2d 1378 (11th Cir., 1981);\nZicarelli vs. Gray, 543 F.2d 466 (3rd Cir., 1976).\nWithin[-]district transfers of criminal cases are allowed\nunder the law in this circuit.        See United States\nvs.[ ]Bridges, 551 F.2d 651 (5th Cir. 1977) and United\nStates vs. James, 528 F.2d 999 (5th Cir. 1976), cert.\ndenied, 97 S.Ct. 382, 770. Indeed, this Court disposed\n\n                           69\n\f     of all criminal cases filed in the Wichita Falls Division\n     of the Northern District of Texas (about 100 cases) over\n     a 4 ½ year period (1994 to 1999) in the Dallas Division\n     of the Northern District of Texas. The law is clear that\n     in the Court’s sound discretion, after considering the\n     statutory elements, which this Court has done, this case\n     may be tried anywhere within the Northern District of\n     Texas.\n          Amarillo is a good[-]size[d] city[,] serviced by\n     several airlines and is only a five[-]hour drive from\n     Dallas. No defendant is indigent and all have retained,\n     as opposed to appointed, council [sic]. The Court has\n     made a careful analysis and given due consideration of\n     the convenience of the witnesses and the parties, and\n     considered the prompt administration of justice. These\n     considerations, coupled with the concerns for selection\n     of an impartial jury as expressed by the parties in their\n     pretrial motions, as well as all the concerns the Court\n     has expressed above, causes [sic] the Court to find that\n     the prompt administration of justice would best be\n     effectuated by having the trial of this case in the\n     Amarillo Division of the Northern District of Texas.\n          ...\n          The Court is absolutely convinced that the prompt\n     administration of justice will best be served by\n     conducting this trial in Amarillo, where it is unlikely\n     [sic] that few, if any on the jury panel will have ever\n     heard of Al Lipscomb or Floyd Richards, and fewer still,\n     if any[,] will have any preconceived ideas or opinions\n     about them. This will help assure that the jury verdict\n     is based on the merits of the evidence presented in the\n     courtroom, and nothing else.\n\nBefore the issuance of this order, no party had presented evidence\n\nregarding prejudice from pretrial publicity or regarding any other\n\nissue relative to venue.   On hearing the order read, lawyers for\n\nLipscomb and his co-defendant, Richards, objected.   Lipscomb filed\n\nwritten objections nine days later —— objections on which the court\n\ndid not rule before the trial began, as long scheduled, on January\n\n11, 2000, in Amarillo, some three hundred miles from Dallas.\n\n     In a motion for a new trial following his conviction, Lipscomb\n\n\n                                70\n\frenewed his objections to the venue transfer, which motion the\n\ndistrict court later denied.              Also after trial, the government\n\nfiled thirty-seven newspaper articles about Lipscomb’s case that\n\nhad appeared from March through December 19, 1999, as well as other\n\narticles that appeared after the transfer order —— none of which\n\nhad been in the record when the transfer order issued and none of\n\nwhich were so much as mentioned by the district court.\n\nB.     Standard of Review: Abuse of Discretion\n\n       We review all questions concerning venue under the abuse of\n\ndiscretion          standard.166    In   general,     “[a]    district   court      by\n\ndefinition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.”167\n\nA district court also abuses its discretion if it “bases its\n\ndecision ... on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.”168\n\nAs a leading treatise on standards of review suggests, a trial\n\ncourt abuses its discretion “when the judge has considered the\n\nwrong factors in applying his discretion (the judgment call was\n\nmade    as     to    issues   or   factors     not   within   the   scope   of     his\n\ndiscretionary powers).”169\n\n\n\n       166\n       United States v. Asibor, 109 F.3d 1023, 1037 (5th Cir.\n1997); United States v. Alvarado, 647 F.2d 537, 539 (5th Cir. Unit\nA June 1981).\n       167\n             Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 100 (1996).\n       168\n             Esmark Apparel, Inc. v. James, 10 F.3d 1156, 1163 (5th Cir.\n1994).\n       169\n       1 STEVEN ALAN CHILDRESS & MARTHA S. DAVIS, FEDERAL STANDARDS         OF   REVIEW\n§ 4.01(A) (3d ed. 1999).\n\n                                          71\n\f     Reversal of an intradistrict transfer is proper only if a\n\nparty    demonstrates   a   “substantial   ground   for   overturning   the\n\ndistrict court’s decision.”170     In the typical case, the defendant\n\nappeals the trial court’s denial of a Rule 18 motion to transfer\n\nvenue.     And, in the typical case, the defendant’s appeal is\n\nunsuccessful because the district court is “not [ ] required to\n\nmove the trial absent a strong showing of prejudice”171 to the\n\ndefendant.     Some of our cases suggest that this same strong-\n\nshowing-of-prejudice standard applies when, as here, the defendant\n\nseeks to block a transfer.172       When the government is the party\n\nseeking a transfer, however, at least one case appears to require\n\nthat the government have a “legitimate reason” for doing so.173\n\n\n     170\n       United States v. Dickie, 775 F.2d 607, 609 (5th Cir. 1985),\nabrogated in part on other grounds, 37 F.3d 160 (5th Cir.1994),\n(brackets omitted) (citing United States v. Malmay, 671 F.2d 869,\n876 (5th Cir. 1982)).\n     171\n       United States v. Duncan, 919 F.2d 981, 985 (5th Cir. 1990)\n(“An intradistrict transfer is not required absent a strong showing\nof prejudice.”); Malmay, 671 F.2d at 876. See also Dickie, 775\nF.2d at 609.\n     172\n       See United States v. Osum, 943 F.2d 1394, 1399 (5th Cir.\n1991) (“[T]he transfer [requested by the government] may be granted\nwithin the trial court’s discretion unless the defendant shows that\na transfer would be prejudicial.”). Osum cited only Duncan for\nthis proposition, but Duncan actually involved a transfer motion\nmade by the defendant. Duncan, 919 F.2d at 985. Osum also stated\nthat “[W]e cannot in this case, given the existence of a valid\nreason supporting transfer and no showing of prejudice by the\ndefendant, say that the district court abused its discretion.”\nOsum, 943 F.2d at 1400.\n     173\n       Osum, 943 F.2d at 1400 (finding that the transferee judge’s\nfamiliarity with the conspiracy alleged in the case was a\n“legitimate reason”).\n\n                                    72\n\fHere, however, neither the government nor the defense sought\n\ntransfer.\n\nC.   Analysis\n\n     We      must   begin    our   analysis   by   recognizing an important\n\ndistinction between intradistrict and interdistrict transfers: Only\n\nan interdistrict transfer implicates the Constitution.174            There is\n\nno basis for inferring the existence of a constitutional right to\n\ntrial within the division where a criminal defendant lives or where\n\na crime was committed.175           In one intradistrict transfer case,\n\nhowever, we interpreted the Sixth Amendment to mean that “it is the\n\npublic policy of this Country that one must not arbitrarily be\n\nsent, without his consent, into a strange locality to defend\n\nhimself      against   the   powerful   prosecutorial    resources    of   the\n\nGovernment.”176\n\n     The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure also distinguish\n\nbetween interdistrict and intradistrict transfers. Rule 21 governs\n\ntransfers to another district and provides that this may be done\n\n\n\n\n     174\n           See U.S. CONST. art. 3, § 2, cl. 3; U.S. CONST. amend. VI.\n     175\n       United States v. James, 528 F.2d 999, 1021 (5th Cir. 1976)\n(noting that the Sixth Amendment makes “no reference to a division\nwithin a judicial district”); Lafoon v. United States, 250 F.2d\n958, 959 (5th Cir. 1958).\n     176\n       Dupoint v. United States, 388 F.2d 39, 44 (5th Cir. 1967)\n(interpreting a prior version of Rule 18 that did not allow for an\nintradistrict transfer for the prompt administration of justice).\n\n                                        73\n\fonly on motion of the defendant.177       Rule 18, in contrast, governs\n\nintradistrict transfers:\n\n     Except as otherwise permitted by statute or by these\n     rules, the prosecution shall be had in a district in\n     which the offense was committed. The court shall fix the\n     place of trial within the district with due regard to the\n     convenience of the defendant and the witnesses and the\n     prompt administration of justice.178\n\nAlthough the text of Rule 18 refers only to convenience and prompt\n\nadministration, the district court may consider other factors.179\n\n\n\n     177\n       FED. R. CRIM. P. 21(a):\n     For Prejudice in the District. The court upon motion of\n     the defendant shall transfer the proceeding ... to\n     another district ... if the court is satisfied that there\n     exists in the district where the prosecution is pending\n     so great a prejudice against the defendant that the\n     defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial ... in\n     that district.\nSee also FED. R. CRIM. P. 21(b) (“For the convenience of parties and\nwitnesses, and in the interest of justice, the court upon motion of\nthe defendant may transfer the proceeding ... to another\ndistrict.”).\n     178\n           FED. R. CRIM. P. 18.\n     179\n       See 2 CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE Crim § 305,\nat 339–40 & n.11 (3d ed. 2000 & supp. 2002) (collecting cases)\n(“There is now substantial authority for the proposition that the\ncourt . . . may take into account numerous factors appearing in the\nparticular case.”). Compare FED. R. CRIM. P. 18 advisory committee’s\nnotes to 1979 amendments:\n     The amendment to rule 18 does not eliminate either of the\n     existing considerations which bear upon fixing the place\n     of trial within a district, but simply adds yet another\n     consideration in the interest of ensuring compliance with\n     the Speedy Trial Act of 1974. The amendment does not\n     authorize the fixing of the place of trial for yet other\n     reasons. Cf. United States v. Fernandez, 480 F.2d 726\n     (2d Cir. 1973) (court in the exercise of its supervisory\n     power held improper the fixing of the place of trial “for\n     no apparent reason other than the convenience of the\n     judge”).\n\n                                    74\n\fIn this case, the court mentioned several, which we shall evaluate\n\nin turn, and we shall rule out others that are not relevant here.\n\n     1.       Convenience\n\n     Rule 18’s “due regard to the convenience of the defendant and\n\nthe witnesses” militates strongly against transfer in this case.\n\nThe record shows that the defendant and all witnesses resided in\n\nDallas.      In addition, every defense attorney practiced there, and\n\nthe judge was based in Dallas.             Not a single relevant event\n\noccurred outside Dallas.180 As “convenience of the prosecution...is\n\nnot a factor to consider in changing venue,”181 the convenience\n\nfacts rarely cut as totally against transfer as they did here.\n\n     The district court did not mention these contra-transfer facts\n\nin its order.     It merely noted that Amarillo was served by several\n\nairlines, that it was a five hours’ drive from Dallas, and ——\n\nperhaps inaccurately and irrelevantly —— that the defendants were\n\nrepresented by “retained” counsel.182       These facts, of course, did\n\n     180\n       This case is thus readily distinguishable from United States\nv. Gourley, 168 F.3d 165 (5th Cir. 1999), where we found no abuse\nof discretion when the Southern District of Texas transferred a\ntrial from the Houston division to the Laredo division. Some of\nthe defendant’s witnesses were in Houston, id. at 171, suggesting\nthat convenience in that case may have cut in favor of Houston; but\nan element of the offense conduct —— conspiracy to import cocaine\n—— took place “at the border near Laredo,” and the crime in\nprogress was detected in both Laredo and Houston. Id. at 167.\n     181\n           Dickie, 775 F.2d at 610.\n     182\n       Although Lipscomb was not represented by court-appointed\nlawyers, the trial court’s use of “retained” connotes that Lipscomb\nwas paying his lawyers’ fees. The record clearly shows, however,\nthat Lipscomb faced large legal bills, lacked the means of his own\n\n                                      75\n\fnot   diminish   the   basic   truth    that   trial   in     Amarillo   was\n\ninconvenient for Lipscomb, his counsel, and all witnesses.               This\n\ncase is, therefore, easily distinguishable from the two cases on\n\nwhich the district court relied, because convenience did not\n\nmilitate against transfer in either of them.183        Those cases do not\n\nsupport the court’s sua sponte transfer here, and the trial court\n\nerred as a matter of law in relying on them.\n\n      2.    Court Policy\n\n      The trial court also referred to its prior transfers of “about\n\n100 [criminal] cases” from Wichita Falls to Dallas (less than half\n\nthe distance, we note, as Dallas to Amarillo).              This historical\n\nfact, however, does not support the transfer at issue.           Nothing in\n\nthe record shows why those transfers took place. Such reference to\n\nthe court’s prior venue practice verges on circularity and runs the\n\nrisk of creating a per se rule that violates Rule 18’s focus on the\n\n\n\n\nto pay them (partly because Dallas city council members are not\npaid a salary), and resorted to fundraising.     One article also\nstated that Lipscomb’s lead defense lawyer had placed himself last\nin line for whatever money Lipscomb might manage to raise.\n      183\n       See James, 528 F.2d at 1003, 1021–22 (showing that\nconvenience did not militate against transfer because six of the\nseven defendants did not even live in state, much less in the\ntransferring division, and four of the witnesses were in jail). In\nthe other case relied on by the district court, the defendants\nnever objected to the place of trial, which was only forty miles\nfurther from the place of the crime than the alternative\ncourthouse; inconvenience, if any, was slight. United States v.\nBridges, 551 F.2d 651, 652 & n.5 (5th Cir. 1977).\n\n                                   76\n\ffacts of each case.184          To whatever extent the district court\n\nperceived from past transfers a generalized but informal policy\n\nregarding transfers as a matter of course, without reference to the\n\npermissible considerations under Rule 18 that may have supported\n\nthose      transfers,   it    committed     legal   error   by    including   an\n\nimpermissible consideration in its Rule 18 balancing.\n\n     As      local   court    policy   is    irrelevant,    and    permissible\n\nconvenience considerations militated strongly against transfer to\n\nAmarillo, the issue becomes whether any other legitimate factors,\n\ndiscernible from the record as it stood when the order was made,\n\nsufficiently supported transfer to bring this one within the range\n\nof discretionary choices to which we must defer on appeal.\n\n     3.       Speedy Trial\n\n     The rule’s second textual factor —— “due regard to...the\n\nprompt administration of justice” —— is in part a literal command\n\nthat trials comply with the Speedy Trial Act.185                  This factor,\n\nhowever, did not support trial transfer in this case, as a review\n\nof the record shows.         Lipscomb was indicted on March 4, 1999, and\n\nhe appeared in court the next day.          Trial was initially set for May\n\n17, but Lipscomb moved for continuance.               The court refused to\n\ncontinue the trial date indefinitely, instead setting a hearing for\n\nMay at which counsel had to submit their schedules for the coming\n\n     184\n       See United States v. Burns, 662 F.2d 1378, 1382–83 (11th\nCir. Dec. 1981).\n     185\n           18 U.S.C. § 3161 (2000).\n\n                                       77\n\fmonths.      Counsel for Lipscomb had court engagements scheduled in\n\neach month from August through November of 1999, so at the hearing,\n\nall parties agreed on January 10, 2000, as the trial date.186\n\nLater, in November, the trial court extended the trial date one\n\nday, to January 11.        Early in December, 1999, Lipscomb filed\n\nanother motion to continue the trial, which motion the district\n\ncourt promptly denied.     When, on December 20, the district court\n\nunexpectedly ordered the transfer, the parties already knew that\n\n(1) trial was firmly set for January 11 and (2) there was no reason\n\nto expect that voir dire would not begin on that day.     Nothing in\n\nthe record suggests that facilities appropriate for the trial were\n\nunavailable in Dallas at that time.      There were thus no speedy-\n\ntrial issues in this case.\n\n     The district court did characterize the possibility of a\n\ndifficult voir dire as an obstacle to “prompt administration.”    We\n\ndo not understand the term “prompt administration” to have been\n\npromulgated in the Rules with the intention of permitting courts to\n\navoid even attempting arduous voir dire proceedings.     Rather, the\n\ntriggering purpose of the “prompt administration” amendment to Rule\n\n18 was to clarify that district courts are authorized to fix the\n\nplace of trial so as to comply with the Speedy Trial Act.187    That\n\n\n     186\n       The scheduling order determined, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3161(h)(8)(A) and (B)(iv), that the ends of justice would be best\nserved by the new trial date.\n     187\n           See note 137.\n\n                                  78\n\fAct concerns itself solely with the timeliness of when trial\n\nbegins, not with when either voir dire or the entire trial will\n\nconclude,188 and in this circuit, trial is deemed to begin with voir\n\ndire.189    Because the transfer to Amarillo did not change, much less\n\nhasten, the already-scheduled start of the trial, the transfer did\n\nnot accomplish the “prompt administration” of this case in the\n\ntextual, speedy-trial sense.\n\n     Nevertheless,     we   have   held    that   a   trial   court,   in   its\n\ndiscretion, may fix the place of trial with regard to factors other\n\nthan convenience and prompt administration: such factors commonly\n\ninclude, but are not necessarily limited to, docket management,\n\ncourthouse space and security, and —— most importantly for this\n\ncase —— pretrial publicity.\n\n     4.       Docket Management\n\n     In the context of docket management, we have construed the\n\nterm “prompt administration of justice” to refer not just to the\n\nparticular case that may be transferred, but also to other trials\n\non the court’s docket.190         A district court may consider docket\n\nmanagement in its Rule 18 balancing, and docket issues may even\n\n\n\n\n     188\n           See 18 U.S.C. § 3161.\n     189\n           United States v. Howell, 719 F.2d 1258, 1262 (5th Cir.\n1983).\n     190\n           In re Chesson, 897 F.2d 156, 159 (5th Cir. 1990).\n\n                                      79\n\foutweigh convenience factors that point entirely the other way.191\n\nBut nothing in the court’s remarks or in the record of this case\n\nsuggests that docket management was implicated here.\n\n     5.        Logistics\n\n     Another factor that a court may consider in fixing the place\n\nof trial within its district is whether a particular courthouse\n\nmeets      a   particular    trial’s    security   requirements   or   other\n\nfacilities needs.          Courtroom availability, unsurprisingly, is a\n\npermissible consideration.192          So too are the amount of jail space\n\navailable there for defendants or witnesses193 and the adequacy of\n\nsecurity arrangements in a particular criminal trial.194           Even so,\n\n\n     191\n       Thus, when the Western District of Louisiana was at two-\nthirds its authorized strength, and the trial judge not only\nresided in Monroe, Louisiana, but also had other civil and criminal\nmatters on his docket there, he did not abuse his discretion by\ntransferring an anticipated three-week trial there from Lake\nCharles, Louisiana, 150 miles away, over the defendants’ objections\nthat they, their witnesses, and their counsel lived and worked in\nthe Lake Charles area. Chesson, 897 F.2d at 157–59. In another\ncase, even though the offense was committed in Greenville,\nMississippi, and all the witnesses, counsel, and defendants were\nlocated there, the district court did not abuse its discretion by\nfixing the place of trial at Oxford, Mississippi, where the\ndistrict court had other cases scheduled. United States v. Harris,\n25 F.3d 1275, 1277–78 (5th Cir. 1994).\n     192\n       United States v. Faulkner, 17 F.3d 745, 757 & n.13 (5th Cir.\n1994) (listing courtroom availability as one of the considerations\nthat prevented an intradistrict transfer from rising to the level\nof plain error, which was the applicable standard of review because\ndefendants had failed to preserve error).\n     193\n           United States v. McKinney, 53 F.3d 664, 673 (5th Cir. 1995).\n     194\n      Harris, 25 F.3d at 1278 (“Rule 18 allows a court to consider\n‘the prompt administration of justice’ in fixing the place of\ntrial, and ‘matters of security clearly fall within that\n\n                                        80\n\fthe record and transfer order here are devoid of any indication\n\nthat such logistical considerations played any role in the transfer\n\nfrom Dallas to Amarillo, and no party argues to us that they did.\n\n     6.       Pretrial Publicity\n\n     Pretrial publicity, then, is the only factor that might\n\ncounterbalance convenience and render the transfer to Amarillo a\n\nproper exercise of discretion.               We have not delineated the quality\n\nor quantity of prejudicial publicity that will support a trial\n\ncourt’s      sua        sponte    transfer   in   the   face     of     countervailing\n\nconvenience factors. We have, however, defined the opposite end of\n\nthe zone of deference for interdistrict transfers:                         When pretrial\n\npublicity is the basis for a defendant’s motion to transfer to\n\nanother district under Rule 21, a trial court errs as a matter of\n\nlaw in denying such a motion only if the defendant can show that\n\npretrial publicity inflamed the jury pool, pervasively prejudiced\n\nthe community against the defendant, probatively incriminated the\n\ndefendant,         or     exceeded    “the   sensationalism         inherent     in   the\n\ncrime.”195\n\n     Here, the district court neither identified nor analyzed the\n\npublicity      that        it    conclusionally    relied      on     as    sufficiently\n\nprejudicial to require a highly inconvenient transfer over the\n\n\n\n\nconsideration.’”) (quoting FED.

Parker, 877 F.2d 327, 331 (5th Cir. 1989).\n\n                                             81\n\fdefendant’s objections.196         Indeed, until after the trial, the\n\nrecord did not even contain copies of the publicity at issue.\n\n(Notably, we have not found one criminal case in which the trial\n\ncourt inferred prejudice justifying a transfer from publicity of\n\nwhich it merely took judicial notice.197)            The court did nothing\n\nmore than globally label the unspecified publicity as “significant”\n\nand “substantial” and state that voir dire in Dallas would be “no\n\neasy task.”198      But surely, this is not the standard for determining\n\nwhether pretrial publicity renders a trial unfair.                The court’s\n\nlack    of      record   documentation    or   analysis   on   this   point   is\n\nparticularly troubling in light of our acknowledgment that “[e]very\n\nclaim of potential jury prejudice due to publicity must turn upon\n\nits own facts.”199\n\n       Despite the trial court’s statement to the contrary, it was\n\nnot that court’s duty, in ensuring a fair trial, to select “a jury\n\n\n\n       196\n       Although the court did state that the media had reported\nmaterial filed under seal, the only sealed material in the record\non appeal is Lipscomb’s pre-sentencing report. We therefore have\nno way of evaluating the prejudice of the reports to which the\ncourt referred and reviewing the court’s reasoning on this point.\n       197\n       The government points us to In re Agent Orange Product\nLiability Litigation, 818 F.2d 145, 169 (2d Cir. 1987), but that\nwas not a criminal case, and the court there took notice of the\npublicity to evaluate not prejudice among the venire pool but the\nsufficiency of notice to potential class members.\n       198\n       We are somewhat troubled by the implication in this remark\nthat, foreseeing a lengthy jury-selection process in Dallas, the\ncourt may have become concerned for its own convenience.\n       199\n             United States v. Aragon, 962 F.2d 439, 444 (5th Cir. 1992).\n\n                                         82\n\fof twelve with no preconceived opinions about Al Lipscomb.”            This\n\nsimply is not the applicable standard.         The law is actually much\n\nmore realistic:\n\n       Qualified jurors need not [ ] be totally ignorant of the\n       facts and issues involved.\n            “To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived\n       notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused,\n       without more, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of\n       a prospective juror’s impartiality would be to establish\n       an impossible standard. It is sufficient if the juror\n       can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a\n       verdict based on the evidence presented in court.”200\n\nA defendant’s right to a fair trial is violated only if he shows\n\nthat    “the   trial   atmosphere   was   ‘utterly   corrupted   by   press\n\ncoverage.’”201    Therefore, even if inflammatory pretrial publicity\n\ndid saturate the community, raising a presumption of prejudice to\n\nthe defendant, the government can usually rebut this presumption\n\nthrough voir dire that ferrets out such prejudice.202       In this case,\n\nto the extent that the district court focused on prejudice to the\n\ngovernment, it failed to give Lipscomb any opportunity to rebut\n\nthat presumption through voir dire.\n\n       The exception to this rebuttable-presumption rule regarding\n\nprejudicial publicity was announced by the Supreme Court in Rideau\n\n\n\n       200\n       Murphy v.

Louisiana,203        in   which    a   defendant’s     uncounselled,    taped\n\nconfession had been broadcast three times to two-thirds of a small\n\ncommunity,      rendering      the     venire    pool   presumptively   prejudiced\n\nagainst him, so that confirmation of this prejudice through voir\n\ndire was not necessary.204             From Rideau we derived the following\n\nrules for habeas cases:\n\n      where petitioner adduces evidence of inflammatory,\n      prejudicial pretrial publicity that so pervades or\n      saturates the community as to render virtually impossible\n      a fair trial by an impartial jury drawn from that\n      community, jury prejudice is presumed and there is no\n      further duty to establish bias.\n      ...\n           Given that virtually every case of any consequence\n      will be the subject of some press attention, however, the\n      Rideau principle of presumptive prejudice is only rarely\n      applicable, and is confined to those instances where the\n      petitioner can demonstrate an extreme situation of\n      inflammatory pretrial publicity that literally saturated\n      the community in which his trial was held.205\n\nDespite this standing caution against presuming prejudice, the\n\ntrial court in this case essentially created out of whole cloth a\n\nRideau exception for cases in which publicity is unfavorable to the\n\ngovernment and (we infer) jury nullification is possible.                   Even if\n\nsuch a rule were proper, however, the record of this case would not\n\nsupport its application.\n\n      Lipscomb contends that such a rule would not be proper, urging\n\n\n\n      203\n            373 U.S. 723 (1963).\n      204\n            Id. at 724.\n      205\n       Mayola v.

Essentially,     he   proposes   that\n\npublicity prejudicial to him may justify transfer, but publicity\n\nprejudicial to the government cannot.           To support this contention,\n\nhe points to the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 18, which state:\n\n     If the court is satisfied that there exists in the place\n     fixed for trial prejudice against the defendant so great\n     as to render the trial unfair, the court may, of course,\n     fix another place of trial within the district (if there\n     be such) where such prejudice does not exist. Cf. Rule\n     21 dealing with transfers between districts.206\n\nRule 21 —— which some courts find illuminative of Rule 18207 ——\n\nrequires an interdistrict transfer for prejudice if the defendant\n\nrequests it and the court determines that “there exists in the\n\ndistrict where the prosecution is pending so great a prejudice\n\nagainst the defendant that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and\n\nimpartial trial at any place fixed by law for holding court in that\n\ndistrict.”208\n\n     We cannot entirely accept Lipscomb’s suggested distinction,\n\nbecause we have in fact upheld a sua sponte intradistrict transfer\n\n—— to a division unrelated to the offense conduct, as here, and\n\n     206\n       FED.

Yet, as Lipscomb\n\ncorrectly notes, whenever we have upheld a sua sponte transfer over\n\nthe defendant’s objection (whether the prejudice from publicity was\n\nto the government or to the defendant), a mistrial had already\n\ndemonstrated     that    the   venire   pool   had   been   badly   tainted   by\n\npublicity and that retrial within the transferring division would\n\npose virtually insuperable difficulties.\n\n     Our most recent ruling to this effect, in United States v.\n\nGonzalez,209 exemplifies this pattern: The defendant’s first trial\n\nwas interrupted by two bomb threats and ended in a hung jury, and\n\nhis second trial ended in a mistrial after three jurors reported\n\nthat they received anonymous phone calls urging them to convict.210\n\n“[C]onsiderable publicity...from the first two trials” resulted.211\n\nUnder such easily distinguishable circumstances, the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in ordering an intradistrict transfer\n\nsua sponte.212      To the same effect are our decisions in United\n\nStates v. Weddell213 and United States v.

Faulkner215   involved     prosecution    of\n\nbusinessmen who developed condominium projects and in the process\n\nexhausted the funds of several savings and loan associations in the\n\nDallas area.216           The “I-30 scandal” generated 1,100 newspaper\n\narticles, an ad in a gubernatorial campaign mentioning a defendant\n\nin a negative light, and such a public awareness of the case that\n\n60% of Dallas residents had formed an opinion that one defendant\n\nwas guilty.217         After the first trial —— held in the Lubbock\n\ndivision of the Northern District —— ended in a mistrial, the trial\n\ncourt attempted voir dire in Dallas itself, but dismissed the panel\n\nafter several days because of the effect of pretrial publicity.218\n\nThe court then granted the defendants’ motions to transfer venue,\n\nmoving the case to the El Paso division of the Western District,\n\nwhere the trial court sua sponte transferred the case yet again, to\n\nthe Midland division of the same district.219             On appeal, given the\n\nunproblematical interdistrict transfer, we held that the second,\n\nsua sponte transfer did not amount to plain error.220\n\n     No      case    of    ours,   therefore,    stands    squarely   for   the\n\n\n\n     215\n           17 F.3d 745 (5th Cir. 1994).\n     216\n           Id. at 751–54, 756.\n     217\n           Id. at 756 & n.9.\n     218\n           Id. at 754.\n     219\n           United States v.

Alvarado.221                 Even a\n\ncursory      reading   of   Alvarado,    however,     shows   that   our      terse\n\ndiscussion of the transfer issue there is entirely silent on\n\nseveral key questions: (1) Did the district court in that case\n\ntransfer the case sua sponte; (2) if the transfer was sua sponte,\n\ndid the district court create a record that showed prejudice by\n\nanalyzing     publicity     or   by   attempting    voir   dire;   (3)   by   what\n\nstandard did the district court determine the publicity to be\n\nprejudicial; and (4) what was the nature of the publicity itself?222\n\nFrom the opinion, none of these issues appears to have been\n\ncontested.      As far as the Alvarado opinion goes, the defendants’\n\nargument       was     founded     entirely    on     a    mis-citation        and\n\n\n     221\n           647 F.2d 537 (5th Cir. Unit A June 1981).\n     222\n           Id. at 539–40.\n\n                                        88\n\fmisunderstanding of the criminal venue statutes.223               Research into\n\nthe district      court   case   confirms   not   only   that     the   Alvarado\n\ndefendants actually moved to transfer, but also that they asked\n\n(unsuccessfully) that a newspaper reporter be instructed not to\n\nprint anything concerning the rejection of a plea agreement, lest\n\nsuch publicity prejudice the case.224         The Alvarado district court\n\nheld an evidentiary hearing on the defendants’ motion to transfer\n\n“due to publicity in the area” and took the motion under advisement\n\nuntil after voir dire on publicity was concluded.225            At that point,\n\nthe district      court   denied   the   motion226;   but   the    court   later\n\nreconsidered that denial and granted the motion after a witness\n\ncaused a mistrial by testifying that defendants had pled guilty.227\n\n     All these facts provide context for, and render entirely\n\nunderstandable, the silence of our Alvarado opinion.                These facts\n\nalso completely distinguish Alvarado from this case: The Alvarado\n\n\n     223\n           Id. at n.4.\n     224\n       See proceedings in United States v. Martinez, No. Cr.

Tex., Brownsville Div.), particularly the docket sheet\nentries for 8/17/79 (motion regarding newspaper reporter made and\nrejected); 8/24/79 and 8/27/79 (motions to transfer made).\nMartinez was the caption of Alvarado in the district court until\nthe transfer of proceedings against fourteen defendants, at which\npoint the case became United States v. Alvarado, No. Cr. V-79-4\n(S.D. Tex., Victoria Div.) —— the case appealed to us.\n     225\n           Martinez, docket sheet at entry for 8/28/79.\n     226\n       Id. at entry for 8/30/79.

Rather than undermine\n\nour conclusion here, the Alvarado facts confirm our impression that\n\nthe transfer in the instant case was quite unusual.    Any court that\n\nviews Alvarado as trumping today’s holding under our rule of\n\norderliness will have been led into serious error.228\n\n     We have found only one case (from another circuit) that comes\n\nclose to supporting the proposition for which the government\n\ncontends, but that case ultimately is unpersuasive.        In United\n\nStates v. Mabry,229 a defendant moved for individual voir dire\n\nregarding pretrial publicity.230     The trial court interpreted this\n\nmotion as raising a concern about whether trial in the Albuquerque\n\ndivision of the district of New Mexico would be fair —— seemingly\n\n     228\n       The dissent’s reliance on two other cases is similarly\nmisplaced. United States v. Kaufman, 858 F.2d 994, 1006 (5th Cir.\n1988) is entirely irrelevant here, because docket management is, as\nwe have noted, a permissible factor in the Rule 18 balancing, but\none that is entirely absent from this record. The reasoning of the\nother Fifth Circuit case that the dissent relies on is also easily\nunderstood:\n     [T]the Southern District of Texas was the only district\n     in which (at least absent further evidence) venue was\n     initially proper as to all counts. While this does not\n     prevent a Rule 21(b) transfer of all counts to another\n     district, it is at least an indication that the\n     government's selection of the forum was not arbitrary.\n     We conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n     discretion in denying Fagan's Rule 21(b) motion.\nUnited States v. Fagan, 821 F.2d 1002, 1008 (5th Cir. 1987).\n     229\n           809 F.2d 671 (10th Cir. 1987).\n     230\n           Id. at 683.\n\n                                   90\n\fto the defendants, not to the government —— and transferred the\n\ncase, over the defendants’ objections, to Roswell,231 which we\n\nestimate to be some two hundred miles from Albuquerque.               On appeal,\n\nthe Tenth Circuit found no abuse of discretion: “There was no\n\nsubstantial inconvenience to the defendants or the witnesses as a\n\nresult      of   the    transfer   and        no   real   prejudice   has   been\n\ndemonstrated.”232\n\n     We discern several reasons not to follow the Mabry result\n\nhere.      First, the   Mabry district court did not appear to transfer\n\nthe case out of concern that the government receive a fair trial.\n\nTo this extent, Mabry actually supports Lipscomb’s contention on\n\nthat point.      Second, the cases on which the Tenth Circuit relied\n\nbuttress Mabry’s result only weakly, if at all.233              Third, Mabry’s\n\ntransfer holding has been largely ignored by other courts, perhaps\n\nbecause the Supreme Court later abrogated Mabry’s entrapment-\n\ninstruction holding.234      Mabry is thus hardly persuasive authority\n\n\n     231\n           Id.\n     232\n           Id.\n     233\n       See United States v. Raineri, 670 F.2d 702, 706 (7th Cir.\n1982) (finding no abuse of discretion where trial court refused to\ntransfer case to towns that lacked federal courthouses); Burns, 662\nF.2d at 1383 (reversing the trial court’s transfer order that was\nbased conclusionally on the district’s court’s policy of\nconsolidating criminal trials in one courthouse); United States v.\nYoung, 618 F.2d 1281, 1288 (8th Cir. 1980) (restating the general\nrule that a defendant has no constitutional right to be tried in a\nparticular district).\n     234\n       See United States v. Whalen, 976 F.2d 1346, 1348 n.1 (10th\nCir. 1992) (“Mabry has since been indirectly overruled by Mathews\n\n                                         91\n\fhere.\n\n       The district court here did not learn through hard experience\n\nthat voir dire would be challenging.               It developed no facts to\n\nsuggest that the pretrial publicity presumptively or actually\n\ntainted the jury pool; it failed to analyze the publicity itself\n\nfor prejudice; it applied a wrong and unrealistically high standard\n\nto determine whether the putative jury would be prejudiced; and it\n\nrelied on cases of ours that are not on point.                There is a plethora\n\nof    support   for   holding     that    the   district      court   abused      its\n\ndiscretion in transferring Lipscomb’s case to Amarillo.\n\n       7.   Summary\n\n       Both our precedents and persuasive authorities from other\n\ncourts suggest, even if only by negative implication, that this\n\ncase’s facts and proceedings make it a true outlier in the Rule 18\n\njurisprudence. In concluding that there was no abuse of discretion\n\nin the aforementioned cases, neither we nor the other courts have\n\npurported to fix any bright-line boundary of that discretion.                      We\n\nare   constrained     to   set    one    such   limit   by    example,     however,\n\nbelieving that the district court’s doctrinal mistakes and clear\n\nfactual errors make this case an appropriate vehicle with which to\n\ncircumscribe     at   least      one    boundary   of   the    use    of   Rule    18\n\ndiscretion.       When     as    here,    facts    of   convenience        militate\n\nexclusively against transfer, and no factor other than pretrial\n\n\nv. United States, 485 U.S. 58, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54\n(1988).”).\n\n                                         92\n\fpublicity —— some favorable and some unfavorable to both the\n\nprosecution and the defense —— might, if properly developed and\n\nanalyzed, militate in favor of transfer, the trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion under Rule 18 by ordering a far-distant intradistrict\n\ntransfer, sua sponte and over the defendant’s objections, without\n\n(1)   attempting   voir   dire   or     otherwise   creating   a   record,\n\n(2) providing an analysis of the publicity for the record to show\n\nhow it prejudiced the jury pool, or (3) conducting a Rideau-style\n\npresumptive analysis.     In this instance, we as an appellate court\n\ncan detect virtually nothing on the Rule 18 scale to counterbalance\n\nthe defendant’s established inconvenience; and something outweighs\n\nnothing every time.\n\n      Given the district court’s abuse of discretion, we must\n\nreverse Lipscomb’s conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for\n\na new trial in a venue determined consistently with this opinion.\n\n                           VIII. CONCLUSION\n\n      The trial court had jurisdiction to try Lipscomb for violating\n\n18 U.S.C. § 666, which is facially constitutional and —— in my own\n\nsole opinion —— is constitutional as applied to him.                As we\n\nconclude that the trial court abused its discretion in transferring\n\nLipscomb’s trial, however, we must reverse and remand for a new\n\ntrial. The other issues Lipscomb raises on appeal are either moot,\n\nmeritless, or irrelevant to a new trial.\n\nCONVICTION REVERSED, SENTENCE VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED for a new\n\ntrial.\n\n                                      93\n\f94\n\fDUHÉ, Circuit Judge, CONCURRING IN PART, DISSENTING IN PART:\n\n      I   write    separately        because,         although       I       concur       in   the\n\nconclusion reached by Judge Wiener that we must reverse Lipscomb’s\n\nconviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for a new trial, I\n\ncannot join his method of getting there. I adopt Judge Wiener’s\n\nfactual and procedural background sections; concur in the result\n\nbut not the reasoning of Part III; dissent from Parts IV, V, and\n\nVI; and concur in Part VII. I begin with an overview of the\n\nappropriate analytical framework.\n\n                              I. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\n      Judge Wiener’s opinion merges analysis of jurisdiction with\n\nanalysis of the constitutionality of § 666. In Part IV of his\n\nopinion, Judge Wiener writes that the term “federal jurisdiction”\n\nis   ambiguous,    and    defines         it    for    purposes       of      this    case      as\n\nencompassing (a) the question whether we have subject matter\n\njurisdiction under § 666 over Lipscomb’s conduct (which Judge\n\nWiener calls “adjudicative jurisdiction”), and (b) the question\n\nwhether Congress had the authority to enact § 666 (which Judge\n\nWiener     terms     “legislative               jurisdiction”,               and     we        term\n\nconstitutionality).       In       this    manner,      Judge       Wiener         reaches     the\n\nconstitutionality        of    §    666,       by    calling    it       a    jurisdictional\n\nquestion. With all due respect, this is a categorization with no\n\nsupport.\n\n      Jurisdiction       is    discussed        in    terms    of    “legislative”             and\n\n“adjudicative”     in    only      one     context     in     American         law    –    native\n\fAmerican law.235 This case does not arise in that context, so we\n\nmust     follow    the    generally     applied     definition   of   “federal\n\njurisdiction”.\n\n       Black’s    Law    Dictionary    defines    “federal   jurisdiction”    as\n\n“powers of federal courts founded on United States Constitution\n\n(Article III) and Acts of Congress (e.g. Title 28 of United States\n\nCode)”.236 Federal jurisdiction is not defined as the power of\n\nCongress to enact a statute. Professor Erwin Chemerinsky’s treatise\n\non the subject, widely regarded as comprehensive, not once mentions\n\nlegislative       jurisdiction    or   the   power    of   Congress   to   enact\n\nstatutes.237 The only discussion of congressional authority is\n\nCongress’       authority    to   control        federal   jurisdiction,     and\n\n\n       235\n        See Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438, 440, 117 S.Ct.\n1404, 1406, 137 L.Ed. 2d 661 (1997); Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v.\nLaPlante, 480 U.S. 9, 12, 107 S.Ct. 971, 974, 94 L.Ed. 2d 10\n(1987); Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Farley, 115 F.3d 1498, 1507 n.6 (10th\nCir. 1997); Louis v. United States, 967 F. Supp. 456, 459 (D. N.M.\n1997). Judge Wiener cites Justice Scalia’s dissenting opinion in\nHartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 113 S.Ct. 2891,\n125 L.Ed. 2d 612 (1993) as support for his contention that the term\n“jurisdiction” can mean both legislative and adjudicative\njurisdiction. However, Justice Scalia’s words do not support Judge\nWiener’s application. In Hartford Fire, Justice Scalia was faced\nwith determining the extraterritorial reach of a statute – a\nconstitutional issue placed by the parties before the Court – and\nto do so he had to consider whether Congress had the power to enact\nthe statute with application outside our borders. This, he termed\n“legislative jurisdiction”. Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 813-14, 113\nS.Ct. at 2918-19. He did not term it “jurisdiction” as a means of\nraising extraterritoriality sua sponte, in an end-run around our\nrequirement that parties argue those issues they wish before us.\n       236\n             Black’s Law Dictionary 612 (1990).\n       237\n             See Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction (1994).\n\n                                        96\n\fcongressional power to create courts.238 Neither of these questions\n\nis before us.\n\n     Moreover, Lipscomb explicitly asked that we find no subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction. “The alleged bribery here had no connection to\n\na federally funded program and, thus, the court below was without\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction to proceed.”239 Even if Judge Wiener’s\n\ncategorization can find support in the law, Lipscomb explicitly\n\nseeks      a    determination        of   adjudicative,   not     legislative\n\njurisdiction.\n\n     Judge Wiener’s categorization fails when extended to its\n\nlogical conclusion, which he affirmatively does in his opinion. He\n\nwrites: “[A] federal forum must lack adjudicative jurisdiction to\n\nhear a case based on a federal statute that Congress lacked the\n\nlegislative jurisdiction (translation: constitutional power or\n\nauthority) to apply to the situation in question.” This implies\n\nthat federal courts must always consider constitutionality, even\n\nraising it sua sponte, when interpreting a statute. This elevates\n\nconstitutionality to a category of claims over which we always have\n\njurisdiction, and this is unsupported by our jurisprudence.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully submit that Judge\n\nWiener’s       is   an   erroneous   analytical   framework,    and   leads   to\n\ninappropriate consideration of the constitutionality of § 666. For\n\n\n     238\n           See id. at 167-246.\n     239\n           See App. Brief at 28.\n\n                                          97\n\fthis reason, I believe it necessary to outline the appropriate\n\nanalytical framework.\n\n     As a threshold matter in all cases, we are faced with the\n\nquestion   whether    we   have   personal   and   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction.240 If we find that we do, we then address whatever\n\nsubstantive issues are before us. This is an abstract description\n\nof our task – what it means here is that we must first determine\n\nwhether Lipscomb’s actions fall within the jurisdiction of § 666,\n\nand if our answer is “yes,” then address the merits of his appeal.\n\nIt is at this second step that, were constitutionality at issue, it\n\nwould arise. Constitutionality is an issue on the merits, not a\n\njurisdictional one.\n\n     Our governing precedent interpreting § 666 does exactly this.\n\nWe have first answered the jurisdictional question, and have not\n\ntaken it upon ourselves to consider the constitutionality of § 666\n\nif it was not appropriately before us on the merits.241\n\n     240\n        See Steel Co. v.

Westmoreland,242      a   county   supervisor\n\nappealed her conviction under § 666 for accepting kickbacks in\n\npurchases of county materials. A panel of this court affirmed her\n\nconviction. Judge King’s carefully crafted opinion first considers\n\nthe jurisdictional scope of § 666. After finding that § 666 did\n\napply       to    Westmoreland’s       conduct,    and   thereby    answering       the\n\njurisdictional question in the affirmative, the opinion addresses\n\nthe substantive issues of the case.\n\n      Nine years later, the Supreme Court decided Salinas v. United\n\nStates,243 an appeal of the conviction of a Texas county sheriff for\n\naccepting bribes in exchange for allowing a federal prisoner housed\n\nin the county jail to receive conjugal visits. There, the Court\n\naffirmed         the   sheriff’s        conviction,      holding     that    federal\n\njurisdiction under § 666 is not limited to cases in which the bribe\n\nhas a demonstrated effect upon federal funds. The Court later\n\nasserted the constitutionality of § 666 as applied to that case.\n\nThe   Salinas       decision    followed     the    two-step     approach    –   first\n\ndetermine        jurisdiction,     and    then    address    whatever     substantive\n\nissues      are    before   the    court.    The    Court    decided      Salinas    on\n\njurisdictional grounds, and then went on to mention that § 666 was\n\nconstitutional as applied.\n\n\n1988) (affirming a conviction                    under   §   666   and    making    no\nconstitutional ruling).\n      242\n            841 F.2d 572 (5th Cir. 1988).\n      243\n            522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed. 2d 352 (1997).\n\n                                            99\n\f     Since Salinas, this circuit has been faced with questions of\n\nthe jurisdictional reach of § 666 twice before the case at bar.\n\nBoth times we followed the “jurisdiction-merits” two-step.\n\n     In United States v. Phillips,244 we reversed the conviction\n\nunder § 666 of a parish tax assessor, holding that he was not an\n\nagent   of   the   parish   for   purposes   of   the   statute.   Thus,   the\n\nstatute’s jurisdiction did not extend to his actions. No discussion\n\nof the merits was required; and the ensuing discussion on potential\n\nconstitutional issues is entirely dicta, because this court was\n\nwithout jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\n     Our most recent holding on the applicability of § 666 was in\n\nUnited States v. Reyes,245 where we affirmed the § 666 conviction of\n\na city councilman for accepting kickbacks on city contracts. We\n\nheld that whatever nexus is statutorily required for jurisdiction\n\nunder § 666, existed in that situation. We then went on to address\n\nthe evidentiary and sentencing issues before us.\n\n     Our analytical approach here should be exactly like that in\n\nthe above-cited line of cases. We must satisfy ourselves of our\n\njurisdiction, and then go on to address whatever issues are before\n\nus on the merits. For the foregoing reasons, the constitutionality\n\nof § 666 is a question on the merits that we will only address if\n\n     244\n           219 F.3d 404 (5th Cir. 2000).\n     245\n        239 F.3d 722 (5th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, Maldonado v.\nUnited States, 533 U.S. 961, 121 S.Ct. 2618, 150 L.Ed. 2d 772\n(2001); and cert. denied, Reyes v.

STEP ONE – JURISDICTION\n\n      Our first step in the analytical two-step is to satisfy\n\nourselves of our jurisdiction over this case. Lipscomb argues that\n\nwe do not have subject matter jurisdiction, because his actions do\n\nnot   fall       within   those    governed     by     §   666.    He   argues   that\n\njurisdiction under § 666 does not extend to cases of local bribery\n\nsuch as his, where the underlying conduct does not directly involve\n\nfederal funds. A detailed review of Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court\n\nprecedent demonstrates that his argument fails as a matter of\n\nstatutory construction.246\n\n(A) Early Fifth Circuit Precedent\n\n      We first interpreted § 666 in United States v. Westmoreland.247\n\nThere, the defendant was a county supervisor convicted of accepting\n\nbribes      in    purchases   of    materials        for   the    county’s   highway\n\nconstruction projects.248 The district court found that the federal\n\nfunds received by the county were not spent by Westmoreland,249 and\n\n\n      246\n         Because Article III of the United States Constitution\nauthorizes federal courts to hear matters arising under all federal\nlaws, and § 666 is a federal law, we may turn directly to whether\nthere is statutory jurisdiction. U.S. CONST., Art. III. The question\nwhether § 666 is a valid exercise of congressional authority is not\nbefore us when we determine our jurisdiction.\n      247\n            841 F.2d 572 (5th Cir. 1988).\n      248\n            See id. at 574-75.\n      249\n            See id.\n\n                                        101\n\fnonetheless convicted her under § 666.\n\n     Westmoreland argued on appeal that her bribery did not fall\n\nunder the jurisdiction of § 666, because it did not concern federal\n\nfunds.250 We rejected this argument, concluding through statutory\n\ninterpretation that federal funds need not be traceable to the\n\n“tainted transactions” in order for those transactions to be\n\npunishable under the statute:\n\n             [W]e find the relevant statutory language plain and\n             unambiguous. By the terms of section 666, when a local\n             government agency receives an annual benefit of more than\n             $10,000 under a federal assistance program, its agents\n             are governed by the statute, and an agent violates\n             subsection (b) when he engages in the prohibited conduct\n             “in any transaction or matter or series of transactions\n             or matters involving $5,000 or more concerning the\n             affairs of” the local government agency. 18 U.S.C. §\n             666(b) (Supp. 1984) [emphasis added]. Subsection (b)\n             contains nothing to indicate that “any transaction\n             involving $5,000\" means “any federally funded transaction\n             involving $5,000\" or “any transaction involving $5,000 of\n             federal funds,” and other subsections of the statute\n             contain no inconsistent provisions that might suggest\n             such a qualification.251\n\n     We next reviewed the jurisdictional reach of § 666 in United\n\nStates v. Moeller.252 There, the government appealed the dismissal\n\nof § 666 claims against employees of the Texas Federal Inspection\n\nService, state workers empowered to conduct federal inspections.253\n\nWe held that jurisdiction under § 666 extended to the employees’\n\n\n     250\n           See Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 575.\n     251\n           Id. at 576.\n     252\n           987 F.2d 1134 (5th Cir. 1993).\n     253\n           See id.\n\n                                  102\n\factions, because the Texas Department of Agriculture, a “government\n\nagency” within § 666, received more than $10,000 a year in federal\n\nfunds; and the defendants were “agents” of that federally-funded\n\nagency for purposes of § 666.254\n\n     In United States v. Marmolejo,255 we upheld the conviction of\n\na sheriff who accepted bribes in return for permitting conjugal\n\nvisits to a federal prisoner whom Texas, in return for a fee from\n\nthe federal government, housed in a facility constructed with\n\nfederal funds.256 In holding that these actions came under the\n\njurisdiction     of   §   666,   we   referenced   our   earlier   statutory\n\ndecisions: “[w]e have previously held that § 666(a)(1)(B) does not\n\nrequire the government to prove that federal funds were directly\n\ninvolved in a bribery transaction, or that the federal monies\n\nfunded the corrupt transaction.”257 We went on to conclude that\n\nconjugal visits are “anything of value” under the statute.\n\n     The dissent in Marmolejo argued that Westmoreland interpreted\n\n§ 666 to reach “only those acts of bribery that could somehow be\n\ntraced, directly or indirectly, to the integrity of federal program\n\n\n\n\n     254\n           See id. at 1137-38.\n     255\n        89 F.3d 1185 (5th Cir. 1996), aff’d sub nom.

United\n\nStates, the Court stated that “[t]he statute’s plain language fails\n\nto   provide    any   basis   for   limiting     §    666(a)(1)(B)   to   bribes\n\naffecting      federal   funds”     and   that       the   legislative    history\n\n“forecloses this type of limitation.”260 The Court therefore decided\n\nthat as a statutory matter, federal funds need not be directly\n\ninvolved in a violation of § 666.261 The Court then in passing\n\nasserted the constitutionality of § 666 as applied to the case at\n\nbar.262\n\n\n      258\n        Id. at 1203. “Turning to the precise legislative history,\nI find that it clearly reveals that Congress did not intend for §\n666(a)(1)(B) to be applied to conduct such as the acceptance of\nbribes to allow conjugal visits. Instead, Congress was only\nconcerned with protecting the federal monies disbursed to non-\nfederal entities.” Id.\n      259\n        Salinas v.

Judge Wiener cites this as\nevidence that we too should consider the constitutionality of § 666\nhere. However, the Supreme Court’s assertion in passing that § 666\nwas constitutional as applied does not bind us to rule on the\nconstitutionality of § 666 as applied to Lipscomb here. First, we\nare not the Supreme Court and have different limitations on our\njurisdiction. The Supreme Court, unlike us, is the definitive voice\nin interpreting federal statutes. See Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal\n\n                                      104\n\f     Since Salinas, the Supreme Court has decided only one other\n\ncase involving § 666 – United States v. Fischer.263 There the Court\n\naffirmed the      conviction   of    a    defendant     who   defrauded    a   city\n\nhospital    authority   that   participated        in   the   federal     Medicare\n\nprogram.264 The Fischer analysis, however, is not relevant to this\n\ncase.\n\n(C) Recent Fifth Circuit Cases\n\n     The first Fifth Circuit panel to interpret § 666 post-Salinas\n\ndecided    United   States   v.     Phillips.265   There,     we   reversed    the\n\nconviction of a parish tax assessor, holding that he was not an\n\n“agent” of St. Helena Parish for purposes of the statute. Thus, the\n\nstatute’s jurisdiction did not reach his activity. This has little\n\nbearing on our case, as city councilmen are clearly “agents” under\n\nthe statute.266\n\n\nJurisdiction 571 (1994). Second, the Supreme Court in Salinas\ndeclined to avoid the constitutional question because it considered\nit a greater disservice to “rewrite language enacted by the\nlegislature” than to fail to avoid the issue. Salinas, 522 U.S. at\n59.   This   reasoning   does   not   compel  us    to  reach   the\nconstitutionality of § 666 here; if anything, it counsels against\nthat. We are not rewriting § 666 – we are faithfully reading the\nlanguage of the statute, and recognizing that in order to question\nthe    congressionally-enacted      language,    the    issue    of\nconstitutionality must be explicitly before us.\n     263\n           529 U.S. 667, 120 S.Ct. 1780, 146 L.Ed. 2d 707 (2000).\n     264\n        See id., 529 U.S. at 669-70, 681, 120 S.Ct. at 1782-83,\n1788-89.\n     265\n           219 F.3d 404 (5th Cir. 2000).\n     266\n        See United States v. Reyes, 239 F.3d 722 (5th Cir. 2001),\ncert. denied, Maldonado v. United States, 533 U.S. 961, 121 S.Ct.\n\n                                         105\n\f     The two most recent Fifth Circuit § 666 cases demonstrate our\n\ncontinued commitment to applying § 666 to members of city councils,\n\nlike Lipscomb, and support our finding of jurisdiction here.\n\n     In United States v. Reyes267 we affirmed the § 666 conviction\n\nof a city councilman for accepting kickbacks on city contracts. We\n\nheld that whatever nexus is statutorily required for jurisdiction\n\nunder § 666, existed in that case.268\n\n     More recently, we decided United States v. Williams269 without\n\ndiscussing jurisdiction at all. Williams, a former city councilman,\n\nwas convicted under § 666 of “aiding and abetting others in the\n\ncorrupt solicitation and acceptance of bribery payments”.270 We\n\naffirmed his conviction.\n\n(D) The Bottom Line\n\n     Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent alike construe the\n\njurisdictional reach of § 666 broadly. Federal funds need not be\n\ndirectly involved in a violation of § 666. The Phillips panel\n\nconstrued the term “agent” narrowly, and reversed the conviction,\n\n\n2618, 150 L.Ed. 2d 772 (2001); and cert. denied, Reyes v. United\nStates, 122 S.Ct. 156, 151 L.Ed. 2d 106 (2001); United States v.\nWilliams, 264 F.3d 561 (5th Cir. 2001).\n     267\n        239 F.3d 722 (5th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, Maldonado v.\nUnited States, 533 U.S. 961, 121 S.Ct. 2618, 150 L.Ed. 2d 772\n(2001); and cert. denied, Reyes v.

The Westmoreland view of §\n\n666   therefore   continues   to   be   the   law   in   this   circuit,   and\n\nprecludes us from more narrowly construing the statute here.\n\nBecause Lipscomb’s actions satisfy the jurisdictional requirements\n\nfound in the language of § 666, we conclude that the district court\n\nhad jurisdiction to try Lipscomb under § 666, and turn to the\n\nissues which the parties put before us on the merits.\n\n                        III. STEP TWO – MERITS\n\n      Before reaching the issues raised by Lipscomb, I must address\n\nthe issue of the constitutionality of § 666 – an issue raised not\n\nby the Appellant, but by the opinions of my colleagues on this\n\npanel.    This issue is not properly before us, but because my\n\ncolleagues have raised it, I respond.\n\n(A) Constitutionality of § 666\n\n      There do exist troubling constitutional issues under the\n\nsurface of this case. Whether Congress had the authority it claimed\n\nto enact § 666 under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, U.S.\n\nCONST., art. I, § 8, is a close question.            However, although my\n\ncolleagues hold otherwise, it is not our question today. We may\n\nonly decide those issues properly before us, and the constitutional\n\nquestion is not such an issue. It was argued neither at trial nor\n\non appeal, and there is no legal justification for us to raise it\n\nsua sponte.\n\n      (1) Not Argued at Trial\n\n                                    107\n\f     The     record    shows   that    despite   mention   of   potential\n\nconstitutional issues, Lipscomb never argued at trial that § 666\n\nwas unconstitutional as applied to him. Following is discussion of\n\nthe four motions by which he made the jurisdictional argument, and\n\nwhere any constitutional discussion at all (not sufficient to raise\n\nthe issue of constitutionality) exists.\n\n             (a) Motion to Dismiss the Indictment or, Alternatively,\n             for an Evidentiary Hearing Requiring the Government to\n             Establish Federal Jurisdiction\n\n     On September 3, 1999, Lipscomb filed a Motion to Dismiss the\n\nIndictment or, Alternatively, for an Evidentiary Hearing Requiring\n\nthe Government to Establish Federal Jurisdiction.271 It is worth\n\nnoting that the title of the Motion shows that it seeks proof of\n\nfederal jurisdiction, and does not challenge the constitutionality\n\nof § 666. Moreover, Lipscomb crafts his arguments in support of the\n\nMotion in terms of challenging federal jurisdiction. “In this\n\ncase... no sufficient jurisdictional basis is evident.”272 “On its\n\nface, this indictment fails even to allege an appropriate basis for\n\nthe exercise of federal jurisdiction....”273\n\n     Lipscomb does mention the potential constitutional problems\n\nthat could arise if § 666 is applied to his conduct. He goes so far\n\nas to say “[s]ection 666 is being unconstitutionally applied in\n\n\n\n     271\n           See R. at 60.\n     272\n           R. at 62.\n     273\n           R. at 63.\n\n                                      108\n\fthis case,” and mentions possible Tenth Amendment consequences of\n\napplying § 666 to Lipscomb’s conduct.274 Moreover, one of Lipscomb’s\n\nattorneys signed the Motion as “Special Counsel for Tenth Amendment\n\npurposes only”.275 However, this discussion arises in the context of\n\na   challenge    to    jurisdiction,   not   as   a   challenge   to   the\n\nconstitutionality of the statute as applied (which would arise\n\nunder the Spending Clause, not the Tenth Amendment). Even the\n\nstatement “[s]ection 666 is being unconstitutionally applied in\n\nthis case”276 stands alone, and is not supported by any argument.\n\n     The District Court denied Lipscomb’s motion:\n\n             Came to be considered the motion of the defendants to\n             dismiss the indictment for lack of federal jurisdiction,\n             and after due consideration thereof, as well as a plain\n             reading of the statute, and the briefs and arguments of\n             counsel, this court is of the opinion that the motion\n             should be DENIED.277\n\nJudge Kendall declined to dismiss the indictment because he found\n\nthat federal jurisdiction did exist. He neither mentioned nor\n\nconsidered the constitutionality of § 666. His Order includes the\n\nhand-written addition of the phrase “as well as a plain reading of\n\nthe statute,” further supporting the conclusion that his analysis\n\nwas a statutory and not a constitutional one.\n\n             (b) Motion for Judgment of Acquittal Pursuant to Rule\n\n     274\n           Id.\n     275\n           R. at 66.\n     276\n           R. at 63.\n     277\n           Id.\n\n                                   109\n\f               29(A), Following the Government’s Case in Chief\n\n       Following the government’s case, Lipscomb moved the District\n\nCourt for Judgment of Acquittal.278 Lipscomb argued that some nexus\n\nbetween the bribe and the federally-funded program must exist in\n\norder    for    there     to    be    jurisdiction,      and    that    here,    no   such\n\nconnection exists.279 He couched his argument in terms of “get[ting]\n\nthis    case     in   federal        court    properly,”       which     is   clearly   a\n\njurisdictional concern.280 Later in the colloquy Lipscomb’s attorney\n\ntold    Judge    Kendall       that    “666    doesn’t    cover      this”,281   another\n\nargument about the scope of jurisdiction under § 666.\n\n       The Government’s response follows the same approach, citing\n\ncases that analyze the jurisdictional reach of § 666, not its\n\nconstitutionality.282 The District Court denied the Motion.\n\n               (c) Motion for Judgment of Acquittal Pursuant to Rule\n               29(A), Following the Jury Verdict\n\n       On February 8, 2000, following the jury verdict, Lipscomb\n\nagain moved the District Court for Judgment of Acquittal.283\n\nHe argued that the Government failed to present evidence of a\n\nconnection      between        the   alleged   bribes     and    a     federally-funded\n\n\n       278\n             See R. Vol. 13 at 32.\n       279\n             See id. at 36-9.\n       280\n             Id. at 37.\n       281\n             Id. at 40.\n       282\n             See id. at 41-2.\n       283\n             See R. at 556.\n\n                                             110\n\fprogram.284 Lipscomb asks the court again to find a failure of\n\njurisdiction due to the lack of nexus.\n\n     The     Government’s    response    cites   case    law   analyzing   the\n\njurisdictional reach of § 666.285 The Government makes no argument\n\nthat § 666 is constitutional as applied, suggesting that it did not\n\nconsider a constitutional argument raised. Further, the District\n\nCourt’s     denial   of   Lipscomb’s    Motion   makes    no   mention   of   a\n\nconstitutional issue.286\n\n             (d) Conditional Motion for Voluntary Surrender Date and\n             Bond Pending Appeal\n\n     Lipscomb filed a Conditional Motion for Voluntary Surrender\n\nDate and Bond Pending Appeal on April 26, 2000.287 He sought bond\n\npending appeal because:\n\n             it is legitimately predictable that the Fifth Circuit in\n             light of the Salinas [sic] opinion and its subsequent\n             interpretation by the other federal circuits will revisit\n             its past positions regarding the necessary connection\n             between the federal funds and the alleged bribes.288\n\nLipscomb seeks bond because he thinks the Fifth Circuit on appeal\n\nwill find a nexus requirement for jurisdiction under § 666. This is\n\na pure question of statutory interpretation. Nowhere does Lipscomb\n\nseek bond pending appeal because he thinks the Fifth Circuit might\n\n\n     284\n           See R. at 560.\n     285\n           See R. at 600, 617-19.\n     286\n           See R. at 644.\n     287\n           See R. at 898.\n     288\n           R. at 901.\n\n                                       111\n\ffind § 666 as applied to his conduct unconstitutional. That is\n\nbecause he never made such an argument.\n\n     (2) Not Argued on Appeal\n\n     Even assuming arguendo that constitutionality was argued at\n\ntrial, it was certainly not preserved on appeal, which is required\n\nif we are to consider it. The record shows that despite mention of\n\npotential constitutional issues, Lipscomb did not argue on appeal\n\nthat § 666 was unconstitutional as applied to him.\n\n     Lipscomb’s Appellate Brief repeatedly uses the vocabulary of\n\njurisdiction, not constitutionality, to define his claim. In his\n\nrequest for oral argument, Lipscomb writes that “[t]his appeal\n\ninvolves a substantial jurisdictional question,” and never mentions\n\na constitutional question.289 Moreover, Lipscomb defined the issue\n\nas follows:\n\n                 The fact that the City of Dallas received federal funds\n                 in excess of $10,000 in a given year does not, without\n                 more, establish federal jurisdiction to prosecute a City\n                 Councilman for bribery under 18 U.S.C. 666 [sic].290\n\nConstitutionality is not mentioned.\n\n     Lipscomb writes that “it is incumbent upon federal courts –\n\ntrial      and    appellate   –   to   constantly   examine   the   basis   for\n\njurisdiction....”291 “A nexus between the expenditure of federal\n\n\n     289\n           App. Brief at ii.\n     290\n           Id. at iii, 2, 19 (emphasis added).\n     291\n        Id. at 19, qtg. Save the Bay, Inc. v. United States Army,\n639 F.2d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir. 1981).\n\n                                        112\n\ffunds   and       the   illicit   conduct,      bribery,   is   inherent   in   the\n\nstatutory scheme and consistent with the legislative history.”292 He\n\ngoes on to say:\n\n              Federal     jurisdiction was entirely contrived here. The\n              alleged      bribery was unrelated to any expenditure of\n              federal     monies. Accordingly, Federal [sic] jurisdiction\n              did not     and does not exist.293\n\nLipscomb’s argument is it is a jurisdictional requirement of § 666\n\nthat there be some connection between the bribe and the federal\n\nfunds.294\n\n      Lipscomb concludes his argument on this issue with the words\n\n“[t]he alleged bribery here had no connection to a federally funded\n\nprogram and, thus, the court below was without subject matter\n\njurisdiction to proceed.”295 I can imagine no clearer statement that\n\nhis   claim       is    jurisdictional,    unless    you   consider   Lipscomb’s\n\nconclusion and plea for relief:\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, the defendant-appellant,\n              ALBERT LOUIS LIPSCOMB, respectfully requests that this\n              Court reverse these convictions and remand the case to\n              the district court with instructions to dismiss the\n              indictment for lack of federal jurisdiction.296\n\n      Lipscomb’s Appellate Brief also sheds light on his District\n\nCourt arguments, and exposes them as purely jurisdictional, not\n\n      292\n            App. Brief at 14.\n      293\n            Id.\n      294\n            See id. at 20.\n      295\n            App. Brief at 28.\n      296\n            Id. at 59 (emphasis added).\n\n                                          113\n\fconstitutional. He writes that he “objected to the absence of\n\nfederal jurisdiction before, during and after trial.”297 Not once\n\ndoes he claim to have objected at trial on the basis that the\n\nstatute was unconstitutional. Moreover, had he thought that he had\n\nargued constitutionality at trial, we would expect him on appeal to\n\nchallenge the District Court’s failure to decide that issue.\n\nLipscomb makes no such challenge, further showing that he never\n\nmade an argument regarding the constitutionality of § 666.\n\n     Lipscomb does mention that contrary statutory interpretation\n\ncould raise constitutional concerns.298 However, as before the\n\nDistrict Court, this is mere mention of potential constitutional\n\nconcerns in the context of a jurisdictional challenge; it is not a\n\nchallenge to the constitutionality of § 666. Moreover, Lipscomb\n\nmentions the potential constitutional issue in order to exhort us\n\nto avoid it.299\n\n     The      Government’s    Brief         continues   the   dialogue   in\n\njurisdictional terms.300 It does not defend the constitutionality of\n\n§ 666, strongly suggesting the Government did not consider that\n\nissue raised. Appellant’s Reply Brief follows suit.301\n\n\n\n     297\n           Id.; see also id. at 19.\n     298\n           See App. Brief at 14, 20, 22-5, 27.\n     299\n           See id. at 27-8.\n     300\n           See U.S. Brief at ii, 2, 31, 33-40.\n     301\n           See App. Reply Brief at i, 1-5, 16-21.\n\n                                      114\n\f     (3) No Legal Basis to Reach Constitutional Issue\n\n     Despite the urgings of my colleagues to the contrary, no facts\n\nexist to support the contention that Lipscomb ever argued the\n\nconstitutionality of § 666, or preserved that issue on appeal.\n\nHowever, assuming for sake of argument only the allusions to a\n\npotential constitutional issue found in the record are sufficient\n\nto raise the issue and preserve it for appeal, we still may not\n\ndecide     the   issue.   There    exists   no    legal   support      for   the\n\nconstitutional determinations made by my colleagues today.\n\n             (a) Court of Error\n\n     Our jurisdiction is exclusively appellate,302 and we are not\n\nendowed with      any   original   jurisdiction    except   in   aid    of   our\n\nappellate jurisdiction.303 These rules embody the policy that legal\n\nissues should be developed initially before the district courts. As\n\na panel of this circuit put it, “[g]enerally speaking, we are a\n\ncourt of errors and appeals.”304 The trial court cannot have erred\n\nas to matters which were not presented to it, nor decided by it.305\n\nThis is black letter law.\n\n     302\n        See Roche v. Evaporated Milk Assn., 319 U.S. 21, 63 S.Ct.\n938, 87 L.Ed. 1185 (1943); United States v. Mayer, 235 U.S. 55, 35\nS.Ct. 16, 59 L.Ed. 129 (1914).

Thus,   we    have   no   decision    on\n\nconstitutionality to review.306 Moreover, it was not error for the\n\ndistrict court not to consider the constitutional issue, because\n\nthat issue was never presented to it.\n\n     Of course, there are some situations in which appellate courts\n\nhave jurisdiction to raise issues on their own.307 For example, if\n\nparties do not raise the issue of jurisdiction, or even if they\n\ncontend that the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction, we still must\n\ndetermine, sua sponte, whether we have jurisdiction in a particular\n\ncase.308 However, constitutional questions are not among those which\n\nwe can raise sua sponte.\n\n             (b) Issue Not Briefed\n\n     Appellant’s brief must contain the “appellant’s contentions\n\nand the reasons for them”.309 Issues that are not clearly designated\n\nin the appellant’s brief are normally deemed abandoned.310 This is\n\n     306\n         Therefore, even assuming, arguendo, that the parties\nadequately raised the issue of the constitutionality of § 666\nbefore us on appeal, we are without authority to decide that\nquestion. Were this question appropriately before us, we would not\nhave the power to rule on constitutionality, as both Judge Wiener\nand Judge Smith are so eager to do; we would rather be bound to\nremand the issue to the district court for determination.\n     307\n           See Charles Alan Wright, Law of Federal Courts 10 (1983).\n     308\n           See United States v.

We\n\ngenerally do not anticipate constitutional questions, but wait\n\nuntil      a   case    is    presented   that       requires   a   decision   of    a\n\nconstitutional issue.311 There is also established Supreme Court\n\nprecedent declining to address constitutional questions not put in\n\nissue by the parties.312\n\n     This Circuit held last year that “[c]iting cases that may\n\ncontain a useful argument is simply inadequate to preserve that\n\nargument for appeal,”313 in Clyde Bergemann, Inc. v. The Babcock &\n\nWilcox Co., 250 F.3d 955 (5th Cir. 2001). Bergemann was a creditor\n\nwho objected to a financing arrangement between the debtors and a\n\nbank which would let the debtors continue operating. On appeal he\n\nargued, inter alia, that the financing arrangement was a fraudulent\n\nconveyance of assets. However, his brief to the bankruptcy court\n\nreferred to that issue only in passing.

We\n\nheld the issue waived.\n\n     Here neither party raised the constitutionality of § 666 in\n\nits briefs or arguments before us. Thus, it is beyond the scope of\n\nour review.\n\n            (c) Avoidance of Constitutional Questions\n\n     Even   assuming     everything     else   away,    and   considering      the\n\nconstitutional issue adequately raised, we still have the duty to\n\ndecline    to   decide   that   issue    unnecessarily.       It    is   a   well-\n\nestablished     canon    of   construction     that    federal     courts    avoid\n\naddressing constitutional questions when possible, even those that\n\nare raised by the parties.314 As stated by Justice Brandeis in his\n\nwell-known and oft-cited concurring opinion (dissenting in part) in\n\nAshwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 346-47, 56 S. Ct. 466, 483, 80 L.\n\nEd. 688 (1936):\n\n            The   Court   will   not   anticipate   a   question   of\n            constitutional law in advance of the necessity of\n            deciding it. It is not the habit of the court to decide\n            questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely\n            necessary to a decision of the case. ... The Court will\n            not pass upon a constitutional question although properly\n            presented by the record, if there is also present some\n            other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. ...\n            Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds,\n            one involving a constitutional question, the other a\n            question of statutory construction or general law, the\n\n     314\n        See Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288,\n56 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).\n\n                                      118\n\f             Court will decide only the latter.315\n\nThe Fifth Circuit has agreed that we will not take a constitutional\n\nquestion for decision if there is some other legitimate ground on\n\nwhich the case can be decided.316\n\n     Because      this   case   can   legitimately   be   decided   on\n\njurisdictional grounds (in fact, that is the issue briefed and\n\nargued), we must avoid any constitutional decision.\n\n     (4) Conclusion\n\n     It is quite likely that a case will someday arise that\n\nsquarely challenges the constitutionality of § 666, but this is not\n\nthat case. Until that day, we must answer only those questions\n\nbefore us. Because the constitutionality of § 666 was not argued at\n\ntrial or on appeal, and there is no legal justification for our\n\nreaching it, I must respectfully dissent from the entire discussion\n\nof constitutionality found in the opinions of both Judge Wiener and\n\nJudge Smith.317\n\n     315\n           Id. (internal citations omitted, emphasis added).\n     316\n           See Grundstrom, 404 F.2d at 648.\n     317\n         Judge Smith challenges my analysis of whether the\nconstitutional issue was raised as “hyper-technical,” and\n“elevat[ing] semantics over substance. While I appreciate the value\nhe places on avoiding hyper-technicality, I cannot agree with\nelevating that goal over our requirement that parties raise the\nissues they wish us to decide. I seek no magic words; I wish only\nthat the parties would clearly raise those issues they wish us and\nthe district court to decide (as our precedent requires). The\nparties here did not meet even this most-light burden on the issue\nof the constitutionality of § 666.\n\n     In the same vein, Judge Smith accuses me of invoking the\n\n                                  119\n\f(B) Transfer\n\n     I concur in Judge Wiener’s discussion and conclusions on the\n\ntransfer issue.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, I concur in part and dissent in\n\npart, but share Judge Wiener’s conclusion that we must reverse\n\nLipscomb’s conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for a new\n\ntrial.\n\n\n\n\n“rigid form pleading” that was eliminated by the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. This misunderstands my analysis. To the contrary,\nI am not concerned with what the parties raise in the complaints\nand answers that set out in broad brushstrokes the case they intend\nto bring. However, we must (and our precedent shows we do) require\nparties to specifically argue before us and the district court, at\nsome point during the adjudication of their dispute, what issues\nthey wish decided. The courts are not required to divine what\nissues are before them, nor do they have the power to choose what\nissues they would like to be before them – that is the\nresponsibility of the parties.\n\n     The conclusions of Judge Wiener and Judge Smith place a burden\non the trial court to read between the lines of the parties’\narguments and ascertain what the parties “should have” or “could\nhave” argued. That is just not the way our judicial system works.\nThe burden lies with the parties to place a case or controversy\nbefore the court. On the issue of constitutionality, that burden\nwas not met here. Requiring judges to act as mindreaders, as Judge\nWiener and Judge Smith do here, cannot be an acceptable part of our\njudicial system.\n\n                               120\n\fJERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n\n\n       I would reverse the conviction and render a judgment of dis-\n\nmissal with prejudice, thereby precluding a retrial of defendant\n\nAlbert Lipscomb. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the con-\n\ntrary result reached by Judge Wiener’s opinion and Judge Duhé’s\n\npartial concurrence, which is to subject this seventy-seven-year-\n\nold defendantSSwho has already served more than half of his ap-\n\nproximately three and one-half-year sentence of incarceration wait-\n\ning for his appeal to be decidedSSto a new trial under a statute\n\nthat has no application to him.\n\n       Two of the three judges on this panel are of the view that\n\nLipscomb properly raised the issue of whether 18 U.S.C. § 666 is\n\nunconstitutional as applied to him. Nonetheless, we fail to decide\n\nthat issue because one of the judges declines to address it, leav-\n\ning the other two judges evenly split on the question.    If we were\n\nto address it, we should easily conclude that Congress has no au-\n\nthority to criminalize Lipscomb’s conduct, and the government had\n\nno authority to subject him to a first trial, let alone a second\n\none.\n\n\n\n                                  I.\n\n       Judge Duhé is correct that “[c]onstitutionality is an issue on\n\nthe merits, not a jurisdictional one.”     He also accurately states\n\nthat a criminal defendant may waive constitutional challenges to a\n\fstatute by failing to argue them.     Although Judge Duhé follows the\n\nproper methodology by looking to Lipscomb’s four trial motions and\n\nhis appellate brief for the answer, Judge Duhé errs in applying a\n\nhyper-technical test in reviewing Lipscomb’s arguments, a test\n\nthat elevates semantics over substance.\n\n     Our inquiry is a relatively easy one:       Has Lipscomb argued\n\nthat Congress cannot reach his conduct under the United States\n\nConstitution?   When we focus on the text of Lipscomb’s motions and\n\nbriefs, we can have no doubt that the answer is yes.\n\n\n\n                                A.\n\n     Judge Duhé argues that Lipscomb’s September 3, 1999, “Motion\n\nTo Dismiss the Indictment or, Alternatively, for an Evidentiary\n\nHearing Requiring the Government To Establish Federal Jurisdiction”\n\nis a motion that “seeks proof of federal jurisdiction, and does not\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of § 666.” But the full text shows\n\nthat Lipscomb is making a constitutional argument; he just uses the\n\nwords “jurisdiction” and “power” interchangeably:\n\n          However, in Salinas, the Court squarely left open\n     the question whether Section 666 “requires some other\n     kind of connection between a bribe and the expenditure of\n     federal funds” lest it be applied in some manner which\n     would alter or fail to “give proper respect to the\n     federal-state balance” of powers [quoting Salinas]. The\n     Court found “no serious doubt about the constitutionality\n     of Section 666(a)(1)(B) as applied to the facts of this\n     case” [quoting Salinas].\n\n          In this case, however, no sufficient jurisdictional\n     basis is evident . . . .       Any exercise of federal\n\n                                122\n\fjurisdiction must demonstrate a proper respect for con-\ncepts of dual sovereignty and federalism. On its face,\nthis indictment fails even to allege an appropriate basis\nfor the exercise of federal jurisdiction and accordingly\nSection 666 is being unconstitutionally applied in this\ncase . . . .\n\n     The Tenth Amendment . . . provides: [quoting] . . .\n[T]he 'double security' embodied in the concept of fed-\neralism requires 'a proper balance between the States and\nthe Federal Government” [citing Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501\nU.S. 452, 459 (1991)]. The States' constitutional pre-\nrogatives plainly include their “constitutional re-\nsponsibility for the establishment and operation of its\nown government . . . .” Under our federal system, states\npossess the primary authority to define and enforce crim-\nminal law [citing United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549,\n561 n.3 (1995)].\n\n     Thus, the application of Section 666 in circumstanc-\nes with no evident assertion of a federal interest of-\nfends two state prerogatives: (1) the States' constitu-\ntional responsibility for regulation of electoral govern-\nment and for the establishment and operation of its own\ngovernment and the qualifications of its officials; and\n(2) the definition and enforcement of criminal law. As\na constitutional principle, it simply cannot be that\n$10,000.00 in federal funds provided to a major city\ntrumps the Tenth Amendment and the prerogatives and re-\nsponsibilities reserved to the States therein. The Tenth\nAmendment, after all, 'was enacted to allay lingering\nconcerns about the extent of national power” [citing\nAlden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 713-14 (1999)]. “When the\nFederal Government asserts authority over a States' [sic]\nmost fundamental political processes, its [sic] strikes\nat the heart of the political accountability so essential\nto our liberty and republican form of government” [citing\nAlden; Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997); New\nYork v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992)].\n\n     The proper state-federal balance is disturbed when\nthere is an intrusion upon State prerogatives in\nimportant areas reserved to the States. This indictment\nfails to identify the federal interest served by this\nexercise   of   federal   jurisdiction   and   therefore\nconstitutes an unconstitutional application of Section\n666 . . . . [F]ederal jurisdiction is being exercised in\n\n                           123\n\f       a manner that plainly intrudes upon the prerogative of\n       the States to define, apply and enforce criminal law, and\n       to monitor and oversee the operation of its government.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       If Lipscomb were merely arguing jurisdiction, why would he\n\nfive    times      cite       SalinasSSwhich          does     not      even      mention\n\njurisdictionSSfor         the     proposition          that     §     666      has   been\n\nunconstitutionally applied to him?               Why would he employ a “Special\n\nCounsel for Tenth Amendment purposes only,” and have that counsel\n\nsign the motion?        Why would he twice invoke the Tenth Amendment and\n\ncite the Tenth Amendment cases of Gregory, Printz, and New York v.\n\nUnited States, as well as Alden’s Tenth Amendment discussion?                         Why\n\nwould   he   six   times        argue    that    §    666     abridges      the   states’\n\nconstitutional responsibilities and prerogatives?                        Why would he\n\nthree times argue that § 666 upsets the constitution’s federal-\n\nstate balance of powers?          Why would he three times state that § 666\n\nis being unconstitutionally applied to him?\n\n       Judge Duhé sidesteps all of this and, instead, notes that the\n\nmotion’s        title         mentions       federal           jurisdiction,         not\n\nconstitutionality,        and     Lipscomb      uses    the    word     “jurisdiction”\n\nthroughout his argument.            Since when do we accord one word such\n\ntalismanic power that its mere presence or absence in a motion or\n\nbrief can negate all remaining arguments?                    Since when do we forbid\n\na defendant from raising two pointsSSboth constitutionality and\n\njurisdictionSSin        one   motion?      The       Federal    Rules    of    Procedure\n\n\n                                          124\n\feliminated just the type of rigid form pleading that Judge Duhé\n\ninvokes today.\n\n     Lipscomb’s motion is less than polished, and his interchange\n\nof “jurisdiction” and “power” is clumsy. As Judge Wiener explains,\n\nsometimes Lipscomb uses “jurisdiction” to refer to a federal\n\ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction, and sometimes he uses “juris-\n\ndiction” to refer to the persons and acts over which Congress may\n\nlegislate.   But any confusion is easily eliminated:    Substitute\n\n“federal power” or “congressional power” every time Lipscomb says\n\n“jurisdiction” in his motion, and the motion’s meaning remains the\n\nsame.   But substitute “subject matter jurisdiction” or “federal\n\ncourt jurisdiction,” and parts of the motion become nonsensical.\n\n     For example, the final paragraph makes no sense when “federal\n\ncourt jurisdiction” is used:\n\n          The proper state-federal balance is disturbed when\n     there is an intrusion upon State prerogatives in\n     important areas reserved to the States. This indictment\n     fails to identify the federal interest served by this\n     exercise of [federal court jurisdiction] and therefore\n     constitutes an unconstitutional application of Section\n     666 . . . . [Federal court jurisdiction] is being\n     exercised in a manner that plainly intrudes upon the\n     prerogative of the States to define, apply and enforce\n     criminal law, and to monitor and oversee the operation of\n     its government.\n\nBut this paragraph reads perfectly well when “congressional power”\n\nis filled in.\n\n     Lipscomb’s lack of artfulness should not doom his appeal, es-\n\npecially given that the Supreme Court and our circuit often have\n\n\n\n                                125\n\fbeen guilty of the same offense of conflating “jurisdiction” and\n\n“power.”   In United States v. Cotton, 122 S. Ct. 1781 (2002), the\n\nCourt acknowledged that it has sometimes employed a “somewhat ex-\n\npansive    notion    of   jurisdiction”        that   covered    both     general\n\nconstitutional      questions    and     the   concept    of    subject    matter\n\njurisdiction.       Id.   at   1784-85    (internal      quotations     omitted).\n\nRecently, the en banc court of this circuit reheard United States\n\nv. Longoria, 259 F.3d 363 (5th Cir.), vacated for rehearing en\n\nbanc, 262 F.3d 455 (5th Cir. 2001), to undo the confusion generated\n\nby our loose use of the term “jurisdiction.”              Lipscomb should not\n\nbe held to a higher standard of legal diction than are the judges\n\nand Justices of this court and the Supreme Court.\n\n     Judge Duhé and I also read Lipscomb’s February 8, 2000, motion\n\nfor judgment of acquittal quite differently.              Lipscomb made, inter\n\nalia, the following arguments:\n\n          As applied to Lipscomb, 18 U.S.C. § 666 is\n     unconstitutional. No evidence was introduced that any of\n     the funds given to Lipscomb can be connected to “a threat\n     to the integrity and proper function of a federal pro-\n     gram.” None of the federal funds was shown to relate to\n     the taxicab industry. At no time did any of the votes\n     alleged in the indictment impinge upon the use, distribu-\n     tion, diversion or application of any federal funds.\n     Congress intended to protect federal and the integrity of\n     those funds.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n     Lipscomb flatly states that § 666 is unconstitutional as ap-\n\nplied to him, and he follows with a constitutional argument from\n\nSalinas.   The Salinas Court explained that because the crime “was\n\n                                       126\n\fa threat to the integrity and proper operation of the federal\n\nprogram[,    w]hatever   might   be     said    about   §   666(a)(1)(B)’s\n\napplication in other cases, the application of § 666(a)(1)(B) to\n\nSalinas did not extend federal power beyond its proper bounds.”\n\nSalinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 61 (1997).           Lipscomb argues\n\nthe inverseSSbecause his crime did not threaten the integrity and\n\nproper operation of a federal program, the application of § 666 to\n\nhim is not constitutional.\n\n     Judge Duhé recharacterizes this argument as a challenge to the\n\njurisdictional reach of § 666; Lipscomb, he concludes, actually is\n\nasserting that § 666 requires a nexus between federal funds and the\n\nbribery.    Judge Duhé does not explain why, if this is so, Lipscomb\n\nfailed to place this argument under heading B of his motionSS“The\n\nGovernment has failed to establish the jurisdictional prerequisite\n\nfor each substantive count.”\n\n     Nor does Judge Duhé explain why Lipscomb would support this\n\nargument by quoting from the same passage in Salinas that held,\n\n“The text of § 666(a)(1)(B) is unambiguous . . . [and] does not\n\nrequire the Government to prove federal funds were involved in the\n\nbribery transaction.”     Salinas, 522 U.S. at 60.          Instead, Judge\n\nDuhé notes that neither the government nor the district court\n\nmentioned the constitutional issue.            Just because the district\n\ncourt and the government may have misunderstood Lipscomb’s claim,\n\nhowever, does not mean he failed to present it.\n\n\n                                  127\n\f                                    B.\n\n      Lipscomb devotes ten pages of his appellate brief to the\n\nconstitutional issue.    Even though Lipscomb admits that “[i]t is\n\nnot a jurisdictional requirement of [§] 666 that the alleged bribe\n\nactually affect federal funds,” Judge Duhé insists that Lipscomb is\n\nmaking only a jurisdictional argument. More incredibly, Judge Duhé\n\nclaims Lipscomb “never mentions a constitutional question,” even\n\nthough Lipscomb states, “there must be some connection between the\n\nbribe and the expenditure of federal funds.      Otherwise, the reach\n\nof § 666 intrudes well beyond the scope of federal authority into\n\nareas of state responsibility, and serious constitutional questions\n\nare presented.”   (Emphasis added.)\n\n      Lipscomb further notes that the Salinas Court\n\n      left open the question whether Section 666 “requires some\n      other kind of connection between a bribe and the\n      expenditure of federal funds” lest it be applied in some\n      manner which would alter or fail to “give respect to the\n      federal-state balance” of powers [citation]. “Whatever\n      might be said about [§] 666(a)(1)(B)'s application in\n      other cases, the application of Section 666(a)(1)(B) to\n      Salinas did not extend federal power beyond its proper\n      bounds.” [citation].\n\n      Lipscomb follows with the observation that “[a]ny exercise of\n\nfederal jurisdiction must demonstrate a proper respect for concepts\n\nof dual sovereignty and federalism (citing the Tenth Amendment).\n\nThe    States'    constitutional     prerogatives   plainly   include\n\n'constitutional responsibility for the establishment and operation\n\nof its own government . . . .      [citing Gregory, 501 U.S. at 462].”\n\n\n                                   128\n\fHe adds, “As a constitutional principle, it simply cannot be that\n\n$10,000.00 in federal funds provided to a major city trumps the\n\nTenth Amendment and the prerogatives and responsibilities reserved\n\nto   the   States”   (referring      also   to   our   “republican       form   of\n\ngovernment”) (emphasis added).\n\n      Lipscomb further argues that § 666 is enacted under the\n\nSpending Clause, which has limits.               Beyond those limits, the\n\n“delicate   balance    of   federalism”     is    obliterated,      he   argues.\n\nFinally, Lipscomb notes that a prosecution under § 666 must be\n\n“undergirded by some adequate federal jurisdictional base” to avoid\n\nserious constitutional problems.”\n\n      Again, Lipscomb uses the term “jurisdiction” loosely, and he\n\nsometimes makes two arguments under one heading in his brief.\n\nNonetheless,    he    easily   has    raised     adequately   the    requisite\n\nconstitutional arguments.\n\n\n\n                                      II.\n\n      Despite the caption of this opinion as a dissent, this part II\n\nis not a dissent, because there is no majority decision, on this\n\nissue, from which to dissent.         Judge Wiener opines that § 666 is\n\nconstitutional as applied, and I conclude, to the contrary, that\n\nthe statute is unconstitutional as applied.              But Judge Duhé de-\n\nclines to address this issue, even in the alternative, despite that\n\nit is law of the case, under the majority holding of two judges,\n\n\n                                      129\n\fthat the issue is properly raised and preserved.\n\n     So, although a majority of this court holds that Lipscomb pro-\n\nperly raised and preserved this constitutional challenge, and al-\n\nthough this challenge, if decided, could lead to Lipscomb’s im-\n\nmediate release with no possibility of retrial, we do not rule on\n\nit. The government had no authority to try Lipscomb the first time\n\naround;   instead   of   announcing     that   fact   and   ending   these\n\nproceedings, we compound the error by forcing Lipscomb to undergo\n\na second illegitimate trial.\n\n     The full absurdity of today’s decision comes to light when we\n\nimagine the future of this case.      If Lipscomb is convicted a second\n\ntime, he presumably will appeal (if he lives that long; he is\n\nelderly and too ill to be incarcerated in prison).          In his second\n\nappeal, Lipscomb could argue the same constitutional claim before\n\nthis same courtSSperhaps even before this same panelSSand this time,\n\nbecause he was careful to omit the word “jurisdiction” from his\n\nbrief, he could be acquitted and told that the government never had\n\nthe power to try or detain him in the first case.           As I explain\n\nbelow, this should be our decision today.\n\n\n\n                                   A.\n\n     As Judge Wiener explains, Westmoreland’s broad construction of\n\n§ 666 continues to be the law in this circuit, so we are precluded\n\nfrom construing the statute to avoid a constitutional question. We\n\n\n\n                                 130\n\fmust, perforce, examine Lipscomb’s constitutional challenge to the\n\nstatute as applied.\n\n      Congress enacted § 666 under the Spending Clause.318 Phillips,\n\n219 F.3d at 414.     It is well recognized that Congress may use its\n\nspending power to regulate the states indirectly through the use of\n\nconditional grants. E.g., 1 LAURENCE H. TRIBE, AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW\n\n§ 5-6, at 833 (3d ed. 2000).        The power to regulate indirectly is\n\nnevertheless a limited one, as explained in South Dakota v. Dole,\n\n483 U.S. 203, 207-08 (1987).\n\n      Dole involved a statute conditioning a small portion of each\n\nstate’s federal highway aid on the state’s establishing a minimum\n\ndrinking age.    Id. at 205.    The Court upheld the condition based on\n\nCongress’s authority under the Spending Clause to “condition”\n\nstates’ access to federal funds.        Id. at 206.     The Court held that\n\nwhen Congress chooses to go beyond specific enumerated powers and\n\nto use its spending power “to further broad policy objectives by\n\nconditioning receipt of federal monies upon compliance with federal\n\nstatutory and administrative directives,” it must meet four condi-\n\ntions, the failure to meet any of which might render a statute un-\n\nconstitutionally broad:       (1) The power must be used in pursuit of\n\nthe general welfare; (2) Congress must state any conditions unam-\n\nbiguously; (3) conditions must be related to the federal interest\n\n\n      318\n         U.S. CONST. Art. I, § 8 (“Congress shall have Power to lay and collect\nTaxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common\nDefense and general Welfare of the United States . . . .”).\n\n                                     131\n\fin particular national projects or programs; and (4) conditions\n\nmust not violate other independent constitutional restrictions on\n\ngovernment activity.       Id. at 207-08.319\n\n      The    Dole     test     is    inappropriate        to   analyze      the\n\nconstitutionality of § 666, however, because the section does not\n\nqualify as a conditional-grant statute.          First, § 666 does not un-\n\nambiguously state that certain conditions attach to the receipt of\n\nany   particular    federal   grants.       Second,   a   condition    statute\n\ngenerally requires a state’s compliance with federal regulatory or\n\nadministrative directives in exchange for receipt of federal funds.\n\nVa. Dep’t of Educ. v. Riley, 106 F.3d 559, 570-72 (4th Cir. 1997)\n\n(en banc) (plurality opinion).\n\n      Section 666, however, neither requires an act of compliance\n\nnor applies directly to the recipient governments, as did the stat-\n\nute in Oklahoma v. United States Civil Serv. Comm’n, 330 U.S. 127\n\n(1947).320   Instead, § 666 applies directly to individuals; as the\n\n\n      319\n         At least one court has concluded that use of § 666 to prosecute crimes\nwith no federal nexus violates the Dole test’s third condition. See United\nStates v. McCormack, 31 F. Supp. 2d 176 (D. Mass. 1998) (finding the statute\nunconstitutional as applied where a defendant had bribed a local police officer\nto prevent that officer’s further investigation into a state crime, where the\nentity that received federal funds was the officer’s employing police\ndepartment).\n      320\n         In Oklahoma, the statute at issue placed “Hatch Act” limitations on any\nofficer or employee of any state or local agency whose principal employment was\nin connection with any activity that was financed in whole or in part by loans\nor grants made by the federal government. The condition on the state appears to\nhave been that either it would agree to fire any individual who, after an inves-\ntigation by the federal civil service commission, was found to have violated the\nstatute, or the commission in the future would be authorized to withhold, from\nthe state, an amount equal to twice that employee’s salary. The Dole Court cited\n                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                      132\n\fcourt in United States v. Cantor, 897 F. Supp. 110, 113 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n1995), stated persuasively, § 666 does not impose any conditions at\n\nall, much less conditions related to federal interests, on particu-\n\nlar national projects or programs:          “18 U.S.C. § 666 does not im-\n\npose a condition on the receipt of federal funds.                 The statute\n\nneither requires a state’s compliance with federal regulatory or\n\nadministrative directives, nor prevents state action.” Id. There-\n\nfore, § 666 cannot be classified as a conditional grant to the\n\nstates,321 and, correspondingly, Dole cannot be applied to analyze\n\nits constitutionality.322\n\n\n\n\n      320\n            (...continued)\nOklahoma as an example of the federal government’s conditioning receipt of fed-\neral funds on compliance by the recipient with federal statutory and adminis-\ntrative objectives. Dole, 483 U.S. at 206-07.\n      321\n         But see United States v. McCormack, 31 F. Supp. 2d 176 (D. Mass. 1998),\nwhich suggests that § 666 is a “condition” statute because the recipient can\navoid the statute’s application to its officials by not accepting federal funds\nof $10,000 or more. The McCormack court argued further that § 666 sets out fed-\neral requirements for recipient governments and prescribes negative consequences\nif those requirements are not followed. I disagree. A mere grant of money can-\nnot be called a condition, and Dole requires not just a condition, but an\nexplicitly stated condition. Section 666 fails this requirement.\n\n      322\n          If the Dole test were applicable, it would require a holding that § 666\nis unconstitutional as applied, because the third requirement of the Dole\ntestSSthat “conditions must (among other requirements) bear some relationship to\nthe federal spending,” New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167 (1992)SSis\nnot met. The only relationship the government can manage to muster between Lips-\ncomb’s violation of state criminal law and federal spending is that Yellow Cab’s\ntaxis sometimes go to a city airport that receives federal dollars for\nimprovements. This connection is so tenuous as to be no connection at all; were\nit enough to satisfy the Dole test, then “the spending power could render\nacademic the Constitution’s other grants and limits of federal authority.” Id.\n\n                                      133\n\f                                      B.\n\n       Recognizing that Dole does not answer the question, we turn\n\nelsewhere for constitutional grounding. In Salinas, the Court held\n\n§ 666 constitutional as applied, addressing constitutionality only\n\nbriefly:\n\n       [T]here is no serious doubt about the constitutionality\n       of § 666(a)(1)(B) as applied to the facts of this case.\n       Beltran was without question a prisoner held in a jail\n       managed pursuant to a series of agreements with the Fed-\n       eral Government. The preferential treatment accorded to\n       him was a threat to the integrity and proper operation of\n       the federal program.      Whatever might be said about\n       § 666(a)(1)(B)’s application in other cases, the\n       application of § 666(a)(1)(B) to Salinas did not extend\n       federal power beyond its proper bounds. See Westfall v.\n       United States, 274 U.S. 256, 259 (1927).\n\nSalinas, 522 U.S. at 60-61.      Unfortunately, the Court did not re-\n\nveal    the   framework   it   used   in    concluding   that   §   666   was\n\nconstitutionally applied in Salinas, nor did it say what test\n\nshould be used in determining whether other applications of the\n\nstatute are constitutional.       We conduct our own inquiry, because\n\nthis case, unlike Salinas, does not involve any readily apparent\n\nconnection to federal funds or programs.\n\n       As I have said, the fact that § 666 is not a direct exercise\n\nof the spending power does not doom its constitutionality.                The\n\nConstitution gives Congress the power “To make all Laws which shall\n\nbe necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing\n\npowers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the\n\nGovernment of the United States, or in any Department or Officer\n\n\n                                      134\n\fthereof.”    U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8.       Thus, to determine whether the\n\napplication of § 666 to Lipscomb’s acceptance of bribes by a local\n\ntaxi company is constitutional, we must decide whether prosecuting\n\nsuch behavior is “necessary and proper” to carrying out Congress’s\n\nspending power.323\n\n\n\n                                       1.\n\n      We examine the relevant legislative history to discover why\n\nCongress thought that § 666 was necessary and for what purposes it\n\ndeemed the statute proper, for although Congress is not the final\n\njudge of what is necessary and proper to carry out its powers, it\n\nis likely to have an informed opinion on the matter.              Such opinion\n\nis particularly persuasive to the extent that it finds legislation\n\nis necessary and proper only in limited circumstances, because, in\n\nsuch cases, we need not worry that Congress’s interpretation is\n\nmotivated by a desire to expand its power beyond proper bounds.\n\nThus, when Congress states that legislation passed as necessary and\n\nproper to carry out one of its enumerated powers is actually neces-\n\nsary only in certain circumstances, we should be hesitant to con-\n\n\n\n      323\n          Since the early days of the Republic, the Necessary and Proper Clause\nhas provided justification for laws necessary for the execution of Congressional\npowers. For example, in McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316 (1819), the Court\nheld that the enactment of a law establishing a national bank was necessary and\nproper to carrying into execution the spending power, the commerce power, the\ntaxing power, the power to coin money, and the war power. Chief Justice Marshall\ndescribed the reach of the clause as follows: “Let the end be legitimate, let\nit be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\nwhich are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with\nthe letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.” Id.\n\n                                      135\n\fclude that the Necessary and Proper Clause permits the legislation\n\nto reach further than Congress felt necessary or proper to carry\n\nout its delegated powers.\n\n     Courts have recognized the particular relevance of the legis-\n\nlative history of § 666 in casesSSlike thisSSin which that history\n\nshows Congress’s limited goals in drafting a broadly worded stat-\n\nute. The legislative history of the act shows that Congress passed\n\n§ 666 because it was concerned with its inability to protect fed-\n\neral funds once they are transferred from the federal government to\n\nstates, local governments, and agencies.    Section 666 “is designed\n\nto create new offenses to augment the ability of the United States\n\nto vindicate significant acts of theft, fraud, and bribery involv-\n\ning Federal monies that are disbursed to private organizations or\n\nState and local governments pursuant to a Federal program.”      1984\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 3510 (emphasis added).     Congress also stated that\n\n“the purpose of this section [is] to protect the integrity of the\n\nvast sums of money distributed through Federal programs from theft,\n\nfraud, and undue influence by bribery.”     Id. at 3511.\n\n     In Salinas, the Court noted that § 666 was enacted in response\n\nto specific difficulties the federal government had encountered un-\n\nder preceding statutes in prosecuting the theft of federal funds by\n\nnon-federal employees.   The Court explained:\n\n     Before § 666 was enacted, the federal criminal code con-\n     tained a single, general bribery provision codified at 18\n     U.S.C. § 201. Section 201 by its terms applied only to\n     “public official[s],” which the statute defined as “offi-\n\n                                136\n\f      cer[s] or employee[s] or person[s] acting for or on be-\n      half of the United States . . . .” § 201(a). The Courts\n      of Appeals divided over whether state and local employees\n      could be considered “public officials” under § 201(a)\n      . . . . § 666(a)(1)(B) was designed to extend federal\n      bribery prohibitions to bribes offered to state and local\n      officials employed by agencies receiving federal funds.\n      The facts and reasoning of [United States v.] Del Toro,\n      [513 F.2d 656, 661-62 (2d Cir. 1975)], give particular\n      instruction in this respect. In that case, the Second\n      Circuit held that a city employee was not a “public offi-\n      cial” under § 201(a) even though federal funds would\n      eventually cover 100% of the costs and 80% of the sala-\n      ries of the program he administered. 513 F.2d, at 662.\n      Because the program had not yet entered a formal request\n      for federal funding, the Second Circuit reasoned,\n      “[t]here were no existing committed federal funds for the\n      purpose.” Ibid. The enactment of § 666 forecloses this\n      type of limitation.\n\nSalinas, 522 U.S. at 58-59.        Moreover, in United States v. Zwick,\n\n199 F.3d 672, 684 (3d Cir. 1999), the court explained that under a\n\nseparate statute criminalizing the theft of federal property, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 641,\n\n      the federal government could prosecute only when it could\n      establish that the stolen property was property of the\n      United States, which often was impossible if title had\n      passed before the property was stolen or when federal\n      funds were so commingled with non-federal funds that the\n      federal character of those funds could not be shown.[324]\n\nFurthermore, the Senate Report states that the intent of § 666 is\n\n“to reach thefts and bribery in situations of the types involved in\n\nthe Del Toro, Hinton, and Mosley cases cited herein[.]”            S. REP. NO.\n\n98-225, 369-370, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3511.             The court in Zwick\n\n\n\n      324\n          Based on this legislative history, the Zwick court concluded that\n“[t]he goal [of § 666] was to overcome impediments to reaching actions in which\nthere was a federal interest, not to federalize crimes in which a federal\ninterest was lacking.” Zwick, 199 F.3d at 684.\n\n                                     137\n\fnoted that the corrupt transactions in these three cases all plain-\n\nly implicated federal interests.       Zwick, 199 F.3d at 684.\n\n     In Del Toro, the defendants conspired to bribe Pedro Morales,\n\nthe Assistant Administrator of the Harlem-East Harlem Model Cities\n\nProgram, for which the United States Department of Housing and Ur-\n\nban Development (“HUD”) paid 100% of the cost of the program and\n\n80% of its salaries. Because Morales was a city employee, however,\n\nthe court concluded that, notwithstanding that he was administering\n\na HUD program, he was not a “public official” for purposes of § 201\n\nand therefore could not be prosecuted.       Id.\n\n     Similarly, in United States v. Hinton, 683 F.2d 195, 198-200\n\n(7th Cir. 1982), aff’d sub nom. Dixson v. United States, 465 U.S.\n\n482 (1984), the defendants were officials of a non-profit corpora-\n\ntion that administered a HUD program and had discretion in the dis-\n\ntribution of HUD funds.   The court found that they were “public of-\n\nficials for purposes of § 201 because they exercised considerable\n\ndiscretion in the distribution of federal funds.       Id. at 198-200.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed but noted that, to be a “public offi-\n\ncial” under § 201(a), “an individual must possess some degree of\n\nresponsibility for carrying out a federal program or policy . . . .\n\nIndividuals who work for block grant recipients and business people\n\nwho provide recipients with goods and services cannot be said to be\n\npublic officials under section 201(a) unless they assume some du-\n\nties of an official nature.”     Dixson v. United States, 465 U.S.\n\n\n                                 138\n\f482, 499-500 (1984).\n\n      In United States v. Mosley, 659 F.2d 812, 816 (7th Cir. 1981),\n\nthe defendant, an Illinois state employee, was convicted of receiv-\n\ning bribes while evaluating applicants for jobs under a federally-\n\nfunded program.      Here again, the defendant was covered by § 201,\n\nbecause he exercised discretion in the administration of federal\n\nfunds.      In Zwick, the court concluded that the inclusion of these\n\ncases as examples of conduct that would be covered by § 666 showed\n\nthat Congress intended that the statute would be applied only in\n\ncorruption cases impacting federal interests.325\n\n      Although I do not agree that the plain language of § 666 al-\n\nlows prosecution only where the charged corrupt activity has impact\n\non a federal interest, the fact that Congress did not find it ne-\n\ncessary that § 666 be applied in cases not involving federal funds\n\nor programs is highly relevant to the issue of whether the stat-\n\nute’s application to local corruption not involving federal funds\n\nis “necessary and proper” to execute the spending power.                  Armed\n\nwith knowledge of Congress’s purpose in enacting § 666, I examine\n\nwhether the statute’s employment hereSSto prosecute a city coun-\n\n      325\n         See Zwick, 199 F.3d at 685 (holding that “nothing in the legislative\nhistory suggests that Congress intended to go well beyond the examples in Del\nToro, Hinton, and Mosley to make § 666 applicable when no federal interest is im-\nplicated by certain offense conduct.”).       The Zwick court also noted that\n“[a]nother comment in the Senate Report illustrates that an entity’s receipt of\nfederal funds does not automatically establish a federal interest in corrupt\nactivity of employees of that entity.” Id. The court quoted the Senate Report:\n“For example, if a government agency lawfully purchases more than $10,000 in\nequipment from a supplier, it is not the intent of this section to make a theft\nof $5,000 or more from the supplier a Federal crime.” Id. (quoting S. REP. NO.\n98-225, at 370, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3511).\n\n                                      139\n\fcilmember for accepting bribes in return for pursuing local taxi\n\nregulations beneficial to a local taxi companySSis “necessary and\n\nproper for carrying into execution” the spending power.                In other\n\nwords, what are the minimum factors that must be present to make a\n\nprosecution under § 666 “necessary and proper” under the spending\n\npower?\n\n       I am aware of no court that has dealt with the issue of what\n\nuses of § 666 are necessary and proper to effect the spending pow-\n\ner.    Of no help is United States v. Suarez, 263 F.3d 468 (6th Cir.\n\n2001).326    The Second and Third Circuits have narrowly interpreted\n\n§     666,   however,    for   the    express    purpose     of   avoiding     a\n\nconstitutional question.          Their views on what limitations are\n\nnecessary to keep § 666 within the realm of constitutionality are\n\ntherefore useful. In Zwick, the court interpreted § 666 to require\n\n\n       326\n         Suarez advances the position of neither side in the instant case.\nThere, the panel majority reluctantly upheld the conviction:\n\n             Were we writing on a clean slate, I like [the dissent],\n             might well agree that proper application of 18 U.S.C. §\n             666 requires a minimal nexus between the alleged\n             criminal activity and the federal funding received\n             pursuant to that statute. We are not, however[;] the\n             well established law of this Circuit [binds us].\n\nSuarez, 263 F.3d at 489. In Suarez, only the dissent analyzed the constitutional\nissue and Supreme Court precedent, and the dissent concluded that the statute was\nunconstitutional as applied:\n\n             To sustain Suarez’s conviction would make § 666 a\n             generalized anti-corruption statute under the spending\n             power.   The best reading of the Fischer and Salinas\n             cases seems to be that the Supreme Court does not want\n             this interpretation to take hold.\n\nId.   The dissenting judge voted to remand for development of the record on\nwhether there was a nexus between the crime and the federal program.\n\n                                      140\n\fa   relationship    between     the   prohibited   conduct     and   a   federal\n\ninterest,    because    doing    otherwise    would    raise   constitutional\n\nproblems:\n\n            Interpreting § 666 to have no federal interest\n            requirement produces serious concerns as to\n            whether Congress exceeded its power under the\n            Spending Clause in enacting this statute. See\n            McCormack, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 187-89. To pass\n            muster under the Spending Clause, legislation\n            regulating behavior of entities receiving\n            federal funds must, among other things, be\n            based   upon  a   federal   interest   in  the\n            particular conduct. See South Dakota v. Dole,\n            483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987). Applying § 666 to\n            offense conduct, absent evidence of any\n            federal interest, would appear to be an\n            unconstitutional exercise of power under the\n            Spending Clause.\n\nZwick, 199 F.3d at 687 (footnote omitted).            The court thus rejected\n\nthe government’s position that no connection between the bribery\n\nand the federal funds was necessary beyond proof that the agency in\n\nquestion had received federal funds in excess of $10,000.                 To do\n\notherwise, the court reasoned, would eviscerate significant fed-\n\neral-state boundaries by turning § 666 into a general anti-corrup-\n\ntion statute, an intention not expressed by Congress.                    Id. at\n\n686.327\n\n      In the pre-Salinas case of United States v. Foley, 73 F.3d\n\n484, 493 (2d Cir. 1996), the court held that the conduct prosecuted\n\nunder § 666 must be “shown in some way to touch upon federal\n\n      327\n          Although the court in Zwick seems to have applied a Dole analysis to\nthe issue, the court’s reasoning that a federal interest must be present to avoid\na constitutional question is persuasive, as well, in analyzing § 666’s constitu-\ntionality under the Necessary and Proper Clause.\n\n                                       141\n\ffunds.”    The court also held that the local government or agency\n\nwhose transaction involves $5,000 or more and at which the cor-\n\nruption is aimed must itself receive at least $10,000 in federal\n\nfunds.    Id.\n\n     The court re-evaluated Foley post-Salinas in United States v.\n\nSantopietro, 166 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. 1999), recognizing that Salinas\n\nhad made plain that the corruption need not have a value of $5,000\n\nto the local government on which the corruption is practiced.    In-\n\nstead, there only must be the receipt of at least $10,000 of feder-\n\nal funds and a corrupt transaction valued at $5,000 or more by any\n\nof the partiesSSthe local government, the party paying the bribe,\n\nor the bribe recipient.   Thus, the Santopietro court reversed and\n\nheld that the defendants could be convicted under § 666.        Even\n\nthough the bribery at issue did not result in a loss of $5,000 or\n\nmore to the town, the statutory requirement that a transaction of\n\nat least $5,000 be involved was plainly satisfied by the fact that\n\nthe total bribe was $25,000.   Id. at 92-93.\n\n     Santopietro, however, did not retreat from Foley’s requirement\n\nof “at least some connection between the bribe and a risk to the\n\nintegrity of the federal funded [sic] program,” because “nothing in\n\nSalinas disturbs such a requirement.”   Id. at 93.   The court held\n\nthat a federal connection sufficient to satisfy § 666 existed where\n\nreal estate developers had made corrupt payments to the mayor, the\n\nRepublican town chairman, and the president of the board of alder-\n\n\n                                142\n\fmen to secure their influence in landing city development contracts\n\nthat were substantially funded by HUD dollars.              Id.   The court held\n\nthat the evidence\n\n      satisfies the requirements of Foley, undisturbed by Sali-\n      nas, that the transaction sought to be influenced had\n      some connection with a federal program. Indeed, Salinas\n      may be read to indicate that the “threat to the integrity\n      and proper operation of [a] federal program” created by\n      the corrupt activity is necessary to assure that the\n      statute is not unconstitutionally applied.\n\nId. (quoting Salinas 522 U.S. at 60-61) (citation omitted) (alter-\n\nation in original).\n\n      The court made plain that there was a direct connection be-\n\ntween the bribery and the federally-funded programs and that “this\n\nis not a case where the transactions sought to be influenced con-\n\ncerned one department of a city and the requisite $10,000 of fed-\n\neral funds were received by a totally unrelated department.”                   Id.\n\nat 93-94.    The court stated that “even after Salinas, [the undis-\n\nturbed requirements of] Foley would not permit the Government to\n\nuse § 666(a)(1)(B) to prosecute a bribe paid to a city’s meat\n\ninspector in connection with a substantial transaction just because\n\nthe city’s     parks   department     had   received    a    federal   grant    of\n\n$10,000.”    Id.328\n\n      The reasoning of the Second and Third Circuits is persuasive.\n\n\n\n      328\n         But see United States v. Jennings, 160 F.3d 1006, 1012 (4th Cir. 1998)\n(interpreting § 666, without examining its constitutionality, to require no nexus\nbetween bribes and federal funding); United States v. Dakota, 197 F.3d 821 (6th\nCir. 1999) (same).\n\n                                      143\n\fIt is a tautology to say that for legislation to be necessary and\n\nproper for effecting the spending power, it must be related to that\n\npower in some way.     In other words, prohibiting activity that is\n\nunrelated to federal spending or programs cannot be necessary to\n\nexecute the spending power.\n\n     This is not to say that only activity that directly affects\n\nfederal funds may be prohibited.           Salinas made evident that the\n\nspending power can be rendered ineffectual not only where the in-\n\ntegrity of federal funds is compromised, but also where the in-\n\ntegrity of programs funded by those federal dollars is assaulted.\n\nThus, in Salinas the Court found that § 666 did not “extend federal\n\npower beyond its proper bounds,” id. at 61, where the statute was\n\nused to prosecute a state officer who had allowed himself to be\n\nbribed to influence his management of a federally funded program,\n\neven though no federal funds actually were diverted.           In Zwick, the\n\ncourt held that “a highly attenuated implication of a federal in-\n\nterest will suffice for purposes of § 666.”329\n\n\n     329\n         The court provided examples of attenuated connections that would be\nsufficient to allow prosecution under § 666:\n\n           We can conceive of several ways in which the government\n           could prove a federal interest in a § 666 [sic] in light\n           of this threshold. The amount of federal funds could\n           provide the requisite federal implication, even if the\n           purpose of those funds has no explicit relationship to\n           the subject of the bribe. If, for example, in a given\n           year, the greater part of a township's budget came from\n           federal funds, bribery of a township agent for any\n           purpose might be said to implicate federal interests.\n           Absent that situation, the offense conduct would have to\n           somehow implicate a particular substantive federal\n                                                              (continued...)\n\n                                     144\n\f                                        2.\n\n     The government goes far beyond the holding of Salinas and ar-\n\ngues that for a prosecution to be proper under § 666, no rela-\n\ntionship at all is required between federal funds or programs and\n\nlocal corruption.         The government argues that because funds are\n\nfungible, and the receipt of federal funds for any project frees a\n\nstate to spend more funds on other projects, no more is required\n\nfor a prosecution under § 666 than that a local government receive\n\nat least $10,000 in federal funds annually.\n\n     Although this is, strictly speaking, a correct textual inter-\n\npretation of § 666, the statute obviously does not satisfy consti-\n\ntutional requirements when used in this manner; it cannot be neces-\n\nsary and proper to executing the spending power for the government\n\nto prosecute local crimes that have no relationship whatsoever to\n\nfederal funds and programs.\n\n     Any argument that it is “necessary” to protect the spending\n\npower by passing legislation that regulates conduct totally unre-\n\nlated to federal spending is meritless on its face. Accepting this\n\nproposition would allow § 666 to become a general federal police\n\npower statute that criminalizes corruption in all local governments\n\nand private agencies receiving federal funds.\n\n\n     329\n           (...continued)\n              interest, as the Supreme Court found it did in Salinas,\n              where federal funds were being provided to house federal\n              prisoners in local prisons.\n\nZwick, 199 F.3d at 687.\n\n                                        145\n\f      Such a general police power is denied the federal government\n\nby constitutional design, for it is among those powers, reserved to\n\nthe states, that constitute the heart of state sovereignty.330             Fur-\n\nthermore, states have the primary authority to define and enforce\n\ncriminal law,331 United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 561 n.3\n\n(1995), and the “double security” embodied in the concept of feder-\n\nalism requires “a proper balance between the States and the Federal\n\nGovernment,” Gregory, 501 U.S. at 459.              Central to that balance,\n\nand to state sovereignty, is each state’s prerogative over the\n\n“constitutional responsibility for the establishment and operation\n\nof its own government . . . .”           Id. at 462.\n\n      Congress may pass laws criminalizing conduct that is already\n\nproscribed by the states, but this “change in the sensitive rela-\n\ntion between federal and state criminal jurisdiction”332 must be\n\n\n\n      330\n         See, e.g., United States v.

Enmons, 410 U.S. 396, 411-12 (1973) (quoting United\nStates v.

If adopted, the government’s argument that it is\n\nnecessary and proper, under the Spending Clause, for the federal\n\ngovernment to root out all local corruption whenever more than\n\n$10,000 of federal funds is received by a local government would\n\ncause a massive shift in the “balance between the States and the\n\nFederal      Government”     that   is   contrary    to   basic    concepts   of\n\nfederalism and the Tenth Amendment.333\n\n              This power cannot be said to be necessary and proper to\n\ncarrying into execution the spending power, because the means are\n\nnot appropriate, are well beyond “the scope of the constitution,”\n\nare inconsistent “with the letter and spirit of the constitution,”\n\nand thus are unconstitutional. McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316,\n\n421 (1819).334      Moreover, the government’s argument that no connec-\n\ntion need be shown between federal funds or programs and the local\n\ncorruption prosecuted under § 666 confuses a connection to a fed-\n\n\n\n      333\n          See U.S. CONST. amend. 10 (“The powers not delegated to the United\nStates by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to\nthe States respectively, or to the people.”).\n      334\n            See also Zwick, 199 F.3d at 686:\n\n              If we adopted the government’s interpretation that § 666\n              requires no connection between the offense conduct and\n              federal funds or programming, § 666 would criminalize a\n              host of corrupt acts committed by state agents, among\n              others, by virtue of the fact that all states receive at\n              least $10,000 in federal funds per year. See McCormack,\n              31 F. Supp. 2d at 186. This result raises significant\n              federalism concerns, turning traditionally local conduct\n              into a matter for federal enforcement involving a\n              substantial extension of federal law enforcement\n              resources.\n\n                                         147\n\feral interest in federally-funded programs with the federal gov-\n\nernment’s generalized interest in everything that occurs within its\n\nborders.\n\n      The government argues that the United States has an interest\n\nin the honesty of all officials, local and federal, and this is as-\n\nsuredly so.    The government has a similar interest in a great many\n\nthings that are, however, beyond its power to regulate directly.\n\nFor example, members of Congress profess sincere interest in a\n\nvariety of problemsSSfrom reducing crime to encouraging the sta-\n\nbility of marriageSSyet Congress has no more power directly to\n\ncriminalize local burglaries than it does to regulate marriage di-\n\nrectly.     In both cases, if the government wishes to pursue its in-\n\nterest, it must do so through targeted spending and conditional\n\ngrants of federal funds.335\n\n      It is this conflation of generalized federal interests with a\n\nfederal interest in a program (i.e., a connection to federal fund-\n\ning) that prompts the government to argue that any generalized in-\n\nterest of the United States suffices to allow federal criminaliza-\n\ntion of local matters, so long as some insignificant amount of fed-\n\neral funds are given to the locality.          Such an analysis turns the\n\naccepted understanding of the Necessary and Proper Clause on its\n\nhead and, in effect, asserts that because Congress may pursue the\n\n\n\n      335\n         For instance, the government may provide funds to put more local police\nofficers on the streets or may reform federal welfare spending in an effort to\ncreate incentives for families to stay together.\n\n                                      148\n\fgeneral welfare through the Spending Clause, all laws that are ne-\n\ncessary and proper to the general welfare must be considered con-\n\nstitutional under the Spending Clause.336           This argument, if fol-\n\nlowed, would overturn the accepted meaning of the Spending and the\n\nGeneral Welfare Clauses that has existed for nearly two centuries.\n\nSee generally 1 TRIBE, supra, § 5-6, at 831-34 (3d ed. 2000).\n\n\n\n                                      3.\n\n       The government argues, alternatively, that if a connection is\n\nrequired between federal funding or programs and the charged cor-\n\nruption, such connection is present in this case.           The federal con-\n\nnection that the government asserts, however, is exceedingly tenu-\n\nous.     The government avers that a federal connection existed be-\n\ntween Lipscomb’s acts of corruption and federal funds because\n\n       Lipscomb voted to seek and disburse federal money on im-\n       provements to Love Field airport. Thus, the federal gov-\n       ernment had an interest in the success of the airport, a\n       center of interstate travel. It is common sense that an\n       airport depends in part for its success on the taxicab\n       service provided for passengers. On the flip side, taxi-\n       cabs depend in part for their success on the viability of\n       airports, which provide fertile ground for fares.\n\n            If merely the airportSSrather than the city as a\n       wholeSSis seen as the analog of the jail in Salinas, that\n       case’s holding must extend to this one. Lipscomb, like\n       the jailer, was partly responsible for managing a feder-\n       ally-funded entity, the airport. The airport in turn\n\n\n       336\n         Using this reasoning, the government could as easily argue that under\nthe Commerce Clause, conduct may be criminalized wherever it is committed by one\nwho participates in interstate commerce, rather than only where there is some\nlink between the conduct and interstate commerce. In fact, this reasoning would\nallow federal police power under numerous clauses of the Constitution.\n\n                                      149\n\f     provided business to, and needed the business of, taxi-\n     cabs (including Richards’ taxicabs) for its successSSjust\n     as the jail had a direct relationship with the welfare of\n     the prisoner who paid the bribes. And just as the pre-\n     ferential treatment given to the prisoner was “a threat\n     to the integrity and proper operation of the federal pro-\n     gram,” Salinas, 522 U.S. at 61, so the preferential\n     treatment of Richards was a threat to the integrity of\n     the airport-funding program.\n\n     The government’s “cabs go to the airport” theory is feeble at\n\nbest.   The government may as well argue that because the United\n\nStates funds medical research at Dallas hospitals, and researchers\n\nsometimes take taxis, especially to airports to fly to conferences,\n\nthere is a sufficient nexus between taxis and federal funds.     Or,\n\nthe government could aver that federal funds go to pay welfare ben-\n\nefits and, because welfare recipients often cannot afford cars,\n\nthey may take taxis to the grocery store to use their food stamps,\n\nand thus federal prosecution of cases of local bribery affecting\n\ntaxi regulations is necessary to protect the spending power.      In\n\nsum, if the government’s posited connection between the federal\n\nfunds and the corruption is sufficient to provide nexus, any con-\n\nnection at all will do.\n\n     The facts of this case reveal no substantial relationship to\n\nfederal funds or programs, whereas in Salinas there were three\n\ndirect connections between federal funds and the corrupt activity.\n\nFirst, the prisoner paying the bribes was a federal prisoner.    Sec-\n\nond, the county jail in which the prisoner was housed had been con-\n\nstructed substantially with federal funds. Third, the prisoner was\n\n\n\n                                150\n\fin the jail as part of a federal program in which the county was\n\npaid per diem for each federal prisoner it housed.\n\n      Here, to the contrary, Richards, who was the person paying the\n\nbribes, had no federal status or connection. Neither the taxis nor\n\nthe city regulation of the taxi industry was funded by federal\n\nfunds in any way.      Finally, there was no federal program relating\n\nto taxi regulation, nor was the integrity of any federally funded\n\nprogram affected by the payment of Lipscomb to vote for certain\n\ntaxi regulations.\n\n      Thus, the connection between federal funds and the prosecuted\n\nactivity here is nothing like the direct connections between feder-\n\nally funded programs and corrupt activity in Salinas.                 It is far\n\nless substantial than even the most attenuated connections that the\n\nThird Circuit imagined might suffice to avoid constitutional ques-\n\ntions in Zwick.337     Under the specific facts of this case, the con\n\n\n      337\n         The “highly attenuated implication of a federal interest” that Zwick\nimagined would provide a “sufficient federal connection” to satisfy the\nrequirements of § 666 was a far less attenuated federal interest than is the one\nthe government asserts here. The Zwick court\n\n            conceive[d] of several ways in which the government\n            could prove a federal interest in § 666 . . . . If, for\n            example, in a given year, the greater part of a\n            township’s budget came from federal funds, bribery of a\n            township agent for any purpose might be said to impli-\n            cate federal interests.    Absent that situation, the\n            offense conduct would have to somehow implicate a par-\n            ticular substantive federal interest, as the Supreme\n            Court found it did in Salinas, where federal funds were\n            being provided to house federal prisoners in local\n            prisons.\n\nZwick, 199 F.3d at 687. The court cited further examples, including Santopietro,\nholding that bribes paid by real estate developers in search of development con-\n                                                              (continued...)\n\n                                      151\n\fnection to federal funds is insufficient, as a matter of law, to\n\nsupport a conclusion that the § 666 prosecution was necessary and\n\nproper to protect federal funding of Love Field or the city\n\ngenerally.338\n\n\n\n                                         4.\n\n      The government alternatively posits that, because the City of\n\nDallas received a sizeable amount of federal funds in real dollars,\n\nit was proper for Lipscomb’s bribery to be federally prosecuted.\n\nThe government points out that in 1998, the city accepted over $56\n\nmillion in federal funds. This, it argues, is a significant amount\n\nthat warrants the federal prosecution of a local official even for\n\n\n      337\n            (...continued)\ntracts with city agencies that were overseeing HUD programs met the federal nexus\nrequirement of § 666. Zwick also cited Frega, in which a district court con-\ncluded that bribery of state judges did not meet the requisite federal interest,\nbut hypothesized that a sufficient federal connection could exist in different\ncircumstances, such as if the state courts received federal funds for the purpose\nof appointing habeas counsel and the bribes paid affected the appointment of par-\nticular habeas counsel. Id. at 687-88.\n\n            Although these indeed are examples of federal connections that are\nsomewhat attenuated, nevertheless the federal interest in each example is plain,\nas is the necessity of protecting it against corruption so that Congress may\nproperly execute its spending power, free of the danger that federally funded\nprograms will be corrupted and perverted. The same cannot be said of Lipscomb’s\nprosecution, for no federal program was, in any way, affected by his corruption.\n      338\n          Moreover, this post hoc argumentSSthat the integrity of federal funding\nat the airport was endangered by Lipscomb’s taxicab corruptionSSwas never charged\nin the indictment or argued to the jury. Instead, the jury instructions merely\nstated:\n\n               It is also not necessary that the $10,000 in federal\n               assistance be directly involved in or traced to the\n               allegedly corrupt acts charged in the Indictment. All\n               that is necessary is that the City of Dallas received in\n               excess of $10,000 from the federal government during a\n               one-year period.\n\n                                         152\n\fmere local corruption.\n\n     The government contends that the receipt of this large amount\n\nof federal money would make the prosecution of Lipscomb pass muster\n\neven under Zwick.   This is plainly incorrect.   Zwick stated that if\n\n“the greater part of a township’s budget came from federal funds,\n\nbribery of a township agent for any purpose might be said to\n\nimplicate federal interests.”     Zwick, 199 F.3d at 687 (emphasis\n\nadded).   The city received over $56 million in 1998SSadmittedly a\n\nsignificant amount.      Because its 1988 budget was $1.6 billion,\n\nhowever, federal funds made up only 3.5% of the City’s budget.\n\n     This is nowhere near the example given in Zwick, where a fed-\n\neral interest could arise if the “greater part of a township’s bud-\n\nget” came from federal funds.     Indeed, if federal funding of as\n\nlittle as 3.5% of a city’s budget allows prosecution of a city of-\n\nficial, then the fact that every state and most cities receive more\n\nthan $10,000 in federal funds each year is alone enough to allow\n\nthe federalization of local corruption cases.        This cannot be\n\nnecessary and proper for executing the spending power.\n\n\n\n                                  5.\n\n     The government further contends that Lipscomb was not just any\n\ncity employee and that as a city councilman he “was one of fifteen\n\npeople responsible for running the City of Dallas.” The government\n\nthen argues that high officials, such as Lipscomb, always should be\n\n\n                                 153\n\fliable for prosecution under § 666, because high officials make de-\n\ncisions on the disposition of both local and federal funds, and\n\ntherefore dishonesty in the disposition of local funds is a proper\n\ncause of worry to the United States.339\n\n            The   government      contends    that    such    prosecution     is\n\nnecessary, because otherwise corrupt officials would be left in\n\nplace to administer federal funds in the same corrupt fashion that\n\nthey administer local matters.              While this argument has some\n\ninitial appeal, it ultimately has no merit.\n\n            First, it seems unlikely that, had the state prosecutor\n\nbeen given the fruits of the Lipscomb investigation, he would have\n\ndeclined to prosecute.       The charges against Lipscomb were serious,\n\nthe evidence was compelling, and Lipscomb was a high-profile public\n\nservantSSall factors that strongly argue for state prosecution.\n\n            Second, even if one thinks that states sometimes do not\n\nprosecute local crimes where federal prosecutors might do so, it\n\ndoes not follow that allowing double prosecution of local crimes\n\nwould deter corruption involving federal funds and programs.                 In-\n\nstead, allowing the double prosecution of local, but not federal,\n\n\n      339\n          Santopietro, 166 F.3d at 94 n.3, also raised this question, but did not\nanswer it:\n\n            We need not consider whether Santopietro’s role as\n            mayorSSthe chief executive officer of the city and hence\n            the officer ultimately responsible for all city depart-\n            mentsSSwould render the statute applicable to corrupt\n            payments received by him for any transaction involving\n            the city, even though the federal funds were received\n            for a program entirely unrelated to the program in\n            connection with which the corrupt payments were made.\n\n                                      154\n\fcorruption might tend to cause dishonest local officials to abuse\n\nfederal dollars rather than local funds.\n\n           Before § 666 was enacted, local embezzlement was covered\n\nby local penalties, and federal embezzlement was covered by federal\n\npenalties, with only small overlap.             Thus, before the advent of\n\n§ 666, a rational local official would simply weigh the rewards of\n\nembezzling local or federal funds against the risk of getting\n\ncaught and the probable penalty carried by each crime.                 He then\n\nwould commit those acts of embezzlement with the best ratio of\n\npayoff-to-punishment.         Because      of   the   severity   of    federal\n\npenalties, the most rational acts of embezzlement often would be\n\nlocal.\n\n           If § 666 is used to prosecute purely local acts of\n\ncorruption, however, this calculus changes substantially.              Federal\n\nacts of corruption still carry the same ratios of reward-to-\n\npunishment, but local crimes of corruption now qualify as both\n\nfederal and local crimes. Thus, federal embezzlement would be more\n\nrewarding at the margins than would be local embezzlement.                As a\n\nresult, rather than protecting federal funds and programs, § 666,\n\nif   applied   to   purely   local   crimes,    should   actually     cause   an\n\nincrease in the criminal misuse of federal funds; accordingly, it\n\ncannot be said that prosecution of local crimes under § 666 is\n\nnecessary and proper to carry into execution the spending power,\n\nand the application of § 666 to Lipscomb on the facts of this case\n\nis, accordingly, unconstitutional.\n\n                                     155\n\f                                     III.\n\n            The panel majority errs in deciding the question of\n\nvenue.      The majority teaches that it is better to force the\n\ngovernment    and      defendant    to   have   a   biased   trial    than   to\n\ninconvenience them with a five-hour drive or a one-hour flight.\n\nBecause this directly contradicts the plain text of our past\n\nprecedents, and all common sense, I respectfully dissent.\n\n            “The trial court has broad discretion in determining\n\nwhether a transfer is warranted.”340 “[A]bsent a showing of illicit\n\nmotivation, the transfer may be granted within the trial court’s\n\ndiscretion unless the defendant shows that a transfer would be\n\nprejudicial.”     Osum, 943 F.2d at 1399. Lipscomb makes two attempts\n\nto show prejudice; both are meritless.              First, Lipscomb asserts\n\nthat if he had been tried in Dallas, he would have had more blacks\n\nin his jury pool, and black jurors would have been more likely to\n\nacquit him, a black defendant.           Besides the fact that a criminal\n\ndefendant has no right to jury or venire of “any particular\n\ncomposition,” Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 538 (1975); United\n\nStates v. Sanchez, 508 F.2d 388, 395 (5th Cir. 1995), there is a\n\nnot a hint of an indication that the district court transferred the\n\ncase to alter the jury pool’s racial composition, see United States\n\nv. McKinney, 53 F.3d 664, 673 (5th Cir. 1995).\n\n\n      340\n          United States v. Osum, 943 F.2d 1394 (5th Cir. 1991); accord United\nStates v. Kaufman, 858 F.2d 994, 1006 (5th Cir. 1988); United States v. Weddell,\n800 F.2d 1404, 1406 (5th Cir. 1986).\n\n                                      156\n\f             Lipscomb     next    argues    that   Amarillo   was   inconvenient\n\nbecause it    “is 300 miles from Dallas,” and the “defendant and all\n\nof the witnesses resided in Dallas and every defense attorney\n\npracticed there.”         This cannot rise to the necessary level of\n\nprejudice.     We repeatedly have held that so long as the district\n\ncourt has some “valid reason for changing venue,” “travel and\n\nlodging expenses for lawyers and witnesses do not constitute\n\nprejudice sufficient to overcome a district court’s determination\n\nregarding the place of trial.”             United States v. Kaufman, 858 F.2d\n\n994, 1006 (5th Cir. 1988).           In Kaufmann, we held that a district\n\ncourt’s concern “that if it held trial in Austin, then [its] docket\n\nin Waco would have to be completely ignored” constituted such a\n\nvalid reason and outweighed the “only minor inconvenience” of a 102\n\nmile transfer.      Kaufmann, 858 F.2d at 1006.          If docket management\n\nconstitutes a valid reason for transfer, then surely a court’s\n\nconviction that it cannot provide a fair trial does.\n\n             Directly on point is United States v. Alvarado, 647 F.2d\n\n537 (5th Cir. Unit A June 1981).            We affirmed a sua sponte decision\n\nto transfer a case to a venue 231 miles away based on pretrial pub-\n\nlicity.       We   held    that    the     alleged   prejudicial    effects   of\n\n“additional travel and lodging expenses [for the defendants] and\n\ntheir attorneys in addition to the expenses that became necessary\n\nin order to subpoena crucial witnesses . . . do not rise to the\n\nlevel necessary to prove the trial judge abused his discretion by\n\n\n                                         157\n\ftransferring venue so as to avoid an unfair trial from a great deal\n\nof publicity.”     Id. at 539.\n\n            The majority seems to argue that Lipscomb’s case is\n\ndifferent because 300 miles is really far.             But Kaufmann makes no\n\nallowance for distance within a district.              What’s more, Kaufmann\n\nrelies on United States v. Fagan, 821 F.2d 1002, 1008 (5th Cir.\n\n1987), for its holding.         In Fagan, a FED. R. CRIM. P. 21 case, we\n\naffirmed the      refusal to transfer from the Southern District of\n\nTexas to the Eastern District of Louisiana. We noted “that holding\n\ntrial in Houston, rather than Louisiana, made it more disruptive to\n\n[the defendant], his witnesses, and his attorney” and may have cost\n\nhim the representation of a second attorney, but this was not\n\nenough to mandate transfer.         Id. at 1008.     If the 348-mile distance\n\nin Fagan was not prejudicial as a matter of law, then the 300 mile\n\ndistance in this case certainly is not.\n\n            Today’s     holding     has    the   potential    to   inject    great\n\nuncertainty into the trial process and actually to increase the\n\nnumber of unfair trials.       Luckily, future district courts will not\n\nbe bound by it.        The majority’s venue ruling plainly contradicts\n\nAlvarado,   and   it    is   well   established     that     “[w]hen   two   panel\n\nopinions appear in conflict, it is the earlier which controls.”\n\nHarvey v. Blake, 913 F.2d 226, 228 (5th Cir. 1990).                But, the fact\n\nthat today’s holding will not be binding does not make it any less\n\nin error.\n\n\n                                          158\n\fI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                     159\n\f",

Whether he raises a\n\nconstitutional challenge to his convictions, and, if so, how we\n\nshould rule on that challenge, are questions that have divided our\n\npanel three ways, as will become clear from our separate writings.\n\nDespite    this     tripartite   fractionation,   however,   different\n\nmajorities of the panel conclude that (1) the question of § 666’s\n\nas-applied constitutionality is properly before the panel and\n\nshould be addressed; (2) the district court had subject-matter\n\fjurisdiction of this criminal bribery case against Lipscomb; and\n\n(3) the court abused its discretion in transferring the trial sua\n\nsponte over Lipscomb’s objections.            We therefore reverse his\n\nconviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for a new trial.\n\n                                  I. FACTS\n\n     Both Lipscomb’s conduct and particular jurisdictional facts\n\nare important to the varying views of the members of this panel.\n\nWe therefore recount them in considerable detail.\n\nA.   Lipscomb’s Offense Conduct\n\n     Lipscomb served on the Dallas City Council (the “Council”)\n\nfrom 1984 to 1993 and again from 1995 until 2000.          During his first\n\nperiod   of   service,   Lipscomb    vigorously       opposed   any    measure\n\nfavorable to taxicab companies, including Yellow Cab and Checker\n\nCab (together, “Yellow Cab”), both owned by his co-conspirator,\n\nFloyd Richards. Lipscomb’s animus against cab companies apparently\n\nwas grounded in a belief that cab companies perennially failed to\n\nserve the minority community adequately.\n\n     During his second period of service on the Council, however,\n\nLipscomb demonstrated a considerably kinder disposition toward cab\n\ncompanies, especially Yellow Cab.            In 1994, during Lipscomb’s\n\nhiatus from the Council, Richards asked Lipscomb to help improve\n\nYellow Cab’s reputation in the minority community and offered to\n\npay Lipscomb $1,000 a month in cash for that help.                    Lipscomb\n\nassented to    this   proposal.     Richards    and    Lipscomb   agreed    to\n\ncontinue this arrangement as long as it was mutually agreeable.\n\n                                     2\n\fAll this transpired orally.\n\n      Richards continued to make the monthly payments to Lipscomb\n\nafter he was re-elected to the Council.         At times, Richards would\n\nreceive phone calls from Lipscomb indicating that he needed a\n\npayment, after which Lipscomb would visit Yellow Cab’s office and\n\nreceive cash that Richards took from the company safe.           Sometimes\n\nduring these meetings, Richards and Lipscomb would discuss taxicab\n\nissues then pending before the Council.           The government alleged\n\nthat in addition to making these monthly payments to Lipscomb,\n\nRichards gave Lipscomb free use of cars, free cellular telephone\n\nservice, and free cab rides worth more than $3,300.\n\n      When Lipscomb ran again, his advisers heard Richards declare\n\nthat he was willing to spend up to $30,000 to get Lipscomb elected.\n\nWhen Richards learned that corporations could not contribute to\n\ncampaigns and that individuals could contribute no more than\n\n$1,000, however, he decided to “lend” $20,500 to a business owned\n\nby Lipscomb’s daughter and son-in-law.         That money was intended by\n\nall concerned to help fund Lipscomb’s campaign, and it did so; but\n\nLipscomb did not report the campaign “loan” or any of the payments\n\nin   his   campaign   finance   reports   or    his   personal   financial\n\nstatements.\n\n      Richards testified that although he never made the quid pro\n\nquo explicit, he expected that, in return for the monthly payments\n\nand the campaign funding, Lipscomb would cast votes favorable to\n\nYellow Cab. Richards testified further that he and Lipscomb had an\n\n                                    3\n\funderstanding, and that Richards was satisfied that Lipscomb knew\n\nthat the payments would stop if he voted the wrong way.\n\n     Lipscomb’s support of Yellow Cab went far beyond the casting\n\nof favorable votes at meetings of the Council.   Over time, he and\n\nRichards discussed each of the taxicab issues on which Lipscomb\n\nallegedly was influenced by this bribery: (1) operating authority\n\nand fleet increases, (2) location of dispatch offices, (3) age\n\nlimits and inspections, and (4) insurance ratings.    Lipscomb had\n\nopposed Yellow Cab on these issues before 1994, but when he\n\nreturned to the Council, he supported that company vigorously and\n\noften.\n\n     For example, in 1994 Lipscomb, as a private citizen, had\n\nspoken out against authority for Yellow Cab and two other cab\n\ncompanies to operate in Dallas.   Once he returned to the council,\n\nthough, he supported Yellow Cab’s requests for increases in the\n\nsize of its cab fleets.   Yet when cab companies unaffiliated with\n\nRichards sought authority to operate in Dallas, Lipscomb urged that\n\ntheir applications be removed from the council’s agenda.      When\n\nanother cab company’s request for operating authority was taken up\n\nby the council, Lipscomb tried to require a voice vote on the\n\nmatter.\n\n     Yellow Cab also needed relief from a city ordinance requiring\n\ncab companies to maintain their dispatch offices inside the Dallas\n\ncity limits.   After a city staffer learned that Yellow Cab was\n\nviolating this policy, she sought to enforce it, but the Council\n\n                                  4\n\freferred the matter to its Transportation Committee.          Even though\n\nLipscomb did not serve on that committee, he attended its meeting\n\nand browbeat the staffer, going so far as to ask her when she would\n\nretire.   Eventually, with Lipscomb’s encouragement, the Council\n\npermitted cab companies to operate dispatch offices in the Dallas\n\nsuburbs, thus legitimating Yellow Cab’s office, the only one in\n\nviolation, in which Yellow Cab had invested $15,000.\n\n     Because   Yellow   Cab   had   the   newest   fleet   among   the   cab\n\ncompanies serving Dallas, the City was encouraged by Yellow Cab\n\nenergetically to enforce against its competitors the City’s age\n\nlimit on vehicles for hire and its requirement that they be\n\ninspected.   In 1992, Lipscomb had favored relaxing both rules, but\n\nin 1996, after he was told by Richards that he wanted stricter\n\nenforcement, Lipscomb began to support age limits on sedan-style\n\nlimousines similar to the limits that applied to taxicabs.         He also\n\nsought to remove older shuttles and limousines from service more\n\nquickly, and he opposed the Council’s effort to revisit its earlier\n\nvote —— favorable to Yellow Cab —— to approve stricter age limits.\n\n     Lipscomb also acted on Yellow Cab’s behalf with respect to\n\ninsurance issues.    Yellow Cab lobbied the Council to require that\n\nthe insurance coverage mandated for taxis be written by insurers\n\nwith favorable financial ratings.          This proposal proved to be\n\ncontroversial:      The City’s Director of Human Services, whose\n\ndepartment handled insurance matters, was concerned that a rating\n\nrequirement might favor large firms and exclude small businesses\n\n                                    5\n\fowned by minorities or women.   Lipscomb nevertheless sought to put\n\nthe rating requirement on the Council’s agenda, and both seconded\n\nand voted for a motion to increase the minimum rating.\n\n     In sum, Lipscomb energetically used many of the tools at the\n\ndisposal of a Council member —— his vote, his oversight authority,\n\nhis agenda-setting power, and his other parliamentary privileges ——\n\nto support policies favorable to Yellow Cab, even though these\n\npolicies conflicted with his previous positions.\n\nB.   Jurisdictional Facts\n\n     During Lipscomb’s second period of council service, the City,\n\nthrough many of its agencies and departments, received substantial\n\nfederal funds.    In the year ending in September 1996, Dallas\n\nreceived $44.3 million and spent $48.1 million in federal financial\n\nassistance which funded a wide range of joint priorities: community\n\ndevelopment, farmer’s market infrastructure, emergency shelter,\n\nhousing, community policing, airport and freeway improvements, arts\n\ndevelopment, pollution control, emergency management, interlibrary\n\ncooperation,   child   immunization,   homeless   health   care,   and\n\nsubstance abuse control, among others.     Federal support in 1996\n\ndwarfed state support, which totaled only $3.7 million received and\n\n$3.1 million spent.    Other years were similar: in 1997, the city\n\nreceived $54.3 million and spent $53.3 million in federal funds,\n\nbut received only $3.0 million and spent $3.8 million in state\n\nfunds.\n\n     Testimony of the city’s chief financial officer showed that in\n\n                                 6\n\fDallas’s efforts to obtain and then allocate federal funds, the\n\nCouncil played an integral role:\n\n          Q. And once the City gets the Department of Housing money\n     or grant funds, does the City then disburse those funds?\n          A. Yes, we do.\n          Q. And is the disbursement by approval of a City\n     Councilmember or the City Council at large?\n          A. If the individual expenditure is greater than $50,000,\n     or $15,000 in the case of professional services, it would come\n     back to the Council for approval of that specific contract.\n          Q. And does that frequently happen?\n          A. Yes, uh-huh.\n          Q. All right. And, in fact, does the Council have to\n     approve, vote for and approve the application to HUD and the\n     other agencies of the federal government to get federal money?\n          A. Yes. They vote for the application and the acceptance\n     of the money.\n\nThe Council as a whole thus controlled —— and individual council\n\nmembers influenced —— the City’s applications for, and receipt and\n\nexpenditure of, at least forty million federal dollars each year.\n\n                                 II. PROCEEDINGS\n\n     The government secured a lengthy indictment against Lipscomb.\n\nCounts 2 through 33 charged him with specific substantive                bribery\n\nviolations of § 666(a)(1)(B) and charged Richards with aiding and\n\nabetting those offenses.          Conversely, counts 34 through 65 charged\n\nRichards       with   bribery    violations   of   §   666(a)(2)   and   charged\n\nLipscomb with aiding and abetting.            Count 1 charged Lipscomb with\n\nconspiring to violate § 666.             Notably, the government did not\n\ncharge Lipscomb with the misuse of state or federal funds.\n\n     Three weeks before the long-scheduled trial date, the district\n\ncourt, acting sua sponte, without giving notice to the parties or\n\nholding    a    hearing,   and    over   Lipscomb’s    strenuous   objections,\n\n                                         7\n\ftransferred the trial from the Dallas Division of the Northern Dis-\n\ntrict of Texas to the Amarillo Division.               Thereafter, Richards\n\nentered into a plea agreement which, among other things, required\n\nhim to testify at trial.         The jury convicted Lipscomb on all\n\ncounts.       The   district   court       sentenced   him   to   41   months’\n\nimprisonment, imposed a $7,500 fine, and ordered him to pay a\n\n$6,500 special assessment.           The court also directed that the\n\nsentence be served under home confinement because of Lipscomb’s\n\nfailing health and advanced age.\n\n     Lipscomb appeals his conviction on several grounds.                    The\n\ngovernment    cross-appeals    the     home-confinement      aspect    of   his\n\nsentence.\n\n                     III. STATUTORY INTERPRETATION\n\nA.   Lipscomb’s Challenge to the Jurisdictional Reach of § 666\n\n     As it stood at the time and now stands, § 666 contains two\n\nmonetary thresholds.     Section 666 reads, in principal part:\n\n     § 666.    Theft or bribery concerning programs receiving\n               Federal funds\n          (a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in\n     subsection (b) of this section exists——\n               (1) being an agent of an organization, or of a\n          State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any\n          agency thereof——\n               ...\n                    (B) corruptly solicits or demands for the\n               benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to\n               accept, anything of value from any person,\n               intending to be influenced or rewarded in\n               connection with any business, transaction, or\n               series of transactions of such organization,\n               government, or agency involving anything of\n               value of $5,000 or more;\n\n\n                                       8\n\f               ...\n     shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than\n     10 years, or both.\n          (b) The circumstance referred to in subsection (a)\n     of this section is that the organization, government, or\n     agency receives, in any one year period, benefits in\n     excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a\n     grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or\n     other form of Federal assistance.1\n\nLipscomb insists that we should narrowly construe § 666 to avoid\n\nthe constitutional question that arises if we interpret the statute\n\nto prohibit activity not directly related to federal spending or\n\nfederally funded programs.     He proposes that we construe the\n\nstatute to require a nexus between his offense conduct and federal\n\nfunds —— or, put differently, that his conduct implicate a tangible\n\nfederal interest.   He also contends that, when so construed, the\n\nstatute does not reach his conduct.   Neither contention succeeds.\n\n     The phylogeny of § 666 jurisprudence does reflect a growing\n\ntension between two possible focuses of the statute.    One, which\n\nanother court has dubbed the “funds focus,” would concentrate on\n\ndeterring direct depletion of federal funds; the other, the so-\n\ncalled “corruption focus,” would combat “the corrupting, public-\n\ntrust eroding effects of bribery” and would not require that\n\nfederal funds be depleted or misallocated as a direct result of the\n\nbribe.2   Lipscomb’s proposal that we adopt the narrower, funds\n\nfocus, however, would require us to ignore our consistently broad\n\n     1\n      18 U.S.C. § 666 (2000) (emphasis added).\n     2\n      United States v.

Westmoreland and Its Progeny: The Corruption Focus —— No\n     Further Nexus Required\n\n     We first interpreted § 666 in United States v. Westmoreland.3\n\nThe defendant, Westmoreland, was a county supervisor who was\n\nconvicted of accepting bribes and kickbacks in connection with the\n\npurchasing    of    supplies   for   the    county’s    highway   construction\n\nprojects.4    The county received slightly more than $200,000 in\n\ntotal federal revenue-sharing funds, of which roughly 15% was\n\nallocated to Westmoreland’s district.5\n\n     Westmoreland contended that “the federal revenue sharing funds\n\nreceived [by her district]...were segregated and not expended for\n\nthe types of purchases she made.”6              She therefore argued that the\n\nbribery “concerned only state monies and did not fall within the\n\npurview of the statute.”7            We rejected such a construction as\n\n\n     3\n        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502711\"><a href=\"/opinion/502711/united-states-v-trudie-p-westmoreland/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1988).\n     4\n        Id. at 573–75.\n     5\n        Id. at 575.\n     6\n        Id.\n     7\n        Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 575.\n\n                                       10\n\fcontrary to the statute’s text:\n\n     Despite Westmoreland’s protestations, we find the\n     relevant statutory language plain and unambiguous. By\n     the terms of section 666, when a local government agency\n     receives an annual benefit of more than $10,000 under a\n     federal assistance program, its agents are governed by\n     the statute, and an agent violates subsection (b) when he\n     engages in the prohibited conduct “in any transaction or\n     matter or series of transactions or matters involving\n     $5,000 or more concerning the affairs of” the local\n     government agency.     18 U.S.C. § 666(b) (Supp. 1984)\n     (emphasis added).    Subsection (b) contains nothing to\n     indicate that “any transaction involving $5,000” means\n     “any federally funded transaction involving $5,000” or\n     “any transaction involving $5,000 of federal funds[.]”8\n\nWestmoreland also made the argument that Lipscomb makes here:\n\n“[A]n expansive interpretation [of § 666]...extends federal power\n\nin a manner that, in many instances, the federal interest at stake\n\ndoes not warrant.”9    The Westmoreland panel responded:\n\n     Once Congress has spoken, however, we do not sit to judge\n     the wisdom of its action. It is sufficient that Congress\n     seeks to preserve the integrity of federal funds by\n     assuring the integrity of the organizations or agencies\n     that receive them.... [T]he direct involvement of federal\n     funds in a transaction is not an essential element of\n     bribery under section 666(b); the government need not\n     prove that federal monies funded a corrupt transaction.10\n\nWestmoreland thus held that no connection was required between the\n\nfederal funds allocated to the county and the supervisor’s illegal\n\n\n\n     8\n      Id. at 576.\n     9\n      Id. at 577–78.\n     10\n      Id. at 578. We noted that “any reference to federal funds\nis conspicuously absent from the operative provisions [of § 666],\nand it is clear that Congress has cast a broad net to encompass\nlocal officials who may administer federal funds, regardless of\nwhether they actually do.” Id. at 577.\n\n                                  11\n\fconduct.     Instead, the only requisite involvement of federal funds\n\nwas the county’s receipt of more than $10,000 per year.11\n\n     Since     Westmoreland,   we   have   sometimes   applied   its   broad\n\nreading of § 666 unconditionally.         For example, in United States v.\n\nMoeller,12 the government appealed the dismissal of § 666 counts\n\nagainst employees of the Texas Federal Inspection Service (“TFIS”),\n\na cooperative venture of the agriculture departments of Texas and\n\nthe United States, in which state workers were empowered to conduct\n\nfederal inspections.13     Although we said that “there must be some\n\nnexus between the criminal conduct and the agency receiving federal\n\nassistance,” that nexus was purely textual:            It was present when\n\nthe Texas Department of Agriculture, a government agency for\n\npurposes of § 666, received more than $10,000 a year in federal\n\nfunds, and the defendants, TFIS employees, were agents of that\n\nfederally-funded agency.14      Thus Moeller cannot be read to have\n\nimposed the extratextual nexus that Lipscomb urges us to engraft on\n\n§ 666.\n\n     Some uncertainty seeped into our § 666 jurisprudence as a\n\n\n\n\n     11\n      Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 575–76.

The Salinas Speculation and Its Sequellae: The Funds Focus,\n     Requiring a Further Nexus\n\n     In reviewing Marmolejo, under the caption Salinas v. United\n\nStates,20 the Supreme Court asked whether § 666 is “limited to cases\n\nin which the bribe has a demonstrated effect upon federal funds.”21\n\nThe Court stated that “[t]he statute’s plain language fails to\n\nprovide any basis” for such a limitation and that the legislative\n\nhistory forecloses it.22       The Court thus agreed with our Marmolejo\n\nholding that federal funds need not be directly involved in a\n\nviolation of § 666.23         The Court nonetheless obliquely suggested\n\n\n     19\n      Id. at 1203 (Jolly, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original).\n“Turning to the precise legislative history, I find that it clearly\nreveals that Congress did not intend for § 666(a)(1)(B) to be\napplied to conduct such as the acceptance of bribes to allow\nconjugal visits.     Instead, Congress was only concerned with\nprotecting the federal monies disbursed to non-federal entities.”\nId.\n     20\n          </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118151\"><a href=\"/opinion/118151/salinas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997).\n     21\n          Id. at 54.\n     22\n          Id. at 57, 59.\n     23\n      Id. at 56–57 (citation omitted and brackets original):\n     The enactment’s expansive, unqualified language, both as\n     to the bribes forbidden and the entities covered, does\n     not support the interpretation that federal funds must be\n     affected to violate § 666(a)(1)(B)....     [T]he statute\n     forbids acceptance of a bribe by a covered official who\n     intends “to be influenced or rewarded in connection with\n\n                                       14\n\fthat there might be obstacles to applying § 666 to different facts:\n\n          We need not consider whether the statute requires\n     some other kind of connection between a bribe and the\n     expenditure of federal funds, for in this case the bribe\n     was related to the housing of a prisoner in facilities\n     paid for in significant part by federal funds themselves.\n     And that relationship is close enough to satisfy whatever\n     connection the statute might require.24\n\nEven so, the Court disposed of any constitutional question:\n\n          [T]here    is   no    serious   doubt   about    the\n     constitutionality of § 666(a)(1)(B) as applied to the\n     facts of this case. [The briber] was without question a\n     prisoner held in a jail managed pursuant to a series of\n     agreements with the Federal Government. The preferential\n     treatment accorded to him was a threat to the integrity\n     and proper operation of the federal program. Whatever\n     might be said about § 666(a)(1)(B)’s application in other\n     cases, the application of § 666(a)(1)(B) to Salinas did\n     not extend federal power beyond its proper bounds.25\n\n     Since Salinas, the Supreme Court has decided only one more\n\n§ 666 case: United States v. Fischer,26 which also sent mixed\n\nmessages.      Echoing Salinas, the Fischer Court described § 666 as\n\n“expansive, both as to the conduct forbidden and the entities\n\ncovered”27 and read the statute to reveal Congress’s “expansive,\n\n\n     any business, transaction, or series of transactions of\n     [the defined] organization, government or agency.” The\n     prohibition is not confined to a business or transaction\n     which affects federal funds.     The word “any,” which\n     prefaces the business or transaction clause, undercuts\n     the attempt to impose this narrowing construction.\n     24\n          Salinas, 522 U.S. at 59.\n     25\n          Id. at 60–61 (emphases added).\n     26\n          Fischer v.

The Salinas Court merely\n\nobserved in passing that, even if a federal interest were required,\n\nsuch an interest clearly existed in preventing federal prisoners\n\nfrom bribing local jail officials participating in a federal\n\nincarceration program.       Similarly, the Fischer Court construed a\n\nterm in § 666 broadly, simply musing that federalism principles\n\nmight somehow limit the statute’s sweep.         As either a statutory or\n\nconstitutional matter, then, the Court might be seen as harboring\n\ninchoate qualms about whether, for § 666 to apply, there might be\n\nsome need for a direct interest in the funds involved in the\n\nprohibited conduct (or, alternatively, a need for either a nexus\n\nbetween the federal dollars and the offense conduct or an extra-\n\ntextual jurisdictional element to § 666).           Lipscomb argues this\n\ninference forcefully, noting that Salinas left open the question\n\nwhether § 666 “requires some other kind of connection between a\n\nbribe and the expenditure of federal funds.”32               He urges us to\n\noverlook Westmoreland and answer this question in the affirmative.\n\n     This, of course, we could not do even if we were so inclined.\n\nMere ruminations      in   Supreme   Court   opinions   do   not   empower   a\n\nsubsequent panel of our court to disregard, much less overrule, the\n\nholding of a prior panel.      And, as we noted just last year, “[w]e\n\nare not convinced that Salinas wrought a change upon our earlier\n\n\n\n\n     32\n          Salinas, 522 U.S. at 59.\n\n                                     17\n\fprecedents.”33    Because Salinas and Fischer went no further than to\n\nadvert in dicta to the mere possibility that the argument now\n\nadvanced by Lipscomb might someday be favored, we are bound to\n\nadhere to Westmoreland’s statutory holding.34\n\n     Likewise, our post-Salinas decisions interpreting § 666 must\n\nbe read as adhering to this rule.         Nevertheless, the cautionary\n\nwords in Salinas and Fischer, combined with our prior opinions’\n\nsilence on the constitutional question, divided the next panel of\n\nthis court to interpret § 666.    The panel majority in United States\n\nv. Phillips35 reiterated Moeller’s requirement of a nexus between\n\nthe misconduct and the agency (as distinct from a nexus between the\n\nmisconduct and the federal funds themselves),36 but added some\n\nextra-textual teeth in holding that defendant Phillips, a tax\n\nassessor, was not an “agent” of Louisiana’s St. Helena Parish,\n\nwhich received over $10,000 in federal funds, so as to be liable\n\nhimself under § 666 for putting on his payroll a political ally who\n\n\n\n     33\n      United States v.

The statute possibly can reach misuse of\n       virtually all funds of an agency that administers the\n       federal program in question. It is a different matter\n       altogether, however, to suggest that the statute can\n       reach any government employee who misappropriates purely\n       local funds, without regard to how organizationally\n       removed the employee is from the particular agency that\n       administers the federal program.38\n\nWe acknowledge that it is at least arguable, albeit tenuously, that\n\nthis        “organizationally          removed”       language      conflicts       with\n\nWestmoreland         and    Moeller,    even    though    the     Phillips    majority\n\npurported       to    distinguish      those    two    cases    factually,    and   the\n\nPhillips panel may be perceived as having favored the “funds focus”\n\n\n       37\n            Phillips, 219 F.3d at 407–08, 411–15.\n       38\n      Id. at 411 (citations omitted and emphasis added). To the\npanel majority, the legislative history of § 666 revealed\n“Congress’ concern with a defendant’s ability to administer or\ncontrol the federal funds provided to a particular agency,” id. at\n411 n.7, and Fischer counseled that “the fraud must have the\npotential to affect the identified federal funds or program,” id.\nat 412 n.13.

To the extent that there is a conflict, however, the\n\nolder case controls, as the Phillips dissenter correctly noted.39\n\n     Only     by   interpreting      “agent”     narrowly   was    the    Phillips\n\nmajority able to avoid the constitutional question.40                 The Phillips\n\ndissent read our own precedents as rejecting any nexus requirement\n\nwhatsoever     and   took    issue   with    the   panel    majority’s      narrow\n\ndefinition of “agent.”41         The dissent asserted that a “specific\n\nnexus —— between Phillips and the federal funds inside Parish\n\ncoffers —— is not required” and furthermore that “it is sufficient\n\nthat the criminal conduct affect the agency receiving federal\n\nassistance:        in essence, we have determined that there is an\n\ninherent federal interest in insuring that agencies receiving\n\nsignificant amounts of federal funding are not corrupt.”42                      In a\n\nnutshell, this is precisely the “corruption focus” that we had\n\nfirmly adopted       in    Westmoreland,     a   focus   that   has     never   been\n\noverruled either by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\n\nD.

Reyes,43 we affirmed the § 666 conviction of city\n\ncouncil members who had been bribed to vote in favor of awarding a\n\nmunicipal construction project to a particular contractor.44      The\n\ngovernment noted that a federal loan would have supported the\n\nproject had it gone forward, but we explicitly declined to rely on\n\nthat fact, stating instead that federal support of the three city\n\ndepartments involved in the project —— the finance, housing, and\n\nlegal departments —— justified prosecuting under § 66645:\n\n     Applying Westmoreland and Moeller..., we conclude that\n     the connection between federal benefits and the charged\n     conduct is sufficient to uphold Reyes’s convictions under\n     § 666.... Like the county supervisor in Westmoreland and\n     the senior agency officials in Moeller, here the charged\n     criminal conduct related to city council members, who, by\n     voting up or down on bids, ultimately decide how federal\n     money will be spent.46\n\nSuch an analysis firmly supports Lipscomb’s susceptibility to\n\nconviction under § 666: In Dallas, federal money supports the\n\nCity’s transportation and human services departments —— the very\n\nagencies of city government that Lipscomb sought corruptly to\n\ninfluence.     Reyes reaffirms, as a statutory matter, that whatever\n\nnexus § 666 requires —— if any —— is present in this case.\n\n\n\n\n     43\n          United States v.

Williams involved facts virtually\n\nidentical to those present in Reyes, in Westmoreland, and here.\n\nWilliams, a former member of the Jackson, Mississippi City Council,\n\nwas convicted under § 666 of aiding and abetting the solicitation\n\nand acceptance of bribes —— specifically, $150,000 in exchange for\n\na re-vote on a cable television license contract.48               The Williams\n\ncourt did not describe any direct federal fiscal interest at stake\n\nin that re-vote.           Such questions, however, may not have been\n\nbriefed     or    argued   in   Williams,   as   the   opinion   in   that   case\n\nexpressly rejected only other challenges —— those grounded in equal\n\nprotection, due process, and sufficiency and admissibility of the\n\nevidence     ——    to   Williams’s   conviction.49      Taken    in   isolation,\n\nWilliams has little if any precedential value on the nexus issue,\n\none way or the other.\n\n     But of course Williams does not stand alone.

The Phillips panel did\n\nconstrue the term “agent” to avoid the constitutional question, but\n\nwe cannot do that here: As a textual matter, the term “agent”\n\nplainly includes city council members.                    Westmoreland applied § 666\n\nto a county supervisor; Reyes and Williams both applied it to city\n\ncouncil members.       Hence Westmoreland’s view of § 666 continues to\n\nbe   the   law   in    this    circuit       and     to    preclude    a    more   narrow\n\nconstruction of the statute.             Even though we get to the question\n\nfrom different jurisdictional perspectives, Judge Duhé and I are in\n\ncomplete accord        on   the    result     for     Lipscomb    of       the   foregoing\n\nanalysis of § 666:            He was subject to being tried in federal\n\ndistrict court for violating that statute, and he was subject to\n\nbeing convicted by a jury.\n\n           IV. DID LIPSCOMB RAISE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE?\n\n      Before addressing the constitutional problem that Lipscomb’s\n\nstatutory-construction argument presages (and writing for myself\n\nalone, although supplementing Judge Smith’s analysis), I must make\n\nthree observations on our intrapanel disagreement over whether the\n\nconstitutional issue is properly before us.                     To me, this debate:\n\n(1) is more semantical than substantive, (2) is in tension with\n\ncontrolling Supreme Court precedent, and (3) overlooks the real\n\nnature of the constitutional question at issue.\n\n      Semantics       first:      As   the        Supreme    Court     recently     said,\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f“jurisdiction...is a word of many, too many, meanings.”50                             This\n\nimprecision is one source of our panel’s split here.                          Judge Duhé\n\nreads “jurisdiction” in the pleadings, briefs, and record to mean\n\nadjudicative jurisdiction only —— the authority of federal courts\n\nto   hear       only    those         categories        of   cases    (subject-matter\n\njurisdiction) authorized by Congress, between those categories of\n\npersons (personal jurisdiction) permitted by the Constitution. But\n\nin the context of the expressly constitutional arguments that\n\nLipscomb sometimes makes, Judge Smith and I read his use of\n\n“jurisdiction”         ——     at     least    on   those     occasions    ——    to    mean\n\nlegislative jurisdiction, the “authority” of Congress “to make its\n\nlaw applicable to particular persons or activities.”51\n\n     Lipscomb          also        uses      the    ambiguous        phrase     “federal\n\njurisdiction,” which could be either adjudicative or legislative.\n\nThat ambiguity is not only terminological, but also conceptual. To\n\nstate     the    obvious,          legislative     jurisdiction       flows    from   the\n\nConstitution to the Congress and limits, in today’s context, the\n\nsubject matter         and     the    classes      of   persons   that   Congress     may\n\nregulate    by    statute.           In   contrast,      adjudicative    jurisdiction\n\ngenerally flows from Congress to the courts as grants of subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction, grants made by Congress in enacting laws\n\n     50\n      Steel Co. v.

Consequently, a court’s\n\nadjudicative jurisdiction to convict a defendant of a federal crime\n\ncannot exist in the absence of Congress’s legislative jurisdiction\n\nto criminalize the particular conduct of which the particular\n\ndefendant is accused.\n\n     The reach of Congress’s legislative jurisdiction, of course,\n\nis sometimes bounded by structural constitutional provisions.                    For\n\nexample, grants of jurisdiction are limited by the Necessary and\n\nProper Clause, which covers laws that “carry into Execution...all\n\nother powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the\n\nUnited States or in any Department or Officer thereof.”53                   I cannot\n\neven imagine how it could be “necessary and proper” to the exercise\n\nof either the judicial power or the power to constitute inferior\n\ncourts for      us   to    have   adjudicative      jurisdiction     over    a   case\n\nimplicating      a   statute      that   Congress     lacked   the    legislative\n\njurisdiction to enact.

In this sense, because Lipscomb\n\nappears to raise a structural jurisdictional challenge, I question\n\nwhether his is the kind of constitutional argument that may be\n\nwaived through delay or disuse; if it “involves a court’s power to\n\nhear a case, [it] can never be forfeited or waived.”58\n\n     As I read them, Lipscomb’s pleadings and briefs do raise ——\n\nand thus do not waive —— the constitutional issue.          Rather, they\n\nquestion both Congress’s legislative jurisdiction (constitutional\n\nauthority) to enact § 666 and our adjudicative power to apply § 666\n\nhere.      Lipscomb has raised a classic challenge to subject-matter\n\njurisdiction: He “argues that the extension of federal jurisdiction\n\nover acts such as [his] would exceed the power of Congress.”59\n\n     My belief that we should consider this argument finds support\n\nin Salinas itself.

The Dole Test Is Instructive Here\n\n     Given Dole’s context, applying its test to § 666 could be\n\ntrebly problematic.        First, like Judge Smith, two district courts\n\nhave concluded that § 666 is not a conditional-grant statute at\n\nall, because it does not require the state (here, Texas) or its\n\npolitical subdivision (here, Dallas) to do anything.82 As the court\n\nin United States v. Cantor noted, § 666 “does not impose a\n\ncondition on the receipt of federal funds.            The statute neither\n\nrequires   a     state’s    compliance    with   federal...directives   nor\n\nprevents state action.”83 Like the Cantor court, however, I believe\n\nthat this lack of direct effect on states and localities actually\n\nsupports   the    statute’s    constitutionality.84      Furthermore,   the\n\n     81\n      Id. at 207-08. At least one court has concluded that use of\n§ 666 to prosecute crimes with no federal nexus violates the Dole\ntest’s third condition.    See United States v. McCormack, 31 F.\nSupp. 2d 176 (D.

The Dole Analysis\n\n     Dole first requires that “exercise of the spending power must\n\nbe in pursuit of the general welfare.”90          In assessing whether this\n\nis so, Dole cautions, “courts should defer substantially to the\n\njudgment of Congress.”91         Congress has stated that the purpose of\n\n§ 666 is to “protect the integrity of the vast sums of money\n\ndistributed through Federal programs from theft, fraud, and undue\n\ninfluence     by   bribery.”92     Mindful   of   the    deference   due   this\n\njudgment, I accept that Congress easily could have thought that\n\n§ 666 advanced the general welfare by protecting the federal fisc\n\nand by ensuring that state and local decisions regarding federal\n\nprograms are not made by corrupt officials.             I do not doubt, then,\n\nthat Congress enacted § 666 “in pursuit of the general welfare.”\n\n     Second, Dole warns that “if Congress desires to condition the\n\nStates’ receipt of federal funds, it must do so unambiguously...,\n\nenabl[ing] the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant\n\n\n\n\n     90\n      Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 (citing Helvering v.

Thus\n\nthe states arguably have a dignity interest at stake, and if so,\n\nthey have a right to know the threat to that interest that § 666\n\nwould pose —— and the language of § 666, which is anything but\n\nambiguous, surely lets them know.       To the extent that § 666 is a\n\nconditional-grant statute, both the grant (of $10,000 or more in\n\nfederal funds) and the condition (criminalizing official bribery\n\nand theft) are pellucid.94      I see little danger that a state or\n\nlocality that receives federal funds could mistake the potential of\n\n§ 666 to criminalize conduct by its officials.\n\n     Third, Dole mandates that conditions on federal spending be\n\nrelated “to the federal interest in particular national projects or\n\nprograms,”95 or that conditions “bear some relationship to the\n\nfederal spending.”96    “The required degree of this relationship is\n\none of reasonableness or minimum rationality.”97     It suffices here\n\n\n     93\n      Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 (citing Pennhurst State School and\nHospital v.

Legislative History\n\n      History often tells us why Congress deemed a statute necessary\n\nand proper.       Not so for § 666, however, because it was enacted as\n\npart of an omnibus spending bill of the type that makes the search\n\nfor   legislative     history   Sisyphean.    What   history   exists   is\n\nmultilayered, sparse, equivocal, and even mysterious. By no means,\n\nI respectfully submit, is it capable of supporting Judge Smith’s\n\ncontention that “Congress did not find it necessary that § 666 be\n\napplied in cases not involving federal funds or programs.”112\n\n      1.       The 1986 Technical Amendment\n\n      We owe the current language of § 666 to the Criminal Law and\n\nProcedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986.113       As that Act’s title\n\nsuggests, and as we recognized in Westmoreland,114 Congress did not\n\nintend the Act to change § 666 substantively in ways that would\n\naffect our reading of it here.115        This is important, because the\n\n\n      112\n            Infra at __.\n      113\n            P.L. 99-646, § 59, 100 Stat. 3592, 3612–13 (1986).\n      114\n       Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 577 (“[T]he amended version of\nsection 666 reinforces our interpretation. . . .

The 1984 Enactment\n\n     As first enacted, § 666(b) read:\n\n     Whoever, being an agent of an organization, or of a State\n     or local government agency...[that receives more than\n     $10,000 a year in federal funds], solicits, demands,\n     accepts, or agrees to accept anything of value from a\n     person or organization other than his employer or\n     principal for or because of the recipient’s conduct in\n     any transaction or matter or a series of transactions or\n     matters involving $5,000 or more concerning the affairs\n     of such organization or State or local government agency,\n     shall be imprisoned....116\n\nThe emphasized phrase strongly suggests that in 1984 Congress\n\nbelieved it necessary and proper for § 666 to reach bribery that\n\nhad no relation to federal funds.\n\n     3.

Thus, 18 U.S.C. 666\n     prohibits corruptly giving or receiving anything of value\n     for the purpose of influencing or being influenced in\n     connection with any business, transaction, or series of\n     transactions.\n     116\n       Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473,\n§ 1104(a), 98 Stat. 1837, 2143—44 (1984).\n\n                                43\n\fJudge Smith relies heavily on a Senate Judiciary Committee report,\n\nbut this report described a different bill that never became law.\n\nAs eventually enacted, § 666 was a small part of a large crime bill\n\nwhich was engrafted on a huge omnibus spending bill that funded\n\nmany departments and agencies.117            None of this bill’s reports,\n\nwritten as they were by the Appropriations Committees, gives\n\ncontext      for   §   666,   a   criminal    statute   which,   of   course,\n\nappropriated no funds.118\n\n     Section 666 as enacted was identical to a provision in the\n\nComprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, which passed the Senate\n\nbut never made it out of the House Judiciary Committee on its own\n\nand evidently had to piggyback on the omnibus spending bill to gain\n\nlegislative momentum.119          The Senate report on the crime bill,\n\n\n\n     117\n       See Pub L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. at 1837–2199. Entering “98\nP.L. 473” on Lexis retrieves a list of the omnibus bill’s twenty-\neight short titles and a sense of its massive scope; it included\nfive of the thirteen appropriations bills for fiscal year 1985.\nA summary of the bill, H.J. Res. 648 (98th Cong.), is available at\nhttp://thomas.loc.gov (visited Oct. 13, 2001).\n     118\n       See H.R. REP. NO. 98-1159 (1984) (conference report),\nreprinted in 130 Cong. Rec. 31445 (Oct. 10, 1984); S. REP. NO. 98-\n634 (1984) (Senate Appropriations, accompanying S.J. Res. 356); and\nH.R. REP. NO. 98-1030 (1984) (House Appropriations). Parts of the\nconference report are reprinted at 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3710–17; for\nthe conference report’s entire discussion of the crime bill, see\n130 Cong. Rec. at 31565–67.\n     The absence of language interpreting § 666 from the reports on\nthis bill is understandable also as a result of the omnibus bill’s\ntiming. Congress enacted it and the President signed it during\nOctober 10–12, 1984, less than a month before an election. See 98\nStat. at 2199.\n     119\n           See 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3182.\n\n                                      44\n\fprinted in 1983, can be taken as an authoritative statement of the\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee’s intent for what became § 666.         It is\n\ntenuous at best, however, to rely, as does Judge Smith, solely on\n\none committee report —— on a wholly separate bill —— as stating the\n\nviews of the entire Congress.\n\n     The questionable probative weight of the Senate report aside,\n\nthat report is still not determinative here, for the evidence goes\n\nboth ways.       The relevant passage is titled “Part C—Program Fraud\n\nand Bribery,” and states that § 666\n\n     is designed to create new offenses to augment the ability\n     of the United States to vindicate significant acts of\n     theft, fraud, and bribery involving Federal monies that\n     are disbursed to private organizations or State and local\n     governments pursuant to a Federal program.120\n\nThe report notes, however, that under the prior law banning theft\n\nof federal property, prosecuting was often impossible\n\n     because title has passed to the recipient [government]\n     before the property is stolen, or the funds are so\n     commingled that the Federal character of the funds cannot\n     be shown. This gives rise to a serious gap in the law,\n     since even though title to the monies may have passed,\n     the Federal Government clearly retains a strong interest\n     in assuring the integrity of such program funds.121\n\nEven though the report’s emphasis on program funds would support a\n\nnarrow reading of the necessity and propriety of § 666, its\n\nemphasis on commingling supports a broad one.     In fact, the Senate\n\nJudiciary Committee’s most explicit direction actually suggests\n\n     120\n       S. REP NO. 98-225, at 369 (1984),          reprinted   in    1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3510 (emphases added).\n     121\n           Id.\n\n                                   45\n\fthat the Committee intended to limit the scope of § 666, but in a\n\nway that still would cover Lipscomb-like conduct:\n\n     The Committee intends that the term “Federal program\n     involving a grant, a contract, a subsidy, a loan, a\n     guarantee, insurance, or another form of Federal\n     assistance” be construed broadly, consistent with the\n     purpose of this section to protect the integrity of the\n     vast sums of money distributed through Federal programs\n     from theft, fraud, and undue influence by bribery.\n     However, the concept is not unlimited. The term “Federal\n     program” means that there must exist a specific statutory\n     scheme authorizing the Federal assistance in order to\n     promote and achieve certain policy objectives. Thus, not\n     every Federal contract or disbursement of funds would be\n     covered. For example, if a government agency lawfully\n     purchases more than $10,000 in equipment from a supplier,\n     it is not the intent of this section to make a theft of\n     $5,000 or more from the supplier a Federal crime.122\n\nThus one of the two lines that the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nexpressly drew —— to exclude theft from a supplier from the\n\ncoverage     of     §   666   ——   would   not   exclude   Lipscomb’s   conduct,\n\nquintessentially “undue influence by bribery.”\n\n     4.          The Specified Cases\n\n     The immediate next sentence in the report, subject to much\n\nexegesis by Judge Smith, states:            “It is, however, the intent [‘of\n\nthis section’] to reach thefts and bribery in situations of the\n\ntypes involved in the Del Toro, Hinton, and Mosley cases.”123               With\n\ncontinued due respect to Judge Smith, I do not discern in this\n\nsentence any clear direction to us.                  Both Hinton and Mosley\n\n\n     122\n       S. REP NO. 98-225, at 370, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\n3511 (emphasis added).\n     123\n           Id.\n\n                                           46\n\fsustained      convictions    of   bribed     local   officials   whom   courts\n\nconsidered to be federal officials under the prior bribery statute\n\nbecause      they   exerted   federal        authority   and   controlled   the\n\ndisbursement of federal funds.124            Simple logic dictates that just\n\nbecause the Committee intended § 666 in part to codify these cases\n\ndoes not meant that it sought to limit § 666 to these cases\n\nexclusively.\n\n     In Del Toro, the federal interest was more attenuated.                 The\n\ndefendants were convicted of bribing a New York City official to\n\nensure that they would supply office space to a city program that\n\nwas eligible for federal funds.125              The Del Toro court reversed\n\nthese bribery convictions, noting that even if the official had\n\nsucceeded in provisionally securing the lease as desired, three\n\nlocal agencies would have had to approve the lease before the city\n\ncould apply to the federal government for funds, so that “[t]here\n\nwere no existing committed federal funds for the purpose.”126               The\n\nSenate Committee’s intent to overrule Del Toro thus reflects that\n\nthe Committee thought it necessary and proper for § 666 to reach\n\n\n\n\n     124\n       United States v.

The 1981 Bill\n\n     The plot thickens still further when an effort is made to\n\nverify the assertion in the 1983 report that the language of § 666\n\nwas derived from a 1981 bill that never became law.128     The 1981\n\nbill and its report emerged from Senate Judiciary —— the same\n\ncommittee that later wrote the 1983 bill and report.   The Committee\n\nomitted from both the 1983 bill and the 1984 act, however, the very\n\nlanguage in the 1981 bill that would have answered our question:\n\n          (c) Jurisdiction.——There is federal jurisdiction\n     over an offense described in this section if——\n          ...\n               (6) the public servant is an agent of a\n          State or local government charged by a federal\n\n     127\n       “Arguably [ ] Congress did not intend the involvement of\nfederal funds in a corrupt transaction to be a factual certainty.”\nWestmoreland, 841 F.2d at 577 (interpreting Del Toro).\n     128\n       S.

Yet the\n\n1983 bill and 1984 enactment contained none of that language or\n\nanything similar.130   The reason for that absence is unclear.   In\n\n1981, when the Committee clearly sought to require a federal nexus,\n\nit had sufficient command of the English language to do so.      To\n\nsuppose that the Committee lost that faculty over either two or\n\nfour years is ludicrous.     Section 666 as enacted and amended,\n\ntherefore, might have reflected a change in the Senate Judiciary\n\nCommittee’s view on whether to require a federal nexus, but we\n\n\n     129\n       S. 1630, 97th Cong. § 101 (1981) (recodifying all of Title\n18). This jurisdictional language in the proposed bribery section\nwould have been the new 18 U.S.C. § 1351(c)(6). See S. 1630, 97th\nCong. § 101, at 76–77 (codifying program bribery offense).\n     The commercial bribery section in the 1981 bill contained a\nsimilar   nexus   requirement  for   the  existence  of   federal\njurisdiction.    See S. 1630, 97th Cong. § 101, at 134 (1981)\n(proposing a new 18 U.S.C. § 1751(c)(1)(I)).\n     130\n       Any attempt to rely on the legislative history of the 1981\nbill is therefore misguided. Unfortunately, a panel of this court\nhas done so, quoting the 1981 report as if it were the 1983 report\nthat shed light on the enacted text.

During the\n      relevant periods, substantial federal funds were received\n      by Waterbury for housing, urban development, and other\n      programs within the purview of these agencies and\n      officials.     Since federal funds were received by\n      Waterbury for housing and urban development programs and\n      the corrupt payments concerned real estate transactions\n      within the purview of the agencies administering federal\n      funds, the requisite connection between the bribes and\n      the integrity of federally funded programs is satisfied.\n      Thus, this is not a case where the transactions sought to\n\n      143\n            Id. at 93.\n      144\n            Id.\n      145\n            Id. at 91.\n\n                                         54\n\f     be influenced concerned one department of a city and the\n     requisite $10,000 of federal funds were received by a\n     totally unrelated department.146\n\nSantopietro thus stands indisputably for a purview test: To be\n\nprosecuted under § 666, a bribed official must at least influence\n\nother officials who have within their purview federally funded\n\nprograms, but the corruption need not touch those programs.                In\n\nother words, Santopietro asks whether a defendant could have\n\ninfluenced   the   use   of   federal   funds    by   controlling   the   same\n\nagencies or staffers whom he actually corruptly influenced with\n\nrespect to purely local matters.\n\n     Such a purview test, applied to the case at bar, supports\n\nconvicting Lipscomb, who took bribes in return for influencing\n\nmatters within the purviews of two Dallas departments, human\n\nservices and transportation, which both received federal funds.\n\nThe connection between federal funds and corrupt conduct is closer\n\nhere than in Santopietro, where the court did not explain how the\n\n“City Plan Commission, the Zoning Commission, the Water Department,\n\nand the Fire Marshal” administered federal funds, but rather\n\nsuggested that these agencies and officials made decisions ——\n\npresumably determining whether proposed developments complied with\n\nzoning, fire, and other codes147 —— with respect to housing and\n\n     146\n       Id. at 93–94 (emphasis           added;    citations   and   internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n     147\n       See United States v.

Lipscomb focuses on the fact that $56\n\nmillion was only 3.5% of Dallas’s city budget in that year.                 In\n\npart, this is a dispute over the meaning of one passage in Zwick:\n\n     We can conceive of several ways in which the government\n     could prove a federal interest in a § 666 [case].... The\n     amount of federal funds could provide the requisite\n     federal implication, even if the purpose of those funds\n     has no explicit relationship to the subject of the bribe.\n     If, for example, in a given year, the greater part of a\n\n\n     involving the city, even though the federal funds were\n     received for a program entirely unrelated to the program\n     in connection with which the corrupt payments were made.\n     151\n           See TRIBE, supra note 65, § 5–3, at 798–802, 805.\n\n                                          57\n\f      township’s budget came from federal funds, bribery of a\n      township agent for any purpose might be said to implicate\n      federal interests.152\n\nIn   the     abstract,    this    “greater    part”   yardstick    may    have    an\n\nappealing ring, but it is utterly divorced from reality.                          In\n\nactuality, no state government and, I suspect, only a rare county\n\nor city government (not even the District of Columbia), is so\n\nwholly a creature of the United States as to rely on Washington for\n\n“the greater part” of its revenue.153           In the rare case that federal\n\nfunding       is   a   majority    of   total   revenue,    federal      power    to\n\ncriminalize local corruption would undoubtedly exist; but surely\n\nthe absolute level of federal grants, as well as their relative\n\nimportance to the city’s budget, would provide a federal interest,\n\nto the protection of which § 666 is necessary and proper.\n\n      To determine whether this is so —— to judge if § 666 is indeed\n\nreasonably related to the federal interest in safeguarding $56\n\nmillion —— I would analogize the federal government and Dallas to\n\npartners in spending federal dollars to advance shared goals.                     In\n\nthe private sector, what would a reasonable funding partner who has\n\nadvanced $56 million do after learning that its service partner\n\ntakes       kickbacks,    albeit    regarding     matters    not    within       the\n\n      152\n            Zwick, 199 F.3d at 687.\n      153\n        See U.S. BUREAU OF THE CENSUS, U.S. DEP’T OF COMMERCE, STATISTICAL\nABSTRACT OF THE UNITED STATES: 2001, tables 435, 437, 439, 445, 447\n(121st ed. 2001) (showing total revenue and federal revenue of the\nstates and the largest cities and counties by population). None of\nthe states, and none of the cities and counties listed, relies on\nthe federal government for a majority of its revenue.\n\n                                         58\n\fpartnership’s scope?      The funding partner might well dissolve the\n\npartnership rather than wait for the service partner’s corruption\n\nto widen and infect partnership dealings.\n\n      The partnership analogy does not bear close inspection, but\n\nits failure, instead of undermining the constitutionality of § 666,\n\nactually supports it.     The analogy founders on the fact that in the\n\npublic sector, states, counties, and municipalities hold monopolies\n\non delivering many governmental services to their citizens.          Thus,\n\nwhen Congress seeks to benefit the citizenry of a particular state\n\nand locality, it can turn to very few potential public partners.\n\nThis scarcity suggests that if the federal-Dallas partnership were\n\ndissolved when corruption among Dallas officials is discovered ——\n\nor if the federal government were to withhold funds in such a case\n\n—— the purpose of the federally funded programs would be defeated,\n\nand Congress would be prevented from using the spending power to\n\npromote the welfare of citizens of Dallas. The populace of Dallas,\n\nhowever, is by definition innocent of official corruption, and\n\nshould not suffer a cut in federally funded services on account of\n\nit.   The prospective specter of criminal sanctions against corrupt\n\nofficials   themselves,    rather   than   post-hoc,   fiscally   punitive\n\nmeasures against Dallas, is therefore a logical and appropriate\n\nsolution for local corruption that threatens —— even indirectly, as\n\nhere —— $56 million in federal funds.\n\n      The Council votes to apply for federal funds, to accept\n\nfederal funds, and to approve all large contracts, including those\n\n                                    59\n\finvolving federal funds.        Congress could rationally believe that\n\nthe integrity of $56 million of federal funds applied for by the\n\nCouncil —— particularly when the federal treasury is funding not\n\njust one or two projects but many —— suffices as a federal interest\n\nweighty     enough   to   justify   federal   criminal   jurisdiction   over\n\nCouncil members who are bribed with respect to local issues.\n\n     2.       The Integrity of State and Local Officials\n              with Authority over Federal Funds\n\n     A second federal interest at stake here is the integrity vel\n\nnon of federal programs and funds, regardless of the quantum or\n\nbudget percentage of funds at issue.             A corrupt state or city\n\nofficial who has real responsibility for, or often participates in,\n\nthe allocation of federal funds is a “threat to the integrity”154 of\n\nthose funds, even if they are not actually or directly infected by\n\nhis corruption.      Congress may legitimately view as necessary and\n\nproper the imposition of federal criminal liability for bribery, so\n\nas to ensure the honesty of state and local officials who have\n\nfederal funds in their purview or federal programs under their\n\nauthority.\n\n     Judge Smith advances two explicit arguments against such\n\nliability (neither of which, with respect, I find persuasive) and\n\none implicit argument that is defeated by the text of the statute\n\nand the facts of this case.            The implicit contention is that\n\nbribery of Lipscomb alone, apart from any of his fourteen council\n\n     154\n           Salinas, 522 U.S. at 61.\n\n                                      60\n\fcolleagues, cannot create a sufficient federal interest or nexus,\n\nbecause Lipscomb cannot act for the Council.   This argument might\n\nalso be grounded in the fact that, alone, one legislator does not\n\nadminister program funds.    The text of § 666 disposes of this\n\nargument, as a statutory matter, because Congress clearly sought to\n\napply § 666 to legislative-branch officials.155 As a constitutional\n\nmatter, there is little or no basis for holding that federal\n\njurisdiction over bribery of Council members depends on whether the\n\nbriber can command a majority.    One Council member’s vote, after\n\nall, can tip the balance on a close question; and, as Lipscomb’s\n\nconduct here demonstrates, a member has a number of arrows in his\n\nparliamentary quiver besides the final vote.\n\n     Judge Smith also speculates that the State of Texas would have\n\nprosecuted Lipscomb had it known of the evidence against him.   This\n\nis not a constitutional argument; it merely begs the constitutional\n\nquestion regarding the limits of the spending power.156    And, as\n\n     155\n       Lipscomb is an “agent” under the statute because he is an\n“officer” of Dallas. 18 U.S.C. § 666(d)(1) (2000). Even if he\nwere merely an agent of a “subdivision of the [ ] legislative...\nbranch of government,” the statute’s text would still cover him.\n18 U.S.C. § 666(d)(2) (2000).\n     156\n       See United States v.

[T]he Tenth\n     Amendment does not prohibit the federal government from\n     enforcing its laws, even when there are state laws\n     addressing the same criminal act.\n          . . .\n          Although South Carolina could have brought state\n     criminal charges against Bailey based upon the same\n     facts, this does not prevent the United States from\n\n                                 61\n\feither a positive or a normative statement —— that the federal\n\ngovernment either does or should leave such prosecutions to the\n\nstates —— it fails.       There are at least three reasons why federal\n\nrather than state bribery prosecutions might be necessary and\n\nproper in cases like Lipscomb’s.             First, the federal government\n\nmight have a greater incentive to prosecute than does the state\n\ngovernment,      either   because   the      offense    conduct      directly   or\n\npotentially affects federal funds or because the federal government\n\nprovides      more   money   to   the    locality      than   does    the   state\n\ngovernment.157       The latter proposition is true in this case: In\n\nterms of dollars provided to Dallas, the federal government has a\n\nstake in the city’s fiscal integrity that is between fifteen and\n\ntwenty times greater than the state’s stake.158\n\n     Second, federal officials might be less corruptible than state\n\n\n     enforcing its criminal statutes.\n     157\n       Both reasons were part of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s\nthinking in recommending that the Senate enact § 666. See S. REP.\nNO. 98-225 at 369, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3510:\n     In many cases, such prosecution is impossible because\n     title has passed to the recipient before the property is\n     stolen, or the funds are so commingled that the Federal\n     character of the funds cannot be shown. This situation\n     gives rise to a serious gap in the law, since even though\n     title to the monies may have passed, the Federal\n     Government clearly retains a strong interest in assuring\n     the integrity of such program funds. Indeed, a recurring\n     problem in this area (as well as in the related area of\n     bribery of the administrators of such funds) has been\n     that State and local prosecutors are often unwilling to\n     commit their limited resources to pursue such thefts,\n     deeming the United States the principal party aggrieved.\n     158\n           See Part I.B., supra (discussing jurisdictional facts).\n\n                                        62\n\fand local officials,159 and an informant with evidence of misconduct\n\nby a state or local official might feel safer in taking his\n\ninformation to federal authorities; indeed, he could even prefer\n\nthat it not be shared with state or local authorities.                  Third,\n\nfederal prosecutors are less likely to be linked to state and local\n\npoliticians and are generally more independent of local political\n\nforces that might try to protect high officials from aggressive\n\nstate enforcement.\n\n     Judge        Smith’s    second   contention    against    high-official\n\nliability is a law-and-economics argument that, in my opinion, does\n\nnot hold water and affords courts little basis, if any, on which to\n\npronounce     a    statute    unconstitutional,    whether   facially   or   as\n\napplied. As I understand his argument, it is that if courts permit\n\nthe United States as well as states to prosecute high local\n\nofficials for bribery involving local funds and programs, corrupt\n\nofficials will change their behavior and, on the margin, take more\n\nbribes directly related to federal funds and programs than they\n\notherwise would.160         With respect, I perceive at least three flaws\n\n     159\n       See RICHARD A. POSNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE LAW 698 (5th ed.\n1998) (emphasis added):\n     Some federal criminal jurisdiction can be explained by\n     reference to the point...that monopolies of political\n     power are more easily achieved at the state than at the\n     federal level. Federal criminal prosecutions of corrupt\n     local   government    officials     exploit    the    relative\n     incorruptibility of federal officials —— stemming from\n     the greater costs of corrupting a federal agency... —— in\n     order to reduce corruption at the local level.\n     160\n           See infra at ___.\n\n                                       63\n\fof logic in this argument.\n\n       First, social science has not yet proven that the rational-\n\nactor model adequately explains the real-world behavior of white-\n\ncollar       criminals:     As     behavioral     law    and   economics      warns     us,\n\ninadequate        information,       biases,     and    heuristics        often    prevent\n\nindividuals from acting rationally.                    For example, unless a local\n\nofficial        is   well   integrated      into    a     culture    of    white-collar\n\ncriminality (which would itself suggest that federal prosecution\n\nmay    be     necessary),     he    will   lack    even    anecdotal       data    on   the\n\nprobability that either the state or the federal government will\n\ndetect and prosecute bribery. (Anecdotal data would, of course, be\n\nthe only data available.)                  Therefore, an official considering\n\nwhether to take a bribe would not be likely to calculate the odds\n\nof detection or prosecution in the dispassionately mathematical way\n\nthat the rational-actor model might suggest.\n\n       Furthermore,         standard    law-and-economics           analysis      actually\n\njustifies federal criminal jurisdiction on the basis of interstate\n\nexternalities, an argument eminently applicable here.161 If bribery\n\nin    Dallas     threatens       federally-provided        funds,     that   corruption\n\nthreatens the federal Treasury, which is funded by taxes collected\n\nnot just from Texas but from all across the Nation.\n\n       Lastly and most importantly, even if Judge Smith’s law-and-\n\neconomics objection to federal jurisdiction here were an accurate\n\n\n       161\n             See POSNER, supra note 120, at 697.\n\n                                            64\n\fpredictor, it has little force. The most that his prediction might\n\nprove is that Congress has deluded itself into passing a law that\n\nmay be self-defeating, because it increases the vulnerability of\n\nfederal funds to corruption and thus disregards economic facts.\n\n“But a law can be both economic folly and constitutional.”162                  A\n\nmeans-ends tradeoff, weighing costs against benefits, is precisely\n\nthe sort    of   political    judgment     that    members    of   Congress   are\n\nentitled —— and better equipped than judges —— to make, and that\n\ncourts should generally defer to.          As judges, we do not experience\n\nthe perils attendant on taxing one’s own constituents, do not enjoy\n\nthe political significance of bringing home the fiscal bacon, and\n\ndo not share the frustration of seeing hard-won federal dollars\n\nbleed off through the hands of corrupt local officials.                 Lacking\n\nthe power to tax and spend, federal judges should defer to a\n\nplausible   risk-reward      construct     that    Congress   has   enacted   to\n\nprotect the federal fisc.\n\nE.   Constitutional Limits to § 666?\n\n     Lipscomb    strongly    argues   that    if    §   666   constitutionally\n\ncriminalizes conduct like his by state and local agents, then there\n\nare no limits to its sweep, and federal criminal law extends to\n\nbriberies totally removed from federal funds.             As I have analyzed\n\nLipscomb’s constitutional challenge to the statute as it applies to\n\nhim, I need not determine here whether there is a constitutional\n\n     162\n       CTS Corp. v.

A brief comment is nonetheless in order.\n\n     As a statutory matter, even Westmoreland —— our broadest (and\n\ncontrolling) reading of § 666 —— did not address whether § 666 can\n\nreach      the   lowest   levels   of   state   and   local   bureaucracies.\n\nWestmoreland did, however, advert to the limits in the statute’s\n\ntext:\n\n     [T]he statute does not encompass every local bribery as\n     Westmoreland suggests.     Although the extent of the\n     federal government’s assistance programs will bring many\n     organizations and agencies within the statute’s scope,\n     the statute limits its reach to entities that receive a\n     substantial amount of federal funds and to agents who\n     have the authority to effect significant transactions.163\n\n     As a constitutional matter, under the Necessary and Proper\n\nClause, the test is whether prosecution would be rationally related\n\nto a federal interest —— that is, to effecting Congress’s spending\n\npower.      In this case, two already-noted federal interests justify\n\napplying § 666 to Lipscomb’s conduct: (1) the total amount of\n\nfederal funds extended to Dallas and (2) Lipscomb’s purview —— his\n\nhigh rank and his broad influence over many programs that receive\n\nfederal funds.       Of these two interests, his purview would easily\n\naccommodate, in another case, the Second Circuit’s hypothetical\n\nimplication in Santopietro that it could not be necessary and\n\nproper to the spending power for federal criminal liability to\n\nextend to a corrupt city meat inspector when the city receives\n\n\n\n\n     163\n           Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 578.\n\n                                        66\n\ffederal funds only for its parks.164    That case is not before us\n\ntoday, however, so I need not predict, in double dicta, whether\n\nthere might be categories of prosecutions under § 666 that are not\n\nnecessary and proper to the spending power.     For today’s purposes\n\nit is sufficient to note that if there are such categories,\n\nLipscomb is far removed from them.\n\nF.   Conclusion\n\n     The constitutional argument in this case boils down to how\n\ndirect must local corruption’s threat to federal funds be for § 666\n\nto apply.   Lipscomb insists that, although federal funds need not\n\nbe directly involved in the offense conduct, the state or local\n\nofficial’s conduct still must threaten the integrity of federal\n\nfunds more directly than did his.    Not so.   The foregoing analysis\n\nhas shown that (1) the text of § 666 reads otherwise; (2) the\n\nlegislative history does not clearly contradict it (as it must to\n\noverride a clear criminal statute165); and (3) our controlling\n\nprecedents on point reject such a limit.

Congress\n\ncould have believed, quite legitimately, that preventing federal\n\nfunds from passing through state and local legislative bodies whose\n\nmembers   are   corrupt,   and    to    do   so   with   the   deterrent   of\n\ncriminalizing the legislators’ corruption, even with respect to\n\npurely state or local issues, was necessary and proper to the\n\nfederal spending power.    As courts can require of Congress nothing\n\nmore than such a rational relationship to the spending power, § 666\n\nis constitutional as applied here.\n\n                                 VII. VENUE\n\n     Having established that the federal courts have jurisdiction\n\nof this case, we turn to Lipscomb’s assignments of reversible error\n\nby the district court.     Chief among these is his contention that\n\nthe court abused its discretion in transferring the trial from\n\nDallas to Amarillo sua sponte, shortly before trial, and over\n\nLipscomb’s objection.\n\nA.   The Transfer Order\n\n     The district court read its unexpected transfer order into the\n\nrecord at the end of a hearing on December 20, 1999.              The order\n\nreads, nearly in its entirety:\n\n     As everyone knows this case will involve the trial of one\n     of the best[-]known sitting elected officials in the\n     Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex for allegations of public\n     corruption. This Court cannot recall such a trial of a\n     sitting elected official in Dallas for allegations of\n\n                                       68\n\fpublic corruption.     This case has already received\nsignificant media attention and undoubtedly will receive\nmore.\n      The Court notes that both sides have requested or\nnot opposed requests for individual voir dire examination\nof the prospective jury panel and both sides have\nrequested use of a jury questionnaire. Both motions,\nunusual and rare motions in federal criminal cases in\nDallas, are made precisely because of the high profile of\nDefendant Lipscomb, a Dallas City Councilman of twelve\nyears[’] experience and one of the most influential and\nwell[-]known political leaders in the Dallas African[-\n]American community for the last three decades.\nCouncilman Lipscomb has been an effective representative\nof his constituency and locally has strong supporters and\ndetractors. These facts will obviously make selection of\na jury of twelve with no preconceived opinions about Al\nLipscomb no easy task.\n      As stated this case has thus far generated\nsubstantial publicity in the local media and will\ngenerate more throughout the trial. Such coverage has\nresulted in the Court reading in the newspapers certain\ninformation that has been filed under seal. The Court is\nalso concerned about the ability to select a fair and\nimpartial jury.\n      In considering the various motions regarding jury\nselection that both sides have filed[,] the Court is not\nconvinced that such measures would be sufficient to\nassure Councilman Lipscomb, the other defendants, and the\nGovernment a fair trial.     It is this Court’s fervent\ndesire and absolute obligation to see to it that a fair\ntrial is conducted —— fair to both the defendants and the\nGovernment.

Indeed, this Court disposed\n\n                           69\n\f     of all criminal cases filed in the Wichita Falls Division\n     of the Northern District of Texas (about 100 cases) over\n     a 4 ½ year period (1994 to 1999) in the Dallas Division\n     of the Northern District of Texas. The law is clear that\n     in the Court’s sound discretion, after considering the\n     statutory elements, which this Court has done, this case\n     may be tried anywhere within the Northern District of\n     Texas.\n          Amarillo is a good[-]size[d] city[,] serviced by\n     several airlines and is only a five[-]hour drive from\n     Dallas. No defendant is indigent and all have retained,\n     as opposed to appointed, council [sic]. The Court has\n     made a careful analysis and given due consideration of\n     the convenience of the witnesses and the parties, and\n     considered the prompt administration of justice. These\n     considerations, coupled with the concerns for selection\n     of an impartial jury as expressed by the parties in their\n     pretrial motions, as well as all the concerns the Court\n     has expressed above, causes [sic] the Court to find that\n     the prompt administration of justice would best be\n     effectuated by having the trial of this case in the\n     Amarillo Division of the Northern District of Texas.\n          ...\n          The Court is absolutely convinced that the prompt\n     administration of justice will best be served by\n     conducting this trial in Amarillo, where it is unlikely\n     [sic] that few, if any on the jury panel will have ever\n     heard of Al Lipscomb or Floyd Richards, and fewer still,\n     if any[,] will have any preconceived ideas or opinions\n     about them. This will help assure that the jury verdict\n     is based on the merits of the evidence presented in the\n     courtroom, and nothing else.\n\nBefore the issuance of this order, no party had presented evidence\n\nregarding prejudice from pretrial publicity or regarding any other\n\nissue relative to venue.   On hearing the order read, lawyers for\n\nLipscomb and his co-defendant, Richards, objected.   Lipscomb filed\n\nwritten objections nine days later —— objections on which the court\n\ndid not rule before the trial began, as long scheduled, on January\n\n11, 2000, in Amarillo, some three hundred miles from Dallas.\n\n     In a motion for a new trial following his conviction, Lipscomb\n\n\n                                70\n\frenewed his objections to the venue transfer, which motion the\n\ndistrict court later denied.              Also after trial, the government\n\nfiled thirty-seven newspaper articles about Lipscomb’s case that\n\nhad appeared from March through December 19, 1999, as well as other\n\narticles that appeared after the transfer order —— none of which\n\nhad been in the record when the transfer order issued and none of\n\nwhich were so much as mentioned by the district court.\n\nB.

Analysis\n\n     We      must   begin    our   analysis   by   recognizing an important\n\ndistinction between intradistrict and interdistrict transfers: Only\n\nan interdistrict transfer implicates the Constitution.174            There is\n\nno basis for inferring the existence of a constitutional right to\n\ntrial within the division where a criminal defendant lives or where\n\na crime was committed.175           In one intradistrict transfer case,\n\nhowever, we interpreted the Sixth Amendment to mean that “it is the\n\npublic policy of this Country that one must not arbitrarily be\n\nsent, without his consent, into a strange locality to defend\n\nhimself      against   the   powerful   prosecutorial    resources    of   the\n\nGovernment.”176\n\n     The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure also distinguish\n\nbetween interdistrict and intradistrict transfers. Rule 21 governs\n\ntransfers to another district and provides that this may be done\n\n\n\n\n     174\n           See U.S. CONST. art. 3, § 2, cl. 3; U.S. CONST. amend.

Convenience\n\n     Rule 18’s “due regard to the convenience of the defendant and\n\nthe witnesses” militates strongly against transfer in this case.\n\nThe record shows that the defendant and all witnesses resided in\n\nDallas.      In addition, every defense attorney practiced there, and\n\nthe judge was based in Dallas.             Not a single relevant event\n\noccurred outside Dallas.180 As “convenience of the prosecution...is\n\nnot a factor to consider in changing venue,”181 the convenience\n\nfacts rarely cut as totally against transfer as they did here.\n\n     The district court did not mention these contra-transfer facts\n\nin its order.     It merely noted that Amarillo was served by several\n\nairlines, that it was a five hours’ drive from Dallas, and ——\n\nperhaps inaccurately and irrelevantly —— that the defendants were\n\nrepresented by “retained” counsel.182       These facts, of course, did\n\n     180\n       This case is thus readily distinguishable from United States\nv. Gourley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761793\"><a href=\"/opinion/761793/united-states-v-randall-elwood-gourley/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1999), where we found no abuse\nof discretion when the Southern District of Texas transferred a\ntrial from the Houston division to the Laredo division. Some of\nthe defendant’s witnesses were in Houston, id. at 171, suggesting\nthat convenience in that case may have cut in favor of Houston; but\nan element of the offense conduct —— conspiracy to import cocaine\n—— took place “at the border near Laredo,” and the crime in\nprogress was detected in both Laredo and Houston. Id. at 167.\n     181\n           Dickie, 775 F.2d at 610.\n     182\n       Although Lipscomb was not represented by court-appointed\nlawyers, the trial court’s use of “retained” connotes that Lipscomb\nwas paying his lawyers’ fees. The record clearly shows, however,\nthat Lipscomb faced large legal bills, lacked the means of his own\n\n                                      75\n\fnot   diminish   the   basic   truth    that   trial   in     Amarillo   was\n\ninconvenient for Lipscomb, his counsel, and all witnesses.               This\n\ncase is, therefore, easily distinguishable from the two cases on\n\nwhich the district court relied, because convenience did not\n\nmilitate against transfer in either of them.183        Those cases do not\n\nsupport the court’s sua sponte transfer here, and the trial court\n\nerred as a matter of law in relying on them.\n\n      2.    Court Policy\n\n      The trial court also referred to its prior transfers of “about\n\n100 [criminal] cases” from Wichita Falls to Dallas (less than half\n\nthe distance, we note, as Dallas to Amarillo).              This historical\n\nfact, however, does not support the transfer at issue.           Nothing in\n\nthe record shows why those transfers took place. Such reference to\n\nthe court’s prior venue practice verges on circularity and runs the\n\nrisk of creating a per se rule that violates Rule 18’s focus on the\n\n\n\n\nto pay them (partly because Dallas city council members are not\npaid a salary), and resorted to fundraising.     One article also\nstated that Lipscomb’s lead defense lawyer had placed himself last\nin line for whatever money Lipscomb might manage to raise.\n      183\n       See James, 528 F.2d at 1003, 1021–22 (showing that\nconvenience did not militate against transfer because six of the\nseven defendants did not even live in state, much less in the\ntransferring division, and four of the witnesses were in jail). In\nthe other case relied on by the district court, the defendants\nnever objected to the place of trial, which was only forty miles\nfurther from the place of the crime than the alternative\ncourthouse; inconvenience, if any, was slight.

Speedy Trial\n\n     The rule’s second textual factor —— “due regard to...the\n\nprompt administration of justice” —— is in part a literal command\n\nthat trials comply with the Speedy Trial Act.185                  This factor,\n\nhowever, did not support trial transfer in this case, as a review\n\nof the record shows.         Lipscomb was indicted on March 4, 1999, and\n\nhe appeared in court the next day.          Trial was initially set for May\n\n17, but Lipscomb moved for continuance.               The court refused to\n\ncontinue the trial date indefinitely, instead setting a hearing for\n\nMay at which counsel had to submit their schedules for the coming\n\n     184\n       See United States v.

Counsel for Lipscomb had court engagements scheduled in\n\neach month from August through November of 1999, so at the hearing,\n\nall parties agreed on January 10, 2000, as the trial date.186\n\nLater, in November, the trial court extended the trial date one\n\nday, to January 11.        Early in December, 1999, Lipscomb filed\n\nanother motion to continue the trial, which motion the district\n\ncourt promptly denied.     When, on December 20, the district court\n\nunexpectedly ordered the transfer, the parties already knew that\n\n(1) trial was firmly set for January 11 and (2) there was no reason\n\nto expect that voir dire would not begin on that day.     Nothing in\n\nthe record suggests that facilities appropriate for the trial were\n\nunavailable in Dallas at that time.      There were thus no speedy-\n\ntrial issues in this case.\n\n     The district court did characterize the possibility of a\n\ndifficult voir dire as an obstacle to “prompt administration.”    We\n\ndo not understand the term “prompt administration” to have been\n\npromulgated in the Rules with the intention of permitting courts to\n\navoid even attempting arduous voir dire proceedings.     Rather, the\n\ntriggering purpose of the “prompt administration” amendment to Rule\n\n18 was to clarify that district courts are authorized to fix the\n\nplace of trial so as to comply with the Speedy Trial Act.187    That\n\n\n     186\n       The scheduling order determined, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3161(h)(8)(A) and (B)(iv), that the ends of justice would be best\nserved by the new trial date.\n     187\n           See note 137.\n\n                                  78\n\fAct concerns itself solely with the timeliness of when trial\n\nbegins, not with when either voir dire or the entire trial will\n\nconclude,188 and in this circuit, trial is deemed to begin with voir\n\ndire.189    Because the transfer to Amarillo did not change, much less\n\nhasten, the already-scheduled start of the trial, the transfer did\n\nnot accomplish the “prompt administration” of this case in the\n\ntextual, speedy-trial sense.\n\n     Nevertheless,     we   have   held    that   a   trial   court,   in   its\n\ndiscretion, may fix the place of trial with regard to factors other\n\nthan convenience and prompt administration: such factors commonly\n\ninclude, but are not necessarily limited to, docket management,\n\ncourthouse space and security, and —— most importantly for this\n\ncase —— pretrial publicity.\n\n     4.       Docket Management\n\n     In the context of docket management, we have construed the\n\nterm “prompt administration of justice” to refer not just to the\n\nparticular case that may be transferred, but also to other trials\n\non the court’s docket.190         A district court may consider docket\n\nmanagement in its Rule 18 balancing, and docket issues may even\n\n\n\n\n     188\n           See 18 U.S.C. § 3161.\n     189\n           United States v.

Logistics\n\n     Another factor that a court may consider in fixing the place\n\nof trial within its district is whether a particular courthouse\n\nmeets      a   particular    trial’s    security   requirements   or   other\n\nfacilities needs.          Courtroom availability, unsurprisingly, is a\n\npermissible consideration.192          So too are the amount of jail space\n\navailable there for defendants or witnesses193 and the adequacy of\n\nsecurity arrangements in a particular criminal trial.194           Even so,\n\n\n     191\n       Thus, when the Western District of Louisiana was at two-\nthirds its authorized strength, and the trial judge not only\nresided in Monroe, Louisiana, but also had other civil and criminal\nmatters on his docket there, he did not abuse his discretion by\ntransferring an anticipated three-week trial there from Lake\nCharles, Louisiana, 150 miles away, over the defendants’ objections\nthat they, their witnesses, and their counsel lived and worked in\nthe Lake Charles area. Chesson, 897 F.2d at 157–59. In another\ncase, even though the offense was committed in Greenville,\nMississippi, and all the witnesses, counsel, and defendants were\nlocated there, the district court did not abuse its discretion by\nfixing the place of trial at Oxford, Mississippi, where the\ndistrict court had other cases scheduled.

The court’s\n\nlack    of      record   documentation    or   analysis   on   this   point   is\n\nparticularly troubling in light of our acknowledgment that “[e]very\n\nclaim of potential jury prejudice due to publicity must turn upon\n\nits own facts.”199\n\n       Despite the trial court’s statement to the contrary, it was\n\nnot that court’s duty, in ensuring a fair trial, to select “a jury\n\n\n\n       196\n       Although the court did state that the media had reported\nmaterial filed under seal, the only sealed material in the record\non appeal is Lipscomb’s pre-sentencing report.

Essentially,     he   proposes   that\n\npublicity prejudicial to him may justify transfer, but publicity\n\nprejudicial to the government cannot.           To support this contention,\n\nhe points to the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 18, which state:\n\n     If the court is satisfied that there exists in the place\n     fixed for trial prejudice against the defendant so great\n     as to render the trial unfair, the court may, of course,\n     fix another place of trial within the district (if there\n     be such) where such prejudice does not exist. Cf. Rule\n     21 dealing with transfers between districts.206\n\nRule 21 —— which some courts find illuminative of Rule 18207 ——\n\nrequires an interdistrict transfer for prejudice if the defendant\n\nrequests it and the court determines that “there exists in the\n\ndistrict where the prosecution is pending so great a prejudice\n\nagainst the defendant that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and\n\nimpartial trial at any place fixed by law for holding court in that\n\ndistrict.”208\n\n     We cannot entirely accept Lipscomb’s suggested distinction,\n\nbecause we have in fact upheld a sua sponte intradistrict transfer\n\n—— to a division unrelated to the offense conduct, as here, and\n\n     206\n       FED.

Yet, as Lipscomb\n\ncorrectly notes, whenever we have upheld a sua sponte transfer over\n\nthe defendant’s objection (whether the prejudice from publicity was\n\nto the government or to the defendant), a mistrial had already\n\ndemonstrated     that    the   venire   pool   had   been   badly   tainted   by\n\npublicity and that retrial within the transferring division would\n\npose virtually insuperable difficulties.\n\n     Our most recent ruling to this effect, in United States v.\n\nGonzalez,209 exemplifies this pattern: The defendant’s first trial\n\nwas interrupted by two bomb threats and ended in a hung jury, and\n\nhis second trial ended in a mistrial after three jurors reported\n\nthat they received anonymous phone calls urging them to convict.210\n\n“[C]onsiderable publicity...from the first two trials” resulted.211\n\nUnder such easily distinguishable circumstances, the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in ordering an intradistrict transfer\n\nsua sponte.212      To the same effect are our decisions in United\n\nStates v.

These facts\n\nalso completely distinguish Alvarado from this case: The Alvarado\n\n\n     223\n           Id. at n.4.\n     224\n       See proceedings in United States v. Martinez, No. Cr.

Tex., Brownsville Div.), particularly the docket sheet\nentries for 8/17/79 (motion regarding newspaper reporter made and\nrejected); 8/24/79 and 8/27/79 (motions to transfer made).\nMartinez was the caption of Alvarado in the district court until\nthe transfer of proceedings against fourteen defendants, at which\npoint the case became United States v. Alvarado, No. Cr. V-79-4\n(S.D. Tex., Victoria Div.) —— the case appealed to us.\n     225\n           Martinez, docket sheet at entry for 8/28/79.\n     226\n       Id. at entry for 8/30/79.

Rather than undermine\n\nour conclusion here, the Alvarado facts confirm our impression that\n\nthe transfer in the instant case was quite unusual.    Any court that\n\nviews Alvarado as trumping today’s holding under our rule of\n\norderliness will have been led into serious error.228\n\n     We have found only one case (from another circuit) that comes\n\nclose to supporting the proposition for which the government\n\ncontends, but that case ultimately is unpersuasive.        In United\n\nStates v. Mabry,229 a defendant moved for individual voir dire\n\nregarding pretrial publicity.230     The trial court interpreted this\n\nmotion as raising a concern about whether trial in the Albuquerque\n\ndivision of the district of New Mexico would be fair —— seemingly\n\n     228\n       The dissent’s reliance on two other cases is similarly\nmisplaced.

The reasoning of the\nother Fifth Circuit case that the dissent relies on is also easily\nunderstood:\n     [T]the Southern District of Texas was the only district\n     in which (at least absent further evidence) venue was\n     initially proper as to all counts. While this does not\n     prevent a Rule 21(b) transfer of all counts to another\n     district, it is at least an indication that the\n     government's selection of the forum was not arbitrary.\n     We conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n     discretion in denying Fagan's Rule 21(b) motion.\nUnited States v.

First, the   Mabry district court did not appear to transfer\n\nthe case out of concern that the government receive a fair trial.\n\nTo this extent, Mabry actually supports Lipscomb’s contention on\n\nthat point.      Second, the cases on which the Tenth Circuit relied\n\nbuttress Mabry’s result only weakly, if at all.233              Third, Mabry’s\n\ntransfer holding has been largely ignored by other courts, perhaps\n\nbecause the Supreme Court later abrogated Mabry’s entrapment-\n\ninstruction holding.234      Mabry is thus hardly persuasive authority\n\n\n     231\n           Id.\n     232\n           Id.\n     233\n       See United States v.

In this instance, we as an appellate court\n\ncan detect virtually nothing on the Rule 18 scale to counterbalance\n\nthe defendant’s established inconvenience; and something outweighs\n\nnothing every time.\n\n      Given the district court’s abuse of discretion, we must\n\nreverse Lipscomb’s conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for\n\na new trial in a venue determined consistently with this opinion.\n\n                           VIII. CONCLUSION\n\n      The trial court had jurisdiction to try Lipscomb for violating\n\n18 U.S.C. § 666, which is facially constitutional and —— in my own\n\nsole opinion —— is constitutional as applied to him.                As we\n\nconclude that the trial court abused its discretion in transferring\n\nLipscomb’s trial, however, we must reverse and remand for a new\n\ntrial. The other issues Lipscomb raises on appeal are either moot,\n\nmeritless, or irrelevant to a new trial.\n\nCONVICTION REVERSED, SENTENCE VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED for a new\n\ntrial.\n\n                                      93\n\f94\n\fDUHÉ, Circuit Judge, CONCURRING IN PART, DISSENTING IN PART:\n\n      I   write    separately        because,         although       I       concur       in   the\n\nconclusion reached by Judge Wiener that we must reverse Lipscomb’s\n\nconviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for a new trial, I\n\ncannot join his method of getting there. I adopt Judge Wiener’s\n\nfactual and procedural background sections; concur in the result\n\nbut not the reasoning of Part III; dissent from Parts IV, V, and\n\nVI; and concur in Part VII. I begin with an overview of the\n\nappropriate analytical framework.\n\n                              I. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\n      Judge Wiener’s opinion merges analysis of jurisdiction with\n\nanalysis of the constitutionality of § 666. In Part IV of his\n\nopinion, Judge Wiener writes that the term “federal jurisdiction”\n\nis   ambiguous,    and    defines         it    for    purposes       of      this    case      as\n\nencompassing (a) the question whether we have subject matter\n\njurisdiction under § 666 over Lipscomb’s conduct (which Judge\n\nWiener calls “adjudicative jurisdiction”), and (b) the question\n\nwhether Congress had the authority to enact § 666 (which Judge\n\nWiener     terms     “legislative               jurisdiction”,               and     we        term\n\nconstitutionality).       In       this    manner,      Judge       Wiener         reaches     the\n\nconstitutionality        of    §    666,       by    calling    it       a    jurisdictional\n\nquestion. With all due respect, this is a categorization with no\n\nsupport.\n\n      Jurisdiction       is    discussed        in    terms    of    “legislative”             and\n\n“adjudicative”     in    only      one     context     in     American         law    –    native\n\fAmerican law.235 This case does not arise in that context, so we\n\nmust     follow    the    generally     applied     definition   of   “federal\n\njurisdiction”.\n\n       Black’s    Law    Dictionary    defines    “federal   jurisdiction”    as\n\n“powers of federal courts founded on United States Constitution\n\n(Article III) and Acts of Congress (e.g. Title 28 of United States\n\nCode)”.236 Federal jurisdiction is not defined as the power of\n\nCongress to enact a statute. Professor Erwin Chemerinsky’s treatise\n\non the subject, widely regarded as comprehensive, not once mentions\n\nlegislative       jurisdiction    or   the   power    of   Congress   to   enact\n\nstatutes.237 The only discussion of congressional authority is\n\nCongress’       authority    to   control        federal   jurisdiction,     and\n\n\n       235\n        See Strate v.

However, Justice Scalia’s words do not support Judge\nWiener’s application. In Hartford Fire, Justice Scalia was faced\nwith determining the extraterritorial reach of a statute – a\nconstitutional issue placed by the parties before the Court – and\nto do so he had to consider whether Congress had the power to enact\nthe statute with application outside our borders. This, he termed\n“legislative jurisdiction”. Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 813-14, 113\nS.Ct. at 2918-19. He did not term it “jurisdiction” as a means of\nraising extraterritoriality sua sponte, in an end-run around our\nrequirement that parties argue those issues they wish before us.\n       236\n             Black’s Law Dictionary 612 (1990).\n       237\n             See Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction (1994).\n\n                                        96\n\fcongressional power to create courts.238 Neither of these questions\n\nis before us.\n\n     Moreover, Lipscomb explicitly asked that we find no subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction. “The alleged bribery here had no connection to\n\na federally funded program and, thus, the court below was without\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction to proceed.”239 Even if Judge Wiener’s\n\ncategorization can find support in the law, Lipscomb explicitly\n\nseeks      a    determination        of   adjudicative,   not     legislative\n\njurisdiction.\n\n     Judge Wiener’s categorization fails when extended to its\n\nlogical conclusion, which he affirmatively does in his opinion. He\n\nwrites: “[A] federal forum must lack adjudicative jurisdiction to\n\nhear a case based on a federal statute that Congress lacked the\n\nlegislative jurisdiction (translation: constitutional power or\n\nauthority) to apply to the situation in question.” This implies\n\nthat federal courts must always consider constitutionality, even\n\nraising it sua sponte, when interpreting a statute. This elevates\n\nconstitutionality to a category of claims over which we always have\n\njurisdiction, and this is unsupported by our jurisprudence.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully submit that Judge\n\nWiener’s       is   an   erroneous   analytical   framework,    and   leads   to\n\ninappropriate consideration of the constitutionality of § 666. For\n\n\n     238\n           See id. at 167-246.\n     239\n           See App. Brief at 28.\n\n                                          97\n\fthis reason, I believe it necessary to outline the appropriate\n\nanalytical framework.\n\n     As a threshold matter in all cases, we are faced with the\n\nquestion   whether    we   have   personal   and   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction.240 If we find that we do, we then address whatever\n\nsubstantive issues are before us. This is an abstract description\n\nof our task – what it means here is that we must first determine\n\nwhether Lipscomb’s actions fall within the jurisdiction of § 666,\n\nand if our answer is “yes,” then address the merits of his appeal.\n\nIt is at this second step that, were constitutionality at issue, it\n\nwould arise. Constitutionality is an issue on the merits, not a\n\njurisdictional one.\n\n     Our governing precedent interpreting § 666 does exactly this.\n\nWe have first answered the jurisdictional question, and have not\n\ntaken it upon ourselves to consider the constitutionality of § 666\n\nif it was not appropriately before us on the merits.241\n\n     240\n        See Steel Co. v.

Phillips,244 we reversed the conviction\n\nunder § 666 of a parish tax assessor, holding that he was not an\n\nagent   of   the   parish   for   purposes   of   the   statute.   Thus,   the\n\nstatute’s jurisdiction did not extend to his actions. No discussion\n\nof the merits was required; and the ensuing discussion on potential\n\nconstitutional issues is entirely dicta, because this court was\n\nwithout jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\n     Our most recent holding on the applicability of § 666 was in\n\nUnited States v. Reyes,245 where we affirmed the § 666 conviction of\n\na city councilman for accepting kickbacks on city contracts. We\n\nheld that whatever nexus is statutorily required for jurisdiction\n\nunder § 666, existed in that situation. We then went on to address\n\nthe evidentiary and sentencing issues before us.\n\n     Our analytical approach here should be exactly like that in\n\nthe above-cited line of cases.

STEP ONE – JURISDICTION\n\n      Our first step in the analytical two-step is to satisfy\n\nourselves of our jurisdiction over this case. Lipscomb argues that\n\nwe do not have subject matter jurisdiction, because his actions do\n\nnot   fall       within   those    governed     by     §   666.    He   argues   that\n\njurisdiction under § 666 does not extend to cases of local bribery\n\nsuch as his, where the underlying conduct does not directly involve\n\nfederal funds. A detailed review of Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court\n\nprecedent demonstrates that his argument fails as a matter of\n\nstatutory construction.246\n\n(A) Early Fifth Circuit Precedent\n\n      We first interpreted § 666 in United States v. Westmoreland.247\n\nThere, the defendant was a county supervisor convicted of accepting\n\nbribes      in    purchases   of    materials        for   the    county’s   highway\n\nconstruction projects.248 The district court found that the federal\n\nfunds received by the county were not spent by Westmoreland,249 and\n\n\n      246\n         Because Article III of the United States Constitution\nauthorizes federal courts to hear matters arising under all federal\nlaws, and § 666 is a federal law, we may turn directly to whether\nthere is statutory jurisdiction. U.S. CONST., Art. III. The question\nwhether § 666 is a valid exercise of congressional authority is not\nbefore us when we determine our jurisdiction.\n      247\n            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502711\"><a href=\"/opinion/502711/united-states-v-trudie-p-westmoreland/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1988).\n      248\n            See id. at 574-75.\n      249\n            See id.\n\n                                        101\n\fnonetheless convicted her under § 666.\n\n     Westmoreland argued on appeal that her bribery did not fall\n\nunder the jurisdiction of § 666, because it did not concern federal\n\nfunds.250 We rejected this argument, concluding through statutory\n\ninterpretation that federal funds need not be traceable to the\n\n“tainted transactions” in order for those transactions to be\n\npunishable under the statute:\n\n             [W]e find the relevant statutory language plain and\n             unambiguous. By the terms of section 666, when a local\n             government agency receives an annual benefit of more than\n             $10,000 under a federal assistance program, its agents\n             are governed by the statute, and an agent violates\n             subsection (b) when he engages in the prohibited conduct\n             “in any transaction or matter or series of transactions\n             or matters involving $5,000 or more concerning the\n             affairs of” the local government agency. 18 U.S.C. §\n             666(b) (Supp. 1984) [emphasis added]. Subsection (b)\n             contains nothing to indicate that “any transaction\n             involving $5,000\" means “any federally funded transaction\n             involving $5,000\" or “any transaction involving $5,000 of\n             federal funds,” and other subsections of the statute\n             contain no inconsistent provisions that might suggest\n             such a qualification.251\n\n     We next reviewed the jurisdictional reach of § 666 in United\n\nStates v. Moeller.252 There, the government appealed the dismissal\n\nof § 666 claims against employees of the Texas Federal Inspection\n\nService, state workers empowered to conduct federal inspections.253\n\nWe held that jurisdiction under § 666 extended to the employees’\n\n\n     250\n           See Westmoreland, 841 F.2d at 575.\n     251\n           Id. at 576.\n     252\n           </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601815\"><a href=\"/opinion/601815/united-states-v-mike-moeller-peter-thomas-mcrae-and-billie-quicksall/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1993).\n     253\n           See id.\n\n                                  102\n\factions, because the Texas Department of Agriculture, a “government\n\nagency” within § 666, received more than $10,000 a year in federal\n\nfunds; and the defendants were “agents” of that federally-funded\n\nagency for purposes of § 666.254\n\n     In United States v. Marmolejo,255 we upheld the conviction of\n\na sheriff who accepted bribes in return for permitting conjugal\n\nvisits to a federal prisoner whom Texas, in return for a fee from\n\nthe federal government, housed in a facility constructed with\n\nfederal funds.256 In holding that these actions came under the\n\njurisdiction     of   §   666,   we   referenced   our   earlier   statutory\n\ndecisions: “[w]e have previously held that § 666(a)(1)(B) does not\n\nrequire the government to prove that federal funds were directly\n\ninvolved in a bribery transaction, or that the federal monies\n\nfunded the corrupt transaction.”257 We went on to conclude that\n\nconjugal visits are “anything of value” under the statute.\n\n     The dissent in Marmolejo argued that Westmoreland interpreted\n\n§ 666 to reach “only those acts of bribery that could somehow be\n\ntraced, directly or indirectly, to the integrity of federal program\n\n\n\n\n     254\n           See id. at 1137-38.\n     255\n        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722386\"><a href=\"/opinion/722386/united-states-v-brigido-marmolejo-jr-and-mario-salinas/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1996), aff’d sub nom.

First, we\nare not the Supreme Court and have different limitations on our\njurisdiction. The Supreme Court, unlike us, is the definitive voice\nin interpreting federal statutes. See Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal\n\n                                      104\n\f     Since Salinas, the Supreme Court has decided only one other\n\ncase involving § 666 – United States v. Fischer.263 There the Court\n\naffirmed the      conviction   of    a    defendant     who   defrauded    a   city\n\nhospital    authority   that   participated        in   the   federal     Medicare\n\nprogram.264 The Fischer analysis, however, is not relevant to this\n\ncase.\n\n(C) Recent Fifth Circuit Cases\n\n     The first Fifth Circuit panel to interpret § 666 post-Salinas\n\ndecided    United   States   v.     Phillips.265   There,     we   reversed    the\n\nconviction of a parish tax assessor, holding that he was not an\n\n“agent” of St. Helena Parish for purposes of the statute. Thus, the\n\nstatute’s jurisdiction did not reach his activity. This has little\n\nbearing on our case, as city councilmen are clearly “agents” under\n\nthe statute.266\n\n\nJurisdiction 571 (1994). Second, the Supreme Court in Salinas\ndeclined to avoid the constitutional question because it considered\nit a greater disservice to “rewrite language enacted by the\nlegislature” than to fail to avoid the issue. Salinas, 522 U.S. at\n59.   This   reasoning   does   not   compel  us    to  reach   the\nconstitutionality of § 666 here; if anything, it counsels against\nthat. We are not rewriting § 666 – we are faithfully reading the\nlanguage of the statute, and recognizing that in order to question\nthe    congressionally-enacted      language,    the    issue    of\nconstitutionality must be explicitly before us.\n     263\n           </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118365\"><a href=\"/opinion/118365/fischer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118365\"><a href=\"/opinion/118365/fischer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Reyes267 we affirmed the § 666 conviction\n\nof a city councilman for accepting kickbacks on city contracts. We\n\nheld that whatever nexus is statutorily required for jurisdiction\n\nunder § 666, existed in that case.268\n\n     More recently, we decided United States v.

The Westmoreland view of §\n\n666   therefore   continues   to   be   the   law   in   this   circuit,   and\n\nprecludes us from more narrowly construing the statute here.\n\nBecause Lipscomb’s actions satisfy the jurisdictional requirements\n\nfound in the language of § 666, we conclude that the district court\n\nhad jurisdiction to try Lipscomb under § 666, and turn to the\n\nissues which the parties put before us on the merits.\n\n                        III. STEP TWO – MERITS\n\n      Before reaching the issues raised by Lipscomb, I must address\n\nthe issue of the constitutionality of § 666 – an issue raised not\n\nby the Appellant, but by the opinions of my colleagues on this\n\npanel.    This issue is not properly before us, but because my\n\ncolleagues have raised it, I respond.\n\n(A) Constitutionality of § 666\n\n      There do exist troubling constitutional issues under the\n\nsurface of this case. Whether Congress had the authority it claimed\n\nto enact § 666 under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, U.S.\n\nCONST., art. I, § 8, is a close question.            However, although my\n\ncolleagues hold otherwise, it is not our question today. We may\n\nonly decide those issues properly before us, and the constitutional\n\nquestion is not such an issue. It was argued neither at trial nor\n\non appeal, and there is no legal justification for us to raise it\n\nsua sponte.\n\n      (1) Not Argued at Trial\n\n                                    107\n\f     The     record    shows   that    despite   mention   of   potential\n\nconstitutional issues, Lipscomb never argued at trial that § 666\n\nwas unconstitutional as applied to him. Following is discussion of\n\nthe four motions by which he made the jurisdictional argument, and\n\nwhere any constitutional discussion at all (not sufficient to raise\n\nthe issue of constitutionality) exists.\n\n             (a) Motion to Dismiss the Indictment or, Alternatively,\n             for an Evidentiary Hearing Requiring the Government to\n             Establish Federal Jurisdiction\n\n     On September 3, 1999, Lipscomb filed a Motion to Dismiss the\n\nIndictment or, Alternatively, for an Evidentiary Hearing Requiring\n\nthe Government to Establish Federal Jurisdiction.271 It is worth\n\nnoting that the title of the Motion shows that it seeks proof of\n\nfederal jurisdiction, and does not challenge the constitutionality\n\nof § 666. Moreover, Lipscomb crafts his arguments in support of the\n\nMotion in terms of challenging federal jurisdiction. “In this\n\ncase... no sufficient jurisdictional basis is evident.”272 “On its\n\nface, this indictment fails even to allege an appropriate basis for\n\nthe exercise of federal jurisdiction....”273\n\n     Lipscomb does mention the potential constitutional problems\n\nthat could arise if § 666 is applied to his conduct. He goes so far\n\nas to say “[s]ection 666 is being unconstitutionally applied in\n\n\n\n     271\n           See R. at 60.\n     272\n           R. at 62.\n     273\n           R. at 63.\n\n                                      108\n\fthis case,” and mentions possible Tenth Amendment consequences of\n\napplying § 666 to Lipscomb’s conduct.274 Moreover, one of Lipscomb’s\n\nattorneys signed the Motion as “Special Counsel for Tenth Amendment\n\npurposes only”.275 However, this discussion arises in the context of\n\na   challenge    to    jurisdiction,   not   as   a   challenge   to   the\n\nconstitutionality of the statute as applied (which would arise\n\nunder the Spending Clause, not the Tenth Amendment). Even the\n\nstatement “[s]ection 666 is being unconstitutionally applied in\n\nthis case”276 stands alone, and is not supported by any argument.\n\n     The District Court denied Lipscomb’s motion:\n\n             Came to be considered the motion of the defendants to\n             dismiss the indictment for lack of federal jurisdiction,\n             and after due consideration thereof, as well as a plain\n             reading of the statute, and the briefs and arguments of\n             counsel, this court is of the opinion that the motion\n             should be DENIED.277\n\nJudge Kendall declined to dismiss the indictment because he found\n\nthat federal jurisdiction did exist. He neither mentioned nor\n\nconsidered the constitutionality of § 666. His Order includes the\n\nhand-written addition of the phrase “as well as a plain reading of\n\nthe statute,” further supporting the conclusion that his analysis\n\nwas a statutory and not a constitutional one.\n\n             (b) Motion for Judgment of Acquittal Pursuant to Rule\n\n     274\n           Id.\n     275\n           R. at 66.\n     276\n           R. at 63.\n     277\n           Id.\n\n                                   109\n\f               29(A), Following the Government’s Case in Chief\n\n       Following the government’s case, Lipscomb moved the District\n\nCourt for Judgment of Acquittal.278 Lipscomb argued that some nexus\n\nbetween the bribe and the federally-funded program must exist in\n\norder    for    there     to    be    jurisdiction,      and    that    here,    no   such\n\nconnection exists.279 He couched his argument in terms of “get[ting]\n\nthis    case     in   federal        court    properly,”       which     is   clearly   a\n\njurisdictional concern.280 Later in the colloquy Lipscomb’s attorney\n\ntold    Judge    Kendall       that    “666    doesn’t    cover      this”,281   another\n\nargument about the scope of jurisdiction under § 666.\n\n       The Government’s response follows the same approach, citing\n\ncases that analyze the jurisdictional reach of § 666, not its\n\nconstitutionality.282 The District Court denied the Motion.\n\n               (c) Motion for Judgment of Acquittal Pursuant to Rule\n               29(A), Following the Jury Verdict\n\n       On February 8, 2000, following the jury verdict, Lipscomb\n\nagain moved the District Court for Judgment of Acquittal.283\n\nHe argued that the Government failed to present evidence of a\n\nconnection      between        the   alleged   bribes     and    a     federally-funded\n\n\n       278\n             See R. Vol. 13 at 32.\n       279\n             See id. at 36-9.\n       280\n             Id. at 37.\n       281\n             Id. at 40.\n       282\n             See id. at 41-2.\n       283\n             See R. at 556.\n\n                                             110\n\fprogram.284 Lipscomb asks the court again to find a failure of\n\njurisdiction due to the lack of nexus.\n\n     The     Government’s    response    cites   case    law   analyzing   the\n\njurisdictional reach of § 666.285 The Government makes no argument\n\nthat § 666 is constitutional as applied, suggesting that it did not\n\nconsider a constitutional argument raised. Further, the District\n\nCourt’s     denial   of   Lipscomb’s    Motion   makes    no   mention   of   a\n\nconstitutional issue.286\n\n             (d) Conditional Motion for Voluntary Surrender Date and\n             Bond Pending Appeal\n\n     Lipscomb filed a Conditional Motion for Voluntary Surrender\n\nDate and Bond Pending Appeal on April 26, 2000.287 He sought bond\n\npending appeal because:\n\n             it is legitimately predictable that the Fifth Circuit in\n             light of the Salinas [sic] opinion and its subsequent\n             interpretation by the other federal circuits will revisit\n             its past positions regarding the necessary connection\n             between the federal funds and the alleged bribes.288\n\nLipscomb seeks bond because he thinks the Fifth Circuit on appeal\n\nwill find a nexus requirement for jurisdiction under § 666. This is\n\na pure question of statutory interpretation. Nowhere does Lipscomb\n\nseek bond pending appeal because he thinks the Fifth Circuit might\n\n\n     284\n           See R. at 560.\n     285\n           See R. at 600, 617-19.\n     286\n           See R. at 644.\n     287\n           See R. at 898.\n     288\n           R. at 901.\n\n                                       111\n\ffind § 666 as applied to his conduct unconstitutional. That is\n\nbecause he never made such an argument.\n\n     (2) Not Argued on Appeal\n\n     Even assuming arguendo that constitutionality was argued at\n\ntrial, it was certainly not preserved on appeal, which is required\n\nif we are to consider it. The record shows that despite mention of\n\npotential constitutional issues, Lipscomb did not argue on appeal\n\nthat § 666 was unconstitutional as applied to him.\n\n     Lipscomb’s Appellate Brief repeatedly uses the vocabulary of\n\njurisdiction, not constitutionality, to define his claim. In his\n\nrequest for oral argument, Lipscomb writes that “[t]his appeal\n\ninvolves a substantial jurisdictional question,” and never mentions\n\na constitutional question.289 Moreover, Lipscomb defined the issue\n\nas follows:\n\n                 The fact that the City of Dallas received federal funds\n                 in excess of $10,000 in a given year does not, without\n                 more, establish federal jurisdiction to prosecute a City\n                 Councilman for bribery under 18 U.S.C. 666 [sic].290\n\nConstitutionality is not mentioned.\n\n     Lipscomb writes that “it is incumbent upon federal courts –\n\ntrial      and    appellate   –   to   constantly   examine   the   basis   for\n\njurisdiction....”291 “A nexus between the expenditure of federal\n\n\n     289\n           App. Brief at ii.\n     290\n           Id. at iii, 2, 19 (emphasis added).\n     291\n        Id. at 19, qtg.

The\n              alleged      bribery was unrelated to any expenditure of\n              federal     monies. Accordingly, Federal [sic] jurisdiction\n              did not     and does not exist.293\n\nLipscomb’s argument is it is a jurisdictional requirement of § 666\n\nthat there be some connection between the bribe and the federal\n\nfunds.294\n\n      Lipscomb concludes his argument on this issue with the words\n\n“[t]he alleged bribery here had no connection to a federally funded\n\nprogram and, thus, the court below was without subject matter\n\njurisdiction to proceed.”295 I can imagine no clearer statement that\n\nhis   claim       is    jurisdictional,    unless    you   consider   Lipscomb’s\n\nconclusion and plea for relief:\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, the defendant-appellant,\n              ALBERT LOUIS LIPSCOMB, respectfully requests that this\n              Court reverse these convictions and remand the case to\n              the district court with instructions to dismiss the\n              indictment for lack of federal jurisdiction.296\n\n      Lipscomb’s Appellate Brief also sheds light on his District\n\nCourt arguments, and exposes them as purely jurisdictional, not\n\n      292\n            App. Brief at 14.\n      293\n            Id.\n      294\n            See id. at 20.\n      295\n            App. Brief at 28.\n      296\n            Id. at 59 (emphasis added).\n\n                                          113\n\fconstitutional. He writes that he “objected to the absence of\n\nfederal jurisdiction before, during and after trial.”297 Not once\n\ndoes he claim to have objected at trial on the basis that the\n\nstatute was unconstitutional. Moreover, had he thought that he had\n\nargued constitutionality at trial, we would expect him on appeal to\n\nchallenge the District Court’s failure to decide that issue.\n\nLipscomb makes no such challenge, further showing that he never\n\nmade an argument regarding the constitutionality of § 666.\n\n     Lipscomb does mention that contrary statutory interpretation\n\ncould raise constitutional concerns.298 However, as before the\n\nDistrict Court, this is mere mention of potential constitutional\n\nconcerns in the context of a jurisdictional challenge; it is not a\n\nchallenge to the constitutionality of § 666.

Until that day, we must answer only those questions\n\nbefore us. Because the constitutionality of § 666 was not argued at\n\ntrial or on appeal, and there is no legal justification for our\n\nreaching it, I must respectfully dissent from the entire discussion\n\nof constitutionality found in the opinions of both Judge Wiener and\n\nJudge Smith.317\n\n     315\n           Id. (internal citations omitted, emphasis added).\n     316\n           See Grundstrom, 404 F.2d at 648.\n     317\n         Judge Smith challenges my analysis of whether the\nconstitutional issue was raised as “hyper-technical,” and\n“elevat[ing] semantics over substance. While I appreciate the value\nhe places on avoiding hyper-technicality, I cannot agree with\nelevating that goal over our requirement that parties raise the\nissues they wish us to decide. I seek no magic words; I wish only\nthat the parties would clearly raise those issues they wish us and\nthe district court to decide (as our precedent requires). The\nparties here did not meet even this most-light burden on the issue\nof the constitutionality of § 666.\n\n     In the same vein, Judge Smith accuses me of invoking the\n\n                                  119\n\f(B) Transfer\n\n     I concur in Judge Wiener’s discussion and conclusions on the\n\ntransfer issue.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, I concur in part and dissent in\n\npart, but share Judge Wiener’s conclusion that we must reverse\n\nLipscomb’s conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for a new\n\ntrial.\n\n\n\n\n“rigid form pleading” that was eliminated by the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. This misunderstands my analysis. To the contrary,\nI am not concerned with what the parties raise in the complaints\nand answers that set out in broad brushstrokes the case they intend\nto bring. However, we must (and our precedent shows we do) require\nparties to specifically argue before us and the district court, at\nsome point during the adjudication of their dispute, what issues\nthey wish decided. The courts are not required to divine what\nissues are before them, nor do they have the power to choose what\nissues they would like to be before them – that is the\nresponsibility of the parties.\n\n     The conclusions of Judge Wiener and Judge Smith place a burden\non the trial court to read between the lines of the parties’\narguments and ascertain what the parties “should have” or “could\nhave” argued. That is just not the way our judicial system works.\nThe burden lies with the parties to place a case or controversy\nbefore the court. On the issue of constitutionality, that burden\nwas not met here. Requiring judges to act as mindreaders, as Judge\nWiener and Judge Smith do here, cannot be an acceptable part of our\njudicial system.\n\n                               120\n\fJERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n\n\n       I would reverse the conviction and render a judgment of dis-\n\nmissal with prejudice, thereby precluding a retrial of defendant\n\nAlbert Lipscomb. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the con-\n\ntrary result reached by Judge Wiener’s opinion and Judge Duhé’s\n\npartial concurrence, which is to subject this seventy-seven-year-\n\nold defendantSSwho has already served more than half of his ap-\n\nproximately three and one-half-year sentence of incarceration wait-\n\ning for his appeal to be decidedSSto a new trial under a statute\n\nthat has no application to him.\n\n       Two of the three judges on this panel are of the view that\n\nLipscomb properly raised the issue of whether 18 U.S.C. § 666 is\n\nunconstitutional as applied to him. Nonetheless, we fail to decide\n\nthat issue because one of the judges declines to address it, leav-\n\ning the other two judges evenly split on the question.    If we were\n\nto address it, we should easily conclude that Congress has no au-\n\nthority to criminalize Lipscomb’s conduct, and the government had\n\nno authority to subject him to a first trial, let alone a second\n\none.\n\n\n\n                                  I.\n\n       Judge Duhé is correct that “[c]onstitutionality is an issue on\n\nthe merits, not a jurisdictional one.”     He also accurately states\n\nthat a criminal defendant may waive constitutional challenges to a\n\fstatute by failing to argue them.     Although Judge Duhé follows the\n\nproper methodology by looking to Lipscomb’s four trial motions and\n\nhis appellate brief for the answer, Judge Duhé errs in applying a\n\nhyper-technical test in reviewing Lipscomb’s arguments, a test\n\nthat elevates semantics over substance.\n\n     Our inquiry is a relatively easy one:       Has Lipscomb argued\n\nthat Congress cannot reach his conduct under the United States\n\nConstitution?   When we focus on the text of Lipscomb’s motions and\n\nbriefs, we can have no doubt that the answer is yes.\n\n\n\n                                A.\n\n     Judge Duhé argues that Lipscomb’s September 3, 1999, “Motion\n\nTo Dismiss the Indictment or, Alternatively, for an Evidentiary\n\nHearing Requiring the Government To Establish Federal Jurisdiction”\n\nis a motion that “seeks proof of federal jurisdiction, and does not\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of § 666.” But the full text shows\n\nthat Lipscomb is making a constitutional argument; he just uses the\n\nwords “jurisdiction” and “power” interchangeably:\n\n          However, in Salinas, the Court squarely left open\n     the question whether Section 666 “requires some other\n     kind of connection between a bribe and the expenditure of\n     federal funds” lest it be applied in some manner which\n     would alter or fail to “give proper respect to the\n     federal-state balance” of powers [quoting Salinas]. The\n     Court found “no serious doubt about the constitutionality\n     of Section 666(a)(1)(B) as applied to the facts of this\n     case” [quoting Salinas].\n\n          In this case, however, no sufficient jurisdictional\n     basis is evident . . . .       Any exercise of federal\n\n                                122\n\fjurisdiction must demonstrate a proper respect for con-\ncepts of dual sovereignty and federalism. On its face,\nthis indictment fails even to allege an appropriate basis\nfor the exercise of federal jurisdiction and accordingly\nSection 666 is being unconstitutionally applied in this\ncase . . . .\n\n     The Tenth Amendment . . . provides: [quoting] . . .\n[T]he 'double security' embodied in the concept of fed-\neralism requires 'a proper balance between the States and\nthe Federal Government” [citing Gregory v.

Why would he employ a “Special\n\nCounsel for Tenth Amendment purposes only,” and have that counsel\n\nsign the motion?        Why would he twice invoke the Tenth Amendment and\n\ncite the Tenth Amendment cases of Gregory, Printz, and New York v.\n\nUnited States, as well as Alden’s Tenth Amendment discussion?

Why would he\n\nthree times argue that § 666 upsets the constitution’s federal-\n\nstate balance of powers?          Why would he three times state that § 666\n\nis being unconstitutionally applied to him?\n\n       Judge Duhé sidesteps all of this and, instead, notes that the\n\nmotion’s        title         mentions       federal           jurisdiction,         not\n\nconstitutionality,        and     Lipscomb      uses    the    word     “jurisdiction”\n\nthroughout his argument.            Since when do we accord one word such\n\ntalismanic power that its mere presence or absence in a motion or\n\nbrief can negate all remaining arguments?                    Since when do we forbid\n\na defendant from raising two pointsSSboth constitutionality and\n\njurisdictionSSin        one   motion?

As Judge Wiener explains,\n\nsometimes Lipscomb uses “jurisdiction” to refer to a federal\n\ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction, and sometimes he uses “juris-\n\ndiction” to refer to the persons and acts over which Congress may\n\nlegislate.   But any confusion is easily eliminated:    Substitute\n\n“federal power” or “congressional power” every time Lipscomb says\n\n“jurisdiction” in his motion, and the motion’s meaning remains the\n\nsame.   But substitute “subject matter jurisdiction” or “federal\n\ncourt jurisdiction,” and parts of the motion become nonsensical.\n\n     For example, the final paragraph makes no sense when “federal\n\ncourt jurisdiction” is used:\n\n          The proper state-federal balance is disturbed when\n     there is an intrusion upon State prerogatives in\n     important areas reserved to the States. This indictment\n     fails to identify the federal interest served by this\n     exercise of [federal court jurisdiction] and therefore\n     constitutes an unconstitutional application of Section\n     666 . . . . [Federal court jurisdiction] is being\n     exercised in a manner that plainly intrudes upon the\n     prerogative of the States to define, apply and enforce\n     criminal law, and to monitor and oversee the operation of\n     its government.\n\nBut this paragraph reads perfectly well when “congressional power”\n\nis filled in.\n\n     Lipscomb’s lack of artfulness should not doom his appeal, es-\n\npecially given that the Supreme Court and our circuit often have\n\n\n\n                                125\n\fbeen guilty of the same offense of conflating “jurisdiction” and\n\n“power.”   In United States v.

Lipscomb made, inter\n\nalia, the following arguments:\n\n          As applied to Lipscomb, 18 U.S.C. § 666 is\n     unconstitutional. No evidence was introduced that any of\n     the funds given to Lipscomb can be connected to “a threat\n     to the integrity and proper function of a federal pro-\n     gram.” None of the federal funds was shown to relate to\n     the taxicab industry. At no time did any of the votes\n     alleged in the indictment impinge upon the use, distribu-\n     tion, diversion or application of any federal funds.\n     Congress intended to protect federal and the integrity of\n     those funds.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n     Lipscomb flatly states that § 666 is unconstitutional as ap-\n\nplied to him, and he follows with a constitutional argument from\n\nSalinas.   The Salinas Court explained that because the crime “was\n\n                                       126\n\fa threat to the integrity and proper operation of the federal\n\nprogram[,    w]hatever   might   be     said    about   §   666(a)(1)(B)’s\n\napplication in other cases, the application of § 666(a)(1)(B) to\n\nSalinas did not extend federal power beyond its proper bounds.”\n\nSalinas v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118151\"><a href=\"/opinion/118151/salinas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61 (1997).           Lipscomb argues\n\nthe inverseSSbecause his crime did not threaten the integrity and\n\nproper operation of a federal program, the application of § 666 to\n\nhim is not constitutional.\n\n     Judge Duhé recharacterizes this argument as a challenge to the\n\njurisdictional reach of § 666; Lipscomb, he concludes, actually is\n\nasserting that § 666 requires a nexus between federal funds and the\n\nbribery.    Judge Duhé does not explain why, if this is so, Lipscomb\n\nfailed to place this argument under heading B of his motionSS“The\n\nGovernment has failed to establish the jurisdictional prerequisite\n\nfor each substantive count.”\n\n     Nor does Judge Duhé explain why Lipscomb would support this\n\nargument by quoting from the same passage in Salinas that held,\n\n“The text of § 666(a)(1)(B) is unambiguous . . . [and] does not\n\nrequire the Government to prove federal funds were involved in the\n\nbribery transaction.”     Salinas, 522 U.S. at 60.          Instead, Judge\n\nDuhé notes that neither the government nor the district court\n\nmentioned the constitutional issue.            Just because the district\n\ncourt and the government may have misunderstood Lipscomb’s claim,\n\nhowever, does not mean he failed to present it.\n\n\n                                  127\n\f                                    B.\n\n      Lipscomb devotes ten pages of his appellate brief to the\n\nconstitutional issue.    Even though Lipscomb admits that “[i]t is\n\nnot a jurisdictional requirement of [§] 666 that the alleged bribe\n\nactually affect federal funds,” Judge Duhé insists that Lipscomb is\n\nmaking only a jurisdictional argument. More incredibly, Judge Duhé\n\nclaims Lipscomb “never mentions a constitutional question,” even\n\nthough Lipscomb states, “there must be some connection between the\n\nbribe and the expenditure of federal funds.      Otherwise, the reach\n\nof § 666 intrudes well beyond the scope of federal authority into\n\nareas of state responsibility, and serious constitutional questions\n\nare presented.”   (Emphasis added.)\n\n      Lipscomb further notes that the Salinas Court\n\n      left open the question whether Section 666 “requires some\n      other kind of connection between a bribe and the\n      expenditure of federal funds” lest it be applied in some\n      manner which would alter or fail to “give respect to the\n      federal-state balance” of powers [citation]. “Whatever\n      might be said about [§] 666(a)(1)(B)'s application in\n      other cases, the application of Section 666(a)(1)(B) to\n      Salinas did not extend federal power beyond its proper\n      bounds.” [citation].\n\n      Lipscomb follows with the observation that “[a]ny exercise of\n\nfederal jurisdiction must demonstrate a proper respect for concepts\n\nof dual sovereignty and federalism (citing the Tenth Amendment).\n\nThe    States'    constitutional     prerogatives   plainly   include\n\n'constitutional responsibility for the establishment and operation\n\nof its own government . . . .      [citing Gregory, 501 U.S. at 462].”\n\n\n                                   128\n\fHe adds, “As a constitutional principle, it simply cannot be that\n\n$10,000.00 in federal funds provided to a major city trumps the\n\nTenth Amendment and the prerogatives and responsibilities reserved\n\nto   the   States”   (referring      also   to   our   “republican       form   of\n\ngovernment”) (emphasis added).\n\n      Lipscomb further argues that § 666 is enacted under the\n\nSpending Clause, which has limits.               Beyond those limits, the\n\n“delicate   balance    of   federalism”     is    obliterated,      he   argues.\n\nFinally, Lipscomb notes that a prosecution under § 666 must be\n\n“undergirded by some adequate federal jurisdictional base” to avoid\n\nserious constitutional problems.”\n\n      Again, Lipscomb uses the term “jurisdiction” loosely, and he\n\nsometimes makes two arguments under one heading in his brief.\n\nNonetheless,    he    easily   has    raised     adequately   the    requisite\n\nconstitutional arguments.\n\n\n\n                                      II.\n\n      Despite the caption of this opinion as a dissent, this part II\n\nis not a dissent, because there is no majority decision, on this\n\nissue, from which to dissent.         Judge Wiener opines that § 666 is\n\nconstitutional as applied, and I conclude, to the contrary, that\n\nthe statute is unconstitutional as applied.              But Judge Duhé de-\n\nclines to address this issue, even in the alternative, despite that\n\nit is law of the case, under the majority holding of two judges,\n\n\n                                      129\n\fthat the issue is properly raised and preserved.\n\n     So, although a majority of this court holds that Lipscomb pro-\n\nperly raised and preserved this constitutional challenge, and al-\n\nthough this challenge, if decided, could lead to Lipscomb’s im-\n\nmediate release with no possibility of retrial, we do not rule on\n\nit. The government had no authority to try Lipscomb the first time\n\naround;   instead   of   announcing     that   fact   and   ending   these\n\nproceedings, we compound the error by forcing Lipscomb to undergo\n\na second illegitimate trial.\n\n     The full absurdity of today’s decision comes to light when we\n\nimagine the future of this case.      If Lipscomb is convicted a second\n\ntime, he presumably will appeal (if he lives that long; he is\n\nelderly and too ill to be incarcerated in prison).          In his second\n\nappeal, Lipscomb could argue the same constitutional claim before\n\nthis same courtSSperhaps even before this same panelSSand this time,\n\nbecause he was careful to omit the word “jurisdiction” from his\n\nbrief, he could be acquitted and told that the government never had\n\nthe power to try or detain him in the first case.           As I explain\n\nbelow, this should be our decision today.\n\n\n\n                                   A.\n\n     As Judge Wiener explains, Westmoreland’s broad construction of\n\n§ 666 continues to be the law in this circuit, so we are precluded\n\nfrom construing the statute to avoid a constitutional question. We\n\n\n\n                                 130\n\fmust, perforce, examine Lipscomb’s constitutional challenge to the\n\nstatute as applied.\n\n      Congress enacted § 666 under the Spending Clause.318 Phillips,\n\n219 F.3d at 414.

This connection is so tenuous as to be no connection at all; were\nit enough to satisfy the Dole test, then “the spending power could render\nacademic the Constitution’s other grants and limits of federal authority.” Id.\n\n                                      133\n\f                                      B.\n\n       Recognizing that Dole does not answer the question, we turn\n\nelsewhere for constitutional grounding.

Whatever might be said about\n       § 666(a)(1)(B)’s application in other cases, the\n       application of § 666(a)(1)(B) to Salinas did not extend\n       federal power beyond its proper bounds.

Unfortunately, the Court did not re-\n\nveal    the   framework   it   used   in    concluding   that   §   666   was\n\nconstitutionally applied in Salinas, nor did it say what test\n\nshould be used in determining whether other applications of the\n\nstatute are constitutional.       We conduct our own inquiry, because\n\nthis case, unlike Salinas, does not involve any readily apparent\n\nconnection to federal funds or programs.\n\n       As I have said, the fact that § 666 is not a direct exercise\n\nof the spending power does not doom its constitutionality.                The\n\nConstitution gives Congress the power “To make all Laws which shall\n\nbe necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing\n\npowers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the\n\nGovernment of the United States, or in any Department or Officer\n\n\n                                      134\n\fthereof.”    U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8.       Thus, to determine whether the\n\napplication of § 666 to Lipscomb’s acceptance of bribes by a local\n\ntaxi company is constitutional, we must decide whether prosecuting\n\nsuch behavior is “necessary and proper” to carrying out Congress’s\n\nspending power.323\n\n\n\n                                       1.\n\n      We examine the relevant legislative history to discover why\n\nCongress thought that § 666 was necessary and for what purposes it\n\ndeemed the statute proper, for although Congress is not the final\n\njudge of what is necessary and proper to carry out its powers, it\n\nis likely to have an informed opinion on the matter.              Such opinion\n\nis particularly persuasive to the extent that it finds legislation\n\nis necessary and proper only in limited circumstances, because, in\n\nsuch cases, we need not worry that Congress’s interpretation is\n\nmotivated by a desire to expand its power beyond proper bounds.\n\nThus, when Congress states that legislation passed as necessary and\n\nproper to carry out one of its enumerated powers is actually neces-\n\nsary only in certain circumstances, we should be hesitant to con-\n\n\n\n      323\n          Since the early days of the Republic, the Necessary and Proper Clause\nhas provided justification for laws necessary for the execution of Congressional\npowers. For example, in McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85272\"><a href=\"/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1819), the Court\nheld that the enactment of a law establishing a national bank was necessary and\nproper to carrying into execution the spending power, the commerce power, the\ntaxing power, the power to coin money, and the war power. Chief Justice Marshall\ndescribed the reach of the clause as follows: “Let the end be legitimate, let\nit be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\nwhich are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with\nthe letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.” Id.\n\n                                      135\n\fclude that the Necessary and Proper Clause permits the legislation\n\nto reach further than Congress felt necessary or proper to carry\n\nout its delegated powers.\n\n     Courts have recognized the particular relevance of the legis-\n\nlative history of § 666 in casesSSlike thisSSin which that history\n\nshows Congress’s limited goals in drafting a broadly worded stat-\n\nute. The legislative history of the act shows that Congress passed\n\n§ 666 because it was concerned with its inability to protect fed-\n\neral funds once they are transferred from the federal government to\n\nstates, local governments, and agencies.    Section 666 “is designed\n\nto create new offenses to augment the ability of the United States\n\nto vindicate significant acts of theft, fraud, and bribery involv-\n\ning Federal monies that are disbursed to private organizations or\n\nState and local governments pursuant to a Federal program.”      1984\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 3510 (emphasis added).     Congress also stated that\n\n“the purpose of this section [is] to protect the integrity of the\n\nvast sums of money distributed through Federal programs from theft,\n\nfraud, and undue influence by bribery.”     Id. at 3511.\n\n     In Salinas, the Court noted that § 666 was enacted in response\n\nto specific difficulties the federal government had encountered un-\n\nder preceding statutes in prosecuting the theft of federal funds by\n\nnon-federal employees.   The Court explained:\n\n     Before § 666 was enacted, the federal criminal code con-\n     tained a single, general bribery provision codified at 18\n     U.S.C. § 201. Section 201 by its terms applied only to\n     “public official[s],” which the statute defined as “offi-\n\n                                136\n\f      cer[s] or employee[s] or person[s] acting for or on be-\n      half of the United States . . . .” § 201(a). The Courts\n      of Appeals divided over whether state and local employees\n      could be considered “public officials” under § 201(a)\n      . . . . § 666(a)(1)(B) was designed to extend federal\n      bribery prohibitions to bribes offered to state and local\n      officials employed by agencies receiving federal funds.\n      The facts and reasoning of [United States v.] Del Toro,\n      [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"326715\"><a href=\"/opinion/326715/united-states-v-william-del-toro-and-william-kaufman/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 661-62 (2d Cir. 1975)], give particular\n      instruction in this respect. In that case, the Second\n      Circuit held that a city employee was not a “public offi-\n      cial” under § 201(a) even though federal funds would\n      eventually cover 100% of the costs and 80% of the sala-\n      ries of the program he administered. 513 F.2d, at 662.\n      Because the program had not yet entered a formal request\n      for federal funding, the Second Circuit reasoned,\n      “[t]here were no existing committed federal funds for the\n      purpose.” Ibid. The enactment of § 666 forecloses this\n      type of limitation.\n\nSalinas, 522 U.S. at 58-59.        Moreover, in United States v. Zwick,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684 (3d Cir. 1999), the court explained that under a\n\nseparate statute criminalizing the theft of federal property, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 641,\n\n      the federal government could prosecute only when it could\n      establish that the stolen property was property of the\n      United States, which often was impossible if title had\n      passed before the property was stolen or when federal\n      funds were so commingled with non-federal funds that the\n      federal character of those funds could not be shown.[324]\n\nFurthermore, the Senate Report states that the intent of § 666 is\n\n“to reach thefts and bribery in situations of the types involved in\n\nthe Del Toro, Hinton, and Mosley cases cited herein[.]”            S. REP. NO.\n\n98-225, 369-370, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3511.             The court in Zwick\n\n\n\n      324\n          Based on this legislative history, the Zwick court concluded that\n“[t]he goal [of § 666] was to overcome impediments to reaching actions in which\nthere was a federal interest, not to federalize crimes in which a federal\ninterest was lacking.” Zwick, 199 F.3d at 684.\n\n                                     137\n\fnoted that the corrupt transactions in these three cases all plain-\n\nly implicated federal interests.       Zwick, 199 F.3d at 684.\n\n     In Del Toro, the defendants conspired to bribe Pedro Morales,\n\nthe Assistant Administrator of the Harlem-East Harlem Model Cities\n\nProgram, for which the United States Department of Housing and Ur-\n\nban Development (“HUD”) paid 100% of the cost of the program and\n\n80% of its salaries. Because Morales was a city employee, however,\n\nthe court concluded that, notwithstanding that he was administering\n\na HUD program, he was not a “public official” for purposes of § 201\n\nand therefore could not be prosecuted.

Here again, the defendant was covered by § 201,\n\nbecause he exercised discretion in the administration of federal\n\nfunds.      In Zwick, the court concluded that the inclusion of these\n\ncases as examples of conduct that would be covered by § 666 showed\n\nthat Congress intended that the statute would be applied only in\n\ncorruption cases impacting federal interests.325\n\n      Although I do not agree that the plain language of § 666 al-\n\nlows prosecution only where the charged corrupt activity has impact\n\non a federal interest, the fact that Congress did not find it ne-\n\ncessary that § 666 be applied in cases not involving federal funds\n\nor programs is highly relevant to the issue of whether the stat-\n\nute’s application to local corruption not involving federal funds\n\nis “necessary and proper” to execute the spending power.

The Zwick court also noted that\n“[a]nother comment in the Senate Report illustrates that an entity’s receipt of\nfederal funds does not automatically establish a federal interest in corrupt\nactivity of employees of that entity.” Id. The court quoted the Senate Report:\n“For example, if a government agency lawfully purchases more than $10,000 in\nequipment from a supplier, it is not the intent of this section to make a theft\nof $5,000 or more from the supplier a Federal crime.” Id.

Their views on what limitations are\n\nnecessary to keep § 666 within the realm of constitutionality are\n\ntherefore useful.

In Suarez, only the dissent analyzed the constitutional\nissue and Supreme Court precedent, and the dissent concluded that the statute was\nunconstitutional as applied:\n\n             To sustain Suarez’s conviction would make § 666 a\n             generalized anti-corruption statute under the spending\n             power.   The best reading of the Fischer and Salinas\n             cases seems to be that the Supreme Court does not want\n             this interpretation to take hold.\n\nId.

To pass\n            muster under the Spending Clause, legislation\n            regulating behavior of entities receiving\n            federal funds must, among other things, be\n            based   upon  a   federal   interest   in  the\n            particular conduct.

Applying § 666 to\n            offense conduct, absent evidence of any\n            federal interest, would appear to be an\n            unconstitutional exercise of power under the\n            Spending Clause.\n\nZwick, 199 F.3d at 687 (footnote omitted).            The court thus rejected\n\nthe government’s position that no connection between the bribery\n\nand the federal funds was necessary beyond proof that the agency in\n\nquestion had received federal funds in excess of $10,000.                 To do\n\notherwise, the court reasoned, would eviscerate significant fed-\n\neral-state boundaries by turning § 666 into a general anti-corrup-\n\ntion statute, an intention not expressed by Congress.

Thus, the Santopietro court reversed and\n\nheld that the defendants could be convicted under § 666.        Even\n\nthough the bribery at issue did not result in a loss of $5,000 or\n\nmore to the town, the statutory requirement that a transaction of\n\nat least $5,000 be involved was plainly satisfied by the fact that\n\nthe total bribe was $25,000.   Id. at 92-93.\n\n     Santopietro, however, did not retreat from Foley’s requirement\n\nof “at least some connection between the bribe and a risk to the\n\nintegrity of the federal funded [sic] program,” because “nothing in\n\nSalinas disturbs such a requirement.”   Id. at 93.   The court held\n\nthat a federal connection sufficient to satisfy § 666 existed where\n\nreal estate developers had made corrupt payments to the mayor, the\n\nRepublican town chairman, and the president of the board of alder-\n\n\n                                142\n\fmen to secure their influence in landing city development contracts\n\nthat were substantially funded by HUD dollars.              Id.   The court held\n\nthat the evidence\n\n      satisfies the requirements of Foley, undisturbed by Sali-\n      nas, that the transaction sought to be influenced had\n      some connection with a federal program. Indeed, Salinas\n      may be read to indicate that the “threat to the integrity\n      and proper operation of [a] federal program” created by\n      the corrupt activity is necessary to assure that the\n      statute is not unconstitutionally applied.\n\nId. (quoting Salinas 522 U.S. at 60-61) (citation omitted) (alter-\n\nation in original).\n\n      The court made plain that there was a direct connection be-\n\ntween the bribery and the federally-funded programs and that “this\n\nis not a case where the transactions sought to be influenced con-\n\ncerned one department of a city and the requisite $10,000 of fed-\n\neral funds were received by a totally unrelated department.”                   Id.\n\nat 93-94.

In other words, prohibiting activity that is\n\nunrelated to federal spending or programs cannot be necessary to\n\nexecute the spending power.\n\n     This is not to say that only activity that directly affects\n\nfederal funds may be prohibited.           Salinas made evident that the\n\nspending power can be rendered ineffectual not only where the in-\n\ntegrity of federal funds is compromised, but also where the in-\n\ntegrity of programs funded by those federal dollars is assaulted.\n\nThus, in Salinas the Court found that § 666 did not “extend federal\n\npower beyond its proper bounds,” id. at 61, where the statute was\n\nused to prosecute a state officer who had allowed himself to be\n\nbribed to influence his management of a federally funded program,\n\neven though no federal funds actually were diverted.           In Zwick, the\n\ncourt held that “a highly attenuated implication of a federal in-\n\nterest will suffice for purposes of § 666.”329\n\n\n     329\n         The court provided examples of attenuated connections that would be\nsufficient to allow prosecution under § 666:\n\n           We can conceive of several ways in which the government\n           could prove a federal interest in a § 666 [sic] in light\n           of this threshold. The amount of federal funds could\n           provide the requisite federal implication, even if the\n           purpose of those funds has no explicit relationship to\n           the subject of the bribe. If, for example, in a given\n           year, the greater part of a township's budget came from\n           federal funds, bribery of a township agent for any\n           purpose might be said to implicate federal interests.\n           Absent that situation, the offense conduct would have to\n           somehow implicate a particular substantive federal\n                                                              (continued...)\n\n                                     144\n\f                                        2.\n\n     The government goes far beyond the holding of Salinas and ar-\n\ngues that for a prosecution to be proper under § 666, no rela-\n\ntionship at all is required between federal funds or programs and\n\nlocal corruption.         The government argues that because funds are\n\nfungible, and the receipt of federal funds for any project frees a\n\nstate to spend more funds on other projects, no more is required\n\nfor a prosecution under § 666 than that a local government receive\n\nat least $10,000 in federal funds annually.\n\n     Although this is, strictly speaking, a correct textual inter-\n\npretation of § 666, the statute obviously does not satisfy consti-\n\ntutional requirements when used in this manner; it cannot be neces-\n\nsary and proper to executing the spending power for the government\n\nto prosecute local crimes that have no relationship whatsoever to\n\nfederal funds and programs.\n\n     Any argument that it is “necessary” to protect the spending\n\npower by passing legislation that regulates conduct totally unre-\n\nlated to federal spending is meritless on its face. Accepting this\n\nproposition would allow § 666 to become a general federal police\n\npower statute that criminalizes corruption in all local governments\n\nand private agencies receiving federal funds.\n\n\n     329\n           (...continued)\n              interest, as the Supreme Court found it did in Salinas,\n              where federal funds were being provided to house federal\n              prisoners in local prisons.\n\nZwick, 199 F.3d at 687.\n\n                                        145\n\f      Such a general police power is denied the federal government\n\nby constitutional design, for it is among those powers, reserved to\n\nthe states, that constitute the heart of state sovereignty.330             Fur-\n\nthermore, states have the primary authority to define and enforce\n\ncriminal law,331 United States v.

See McCormack,\n              31 F. Supp. 2d at 186. This result raises significant\n              federalism concerns, turning traditionally local conduct\n              into a matter for federal enforcement involving a\n              substantial extension of federal law enforcement\n              resources.\n\n                                         147\n\feral interest in federally-funded programs with the federal gov-\n\nernment’s generalized interest in everything that occurs within its\n\nborders.\n\n      The government argues that the United States has an interest\n\nin the honesty of all officials, local and federal, and this is as-\n\nsuredly so.    The government has a similar interest in a great many\n\nthings that are, however, beyond its power to regulate directly.\n\nFor example, members of Congress profess sincere interest in a\n\nvariety of problemsSSfrom reducing crime to encouraging the sta-\n\nbility of marriageSSyet Congress has no more power directly to\n\ncriminalize local burglaries than it does to regulate marriage di-\n\nrectly.     In both cases, if the government wishes to pursue its in-\n\nterest, it must do so through targeted spending and conditional\n\ngrants of federal funds.335\n\n      It is this conflation of generalized federal interests with a\n\nfederal interest in a program (i.e., a connection to federal fund-\n\ning) that prompts the government to argue that any generalized in-\n\nterest of the United States suffices to allow federal criminaliza-\n\ntion of local matters, so long as some insignificant amount of fed-\n\neral funds are given to the locality.          Such an analysis turns the\n\naccepted understanding of the Necessary and Proper Clause on its\n\nhead and, in effect, asserts that because Congress may pursue the\n\n\n\n      335\n         For instance, the government may provide funds to put more local police\nofficers on the streets or may reform federal welfare spending in an effort to\ncreate incentives for families to stay together.\n\n                                      148\n\fgeneral welfare through the Spending Clause, all laws that are ne-\n\ncessary and proper to the general welfare must be considered con-\n\nstitutional under the Spending Clause.336           This argument, if fol-\n\nlowed, would overturn the accepted meaning of the Spending and the\n\nGeneral Welfare Clauses that has existed for nearly two centuries.\n\nSee generally 1 TRIBE, supra, § 5-6, at 831-34 (3d ed. 2000).\n\n\n\n                                      3.\n\n       The government argues, alternatively, that if a connection is\n\nrequired between federal funding or programs and the charged cor-\n\nruption, such connection is present in this case.           The federal con-\n\nnection that the government asserts, however, is exceedingly tenu-\n\nous.     The government avers that a federal connection existed be-\n\ntween Lipscomb’s acts of corruption and federal funds because\n\n       Lipscomb voted to seek and disburse federal money on im-\n       provements to Love Field airport. Thus, the federal gov-\n       ernment had an interest in the success of the airport, a\n       center of interstate travel. It is common sense that an\n       airport depends in part for its success on the taxicab\n       service provided for passengers. On the flip side, taxi-\n       cabs depend in part for their success on the viability of\n       airports, which provide fertile ground for fares.\n\n            If merely the airportSSrather than the city as a\n       wholeSSis seen as the analog of the jail in Salinas, that\n       case’s holding must extend to this one. Lipscomb, like\n       the jailer, was partly responsible for managing a feder-\n       ally-funded entity, the airport. The airport in turn\n\n\n       336\n         Using this reasoning, the government could as easily argue that under\nthe Commerce Clause, conduct may be criminalized wherever it is committed by one\nwho participates in interstate commerce, rather than only where there is some\nlink between the conduct and interstate commerce. In fact, this reasoning would\nallow federal police power under numerous clauses of the Constitution.\n\n                                      149\n\f     provided business to, and needed the business of, taxi-\n     cabs (including Richards’ taxicabs) for its successSSjust\n     as the jail had a direct relationship with the welfare of\n     the prisoner who paid the bribes. And just as the pre-\n     ferential treatment given to the prisoner was “a threat\n     to the integrity and proper operation of the federal pro-\n     gram,” Salinas, 522 U.S. at 61, so the preferential\n     treatment of Richards was a threat to the integrity of\n     the airport-funding program.\n\n     The government’s “cabs go to the airport” theory is feeble at\n\nbest.   The government may as well argue that because the United\n\nStates funds medical research at Dallas hospitals, and researchers\n\nsometimes take taxis, especially to airports to fly to conferences,\n\nthere is a sufficient nexus between taxis and federal funds.     Or,\n\nthe government could aver that federal funds go to pay welfare ben-\n\nefits and, because welfare recipients often cannot afford cars,\n\nthey may take taxis to the grocery store to use their food stamps,\n\nand thus federal prosecution of cases of local bribery affecting\n\ntaxi regulations is necessary to protect the spending power.      In\n\nsum, if the government’s posited connection between the federal\n\nfunds and the corruption is sufficient to provide nexus, any con-\n\nnection at all will do.\n\n     The facts of this case reveal no substantial relationship to\n\nfederal funds or programs, whereas in Salinas there were three\n\ndirect connections between federal funds and the corrupt activity.\n\nFirst, the prisoner paying the bribes was a federal prisoner.    Sec-\n\nond, the county jail in which the prisoner was housed had been con-\n\nstructed substantially with federal funds. Third, the prisoner was\n\n\n\n                                150\n\fin the jail as part of a federal program in which the county was\n\npaid per diem for each federal prisoner it housed.\n\n      Here, to the contrary, Richards, who was the person paying the\n\nbribes, had no federal status or connection. Neither the taxis nor\n\nthe city regulation of the taxi industry was funded by federal\n\nfunds in any way.      Finally, there was no federal program relating\n\nto taxi regulation, nor was the integrity of any federally funded\n\nprogram affected by the payment of Lipscomb to vote for certain\n\ntaxi regulations.\n\n      Thus, the connection between federal funds and the prosecuted\n\nactivity here is nothing like the direct connections between feder-\n\nally funded programs and corrupt activity in Salinas.                 It is far\n\nless substantial than even the most attenuated connections that the\n\nThird Circuit imagined might suffice to avoid constitutional ques-\n\ntions in Zwick.337     Under the specific facts of this case, the con\n\n\n      337\n         The “highly attenuated implication of a federal interest” that Zwick\nimagined would provide a “sufficient federal connection” to satisfy the\nrequirements of § 666 was a far less attenuated federal interest than is the one\nthe government asserts here. The Zwick court\n\n            conceive[d] of several ways in which the government\n            could prove a federal interest in § 666 . . . . If, for\n            example, in a given year, the greater part of a\n            township’s budget came from federal funds, bribery of a\n            township agent for any purpose might be said to impli-\n            cate federal interests.    Absent that situation, the\n            offense conduct would have to somehow implicate a par-\n            ticular substantive federal interest, as the Supreme\n            Court found it did in Salinas, where federal funds were\n            being provided to house federal prisoners in local\n            prisons.\n\nZwick, 199 F.3d at 687. The court cited further examples, including Santopietro,\nholding that bribes paid by real estate developers in search of development con-\n                                                              (continued...)\n\n                                      151\n\fnection to federal funds is insufficient, as a matter of law, to\n\nsupport a conclusion that the § 666 prosecution was necessary and\n\nproper to protect federal funding of Love Field or the city\n\ngenerally.338\n\n\n\n                                         4.\n\n      The government alternatively posits that, because the City of\n\nDallas received a sizeable amount of federal funds in real dollars,\n\nit was proper for Lipscomb’s bribery to be federally prosecuted.\n\nThe government points out that in 1998, the city accepted over $56\n\nmillion in federal funds. This, it argues, is a significant amount\n\nthat warrants the federal prosecution of a local official even for\n\n\n      337\n            (...continued)\ntracts with city agencies that were overseeing HUD programs met the federal nexus\nrequirement of § 666. Zwick also cited Frega, in which a district court con-\ncluded that bribery of state judges did not meet the requisite federal interest,\nbut hypothesized that a sufficient federal connection could exist in different\ncircumstances, such as if the state courts received federal funds for the purpose\nof appointing habeas counsel and the bribes paid affected the appointment of par-\nticular habeas counsel. Id. at 687-88.\n\n            Although these indeed are examples of federal connections that are\nsomewhat attenuated, nevertheless the federal interest in each example is plain,\nas is the necessity of protecting it against corruption so that Congress may\nproperly execute its spending power, free of the danger that federally funded\nprograms will be corrupted and perverted. The same cannot be said of Lipscomb’s\nprosecution, for no federal program was, in any way, affected by his corruption.\n      338\n          Moreover, this post hoc argumentSSthat the integrity of federal funding\nat the airport was endangered by Lipscomb’s taxicab corruptionSSwas never charged\nin the indictment or argued to the jury. Instead, the jury instructions merely\nstated:\n\n               It is also not necessary that the $10,000 in federal\n               assistance be directly involved in or traced to the\n               allegedly corrupt acts charged in the Indictment. All\n               that is necessary is that the City of Dallas received in\n               excess of $10,000 from the federal government during a\n               one-year period.\n\n                                         152\n\fmere local corruption.\n\n     The government contends that the receipt of this large amount\n\nof federal money would make the prosecution of Lipscomb pass muster\n\neven under Zwick.   This is plainly incorrect.   Zwick stated that if\n\n“the greater part of a township’s budget came from federal funds,\n\nbribery of a township agent for any purpose might be said to\n\nimplicate federal interests.”     Zwick, 199 F.3d at 687 (emphasis\n\nadded).   The city received over $56 million in 1998SSadmittedly a\n\nsignificant amount.      Because its 1988 budget was $1.6 billion,\n\nhowever, federal funds made up only 3.5% of the City’s budget.\n\n     This is nowhere near the example given in Zwick, where a fed-\n\neral interest could arise if the “greater part of a township’s bud-\n\nget” came from federal funds.     Indeed, if federal funding of as\n\nlittle as 3.5% of a city’s budget allows prosecution of a city of-\n\nficial, then the fact that every state and most cities receive more\n\nthan $10,000 in federal funds each year is alone enough to allow\n\nthe federalization of local corruption cases.        This cannot be\n\nnecessary and proper for executing the spending power.\n\n\n\n                                  5.\n\n     The government further contends that Lipscomb was not just any\n\ncity employee and that as a city councilman he “was one of fifteen\n\npeople responsible for running the City of Dallas.” The government\n\nthen argues that high officials, such as Lipscomb, always should be\n\n\n                                 153\n\fliable for prosecution under § 666, because high officials make de-\n\ncisions on the disposition of both local and federal funds, and\n\ntherefore dishonesty in the disposition of local funds is a proper\n\ncause of worry to the United States.339\n\n            The   government      contends    that    such    prosecution     is\n\nnecessary, because otherwise corrupt officials would be left in\n\nplace to administer federal funds in the same corrupt fashion that\n\nthey administer local matters.              While this argument has some\n\ninitial appeal, it ultimately has no merit.\n\n            First, it seems unlikely that, had the state prosecutor\n\nbeen given the fruits of the Lipscomb investigation, he would have\n\ndeclined to prosecute.       The charges against Lipscomb were serious,\n\nthe evidence was compelling, and Lipscomb was a high-profile public\n\nservantSSall factors that strongly argue for state prosecution.\n\n            Second, even if one thinks that states sometimes do not\n\nprosecute local crimes where federal prosecutors might do so, it\n\ndoes not follow that allowing double prosecution of local crimes\n\nwould deter corruption involving federal funds and programs.                 In-\n\nstead, allowing the double prosecution of local, but not federal,\n\n\n      339\n          Santopietro, 166 F.3d at 94 n.3, also raised this question, but did not\nanswer it:\n\n            We need not consider whether Santopietro’s role as\n            mayorSSthe chief executive officer of the city and hence\n            the officer ultimately responsible for all city depart-\n            mentsSSwould render the statute applicable to corrupt\n            payments received by him for any transaction involving\n            the city, even though the federal funds were received\n            for a program entirely unrelated to the program in\n            connection with which the corrupt payments were made.\n\n                                      154\n\fcorruption might tend to cause dishonest local officials to abuse\n\nfederal dollars rather than local funds.\n\n           Before § 666 was enacted, local embezzlement was covered\n\nby local penalties, and federal embezzlement was covered by federal\n\npenalties, with only small overlap.             Thus, before the advent of\n\n§ 666, a rational local official would simply weigh the rewards of\n\nembezzling local or federal funds against the risk of getting\n\ncaught and the probable penalty carried by each crime.                 He then\n\nwould commit those acts of embezzlement with the best ratio of\n\npayoff-to-punishment.         Because      of   the   severity   of    federal\n\npenalties, the most rational acts of embezzlement often would be\n\nlocal.\n\n           If § 666 is used to prosecute purely local acts of\n\ncorruption, however, this calculus changes substantially.              Federal\n\nacts of corruption still carry the same ratios of reward-to-\n\npunishment, but local crimes of corruption now qualify as both\n\nfederal and local crimes. Thus, federal embezzlement would be more\n\nrewarding at the margins than would be local embezzlement.                As a\n\nresult, rather than protecting federal funds and programs, § 666,\n\nif   applied   to   purely   local   crimes,    should   actually     cause   an\n\nincrease in the criminal misuse of federal funds; accordingly, it\n\ncannot be said that prosecution of local crimes under § 666 is\n\nnecessary and proper to carry into execution the spending power,\n\nand the application of § 666 to Lipscomb on the facts of this case\n\nis, accordingly, unconstitutional.\n\n                                     155\n\f                                     III.\n\n            The panel majority errs in deciding the question of\n\nvenue.      The majority teaches that it is better to force the\n\ngovernment    and      defendant    to   have   a   biased   trial    than   to\n\ninconvenience them with a five-hour drive or a one-hour flight.\n\nBecause this directly contradicts the plain text of our past\n\nprecedents, and all common sense, I respectfully dissent.\n\n            “The trial court has broad discretion in determining\n\nwhether a transfer is warranted.”340 “[A]bsent a showing of illicit\n\nmotivation, the transfer may be granted within the trial court’s\n\ndiscretion unless the defendant shows that a transfer would be\n\nprejudicial.”     Osum, 943 F.2d at 1399. Lipscomb makes two attempts\n\nto show prejudice; both are meritless.              First, Lipscomb asserts\n\nthat if he had been tried in Dallas, he would have had more blacks\n\nin his jury pool, and black jurors would have been more likely to\n\nacquit him, a black defendant.

We repeatedly have held that so long as the district\n\ncourt has some “valid reason for changing venue,” “travel and\n\nlodging expenses for lawyers and witnesses do not constitute\n\nprejudice sufficient to overcome a district court’s determination\n\nregarding the place of trial.”             United States v.

In Kaufmann, we held that a district\n\ncourt’s concern “that if it held trial in Austin, then [its] docket\n\nin Waco would have to be completely ignored” constituted such a\n\nvalid reason and outweighed the “only minor inconvenience” of a 102\n\nmile transfer.      Kaufmann, 858 F.2d at 1006.          If docket management\n\nconstitutes a valid reason for transfer, then surely a court’s\n\nconviction that it cannot provide a fair trial does.\n\n             Directly on point is United States v. Alvarado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389975\"><a href=\"/opinion/389975/united-states-v-joseph-gonzalez-alvarado-jr-rogelio-arenas-ernesto-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. Unit A June 1981).            We affirmed a sua sponte decision\n\nto transfer a case to a venue 231 miles away based on pretrial pub-\n\nlicity.       We   held    that    the     alleged   prejudicial    effects   of\n\n“additional travel and lodging expenses [for the defendants] and\n\ntheir attorneys in addition to the expenses that became necessary\n\nin order to subpoena crucial witnesses . . . do not rise to the\n\nlevel necessary to prove the trial judge abused his discretion by\n\n\n                                         157\n\ftransferring venue so as to avoid an unfair trial from a great deal\n\nof publicity.”     Id. at 539.\n\n            The majority seems to argue that Lipscomb’s case is\n\ndifferent because 300 miles is really far.             But Kaufmann makes no\n\nallowance for distance within a district.              What’s more, Kaufmann\n\nrelies on United States v. Fagan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490132\"><a href=\"/opinion/490132/united-states-v-ralph-g-fagan/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1002</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1008 (5th Cir.\n\n1987), for its holding.         In Fagan, a FED. R. CRIM. P. 21 case, we\n\naffirmed the      refusal to transfer from the Southern District of\n\nTexas to the Eastern District of Louisiana. We noted “that holding\n\ntrial in Houston, rather than Louisiana, made it more disruptive to\n\n[the defendant], his witnesses, and his attorney” and may have cost\n\nhim the representation of a second attorney, but this was not\n\nenough to mandate transfer.         Id. at 1008.     If the 348-mile distance\n\nin Fagan was not prejudicial as a matter of law, then the 300 mile\n\ndistance in this case certainly is not.\n\n            Today’s     holding     has    the   potential    to   inject    great\n\nuncertainty into the trial process and actually to increase the\n\nnumber of unfair trials.       Luckily, future district courts will not\n\nbe bound by it.        The majority’s venue ruling plainly contradicts\n\nAlvarado,   and   it    is   well   established     that     “[w]hen   two   panel\n\nopinions appear in conflict, it is the earlier which controls.”\n\nHarvey v.
