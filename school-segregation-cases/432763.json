Wiencko, Jr., father, assigns four errors in connection with his divorce and\n\n            custody proceedings. He argues (1) the trial court violated his rights under the Equal Protection\n\n            Clause of the United States Constitution when it awarded custody to mother “based primarily upon\n\n            Father’s decision to stay home and raise the children rather than focus on employment,” (2) the\n\n            court abused its discretion “in awarding Father the vast majority of the marital debt, while awarding\n\n            Mother nearly all of the marital assets,” (3) the court abused its discretion “in relying upon the\n\n            report of the Guardian ad Litem, and in eventually accepting wholesale her recommendations as to\n\n            custody and visitation, when the Guardian ad Litem failed to do a thorough investigation and\n\n            submitted said report and recommendation without even meeting with the children which were the\n\n            subject of the custody and visitation dispute,” and (4) the court abused its discretion “in failing to\n\n            prohibit the Mother from all international travel with the children, instead of limiting its prohibition\n\n            to just Japan, because she can get the children to Japan by going through another country.”\n\f                                          BACKGROUND\n\n       Father and mother were married on August 21, 1999. They separated in June of 2011.\n\nMother and father have four boys: the eldest was born in 2000, followed by twins born in 2002, and\n\nfinally the youngest, who was born in 2004.\n\n                                    I. CUSTODY OF THE CHILDREN\n\n       The evidence established that both father and mother were loving parents who were very\n\ndevoted to their children. The court indicated in its finding of facts and conclusions of law that\n\n“[b]oth parents are very concerned about the welfare of their children, and both appear to be\n\nsincerely motivated to do what they each perceive is in the children’s best interests.” At the time of\n\nthe relevant custody hearings, the children were doing very well in school and were actively\n\nengaged in activities such as the Boy Scouts.\n\n       The court heard testimony from mother and father and from several of their friends. Since\n\n2004, father has assumed a greater role in caring for the children, a role that only grew more\n\nsignificant with the loss of his employment in 2009.\n\n       Dr. Bernard J. Lewis prepared a detailed parental capacity evaluation for each parent. He\n\nwrote that mother “presented as a very bright, emotionally sensitive, and psychologically healthy\n\nindividual.” In contrast, Dr. Lewis concluded father’s answers suggested he possesses “certain\n\nnarcissistic quality.” Dr. Lewis further stated in his report that “[t]here is clear and substantial\n\nevidence from the interviews with the boys that [father] has provided them with considerable\n\ninappropriate information which undermines [mother’s] parental authority with the boys and\n\ntheir respect for her as a parent.” Finally, Dr. Lewis’s report stated that father’s “rigid, inflexible\n\nstyle likely results in a ‘one size fits all’ approach to parenting. This was apparent from his\n\ndescriptions of his children and his focus on their intellectual and academic abilities with little\n\nregard to their social or behavioral development.” At trial, Dr. Lewis testified that, during the\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fevaluations, father came across “as very rigid, inflexible, insensitive, and self-centered.” In his\n\nview, father was “just focused on [the children’s] academics . . . and relatively blind to any other\n\nissues or problems with them.” Dr. Lewis formed a “strong opinion that [mother] is the better\n\nparent” with regard to assessing and meeting the emotional, intellectual, and physical needs of\n\nthe children.\n\n       The guardian ad litem recommended that sole legal and physical custody be awarded to\n\nmother. The guardian ad litem\n\n                acknowledge[d] Father’s devotion to his children and his role these\n                past few years as a “stay at home dad.” However, the guardian ad\n                litem strongly believes that this role was not assumed just because\n                of Mother’s career, but because of Father’s inability to obtain\n                employment and/or his unwillingness to compromise on some\n                “must haves” for his desired employment situation.\n\n       Mother, a professional violinist, worked throughout the marriage, teaching music and\n\noccasionally traveling out of town to perform. Father holds a master’s degree in mechanical\n\nengineering. Initially, he worked from home as a consultant to the telecommunications industry.\n\nFor a time, he earned a very comfortable living. For example, in 2004, father earned $197,600.\n\nGradually, the contracts began to diminish. In 2008, he earned $93,689. In 2009, father’s lone\n\nremaining client did not renew his consulting contract, and father has been unemployed since that\n\ntime. He did not seek further employment. Instead, father devoted himself to taking care of the\n\nchildren and the household, becoming, in his own words, “Mr. Mom.” The loss of father’s\n\nsubstantial income after 2009 required him to make significant withdrawals from his retirement\n\naccounts to maintain the household.\n\n       The trial court issued a detailed written opinion analyzing the statutory custody factors\n\nfound in Code § 20-124.3. The court noted that mother “is psychologically best suited to be the\n\nprimary custodian of the children, and she has the present ability to provide an independent\n\nhousehold for the family, whereas the father does not.” In discussing “[t]he role which each parent\n                                                -3-\n\fhas played and will play in the future, in the upbringing and care of the child,” the court specifically\n\nacknowledged father’s extensive role in raising the children, including preparing meals, taking care\n\nof laundry, and running errands, as well as his loving relationship with the children. The court\n\nobserved, however, that father “unilaterally decided to become a stay at home Father” after he lost\n\nhis consulting contract. In addressing the circumstances that led to the dissolution of the marriage,\n\nthe court wrote that\n\n                the catalyst for the final breakup of the marital relationship was the\n                Husband’s loss of employment. In his late 40’s and confronted by\n                the loss of his lucrative employment, the Husband understandably\n                became depressed. Rather than shouldering the burden of seeking\n                new employment, he elected to withdraw into the home and devote\n                himself to his children. This was basically a retreat from reality.\n\n        Later, in the context of discussing the role each parent has played in the upbringing and care\n\nof the children, the court made the following observations:\n\n                As previously noted, after losing his employment in 2009, the\n                Father withdrew from the adult world of employment. His\n                obsession with his children’s intellectual and personal\n                development is a product of his withdrawal from the world of\n                adults. Parenting requires balancing, and the Father has lost his\n                sense of parental perspective with respect to his role as a Father.\n                While he has commendably engaged his children in a wide range\n                of activities designed to develop their intellectual, social, and\n                spiritual life, he has totally abrogated his responsibility to\n                physically provide for his family. He has returned to his childhood\n                and become actively engaged in children’s activities like scouting\n                and recreation. He took them to a variety of amusement parks.\n                These are salutary and commendable activities provided that you\n                have the money to fund them.\n\n                       If granted custody, the Father plans to return to his\n                childhood home in Herndon to live with his mother, thereby\n                completing his retreat from the adult world.\n\nMother, on the other hand, “would remain in the Winchester area to maintain consistency and\n\nroutine in the children’s lives.” The court also found that she “is willing to make adjustments to\n\nher work schedule to be more available for her children.”\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f        The court ordered joint legal and physical custody with primary physical custody going\n\nto mother. The court further established a detailed visitation schedule for father that included the\n\nfirst, third, and fifth weekends of every month, as well as weekday evening visitation on\n\nTuesdays and Thursdays and summer visitation for up to six weeks.\n\n        Father objected to the custody award. He filed a motion to reconsider in which he argued\n\nthat “the Court violated his 14th Amendment right to Equal Protection under the Constitution\n\nwhen it granted custody of the children to the mother on the basis that he left his job to be a stay-\n\nat-home dad and raise the children.” The court denied the motion to reconsider.\n\n                                     II. EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION\n\n        The principal marital assets consisted of a home with an outstanding note of approximately\n\n$400,000 and little to no equity, a violin bow, several automobiles and household furnishings, and\n\nretirement accounts from mother’s employers with a marital share worth approximately $68,000.\n\nFather had largely depleted the marital share of his retirement accounts and little was left in those\n\naccounts. Father still had over $270,000 in retirement accounts that were his separate property.\n\nCredit cards in father’s name had an outstanding balance of approximately $37,000.\n\n        The court wrote a memorandum opinion in which it thoroughly reviewed the evidence and\n\naddressed each of the Code § 20-107.3 factors. Among other things, the court acknowledged\n\nfather’s significant financial contributions to the marriage, including father’s contribution of\n\n$40,000 of his separate property to satisfy a judgment against mother and his contribution of\n\n$200,000 of father’s separate property toward the purchase of the home. The court also made note\n\nof the fact that, at a time when mother was embroiled in litigation, he purchased mother’s violin\n\nbow at a cost of $16,000 and later gave it to her so as to insulate that asset from bankruptcy.\n\n        The court awarded the marital home to father and the bow to mother. With regard to credit\n\ncard debt, the trial court held that “[t]he parties will pay the credit cards in their individual names\n\n                                                   -5-\n\fwithout contribution from the other spouse.” As to marital retirement accounts, the court provided\n\nas follows in a section of its opinion titled “Pension and Retirement Plans”:\n\n                        Each party shall retain their respective pension and retirement\n                plans free of the interest of the other party. There does not appear to\n                be any marital portion remaining in the SEP IRA; however, to the\n                extent that there is, that shall go to the Husband.\n\n                        The Husband has substantial separate property, his retirement\n                accounts greatly exceed those of the Wife, and he is receiving the\n                marital residence, whatever it may be worth.\n\n                         III. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE GUARDIAN AD LITEM\n\n        Father and mother requested the appointment of a guardian ad litem. The court appointed\n\nKaren M. Holman, who had served as the guardian ad litem for the oldest child in the context of\n\nfather’s ultimately unsuccessful effort to obtain a protective order on behalf of all four children\n\nagainst mother.1 Holman had interviewed the children during the course of her investigation\n\nconcerning application for the protective order. She did not, however, interview the children anew\n\nfor purposes of the child custody litigation. Father objected to the court relying on the report of the\n\nguardian ad litem, arguing that she was biased and had not conducted a thorough investigation.\n\n        Dr. Lewis interviewed the children and discussed his findings with Holman. Holman found\n\nthat the information Lewis gleaned from his interviews with the children was essentially the same as\n\nwhat Holman had learned from her previous interviews with the children. In addition to Dr. Lewis,\n\nHolman spoke with father and mother, the maternal grandparents, the paternal grandmother, and\n\ncounsel for both parties. Holman also spoke with a former neighbor of father and mother, and she\n\nreviewed discovery responses and documents, videos, and other materials provided to her by the\n\n\n\n        1\n         Father has contended that mother abused the oldest of the children. The record\nestablishes that when one of the children obstreperously refused to go to his room, mother\ndragged him to his room by his feet. The child suffered a bruise when his head struck a door.\nChild Protective Services investigated the matter but did not file any charges or take further\naction. Mother acknowledged the inappropriateness of her actions.\n                                               -6-\n\fparties. Holman later issued a second report containing a final recommendation for the court. Her\n\ninvoice reflects that she spent nearly 42 hours on the case.\n\n                                      IV. TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS\n\n        Mother originally is from Japan. She arrived in the United States in 1991 to study music.\n\nShe obtained an undergraduate degree from the University of Wyoming, followed by a master’s\n\ndegree from the Cleveland Institute of Music. Mother and father have visited Japan on an annual\n\nbasis to allow the children to see their maternal grandparents. Mother’s current employment is in\n\nthe United States. Since coming to the United States, she has not returned full time to Japan and has\n\nno plans to do so. She testified that she recognizes that the children love their father and “value\n\nwhat [he] has to offer.” She said she does not want to stop the relationship the children have with\n\ntheir father. The children were raised entirely in the United States. Mother denied that she has any\n\nintention to take the children to Japan permanently. In March of 2008, she became a citizen of the\n\nUnited States while, according to father, retaining her Japanese citizenship.\n\n        Throughout the litigation, father has been gravely concerned about the possibility that\n\nmother might permanently return to Japan with the children. His fear is grounded in the fact that\n\nJapan has not signed multilateral treaties such as the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects\n\nof Child Abduction. According to father, he would effectively have no recourse were mother to\n\npermanently return to Japan and take the children with her. For her part, mother asked the court to\n\nallow her to travel to Japan, where her parents and other family reside. The final divorce decree\n\nprovides that “Mother may not take the children to Japan without the Father’s written consent or\n\na court order approving the trip.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                             ANALYSIS\n\n            I. THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT VIOLATE FATHER’S EQUAL PROTECTION RIGHTS.\n\n        Father does not challenge the facial constitutionality of Virginia’s child custody statutes.\n\nInstead, he raises an “as applied” challenge, contending that awarding custody to mother rather than\n\nto him violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause. He argues that the trial court based its\n\ncustody decision “on the biased, archaic and stereotypical view that men are supposed to provide for\n\nthe family financially and have no place in the household with children.” Appellant’s Br. at 27.\n\n        The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution provides in relevant part that “no state\n\nshall make or enforce any law which shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\n\nprotection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. “Absent clear evidence to the contrary in\n\nthe record, the judgment of a trial court comes to us on appeal with a presumption that the law\n\nwas correctly applied to the facts.” Yarborough v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 971, 978, 234\n\nS.E.2d 286, 291 (1977). To succeed on an “as applied” challenge, where a litigant does not\n\nchallenge the validity of a legislative classification, but, rather, claims that a court has violated\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause in a particular divorce case by discriminating on the basis of sex, the\n\nlitigant must make an unambiguous showing that the trial court’s decision was grounded in\n\ninvidious discrimination on the basis of sex. McCreery v. McCreery, 218 Va. 352, 237 S.E.2d\n\n167 (1977). See also Mandell v. Haddon, 202 Va. 979, 992, 121 S.E.2d 516, 526 (1961) (noting\n\nthe purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to protect against invidious discrimination).\n\n        A number of cases from Virginia and other states have examined arguments similar to\n\nthose made by father. Most relevant is the McCreery decision from the Supreme Court. In that\n\ncase, the Court rejected the mother’s claim that she had been “treat[ed] differently from the\n\nfather on the basis of her employment.” 218 Va. at 356, 237 S.E.2d at 169. After examining the\n\nrecord, the Supreme Court concluded that\n\n                                                  -8-\n\f               [t]he chancellor did not divide working parents into separate\n               classes according to sex. Nor did he base his decision upon a\n               finding that mothers are not proper custodians unless they are\n               full-time housewives. Rather, comparing the quality of custodial\n               care offered by two working parents, he decided that the effect of\n               Mrs. McCreery’s employment on her “habits and behavior”, i.e.,\n               her preoccupation with “the glamour of her work” and “her\n               relationship with her supervisor”, was such that “the interests of\n               the two children in this case would be best served” by awarding the\n               children the custodial care of a working father who “is willing to\n               place the welfare of these children above all else, to a much greater\n               extent than the mother”.\n\nId. at 357, 237 S.E.2d at 170. The Court held that the custody determination was not the product\n\nof “invidious discrimination.” Id. See also Lawrence v. Lawrence, 628 P.2d 542, 543 (Wyo.\n\n1981) (rejecting father’s claim that the custody determination was made on the “improper and\n\nillegal assumption that custody” should be awarded to the mother because this argument\n\n“completely disregards the other findings of fact made by the court which reflect consideration\n\ngiven by it to all aspects of the relationship in an effort to make the award which would be in the\n\nbest interests of the child”); Burroughs v. Burroughs, 239 S.E.2d 357, 358 (Ga. 1977) (“The\n\nrecord shows that the trial judge awarded custody to the husband because this would be in the\n\nchildren’s best interests, not because the wife was career-minded.”).\n\n       We have little difficulty in concluding that the trial court did not violate the Equal\n\nProtection Clause in granting custody of the children to mother rather than to father. The record\n\ndemonstrates that the trial court carefully analyzed all the statutory factors in Code § 20-124.3\n\nand reached a decision based on the entirety of the evidence. The statements father singles out\n\ndo not reflect the breadth of the trial court’s opinion. The trial court had before it the report of\n\nDr. Lewis, the recommendation of the guardian ad litem, and other evidence, all of it pointing\n\nclearly in the direction of giving primary or sole custody to mother. Certainly, the trial court\n\nmade plain that it viewed negatively father’s decision to abandon a once thriving career in favor\n\nof devoting himself exclusively to the children. This was not, however, a situation involving a\n                                                 -9-\n\ffather who by mutual consent sacrificed a career in favor of assuming a caretaker role. Rather,\n\nin the context of all the evidence, the court noted the negative impact of father’s assumption of a\n\nprovider role followed by a unilateral decision on his part to abandon that provider role to stay at\n\nhome with the children.\n\n       Father urges us to compare the outcome in this case with an unreported decision by the\n\nsame trial judge in which the court commended the mother for sacrificing her career for the sake\n\nof her family. We decline father’s invitation to engage in this exercise. Divorce cases involve\n\nsuch widely varying factual situations, and the statutory standard governing the adjudication of\n\nthese cases is so broad and flexible, that, unlike, for example, the employment context, making\n\nsuch case-to-case comparisons would serve no useful purpose in determining the validity of an\n\nequal protection claim.\n\n       The record reflects that the trial court carefully weighed the evidence and based its\n\ndecision on the individual facts of the case and the factors listed in the statute. Father has fallen\n\nfar short of making an unambiguous showing that the trial court made its custody determination\n\nbased on invidious discrimination.\n\nII. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONSIDERING FATHER’S SEPARATE PROPERTY RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS\n              IN AWARDING MOTHER THE TOTALITY OF THE MARITAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.\n\n       Father does not challenge the trial court’s classification of property. He does, however, raise\n\na number of arguments in connection with the court’s equitable distribution of marital property. On\n\nappeal, a trial court’s equitable distribution award will not be overturned unless the Court finds “an\n\nabuse of discretion, misapplication or wrongful application of the equitable distribution statute, or\n\nlack of evidence to support the award.” McIlwain v. McIlwain, 52 Va. App. 644, 661, 666 S.E.2d\n\n538, 547 (2008).\n\n       Retirement accounts in mother’s name constituted one of the principal marital assets. The\n\nmarital share of these accounts was worth approximately $68,000. In a section of the trial court’s\n                                                 - 10 -\n\ffindings of fact and conclusions of law captioned “Pension and Retirement Plans,” the court held as\n\nfollows:\n\n                        Each party shall retain their respective pension and retirement\n                plans free of the interest of the other party. There does not appear to\n                be any marital portion remaining in the SEP IRA; however, to the\n                extent that there is, that shall go to the Husband.\n\n                        The Husband has substantial separate property, his\n                retirement accounts greatly exceed those of the Wife, and he is\n                receiving the marital residence, whatever it may be worth.\n\n(Emphasis added). Plainly, the existence of father’s separate property retirement accounts\n\ninfluenced the court’s decision to award the marital property retirement accounts entirely to mother.\n\nFather argues that it was error for the trial court to award mother the retirement accounts, which\n\nconstituted marital property, based, at least in part, on the fact that father had retirement accounts\n\nthat were his separate property. We agree with father.\n\n        We first turn to the text of the statute. At the outset, Code § 20-107.3(A) directs the court to\n\nclassify property and to segregate marital property from separate property. Code § 20-107.3(E) then\n\nprovides a list of factors that govern the equitable distribution of marital property and the\n\napportionment of marital debt. Significantly, the General Assembly did not list the value of\n\nseparate property as an equitable distribution factor. In contrast, the General Assembly has directed\n\ntrial courts to consider the availability of all financial resources, including separate property, in\n\nfashioning a spousal support award or when varying from the presumptive child support\n\nguidelines. See Code §§ 20-107.1(E)(1) (in determining spousal support, trial court to consider,\n\namong other things, parties’ “financial resources . . . of whatever nature”), 20-108.1(B)(10) (in\n\ndetermining whether to vary child support from the presumptive guidelines, trial courts should\n\nconsider the “financial resources . . . of each parent”). Had the General Assembly intended to\n\ninclude all property, rather than just marital property, in the equitable distribution calculus, it\n\nwould have done so in Code § 20-107.3(E).\n                                                 - 11 -\n\f       Taking separate property into account would not only import into Code § 20-107.3 a\n\nfactor the General Assembly chose not to include, it also would be inconsistent with the purpose\n\nof the equitable distribution statute. The General Assembly was well aware of the problems\n\nassociated with the regime that existed before equitable distribution, where spouses received\n\nproperty based chiefly on title and the needs of the divorced spouse were provided for through\n\nspousal support awards. Report of the Joint Subcommittee Studying Section 20-107 of the Code of\n\nVirginia To the Governor and The General Assembly of Virginia, House Doc. No. 21, 1982\n\nSession, at 4. In enacting the equitable distribution statute, the General Assembly sought to\n\n               recognize marriage as a partnership to which each party contributes,\n               albeit not always equally, to the well-being of the family unit. These\n               contributions, both monetary and nonmonetary, have value and\n               should be weighed, along with other factors, in allocating marital\n               assets or their dollar equivalent between the parties when they are\n               divorced or their marriage is dissolved.\n\nReport of the Joint Subcommittee Studying Section 20-107 of the Code of Virginia To the Governor\n\nand The General Assembly of Virginia, House Doc. No. 21, 1982 Session, at 7. See also Sawyer v.\n\nSawyer, 1 Va. App. 75, 78, 335 S.E.2d 277, 279 (1985) (“The legislature enacted Code § 20-107.3\n\nto give the courts power to compensate a spouse for his or her contribution to the acquisition of\n\nproperty obtained during the marriage without regard to title when the marriage is dissolved.”\n\n(emphasis added)).\n\n       The purpose of equitable distribution differs from the purpose animating an award of\n\nspousal and child support. This Court has recognized that\n\n               support and equitable distribution awards are based on entirely\n               different considerations and serve entirely different purposes.\n               Court ordered support is intended to place the burden on a spouse\n               or parent to maintain his or her family rather than placing that\n               burden on the state. Furthermore, the amount of support is based\n               on current needs of the spouse and/or children and the ability of the\n               other spouse/parent to pay from current assets. The “equitable\n               distribution” statute, however, is intended to recognize a marriage\n               as a partnership and to provide a means to divide equitably the\n                                                - 12 -\n\f                 wealth accumulated during and by that partnership based on the\n                 monetary and non-monetary contributions of each spouse.\n\nWilliams v. Williams, 4 Va. App. 19, 24, 354 S.E.2d 64, 66 (1987).\n\n        We hold that the value of separate property is irrelevant to the equitable distribution\n\nanalysis.2 Whether a divorcing spouse commands vast resources of separate property, or,\n\nconversely, possesses little or no separate property, is a circumstance external to the marriage and to\n\nthe accumulation of wealth during the marriage. The trial court’s decision to award mother the\n\nmarital property retirement accounts based in part on the existence of father’s separate property\n\nretirement accounts constitutes a misapplication of the equitable distribution statute. Consequently,\n\nwe reverse and remand the equitable distribution award for further proceedings not inconsistent with\n\nthis opinion.3\n\n       III. THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY CONSIDERED THE REPORT OF THE GUARDIAN AD LITEM.\n\n        Father next argues that the trial court committed an abuse of discretion in relying on the\n\nreport of the guardian ad litem. He contends that the guardian ad litem failed to conduct a thorough\n\ninvestigation and, in particular, failed to meet with the children who were the object of the custody\n\nand visitation dispute. We agree with mother that this issue should be reviewed under an abuse of\n\n\n\n\n        2\n         Of course, past contributions of separate property made for the benefit of the household\nduring the marriage must be considered in making the equitable distribution. Code\n§ 20-107.3(E)(2).\n        3\n         Father also argues that the trial court, in contravention of our holding in Reid v. Reid, 7\nVa. App. 553, 565, 375 S.E.2d 533, 540 (1989), improperly considered his earning capacity in\nmaking the equitable distribution award. The record does not support this contention. The court\nreferenced father’s unilateral decision to stay at home and abandon the workforce as one of the\ncircumstances that led to the dissolution of the marriage. In contrast to Reid, the trial court here\ndid not base its equitable distribution award on father’s earning capacity. Father also argues that\nthe court abused its discretion in awarding most of the marital assets to mother while awarding\nmost of the debt to father. He stresses the value of his own contributions, monetary and\nnon-monetary, to the marriage. In light of our remand, we do not address this argument.\n\n                                                 - 13 -\n\fdiscretion standard. This standard affords the trial court appropriate flexibility in determining to\n\nwhat extent it should rely on the recommendation of the guardian ad litem.\n\n        The guardian ad litem serves a vital role in our judicial system. The task of the guardian ad\n\nlitem is to rise above the fray of the contending parties to ensure that the interests of persons under a\n\nlegal disability are “represented and protected.” Code § 8.01-9(A). See also Rule 8:6 (the role of\n\nthe guardian ad litem for a child is to “vigorously represent the child, fully protecting the child’s\n\ninterest and welfare”). Although the Supreme Court has held that a trial court should consider the\n\nrecommendation of the guardian ad litem, see Bottoms v. Bottoms, 249 Va. 410, 420, 457 S.E.2d\n\n102, 108 (1995), that holding presupposes that the report prepared by the guardian ad litem rests on\n\nan adequate investigative foundation.\n\n        It is true, as father notes, that the guardian ad litem did not interview the children in\n\nconnection with the divorce case. Standard A of The Standards to Govern the Performance of\n\nGuardians ad litem for Children specifies that “in fulfilling the duties of a Guardian ad Litem . . ., an\n\nattorney shall [m]eet face-to-face and interview the child.”4 Significantly, however, Holman\n\npreviously served as the guardian ad litem for the oldest child in connection with a protective order\n\nsought by father approximately seven months prior to her appointment as guardian ad litem for all\n\nfour children in the divorce proceeding. It is undisputed that Holman previously had interviewed\n\nthe children. Father correctly observes that the purpose of a protective order differs from the\n\npurpose of a divorce case. Still, the facts gleaned in the earlier litigation were relevant in the\n\ndivorce proceeding and would have gone a long way towards educating the guardian ad litem about\n\nthe dynamics of this family.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n         The standards are available at:\nhttp://www.courts.state.va.us/courtadmin/aoc/cip/programs/gal/children/gal_performance_standa\nrds_children.pdf\n                                             - 14 -\n\f        Moreover, Dr. Lewis, who was hired in the context of the divorce case to prepare a parental\n\nassessment, interviewed the children. Holman and Dr. Lewis compared notes. In addition, Holman\n\nspoke with father and mother, the maternal grandparents, the paternal grandmother, and the\n\nattorneys for father and mother. Holman interviewed a former neighbor of father and mother, and\n\nshe reviewed discovery responses and documents, videos, and other materials provided to her by the\n\nparties. Based on these facts, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the report and\n\nrecommendation of the guardian ad litem and in attributing to it whatever weight the court deemed\n\nappropriate.5\n\n        In so concluding, we do not downplay the importance of the standards that govern guardians\n\nad litem. Nevertheless, it would be foolish to reflexively reverse every time a guardian ad litem\n\ndoes not follow these standards to the letter or because an investigation could have been more\n\nthorough. First, guardians ad litem must adapt the depth of their investigation to the unique facts of\n\neach case. Second, the fact that the cost of the guardian ad litem’s investigation must be borne by\n\nthe parties in a divorce – parties who often are under financial strain – counsels against compelling a\n\nguardian ad litem to exhaust every conceivable avenue of investigation. Finally, the abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard, which governs our decision here, means that\n\n                a reviewing court [must] show enough deference to a primary\n                decisionmaker’s judgment that the court does not reverse merely\n                because it would have come to a different result in the first instance.\n                Accordingly, when a decision is discretionary, the court has a range\n                of choice, and its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays\n                within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\n\nLawlor v. Commonwealth, 285 Va. 187, 212-13, 738 S.E.2d 847, 861 (2013) (citation and internal\n\npunctuation omitted).\n\n\n        5\n         Father also complains about the failure of the guardian ad litem to “ascertain the\nveracity of allegations that [mother] savagely beat one of the children.” Appellant’s Br. at 41.\nDue to Holman’s service as guardian ad litem for the oldest child in connection with father’s\nunsuccessful attempt to obtain a protective order, she was well aware of the facts of that incident.\n                                               - 15 -\n\f        Finally, the record does not support father’s assertion that the trial court accepted\n\n“wholesale” the recommendations of the guardian ad litem. The guardian ad litem recommended\n\nthat mother have sole legal and physical custody of the children, whereas the court provided for\n\njoint legal and physical custody, with primary physical custody to mother. In addition, the court\n\nprovided a more generous visitation schedule for father than what the guardian ad litem had\n\nrecommended.\n\n                 IV. THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION WITH REGARD\n                        TO THE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON MOTHER.\n\n        The trial court forbade mother from traveling to Japan with the children. The court did not\n\nforbid mother to travel to other countries with the children. Father argues that the trial court\n\n“abused its discretion when it failed to prohibit the Mother from all international travel with the\n\nchildren.” Appellant’s Br. at 46. He fears that mother could travel with the children to another\n\ncountry, and from there take the children to Japan. Father highlights the fact that Japan is not a\n\nsignatory of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.\n\nTherefore, he is concerned that he would be without any remedy should mother take the children\n\nthere permanently.\n\n        Code § 20-107.2 provides that “[u]pon entry of a decree providing . . . for a divorce . . .\n\nthe court may make such further decree as it shall deem expedient concerning the custody or\n\nvisitation and support of the minor children of the parties as provided in Chapter 6.1 . . . .” Such\n\nfurther decree may include travel restrictions placed upon the parent who seeks custody or\n\nvisitation. We afford the trial court broad discretion in these matters. Brown v. Brown, 30\n\nVa. App. 532, 538, 518 S.E.2d 336, 338 (1999). “[A]s long as evidence in the record supports\n\nthe trial court’s ruling and the trial court has not abused its discretion, its ruling must be affirmed\n\non appeal.” Id. The paramount consideration for the court remains the best interest of the\n\nchildren. Code § 20-124.2.\n                                                 - 16 -\n\f        We find no abuse of discretion on these facts. First, the record does not support father’s\n\napprehension that mother might whisk the children away to Japan and permanently settle there.\n\nThe evidence establishes that mother has every intention to remain in the United States for the\n\nlong term. Mother has resided in the United States since 1991. Her career has been and remains\n\nin the United States. She has become a United States citizen. Mother testified that she has no\n\nplans to permanently move to Japan, and she recognizes the importance of the role father plays\n\nin the children’s lives. Her trial testimony was corroborated by Dr. Lewis’s report. He noted\n\nthat mother “repeatedly stated that she understood the boys love their father, are close to their\n\nfather, and need their father in their lives.” Second, to address the risk, however remote, that\n\nmother might take the children to Japan and never return, the trial court, over mother’s objection,\n\nprohibited her from taking the children to Japan without approval from father or authorization\n\nfrom the court. The court struck a perfectly sensible balance on the facts presented. We find no\n\nerror with regard to the travel restrictions imposed on mother.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n        We reverse the judgment of the court with respect to the equitable distribution award and\n\nwe remand for a new equitable distribution hearing. In all other respects, the judgment of the\n\ntrial court is affirmed.\n\n                                                  Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 17 -\n\f",

Wiencko, Jr., father, assigns four errors in connection with his divorce and\n\n            custody proceedings. He argues (1) the trial court violated his rights under the Equal Protection\n\n            Clause of the United States Constitution when it awarded custody to mother “based primarily upon\n\n            Father’s decision to stay home and raise the children rather than focus on employment,” (2) the\n\n            court abused its discretion “in awarding Father the vast majority of the marital debt, while awarding\n\n            Mother nearly all of the marital assets,” (3) the court abused its discretion “in relying upon the\n\n            report of the Guardian ad Litem, and in eventually accepting wholesale her recommendations as to\n\n            custody and visitation, when the Guardian ad Litem failed to do a thorough investigation and\n\n            submitted said report and recommendation without even meeting with the children which were the\n\n            subject of the custody and visitation dispute,” and (4) the court abused its discretion “in failing to\n\n            prohibit the Mother from all international travel with the children, instead of limiting its prohibition\n\n            to just Japan, because she can get the children to Japan by going through another country.”\n\f                                          BACKGROUND\n\n       Father and mother were married on August 21, 1999. They separated in June of 2011.\n\nMother and father have four boys: the eldest was born in 2000, followed by twins born in 2002, and\n\nfinally the youngest, who was born in 2004.\n\n                                    I. CUSTODY OF THE CHILDREN\n\n       The evidence established that both father and mother were loving parents who were very\n\ndevoted to their children. The court indicated in its finding of facts and conclusions of law that\n\n“[b]oth parents are very concerned about the welfare of their children, and both appear to be\n\nsincerely motivated to do what they each perceive is in the children’s best interests.” At the time of\n\nthe relevant custody hearings, the children were doing very well in school and were actively\n\nengaged in activities such as the Boy Scouts.\n\n       The court heard testimony from mother and father and from several of their friends. Since\n\n2004, father has assumed a greater role in caring for the children, a role that only grew more\n\nsignificant with the loss of his employment in 2009.\n\n       Dr. Bernard J. Lewis prepared a detailed parental capacity evaluation for each parent. He\n\nwrote that mother “presented as a very bright, emotionally sensitive, and psychologically healthy\n\nindividual.” In contrast, Dr. Lewis concluded father’s answers suggested he possesses “certain\n\nnarcissistic quality.” Dr. Lewis further stated in his report that “[t]here is clear and substantial\n\nevidence from the interviews with the boys that [father] has provided them with considerable\n\ninappropriate information which undermines [mother’s] parental authority with the boys and\n\ntheir respect for her as a parent.” Finally, Dr. Lewis’s report stated that father’s “rigid, inflexible\n\nstyle likely results in a ‘one size fits all’ approach to parenting. This was apparent from his\n\ndescriptions of his children and his focus on their intellectual and academic abilities with little\n\nregard to their social or behavioral development.” At trial, Dr. Lewis testified that, during the\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fevaluations, father came across “as very rigid, inflexible, insensitive, and self-centered.” In his\n\nview, father was “just focused on [the children’s] academics . . . and relatively blind to any other\n\nissues or problems with them.” Dr. Lewis formed a “strong opinion that [mother] is the better\n\nparent” with regard to assessing and meeting the emotional, intellectual, and physical needs of\n\nthe children.\n\n       The guardian ad litem recommended that sole legal and physical custody be awarded to\n\nmother. The guardian ad litem\n\n                acknowledge[d] Father’s devotion to his children and his role these\n                past few years as a “stay at home dad.” However, the guardian ad\n                litem strongly believes that this role was not assumed just because\n                of Mother’s career, but because of Father’s inability to obtain\n                employment and/or his unwillingness to compromise on some\n                “must haves” for his desired employment situation.\n\n       Mother, a professional violinist, worked throughout the marriage, teaching music and\n\noccasionally traveling out of town to perform. Father holds a master’s degree in mechanical\n\nengineering. Initially, he worked from home as a consultant to the telecommunications industry.\n\nFor a time, he earned a very comfortable living. For example, in 2004, father earned $197,600.\n\nGradually, the contracts began to diminish. In 2008, he earned $93,689. In 2009, father’s lone\n\nremaining client did not renew his consulting contract, and father has been unemployed since that\n\ntime. He did not seek further employment. Instead, father devoted himself to taking care of the\n\nchildren and the household, becoming, in his own words, “Mr. Mom.” The loss of father’s\n\nsubstantial income after 2009 required him to make significant withdrawals from his retirement\n\naccounts to maintain the household.\n\n       The trial court issued a detailed written opinion analyzing the statutory custody factors\n\nfound in Code § 20-124.3. The court noted that mother “is psychologically best suited to be the\n\nprimary custodian of the children, and she has the present ability to provide an independent\n\nhousehold for the family, whereas the father does not.” In discussing “[t]he role which each parent\n                                                -3-\n\fhas played and will play in the future, in the upbringing and care of the child,” the court specifically\n\nacknowledged father’s extensive role in raising the children, including preparing meals, taking care\n\nof laundry, and running errands, as well as his loving relationship with the children. The court\n\nobserved, however, that father “unilaterally decided to become a stay at home Father” after he lost\n\nhis consulting contract. In addressing the circumstances that led to the dissolution of the marriage,\n\nthe court wrote that\n\n                the catalyst for the final breakup of the marital relationship was the\n                Husband’s loss of employment. In his late 40’s and confronted by\n                the loss of his lucrative employment, the Husband understandably\n                became depressed. Rather than shouldering the burden of seeking\n                new employment, he elected to withdraw into the home and devote\n                himself to his children. This was basically a retreat from reality.\n\n        Later, in the context of discussing the role each parent has played in the upbringing and care\n\nof the children, the court made the following observations:\n\n                As previously noted, after losing his employment in 2009, the\n                Father withdrew from the adult world of employment. His\n                obsession with his children’s intellectual and personal\n                development is a product of his withdrawal from the world of\n                adults. Parenting requires balancing, and the Father has lost his\n                sense of parental perspective with respect to his role as a Father.\n                While he has commendably engaged his children in a wide range\n                of activities designed to develop their intellectual, social, and\n                spiritual life, he has totally abrogated his responsibility to\n                physically provide for his family. He has returned to his childhood\n                and become actively engaged in children’s activities like scouting\n                and recreation. He took them to a variety of amusement parks.\n                These are salutary and commendable activities provided that you\n                have the money to fund them.\n\n                       If granted custody, the Father plans to return to his\n                childhood home in Herndon to live with his mother, thereby\n                completing his retreat from the adult world.\n\nMother, on the other hand, “would remain in the Winchester area to maintain consistency and\n\nroutine in the children’s lives.” The court also found that she “is willing to make adjustments to\n\nher work schedule to be more available for her children.”\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f        The court ordered joint legal and physical custody with primary physical custody going\n\nto mother. The court further established a detailed visitation schedule for father that included the\n\nfirst, third, and fifth weekends of every month, as well as weekday evening visitation on\n\nTuesdays and Thursdays and summer visitation for up to six weeks.\n\n        Father objected to the custody award. He filed a motion to reconsider in which he argued\n\nthat “the Court violated his 14th Amendment right to Equal Protection under the Constitution\n\nwhen it granted custody of the children to the mother on the basis that he left his job to be a stay-\n\nat-home dad and raise the children.” The court denied the motion to reconsider.\n\n                                     II. EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION\n\n        The principal marital assets consisted of a home with an outstanding note of approximately\n\n$400,000 and little to no equity, a violin bow, several automobiles and household furnishings, and\n\nretirement accounts from mother’s employers with a marital share worth approximately $68,000.\n\nFather had largely depleted the marital share of his retirement accounts and little was left in those\n\naccounts. Father still had over $270,000 in retirement accounts that were his separate property.\n\nCredit cards in father’s name had an outstanding balance of approximately $37,000.\n\n        The court wrote a memorandum opinion in which it thoroughly reviewed the evidence and\n\naddressed each of the Code § 20-107.3 factors. Among other things, the court acknowledged\n\nfather’s significant financial contributions to the marriage, including father’s contribution of\n\n$40,000 of his separate property to satisfy a judgment against mother and his contribution of\n\n$200,000 of father’s separate property toward the purchase of the home. The court also made note\n\nof the fact that, at a time when mother was embroiled in litigation, he purchased mother’s violin\n\nbow at a cost of $16,000 and later gave it to her so as to insulate that asset from bankruptcy.\n\n        The court awarded the marital home to father and the bow to mother. With regard to credit\n\ncard debt, the trial court held that “[t]he parties will pay the credit cards in their individual names\n\n                                                   -5-\n\fwithout contribution from the other spouse.” As to marital retirement accounts, the court provided\n\nas follows in a section of its opinion titled “Pension and Retirement Plans”:\n\n                        Each party shall retain their respective pension and retirement\n                plans free of the interest of the other party. There does not appear to\n                be any marital portion remaining in the SEP IRA; however, to the\n                extent that there is, that shall go to the Husband.\n\n                        The Husband has substantial separate property, his retirement\n                accounts greatly exceed those of the Wife, and he is receiving the\n                marital residence, whatever it may be worth.\n\n                         III. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE GUARDIAN AD LITEM\n\n        Father and mother requested the appointment of a guardian ad litem. The court appointed\n\nKaren M. Holman, who had served as the guardian ad litem for the oldest child in the context of\n\nfather’s ultimately unsuccessful effort to obtain a protective order on behalf of all four children\n\nagainst mother.1 Holman had interviewed the children during the course of her investigation\n\nconcerning application for the protective order. She did not, however, interview the children anew\n\nfor purposes of the child custody litigation. Father objected to the court relying on the report of the\n\nguardian ad litem, arguing that she was biased and had not conducted a thorough investigation.\n\n        Dr. Lewis interviewed the children and discussed his findings with Holman. Holman found\n\nthat the information Lewis gleaned from his interviews with the children was essentially the same as\n\nwhat Holman had learned from her previous interviews with the children. In addition to Dr. Lewis,\n\nHolman spoke with father and mother, the maternal grandparents, the paternal grandmother, and\n\ncounsel for both parties. Holman also spoke with a former neighbor of father and mother, and she\n\nreviewed discovery responses and documents, videos, and other materials provided to her by the\n\n\n\n        1\n         Father has contended that mother abused the oldest of the children. The record\nestablishes that when one of the children obstreperously refused to go to his room, mother\ndragged him to his room by his feet. The child suffered a bruise when his head struck a door.\nChild Protective Services investigated the matter but did not file any charges or take further\naction. Mother acknowledged the inappropriateness of her actions.\n                                               -6-\n\fparties. Holman later issued a second report containing a final recommendation for the court. Her\n\ninvoice reflects that she spent nearly 42 hours on the case.\n\n                                      IV. TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS\n\n        Mother originally is from Japan. She arrived in the United States in 1991 to study music.\n\nShe obtained an undergraduate degree from the University of Wyoming, followed by a master’s\n\ndegree from the Cleveland Institute of Music. Mother and father have visited Japan on an annual\n\nbasis to allow the children to see their maternal grandparents. Mother’s current employment is in\n\nthe United States. Since coming to the United States, she has not returned full time to Japan and has\n\nno plans to do so. She testified that she recognizes that the children love their father and “value\n\nwhat [he] has to offer.” She said she does not want to stop the relationship the children have with\n\ntheir father. The children were raised entirely in the United States. Mother denied that she has any\n\nintention to take the children to Japan permanently. In March of 2008, she became a citizen of the\n\nUnited States while, according to father, retaining her Japanese citizenship.\n\n        Throughout the litigation, father has been gravely concerned about the possibility that\n\nmother might permanently return to Japan with the children. His fear is grounded in the fact that\n\nJapan has not signed multilateral treaties such as the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects\n\nof Child Abduction. According to father, he would effectively have no recourse were mother to\n\npermanently return to Japan and take the children with her. For her part, mother asked the court to\n\nallow her to travel to Japan, where her parents and other family reside. The final divorce decree\n\nprovides that “Mother may not take the children to Japan without the Father’s written consent or\n\na court order approving the trip.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                             ANALYSIS\n\n            I. THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT VIOLATE FATHER’S EQUAL PROTECTION RIGHTS.\n\n        Father does not challenge the facial constitutionality of Virginia’s child custody statutes.\n\nInstead, he raises an “as applied” challenge, contending that awarding custody to mother rather than\n\nto him violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause. He argues that the trial court based its\n\ncustody decision “on the biased, archaic and stereotypical view that men are supposed to provide for\n\nthe family financially and have no place in the household with children.” Appellant’s Br. at 27.\n\n        The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution provides in relevant part that “no state\n\nshall make or enforce any law which shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\n\nprotection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. “Absent clear evidence to the contrary in\n\nthe record, the judgment of a trial court comes to us on appeal with a presumption that the law\n\nwas correctly applied to the facts.” Yarborough v.

To succeed on an “as applied” challenge, where a litigant does not\n\nchallenge the validity of a legislative classification, but, rather, claims that a court has violated\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause in a particular divorce case by discriminating on the basis of sex, the\n\nlitigant must make an unambiguous showing that the trial court’s decision was grounded in\n\ninvidious discrimination on the basis of sex.

Most relevant is the McCreery decision from the Supreme Court. In that\n\ncase, the Court rejected the mother’s claim that she had been “treat[ed] differently from the\n\nfather on the basis of her employment.” 218 Va. at 356, 237 S.E.2d at 169. After examining the\n\nrecord, the Supreme Court concluded that\n\n                                                  -8-\n\f               [t]he chancellor did not divide working parents into separate\n               classes according to sex.

Rather, comparing the quality of custodial\n               care offered by two working parents, he decided that the effect of\n               Mrs. McCreery’s employment on her “habits and behavior”, i.e.,\n               her preoccupation with “the glamour of her work” and “her\n               relationship with her supervisor”, was such that “the interests of\n               the two children in this case would be best served” by awarding the\n               children the custodial care of a working father who “is willing to\n               place the welfare of these children above all else, to a much greater\n               extent than the mother”.\n\nId. at 357, 237 S.E.2d at 170. The Court held that the custody determination was not the product\n\nof “invidious discrimination.” Id. See also Lawrence v.

The record\n\ndemonstrates that the trial court carefully analyzed all the statutory factors in Code § 20-124.3\n\nand reached a decision based on the entirety of the evidence. The statements father singles out\n\ndo not reflect the breadth of the trial court’s opinion. The trial court had before it the report of\n\nDr. Lewis, the recommendation of the guardian ad litem, and other evidence, all of it pointing\n\nclearly in the direction of giving primary or sole custody to mother. Certainly, the trial court\n\nmade plain that it viewed negatively father’s decision to abandon a once thriving career in favor\n\nof devoting himself exclusively to the children. This was not, however, a situation involving a\n                                                 -9-\n\ffather who by mutual consent sacrificed a career in favor of assuming a caretaker role. Rather,\n\nin the context of all the evidence, the court noted the negative impact of father’s assumption of a\n\nprovider role followed by a unilateral decision on his part to abandon that provider role to stay at\n\nhome with the children.\n\n       Father urges us to compare the outcome in this case with an unreported decision by the\n\nsame trial judge in which the court commended the mother for sacrificing her career for the sake\n\nof her family. We decline father’s invitation to engage in this exercise. Divorce cases involve\n\nsuch widely varying factual situations, and the statutory standard governing the adjudication of\n\nthese cases is so broad and flexible, that, unlike, for example, the employment context, making\n\nsuch case-to-case comparisons would serve no useful purpose in determining the validity of an\n\nequal protection claim.\n\n       The record reflects that the trial court carefully weighed the evidence and based its\n\ndecision on the individual facts of the case and the factors listed in the statute. Father has fallen\n\nfar short of making an unambiguous showing that the trial court made its custody determination\n\nbased on invidious discrimination.\n\nII. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONSIDERING FATHER’S SEPARATE PROPERTY RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS\n              IN AWARDING MOTHER THE TOTALITY OF THE MARITAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.\n\n       Father does not challenge the trial court’s classification of property. He does, however, raise\n\na number of arguments in connection with the court’s equitable distribution of marital property. On\n\nappeal, a trial court’s equitable distribution award will not be overturned unless the Court finds “an\n\nabuse of discretion, misapplication or wrongful application of the equitable distribution statute, or\n\nlack of evidence to support the award.” McIlwain v.

The\n\nmarital share of these accounts was worth approximately $68,000. In a section of the trial court’s\n                                                 - 10 -\n\ffindings of fact and conclusions of law captioned “Pension and Retirement Plans,” the court held as\n\nfollows:\n\n                        Each party shall retain their respective pension and retirement\n                plans free of the interest of the other party.

Plainly, the existence of father’s separate property retirement accounts\n\ninfluenced the court’s decision to award the marital property retirement accounts entirely to mother.\n\nFather argues that it was error for the trial court to award mother the retirement accounts, which\n\nconstituted marital property, based, at least in part, on the fact that father had retirement accounts\n\nthat were his separate property. We agree with father.\n\n        We first turn to the text of the statute. At the outset, Code § 20-107.3(A) directs the court to\n\nclassify property and to segregate marital property from separate property. Code § 20-107.3(E) then\n\nprovides a list of factors that govern the equitable distribution of marital property and the\n\napportionment of marital debt. Significantly, the General Assembly did not list the value of\n\nseparate property as an equitable distribution factor. In contrast, the General Assembly has directed\n\ntrial courts to consider the availability of all financial resources, including separate property, in\n\nfashioning a spousal support award or when varying from the presumptive child support\n\nguidelines. See Code §§ 20-107.1(E)(1) (in determining spousal support, trial court to consider,\n\namong other things, parties’ “financial resources . . . of whatever nature”), 20-108.1(B)(10) (in\n\ndetermining whether to vary child support from the presumptive guidelines, trial courts should\n\nconsider the “financial resources . . . of each parent”). Had the General Assembly intended to\n\ninclude all property, rather than just marital property, in the equitable distribution calculus, it\n\nwould have done so in Code § 20-107.3(E).\n                                                 - 11 -\n\f       Taking separate property into account would not only import into Code § 20-107.3 a\n\nfactor the General Assembly chose not to include, it also would be inconsistent with the purpose\n\nof the equitable distribution statute. The General Assembly was well aware of the problems\n\nassociated with the regime that existed before equitable distribution, where spouses received\n\nproperty based chiefly on title and the needs of the divorced spouse were provided for through\n\nspousal support awards. Report of the Joint Subcommittee Studying Section 20-107 of the Code of\n\nVirginia To the Governor and The General Assembly of Virginia, House Doc. No. 21, 1982\n\nSession, at 4. In enacting the equitable distribution statute, the General Assembly sought to\n\n               recognize marriage as a partnership to which each party contributes,\n               albeit not always equally, to the well-being of the family unit. These\n               contributions, both monetary and nonmonetary, have value and\n               should be weighed, along with other factors, in allocating marital\n               assets or their dollar equivalent between the parties when they are\n               divorced or their marriage is dissolved.\n\nReport of the Joint Subcommittee Studying Section 20-107 of the Code of Virginia To the Governor\n\nand The General Assembly of Virginia, House Doc.

This Court has recognized that\n\n               support and equitable distribution awards are based on entirely\n               different considerations and serve entirely different purposes.\n               Court ordered support is intended to place the burden on a spouse\n               or parent to maintain his or her family rather than placing that\n               burden on the state.

App.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1206296\"><a href=\"/opinion/1206296/williams-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 (1987).\n\n        We hold that the value of separate property is irrelevant to the equitable distribution\n\nanalysis.2 Whether a divorcing spouse commands vast resources of separate property, or,\n\nconversely, possesses little or no separate property, is a circumstance external to the marriage and to\n\nthe accumulation of wealth during the marriage. The trial court’s decision to award mother the\n\nmarital property retirement accounts based in part on the existence of father’s separate property\n\nretirement accounts constitutes a misapplication of the equitable distribution statute. Consequently,\n\nwe reverse and remand the equitable distribution award for further proceedings not inconsistent with\n\nthis opinion.3\n\n       III. THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY CONSIDERED THE REPORT OF THE GUARDIAN AD LITEM.\n\n        Father next argues that the trial court committed an abuse of discretion in relying on the\n\nreport of the guardian ad litem. He contends that the guardian ad litem failed to conduct a thorough\n\ninvestigation and, in particular, failed to meet with the children who were the object of the custody\n\nand visitation dispute. We agree with mother that this issue should be reviewed under an abuse of\n\n\n\n\n        2\n         Of course, past contributions of separate property made for the benefit of the household\nduring the marriage must be considered in making the equitable distribution. Code\n§ 20-107.3(E)(2).\n        3\n         Father also argues that the trial court, in contravention of our holding in Reid v. Reid, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Va. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 565, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1259352\"><a href=\"/opinion/1259352/reid-v-reid/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540 (1989), improperly considered his earning capacity in\nmaking the equitable distribution award. The record does not support this contention. The court\nreferenced father’s unilateral decision to stay at home and abandon the workforce as one of the\ncircumstances that led to the dissolution of the marriage. In contrast to Reid, the trial court here\ndid not base its equitable distribution award on father’s earning capacity. Father also argues that\nthe court abused its discretion in awarding most of the marital assets to mother while awarding\nmost of the debt to father. He stresses the value of his own contributions, monetary and\nnon-monetary, to the marriage. In light of our remand, we do not address this argument.\n\n                                                 - 13 -\n\fdiscretion standard. This standard affords the trial court appropriate flexibility in determining to\n\nwhat extent it should rely on the recommendation of the guardian ad litem.\n\n        The guardian ad litem serves a vital role in our judicial system. The task of the guardian ad\n\nlitem is to rise above the fray of the contending parties to ensure that the interests of persons under a\n\nlegal disability are “represented and protected.” Code § 8.01-9(A). See also Rule 8:6 (the role of\n\nthe guardian ad litem for a child is to “vigorously represent the child, fully protecting the child’s\n\ninterest and welfare”). Although the Supreme Court has held that a trial court should consider the\n\nrecommendation of the guardian ad litem, see Bottoms v. Bottoms, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 420, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1395108\"><a href=\"/opinion/1395108/bottoms-v-bottoms/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108 (1995), that holding presupposes that the report prepared by the guardian ad litem rests on\n\nan adequate investigative foundation.\n\n        It is true, as father notes, that the guardian ad litem did not interview the children in\n\nconnection with the divorce case. Standard A of The Standards to Govern the Performance of\n\nGuardians ad litem for Children specifies that “in fulfilling the duties of a Guardian ad Litem . . ., an\n\nattorney shall [m]eet face-to-face and interview the child.”4 Significantly, however, Holman\n\npreviously served as the guardian ad litem for the oldest child in connection with a protective order\n\nsought by father approximately seven months prior to her appointment as guardian ad litem for all\n\nfour children in the divorce proceeding. It is undisputed that Holman previously had interviewed\n\nthe children. Father correctly observes that the purpose of a protective order differs from the\n\npurpose of a divorce case. Still, the facts gleaned in the earlier litigation were relevant in the\n\ndivorce proceeding and would have gone a long way towards educating the guardian ad litem about\n\nthe dynamics of this family.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n         The standards are available at:\nhttp://www.courts.state.va.us/courtadmin/aoc/cip/programs/gal/children/gal_performance_standa\nrds_children.pdf\n                                             - 14 -\n\f        Moreover, Dr. Lewis, who was hired in the context of the divorce case to prepare a parental\n\nassessment, interviewed the children. Holman and Dr. Lewis compared notes. In addition, Holman\n\nspoke with father and mother, the maternal grandparents, the paternal grandmother, and the\n\nattorneys for father and mother. Holman interviewed a former neighbor of father and mother, and\n\nshe reviewed discovery responses and documents, videos, and other materials provided to her by the\n\nparties. Based on these facts, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the report and\n\nrecommendation of the guardian ad litem and in attributing to it whatever weight the court deemed\n\nappropriate.5\n\n        In so concluding, we do not downplay the importance of the standards that govern guardians\n\nad litem. Nevertheless, it would be foolish to reflexively reverse every time a guardian ad litem\n\ndoes not follow these standards to the letter or because an investigation could have been more\n\nthorough. First, guardians ad litem must adapt the depth of their investigation to the unique facts of\n\neach case. Second, the fact that the cost of the guardian ad litem’s investigation must be borne by\n\nthe parties in a divorce – parties who often are under financial strain – counsels against compelling a\n\nguardian ad litem to exhaust every conceivable avenue of investigation. Finally, the abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard, which governs our decision here, means that\n\n                a reviewing court [must] show enough deference to a primary\n                decisionmaker’s judgment that the court does not reverse merely\n                because it would have come to a different result in the first instance.\n                Accordingly, when a decision is discretionary, the court has a range\n                of choice, and its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays\n                within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\n\nLawlor v. Commonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212-13, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 861 (2013) (citation and internal\n\npunctuation omitted).\n\n\n        5\n         Father also complains about the failure of the guardian ad litem to “ascertain the\nveracity of allegations that [mother] savagely beat one of the children.” Appellant’s Br. at 41.\nDue to Holman’s service as guardian ad litem for the oldest child in connection with father’s\nunsuccessful attempt to obtain a protective order, she was well aware of the facts of that incident.\n                                               - 15 -\n\f        Finally, the record does not support father’s assertion that the trial court accepted\n\n“wholesale” the recommendations of the guardian ad litem. The guardian ad litem recommended\n\nthat mother have sole legal and physical custody of the children, whereas the court provided for\n\njoint legal and physical custody, with primary physical custody to mother. In addition, the court\n\nprovided a more generous visitation schedule for father than what the guardian ad litem had\n\nrecommended.\n\n                 IV. THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION WITH REGARD\n                        TO THE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON MOTHER.\n\n        The trial court forbade mother from traveling to Japan with the children. The court did not\n\nforbid mother to travel to other countries with the children. Father argues that the trial court\n\n“abused its discretion when it failed to prohibit the Mother from all international travel with the\n\nchildren.” Appellant’s Br. at 46. He fears that mother could travel with the children to another\n\ncountry, and from there take the children to Japan. Father highlights the fact that Japan is not a\n\nsignatory of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.\n\nTherefore, he is concerned that he would be without any remedy should mother take the children\n\nthere permanently.\n\n        Code § 20-107.2 provides that “[u]pon entry of a decree providing . . . for a divorce . . .\n\nthe court may make such further decree as it shall deem expedient concerning the custody or\n\nvisitation and support of the minor children of the parties as provided in Chapter 6.1 . . . .” Such\n\nfurther decree may include travel restrictions placed upon the parent who seeks custody or\n\nvisitation. We afford the trial court broad discretion in these matters. Brown v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1066157\"><a href=\"/opinion/1066157/brown-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Va. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1066157\"><a href=\"/opinion/1066157/brown-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 338 (1999). “[A]s long as evidence in the record supports\n\nthe trial court’s ruling and the trial court has not abused its discretion, its ruling must be affirmed\n\non appeal.” Id. The paramount consideration for the court remains the best interest of the\n\nchildren. Code § 20-124.2.\n                                                 - 16 -\n\f        We find no abuse of discretion on these facts. First, the record does not support father’s\n\napprehension that mother might whisk the children away to Japan and permanently settle there.\n\nThe evidence establishes that mother has every intention to remain in the United States for the\n\nlong term. Mother has resided in the United States since 1991. Her career has been and remains\n\nin the United States. She has become a United States citizen. Mother testified that she has no\n\nplans to permanently move to Japan, and she recognizes the importance of the role father plays\n\nin the children’s lives. Her trial testimony was corroborated by Dr. Lewis’s report. He noted\n\nthat mother “repeatedly stated that she understood the boys love their father, are close to their\n\nfather, and need their father in their lives.” Second, to address the risk, however remote, that\n\nmother might take the children to Japan and never return, the trial court, over mother’s objection,\n\nprohibited her from taking the children to Japan without approval from father or authorization\n\nfrom the court. The court struck a perfectly sensible balance on the facts presented. We find no\n\nerror with regard to the travel restrictions imposed on mother.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n        We reverse the judgment of the court with respect to the equitable distribution award and\n\nwe remand for a new equitable distribution hearing. In all other respects, the judgment of the\n\ntrial court is affirmed.\n\n                                                  Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 17 -\n\f</pre>",
