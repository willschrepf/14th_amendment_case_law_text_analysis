Because of this bussing requirement, an Executive Order of the Governor of Mississippi, September 11, 1971, was issued withholding appropriated funds from the school district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Executive Order was issued withholding funds, the school board moved--and the District Court granted the motion--that the state officials involved in the Executive Order be made party-defendants and that they be enjoined from carrying out the Executive Order, 332 F.Supp. at 985.  The state officials, and not the school board,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> are the only appellants here.  We find no merit in the state's appeal and affirm the District Court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute on which the Governor's Executive Order relied is &#167; 6336--04 of the Mississippi Code of 1942, providing that pupils who live within the corporate limits of a municipality and who are assigned to a school in the municipality shall not be considered as eligible for school transportation.  Concluding that the intra-city bussing portion of the integration plan was in direct conflict with &#167; 6336--04, the Governor issued the Order to withhold state funds from the school district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court, however, found it unnecessary to deal with the conflict between the state statute and the adopted integration plan since upon extensive factual hearings the Court determined that the school board had not spent and did not contemplate spending any funds derived from state sources on intra-city transportation.  The District Judge was clearly right.  The school district produced overwhelming evidence that the bussing was and will be provided for from accumulated reserves and a separate transportation account funded solely by local income.  And the Court properly held that expenditure of funds derived from sources other than the minimum education (state funds) was committed to the discretion of the school board.  See also &#167; 6411--10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the District Court found that state funds were not being used for intra-city bussing, the Court was not compelled to decide the constitutionality of the state statute.  The District Court's order, then, merely enjoined the state from interferring with the school board's use of non-state derived funds to pay for intra-city bussing--a necessary part of the agreed District Court's plan in fashioning a decree to desegregate the school system.  Such a transportation scheme in the desegregation of schools has been approved by the Supreme Court when students are required to attend schools outside their neighborhoods.  Swann v.

Further, the record fully supports a conclusion that the transportation feature of the plan was arrived at through considerable discussion.  Consequently, we reject the State's subsidiary contention that the District Judge was in error in concluding that transportation was essential to achieving unitary status and its related alternative argument that the bussing should be less.  We agree with the District Court's assessment, 332 F.Supp. at 987, and find no merit in the argument.
