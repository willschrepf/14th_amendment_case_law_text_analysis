injuries in a collision that occurred\r\nwhile he was riding as a passenger in a company vehicle.<span>  </span>Hertz fired Barousse the day he returned from\r\nmedical leave for those injuries, and Barousse sued Hertz under section\r\n451.001(1) of the Texas Labor Code, contending that it terminated his employment\r\nin retaliation for filing the worker’s compensation claim.<span>

class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>We\r\nhold that legally and factually sufficient evidence supports the trial court’s\r\nfinding that Hertz violated the Texas workers’ compensation

discretion in excluding evidence of\r\nBarousse’s personal injury settlement.<span>  </span>We\r\ntherefore vacate the award of punitive damages and affirm the remainder of the\r\njudgment.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Background<p></p></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Barousse, an eighteen-year employee\r\nof Hertz, held the position of region sales director for the central\r\nregion.<span>  </span>While out on a sales call on\r\nSeptember 13, 2006, Barousse sustained serious back injuries after a truck ran\r\ninto the company-owned vehicle in which he was riding.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Barousse initially paid his medical\r\nexpenses out-of-pocket because he knew that the company did not want worker’s\r\ncompensation claims on its records.<span>  </span>After\r\ntrying to work for a few weeks, Barousse found that the injuries prevented him\r\nfrom continuing as before.<span>  </span>On October 2,\r\n2006, he filed a claim for workers’ compensation and took a month’s leave of\r\nabsence.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>At that time, Joe Newman had been the\r\nregion sales manager and Barousse’s immediate supervisor for approximately\r\nthree months.<span>  </span>In Barousse’s absence,\r\nNewman, with the assistance of region human resources manager Regina\r\nRichardson, prepared memoranda to Barousse on October 10 and October 31.<span>  </span>The first, entitled “Unsatisfactory Job\r\nPerformance and 90-day Action Plan,” itemized tasks that he felt required\r\nimmediate improvement and warned Barousse that he would “be reevaluated on your\r\nperformance every 30 days for the next 90 days[,]” warning that, “[i]f the\r\nresults of your reevaluation do not show significant improvement, your\r\nemployment with [Hertz] will be terminated.” <span> </span>In the second memo, entitled “Unsatisfactory\r\nPerformance,” Newman listed Barousse’s failure to meet numerous job\r\nresponsibilities and goals, including monthly goals. <span> </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Shortly after Barousse returned\r\nfrom medical leave, Newman met with him about his annual performance appraisal.<span>  </span>Newman gave Barousse—who had previously\r\nreceived average reviews from his prior supervisor—the lowest possible rating\r\nof “unsatisfactory,” meaning that his performance was unacceptable. <span> </span>The following week, Newman gave Barousse a\r\nwritten warning for unsatisfactory job performance, listing “several serious\r\nperformance transgressions.”<span>  </span>Like the\r\nfirst October memo, this memo warned that Barousse’s “[f]ailure to show\r\nconsistent improvement with the issues listed and improve your performance will\r\nresult in further disciplinary action, up to and including termination.”<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>By\r\nNovember 29, Barousse determined that he could not perform his usual job duties\r\nwithout experiencing intense pain and went back on workers’ compensation\r\nleave.<span>  </span>This time, Barousse remained on\r\nleave for several months.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>Meanwhile,\r\nHertz began an effort to restructure its work force.<span>  </span>Mark Alewel, the regional vice president, led\r\nthe Houston regional office in devising a plan.<span> \r\n</span>By February 2007, Hertz management had identified Barousse as a\r\ncandidate for layoff. <span> </span>Alewel also slated\r\nthe region sales director position in the Dallas office, held by Kevin Smith, for\r\nelimination.<span>  </span>As soon as the layoff plans\r\nwere finalized in March, Alewel informed Smith that his position had been eliminated\r\nand offered Smith another position within the company, which he accepted.<span>  </span>Three other region sales directors remained\r\nin their positions, and two years later, when their positions also were\r\neliminated, they were offered and accepted other jobs with Hertz.<span>  </span>Alewel and Newman consulted with human\r\nresources about the timing of Barousse’s layoff and decided to wait to\r\nimplement the decision when Barousse received a medical release and returned\r\nfrom leave.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>In late September 2007, Barousse contacted\r\nHertz human resources and informed Richardson that he was released to return to\r\nwork as of October 1, 2007.<span>  </span>Richardson\r\nasked Barousse to come to the office immediately.<span>  </span>With Newman present, Richardson informed\r\nBarousse that the company had eliminated his job and that he was being laid\r\noff.<span>  </span>Barousse received a severance\r\npacket offering him enhanced severance pay in exchange for a release of\r\nclaims.<span>  </span>Barousse declined to sign the\r\nrelease and filed this suit.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>     </span>In\r\nits final judgment, the trial court ordered Hertz to pay Barousse “compensatory\r\ndamages in the sum of $665,000.00 and exemplary damages of $100,000,” with\r\nprejudgment interest on the $54,477.25 attributable to past damages.<span>  </span>Relevant to this appeal, the trial court\r\nentered the following findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its\r\njudgment:<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\"><span><span>·<span>       \r\n</span></span></span><span>Barousse was discouraged from filing a valid workers’ compensation claim.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p

the course and scope of his employment\r\nas regional vice president, made the decision to terminate Mr. Barousse.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>       \r\n</span></span></span><span>The other four region sales directors were employees similarly situated\r\nto Barousse.<span>  </span>Each of these similarly\r\nsituated employees were offered alternate employment within Hertz at the time\r\nthey were advised that their positions had been eliminated. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>       \r\n</span></span></span><span>Barousse was not offered alternate employment at the time he was advised\r\nhis position was eliminated.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>       \r\n</span></span></span><span>Hertz discharged Barousse because he filed a worker’s compensation claim\r\nin good faith, in violation of section 451.001 of the Texas Labor Code.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\"><span><span>·<span>       \r\n</span></span></span><span>Hertz acted with malice and gross negligence, causing harm to Barousse.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>Hertz\r\nfiled a request for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law,\r\ncontending that the trial court omitted essential findings to show that the\r\ndecisionmakers evinced a specific intent to harm Barousse, namely: (1) that Barousse\r\nwas physically able to perform the duties of region sales director at the time\r\nof his discharge; (2) that any alternate jobs paying comparable salaries and\r\nbenefits were available at the time of Barousse’s discharge; (3) relating to\r\nthe nature, duration, and severity of Barousse’s mental anguish; and (4) to\r\nsupport the punitive damages award. <span> </span>The\r\ntrial court denied Hertz’s request, and this appeal followed.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"

employee\r\nof Hertz, held the position of region sales director for the central\r\nregion.<span>  </span>While out on a sales call on\r\nSeptember 13, 2006, Barousse sustained serious back injuries after a truck ran\r\ninto the company-owned vehicle in which he was riding.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Barousse initially paid his medical\r\nexpenses out-of-pocket because he knew that the company did not want worker’s\r\ncompensation claims on its records.<span>  </span>After\r\ntrying to work for a few weeks, Barousse found that the injuries prevented him\r\nfrom continuing as before.<span>  </span>On October 2,\r\n2006, he filed a claim for workers’ compensation and took a month’s leave of\r\nabsence.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>At that time, Joe Newman had been the\r\nregion sales manager and Barousse’s immediate supervisor for approximately\r\nthree months.<span>  </span>In Barousse’s absence,\r\nNewman, with the assistance of region human resources manager Regina\r\nRichardson, prepared memoranda to Barousse on October 10 and October 31.<span>  </span>The first, entitled “Unsatisfactory Job\r\nPerformance and 90-day Action Plan,” itemized tasks that he felt required\r\nimmediate improvement and warned Barousse that he would “be reevaluated on your\r\nperformance every 30 days for the next 90 days[,]” warning that, “[i]f the\r\nresults of your reevaluation do not show significant improvement, your\r\nemployment with [Hertz] will be terminated.” <span> </span>In the second memo, entitled “Unsatisfactory\r\nPerformance,” Newman listed Barousse’s failure to meet numerous job\r\nresponsibilities and goals, including monthly goals. <span> </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Shortly after Barousse returned\r\nfrom medical leave, Newman met with him about his annual performance appraisal.<span>  </span>Newman gave Barousse—who had previously\r\nreceived average reviews from his prior supervisor—the lowest possible rating\r\nof “unsatisfactory,” meaning that his performance was unacceptable. <span> </span>The following week, Newman gave Barousse a\r\nwritten warning for unsatisfactory job performance, listing “several serious\r\nperformance transgressions.”<span>  </span>Like the\r\nfirst October memo, this memo warned that Barousse’s “[f]ailure to show\r\nconsistent improvement with the issues listed and improve your performance will\r\nresult in further disciplinary action, up to and including termination.”<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>By\r\nNovember 29, Barousse determined that he could not perform his usual job duties\r\nwithout experiencing intense pain and went back on workers’ compensation\r\nleave.<span>  </span>This time, Barousse remained on\r\nleave for several months.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>Meanwhile,\r\nHertz began an effort to restructure its work force.<span>  </span>Mark Alewel, the regional vice president, led\r\nthe Houston regional office in devising a plan.<span> \r\n</span>By February 2007, Hertz management had identified Barousse as a\r\ncandidate for layoff. <span> </span>Alewel also slated\r\nthe region sales director position in the Dallas office, held by Kevin Smith, for\r\nelimination.<span>  </span>As soon as the layoff plans\r\nwere finalized in March, Alewel informed Smith that his position had been eliminated\r\nand offered Smith another position within the company, which he accepted.<span>  </span>Three other region sales directors remained\r\nin their positions, and two years later, when their positions also were\r\neliminated, they were offered and accepted other jobs with Hertz.<span>  </span>Alewel and Newman consulted with human\r\nresources about the timing of Barousse’s layoff and decided to wait to\r\nimplement the decision when Barousse received a medical release and returned\r\nfrom leave.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>In late September 2007, Barousse contacted\r\nHertz human resources and informed Richardson that he was released to return to\r\nwork as of October 1, 2007.<span>  </span>Richardson\r\nasked Barousse to come to the office immediately.<span>  </span>With Newman present, Richardson informed\r\nBarousse that the company had eliminated his job and that he was being laid\r\noff.<span>  </span>Barousse received a severance\r\npacket offering him enhanced severance pay in exchange for a release of\r\nclaims.<span>  </span>Barousse declined to sign the\r\nrelease and filed this suit.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>     </span>In\r\nits final judgment, the trial court ordered Hertz to pay Barousse “compensatory\r\ndamages in the sum of $665,000.00 and exemplary damages of $100,000,” with\r\nprejudgment interest on the $54,477.25 attributable to past damages.<span>  </span>Relevant to this appeal, the trial court\r\nentered the following findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its\r\njudgment:<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\"><span><span>·<span>       \r\n</span></span></span><span>Barousse was discouraged from filing a valid workers’ compensation claim.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>       \r\n</span></span></span><span>Mark Alewel, while acting within the course and scope of his employment\r\nas regional vice president, made the decision to terminate Mr. Barousse.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>       \r\n</span></span></span><span>The other four region sales directors were employees similarly situated\r\nto Barousse.<span>  </span>Each of these similarly\r\nsituated employees were offered alternate employment within Hertz at the time\r\nthey were advised that their positions had been eliminated. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>       \r\n</span></span></span><span>Barousse was not offered alternate employment at the time he was advised\r\nhis position was eliminated.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>       \r\n</span></span></span><span>Hertz discharged Barousse because he filed a worker’s compensation claim\r\nin good faith, in violation of section 451.001 of the Texas Labor Code.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\"><span><span>·<span>       \r\n</span></span></span><span>Hertz acted with malice and gross negligence, causing harm to Barousse.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>Hertz\r\nfiled a request for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law,\r\ncontending that the trial court omitted essential findings to show that the\r\ndecisionmakers evinced a specific intent to harm Barousse, namely: (1) that Barousse\r\nwas physically able to perform the duties of region sales director at the time\r\nof his discharge; (2) that any alternate jobs paying comparable salaries and\r\nbenefits were available at the time of Barousse’s discharge; (3) relating to\r\nthe nature, duration, and severity of Barousse’s mental anguish; and (4) to\r\nsupport the punitive damages award. <span> </span>The\r\ntrial court denied Hertz’s request, and this appeal followed.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"
