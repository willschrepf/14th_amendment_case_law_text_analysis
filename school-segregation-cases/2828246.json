J.A.\nCroson further highlights the disagreement that is at issue in this case. I\ncited the Croson case to further bolster the Second Circuit’s conclusion\n                                                                                Furthermore, there is no support for the proposition that\nin Nelson that, in the context of jury selection, both inclusion and          race may be used as a factor in jury selection.

Thus, I cited Croson       U.S. at 87 (“A person’s race simply is unrelated to his fitness\nto explain that in co ntexts other than jury selection, benefits and          as a juror.”) (citation omitted). The record does not reveal\ndetrim ents based on race are examined under the E qual Pro tection Clause    any “neutral explanation,” unrelated to race, that justifies the\nunder the same standard.

When the “evil\nthought” is, as in this case, transformed into words and\nactions, however, “[n]either precedent nor policy supports”\nturning a blind eye to the unconstitutional conduct.\n   It is the dialogue between an attorney and a potential juror\nthat leads an attorney to accept or reject a juror. An\nexamination of that dialogue may also “support or refute an\ninference of discriminatory purpose” on the part of the\nattorney. Batson, 476 U.S. at 97. In this case, defense\ncounsel stated, “you’ve seen the panel, correct?” After\nChandler responded, “yes,” defense counsel stated, “so it’s\nimportant if we can get some minority representation on the\npanel if you’re chosen as a juror. You do understand the way\nwe feel?” J.A. at 518. The exchange between defense\ncounsel and Chandler reveals defense counsel’s “evil\nthoughts.” When defense counsel included Chandler, by\nfailing to challenge her despite her views on the drug\nsentencing laws and her unwillingness to serve, he pursued a\nspecific course of action in furtherance of his “evil thought,”\nand thus became an “evil doer.” The majority’s focus on the\naffirmative act of exercising a peremptory challenge to the\nexclusion of the affirmative act of speaking and the negative\nact of deciding not to challenge a juror, when those acts\nreveal unconstitutional conduct, is unacceptable.\n\f",

Angel never attempted to undo that\nconduct, he offered no assistance to the authorities, and he\nwent to trial to challenge the essential factual elements of\nguilt.

Neither the majority nor the\ngovernment has cited anything in our jurisprudence that                         The majority offers “virtually no support for the conclusion\nallows counsel to cloak one constitutional violation in the                   that [race] alone is an accurate predictor of juror's attitudes;”\ngarb of another constitutional protection.                                    yet it holds that “the same stereotypes that justified the\n                                                                              wholesale exclusion of [racial minorities] from juries” may be\n  The majority finds “nothing unreasonable in defense                         used to outweigh the negative aspects of choosing a particular\ncounsel’s presumed belief that having at least one racial                     juror. J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 139. I can not hold, as does the\n                                                                              majority, that a juror’s race may outweigh the other potential\n                                                                              negative aspects of that juror. Such a finding feeds into the\n    7                                                                         very stereotypes that Batson and its progeny try to combat.\n      The majority’s attempt to distinguish City of Richmond v. J.A.\nCroson further highlights the disagreement that is at issue in this case. I\ncited the Croson case to further bolster the Second Circuit’s conclusion\n                                                                                Furthermore, there is no support for the proposition that\nin Nelson that, in the context of jury selection, both inclusion and          race may be used as a factor in jury selection. Batson, 476\nexclusion can violate the Equal Protection Clause. Thus, I cited Croson       U.S. at 87 (“A person’s race simply is unrelated to his fitness\nto explain that in co ntexts other than jury selection, benefits and          as a juror.”) (citation omitted). The record does not reveal\ndetrim ents based on race are examined under the E qual Pro tection Clause    any “neutral explanation,” unrelated to race, that justifies the\nunder the same standard. The majority seeks to distinguish Croson by\nstating that there was an affirmative discriminatory act in that case,\n                                                                              choice of Chandler. Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 (explaining that\nimposing the set-aside requirement upon prime contractors, and that such      once the defendant has made a prima facie case, the State\nan affirmative discriminatory act does not exist in this case.

Moreover, because a reasonable\nthe majority’s recitation of the facts in Croson does nothing to undermine    defense attorney with a client, like Angel, who has a prior\nthe notion that inclusion and exclusion are treated the same under the\nEqual Protection Clause.\n                                                                              drug conviction, would most likely excuse Chandler for cause\n\fNos. 02-3320/3321                United States v.

When\non this record is that race was not only a factor, but the        coupled with the surrounding circumstances, there can be no\nmoving force behind the decision to include Chandler.             doubt that the principle of race neutrality in jury selection,\n                                                                  embodied in the Equal Protection Clause, was violated. The\n  Finally, the majority argues that the fact that defense         majority’s slight-of-hand, however well-intentioned, is\ncounsel “allegedly harbored the ‘evil thought’ of leaving         incapable of reducing constitutionally-offensive\nChandler on the jury because she is African American” is not      discriminatory acts into constitutionally-acceptable “evil\nenough to require reversal of Angel’s conviction.

When the “evil\nthought” is, as in this case, transformed into words and\nactions, however, “[n]either precedent nor policy supports”\nturning a blind eye to the unconstitutional conduct.\n   It is the dialogue between an attorney and a potential juror\nthat leads an attorney to accept or reject a juror. An\nexamination of that dialogue may also “support or refute an\ninference of discriminatory purpose” on the part of the\nattorney. Batson, 476 U.S. at 97. In this case, defense\ncounsel stated, “you’ve seen the panel, correct?” After\nChandler responded, “yes,” defense counsel stated, “so it’s\nimportant if we can get some minority representation on the\npanel if you’re chosen as a juror. You do understand the way\nwe feel?” J.A. at 518. The exchange between defense\ncounsel and Chandler reveals defense counsel’s “evil\nthoughts.” When defense counsel included Chandler, by\nfailing to challenge her despite her views on the drug\nsentencing laws and her unwillingness to serve, he pursued a\nspecific course of action in furtherance of his “evil thought,”\nand thus became an “evil doer.” The majority’s focus on the\naffirmative act of exercising a peremptory challenge to the\nexclusion of the affirmative act of speaking and the negative\nact of deciding not to challenge a juror, when those acts\nreveal unconstitutional conduct, is unacceptable.\n\f</pre>",
