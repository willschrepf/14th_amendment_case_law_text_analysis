Howell\nal.,\n\n                          Defendants.\n\n                                       MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        The plaintiff, National Security Counselors (“NSC”), brings three related actions against\n\nsix federal intelligence and defense agencies, claiming numerous violations of the Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552, et seq., and the Administrative Procedure Act\n\n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701, et seq., and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the FOIA,\n\nthe APA, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1361, and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. The gravamen of the plaintiff’s claims is that\n\nthese intelligence and defense agencies—principally the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”)—\n\nhave improperly handled the plaintiff’s requests for a variety of information under the FOIA.\n\nAlthough this allegedly improper agency behavior relates to a number of specific FOIA requests\n\nmade to the defendants, it has manifested more broadly in a series of what the plaintiff alleges to\n\nbe policies, practices, or standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) of the CIA that constitute\n\nongoing violations of the FOIA or the APA. 1 In essence, the plaintiff alleges a series of policies\n\nor practices by the CIA that have endeavored systematically to extinguish FOIA requests at their\n\n\n1\n  Although the CIA has a number of co-defendants in No. 11-445, the motions being decided in this opinion only\nrelate to claims against the CIA.\n\n\n\n                                                        1\n\finception, before the agency’s duty to search or make withholding decisions are triggered and\n\nbefore the agency must provide administrative remedies. In their totality, the allegations in these\n\nrelated actions paint a picture of the CIA’s desire to minimize the substance of its internal,\n\nadministrative consideration of FOIA requests by crafting mechanisms that limit FOIA\n\nrequesters’ access to such consideration, which in turn has tested the mettle, commitment, and\n\nresources of requesters like the plaintiff. The primary question presented by the CIA’s motions\n\nto dismiss the policy-or-practice claims in all three actions is whether such mechanisms are\n\npermitted by the FOIA.\n\nI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         The plaintiff in these related actions is a not-for-profit organization located in Arlington,\n\nVirginia, which was chartered in July 2009 by an attorney named Kelly McClanahan. 2\n\nAccording to its website, NSC performs four primary functions: (1) “to lawfully acquire from\n\nthe government material related to national security matters and distribute it to the public”;\n\n(2) “to use this material in the creation of original publications discussing the respective\n\nsubjects”; (3) “to advocate for intelligent reform in the national security and information and\n\nprivacy arenas”; and (4) “to provide a low-cost alternative to certain deserving clients involved\n\nin security law or information and privacy law-related proceedings.” See NAT’L SEC.\n\nCOUNSELORS, http://nationalsecuritylaw.org/ (last visited Oct. 17, 2012). To achieve these\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Compl. ¶¶ 3, 11, Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA (“NSC I”), No. 11-443 (Feb. 28, 2011). Because this opinion\naddresses the claims in three separate actions brought by the same plaintiff, for purposes of organizational clarity\nonly, the Court will refer to each case in short form as follows: No. 11-443 will be referred to as “NSC I,” No. 11-\n444 as “NSC II,” and No. 11-445 as “NSC III.” Additionally, for the same reasons, the Court will refer to court\nfilings in each case with a numerical prefix that corresponds to each Civil Case Number. For example, the\nplaintiff’s memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s partial motion to dismiss in No. 11-444 will be referred to,\nfor citation purposes only, as “Pl.’s 444 Opp’n.”\n\n\n\n                                                         2\n\ffunctions, the plaintiff frequently requests information under the FOIA from government\n\nagencies in the defense and intelligence sectors. 3\n\n        The instant actions involve challenges to both specific denials of records as well as\n\noverarching policies and practices of the CIA that are alleged to violate the FOIA. The CIA’s\n\nmotions to dismiss currently pending before the Court, however, deal almost exclusively with the\n\noverarching policies and practices alleged by the plaintiff. At issue are twelve separate alleged\n\npolicies or practices of the CIA, which the plaintiff claims are contrary to the CIA’s duties under\n\nthe FOIA. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the CIA has policies or practices of:\n\n        1. Refusing to recognize assignments of rights in FOIA requests (“Assignment of Rights\n           Policy”). See Compl. ¶¶ 19–22, NSC I.\n\n        2. Refusing to process requests for “aggregate data,” e.g., a database listing of FOIA\n           requests by fee category (“Aggregate Data Policy”). See FAC ¶¶ 12–16, NSC II.\n\n        3. Refusing to allow requesters the right of administrative appeal when their FOIA\n           requests are deemed improper (“Administrative Appeals Policy”). See FAC ¶¶ 27–\n           31, NSC II.\n\n        4. Applying an overbroad definition of the “reasonably describes” requirement\n           contained in 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A) (“Reasonably Describe Policy”). See FAC\n           ¶¶ 57–61, NSC II.\n\n        5. Failing to follow the requirement in 32 C.F.R. § 1900.12 that, if a FOIA request is\n           deemed improper, the agency must “work with, and offer suggestions to, the potential\n           requester in order to define a request properly” (“Work With Policy”). See FAC\n           ¶¶ 72–77, NSC II.\n\n        6. Imposing the date of the CIA’s response letter to a requester as the cut-off date on all\n           FOIA request searches (“Cut-Off Date Policy”). See FAC ¶¶ 112–115, NSC II.\n\n        7. Applying a blanket exemption to all information pertaining to the CIA’s processing of\n           FOIA and Privacy Act requests (“Blanket Processing Notes Exemption Policy”). See\n           FAC ¶¶ 33–37, NSC III.\n\n\n3\n See, e.g., First Am. Compl. (“FAC”) ¶¶ 15, 19, 30, Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA (“NSC II”), No. 11-444 (Mar. 21,\n2011), ECF No. 6; First Am. Compl.

Applying a blanket exemption to all FOIA and Privacy Act reference materials (e.g.,\n              training handbooks, manuals, guidelines) (“Blanket Reference Material Exemption\n              Policy”). See FAC ¶¶ 79–81, NSC III.\n\n           9. Categorically issuing Glomar responses to requests for information pertaining to\n              FOIA and Mandatory Declassification Review requests referred to the CIA by other\n              agencies (“Glomar Response Policy”). See FAC ¶¶ 94–98, NSC III.\n\n           10. Refusing to provide estimated dates of completion for FOIA requests (“Non-\n               Provision of Completion Date Policy”). See FAC ¶¶ 100–107, NSC III.\n\n           11. Refusing to identify records withheld in their entirety during the administrative stage\n               of FOIA processing (“Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy”). See FAC\n               ¶¶ 118–122, NSC III.\n\n           12. Invoking FOIA exemptions on a document level without indicating which exemptions\n               apply to particular redactions at the administrative stage of FOIA processing\n               (“Document-Level Exemption Policy”). See FAC ¶¶ 128–133, NSC III.\n\n           The Court will first discuss the factual allegations related to each of these purported\n\npolicies or practices before discussing the legal issues presented by the CIA’s partial motions to\n\ndismiss.\n\n\n           A.       Assignment of Rights Policy\n\n           The plaintiff complains that the CIA refuses to recognize the assignment of rights related\n\nto FOIA requests—an assignment necessitated in this particular case by Mr. McClanahan’s\n\nchange in employment. Prior to chartering NSC, Mr. McClanahan served as the Director of\n\nFOIA Operations at another not-for-profit organization called the James Madison Project\n\n(“JMP”). 4 According to the plaintiff, it shares with JMP “virtually all the same purposes and\n\ninterests,” except that NSC represents clients and JMP does not. See Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 25.\n\nIndeed, JMP’s stated mission is to “promote government accountability and the reduction of\n\nsecrecy, as well as to educate the public on issues relating to intelligence and national security\n\nthrough means of research, advocacy and the dissemination of information.” See JAMES\n4\n    Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. Dismiss (“Pl.’s 443 Opp’n”) at 2–3, NSC I, ECF No. 12.\n\n\n\n                                                          4\n\fMADISON PROJECT, http://www.jamesmadisonproject.org (last visited Oct. 17, 2012). On April\n\n10, 2008, JMP submitted a FOIA request to the CIA for eleven articles originally published in\n\nthe CIA in-house journal Studies in Intelligence. Compl. ¶ 6, NSC I. On May 14, 2008, the CIA\n\nacknowledged receipt of JMP’s request and notified JMP that no fees would be assessed for the\n\nrequest. Id. ¶ 7. On February 27, 2009, the CIA released ten of the articles requested by JMP.\n\nFour articles were released in full and six were released with redactions under FOIA Exemptions\n\n1, 2, and 3. On April 13, 2009, JMP administratively appealed the CIA’s invocation of these\n\nexemptions. Id. ¶¶ 8–9.\n\n       Several months after the administrative appeal of the withholding decisions was filed, on\n\nJuly 31, 2009, Mr. McClanahan left JMP to charter NSC and serve as its Executive Director. Id.\n\n¶ 11. Because the request for the Studies in Intelligence articles were a “pet project[]” of Mr.\n\nMcClanahan’s, see Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 25, on October 7, 2009, JMP notified the CIA that it was\n\nassigning all rights, benefits and interests in that request to NSC, including the right to “pursue\n\nany administrative or legal methods at [NSC’s] disposal” relative to this request and also\n\n“surrendering any claims it may have” with respect to this request. Id. Ex. Q at 1, ECF No. 12-\n\n18; Compl. ¶ 12, NSC I. While the administrative appeal of the exemptions claimed on the\n\nStudies in Intelligence articles was pending, the plaintiff sent a letter to the CIA on May 25,\n\n2010, requesting that the appeal be amended to include a challenge to a redaction in one of the\n\narticles since the agency had not claimed an exemption for this redaction, and the redaction had\n\nbeen omitted from the original appeal. Compl. ¶ 13, NSC I. Prior to sending this letter, the\n\nplaintiff had begun to suspect that the CIA was refusing to recognize JMP’s assignment of rights\n\n(the “Assignment”), and the plaintiff therefore requested assistance from the CIA’s Office of\n\nGovernment Information Services (“OGIS”) to clarify the CIA’s position on the Assignment. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f¶ 14. The OGIS responded to the plaintiff on June 8, 2010, after consulting with the CIA’s\n\nOffice of General Counsel (“OGC”), informing the plaintiff that it was the CIA’s policy not to\n\naccept assignments of rights with regard to FOIA requests and suggesting that the plaintiff would\n\nneed to file new FOIA requests for the same records in order to pursue them administratively.\n\nId. ¶ 15.\n\n        The plaintiff alleges in Count One of the Complaint in No. 11-443 that it has a legal right\n\nto the information in the Studies in Intelligence articles that it requested, by virtue of the\n\nAssignment, and it also challenges the CIA’s Assignment of Rights Policy in Count Two,\n\nalleging that the policy is in violation of the FOIA and the APA. Id. ¶¶ 17, 19, 22. As a result,\n\nthe plaintiff seeks a full disclosure of the Studies in Intelligence articles originally requested by\n\nJMP, 5 a declaration that the CIA’s policy of refusing to recognize assignments of rights violates\n\nthe FOIA and/or the APA, and an injunction compelling the CIA to accept assignments of rights.\n\nCompl. at 7, NSC I.\n\n        B.       Aggregate Data Policy\n\n        The plaintiff complains that the CIA denied five FOIA requests in 2010 for database\n\nrecords organized into specific categories as detailed in each request, and with respect to four of\n\nthese requests the plaintiff claims that the CIA denied any administrative appeal rights.\n\nSpecifically, on July 5, 2010, the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to the CIA seeking “a record\n\nthat would indicate the ten individuals responsible for the most FOIA requests submitted (each)\n\nin Fiscal Years 2008, 2009, and 2010.” FAC ¶ 42, NSC II; Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex. A at 1, ECF No.\n\n17-2. The CIA responded on July 22, 2010 that it was declining to process this request, stating:\n\n\n5\n The CIA accepted JMP’s appeal regarding the Studies in Intelligence articles on April 23, 2009, see Pl.’s 443\nOpp’n Ex. Q at 7, but the parties have provided no information about the status of that appeal or whether the\nadministrative remedies regarding that request have been exhausted. The CIA does not contest the issue of\nexhaustion, and thus the Court will assume that administrative remedies for that claim have been exhausted.\n\n\n\n                                                         6\n\f“We have completed a thorough review of your request and have determined that our record\n\nsystems are not configured in a way that would allow us to perform a search reasonably\n\ncalculated to lead to the responsive record without an unreasonable effort.” Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex.\n\nA at 4. The CIA’s response further stated: “The FOIA does not require federal agencies to\n\nperform research, create records or conduct unreasonable searches through a body of material to\n\nsee if any of it is related to a particular request.” Id. The plaintiff did not appeal this\n\ndetermination, and it alleges that if it had submitted an administrative appeal, the CIA would\n\nhave refused to accept it. FAC ¶ 44, NSC II. In Count Eight of the First Amended Complaint in\n\nNo. 11-444, the plaintiff maintains that it has a legal right to this requested record and seeks the\n\nrecord’s disclosure. Id. ¶ 45.\n\n        On August 8, 2010, the plaintiff submitted four FOIA requests to the CIA seeking\n\n“database listings of all FOIA requesters from Fiscal Years 2008–2010 according to the fee\n\ncategories to which CIA assigned them.” Id. ¶ 6. In particular, each of these requests sought “a\n\ndatabase listing of all the FOIA requesters from FY 2008–present that you have classified as”\n\neither “news media,” “educational or scientific,” “commercial,” or “all other.” See Pl.’s 444\n\nOpp’n Ex. B at 1, 4, 7, 10, ECF No. 17-3. On September 30, 2010, the CIA acknowledged\n\nreceipt of these requests and assigned them tracking numbers but informed the plaintiff that it\n\nwas declining to process the requests, stating that “[t]he FOIA does not require federal agencies\n\nto create a record, collect information, conduct research, or analyze data.” Id. at 14–17. The\n\nplaintiff attempted to administratively appeal these determinations, but the CIA responded on\n\nOctober 21, 2010 that “since we did not provide you with appeal rights, we cannot accept your\n\nappeal[s].” Id. at 18–21. In Count One of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fplaintiff maintains that it has a legal right to these requested records and seeks the records’\n\ndisclosure. See FAC ¶ 10, NSC II.\n\n        In addition to these five specific denials of FOIA requests, the plaintiff also alleges that\n\nthe “CIA’s refusal to process requests for aggregate data represents an ongoing policy, practice,\n\nor standard operating procedure (‘SOP’)” that violates the FOIA. Id. ¶¶ 12–13. The plaintiff\n\nseeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged Aggregate Data Policy in Counts Two,\n\nThree, and Four of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444 under the FOIA, the APA, and\n\nthe Mandamus Act, respectively. Id. ¶¶ 13, 16, 18–20, 22–25.\n\n        C.       Reasonably Describe Policy\n\n        Next, the plaintiff complains about two FOIA requests made in 2010 and 2011,\n\nrespectively, that the CIA declined to process for failure to “reasonably describe” the records\n\nsought—a decision by the CIA that the plaintiff claims would also result in a denial of\n\nadministrative appeal rights, although the plaintiff did not test that result by filing any\n\nadministrative appeals. Specifically, on May 13, 2010, the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to\n\nthe CIA seeking “a representative sample of [CIA] analytical reports and memoranda presenting\n\npsychological analyses or profiles of foreign government officials, terrorist leaders, international\n\ncriminals, business figures, and other intelligence targets prepared by the Medical and\n\nPsychological Analysis Center (‘MPAC’) or its predecessor Office of Leadership Analysis\n\n(‘OLA’).” 6 The request specified that a “representative sample” meant: (a) “[o]nly final official\n\nreports or memoranda,” (b) no more than twenty reports/memoranda from any given year,\n\n(c) “[f]our reports/memoranda for each year . . . for individuals in each category of intelligence\n\ntarget,” and (d) “[r]easonable variety in the intelligence targets wherever possible.” Lutz Decl.\n\n6\n Decl. of Martha Lutz, Information Review Officer, Director’s Area, Central Intelligence Agency (“Lutz Decl.”)\nEx. M at 1, NSC II, ECF No. 20-3.\n\n\n\n                                                        8\n\fEx. M at 1–2. The CIA responded to this request on June 23, 2010, stating that it could not\n\naccept the request in its current form because it had not “reasonably describe[d]” the records\n\nsought, citing the “breadth and lack of specificity” of the request and “the way in which [the\n\nCIA’s] records systems are configured.” Id. Ex. N at 1, ECF No. 20-3. The CIA’s response\n\nfurther encouraged the plaintiff “to refine the scope of your request (such as including a narrower\n\ntime frame for, and more specific descriptions of, the information you seek) to enable us to\n\nconduct a reasonable search for responsive information.” Id. Once again, the plaintiff did not\n\nappeal this determination, and it alleges that if it had submitted an administrative appeal, the CIA\n\nwould have refused to accept it. FAC ¶ 49, NSC II. In Count Nine of the First Amended\n\nComplaint in No. 11-444, the plaintiff maintains that it has a legal right to this requested record\n\nand seeks the record’s disclosure. Id. ¶ 50.\n\n       Relatedly, on February 16, 2011, the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to the CIA\n\nseeking “all [CIA] records pertaining to the IBM supercomputer named ‘Watson.’” Lutz Decl.\n\nEx. O at 1, ECF No. 20-3. The CIA’s response to this request on March 2, 2011 was\n\nsubstantially identical to its response to the plaintiff’s May 13, 2010 FOIA request, stating that it\n\ncould not accept the request in its current form because it had not “reasonably describe[d]” the\n\nrecords sought, citing the “breadth and lack of specificity” of the request and “the way in which\n\n[the CIA’s] records systems are configured.” Id. Ex. P at 1, ECF No. 20-3. The CIA’s response\n\nfurther encouraged the plaintiff “to refine the scope of your request (such as contracts, if they\n\nexist, which would explain records pertaining to ‘Watson’) to enable us to conduct a reasonable\n\nsearch for responsive information.” Id. Yet again, the plaintiff did not appeal this determination,\n\nand it alleges that if it had submitted an administrative appeal, the CIA would have refused to\n\naccept it. FAC ¶ 54, NSC II. In Count Ten of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fplaintiff maintains that it has a legal right to these requested records and seeks the records’\n\ndisclosure. Id. ¶ 55.\n\n       In addition to these two specific denials of FOIA requests, the plaintiff has submitted\n\nforty-four other denials by the CIA that rely on the requester’s failure to “reasonably describe”\n\nthe records sought as a basis for declining to process the requests. Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex. E at 1–\n\n45, 47–51, 53–55. The plaintiff alleges that these refusals to process requests that do not\n\n“reasonably describe” records sought is related to the fact that “[i]n a majority of these cases,\n\nCIA has cited the configuration of its records systems as a disqualifying factor.” FAC ¶ 58, NSC\n\nII. These forty-four other denials span nearly four years, from August 1, 2007 to June 27, 2011,\n\nand they are in reference to FOIA requests made by the plaintiff as well as a number of other,\n\nnon-party FOIA requesters, including JMP, MuckRock, Gawker Media, and the National\n\nSecurity Archive.

The plaintiff alleges that, by\n\nrelying upon “the configuration of its records systems” in concluding that FOIA requests fail to\n\n“reasonably describe” records sought, the CIA’s “application of FOIA’s ‘reasonably describe’\n\nrequirement is significantly and consistently broader than is allowed by FOIA,” which the\n\nplaintiff claims is a policy or practice of the CIA that violates the FOIA. FAC ¶¶ 58–59, NSC II.\n\nThe plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged Reasonably Describe\n\nPolicy in Counts Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444\n\nunder the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act, respectively. Id. ¶¶ 59, 61, 63–65, 67–70.\n\n       D.      Administrative Appeals Policy and Work With Policy\n\n       As discussed above, when the plaintiff attempted to administratively appeal the CIA’s\n\nrefusal to process the plaintiff’s August 8, 2010 FOIA requests seeking “database listings of all\n\nFOIA requesters from Fiscal Years 2008–2010 according to the fee categories to which CIA\n\nassigned them,” the CIA refused to accept the plaintiff’s administrative appeal. FAC ¶ 6, NSC\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fII; see also Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex. B at 18–21. According to the plaintiff, this was not an isolated\n\nincident. The plaintiff has also submitted examples of similar refusals to allow administrative\n\nappeals by the CIA in response to three other FOIA requests submitted by two non-party FOIA\n\nrequesters. See id. Ex C at 2; id. Ex. D. From these examples, the plaintiff alleges that,\n\nwhenever the CIA refuses to process a FOIA request that it deems “improper” (e.g., because it\n\ndoes not “reasonably describe” requested records or it seeks “aggregate data”), the CIA has a\n\npolicy or practice of refusing to accept administrative appeals from those decisions. See FAC\n\n¶¶ 28–29, NSC II. The plaintiff claims that this Administrative Appeals Policy violates the\n\nFOIA, and it seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from the alleged policy in Counts Five, Six,\n\nand Seven of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444 under the FOIA, the APA, and the\n\nMandamus Act, respectively. FAC ¶¶ 29, 31, 33–35, 37–40, NSC II.\n\n       Similarly, the plaintiff alleges that in the “numerous instances in which CIA has refused\n\nto process a FOIA request it deemed improper,” the CIA has endeavored to “‘work with, and\n\noffer suggestions to, the potential requester’” in “virtually none of those circumstances.” Id. ¶ 74\n\n(quoting 32 C.F.R. § 1900.12(c)). In support of this claim, the plaintiff cites a series of CIA\n\nresponses to “improper” FOIA requests that either “contained only six formulaic suggestions” or\n\n“did not contain any suggestions at all.” See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex. E at 1, 3–51, 53–55. The\n\nplaintiff claims that this behavior constitutes a policy or practice that violates the CIA’s own\n\nFOIA regulation, 32 C.F.R. § 1900.12(c), which states: “Communications which do not meet\n\nthe[] requirements [of reasonably describing the records sought and not requiring an\n\nunreasonable search] will be considered an expression of interest and the Agency will work with,\n\nand offer suggestions to, the potential requester in order to define a request properly.” See FAC\n\n¶¶ 73–75. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged Work With\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fPolicy in Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, and Sixteen of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444\n\nunder the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act, respectively. Id. ¶¶ 75, 77, 79–81, 83–86.\n\n          E.     Cut-Off Date Policy\n\n          The plaintiff alleges that “[i]n every response letter [it] has received from CIA, CIA has\n\nimposed an arbitrary cut-off date on the search of the date of the response letter, regardless of the\n\nnature of the request or how long the search is expected to take.” Id. ¶ 112. Although the\n\nplaintiff alleges that the CIA imposes this “arbitrary cut-off date” in response to every FOIA\n\nrequest it has ever made to the CIA, the plaintiff has also submitted ten examples of such\n\nresponses to serve as a “representative sample,” all of which were sent to the plaintiff after this\n\naction was commenced. Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 14–15; id. Ex. G. The plaintiff alleges that applying\n\nan “arbitrary ‘date of response’ cut-off date regardless of the nature of the request or the\n\nanticipated length of the search” is a policy or practice of the CIA that violates the FOIA, and the\n\nplaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged Cut-Off Date Policy in Count\n\nTwenty-One of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444 under the FOIA. FAC ¶¶ 113, 115,\n\nNSC II.\n\n          F.     Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy and Document-Level\n                 Exemption Policy\n\n          Next, the plaintiff alleges two policies or practices of the CIA that relate to the CIA’s\n\nprocessing of FOIA requests at the administrative level. First, the plaintiff claims that “[i]n\n\nevery case in which CIA has withheld records in their entirety in response to [one of the\n\nplaintiff’s] FOIA request[s], . . . CIA has consistently refused to identify any of the records\n\nwithheld in their entirety.” FAC ¶ 118, NSC III. The plaintiff alleges that this persistent\n\n“refus[al] to identify withheld records in the administrative stage” is a policy or practice of the\n\nCIA, citing a publicly available CIA training outline created in 2001, which states, “at initial and\n\n\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fat appeal stage, no listing of documents . . . is required,” and the plaintiff claims that this\n\nWithheld Document Non-Identification Policy violates the FOIA. Id. ¶¶ 118–20. The plaintiff\n\ntherefore seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged policy in Counts Eighteen and\n\nNineteen, of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-445 under the FOIA and the APA,\n\nrespectively. See id. ¶¶ 120, 122, 124–26.\n\n        The plaintiff also alleges that, “[i]n the majority of cases in which CIA has withheld\n\nrecords in their entirety in response to [one of the plaintiff’s] FOIA request[s], . . . CIA has\n\nconsistently invoked exemptions in the alternative,” and that “[i]n every case in which CIA has\n\nredacted information from records released in response to [one of the plaintiff’s] FOIA\n\nrequest[s], . . . CIA has consistently invoked exemptions on a document-level without indicating\n\nwhich exemptions applied to which particular redactions.” Id. ¶¶ 128–29. The plaintiff further\n\nalleges that this activity represents an ongoing policy or practice of the CIA, citing the same\n\ntraining manual it cited in challenging the alleged Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy,\n\nwhich also states that “at the initial and at appeal stage, no . . . putting specific exemptions next\n\nto redactions, is required,” and the plaintiff claims that this alleged Document-Level Exemption\n\nPolicy violates the FOIA. Id. ¶¶ 119, 130–31. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief from this alleged policy in Counts Twenty and Twenty-One of the First Amended\n\nComplaint in No. 11-445 under the FOIA and the APA, respectively. Id. ¶¶ 133, 135–37.\n\n        G.      Blanket Processing Notes Exemption Policy and Blanket Reference Material\n                Exemption Policy\n\n        The plaintiff has, through numerous separate FOIA requests, sought two types of records\n\nintegral to the processing of FOIA requests: namely, notes prepared and reference materials\n\nused by personnel actually processing the requests, but the plaintiff claims that the CIA has\n\ncategorically declined to disclose either type of record. Specifically, on December 1, 2009, the\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fplaintiff submitted a FOIA request to the CIA seeking “copies of all CIA records ‘referencing\n\nFOIA and Privacy Act requests submitted by [ten listed parties] that contain remarks, comments,\n\nnotes, explanations, etc. made by CIA personnel or contractors about the processing of these\n\nrequests (and appeals, if appropriate), the invocation of exemptions, or related matters.’” FAC\n\n¶ 11, NSC III. This information was to include “analysts’ notes made during the processing of\n\nthe requests, any standard worksheets completed by the analysts, any justifications for exemption\n\ninvocations,” as well as “any correspondence referencing the requests.” Id. The plaintiff refers\n\nto this kind of request generally as a “Processing Notes request,” and the plaintiff alleges that it\n\nhas also submitted seventeen other Processing Notes requests to the CIA, and in thirteen of those\n\nrequests the CIA identified responsive records. Id. ¶¶ 11, 33. The plaintiff also claims that, in\n\nresponse to twelve of those thirteen FOIA requests involving responsive records, the CIA “has\n\nwithheld everything from . . . release except for correspondence with the requester.” Id. ¶ 33.\n\n       Relatedly, the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request on February 6, 2010 for “copies of ‘all\n\ncurrent training handbooks, manuals, guidelines, checklists, worksheets, and similar documents\n\nprovided to [CIA] FOIA and Privacy Act analysts.” Id. ¶ 56. The plaintiff refers to this kind of\n\nrequest generally as a “Reference Materials request,” and it claims that, in response to FOIA\n\nrequests seeking such reference materials, the CIA “appl[ies] a blanket exemption” to all such\n\nreference materials. Id. ¶ 79.\n\n       The plaintiff claims that these patterns of activity by the CIA with respect to FOIA\n\nprocessing notes and reference materials constitute two policies or practices that violate the\n\nFOIA by applying an improper blanket exemption to all such materials, thereby preventing their\n\ndisclosure. Id. ¶¶ 33, 35, 79. As a result, the plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief\n\nfrom the alleged Blanket Processing Notes Exemption Policy and Blanket Reference Material\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fExemption Policy in Counts Four and Eleven of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-445,\n\nrespectively, under the FOIA. Id. ¶ 37, 81.\n\n        H.       Glomar Response Policy\n\n        The plaintiff has submitted nine FOIA requests to the CIA, two of which are at issue in\n\nthis litigation, seeking records “pertaining to FOIA or Mandatory Declassification Review\n\n(‘MDR’) requests” that had been referred to the CIA by other government agencies. Id. ¶ 94.\n\nBased on the two examples of such requests provided by the plaintiff, these requests were similar\n\nto a Processing Notes request and sought the same types of information as such requests, except\n\nthat they sought processing notes from particular FOIA requests, rather than generally seeking all\n\nCIA processing notes related to particular requesters. See id. ¶¶ 83, 89. The plaintiff alleges\n\nthat, in response to these processing notes requests, the CIA “issued a Glomar response to all but\n\none of these requests,” and it further alleges that this activity by the CIA constitutes an agency\n\npolicy or practice. Id. ¶ 94.\n\n        A Glomar response is “an exception to the general rule that agencies must acknowledge\n\nthe existence of information responsive to a FOIA request and provide specific, non-conclusory\n\njustifications for withholding that information.” Roth v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 642 F.3d 1161,\n\n1178 (D.C. Cir. 2011). 7 Thus, a Glomar response allows an agency to respond to a FOIA\n\nrequest by neither confirming nor denying the existence of any records responsive to the request,\n\non the grounds that “confirming or denying the existence of records would itself ‘cause harm\n\ncognizable under a[] FOIA exception.’” Id. (quoting Wolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370, 374 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007)). The plaintiff alleges that “[t]he fact that any given FOIA or MDR request is referred to\n\n\n7\n Glomar responses are “named for the Hughes Glomar Explorer, a ship used in a classified Central Intelligence\nAgency project ‘to raise a sunken Soviet submarine from the floor of the Pacific Ocean to recover the missiles,\ncodes, and communications equipment onboard for analysis by United States military and intelligence experts.’”\nRoth, 642 F.3d at 1171 (quoting Phillippi v. CIA, 655 F.2d 1325, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1981)).\n\n\n\n                                                        15\n\fCIA by another government agency is not classified,” and therefore the plaintiff claims that the\n\nCIA’s alleged policy or practice of “authoriz[ing] a Glomar response to any request for\n\ninformation pertaining to FOIA and MDR requests referred to an agency” is an ongoing violation\n\nof the FOIA. Id. ¶ 95–96. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged\n\nGlomar Response Policy in Count Fourteen of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-445\n\nunder the FOIA. Id. ¶ 98.\n\n       I.      Non-Provision of Completion Date Policy\n\n       Finally, the plaintiff alleges that, in conjunction with pending FOIA requests with the\n\nCIA, the plaintiff “asked CIA numerous times in 2009–2010 for estimated dates of completion\n\nfor its pending FOIA requests” pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(7)(B). Id. ¶ 101. That portion of\n\nthe FOIA provides that “[e]ach agency shall . . . provide[] information about the status of a\n\nrequest to the person making the request,” including “an estimated date of on which the agency\n\nwill complete action on the request.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(7)(B). The plaintiff claims that until\n\nNovember 2010, the CIA “refused to provide [the plaintiff] with estimated dates of completion.”\n\nFAC ¶ 101, NSC III.\n\n       On November 17, 2010, however, the plaintiff alleges that a representative of the CIA\n\ninformed the plaintiff “that CIA’s new policy was to inform requesters that the estimated date of\n\ncompletion for any given request is two years from CIA’s date of receipt.” Id. That same day,\n\nthe plaintiff alleges, non-party JMP requested estimated dates of completion from the CIA for\n\nthree pending FOIA requests that were more than two years old, specifically invoking 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(7)(B). Id. ¶ 102. Even so, the plaintiff alleges that on November 24, 2010, the CIA\n\nresponded to JMP’s request but “refused to provide the requested estimated dates of\n\ncompletion.” Id. The plaintiff also alleges that the CIA similarly refused to provide estimated\n\ndates of completion for pending FOIA requests to a non-party named Michael Ravnitzky, who\n\n\n                                                16\n\frequested such dates on November 28, 2010. Id. ¶ 103. As a result of this pattern of behavior,\n\nthe plaintiff claims that the CIA’s refusal to provide estimated dates of completion, in\n\ncompliance with 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(7)(B), represents an ongoing policy or practice of the CIA\n\nthat violates the FOIA. Id. ¶¶ 104–05. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from\n\nthis alleged Non-Provision of Completion Date Policy in Counts Fifteen, Sixteen, and Seventeen\n\nof the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-445 under the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus\n\nAct, respectively. See id. ¶¶ 105, 107, 109–11, 113–16.\n\n                                                      ***\n\n         The plaintiff filed the Complaints in each of these three actions on February 28, 2011,\n\nand the plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint in Nos. 11-444 and 11-445 on March 21, 2011.\n\nPending before the Court are the CIA’s partial motions to dismiss in all three actions. The\n\nmotions have been brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to\n\nstate a claim as well as Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, the Court will deny the CIA’s Partial Motion to Dismiss in No. 11-443, the\n\nCourt will grant in part and deny in part the CIA’s Partial Motion to Dismiss in No. 11-444, and\n\nthe Court will grant in part and deny in part the defendants’ Partial Motion to Dismiss in No. 11-\n\n445. 8\n\n\n\n\n8\n As stated above, although the CIA has a number of co-defendants in No. 11-445, the motions being decided in this\nopinion only relate to claims against the CIA.\n\n\n\n                                                       17\n\fII.     STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n        A.       Motions to Dismiss\n\n        In its partial motions to dismiss, the CIA invokes the legal standards for dismissal under\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1). 9\n\n        When faced with a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Rule\n\n12(b)(1), a court has “an affirmative obligation to consider whether the constitutional and\n\nstatutory authority exist” for it to hear the case. James Madison Ltd. v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085,\n\n1092 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). For this reason, “the [p]laintiff's\n\nfactual allegations in the complaint . . . will bear closer scrutiny in resolving a 12(b)(1) motion\n\nthan in resolving a 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim.” Grand Lodge of Fraternal\n\nOrder of Police v. Ashcroft, 85 F. Supp. 2d 9, 13–14 (D.D.C. 2001) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). When the purported lack of jurisdiction stems from a lack of standing, however, the\n\ncourt “must assume that [the plaintiff] states a valid legal claim.” Info. Handling Servs., Inc. v.\n\nDef. Automated Printing Servs., 338 F.3d 1024, 1029 (D.C. Cir. 2003). The proponent of\n\njurisdiction bears the burden of proving that it exists, Khadr v. United States, 529 F.3d 1112,\n\n1115 (D.C. Cir. 2008), and while “the district court may consider materials outside the\n\npleadings,” it must “still accept all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true.” Jerome\n\nStevens Pharm., Inc. v. FDA, 402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (citations and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n        To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff need only plead “enough\n\nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face” and to “nudge[ ] [his or her] claims\n\nacross the line from conceivable to plausible.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570\n\n9\n See Mem. in Supp. Def.’s Mot. Dismiss Claims One and Two of Pl.’s Compl. (“Def.’s 443 Mem.”), at 1, NSC I,\nECF No. 7-1; Mem. in Supp. Def.’s Partial Mot. Dismiss (“Def.’s 444 Mem.”), at 1, NSC II, ECF No. 9-1; Mem. in\nSupp. Defs.’ Partial Mot. Dismiss (“Defs.’ 445 Mem.”), at 1, NSC III, ECF No. 10-1.\n\n\n\n                                                      18\n\f(2007); see also FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). “[A] complaint [does not] suffice if it tenders ‘naked\n\nassertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual enhancement.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\n\n(2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). Instead, the complaint must plead facts that are\n\nmore than “‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s liability”; “the plaintiff [must] plead[ ] factual\n\ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the\n\nmisconduct alleged.” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557); accord Rudder v. Williams, 666\n\nF.3d 790, 794 (D.C. Cir. 2012). The Court “must assume all the allegations in the complaint are\n\ntrue (even if doubtful in fact) . . . [and] must give the plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable\n\ninferences derived from the facts alleged.” Aktieselskabet AF 21. November 2001 v. Fame Jeans\n\nInc., 525 F.3d 8, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        B.      FOIA Generally\n\n        Congress enacted the FOIA to promote transparency across the government. See 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552; Quick v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, Nat’l Inst. of Standards & Tech., 775 F. Supp.\n\n2d 174, 179–80 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing Stern v. FBI, 737 F.2d 84, 88 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). The\n\nSupreme Court has explained that FOIA is “a means for citizens to know ‘what their\n\nGovernment is up to.’ This phrase should not be dismissed as a convenient formalism. It\n\ndefines a structural necessity in a real democracy.” Nat’l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish,\n\n541 U.S. 157, 171–72 (2004) (citations omitted). “The basic purpose of FOIA is to ensure an\n\ninformed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society, needed to check against\n\ncorruption and to hold the governors accountable to the governed.” NLRB v. Robbins Tire &\n\nRubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978). The strong interest in transparency must be tempered,\n\nhowever, by the “‘legitimate governmental and private interests [that] could be harmed by\n\nrelease of certain types of information.’” United Techs. Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense, 601 F.3d\n\n557, 559 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Critical Mass Energy Project v. Nuclear Regulatory\n\n\n                                                   19\n\fComm’n, 975 F.2d 871, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1992)). Accordingly, Congress included nine exemptions\n\npermitting agencies to withhold information from FOIA disclosure. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). “These\n\nexemptions are explicitly made exclusive, and must be narrowly construed.” Milner v. Dep’t of\n\nthe Navy, 131 S. Ct. 1259, 1262 (2011) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (citing\n\nFBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 630 (1982)); see also Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Office of Mgmt. &\n\nBudget, 598 F.3d 865, 869 (D.C. Cir. 2010).\n\n       The D.C. Circuit has also recognized that, separate from claims seeking relief for specific\n\nrequests made under the FOIA, requesting parties may also assert a “claim that an agency policy\n\nor practice will impair the party’s lawful access to information in the future.” Payne Enters.,\n\nInc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486, 491 (D.C. Cir. 1988); accord Newport Aeronautical Sales v.\n\nDep’t of the Air Force, 684 F.3d 160, 164 (D.C. Cir. 2012). The Court in Payne held that a\n\npolicy-or-practice claim is viable “[s]o long as an agency’s refusal to supply information\n\nevidences a policy or practice of delayed disclosure or some other failure to abide by the terms of\n\nthe FOIA, and not merely isolated mistakes by agency officials.” Payne, 837 F.2d at 491. To\n\nstate a claim for relief under the doctrine articulated in Payne, a plaintiff must plausibly\n\ndemonstrate that: (1) the agency in question has adopted, endorsed, or implemented a policy or\n\npractice that constitutes an ongoing “failure to abide by the terms of the FOIA”; and (2) the\n\nplaintiff will “suffer ‘continuing injury due to this practice.’” See id. (quoting Better Gov’t Ass’n\n\nv. Dep’t of State, 780 F.2d 86, 91 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).\n\nIII.   DISCUSSION\n\n       When a federal court is faced with both a challenge to its Article III jurisdiction to hear a\n\nclaim as well as a challenge to the merits of that claim, the court must address the jurisdictional\n\nquestion before addressing any question of the merits. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fEnv’t, 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998); accord Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the Dist. of Columbia,\n\n486 F.3d 1342, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“‘Article III jurisdiction is always an antecedent question’\n\nto be answered prior to any merits inquiry.” (quoting Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 101)). Therefore, the\n\nCourt will first address the CIA’s challenges to the plaintiffs’ standing to bring certain claims.\n\n          A.     Standing\n\n          Article III of the United States Constitution limits the federal judicial power to the\n\nresolution of “Cases” and “Controversies.” U.S. CONST. art. III § 2; see also Ariz. Christian Sch.\n\nTuition Org. v. Winn, 131 S. Ct. 1436, 1441–42 (2011) (explaining case-or-controversy\n\nrequirement). Several doctrines have “grown up to elaborate” the case-or-controversy\n\nrequirement, the “most important” of which is standing. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750\n\n(1984).\n\n          As the Supreme Court has explained, “the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\n\ncontains three elements.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). First, the\n\nplaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact,” i.e., “an invasion of a legally protected interest\n\nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\n\nhypothetical.” Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Second, there must be “a\n\ncausal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,” i.e., the injury alleged\n\nmust be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant. Id. Finally, it must be likely\n\nthat the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Id. at 561. Moreover, when a plaintiff\n\nseeks prospective declaratory or injunctive relief, allegations of past harms are insufficient. See,\n\ne.g., Dearth v. Holder, 641 F.3d 499, 501 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Rather, when declaratory or\n\ninjunctive relief is sought, a plaintiff “must show he is suffering an ongoing injury or faces an\n\nimmediate threat of [future] injury.” Id. (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105\n\n(1983)).\n\n\n                                                   21\n\f        In these related actions, the CIA raises two issues regarding the plaintiff’s standing to\n\nsue. The first issue relates only to the claims brought in No. 11-443 regarding the Assignment of\n\nRights Policy. The CIA challenges the plaintiff’s standing to bring both the policy-or-practice\n\nclaim itself, as well as the plaintiff’s related claim in Count One of No. 11-443, in which it asks\n\nthe Court to order the CIA to process the FOIA request that was assigned to it by JMP. The CIA\n\nargues that “[b]ecause NSC does not have any enforceable rights or interests in the FOIA\n\nrequests it references in [its policy-or-practice claim], it cannot establish that the CIA’s alleged\n\npolicy has harmed or will harm ‘a legally protected, concrete and particularized interest.’”\n\nDef.’s 443 Mem. at 7 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561). The CIA frames this as a matter of\n\nArticle III standing, see id., but the premise of the CIA’s argument hinges entirely on the merits\n\nof the plaintiff’s claims that the Assignment is valid and enforceable and that, as a result, the\n\nplaintiff has a statutory right, i.e., a “legally protected and particularized” right, to the\n\ninformation sought in the assigned FOIA request. The plaintiff’s alleged lack of injury-in-fact\n\nstems directly and exclusively from the fact that its name did not appear on the assigned FOIA\n\nrequest when that request was filed, 10 and therefore the CIA’s argument presents a question of\n\nstatutory, rather than Article III, standing. This means that the Court may resolve both the merits\n\nand jurisdictional issues of this claim at the outset. See, e.g., Chalabi v. Hashemite Kingdom of\n\nJordan, 543 F.3d 725, 728 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (holding that “Steel Co.’s bar on hypothetical\n\njurisdiction poses no obstacle” to resolving issues with “both threshold and merits\n\ncharacteristics” when the threshold issues relate to statutory standing). It follows necessarily that\n\nif the Assignment is valid and enforceable, the plaintiff has standing to bring the claims\n\narticulated in No. 11-443.\n10\n   See Def.’s 443 Mem. at 4–5; Def.’s Reply in Supp. of Def.’s Mot. Dismiss Claims One and Two (“Def.’s 443\nReply”) at 2, NSC I, ECF No. 13 (“On the issue of standing, there is only one contested question before the Court:\nwhether the FOIA permits the assignments of FOIA rights.”).\n\n\n\n                                                        22\n\f               1.      Assignment of Rights to FOIA Requests\n\n       “Anyone whose request for specific information has been denied has standing to bring an\n\naction [under the FOIA].” Zivotofsky ex rel. Ari Z. v. Sec’y of State, 444 F.3d 614, 617 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2006). “The requester is injured-in-fact for standing purposes because he did not get what\n\nthe statute entitled him to receive.” Id. at 617–18. The FOIA provides that “each agency, upon\n\nany request for records” that is sufficiently specific and made in accordance with published\n\nprocedures for submitting such requests, “shall make the records promptly available to any\n\nperson.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A). An agency’s duties under the FOIA are triggered by a\n\nproperly framed request for information, and the agency’s obligations flowing from that request\n\nare with respect to “the requester” of the information. See id. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i) (requiring\n\nagency to notify “the person making [the] request” whether the agency will comply with the\n\nrequest and “the right of such person to appeal”). The first question raised by this case is\n\nwhether the right to information, arising from the denial of a person’s request for such\n\ninformation, is transferrable to another person after the original request has been made but before\n\nadministrative remedies have been exhausted.\n\n       Courts have typically not allowed anyone other than the person originally requesting\n\ninformation under the FOIA to challenge an agency’s action in responding to the request. See\n\nMcDonnell v. United States, 4 F.3d 1227, 1238–39 (3d Cir. 1993) (“We think a person whose\n\nname does not appear on a request for records . . . . has no right to receive either the documents,\n\nor notice of an agency decision to withhold the documents.” (citations omitted)); Feinman v.\n\nFBI, 680 F. Supp. 2d 169, 173 (D.D.C. 2010) (“[A] plaintiff whose name does not appear on a\n\nFOIA request lacks standing to challenge its denial . . . .”); see also SAE Prods., Inc. v. FBI, 589\n\nF. Supp. 2d 76, 80 (D.D.C. 2008) (corporate agent requesting information “must adequately\n\nidentify that he or she is making the FOIA request on behalf of the corporation in order for the\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fcorporation itself to have standing to pursue a FOIA action”); Three Forks Ranch Corp. v.\n\nBureau of Land Mgmt., 358 F. Supp. 2d 1, 3 (D.D.C. 2005) (“[A]n attorney must adequately\n\nidentify that he is making the FOIA request for his client in order for the client to have standing\n\nto pursue a FOIA action.”). This Circuit has, however, held that when a FOIA requester dies\n\nduring the pendency of his request, the rights to pursue the FOIA request may survive and pass\n\nto the legal representative of the requester’s estate. See Sinito v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 176 F.3d\n\n512, 516–17 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (allowing son of deceased FOIA requester to be substituted as the\n\nplaintiff in FOIA litigation if the lower court determined that he was his father’s legal\n\nrepresentative). Thus, although the D.C. Circuit clearly approved of the transferability of\n\ninterests in FOIA requests under certain limited circumstances in Sinito, the only case in this\n\nCircuit thus far to address whether FOIA requests may be assigned to a non-requesting party\n\nafter the request has been made, Feinman v. FBI, held that such assignments are not allowed.\n\nCloser examination of these two cases is warranted both to reconcile their holdings and to\n\nascertain guidance on the question before the Court.\n\n                       a)      Sinito and Feinman\n\n       The D.C. Circuit’s decision in Sinito established a limited right to transfer interests in\n\nFOIA requests. That case involved a FOIA request made by a prisoner, seeking information\n\nabout the criminal investigation that had resulted in his incarceration. See Sinito, 176 F.3d at\n\n513. The original requester had exhausted his administrative remedies and filed suit in federal\n\ncourt, but he died in prison before his protracted litigation had been resolved. Id. The late\n\nprisoner’s counsel moved to substitute the prisoner’s son as the plaintiff under Federal Rule of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fCivil Procedure 25, but the district court denied the motion. 11 Id. The D.C. Circuit reversed,\n\nholding that a FOIA action can survive a requester’s death so long as the party substituting for\n\nthe deceased requester “qualifies under Rule 25(a) as a legal representative eligible to continue\n\nthe action.” Id.\n\n         In so holding, the Circuit compared the structure and purpose of the FOIA with other\n\nclaims that survive death, such as claims under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure\n\nAct of 1959 (“LMRDA”), see Mallick v. Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 814 F.2d 674, 677 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1987), or Bivens actions, see Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 24–25 (1980). See Sinito, 176\n\nF.3d at 513–15. The Court also noted that the strong apparent identity of interests between the\n\nproposed substitute party and the original requestor was strong, id. at 515 (“[W]e are dealing\n\nhere not with a vast pool of potential FOIA applicants, any of whom might seek to take [the\n\noriginal requester’s] place in the litigation.”), and that the original requester had “invested time,\n\nand in all likelihood money, in the action,” and therefore he “ha[d] a stake in the legal action\n\nwhich transcend[ed] that of ‘any person’ who might seek the FOIA document,” id. Finally, the\n\nCourt notably drew a favorable comparison between FOIA actions and “action[s] sounding in\n\nproperty rights . . . seeking money rather than information,” in which “there would be little\n\ndoubt” that the action would pass to the claimant’s estate. Id. The Court concluded that, even\n\nthough a FOIA request seeks information rather than money, information “in many cases has\n\nequal value with money or tangible property, and there is no reason, absent statutory preclusion,\n\nwhy it should not similarly survive.” Id.\n\n         The limits of a FOIA request’s transferability was once again addressed in Feinman,\n\nwhich involved a FOIA claim brought by a journalist (Feinman) who claimed that she had been\n\n11\n  Rule 25(a) provides that, when a party to an action dies before a claim is extinguished, “the court may order\nsubstitution of the proper party.” FED R. CIV. P. 25(a). The Rule further provides that “[a] motion for substitution\nmay be made by any party or by the decedent’s successor or representative.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                         25\n\fassigned the rights to the request in question by the original requester (Beirne) who was a non-\n\nparty to the lawsuit. Feinman, 680 F. Supp. 2d at 170–71. The FBI had denied Beirne’s request\n\nwithout any right of appeal because the request sought information about a suspected terrorist,\n\nbut no proof of the suspected terrorist’s death or a signed privacy waiver had been submitted\n\nwith the request. Id. at 171. Several months later, Feinman notified the FBI that Beirne had\n\n“assigned her rights and interests in the FOIA request to Feinman.” Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Feinman then sued the FBI, claiming that she had a “legal right under FOIA ‘to obtain\n\nthe information she seeks.’” Id. The FBI moved to dismiss on standing grounds because\n\nFeinman’s “name ‘did not appear on the original request.” Id.\n\n       Although the FBI based its arguments for dismissal solely on Feinman’s lack of statutory\n\nstanding, the court held that “strong policy concerns counsel[ed] against permitting assignments”\n\nof FOIA requests. Id. at 175. In particular, the court identified two principal policy\n\nconsiderations that counseled against assignments. First, the court noted that the identity of a\n\nFOIA requester is highly relevant in determining whether the requester is required to pay fees,\n\nsee 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A), and whether an agency discloses certain privileged documents to\n\n“‘first-party’ requesters who are the very persons protected by the privilege.” Feinman, 680 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 175. Thus, the court reasoned, allowing assignment of FOIA requests would\n\npotentially allow assignees to “share” (i.e., free-ride upon) an original requester’s favorable fee\n\nstatus and would force FOIA administrators to “risk litigation if they subsequently determined\n\nthat privacy or similar exemptions should be invoked against the third-party assignee.” Id.\n\nSecond, the court stated that allowing assignments of FOIA requests would “multiply\n\nopportunities for mistake and mischief” because allowing assignments would potentially allow\n\nan individual to “thwart an adversary’s search for information by claiming falsely to have been\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fassigned a previous requester's FOIA rights,” and would concomitantly place an undue burden\n\non FOIA administrators to “verify the validity of an assignment by determining whether it\n\ncomplies with local law and reflects the original requester's actual intent.” Id. at 175–76.\n\n       The Feinman court also discussed the Sinito case at length, distinguishing it on two\n\ngrounds. The court first noted that, unlike the deceased original requester in Sinito, the original\n\nrequester in Feinman (Beirne) “did not invest any time, money, or other effort into pursuing this\n\nlitigation” and thus never acquired a stake in the litigation “that might counsel against letting her\n\ninvestment of litigation resources go to waste.” Id. at 174. The court also noted that, unlike\n\nSinito, “there is no allegation that [Beirne] was incapable of protecting her rights by suing on her\n\nown behalf, or that the relationship between Beirne and Feinman is such that Feinman would\n\nprotect Beirne’s interests if their interests diverge.” Id. at 175. Ultimately, the Feinman court\n\ndrew a distinction between a situation “where the plaintiff claims to act on behalf of the original\n\nrequester,” as was the case in Sinito, as opposed to “act[ing] in her own right.” Id.\n\n                       b)      The Applicability of Feinman\n\n       Despite the thoughtful consideration of this issue by the court in Feinman, neither the\n\npolicy considerations discussed in Feinman nor the grounds it cited for distinguishing the\n\nholding in Sinito are sufficient to deny the validity of the plaintiff’s assignment in this case.\n\nStarting with the Feinman court’s discussion of Sinito, there are a number of major differences\n\nbetween Feinman and the instant case that distinguish Feinman’s analysis of Sinito. First and\n\nforemost, this case involves an assignment between two non-profit organizations, rather than an\n\nassignment between individuals. Recognizing that human beings, rather than corporate entities,\n\nperform the actual work on FOIA requests, an organizational interest in a FOIA request may\n\noften be attached to the work of a single employee or small group of employees who, in turn,\n\nmay choose to perform their work for more than one organizational principal while a request is\n\n\n                                                  27\n\fpending. Thus, as the plaintiff points out, not honoring the assignability of FOIA requests\n\nbetween organizations, when the sole reason for the assignment is to keep a request with the\n\nperson or persons who have assumed stewardship of that request, could present a large swath of\n\nprofessional FOIA requesters with a Morton’s fork: either forfeit the freedom to transfer\n\norganizations or forfeit the right to pursue a pending request for information under the FOIA. 12\n\nThe former option would needlessly and severely restrict employees’ freedom to change\n\norganizations, while the latter option would undermine the essential purpose of the FOIA.\n\n         Relatedly, this case involves two organizations that employed the same individual (Mr.\n\nMcClanahan) who had primary responsibility for filing and administratively pursuing the request\n\nat issue. By virtue of the extensive time and effort Mr. McClanahan has already invested in this\n\nrequest, see Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 26, it is clear that the plaintiff, through the efforts of its agent, has\n\nacquired a stake in the litigation, unlike the plaintiff in Feinman. Finally, unlike the parties in\n\nFeinman who alleged no relationship to each other whatsoever, the common bonds connecting\n\nJMP and NSC—the two organizations share the same Deputy Executive Director (Bradley\n\nMoss), and the Executive Director of JMP (Mark Zaid) also serves on the plaintiff’s Board of\n\nAdvisors, see Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 24—establishes that their relationship “is such that [NSC]\n\nwould protect [JMP’s] interests if their interests diverge.” See Feinman, 680 F. Supp. 2d at 175.\n\n         More fundamentally, the Court believes that Feinman did not account fully for the D.C.\n\nCircuit’s acknowledgement in Sinito that a claim for information and a claim for money or\n\n12\n  See Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 25–26. The plaintiff offers the example of a journalist who files a FOIA request in her\nnewspaper’s name and then goes to work for a new newspaper. See id. This situation would apply equally to an\nacademic who works for multiple institutions of higher learning, a lawyer who works for more than one law firm, or\nany number of other situations that could arise in the context of FOIA litigation. Another scenario likely to arise in\nFOIA litigation would be that Corporation A requests information (e.g., relating to a government contract that the\ncorporation did not secure in a bidding process) and, after the request is filed, Corporation A merges with\nCorporation B, such that Corporation A ceases to exist. Under the rule articulated in Feinman, the successor\ncorporation (Corporation B) would have to start the process all over again, even if the request had been outstanding\nfor several months or years.\n\n\n\n                                                         28\n\ftangible property are substantially similar in many cases. See Sinito, 176 F.3d at 515. The\n\nlogical result of the Circuit’s reasoning in Sinito is that courts should treat FOIA claims like\n\nclaims to tangible property unless doing so would contravene public policy or undermine the\n\n“institutional interests” of the judiciary in regulating which parties have standing to sue. See\n\nid. 13 Hence, the Court now turns to the policy considerations raised in Feinman to determine\n\nwhether assignability of FOIA requests would be appropriate in this case.\n\n         The Court certainly agrees with Feinman that the identity of a FOIA requester is relevant\n\nto certain aspects of the processing of the request, such as the assessment of fees and the\n\napplication of exemptions for privilege or privacy concerns. Nevertheless, the Court does not\n\nagree that these concerns warrant a blanket prohibition against the assignment of FOIA requests.\n\nFederal agencies are more than capable of developing efficient procedures to ensure that\n\nassignees do not free-ride on an original requestor’s fee status or improperly seek private or\n\nprivileged information. For example, agencies could easily require assignees, as a matter of\n\nstandard procedure, to submit any information necessary for the agency to update the aspects of\n\nan assigned request that turn on a requester’s identity. If an agency were to determine from this\n\ninformation that an assignee was not entitled to a fee waiver that had applied to the original\n\nrequester or that an assignee did not enjoy “first party” access to the original requester’s private\n\nor privileged information, the agency could simply adjust its disposition of the request\n\naccordingly.\n\n13\n   Under general principles of assignment, the fact that Sinito held that FOIA requests survive death could be\nconsidered prima facie support for the proposition that such requests are assignable. This is because survivability of\na right typically indicates that the right is not “purely personal,” and thus generally assignable. See Barnes Coal\nCorp. v. Retail Coal Merchants Ass’n, 128 F.2d 645, 649 (4th Cir. 1942) (holding that the “modern rule as to\nsurvivability” is that actions for “personal wrongs . . . die with the person,” whereas actions “affecting property\nright’s” survive); RTC Commercial Loan Trust 1995-NP1A v. Winthrop Mgmt., 923 F. Supp. 83, 88 (E.D. Va. 1996)\n(“purely personal” rights may not be assigned, such as a plaintiff’s right to invoke federal diversity jurisdiction by\nvirtue of his domicile); 6A C.J.S. Assignment § 49 (2012) (“A statutory right of action is generally assignable,” but\n“a statutory cause of action is not assignable if it is personal to one who holds it and it would not survive his or her\ndeath” (citing Strickland v. Sellers, 78 F. Supp. 274 (N.D. Tex. 1948))).\n\n\n\n                                                          29\n\f       For similar reasons, the Court believes that the potential for an increase in “opportunities\n\nfor mistake and mischief” resulting from the recognition of assignment rights is minimal. The\n\nFeinman court may have been correct in noting that, if FOIA administrators were to take an\n\nindividual’s claim to an assignment of rights “at face value,” any stranger could step in to\n\nexclude an original requester from the FOIA process against her will. See Feinman, 680 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 175–76. Even so, nothing would require an agency to take such claims “at face\n\nvalue.” On the contrary, FOIA administrators should require proper documentation of an\n\nassignment for it to be recognized—most likely a notarized statement from the original requester\n\nthat specifically identifies the assignee and the rights assigned. Cf. 31 U.S.C. § 3727(b) (laying\n\nout requirements for assignment of money claims against the United States government).\n\n       The Feinman court was nevertheless concerned that this validation process would\n\nconstitute an “unreasonable” burden on busy FOIA administrators and that such a burden would\n\nbe “greater than the minimal burden on any given assignee to make her own FOIA request.”\n\nFeinman, 680 F. Supp. 2d at 176. That balancing of the equities, however, does not fully\n\naccount for the realities of FOIA litigation and the central animating purposes of the FOIA. The\n\nburden imposed by requiring an assignee to file a new request and wait at the back of the FOIA\n\nline is not “minimal” in most cases. Although filing a new FOIA request may often involve a\n\nsmall amount of effort or resources, it exacts a temporal cost on FOIA requesters that should not\n\nbe discounted, considering that the FOIA was intended to promote not merely disclosure, but\n\ntimely disclosure. See H.R. Rep. No. 93-876, at 6 (1974) (“[I]nformation is often useful only if it\n\nis timely.”); Payne, 837 F.2d at 494 (“[S]tale information is of little value yet more costly than\n\nfresh information ought to be.”). To cite a relevant example, although the CIA takes an average\n\nof 143 days to respond to “complex” FOIA requests in which information is granted, it can\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fsometimes take the better part of a decade, 14 and in this particular case, over four and a half years\n\nhave passed since the date JMP filed the original FOIA request.\n\n        Additionally, the burden imposed on FOIA administrators from processing assigned\n\nrequests is unlikely to become “unreasonable,” and may in fact be more efficient than the\n\nalternative. See, e.g., Sinito, 176 F.3d at 517 (“[I]t would seem to us more expeditious from the\n\ngovernment’s point of view to allow the [FOIA] appeal to be pursued on the record already made\n\nthan to begin the process all over again with a new requestor.”). Agencies can and should shift\n\nthe vast majority of any burden to the assignees themselves, requiring them to submit whatever\n\ndocumentation the agency deems sufficient to validate an assignment, as discussed above.\n\nAdditionally, the plaintiff’s representations indicate that federal agencies are already recognizing\n\nFOIA assignments. In particular, the plaintiff documents how several agencies within the United\n\nStates intelligence and law enforcement communities, including the Department of Justice\n\n(“DOJ”), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence\n\nAgency (“NGA”) have formally recognized the assignment of FOIA requests without any indicia\n\nof “mistake and mischief” or undue burden. See Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 14–19; id. Exs. A, B, I, K,\n\nM, N. Although the Court is mindful that the CIA may be able to demonstrate that recognizing\n\nassignments would categorically impose an undue burden on its FOIA administrators, that fact is\n\nnot apparent from the information available in the instant action. The Court holds that the\n\nplaintiff’s Assignment is valid and enforceable, and therefore the plaintiff has statutory standing\n\nto assert the claims alleged in No. 11-443. See Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex rel.\n\nStevens, 529 U.S. 765, 773 (2000) (“[T]he assignee of a claim has standing to assert the injury in\n\nfact suffered by the assignor.”).\n\n14\n  See Cent. Intelligence Agency, Freedom of Information Act Annual Report 17, 23 (2011), available at\nhttp://www.foia.cia.gov/txt/annual_report_2011.pdf. (noting at least ten FOIA requests that have been pending for\nover seven years).\n\n\n\n                                                        31\n\f               2.      Standing to Seek Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\n\n       The other standing issue raised by the CIA is with respect to the policy-or-practice claims\n\nin Nos. 11-444 and 11-445. The CIA asserts that the plaintiff lacks standing to assert those\n\npolicy-or-practice claims because the plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged a future injury that\n\nwould confer standing to seek prospective declaratory and injunctive relief. See Def.’s 444\n\nMem. at 6–12; Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 6–10. These claims include each cause of action related to:\n\nthe Aggregate Data Policy, the Administrative Appeals Policy, the Reasonably Describe Policy,\n\nthe Work With Policy, the Cut-Off Date Policy, the Blanket Processing Notes Exemption Policy,\n\nthe Blanket Reference Material Exemption Policy, the Glomar Response Policy, the Non-\n\nProvision of Completion Date Policy, the Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy, and the\n\nDocument-Level Exemption Policy. See supra Part I.\n\n       When a plaintiff seeks either injunctive or declaratory relief, it “must show [it] is\n\nsuffering an ongoing injury or faces an immediate threat of injury.” Dearth, 641 F.3d at 501.\n\nWhen a plaintiff seeks injunctive or declaratory relief specifically for the purpose of challenging\n\nan alleged policy or practice of a government agency, it must also demonstrate that it is\n\n“‘realistically threatened by a repetition of [its] experience.’” Haase v. Sessions, 835 F.2d 902,\n\n910–11 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (quoting Lyons, 461 U.S. at 109). To plead a “threat of repetition,” a\n\nplaintiff must make “more than a nebulous assertion of the existence of a ‘policy,’” and that it is\n\n“likely to be subjected to the policy again.” Id. at 911. This threat must be “real and\n\nimmediate,” or, alternatively, “realistic[]” in nature. See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 109; Golden v.\n\nZwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 109 (1969); see also Fair Emp’t Council of Greater Wash., Inc. v. BMC\n\nMktg. Corp., 28 F.3d 1268, 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (observing that the standard for judging\n\nlikelihood of future injury has been formulated as “likely,” “fairly probable,” and “certainly\n\nimpending” and collecting cases).\n\n\n                                                 32\n\f         First, in No. 11-444, the CIA half-heartedly argues that the plaintiff has failed to allege\n\npatterns or practices that will continue to be applied in the future. 15 As the plaintiff points out,\n\n“the extent of the Defendant’s argument to the contrary is its talismanic attachment of the word\n\n‘alleged’ to any mention of pattern or practice,” and “with one slight exception, Defendant does\n\nnot actually state that any of the alleged patterns or practices do not exist, and in fact spends most\n\nof the second half of its brief defending them.” Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 8–9. The closest the CIA\n\ncomes to contesting the plaintiff’s allegations of ongoing patterns or practices alleged in No. 11-\n\n444 is to argue that the plaintiff “cannot rely on speculation as to how the CIA will react to a\n\nfuture or hypothetical FOIA request.” Def.’s 444 Mem. at 10–11. Although nearly any\n\nallegation about future conduct involves some measure of conjecture in a literal sense, because\n\nno mere mortal has the ability to see into the future, the plaintiff is only required to put forth a\n\nplausible, “more than . . . nebulous” assertion of the existence of an ongoing pattern or practice\n\nto establish standing, and the plaintiff has done so here. In fact, the plaintiff details, in its\n\nopposition briefs, specific instances of conduct by the CIA that the plaintiff claims are\n\nmanifestations of the alleged policies and practices at issue, most of which are also alleged in the\n\nplaintiff’s Complaints. 16 This is more than sufficient to plead the existence of ongoing patterns\n\nor practices for the purpose of establishing standing. See Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals, 402\n\nF.3d at 1253 (court may consider “materials outside the pleadings” in deciding a motion to\n\ndismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction).\n\n\n\n\n15\n  The standard for pleading the existence of a pattern or practice for purposes of establishing standing to seek\nprospective relief is not necessarily identical to the standard for pleading a policy or practice to establish the right to\nPayne-style relief.\n16\n See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 10–15; Pl.’s Opp’n to Defs.’ Partial Mot. Dismiss (“Pl.’s 445 Opp’n”) at 9–11, NSC III,\nECF No. 18.\n\n\n\n                                                            33\n\f        The CIA focuses its standing argument on the likelihood that the plaintiff will be subject\n\nto these policies in the future. It argues that, because the plaintiff has not alleged that it regularly\n\nsubmits or intends to submit requests that would implicate the alleged policies or practices, its\n\nclaimed future injury is insufficient. See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 9–12; Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 7. The\n\nCIA relies heavily on three FOIA cases from this Court to support its argument: Quick v. U.S.\n\nDepartment of Commerce, 775 F. Supp. 2d 174 (D.D.C. 2011); Citizens for Responsibility and\n\nEthics in Washington v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“CREW/DHS”), 527 F. Supp.\n\n2d 101 (D.D.C. 2007); and American Historical Association v. National Archives and Records\n\nAdministration, 310 F. Supp. 2d 216 (D.D.C. 2004). None of these cases, however, aids the\n\nCIA’s standing argument.\n\n        First, with regard to all but one alleged policy or practice, the Quick case is immediately\n\ndistinguishable because, in that case, the record at the summary judgment stage was “clear” that,\n\n“even assuming that individuals other than [the plaintiff] may have been subject to the alleged\n\n‘pattern or practice,’” the plaintiff had not been subject to it. Quick, 775 F. Supp. 2d at 187.\n\nAlthough the policy alleged in Quick was that the agency “produc[ed] records only after a\n\nrequester takes the step of commencing a lawsuit,” the record had demonstrated that the agency\n\n“began processing [the plaintiff’s] request long before the commencement of the instant action\n\nand consistently and diligently worked towards completing that request in the absence of\n\nlitigation.” Id. Therefore, Quick’s citation to Lujan and its statement that the Supreme Court has\n\n“foreclosed” the possibility of standing when a plaintiff only offers a “passing allegation that he\n\n‘plans to file additional FOIA requests to the [agency] in the future,’” are dicta. This dicta is\n\nitself distinguishable in any event because, as discussed infra, the plaintiff has alleged the\n\nexistence of ongoing FOIA requests directed at the CIA. Thus, the Supreme Court’s admonition\n\n\n\n\n                                                  34\n\fin Lujan regarding “‘some day’ intentions” is inapplicable to the instant actions because the\n\nhypothetical “some day” has already arrived. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564.\n\n       Additionally, all three cases cited by the CIA are distinguishable because in all three\n\ncases the plaintiffs never alleged or demonstrated that they had any outstanding FOIA requests\n\n(other than the requests challenged in the litigation) that were likely to implicate the alleged\n\npolicies and lead to future injury. See Quick, 775 F. Supp. 2d at 187 (stating that plaintiff\n\n“plan[ned] to file additional FOIA requests to the [defendant] in the future,” though none had\n\nactually been filed); CREW/DHS, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 106 (“Most notably, CREW does not allege\n\nanywhere in its complaint or opposition brief that it has a FOIA request pending with the\n\nDHS . . . .”); American Historical Association, 310 F. Supp. 2d at 228 (“At this stage Plaintiffs\n\nhave no outstanding requests for presidential records . . . .”). Recent cases have clarified that,\n\nwhere a FOIA requester challenges an alleged ongoing policy or practice and can demonstrate\n\nthat it has pending claims that are likely to implicate that policy or practice, future injury is\n\nsatisfied. See Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n\n\n(“CREW/SEC”), 858 F. Supp. 2d 51, 60 (D.D.C. 2012) (holding that “outstanding FOIA requests\n\nthat involve documents that likely will be unavailable due to the challenged policy” are sufficient\n\nto allege future injury); Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Exec. Office of the\n\nPresident (“CREW/EOP”), 587 F. Supp. 2d 48, 60–61 (D.D.C. 2008) (holding that, because\n\nplaintiffs “each allege that they have FOIA requests for e-mails currently pending with the\n\n[defendant agencies] and intend to file future requests,” their allegations of future injury were\n\n“real and immediate” (quoting Pub. Citizen v. Carlin, 2 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 1997))).\n\n       The plaintiff has done just this by stating that, as of July 2011, it had already submitted\n\nfifteen FOIA requests to the CIA since filing the Complaints in these actions. See Pl.’s 444\n\n\n\n\n                                                  35\n\fOpp’n at 18; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 14. The plaintiff has also displayed a clear intent to continue\n\nfiling FOIA requests with the CIA, supported by its consistent habit of filing such requests both\n\nbefore and after the commencement of this litigation and its stated mission “to obtain records\n\nabout national security issues.” See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 18; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 14. Furthermore,\n\nthe Court finds that these ongoing actions and stated intentions to take future action are likely to\n\nimplicate the claimed policies and practices at issue because the pending and future requests\n\nappear to be of the same character as the specific requests that form the basis of the plaintiff’s\n\ncurrent claims. See, e.g., Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 18 (stating that the plaintiff has submitted at least\n\none other request for “aggregate data”); id. at 19 (stating that the plaintiff has submitted two\n\nrequests that were determined to “not reasonably describe the records sought”). Therefore, with\n\nthe exception of one policy or practice claim discussed below, the Court concludes that these\n\nactions and stated intentions are sufficiently concrete for the Court to conclude that the plaintiff\n\nhas alleged a real and immediate threat of future injury resulting from the alleged policies and\n\npractices of the CIA. Although it is true, as the CIA points out, that “‘[t]he existence of federal\n\njurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed,’” Lujan,\n\n504 U.S. at 569 n.4 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490\n\nU.S. 826, 830 (1989)), when a plaintiff alleges a future injury, common sense dictates that a\n\ncourt can and should consider the activities of the plaintiff during and after the time that the\n\ncomplaint is filed in order to assess the likelihood of such a future injury.\n\n       The one exception to this holding is the alleged Non-Provision of Completion Date\n\nPolicy. With respect to that alleged policy, the plaintiff claims that the CIA has a policy or\n\npractice of refusing to provide estimated dates of completion for pending FOIA requests. See\n\nFAC ¶¶ 99–116, NSC III. In particular, the plaintiff claims that the CIA consistently refused to\n\n\n\n\n                                                  36\n\fsupply the plaintiff with estimate dates of completion for its pending FOIA requests “[u]ntil\n\nNovember 2010,” and that although the CIA instituted a policy in November 2010 to “inform\n\nrequesters that the estimated date of completion for any given request is two years from CIA’s\n\ndate of receipt,” the CIA has continued to refuse requesters’ demands for estimated dates of\n\ncompletion. Id. ¶¶ 101–104. The problem, however, is that the plaintiff’s factual allegations, in\n\nsupport of the claim that the CIA continues to refuse to provide estimated dates of completion\n\nsince the promulgation of its November 2010 informal guidance, relate solely to FOIA requests\n\nfiled by other parties. The plaintiff cites requests filed by non-parties JMP and Michael\n\nRadvintzky, as well as those non-parties’ post-November 2010 requests for estimated dates of\n\ncompletion, to support its claim that the CIA continues to refuse to provide estimated dates of\n\ncompletion. Yet, these allegations fail to allege a cognizable injury against the plaintiff because\n\n“even assuming that individuals other than [the plaintiff] may have been subject to the alleged\n\n‘pattern or practice,’” the plaintiff has not alleged that it has been subject to the post-November\n\n2010 policy that it seeks to challenge. See Quick, 775 F. Supp. 2d at 187. Without an allegation\n\nthat the plaintiff itself has been subject to the CIA’s post-November 2010 Non-Provision of\n\nCompletion Date Policy, the plaintiff has no standing to bring its claim challenging that policy.\n\nTherefore, the causes of action related to the Non-Provision of Completion Date Policy (Counts\n\nFifteen, Sixteen, and Seventeen of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-445) will be\n\ndismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n       B.      Mandamus and Administrative Procedure Act Claims\n\n       Having addressed all of the CIA’s standing arguments, the Court will now address the\n\nCIA’s arguments for dismissing all of the remaining policy-or-practice claims summarized above\n\nunder Rules 12(b)(1) and/or 12(b)(6).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 37\n\f        As discussed above, the plaintiff has elected to seek relief from a number of the alleged\n\npolicies or practices of the CIA under a variety of legal theories. In addition to the Assignment\n\nof Rights Policy and Non-Provision of Completion Date Policy addressed and resolved above,\n\nthe plaintiff claims ten separate policies or practices that it says violate the FOIA. The plaintiff\n\nseeks relief from each of these alleged policies or practices under the FOIA itself, but it also\n\nseeks relief from four of the policies or practices under the Mandamus Act, 17 and it seeks relief\n\nfrom seven of the policies or practices under the APA. 18 The plaintiff concedes that, because\n\nthese claims are duplicative of one another, to the extent it is granted relief at all, such relief will\n\nbe pursuant to only one of these statutes. See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 7; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 7. The\n\nCourt will first address the viability of the plaintiff’s APA claims and then will discuss the\n\nviability of the plaintiff’s Mandamus Act claims.\n\n                 1.       Administrative Procedure Act Claims\n\n        The CIA moves to dismiss the plaintiff’s seven remaining APA claims on the basis that\n\nthe Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over those claims. These are the APA claims related\n\nto: the Aggregate Data Policy (Count Three of No. 11-444), the Administrative Appeals Policy\n\n(Count Six of No. 11-444), the Reasonably Describe Policy (Count Twelve of No. 11-444), the\n\nWork With Policy (Count Fifteen of No. 11-444), the Withheld Document Non-Identification\n\nPolicy (Count Nineteen of No. 11-445), the Document-Level Exemption Policy (Count Twenty-\n\nOne of No. 11-445), and the APA component of the challenge to the Glomar Response Policy\n\n\n\n\n17\n The four policies or practices challenged under the Mandamus Act are: the Aggregate Data Policy, the\nAdministrative Appeals Policy, the Reasonably Describe Policy, and the Work With Policy.\n18\n   The seven policies or practices challenged under the APA include the same four policies or practices challenged\nunder the Mandamus Act, as well as: the Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy, the Document-Level\nExemption Policy, and the APA component of the “FOIA/APA” challenge to the Glomar Response Policy.\n\n\n\n                                                        38\n\f(Count Fourteen of No. 11-445). 19 The CIA argues that the APA’s waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity does not apply to the plaintiff’s APA causes of action because the availability of a\n\nremedy for the plaintiff’s policy-or-practice claims under the FOIA and Payne means that the\n\nplaintiff’s corresponding APA claims are not claims “for which there is no other adequate\n\nremedy.” See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 3–4 (citing 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704); Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 3–4\n\n(same). According to the CIA, because “[a]ll . . . of [the plaintiff’s] APA claims, and the APA\n\ncomponent of its ‘FOIA/APA’ claim, are based on alleged violations of the FOIA and seek relief\n\navailable under the FOIA,” the APA claims should be dismissed. Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 4. The\n\nplaintiff responds that the CIA’s “statement that the mere fact that an APA claim ‘is premised on\n\na violation of FOIA’ is automatically fatal to that claim is fundamentally incorrect” because\n\n“FOIA does not provide an alternative remedy in all cases.” Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 6; Pl.’s 445\n\nOpp’n at 6. The plaintiff thus argues that if the Court were to “find that the alleged pattern or\n\npractice does not fit squarely within the four corners of FOIA’s remedies,” that would “remove it\n\nfrom Payne-style declaratory relief,” and therefore no other adequate remedy would be available.\n\nPl.’s 444 Opp’n at 7; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 7.\n\n        The CIA is correct that, where a plaintiff claims that an agency has wrongfully withheld\n\nagency records in connection with discrete FOIA requests, an APA claim seeking compelled\n\ndisclosure of the withheld records is precluded. See, e.g., Kenney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 603 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 184, 190 (D.D.C 2009). This is because the FOIA grants federal courts jurisdiction to\n\n“enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency\n\nrecords improperly withheld from the complainant.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). The D.C. Circuit\n\nin Payne, however, held that “[t]he FOIA imposes no limits on courts’ equitable powers in\n\n19\n  Count Fourteen of No. 11-445, challenging the CIA’s alleged Glomar Response Policy is captioned as a\n“FOIA/APA” cause of action, so the Court will only address the APA element of that hybrid claim in this section of\nthe opinion. See FAC at 14, NSC III.\n\n\n\n                                                       39\n\fenforcing its terms,” and where an agency’s actions in response to a FOIA request “violate the\n\nintent and purpose of the FOIA . . . the courts have a duty to prevent these abuses.” Payne, 837\n\nF.2d at 494; see also Wash. Research Project, Inc. v. Dep’t of Health, Educ. & Welfare, 504 F.2d\n\n238, 252 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (“One can imagine circumstances, such as where an agency simply\n\nrefuses to conform its action to the known requirements of the [FOIA] in order to deter requests\n\nfor information by repetitive litigation, that would tempt a court to use any or all of the usual\n\nweapons in the arsenal of equity.”(internal quotation marks omitted)). Therefore, although the\n\nlanguage of the FOIA could be read strictly to limit the equitable powers of federal courts to\n\nenjoining the agency from withholding records and ordering production of improperly withheld\n\nrecords, the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court have interpreted those equitable powers more\n\nbroadly. See Renegotiation Bd. v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 19–20 (1974) (holding\n\nthat “[t]he broad language of the FOIA,” among other factors, demonstrate that “there is little to\n\nsuggest, despite the Act’s primary purpose, that Congress sought to limit the inherent powers of\n\nan equity court”).\n\n       The scope of the equitable powers available under the FOIA is nevertheless still unclear\n\nbecause the D.C. Circuit has yet to specify the breadth of Payne-style relief. The only concrete\n\nguidance has been from Payne itself, which stated that FOIA policy-or-practice claims extend to\n\nany “failure to abide by the terms of the FOIA.” Payne, 837 F.2d at 491. This Court has\n\npreviously held that “where a plaintiff challenges an alleged pattern and practice of violating\n\nprocedural requirements of FOIA in connection with the processing of the plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequests[,] the Court has the power under FOIA and Payne to provide the requested declaratory\n\nand injunctive remedies.” Muttitt v. U.S. Cent. Command, 813 F. Supp. 2d 221, 229 (D.D.C.\n\n2011); see also Feinman v. FBI, 713 F. Supp. 2d 70, 78 (D.D.C. 2010) (dismissing APA policy-\n\n\n\n\n                                                 40\n\for-practice claim because “the relief available under FOIA is of the ‘same genre’ as the relief\n\navailable under the APA” (quoting Garcia v. Vilsack, 563 F.3d 519, 522 (D.C. Cir. 2009))).\n\nThus, under Muttitt, the Court has the power to enjoin a FOIA procedural violation under the\n\nequitable jurisdiction of the FOIA itself so long as that violation was “in connection with the\n\nprocessing of the plaintiff’s FOIA requests.” Muttitt, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 229. Indeed, this Court\n\nstated in Muttitt that, even though a policy or practice “would not necessarily result directly in\n\n[the] withholding [of agency records],” it nevertheless falls within the Court’s broad equitable\n\npowers under the FOIA. Id. at 228–29 & n.4.\n\n       This conclusion is supported by the fact that it is well settled that courts have certain\n\nequitable powers under the FOIA that extend beyond the literal bounds of 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(B). Most notably, courts clearly have the power to order an agency to re-run a\n\nsearch for records where that search was not “reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant\n\ndocuments.’” See Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108, 1114 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Weisberg v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, 705 F.2d 1344, 1351 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). Although ordering an agency to\n\nconduct an adequate search may indirectly lead to the production of responsive records, see\n\nMaydak v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 254 F. Supp. 2d 23, 44 (D.D.C 2003) (holding that “[a]n\n\nimproper withholding may arise from an agency’s failure to conduct an adequate search”\n\n(emphasis added)), such injunctive relief does not necessarily “enjoin the agency from\n\nwithholding agency records” or “order the production of any agency records.” See 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(B). Similarly, remedying procedural violations of the FOIA may not necessarily\n\nlead to the production of withheld responsive records, yet it is concomitantly reasonable to\n\ninterpret the jurisdictional grant in 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) to include the power to enjoin\n\nprocedural violations of the FOIA when they are connected to specific requests for records.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\f        As in Muttitt, for each of the remaining policy-or-practice claims in the instant cases the\n\nplaintiff alleges that the CIA has applied the policy or practice to one or more specific FOIA\n\nrequests made by the plaintiff. Hence, all of the alleged policies or practices challenged in the\n\ninstant actions are “in connection with the processing of the plaintiff’s FOIA requests.” 20\n\nMuttitt, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 229. Additionally, all but one of the policy-or-practice claims alleges\n\na violation of “procedural requirements of the FOIA.” The only exception are the claims related\n\nto the Work With Policy (Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, and Sixteen of No. 11-444), which allege a\n\npolicy or practice of the CIA violating its own FOIA regulation, 32 C.F.R. § 1900.12(c), not the\n\nprocedural requirements of the FOIA itself. See FAC ¶¶ 71–86, NSC II. Therefore, the Court\n\n“has the power under FOIA and Payne to provide the requested declaratory and injunctive\n\nremedies” with respect to all of the policy-or-practice claims except the claims related to the\n\nWork With Policy, which are properly addressed under the APA. Muttitt, 813 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n229. As a result of this conclusion, APA relief is foreclosed with respect to the Aggregate Data\n\nPolicy, the Administrative Appeals Policy, the Reasonably Describe Policy, the Withheld\n\nDocument Non-Identification Policy, the Document-Level Exemption Policy, and the Glomar\n\nResponse Policy because the FOIA itself can provide the plaintiff with an adequate equitable\n\nremedy, assuming of course that the plaintiff has stated a claim for relief with respect to each of\n\nthose policies. Therefore, all of the plaintiff’s APA claims related to those policies—Counts\n\n\n20\n   The claims related to the Reasonably Describe Policy (Counts Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen of No. 11-444),\nhowever, could be considered as a more general challenge to agency action. Those claims challenge the CIA’s\nformal interpretation of the term “reasonably describe” and allege that interpretation is “significantly and\nconsistently broader than is allowed by FOIA.” See FAC ¶¶ 58, 63, NSC II. This sort of across-the-board challenge\nto an agency’s formal interpretation of a statute is “typically seen in litigation under the [APA], as the APA\nexpressly provides for such judicial review.” Bensman v. Nat’l Park Serv., 806 F. Supp. 2d 31, 41 (D.D.C 2011).\nNevertheless, although the plaintiff’s challenge to the Reasonably Describe Policy may have broader application, it\nstill challenges a policy that is allegedly being applied “in connection with the processing of the plaintiff’s FOIA\nrequests” and that is allegedly “violating procedural requirements of FOIA.” Muttitt, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 229. Thus,\nthe Court is satisfied that this sort of challenge is within the Court’s jurisdiction under the FOIA, even though it\nwould also clearly fall within the Court’s jurisdiction under the APA.\n\n\n\n                                                        42\n\fThree, Six, and Twelve of No. 11-444, Counts Nineteen and Twenty-One of No. 11-445, and the\n\nAPA component of the “FOIA/APA” claim in Count Fourteen of No. 11-445—will be dismissed\n\nfor lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Likewise, because the claims related to the Work With\n\nPolicy challenge conduct outside the Court’s FOIA jurisdiction, the Court does not have the\n\npower to remedy the FOIA claim related to that policy (Count Fourteen of No. 11-444). Hence,\n\nCount Fourteen of No. 11-444 will also be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n                 2.       Mandamus Act Claims\n\n        The CIA also moves to dismiss the plaintiff’s four remaining Mandamus Act claims on\n\nthe grounds that the plaintiff has failed to plead a claim for relief under that statute and that the\n\nCourt lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over those claims. See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 5–6; Defs.’\n\n445 Mem. at 5–6. This includes the Mandamus Act claims related to the Aggregate Data Policy\n\n(Count Four of No. 11-444), the Administrative Appeals Policy (Count Seven of No. 11-444),\n\nthe Reasonably Describe Policy (Count Thirteen of No. 11-444), and the Work With Policy\n\n(Count Sixteen of No. 11-444). To adequately plead a claim for relief under the Mandamus Act,\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1361, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) the plaintiff has a clear right to relief; (2) the\n\ndefendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) there is no other adequate remedy available to the\n\nplaintiff. See In re Medicare Reimbursement Litig., 414 F.3d 7, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2005). 21 The D.C.\n\nCircuit has narrowly construed jurisdiction under the Mandamus Act, holding that mandamus-\n\nstyle relief 22 is “‘drastic’; it is available only in ‘extraordinary situations’; it is hardly ever\n\ngranted; those invoking the court’s mandamus jurisdiction must have a ‘clear and indisputable’\n\n21\n  The D.C. Circuit has held that, to the extent the court must determine whether a “clear and compelling” duty\nexists, “mandamus jurisdiction under § 1361 merges with the merits” because if no “clear and compelling” duty\nexists, the claim fails and the court also has no jurisdiction over the claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1361. See In re\nCheney, 406 F.3d 723, 729 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (en banc).\n22\n  The Court refers to it as “mandamus-style relief” because “Rule 81(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nlong ago abolished the writ of mandamus in the district courts,” and therefore the Mandamus Act “confers\njurisdiction on the district courts over actions ‘in the nature of mandamus.” In re Cheney, 406 F.3d at 728–29.\n\n\n\n                                                        43\n\fright to relief; and even if the plaintiff overcomes all these hurdles, whether mandamus relief\n\nshould issue is discretionary.” In re Cheney, 406 F.3d at 729; accord Allied Chem. Corp. v.\n\nDaiflon, Inc., 449 U.S. 33, 34 (1980) (“[T]he remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be\n\ninvoked only in extraordinary situations.”). Mandamus-style relief is precluded when an\n\nadequate alternative remedy exists, even where that alternative remedy is less efficient or less\n\neffective than mandamus relief would be. See Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63, 69–70 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2005); Council for the Blind of Del. Cnty. Valley, Inc. v. Regan, 709 F.2d 1521, 1532–33 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1983).\n\n       The CIA argues that the plaintiff has failed to plead any of the three required elements for\n\nany of its claims under the Mandamus Act. See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 5–6; Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 5–\n\n6. The plaintiff’s only response is to argue that, although its Mandamus Act claims are\n\nduplicative of its FOIA and APA claims, “this is not a fatal flaw in and of itself.” Pl.’s 444\n\nOpp’n at 4; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 4. In support of this argument, the plaintiff cites two cases from\n\nthis Court, which both refused to dismiss mandamus claims at the motion to dismiss stage. See\n\nPl.’s 444 Opp’n at 5 (citing Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Nat’l Energy Policy Dev. Grp., 219 F. Supp.\n\n2d 20, 44 (D.D.C 2002) and CREW/EOP, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 63); Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 5 (same).\n\nEven assuming that the plaintiff is correct that the duplicity of its mandamus claims “is not a\n\nfatal flaw in and of itself,” that does not address whether the plaintiff has adequately alleged\n\nmandamus claims in the first place.\n\n       The plaintiff does not contest that it has failed to satisfy the first two elements of a\n\nMandamus Act claim: a clear right to relief and a clear duty to act. Rather, the plaintiff only\n\naddresses the CIA’s arguments with respect to subject-matter jurisdiction and does not discuss\n\nthe CIA’s argument that the plaintiff has failed to state claims for mandamus-style relief. See\n\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n\fPl.’s 444 Opp’n at 4; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 4. 23 Indeed, the plaintiff’s citation to Judicial Watch,\n\nInc. v. National Energy Policy Development Group presumes that the plaintiff has already\n\npleaded claims for mandamus-style relief. Although that case held that “it would be premature\n\nand inappropriate to determine whether the relief of mandamus will or will not issue” at the\n\nmotion to dismiss stage, that holding was still premised on the determination “that plaintiffs have\n\nstated a claim for relief under the mandamus statute.” See 219 F. Supp. 2d at 44. The plaintiff’s\n\nmandamus claims in the instant actions may be dismissed on this ground alone because the Court\n\nmay treat the plaintiff’s failure to oppose the defendant’s 12(b)(6) arguments as a decision to\n\nconcede those arguments. See Shankar v. ACS-GSI, 258 F. App’x 344, 345 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\n\n(holding that plaintiff conceded the merits of an issue when he “did not respond in any way to\n\ndefendant’s argument” on that issue in his opposition before the district court (citing Local Civil\n\nRule 7(b))); Buggs v. Powell, 293 F. Supp. 2d 135, 141 (D.D.C. 2003) (“It is understood in this\n\nCircuit that when a plaintiff files an opposition to a dispositive motion and addresses only certain\n\narguments raised by the defendant, a court may treat those arguments that the plaintiff failed to\n\naddress as conceded.” (citing FDIC v. Bender, 127 F.3d 58, 67–68 (D.C. Cir. 1997))).\n\n        Even if the plaintiff had not conceded its failure to plead claims for relief under the\n\nMandamus Act, however, the mandamus claims would still be appropriately dismissed because\n\nthe plaintiff’s FOIA claims would provide an adequate remedy for all of the policies or practices\n\nfor which the plaintiff seeks relief under the Mandamus Act. The FOIA itself is the source of\n\nwhat the plaintiff views as the CIA’s clear duties to act and the plaintiff’s clear rights to relief,\n\nwhich underlie the plaintiff’s mandamus claims. See FAC ¶¶ 22, 25, 37, 39, 67, 69, 83, NSC II;\n\nFAC ¶¶ 113, 115, NSC III. Thus, to the extent a remedy would be available to the plaintiff under\n\n\n23\n  The CIA made it very clear in its motions to dismiss that it was seeking dismissal of the plaintiff’s mandamus\nclaims under both Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6). See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 5–6; Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 5–6.\n\n\n\n                                                        45\n\fthe Mandamus Act, an identical and adequate injunctive remedy would be available to the\n\nplaintiff under the FOIA. See Payne, 837 F.2d at 494 (“The FOIA imposes no limits on courts’\n\nequitable powers in enforcing its terms.”); Muttitt, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 228–29. Likewise to the\n\nextent that a remedy is unavailable to the plaintiff under the FOIA for any particular policy or\n\npractice, a remedy would be equally unavailable under the Mandamus Act. It necessarily\n\nfollows that the plaintiff cannot plead any facts that would show that there is no other adequate\n\nremedy available, and therefore all of the plaintiff’s remaining Mandamus Act claims—Counts\n\nFour, Seven, Thirteen, and Sixteen of No. 11-444—will be dismissed.\n\n        C.       Remaining Policy-or-Practice Claims\n\n        With the universe of remaining policy-or-practice claims now narrowed to the nine\n\ncauses of action alleged under the FOIA itself and the one cause of action under the APA, 24 the\n\nCourt will now discuss whether the plaintiff has succeeded in pleading a claim for relief for any\n\nof those alleged policies or practices. The CIA moves to dismiss each of these policy-or-practice\n\nclaims for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 12–20; Defs.’\n\n445 Mem. at 10–19.\n\n                 1.       Aggregate Data Policy\n\n        The plaintiff challenges the CIA’s alleged Aggregate Data Policy (i.e., refusing to\n\nprocess FOIA requests that seek “aggregate data”) in Count Two of No. 11-444. See FAC ¶¶ 12,\n\n14, NSC II. The requests for what the plaintiff terms “aggregate data” have sought database\n\nlistings sorted by various criteria. In particular, the plaintiff points to two examples of\n\n“aggregate data” requests that the CIA has refused to process: (1) a request for “database listings\n\nof all FOIA requesters from Fiscal Years 2008–2010 according to the fee categories to which\n\n\n24\n  Once again, these ten policies or practices exclude Assignment of Rights Policy discussed above. See discussion\nsupra Part III.A.1.\n\n\n\n                                                       46\n\fCIA assigned them,” and (2) a request for “a record that would indicate the ten individuals\n\nresponsible for the most FOIA requests submitted (each) in Fiscal Years 2008, 2009, and 2010.”\n\nId. ¶¶ 6, 42. The CIA refused to process these requests either on the grounds that its record\n\nsystems were not configured in a way that would allow it to perform an adequate search without\n\nan unreasonable effort or on the grounds that the FOIA does not require federal agencies to\n\ncreate records, collect information, conduct research, analyze data, or conduct unreasonable\n\nsearches. See Lutz Decl. Exs. E–H, L.\n\n       The CIA argues that the plaintiff’s challenge to the alleged Aggregate Data Policy should\n\nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim because, assuming that such a policy exists, it would not\n\nviolate the FOIA. See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 13–14. The CIA maintains that processing requests\n\nfor database listings would (a) require it to create new records, as opposed to merely producing\n\npreexisting records and/or (b) require it to conduct research, as opposed to merely performing a\n\nsearch. Id.; Reply in Supp. Def.’s Partial Mot. Dismiss Pl.’s First Am. Compl. (“Def.’s 444\n\nReply”) at 14, NSC II, ECF No. 18. The CIA further argues that, because the FOIA does not\n\nrequire agencies to create new records or conduct research, a policy of refusing to do so does not\n\nviolate the FOIA. Def.’s 444 Reply at 14. The plaintiff responds, however, that the act of\n\nsorting a database by certain criteria (e.g., fee category of requester) and providing a listing of\n\nthat database so sorted does not constitute creating new records or conducting research—rather,\n\nit merely constitutes performing a search and producing the results of that search. See Pl.’s 444\n\nOpp’n at 21.\n\n       The CIA is correct, and the plaintiff appears to agree, that “the FOIA imposes no duty on\n\nthe agency to create records.” Forsham v. Harris, 445 U.S. 169, 186 (1980) (citing NLRB v.\n\nSears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 161–62 (1975)); accord Yeager v. DEA, 678 F.2d 315, 321\n\n\n\n\n                                                  47\n\f(D.C. Cir. 1982) (“It is well settled that an agency is not required by FOIA to create a document\n\nthat does not exist in order to satisfy a request.”). The FOIA also does not require agencies to\n\nconduct research by “answer[ing] questions disguised as a FOIA request.” Hudgins v. IRS, 620\n\nF. Supp. 19, 21 (D.D.C. 1985), aff’d mem., 808 F.2d 137 (D.C. Cir. 1987); see also Frank v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Justice, 941 F. Supp. 4, 5 (1996) (holding that agencies are “not required, by FOIA or\n\nby any other statute, to dig out all the information that might exist, in whatever form or place it\n\nmight be found, and to create a document that answers plaintiff’s question”). The dispute with\n\nrespect to the alleged Aggregate Data Policy, however, is whether the plaintiff’s FOIA requests\n\nfor “aggregate data” require the CIA to create new records or conduct research to answer\n\nquestions.\n\n       The 1996 Electronic FOIA Amendments (“E-FOIA Amendments”) provide some useful\n\ncontext in understanding what is required of agencies in running searches in an era when\n\n“agencies increasingly use computers to conduct agency business and to store publicly valuable\n\nagency records and information.” Pub. L. No. 104-231, § 2(a)(5), 110 Stat. 3048, 3048 (1996).\n\nThe E-FOIA Amendments were intended to “maximize the usefulness of agency records and\n\ninformation collected, maintained, used, retained, and disseminated by the Federal Government.”\n\nId. § 2(b)(4), 110 Stat. at 3049. Congress provided in the Amendments that, “[g]overnment\n\nagencies should use new technology to enhance public access to agency records and\n\ninformation.” Id. § 2(a)(6), 110 Stat. at 3048. Thus, the Amendments expanded the definition of\n\na “record” to include “any information that would be an agency record . . . when maintained by\n\nan agency in any format, including an electronic format,” id. § 3, 110 Stat. at 3049 (emphasis\n\nadded), and they expanded the definition of “search” to mean “to review, manually or by\n\nautomated means,” id. § 5, 110 Stat. at 3050 (emphasis added). The Amendments also added the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 48\n\fprovision that, “[i]n responding . . . to a request for records, an agency shall make reasonable\n\nefforts to search for the records in electronic form or format, except when such efforts would\n\nsignificantly interfere with the operation of the agency’s automated information system.” Id. In\n\nlight of these changes to the FOIA regime, “[e]lectronic database searches are . . . not regarded\n\nas involving the creation of new records.” People for the Am. Way Found. v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nJustice, 451 F. Supp. 2d 6, 14 (D.D.C. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also H.R.\n\nRep. 104-795, at 22 (1996) (“Computer records found in a database rather than a file cabinet may\n\nrequire the application of codes or some form of programming to retrieve the information. . . .\n\n[T]he review of computerized records would not amount to the creation of records.”).\n\n       In responding to a FOIA request for “aggregate data,” therefore, an agency need not\n\ncreate a new database or a reorganize its method of archiving data, but if the agency already\n\nstores records in an electronic database, searching that database does not involve the creation of a\n\nnew record. Likewise, sorting a pre-existing database of information to make information\n\nintelligible does not involve the creation of a new record because, as Congress noted in the\n\nlegislative history to the E-FOIA Amendments, “[c]omputer records found in a database rather\n\nthan a file cabinet may require the application of codes or some form of programming to retrieve\n\nthe information.” H.R. Rep. 104-795, at 22. Sorting a database by a particular data field (e.g.,\n\ndate, category, title) is essentially “the application of codes or some form of programming,” and\n\nthus does not involve creating new records or conducting research—it is just another form of\n\nsearching that is within the scope of an agency’s duties in responding to FOIA requests.\n\n       Nevertheless, the distinction between searching and either performing research or\n\ncreating records remains somewhat muddled. In particular, there is a tension between the well-\n\nsettled prohibition against requiring agencies to conduct research and create records, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 49\n\fpolicy of the E-FOIA Amendments to bring the contents of electronic databases within the\n\nFOIA’s reach. When points of data are stored in a database, that data can often be manipulated\n\nin myriad ways, only some of which are likely to qualify as mere “searching” within the meaning\n\nof the FOIA. See, e.g., Labella v. FBI, No. 11-CV-0023, 2012 WL 948567 at *12 n.12\n\n(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2012) (observing that “FOIA did not obligate the [defendant] to provide [the\n\nplaintiff] with ‘aggregate data’” where the plaintiff sought “‘aggregate data’ related to the victim\n\nclass and distinct subgroups of” the Supplemental Victimization Survey to the National Crime\n\nVictimization Survey). Although the E-FOIA Amendments condone “the application of codes or\n\nsome form of programming to retrieve the information” contained in an electronic database,\n\nneither the text of the statute nor the legislative history provides any guidance on when the\n\nmanipulation of data points in an electronic database through “the application of codes or some\n\nform of programming” crosses the all-important line between searching a database, on the one\n\nhand, and either creating a record or conducting research in a database on the other.\n\n       With this tension in mind, although the act of searching or sorting an electronic database\n\nis clearly not the creation of a record under the FOIA, the question remains whether producing a\n\nlisting of database search results involves the creation of a record. First, it is important to note\n\nthat it is not unprecedented for a federal agency to produce entire fields of data from particular\n\nelectronic databases in response to a FOIA request, see, e.g., Long v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 450\n\nF. Supp. 2d 42, 48 (D.D.C. 2006) (DOJ produced several fields from “the EOUSA’s central case\n\nmanagement data under the FOIA”), and such requests could certainly be considered requests for\n\n“aggregate data.” Producing a listing or index of records, however, is different than producing\n\nparticular points of data (i.e., the records themselves). This is because a particular listing or\n\nindex of the contents of a database would not necessarily have existed prior to a given FOIA\n\n\n\n\n                                                  50\n\frequest. For example, a request seeking “a database listing of the first 100 FOIA requests filed\n\nin Fiscal Year 2012,” may require the creation of a new record because the record being\n\nrequested—whether produced in the format of a printout, a “screen shot,” or something similar—\n25\n     is not necessarily something “that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.” Yeager,\n\n678 F.2d at 321. The same would be true of paper, rather than electronic, records. For example,\n\nif a FOIA request sought “an inventory of all non-electronic records created in 1962 regarding\n\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis,” an agency need not create an inventory if one did not already exist,\n\nthough the agency would need to release any such non-electronic records themselves if they were\n\nrequested and were not exempt from disclosure. Therefore, a FOIA request for a listing or index\n\nof a database’s contents that does not seek the contents of the database, but instead essentially\n\nseeks information about those contents, is a request that requires the creation of a new record,\n\ninsofar as the agency has not previously created and retained such a listing or index. 26 See\n\nPeople for the American Way, 451 F. Supp. 2d at 15 (producing a “list of records returned from\n\n[a database] search” is “something that FOIA does not mandate” because “the list was not\n\npreviously created or obtained by the agency” and “an order that defendant produce such a list\n\nwould be tantamount to requiring the defendant to create an agency record”).\n\n\n\n25\n  These were the sort of records sought by the plaintiff in its requests for “aggregate data.” See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex.\nA at 1 (seeking “a list, index, printout, or similar document”); id. Ex. B at 1, 4, 7, 10 (seeking “database listing[s]”);\nid. Ex. E at 53 (seeking “an index or comparable list”). The first two of these requests were incorporated by\nreference in the First Amended Complaint. See FAC ¶¶ 6, 42, NSC II.\n26\n   Similarly, requests for aggregate data, even if they seek data itself rather than a database listing or index, may\nnevertheless require an agency to perform research in response to a FOIA request—something courts have long held\nagencies are also not required to do. See, e.g., Hudgins, 620 F. Supp. at 21. Congress contemplated this possibility\nin the E-FOIA Amendments by stating that when an agency responds to a FOIA request, it “shall make reasonable\nefforts to search for the records in electronic form or format, except when such efforts would significantly interfere\nwith the operation of the agency’s automated information system.” Pub. L. No. 104-231, § 5, 110 Stat. at 3050.\nThus, if a FOIA request for “aggregate data” would require an unreasonably burdensome electronic search within\nthe confines of an agency’s automated information system, an agency need not conduct the search. See, e.g., Wolf v.\nCIA, 569 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2008) (agreeing that the CIA was not required to search its microfilm files\n“because such a search would be unduly burdensome and exceed the requirements of FOIA”).\n\n\n\n                                                           51\n\f        Even so, deciding whether or not the plaintiff has stated a claim for relief in its challenge\n\nto the CIA’s alleged Aggregate Data Policy (Count Two of No. 11-444) is an exceedingly close\n\ncall because the phrase used by the plaintiff in its First Amended Complaint—“aggregate\n\ndata”—is ambiguous. Whether or not the claim can survive depends upon whether, in light of\n\nthe specific examples of “aggregate data” requests provided by the plaintiff in its First Amended\n\nComplaint (i.e., Counts One and Eight), it would be reasonable to construe the plaintiff’s\n\nallegations to include requests for aggregate data itself, as opposed to including only requests for\n\n“database listings” or “printouts” of such listings. The plaintiff seems to contend that a request\n\nfor a “database listing” or “printout” of such a listing is a proper FOIA request on its face, see\n\nPl.’s 444 Opp’n at 20–21, which is incorrect, as the Court’s discussion above makes clear. One\n\nof the two specific FOIA requests that the plaintiff alleges as an example of an “aggregate data”\n\nrequest, however, sought, in the alternative, the underlying records themselves, see id. Ex. A at 2\n\n(seeking, in the alternative, “[a]ll FOIA request letters submitted to the CIA for each year”),\n\nwhich would not require the creation of a record. 27 Even so, this single request is insufficient to\n\nallege the existence of a policy or practice of the CIA refusing to produce the contents of an\n\nelectronic database because it could just as easily have been an isolated incident. See Iqbal, 556\n\nU.S. at 678 (complaint must plead facts that are more than “‘merely consistent with’ a\n\ndefendant’s liability”). Therefore, the plaintiff has failed to state claim for relief challenging the\n\nCIA’s alleged Aggregate Data Policy, and Count Two in No. 11-444 will be dismissed.\n\n        The Court pauses, however, to note the perverse practical consequences of the CIA’s\n\nchoice to refuse to provide database listings in response to FOIA requests. The FOIA requires\n\nagencies to disclose all non-exempt data points that it retains in electronic databases, see, e.g.,\n\n27\n The FOIA request that contains this alternative request is incorporated by reference in the First Amended\nComplaint. See FAC ¶ 42, NSC II.\n\n\n\n                                                        52\n\fLong, 450 F. Supp. 2d at 48, and thus although the CIA may not be required to produce an index\n\nor database listing in response to a FOIA request, it can be required to hand over the contents of\n\nentire databases of information to the extent those contents are not exempt from disclosure. 28\n\nAlthough producing the contents of a database would likely involve the same search burden upon\n\nan agency as producing a database listing, the production of a database listing would entail a\n\nsubstantially lighter production burden upon the agency. Despite the fact that the CIA can\n\ncontinue to escape the production of database listings under the FOIA if it wishes, the CIA may\n\nnevertheless find it more efficient to begin producing such database listings upon request\n\nbecause failing to do so may prompt requesters to seek the reams of data underlying such listings\n\ninstead. 29\n\n                 2.       Reasonably Describe Policy\n\n        The plaintiff challenges the CIA’s alleged Resonably Describe policy in Count Eleven of\n\nNo. 11-444, claiming that the CIA regularly refuses to process FOIA requests that the CIA\n\ndeems not to “reasonably describe” the records sought. See FAC ¶¶ 56–61, NSC II. The\n\nplaintiff claims that this behavior constitutes a policy or practice of applying a definition of the\n\nFOIA’s “reasonably describes” requirement that “is significantly and consistently broader than is\n\nallowed by FOIA.” FAC ¶ 58, NSC II. In the same vein, the plaintiff alleges that “[i]n a\n\nmajority of these cases, CIA has cited the configuration of its records systems as a disqualifying\n\nfactor.” Id. Ultimately, the plaintiff takes issue with two aspects of the CIA’s interpretation of\n\n\n\n28\n  In fact, the Executive Office for the U.S. Attorneys “regularly releases national caseload statistical data in\nresponse to monthly requests under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts.” The United States Attorneys\nOffice—FOIA/PA Reading Room, http://www.justice.gov/usao/reading_room/data/CaseStats.htm (last visited Oct.\n17, 2012). The CIA could potentially be subject to similar monthly reporting of its database of FOIA request\ninformation.\n29\n  It also may prompt Congress to supplement current annual FOIA reporting requirements to include aggregate\ndata, such as the total number of FOIA requesters organized by fee category or the ten most prolific FOIA requesters\nto an agency in a given fiscal year. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(e)(1).\n\n\n\n                                                        53\n\fthe FOIA’s “reasonably describes” requirement. First, the plaintiff claims that the CIA has\n\ninappropriately restricted the term “reasonably describe” by requiring requests to be couched “in\n\nterms of the request’s compatibility with existing indexing systems.” Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 23.\n\nSecond, the plaintiff claims that the defendant has adopted an overbroad interpretation of terms\n\nlike “relating to” and “pertaining to” in concluding that those terms render descriptions\n\nunreasonably vague. See Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s 444 Summ. J. Opp’n”) at\n\n19, NSC II, ECF No. 26. 30\n\n         Beginning with the first aspect, the CIA argues that the plaintiff’s challenge to the\n\nReasonably Describe Policy should be dismissed for failure to state a claim because determining\n\nwhether a request reasonably describes the records sought “depends both on the nature of the\n\nrequest and the type of records system an agency has.” Def.’s 444 Mem. at 16. In support of\n\nthis argument, the CIA cites its own FOIA regulation, which states:\n\n         A request need only reasonably describe the records of interest. This means that\n         documents must be described sufficiently to enable a professional employee\n         familiar with the subject to locate the documents with a reasonable effort.\n         Commonly this equates to a requirement that the documents must be locatable\n         through the indexing of our various systems.\n\n32 C.F.R. § 1900.12 (emphasis added). The CIA’s FOIA regulations also define reasonably\n\ndescribed records to mean “a description of a document (record) by unique identification number\n\nor descriptive terms which permit an Agency employee to locate documents with reasonable\n\neffort given existing indices and finding aids.” Id. § 1900.02(m) (emphasis added). In response,\n\nhowever, the plaintiff likewise cites these regulations, but it argues that their language\n\n“restricting th[e] definition [of ‘reasonably describes’] in terms of the request’s compatibility\n30\n  Indeed, the plaintiff goes so far as to argue in its opposition to the CIA’s motion for summary judgment in No. 11-\n444 that it “feels comfortable in saying” that the defendant’s overbroad interpretation of terms like “relating to” and\n“pertaining to” is “likely the worst component of the ‘overbroad application of “reasonably describe”’ pattern or\npractice it seeks to overturn in Count 11,” Pl.’s 444 Summ. J. Opp’n at 19, even though the plaintiff failed to\nreference this argument at all in its opposition to the CIA’s motion to dismiss. The Court will address this argument\nanyway, in the interest of providing a comprehensive analysis of the plaintiff’s challenge.\n\n\n\n                                                          54\n\fwith existing index systems is an impermissible interpretation of Congress’s intent and therefore\n\nmust be rejected.” Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 23.\n\n        Whether or not the CIA’s interpretation of the term “reasonably describes” in the FOIA is\n\ninconsistent with the FOIA is a purely legal question of statutory interpretation that the Court\n\nwill review de novo. See United States v. Cook, 594 F.3d 883, 886 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (holding that\n\n“the proper interpretation of a statute is a question of law”); Collins v. Nat’l Transp. Safety Bd.,\n\n351 F.3d 1246, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“For generic statutes like the APA, FOIA, and [Federal\n\nAdvisory Committee Act], the broadly sprawling applicability undermines any basis for\n\ndeference, and courts must therefore review interpretive questions de novo.”); Tax Analysts v.\n\nIRS, 117 F.3d 607, 613 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (“The meaning of FOIA should be the same no matter\n\nwhich agency is asked to produce its records.”) Therefore, “because a court can fully resolve\n\nany purely legal questions on a motion to dismiss, there is no inherent barrier to reaching the\n\nmerits at the 12(b)(6) stage.” Marshall Cnty. Health Care Auth. v. Shalala, 988 F.2d 1221, 1226\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1993).\n\n        Under the FOIA, agencies are required to make “promptly available” records that are\n\n“reasonably describe[d]” in a request that “is made in accordance with published rules stating the\n\ntime, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, and which are not exempt from\n\ndisclosure.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(3)(A), 552(b). 31 The phrase “requests for records which . . .\n\nreasonably describes such records” was added to the FOIA in 1974, and it replaced the phrase\n\n“request for identifiable records.” See Pub. L. No. 93-502, § 1(b)(1), 88 Stat. 1561, 1561 (1974).\n\n\n\n31\n  Thus, the question of whether or not a request “reasonably describes” the requested records is a threshold\nadministrative inquiry. An agency need not make records available to a requester unless and until a requester\n“reasonably describes such records.” Hence, there is a meaningful difference between a broadly sweeping yet\n“reasonably describe[d]” FOIA request, which might trigger the agency’s duties to communicate and cooperate with\nrequesters under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B)(ii), and a request that fails to meet the threshold of “reasonably\ndescrib[ing]” the records in the first place.\n\n\n\n                                                      55\n\fThe Senate Judiciary Committee Report accompanying this amendment stated that, “the\n\nidentification standard in the FOIA should not be used to obstruct public access to agency\n\nrecords” and the amendment “makes explicit the liberal standard for identification that Congress\n\nintended.” S. Rep. No. 93-854, at 10 (1974). The House Committee on Government Operations\n\nReport accompanying the amendment clarified that, “a ‘description’ of a requested document\n\nwould be sufficient if it enabled a professional employee of the agency who was familiar with\n\nthe subject area of the request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort.” H.R.\n\nRep. No. 93-876, at 5–6. The D.C. Circuit has held, in this regard, that “[t]he linchpin inquiry”\n\nin determining whether a request “reasonably describes” the records sought is “whether the\n\nagency is able to determine ‘precisely what records [are] being requested.’” Yeager, 678 F.2d at\n\n326 (alteration in original) (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-854, at 10).\n\n       The CIA argues that, “[b]ecause the way [its] records system is configured directly\n\naffects whether a CIA professional employee can locate requested documents with a reasonable\n\namount of effort, the configuration of its records system is a proper factor for [it] to consider in\n\ndetermining whether a FOIA communication adequately describes the requested records.”\n\nDef.’s 444 Mem. at 16–17. In support of this argument, the CIA cites two cases from this Court\n\nthat discussed an agency’s ability to consider the configuration of its own records system in\n\nresponding to FOIA requests. Id. at 16; see Assassination Archives & Research Ctr., Inc. v. CIA,\n\n720 F. Supp. 217, 219 (D.D.C. 1989) (“[A]gencies are not required to maintain their records or\n\nperform searches which are not compatible with their own document retrieval systems.”);\n\nBlakely v. Dep’t of Justice, 549 F. Supp. 362, 366–67 (D.D.C. 1982) (“The FOIA was not\n\nintended to compel agencies to become ad hoc investigators for requesters whose requests are\n\nnot compatible with their own information retrieval systems.”). In response, the plaintiff relies\n\n\n\n\n                                                 56\n\fheavily on the legislative history of the 1974 FOIA amendments, most of which is cited and\n\ndiscussed above. See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 23–24. As the defendant correctly points out, however,\n\nthe legislative history does not “directly mention whether an agency can consider the\n\nconfiguration of its records in determining whether a FOIA request reasonably describes the\n\nrecords sought.” Def.’s 444 Reply at 16.\n\n        Reading between the lines of the plaintiff’s brief, it appears that the plaintiff essentially\n\nconcedes that an agency is allowed to consider the configuration of its records systems in\n\nresponding to a FOIA request. In fact, the plaintiff’s brief cites no authority that would\n\ncontradict that principle. The plaintiff’s argument is focused more on the principle that an\n\nagency cannot disingenuously hide behind the configuration of its records systems in an attempt\n\nto thwart otherwise proper FOIA requests. See, e.g., Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 24 (arguing that the 1974\n\nFOIA amendment, adding the term “reasonably describes,” was “supposed to ‘directly aid\n\ncitizens in obtaining Government documents’”). Without addressing the merits of this latter\n\nprinciple, the Court simply notes that such a principle is irrelevant to deciding the first question\n\npresented by the plaintiff’s policy or practice claim, i.e., whether the FOIA permits agencies to\n\nconsider the configuration of their records systems in deciding whether a FOIA request\n\n“reasonably describes” the records sought.\n\n        On that question, the defendant clearly has the better of the argument. It has been the law\n\nin this Circuit for nearly 35 years that:\n\n        [A]n agency is not required to reorganize its files in response to a plaintiff’s\n        request in the form in which it was made, and that if an agency has not previously\n        segregated the requested class of records production may be required only where\n        the agency can identify that material with reasonable effort.\n\nGoland v. CIA, 607 F.2d 339, 353 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (alterations, footnotes, and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). This principle is perfectly consistent with the legislative history cited by the\n\n\n\n                                                  57\n\fplaintiff, which states that a request reasonably describes records sought when it would enable an\n\ninformed agency employee to locate the records “with a reasonable amount of effort.” H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 93-876, at 6. The legislative history did not sweep as broadly as the plaintiff suggests\n\nbecause the legislative history indicates that Congress was more narrowly concerned that\n\nagencies were requiring requesters to cite “a specific title or file number” in their requests, see id.\n\nat 5; see also 120 Cong. Rec. 6,809 (1974) (statement of Rep. Thorne), not that agencies were\n\ntaking the configuration of their records systems into account more generally. It would be\n\nunreasonable to require agencies to throw practical considerations to the wind in deciding\n\nwhether they can process FOIA requests because, although the FOIA regime undoubtedly seeks\n\nto “directly aid citizens in obtaining Government documents,” it also strives to achieve that goal\n\nwithout trampling on the agency’s prerogative to organize and manage its records in a reasonably\n\nefficient manner. In other words, an agency is presumably unable “to determine ‘precisely what\n\nrecords [are] being requested’” when it cannot perform a reasonable search for the requested\n\nrecords within the limitations of how its records systems are configured. See Yeager, 678 F.2d at\n\n326.\n\n       The search at issue in Goland is a useful example. In that case, the plaintiff sought\n\ndocuments related to the legislative history and passage of the National Security Act of 1974 and\n\nthe CIA Act of 1949, as well as two bills introduced into Congress in 1948 providing for the\n\nadministration of the CIA. Goland, 607 F.2d at 342–43. In particular, the plaintiff sought any\n\ndocuments produced from congressional reports or hearings related to these laws and also “any\n\nmaterials which may have been the basis for testimony at hearings or materials used by or\n\nsubmitted by the CIA or other Executive Branch sources which are included in unpublished\n\nreports on the cited bills.” Id. at 343 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). The CIA\n\n\n\n\n                                                  58\n\fconducted a search for such records, but it averred in affidavits that it had “no indices or\n\ncompendiums identifying records as ‘preparatory documents for congressional testimony,” and\n\nthus “any additional records of this description, if they exist, could be found only by ‘a page-by-\n\npage search’ through the ‘84,000 cubic feet of documents in the CIA Records Center.’” Id. at\n\n353 (alteration omitted). The D.C. Circuit upheld the adequacy of this search, holding that the\n\nCIA’s affidavits “plainly show[ed] that the effort required to locate the hypothesized ‘back-up’\n\ndocuments [prepared for use at these hearings] would be unreasonable here.” Id. at 353–54.\n\nThus, Goland recognized the fact that the “reasonable efforts” that an agency is required to put\n\nforth in locating requested documents is bounded, at least in part, by the configuration of an\n\nagency’s records systems. It stands to reason that this principle applies to all stages of the\n\nprocessing of a FOIA request, including the threshold decision of whether to process the request\n\nat all. 32\n\n             The plaintiff is still correct in asserting that an agency may not hide behind the\n\nlimitations of its own records systems in refusing to process FOIA requests, but this the plaintiff\n\nhas not alleged in its First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff’s policy-or-practice claim\n\nchallenging the alleged Reasonably Describe Policy (Count Eleven in No. 11-444) only alleges\n\n\n32\n  The Court recognizes the hydraulic effect that this logical extension of Goland and its progeny could potentially\nhave upon FOIA litigation: If agencies are permitted to cite the configuration of their records systems in refusing to\nprocess a request as not “reasonably described,” or as requiring an unduly burdensome search, requesters would be\npushed to seek judicial review of agencies’ FOIA responses at an earlier stage in the FOIA process. This is only\nproblematic to the extent that agencies choose to abuse this power by hiding behind the configuration of their\nrecords systems in refusing to process otherwise properly framed requests. Agencies that see this doctrinal\nextension as an invitation to artfully dodge FOIA requests they would rather not process would be short-sighted,\nhowever, since such a choice would entail perverse consequences. If an agency chooses to rely too heavily on the\n“reasonably describes” requirement to get rid of broad or pesky FOIA requests at their inception, rather than\nembracing the spirit of the agency’s obligations under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B) to “provide the person an opportunity\nto limit the scope of the request” or “an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for\nprocessing the request or a modified request,” that agency will subject its FOIA processing practices to judicial\nscrutiny and supervision at a much earlier point in time than would otherwise be necessary. The Court presumes\nthat agencies will generally choose the path outlined in § 552(a)(6)(B)—which is triggered with a proper request—\nand responsibly exercise their discretion in deciding when to refuse to process FOIA requests because of the\nconfiguration of their records systems.\n\n\n\n                                                         59\n\fthat the CIA’s citation to the configuration of its records system is, as a general matter, an\n\ninappropriate basis to conclude that a requester has failed to reasonably describe the records\n\nsought. See FAC ¶¶ 57–61, NSC II. That claim under Golan must be dismissed because its legal\n\npremise is incorrect as a matter of law.\n\n         The second aspect of the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Reasonably Describe\n\nPolicy is also unavailing, but for a different reason. The plaintiff argues that the CIA interprets\n\ntoo broadly terms like “relating to” and “pertaining to” in FOIA requests, and the CIA allegedly\n\nrelies on those overbroad interpretations to conclude that FOIA requests do not reasonably\n\ndescribe the records sought. See Pl.’s 444 Summ. J. Opp’n at 19 (arguing that the CIA has a\n\n“misguided rule that any request that contains the words ‘pertaining to,’ ‘related to,’ or ‘relating\n\nto’ is automatically overbroad whenever [the CIA] does not feel like processing it”). The\n\nproblem with this aspect of the plaintiff’s challenge is that, unlike the first aspect, it does not\n\nfocus on a formal interpretation of the “reasonably describes” requirement. Rather, the plaintiff\n\nis arguing that the CIA has implemented a loose practice of concluding that many, perhaps\n\nmost, 33 requests that use the phrases “relating to,” “pertaining to,” and the like do not reasonably\n\ndescribe the records sought. This fails to state claim in the abstract because, short of a\n\ncategorical refusal to process any requests that contain these phrases, an agency is permitted to\n\nassess the language of each FOIA request that it receives in order to determine whether it\n\n“reasonably describes” the records it seeks.\n\n\n\n\n33\n  Although the plaintiff intimates that the CIA categorically refuses to process FOIA requests that contain the\nphrases “relating to” or “pertaining to,” that insinuation is refuted by the plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, which\nincludes a claim that the CIA processed, but found no records responsive to, a FOIA request for “all records\npertaining to guidelines for attorneys in the Office of General Counsel (“OGC”) for the conduct of civil cases,\nespecially pertaining to interactions between OGC attorneys and Department of Justice (“DOJ”) attorneys.” FAC\n¶¶ 105, 107, NSC II.\n\n\n\n                                                          60\n\f         The Court nevertheless finds troubling the plaintiff’s claim that the CIA is systematically\n\nattempting to overuse the “reasonably describes” requirement because such an abuse of the\n\nFOIA’s statutory language would result in a large swath of FOIA requests never even getting\n\nprocessed, even though they should be. 34 This is particularly disturbing in light of Congress’s\n\nexplicit admonition that agencies are not to use the “reasonably describes” requirement “to\n\nobstruct public access to agency records.” S. Rep. No. 93-854, at 10. Federal courts’\n\njurisdiction under the FOIA is not limited to denials of requests that reasonably describe the\n\nrecords sought, and an agency is not the final arbiter of whether a FOIA request “reasonably\n\ndescribes” the records it seeks. Thus, a FOIA requester dissatisfied with an agency’s decision\n\nabout whether a request “reasonably describes” the records it seeks may seek judicial review of\n\nthat question. See discussion infra Part III.C.3.a. Indeed, the CIA implicitly concedes this\n\naspect of the Court’s jurisdiction because it has not moved to dismiss the two claims by the\n\nplaintiff that the CIA has improperly refused to process particular FOIA requests deemed not to\n\nreasonably describe the records sought. See FAC ¶¶ 46–55, NSC II. Even so, the question of\n\nwhether a particular FOIA request “reasonably describes” the records sought is a highly context-\n\nspecific inquiry, ill-suited to abstract analysis without a formal (or at least officially\n\nacknowledged) agency interpretation of the “reasonably describes” requirement. Lacking such\n\nan official agency interpretation with respect to the second aspect of its challenge to the CIA’s\n\nalleged Reasonably Describe Policy, the plaintiff and requesters like it are limited to challenging\n\nindividual refusals to process FOIA requests on the basis that the request does not reasonably\n\ndescribe the records sought.\n\n34\n  The plaintiff directs the Court to “nineteen of Defendant’s most egregiously questionable determinations that\nrequests allegedly failed to reasonably describe the records sought.” Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 26. Although the Court\ndoes not consider this evidence in ruling upon the CIA’s motion to dismiss, it is worth observing that some of these\nexamples include rather specific requests, such as a request for “a copy of all publications/reports made by the\n[Director of National Intelligence] Open Source Center for January of 2009.” See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex. E at 37.\n\n\n\n                                                         61\n\f               3.      Administrative Appeals Policy and Work With Policy\n\n       Under the FOIA, once an agency has received a request, it has twenty days within which\n\nto determine “whether to comply with such request,” and the agency must also “immediately\n\nnotify the person making such request of such determination” and “of the right of such person to\n\nappeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). The\n\nFOIA does not explicitly define the term “adverse determination.” Additionally, under the\n\nCIA’s FOIA regulations, any communications “which do not meet the[] requirements [of\n\nreasonably describing the records sought and not requiring an unreasonable search] will be\n\nconsidered an expression of interest and the Agency will work with, and offer suggestions to, the\n\npotential requester in order to define a request properly.” 32 C.F.R. § 1900.12(c).\n\n       The plaintiff challenges the CIA’s alleged Administrative Appeals Policy in Count Five\n\nof No. 11-444 by alleging that when the CIA refuses to process a request that it deems improper,\n\nthe CIA has a policy or practice of refusing the requester’s right to administratively appeal that\n\ndecision. FAC ¶¶ 28–29, NSC II. The plaintiff claims that “[a]n agency’s duty to adjudicate\n\nadministrative appeals of any negative determinations is a cornerstone of FOIA’s due process\n\nframework,” and therefore it avers that this alleged policy or practice violates the FOIA. Id.\n\n¶¶ 27, 29. The CIA argues that this claim should be dismissed because an agency’s\n\ndetermination that a FOIA request is improper or invalid does not qualify as an “adverse\n\ndetermination” that would trigger the right to administrative appeal under the statute, and\n\ntherefore its policy of refusing the right of administrative appeal when a request is deemed\n\nimproper or invalid is consistent with the FOIA. See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 14–15. Yet, the\n\nplaintiff responds that if the FOIA allows agencies to refuse the right to an administrative appeal,\n\n“the exhaustion doctrine is effectively turned on its head” leaving requesters “forced to speculate\n\nabout [the agency’s] reasons for its actions in a vacuum.” See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 22.\n\n\n                                                 62\n\f       To better understand the context of the plaintiff’s position, however, it is helpful also to\n\nconsider a related policy or practice alleged by the plaintiff. The plaintiff also challenges the\n\nCIA’s alleged Work With Policy in Count Fifteen of No. 11-444, claiming that when the CIA\n\ndeems a FOIA request improper or invalid, it habitually fails to contact the requester and “work\n\nwith, and offer suggestions to, the potential requester in order to define a request properly,” as\n\nrequired by the CIA’s own regulations. See FAC ¶ 74, NSC II. The CIA argues that this claim\n\nshould also be dismissed because the plaintiff has failed to “establish that the CIA has a policy or\n\npractice of not working with potential FOIA requesters,” citing two of the examples of improper\n\nrequests in the plaintiff’s Complaint, which include suggestions from the CIA about how to\n\nrefine the scope of the requests. See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 18–19.\n\n       Combining these two alleged policies or practices, the plaintiff is claiming that the CIA\n\nhas all but nullified agency consideration of requests that are deemed improper or invalid: The\n\nalleged Work With Policy prevents requesters from refining improper requests to make them\n\namenable to processing, and the alleged Administrative Appeals Policy leaves requesters with no\n\navenue for administrative review of whether the determination was appropriate. The question is\n\nwhether the FOIA and the APA permit this state of affairs. Though these two alleged policies\n\nare related, the legal analysis applied to these alleged policies will differ because the\n\nAdministrative Appeals Policy is an alleged violation of the FOIA itself, while the Work With\n\nPolicy is an alleged violation of the CIA’s regulation. Thus, the Administrative Appeals Policy\n\nwill be evaluated under the FOIA, while the Work With Policy will be evaluated under the APA.\n\n                       a)      The Alleged Administrative Appeals Policy Fails to State a Claim\n                               under the FOIA\n\n       As to the Administrative Appeals Policy, the plaintiff’s claim can only survive if the\n\nFOIA requires agencies to provide an administrative appeal from a determination that a request\n\n\n\n                                                  63\n\fis improper. In other words, it can survive only if a determination that a request is improper\n\nqualifies as an “adverse determination” under the FOIA. Once again, this raises a question of\n\nstatutory interpretation.\n\n       Many courts have recognized that an agency’s disclosure duties under the FOIA are not\n\ntriggered until a proper FOIA request is submitted. See, e.g., Truitt v. Dep’t of State, 897 F.2d\n\n540, 544 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (“To be sure, a request which fails to ‘reasonably describe[]’ the\n\ndocuments sought does not trigger a search for agency records.”); Davis v. FBI, 767 F. Supp. 2d\n\n201, 204 (D.D.C. 2011) (“An agency’s disclosure obligations under the FOIA are triggered by its\n\nreceipt of a request that ‘reasonably describes [the requested] records’ and ‘is made in\n\naccordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be\n\nfollowed.’”); Ramstack v. Dep’t of Army, 607 F. Supp. 2d 94, 102 (D.D.C. 2009) (“[O]nly a\n\nvalid FOIA request can trigger an agency’s FOIA obligations . . . .”). The D.C. Circuit also held,\n\nin a seminal FOIA case, that “[a] response [by an agency] is sufficient for purposes of requiring\n\nan administrative appeal if it includes: the agency’s determination of whether or not to comply\n\nwith the request; the reasons for its decision; and notice of the right of the requester to appeal to\n\nthe head of the agency if the initial agency decision is adverse.” Oglesby v. U.S. Dep’t of Army,\n\n920 F.2d 57, 65 (D.C. Cir. 1990).\n\n       This case presents the question of whether a particular agency response is a\n\n“determination” that would require the agency to provide for administrative exhaustion in the\n\nform of an administrative appeal. The cases in this Circuit, including Oglesby, however, have\n\nonly addressed the inverse question, i.e., whether an agency response was a “determination” that\n\nrequired the requester to exhaust its administrative remedies. Thus, the Circuit’s definition of a\n\nresponse that “is sufficient for purposes of requiring an administrative appeal,” articulated in\n\n\n\n\n                                                  64\n\fOglesby, sheds no light on the question presented in this case because it defines such a response,\n\nin part, by whether the agency has provided “notice of the right of the requester to appeal to the\n\nhead of the agency.” Id.; see also Hall & Assocs. v. EPA, 846 F. Supp. 2d 231, 240 (D.D.C.\n\n2012) (holding that agency response was not “adverse determination” where the agency response\n\ndid not notify the requester of its right to administrative appeal). For purposes of the question\n\npresented in the instant case (whether an agency must provide an administrative appeal), the\n\ndefinition of an adverse determination outlined in Oglesby (a determination that includes the\n\nright of administrative appeal) is merely circular. In other words, Oglesby and the instant case\n\nreside on opposite sides of the same coin—Oglesby deals with when a requester must pursue an\n\nadministrative appeal, and the instant case deals with when an agency must provide an\n\nadministrative appeal.\n\n        The language and structure of the FOIA nevertheless provide a reasonably clear answer\n\nto the question raised by the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s Administrative Appeals Policy.\n\nThe FOIA states that, “upon any [proper] request,” i.e., a request “made under paragraph (1), (2),\n\nor (3) of this subsection,” 35 the agency “shall . . . determine within 20 days . . . after the receipt\n\nof any such request whether to comply with such request.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A) (emphasis\n\nadded). This language makes clear that an agency has no duty to make any “determination” with\n\nregard to a FOIA request unless that request is proper. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the\n\nterm “adverse determination” in 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i) only contemplates agency decisions\n\nthat are in response to a proper FOIA request. In other words, the FOIA does not require\n\nagencies to provide administrative appeals on the issue of whether a request is proper in the first\n\n\n\n35\n   The relevant paragraph for FOIA requests is paragraph (3), which is the paragraph that requires requests to\n“reasonably describe[]” the records sought. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3). The instant cases do not implicate requests\nmade under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1) or § 552(a)(2).\n\n\n\n                                                        65\n\fplace. Therefore, the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Administrative Appeals Policy\n\n(Count Five in No. 11-444) will be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n\n       Again, however, this result may entail perverse consequences for the CIA. As discussed\n\nabove, the unavailability of an administrative appeal would not preclude a requester from\n\nseeking judicial review of an agency’s decision that a request is improper, and the CIA does not\n\ncontend otherwise. See discussion supra Part III.C.2. At the very least, such an agency decision\n\nwould be presumptively reviewable under the APA, if not the FOIA itself. See, e.g., Council for\n\nUrological Interests v. Sebelius, 668 F.3d 704, 708–09 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (recognizing the “strong\n\npresumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action’” (quoting Bowen v.\n\nMich. Acad. of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670 (1986))). In such a circumstance, a\n\nrequester’s failure to exhaust its administrative remedies does not bar judicial review because,\n\nwhen an agency makes a conscious choice not to provide a party with administrative process, the\n\nagency constructively waives the requirement of administrative exhaustion. See Cutler v. Hayes,\n\n818 F.2d 879, 891 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (holding that “the exhaustion requirement may be waived by\n\nthe agency, or disregarded by the court when application of the doctrine would be futile”);\n\naccord Harline v. DEA, 148 F.3d 1199, 1202 (10th Cir. 1998) (“Exhaustion is waivable by an\n\nagency, as when the agency itself acknowledges further administrative proceedings would not\n\nserve its purposes.” (citing Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 764–67 (1975) and Bowen v. City\n\nof New York, 476 U.S. 467, 484 (1986))). A party appearing before an administrative body\n\ncannot be punished for the agency’s choice to shoot itself in the foot by refusing to review its\n\nown decisions. In this way, the refusal of the CIA to provide administrative appeals in these\n\ncircumstances could be viewed as a boon to FOIA requesters because it expedites a requester’s\n\nability to seek judicial review of an agency’s decisions that a particular request does not\n\n\n\n\n                                                 66\n\freasonably describe records sought or otherwise fails to comply with the agency’s FOIA\n\nregulations.\n\n       To the extent the CIA’s failure to provide administrative appeals to requesters regarding\n\nwhether a request “reasonably describes” records is an attempt to divert FOIA cases from the\n\nagency’s docket to the dockets of the federal courts, however, the CIA may try the patience of\n\njudges called upon to adjudicate these claims because they consume scarce judicial resources on\n\nquestions that could easily, and perhaps more appropriately, be addressed at the administrative\n\nlevel. The Court also recognizes that the effect on the plaintiff and other FOIA requesters (not to\n\nmention taxpayers) from the agency’s diversion of these claims to the courts is an expensive one,\n\nforcing requesters and the government alike to expend time and money litigating these claims.\n\nIn sum, although the FOIA permits the CIA to continue this alleged policy, the CIA should\n\ncarefully consider the prudence of doing so.\n\n                       b)     The Alleged Work With Policy Fails to State a Claim Under the\n                              APA\n\n       The plaintiff’s related claim regarding the CIA’s alleged Work With Policy fails to state a\n\nclaim under the APA. The CIA does not contest that it has a clear duty to “work with, and offer\n\nsuggestions to” potential requesters who have submitted improper requests “in order to define a\n\nrequest properly.” See 32 C.F.R. § 1900.12(c). Thus, the CIA also does not appear to contest\n\nthat a policy, in the form of a “final agency action,” which refuses to “work with, and offer\n\nsuggestions to” potential requesters would violate its own regulation and could be set aside under\n\nthe APA as agency action that is “without observance of procedure required by law.” See 5\n\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(D). The CIA’s only argument in favor of dismissal is that the plaintiff “cannot\n\nestablish that the CIA has a policy or practice of not working with potential FOIA requesters,”\n\npointing to “examples of the CIA working with and offering suggestions to” the plaintiff, which\n\n\n\n                                                67\n\fare contained in the plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint. Def.’s 444 Mem. at 18–19; see also\n\nDef.’s 444 Reply at 17. As it relates to the APA claim challenging the CIA’s alleged Work With\n\nPolicy (Count Fifteen in No. 11-444), the Court construes the defendant’s argument to be that the\n\nplaintiff has failed to allege a “final agency action,” which is required to state a claim under the\n\nAPA. See 5 U.S.C. § 704; Holistic Candlers & Consumers Ass’n v. FDA, 664 F.3d 940, 946\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2012).\n\n       The D.C. Circuit has made clear that “an on-going program or policy is not, in itself, a\n\n‘final agency action’ under the APA,” and thus a court’s “jurisdiction does not extend to\n\nreviewing generalized complaints about agency behavior.” Cobell v. Kempthorne, 455 F.3d 301,\n\n307 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). A plaintiff “cannot seek wholesale\n\nimprovement” of the CIA’s patterns of behavior in responding to FOIA requests under the APA\n\n“rather than in the offices of the [agency] or the halls of Congress, where programmatic\n\nimprovements are normally made.” Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 891 (1990). In\n\nother words, the plaintiff complains of “the continuing (and thus constantly changing) operations\n\nof the [CIA] in reviewing [FOIA requests],” which is “no more an identifiable ‘agency action’—\n\nmuch less a ‘final agency action’—than a ‘weapons procurement program’ of the Department of\n\nDefense or a ‘drug interdiction program’ of the Drug Enforcement Administration.” Id. at 890.\n\n       The plaintiff does not claim that the alleged Work With Policy is pursuant to any\n\nofficially acknowledged agency rule or policy in place at the CIA. Nor does the plaintiff allege\n\nthat this “policy, practice, or standard operating procedure” of the CIA is mandatory upon\n\nagency officials. The plaintiff merely observes that the CIA has consistently refused to “work\n\nwith” FOIA requesters on a number of occasions. This sort of “generalized complaint[] about\n\nagency behavior,” however, is not a complaint about final agency action. See Cobell, 455 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                                 68\n\fat 307. As was the case with the plaintiff’s challenge to the alleged Reasonably Describe Policy,\n\nindividual refusals by the CIA to “work with” requesters may be subject to challenge within the\n\nframework of the APA, see, e.g., Butte Cnty. v. Hogen, 613 F.3d 190, 194 (D.C. Cir. 2010)\n\n(“[A]gency decisions in informal adjudication are subject to judicial review under § 706 of the\n\nAPA.”), but at a broader policy level, the plaintiff has failed to allege a “final agency action,”\n\nand thus the plaintiff’s APA challenge to the CIA’s alleged Work With Policy (Count Fifteen in\n\nNo. 11-444) will be dismissed for failure to state a claim. 36\n\n                  4.        Cut-Off Date Policy\n\n         The Court next addresses the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Cut-Off Date\n\nPolicy. The plaintiff claims that, pursuant to this alleged policy, the CIA “applies an arbitrary\n\n‘date of response’ cut-off date” on FOIA requests “regardless of the nature of the request or the\n\nanticipated length of the search.” FAC ¶ 113, NSC II. An agency rule establishing a temporal\n\nlimit to its search efforts under the FOIA “is only valid when the limitation is consistent with the\n\nagency’s duty to take reasonable steps to ferret out requested documents.” McGehee v. CIA, 697\n\nF.2d 1095, 1101 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The D.C. Circuit disfavors an agency’s “reflexive application\n\nof [a] cut-off policy to every request regardless of circumstances” and has “expressly rejected the\n\nproposition that under FOIA, the ‘use of a time-of-request cut-off date is always reasonable.’”\n\nPublic Citizen v. Dep’t of State, 276 F.3d 634, 643 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting McGehee, 697 F.2d\n\nat 1102). Nevertheless, “specific circumstances in some agencies may render an across-the-\n\n\n36\n  Although the plaintiff fails to state a claim for relief in this Court, the plaintiff’s complaint about the Work With\npolicy is best directed at Congress. The CIA’s duty to “work with” requesters, like an agency’s determination of\nwhether a request “reasonably describes” the records sought, occurs at the threshold of the FOIA request process.\nThe FOIA itself imposes a similar duty to “provide [a requester] an opportunity to limit the scope of [its] request . . .\nor an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified\nrequest.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). This latter duty, however, is not triggered if an agency has not yet received a\nrequest that “reasonably describes such records.” Hence, there is a statutory disconnect between § 552(a)(3) and\n§ 552(a)(6)(B), which leaves the plaintiff unable to challenge the CIA’s alleged policy or practice under either the\nFOIA or the APA.\n\n\n\n                                                           69\n\fboard rule reasonable,” and it is the agency’s burden to make a “showing that warrants such an\n\napproach.” See id.\n\n       In the instant actions, the CIA argues that its alleged Cut-Off Date Policy would be\n\nreasonable “because the CIA is a large agency that receives a substantial volume of FOIA\n\nrequests.” Def.’s 444 Reply at 18. This argument is unpersuasive for two reasons. First,\n\ndetermining the reasonableness of an agency’s categorical cut-off date for running FOIA\n\nsearches is particularly inappropriate at the motion to dismiss stage because the CIA has not yet\n\nsubmitted any affidavits or other proof that would support its argument that an across-the-board\n\ncut-off date is reasonable. See Public Citizen, 276 F.3d at 643–44 (to establish reasonableness of\n\nacross-the-board cut-off date, an agency must make a “showing that warrants such an approach”\n\nthat would “substantiate its claim”). Second, the agency’s reasoning has largely been rejected by\n\nthe D.C. Circuit in McGehee and Public Citizen. In fact, McGehee specifically addressed the\n\nCIA’s policy of imposing a categorical date-of-request (rather than date-of-response) cut-off\n\ndate. In that case, the CIA put forth a number of justifications similar to the one proffered in the\n\ninstant action, all of which the D.C. Circuit rejected as a basis for concluding that an across-the-\n\nboard policy was reasonable. Specifically, the CIA pointed to\n\n       the benefits of ‘precis[ion]’ (the value of having a single cut-off date that all\n       agency divisions know in advance), the ‘confusion’ that might be engendered by\n       different agency components using different cut-off dates (e.g., each division\n       using the date at which it commenced searching for its documents), the alleged\n       costs and inconvenience to the agency of conducting the successive, duplicative\n       searches that might be necessary if the date of a final response or the date of\n       litigation were employed as a cut-off date, and the disruption of the agency’s fee\n       schedules that would accompany the use of anything other than its present\n       procedure.\n\nMcGehee, 697 F.2d at 1103–04. The CIA similarly now claims that its policy is reasonable\n\nbecause, as “a large agency” that “processes a high volume of FOIA requests,” it requires the\n\n“consistency and uniformity” that result from a categorical cut-off date. Def.’s 444 Mem. at 20.\n\n\n                                                 70\n\fIt would be out of line with the precedents in this Circuit for the Court to conclude as a matter of\n\nlaw that the CIA’s policy is reasonable. See Public Citizen, 276 F.3d at 644 (“At the very least,\n\nwe think that with minimal administrative hassle, the [agency] could apply a date-of-search cut-\n\noff . . . .”). Thus, the CIA’s motion to dismiss will be denied with respect to the plaintiff’s\n\nchallenge to the CIA’s alleged Cut-Off Date Policy (Count Twenty-One of No. 11-444), and the\n\nCIA will have an opportunity to “adduce additional relevant testimony” that its policy is\n\nreasonable. See McGehee, 697 F.2d at 1104.\n\n               5.      Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy and Document-Level\n                       Exemption Policy\n\n       Next, the Court addresses the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Withheld\n\nDocument Non-Identification Policy and Document-Level Exemption Policy in Counts Eighteen\n\nand Twenty, respectively, of No. 11-445. These claims allege that, at the administrative level,\n\nthe CIA has a policy of never identifying documents withheld in their entirety and only\n\nspecifying exemptions at a document level, rather than specifying the exemption claimed for\n\neach particular redaction. See FAC ¶¶ 118–122, 128–133, NSC III.\n\n       In responding to a FOIA request, agencies are obligated to determine “whether to comply\n\nwith such request” and must notify the requester of, inter alia, the reason for the determination.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). If the agency decides to withhold any responsive records, it also\n\nmust “make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of any requested matter the provision of\n\nwhich is denied” and provide that estimate to the requester. Id. § 552(a)(6)(F). Finally, if an\n\nagency decides to release records with certain portions redacted, it must indicate on each\n\ndocument “[t]he amount of information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is\n\nmade,” and “[i]f technically feasible,” the agency must also indicate this information “at the\n\nplace in the record where such deletion is made.” Id. § 552(b). The FOIA excuses agencies\n\n\n\n                                                 71\n\ffrom having either to “estimate the volume of” withheld records or indicate “[t]he amount of\n\ninformation deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made,” when compliance\n\nwith those procedures “would harm an interest protected by the exemption” being claimed. Id.\n\n§§ 552(a)(6)(F), 552(b).\n\n       In support of its challenge to the CIA’s alleged Withheld Document Non-Identification\n\nPolicy and Document-Level Exemption Policy, the plaintiff cites a publicly available CIA\n\ntraining manual, which states, “‘at initial and at appeal stage, no listing of documents, or putting\n\nspecific exemptions next to redactions, is required.” Id. ¶ 119. The CIA believes the plaintiff’s\n\nchallenges to these two alleged policies should be dismissed because (1) at least one court has\n\nupheld the CIA’s use of “no number, no list” responses for withholding documents at the\n\nadministrative stage in certain circumstances, and (2) an agency is permitted by the FOIA to\n\n“refuse to specify the exemptions under which a deletion is made when appropriate,” i.e., “if\n\nincluding the indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption.” See Defs.’ 445\n\nMem. at 17–18.\n\n       The plaintiff, however, argues that agencies are required to identify documents that are\n\nwithheld at the administrative level, relying heavily on a nearly 35-year-old Texas district court\n\ncase called Shermco Industries, Inc. v. Secretary of U.S. Air Force, 452 F. Supp. 306 (N.D. Tex.\n\n1978), rev’d on other grounds, 613 F.2d 1314 (5th Cir. 1980). See Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 18–19.\n\nThe court in Shermco stated in dictum that:\n\n       It would be impossible for a requesting person to effectively appeal an agency\n       decision through the administrative process with any hope of changing the\n       agency’s mind if the person were denied access to adequate information about the\n       adverse decision. A person cannot effectively appeal a decision about the\n       releasability of documents or the charging of fees if he is not informed of at least\n       a list of the documents to which he was denied access, what fees he will be\n       charged for releasable documents, and why those decisions were made. Denial of\n       this information would in all likelihood be a violation of due process as well as\n\n\n\n                                                 72\n\f       effectively gutting the reasons for applying the exhaustion doctrine in FOIA\n       cases.\n\nShermco, 452 F. Supp. at 317 n.7 (citing U.S. CONST. amend. XIV). The plaintiff further argues\n\nthat, although agencies are not required to indicate exemptions if doing so would “harm an\n\ninterest protected by the exemption,” such actions “must be exercised on a case-by-case basis,\n\nand a blanket policy of refusing to do so presumes that all indications would harm protected\n\ninterests.” Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 19–20.\n\n       First, Count Eighteen in No. 11-445, challenging the alleged Withheld Document Non-\n\nIdentification Policy, fails to state a cognizable claim under the FOIA. Earlier this year, this\n\nCourt held that “[t]he plain text of the [FOIA] does not require agencies to provide a list of\n\nwithheld documents, but only to make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of the\n\ndocuments withheld.” Mobley v. Dep’t of Justice, 845 F. Supp. 2d 120, 124 (D.D.C. 2012).\n\nAlthough the plaintiff may be correct that the administrative process would be more meaningful\n\nif agencies were required to identify withheld documents at the administrative stage, those\n\narguments are better directed at the political branches. The Judiciary’s powers are limited to\n\nsaying what the law is, and it would be inappropriate for the Court to add a substantial\n\nprocedural requirement to the FOIA when there is no indication that Congress intended such a\n\nrequirement to exist. This result may or may not “rob the requester of his ability to intelligently\n\nappeal any decisions at the administrative level,” Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 19, but Congress elected not\n\nto grant requesters that ability. Instead, the FOIA provides requesters with the opportunity for de\n\nnovo judicial review of all withholding decisions—an ample and powerful procedural\n\nmechanism. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B); see also Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air\n\nForce, 402 F. Supp. 460, 463 (D.D.C. 1975) (“While the [agency’s] identification might have\n\nbeen more detailed at an earlier [administrative] stage, the foregoing descriptions [in agency\n\n\n\n                                                 73\n\faffidavits] are adequate for this de novo Court action.”). Therefore, the plaintiff’s challenge to\n\nthe alleged Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy (Count Eighteen in No. 11-445) will\n\nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n\n       Next, Count Twenty in No. 11-445, challenging the alleged Document-Level Exemption\n\nPolicy, succeeds in stating a claim for relief based on the CIA’s stated policy. The plaintiff\n\nconcedes that an agency need not indicate the exemptions under which it redacts information at\n\nall when “including the indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption.” Pl.’s 445\n\nOpp’n at 19. Rather, the plaintiff’s sole contention in its brief is that the CIA is invoking\n\nexemptions on a document level pursuant to a “blanket policy,” rather than doing so on a case-\n\nby-case basis. Id. at 19–20. Two factual allegations support this claim. First, the plaintiff claims\n\nthat “[i]n every case in which CIA has redacted information from records released in response to\n\nan NSC FOIA request . . . CIA has consistently invoked exemptions on a document-level without\n\nindicating which exemptions applied to which particular redactions.” FAC ¶ 129, NSC III.\n\nHabitually invoking exemptions for redactions on a document level, however, is not inconsistent\n\nwith doing so on a case-by-case basis. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (complaint must plead facts\n\nthat are more than “‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s liability”). Standing alone, these\n\ndecisions by the CIA—“consistent[]” as they may be—do not demonstrate a plausible claim\n\nregarding a “blanket” policy.\n\n       Second, however, the plaintiff alleges the existence of a publicly available CIA training\n\nmanual, which states that “at initial and at appeal stage,” FOIA officials at the CIA need not\n\n“put[] specific exemptions next to redactions.” FAC ¶ 119, NSC III. The CIA does not contest\n\nthat this training manual constitutes an official agency policy regarding the specification of\n\nexemptions in redacted documents, but rather it argues that “an agency may, consistent with the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 74\n\fFOIA, refuse to specify the exemptions under which a deletion is made when” including the\n\nindication “would harm an interest protected by the exemption.” Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 18. The\n\nonly statutory language cited and discussed by the defendant, however, fails to address the\n\nsubstance of the plaintiff’s allegation. The defendant cites a provision of the FOIA that requires\n\nagencies to indicate the exemption under which a deletion is made “on the released portion of the\n\nrecord.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). This provision, however, only governs an agency’s duty to indicate\n\nthe exemption for a given deletion at all, while the plaintiff more particularly challenges the\n\nCIA’s failure to specify exemptions at a redaction level, as opposed to a document level. That\n\nduty is covered by the very next sentence of the FOIA statute, which neither party has cited or\n\ndiscussed. That sentence provides: “If technically feasible, the amount of the information\n\ndeleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated at the place in\n\nthe record where such deletion is made.” Id. Presuming as true the plaintiff’s uncontested\n\nallegation that the CIA training manual represents an official CIA policy, that policy runs\n\nroughshod over this statutory language by applying a blanket presumption that exemptions need\n\nnot be specified “next to redactions.” See FAC ¶ 119, NSC III. Therefore, the plaintiff has stated\n\na claim for relief in its challenge to the CIA’s alleged Document-Level Exemption Policy (Count\n\nTwenty in No. 11-445) because a blanket policy of refusing to specify exemptions “next to\n\nredactions,” without considering the technical feasibility of doing so, would violate the CIA’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                75\n\fduties under the FOIA. 37 Thus, the defendant’s partial motion to dismiss in No. 11-445 will be\n\ndenied with respect to Count Twenty. 38\n\n                  6.       Blanket Processing Notes Exemption Policy and Blanket Reference\n                           Material Exemption Policy\n\n         The Court next considers the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Blanket\n\nProcessing Notes Exemption Policy and Blanket Reference Material Exemption Policy,\n\ncontained in Counts Four and Eleven of No. 11-445, respectively. In those claims, the plaintiff\n\nalleges that, in response to FOIA requests, the CIA improperly applies blanket exemptions to\n\n(1) “all information pertaining to [the CIA’s] processing of FOIA and Privacy Act requests” and\n\n(2) “all FOIA/[Privacy Act] reference materials.” FAC ¶¶ 35, 79, NSC III. By “blanket\n\nexemption,” the plaintiff appears to mean that, when the plaintiff requests processing notes or\n\nreference materials about particular FOIA or Privacy Act requests, the CIA “has withheld\n\neverything from the release except for correspondence with the requester.” Id. ¶ 33.\n\n         Construing the plaintiff’s allegations in the most favorable light, the plaintiff’s claim is\n\nthat this alleged policy or practice violates the FOIA because it is “blanket” in nature, i.e., that\n\nthe CIA is reflexively and categorically withholding all processing notes and reference materials\n\nwithout actually assessing the material on a record-by-record basis. See Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 14–\n\n15 (arguing that the CIA’s “blanket” policy and its “sweeping generalizations” in support of that\n\npolicy are “reminiscent of the days before Vaughn indices were required components of any\n\nFOIA litigation”). The plaintiff attempts to buttress this theory in its opposition brief by citing to\n37\n  To the extent that the plaintiff claims, however, that the CIA has failed to give case-by-case consideration to its\ndecision of whether to indicate exemptions at all in redacted documents, the plaintiff’s claim fails. The plaintiff has\nnot alleged any facts that would plausibly suggest that the CIA has a policy of refusing to indicate exemptions in\nredacted documents without case-by-case consideration of whether such indication “would harm an interest\nprotected by the exemption.”\n38\n  The plaintiff has failed to state a claim for relief in Count Twenty, however, insofar as it claims that, when the\n“CIA has withheld records in their entirety in response to an NSC FOIA request,” the CIA “has consistently invoked\nexemptions in the alternative.” FAC ¶ 128, NSC III. The FOIA does not prohibit an agency from invoking\nexemptions in the alternative when the agency withholds records from disclosure.\n\n\n\n                                                          76\n\fwhat the plaintiff claims is the “only CIA FOIA processing notes released to any requester,”\n\nwhich the plaintiff says demonstrates the “mundane” and non-exempt nature of these materials.\n\nSee id. at 15–16. The plaintiff’s claim, however, suffers from fatal defects in pleading and logic.\n\n        As discussed above in connection with County Twenty, the plaintiff’s allegations in\n\nCounts Four and Eleven fail to distinguish between consistent decisionmaking on the one hand\n\nand a lack of case-by-case consideration on the other. Although the plaintiff alleges in Count\n\nFour that, in response to twelve of thirteen FOIA requests for processing materials, the CIA\n\n“withheld everything from the release except for correspondence with the requester,” FAC ¶ 33,\n\nNSC III, the plaintiff offers no allegation to suggest that this was not the result of case-by-case\n\nconsideration. 39 Unlike in Count Twenty, the plaintiff offers no factual allegation that the CIA\n\nhas an actual policy of categorically exempting such records. The plaintiff’s logic is that,\n\nbecause the processing notes that were released are “mundane,” there must be other such\n\nreleasable material “in all the various FOIA requests for which notes have been processed for\n\nrelease.” Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 16. Yet, logic would seem to militate toward the opposite\n\nconclusion, i.e., that the “mundane” processing notes were the only such notes released precisely\n\nbecause they are the exception, rather than the rule and precisely because the CIA is considering\n\nthe release of processing notes on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, if the CIA had such a “blanket”\n\npolicy, logic would seem to suggest that these “mundane” processing notes would have been\n\nwithheld, rather than produced. Despite all of this, the plaintiff’s only explanation for why these\n\nprocessing notes were released is that they represent an “inexplicabl[e] deviat[ion] from [the\n\nCIA’s] pattern,” but such thinking begs the question. Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 15.\n\n\n39\n  The plaintiff also offers no factual allegations whatsoever to support its claim in Count Eleven. The plaintiff\nmerely offers the conclusory assertion that the CIA has made a “decision to apply a blanket exemption to all\nFOIA/[Privacy Act] reference materials,” which violates the FOIA. FAC ¶ 79, NSC III. This allegation is patently\ninsufficient to state a plausible claim for relief.\n\n\n\n                                                       77\n\f         Even setting aside the plaintiff’s apparent logical fallacies, however, the fact remains that\n\nthe plaintiff has failed to allege any facts that would plausibly suggest that the CIA has\n\ncategorically exempted FOIA processing notes or reference materials without case-by-case\n\nconsideration. 40 The plaintiff also has not alleged that the CIA failed to comply with the other\n\nrequired procedures of the FOIA in withholding these records, such as disclosing the estimated\n\nvolume of the records withheld and identifying which exemptions apply to the withheld\n\ndocuments. Absent allegations that would plausibly suggest an ongoing violation of the FOIA,\n\nthe plaintiff’s challenges to the Blanket Processing Notes Exemption Policy and Blanket\n\nReference Material Exemption Policy (Counts Four and Eleven in No. 11-445) will be dismissed\n\nfor failure to state a claim. 41\n\n                  7.       Glomar Response Policy\n\n         Finally, the Court will address the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Glomar\n\nResponse Policy. “‘[A]n agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records where to\n\nanswer the FOIA inquiry would cause harm cognizable under a FOIA exception.’” Moore v.\n\nCIA, 666 F.3d 1330, 1333 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Gardels v. CIA, 689 F.2d 1100, 1103 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1982)). These responses are known as Glomar responses. See Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d\n\n1009, 1011 (D.C. Cir. 1976). “If, however, the agency has officially acknowledged the existence\n\nof the record, the agency can no longer use a Glomar response and instead must either:\n\n(1) disclose the record to the requester or (2) establish that its contents are exempt from\n\ndisclosure and that such exemption has not been waived.” Moore, 666 F.3d at 1333 (citation\n\n40\n  Hence, the Court need not reach the question of whether FOIA processing or reference materials would actually\nenjoy categorical exemption.\n41\n   The Court need not reach the question of whether the plaintiff would succeed in stating a claim if it had alleged\nfacts to support the notion that the CIA was failing to give case-by-case consideration to its withholding decisions.\nIt is sufficient to hold that a plaintiff alleging a policy or practice of “blanket” or categorical decisionmaking by\nFOIA administrators must allege facts that plausibly suggest a widespread lack of individual consideration, as\nopposed to a pattern of consistently deciding cases in a particular way.\n\n\n\n                                                          78\n\fomitted) (citing Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378–80). “[I]n order to overcome an agency’s Glomar\n\nresponse based on an official acknowledgement, the requesting plaintiff must pinpoint an agency\n\nrecord that both matches the plaintiff’s request and has been publicly and officially\n\nacknowledged by the agency.” Id.\n\n        The plaintiff alleges that the CIA has a policy or practice of “authoriz[ing] a Glomar\n\nresponse to any requests for information pertaining to FOIA and [Mandatory Declassification\n\nReview] requests referred to [it].” FAC ¶ 96, NSC III. In particular, the plaintiff alleged two\n\nexamples of this policy where the CIA has issued a Glomar response to FOIA requests for\n\ndocuments pertaining to particular FOIA and Mandatory Declassification Review (“MDR”)\n\nrequests, 42 despite the prior disclosure of referral memoranda from the CIA and correspondence\n\nbetween the CIA and the plaintiff regarding these requests. The plaintiff alleges that the referral\n\nmemoranda were disclosed by the National Archives and Records Administration, and the\n\nplaintiff alleges that it is in possession of the correspondence because it was the party\n\ncorresponding with the CIA. FAC ¶ 95, NSC III.\n\n        The plaintiff’s allegations challenging the CIA’s Glomar Response Policy sweep very\n\nbroadly. See FAC ¶ 96, NSC III (alleging a policy “that authorizes a Glomar response to any\n\nrequest for information pertaining to FOIA and MDR requests referred to an agency”).\n\nConstruing the plaintiff’s claim most broadly, the plaintiff is complaining that, even when other\n\nfederal agencies acknowledge the existence of responsive CIA records by referring FOIA\n\nrequests to the CIA, the CIA has a policy of nevertheless issuing Glomar responses post-referral.\n\nIn other words, Agency A says that Agency B has records responsive to a FOIA request, but\n\nAgency B says it can neither confirm nor deny that it has any such records. If this is what the\n\n\n42\n  An MDR request is a request from a member of the public to have a document or documents declassified so that\nthey can be released to the public. See generally Exec. Order 13,526, 75 Fed. Reg. 707 (Dec. 29, 2009).\n\n\n\n                                                      79\n\fplaintiff claims, however, that claim fails as a matter of well-established FOIA law. The D.C.\n\nCircuit has consistently held that, for purposes of a Glomar response, it “do[es] not deem\n\n‘official’ a disclosure made by someone other than the agency from which the information is\n\nbeing sought.” Frugone v. CIA, 169 F.3d 772, 774 (D.C. Cir. 1999); see also Marino v. DEA,\n\n685 F.3d 1076, 1082 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (“[A]n agency does not waive its right to invoke an\n\notherwise valid FOIA exemption when ‘someone other than the agency from which the\n\ninformation is being sought’ discloses it.” (quoting Frugone, 169 F.3d at 774)); Moore, 666 F.3d\n\nat 1333 n.4 (“[T]o the extent [appellant] suggests that the release of the [record] by the FBI\n\nconstitutes an official acknowledgement by the CIA, his argument is foreclosed by our\n\nprecedent.” (citing Frugone, 169 F.3d at 774–75)).\n\n       The plaintiff’s claim could, however, also be construed more narrowly. Under a\n\nnarrower construction, which is supported by the context provided in the plaintiff’s briefing, the\n\nplaintiff claims that when certain records associated with a FOIA request are publicly released\n\n(e.g., referral memoranda or correspondence with the requester), the responding agency is then\n\nforeclosed from issuing a Glomar response as to other records associated with that same request\n\n(e.g., processing notes). Indeed, the plaintiff argues, with a hint of exasperation, that “[i]t is\n\nnonsensical to propose that CIA can write an official letter to a requester acknowledging a\n\nreferred request (or even releasing material), but that if the same requester files a FOIA request\n\nfor CIA’s processing notes regarding the very same referred request, he will be issued a Glomar\n\nresponse.” Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 18. Although the plaintiff may find it “nonsensical,” the D.C.\n\nCircuit has clearly held that courts must apply the “official acknowledgement” exception\n\n“strictly,” such that the “official acknowledgement” only extends to the specific records that are\n\nacknowledged by the agency. See Moore, 666 F.3d at 1333; Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378–79; see also\n\n\n\n\n                                                  80\n\fWilner v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, 592 F.3d 60, 70 (2d Cir. 2009) (agency is “precluded from making a\n\nGlomar response if the existence or nonexistence of the specific records sought by the FOIA\n\nrequest has been the subject of an official public acknowledgement” (emphasis added)). Indeed,\n\nthis Circuit requires that a plaintiff “pinpoint an agency record that both matches the plaintiff’s\n\nrequest and has been publicly and officially acknowledged by the agency.” Moore, 666 F.3d at\n\n1333 (emphasis added). Thus, even assuming arguendo that the disclosure of the CIA’s referral\n\nmemoranda and correspondence regarding certain referred requests would qualify as “official\n\nacknowledgements,” that still would not make it improper for the CIA to refuse to confirm or\n\ndeny the existence of processing notes from those very same requests because the processing\n\nnotes are separate documents from the referral memoranda and correspondence. The fact that\n\nthey are separate documents makes all the difference under Moore and Wolf.\n\n       The plaintiff does not claim that the CIA has issued Glomar responses with respect to\n\nparticular documents that have been officially acknowledged by the CIA. Rather, the plaintiff’s\n\ntheory appears to be that, once an agency acknowledges that a particular request was made, such\n\na statement waives the agency’s ability to issue a Glomar response with regard to any documents\n\nassociated with that request. As logical as this may seem to the plaintiff, it is simply not the law.\n\nSee Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (holding that the official acknowledgement doctrine imposes an\n\n“insistence on exactitude” under which “the specific information sought by the plaintiff must\n\nalready be in the public domain by official disclosure”); see also Students Against Genocide\n\n(SAGE) v. Dep’t of State, 50 F. Supp. 2d 20, 25 (D.D.C. 1999) (“[T]here is certainly no ‘cat out\n\nof the bag’ philosophy underlying FOIA so that any public discussion of protected information\n\ndissipates the protection which would otherwise shield the information sought.”). Therefore,\n\nbecause the conduct that the plaintiff alleges would not violate the FOIA, the plaintiff’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                 81\n\fchallenge to the CIA’s alleged Glomar Response Policy (Count Fourteen in No. 11-445) will be\n\ndismissed for failure to state a claim.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons discussed above, in summary, the Court rules on the CIA’s partial\n\nmotions to dismiss the plaintiff’s policy-or-practice claims as follows:\n\n           1. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Assignment of Rights Policy may\n              go forward because the plaintiff has standing to pursue it.\n\n           2. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Aggregate Data Policy under the\n              FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act are all dismissed.\n\n           3. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Administrative Appeals Policy\n              under the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act are all dismissed.\n\n           4. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Reasonably Describe Policy under\n              the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act are all dismissed.\n\n           5. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Work With Policy under the FOIA,\n              the APA, and the Mandamus Act are all dismissed.\n\n           6. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Cut-Off Date Policy under the\n              FOIA may go forward because it succeeds in stating a claim for relief.\n\n           7. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Blanket Processing Notes\n              Exemption Policy under the FOIA is dismissed.\n\n           8. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Blanket Reference Material\n              Exemption Policy under the FOIA is dismissed.\n\n           9. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Glomar Response Policy under the\n              FOIA is dismissed.\n\n           10. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Non-Provision of Completion Date\n               Policy under the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act are all dismissed.\n\n           11. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Withheld Document Non-\n               Identification Policy under the FOIA and the APA are both dismissed.\n\n           12. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Document-Level Exemption Policy\n               under the FOIA may go forward because it succeeds in stating claim, but the\n               identical challenge under the APA is dismissed.\n\n\n\n                                                82\n\f       With respect to the specific Counts in the three complaints, the CIA’s motion to dismiss\n\nCounts One and Two of No. 11-443—related to the CIA’s Assignment of Rights Policy—is\n\ndenied. Additionally, the CIA’s partial motion to dismiss in No. 11-444 is denied with respect to\n\nthe plaintiff’s FOIA challenge to the CIA’s alleged Cut-Off Date Policy (Count Twenty-One)\n\nand is granted with respect to all APA claims (Counts Three, Six, Twelve, and Fifteen), all\n\nMandamus Act Claims (Counts Four, Seven, Thirteen, and Sixteen), and all remaining\n\nchallenges to the Aggregate Data Policy (Count Two), Administrative Appeals Policy (Count\n\nFive), Reasonably Describe Policy (Count Eleven), and Work With Policy (Count Fourteen).\n\nFinally, the CIA’s partial motion to dismiss in No. 11-445 is denied with respect to the FOIA\n\nchallenge to the CIA’s alleged Document-Level Exemption Policy (Count Twenty) and is\n\ngranted with respect to all APA claims (Counts Sixteen, Nineteen, and Twenty-One), the\n\nMandamus Act Claim (Count Seventeen) and all remaining challenges to the Blanket Processing\n\nNotes Exemption Policy (Count Four), Blanket Reference Material Exemption Policy (Count\n\nEleven), Glomar Response Policy (Count Fourteen), Non-Provision of Completion Date Policy\n\n(Count Fifteen), and Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy (Count Eighteen).\n\n       An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n       Date: October 17, 2012\n\n                                                     /s/ Beryl A.

Howell\nal.,\n\n                          Defendants.\n\n                                       MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        The plaintiff, National Security Counselors (“NSC”), brings three related actions against\n\nsix federal intelligence and defense agencies, claiming numerous violations of the Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552, et seq., and the Administrative Procedure Act\n\n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701, et seq., and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the FOIA,\n\nthe APA, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1361, and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. The gravamen of the plaintiff’s claims is that\n\nthese intelligence and defense agencies—principally the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”)—\n\nhave improperly handled the plaintiff’s requests for a variety of information under the FOIA.\n\nAlthough this allegedly improper agency behavior relates to a number of specific FOIA requests\n\nmade to the defendants, it has manifested more broadly in a series of what the plaintiff alleges to\n\nbe policies, practices, or standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) of the CIA that constitute\n\nongoing violations of the FOIA or the APA. 1 In essence, the plaintiff alleges a series of policies\n\nor practices by the CIA that have endeavored systematically to extinguish FOIA requests at their\n\n\n1\n  Although the CIA has a number of co-defendants in No. 11-445, the motions being decided in this opinion only\nrelate to claims against the CIA.\n\n\n\n                                                        1\n\finception, before the agency’s duty to search or make withholding decisions are triggered and\n\nbefore the agency must provide administrative remedies. In their totality, the allegations in these\n\nrelated actions paint a picture of the CIA’s desire to minimize the substance of its internal,\n\nadministrative consideration of FOIA requests by crafting mechanisms that limit FOIA\n\nrequesters’ access to such consideration, which in turn has tested the mettle, commitment, and\n\nresources of requesters like the plaintiff. The primary question presented by the CIA’s motions\n\nto dismiss the policy-or-practice claims in all three actions is whether such mechanisms are\n\npermitted by the FOIA.\n\nI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         The plaintiff in these related actions is a not-for-profit organization located in Arlington,\n\nVirginia, which was chartered in July 2009 by an attorney named Kelly McClanahan. 2\n\nAccording to its website, NSC performs four primary functions: (1) “to lawfully acquire from\n\nthe government material related to national security matters and distribute it to the public”;\n\n(2) “to use this material in the creation of original publications discussing the respective\n\nsubjects”; (3) “to advocate for intelligent reform in the national security and information and\n\nprivacy arenas”; and (4) “to provide a low-cost alternative to certain deserving clients involved\n\nin security law or information and privacy law-related proceedings.” See NAT’L SEC.\n\nCOUNSELORS, http://nationalsecuritylaw.org/ (last visited Oct. 17, 2012). To achieve these\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Compl. ¶¶ 3, 11, Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA (“NSC I”), No. 11-443 (Feb. 28, 2011). Because this opinion\naddresses the claims in three separate actions brought by the same plaintiff, for purposes of organizational clarity\nonly, the Court will refer to each case in short form as follows: No. 11-443 will be referred to as “NSC I,” No. 11-\n444 as “NSC II,” and No. 11-445 as “NSC III.” Additionally, for the same reasons, the Court will refer to court\nfilings in each case with a numerical prefix that corresponds to each Civil Case Number. For example, the\nplaintiff’s memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s partial motion to dismiss in No. 11-444 will be referred to,\nfor citation purposes only, as “Pl.’s 444 Opp’n.”\n\n\n\n                                                         2\n\ffunctions, the plaintiff frequently requests information under the FOIA from government\n\nagencies in the defense and intelligence sectors. 3\n\n        The instant actions involve challenges to both specific denials of records as well as\n\noverarching policies and practices of the CIA that are alleged to violate the FOIA. The CIA’s\n\nmotions to dismiss currently pending before the Court, however, deal almost exclusively with the\n\noverarching policies and practices alleged by the plaintiff. At issue are twelve separate alleged\n\npolicies or practices of the CIA, which the plaintiff claims are contrary to the CIA’s duties under\n\nthe FOIA. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the CIA has policies or practices of:\n\n        1. Refusing to recognize assignments of rights in FOIA requests (“Assignment of Rights\n           Policy”).

Assignment of Rights Policy\n\n           The plaintiff complains that the CIA refuses to recognize the assignment of rights related\n\nto FOIA requests—an assignment necessitated in this particular case by Mr. McClanahan’s\n\nchange in employment. Prior to chartering NSC, Mr. McClanahan served as the Director of\n\nFOIA Operations at another not-for-profit organization called the James Madison Project\n\n(“JMP”). 4 According to the plaintiff, it shares with JMP “virtually all the same purposes and\n\ninterests,” except that NSC represents clients and JMP does not. See Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 25.\n\nIndeed, JMP’s stated mission is to “promote government accountability and the reduction of\n\nsecrecy, as well as to educate the public on issues relating to intelligence and national security\n\nthrough means of research, advocacy and the dissemination of information.” See JAMES\n4\n    Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. Dismiss (“Pl.’s 443 Opp’n”) at 2–3, NSC I, ECF No. 12.\n\n\n\n                                                          4\n\fMADISON PROJECT, http://www.jamesmadisonproject.org (last visited Oct. 17, 2012). On April\n\n10, 2008, JMP submitted a FOIA request to the CIA for eleven articles originally published in\n\nthe CIA in-house journal Studies in Intelligence. Compl. ¶ 6, NSC I. On May 14, 2008, the CIA\n\nacknowledged receipt of JMP’s request and notified JMP that no fees would be assessed for the\n\nrequest. Id. ¶ 7. On February 27, 2009, the CIA released ten of the articles requested by JMP.\n\nFour articles were released in full and six were released with redactions under FOIA Exemptions\n\n1, 2, and 3. On April 13, 2009, JMP administratively appealed the CIA’s invocation of these\n\nexemptions. Id. ¶¶ 8–9.\n\n       Several months after the administrative appeal of the withholding decisions was filed, on\n\nJuly 31, 2009, Mr. McClanahan left JMP to charter NSC and serve as its Executive Director. Id.\n\n¶ 11. Because the request for the Studies in Intelligence articles were a “pet project[]” of Mr.\n\nMcClanahan’s, see Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 25, on October 7, 2009, JMP notified the CIA that it was\n\nassigning all rights, benefits and interests in that request to NSC, including the right to “pursue\n\nany administrative or legal methods at [NSC’s] disposal” relative to this request and also\n\n“surrendering any claims it may have” with respect to this request. Id. Ex. Q at 1, ECF No. 12-\n\n18; Compl. ¶ 12, NSC I. While the administrative appeal of the exemptions claimed on the\n\nStudies in Intelligence articles was pending, the plaintiff sent a letter to the CIA on May 25,\n\n2010, requesting that the appeal be amended to include a challenge to a redaction in one of the\n\narticles since the agency had not claimed an exemption for this redaction, and the redaction had\n\nbeen omitted from the original appeal. Compl. ¶ 13, NSC I. Prior to sending this letter, the\n\nplaintiff had begun to suspect that the CIA was refusing to recognize JMP’s assignment of rights\n\n(the “Assignment”), and the plaintiff therefore requested assistance from the CIA’s Office of\n\nGovernment Information Services (“OGIS”) to clarify the CIA’s position on the Assignment. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f¶ 14. The OGIS responded to the plaintiff on June 8, 2010, after consulting with the CIA’s\n\nOffice of General Counsel (“OGC”), informing the plaintiff that it was the CIA’s policy not to\n\naccept assignments of rights with regard to FOIA requests and suggesting that the plaintiff would\n\nneed to file new FOIA requests for the same records in order to pursue them administratively.\n\nId. ¶ 15.\n\n        The plaintiff alleges in Count One of the Complaint in No. 11-443 that it has a legal right\n\nto the information in the Studies in Intelligence articles that it requested, by virtue of the\n\nAssignment, and it also challenges the CIA’s Assignment of Rights Policy in Count Two,\n\nalleging that the policy is in violation of the FOIA and the APA. Id. ¶¶ 17, 19, 22. As a result,\n\nthe plaintiff seeks a full disclosure of the Studies in Intelligence articles originally requested by\n\nJMP, 5 a declaration that the CIA’s policy of refusing to recognize assignments of rights violates\n\nthe FOIA and/or the APA, and an injunction compelling the CIA to accept assignments of rights.\n\nCompl. at 7, NSC I.\n\n        B.       Aggregate Data Policy\n\n        The plaintiff complains that the CIA denied five FOIA requests in 2010 for database\n\nrecords organized into specific categories as detailed in each request, and with respect to four of\n\nthese requests the plaintiff claims that the CIA denied any administrative appeal rights.\n\nSpecifically, on July 5, 2010, the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to the CIA seeking “a record\n\nthat would indicate the ten individuals responsible for the most FOIA requests submitted (each)\n\nin Fiscal Years 2008, 2009, and 2010.” FAC ¶ 42, NSC II; Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex. A at 1, ECF No.\n\n17-2. The CIA responded on July 22, 2010 that it was declining to process this request, stating:\n\n\n5\n The CIA accepted JMP’s appeal regarding the Studies in Intelligence articles on April 23, 2009, see Pl.’s 443\nOpp’n Ex. Q at 7, but the parties have provided no information about the status of that appeal or whether the\nadministrative remedies regarding that request have been exhausted. The CIA does not contest the issue of\nexhaustion, and thus the Court will assume that administrative remedies for that claim have been exhausted.\n\n\n\n                                                         6\n\f“We have completed a thorough review of your request and have determined that our record\n\nsystems are not configured in a way that would allow us to perform a search reasonably\n\ncalculated to lead to the responsive record without an unreasonable effort.” Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex.\n\nA at 4. The CIA’s response further stated: “The FOIA does not require federal agencies to\n\nperform research, create records or conduct unreasonable searches through a body of material to\n\nsee if any of it is related to a particular request.” Id. The plaintiff did not appeal this\n\ndetermination, and it alleges that if it had submitted an administrative appeal, the CIA would\n\nhave refused to accept it. FAC ¶ 44, NSC II. In Count Eight of the First Amended Complaint in\n\nNo. 11-444, the plaintiff maintains that it has a legal right to this requested record and seeks the\n\nrecord’s disclosure. Id. ¶ 45.\n\n        On August 8, 2010, the plaintiff submitted four FOIA requests to the CIA seeking\n\n“database listings of all FOIA requesters from Fiscal Years 2008–2010 according to the fee\n\ncategories to which CIA assigned them.” Id. ¶ 6. In particular, each of these requests sought “a\n\ndatabase listing of all the FOIA requesters from FY 2008–present that you have classified as”\n\neither “news media,” “educational or scientific,” “commercial,” or “all other.” See Pl.’s 444\n\nOpp’n Ex. B at 1, 4, 7, 10, ECF No. 17-3. On September 30, 2010, the CIA acknowledged\n\nreceipt of these requests and assigned them tracking numbers but informed the plaintiff that it\n\nwas declining to process the requests, stating that “[t]he FOIA does not require federal agencies\n\nto create a record, collect information, conduct research, or analyze data.” Id. at 14–17. The\n\nplaintiff attempted to administratively appeal these determinations, but the CIA responded on\n\nOctober 21, 2010 that “since we did not provide you with appeal rights, we cannot accept your\n\nappeal[s].” Id. at 18–21. In Count One of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fplaintiff maintains that it has a legal right to these requested records and seeks the records’\n\ndisclosure. See FAC ¶ 10, NSC II.\n\n        In addition to these five specific denials of FOIA requests, the plaintiff also alleges that\n\nthe “CIA’s refusal to process requests for aggregate data represents an ongoing policy, practice,\n\nor standard operating procedure (‘SOP’)” that violates the FOIA. Id. ¶¶ 12–13. The plaintiff\n\nseeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged Aggregate Data Policy in Counts Two,\n\nThree, and Four of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444 under the FOIA, the APA, and\n\nthe Mandamus Act, respectively. Id. ¶¶ 13, 16, 18–20, 22–25.\n\n        C.       Reasonably Describe Policy\n\n        Next, the plaintiff complains about two FOIA requests made in 2010 and 2011,\n\nrespectively, that the CIA declined to process for failure to “reasonably describe” the records\n\nsought—a decision by the CIA that the plaintiff claims would also result in a denial of\n\nadministrative appeal rights, although the plaintiff did not test that result by filing any\n\nadministrative appeals. Specifically, on May 13, 2010, the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to\n\nthe CIA seeking “a representative sample of [CIA] analytical reports and memoranda presenting\n\npsychological analyses or profiles of foreign government officials, terrorist leaders, international\n\ncriminals, business figures, and other intelligence targets prepared by the Medical and\n\nPsychological Analysis Center (‘MPAC’) or its predecessor Office of Leadership Analysis\n\n(‘OLA’).” 6 The request specified that a “representative sample” meant: (a) “[o]nly final official\n\nreports or memoranda,” (b) no more than twenty reports/memoranda from any given year,\n\n(c) “[f]our reports/memoranda for each year . . . for individuals in each category of intelligence\n\ntarget,” and (d) “[r]easonable variety in the intelligence targets wherever possible.” Lutz Decl.\n\n6\n Decl. of Martha Lutz, Information Review Officer, Director’s Area, Central Intelligence Agency (“Lutz Decl.”)\nEx.

The CIA responded to this request on June 23, 2010, stating that it could not\n\naccept the request in its current form because it had not “reasonably describe[d]” the records\n\nsought, citing the “breadth and lack of specificity” of the request and “the way in which [the\n\nCIA’s] records systems are configured.” Id. Ex. N at 1, ECF No. 20-3. The CIA’s response\n\nfurther encouraged the plaintiff “to refine the scope of your request (such as including a narrower\n\ntime frame for, and more specific descriptions of, the information you seek) to enable us to\n\nconduct a reasonable search for responsive information.” Id. Once again, the plaintiff did not\n\nappeal this determination, and it alleges that if it had submitted an administrative appeal, the CIA\n\nwould have refused to accept it. FAC ¶ 49, NSC II. In Count Nine of the First Amended\n\nComplaint in No. 11-444, the plaintiff maintains that it has a legal right to this requested record\n\nand seeks the record’s disclosure. Id. ¶ 50.\n\n       Relatedly, on February 16, 2011, the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to the CIA\n\nseeking “all [CIA] records pertaining to the IBM supercomputer named ‘Watson.’” Lutz Decl.\n\nEx. O at 1, ECF No. 20-3. The CIA’s response to this request on March 2, 2011 was\n\nsubstantially identical to its response to the plaintiff’s May 13, 2010 FOIA request, stating that it\n\ncould not accept the request in its current form because it had not “reasonably describe[d]” the\n\nrecords sought, citing the “breadth and lack of specificity” of the request and “the way in which\n\n[the CIA’s] records systems are configured.” Id. Ex. P at 1, ECF No. 20-3. The CIA’s response\n\nfurther encouraged the plaintiff “to refine the scope of your request (such as contracts, if they\n\nexist, which would explain records pertaining to ‘Watson’) to enable us to conduct a reasonable\n\nsearch for responsive information.” Id. Yet again, the plaintiff did not appeal this determination,\n\nand it alleges that if it had submitted an administrative appeal, the CIA would have refused to\n\naccept it. FAC ¶ 54, NSC II. In Count Ten of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fplaintiff maintains that it has a legal right to these requested records and seeks the records’\n\ndisclosure. Id. ¶ 55.\n\n       In addition to these two specific denials of FOIA requests, the plaintiff has submitted\n\nforty-four other denials by the CIA that rely on the requester’s failure to “reasonably describe”\n\nthe records sought as a basis for declining to process the requests. Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex. E at 1–\n\n45, 47–51, 53–55. The plaintiff alleges that these refusals to process requests that do not\n\n“reasonably describe” records sought is related to the fact that “[i]n a majority of these cases,\n\nCIA has cited the configuration of its records systems as a disqualifying factor.” FAC ¶ 58, NSC\n\nII. These forty-four other denials span nearly four years, from August 1, 2007 to June 27, 2011,\n\nand they are in reference to FOIA requests made by the plaintiff as well as a number of other,\n\nnon-party FOIA requesters, including JMP, MuckRock, Gawker Media, and the National\n\nSecurity Archive. Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex. E at 1–45, 47–51, 53–55. The plaintiff alleges that, by\n\nrelying upon “the configuration of its records systems” in concluding that FOIA requests fail to\n\n“reasonably describe” records sought, the CIA’s “application of FOIA’s ‘reasonably describe’\n\nrequirement is significantly and consistently broader than is allowed by FOIA,” which the\n\nplaintiff claims is a policy or practice of the CIA that violates the FOIA. FAC ¶¶ 58–59, NSC II.\n\nThe plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged Reasonably Describe\n\nPolicy in Counts Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444\n\nunder the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act, respectively. Id. ¶¶ 59, 61, 63–65, 67–70.\n\n       D.      Administrative Appeals Policy and Work With Policy\n\n       As discussed above, when the plaintiff attempted to administratively appeal the CIA’s\n\nrefusal to process the plaintiff’s August 8, 2010 FOIA requests seeking “database listings of all\n\nFOIA requesters from Fiscal Years 2008–2010 according to the fee categories to which CIA\n\nassigned them,” the CIA refused to accept the plaintiff’s administrative appeal. FAC ¶ 6, NSC\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fII; see also Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex. B at 18–21. According to the plaintiff, this was not an isolated\n\nincident. The plaintiff has also submitted examples of similar refusals to allow administrative\n\nappeals by the CIA in response to three other FOIA requests submitted by two non-party FOIA\n\nrequesters. See id. Ex C at 2; id. Ex. D. From these examples, the plaintiff alleges that,\n\nwhenever the CIA refuses to process a FOIA request that it deems “improper” (e.g., because it\n\ndoes not “reasonably describe” requested records or it seeks “aggregate data”), the CIA has a\n\npolicy or practice of refusing to accept administrative appeals from those decisions. See FAC\n\n¶¶ 28–29, NSC II. The plaintiff claims that this Administrative Appeals Policy violates the\n\nFOIA, and it seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from the alleged policy in Counts Five, Six,\n\nand Seven of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444 under the FOIA, the APA, and the\n\nMandamus Act, respectively. FAC ¶¶ 29, 31, 33–35, 37–40, NSC II.\n\n       Similarly, the plaintiff alleges that in the “numerous instances in which CIA has refused\n\nto process a FOIA request it deemed improper,” the CIA has endeavored to “‘work with, and\n\noffer suggestions to, the potential requester’” in “virtually none of those circumstances.” Id. ¶ 74\n\n(quoting 32 C.F.R. § 1900.12(c)). In support of this claim, the plaintiff cites a series of CIA\n\nresponses to “improper” FOIA requests that either “contained only six formulaic suggestions” or\n\n“did not contain any suggestions at all.” See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex. E at 1, 3–51, 53–55. The\n\nplaintiff claims that this behavior constitutes a policy or practice that violates the CIA’s own\n\nFOIA regulation, 32 C.F.R. § 1900.12(c), which states: “Communications which do not meet\n\nthe[] requirements [of reasonably describing the records sought and not requiring an\n\nunreasonable search] will be considered an expression of interest and the Agency will work with,\n\nand offer suggestions to, the potential requester in order to define a request properly.” See FAC\n\n¶¶ 73–75. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged Work With\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fPolicy in Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, and Sixteen of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444\n\nunder the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act, respectively. Id. ¶¶ 75, 77, 79–81, 83–86.\n\n          E.     Cut-Off Date Policy\n\n          The plaintiff alleges that “[i]n every response letter [it] has received from CIA, CIA has\n\nimposed an arbitrary cut-off date on the search of the date of the response letter, regardless of the\n\nnature of the request or how long the search is expected to take.” Id. ¶ 112. Although the\n\nplaintiff alleges that the CIA imposes this “arbitrary cut-off date” in response to every FOIA\n\nrequest it has ever made to the CIA, the plaintiff has also submitted ten examples of such\n\nresponses to serve as a “representative sample,” all of which were sent to the plaintiff after this\n\naction was commenced. Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 14–15; id. Ex. G. The plaintiff alleges that applying\n\nan “arbitrary ‘date of response’ cut-off date regardless of the nature of the request or the\n\nanticipated length of the search” is a policy or practice of the CIA that violates the FOIA, and the\n\nplaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged Cut-Off Date Policy in Count\n\nTwenty-One of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-444 under the FOIA. FAC ¶¶ 113, 115,\n\nNSC II.\n\n          F.     Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy and Document-Level\n                 Exemption Policy\n\n          Next, the plaintiff alleges two policies or practices of the CIA that relate to the CIA’s\n\nprocessing of FOIA requests at the administrative level. First, the plaintiff claims that “[i]n\n\nevery case in which CIA has withheld records in their entirety in response to [one of the\n\nplaintiff’s] FOIA request[s], . . . CIA has consistently refused to identify any of the records\n\nwithheld in their entirety.” FAC ¶ 118, NSC III. The plaintiff alleges that this persistent\n\n“refus[al] to identify withheld records in the administrative stage” is a policy or practice of the\n\nCIA, citing a publicly available CIA training outline created in 2001, which states, “at initial and\n\n\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fat appeal stage, no listing of documents . . . is required,” and the plaintiff claims that this\n\nWithheld Document Non-Identification Policy violates the FOIA. Id. ¶¶ 118–20. The plaintiff\n\ntherefore seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged policy in Counts Eighteen and\n\nNineteen, of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-445 under the FOIA and the APA,\n\nrespectively. See id. ¶¶ 120, 122, 124–26.\n\n        The plaintiff also alleges that, “[i]n the majority of cases in which CIA has withheld\n\nrecords in their entirety in response to [one of the plaintiff’s] FOIA request[s], . . . CIA has\n\nconsistently invoked exemptions in the alternative,” and that “[i]n every case in which CIA has\n\nredacted information from records released in response to [one of the plaintiff’s] FOIA\n\nrequest[s], . . . CIA has consistently invoked exemptions on a document-level without indicating\n\nwhich exemptions applied to which particular redactions.” Id. ¶¶ 128–29. The plaintiff further\n\nalleges that this activity represents an ongoing policy or practice of the CIA, citing the same\n\ntraining manual it cited in challenging the alleged Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy,\n\nwhich also states that “at the initial and at appeal stage, no . . . putting specific exemptions next\n\nto redactions, is required,” and the plaintiff claims that this alleged Document-Level Exemption\n\nPolicy violates the FOIA. Id. ¶¶ 119, 130–31. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief from this alleged policy in Counts Twenty and Twenty-One of the First Amended\n\nComplaint in No. 11-445 under the FOIA and the APA, respectively. Id. ¶¶ 133, 135–37.\n\n        G.      Blanket Processing Notes Exemption Policy and Blanket Reference Material\n                Exemption Policy\n\n        The plaintiff has, through numerous separate FOIA requests, sought two types of records\n\nintegral to the processing of FOIA requests: namely, notes prepared and reference materials\n\nused by personnel actually processing the requests, but the plaintiff claims that the CIA has\n\ncategorically declined to disclose either type of record. Specifically, on December 1, 2009, the\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fplaintiff submitted a FOIA request to the CIA seeking “copies of all CIA records ‘referencing\n\nFOIA and Privacy Act requests submitted by [ten listed parties] that contain remarks, comments,\n\nnotes, explanations, etc. made by CIA personnel or contractors about the processing of these\n\nrequests (and appeals, if appropriate), the invocation of exemptions, or related matters.’” FAC\n\n¶ 11, NSC III. This information was to include “analysts’ notes made during the processing of\n\nthe requests, any standard worksheets completed by the analysts, any justifications for exemption\n\ninvocations,” as well as “any correspondence referencing the requests.” Id. The plaintiff refers\n\nto this kind of request generally as a “Processing Notes request,” and the plaintiff alleges that it\n\nhas also submitted seventeen other Processing Notes requests to the CIA, and in thirteen of those\n\nrequests the CIA identified responsive records. Id. ¶¶ 11, 33. The plaintiff also claims that, in\n\nresponse to twelve of those thirteen FOIA requests involving responsive records, the CIA “has\n\nwithheld everything from . . . release except for correspondence with the requester.” Id. ¶ 33.\n\n       Relatedly, the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request on February 6, 2010 for “copies of ‘all\n\ncurrent training handbooks, manuals, guidelines, checklists, worksheets, and similar documents\n\nprovided to [CIA] FOIA and Privacy Act analysts.” Id. ¶ 56. The plaintiff refers to this kind of\n\nrequest generally as a “Reference Materials request,” and it claims that, in response to FOIA\n\nrequests seeking such reference materials, the CIA “appl[ies] a blanket exemption” to all such\n\nreference materials. Id. ¶ 79.\n\n       The plaintiff claims that these patterns of activity by the CIA with respect to FOIA\n\nprocessing notes and reference materials constitute two policies or practices that violate the\n\nFOIA by applying an improper blanket exemption to all such materials, thereby preventing their\n\ndisclosure. Id. ¶¶ 33, 35, 79. As a result, the plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief\n\nfrom the alleged Blanket Processing Notes Exemption Policy and Blanket Reference Material\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fExemption Policy in Counts Four and Eleven of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-445,\n\nrespectively, under the FOIA. Id. ¶ 37, 81.\n\n        H.       Glomar Response Policy\n\n        The plaintiff has submitted nine FOIA requests to the CIA, two of which are at issue in\n\nthis litigation, seeking records “pertaining to FOIA or Mandatory Declassification Review\n\n(‘MDR’) requests” that had been referred to the CIA by other government agencies. Id. ¶ 94.\n\nBased on the two examples of such requests provided by the plaintiff, these requests were similar\n\nto a Processing Notes request and sought the same types of information as such requests, except\n\nthat they sought processing notes from particular FOIA requests, rather than generally seeking all\n\nCIA processing notes related to particular requesters. See id. ¶¶ 83, 89. The plaintiff alleges\n\nthat, in response to these processing notes requests, the CIA “issued a Glomar response to all but\n\none of these requests,” and it further alleges that this activity by the CIA constitutes an agency\n\npolicy or practice. Id. ¶ 94.\n\n        A Glomar response is “an exception to the general rule that agencies must acknowledge\n\nthe existence of information responsive to a FOIA request and provide specific, non-conclusory\n\njustifications for withholding that information.” Roth v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219828\"><a href=\"/opinion/219828/roth-v-us-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1178 (D.C. Cir. 2011). 7 Thus, a Glomar response allows an agency to respond to a FOIA\n\nrequest by neither confirming nor denying the existence of any records responsive to the request,\n\non the grounds that “confirming or denying the existence of records would itself ‘cause harm\n\ncognizable under a[] FOIA exception.’” Id. (quoting Wolf v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186834\"><a href=\"/opinion/186834/wolf-paul-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007)). The plaintiff alleges that “[t]he fact that any given FOIA or MDR request is referred to\n\n\n7\n Glomar responses are “named for the Hughes Glomar Explorer, a ship used in a classified Central Intelligence\nAgency project ‘to raise a sunken Soviet submarine from the floor of the Pacific Ocean to recover the missiles,\ncodes, and communications equipment onboard for analysis by United States military and intelligence experts.’”\nRoth, 642 F.3d at 1171 (quoting Phillippi v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">655</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1981)).\n\n\n\n                                                        15\n\fCIA by another government agency is not classified,” and therefore the plaintiff claims that the\n\nCIA’s alleged policy or practice of “authoriz[ing] a Glomar response to any request for\n\ninformation pertaining to FOIA and MDR requests referred to an agency” is an ongoing violation\n\nof the FOIA. Id. ¶ 95–96. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this alleged\n\nGlomar Response Policy in Count Fourteen of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-445\n\nunder the FOIA. Id. ¶ 98.\n\n       I.      Non-Provision of Completion Date Policy\n\n       Finally, the plaintiff alleges that, in conjunction with pending FOIA requests with the\n\nCIA, the plaintiff “asked CIA numerous times in 2009–2010 for estimated dates of completion\n\nfor its pending FOIA requests” pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(7)(B). Id. ¶ 101. That portion of\n\nthe FOIA provides that “[e]ach agency shall . . . provide[] information about the status of a\n\nrequest to the person making the request,” including “an estimated date of on which the agency\n\nwill complete action on the request.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(7)(B). The plaintiff claims that until\n\nNovember 2010, the CIA “refused to provide [the plaintiff] with estimated dates of completion.”\n\nFAC ¶ 101, NSC III.\n\n       On November 17, 2010, however, the plaintiff alleges that a representative of the CIA\n\ninformed the plaintiff “that CIA’s new policy was to inform requesters that the estimated date of\n\ncompletion for any given request is two years from CIA’s date of receipt.” Id. That same day,\n\nthe plaintiff alleges, non-party JMP requested estimated dates of completion from the CIA for\n\nthree pending FOIA requests that were more than two years old, specifically invoking 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(7)(B). Id. ¶ 102. Even so, the plaintiff alleges that on November 24, 2010, the CIA\n\nresponded to JMP’s request but “refused to provide the requested estimated dates of\n\ncompletion.” Id. The plaintiff also alleges that the CIA similarly refused to provide estimated\n\ndates of completion for pending FOIA requests to a non-party named Michael Ravnitzky, who\n\n\n                                                16\n\frequested such dates on November 28, 2010. Id. ¶ 103. As a result of this pattern of behavior,\n\nthe plaintiff claims that the CIA’s refusal to provide estimated dates of completion, in\n\ncompliance with 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(7)(B), represents an ongoing policy or practice of the CIA\n\nthat violates the FOIA. Id. ¶¶ 104–05. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from\n\nthis alleged Non-Provision of Completion Date Policy in Counts Fifteen, Sixteen, and Seventeen\n\nof the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-445 under the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus\n\nAct, respectively. See id. ¶¶ 105, 107, 109–11, 113–16.\n\n                                                      ***\n\n         The plaintiff filed the Complaints in each of these three actions on February 28, 2011,\n\nand the plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint in Nos. 11-444 and 11-445 on March 21, 2011.\n\nPending before the Court are the CIA’s partial motions to dismiss in all three actions. The\n\nmotions have been brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to\n\nstate a claim as well as Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, the Court will deny the CIA’s Partial Motion to Dismiss in No. 11-443, the\n\nCourt will grant in part and deny in part the CIA’s Partial Motion to Dismiss in No. 11-444, and\n\nthe Court will grant in part and deny in part the defendants’ Partial Motion to Dismiss in No. 11-\n\n445. 8\n\n\n\n\n8\n As stated above, although the CIA has a number of co-defendants in No. 11-445, the motions being decided in this\nopinion only relate to claims against the CIA.\n\n\n\n                                                       17\n\fII.     STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n        A.       Motions to Dismiss\n\n        In its partial motions to dismiss, the CIA invokes the legal standards for dismissal under\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1). 9\n\n        When faced with a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Rule\n\n12(b)(1), a court has “an affirmative obligation to consider whether the constitutional and\n\nstatutory authority exist” for it to hear the case.

The first issue relates only to the claims brought in No. 11-443 regarding the Assignment of\n\nRights Policy. The CIA challenges the plaintiff’s standing to bring both the policy-or-practice\n\nclaim itself, as well as the plaintiff’s related claim in Count One of No. 11-443, in which it asks\n\nthe Court to order the CIA to process the FOIA request that was assigned to it by JMP. The CIA\n\nargues that “[b]ecause NSC does not have any enforceable rights or interests in the FOIA\n\nrequests it references in [its policy-or-practice claim], it cannot establish that the CIA’s alleged\n\npolicy has harmed or will harm ‘a legally protected, concrete and particularized interest.’”\n\nDef.’s 443 Mem. at 7 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561). The CIA frames this as a matter of\n\nArticle III standing, see id., but the premise of the CIA’s argument hinges entirely on the merits\n\nof the plaintiff’s claims that the Assignment is valid and enforceable and that, as a result, the\n\nplaintiff has a statutory right, i.e., a “legally protected and particularized” right, to the\n\ninformation sought in the assigned FOIA request. The plaintiff’s alleged lack of injury-in-fact\n\nstems directly and exclusively from the fact that its name did not appear on the assigned FOIA\n\nrequest when that request was filed, 10 and therefore the CIA’s argument presents a question of\n\nstatutory, rather than Article III, standing. This means that the Court may resolve both the merits\n\nand jurisdictional issues of this claim at the outset. See, e.g., Chalabi v.

Thus, although the D.C. Circuit clearly approved of the transferability of\n\ninterests in FOIA requests under certain limited circumstances in Sinito, the only case in this\n\nCircuit thus far to address whether FOIA requests may be assigned to a non-requesting party\n\nafter the request has been made, Feinman v. FBI, held that such assignments are not allowed.\n\nCloser examination of these two cases is warranted both to reconcile their holdings and to\n\nascertain guidance on the question before the Court.\n\n                       a)      Sinito and Feinman\n\n       The D.C. Circuit’s decision in Sinito established a limited right to transfer interests in\n\nFOIA requests. That case involved a FOIA request made by a prisoner, seeking information\n\nabout the criminal investigation that had resulted in his incarceration. See Sinito, 176 F.3d at\n\n513. The original requester had exhausted his administrative remedies and filed suit in federal\n\ncourt, but he died in prison before his protracted litigation had been resolved. Id. The late\n\nprisoner’s counsel moved to substitute the prisoner’s son as the plaintiff under Federal Rule of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fCivil Procedure 25, but the district court denied the motion. 11 Id. The D.C. Circuit reversed,\n\nholding that a FOIA action can survive a requester’s death so long as the party substituting for\n\nthe deceased requester “qualifies under Rule 25(a) as a legal representative eligible to continue\n\nthe action.” Id.\n\n         In so holding, the Circuit compared the structure and purpose of the FOIA with other\n\nclaims that survive death, such as claims under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure\n\nAct of 1959 (“LMRDA”), see Mallick v.

See Sinito, 176\n\nF.3d at 513–15. The Court also noted that the strong apparent identity of interests between the\n\nproposed substitute party and the original requestor was strong, id. at 515 (“[W]e are dealing\n\nhere not with a vast pool of potential FOIA applicants, any of whom might seek to take [the\n\noriginal requester’s] place in the litigation.”), and that the original requester had “invested time,\n\nand in all likelihood money, in the action,” and therefore he “ha[d] a stake in the legal action\n\nwhich transcend[ed] that of ‘any person’ who might seek the FOIA document,” id. Finally, the\n\nCourt notably drew a favorable comparison between FOIA actions and “action[s] sounding in\n\nproperty rights . . . seeking money rather than information,” in which “there would be little\n\ndoubt” that the action would pass to the claimant’s estate. Id. The Court concluded that, even\n\nthough a FOIA request seeks information rather than money, information “in many cases has\n\nequal value with money or tangible property, and there is no reason, absent statutory preclusion,\n\nwhy it should not similarly survive.” Id.\n\n         The limits of a FOIA request’s transferability was once again addressed in Feinman,\n\nwhich involved a FOIA claim brought by a journalist (Feinman) who claimed that she had been\n\n11\n  Rule 25(a) provides that, when a party to an action dies before a claim is extinguished, “the court may order\nsubstitution of the proper party.” FED R. CIV. P. 25(a). The Rule further provides that “[a] motion for substitution\nmay be made by any party or by the decedent’s successor or representative.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                         25\n\fassigned the rights to the request in question by the original requester (Beirne) who was a non-\n\nparty to the lawsuit. Feinman, 680 F. Supp. 2d at 170–71. The FBI had denied Beirne’s request\n\nwithout any right of appeal because the request sought information about a suspected terrorist,\n\nbut no proof of the suspected terrorist’s death or a signed privacy waiver had been submitted\n\nwith the request. Id. at 171. Several months later, Feinman notified the FBI that Beirne had\n\n“assigned her rights and interests in the FOIA request to Feinman.” Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Feinman then sued the FBI, claiming that she had a “legal right under FOIA ‘to obtain\n\nthe information she seeks.’” Id. The FBI moved to dismiss on standing grounds because\n\nFeinman’s “name ‘did not appear on the original request.” Id.\n\n       Although the FBI based its arguments for dismissal solely on Feinman’s lack of statutory\n\nstanding, the court held that “strong policy concerns counsel[ed] against permitting assignments”\n\nof FOIA requests. Id. at 175. In particular, the court identified two principal policy\n\nconsiderations that counseled against assignments. First, the court noted that the identity of a\n\nFOIA requester is highly relevant in determining whether the requester is required to pay fees,\n\nsee 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A), and whether an agency discloses certain privileged documents to\n\n“‘first-party’ requesters who are the very persons protected by the privilege.” Feinman, 680 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 175. Thus, the court reasoned, allowing assignment of FOIA requests would\n\npotentially allow assignees to “share” (i.e., free-ride upon) an original requester’s favorable fee\n\nstatus and would force FOIA administrators to “risk litigation if they subsequently determined\n\nthat privacy or similar exemptions should be invoked against the third-party assignee.” Id.\n\nSecond, the court stated that allowing assignments of FOIA requests would “multiply\n\nopportunities for mistake and mischief” because allowing assignments would potentially allow\n\nan individual to “thwart an adversary’s search for information by claiming falsely to have been\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fassigned a previous requester's FOIA rights,” and would concomitantly place an undue burden\n\non FOIA administrators to “verify the validity of an assignment by determining whether it\n\ncomplies with local law and reflects the original requester's actual intent.” Id. at 175–76.\n\n       The Feinman court also discussed the Sinito case at length, distinguishing it on two\n\ngrounds. The court first noted that, unlike the deceased original requester in Sinito, the original\n\nrequester in Feinman (Beirne) “did not invest any time, money, or other effort into pursuing this\n\nlitigation” and thus never acquired a stake in the litigation “that might counsel against letting her\n\ninvestment of litigation resources go to waste.” Id. at 174. The court also noted that, unlike\n\nSinito, “there is no allegation that [Beirne] was incapable of protecting her rights by suing on her\n\nown behalf, or that the relationship between Beirne and Feinman is such that Feinman would\n\nprotect Beirne’s interests if their interests diverge.” Id. at 175. Ultimately, the Feinman court\n\ndrew a distinction between a situation “where the plaintiff claims to act on behalf of the original\n\nrequester,” as was the case in Sinito, as opposed to “act[ing] in her own right.” Id.\n\n                       b)      The Applicability of Feinman\n\n       Despite the thoughtful consideration of this issue by the court in Feinman, neither the\n\npolicy considerations discussed in Feinman nor the grounds it cited for distinguishing the\n\nholding in Sinito are sufficient to deny the validity of the plaintiff’s assignment in this case.\n\nStarting with the Feinman court’s discussion of Sinito, there are a number of major differences\n\nbetween Feinman and the instant case that distinguish Feinman’s analysis of Sinito. First and\n\nforemost, this case involves an assignment between two non-profit organizations, rather than an\n\nassignment between individuals. Recognizing that human beings, rather than corporate entities,\n\nperform the actual work on FOIA requests, an organizational interest in a FOIA request may\n\noften be attached to the work of a single employee or small group of employees who, in turn,\n\nmay choose to perform their work for more than one organizational principal while a request is\n\n\n                                                  27\n\fpending. Thus, as the plaintiff points out, not honoring the assignability of FOIA requests\n\nbetween organizations, when the sole reason for the assignment is to keep a request with the\n\nperson or persons who have assumed stewardship of that request, could present a large swath of\n\nprofessional FOIA requesters with a Morton’s fork: either forfeit the freedom to transfer\n\norganizations or forfeit the right to pursue a pending request for information under the FOIA. 12\n\nThe former option would needlessly and severely restrict employees’ freedom to change\n\norganizations, while the latter option would undermine the essential purpose of the FOIA.\n\n         Relatedly, this case involves two organizations that employed the same individual (Mr.\n\nMcClanahan) who had primary responsibility for filing and administratively pursuing the request\n\nat issue. By virtue of the extensive time and effort Mr. McClanahan has already invested in this\n\nrequest, see Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 26, it is clear that the plaintiff, through the efforts of its agent, has\n\nacquired a stake in the litigation, unlike the plaintiff in Feinman. Finally, unlike the parties in\n\nFeinman who alleged no relationship to each other whatsoever, the common bonds connecting\n\nJMP and NSC—the two organizations share the same Deputy Executive Director (Bradley\n\nMoss), and the Executive Director of JMP (Mark Zaid) also serves on the plaintiff’s Board of\n\nAdvisors, see Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 24—establishes that their relationship “is such that [NSC]\n\nwould protect [JMP’s] interests if their interests diverge.” See Feinman, 680 F. Supp. 2d at 175.\n\n         More fundamentally, the Court believes that Feinman did not account fully for the D.C.\n\nCircuit’s acknowledgement in Sinito that a claim for information and a claim for money or\n\n12\n  See Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 25–26. The plaintiff offers the example of a journalist who files a FOIA request in her\nnewspaper’s name and then goes to work for a new newspaper. See id. This situation would apply equally to an\nacademic who works for multiple institutions of higher learning, a lawyer who works for more than one law firm, or\nany number of other situations that could arise in the context of FOIA litigation. Another scenario likely to arise in\nFOIA litigation would be that Corporation A requests information (e.g., relating to a government contract that the\ncorporation did not secure in a bidding process) and, after the request is filed, Corporation A merges with\nCorporation B, such that Corporation A ceases to exist. Under the rule articulated in Feinman, the successor\ncorporation (Corporation B) would have to start the process all over again, even if the request had been outstanding\nfor several months or years.\n\n\n\n                                                         28\n\ftangible property are substantially similar in many cases. See Sinito, 176 F.3d at 515. The\n\nlogical result of the Circuit’s reasoning in Sinito is that courts should treat FOIA claims like\n\nclaims to tangible property unless doing so would contravene public policy or undermine the\n\n“institutional interests” of the judiciary in regulating which parties have standing to sue. See\n\nid. 13 Hence, the Court now turns to the policy considerations raised in Feinman to determine\n\nwhether assignability of FOIA requests would be appropriate in this case.\n\n         The Court certainly agrees with Feinman that the identity of a FOIA requester is relevant\n\nto certain aspects of the processing of the request, such as the assessment of fees and the\n\napplication of exemptions for privilege or privacy concerns. Nevertheless, the Court does not\n\nagree that these concerns warrant a blanket prohibition against the assignment of FOIA requests.\n\nFederal agencies are more than capable of developing efficient procedures to ensure that\n\nassignees do not free-ride on an original requestor’s fee status or improperly seek private or\n\nprivileged information. For example, agencies could easily require assignees, as a matter of\n\nstandard procedure, to submit any information necessary for the agency to update the aspects of\n\nan assigned request that turn on a requester’s identity. If an agency were to determine from this\n\ninformation that an assignee was not entitled to a fee waiver that had applied to the original\n\nrequester or that an assignee did not enjoy “first party” access to the original requester’s private\n\nor privileged information, the agency could simply adjust its disposition of the request\n\naccordingly.\n\n13\n   Under general principles of assignment, the fact that Sinito held that FOIA requests survive death could be\nconsidered prima facie support for the proposition that such requests are assignable. This is because survivability of\na right typically indicates that the right is not “purely personal,” and thus generally assignable. See Barnes Coal\nCorp. v. Retail Coal Merchants Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1545296\"><a href=\"/opinion/1545296/barnes-coal-corp-v-retail-coal-merchants-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 649 (4th Cir. 1942) (holding that the “modern rule as to\nsurvivability” is that actions for “personal wrongs . . . die with the person,” whereas actions “affecting property\nright’s” survive); RTC Commercial Loan Trust 1995-NP1A v.

The\n\nFeinman court may have been correct in noting that, if FOIA administrators were to take an\n\nindividual’s claim to an assignment of rights “at face value,” any stranger could step in to\n\nexclude an original requester from the FOIA process against her will. See Feinman, 680 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 175–76. Even so, nothing would require an agency to take such claims “at face\n\nvalue.” On the contrary, FOIA administrators should require proper documentation of an\n\nassignment for it to be recognized—most likely a notarized statement from the original requester\n\nthat specifically identifies the assignee and the rights assigned. Cf. 31 U.S.C. § 3727(b) (laying\n\nout requirements for assignment of money claims against the United States government).\n\n       The Feinman court was nevertheless concerned that this validation process would\n\nconstitute an “unreasonable” burden on busy FOIA administrators and that such a burden would\n\nbe “greater than the minimal burden on any given assignee to make her own FOIA request.”\n\nFeinman, 680 F. Supp. 2d at 176. That balancing of the equities, however, does not fully\n\naccount for the realities of FOIA litigation and the central animating purposes of the FOIA. The\n\nburden imposed by requiring an assignee to file a new request and wait at the back of the FOIA\n\nline is not “minimal” in most cases. Although filing a new FOIA request may often involve a\n\nsmall amount of effort or resources, it exacts a temporal cost on FOIA requesters that should not\n\nbe discounted, considering that the FOIA was intended to promote not merely disclosure, but\n\ntimely disclosure. See H.R. Rep. No. 93-876, at 6 (1974) (“[I]nformation is often useful only if it\n\nis timely.”); Payne, 837 F.2d at 494 (“[S]tale information is of little value yet more costly than\n\nfresh information ought to be.”). To cite a relevant example, although the CIA takes an average\n\nof 143 days to respond to “complex” FOIA requests in which information is granted, it can\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fsometimes take the better part of a decade, 14 and in this particular case, over four and a half years\n\nhave passed since the date JMP filed the original FOIA request.\n\n        Additionally, the burden imposed on FOIA administrators from processing assigned\n\nrequests is unlikely to become “unreasonable,” and may in fact be more efficient than the\n\nalternative. See, e.g., Sinito, 176 F.3d at 517 (“[I]t would seem to us more expeditious from the\n\ngovernment’s point of view to allow the [FOIA] appeal to be pursued on the record already made\n\nthan to begin the process all over again with a new requestor.”). Agencies can and should shift\n\nthe vast majority of any burden to the assignees themselves, requiring them to submit whatever\n\ndocumentation the agency deems sufficient to validate an assignment, as discussed above.\n\nAdditionally, the plaintiff’s representations indicate that federal agencies are already recognizing\n\nFOIA assignments. In particular, the plaintiff documents how several agencies within the United\n\nStates intelligence and law enforcement communities, including the Department of Justice\n\n(“DOJ”), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence\n\nAgency (“NGA”) have formally recognized the assignment of FOIA requests without any indicia\n\nof “mistake and mischief” or undue burden. See Pl.’s 443 Opp’n at 14–19; id. Exs. A, B, I, K,\n\nM, N. Although the Court is mindful that the CIA may be able to demonstrate that recognizing\n\nassignments would categorically impose an undue burden on its FOIA administrators, that fact is\n\nnot apparent from the information available in the instant action. The Court holds that the\n\nplaintiff’s Assignment is valid and enforceable, and therefore the plaintiff has statutory standing\n\nto assert the claims alleged in No. 11-443. See Vt.

The CIA asserts that the plaintiff lacks standing to assert those\n\npolicy-or-practice claims because the plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged a future injury that\n\nwould confer standing to seek prospective declaratory and injunctive relief.

The closest the CIA\n\ncomes to contesting the plaintiff’s allegations of ongoing patterns or practices alleged in No. 11-\n\n444 is to argue that the plaintiff “cannot rely on speculation as to how the CIA will react to a\n\nfuture or hypothetical FOIA request.” Def.’s 444 Mem. at 10–11. Although nearly any\n\nallegation about future conduct involves some measure of conjecture in a literal sense, because\n\nno mere mortal has the ability to see into the future, the plaintiff is only required to put forth a\n\nplausible, “more than . . . nebulous” assertion of the existence of an ongoing pattern or practice\n\nto establish standing, and the plaintiff has done so here. In fact, the plaintiff details, in its\n\nopposition briefs, specific instances of conduct by the CIA that the plaintiff claims are\n\nmanifestations of the alleged policies and practices at issue, most of which are also alleged in the\n\nplaintiff’s Complaints. 16 This is more than sufficient to plead the existence of ongoing patterns\n\nor practices for the purpose of establishing standing. See Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals, 402\n\nF.3d at 1253 (court may consider “materials outside the pleadings” in deciding a motion to\n\ndismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction).\n\n\n\n\n15\n  The standard for pleading the existence of a pattern or practice for purposes of establishing standing to seek\nprospective relief is not necessarily identical to the standard for pleading a policy or practice to establish the right to\nPayne-style relief.\n16\n See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 10–15; Pl.’s Opp’n to Defs.’ Partial Mot.

It argues that, because the plaintiff has not alleged that it regularly\n\nsubmits or intends to submit requests that would implicate the alleged policies or practices, its\n\nclaimed future injury is insufficient. See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 9–12; Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 7. The\n\nCIA relies heavily on three FOIA cases from this Court to support its argument: Quick v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2004). None of these cases, however, aids the\n\nCIA’s standing argument.\n\n        First, with regard to all but one alleged policy or practice, the Quick case is immediately\n\ndistinguishable because, in that case, the record at the summary judgment stage was “clear” that,\n\n“even assuming that individuals other than [the plaintiff] may have been subject to the alleged\n\n‘pattern or practice,’” the plaintiff had not been subject to it. Quick, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 187.\n\nAlthough the policy alleged in Quick was that the agency “produc[ed] records only after a\n\nrequester takes the step of commencing a lawsuit,” the record had demonstrated that the agency\n\n“began processing [the plaintiff’s] request long before the commencement of the instant action\n\nand consistently and diligently worked towards completing that request in the absence of\n\nlitigation.” Id. Therefore, Quick’s citation to Lujan and its statement that the Supreme Court has\n\n“foreclosed” the possibility of standing when a plaintiff only offers a “passing allegation that he\n\n‘plans to file additional FOIA requests to the [agency] in the future,’” are dicta. This dicta is\n\nitself distinguishable in any event because, as discussed infra, the plaintiff has alleged the\n\nexistence of ongoing FOIA requests directed at the CIA. Thus, the Supreme Court’s admonition\n\n\n\n\n                                                  34\n\fin Lujan regarding “‘some day’ intentions” is inapplicable to the instant actions because the\n\nhypothetical “some day” has already arrived. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564.\n\n       Additionally, all three cases cited by the CIA are distinguishable because in all three\n\ncases the plaintiffs never alleged or demonstrated that they had any outstanding FOIA requests\n\n(other than the requests challenged in the litigation) that were likely to implicate the alleged\n\npolicies and lead to future injury.

See Pl.’s 444\n\n\n\n\n                                                  35\n\fOpp’n at 18; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 14. The plaintiff has also displayed a clear intent to continue\n\nfiling FOIA requests with the CIA, supported by its consistent habit of filing such requests both\n\nbefore and after the commencement of this litigation and its stated mission “to obtain records\n\nabout national security issues.” See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 18; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 14. Furthermore,\n\nthe Court finds that these ongoing actions and stated intentions to take future action are likely to\n\nimplicate the claimed policies and practices at issue because the pending and future requests\n\nappear to be of the same character as the specific requests that form the basis of the plaintiff’s\n\ncurrent claims. See, e.g., Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 18 (stating that the plaintiff has submitted at least\n\none other request for “aggregate data”); id. at 19 (stating that the plaintiff has submitted two\n\nrequests that were determined to “not reasonably describe the records sought”). Therefore, with\n\nthe exception of one policy or practice claim discussed below, the Court concludes that these\n\nactions and stated intentions are sufficiently concrete for the Court to conclude that the plaintiff\n\nhas alleged a real and immediate threat of future injury resulting from the alleged policies and\n\npractices of the CIA. Although it is true, as the CIA points out, that “‘[t]he existence of federal\n\njurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed,’” Lujan,\n\n504 U.S. at 569 n.4 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112278\"><a href=\"/opinion/112278/newman-green-inc-v-alfonzo-larrain/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 830 (1989)), when a plaintiff alleges a future injury, common sense dictates that a\n\ncourt can and should consider the activities of the plaintiff during and after the time that the\n\ncomplaint is filed in order to assess the likelihood of such a future injury.\n\n       The one exception to this holding is the alleged Non-Provision of Completion Date\n\nPolicy. With respect to that alleged policy, the plaintiff claims that the CIA has a policy or\n\npractice of refusing to provide estimated dates of completion for pending FOIA requests. See\n\nFAC ¶¶ 99–116, NSC III. In particular, the plaintiff claims that the CIA consistently refused to\n\n\n\n\n                                                  36\n\fsupply the plaintiff with estimate dates of completion for its pending FOIA requests “[u]ntil\n\nNovember 2010,” and that although the CIA instituted a policy in November 2010 to “inform\n\nrequesters that the estimated date of completion for any given request is two years from CIA’s\n\ndate of receipt,” the CIA has continued to refuse requesters’ demands for estimated dates of\n\ncompletion. Id. ¶¶ 101–104. The problem, however, is that the plaintiff’s factual allegations, in\n\nsupport of the claim that the CIA continues to refuse to provide estimated dates of completion\n\nsince the promulgation of its November 2010 informal guidance, relate solely to FOIA requests\n\nfiled by other parties. The plaintiff cites requests filed by non-parties JMP and Michael\n\nRadvintzky, as well as those non-parties’ post-November 2010 requests for estimated dates of\n\ncompletion, to support its claim that the CIA continues to refuse to provide estimated dates of\n\ncompletion. Yet, these allegations fail to allege a cognizable injury against the plaintiff because\n\n“even assuming that individuals other than [the plaintiff] may have been subject to the alleged\n\n‘pattern or practice,’” the plaintiff has not alleged that it has been subject to the post-November\n\n2010 policy that it seeks to challenge. See Quick, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 187. Without an allegation\n\nthat the plaintiff itself has been subject to the CIA’s post-November 2010 Non-Provision of\n\nCompletion Date Policy, the plaintiff has no standing to bring its claim challenging that policy.\n\nTherefore, the causes of action related to the Non-Provision of Completion Date Policy (Counts\n\nFifteen, Sixteen, and Seventeen of the First Amended Complaint in No. 11-445) will be\n\ndismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n       B.      Mandamus and Administrative Procedure Act Claims\n\n       Having addressed all of the CIA’s standing arguments, the Court will now address the\n\nCIA’s arguments for dismissing all of the remaining policy-or-practice claims summarized above\n\nunder Rules 12(b)(1) and/or 12(b)(6).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 37\n\f        As discussed above, the plaintiff has elected to seek relief from a number of the alleged\n\npolicies or practices of the CIA under a variety of legal theories. In addition to the Assignment\n\nof Rights Policy and Non-Provision of Completion Date Policy addressed and resolved above,\n\nthe plaintiff claims ten separate policies or practices that it says violate the FOIA. The plaintiff\n\nseeks relief from each of these alleged policies or practices under the FOIA itself, but it also\n\nseeks relief from four of the policies or practices under the Mandamus Act, 17 and it seeks relief\n\nfrom seven of the policies or practices under the APA. 18 The plaintiff concedes that, because\n\nthese claims are duplicative of one another, to the extent it is granted relief at all, such relief will\n\nbe pursuant to only one of these statutes. See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 7; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 7. The\n\nCourt will first address the viability of the plaintiff’s APA claims and then will discuss the\n\nviability of the plaintiff’s Mandamus Act claims.\n\n                 1.       Administrative Procedure Act Claims\n\n        The CIA moves to dismiss the plaintiff’s seven remaining APA claims on the basis that\n\nthe Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over those claims. These are the APA claims related\n\nto: the Aggregate Data Policy (Count Three of No. 11-444), the Administrative Appeals Policy\n\n(Count Six of No. 11-444), the Reasonably Describe Policy (Count Twelve of No. 11-444), the\n\nWork With Policy (Count Fifteen of No. 11-444), the Withheld Document Non-Identification\n\nPolicy (Count Nineteen of No. 11-445), the Document-Level Exemption Policy (Count Twenty-\n\nOne of No. 11-445), and the APA component of the challenge to the Glomar Response Policy\n\n\n\n\n17\n The four policies or practices challenged under the Mandamus Act are: the Aggregate Data Policy, the\nAdministrative Appeals Policy, the Reasonably Describe Policy, and the Work With Policy.\n18\n   The seven policies or practices challenged under the APA include the same four policies or practices challenged\nunder the Mandamus Act, as well as: the Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy, the Document-Level\nExemption Policy, and the APA component of the “FOIA/APA” challenge to the Glomar Response Policy.\n\n\n\n                                                        38\n\f(Count Fourteen of No. 11-445). 19 The CIA argues that the APA’s waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity does not apply to the plaintiff’s APA causes of action because the availability of a\n\nremedy for the plaintiff’s policy-or-practice claims under the FOIA and Payne means that the\n\nplaintiff’s corresponding APA claims are not claims “for which there is no other adequate\n\nremedy.” See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 3–4 (citing 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704); Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 3–4\n\n(same). According to the CIA, because “[a]ll . . . of [the plaintiff’s] APA claims, and the APA\n\ncomponent of its ‘FOIA/APA’ claim, are based on alleged violations of the FOIA and seek relief\n\navailable under the FOIA,” the APA claims should be dismissed. Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 4. The\n\nplaintiff responds that the CIA’s “statement that the mere fact that an APA claim ‘is premised on\n\na violation of FOIA’ is automatically fatal to that claim is fundamentally incorrect” because\n\n“FOIA does not provide an alternative remedy in all cases.” Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 6; Pl.’s 445\n\nOpp’n at 6. The plaintiff thus argues that if the Court were to “find that the alleged pattern or\n\npractice does not fit squarely within the four corners of FOIA’s remedies,” that would “remove it\n\nfrom Payne-style declaratory relief,” and therefore no other adequate remedy would be available.\n\nPl.’s 444 Opp’n at 7; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 7.\n\n        The CIA is correct that, where a plaintiff claims that an agency has wrongfully withheld\n\nagency records in connection with discrete FOIA requests, an APA claim seeking compelled\n\ndisclosure of the withheld records is precluded. See, e.g., Kenney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 603 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 184, 190 (D.D.C 2009). This is because the FOIA grants federal courts jurisdiction to\n\n“enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency\n\nrecords improperly withheld from the complainant.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). The D.C. Circuit\n\nin Payne, however, held that “[t]he FOIA imposes no limits on courts’ equitable powers in\n\n19\n  Count Fourteen of No. 11-445, challenging the CIA’s alleged Glomar Response Policy is captioned as a\n“FOIA/APA” cause of action, so the Court will only address the APA element of that hybrid claim in this section of\nthe opinion. See FAC at 14, NSC III.\n\n\n\n                                                       39\n\fenforcing its terms,” and where an agency’s actions in response to a FOIA request “violate the\n\nintent and purpose of the FOIA . . . the courts have a duty to prevent these abuses.” Payne, 837\n\nF.2d at 494; see also Wash. Research Project, Inc. v. Dep’t of Health, Educ. & Welfare, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"322197\"><a href=\"/opinion/322197/washington-research-project-inc-v-department-of-health-education-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252 (D.C.

Therefore, although the\n\nlanguage of the FOIA could be read strictly to limit the equitable powers of federal courts to\n\nenjoining the agency from withholding records and ordering production of improperly withheld\n\nrecords, the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court have interpreted those equitable powers more\n\nbroadly. See Renegotiation Bd. v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108960\"><a href=\"/opinion/108960/renegotiation-bd-v-bannercraft-clothing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19–20 (1974) (holding\n\nthat “[t]he broad language of the FOIA,” among other factors, demonstrate that “there is little to\n\nsuggest, despite the Act’s primary purpose, that Congress sought to limit the inherent powers of\n\nan equity court”).\n\n       The scope of the equitable powers available under the FOIA is nevertheless still unclear\n\nbecause the D.C. Circuit has yet to specify the breadth of Payne-style relief. The only concrete\n\nguidance has been from Payne itself, which stated that FOIA policy-or-practice claims extend to\n\nany “failure to abide by the terms of the FOIA.” Payne, 837 F.2d at 491. This Court has\n\npreviously held that “where a plaintiff challenges an alleged pattern and practice of violating\n\nprocedural requirements of FOIA in connection with the processing of the plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequests[,] the Court has the power under FOIA and Payne to provide the requested declaratory\n\nand injunctive remedies.” Muttitt v.

Supp. 2d at 229. Indeed, this Court\n\nstated in Muttitt that, even though a policy or practice “would not necessarily result directly in\n\n[the] withholding [of agency records],” it nevertheless falls within the Court’s broad equitable\n\npowers under the FOIA. Id. at 228–29 & n.4.\n\n       This conclusion is supported by the fact that it is well settled that courts have certain\n\nequitable powers under the FOIA that extend beyond the literal bounds of 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(B). Most notably, courts clearly have the power to order an agency to re-run a\n\nsearch for records where that search was not “reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant\n\ndocuments.’” See Morley v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187057\"><a href=\"/opinion/187057/morley-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1114 (D.C.

Similarly, remedying procedural violations of the FOIA may not necessarily\n\nlead to the production of withheld responsive records, yet it is concomitantly reasonable to\n\ninterpret the jurisdictional grant in 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) to include the power to enjoin\n\nprocedural violations of the FOIA when they are connected to specific requests for records.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\f        As in Muttitt, for each of the remaining policy-or-practice claims in the instant cases the\n\nplaintiff alleges that the CIA has applied the policy or practice to one or more specific FOIA\n\nrequests made by the plaintiff. Hence, all of the alleged policies or practices challenged in the\n\ninstant actions are “in connection with the processing of the plaintiff’s FOIA requests.” 20\n\nMuttitt, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 229. Additionally, all but one of the policy-or-practice claims alleges\n\na violation of “procedural requirements of the FOIA.” The only exception are the claims related\n\nto the Work With Policy (Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, and Sixteen of No. 11-444), which allege a\n\npolicy or practice of the CIA violating its own FOIA regulation, 32 C.F.R. § 1900.12(c), not the\n\nprocedural requirements of the FOIA itself. See FAC ¶¶ 71–86, NSC II. Therefore, the Court\n\n“has the power under FOIA and Payne to provide the requested declaratory and injunctive\n\nremedies” with respect to all of the policy-or-practice claims except the claims related to the\n\nWork With Policy, which are properly addressed under the APA. Muttitt, 813 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n229. As a result of this conclusion, APA relief is foreclosed with respect to the Aggregate Data\n\nPolicy, the Administrative Appeals Policy, the Reasonably Describe Policy, the Withheld\n\nDocument Non-Identification Policy, the Document-Level Exemption Policy, and the Glomar\n\nResponse Policy because the FOIA itself can provide the plaintiff with an adequate equitable\n\nremedy, assuming of course that the plaintiff has stated a claim for relief with respect to each of\n\nthose policies. Therefore, all of the plaintiff’s APA claims related to those policies—Counts\n\n\n20\n   The claims related to the Reasonably Describe Policy (Counts Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen of No. 11-444),\nhowever, could be considered as a more general challenge to agency action. Those claims challenge the CIA’s\nformal interpretation of the term “reasonably describe” and allege that interpretation is “significantly and\nconsistently broader than is allowed by FOIA.” See FAC ¶¶ 58, 63, NSC II. This sort of across-the-board challenge\nto an agency’s formal interpretation of a statute is “typically seen in litigation under the [APA], as the APA\nexpressly provides for such judicial review.” Bensman v. Nat’l Park Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (D.D.C 2011).\nNevertheless, although the plaintiff’s challenge to the Reasonably Describe Policy may have broader application, it\nstill challenges a policy that is allegedly being applied “in connection with the processing of the plaintiff’s FOIA\nrequests” and that is allegedly “violating procedural requirements of FOIA.” Muttitt, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 229. Thus,\nthe Court is satisfied that this sort of challenge is within the Court’s jurisdiction under the FOIA, even though it\nwould also clearly fall within the Court’s jurisdiction under the APA.\n\n\n\n                                                        42\n\fThree, Six, and Twelve of No. 11-444, Counts Nineteen and Twenty-One of No. 11-445, and the\n\nAPA component of the “FOIA/APA” claim in Count Fourteen of No. 11-445—will be dismissed\n\nfor lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Likewise, because the claims related to the Work With\n\nPolicy challenge conduct outside the Court’s FOIA jurisdiction, the Court does not have the\n\npower to remedy the FOIA claim related to that policy (Count Fourteen of No. 11-444). Hence,\n\nCount Fourteen of No. 11-444 will also be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n                 2.       Mandamus Act Claims\n\n        The CIA also moves to dismiss the plaintiff’s four remaining Mandamus Act claims on\n\nthe grounds that the plaintiff has failed to plead a claim for relief under that statute and that the\n\nCourt lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over those claims. See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 5–6; Defs.’\n\n445 Mem. at 5–6. This includes the Mandamus Act claims related to the Aggregate Data Policy\n\n(Count Four of No. 11-444), the Administrative Appeals Policy (Count Seven of No. 11-444),\n\nthe Reasonably Describe Policy (Count Thirteen of No. 11-444), and the Work With Policy\n\n(Count Sixteen of No. 11-444). To adequately plead a claim for relief under the Mandamus Act,\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1361, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) the plaintiff has a clear right to relief; (2) the\n\ndefendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) there is no other adequate remedy available to the\n\nplaintiff. See In re Medicare Reimbursement Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186517\"><a href=\"/opinion/186517/in-re-medicare-reim/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (D.C.

Circuit has held that, to the extent the court must determine whether a “clear and compelling” duty\nexists, “mandamus jurisdiction under § 1361 merges with the merits” because if no “clear and compelling” duty\nexists, the claim fails and the court also has no jurisdiction over the claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1361.

See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 5–6; Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 5–\n\n6. The plaintiff’s only response is to argue that, although its Mandamus Act claims are\n\nduplicative of its FOIA and APA claims, “this is not a fatal flaw in and of itself.” Pl.’s 444\n\nOpp’n at 4; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 4. In support of this argument, the plaintiff cites two cases from\n\nthis Court, which both refused to dismiss mandamus claims at the motion to dismiss stage. See\n\nPl.’s 444 Opp’n at 5 (citing Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Nat’l Energy Policy Dev.

Rather, the plaintiff only\n\naddresses the CIA’s arguments with respect to subject-matter jurisdiction and does not discuss\n\nthe CIA’s argument that the plaintiff has failed to state claims for mandamus-style relief. See\n\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n\fPl.’s 444 Opp’n at 4; Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 4. 23 Indeed, the plaintiff’s citation to Judicial Watch,\n\nInc. v. National Energy Policy Development Group presumes that the plaintiff has already\n\npleaded claims for mandamus-style relief. Although that case held that “it would be premature\n\nand inappropriate to determine whether the relief of mandamus will or will not issue” at the\n\nmotion to dismiss stage, that holding was still premised on the determination “that plaintiffs have\n\nstated a claim for relief under the mandamus statute.” See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2447908\"><a href=\"/opinion/2447908/judicial-watch-v-national-energy-policy-develop/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The plaintiff’s\n\nmandamus claims in the instant actions may be dismissed on this ground alone because the Court\n\nmay treat the plaintiff’s failure to oppose the defendant’s 12(b)(6) arguments as a decision to\n\nconcede those arguments. See Shankar v. ACS-GSI, 258 F. App’x 344, 345 (D.C.

The FOIA itself is the source of\n\nwhat the plaintiff views as the CIA’s clear duties to act and the plaintiff’s clear rights to relief,\n\nwhich underlie the plaintiff’s mandamus claims. See FAC ¶¶ 22, 25, 37, 39, 67, 69, 83, NSC II;\n\nFAC ¶¶ 113, 115, NSC III. Thus, to the extent a remedy would be available to the plaintiff under\n\n\n23\n  The CIA made it very clear in its motions to dismiss that it was seeking dismissal of the plaintiff’s mandamus\nclaims under both Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6). See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 5–6; Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 5–6.\n\n\n\n                                                        45\n\fthe Mandamus Act, an identical and adequate injunctive remedy would be available to the\n\nplaintiff under the FOIA. See Payne, 837 F.2d at 494 (“The FOIA imposes no limits on courts’\n\nequitable powers in enforcing its terms.”); Muttitt, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 228–29. Likewise to the\n\nextent that a remedy is unavailable to the plaintiff under the FOIA for any particular policy or\n\npractice, a remedy would be equally unavailable under the Mandamus Act. It necessarily\n\nfollows that the plaintiff cannot plead any facts that would show that there is no other adequate\n\nremedy available, and therefore all of the plaintiff’s remaining Mandamus Act claims—Counts\n\nFour, Seven, Thirteen, and Sixteen of No. 11-444—will be dismissed.\n\n        C.       Remaining Policy-or-Practice Claims\n\n        With the universe of remaining policy-or-practice claims now narrowed to the nine\n\ncauses of action alleged under the FOIA itself and the one cause of action under the APA, 24 the\n\nCourt will now discuss whether the plaintiff has succeeded in pleading a claim for relief for any\n\nof those alleged policies or practices. The CIA moves to dismiss each of these policy-or-practice\n\nclaims for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 12–20; Defs.’\n\n445 Mem. at 10–19.\n\n                 1.       Aggregate Data Policy\n\n        The plaintiff challenges the CIA’s alleged Aggregate Data Policy (i.e., refusing to\n\nprocess FOIA requests that seek “aggregate data”) in Count Two of No. 11-444. See FAC ¶¶ 12,\n\n14, NSC II. The requests for what the plaintiff terms “aggregate data” have sought database\n\nlistings sorted by various criteria. In particular, the plaintiff points to two examples of\n\n“aggregate data” requests that the CIA has refused to process: (1) a request for “database listings\n\nof all FOIA requesters from Fiscal Years 2008–2010 according to the fee categories to which\n\n\n24\n  Once again, these ten policies or practices exclude Assignment of Rights Policy discussed above. See discussion\nsupra Part III.A.1.\n\n\n\n                                                       46\n\fCIA assigned them,” and (2) a request for “a record that would indicate the ten individuals\n\nresponsible for the most FOIA requests submitted (each) in Fiscal Years 2008, 2009, and 2010.”\n\nId. ¶¶ 6, 42. The CIA refused to process these requests either on the grounds that its record\n\nsystems were not configured in a way that would allow it to perform an adequate search without\n\nan unreasonable effort or on the grounds that the FOIA does not require federal agencies to\n\ncreate records, collect information, conduct research, analyze data, or conduct unreasonable\n\nsearches. See Lutz Decl. Exs. E–H, L.\n\n       The CIA argues that the plaintiff’s challenge to the alleged Aggregate Data Policy should\n\nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim because, assuming that such a policy exists, it would not\n\nviolate the FOIA. See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 13–14. The CIA maintains that processing requests\n\nfor database listings would (a) require it to create new records, as opposed to merely producing\n\npreexisting records and/or (b) require it to conduct research, as opposed to merely performing a\n\nsearch. Id.; Reply in Supp. Def.’s Partial Mot. Dismiss Pl.’s First Am. Compl. (“Def.’s 444\n\nReply”) at 14, NSC II, ECF No. 18. The CIA further argues that, because the FOIA does not\n\nrequire agencies to create new records or conduct research, a policy of refusing to do so does not\n\nviolate the FOIA. Def.’s 444 Reply at 14. The plaintiff responds, however, that the act of\n\nsorting a database by certain criteria (e.g., fee category of requester) and providing a listing of\n\nthat database so sorted does not constitute creating new records or conducting research—rather,\n\nit merely constitutes performing a search and producing the results of that search. See Pl.’s 444\n\nOpp’n at 21.\n\n       The CIA is correct, and the plaintiff appears to agree, that “the FOIA imposes no duty on\n\nthe agency to create records.” Forsham v.

Congress provided in the Amendments that, “[g]overnment\n\nagencies should use new technology to enhance public access to agency records and\n\ninformation.” Id. § 2(a)(6), 110 Stat. at 3048.

Likewise, sorting a pre-existing database of information to make information\n\nintelligible does not involve the creation of a new record because, as Congress noted in the\n\nlegislative history to the E-FOIA Amendments, “[c]omputer records found in a database rather\n\nthan a file cabinet may require the application of codes or some form of programming to retrieve\n\nthe information.” H.R. Rep. 104-795, at 22. Sorting a database by a particular data field (e.g.,\n\ndate, category, title) is essentially “the application of codes or some form of programming,” and\n\nthus does not involve creating new records or conducting research—it is just another form of\n\nsearching that is within the scope of an agency’s duties in responding to FOIA requests.\n\n       Nevertheless, the distinction between searching and either performing research or\n\ncreating records remains somewhat muddled. In particular, there is a tension between the well-\n\nsettled prohibition against requiring agencies to conduct research and create records, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 49\n\fpolicy of the E-FOIA Amendments to bring the contents of electronic databases within the\n\nFOIA’s reach. When points of data are stored in a database, that data can often be manipulated\n\nin myriad ways, only some of which are likely to qualify as mere “searching” within the meaning\n\nof the FOIA. See, e.g., Labella v. FBI, No. 11-CV-0023, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">948567</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *12 n.12\n\n(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2012) (observing that “FOIA did not obligate the [defendant] to provide [the\n\nplaintiff] with ‘aggregate data’” where the plaintiff sought “‘aggregate data’ related to the victim\n\nclass and distinct subgroups of” the Supplemental Victimization Survey to the National Crime\n\nVictimization Survey). Although the E-FOIA Amendments condone “the application of codes or\n\nsome form of programming to retrieve the information” contained in an electronic database,\n\nneither the text of the statute nor the legislative history provides any guidance on when the\n\nmanipulation of data points in an electronic database through “the application of codes or some\n\nform of programming” crosses the all-important line between searching a database, on the one\n\nhand, and either creating a record or conducting research in a database on the other.\n\n       With this tension in mind, although the act of searching or sorting an electronic database\n\nis clearly not the creation of a record under the FOIA, the question remains whether producing a\n\nlisting of database search results involves the creation of a record. First, it is important to note\n\nthat it is not unprecedented for a federal agency to produce entire fields of data from particular\n\nelectronic databases in response to a FOIA request, see, e.g., Long v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2562907\"><a href=\"/opinion/2562907/long-v-us-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

This is because a particular listing or\n\nindex of the contents of a database would not necessarily have existed prior to a given FOIA\n\n\n\n\n                                                  50\n\frequest. For example, a request seeking “a database listing of the first 100 FOIA requests filed\n\nin Fiscal Year 2012,” may require the creation of a new record because the record being\n\nrequested—whether produced in the format of a printout, a “screen shot,” or something similar—\n25\n     is not necessarily something “that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.” Yeager,\n\n678 F.2d at 321. The same would be true of paper, rather than electronic, records. For example,\n\nif a FOIA request sought “an inventory of all non-electronic records created in 1962 regarding\n\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis,” an agency need not create an inventory if one did not already exist,\n\nthough the agency would need to release any such non-electronic records themselves if they were\n\nrequested and were not exempt from disclosure. Therefore, a FOIA request for a listing or index\n\nof a database’s contents that does not seek the contents of the database, but instead essentially\n\nseeks information about those contents, is a request that requires the creation of a new record,\n\ninsofar as the agency has not previously created and retained such a listing or index. 26 See\n\nPeople for the American Way, 451 F. Supp. 2d at 15 (producing a “list of records returned from\n\n[a database] search” is “something that FOIA does not mandate” because “the list was not\n\npreviously created or obtained by the agency” and “an order that defendant produce such a list\n\nwould be tantamount to requiring the defendant to create an agency record”).\n\n\n\n25\n  These were the sort of records sought by the plaintiff in its requests for “aggregate data.” See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex.\nA at 1 (seeking “a list, index, printout, or similar document”); id. Ex. B at 1, 4, 7, 10 (seeking “database listing[s]”);\nid. Ex. E at 53 (seeking “an index or comparable list”). The first two of these requests were incorporated by\nreference in the First Amended Complaint. See FAC ¶¶ 6, 42, NSC II.\n26\n   Similarly, requests for aggregate data, even if they seek data itself rather than a database listing or index, may\nnevertheless require an agency to perform research in response to a FOIA request—something courts have long held\nagencies are also not required to do. See, e.g., Hudgins, 620 F. Supp. at 21. Congress contemplated this possibility\nin the E-FOIA Amendments by stating that when an agency responds to a FOIA request, it “shall make reasonable\nefforts to search for the records in electronic form or format, except when such efforts would significantly interfere\nwith the operation of the agency’s automated information system.” Pub. L. No. 104-231, § 5, 110 Stat. at 3050.\nThus, if a FOIA request for “aggregate data” would require an unreasonably burdensome electronic search within\nthe confines of an agency’s automated information system, an agency need not conduct the search. See, e.g., Wolf v.\nCIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518460\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518460/wolf-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Whether or not the claim can survive depends upon whether, in light of\n\nthe specific examples of “aggregate data” requests provided by the plaintiff in its First Amended\n\nComplaint (i.e., Counts One and Eight), it would be reasonable to construe the plaintiff’s\n\nallegations to include requests for aggregate data itself, as opposed to including only requests for\n\n“database listings” or “printouts” of such listings. The plaintiff seems to contend that a request\n\nfor a “database listing” or “printout” of such a listing is a proper FOIA request on its face, see\n\nPl.’s 444 Opp’n at 20–21, which is incorrect, as the Court’s discussion above makes clear. One\n\nof the two specific FOIA requests that the plaintiff alleges as an example of an “aggregate data”\n\nrequest, however, sought, in the alternative, the underlying records themselves, see id. Ex. A at 2\n\n(seeking, in the alternative, “[a]ll FOIA request letters submitted to the CIA for each year”),\n\nwhich would not require the creation of a record. 27 Even so, this single request is insufficient to\n\nallege the existence of a policy or practice of the CIA refusing to produce the contents of an\n\nelectronic database because it could just as easily have been an isolated incident. See Iqbal, 556\n\nU.S. at 678 (complaint must plead facts that are more than “‘merely consistent with’ a\n\ndefendant’s liability”). Therefore, the plaintiff has failed to state claim for relief challenging the\n\nCIA’s alleged Aggregate Data Policy, and Count Two in No. 11-444 will be dismissed.\n\n        The Court pauses, however, to note the perverse practical consequences of the CIA’s\n\nchoice to refuse to provide database listings in response to FOIA requests. The FOIA requires\n\nagencies to disclose all non-exempt data points that it retains in electronic databases, see, e.g.,\n\n27\n The FOIA request that contains this alternative request is incorporated by reference in the First Amended\nComplaint. See FAC ¶ 42, NSC II.\n\n\n\n                                                        52\n\fLong, 450 F. Supp. 2d at 48, and thus although the CIA may not be required to produce an index\n\nor database listing in response to a FOIA request, it can be required to hand over the contents of\n\nentire databases of information to the extent those contents are not exempt from disclosure. 28\n\nAlthough producing the contents of a database would likely involve the same search burden upon\n\nan agency as producing a database listing, the production of a database listing would entail a\n\nsubstantially lighter production burden upon the agency. Despite the fact that the CIA can\n\ncontinue to escape the production of database listings under the FOIA if it wishes, the CIA may\n\nnevertheless find it more efficient to begin producing such database listings upon request\n\nbecause failing to do so may prompt requesters to seek the reams of data underlying such listings\n\ninstead. 29\n\n                 2.       Reasonably Describe Policy\n\n        The plaintiff challenges the CIA’s alleged Resonably Describe policy in Count Eleven of\n\nNo. 11-444, claiming that the CIA regularly refuses to process FOIA requests that the CIA\n\ndeems not to “reasonably describe” the records sought. See FAC ¶¶ 56–61, NSC II. The\n\nplaintiff claims that this behavior constitutes a policy or practice of applying a definition of the\n\nFOIA’s “reasonably describes” requirement that “is significantly and consistently broader than is\n\nallowed by FOIA.” FAC ¶ 58, NSC II. In the same vein, the plaintiff alleges that “[i]n a\n\nmajority of these cases, CIA has cited the configuration of its records systems as a disqualifying\n\nfactor.” Id. Ultimately, the plaintiff takes issue with two aspects of the CIA’s interpretation of\n\n\n\n28\n  In fact, the Executive Office for the U.S. Attorneys “regularly releases national caseload statistical data in\nresponse to monthly requests under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts.” The United States Attorneys\nOffice—FOIA/PA Reading Room, http://www.justice.gov/usao/reading_room/data/CaseStats.htm (last visited Oct.\n17, 2012). The CIA could potentially be subject to similar monthly reporting of its database of FOIA request\ninformation.\n29\n  It also may prompt Congress to supplement current annual FOIA reporting requirements to include aggregate\ndata, such as the total number of FOIA requesters organized by fee category or the ten most prolific FOIA requesters\nto an agency in a given fiscal year. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(e)(1).\n\n\n\n                                                        53\n\fthe FOIA’s “reasonably describes” requirement. First, the plaintiff claims that the CIA has\n\ninappropriately restricted the term “reasonably describe” by requiring requests to be couched “in\n\nterms of the request’s compatibility with existing indexing systems.” Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 23.\n\nSecond, the plaintiff claims that the defendant has adopted an overbroad interpretation of terms\n\nlike “relating to” and “pertaining to” in concluding that those terms render descriptions\n\nunreasonably vague. See Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s 444 Summ. J. Opp’n”) at\n\n19, NSC II, ECF No. 26. 30\n\n         Beginning with the first aspect, the CIA argues that the plaintiff’s challenge to the\n\nReasonably Describe Policy should be dismissed for failure to state a claim because determining\n\nwhether a request reasonably describes the records sought “depends both on the nature of the\n\nrequest and the type of records system an agency has.” Def.’s 444 Mem. at 16. In support of\n\nthis argument, the CIA cites its own FOIA regulation, which states:\n\n         A request need only reasonably describe the records of interest. This means that\n         documents must be described sufficiently to enable a professional employee\n         familiar with the subject to locate the documents with a reasonable effort.\n         Commonly this equates to a requirement that the documents must be locatable\n         through the indexing of our various systems.\n\n32 C.F.R. § 1900.12 (emphasis added). The CIA’s FOIA regulations also define reasonably\n\ndescribed records to mean “a description of a document (record) by unique identification number\n\nor descriptive terms which permit an Agency employee to locate documents with reasonable\n\neffort given existing indices and finding aids.” Id. § 1900.02(m) (emphasis added). In response,\n\nhowever, the plaintiff likewise cites these regulations, but it argues that their language\n\n“restricting th[e] definition [of ‘reasonably describes’] in terms of the request’s compatibility\n30\n  Indeed, the plaintiff goes so far as to argue in its opposition to the CIA’s motion for summary judgment in No. 11-\n444 that it “feels comfortable in saying” that the defendant’s overbroad interpretation of terms like “relating to” and\n“pertaining to” is “likely the worst component of the ‘overbroad application of “reasonably describe”’ pattern or\npractice it seeks to overturn in Count 11,” Pl.’s 444 Summ. J. Opp’n at 19, even though the plaintiff failed to\nreference this argument at all in its opposition to the CIA’s motion to dismiss. The Court will address this argument\nanyway, in the interest of providing a comprehensive analysis of the plaintiff’s challenge.\n\n\n\n                                                          54\n\fwith existing index systems is an impermissible interpretation of Congress’s intent and therefore\n\nmust be rejected.” Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 23.\n\n        Whether or not the CIA’s interpretation of the term “reasonably describes” in the FOIA is\n\ninconsistent with the FOIA is a purely legal question of statutory interpretation that the Court\n\nwill review de novo.

L. No. 93-502, § 1(b)(1), 88 Stat. 1561, 1561 (1974).\n\n\n\n31\n  Thus, the question of whether or not a request “reasonably describes” the requested records is a threshold\nadministrative inquiry. An agency need not make records available to a requester unless and until a requester\n“reasonably describes such records.” Hence, there is a meaningful difference between a broadly sweeping yet\n“reasonably describe[d]” FOIA request, which might trigger the agency’s duties to communicate and cooperate with\nrequesters under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B)(ii), and a request that fails to meet the threshold of “reasonably\ndescrib[ing]” the records in the first place.\n\n\n\n                                                      55\n\fThe Senate Judiciary Committee Report accompanying this amendment stated that, “the\n\nidentification standard in the FOIA should not be used to obstruct public access to agency\n\nrecords” and the amendment “makes explicit the liberal standard for identification that Congress\n\nintended.” S. Rep. No. 93-854, at 10 (1974). The House Committee on Government Operations\n\nReport accompanying the amendment clarified that, “a ‘description’ of a requested document\n\nwould be sufficient if it enabled a professional employee of the agency who was familiar with\n\nthe subject area of the request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort.” H.R.\n\nRep. No. 93-876, at 5–6. The D.C. Circuit has held, in this regard, that “[t]he linchpin inquiry”\n\nin determining whether a request “reasonably describes” the records sought is “whether the\n\nagency is able to determine ‘precisely what records [are] being requested.’” Yeager, 678 F.2d at\n\n326 (alteration in original) (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-854, at 10).\n\n       The CIA argues that, “[b]ecause the way [its] records system is configured directly\n\naffects whether a CIA professional employee can locate requested documents with a reasonable\n\namount of effort, the configuration of its records system is a proper factor for [it] to consider in\n\ndetermining whether a FOIA communication adequately describes the requested records.”\n\nDef.’s 444 Mem. at 16–17. In support of this argument, the CIA cites two cases from this Court\n\nthat discussed an agency’s ability to consider the configuration of its own records system in\n\nresponding to FOIA requests.

See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 23–24. As the defendant correctly points out, however,\n\nthe legislative history does not “directly mention whether an agency can consider the\n\nconfiguration of its records in determining whether a FOIA request reasonably describes the\n\nrecords sought.” Def.’s 444 Reply at 16.\n\n        Reading between the lines of the plaintiff’s brief, it appears that the plaintiff essentially\n\nconcedes that an agency is allowed to consider the configuration of its records systems in\n\nresponding to a FOIA request. In fact, the plaintiff’s brief cites no authority that would\n\ncontradict that principle. The plaintiff’s argument is focused more on the principle that an\n\nagency cannot disingenuously hide behind the configuration of its records systems in an attempt\n\nto thwart otherwise proper FOIA requests. See, e.g., Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 24 (arguing that the 1974\n\nFOIA amendment, adding the term “reasonably describes,” was “supposed to ‘directly aid\n\ncitizens in obtaining Government documents’”). Without addressing the merits of this latter\n\nprinciple, the Court simply notes that such a principle is irrelevant to deciding the first question\n\npresented by the plaintiff’s policy or practice claim, i.e., whether the FOIA permits agencies to\n\nconsider the configuration of their records systems in deciding whether a FOIA request\n\n“reasonably describes” the records sought.\n\n        On that question, the defendant clearly has the better of the argument. It has been the law\n\nin this Circuit for nearly 35 years that:\n\n        [A]n agency is not required to reorganize its files in response to a plaintiff’s\n        request in the form in which it was made, and that if an agency has not previously\n        segregated the requested class of records production may be required only where\n        the agency can identify that material with reasonable effort.\n\nGoland v.

This principle is perfectly consistent with the legislative history cited by the\n\n\n\n                                                  57\n\fplaintiff, which states that a request reasonably describes records sought when it would enable an\n\ninformed agency employee to locate the records “with a reasonable amount of effort.” H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 93-876, at 6. The legislative history did not sweep as broadly as the plaintiff suggests\n\nbecause the legislative history indicates that Congress was more narrowly concerned that\n\nagencies were requiring requesters to cite “a specific title or file number” in their requests, see id.\n\nat 5; see also 120 Cong. Rec. 6,809 (1974) (statement of Rep. Thorne), not that agencies were\n\ntaking the configuration of their records systems into account more generally. It would be\n\nunreasonable to require agencies to throw practical considerations to the wind in deciding\n\nwhether they can process FOIA requests because, although the FOIA regime undoubtedly seeks\n\nto “directly aid citizens in obtaining Government documents,” it also strives to achieve that goal\n\nwithout trampling on the agency’s prerogative to organize and manage its records in a reasonably\n\nefficient manner. In other words, an agency is presumably unable “to determine ‘precisely what\n\nrecords [are] being requested’” when it cannot perform a reasonable search for the requested\n\nrecords within the limitations of how its records systems are configured. See Yeager, 678 F.2d at\n\n326.\n\n       The search at issue in Goland is a useful example. In that case, the plaintiff sought\n\ndocuments related to the legislative history and passage of the National Security Act of 1974 and\n\nthe CIA Act of 1949, as well as two bills introduced into Congress in 1948 providing for the\n\nadministration of the CIA. Goland, 607 F.2d at 342–43. In particular, the plaintiff sought any\n\ndocuments produced from congressional reports or hearings related to these laws and also “any\n\nmaterials which may have been the basis for testimony at hearings or materials used by or\n\nsubmitted by the CIA or other Executive Branch sources which are included in unpublished\n\nreports on the cited bills.” Id. at 343 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). The CIA\n\n\n\n\n                                                  58\n\fconducted a search for such records, but it averred in affidavits that it had “no indices or\n\ncompendiums identifying records as ‘preparatory documents for congressional testimony,” and\n\nthus “any additional records of this description, if they exist, could be found only by ‘a page-by-\n\npage search’ through the ‘84,000 cubic feet of documents in the CIA Records Center.’” Id. at\n\n353 (alteration omitted). The D.C. Circuit upheld the adequacy of this search, holding that the\n\nCIA’s affidavits “plainly show[ed] that the effort required to locate the hypothesized ‘back-up’\n\ndocuments [prepared for use at these hearings] would be unreasonable here.” Id. at 353–54.\n\nThus, Goland recognized the fact that the “reasonable efforts” that an agency is required to put\n\nforth in locating requested documents is bounded, at least in part, by the configuration of an\n\nagency’s records systems. It stands to reason that this principle applies to all stages of the\n\nprocessing of a FOIA request, including the threshold decision of whether to process the request\n\nat all. 32\n\n             The plaintiff is still correct in asserting that an agency may not hide behind the\n\nlimitations of its own records systems in refusing to process FOIA requests, but this the plaintiff\n\nhas not alleged in its First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff’s policy-or-practice claim\n\nchallenging the alleged Reasonably Describe Policy (Count Eleven in No. 11-444) only alleges\n\n\n32\n  The Court recognizes the hydraulic effect that this logical extension of Goland and its progeny could potentially\nhave upon FOIA litigation: If agencies are permitted to cite the configuration of their records systems in refusing to\nprocess a request as not “reasonably described,” or as requiring an unduly burdensome search, requesters would be\npushed to seek judicial review of agencies’ FOIA responses at an earlier stage in the FOIA process. This is only\nproblematic to the extent that agencies choose to abuse this power by hiding behind the configuration of their\nrecords systems in refusing to process otherwise properly framed requests. Agencies that see this doctrinal\nextension as an invitation to artfully dodge FOIA requests they would rather not process would be short-sighted,\nhowever, since such a choice would entail perverse consequences. If an agency chooses to rely too heavily on the\n“reasonably describes” requirement to get rid of broad or pesky FOIA requests at their inception, rather than\nembracing the spirit of the agency’s obligations under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B) to “provide the person an opportunity\nto limit the scope of the request” or “an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for\nprocessing the request or a modified request,” that agency will subject its FOIA processing practices to judicial\nscrutiny and supervision at a much earlier point in time than would otherwise be necessary. The Court presumes\nthat agencies will generally choose the path outlined in § 552(a)(6)(B)—which is triggered with a proper request—\nand responsibly exercise their discretion in deciding when to refuse to process FOIA requests because of the\nconfiguration of their records systems.\n\n\n\n                                                         59\n\fthat the CIA’s citation to the configuration of its records system is, as a general matter, an\n\ninappropriate basis to conclude that a requester has failed to reasonably describe the records\n\nsought. See FAC ¶¶ 57–61, NSC II. That claim under Golan must be dismissed because its legal\n\npremise is incorrect as a matter of law.\n\n         The second aspect of the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Reasonably Describe\n\nPolicy is also unavailing, but for a different reason. The plaintiff argues that the CIA interprets\n\ntoo broadly terms like “relating to” and “pertaining to” in FOIA requests, and the CIA allegedly\n\nrelies on those overbroad interpretations to conclude that FOIA requests do not reasonably\n\ndescribe the records sought. See Pl.’s 444 Summ. J. Opp’n at 19 (arguing that the CIA has a\n\n“misguided rule that any request that contains the words ‘pertaining to,’ ‘related to,’ or ‘relating\n\nto’ is automatically overbroad whenever [the CIA] does not feel like processing it”). The\n\nproblem with this aspect of the plaintiff’s challenge is that, unlike the first aspect, it does not\n\nfocus on a formal interpretation of the “reasonably describes” requirement. Rather, the plaintiff\n\nis arguing that the CIA has implemented a loose practice of concluding that many, perhaps\n\nmost, 33 requests that use the phrases “relating to,” “pertaining to,” and the like do not reasonably\n\ndescribe the records sought. This fails to state claim in the abstract because, short of a\n\ncategorical refusal to process any requests that contain these phrases, an agency is permitted to\n\nassess the language of each FOIA request that it receives in order to determine whether it\n\n“reasonably describes” the records it seeks.\n\n\n\n\n33\n  Although the plaintiff intimates that the CIA categorically refuses to process FOIA requests that contain the\nphrases “relating to” or “pertaining to,” that insinuation is refuted by the plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, which\nincludes a claim that the CIA processed, but found no records responsive to, a FOIA request for “all records\npertaining to guidelines for attorneys in the Office of General Counsel (“OGC”) for the conduct of civil cases,\nespecially pertaining to interactions between OGC attorneys and Department of Justice (“DOJ”) attorneys.” FAC\n¶¶ 105, 107, NSC II.\n\n\n\n                                                          60\n\f         The Court nevertheless finds troubling the plaintiff’s claim that the CIA is systematically\n\nattempting to overuse the “reasonably describes” requirement because such an abuse of the\n\nFOIA’s statutory language would result in a large swath of FOIA requests never even getting\n\nprocessed, even though they should be. 34 This is particularly disturbing in light of Congress’s\n\nexplicit admonition that agencies are not to use the “reasonably describes” requirement “to\n\nobstruct public access to agency records.” S. Rep. No. 93-854, at 10. Federal courts’\n\njurisdiction under the FOIA is not limited to denials of requests that reasonably describe the\n\nrecords sought, and an agency is not the final arbiter of whether a FOIA request “reasonably\n\ndescribes” the records it seeks. Thus, a FOIA requester dissatisfied with an agency’s decision\n\nabout whether a request “reasonably describes” the records it seeks may seek judicial review of\n\nthat question. See discussion infra Part III.C.3.a. Indeed, the CIA implicitly concedes this\n\naspect of the Court’s jurisdiction because it has not moved to dismiss the two claims by the\n\nplaintiff that the CIA has improperly refused to process particular FOIA requests deemed not to\n\nreasonably describe the records sought. See FAC ¶¶ 46–55, NSC II. Even so, the question of\n\nwhether a particular FOIA request “reasonably describes” the records sought is a highly context-\n\nspecific inquiry, ill-suited to abstract analysis without a formal (or at least officially\n\nacknowledged) agency interpretation of the “reasonably describes” requirement. Lacking such\n\nan official agency interpretation with respect to the second aspect of its challenge to the CIA’s\n\nalleged Reasonably Describe Policy, the plaintiff and requesters like it are limited to challenging\n\nindividual refusals to process FOIA requests on the basis that the request does not reasonably\n\ndescribe the records sought.\n\n34\n  The plaintiff directs the Court to “nineteen of Defendant’s most egregiously questionable determinations that\nrequests allegedly failed to reasonably describe the records sought.” Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 26. Although the Court\ndoes not consider this evidence in ruling upon the CIA’s motion to dismiss, it is worth observing that some of these\nexamples include rather specific requests, such as a request for “a copy of all publications/reports made by the\n[Director of National Intelligence] Open Source Center for January of 2009.” See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n Ex. E at 37.\n\n\n\n                                                         61\n\f               3.      Administrative Appeals Policy and Work With Policy\n\n       Under the FOIA, once an agency has received a request, it has twenty days within which\n\nto determine “whether to comply with such request,” and the agency must also “immediately\n\nnotify the person making such request of such determination” and “of the right of such person to\n\nappeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). The\n\nFOIA does not explicitly define the term “adverse determination.” Additionally, under the\n\nCIA’s FOIA regulations, any communications “which do not meet the[] requirements [of\n\nreasonably describing the records sought and not requiring an unreasonable search] will be\n\nconsidered an expression of interest and the Agency will work with, and offer suggestions to, the\n\npotential requester in order to define a request properly.” 32 C.F.R. § 1900.12(c).\n\n       The plaintiff challenges the CIA’s alleged Administrative Appeals Policy in Count Five\n\nof No. 11-444 by alleging that when the CIA refuses to process a request that it deems improper,\n\nthe CIA has a policy or practice of refusing the requester’s right to administratively appeal that\n\ndecision. FAC ¶¶ 28–29, NSC II. The plaintiff claims that “[a]n agency’s duty to adjudicate\n\nadministrative appeals of any negative determinations is a cornerstone of FOIA’s due process\n\nframework,” and therefore it avers that this alleged policy or practice violates the FOIA. Id.\n\n¶¶ 27, 29. The CIA argues that this claim should be dismissed because an agency’s\n\ndetermination that a FOIA request is improper or invalid does not qualify as an “adverse\n\ndetermination” that would trigger the right to administrative appeal under the statute, and\n\ntherefore its policy of refusing the right of administrative appeal when a request is deemed\n\nimproper or invalid is consistent with the FOIA. See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 14–15. Yet, the\n\nplaintiff responds that if the FOIA allows agencies to refuse the right to an administrative appeal,\n\n“the exhaustion doctrine is effectively turned on its head” leaving requesters “forced to speculate\n\nabout [the agency’s] reasons for its actions in a vacuum.” See Pl.’s 444 Opp’n at 22.\n\n\n                                                 62\n\f       To better understand the context of the plaintiff’s position, however, it is helpful also to\n\nconsider a related policy or practice alleged by the plaintiff. The plaintiff also challenges the\n\nCIA’s alleged Work With Policy in Count Fifteen of No. 11-444, claiming that when the CIA\n\ndeems a FOIA request improper or invalid, it habitually fails to contact the requester and “work\n\nwith, and offer suggestions to, the potential requester in order to define a request properly,” as\n\nrequired by the CIA’s own regulations. See FAC ¶ 74, NSC II. The CIA argues that this claim\n\nshould also be dismissed because the plaintiff has failed to “establish that the CIA has a policy or\n\npractice of not working with potential FOIA requesters,” citing two of the examples of improper\n\nrequests in the plaintiff’s Complaint, which include suggestions from the CIA about how to\n\nrefine the scope of the requests. See Def.’s 444 Mem. at 18–19.\n\n       Combining these two alleged policies or practices, the plaintiff is claiming that the CIA\n\nhas all but nullified agency consideration of requests that are deemed improper or invalid: The\n\nalleged Work With Policy prevents requesters from refining improper requests to make them\n\namenable to processing, and the alleged Administrative Appeals Policy leaves requesters with no\n\navenue for administrative review of whether the determination was appropriate. The question is\n\nwhether the FOIA and the APA permit this state of affairs. Though these two alleged policies\n\nare related, the legal analysis applied to these alleged policies will differ because the\n\nAdministrative Appeals Policy is an alleged violation of the FOIA itself, while the Work With\n\nPolicy is an alleged violation of the CIA’s regulation. Thus, the Administrative Appeals Policy\n\nwill be evaluated under the FOIA, while the Work With Policy will be evaluated under the APA.\n\n                       a)      The Alleged Administrative Appeals Policy Fails to State a Claim\n                               under the FOIA\n\n       As to the Administrative Appeals Policy, the plaintiff’s claim can only survive if the\n\nFOIA requires agencies to provide an administrative appeal from a determination that a request\n\n\n\n                                                  63\n\fis improper. In other words, it can survive only if a determination that a request is improper\n\nqualifies as an “adverse determination” under the FOIA. Once again, this raises a question of\n\nstatutory interpretation.\n\n       Many courts have recognized that an agency’s disclosure duties under the FOIA are not\n\ntriggered until a proper FOIA request is submitted.

Dep’t of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537606\"><a href=\"/opinion/537606/marc-truitt-v-department-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 544 (D.C.

U.S. Dep’t of Army,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552329\"><a href=\"/opinion/552329/carl-oglesby-v-the-united-states-department-of-the-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (D.C. Cir. 1990).\n\n       This case presents the question of whether a particular agency response is a\n\n“determination” that would require the agency to provide for administrative exhaustion in the\n\nform of an administrative appeal. The cases in this Circuit, including Oglesby, however, have\n\nonly addressed the inverse question, i.e., whether an agency response was a “determination” that\n\nrequired the requester to exhaust its administrative remedies. Thus, the Circuit’s definition of a\n\nresponse that “is sufficient for purposes of requiring an administrative appeal,” articulated in\n\n\n\n\n                                                  64\n\fOglesby, sheds no light on the question presented in this case because it defines such a response,\n\nin part, by whether the agency has provided “notice of the right of the requester to appeal to the\n\nhead of the agency.” Id.; see also Hall & Assocs. v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240 (D.D.C.\n\n2012) (holding that agency response was not “adverse determination” where the agency response\n\ndid not notify the requester of its right to administrative appeal). For purposes of the question\n\npresented in the instant case (whether an agency must provide an administrative appeal), the\n\ndefinition of an adverse determination outlined in Oglesby (a determination that includes the\n\nright of administrative appeal) is merely circular. In other words, Oglesby and the instant case\n\nreside on opposite sides of the same coin—Oglesby deals with when a requester must pursue an\n\nadministrative appeal, and the instant case deals with when an agency must provide an\n\nadministrative appeal.\n\n        The language and structure of the FOIA nevertheless provide a reasonably clear answer\n\nto the question raised by the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s Administrative Appeals Policy.\n\nThe FOIA states that, “upon any [proper] request,” i.e., a request “made under paragraph (1), (2),\n\nor (3) of this subsection,” 35 the agency “shall . . . determine within 20 days . . . after the receipt\n\nof any such request whether to comply with such request.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A) (emphasis\n\nadded). This language makes clear that an agency has no duty to make any “determination” with\n\nregard to a FOIA request unless that request is proper. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the\n\nterm “adverse determination” in 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i) only contemplates agency decisions\n\nthat are in response to a proper FOIA request. In other words, the FOIA does not require\n\nagencies to provide administrative appeals on the issue of whether a request is proper in the first\n\n\n\n35\n   The relevant paragraph for FOIA requests is paragraph (3), which is the paragraph that requires requests to\n“reasonably describe[]” the records sought. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3). The instant cases do not implicate requests\nmade under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1) or § 552(a)(2).\n\n\n\n                                                        65\n\fplace. Therefore, the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Administrative Appeals Policy\n\n(Count Five in No. 11-444) will be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n\n       Again, however, this result may entail perverse consequences for the CIA. As discussed\n\nabove, the unavailability of an administrative appeal would not preclude a requester from\n\nseeking judicial review of an agency’s decision that a request is improper, and the CIA does not\n\ncontend otherwise. See discussion supra Part III.C.2. At the very least, such an agency decision\n\nwould be presumptively reviewable under the APA, if not the FOIA itself. See, e.g., Council for\n\nUrological Interests v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708–09 (D.C.

In such a circumstance, a\n\nrequester’s failure to exhaust its administrative remedies does not bar judicial review because,\n\nwhen an agency makes a conscious choice not to provide a party with administrative process, the\n\nagency constructively waives the requirement of administrative exhaustion.

A party appearing before an administrative body\n\ncannot be punished for the agency’s choice to shoot itself in the foot by refusing to review its\n\nown decisions. In this way, the refusal of the CIA to provide administrative appeals in these\n\ncircumstances could be viewed as a boon to FOIA requesters because it expedites a requester’s\n\nability to seek judicial review of an agency’s decisions that a particular request does not\n\n\n\n\n                                                 66\n\freasonably describe records sought or otherwise fails to comply with the agency’s FOIA\n\nregulations.\n\n       To the extent the CIA’s failure to provide administrative appeals to requesters regarding\n\nwhether a request “reasonably describes” records is an attempt to divert FOIA cases from the\n\nagency’s docket to the dockets of the federal courts, however, the CIA may try the patience of\n\njudges called upon to adjudicate these claims because they consume scarce judicial resources on\n\nquestions that could easily, and perhaps more appropriately, be addressed at the administrative\n\nlevel. The Court also recognizes that the effect on the plaintiff and other FOIA requesters (not to\n\nmention taxpayers) from the agency’s diversion of these claims to the courts is an expensive one,\n\nforcing requesters and the government alike to expend time and money litigating these claims.\n\nIn sum, although the FOIA permits the CIA to continue this alleged policy, the CIA should\n\ncarefully consider the prudence of doing so.\n\n                       b)     The Alleged Work With Policy Fails to State a Claim Under the\n                              APA\n\n       The plaintiff’s related claim regarding the CIA’s alleged Work With Policy fails to state a\n\nclaim under the APA. The CIA does not contest that it has a clear duty to “work with, and offer\n\nsuggestions to” potential requesters who have submitted improper requests “in order to define a\n\nrequest properly.” See 32 C.F.R. § 1900.12(c). Thus, the CIA also does not appear to contest\n\nthat a policy, in the form of a “final agency action,” which refuses to “work with, and offer\n\nsuggestions to” potential requesters would violate its own regulation and could be set aside under\n\nthe APA as agency action that is “without observance of procedure required by law.” See 5\n\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(D). The CIA’s only argument in favor of dismissal is that the plaintiff “cannot\n\nestablish that the CIA has a policy or practice of not working with potential FOIA requesters,”\n\npointing to “examples of the CIA working with and offering suggestions to” the plaintiff, which\n\n\n\n                                                67\n\fare contained in the plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint.

As it relates to the APA claim challenging the CIA’s alleged Work With\n\nPolicy (Count Fifteen in No. 11-444), the Court construes the defendant’s argument to be that the\n\nplaintiff has failed to allege a “final agency action,” which is required to state a claim under the\n\nAPA.

In\n\nother words, the plaintiff complains of “the continuing (and thus constantly changing) operations\n\nof the [CIA] in reviewing [FOIA requests],” which is “no more an identifiable ‘agency action’—\n\nmuch less a ‘final agency action’—than a ‘weapons procurement program’ of the Department of\n\nDefense or a ‘drug interdiction program’ of the Drug Enforcement Administration.” Id. at 890.\n\n       The plaintiff does not claim that the alleged Work With Policy is pursuant to any\n\nofficially acknowledged agency rule or policy in place at the CIA. Nor does the plaintiff allege\n\nthat this “policy, practice, or standard operating procedure” of the CIA is mandatory upon\n\nagency officials. The plaintiff merely observes that the CIA has consistently refused to “work\n\nwith” FOIA requesters on a number of occasions.

Cut-Off Date Policy\n\n         The Court next addresses the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Cut-Off Date\n\nPolicy. The plaintiff claims that, pursuant to this alleged policy, the CIA “applies an arbitrary\n\n‘date of response’ cut-off date” on FOIA requests “regardless of the nature of the request or the\n\nanticipated length of the search.” FAC ¶ 113, NSC II. An agency rule establishing a temporal\n\nlimit to its search efforts under the FOIA “is only valid when the limitation is consistent with the\n\nagency’s duty to take reasonable steps to ferret out requested documents.” McGehee v.

Cir. 1983). The D.C. Circuit disfavors an agency’s “reflexive application\n\nof [a] cut-off policy to every request regardless of circumstances” and has “expressly rejected the\n\nproposition that under FOIA, the ‘use of a time-of-request cut-off date is always reasonable.’”\n\nPublic Citizen v.

Nevertheless, “specific circumstances in some agencies may render an across-the-\n\n\n36\n  Although the plaintiff fails to state a claim for relief in this Court, the plaintiff’s complaint about the Work With\npolicy is best directed at Congress. The CIA’s duty to “work with” requesters, like an agency’s determination of\nwhether a request “reasonably describes” the records sought, occurs at the threshold of the FOIA request process.\nThe FOIA itself imposes a similar duty to “provide [a requester] an opportunity to limit the scope of [its] request . . .\nor an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified\nrequest.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). This latter duty, however, is not triggered if an agency has not yet received a\nrequest that “reasonably describes such records.” Hence, there is a statutory disconnect between § 552(a)(3) and\n§ 552(a)(6)(B), which leaves the plaintiff unable to challenge the CIA’s alleged policy or practice under either the\nFOIA or the APA.\n\n\n\n                                                           69\n\fboard rule reasonable,” and it is the agency’s burden to make a “showing that warrants such an\n\napproach.” See id.\n\n       In the instant actions, the CIA argues that its alleged Cut-Off Date Policy would be\n\nreasonable “because the CIA is a large agency that receives a substantial volume of FOIA\n\nrequests.” Def.’s 444 Reply at 18. This argument is unpersuasive for two reasons. First,\n\ndetermining the reasonableness of an agency’s categorical cut-off date for running FOIA\n\nsearches is particularly inappropriate at the motion to dismiss stage because the CIA has not yet\n\nsubmitted any affidavits or other proof that would support its argument that an across-the-board\n\ncut-off date is reasonable. See Public Citizen, 276 F.3d at 643–44 (to establish reasonableness of\n\nacross-the-board cut-off date, an agency must make a “showing that warrants such an approach”\n\nthat would “substantiate its claim”). Second, the agency’s reasoning has largely been rejected by\n\nthe D.C. Circuit in McGehee and Public Citizen. In fact, McGehee specifically addressed the\n\nCIA’s policy of imposing a categorical date-of-request (rather than date-of-response) cut-off\n\ndate. In that case, the CIA put forth a number of justifications similar to the one proffered in the\n\ninstant action, all of which the D.C. Circuit rejected as a basis for concluding that an across-the-\n\nboard policy was reasonable. Specifically, the CIA pointed to\n\n       the benefits of ‘precis[ion]’ (the value of having a single cut-off date that all\n       agency divisions know in advance), the ‘confusion’ that might be engendered by\n       different agency components using different cut-off dates (e.g., each division\n       using the date at which it commenced searching for its documents), the alleged\n       costs and inconvenience to the agency of conducting the successive, duplicative\n       searches that might be necessary if the date of a final response or the date of\n       litigation were employed as a cut-off date, and the disruption of the agency’s fee\n       schedules that would accompany the use of anything other than its present\n       procedure.\n\nMcGehee, 697 F.2d at 1103–04. The CIA similarly now claims that its policy is reasonable\n\nbecause, as “a large agency” that “processes a high volume of FOIA requests,” it requires the\n\n“consistency and uniformity” that result from a categorical cut-off date. Def.’s 444 Mem. at 20.\n\n\n                                                 70\n\fIt would be out of line with the precedents in this Circuit for the Court to conclude as a matter of\n\nlaw that the CIA’s policy is reasonable. See Public Citizen, 276 F.3d at 644 (“At the very least,\n\nwe think that with minimal administrative hassle, the [agency] could apply a date-of-search cut-\n\noff . . . .”). Thus, the CIA’s motion to dismiss will be denied with respect to the plaintiff’s\n\nchallenge to the CIA’s alleged Cut-Off Date Policy (Count Twenty-One of No. 11-444), and the\n\nCIA will have an opportunity to “adduce additional relevant testimony” that its policy is\n\nreasonable. See McGehee, 697 F.2d at 1104.\n\n               5.      Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy and Document-Level\n                       Exemption Policy\n\n       Next, the Court addresses the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Withheld\n\nDocument Non-Identification Policy and Document-Level Exemption Policy in Counts Eighteen\n\nand Twenty, respectively, of No. 11-445. These claims allege that, at the administrative level,\n\nthe CIA has a policy of never identifying documents withheld in their entirety and only\n\nspecifying exemptions at a document level, rather than specifying the exemption claimed for\n\neach particular redaction. See FAC ¶¶ 118–122, 128–133, NSC III.\n\n       In responding to a FOIA request, agencies are obligated to determine “whether to comply\n\nwith such request” and must notify the requester of, inter alia, the reason for the determination.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). If the agency decides to withhold any responsive records, it also\n\nmust “make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of any requested matter the provision of\n\nwhich is denied” and provide that estimate to the requester. Id. § 552(a)(6)(F). Finally, if an\n\nagency decides to release records with certain portions redacted, it must indicate on each\n\ndocument “[t]he amount of information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is\n\nmade,” and “[i]f technically feasible,” the agency must also indicate this information “at the\n\nplace in the record where such deletion is made.” Id. § 552(b). The FOIA excuses agencies\n\n\n\n                                                 71\n\ffrom having either to “estimate the volume of” withheld records or indicate “[t]he amount of\n\ninformation deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made,” when compliance\n\nwith those procedures “would harm an interest protected by the exemption” being claimed. Id.\n\n§§ 552(a)(6)(F), 552(b).\n\n       In support of its challenge to the CIA’s alleged Withheld Document Non-Identification\n\nPolicy and Document-Level Exemption Policy, the plaintiff cites a publicly available CIA\n\ntraining manual, which states, “‘at initial and at appeal stage, no listing of documents, or putting\n\nspecific exemptions next to redactions, is required.” Id. ¶ 119. The CIA believes the plaintiff’s\n\nchallenges to these two alleged policies should be dismissed because (1) at least one court has\n\nupheld the CIA’s use of “no number, no list” responses for withholding documents at the\n\nadministrative stage in certain circumstances, and (2) an agency is permitted by the FOIA to\n\n“refuse to specify the exemptions under which a deletion is made when appropriate,” i.e., “if\n\nincluding the indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption.” See Defs.’ 445\n\nMem. at 17–18.\n\n       The plaintiff, however, argues that agencies are required to identify documents that are\n\nwithheld at the administrative level, relying heavily on a nearly 35-year-old Texas district court\n\ncase called Shermco Industries, Inc. v. Secretary of U.S. Air Force, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2302087\"><a href=\"/opinion/2302087/shermco-industries-inc-v-sec-of-us-air-force/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

See Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 18–19.\n\nThe court in Shermco stated in dictum that:\n\n       It would be impossible for a requesting person to effectively appeal an agency\n       decision through the administrative process with any hope of changing the\n       agency’s mind if the person were denied access to adequate information about the\n       adverse decision. A person cannot effectively appeal a decision about the\n       releasability of documents or the charging of fees if he is not informed of at least\n       a list of the documents to which he was denied access, what fees he will be\n       charged for releasable documents, and why those decisions were made. Denial of\n       this information would in all likelihood be a violation of due process as well as\n\n\n\n                                                 72\n\f       effectively gutting the reasons for applying the exhaustion doctrine in FOIA\n       cases.\n\nShermco, 452 F. Supp. at 317 n.7 (citing U.S. CONST. amend. XIV). The plaintiff further argues\n\nthat, although agencies are not required to indicate exemptions if doing so would “harm an\n\ninterest protected by the exemption,” such actions “must be exercised on a case-by-case basis,\n\nand a blanket policy of refusing to do so presumes that all indications would harm protected\n\ninterests.” Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 19–20.\n\n       First, Count Eighteen in No. 11-445, challenging the alleged Withheld Document Non-\n\nIdentification Policy, fails to state a cognizable claim under the FOIA. Earlier this year, this\n\nCourt held that “[t]he plain text of the [FOIA] does not require agencies to provide a list of\n\nwithheld documents, but only to make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of the\n\ndocuments withheld.” Mobley v. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 124 (D.D.C. 2012).\n\nAlthough the plaintiff may be correct that the administrative process would be more meaningful\n\nif agencies were required to identify withheld documents at the administrative stage, those\n\narguments are better directed at the political branches. The Judiciary’s powers are limited to\n\nsaying what the law is, and it would be inappropriate for the Court to add a substantial\n\nprocedural requirement to the FOIA when there is no indication that Congress intended such a\n\nrequirement to exist. This result may or may not “rob the requester of his ability to intelligently\n\nappeal any decisions at the administrative level,” Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 19, but Congress elected not\n\nto grant requesters that ability. Instead, the FOIA provides requesters with the opportunity for de\n\nnovo judicial review of all withholding decisions—an ample and powerful procedural\n\nmechanism. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B); see also Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air\n\nForce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1413635\"><a href=\"/opinion/1413635/mead-data-central-inc-v-us-dept-of-air-force/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Therefore, the plaintiff’s challenge to\n\nthe alleged Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy (Count Eighteen in No. 11-445) will\n\nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n\n       Next, Count Twenty in No. 11-445, challenging the alleged Document-Level Exemption\n\nPolicy, succeeds in stating a claim for relief based on the CIA’s stated policy. The plaintiff\n\nconcedes that an agency need not indicate the exemptions under which it redacts information at\n\nall when “including the indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption.” Pl.’s 445\n\nOpp’n at 19. Rather, the plaintiff’s sole contention in its brief is that the CIA is invoking\n\nexemptions on a document level pursuant to a “blanket policy,” rather than doing so on a case-\n\nby-case basis. Id. at 19–20. Two factual allegations support this claim. First, the plaintiff claims\n\nthat “[i]n every case in which CIA has redacted information from records released in response to\n\nan NSC FOIA request . . . CIA has consistently invoked exemptions on a document-level without\n\nindicating which exemptions applied to which particular redactions.” FAC ¶ 129, NSC III.\n\nHabitually invoking exemptions for redactions on a document level, however, is not inconsistent\n\nwith doing so on a case-by-case basis. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (complaint must plead facts\n\nthat are more than “‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s liability”). Standing alone, these\n\ndecisions by the CIA—“consistent[]” as they may be—do not demonstrate a plausible claim\n\nregarding a “blanket” policy.\n\n       Second, however, the plaintiff alleges the existence of a publicly available CIA training\n\nmanual, which states that “at initial and at appeal stage,” FOIA officials at the CIA need not\n\n“put[] specific exemptions next to redactions.” FAC ¶ 119, NSC III. The CIA does not contest\n\nthat this training manual constitutes an official agency policy regarding the specification of\n\nexemptions in redacted documents, but rather it argues that “an agency may, consistent with the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 74\n\fFOIA, refuse to specify the exemptions under which a deletion is made when” including the\n\nindication “would harm an interest protected by the exemption.” Defs.’ 445 Mem. at 18. The\n\nonly statutory language cited and discussed by the defendant, however, fails to address the\n\nsubstance of the plaintiff’s allegation. The defendant cites a provision of the FOIA that requires\n\nagencies to indicate the exemption under which a deletion is made “on the released portion of the\n\nrecord.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). This provision, however, only governs an agency’s duty to indicate\n\nthe exemption for a given deletion at all, while the plaintiff more particularly challenges the\n\nCIA’s failure to specify exemptions at a redaction level, as opposed to a document level. That\n\nduty is covered by the very next sentence of the FOIA statute, which neither party has cited or\n\ndiscussed. That sentence provides: “If technically feasible, the amount of the information\n\ndeleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated at the place in\n\nthe record where such deletion is made.” Id. Presuming as true the plaintiff’s uncontested\n\nallegation that the CIA training manual represents an official CIA policy, that policy runs\n\nroughshod over this statutory language by applying a blanket presumption that exemptions need\n\nnot be specified “next to redactions.” See FAC ¶ 119, NSC III. Therefore, the plaintiff has stated\n\na claim for relief in its challenge to the CIA’s alleged Document-Level Exemption Policy (Count\n\nTwenty in No. 11-445) because a blanket policy of refusing to specify exemptions “next to\n\nredactions,” without considering the technical feasibility of doing so, would violate the CIA’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                75\n\fduties under the FOIA. 37 Thus, the defendant’s partial motion to dismiss in No. 11-445 will be\n\ndenied with respect to Count Twenty. 38\n\n                  6.       Blanket Processing Notes Exemption Policy and Blanket Reference\n                           Material Exemption Policy\n\n         The Court next considers the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Blanket\n\nProcessing Notes Exemption Policy and Blanket Reference Material Exemption Policy,\n\ncontained in Counts Four and Eleven of No. 11-445, respectively. In those claims, the plaintiff\n\nalleges that, in response to FOIA requests, the CIA improperly applies blanket exemptions to\n\n(1) “all information pertaining to [the CIA’s] processing of FOIA and Privacy Act requests” and\n\n(2) “all FOIA/[Privacy Act] reference materials.” FAC ¶¶ 35, 79, NSC III. By “blanket\n\nexemption,” the plaintiff appears to mean that, when the plaintiff requests processing notes or\n\nreference materials about particular FOIA or Privacy Act requests, the CIA “has withheld\n\neverything from the release except for correspondence with the requester.” Id. ¶ 33.\n\n         Construing the plaintiff’s allegations in the most favorable light, the plaintiff’s claim is\n\nthat this alleged policy or practice violates the FOIA because it is “blanket” in nature, i.e., that\n\nthe CIA is reflexively and categorically withholding all processing notes and reference materials\n\nwithout actually assessing the material on a record-by-record basis. See Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 14–\n\n15 (arguing that the CIA’s “blanket” policy and its “sweeping generalizations” in support of that\n\npolicy are “reminiscent of the days before Vaughn indices were required components of any\n\nFOIA litigation”). The plaintiff attempts to buttress this theory in its opposition brief by citing to\n37\n  To the extent that the plaintiff claims, however, that the CIA has failed to give case-by-case consideration to its\ndecision of whether to indicate exemptions at all in redacted documents, the plaintiff’s claim fails. The plaintiff has\nnot alleged any facts that would plausibly suggest that the CIA has a policy of refusing to indicate exemptions in\nredacted documents without case-by-case consideration of whether such indication “would harm an interest\nprotected by the exemption.”\n38\n  The plaintiff has failed to state a claim for relief in Count Twenty, however, insofar as it claims that, when the\n“CIA has withheld records in their entirety in response to an NSC FOIA request,” the CIA “has consistently invoked\nexemptions in the alternative.” FAC ¶ 128, NSC III. The FOIA does not prohibit an agency from invoking\nexemptions in the alternative when the agency withholds records from disclosure.\n\n\n\n                                                          76\n\fwhat the plaintiff claims is the “only CIA FOIA processing notes released to any requester,”\n\nwhich the plaintiff says demonstrates the “mundane” and non-exempt nature of these materials.\n\nSee id. at 15–16. The plaintiff’s claim, however, suffers from fatal defects in pleading and logic.\n\n        As discussed above in connection with County Twenty, the plaintiff’s allegations in\n\nCounts Four and Eleven fail to distinguish between consistent decisionmaking on the one hand\n\nand a lack of case-by-case consideration on the other. Although the plaintiff alleges in Count\n\nFour that, in response to twelve of thirteen FOIA requests for processing materials, the CIA\n\n“withheld everything from the release except for correspondence with the requester,” FAC ¶ 33,\n\nNSC III, the plaintiff offers no allegation to suggest that this was not the result of case-by-case\n\nconsideration. 39 Unlike in Count Twenty, the plaintiff offers no factual allegation that the CIA\n\nhas an actual policy of categorically exempting such records. The plaintiff’s logic is that,\n\nbecause the processing notes that were released are “mundane,” there must be other such\n\nreleasable material “in all the various FOIA requests for which notes have been processed for\n\nrelease.” Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 16. Yet, logic would seem to militate toward the opposite\n\nconclusion, i.e., that the “mundane” processing notes were the only such notes released precisely\n\nbecause they are the exception, rather than the rule and precisely because the CIA is considering\n\nthe release of processing notes on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, if the CIA had such a “blanket”\n\npolicy, logic would seem to suggest that these “mundane” processing notes would have been\n\nwithheld, rather than produced. Despite all of this, the plaintiff’s only explanation for why these\n\nprocessing notes were released is that they represent an “inexplicabl[e] deviat[ion] from [the\n\nCIA’s] pattern,” but such thinking begs the question. Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 15.\n\n\n39\n  The plaintiff also offers no factual allegations whatsoever to support its claim in Count Eleven. The plaintiff\nmerely offers the conclusory assertion that the CIA has made a “decision to apply a blanket exemption to all\nFOIA/[Privacy Act] reference materials,” which violates the FOIA.

This allegation is patently\ninsufficient to state a plausible claim for relief.\n\n\n\n                                                       77\n\f         Even setting aside the plaintiff’s apparent logical fallacies, however, the fact remains that\n\nthe plaintiff has failed to allege any facts that would plausibly suggest that the CIA has\n\ncategorically exempted FOIA processing notes or reference materials without case-by-case\n\nconsideration. 40 The plaintiff also has not alleged that the CIA failed to comply with the other\n\nrequired procedures of the FOIA in withholding these records, such as disclosing the estimated\n\nvolume of the records withheld and identifying which exemptions apply to the withheld\n\ndocuments. Absent allegations that would plausibly suggest an ongoing violation of the FOIA,\n\nthe plaintiff’s challenges to the Blanket Processing Notes Exemption Policy and Blanket\n\nReference Material Exemption Policy (Counts Four and Eleven in No. 11-445) will be dismissed\n\nfor failure to state a claim. 41\n\n                  7.       Glomar Response Policy\n\n         Finally, the Court will address the plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Glomar\n\nResponse Policy. “‘[A]n agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records where to\n\nanswer the FOIA inquiry would cause harm cognizable under a FOIA exception.’” Moore v.\n\nCIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"619318\"><a href=\"/opinion/619318/moore-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1333 (D.C.

In particular, the plaintiff alleged two\n\nexamples of this policy where the CIA has issued a Glomar response to FOIA requests for\n\ndocuments pertaining to particular FOIA and Mandatory Declassification Review (“MDR”)\n\nrequests, 42 despite the prior disclosure of referral memoranda from the CIA and correspondence\n\nbetween the CIA and the plaintiff regarding these requests. The plaintiff alleges that the referral\n\nmemoranda were disclosed by the National Archives and Records Administration, and the\n\nplaintiff alleges that it is in possession of the correspondence because it was the party\n\ncorresponding with the CIA. FAC ¶ 95, NSC III.\n\n        The plaintiff’s allegations challenging the CIA’s Glomar Response Policy sweep very\n\nbroadly. See FAC ¶ 96, NSC III (alleging a policy “that authorizes a Glomar response to any\n\nrequest for information pertaining to FOIA and MDR requests referred to an agency”).\n\nConstruing the plaintiff’s claim most broadly, the plaintiff is complaining that, even when other\n\nfederal agencies acknowledge the existence of responsive CIA records by referring FOIA\n\nrequests to the CIA, the CIA has a policy of nevertheless issuing Glomar responses post-referral.\n\nIn other words, Agency A says that Agency B has records responsive to a FOIA request, but\n\nAgency B says it can neither confirm nor deny that it has any such records. If this is what the\n\n\n42\n  An MDR request is a request from a member of the public to have a document or documents declassified so that\nthey can be released to the public. See generally Exec. Order 13,526, 75 Fed. Reg. 707 (Dec. 29, 2009).\n\n\n\n                                                      79\n\fplaintiff claims, however, that claim fails as a matter of well-established FOIA law. The D.C.\n\nCircuit has consistently held that, for purposes of a Glomar response, it “do[es] not deem\n\n‘official’ a disclosure made by someone other than the agency from which the information is\n\nbeing sought.” Frugone v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184811\"><a href=\"/opinion/184811/frugone-eduardo-j-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 774 (D.C.

DEA,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1082 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (“[A]n agency does not waive its right to invoke an\n\notherwise valid FOIA exemption when ‘someone other than the agency from which the\n\ninformation is being sought’ discloses it.” (quoting Frugone, 169 F.3d at 774)); Moore, 666 F.3d\n\nat 1333 n.4 (“[T]o the extent [appellant] suggests that the release of the [record] by the FBI\n\nconstitutes an official acknowledgement by the CIA, his argument is foreclosed by our\n\nprecedent.” (citing Frugone, 169 F.3d at 774–75)).\n\n       The plaintiff’s claim could, however, also be construed more narrowly. Under a\n\nnarrower construction, which is supported by the context provided in the plaintiff’s briefing, the\n\nplaintiff claims that when certain records associated with a FOIA request are publicly released\n\n(e.g., referral memoranda or correspondence with the requester), the responding agency is then\n\nforeclosed from issuing a Glomar response as to other records associated with that same request\n\n(e.g., processing notes). Indeed, the plaintiff argues, with a hint of exasperation, that “[i]t is\n\nnonsensical to propose that CIA can write an official letter to a requester acknowledging a\n\nreferred request (or even releasing material), but that if the same requester files a FOIA request\n\nfor CIA’s processing notes regarding the very same referred request, he will be issued a Glomar\n\nresponse.” Pl.’s 445 Opp’n at 18. Although the plaintiff may find it “nonsensical,” the D.C.\n\nCircuit has clearly held that courts must apply the “official acknowledgement” exception\n\n“strictly,” such that the “official acknowledgement” only extends to the specific records that are\n\nacknowledged by the agency. See Moore, 666 F.3d at 1333; Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378–79; see also\n\n\n\n\n                                                  80\n\fWilner v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1356581\"><a href=\"/opinion/1356581/wilner-v-national-sec-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 70 (2d Cir. 2009) (agency is “precluded from making a\n\nGlomar response if the existence or nonexistence of the specific records sought by the FOIA\n\nrequest has been the subject of an official public acknowledgement” (emphasis added)). Indeed,\n\nthis Circuit requires that a plaintiff “pinpoint an agency record that both matches the plaintiff’s\n\nrequest and has been publicly and officially acknowledged by the agency.” Moore, 666 F.3d at\n\n1333 (emphasis added). Thus, even assuming arguendo that the disclosure of the CIA’s referral\n\nmemoranda and correspondence regarding certain referred requests would qualify as “official\n\nacknowledgements,” that still would not make it improper for the CIA to refuse to confirm or\n\ndeny the existence of processing notes from those very same requests because the processing\n\nnotes are separate documents from the referral memoranda and correspondence. The fact that\n\nthey are separate documents makes all the difference under Moore and Wolf.\n\n       The plaintiff does not claim that the CIA has issued Glomar responses with respect to\n\nparticular documents that have been officially acknowledged by the CIA. Rather, the plaintiff’s\n\ntheory appears to be that, once an agency acknowledges that a particular request was made, such\n\na statement waives the agency’s ability to issue a Glomar response with regard to any documents\n\nassociated with that request. As logical as this may seem to the plaintiff, it is simply not the law.\n\nSee Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (holding that the official acknowledgement doctrine imposes an\n\n“insistence on exactitude” under which “the specific information sought by the plaintiff must\n\nalready be in the public domain by official disclosure”); see also Students Against Genocide\n\n(SAGE) v.

CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons discussed above, in summary, the Court rules on the CIA’s partial\n\nmotions to dismiss the plaintiff’s policy-or-practice claims as follows:\n\n           1. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Assignment of Rights Policy may\n              go forward because the plaintiff has standing to pursue it.\n\n           2. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Aggregate Data Policy under the\n              FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act are all dismissed.\n\n           3. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Administrative Appeals Policy\n              under the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act are all dismissed.\n\n           4. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Reasonably Describe Policy under\n              the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act are all dismissed.\n\n           5. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Work With Policy under the FOIA,\n              the APA, and the Mandamus Act are all dismissed.\n\n           6. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Cut-Off Date Policy under the\n              FOIA may go forward because it succeeds in stating a claim for relief.\n\n           7. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Blanket Processing Notes\n              Exemption Policy under the FOIA is dismissed.\n\n           8. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Blanket Reference Material\n              Exemption Policy under the FOIA is dismissed.\n\n           9. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Glomar Response Policy under the\n              FOIA is dismissed.\n\n           10. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Non-Provision of Completion Date\n               Policy under the FOIA, the APA, and the Mandamus Act are all dismissed.\n\n           11. The plaintiff’s challenges to the CIA’s alleged Withheld Document Non-\n               Identification Policy under the FOIA and the APA are both dismissed.\n\n           12. The plaintiff’s challenge to the CIA’s alleged Document-Level Exemption Policy\n               under the FOIA may go forward because it succeeds in stating claim, but the\n               identical challenge under the APA is dismissed.\n\n\n\n                                                82\n\f       With respect to the specific Counts in the three complaints, the CIA’s motion to dismiss\n\nCounts One and Two of No. 11-443—related to the CIA’s Assignment of Rights Policy—is\n\ndenied. Additionally, the CIA’s partial motion to dismiss in No. 11-444 is denied with respect to\n\nthe plaintiff’s FOIA challenge to the CIA’s alleged Cut-Off Date Policy (Count Twenty-One)\n\nand is granted with respect to all APA claims (Counts Three, Six, Twelve, and Fifteen), all\n\nMandamus Act Claims (Counts Four, Seven, Thirteen, and Sixteen), and all remaining\n\nchallenges to the Aggregate Data Policy (Count Two), Administrative Appeals Policy (Count\n\nFive), Reasonably Describe Policy (Count Eleven), and Work With Policy (Count Fourteen).\n\nFinally, the CIA’s partial motion to dismiss in No. 11-445 is denied with respect to the FOIA\n\nchallenge to the CIA’s alleged Document-Level Exemption Policy (Count Twenty) and is\n\ngranted with respect to all APA claims (Counts Sixteen, Nineteen, and Twenty-One), the\n\nMandamus Act Claim (Count Seventeen) and all remaining challenges to the Blanket Processing\n\nNotes Exemption Policy (Count Four), Blanket Reference Material Exemption Policy (Count\n\nEleven), Glomar Response Policy (Count Fourteen), Non-Provision of Completion Date Policy\n\n(Count Fifteen), and Withheld Document Non-Identification Policy (Count Eighteen).\n\n       An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n       Date: October 17, 2012\n\n                                                     /s/ Beryl A.
