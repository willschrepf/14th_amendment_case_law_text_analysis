Plaintiffs complain of\n\nthe district court’s ruling that gas royalties were not underpaid\n\nin the years 1985 and 1986.     Plaintiffs also complain of the denial\n\nof prejudgment interest with respect to the 1979-1982 underpayment.\n\nWe   decline   to   consider   the    prejudgment     interest     matter,     and\n\notherwise reject all the mentioned challenges to the district\n\ncourt’s rulings.\n\n                      Facts and Proceedings Below\n\n      The   subject   matter   of    this   lawsuit    is   royalty   from     gas\n\nproduced in Rankin County, Mississippi.           The gas from the Rankin\n\nCounty fields is “sour,” that is, it contains more than trace\n\namounts of hydrogen sulfide and other contaminants.                 Before this\n\ngas can be sold on the market, it must be transported to an\n\nappropriate facility and processed into “sweet” gas. Shell, lessee\n\nin oil and gas leases in which plaintiffs are (or hold under) the\n\nlessors, treats the sour gas itself on site at its Thomasville\n\nplant in Rankin County, recovering from the original sour gas both\n\n\n\nunder the limited circumstances set forth in Local Rule 47.5.4.\n\n                                       2\n\fsweet gas (dry methane) and elemental sulfur.\n\n     In 1970 Shell began efforts to market the gas produced from\n\nthese fields.     It sought buyers only in the intrastate market\n\nbecause it wished to avoid restrictive federal regulations on\n\ninterstate sales.     In 1972 Shell entered into a fifteen-year\n\ncontract to sell the bulk of its production, 40,000 Mcf per day, to\n\nMisCoa.1   Shell also entered into a similar long-term contract\n\narrangement with Mississippi Power & Light (MP&L), which agreed to\n\ntake the excess volume produced by Shell’s Thomasville facility.\n\nAlthough these contracts were the best available at the time,\n\nsubsequent developments in the international fuels market quickly\n\nresulted in the fixed rates specified in those contracts being far\n\nbelow sweet gas prices available on the open market.\n\nPiney Woods I\n\n     On December 27, 1974, landowners in Rankin County filed this\n\nlawsuit against Shell, their mineral lessee, over royalty allegedly\n\ndue them from natural gas produced under these leases and processed\n\nat Shell’s Thomasville plant. The lawsuit was certified as a class\n\naction in 1978.    The plaintiffs claimed that Shell’s practice of\n\ncomputing royalty from the long-term fixed rate contract proceeds\n\nwas, given the post-1972 gas price inflation, in derogation of\n\ntheir contractual right to be paid “the market value” of the gas\n\n\n1\n     An Mcf is 1000 cubic feet. MisCoa is a partnership of two\nMississippi corporations, Mississippi Chemical Corporation and\nCoastal Chemical Corporation.\n\n                                 3\n\f“at the well.”     In 1982 the district court held a bench trial and\n\nfound for Shell on almost all claims.         Piney Woods Country Life\n\nSchool v. Shell Oil Co., 539 F.Supp. 957 (S.D.Miss. 1982) (Piney\n\nWoods I).\n\nPiney Woods II\n\n     That decision was certified for interlocutory appeal under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. Rule 54(b) to this Court, which, after an extensive\n\ndiscussion of the leases at issue, concluded by affirming in part,\n\nreversing in part, and remanding the case back to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings.     Piney Woods Country Life School v.\n\nShell Oil Co., 726 F.2d 225 (5th Cir. 1984) (Piney Woods II), cert.\n\ndenied, 105 S.Ct. 1868 (1985).      The Piney Woods II panel made a\n\nnumber of determinations which inform the issues presently before\n\nthis Court.\n\n     First,   we    concluded   that,   for   purposes   of   leases that\n\ndistinguished between gas “sold at the well,” for which royalty was\n\nbased on “the amount realized from sale,” and other gas sold, for\n\nwhich the royalty was based on “market value at the well,” the gas\n\nin question was not “sold at the well,” and hence its royalty was\n\nto be based on “market value at the well.”         Piney Woods II, 726\n\nF.2d at 230-233.    We thus rejected Shell’s contention that the gas\n\nat issue from these leases was “sold at the well” so that its\n\nroyalty would be based on “the amount realized from sale” rather\n\n\n\n\n                                   4\n\fthan “market value at the well.”2       Second, this Court held that the\n\nlease term “market value” means “current market value at the time\n\nof production,” not, as Shell had argued, at the time it entered\n\ninto the MisCoa contract.    Piney Woods II, 726 F.2d at 238.    Third,\n\nthis Court found that because the pertinent leases provided for the\n\n“market value at the well,” the lessors were only “entitled to\n\nroyalty based on the value or price of unprocessed, untransported\n\n[i.e., sour,] gas.”   Id. at 240.       Fourth, we recognized that while\n\n“the best means of determining the market value at the well ...\n\nwould be to examine comparable sales of sour gas at other wells in\n\nthe area,” in the absence of such evidence “[t]he next-best method\n\nis to examine sales of sweet gas and sulfur, to determine the\n\nmarket value of the products resulting from processing at the\n\nThomasville plant.    Processing costs may then be deducted as an\n\nindirect means of determining what a buyer would have paid for sour\n\ngas at the wellhead.”       Id.   If the plaintiffs were unable to\n\nproffer sufficiently comparable sales of sweet gas to demonstrate\n\nsuch a market value, a third means of showing market value, Shell’s\n\nsystem based upon the amount actually realized from the sale of\n\n\n\n2\n     This holding applied to the great majority of the leases then\nat issue, and to all the leases now remaining in dispute. However,\nat the time of Piney Woods II, there was also at issue gas from at\nleast one lease (a “Producers 88 (9/70)” form) which provided that\nthe royalty on all gas sold by lease (not just that “sold at the\nwell”) was to be based on the “amount realized by lessee, computed\nat the mouth of the well.” Id. at 230 & n.6. See also id. at 240-\n41.\n\n                                    5\n\fThomasville gas-less-processing costs, could be utilized, although\n\nthis was the “least desirable method of determining market value.”\n\nId. at 239 (citation omitted).\n\n       Finally, we held that Shell could, as had been its practice,\n\ndeduct processing costs in computing royalty, because, although the\n\nroyalties were to be based on market value at the well, there were\n\napparently no comparable sales of sour gas, and thus “[p]rocessing\n\ncosts may then be deducted as an indirect means of determining what\n\na buyer would have paid for the sour gas at the wellhead.”         Id. at\n\n240.    “The function of processing costs in determining royalties\n\nbased on ‘market value at the well’ is to adjust for imperfect\n\ncomparisons.”       Id.    “The [market] value . . . of the [plant]\n\nresidue sweet gas reflects Shell’s processing costs. . . .”        Id. at\n\n241.    “To determine the correct basis for royalty, processing . .\n\n. costs may be deducted from values . . . established for processed\n\n. . . gas.”   Id. at 242.    However, only reasonable processing costs\n\ncould be so deducted.        Id. at 241.      We noted that although the\n\ndistrict    court    had    not   made   an   express   finding   on   the\n\nreasonableness of the processing costs deducted by Shell, “[t]he\n\nrecord would support a finding of reasonability”; and we left that\n\nissue “open for further consideration by the district court.”          Id.3\n\n\n3\n     With respect to gas from the lease (or the few leases) on the\n“Producers 88 (9/70)” form which provided that on all gas sold by\nlessee (not just that “sold at the well”) the royalty was based on\nthe “amount realized by lessee, computed at the mouth of the well”\n(see note 2, supra), we likewise held that Shell could deduct\n\n                                     6\n\fPiney Woods III\n\n      After remand the district court held another evidentiary\n\nhearing. The plaintiffs renewed their attempts to produce evidence\n\nof comparable sales of processed sweet gas from which a derivative\n\nmarket value for Thomasville processed gas could be established.4\n\nThe evidence adduced showed that the Shell-MP&L “excess volume”\n\ncontract had been terminated in 1981 and that in 1982 the Shell-\n\nMisCoa   contract   had   been    modified,     reducing    Shell’s   MisCoa\n\nobligation to 21,000 Mcf per day.        This in turn had freed up gas\n\nfor   the   newly   deregulated    interstate     market,    which    Shell’s\n\nThomasville facility entered by means of a new “excess volume”\n\ncontract with Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) in November\n\n1982.    During this entire period, Shell continued to compute its\n\nroyalty payments based upon the net proceeds obtained from these\n\n\n\nprocessing costs, because such a deduction was necessary to\ndetermine that portion of the price actually received for processed\ngas at the plant tailgate which was allocable to, and represented\nthe price received for, the unprocessed gas at the mouth of the\nwell. “The . . . sale price of the residue sweet gas reflects\nShell’s processing costs.” Id. at 241. Again, only reasonable\ncosts could be so deducted. Id.\n4\n     During this second hearing, Shell offered evidence of an\nalternative means of determining market value. Shell’s model was\npurportedly based upon the viewpoint of a willing buyer of the\nRankin County sour gas and consisted of evidence, culled from its\nworldwide drilling and processing operations, showing what it would\ncost to build a facility to process that gas into marketable sweet\ngas. Shell’s model involved not only the price tag for capital\nexpended in the construction and operation of the phantom plant(s),\nbut also introduced variables to account for inflation and the\nhypothetical willing buyer’s assumption of investment risk and\nprofit motive.\n\n                                     7\n\fcontracts, i.e., actual sales less processing costs.\n\n     In 1989 the district court rendered a judgment on the merits,\n\nfinding that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that the market\n\nrate for Thomasville processed gas was at any time greater than\n\nShell’s long-term contract rate.5        Piney Woods Country Life School\n\nv. Shell Oil Co., No. J74-0307 (W) (S.D. Miss., April 24, 1989)\n\n(Piney Woods III). Although the plaintiffs’ evidence of assertedly\n\ncomparable   sweet   gas   sales   for   the   years   1979-1986   was   not\n\nsubjected to nearly the same scrutiny by the district court as was\n\ntheir related evidence bearing on the market in 1972-1978, the\n\ndistrict court as to the years 1979-1986 relied in part upon\n\nfederal regulatory ceilings to support its ultimate view that\n\nShell’s accounting and payment practice was consonant with the\n\n“market value at the well” lease royalty provisions during that\n\nperiod.\n\nPiney Woods IV\n\n     The plaintiffs pursued a direct appeal from this judgment,\n\nbringing the case before this Court for a second time.        Piney Woods\n\nCountry Life School v. Shell Oil Co., 905 F.2d 840 (5th Cir. 1990)\n\n(Piney Woods IV).     In Piney Woods IV, this Court discussed the\n\n“deregulation” which had made Shell’s entry into the interstate gas\n\n\n5\n     The district court also rejected Shell’s alternative market\nvalue model, finding it “rooted in too much pecuniary speculation\nand hypothetical supposition.” Piney Woods III, unpub. op. at p.\n9.\n\n                                    8\n\fmarket by way of the Transco contract feasible.          The Natural Gas\n\nPolicy   Act   (NGPA),   which   took   effect   on   November   9,   1978,\n\nsegregated gas wells, including those in Rankin County, into two\n\ndistinct regulatory regimes.6     15 U.S.C. § 3315 (section 105 of the\n\nNGPA) provided that the maximum lawful price which could be charged\n\nfor gas produced at wells within its demesne was “the price under\n\nthe terms of the existing contract, to which such natural gas was\n\nsubject on November 9, 1978.”     Accordingly, this Court found that,\n\nafter section 105 became law in 1978, for gas produced from Rankin\n\nsection 105 wells “the actual price Shell was receiving became the\n\nmaximum lawful price that it could receive.”          Piney Woods IV, 905\n\nF.2d at 851.\n\n     A different result, however, obtained for those wells falling\n\nunder 15 U.S.C. § 3317 (section 107 of the NGPA).         Under the NGPA,\n\ngas from section 107 wells could be sold on the interstate market\n\nat the going “market value.”7      Section 107 gas, unlike that from\n\nsection 105 wells, was thus not legally locked into a maximum price\n\ndetermination based upon Shell’s pre-existing contract, but rather\n\n\n\n6\n     The distinction between these two regimes was based upon\nspecified physical characteristics. The only one that is relevant\nin this case is drilling depth; those wells over 15,000 feet deep\nwere treated under section 107, rather than section 105, of the\nNGPA.\n7\n     The statute provides that section 107 gas may be sold on the\ninterstate market at the adjusted price calculated from the complex\nformula set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 3312 (section 102), establishing\na ceiling for the “interstate market value” at issue in this case.\n\n                                    9\n\fwas technically eligible for the higher prices available in the\n\ninterstate marketplace.\n\n      As noted, the district court in Piney Woods III had found that\n\nthe plaintiffs’ proof of market value for processed Thomasville gas\n\nfailed as a matter of fact for the years 1972-1986.             This Court in\n\nPiney Woods IV affirmed that finding as to the years prior to the\n\nNGPA’s enactment (1972-1978), holding that the district court did\n\nnot clearly err in concluding that the plaintiffs’ evidence of\n\ncomparable sweet gas sales did not show sufficient similarity to\n\nthe Thomasville processed gas sales.          We noted that many of the\n\ncomparable sales relied on did not reflect relevant nonprice\n\ninformation, such as whether contract terms included variable take\n\nor assured take provisions, the length of any commitment, the\n\nvolumes and quality of the gas, and whether the sale was interstate\n\nor   intrastate.     Other   sales   relied   on   were   of    questionable\n\ncomparability because they either involved casinghead gas (with BTU\n\nvalues   of   an   unspecified   level    higher   than   the    Thomasville\n\nprocessed gas), or involved smaller quantities or were for very\n\nshort terms “which may have reflected one buyer’s particular urgent\n\nneeds.” Id. at 848. Additionally, we observed that “[e]ven though\n\nthe buyer of the Thomasville gas would be buying sweet gas (as\n\nShell did process the Thomasville gas), the delivery of that gas\n\nstill would be uncertain, as all the problems that can occur with\n\nthe ultrasour gas would directly affect the downstream delivery of\n\n\n                                     10\n\fthe sweet gas.”   Id. at 848.   Hence, “it was not clear error for\n\nthe district court to find that what was paid for other sweet gas\n\nin smaller amounts . . . was not an accurate reflection of what the\n\nmarket value of gas from the Thomasville plant would have been,”\n\nand “the district court was within its discretion to find that the\n\nrisk inherent in guaranteeing to take large quantities of sweet gas\n\nprocessed from ultrasour gas could not be decoupled from the value\n\nof a contract for that sweet gas.”   Id.8\n\n     This Court, however, vacated the district court’s judgment as\n\nto the gas produced by section 107 wells after November 1978, and\n\nas to all wells after January 1, 1985.       We observed that the\n\ndistrict court did not give “the same intensity of examination” to\n\nplaintiffs’ allegedly comparable sweet gas sales for the 1979-1986\n\nperiod as it had for the 1972-1978 period, and further that “as the\n\nnation’s and Mississippi’s gas prices were far higher during 1979-\n\n1982 than in the earlier years, the disparities in comparable\n\nmarkets may not be of sufficient moment during the latter period to\n\nexplain the discrepancy between prices received by Shell for\n\nThomasville gas and prices received in other Mississippi sales.”\n\nHowever, we noted that the district court had also “relied upon\n\nregulatory price ceilings as an additional ground to support its\n\n\n8\n     In Piney Woods IV, we also observed that the district court\n(in Piney Woods III) “found that Shell’s ‘plant processing’ charges\nwere reasonable,” Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 843, and we did not\ndisturb that finding.\n\n\n                                11\n\ffinding . . . for the years after 1978.”        Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d\n\nat 850-51.    We then turned to a consideration of the effect of the\n\nprice ceilings during the years after 1978.\n\n       Rejecting the district court’s contrary ruling, this Court\n\nfound that evidence of record, in particular plaintiff’s exhibit P-\n\n155,   a   well-by-well,   month-by-month    listing   of   Shell’s   sales\n\nproceeds, enabled the district court to differentiate between the\n\norigins of section 105 and section 107 gas and thus determine which\n\nlandowners were possibly entitled to damages.            In addition, we\n\ndetermined that particular aspects of the Shell-Transco contract\n\ntriggered section 105(b)(3) of the NGPA and placed the section 105\n\ngas being sold to Transco under the same pricing scheme as section\n\n107 gas as of January 1, 1985.\n\n       Based upon these findings, the Piney Woods IV Court remanded\n\nthe case for a determination of whether Shell owed the owners of\n\nproperty with    section 107    wells9   damages   for   underpayment    of\n\nroyalties in the years 1979-1986.10         We also instructed that the\n\nsame inquiry be made for the owners of section 105 wells in the\n\nyears 1985-1986.    In so doing we observed that “if Shell received\n\nfrom its sales to Transco after December 31, 1984, less than the\n\n\n\n9\n     These were specified as the Garrett, Spengler, Clark, Edge,\nand Stevens wells. Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 853.\n10\n     Although we characterize the affected period as commencing in\n1979, we recognize that the last two months of 1978 are included\nwithin the relevant time frame.\n\n                                   12\n\fmarket value of the gas sold . . . the royalty owners are entitled\n\nto damages compensating them for not receiving their proper share\n\nof the true market value” and that “[d]amages will be due to the\n\nroyalty owners should the district court find on remand that the\n\nmarket value of the gas, limited by the applicable regulatory price\n\nceiling, was greater than the actual proceeds received by Shell for\n\nthe gas.”   Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 853-54.11\n\nPiney Woods V\n\n     Following remand, the district court, without holding any\n\nfurther evidentiary hearing, reconsidered the evidence of record\n\nand prepared a memorandum opinion and order addressing the merits\n\nof the plaintiffs’ claims.     The court released a draft of this\n\nopinion to the parties in December 1994.       Both parties filed\n\nobjections, and the district court heard oral argument on these\n\nobjections in February 1995.   The opinion and order were filed by\n\nthe district court, with the inclusion of a section rebutting the\n\nparties’ objections, on June 6, 1995.     Piney Woods Country Life\n\nSchool v. Shell Oil Co., No. 3:74-cv-307WS (S.D. Miss., June 6,\n\n1995) (Piney Woods V).\n\n\n\n11\n     In Piney Woods IV, we also held that, although royalty was\npayable on gas used as plant fuel, Shell owed nothing in this\nrespect notwithstanding Shell’s having simply ignored this item in\ntheir cost accounting, “because the plant fuel materially enhances\nthe value of the gas (giving the royalty owners more than the at-\nthe-well value for which they bargained), the cost of plant fuel\nmust be borne by the royalty owners in proportion to their royalty\nshare.” Id. at 857.\n\n                                 13\n\f     In Piney Woods V, the district court found that for section\n\n107 wells after 1978 and for all wells after 1984 “the market value\n\nfor deregulated Thomasville residue was the interstate market\n\nprice,   notwithstanding   that     it    continued   to   be   sold    in    the\n\nintrastate market pursuant to Shell’s long-term contract.”                   Piney\n\nWoods V, unpub. op. at 21.        The district court made findings of\n\nfact as to which wells qualified for section 105 and section 107\n\nstatus   at   particular   times,    the    amounts    available       for    the\n\ninterstate market, and the value on that market, which the court\n\ndetermined by looking at comparable sales of record.\n\n     To determine Shell’s liability for the years 1979-1986, the\n\ndistrict court took the prevailing interstate market price for\n\nsweet gas and compared it to Shell’s actual sales over those years.\n\nBased upon this analysis, the district court found Shell liable for\n\nunderpayment of royalties during a period spanning November 1978,\n\nwhen the section 107 wells were “deregulated,” until November 1982,\n\nwhen Shell entered into its “excess volume” contract with Transco\n\nand sold all of its section 107 gas on the interstate market.                 The\n\nroyalties owed were to those owners of        section 107 wells producing\n\nduring this time period, with care taken after November 1982 not to\n\ninclude any amount sold at market price to Transco.             The district\n\ncourt concluded that Shell had no liability for the period 1983\n\n(December 1992)-1984 because during this time all section 107 well\n\nproduction was sold at the prevailing interstate market rate to\n\n\n                                     14\n\fTransco.      The district court also found that, due to record\n\nevidence indicating that a downturn in the interstate market after\n\n1982 left no prospective buyers in that market willing to contract\n\nfor Thomasville gas, the royalty owners were not entitled to any\n\ndamages for the years 1985-1986.12        Based upon these findings, the\n\ndistrict court ordered the parties to re-calculate damages.\n\n     In his rebuttal to the parties’ objections, the district court\n\nrejected Shell’s contention that the opinion’s approach to valuing\n\nthe Thomasville gas was invalid because it did not properly focus\n\non the value of the gas “at the wellhead,” i.e., as sour gas.          The\n\ndistrict court noted that Shell itself had used the value of sweet\n\ngas under its long-term contract to compute royalties, that prior\n\nopinions of this Court blessed the sweet gas market value less\n\nprocessing costs analysis utilized,           and that “many years of\n\nlitigation have never once revealed what the market value of sour\n\ngas at the well might be.”      Piney Woods V, unpub. op. at 33.     Shell\n\nalso objected to the district court’s finding that an interstate\n\nmarket was available during the years 1979-1982, an assertion which\n\nthe district court found belied by the fact that all of the\n\nThomasville plant’s section 107 production, freed from commitment\n\nto long-term contractual obligations in 1982, was sold on that\n\nmarket   to   Transco   in   1983-1984.     Addressing   the   plaintiffs’\n\n\n\n12\n     The district court observed that the interstate market price\nfell steadily during this period.\n\n                                    15\n\fobjections to the finding of no underpayment in the years 1985-\n\n1986, the district court found the plaintiffs’ assertion that\n\nTransco would have been willing to buy up all of the MisCoa\n\ncontract gas had it been available “speculative” at best and\n\ntherefore insufficient to meet their burden of proving market\n\nvalue.\n\n\n\nPresent appeals taken\n\n     On September 28, 1995, the district court filed an order\n\nexpressly granting plaintiffs’ motion for partial final judgment in\n\naccordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), denying\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for prejudgment interest, and denying Shell’s\n\nmotion for reconsideration of the “wellhead value” issue.       On\n\nSeptember 29, 1995, the district court entered a “Rule 54(b)\n\njudgment” to reflect the disposition of the June 6 order.       On\n\nOctober 3, 1995, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from this\n\n“Rule 54(b)” judgment, docketed in this Court under cause No. 95-\n\n60632. Shell also filed a notice of appeal and cross-appeal which,\n\nlike the plaintiffs’ appeal, was also docketed under No. 95-60632.\n\n     On December 18, 1995, the district court, on consideration of\n\na motion filed by Shell in the district court and plaintiff’s\n\nresponse thereto, signed and filed an order certifying the June 6\n\nand September 28 orders for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1292(b); that order was entered on the docket December 19,\n\n\n\n                                16\n\f1995.   On December 20, 1995, the plaintiffs filed a notice of\n\nappeal referencing the orders of June 6, September 28, and December\n\n18 (and attaching a copy of the latter).       The plaintiffs’ appeal\n\nwas docketed in this Court as cause No. 95-60813.     On December 28,\n\n1995, Shell filed with this Court a petition for permission to\n\npursue an interlocutory appeal from the June 6 order under section\n\n1292(b), which was docketed as our cause No. 95-00282.       To this\n\npoint, we have neither granted nor denied leave to appeal under\n\nsection 1292(b).   On January 16, 1996, Shell also filed a notice of\n\nappeal and cross-appeal in response to the December 18 order. This\n\ncross-appeal was docketed, like the plaintiffs’ appeal, under our\n\nNo. 95-60813.\n\n     On February 8, 1996, this Court consolidated cause Nos. 95-\n\n00282 and 95-60632.    On April 26, 1996, this Court consolidated\n\ncause Nos. 95-60632 (consolidated) and 95-60813 for purposes of\n\noral argument and final disposition.       Both parties have opted to\n\nsubmit one brief as to all consolidated appeals.\n\n                              Discussion\n\nI.   Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n     So far as the district court held plaintiffs were entitled to\n\nrecovery for the years 1979 through 1982, its ruling does not\n\ndispose of the entirety of plaintiffs’ claim——even assuming those\n\nyears can be treated as a separate claim——because it does not award\n\ndamages, and hence is not appealable under Rule 54(b).         United\n\n\n\n                                  17\n\fStates v. Menendez, 48 F.3d 1401 (5th Cir. 1995); Pemberton v.\n\nState Farm Mutual, 996 F.2d 789 (5th Cir. 1993); Goodman v. Lee,\n\n988 F.2d 619 (5th Cir. 1993).13   However, the district court by its\n\nDecember 18, 1995, order, certified its June 6, 1995, order for\n\ninterlocutory appeal under section 1292(b), and on December 28,\n\n1995, Shell filed in this Court its Fed. R. App. P. 5 petition for\n\npermission to appeal the June 6, 1995, order.    We now grant Shell\n\nleave to appeal that order.\n\n     The situation as to the plaintiffs is somewhat different.\n\nArguably the June 6, 1995, order was certifiable and certified\n\nunder Rule 54(b) so far as it denied plaintiffs any recovery for\n\nyears after 1982.14   Two questions present themselves, however.\n\n\n13\n     In its June 6, 1995, order, the district court, although\nmaking findings regarding the interstate market price and Shell’s\nresultant liability, made no apportionment of gas quantities\nbetween particular section 107 and section 105 wells and also\nfailed to specify the quantities of section 107 gas redirected to\nTransco’s pipeline at market rates in the latter part of 1982.\nAccordingly, and due to the complex nature of the case and the\nongoing factual disputes and discrepancies concerning royalties\nowed and the ownership interests involved, the anticipated\ndetermination of the amount of damages cannot possibly be\ncharacterized as merely “ministerial.”\n14\n     And, if this is so, then plaintiffs’ October 1995 notice of\nappeal properly brings before us the district court’s denial of\nrecovery for years after 1982.\n     Plaintiffs’ October 1995 notice of appeal does not, however,\nbring forward the denial, by the district court’s September 28,\n1995, order, of plaintiffs’ claims for prejudgment interest as to\nthe years 1979-1982, because, as explained in the text above, no\ndistrict court order has been entered disposing of the entirety of\nany of plaintiffs’ claims respecting any of those years in that the\nright to recovery has been established but not the amount of\ndamages. As we ultimately affirm the district court’s holding that\n\n                                  18\n\fFirst, it is not entirely clear that the years after 1982 represent\n\nan entire claim (or claims), as opposed to being merely part of a\n\nsingle claim for royalty for the entire period after November 1978.\n\nIf the latter, Rule 54(b) certification is not available.    We are\n\ninclined to view the years after 1982 as presenting a separate\n\nclaim, not as being merely part of a larger, single indivisible\n\nclaim.   Second, the district court’s actual Rule 54(b) judgment of\n\nSeptember 29, 1995, states that the court “hereby enters judgment\n\nin favor of the plaintiffs pursuant to” the June 6, 1995, opinion.\n\nArguably, the district court meant to certify under Rule 54(b) only\n\nthe grant of relief for the years 1979-1982, not its denial for the\n\nyears after 1982.     We reject this contention.      We read the\n\nSeptember 29, 1995, order as certifying the June 6, 1995, order,\n\njust as if it had read “enters judgment in favor of the plaintiffs\n\nto the extent, but only to the extent, provided in the June 6,\n\n1995, order.”   To read the September 29 order as certifying under\n\nRule 54(b) only the granting of relief (without fixing damages) for\n\n1979-1982, but not the denial of relief for years after 1982, would\n\nbe to read the order as intending to certify under Rule 54(b) only\n\nthat which could not be so certified without intending to certify\n\nthat which could be certified.   Moreover, the September 29 order,\n\nas well as that of September 28, reflects that the court    granted\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for certification under Rule 54(b).     Although\n\n\nplaintiffs are entitled to no recovery for years after 1982, the\nquestion of prejudgment interest as to those years does not arise.\n\n                                 19\n\fthat motion is not in the record, we assume it was to certify the\n\nonly thing plaintiffs would have standing to appeal, namely the\n\ndenial of relief.      Accordingly, we have jurisdiction under Rule\n\n54(b) of plaintiffs’ challenge to the district court’s denial of\n\nrelief for the years following 1982.\n\n     The same jurisdictional result can perhaps also be justified\n\nunder section 1292(b).         See Demelo v. Woolsey Marine Industries,\n\nInc., 672 F.2d 1030 (5th Cir. 1982).            Plaintiffs argue, and Shell\n\nagrees, that we can review the entire June 6, 1995, order as it is\n\nall before us by virtue of Shell’s December 28, 1995, petition for\n\npermission to appeal under Fed. R. App. P. 5 and the doctrine that\n\nunder section 1292(b) “appellate jurisdiction applies to the order\n\ncertified   to   the   court    of   appeals,    and   is   not   tied    to   the\n\nparticular question formulated by the district court.”                     Yamaha\n\nMotor Corp. USA v. Calhoun, 116 S.Ct. 619, 622 (1996).                   See also\n\nDucre v. Executive Officers of Halter Marine, Inc., 752 F.2d 976,\n\n983 n.16 (5th Cir. 1985).15          This principle has been applied to\n\n15\n     Plaintiffs also argue (but Shell disputes) that this same\nprinciple brings up the September 28, 1995, order denying their\nclaim for prejudgment interest, because that order, as well as the\norder of June 6, 1995, was certified under section 1292(b) by the\ndistrict court’s December 18, 1995, order. We disagree because\nShell’s December 28 petition for permission to appeal sought to\nappeal only the June 6 order. A section 1292(b) appeal does not\nextend to any orders other than that which is both properly\ncertified and as to which a timely petition for permission to\nappeal is filed. See United States v. Stanley, 107 S.Ct. 3054,\n3060 (1987); Adkinson v. International Harvester Co., 975 F.2d 208,\n211 n.4 (5th Cir. 1992); FDIC v. Dye, 642 F.2d 833, 837 & n.6 (5th\nCir. 1981).\n\n                                      20\n\fallow a party who did not seek permission to appeal to defend the\n\norder certified under section 1292(b) on a basis other than the\n\ncontrolling issue specified in the district court’s certification\n\norder, just as an appellee in an ordinary appeal under 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1291 may, without taking a cross-appeal, defend the judgment below\n\non a ground not relied on by the district court.             See Armstrong v.\n\nBush,    924   F.2d   282,   296   n.13    (D.C.   Cir.   1991);   Consolidated\n\nExpress, Inc. v. N.Y. Shipping Ass’n, 602 F.2d 494, 501-502 (3d\n\nCir. 1979).     However, the general rule, like that in section 1291\n\nappeals, Speaks v. Trikora Lloyd, 839 F.2d 1436, 1439 (5th Cir.\n\n1988); Shipp v. General Motors, 750 F.2d 418, 428 (5th Cir. 1985),\n\nis that a party cannot procure a modification favorable to it of an\n\norder certified under section 1292(b) absent that party’s having\n\ntimely applied for permission to appeal, even though the opposite\n\nparty did so timely apply and permission was granted.               See, e.g.,\n\nTranello v. Frey, 962 F.2d 244, 248 (2d Cir. 1992); Luria Steel &\n\nTrading Corp. v. Ogden Corp., 484 F.2d 1016, 1019, 1023-24 (3d Cir.\n\n1973).    See also Rodriguez v. Banco Central, 917 F.2d 664, 668-669\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).       But see Armstrong v. Executive Office, 1 F.3d\n\n1274, 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (apparently contra, but unclear).              So,\n\nthe question of section 1292(b) jurisdiction over plaintiffs’\n\nchallenge to the district court’s denial of relief for years after\n\n1982 would seem to turn on whether plaintiffs timely requested\n\npermission to appeal.         The district court’s December 18, 1995,\n\n                                          21\n\forder was entered December 19, 1995; plaintiffs’ notice of appeal\n\nwas filed in the district court on December 20, 1995, was received\n\nin this Court on December 28, 1995, and was docketed here on\n\nDecember 29, 1995, and was thus before this Court “within ten days\n\nof the entry of the order” of December 18 as section 1292(b)\n\nrequires for an application for permission to appeal.              An ordinary\n\nnotice   of   appeal   under   section      1291   does   not   constitute   an\n\napplication    for   permission   to    appeal     as   required   by   section\n\n1292(b). Aucoin v. Matador Services, Inc., 749 F.2d 1180 (5th Cir.\n\n1985); Aparicio v. Swan Lake, 643 F.2d 1109, 1111 (5th Cir. 1981).\n\nHowever, this December 20, 1995, notice of appeal is not an\n\nordinary section 1291 notice, as it not only specifically mentions\n\nsection 1292(b), but also, by attaching and referring to a copy of\n\nthe district court’s December 18 order, identifies the issues and\n\nthe need for immediate appeal.          In Aucoin, we observed that the\n\nnotice of appeal there lacked “a statement of the basis for a\n\ndiscretionary appeal” and stated “we do not rest on form for its\n\nesthetics; rather, we look to function.”           Id. at 1181.    Aucoin also\n\npoints to the desirability of the appellate court’s being called on\n\nto assess whether to allow an appeal at a time relatively close to\n\nthe trial court’s certification.             Id.    In neither Aucoin nor\n\nAparicio had any party ever filed with this Court an application\n\nfor permission to appeal under section 1292(b).                    Plaintiffs’\n\nDecember 20 notice of appeal contains the important information\n\n\n                                       22\n\fcalled for by Fed. R. App. P. 5(b), and its only substantive\n\ndeficiency is that it does not specifically ask us to issue an\n\norder granting permission to appeal; yet such a request was timely\n\nbefore us as to the June 6, 1995, order by Shell’s December 28 Fed.\n\nR. App. P. 5 application.   Applying the Aucoin standard, under all\n\nthese circumstances it is not too much of a stretch to treat\n\nplaintiffs’ notice of appeal as minimally meeting the requisites of\n\na Fed. R. App. P. 5 application to “cross appeal.”16   Accordingly,\n\nto resolve any doubts which might arise as to the efficacy of\n\nplaintiffs’ Rule 54(b) appeal from so much of the June 6, 1995,\n\norder as denied them any recovery for the years after 1982, we\n\ntreat plaintiffs’ notice of appeal received in this Court on\n\nDecember 28, 1995, as an application for permission to appeal under\n\nsection 1292(b) and we grant the application so far only as it\n\nrelates to the June 6, 1995, order.\n\n     However, assuming arguendo that plaintiffs’ December 1995\n\nnotice of appeal could properly be treated by us as a section\n\n1292(b) application for permission to appeal the district court’s\n\n\n16\n     We note that in Cobb v. Lewis, 488 F.2d 41, 53 (5th Cir.\n1974), we treated an application for permission to appeal under\nsection 1292(b) as a section 1291 notice of appeal. In Tranello,\nthe Second Circuit was careful to point out that nothing by the\nputative “cross-appellant” was filed in the court of appeals within\nthe section 1292(b) ten-day period; in Luria Steel & Trading Co.,\nthere was never an attempted “cross-appeal” of any kind; and in\nRodriguez, the court pointed out that the “cross-appellant’s”\nnotice of appeal, though filed in the district court within ten\ndays of the entry of the section 1292(b) order, was not received in\nthe court of appeals until well after the ten-day period had run.\n\n                                 23\n\fSeptember 28, 1995, denial of prejudgment interest respecting the\n\nyears   1979-1982,    we     deny   leave     to   appeal   that   matter.      The\n\nSeptember 28, 1995, order denying prejudgment interest as to those\n\nyears is plainly not appealable under section 1291 and Rule 54(b),\n\nand we have at no relevant time been requested to grant leave to\n\nappeal that order.       The June 6 order does not address prejudgment\n\ninterest. Shell has reasonably taken the position that prejudgment\n\ninterest is not properly before us.                 Moreover, resolving that\n\nquestion    would   do   little     to   materially      advance   the    ultimate\n\ntermination of the litigation, as, if there is any right to recover\n\nactual damages, those must still be ascertained and quantified in\n\nany event, and the additional calculation for prejudgment interest,\n\nif any, would then become an essentially ministerial or mechanical\n\ntask.    Ruling now on prejudgment interest does not hold much\n\npotential    for    saving    significant      further      proceedings    in   the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n     The upshot of all this is that plaintiffs’ entitlement to\n\nprejudgment interest is not properly before us.                What is properly\n\nbefore us is Shell’s complaint that the district court erred in\n\nholding it had underpaid royalty for the years 1979-1982, and the\n\ndistrict court’s holding that Shell had not underpaid for the years\n\nafter 1982.    As to the latter, however, we consider only the years\n\n1985 and 1986, as those are all plaintiffs complain of in their\n\nbrief (their complaints as to the years 1983 and 1984 are hence\n\nwaived).\n\n                                         24\n\f       We turn at last to the merits.\n\nII.    The District Court’s June 6 Order Determining Liability\n\n       A.    Standard of Review\n\n       The case below was tried before the district court.                           We\n\ntherefore      review    all   factual       findings      for     clear   error    and\n\nconclusions of law de novo. Peaches Entertainment v. Entertainment\n\nRepertoire, 62 F.3d 690, 693 (5th Cir. 1995).\n\n       Both parties challenge, at different junctures, the district\n\ncourt’s      findings    regarding     the       prevailing   “market      value”   for\n\nThomasville gas, findings which bear upon both Shell’s contractual\n\nliability and the amount of any damages that might be owed.                       Market\n\nvalue is “what a willing seller and a willing buyer in a business\n\nwhich       subjects    them   and    the      commodity      to   restriction      and\n\nregulation, including a commitment for a long period of time, would\n\nagree to take and pay with a reasonable expectation that the [FERC]\n\nwould approve the price (and price changes) and other terms and\n\nthen issue the necessary certificate of public convenience and\n\nnecessity.”      Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 852 (internal ellipses and\n\nbrackets omitted), quoting Weymouth v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co.,\n\n367 F.2d 84, 90 (5th Cir. 1966).                 “Market value is a question of\n\nfact, and it is up to the fact finder to determine the probative\n\nstrength of relevant evidence.”              Piney Woods II, 726 F.2d at 238.\n\nWe    review    the    district      court’s      findings    mindful      that   under\n\nMississippi law “the royalty owners, as plaintiffs, bear the burden\n\n\n                                            25\n\fof going forward with sufficient evidence to prove their damages by\n\na preponderance of the evidence.”        Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 845\n\n(citation omitted) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n\nFinally, although Mississippi law requires that the existence of\n\ndamages     be   reasonably   certain    and   susceptible   to   pecuniary\n\nvaluation before relief can be granted, the plaintiffs will not be\n\ndenied recovery merely because some measure of speculation and\n\nconjecture is required in determining the amount of damages.          Id.,\n\n905 F.2d at 945-946 (citations omitted).\n\n     B.    Shell’s Liability for 1979-1982\n\n     We are here concerned only with gas from the section 107 wells\n\n(see note 9, supra, and accompanying text).\n\n     In Piney Woods II, this Court approved three methods of\n\ndetermining market value in this case.             The preferred method,\n\ncomparable sales of sour gas, did not exist and according to the\n\ndistrict court continued to elude evidentiary substantiation in\n\n1995.     “The next-best method is to examine sales of sweet gas and\n\nsulfur, to determine the market value of the products resulting\n\nfrom processing at the Thomasville plant,” whereupon “[p]rocessing\n\ncosts may . . . be deducted as an indirect means of determining\n\nwhat a buyer would have paid for the sour gas at the wellhead.”\n\nPiney Woods II, 726 F.2d at 240.         This was the method utilized by\n\nthe district court in the instant case.\n\n     In Piney Woods IV, this Court affirmed the district court’s\n\n\n                                    26\n\fruling rejecting the plaintiffs’ proof for the years 1972-1978 on\n\nthe ground that the proffered proof of comparable sweet gas sales\n\nwas flawed.   Now, however, the district court, relying upon four\n\nlong-term contracts involving the sale of sweet gas processed from\n\nsour gas from Mississippi fields, has derived a mean rate scale\n\ndemonstrative of the “interstate market value” for processed sour\n\ngas.    This index of market value, when juxtaposed to the actual\n\nprices paid under the Shell-MisCoa long-term contract, illustrates\n\nShell’s liability and provides the basis for a calculation of\n\ndamages.\n\n       We affirm the district court’s use of these sales and the\n\n“interstate market value” derived therefrom. These sales contracts\n\nexhibit    geographical,   market    output,   and   gas   quality\n\ncharacteristics markedly similar (and in one case identical) to\n\nthose of the Thomasville facility,17 overcoming the inadequacies in\n\nthe plaintiffs’ showing for the years 1972-1978 which we remarked\n\n17\n     The Shell-MisCoa contract, made in 1972, had a term of 13\nyears, with provisions for extension, and involved the sale of\nsection 105 and section 107 pipeline quality sweet gas processed\nfrom sour gas, with a daily deliverability quota of 40,000 Mcf.\nThe “interstate market value” found by the district court is based\nupon four comparable sales contracts: Amerada Hess-Transco (P-\n136), Pursue-Southern Natural (P-137), Shell-Transco (P-138), and\nTomlinson-Transco (P-139). All of these contracts concern only\nsection 107 pipeline quality gas. The Pursue, Shell, and Tomlinson\ncontracts concern sour gas produced in Rankin County and processed\non site into sweet gas. The Amerada Hess, Shell, and Tomlinson\ncontracts have terms of fifteen years and were entered into between\n1978 and 1982, while the Pursue contract extends for the life of\nthe field. All of the contracts set daily deliverability quotas at\ndifferent levels: Amerada Hess (50,000 Mcf), Pursue (180,000 Mcf),\nShell (54,000 Mcf), Tomlinson (33,500 Mcf).\n\n                                27\n\fupon in Piney Woods IV.    These sales contracts further demonstrate\n\nboth the existence of willing buyers on the interstate market\n\nbetween 1979-1982 and reveal a discernible market price for sweet\n\ngas processed from section 107 sour gas wells producing during this\n\ntime period, i.e., the Spengler, Garrett, Stevens, and Clark wells.\n\nThe district court did not clearly err in its determination of the\n\nmarket value of processed gas.\n\n      However, the determination of the market value of processed\n\ngas is only part of the equation for determining the “market value”\n\nof the Thomasville gas “at the well,” the value on which Shell\n\nshould have computed royalty.    “The method of analysis approved in\n\nPiney Woods II for assessing the market value of Thomasville’s\n\nultra-sour gas at the wellhead by using comparable sweet gas sales\n\nwas to take the price established for the sweet gas market, then\n\ndeduct the processing costs inherent in changing the sour gas to\n\nsweet gas, and thus arrive at the price of sour gas at the\n\nwellhead.”   Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 848.       We have previously\n\nobserved that this formula of sweet gas value-minus-processing\n\ncosts serves as a proxy, “an indirect means of determining what a\n\nbuyer would have paid for the sour gas at the wellhead.”           Piney\n\nWoods II, 726 F.2d at 240.     Accordingly, we have emphasized that\n\nany   consideration   of   Shell’s     processing   costs——which   under\n\nMississippi law as applied to both “amount realized by lessee,\n\ncomputed at the mouth of the well” and “market value at the well”\n\n\n                                  28\n\flease provisions are not deductible as such——is necessitated by the\n\nabsence of comparable sales of sour gas establishing a market (or\n\nactual sales) price for the gas prior to processing.          Id.\n\n       In addition, this Court in Piney Woods II held that only\n\nreasonable processing costs could be considered for such purpose,\n\nnoted that although the district court had not made an express\n\nfinding as to the reasonableness of the processing costs deducted\n\nby Shell, the record would support such a finding, and left that\n\nissue “open for further consideration by the district court.” Id.,\n\n726 F.2d at 241.   Following our Piney Woods II remand, the district\n\ncourt (in Piney Woods III), as we noted in Piney Woods IV, “found\n\nthat Shell’s ‘plant processing’ charges were reasonable.”              Piney\n\nWoods III, 905 F.2d at 843.      Piney Woods IV did not disturb that\n\nfinding.\n\n       Shell’s central argument on appeal challenges the district\n\ncourt’s use of Shell’s actual processing costs in determining the\n\nwellhead value of the gas. Shell argues that this approach ignores\n\nvariables like capital investment, risk, and profit motive, factors\n\nwhich any willing buyer of Rankin County sour gas would have to\n\ntake into consideration before entering into a long-term contract\n\nto process, market, and transport that gas.         Shell also points out\n\nthat   inflationary   factors   have    increased   the   costs   of   plant\n\nconstruction beyond that of the Thomasville facility, built in the\n\nearly 1970s, and posits that insofar as inflation is a factor in\n\n                                   29\n\fincreased market prices during the relevant time frame a variable\n\nshould be introduced to account for an extrapolated increase in\n\ncosts.\n\n      Insofar as Shell claims that “processing costs” are something\n\nother than its actual costs, any proper consideration of that\n\nargument must begin with our foundational opinion in Piney Woods\n\nII.   There we addressed plaintiffs’ challenge to Shell’s practice\n\nof deducting its actual processing costs from its actual tailgate\n\nsales    proceeds   to   determine   royalty   due.   We   rejected   this\n\nchallenge, and sided with Shell, both as to leases (such as the\n\n“Producers 88 (9170)”, see notes 2 & 3 supra) providing for royalty\n\nto be based on the “amount realized by lessee, computed at the\n\nmouth of the well” and as to leases providing for royalty based on\n\n“market value at the well.”      We stated:\n\n      “Expenses incurred after production may be charged\n      against royalty computed ‘at the well’. 3 H. Williams,\n      Oil and Gas Law § 645 (1981). Accordingly, the costs of\n      processing and transportation maybe deducted.\n\n           . . . ‘at the well’ refers not only to the place of\n      sale but also to the condition of the gas when sold. ‘At\n      the well’ means that the gas has not been increased in\n      value by processing or transportation.       It has this\n      meaning in conjunction with ‘value’ or ‘amount realized’\n      as well as with ‘sold’. The lessors under these leases\n      are therefore entitled to royalty based on the value or\n      price of unprocessed, untransported gas. [citation]. On\n      royalties ‘at the well,’ therefore, the lessors may be\n      charged with processing costs, by which we mean all\n      expenses, subsequent to production, relating to the\n      processing, transportation, and marketing of gas and\n      sulphur.\n\n            We emphasize, however, that processing costs are\n\n                                     30\n\f     chargeable only because, under these leases, the\n     royalties are based on value or price at the well.\n     Processing costs may be deducted only from valuations or\n     proceeds that reflect the value added by processing.”\n     Id. at 240 (emphasis added).\n\nWe went on to say:\n\n     “The lessors are entitled to gas royalty at the well.\n     This means royalty based on the value or price of the\n     sour gas before it is separated into marketable\n     constituents. The value or sale price of the residue\n     sweet gas reflects Shell’s processing costs.\n\n          We agree with the plaintiffs that the processing\n     costs,under both the “market value” and “amount realized”\n     provisions, must be reasonable.” Id. at 241 (emphasis\n     added)\n\nAnd, we concluded “[t]o determine the correct basis for royalty,\n\nprocessing and transportation costs may be deducted from values or\n\nprices established for processed and transported gas.” Id. at 242.\n\n     Nothing in our discussion of “processing costs” indicates that\n\nthe “expenses” to which we referred were hypothetical or derivative\n\nin nature; rather, given the nature of the plaintiffs’ challenge,\n\nwe were plainly addressing the processing, transportation, and\n\nmarketing expenses actually incurred by Shell (and actually passed\n\non to the royalty owners)——”Shell’s processing costs.” Furthermore,\n\nthis was applicable to both the “market value” and the “amount\n\nrealized”   lease   provisions.   This   view   is   reinforced   by   our\n\nreliance in the above Piney Woods II passage on the general rule\n\nthat where the lease calls for royalty to be “computed ‘at the\n\nwell’” the “[e]xpenses incurred after production” are deducted.\n\nObviously, this refers to the lessee’s actual expenses (to the\n\n                                  31\n\fextent reasonable), as reflected by the treatise we cited in\n\nsupport of that proposition.         See Williams & Meyers (Martin &\n\nKramer), Oil & Gas Law, § 645.2 (1996 Ed).\n\n     Contrary to the manifest implication of the above referenced\n\nPiney Woods II passages, however, Shell seizes upon one passage\n\nfrom Piney Woods II as a foundation upon which to construct its\n\nargument. Our initial observation is that the passage Shell seizes\n\nupon occurs in Part VIII of that opinion, in which we addressed\n\nShell’s practice      of   disregarding   gas   used   for   plant   fuel   in\n\ncomputing royalty, and not Part VII of the opinion, our discussion\n\nof the propriety of Shell’s deduction of processing costs in\n\ncomputing royalty.         The passage upon which Shell relies, which\n\nfollows   a   brief   discussion    of    the   accounting     methodologies\n\napplicable to the plant fuel question, states:\n\n     “Finally, processing costs are not per se chargeable to\n     market value royalty. They must be reasonable costs, and\n     the market value of sour gas may be more or less in a\n     given time period than the value of the finished products\n     less processing expenses.” Piney Woods II, 726 F.2d at\n     241.\n\n     Shell contends that this statement implies the existence of\n\na “value added” component which is not reflected by the simple\n\nformula of processed gas market value minus actual costs. But such\n\nis not necessarily the meaning of that passage.              The limitation,\n\nwhich we emphasized, that the costs must be “reasonable” suggests\n\notherwise.     Further, it is not clear that “the value of the\n\nfinished products” refers to their market value, as opposed to\n\n                                     32\n\ftheir   sales    proceeds;     if   the     latter,     the   statement   merely\n\nrecognizes that if the “market value” of the gas at the wellhead is\n\ndetermined either by using comparable sales of sour gas or through\n\nthe proxy of comparable sales of sweet gas-less-processing costs\n\nthe result may well differ from the method utilized by Shell in\n\ncomputing royalties, i.e., the actual sales price of processed\n\nThomasville     gas,    “the   value   of   the    finished    products,”   less\n\nprocessing costs.       Moreover, Shell had never actually accounted to\n\nthe lessors for any royalty on gas used as plant fuel, it had\n\nmerely assumed it was “a wash”.           Id. at 241.    We were at that point\n\nunwilling to simply make that assumption, and remanded that matter\n\nto the trial court.       Ultimately, in Piney Woods IV we sustained the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling for Shell on remand in this respect (Piney\n\nWoods III), and we accepted Shell’s contention “that it owes the\n\nroyalty owners nothing [respecting gas used for plant fuel], as the\n\nroyalty payments on plant fuel that would have been due to them are\n\nexactly balanced by the share of the processing costs that are to\n\nbe borne by the royalty owners.”                  Id. 905 F.2d at 856.        We\n\nconcluded “because we find that plant fuel is a processing cost, we\n\nread our Piney Woods II decision as merely ratifying as correct the\n\nexisting course of performance [as to plant fuel] on the royalty\n\ncontract . . .”        Id. 905 F.2d at 857.\n\n     In sum, the two brief above quoted sentences from the part\n\n“VIII. Plant Fuel” portion of our Piney Woods II opinion, which\n\n\n                                       33\n\fShell relies on, do not suffice to overcome the clear thrust of\n\nthat opinion as a whole, namely:         that in the absence of comparable\n\nsales of sour gas, the best method of determining market value at\n\nthe well was to determine the market value of the sweet gas sold by\n\nShell at the Thomasville plant, by examining comparable sweet gas\n\nsales, and then deduct Shell’s actual processing and transportation\n\ncosts applicable to its Thomasville gas, so far as those costs were\n\nreasonable.      Moreover, this is plainly what in Piney Woods IV we\n\ncontemplated the district court would do if, following our remand\n\nthere, it found comparable sales of sweet gas sufficient to reflect\n\nmarket value of the Thomasville sweet gas in years after 1982.\n\n     We further determine that Shell’s evidence presented following\n\nour Piney Woods II remand——no further evidence having been presented\n\nfollowing our Piney Woods IV remand——does not compel a different\n\nconclusion.\n\n     Shell presented the testimony of two expert witnesses who\n\nattempted   to    postulate    the    construction    and    investment   costs\n\ninherent in the processing, transportation, and marketing of sour\n\ngas by considering the construction of a hypothetical on-site\n\nprocessing facility analogous to Shell’s Thomasville facility.\n\nShell’s point was that a willing buyer of the sour gas produced at\n\nthe plaintiffs’ wells would have to construct such facilities in\n\norder to market the gas because no market for unprocessed gas\n\nexists.     The   figures     Shell   used   were    based   upon   a   database\n\n\n                                       34\n\fcontaining information gathered from its worldwide operations and\n\ncomparable information describing other firms’ ventures. The price\n\ntag determined under the Shell model took into account the costs of\n\ninvestment, construction, and inflation, as well as the profit\n\nmotive of a prospective willing buyer, on a recurring annual basis.\n\n     The district court concluded that Shell’s model was fraught\n\nwith supposition and built upon unsubstantiated conjecture.     We\n\nare unable to say that this finding is   clearly erroneous.18\n\n     In sum, nothing in Shell’s “value added” argument convinces us\n\nthat the district court erred in law, or was clearly erroneous, in\n\nconcluding that Shell’s approach would not produce a determination\n\nof the section 107 gas’s market value at the wellhead more precise\n\nthan that made by the district court.      Shell’s recourse to an\n\nincreasingly recondite panoply of databases, charts, and indexes\n\nreeks of the abstruse and arcane, could properly be found to be\n\nsusceptible to manipulation due to its amorphous quality, to resist\n\nempirical validation, and to offer the prospect of interminably\n\nprolonging this twenty-three-year-old case.\n\n     We again reiterate that in Piney Woods II we held that where\n\ncomparable sales of sour gas were not available, the next best\n\n\n18\n     Shell’s actual costs of capital investment (as well as its\nactual operating costs) appear to have been passed on to the\nroyalty owners as processing costs. See Piney Woods II, 726 F.2d\nat 240. What is at stake in this litigation is not compensation\nfor Shell’s investment (and actual operating costs) in the\nThomasville facility, but rather the distribution of hypothetical\nprofits above and beyond those costs.\n\n                                35\n\fmethod of determining market value at the well was to first\n\ndetermine the market value of the Thomasville plant processed gas,\n\nif this could be done by evidence of comparable sweet gas sales,\n\nand then deduct Shell’s actual plant operations and transportation\n\ncosts, to the extent those were not unreasonable.            Nothing in Piney\n\nWoods IV changed that.    And, that is what the district court did.\n\nMoreover, we pointed out in Piney Woods II that “[m]arket value is\n\na question of fact, and it is up to the factfinder to determine the\n\nprobative strength of relevant evidence.”            Id.     726 F.2d at 238.\n\nAnd, we further stated that “ . . . if, on remand, the search for\n\nbetter measures of market value at the well proves unsuccessful or\n\ninordinately burdensome, we think its the duty of the district\n\ncourt to decide the question as best it can on the basis of the\n\nevidence that it presented.”         Id. at 239.    Again, that is what the\n\ndistrict court has done.         Its determinations are not clearly\n\nerroneous or infected by legal error.             Shell’s hypothetical cost\n\ncontentions present no basis for reversal.\n\n     Shell raises two other arguments against the district court’s\n\nimposition of liability. Shell first posits that in Piney Woods IV\n\nwe held it was under no duty to renegotiate its contracts to enter\n\nthe interstate market and thus now cannot be held liable for\n\nfailing to perfect sales contracts commensurate with that market\n\nrate.   Piney   Woods   IV,    905    F.2d   at   854-855.     In    a   related\n\ncontention,   Shell   argues    that    although     its   section       107   gas\n\n\n                                      36\n\ftheoretically could have been sold on the interstate market for\n\ngreater than its section 105/long-term contract prices, it was\n\nunder no obligation to transfer section 107 gas from the intrastate\n\nto the interstate market.         In regard to this latter submission,\n\nShell notes that the regulatory regimes which govern the intrastate\n\nand interstate markets are significantly different and argues that\n\nsuch a difference in “legal quality” militates against the district\n\ncourt’s ruling.\n\n     Regarding Shell’s first point, the Piney Woods IV language\n\nrelied upon by Shell dealt solely with the plaintiffs’ claim that\n\nShell was obligated to renegotiate its long-term contract to obtain\n\nrates more in accord with those prevailing on the interstate\n\nmarket.    In rejecting that contention, we made it clear that we\n\nwere addressing only section 105 gas, for which Shell’s long-term\n\ncontract price as of        November 1978, was also the maximum lawful\n\nprice Shell could charge.        Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 851.          In\n\nother words, we found that section 105 effectively limited the\n\nmarket    for   section    105   gas    to     Shell’s   long-term   contract,\n\nvindicating     Shell’s     actual     sales    price-less-processing-costs\n\nroyalty basis as to gas governed by section 105.              Shell’s present\n\nargument completely ignores our reasoning in vacating and remanding\n\nthe district court’s decision as to 1979-1986, namely the fact that\n\nThomasville section 107 gas was eligible for sale on the burgeoning\n\ninterstate market.        Shell’s failure to renegotiate its long-term\n\n\n                                       37\n\fcontract is essentially irrelevant to a determination of what the\n\nproper “market value” of that section 107 gas was.         Shell’s\n\nsubmission is without merit.\n\n     Shell’s second argument revolves around language excerpted\n\nfrom our discussion in Piney Woods IV concerning Shell’s lack of a\n\nduty to redrill its wells:19\n\n     “In Piney Woods II, id. at 239 n. 17, we quoted from\n     [Exxon v. Middleton, 613 S.W.2d 240, 246-247 (Tex.\n     1981)], which stated that comparable sales are those made\n     in the same category of a regulated market. Under this\n     method of assessing market value, Shell as lessee must\n     pay royalties on the market price of gas under the\n     existing regulatory scheme governing each well but is not\n     necessarily required to act to change the regulatory\n     scheme to achieve higher prices.” Piney Woods IV, 905\n     F.2d at 855.\n\nShell’s argument in essence adopts the Piney Woods IV principle\n\nthat there is no duty to change the relevant regulatory scheme and\n\napplies it to section 107 gas by attempting to bifurcate the\n\nsection 107 regulatory regime we recognized in Piney Woods IV into\n\nintrastate and interstate components.    The gas we are concerned\n\nwith in this portion of the opinion, however, falls within the\n\nregulatory regime of section 107; unlike section 105 gas, Shell’s\n\nlong-term “intrastate” contract price does not define the upper\n\nreaches of the market for this gas, a fact reflected by the 1982\n\nShell-Transco contract.   Indeed, Shell has cited no statute or\n\n\n\n19\n     Redrilling the section 105 wells to over 15,000 feet in depth\nwould have resulted in those wells being reclassified as section\n107 wells. See note 6, supra.\n\n                                38\n\fregulation, federal or state, which erected any legal barrier to\n\nthe sale of section 107 gas on the interstate market.         This\n\nargument is at its core only another of Shell’s persistent attempts\n\nto define the available market in terms of its long-term contract\n\nrather than by reference to existing comparable contracts, in\n\nderogation of our holding in Piney Woods II.       Accordingly, we\n\nreject it.\n\n     We affirm the judgment of the district court holding that\n\nShell is liable for underpayment of royalty for the years 1979-\n\n1982.\n\n     B.   1983-1984\n\n     The district court found that during this period, beginning in\n\nNovember of 1982, all available section 107 gas was sold to Transco\n\nat an interstate market price.    Thus, Shell’s actual sales price\n\nfor this period reflects the market rate. Neither party challenges\n\nthis holding, and we discern no error in it.      Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court’s judgment absolving Shell of liability for the\n\nyears 1983-1984 is affirmed.\n\n\n\n     C.   1985-1986\n\n     Plaintiffs contend that the district court clearly erred by\n\nfinding that there was no competitive interstate market during this\n\ntime period for section 105 gas deregulated as of January 1, 1985.\n\nPlaintiffs base this contention on the Shell-Transco contract,\n\n\n                                 39\n\fwhich obligated Transco to take up to 54,000 Mcf per day, which was\n\nmore than the Thomasville plant’s 40,000 Mcf per day delivery\n\ncapacity.    The plaintiffs, noting that the district court accepted\n\nthe Transco contract price as the interstate market price during\n\n1983-1984 but abandoned this analysis thereafter, argue that the\n\nadmitted downturn in the interstate market can be tracked by the\n\n“market out” options Transco utilized to reduce its contract price\n\nthroughout this period.\n\n     The    record   reveals   that   due   to   the   interstate   market’s\n\ndownturn after 1982, numerous interstate pipeline corporations,\n\nlike Transco, were refusing to take delivery or pay for gas under\n\nexisting contracts.      Transco in particular markedly reduced its\n\ntakes during this time.        Furthermore, the Shell-Transco contract\n\nwas an “excess volume” contract subject to the preexisting MisCoa\n\ncontract and therefore presupposed the limitation on available gas\n\nresulting from the MisCoa contract.\n\n     The district court’s finding that no additional buyers were\n\npresent on the rapidly fading interstate market after 1982 is\n\nsupported by the record.       The record suggests further that Transco\n\nwas the only viable buyer in that market for the relevant time\n\nperiod.    We agree with Shell that the nature of the Shell-Transco\n\ncontractual relationship is an adequate basis on which the fact\n\nfinder may properly reject, as unduly speculative, any suggestion\n\nthat plaintiffs had shown Transco would have purchased section 105\n\ngas which was freed of the Shell-MisCoa contract. Furthermore, the\n\n                                      40\n\ffact finder could properly take into account that there was no\n\nshowing that had Transco been forced to take all of Thomasville’s\n\n40,000 Mcf output it would not have exercised its “market-out”\n\noption to further reduce the contract price to one nearly identical\n\nto the MisCoa contract rate.         The burden of proving market value\n\nincludes proof of buyers willing to accept available deliveries,\n\nand the district court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that\n\nplaintiffs had failed to carry that burden.                 Finding no clear\n\nerror, we affirm this portion of the district court’s order as\n\nwell.\n\nIII.    Other Matter\n\n       Shell   argues   that   due   to   the   post-1982   downturn   in   the\n\ninterstate market the MisCoa contract price for the years 1982-1986\n\nactually exceeded the interstate market price and therefore Shell\n\nis entitled to equitable recoupment of overages on royalties paid\n\nto the plaintiffs during those years.            Shell bases this argument\n\nupon the proposition that the prices paid by Transco pursuant to a\n\ncontract entered into in 1982 cannot represent the market value in\n\n1983-1986. Shell posits that because the plaintiffs could identify\n\nno new buyers on the interstate market, the market was practically\n\nvalueless and therefore offered rates far below the MisCoa long-\n\nterm fixed rate contract price.\n\n       Assuming arguendo that Mississippi law allows for equitable\n\nrecoupment, see Glantz Contracting Co. v. General Electric Co., 379\n\n\n                                      41\n\fSo.2d 912 (Miss. 1980), no pleading of record evidences Shell’s\n\nintention to pursue an equitable recoupment theory.           See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. Pro. 8(c); Davis v. Odeco Inc., 18 F.3d 1237, 1246 (5th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 78 (1994); Chicago Great Western Ry. Co. v.\n\nPeeler, 140 F.2d 865, 868 (8th Cir. 1944); J.V. Edeskuty & Assoc.\n\nv. Jacksonville Kraft Paper, 702 F. Supp. 741, 749 (D. Minn. 1988).\n\nNor does it appear that this theory was proffered in the trial\n\ncourt prior to the district court’s December 1994 issuance of the\n\npreliminary draft of the June 6 order.        Furthermore, we note that\n\nShell’s claim is improperly based essentially upon a dearth in the\n\nplaintiffs’ proof.      In Piney Woods II we set out a hierarchy of\n\nthree   modes   of   analysis   in   determining   what   constitutes   the\n\nrelevant “market value” in this case; given our affirmance of the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that the plaintiffs’ proof of comparable\n\nprocessed sweet gas sales for this post-1982 period fails, the\n\napplicable analysis is by default that of Shell’s actual sales-\n\nminus-processing-costs system.        Had Shell properly counterclaimed\n\nor pleaded recoupment in its answer to plaintiffs’ claim, it could\n\nconceivably have offered evidence of a relevant market where prices\n\nwere less than what Shell actually charged.           No such pleadings\n\nexist, however, and even if they did Shell has not met its\n\npostulated burden of proving up the existence and parameters of\n\nsuch a hypothetical marketplace.          Shell’s claim for equitable\n\nrecoupment fails.\n\n\n                                     42\n\f     Finally, Shell has briefed the issue of whether, due to the\n\ndistrict court’s rulings, it will be necessary and proper on remand\n\nto send notices to those prospective plaintiffs whose claims have\n\nexceeded the jurisdictional amount since the class was originally\n\ncertified.   This question has not yet been ruled on in the district\n\ncourt and is not materially related to any issue presented by the\n\nJune 6, 1995 order we review today.         We therefore have no occasion\n\nto reach the class notice issue at this time.\n\n                                 Conclusion\n\n\n\n     We affirm the district court’s June 6, 1995 order, and hold\n\nthat plaintiffs are entitled to recover from Shell for underpayment\n\nof royalty for the period November 1978 through            November 1982 with\n\nrespect to the section 107 wells.         We approve the comparable sales\n\nevidence   utilized   by   the   district     court   in    determining   the\n\ninterstate market value for processed gas and the propriety of\n\nsubtracting from that market value Shell’s actual processing costs\n\nto determine the market value of the gas “at the well.”              Damages\n\nshall be calculated accordingly, without recoupment or set-off for\n\nany asserted post-1982 overpayment by Shell. We do not have before\n\nus, and do not reach, either the issue of plaintiffs entitlement to\n\nprejudgment interest or the question of whether further notice to\n\nclass members is required.       As to periods after November 1982, we\n\naffirm the district court’s determination that Shell has not\n\n\n\n                                     43\n\funderpaid royalty and is not liable to plaintiffs.\n\n     The district court’s June 6, 1995 order is AFFIRMED, and the\n\ncause is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent herewith.\n\n\n\n\n                               44\n\f",

Plaintiffs complain of\n\nthe district court’s ruling that gas royalties were not underpaid\n\nin the years 1985 and 1986.     Plaintiffs also complain of the denial\n\nof prejudgment interest with respect to the 1979-1982 underpayment.\n\nWe   decline   to   consider   the    prejudgment     interest     matter,     and\n\notherwise reject all the mentioned challenges to the district\n\ncourt’s rulings.\n\n                      Facts and Proceedings Below\n\n      The   subject   matter   of    this   lawsuit    is   royalty   from     gas\n\nproduced in Rankin County, Mississippi.           The gas from the Rankin\n\nCounty fields is “sour,” that is, it contains more than trace\n\namounts of hydrogen sulfide and other contaminants.                 Before this\n\ngas can be sold on the market, it must be transported to an\n\nappropriate facility and processed into “sweet” gas. Shell, lessee\n\nin oil and gas leases in which plaintiffs are (or hold under) the\n\nlessors, treats the sour gas itself on site at its Thomasville\n\nplant in Rankin County, recovering from the original sour gas both\n\n\n\nunder the limited circumstances set forth in Local Rule 47.5.4.\n\n                                       2\n\fsweet gas (dry methane) and elemental sulfur.\n\n     In 1970 Shell began efforts to market the gas produced from\n\nthese fields.     It sought buyers only in the intrastate market\n\nbecause it wished to avoid restrictive federal regulations on\n\ninterstate sales.     In 1972 Shell entered into a fifteen-year\n\ncontract to sell the bulk of its production, 40,000 Mcf per day, to\n\nMisCoa.1   Shell also entered into a similar long-term contract\n\narrangement with Mississippi Power & Light (MP&L), which agreed to\n\ntake the excess volume produced by Shell’s Thomasville facility.\n\nAlthough these contracts were the best available at the time,\n\nsubsequent developments in the international fuels market quickly\n\nresulted in the fixed rates specified in those contracts being far\n\nbelow sweet gas prices available on the open market.\n\nPiney Woods I\n\n     On December 27, 1974, landowners in Rankin County filed this\n\nlawsuit against Shell, their mineral lessee, over royalty allegedly\n\ndue them from natural gas produced under these leases and processed\n\nat Shell’s Thomasville plant. The lawsuit was certified as a class\n\naction in 1978.    The plaintiffs claimed that Shell’s practice of\n\ncomputing royalty from the long-term fixed rate contract proceeds\n\nwas, given the post-1972 gas price inflation, in derogation of\n\ntheir contractual right to be paid “the market value” of the gas\n\n\n1\n     An Mcf is 1000 cubic feet.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1868</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985).      The Piney Woods II panel made a\n\nnumber of determinations which inform the issues presently before\n\nthis Court.\n\n     First,   we    concluded   that,   for   purposes   of   leases that\n\ndistinguished between gas “sold at the well,” for which royalty was\n\nbased on “the amount realized from sale,” and other gas sold, for\n\nwhich the royalty was based on “market value at the well,” the gas\n\nin question was not “sold at the well,” and hence its royalty was\n\nto be based on “market value at the well.”         Piney Woods II, 726\n\nF.2d at 230-233.    We thus rejected Shell’s contention that the gas\n\nat issue from these leases was “sold at the well” so that its\n\nroyalty would be based on “the amount realized from sale” rather\n\n\n\n\n                                   4\n\fthan “market value at the well.”2       Second, this Court held that the\n\nlease term “market value” means “current market value at the time\n\nof production,” not, as Shell had argued, at the time it entered\n\ninto the MisCoa contract.    Piney Woods II, 726 F.2d at 238.    Third,\n\nthis Court found that because the pertinent leases provided for the\n\n“market value at the well,” the lessors were only “entitled to\n\nroyalty based on the value or price of unprocessed, untransported\n\n[i.e., sour,] gas.”   Id. at 240.       Fourth, we recognized that while\n\n“the best means of determining the market value at the well ...\n\nwould be to examine comparable sales of sour gas at other wells in\n\nthe area,” in the absence of such evidence “[t]he next-best method\n\nis to examine sales of sweet gas and sulfur, to determine the\n\nmarket value of the products resulting from processing at the\n\nThomasville plant.    Processing costs may then be deducted as an\n\nindirect means of determining what a buyer would have paid for sour\n\ngas at the wellhead.”       Id.   If the plaintiffs were unable to\n\nproffer sufficiently comparable sales of sweet gas to demonstrate\n\nsuch a market value, a third means of showing market value, Shell’s\n\nsystem based upon the amount actually realized from the sale of\n\n\n\n2\n     This holding applied to the great majority of the leases then\nat issue, and to all the leases now remaining in dispute. However,\nat the time of Piney Woods II, there was also at issue gas from at\nleast one lease (a “Producers 88 (9/70)” form) which provided that\nthe royalty on all gas sold by lease (not just that “sold at the\nwell”) was to be based on the “amount realized by lessee, computed\nat the mouth of the well.” Id. at 230 & n.6. See also id. at 240-\n41.\n\n                                    5\n\fThomasville gas-less-processing costs, could be utilized, although\n\nthis was the “least desirable method of determining market value.”\n\nId. at 239 (citation omitted).\n\n       Finally, we held that Shell could, as had been its practice,\n\ndeduct processing costs in computing royalty, because, although the\n\nroyalties were to be based on market value at the well, there were\n\napparently no comparable sales of sour gas, and thus “[p]rocessing\n\ncosts may then be deducted as an indirect means of determining what\n\na buyer would have paid for the sour gas at the wellhead.”         Id. at\n\n240.    “The function of processing costs in determining royalties\n\nbased on ‘market value at the well’ is to adjust for imperfect\n\ncomparisons.”       Id.    “The [market] value . . . of the [plant]\n\nresidue sweet gas reflects Shell’s processing costs. . . .”        Id. at\n\n241.    “To determine the correct basis for royalty, processing . .\n\n. costs may be deducted from values . . . established for processed\n\n. . . gas.”   Id. at 242.    However, only reasonable processing costs\n\ncould be so deducted.        Id. at 241.      We noted that although the\n\ndistrict    court    had    not   made   an   express   finding   on   the\n\nreasonableness of the processing costs deducted by Shell, “[t]he\n\nrecord would support a finding of reasonability”; and we left that\n\nissue “open for further consideration by the district court.”          Id.3\n\n\n3\n     With respect to gas from the lease (or the few leases) on the\n“Producers 88 (9/70)” form which provided that on all gas sold by\nlessee (not just that “sold at the well”) the royalty was based on\nthe “amount realized by lessee, computed at the mouth of the well”\n(see note 2, supra), we likewise held that Shell could deduct\n\n                                     6\n\fPiney Woods III\n\n      After remand the district court held another evidentiary\n\nhearing. The plaintiffs renewed their attempts to produce evidence\n\nof comparable sales of processed sweet gas from which a derivative\n\nmarket value for Thomasville processed gas could be established.4\n\nThe evidence adduced showed that the Shell-MP&L “excess volume”\n\ncontract had been terminated in 1981 and that in 1982 the Shell-\n\nMisCoa   contract   had   been    modified,     reducing    Shell’s   MisCoa\n\nobligation to 21,000 Mcf per day.        This in turn had freed up gas\n\nfor   the   newly   deregulated    interstate     market,    which    Shell’s\n\nThomasville facility entered by means of a new “excess volume”\n\ncontract with Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) in November\n\n1982.    During this entire period, Shell continued to compute its\n\nroyalty payments based upon the net proceeds obtained from these\n\n\n\nprocessing costs, because such a deduction was necessary to\ndetermine that portion of the price actually received for processed\ngas at the plant tailgate which was allocable to, and represented\nthe price received for, the unprocessed gas at the mouth of the\nwell. “The . . . sale price of the residue sweet gas reflects\nShell’s processing costs.” Id. at 241. Again, only reasonable\ncosts could be so deducted. Id.\n4\n     During this second hearing, Shell offered evidence of an\nalternative means of determining market value. Shell’s model was\npurportedly based upon the viewpoint of a willing buyer of the\nRankin County sour gas and consisted of evidence, culled from its\nworldwide drilling and processing operations, showing what it would\ncost to build a facility to process that gas into marketable sweet\ngas. Shell’s model involved not only the price tag for capital\nexpended in the construction and operation of the phantom plant(s),\nbut also introduced variables to account for inflation and the\nhypothetical willing buyer’s assumption of investment risk and\nprofit motive.\n\n                                     7\n\fcontracts, i.e., actual sales less processing costs.\n\n     In 1989 the district court rendered a judgment on the merits,\n\nfinding that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that the market\n\nrate for Thomasville processed gas was at any time greater than\n\nShell’s long-term contract rate.5        Piney Woods Country Life School\n\nv. Shell Oil Co., No. J74-0307 (W) (S.D. Miss., April 24, 1989)\n\n(Piney Woods III). Although the plaintiffs’ evidence of assertedly\n\ncomparable   sweet   gas   sales   for   the   years   1979-1986   was   not\n\nsubjected to nearly the same scrutiny by the district court as was\n\ntheir related evidence bearing on the market in 1972-1978, the\n\ndistrict court as to the years 1979-1986 relied in part upon\n\nfederal regulatory ceilings to support its ultimate view that\n\nShell’s accounting and payment practice was consonant with the\n\n“market value at the well” lease royalty provisions during that\n\nperiod.\n\nPiney Woods IV\n\n     The plaintiffs pursued a direct appeal from this judgment,\n\nbringing the case before this Court for a second time.

The Natural Gas\n\nPolicy   Act   (NGPA),   which   took   effect   on   November   9,   1978,\n\nsegregated gas wells, including those in Rankin County, into two\n\ndistinct regulatory regimes.6     15 U.S.C. § 3315 (section 105 of the\n\nNGPA) provided that the maximum lawful price which could be charged\n\nfor gas produced at wells within its demesne was “the price under\n\nthe terms of the existing contract, to which such natural gas was\n\nsubject on November 9, 1978.”     Accordingly, this Court found that,\n\nafter section 105 became law in 1978, for gas produced from Rankin\n\nsection 105 wells “the actual price Shell was receiving became the\n\nmaximum lawful price that it could receive.”          Piney Woods IV, 905\n\nF.2d at 851.\n\n     A different result, however, obtained for those wells falling\n\nunder 15 U.S.C. § 3317 (section 107 of the NGPA).         Under the NGPA,\n\ngas from section 107 wells could be sold on the interstate market\n\nat the going “market value.”7      Section 107 gas, unlike that from\n\nsection 105 wells, was thus not legally locked into a maximum price\n\ndetermination based upon Shell’s pre-existing contract, but rather\n\n\n\n6\n     The distinction between these two regimes was based upon\nspecified physical characteristics. The only one that is relevant\nin this case is drilling depth; those wells over 15,000 feet deep\nwere treated under section 107, rather than section 105, of the\nNGPA.\n7\n     The statute provides that section 107 gas may be sold on the\ninterstate market at the adjusted price calculated from the complex\nformula set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 3312 (section 102), establishing\na ceiling for the “interstate market value” at issue in this case.\n\n                                    9\n\fwas technically eligible for the higher prices available in the\n\ninterstate marketplace.\n\n      As noted, the district court in Piney Woods III had found that\n\nthe plaintiffs’ proof of market value for processed Thomasville gas\n\nfailed as a matter of fact for the years 1972-1986.             This Court in\n\nPiney Woods IV affirmed that finding as to the years prior to the\n\nNGPA’s enactment (1972-1978), holding that the district court did\n\nnot clearly err in concluding that the plaintiffs’ evidence of\n\ncomparable sweet gas sales did not show sufficient similarity to\n\nthe Thomasville processed gas sales.          We noted that many of the\n\ncomparable sales relied on did not reflect relevant nonprice\n\ninformation, such as whether contract terms included variable take\n\nor assured take provisions, the length of any commitment, the\n\nvolumes and quality of the gas, and whether the sale was interstate\n\nor   intrastate.     Other   sales   relied   on   were   of    questionable\n\ncomparability because they either involved casinghead gas (with BTU\n\nvalues   of   an   unspecified   level    higher   than   the    Thomasville\n\nprocessed gas), or involved smaller quantities or were for very\n\nshort terms “which may have reflected one buyer’s particular urgent\n\nneeds.” Id. at 848. Additionally, we observed that “[e]ven though\n\nthe buyer of the Thomasville gas would be buying sweet gas (as\n\nShell did process the Thomasville gas), the delivery of that gas\n\nstill would be uncertain, as all the problems that can occur with\n\nthe ultrasour gas would directly affect the downstream delivery of\n\n\n                                     10\n\fthe sweet gas.”   Id. at 848.   Hence, “it was not clear error for\n\nthe district court to find that what was paid for other sweet gas\n\nin smaller amounts . . . was not an accurate reflection of what the\n\nmarket value of gas from the Thomasville plant would have been,”\n\nand “the district court was within its discretion to find that the\n\nrisk inherent in guaranteeing to take large quantities of sweet gas\n\nprocessed from ultrasour gas could not be decoupled from the value\n\nof a contract for that sweet gas.”   Id.8\n\n     This Court, however, vacated the district court’s judgment as\n\nto the gas produced by section 107 wells after November 1978, and\n\nas to all wells after January 1, 1985.       We observed that the\n\ndistrict court did not give “the same intensity of examination” to\n\nplaintiffs’ allegedly comparable sweet gas sales for the 1979-1986\n\nperiod as it had for the 1972-1978 period, and further that “as the\n\nnation’s and Mississippi’s gas prices were far higher during 1979-\n\n1982 than in the earlier years, the disparities in comparable\n\nmarkets may not be of sufficient moment during the latter period to\n\nexplain the discrepancy between prices received by Shell for\n\nThomasville gas and prices received in other Mississippi sales.”\n\nHowever, we noted that the district court had also “relied upon\n\nregulatory price ceilings as an additional ground to support its\n\n\n8\n     In Piney Woods IV, we also observed that the district court\n(in Piney Woods III) “found that Shell’s ‘plant processing’ charges\nwere reasonable,” Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 843, and we did not\ndisturb that finding.\n\n\n                                11\n\ffinding . . . for the years after 1978.”        Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d\n\nat 850-51.    We then turned to a consideration of the effect of the\n\nprice ceilings during the years after 1978.\n\n       Rejecting the district court’s contrary ruling, this Court\n\nfound that evidence of record, in particular plaintiff’s exhibit P-\n\n155,   a   well-by-well,   month-by-month    listing   of   Shell’s   sales\n\nproceeds, enabled the district court to differentiate between the\n\norigins of section 105 and section 107 gas and thus determine which\n\nlandowners were possibly entitled to damages.            In addition, we\n\ndetermined that particular aspects of the Shell-Transco contract\n\ntriggered section 105(b)(3) of the NGPA and placed the section 105\n\ngas being sold to Transco under the same pricing scheme as section\n\n107 gas as of January 1, 1985.\n\n       Based upon these findings, the Piney Woods IV Court remanded\n\nthe case for a determination of whether Shell owed the owners of\n\nproperty with    section 107    wells9   damages   for   underpayment    of\n\nroyalties in the years 1979-1986.10         We also instructed that the\n\nsame inquiry be made for the owners of section 105 wells in the\n\nyears 1985-1986.    In so doing we observed that “if Shell received\n\nfrom its sales to Transco after December 31, 1984, less than the\n\n\n\n9\n     These were specified as the Garrett, Spengler, Clark, Edge,\nand Stevens wells. Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 853.\n10\n     Although we characterize the affected period as commencing in\n1979, we recognize that the last two months of 1978 are included\nwithin the relevant time frame.\n\n                                   12\n\fmarket value of the gas sold . . . the royalty owners are entitled\n\nto damages compensating them for not receiving their proper share\n\nof the true market value” and that “[d]amages will be due to the\n\nroyalty owners should the district court find on remand that the\n\nmarket value of the gas, limited by the applicable regulatory price\n\nceiling, was greater than the actual proceeds received by Shell for\n\nthe gas.”   Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 853-54.11\n\nPiney Woods V\n\n     Following remand, the district court, without holding any\n\nfurther evidentiary hearing, reconsidered the evidence of record\n\nand prepared a memorandum opinion and order addressing the merits\n\nof the plaintiffs’ claims.     The court released a draft of this\n\nopinion to the parties in December 1994.       Both parties filed\n\nobjections, and the district court heard oral argument on these\n\nobjections in February 1995.   The opinion and order were filed by\n\nthe district court, with the inclusion of a section rebutting the\n\nparties’ objections, on June 6, 1995.     Piney Woods Country Life\n\nSchool v. Shell Oil Co., No. 3:74-cv-307WS (S.D. Miss., June 6,\n\n1995) (Piney Woods V).\n\n\n\n11\n     In Piney Woods IV, we also held that, although royalty was\npayable on gas used as plant fuel, Shell owed nothing in this\nrespect notwithstanding Shell’s having simply ignored this item in\ntheir cost accounting, “because the plant fuel materially enhances\nthe value of the gas (giving the royalty owners more than the at-\nthe-well value for which they bargained), the cost of plant fuel\nmust be borne by the royalty owners in proportion to their royalty\nshare.” Id. at 857.\n\n                                 13\n\f     In Piney Woods V, the district court found that for section\n\n107 wells after 1978 and for all wells after 1984 “the market value\n\nfor deregulated Thomasville residue was the interstate market\n\nprice,   notwithstanding   that     it    continued   to   be   sold    in    the\n\nintrastate market pursuant to Shell’s long-term contract.”                   Piney\n\nWoods V, unpub. op. at 21.        The district court made findings of\n\nfact as to which wells qualified for section 105 and section 107\n\nstatus   at   particular   times,    the    amounts    available       for    the\n\ninterstate market, and the value on that market, which the court\n\ndetermined by looking at comparable sales of record.\n\n     To determine Shell’s liability for the years 1979-1986, the\n\ndistrict court took the prevailing interstate market price for\n\nsweet gas and compared it to Shell’s actual sales over those years.\n\nBased upon this analysis, the district court found Shell liable for\n\nunderpayment of royalties during a period spanning November 1978,\n\nwhen the section 107 wells were “deregulated,” until November 1982,\n\nwhen Shell entered into its “excess volume” contract with Transco\n\nand sold all of its section 107 gas on the interstate market.                 The\n\nroyalties owed were to those owners of        section 107 wells producing\n\nduring this time period, with care taken after November 1982 not to\n\ninclude any amount sold at market price to Transco.             The district\n\ncourt concluded that Shell had no liability for the period 1983\n\n(December 1992)-1984 because during this time all section 107 well\n\nproduction was sold at the prevailing interstate market rate to\n\n\n                                     14\n\fTransco.      The district court also found that, due to record\n\nevidence indicating that a downturn in the interstate market after\n\n1982 left no prospective buyers in that market willing to contract\n\nfor Thomasville gas, the royalty owners were not entitled to any\n\ndamages for the years 1985-1986.12        Based upon these findings, the\n\ndistrict court ordered the parties to re-calculate damages.\n\n     In his rebuttal to the parties’ objections, the district court\n\nrejected Shell’s contention that the opinion’s approach to valuing\n\nthe Thomasville gas was invalid because it did not properly focus\n\non the value of the gas “at the wellhead,” i.e., as sour gas.          The\n\ndistrict court noted that Shell itself had used the value of sweet\n\ngas under its long-term contract to compute royalties, that prior\n\nopinions of this Court blessed the sweet gas market value less\n\nprocessing costs analysis utilized,           and that “many years of\n\nlitigation have never once revealed what the market value of sour\n\ngas at the well might be.”      Piney Woods V, unpub. op. at 33.     Shell\n\nalso objected to the district court’s finding that an interstate\n\nmarket was available during the years 1979-1982, an assertion which\n\nthe district court found belied by the fact that all of the\n\nThomasville plant’s section 107 production, freed from commitment\n\nto long-term contractual obligations in 1982, was sold on that\n\nmarket   to   Transco   in   1983-1984.     Addressing   the   plaintiffs’\n\n\n\n12\n     The district court observed that the interstate market price\nfell steadily during this period.\n\n                                    15\n\fobjections to the finding of no underpayment in the years 1985-\n\n1986, the district court found the plaintiffs’ assertion that\n\nTransco would have been willing to buy up all of the MisCoa\n\ncontract gas had it been available “speculative” at best and\n\ntherefore insufficient to meet their burden of proving market\n\nvalue.\n\n\n\nPresent appeals taken\n\n     On September 28, 1995, the district court filed an order\n\nexpressly granting plaintiffs’ motion for partial final judgment in\n\naccordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), denying\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for prejudgment interest, and denying Shell’s\n\nmotion for reconsideration of the “wellhead value” issue.       On\n\nSeptember 29, 1995, the district court entered a “Rule 54(b)\n\njudgment” to reflect the disposition of the June 6 order.       On\n\nOctober 3, 1995, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from this\n\n“Rule 54(b)” judgment, docketed in this Court under cause No. 95-\n\n60632. Shell also filed a notice of appeal and cross-appeal which,\n\nlike the plaintiffs’ appeal, was also docketed under No. 95-60632.\n\n     On December 18, 1995, the district court, on consideration of\n\na motion filed by Shell in the district court and plaintiff’s\n\nresponse thereto, signed and filed an order certifying the June 6\n\nand September 28 orders for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1292(b); that order was entered on the docket December 19,\n\n\n\n                                16\n\f1995.   On December 20, 1995, the plaintiffs filed a notice of\n\nappeal referencing the orders of June 6, September 28, and December\n\n18 (and attaching a copy of the latter).       The plaintiffs’ appeal\n\nwas docketed in this Court as cause No. 95-60813.     On December 28,\n\n1995, Shell filed with this Court a petition for permission to\n\npursue an interlocutory appeal from the June 6 order under section\n\n1292(b), which was docketed as our cause No. 95-00282.       To this\n\npoint, we have neither granted nor denied leave to appeal under\n\nsection 1292(b).   On January 16, 1996, Shell also filed a notice of\n\nappeal and cross-appeal in response to the December 18 order. This\n\ncross-appeal was docketed, like the plaintiffs’ appeal, under our\n\nNo. 95-60813.\n\n     On February 8, 1996, this Court consolidated cause Nos. 95-\n\n00282 and 95-60632.    On April 26, 1996, this Court consolidated\n\ncause Nos. 95-60632 (consolidated) and 95-60813 for purposes of\n\noral argument and final disposition.       Both parties have opted to\n\nsubmit one brief as to all consolidated appeals.\n\n                              Discussion\n\nI.   Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n     So far as the district court held plaintiffs were entitled to\n\nrecovery for the years 1979 through 1982, its ruling does not\n\ndispose of the entirety of plaintiffs’ claim——even assuming those\n\nyears can be treated as a separate claim——because it does not award\n\ndamages, and hence is not appealable under Rule 54(b).

R. App. P. 5 petition for\n\npermission to appeal the June 6, 1995, order.    We now grant Shell\n\nleave to appeal that order.\n\n     The situation as to the plaintiffs is somewhat different.\n\nArguably the June 6, 1995, order was certifiable and certified\n\nunder Rule 54(b) so far as it denied plaintiffs any recovery for\n\nyears after 1982.14   Two questions present themselves, however.\n\n\n13\n     In its June 6, 1995, order, the district court, although\nmaking findings regarding the interstate market price and Shell’s\nresultant liability, made no apportionment of gas quantities\nbetween particular section 107 and section 105 wells and also\nfailed to specify the quantities of section 107 gas redirected to\nTransco’s pipeline at market rates in the latter part of 1982.\nAccordingly, and due to the complex nature of the case and the\nongoing factual disputes and discrepancies concerning royalties\nowed and the ownership interests involved, the anticipated\ndetermination of the amount of damages cannot possibly be\ncharacterized as merely “ministerial.”\n14\n     And, if this is so, then plaintiffs’ October 1995 notice of\nappeal properly brings before us the district court’s denial of\nrecovery for years after 1982.\n     Plaintiffs’ October 1995 notice of appeal does not, however,\nbring forward the denial, by the district court’s September 28,\n1995, order, of plaintiffs’ claims for prejudgment interest as to\nthe years 1979-1982, because, as explained in the text above, no\ndistrict court order has been entered disposing of the entirety of\nany of plaintiffs’ claims respecting any of those years in that the\nright to recovery has been established but not the amount of\ndamages. As we ultimately affirm the district court’s holding that\n\n                                  18\n\fFirst, it is not entirely clear that the years after 1982 represent\n\nan entire claim (or claims), as opposed to being merely part of a\n\nsingle claim for royalty for the entire period after November 1978.\n\nIf the latter, Rule 54(b) certification is not available.    We are\n\ninclined to view the years after 1982 as presenting a separate\n\nclaim, not as being merely part of a larger, single indivisible\n\nclaim.   Second, the district court’s actual Rule 54(b) judgment of\n\nSeptember 29, 1995, states that the court “hereby enters judgment\n\nin favor of the plaintiffs pursuant to” the June 6, 1995, opinion.\n\nArguably, the district court meant to certify under Rule 54(b) only\n\nthe grant of relief for the years 1979-1982, not its denial for the\n\nyears after 1982.     We reject this contention.      We read the\n\nSeptember 29, 1995, order as certifying the June 6, 1995, order,\n\njust as if it had read “enters judgment in favor of the plaintiffs\n\nto the extent, but only to the extent, provided in the June 6,\n\n1995, order.”   To read the September 29 order as certifying under\n\nRule 54(b) only the granting of relief (without fixing damages) for\n\n1979-1982, but not the denial of relief for years after 1982, would\n\nbe to read the order as intending to certify under Rule 54(b) only\n\nthat which could not be so certified without intending to certify\n\nthat which could be certified.   Moreover, the September 29 order,\n\nas well as that of September 28, reflects that the court    granted\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for certification under Rule 54(b).     Although\n\n\nplaintiffs are entitled to no recovery for years after 1982, the\nquestion of prejudgment interest as to those years does not arise.\n\n                                 19\n\fthat motion is not in the record, we assume it was to certify the\n\nonly thing plaintiffs would have standing to appeal, namely the\n\ndenial of relief.      Accordingly, we have jurisdiction under Rule\n\n54(b) of plaintiffs’ challenge to the district court’s denial of\n\nrelief for the years following 1982.\n\n     The same jurisdictional result can perhaps also be justified\n\nunder section 1292(b).

So,\n\nthe question of section 1292(b) jurisdiction over plaintiffs’\n\nchallenge to the district court’s denial of relief for years after\n\n1982 would seem to turn on whether plaintiffs timely requested\n\npermission to appeal.         The district court’s December 18, 1995,\n\n                                          21\n\forder was entered December 19, 1995; plaintiffs’ notice of appeal\n\nwas filed in the district court on December 20, 1995, was received\n\nin this Court on December 28, 1995, and was docketed here on\n\nDecember 29, 1995, and was thus before this Court “within ten days\n\nof the entry of the order” of December 18 as section 1292(b)\n\nrequires for an application for permission to appeal.              An ordinary\n\nnotice   of   appeal   under   section      1291   does   not   constitute   an\n\napplication    for   permission   to    appeal     as   required   by   section\n\n1292(b). Aucoin v.

In Aucoin, we observed that the\n\nnotice of appeal there lacked “a statement of the basis for a\n\ndiscretionary appeal” and stated “we do not rest on form for its\n\nesthetics; rather, we look to function.”           Id. at 1181.    Aucoin also\n\npoints to the desirability of the appellate court’s being called on\n\nto assess whether to allow an appeal at a time relatively close to\n\nthe trial court’s certification.             Id.    In neither Aucoin nor\n\nAparicio had any party ever filed with this Court an application\n\nfor permission to appeal under section 1292(b).                    Plaintiffs’\n\nDecember 20 notice of appeal contains the important information\n\n\n                                       22\n\fcalled for by Fed. R. App. P. 5(b), and its only substantive\n\ndeficiency is that it does not specifically ask us to issue an\n\norder granting permission to appeal; yet such a request was timely\n\nbefore us as to the June 6, 1995, order by Shell’s December 28 Fed.\n\nR. App. P. 5 application.   Applying the Aucoin standard, under all\n\nthese circumstances it is not too much of a stretch to treat\n\nplaintiffs’ notice of appeal as minimally meeting the requisites of\n\na Fed. R. App. P. 5 application to “cross appeal.”16   Accordingly,\n\nto resolve any doubts which might arise as to the efficacy of\n\nplaintiffs’ Rule 54(b) appeal from so much of the June 6, 1995,\n\norder as denied them any recovery for the years after 1982, we\n\ntreat plaintiffs’ notice of appeal received in this Court on\n\nDecember 28, 1995, as an application for permission to appeal under\n\nsection 1292(b) and we grant the application so far only as it\n\nrelates to the June 6, 1995, order.\n\n     However, assuming arguendo that plaintiffs’ December 1995\n\nnotice of appeal could properly be treated by us as a section\n\n1292(b) application for permission to appeal the district court’s\n\n\n16\n     We note that in Cobb v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"315334\"><a href=\"/opinion/315334/walter-j-cobb-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-all-others-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 (5th Cir.\n1974), we treated an application for permission to appeal under\nsection 1292(b) as a section 1291 notice of appeal. In Tranello,\nthe Second Circuit was careful to point out that nothing by the\nputative “cross-appellant” was filed in the court of appeals within\nthe section 1292(b) ten-day period; in Luria Steel & Trading Co.,\nthere was never an attempted “cross-appeal” of any kind; and in\nRodriguez, the court pointed out that the “cross-appellant’s”\nnotice of appeal, though filed in the district court within ten\ndays of the entry of the section 1292(b) order, was not received in\nthe court of appeals until well after the ten-day period had run.\n\n                                 23\n\fSeptember 28, 1995, denial of prejudgment interest respecting the\n\nyears   1979-1982,    we     deny   leave     to   appeal   that   matter.      The\n\nSeptember 28, 1995, order denying prejudgment interest as to those\n\nyears is plainly not appealable under section 1291 and Rule 54(b),\n\nand we have at no relevant time been requested to grant leave to\n\nappeal that order.       The June 6 order does not address prejudgment\n\ninterest. Shell has reasonably taken the position that prejudgment\n\ninterest is not properly before us.                 Moreover, resolving that\n\nquestion    would   do   little     to   materially      advance   the    ultimate\n\ntermination of the litigation, as, if there is any right to recover\n\nactual damages, those must still be ascertained and quantified in\n\nany event, and the additional calculation for prejudgment interest,\n\nif any, would then become an essentially ministerial or mechanical\n\ntask.    Ruling now on prejudgment interest does not hold much\n\npotential    for    saving    significant      further      proceedings    in   the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n     The upshot of all this is that plaintiffs’ entitlement to\n\nprejudgment interest is not properly before us.                What is properly\n\nbefore us is Shell’s complaint that the district court erred in\n\nholding it had underpaid royalty for the years 1979-1982, and the\n\ndistrict court’s holding that Shell had not underpaid for the years\n\nafter 1982.    As to the latter, however, we consider only the years\n\n1985 and 1986, as those are all plaintiffs complain of in their\n\nbrief (their complaints as to the years 1983 and 1984 are hence\n\nwaived).\n\n                                         24\n\f       We turn at last to the merits.\n\nII.

Id.,\n\n905 F.2d at 945-946 (citations omitted).\n\n     B.    Shell’s Liability for 1979-1982\n\n     We are here concerned only with gas from the section 107 wells\n\n(see note 9, supra, and accompanying text).\n\n     In Piney Woods II, this Court approved three methods of\n\ndetermining market value in this case.             The preferred method,\n\ncomparable sales of sour gas, did not exist and according to the\n\ndistrict court continued to elude evidentiary substantiation in\n\n1995.     “The next-best method is to examine sales of sweet gas and\n\nsulfur, to determine the market value of the products resulting\n\nfrom processing at the Thomasville plant,” whereupon “[p]rocessing\n\ncosts may . . . be deducted as an indirect means of determining\n\nwhat a buyer would have paid for the sour gas at the wellhead.”\n\nPiney Woods II, 726 F.2d at 240.         This was the method utilized by\n\nthe district court in the instant case.\n\n     In Piney Woods IV, this Court affirmed the district court’s\n\n\n                                    26\n\fruling rejecting the plaintiffs’ proof for the years 1972-1978 on\n\nthe ground that the proffered proof of comparable sweet gas sales\n\nwas flawed.   Now, however, the district court, relying upon four\n\nlong-term contracts involving the sale of sweet gas processed from\n\nsour gas from Mississippi fields, has derived a mean rate scale\n\ndemonstrative of the “interstate market value” for processed sour\n\ngas.    This index of market value, when juxtaposed to the actual\n\nprices paid under the Shell-MisCoa long-term contract, illustrates\n\nShell’s liability and provides the basis for a calculation of\n\ndamages.\n\n       We affirm the district court’s use of these sales and the\n\n“interstate market value” derived therefrom. These sales contracts\n\nexhibit    geographical,   market    output,   and   gas   quality\n\ncharacteristics markedly similar (and in one case identical) to\n\nthose of the Thomasville facility,17 overcoming the inadequacies in\n\nthe plaintiffs’ showing for the years 1972-1978 which we remarked\n\n17\n     The Shell-MisCoa contract, made in 1972, had a term of 13\nyears, with provisions for extension, and involved the sale of\nsection 105 and section 107 pipeline quality sweet gas processed\nfrom sour gas, with a daily deliverability quota of 40,000 Mcf.\nThe “interstate market value” found by the district court is based\nupon four comparable sales contracts: Amerada Hess-Transco (P-\n136), Pursue-Southern Natural (P-137), Shell-Transco (P-138), and\nTomlinson-Transco (P-139). All of these contracts concern only\nsection 107 pipeline quality gas. The Pursue, Shell, and Tomlinson\ncontracts concern sour gas produced in Rankin County and processed\non site into sweet gas. The Amerada Hess, Shell, and Tomlinson\ncontracts have terms of fifteen years and were entered into between\n1978 and 1982, while the Pursue contract extends for the life of\nthe field. All of the contracts set daily deliverability quotas at\ndifferent levels: Amerada Hess (50,000 Mcf), Pursue (180,000 Mcf),\nShell (54,000 Mcf), Tomlinson (33,500 Mcf).\n\n                                27\n\fupon in Piney Woods IV.    These sales contracts further demonstrate\n\nboth the existence of willing buyers on the interstate market\n\nbetween 1979-1982 and reveal a discernible market price for sweet\n\ngas processed from section 107 sour gas wells producing during this\n\ntime period, i.e., the Spengler, Garrett, Stevens, and Clark wells.\n\nThe district court did not clearly err in its determination of the\n\nmarket value of processed gas.\n\n      However, the determination of the market value of processed\n\ngas is only part of the equation for determining the “market value”\n\nof the Thomasville gas “at the well,” the value on which Shell\n\nshould have computed royalty.    “The method of analysis approved in\n\nPiney Woods II for assessing the market value of Thomasville’s\n\nultra-sour gas at the wellhead by using comparable sweet gas sales\n\nwas to take the price established for the sweet gas market, then\n\ndeduct the processing costs inherent in changing the sour gas to\n\nsweet gas, and thus arrive at the price of sour gas at the\n\nwellhead.”   Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 848.       We have previously\n\nobserved that this formula of sweet gas value-minus-processing\n\ncosts serves as a proxy, “an indirect means of determining what a\n\nbuyer would have paid for the sour gas at the wellhead.”           Piney\n\nWoods II, 726 F.2d at 240.     Accordingly, we have emphasized that\n\nany   consideration   of   Shell’s     processing   costs——which   under\n\nMississippi law as applied to both “amount realized by lessee,\n\ncomputed at the mouth of the well” and “market value at the well”\n\n\n                                  28\n\flease provisions are not deductible as such——is necessitated by the\n\nabsence of comparable sales of sour gas establishing a market (or\n\nactual sales) price for the gas prior to processing.          Id.\n\n       In addition, this Court in Piney Woods II held that only\n\nreasonable processing costs could be considered for such purpose,\n\nnoted that although the district court had not made an express\n\nfinding as to the reasonableness of the processing costs deducted\n\nby Shell, the record would support such a finding, and left that\n\nissue “open for further consideration by the district court.” Id.,\n\n726 F.2d at 241.   Following our Piney Woods II remand, the district\n\ncourt (in Piney Woods III), as we noted in Piney Woods IV, “found\n\nthat Shell’s ‘plant processing’ charges were reasonable.”              Piney\n\nWoods III, 905 F.2d at 843.      Piney Woods IV did not disturb that\n\nfinding.\n\n       Shell’s central argument on appeal challenges the district\n\ncourt’s use of Shell’s actual processing costs in determining the\n\nwellhead value of the gas. Shell argues that this approach ignores\n\nvariables like capital investment, risk, and profit motive, factors\n\nwhich any willing buyer of Rankin County sour gas would have to\n\ntake into consideration before entering into a long-term contract\n\nto process, market, and transport that gas.         Shell also points out\n\nthat   inflationary   factors   have    increased   the   costs   of   plant\n\nconstruction beyond that of the Thomasville facility, built in the\n\nearly 1970s, and posits that insofar as inflation is a factor in\n\n                                   29\n\fincreased market prices during the relevant time frame a variable\n\nshould be introduced to account for an extrapolated increase in\n\ncosts.\n\n      Insofar as Shell claims that “processing costs” are something\n\nother than its actual costs, any proper consideration of that\n\nargument must begin with our foundational opinion in Piney Woods\n\nII.   There we addressed plaintiffs’ challenge to Shell’s practice\n\nof deducting its actual processing costs from its actual tailgate\n\nsales    proceeds   to   determine   royalty   due.   We   rejected   this\n\nchallenge, and sided with Shell, both as to leases (such as the\n\n“Producers 88 (9170)”, see notes 2 & 3 supra) providing for royalty\n\nto be based on the “amount realized by lessee, computed at the\n\nmouth of the well” and as to leases providing for royalty based on\n\n“market value at the well.”      We stated:\n\n      “Expenses incurred after production may be charged\n      against royalty computed ‘at the well’. 3 H. Williams,\n      Oil and Gas Law § 645 (1981). Accordingly, the costs of\n      processing and transportation maybe deducted.\n\n           . . . ‘at the well’ refers not only to the place of\n      sale but also to the condition of the gas when sold. ‘At\n      the well’ means that the gas has not been increased in\n      value by processing or transportation.       It has this\n      meaning in conjunction with ‘value’ or ‘amount realized’\n      as well as with ‘sold’. The lessors under these leases\n      are therefore entitled to royalty based on the value or\n      price of unprocessed, untransported gas. [citation]. On\n      royalties ‘at the well,’ therefore, the lessors may be\n      charged with processing costs, by which we mean all\n      expenses, subsequent to production, relating to the\n      processing, transportation, and marketing of gas and\n      sulphur.\n\n            We emphasize, however, that processing costs are\n\n                                     30\n\f     chargeable only because, under these leases, the\n     royalties are based on value or price at the well.\n     Processing costs may be deducted only from valuations or\n     proceeds that reflect the value added by processing.”\n     Id. at 240 (emphasis added).\n\nWe went on to say:\n\n     “The lessors are entitled to gas royalty at the well.\n     This means royalty based on the value or price of the\n     sour gas before it is separated into marketable\n     constituents. The value or sale price of the residue\n     sweet gas reflects Shell’s processing costs.\n\n          We agree with the plaintiffs that the processing\n     costs,under both the “market value” and “amount realized”\n     provisions, must be reasonable.” Id. at 241 (emphasis\n     added)\n\nAnd, we concluded “[t]o determine the correct basis for royalty,\n\nprocessing and transportation costs may be deducted from values or\n\nprices established for processed and transported gas.” Id. at 242.\n\n     Nothing in our discussion of “processing costs” indicates that\n\nthe “expenses” to which we referred were hypothetical or derivative\n\nin nature; rather, given the nature of the plaintiffs’ challenge,\n\nwe were plainly addressing the processing, transportation, and\n\nmarketing expenses actually incurred by Shell (and actually passed\n\non to the royalty owners)——”Shell’s processing costs.” Furthermore,\n\nthis was applicable to both the “market value” and the “amount\n\nrealized”   lease   provisions.   This   view   is   reinforced   by   our\n\nreliance in the above Piney Woods II passage on the general rule\n\nthat where the lease calls for royalty to be “computed ‘at the\n\nwell’” the “[e]xpenses incurred after production” are deducted.\n\nObviously, this refers to the lessee’s actual expenses (to the\n\n                                  31\n\fextent reasonable), as reflected by the treatise we cited in\n\nsupport of that proposition.         See Williams & Meyers (Martin &\n\nKramer), Oil & Gas Law, § 645.2 (1996 Ed).\n\n     Contrary to the manifest implication of the above referenced\n\nPiney Woods II passages, however, Shell seizes upon one passage\n\nfrom Piney Woods II as a foundation upon which to construct its\n\nargument. Our initial observation is that the passage Shell seizes\n\nupon occurs in Part VIII of that opinion, in which we addressed\n\nShell’s practice      of   disregarding   gas   used   for   plant   fuel   in\n\ncomputing royalty, and not Part VII of the opinion, our discussion\n\nof the propriety of Shell’s deduction of processing costs in\n\ncomputing royalty.         The passage upon which Shell relies, which\n\nfollows   a   brief   discussion    of    the   accounting     methodologies\n\napplicable to the plant fuel question, states:\n\n     “Finally, processing costs are not per se chargeable to\n     market value royalty. They must be reasonable costs, and\n     the market value of sour gas may be more or less in a\n     given time period than the value of the finished products\n     less processing expenses.” Piney Woods II, 726 F.2d at\n     241.\n\n     Shell contends that this statement implies the existence of\n\na “value added” component which is not reflected by the simple\n\nformula of processed gas market value minus actual costs. But such\n\nis not necessarily the meaning of that passage.              The limitation,\n\nwhich we emphasized, that the costs must be “reasonable” suggests\n\notherwise.     Further, it is not clear that “the value of the\n\nfinished products” refers to their market value, as opposed to\n\n                                     32\n\ftheir   sales    proceeds;     if   the     latter,     the   statement   merely\n\nrecognizes that if the “market value” of the gas at the wellhead is\n\ndetermined either by using comparable sales of sour gas or through\n\nthe proxy of comparable sales of sweet gas-less-processing costs\n\nthe result may well differ from the method utilized by Shell in\n\ncomputing royalties, i.e., the actual sales price of processed\n\nThomasville     gas,    “the   value   of   the    finished    products,”   less\n\nprocessing costs.       Moreover, Shell had never actually accounted to\n\nthe lessors for any royalty on gas used as plant fuel, it had\n\nmerely assumed it was “a wash”.           Id. at 241.    We were at that point\n\nunwilling to simply make that assumption, and remanded that matter\n\nto the trial court.       Ultimately, in Piney Woods IV we sustained the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling for Shell on remand in this respect (Piney\n\nWoods III), and we accepted Shell’s contention “that it owes the\n\nroyalty owners nothing [respecting gas used for plant fuel], as the\n\nroyalty payments on plant fuel that would have been due to them are\n\nexactly balanced by the share of the processing costs that are to\n\nbe borne by the royalty owners.”                  Id. 905 F.2d at 856.        We\n\nconcluded “because we find that plant fuel is a processing cost, we\n\nread our Piney Woods II decision as merely ratifying as correct the\n\nexisting course of performance [as to plant fuel] on the royalty\n\ncontract . . .”        Id. 905 F.2d at 857.\n\n     In sum, the two brief above quoted sentences from the part\n\n“VIII. Plant Fuel” portion of our Piney Woods II opinion, which\n\n\n                                       33\n\fShell relies on, do not suffice to overcome the clear thrust of\n\nthat opinion as a whole, namely:         that in the absence of comparable\n\nsales of sour gas, the best method of determining market value at\n\nthe well was to determine the market value of the sweet gas sold by\n\nShell at the Thomasville plant, by examining comparable sweet gas\n\nsales, and then deduct Shell’s actual processing and transportation\n\ncosts applicable to its Thomasville gas, so far as those costs were\n\nreasonable.      Moreover, this is plainly what in Piney Woods IV we\n\ncontemplated the district court would do if, following our remand\n\nthere, it found comparable sales of sweet gas sufficient to reflect\n\nmarket value of the Thomasville sweet gas in years after 1982.\n\n     We further determine that Shell’s evidence presented following\n\nour Piney Woods II remand——no further evidence having been presented\n\nfollowing our Piney Woods IV remand——does not compel a different\n\nconclusion.\n\n     Shell presented the testimony of two expert witnesses who\n\nattempted   to    postulate    the    construction    and    investment   costs\n\ninherent in the processing, transportation, and marketing of sour\n\ngas by considering the construction of a hypothetical on-site\n\nprocessing facility analogous to Shell’s Thomasville facility.\n\nShell’s point was that a willing buyer of the sour gas produced at\n\nthe plaintiffs’ wells would have to construct such facilities in\n\norder to market the gas because no market for unprocessed gas\n\nexists.     The   figures     Shell   used   were    based   upon   a   database\n\n\n                                       34\n\fcontaining information gathered from its worldwide operations and\n\ncomparable information describing other firms’ ventures. The price\n\ntag determined under the Shell model took into account the costs of\n\ninvestment, construction, and inflation, as well as the profit\n\nmotive of a prospective willing buyer, on a recurring annual basis.\n\n     The district court concluded that Shell’s model was fraught\n\nwith supposition and built upon unsubstantiated conjecture.     We\n\nare unable to say that this finding is   clearly erroneous.18\n\n     In sum, nothing in Shell’s “value added” argument convinces us\n\nthat the district court erred in law, or was clearly erroneous, in\n\nconcluding that Shell’s approach would not produce a determination\n\nof the section 107 gas’s market value at the wellhead more precise\n\nthan that made by the district court.      Shell’s recourse to an\n\nincreasingly recondite panoply of databases, charts, and indexes\n\nreeks of the abstruse and arcane, could properly be found to be\n\nsusceptible to manipulation due to its amorphous quality, to resist\n\nempirical validation, and to offer the prospect of interminably\n\nprolonging this twenty-three-year-old case.\n\n     We again reiterate that in Piney Woods II we held that where\n\ncomparable sales of sour gas were not available, the next best\n\n\n18\n     Shell’s actual costs of capital investment (as well as its\nactual operating costs) appear to have been passed on to the\nroyalty owners as processing costs. See Piney Woods II, 726 F.2d\nat 240. What is at stake in this litigation is not compensation\nfor Shell’s investment (and actual operating costs) in the\nThomasville facility, but rather the distribution of hypothetical\nprofits above and beyond those costs.\n\n                                35\n\fmethod of determining market value at the well was to first\n\ndetermine the market value of the Thomasville plant processed gas,\n\nif this could be done by evidence of comparable sweet gas sales,\n\nand then deduct Shell’s actual plant operations and transportation\n\ncosts, to the extent those were not unreasonable.            Nothing in Piney\n\nWoods IV changed that.    And, that is what the district court did.\n\nMoreover, we pointed out in Piney Woods II that “[m]arket value is\n\na question of fact, and it is up to the factfinder to determine the\n\nprobative strength of relevant evidence.”            Id.     726 F.2d at 238.\n\nAnd, we further stated that “ . . . if, on remand, the search for\n\nbetter measures of market value at the well proves unsuccessful or\n\ninordinately burdensome, we think its the duty of the district\n\ncourt to decide the question as best it can on the basis of the\n\nevidence that it presented.”         Id. at 239.    Again, that is what the\n\ndistrict court has done.         Its determinations are not clearly\n\nerroneous or infected by legal error.             Shell’s hypothetical cost\n\ncontentions present no basis for reversal.\n\n     Shell raises two other arguments against the district court’s\n\nimposition of liability. Shell first posits that in Piney Woods IV\n\nwe held it was under no duty to renegotiate its contracts to enter\n\nthe interstate market and thus now cannot be held liable for\n\nfailing to perfect sales contracts commensurate with that market\n\nrate.   Piney   Woods   IV,    905    F.2d   at   854-855.     In    a   related\n\ncontention,   Shell   argues    that    although     its   section       107   gas\n\n\n                                      36\n\ftheoretically could have been sold on the interstate market for\n\ngreater than its section 105/long-term contract prices, it was\n\nunder no obligation to transfer section 107 gas from the intrastate\n\nto the interstate market.         In regard to this latter submission,\n\nShell notes that the regulatory regimes which govern the intrastate\n\nand interstate markets are significantly different and argues that\n\nsuch a difference in “legal quality” militates against the district\n\ncourt’s ruling.\n\n     Regarding Shell’s first point, the Piney Woods IV language\n\nrelied upon by Shell dealt solely with the plaintiffs’ claim that\n\nShell was obligated to renegotiate its long-term contract to obtain\n\nrates more in accord with those prevailing on the interstate\n\nmarket.    In rejecting that contention, we made it clear that we\n\nwere addressing only section 105 gas, for which Shell’s long-term\n\ncontract price as of        November 1978, was also the maximum lawful\n\nprice Shell could charge.        Piney Woods IV, 905 F.2d at 851.          In\n\nother words, we found that section 105 effectively limited the\n\nmarket    for   section    105   gas    to     Shell’s   long-term   contract,\n\nvindicating     Shell’s     actual     sales    price-less-processing-costs\n\nroyalty basis as to gas governed by section 105.              Shell’s present\n\nargument completely ignores our reasoning in vacating and remanding\n\nthe district court’s decision as to 1979-1986, namely the fact that\n\nThomasville section 107 gas was eligible for sale on the burgeoning\n\ninterstate market.        Shell’s failure to renegotiate its long-term\n\n\n                                       37\n\fcontract is essentially irrelevant to a determination of what the\n\nproper “market value” of that section 107 gas was.         Shell’s\n\nsubmission is without merit.\n\n     Shell’s second argument revolves around language excerpted\n\nfrom our discussion in Piney Woods IV concerning Shell’s lack of a\n\nduty to redrill its wells:19\n\n     “In Piney Woods II, id. at 239 n. 17, we quoted from\n     [Exxon v. Middleton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1732153\"><a href=\"/opinion/1732153/exxon-corp-v-middleton/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 246-247 (Tex.\n     1981)], which stated that comparable sales are those made\n     in the same category of a regulated market. Under this\n     method of assessing market value, Shell as lessee must\n     pay royalties on the market price of gas under the\n     existing regulatory scheme governing each well but is not\n     necessarily required to act to change the regulatory\n     scheme to achieve higher prices.” Piney Woods IV, 905\n     F.2d at 855.\n\nShell’s argument in essence adopts the Piney Woods IV principle\n\nthat there is no duty to change the relevant regulatory scheme and\n\napplies it to section 107 gas by attempting to bifurcate the\n\nsection 107 regulatory regime we recognized in Piney Woods IV into\n\nintrastate and interstate components.    The gas we are concerned\n\nwith in this portion of the opinion, however, falls within the\n\nregulatory regime of section 107; unlike section 105 gas, Shell’s\n\nlong-term “intrastate” contract price does not define the upper\n\nreaches of the market for this gas, a fact reflected by the 1982\n\nShell-Transco contract.   Indeed, Shell has cited no statute or\n\n\n\n19\n     Redrilling the section 105 wells to over 15,000 feet in depth\nwould have resulted in those wells being reclassified as section\n107 wells. See note 6, supra.\n\n                                38\n\fregulation, federal or state, which erected any legal barrier to\n\nthe sale of section 107 gas on the interstate market.         This\n\nargument is at its core only another of Shell’s persistent attempts\n\nto define the available market in terms of its long-term contract\n\nrather than by reference to existing comparable contracts, in\n\nderogation of our holding in Piney Woods II.       Accordingly, we\n\nreject it.\n\n     We affirm the judgment of the district court holding that\n\nShell is liable for underpayment of royalty for the years 1979-\n\n1982.\n\n     B.   1983-1984\n\n     The district court found that during this period, beginning in\n\nNovember of 1982, all available section 107 gas was sold to Transco\n\nat an interstate market price.    Thus, Shell’s actual sales price\n\nfor this period reflects the market rate. Neither party challenges\n\nthis holding, and we discern no error in it.      Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court’s judgment absolving Shell of liability for the\n\nyears 1983-1984 is affirmed.\n\n\n\n     C.   1985-1986\n\n     Plaintiffs contend that the district court clearly erred by\n\nfinding that there was no competitive interstate market during this\n\ntime period for section 105 gas deregulated as of January 1, 1985.\n\nPlaintiffs base this contention on the Shell-Transco contract,\n\n\n                                 39\n\fwhich obligated Transco to take up to 54,000 Mcf per day, which was\n\nmore than the Thomasville plant’s 40,000 Mcf per day delivery\n\ncapacity.    The plaintiffs, noting that the district court accepted\n\nthe Transco contract price as the interstate market price during\n\n1983-1984 but abandoned this analysis thereafter, argue that the\n\nadmitted downturn in the interstate market can be tracked by the\n\n“market out” options Transco utilized to reduce its contract price\n\nthroughout this period.\n\n     The    record   reveals   that   due   to   the   interstate   market’s\n\ndownturn after 1982, numerous interstate pipeline corporations,\n\nlike Transco, were refusing to take delivery or pay for gas under\n\nexisting contracts.      Transco in particular markedly reduced its\n\ntakes during this time.        Furthermore, the Shell-Transco contract\n\nwas an “excess volume” contract subject to the preexisting MisCoa\n\ncontract and therefore presupposed the limitation on available gas\n\nresulting from the MisCoa contract.\n\n     The district court’s finding that no additional buyers were\n\npresent on the rapidly fading interstate market after 1982 is\n\nsupported by the record.       The record suggests further that Transco\n\nwas the only viable buyer in that market for the relevant time\n\nperiod.    We agree with Shell that the nature of the Shell-Transco\n\ncontractual relationship is an adequate basis on which the fact\n\nfinder may properly reject, as unduly speculative, any suggestion\n\nthat plaintiffs had shown Transco would have purchased section 105\n\ngas which was freed of the Shell-MisCoa contract. Furthermore, the\n\n                                      40\n\ffact finder could properly take into account that there was no\n\nshowing that had Transco been forced to take all of Thomasville’s\n\n40,000 Mcf output it would not have exercised its “market-out”\n\noption to further reduce the contract price to one nearly identical\n\nto the MisCoa contract rate.         The burden of proving market value\n\nincludes proof of buyers willing to accept available deliveries,\n\nand the district court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that\n\nplaintiffs had failed to carry that burden.                 Finding no clear\n\nerror, we affirm this portion of the district court’s order as\n\nwell.\n\nIII.    Other Matter\n\n       Shell   argues   that   due   to   the   post-1982   downturn   in   the\n\ninterstate market the MisCoa contract price for the years 1982-1986\n\nactually exceeded the interstate market price and therefore Shell\n\nis entitled to equitable recoupment of overages on royalties paid\n\nto the plaintiffs during those years.            Shell bases this argument\n\nupon the proposition that the prices paid by Transco pursuant to a\n\ncontract entered into in 1982 cannot represent the market value in\n\n1983-1986. Shell posits that because the plaintiffs could identify\n\nno new buyers on the interstate market, the market was practically\n\nvalueless and therefore offered rates far below the MisCoa long-\n\nterm fixed rate contract price.\n\n       Assuming arguendo that Mississippi law allows for equitable\n\nrecoupment, see Glantz Contracting Co. v. General Electric Co., 379\n\n\n                                      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miss. 1980), no pleading of record evidences Shell’s\n\nintention to pursue an equitable recoupment theory.

Minn. 1988).\n\nNor does it appear that this theory was proffered in the trial\n\ncourt prior to the district court’s December 1994 issuance of the\n\npreliminary draft of the June 6 order.        Furthermore, we note that\n\nShell’s claim is improperly based essentially upon a dearth in the\n\nplaintiffs’ proof.      In Piney Woods II we set out a hierarchy of\n\nthree   modes   of   analysis   in   determining   what   constitutes   the\n\nrelevant “market value” in this case; given our affirmance of the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that the plaintiffs’ proof of comparable\n\nprocessed sweet gas sales for this post-1982 period fails, the\n\napplicable analysis is by default that of Shell’s actual sales-\n\nminus-processing-costs system.        Had Shell properly counterclaimed\n\nor pleaded recoupment in its answer to plaintiffs’ claim, it could\n\nconceivably have offered evidence of a relevant market where prices\n\nwere less than what Shell actually charged.           No such pleadings\n\nexist, however, and even if they did Shell has not met its\n\npostulated burden of proving up the existence and parameters of\n\nsuch a hypothetical marketplace.          Shell’s claim for equitable\n\nrecoupment fails.\n\n\n                                     42\n\f     Finally, Shell has briefed the issue of whether, due to the\n\ndistrict court’s rulings, it will be necessary and proper on remand\n\nto send notices to those prospective plaintiffs whose claims have\n\nexceeded the jurisdictional amount since the class was originally\n\ncertified.   This question has not yet been ruled on in the district\n\ncourt and is not materially related to any issue presented by the\n\nJune 6, 1995 order we review today.         We therefore have no occasion\n\nto reach the class notice issue at this time.\n\n                                 Conclusion\n\n\n\n     We affirm the district court’s June 6, 1995 order, and hold\n\nthat plaintiffs are entitled to recover from Shell for underpayment\n\nof royalty for the period November 1978 through            November 1982 with\n\nrespect to the section 107 wells.         We approve the comparable sales\n\nevidence   utilized   by   the   district     court   in    determining   the\n\ninterstate market value for processed gas and the propriety of\n\nsubtracting from that market value Shell’s actual processing costs\n\nto determine the market value of the gas “at the well.”              Damages\n\nshall be calculated accordingly, without recoupment or set-off for\n\nany asserted post-1982 overpayment by Shell. We do not have before\n\nus, and do not reach, either the issue of plaintiffs entitlement to\n\nprejudgment interest or the question of whether further notice to\n\nclass members is required.       As to periods after November 1982, we\n\naffirm the district court’s determination that Shell has not\n\n\n\n                                     43\n\funderpaid royalty and is not liable to plaintiffs.\n\n     The district court’s June 6, 1995 order is AFFIRMED, and the\n\ncause is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent herewith.\n\n\n\n\n                               44\n\f</pre>",
