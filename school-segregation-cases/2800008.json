M EYERS, J., joined except for points of error 3\nand 4. K ELLER, P.J., filed a concurring opinion in which M EYERS and K EASLER, JJ.,\njoined. H ERVEY, J., concurred.\n                                      OPINION\n\n       Appellant was originally convicted in 1990 of capital murder for the shooting deaths\n\nof his wife’s mother, father, and brother. Based upon the jury’s answers to the special\n\npunishment issues, the trial judge sentenced him to death. This Court upheld his conviction\n\nand sentence on direct appeal.1 In 2007, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted habeas\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           Coble v. State, 871 S.W.2d 192 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993).\n\f                                                                               Coble    Page 2\n\nrelief and remanded the case for a new trial on punishment.2 On retrial in 2008, a second\n\njury sentenced appellant to death. Appellant raises twenty-five points of error. Finding no\n\nreversible error, we affirm the judgment and sentence.\n\n                                      Factual Background\n\n       Karen Vicha was appellant’s third wife. They were married in July 1988 and lived\n\nin a house down the road from her brother and across the street from her parents. Appellant\n\nwas almost forty years old. The marriage quickly disintegrated,3 and, after a year, Karen told\n\nappellant to move out. She wanted a divorce. Appellant attempted to talk her out of this\n\ndecision and would randomly call her and show up at her work place.\n\n       Appellant then kidnapped Karen as a further effort to dissuade her from divorcing\n\nhim. He hid in the trunk of her car while she was at a bar one evening with a girlfriend.\n\nWhen Karen started to drive home, appellant folded down the back seat and “popped out of\n\nthe trunk with a knife.” He jumped over the console, halfway into the front seat, and stuck\n\nthe knife against Karen’s ribs. He told her to keep driving until they came to a field. Karen\n\nstopped the car, and appellant said that he if couldn’t have her, then no one else could. He\n\npulled out a roll of black electrical tape, but Karen kept talking, and, after about two hours,\n\nshe convinced him that she would reconsider the divorce issue. He let her go, and she called\n\nher brother, Bobby, who was a police officer. Bobby told Karen to report the kidnapping.\n\n\n       2\n           Coble v. Quarterman, 496 F.3d 430 (5th Cir. 2007).\n       3\n         Karen was worried by appellant’s sudden personality switches from calm to aggressive–\n“agitated and angry”–as well as his interest in watching young girls.\n\f                                                                                     Coble     Page 3\n\n       After he arrested appellant for kidnapping Karen, Officer James Head looked in his\n\npatrol-car mirror and saw appellant staring at him with a look that “made the hair on the back\n\nof [his] head stand up.” He got “the heebie-jeebies.” Appellant muttered something like\n\n“They’re going to be sorry.” Officer Head called Karen’s brother, Bobby, and warned him\n\nabout appellant. When appellant was released on bail for the kidnapping charge, Bobby got\n\nKaren a German shepherd for protection. A few days later, appellant told Karen, “Oh, I see\n\nyou–you’ve got a dog now. . . . [T]hat’s a big mean dog you’ve got.” Shortly thereafter,\n\nKaren found the dog lying dead in front of her house.\n\n       Nine days after he had kidnapped Karen, appellant went to her house in the early\n\nafternoon. As Karen’s three daughters each came home from school along with Bobby’s\n\nson,4 appellant handcuffed them, tied up their feet, and taped their mouths closed. Karen’s\n\noldest daughter testified that she heard appellant cut the telephone lines. Then he left to\n\nambush and shoot Karen’s father, mother, and brother Bobby as each of them came home.5\n\n       Appellant returned to Karen’s house after the triple killings and waited for his wife\n\nto come home from work. He told the children, “I wish I had blown you away like I intended\n\n\n       4\n        All four children, ages 16, 14, 11, and 10, testified that they had liked appellant prior to\nthe murders.\n       5\n            Karen’s father, the first victim, was found inside his home, covered with blankets and\ntowels. Karen’s mother was found in her garage. Bobby was found in his car in his garage.\n         Later that day, appellant told Karen that her brother was tough. “He put up one hell of a\nfight. . . . I chased him down the road one way, and I chased him back. And then I shot him, and\nhe was going for the gun in his car. And he wouldn’t die. . . . So, finally I had to blow a hole that\nbig in his neck.” Appellant also told Karen that he “really hated to do that to your mom. But\nwhen she found out about your dad, she just went crazy.”\n\f                                                                                  Coble     Page 4\n\nto.” When Karen arrived, appellant came out of one of the bedrooms with a gun. Appellant\n\nsaid, “Karen, I’ve killed your momma and your daddy and your brother, and they are all dead,\n\nand nobody is going to come help you now.” She didn’t believe him, so appellant showed\n\nher Bobby’s gun lying on the kitchen table and pulled the curtains so she could see her\n\nfather’s truck parked behind the house. He showed her $1,000 in cash that he had taken from\n\nher mother. Appellant told Karen that she was lucky that he hadn’t molested her daughters,\n\nand he told her to kiss them good-bye. She did. He made her put on handcuffs. Karen\n\ntalked appellant into leaving the house and taking her with him.6 He said he was going to\n\ntake her away for a few weeks and torture her.7\n\n       As appellant drove, Karen tried to escape by freeing one hand from the handcuffs and\n\ngrabbing at the steering wheel, making the car swerve into a ditch. She grabbed one of\n\nappellant’s guns, pointed it at his stomach, and pulled the trigger, but nothing happened.\n\nThen Karen and appellant fought over the gun, with appellant repeatedly pulling the trigger,\n\nbut still the gun did not fire. Appellant pistol-whipped Karen until she couldn’t see for all\n\nof the blood on her face. A woman passerby started shouting at appellant, “[W]hat are you\n\n\n       6\n         While Karen and appellant were still at her house, Bobby’s girlfriend dropped by and\nsaw Karen in handcuffs. She then went to Bobby’s house and called Karen’s uncle to tell him\nabout seeing Karen in handcuffs. After that call, she looked around Bobby’s house and saw\nblood everywhere, plants and furniture up-ended, and general disarray. She called the sheriff’s\noffice. Officers then came to Karen’s house, talked to the four children, found the bodies of the\nthree victims, and started the hunt for appellant.\n       7\n          Karen testified that when she came to a court hearing in 1998, appellant kept turning\naround and smiling at her with “a wicked evil grin.” Even in 2008, she was still scared of him\nand felt that he was a continuing threat to her.\n\f                                                                              Coble    Page 5\n\ntrying to do to that woman,” so appellant drove the car out of the ditch as Karen lay in the\n\npassenger seat. He shouted at her that if she got blood on his clothes, he would kill her. But\n\nhe was also rubbing her between her legs as he drove. He told her that his reputation was\n\nruined because she had had him arrested and his name was in the papers.\n\n       He drove to a deserted field in Bosque County where he threatened to rape her. After\n\ndark, he drove out of the field, but they passed a sheriff’s patrol car which turned around to\n\nfollow them. Appellant grabbed a knife and started stabbing Karen’s chin, forehead, and\n\nnose, as he was driving. Appellant said that he did not want to die in prison, so he “floored\n\nit” and rammed into a parked car. After the crash, appellant turned to Karen and said, “I\n\nguess now you’ll get a new car.” Both appellant and Karen were injured in the crash.\n\nOfficers had to cut the car door open to get Karen out. Appellant was found with Karen’s\n\nfather’s watch and wallet, as well as .37 and .38 caliber revolvers.\n\n       Although appellant was forty years old when he committed this triple murder, the\n\nState’s evidence showed that he was no stranger to violence. He had a long history of\n\nbrutalizing and molesting women. Appellant beat both of his former wives and molested\n\nseveral young girls, including relatives.\n\n       His first wife, Pam Woolley, testified that they were married in 1970 when appellant\n\nwas twenty-two. They had two children, but their marriage started downhill after two years.\n\nBy 1974, appellant had become violent, and he used to beat her on the head so that her hair\n\f                                                                                    Coble    Page 6\n\nwould hide the marks. 8 Pam said that appellant could go from normal to extremely angry in\n\na split second, and he always blamed her for his violent acts. Appellant told her that if she\n\never filed for divorce, he would “fix her” so no other man would look at her again.\n\n       During this ten-year marriage, appellant molested Pam’s younger sister and punched\n\nher on the mouth, “busting” her lip. He molested his children’s thirteen-year-old babysitter\n\nwhile teaching her how to water ski. He groped the breast of another neighborhood girl. In\n\n1979, when appellant was thirty, he raped his cousin who was about fifteen at the time.\n\nWhen appellant’s niece was fifteen, he grabbed her ankles as she sat in a chair wearing a\n\nnightgown, spread open her legs, and gestured with his tongue as if he were performing oral\n\nsex on her. Later that same day, he forcibly kissed her and then threw her a $5 bill.\n\n       Appellant married Candy Ryan, his second wife, when he was thirty-five and she was\n\neighteen. After one year of marriage, appellant started physically abusing her. He regularly\n\nhit her on the head. Once he grabbed her by the hair and repeatedly hit her against the\n\ncabinet and floor. After she dared to throw something at him, he hit her with a sledge\n\nhammer. Candy said that appellant had a “switch-type” personality–changing from sweet to\n\nnasty in a split-second. He stalked her, both during and after their marriage. He would sit\n\nin his car outside the gas station where Candy worked, and, if a customer stayed inside too\n\nlong, appellant came in and gave the customer an intimidating look. After Candy left\n\n\n\n       8\n         He also threw a plate at Pam when she cooked something he did not like; he knocked\nher to the floor with an open-hand slap; he hit her on the back with a baseball bat so hard that she\nhad to go the hospital; and he sat on her chest and punched her in the face, breaking her nose.\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 7\n\nappellant, he would call her late at night and tell her where she had been, whom she had been\n\nwith, and what she had been doing. Appellant threatened Candy’s father when he tried to\n\nhelp Candy leave.\n\n       Appellant’s childhood did not augur well for his future. His earliest years were spent\n\nin the custody of an alcoholic stepfather who worked only periodically and a sickly,\n\nwithdrawn, and depressed mother. When appellant was four, his mother was institutionalized\n\nin the Austin State Hospital with a psychoneurotic disorder. Appellant, his brother, and his\n\nolder sister were sent to the Corsicana State Home for Children. Because of her promiscuous\n\nacting-out, appellant’s older sister was sent to a convent school, and his problematic older\n\nbrother was placed under the supervision of the Waco Probation Department. Appellant\n\nremained at the Home for twelve years.\n\n       When appellant was fifteen, a psychiatrist, Dr. Hodges, evaluated him and concluded\n\nthat he was paranoid, distant, and impulsive; he showed poor self-control, displayed hostility\n\nto women, and blamed others for his own bad conduct. Dr. Hodges’s impression was that\n\nappellant “represent[ed] a sociopathic personality disturbance of the dissocial type.” People\n\nwith this diagnosis gratify their own desires without regard for the cost to others. Appellant’s\n\n“long term prognosis [did] not look good.”\n\n       At age seventeen, appellant joined the Marine Corps and was sent to Vietnam.\n\nAlthough he received an honorable discharge after his four-year tour of duty, he was not\n\nrecommended for re-enlistment because of a series of violations and convictions. He married\n\f                                                                               Coble    Page 8\n\nhis first wife shortly after he left the Marines.\n\n       Dr. Richard Coons, a psychiatrist, had testified at appellant’s 1990 trial that he would\n\nbe a future danger. Dr. Coons testified at the 2008 retrial that appellant would still be a\n\nfuture danger even though appellant did not have a single disciplinary report for the eighteen\n\nyears that he had been on death row. Dr. Coons explained this discrepancy by stating that\n\nall those on death row have an incentive to behave because their convictions are on appeal,\n\nand thus they are less violent than they would be in the general prison population.\n\n       Appellant called several witnesses to attest to his prison reformation and lack of\n\nviolence for the entire time that he had been on death row. According to one fellow inmate,\n\nappellant was well liked by everyone; he was always even-tempered and had the ability to\n\n“talk sense” into some of the more violent inmates. He said that appellant had organized a\n\nsports league at the Ellis Unit and that he helped inmates write letters and would read them\n\ntheir letters from family members. After Death Row was moved to the Polunsky Unit,\n\nappellant’s behavior was the same; he was always helpful and upbeat.\n\n       Another inmate testified that appellant would take people “under his wing” and help\n\nthe “agitated” ones. He stated that, while at the Ellis Unit, appellant was an SSI, which was\n\nlike a trustee, and would often walk around with female officers. A third inmate testified that\n\nappellant was generous and gave commissary items to other inmates. A fourth inmate said\n\nthat appellant helped him to learn English and to file a federal habeas petition. Appellant\n\nhelped mentally-retarded inmates and was known for his respect for the law and God.\n\f                                                                                  Coble    Page 9\n\n       Appellant’s older sister testified about their childhood and how appellant changed for\n\nthe worse after coming home from Vietnam. She said that, shortly before the triple murders,\n\nshe saw appellant throwing away many of his most prized possessions, and he began talking\n\nabout his experiences in Vietnam, something he had never done before. On the day of the\n\nmurders, appellant threw his truck keys at her and said that, if anything happened, the truck\n\nwas hers. Appellant’s son testified that appellant taught him welding, and he described his\n\nfather as loving and helpful to others.\n\n       Dr. Cunningham, a forensic psychologist, testified that he had reviewed appellant’s\n\nprison record which contained no disciplinary write-ups. Dr. Cunningham conducted a\n\nviolence risk assessment of appellant. In his opinion, appellant had a very low probability\n\nof committing acts of violence while in prison.\n\n              Sufficiency of the Evidence to Prove Future Dangerousness\n\n       In his first and second points of error, appellant asserts that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the jury’s finding that there is a probability that he would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence in the future. As appellant acknowledges, we have\n\nconsistently held that we lack authority to conduct a factual sufficiency review of the jury’s\n\nfuture-dangerousness verdict.9 Appellant’s arguments do not persuade us otherwise.\n\n       In assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support future dangerousness, we\n\n\n\n       9\n         See McGinn v. State, 961 S.W.2d 161, 169 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998); see also Williams v.\nState, 270 S.W.3d 112, 138 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (“We do not apply a factual-sufficiency\nreview to the jury’s answer to the future-dangerousness special issue.”).\n\f                                                                                 Coble       Page 10\n\n“view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s findings and determine whether\n\nany rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a\n\nprobability that [the defendant] would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute\n\na continuing threat to society.” 10 Only if, after reviewing all of the record evidence, we\n\nconclude that a rational jury would necessarily have entertained a reasonable doubt about the\n\ndefendant’s future dangerousness, will we find that the evidence is legally insufficient.11\n\n       Appellant does not suggest that the evidence of his gruesome triple murder and his\n\nlife-long history of violence toward women and young girls is–viewed in a\n\nvacuum–insufficient to support the jury’s finding. Clearly it is sufficient. Instead, he argues\n\nthat, like Saul on the road to Damascus, he has experienced a character conversion while\n\nspending the last eighteen years in prison with a spotless disciplinary record. He has proven\n\nthat he no longer poses any realistic threat of violence. This is, at first blush, a compelling\n\nargument.\n\n       Appellant notes that he was almost sixty years old and in poor health 12 at the time of\n\nthe present trial. Appellant points to the evidence that shows that he has not merely stayed\n\nout of trouble for eighteen years in prison, but that he has made positive contributions to his\n\nprison society. He worked in the prison garment factory when he was housed in the Ellis\n\n\n       10\n            Berry v. State, 233 S.W.3d 847, 860 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (citation omitted).\n       11\n            Id.\n       12\n          Medical evidence showed that appellant has a history of heart disease, including a heart\nattack in 2004. He takes medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 11\n\nUnit; he helped diffuse potential conflicts by talking “sense” into frustrated inmates; he\n\nformed a prison sports league; he gave commissary items to inmates who did not have\n\nmoney; he helped an inmate learn English and draft legal papers. Dr. Cunningham, his\n\nexpert forensic psychologist, placed appellant in the lowest risk group for violence in prison.\n\nBut, as the prosecutors pointed out, appellant had done many of these same positive things\n\nbefore the murders as well: he coached one of Karen’s daughter’s baseball teams; he fixed\n\nthings around the house; he tended the garden; he praised Karen; he repaired their car; he\n\nhelped organize a school sports banquet. Appellant’s son, Gordon, testified that his father\n\nhelped him with sports and took him fishing and hunting. He taught Gordon welding,\n\nelectrical work, and a good work ethic. He was a very patient teacher and friendly, talkative,\n\nhappy, and helpful to others.\n\n       Appellant agrees with the proposition that “the past is the best predictor of the future,”\n\nand he relies upon a spotless, positive prison record as a realistic predictor of the future.\n\nAppellant concludes that, “[i]n light of [his] age and his prison record, . . . the only rational\n\nfinding in this case is that he would not be a continuing threat to society. For that reason, his\n\nsentence must be vacated.” 13\n\n       This is the same argument that appellant made during the trial, and the jury must have\n\ntaken it seriously because it asked for just three pieces of evidence during its deliberations,\n\nevidence that was directly relevant to this argument:\n\n\n\n       13\n            Appellant’s Brief at 31.\n\f                                                                                 Coble     Page 12\n\n       (1)     Dr. Hodges’s Austin State School psychiatric report from 1964 when appellant\n               was 15. That report stated that appellant seemed paranoid and distant and\n               “extremely hostile to women”; Dr. Hodges’s impression was that “this boy\n               represents a sociopathic personality disturbance of the dissocial type.” 14 He\n               concluded, “The long term prognosis does not look good.”\n\n       (2)     The military medical record from appellant’s 1967 self-inflicted stabbing\n               wound in his thigh after he had a fight with his girlfriend.15 According to the\n               military doctor, appellant “revealed evidence of lifelong maladjustment.” On\n               the hospital ward he was “hostile and belligerent” and only slowly “began to\n               conform to the ward milieu.”\n\n       (3)     The pictures and cards that appellant had in his death row cell. These included\n               numerous pictures of scantily clad young women and girls–young gymnasts\n               and skaters–as well as romantic cards and photographs from a female pen pal.\n\n       14\n          During the psychiatric interview, appellant “talked at some length about [a] fairly\ninvolved series of thefts and many anti-social acts such as stealing the ball bearings out of other\nchildren’s bicycles so the wheels would not roll because he did not have a bicycle.” Appellant\ntold Dr. Hodges about “several thefts and [a] burglary in which he and his brother were suspected\nwhich he never admitted to the police but which he readily told me about during the interview.”\nThe penultimate paragraph of Dr. Hodges’s report reads,\n                [Appellant] seemed rather paranoid, distant, and deliberately non-smiling,\n        as if he must deliberately keep people away from him to avoid the hurt from\n        further rejection and hostility. He said that he did have some friends, but\n        throughout the interview he seemed extremely hostile to women, made very\n        deprecating remarks about them, and in general seemed to have a very low\n        opinion of women. For instance, he told of beating up a young girl in the\n        classroom because she said something smart to him, and he seemed impulsive,\n        had poor controls, a very low self-esteem and he seemed to project a great deal of\n        responsibility for his own actions on other people.\n       15\n         The medical report set out appellant’s explanation for the injury:\n       According to the patient, his fiancée came from Texas so that he and she could\n       become married. He had arrived from Da Nang and had met her and she was in\n       an apartment with another fellow. The patient thought that his fiancée was having\n       an affair with this other fellow and he became so angry and enraged that he\n       threatened to kill him and also threatened to kill his fiancée. He stated that while\n       he was involved in a fight, he picked up a knife and accidentally stabbed himself\n       in the right thigh. His previous story, upon admission, was that he attempted to\n       kill himself and was trying to stab himself in the abdomen and missed, finally\n       stabbing himself in the right thigh.\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 13\n\n\n       The jury had also heard from several different sources about appellant’s mercurial\n\nmoods: one moment calm and sweet, the next moment in a towering rage.16\n\n       The jury also heard evidence that appellant, after all his time on death row, was still\n\nhostile to women. Karen testified that when she appeared for a hearing in 1998, almost ten\n\nyears after appellant’s original conviction, appellant “turned around and watched me sit\n\ndown. And then, after that, he kept turning around and looking at me and grinning.” It was\n\na “weird evil grin.” Karen “called it to the Judge’s attention, and then he told him to stop.\n\nAnd then, he did it again. And [the judge] told him–I think his words were, I have to\n\nadmonish you for that and I’ll have to call you in contempt if you don’t stop it.” According\n\nto Karen, appellant had that same grin when she testified at the 2008 trial.\n\n       Appellant’s attorney explained at trial that, “I’m not saying Bill Coble is a different\n\nperson–okay–than he was in 1989. But you can see that he’s made changes. You can see\n\nthat he has adapted himself to prison environment, that[] he’s adapted himself to institutional\n\nlife. That’s very clear.” That is clear; appellant has adapted very well to prison life, but that\n\nfact, by itself, does not resolve the special issue:\n\n       Is there a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of\n       violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society? 17\n\n\n       16\n          Karen testified that she was really scared when she and appellant were in the Bosque\nCounty field after the murders because appellant would veer from pistol-whipping her and\nthreatening to kill her to wanting to carry her over the brambles in the field so she wouldn’t\nstumble and hurt her bare feet.\n       17\n        T   EX . CODE   CRIM . PROC. art. 37.071, § 2(b)(1).\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 14\n\nThis question is essentially a normative one as the Legislature declined to specify a particular\n\nlevel of risk or probability of violence.18 But the “future dangerousness” special issue\n\nensures that no defendant, regardless of how heinous his capital crime, will be sentenced to\n\ndeath unless the jury finds that he poses a real threat of future violence.\n\n       The special issue focuses upon the character for violence of the particular individual,\n\nnot merely the quantity or quality of the institutional restraints put on that person.19 As we\n\n\n       18\n           See Jurek v. State, 522 S.W.2d 934, 945 (Tex. Crim. App. 1975) (Odom, J., concurring\nand dissenting). As Judge Odom complained, the Legislature declined to specify any particular\nlevel of probability in this special issue:\n                 What did the Legislature mean when it provided that a man’s life or death\n        shall rest upon whether there exists a “probability” that he will perform certain\n        acts in the future? Did it mean, as the words read, is there a probability, some\n        probability, any probability? We may say there is a twenty percent probability that\n        it will rain tomorrow, or a ten or five percent probability. Though this be a small\n        probability, yet it is some probability, a probability, and no one would say it is no\n        probability or not a probability. It has been written: “It is probable that many\n        things will happen contrary to probability,” and “A thousand probabilities do not\n        make one fact.” The statute does not require a particular degree of probability but\n        only directs that some probability need be found. The absence of a specification as\n        to what degree of probability is required is itself a vagueness inherent in the term\n        as used in this issue. Our common sense understanding of the term leaves the\n        statute too vague to pass constitutional muster.\nId. (footnote omitted). But the Supreme Court disagreed with Judge Odom’s constitutional\nconcerns about the vague nature of “a probability” in the special issue. See note 19 infra.\n       19\n         In upholding the Texas death penalty scheme and its special issues in Jurek v. Texas,\n428 U.S. 262 (1976), the United States Supreme Court agreed that it is\n      not easy to predict future behavior. The fact that such a determination is difficult,\n      however, does not mean that it cannot be made. Indeed, prediction of future\n      criminal conduct is an essential element in many of the decisions rendered\n      throughout our criminal justice system. . . . The task that a Texas jury must\n      perform in answering the statutory question in issue is thus basically no different\n      from the task performed countless times each day throughout the American\n      system of criminal justice. What is essential is that the jury have before it all\n      possible relevant information about the individual defendant whose fate it must\n      determine. Texas law clearly assures that all such evidence will be adduced.\n\f                                                                                  Coble    Page 15\n\nrecently stated in Estrada v. State,20 “This Court’s case law has construed the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue to ask whether a defendant would constitute a continuing threat\n\n‘whether in or out of prison’ without regard to how long the defendant would actually spend\n\nin prison if sentenced to life.” 21 That is, this special issue focuses upon the internal restraints\n\nof the individual, not merely the external restraints of incarceration. It is theoretically\n\npossible to devise a prison environment so confining, isolated, and highly structured that\n\nvirtually no one could have the opportunity to commit an act of violence, but incapacitation\n\nis not the sole focus of the Legislature or of our death penalty precedents.22\n\n\nId. at 274-76. Thus, the Supreme Court focused on the particular characteristics of the individual\ndefendant himself, not upon an outside entity to constrain or control the individual defendant. It\ndid not disagree with this Court’s original opinion in Jurek which had suggested possible types of\nevidence that jurors could use in assessing the probability that the defendant would commit\nfuture acts of violence:\n        In determining the likelihood that the defendant would be a continuing threat to\n        society, the jury could consider whether the defendant had a significant criminal\n        record. It could consider the range and severity of his prior criminal conduct. It\n        could further look to the age of the defendant and whether or not at the time of the\n        commission of the offense he was acting under duress or under the domination of\n        another. It could also consider whether the defendant was under an extreme form\n        of mental or emotional pressure, something less, perhaps, than insanity, but more\n        than the emotions of the average man, however inflamed, could withstand.\n522 S.W.2d at 939-40. These are all factors that relate to the individual defendant, not to the\nefficacy of external controls.\n       20\n            313 S.W.3d 274 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n       21\n            Id. at 281.\n       22\n           See, e.g., Druery v. State, 225 S.W.3d 491, 506-07 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (“State has\nthe burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that [the defendant]\nwould commit criminal acts of violence in the future, so as to constitute a continuing threat,\nwhether in or out of prison”); Smith v. State, 898 S.W.2d 838, 846 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995)\n(plurality op.)

Nor did\n\nthe prosecutors at trial try to minimize that record. They noted that appellant has always\n\ndone some good things in his life. The issue, however, is whether he is the same person–with\n\n\n\n\nwhether a defendant represents a continuing threat to society, the term ‘society’ includes both the\nprison and non-prison populations”).\n       23\n            Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 173-74 (2006).\n       24\n          In proving future dangerousness, the State may rely on several factors, including but not\nlimited to: (1) “the circumstances of the capital offense, including the defendant’s state of mind\nand whether he was working alone or with other parties,” (2) “the calculated nature of the\ndefendant’s acts,” (3) “the forethought and deliberateness exhibited by the crime’s execution,”\n(4) “the existence of a prior criminal record, and the severity of the prior crimes,” (5) “the\ndefendant’s age and personal circumstances at the time of the commission of the offense,” (6)\n“whether the defendant was acting under duress or the domination of another at the time of the\noffense,” (7) “psychiatric evidence,” and (8) “character evidence.” Keeton v. State, 724 S.W.2d\n58, 61 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). These factors do not constitute an exhaustive list. Barnes v.\nState, 876 S.W.2d 316, 322 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994). Significantly, these factors do not include\nthe incapacitation capacity or competency of the particular prison system.\n\f                                                                                  Coble     Page 17\n\nthe same character for sudden explosive violence–that he was when he was diagnosed at age\n\n15 as having a “sociopathic personality disturbance of the dissocial type.” Has his character\n\nchanged since he was again diagnosed as having a lifelong history of maladjustment,\n\nbelligerence and violence, when he was hospitalized at the age of 19 after fighting with his\n\nfiancee and stabbing himself in the thigh as a Marine? Was the “evil grin” Karen said that\n\nhe gave her in court when appellant was fifty years old, and then again when he was sixty,\n\nindicative of a continuing animosity and character for brutality toward women? And did the\n\npictures in his death row cell indicate an unnatural interest in young, athletic, scantily clad\n\nwomen for a sixty-year-old man with a heart condition? It was the jury’s duty to assess\n\nappellant’s present character for future dangerousness, and there was ample evidence to\n\nsupport its finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant had not experienced a\n\nconversion on the road to Damascus; rather, he had the same character for violence at age\n\n60 that he did at ages 15, 19, and 40, despite his spotless prison record.25\n\n       The evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury’s finding on the future\n\ndangerousness special issue. We overrule points of error one and two.\n\n                   The Admissibility of Dr. Coons’s Expert Testimony\n\n\n\n       25\n          See, e.g., Blue v. State, 125 S.W.3d 491, 493-96 (Tex.

We agree. In point of error five, appellant asserts that this type\n\nof evidence fails to meet the heightened reliability requirement of the Eighth Amendment,\n\nbut the United States Supreme Court, in Barefoot v.

The Daubert/Kelly Hearing.\n\n       At trial, appellant objected to Dr. Coons’s proposed testimony and requested a\n\nDaubert/Kelly 29 hearing outside the presence of the jury. At that hearing, Dr. Coons testified\n\nthat he is board certified in general psychiatry and has been practicing forensic psychiatry for\n\nthirty-one years. He has evaluated the competency or sanity of between 8,000 to 10,000\n\npeople, has performed 150 evaluations of “future dangerousness,” and has testified in fifty\n\ntrials as an expert.\n\n\n\n       26\n        T EX .

He said that he also relies upon psychiatric principles when he\n\nevaluates defendants for “future dangerousness” for capital murder trials. He repeatedly\n\nstated that “the best predictor of the future is the past” and noted that\n\n       there are certain trends in people who are, in other words, habit patterns or\n       personality patterns that–that we rely on. Um, and then, of course, there’s the\n       experience one has, the training and then the experience that one has in seeing\n       quite a number of people and, uh–uh–watching classifications within various\n       jails and so forth. Uh, those are kind of the principles or the things that are\n       –opinions are based on.\n\nDr. Coons noted that there are some psychiatric diagnoses that are listed in the DSM,30 such\n\nas antisocial personality disorder, that might indicate that a person is dangerous. But in this\n\ncase, Dr. Coons relied on materials supplied by the District Attorney’s Office.\n\n       Dr. Coons explained his standard methodology in assessing the issue of future\n\ndangerousness. For at least the past twenty years he has relied upon several different factors:\n\n       (1)     The person’s history of violence;\n\n       (2)     The person’s attitude toward violence;\n\n       (3)     The particulars of the criminal offense;\n\n       (4)     The person’s personality and general behavior;\n\n       (5)     The person’s conscience; and\n\n       (6)     Where the person will be–in or out of prison.\n\n       30\n       D     IAGNOSTIC AND   STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS.\n\f                                                                              Coble    Page 20\n\nHe assesses these factors based on the information that he has been given. This is his own\n\npersonal methodology. He does not know whether others rely upon this method, and he does\n\nnot know of any psychiatric or psychology books or articles that use his factors. But “[t]hese\n\nare matters that are discussed commonly at–at forensic meetings and among forensic\n\npsychiatrists. . . . [B]ut generally speaking, those are the–are the kinds of things that, uh,\n\nforensic psychiatrists would take into consideration in reaching an opinion.” He doubts that\n\nhis methodology is shared by everyone because different psychiatrists construct their own\n\nmethodologies.\n\n       Dr. Coons stated that multiple psychiatrists would not necessarily agree on what is\n\nimportant in the first factor–looking to past conduct to predict future conduct. “I’m the one\n\nwho’s making the decision–about whether it means something to me in terms of what I–my\n\neducation or experience or background is.” It is a subjective evaluation. When assessing\n\npast violence, Dr. Coons looks at its nature and context.\n\n       The same subjectivity is true for the second factor, a person’s attitude about violence,\n\nas well as the third factor, the circumstances of the offense. Two different psychiatrists may\n\ncome to different conclusions based on the same facts. Dr. Coons said that forensic\n\npsychiatrists develop an experiential body of knowledge and information and approach that\n\nhelps them make their decisions. But Dr. Coons disagreed that it was “just a gut feeling.”\n\n       When it comes to the fourth factor of personality and behavior, Dr. Coons looks to\n\nwhether the crime was an aberration or whether that person has had a problem looking out\n\f                                                                                 Coble    Page 21\n\nfor other people. Is he controlling? Manipulative? With the fifth factor, “conscience is\n\ninvolved in–in helping people control their behavior. And, I mean, really, I guess almost\n\neverybody knows that.” There is no yardstick to measure it. With the final factor, Dr. Coons\n\nstated that if the person is on death row he will be less violent because “everybody that’s on\n\ndeath row is on appeal by definition. And they tend to be on their good behavior. Uh,\n\nbecause if they–on their bad behavior and they get another trial or punishment, they uh–they\n\nknow they’ll hear about it again. Their violence on death row or threats or whatever.” 31\n\n       All of these factors overlap and blend, but Dr. Coons knows of no book or article that\n\ndiscusses these factors or their overlap. He is not aware of any studies in psychiatric journals\n\nregarding the accuracy of long-term predictions into future violence in capital murder\n\nprosecutions or of any error rates concerning such predictions. Nor is he aware of any\n\npsychiatric studies which support the making of these predictions. Dr. Coons has never gone\n\nback and obtained records to try to check the accuracy of the “future dangerousness”\n\npredictions he has made in the past. He cannot tell what his accuracy rate is.\n\n       On redirect, the prosecutor asked Dr. Coons to read from a legal brief containing the\n\nnames and titles of some articles on future dangerousness that had been filed in a different\n\ncase, but Dr. Coons was not familiar with any of those articles.\n\n\n\n       31\n           Dr. Coons admitted that there is no objective way of differentiating between the two\nlocations, death row versus general population, “[j]ust logic. . . . I think if you took a thousand\npsychiatrists and presented that to them, most people would say they have motivation to be on\ntheir better behavior if they’re on death row.” But Dr. Coons stated that there is no objective way\nof proving that proposition and he knows of no studies that support that theory.\n\f                                                                                 Coble    Page 22\n\n       Based on this testimony, the trial judge found that Dr. Coons qualified as an expert\n\nwitness, that the subject matter of his testimony was an appropriate one for experts, and “that\n\nadmitting the expert testimony will actually assist the factfinder in deciding this case.”\n\n       Dr. Coons then testified before the jury and, in response to a lengthy hypothetical\n\nsetting out the salient features of appellant’s life and crimes, opined that there was a\n\nprobability that appellant would commit future acts of violence.\n\nB.     Legal Principles Concerning the Admission of Expert Psychiatric or\n       Psychological Testimony Concerning Future Dangerousness.\n\n       The admission of expert testimony is reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion.32\n\nHowever, trial judges must act as a true “gatekeeper” when addressing the reliability and\n\nrelevance of expert testimony.33 In Daubert, the United States Supreme Court held that when\n\nthe subject of the expert’s testimony is “scientific knowledge,” the basis of his testimony\n\nmust be grounded in the accepted methods and procedures of science.34 As that court\n\nexplained,\n\n       [I]n order to qualify as “scientific knowledge,” an inference or assertion must\n       be derived by the scientific method. Proposed testimony must be supported by\n       appropriate validation–i.e., “good grounds,” based on what is known. In short,\n\n       32\n         Lagrone v. State, 942 S.W.2d 602, 616 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (“[T]he trial court’s\njudgment regarding experts’ qualifications and the admissibility of expert testimony is subject to\nan abuse of discretion standard of review.”).\n       33\n          Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 589-92 (1993); see also\nKumho Tire v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 147 (1999) (“gatekeeping” role assigned to trial judges\nunder Daubert applies the same reliability standard to all “scientific,” “technical,” or “other\nspecialized” matters within the scope of Rule 702).\n       34\n            Daubert, 509 U.S. at 589-90.\n\f                                                                                    Coble     Page 23\n\n       the requirement that an expert’s testimony pertain to “scientific knowledge”\n       establishes a standard of evidentiary reliability.35\n\nFour “general observations” guide the inquiry into scientific reliability: (1) falsifiability; (2)\n\npeer review and publication; (3) the existence of methodological standards, including the\n\nerror rate; and (4) general acceptance within the relevant scientific field.36 The goal of these\n\n“flexible” guidelines is to evaluate the admissibility of expert testimony by the standards that\n\ncomparable experts within the same scientific field use in evaluating each other’s\n\nprofessional work.37\n\n       In Kelly v. State,38 this Court adopted several procedural and substantive limitations\n\nupon the admission of expert scientific testimony to ensure that unreliable expertise would\n\nbe excluded from the jury’s consideration.39 Under Kelly, a trial judge must, upon request,\n\nconduct a “gatekeeping” hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether\n\nscientific evidence is sufficiently reliable 40 and relevant41 to help the jury in reaching an\n\n\n       35\n            Id. at 590.\n       36\n            Id. at 593-94.\n       37\n            See id.\n       38\n            824 S.W.2d 568 (Tex.

Then the judge must decide whether, on balance, that expert testimony might\n\nnonetheless be unhelpful or distracting for other reasons.42 To be considered reliable,\n\nevidence from a scientific theory must satisfy three criteria: “(a) the underlying scientific\n\ntheory must be valid; (b) the technique applying the theory must be valid; and (c) the\n\ntechnique must have been properly applied on the occasion in question.” 43 The trial court’s\n\nessential gatekeeping role is to ensure that evidence that is unreliable because it lacks a basis\n\nin sound scientific methodology is not admitted.44\n\n       Forensic psychiatry is certainly a science;45 as Dr. Coons stated, it is practiced solely\n\n\n\n        technique;\n(4)     The potential error rate;\n(5)     The availability of other experts to test and evaluate the technique;\n(6)     The clarity with which the underlying scientific theory and technique can be explained to\n        the court; and\n(7)     The experience and skill of the person who applied the technique in this case.\nId. at 573.\n       41\n           In Jordan v. State, 928 S.W.2d 550, 553-54 n.4 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996), we discussed\nthe “relevance” prong of the gatekeeping analysis as the closeness of the “fit” between the\nscientific evidence and the fact to which it is offered. “Whether evidence ‘will assist the trier of\nfact’ and is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case is a simpler, more straight-forward matter to\nestablish than whether the evidence is sufficiently grounded in science to be reliable.” Id. at 555.\n       42\n            Kelly, 824 S.W.2d at 572.\n       43\n            Id. at 573.\n       44\n            Hartman v.

Gutheil, LEGAL ISSUES IN\nPSYCHIATRY , IN COMPREHENSIVE TEXTBOOK OF PSYCHIATRY /VI 2747 (Harold I. Kaplan &\nBenjamin J. Sadock eds., 1995). The official definition of forensic psychiatry, promulgated by\nthe American Board of Forensic Psychiatry and adopted in the Ethical Code of the American\nAcademy of Psychiatry and the Law, is “a subspecialty of psychiatry in which scientific and\n\f                                                                                     Coble    Page 25\n\nby those with a medical degree.46 It may be a “soft science,” but trial courts, in their\n\ngatekeeping function, must ensure that the expertise is not only soft, but that it is science as\n\nwell.47 “Soft” science does not mean soft standards.48 When “soft” sciences are at issue, the\n\ntrial court must inquire “(1) whether the field of expertise is a legitimate one, (2) whether the\n\nsubject matter of the expert’s testimony is within the scope of that field, and (3) whether the\n\nexpert’s testimony properly relies upon and/or utilizes the principles involved in the field.” 49\n\n       This inquiry is somewhat more flexible than the Kelly factors applicable to Newtonian\n\n\n\nclinical expertise is applied in legal contexts involving civil, criminal, correctional, regulatory or\nlegislative matters, and in specialized clinical consultations in areas such as risk assessment or\nemployment. These guidelines apply to psychiatrists practicing in a forensic role.” Ethics\nGuidelines for the Practice of Forensic Psychiatry (Am. Acad. Psychiatry & L. May 2005).\n       46\n          There is some empirical evidence that jurors tend to rate medical expertise higher than\n“mere” scientific evidence, such that when the information is identical, jurors rate the testimony\nfrom a psychiatrist, a medical doctor, as more persuasive than that from a psychologist. See J.\nGreenberg & A. Wursten, The Psychologist and the Psychiatrist as Expert Witnesses: Perceived\nCredibility and Influence, 19 PROF. PSYCHOL. RES. & PRAC. 373, 378 (1988).

Those three\ncases have significantly altered the evidentiary threshold requirements of reliability and relevance\nof any expert’s testimony, including psychiatric or psychological expertise. Some have criticized\nthe courts for failing to apply the standards set out in Daubert and Kelly to psychiatric testimony\noffered to prove future dangerousness in capital sentencing. See, e.g., Flores v.

It is as true today as it was in 1983 that ‘[n]either the Court nor the\nState of Texas has cited a single reputable scientific source contradicting the unanimous\nconclusion of professionals in this field that psychiatric predictions of long-term future violence\nare wrong more often than they are right.’ . . . On the basis of any evidence thus far presented to a\ncourt, it appears that the use of psychiatric evidence to predict a murderer’s ‘future\ndangerousness’ fails all five Daubert factors. . . .

And have the predictions\n\nbased upon those factors been verified as accurate over time? 67 Some of Dr. Coons’s factors\n\nhave great intuitive appeal to jurors and judges,68 but are they actually accurate predictors of\n\nfuture behavior? Dr. Coons forthrightly stated that “he does it his way” with his own\n\nmethodology and has never gone back to see whether his prior predictions of future\n\ndangerousness have, in fact, been accurate. Although he had interviewed appellant before\n\nthe first trial in 1990, Dr. Coons had lost his notes of that interview in a flood and apparently\n\nhad no independent memory of that interview. He relied entirely upon the documentary\n\n\nby Dr. Coons about appellant, and it may be a valid assessment of a person who would likely be\n“dangerous” in the future, but there is nothing in this record that shows Dr. Coons relied upon the\nprinciples and methodology of Dr. Kozol or his colleagues.\n       67\n          “One study of capital murderers commuted as a result of the Furman decision found\nthat 188 murderers were paroled by the end of 1987, serving an average of 5.3 years in the\noutside community. Only one killed again, for a rate of .1% committing repeat homicides per\nyear. Six of the 188 committed violent offenses, resulting in a violent recidivism rate of .6% per\nyear.” Jonathan R.

One does not know whether any psychiatric expert predicted that some or all of these\ncapital murderers would constitute a future danger.\n       68\n          If these factors are not scientifically appropriate ones for predicting future violence,\nthen their intuitive appeal is doubly dangerous as the jury might accept such testimony\nuncritically. See Flores v. Johnson, 210 F.3d 456, 465-66 (5th Cir. 2000) (Garza, J., concurring)\n(“[T]he problem here (as with all expert testimony) is not the introduction of one man’s opinion\non another’s future dangerousness, but the fact that the opinion is introduced by one whose title\nand education (not to mention designation as an ‘expert’) gives him significant credibility in the\neyes of the jury as one whose opinion comes with the imprimatur of scientific fact.”); see also C.\nRobert Showalter & Richard J.

And, as noted\n\nabove, it was some of that independent evidence that the jury requested to see during its\n\ndeliberations. First, the psychiatric interview and evaluation done by Dr. Hodges more than\n\ntwenty years before the offense and forty years before the trial reached the same basic\n\nconclusion as Dr. Coons did concerning appellant’s character and his animosity toward\n\nwomen. Dr. Hodges’s 1964 interview and clinical evaluation was completed long before any\n\npossible motive to view the facts and events of appellant’s later life through any “future\n\ndangerousness” litigation prism had arisen. Expertise that is developed entirely independent\n\n\n\n       80\n         See C. Robert Showalter & Richard J.

We have often held that erroneously admitting evidence\n\n“will not result in reversal when other such evidence was received without objection, either\n\nbefore or after the complained-of ruling.” 82 Although neither Dr. Hodges nor the military\n\ndoctor specifically opined on whether there was a probability in 2008 that appellant would\n\n\n\n\n       81\n             See FED .

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1317 (9th Cir. 1995)). As the\nNinth Circuit explained,\n         That an expert testifies based on research he has conducted independent of the\n         litigation provides important, objective proof that the research comports with the\n         dictates of good science. For one thing, experts whose findings flow from\n         existing research are less likely to have been biased toward a particular conclusion\n         by the promise of remuneration; when an expert prepares reports and findings\n         before being hired as a witness, that record will limit the degree to which he can\n         tailor his testimony to serve a party’s interests. Then, too, independent research\n         carries its own indicia of reliability, as it is conducted, so to speak, in the usual\n         course of business and must normally satisfy a variety of standards to attract\n         funding and institutional support.\nId.

Both\n\nawards were for his research concerning factors that predict violence in prison and his\n\nresearch in capital sentencing. He is also among the 2,000-3,000 psychologists elected as a\n\nFellow of the APA out of the 155,000 members. He has published a significant number of\n\npeer-reviewed studies and articles. He testified, with a PowerPoint slide presentation to\n\nillustrate,83 about the violence risk assessment factors that he uses to assess the probability\n\nof future dangerousness in prison. His factors are based on research data from prisons, as\n\nwell as other research and scholarly writings. He explained how his research is “scientific,”\n\nreplicable, and less subjective: “It’s not based on my gut feeling about something. It’s based\n\non what the data tells me. And so, it’s accurate. It’s reliable.”\n\n       After explaining the various studies, data, and statistical analysis, Dr. Cunningham\n\n\n\n\n       83\n           His slides included statistical charts and numerous references to comprehensive\nscientific articles.\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 40\n\nconcluded that appellant fell within the lowest risk-of-violence category.84 He criticized “the\n\nhypothetical inference” mode of predicting future dangerousness as\n\n       entirely speculative. . . . That’s just blind guessing unless those factors have\n       been demonstrated to be predictive of violence in prison. Critically important.\n       . . . That’s the problem with not knowing the literature, without knowing\n       anything about the scientific studies that have been done in this area is then\n       you have no idea whether the factors that you’re looking at are predictive of\n       anything or not.\n\nAccording to Dr. Cunningham, if “what you’re doing is basing it on your own gut and you\n\nhaven’t done anything to check whether your gut reaction is correct or not, then your\n\naccuracy level never improves.”\n\n       He pointed to appellant’s first trial as an example of the “tea-leaf-reader” school of\n\nsubjective clinical assessments. In that trial, Dr. James Grigson,85 who used the same\n\n\n       84\n           The American Psychiatric Association’s 1974 Task Force report concluded,\n        Predictions of “dangerousness” are judgments of a “relative risk” sort, statements\n        of comparative probabilities that are usually quite low. All that may be\n        reasonably concluded in most cases is that in the clinician’s experience, and from\n        his knowledge of the literature, some persons are at a comparatively higher risk\n        for future violence than are others.\nAPA Task Force Report, supra note 63 at 31. As Judge Johnson has noted in this same context,\n        A probability that a single individual will engage in a given behavior does not\n        exist. The probability that does exist is the likelihood that a person like that\n        individual will engage in a given behavior. . . . The proceedings in capital trials\n        are on much more stable ground if the future-dangerousness witnesses are\n        questioned about the probability of future violence by a person who is like the\n        defendant in, for example, background, criminal history, mental status, and\n        demonstrated propensity for violence against others.\nAllen v. State, No. AP-74,951, 2006 WL 1751227, *9 (Tex. Crim. App. June 28, 2006) (not\ndesignated for publication) (Johnson, J., concurring).\n       85\n          Dr. Grigson was nicknamed “Dr. Death” by the media and was one of the two\npsychiatrists whose “future dangerousness” testimony was at issue in Barefoot v. Estelle, 463\nU.S. 880 (1983); see Mines v. State, 852 S.W.2d 941, 949 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992).\n\f                                                                                  Coble    Page 41\n\nsubjective methodology as Dr. Coons, testified that, in his opinion, appellant posed no risk\n\nof future violence: “[H]e said, the ladies and gentlemen of the jury are more likely to kill\n\nsomebody in the future” than appellant. Dr. Coons, using that very same methodology and\n\nfacts concerning appellant, came to exactly the opposite conclusion.86 Dr. Cunningham also\n\ntold the jury that the major psychological associations had criticized Dr. Coons and his\n\nmethodology as “unreliable and inconsistent with the standard of practice.” In sum, Dr.\n\nCunningham refuted Dr. Coon’s expertise and the whole “tea-leaf-reader” notion of clinical\n\npsychiatric predictions of future dangerousness.\n\n       Furthermore, the prosecution did not rely heavily upon Dr. Coons’s testimony during\n\nits closing arguments. Instead, the prosecutor emphasized his position that appellant was\n\nexactly the same person that he was when he killed Karen’s parents and her brother back in\n\n1989. He had not changed a bit.87 The prosecutor then went on to recount evidence from the\n\n\n       86\n         Dr. Cunningham concluded,\n       Both of those represent absurd unreliable conclusions based on a completely\n       unreliable method. That’s the benefit of using a subjective unreliable method is\n       whatever case you go into you can say whatever you want, because it’s based on\n       reading tea leaves.\n       87\n          The prosecutor’s theory was that “[t]his is the same person 20 years later exactly.\nThere is no difference.” He explained,\n       The evidence in this case, the evidence presented to you from the witness stand\n       here and testified to shows that he has no remorse. He had no remorse on August\n       29, 1989, when he individually killed three people and then kidnapped Karen\n       Vicha and told her all about what he’d done. He had no sorrow in that at all. And\n       he–he simply–he doesn’t have it. It’s not here. It’s not within him. And what did\n       he do later after the unspeakable horror that he inflicted on her? There was a\n       hearing in this court ten years later and she was sitting out there in the audience.\n       This man turned and was glaring at her, giving her an evil smile ten years later\n       after slaughtering her family and giving her heartache that lasts for a life. He’s\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 42\n\nmurders themselves and appellant’s bragging to Karen afterwards. The prosecutor then\n\nturned to the topic of predicting future dangerousness:\n\n               Can we predict a person’s future? Well, we absolutely can. You heard\n       what Dr. Hodges said. He made an analysis of it. He talked about how he had\n       a dislike of women, how he had a low opinion of them. Did he? His conduct\n       was absolutely borne out. And Dr. Hodges said the prognosis is poor, and it\n       was, because this person ultimately cares only about himself.\n\nHe then recounted how Bobby’s fellow officer had predicted that appellant would commit\n\nsome violent act after he had been arrested for kidnapping Karen before the murders. He\n\nthen turned briefly to Dr. Coons:\n\n       Dr. Coons examined–first he talked to [appellant] personally before the first\n       trial in 1990. He interviewed him, then he gave his assessment of him. And\n       the assessment is–sure, you deal with medical predictions and the training of\n       psychiatrists–but it’s just common sense. If you don’t have a conscience and\n       you’ve committed dangerous violent acts and you’ve shown that you have no\n       regard for human beings in any form unless it’s something that serves you, of\n       course, there’s a probability that you will commit criminal acts of violence.\n\nThe prosecutor then referred to appellant’s expert psychologist, Dr. Cunningham, and how\n\n\n\n       grinning at her. Is that any remorse? Ten years later he’s the same person that did\n       the killing.\n                And then in the courtroom during the trial last week, she told you that\n       when she–after she burst into tears and was sobbing and looked at him, as you\n       saw her do, he gave her the same smile. I got you. I hurt you. Folks, this is the\n       same man that committed those murders.\n                What’s another thing we can prove? He has the same unnatural\n       attachment to young girls that he did when he was out in the free world molesting\n       them. You’ve heard that testimony. You’ve heard what he did. There’s no\n       questioning the evidence about that. And so now, what does he do in his jail cell?\n       He’s got pictures of–not pinups of 30-year-old women from Playboy. He’s got\n       pictures of young girls in various gymnast positions. He is the same person that\n       was a molester and a murderer back on August 29, 1989.\n\f                                                                                  Coble     Page 43\n\nhe had called Karen biased for saying that appellant twice gave her an evil grin in two\n\ndifferent court appearances. The prosecutor then returned to his theme of appellant’s lack\n\nof conscience and how he had simply been restrained, not changed, in prison.\n\n       The defense, in its closing argument, quickly focused on the future dangerousness\n\nissue as well. Counsel argued that the statistical evidence that Dr. Cunningham had\n\npresented made it very difficult for the prosecution to prove that appellant would commit\n\nfuture acts of violence. He compared the two experts:\n\n       I want to talk about Dr. Coons versus Dr. Cunningham, because it really does\n       sort of come down to Dr. Coons versus Dr. Cunningham. Dr. Coons is a\n       likable guy. Dr. Coons does an excellent job of testifying. He seems to have\n       a lot of horse sense. Okay. He seems to have a lot of common sense. That’s\n       totally true. Dr. Cunningham is extremely long-winded. Okay. He has a hard\n       time sort of answering a question directly. I recognize those facts. But that’s\n       because he is a scientist.88 All right. And Dr. Cunningham talked about being\n       a scientist and what that means. What that means is, I don’t just look at the\n       evidence and make a wild guess. Okay. I’m not a tea-leaf reader. I’m not a\n       guy who says, well, I’m just going to depend on my–my experience and say\n       this person is a future danger–okay–without going back and checking my\n       work, without quantifying things, without being able to say, you know, I’m\n       correct to this certain quantum of correctness. . . . So he’s a scientist. A\n       scientist comes up with an idea, a theory. Okay. He tests that theory. He\n       doesn’t just test the theory, but he also gives his data to other scientists to look\n       at, so they can test his theory. Then he goes back and double-checks his work.\n       Then he thinks, now, maybe there’s a weakness in my own argument that I’ve\n       already made. Let’s go back and double-check that weakness and see it that\n       changes our numbers or does that reinforce our numbers. All right. So that’s\n       what a scientist is supposed to do.\n                Do you remember Dr. Coons’s testimony? Dr. Coons, do you check\n\n\n       88\n         Defense counsel had already explained why he had called Dr. Cunningham: “Because\nDr. Cunningham is the leading scientist in this field. All right. Out of every scientist who is\nlooking at these numbers, out of every scientist who is studying this issue, he’s the leading guy.”\n\f                                                                               Coble    Page 44\n\n       your work? Not really. Dr. Coons, do you remember going back and looking\n       at the records of people that you have predicted are going to be a future danger\n       to see if they really were? Well, I’m sure I’ve done it, but I can’t tell you who\n       I’ve done it with. In other words, he’s a guy who is completely uninterested\n       in whether he’s correct or not. . . .\n               . . . How can he ever get better? How can he establish for the jury that\n       his opinion is reliable? He can’t because he’s not a scientist. He’s a tea-leaf\n       reader.\n\n       The defense then recapped Dr. Cunningham’s testimony which had been that appellant\n\nposed an extremely low risk of committing future acts of violence because (1) he is well-\n\nadjusted to institutional life; (2) he is sixty years old and thus has “aged out” of his violent\n\nyears; (3) he has performed many positive acts and developed a positive attitude toward\n\nfellow inmates; (4) he is serving a very long sentence and “40 years of tests” show that long-\n\nterm inmates are statistically less likely to commit acts of aggression than are “short-\n\ntermers;” (5) he has a GED and additional work certificates; and (6) he has continuing family\n\nties to the community. All of these factors are supported by “the numbers that exist in reality.\n\nThese are the official numbers. So he’s not making up the numbers. He’s a scientist. He’s\n\njust reporting what the data is.”       The defense concluded its discussion of “future\n\ndangerousness,” with the statement that “Dr. Cunningham’s conclusions are very appropriate\n\nand very reasonable and scientific and provable as opposed to Dr. Coons’s conclusions,\n\nwhich are nonscientific and not provable. Okay. And even if they were provable, he hasn’t\n\nbothered to go out and try to prove them.” Counsel then moved on to the mitigation issue\n\nand appellant’s miserable childhood and youth.\n\n       During his final argument, the prosecutor mentioned Dr. Coons very briefly by\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 45\n\nreminding the jury that another psychiatrist, Dr. Hodges, had talked to appellant back in 1964\n\nand “he looked at him and listened to his answers” and reached the conclusion that appellant\n\nwas “extremely hostile to women, very low opinion of women, has poor control, very low\n\nself-esteem. Projects a great deal of responsibility for his own actions on other people. It\n\nwas Karen’s fault that she got kidnapped. It was Karen’s fault because she stood up to him.\n\nAnd it ruined his life. So it was her fault. And he had to extract revenge on her and he did\n\nit in the most brutal, the most selfish way he possibly could.” The prosecutor then referred\n\nto the military doctor’s assessment from 1967, with both doctors reaching the “same common\n\nsense assessment” of appellant.\n\n       Based upon the complete record of this case, we find that the error in admitting Dr.\n\nCoons’s testimony did not affect appellant’s substantial right to a fair sentencing hearing\n\nbecause\n\n(1)    There was ample other evidence supporting a finding that there was a\n       probability that appellant would commit future acts of violence;89\n\n       89\n          See Motilla v. State, 78 S.W.3d 352, 356-57 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (reiterating that\n“overwhelming evidence” of guilt is one consideration in deciding whether improper admission\nof evidence was harmful in a particular case); Sanne v. State, 609 S.W.2d 762, 773-74 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1980) (erroneous admission of expert opinion testimony by forensic pathologist\nconcerning “future dangerousness” in capital murder trial was harmless even under constitutional\nharmless error rule because there was ample evidence of defendant’s prior criminal acts of\nviolence and facts of capital murder; other evidence demonstrated defendant’s “antisocial\npersonality” and thus “the minds of an average jury would not have found the State’s case (on the\nsecond punishment issue) less persuasive” had witness’s testimony been excluded) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); Redmon v. State, 828 P.2d 395, 400 (Nev. 1992) (erroneous\nadmission of “highly unreliable” psychiatric evidence of “future dangerousness” in capital\nmurder trial was harmless because record contained “plentiful other evidence from which [the\nfactfinder] could reasonably infer appellant’s future dangerousness”), overruled on other grounds\nby Alford v. State, 906 P.2d 714 (Nev. 1995).\n\f                                                                                  Coble    Page 46\n\n(2)    The same basic psychiatric evidence of appellant’s character for violence was\n       admissible and admitted, without objection, through other, entirely objective,\n       independent medical sources–the reports by Dr. Hodges and the military doctor\n       years before appellant committed these murders;90\n\n(3)    Dr. Coons’s opinion was not particularly powerful, certain, or strong;91 his\n       opinion, coming after an extremely long and convoluted hypothetical was\n       simply that “there is a probability that” appellant would be a continuing threat\n       to society by committing criminal acts of violence;\n\n(4)    Dr. Coons’s testimony was effectively rebutted and refuted by Dr.\n       Cunningham, who not only relied upon specifically listed scientific materials\n       and data during his testimony, but who also noted that Dr. Coons and his\n       methodology had been criticized by both the American and Texas\n       Psychological Associations; and\n\n(5)    The State barely mentioned Dr. Coons during closing argument and did not\n       emphasize him or his opinions.\n\nGiven these particular circumstances, we conclude that the error in admitting Dr. Coons’s\n\ntestimony did not have a “substantial and injurious” effect upon the jury’s deliberations\n\nconcerning the future dangerousness special issue.92 We therefore overrule points of error\n\n\n       90\n            See Leday v. State, 983 S.W.2d 713, 718 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).\n       91\n           Compare Cook v. State, 821 S.W.2d 600, 602 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (given its\nstrength and character, admission of psychiatrist’s testimony was harmful error; expert (1)\ntestified that defendant had “an antisocial personality disorder termed sociopath”; (2) opined that\ndefendant “certainly will, from a medical psychiatric standpoint probability, continue to behave\nand act in a way that does represent a very serious threat to the people within our society”; and\n(3) concluded that defendant would be an “‘extremely severe’” threat to others: “‘You can’t\ncome any more severe than that. If I had the least doubt, if I had any question in my mind, I\ncertainly would not mind telling you that. I feel absolutely one hundred percent certain that he is\nand will continue to be a threat no matter where he is.’”).\n       92\n          See King v. State, 953 S.W.2d 266, 271-73 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (harmless error in\nerroneous admission of hearsay disciplinary reports; reports “did not have a substantial or\ninjurious influence on the jury’s decision” concerning future dangerousness special issue because\n(1) properly admitted evidence showed an escalating pattern of disregard for the law; (2) the\n\f                                                                                  Coble    Page 47\n\nthree, four, and five.\n\n                      The Admissibility of A.P. Merillat’s Testimony\n\n       In his sixth point of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred in admitting the\n\ntestimony of A.P. Merillat, an investigator for the Special Prosecution Unit, about the Texas\n\nprison classification system and violence in prison. Appellant argues that: (1) Mr. Merillat’s\n\ntestimony was irrelevant as it did not relate to appellant personally, and (2) this witness\n\ntestified to information that was already common knowledge among jurors. The State argues\n\nthat Mr. Merillat’s rebuttal testimony was relevant to refute Dr. Cunningham’s statistical data\n\nand to impeach the accuracy of his “low risk” future dangerousness prediction.93 We agree\n\nthat Mr. Merillat’s testimony was admissible as rebuttal “educator-expert” evidence.\n\n       On voir dire, Mr. Merillat stated that his testimony is based on his specialized\n\nknowledge of Texas prisons and prison violence during his nineteen years as a criminal\n\ninvestigator with the Special Prosecution Unit. He proposed to testify concerning the under-\n\nreporting of prison violence in official data compilations, the prison classification system,\n\nand the opportunities for violence inside prison.\n\n       The trial judge allowed Mr. Merillat’s testimony, although he granted appellant’s\n\nmotion in limine to avoid mention of any specific instances of misconduct by other inmates\n\n\noffense itself was particularly brutal; (3) after the murder, the defendant bragged that he would\nkill again; and (4) the State did not emphasize the documents during closing argument).\n       93\n          In the trial court, the State noted, “We have all of these statistics that Dr. Cunningham\nrelied upon and we have a right to show that there’s a substantial reason to believe that they may\nbe inaccurate.”\n\f                                                                                    Coble     Page 48\n\nexcept for one anecdote concerning an inmate’s forced starvation death which served as “a\n\ngreat example for underreporting of violence.”\n\n       Mr. Merillat then testified before the jury about the inmate classification system and\n\nthe under-reporting of violence in prison. He also described administrative segregation and\n\nhow it is used as “punitive housing” for recalcitrant inmates. Mr. Merillat explained why the\n\nofficial prison statistics used by Dr. Cunningham are not completely reliable: (1) the prison\n\nreporting system does not match the penal code definitions of “violent” behavior;94 and (2)\n\nnot all incidents of inmate-on-inmate incidents of violence are reported. Finally, he told the\n\njury that, in the last few years, his unit had prosecuted 94 inmates who were serving life\n\nsentences for capital murder for both assaultive and non-assaultive felonies.\n\n       On cross-examination, Mr. Merillat agreed that he knew nothing about appellant\n\nexcept that his office had never prosecuted him. He agreed that he was not qualified to\n\nexpress any opinion regarding appellant’s “future dangerousness.” He also explained how\n\ndeath row inmates “had the run of the row” and could work in the garment factory when\n\ndeath row was in the Ellis Unit. Mr. Merillat agreed that the point of his testimony was that\n\nthere are abundant opportunities for inmates to be either violent or good, depending upon\n\ntheir own decisions.\n\n\n\n       94\n          For example, Mr. Merillat said that the official TDCJ statistics define serious assaults\non staff as only those that result in injuries requiring more than first aid. Thus, while the official\nprison data showed 78 serious assaults on staff for 2007, the Special Prosecution Unit prosecuted\n197 assaults against prison staff members. Similarly, there is no official prison data entry for\nhomicides of prison guards in the line of duty because it is not an inmate death.\n\f                                                                                  Coble   Page 49\n\n       Appellant asserts that the primary subject of Mr. Merillat’s testimony–opportunities\n\nfor violence in prison–is within the common knowledge of the jurors. Indeed, most jurors\n\nprobably have some understanding that violence can and does occur in prison, but a trial\n\ncourt need not exclude expert testimony when the general subject matter is within the\n\ncomprehension of the average juror, as long as the witness has some specialized knowledge\n\non the topic that will “assist” the jury.95 It is only when the expert offers no appreciable aid\n\nthat his testimony fails to meet the Rule 702 standard.96 The question under Rule 702 is not\n\nwhether the jurors know something about this subject, but whether the expert can expand\n\ntheir understanding in a relevant way.\n\n       In this case, Mr. Merillat confined his testimony to specific information about the\n\noperations of the Texas prison system and the opportunities for violence or productive\n\nbehavior. His expert testimony was intended to (1) educate the jury about an area in which\n\nit lacked a thorough understanding;97 and (2) cast doubt upon the official prison data that Dr.\n\n\n       95\n          See Duckett v. State, 797 S.W.2d 906, 914 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (under Rule 702, if\n“specialized knowledge will assist the jury to understand the evidence or will assist them to\ndetermine a fact in issue, an expert may be allowed to provide the jury with the benefit of that\nknowledge. Two themes are prevalent within the language of the rule. First, the jury must not be\nqualified to intelligently and to the best possible degree determine the particular issue without\nbenefit of the expert witness’ specialized knowledge. Second, the clear meaning of the rule must\nbe observed. . . . The use of expert testimony must be limited to situations in which the expert’s\nknowledge and experience on a relevant issue are beyond that of an average juror.”) (internal\ncitation omitted).\n       96\n            See, e.g., Pierce v.

Point of error six is overruled.\n\n         In point of error seven, appellant contends that the trial court erred by allowing Mr.\n\nMerillat to testify to hearsay information in violation of the Confrontation Clause 99 and of\n\nthe Texas Rules of Evidence.

We will address only those three instances:\n\n         (1)    Appellant objected on the basis of hearsay to Mr. Merillat’s statement that 78\n                serious staff assaults were documented in the official prison report that Dr.\n                Cunningham had used as the basis for his statistical analysis;\n\n         (2)    Appellant objected on the basis of hearsay and the Confrontation Clause to Mr.\n                Merillat’s explanation of why inmate-on-inmate violence is under-reported–\n                nobody wants to be a “snitch” which is the “very lowest form of life in the\n                penitentiary”; and\n\n\n\nunderstanding the conduct of a woman who endures an abusive relationship”); see also FED .

If the testimony did not involve hearsay, it ineluctably follows that it did not involve\n“testimonial hearsay.”\n\f                                                                                   Coble    Page 51\n\n       (3)      Appellant objected on the basis of hearsay and an inability to confront and\n                cross-examine when Mr. Merillat cited the story of an inmate who had been\n                beaten and starved to death by his stronger, gang-member cellmate, as an\n                example of why and when fellow inmates fail to report acts of violence.\n\nThe trial judge properly overruled these three hearsay and confrontation objections.\n\n       Hearsay is an out-of-court statement by a person offered for the truth of the matter\n\nasserted.100 None of these three pieces of testimony fits that definition. In the first, Mr.\n\nMerillat was not offering his statement of the official prison data compilation of “78 serious\n\nstaff assaults” for the truth of the matter asserted–that there were 78 serious staff assaults in\n\nthe previous year. Quite the reverse. Mr. Merillat’s point was that the official number of 78\n\nwas significantly lower than the actual number of serious assaults and thus the official prison\n\nstatistics that Dr. Cunningham used as the basis for his expert opinion were inaccurate.101\n\nIn the second, the testimony concerning why assaults upon inmates aren’t reported “because\n\nby telling on the person who did it, they are going to be much worse off[,]” Mr. Merillat did\n\nnot disclose any out-of-court statement.102         He was simply explaining, as a general\n\nproposition, why inmates do not “snitch” on each other. In the third, the inmate who was\n\nbeaten and starved to death, appellant does not point to any out-of-court statement. There\n\n\n       100\n        T    EX . R.

App.–Dallas 1994, pet. ref’d) (“If the\nout-of-court statement is relevant only if the trier of fact believes that the statement was both\ntruthful and accurate, then the statement is hearsay. If the relevancy of the statement does not\nhinge on the truthfulness of the statement, it is not hearsay.”).\n       102\n          Appellant’s objection would have merit if Mr. Merillat had testified, “Cool Hand Luke\ntold me that he would never be a snitch for Dragline.”\n\f                                                                                   Coble    Page 52\n\nis none. Mr. Merillat was recounting an event, not a verbal or written statement. He may\n\nhave first heard of the event by someone telling him of it,103 but he did not recite or imply\n\nany out-of-court statements.104 Because the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in\n\noverruling appellant’s hearsay and confrontation objections, we overrule point of error seven.\n\n       In his eighth point of error, appellant asserts that Mr. Merillat’s testimony was\n\ninadmissible because of the Eighth Amendment’s “heightened reliability” requirement in\n\ncapital murder prosecutions.       Appellant fails to cite any authority for increasing the\n\nadmissibility requirements for evidence in a capital murder sentencing trial. Indeed, some\n\nstate and federal courts have suggested that the Confrontation Clause, the Rules of Evidence,\n\nand the rule against hearsay do not apply with full force in capital murder sentencing trials.105\n\n\n       103\n           Mr. Merillat testified, however, that he investigated this case and “worked the trial of\nthe person responsible” for the prison death, so he would have first-hand knowledge of at least\nthe events that he briefly described.\n       104\n           When appellant objected that “the gruesome details of how some other individual\ntortured some other individual has nothing to do with the jury’s decision here,” presumably\ninvoking Rules 401-403, the trial judge sustained his objection, and the prosecutor moved on.\n       105\n           See United States v. Fields, 483 F.3d 313, 332 (5th Cir. 2007) (“Here we are asked to\ndecide whether the confrontation right applies with full force throughout capital sentencing,\ndespite the fact that it is nonexistent at ordinary sentencing. Given that, as shown above, no other\nSixth Amendment right has been applied (vel non) differently at capital sentencing from how it is\napplied at noncapital sentencing, there is little reason to establish divergent rules with regard to\nthe confrontation right when the sentencing authority is selecting a sentence from within an\nauthorized range. On the basis of the Supreme Court’s consistent treatment of Sixth Amendment\nrights across capital and noncapital cases alone, we find unpersuasive the dissent’s textual\nargument for why the Confrontation Clause should extend through the entirety of the capital\nsentencing process, in light of the fact that the jury right extends only as far as the eligibility\ndetermination.”), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1144 (2008); see also United States v.

In each case, the trial judge sustained appellant’s\n\nobjection to the outburst and instructed the jury to disregard the remarks. We conclude that\n\nthe trial court did not abuse his discretion in these rulings.\n\n       During Karen Vicha’s testimony describing what appellant told her about how he had\n\nchased and shot her brother, she explained that\n\n       [Appellant] started talking about–he told me, you’re pretty tough, you put up\n       a good fight with that gun. And he said, your brother thought–he said, your\n       brother thought he was tough too. He said, all cops think they’re tough, but he\n       thought he was really tough. He said–he said–he told me he said, all I was\n       trying to do was keep you away from my sister. And he said, I finally had to\n       shut him up and blow a hole that big in his neck.\n\nAt that point, Karen broke down crying and said, “And I hate you for making me go through\n\n\n\n\nabuse of discretion to admit written victim impact statement in capital murder sentencing trial\nover hearsay and confrontation objections). In Fields, the Fifth Circuit explained that in\nWoodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305 (1976),\n       The [Supreme] Court explained that the need for greater reliability in the selection\n       of an appropriate punishment entails not stricter evidentiary rules, but the\n       assurance of “individualized sentencing” once a defendant is eligible for the\n       death penalty.\nFields, 483 F.3d at 336.\n\f                                                                                     Coble    Page 54\n\nthis again and my kids. You’re mean.” The trial judge immediately called a recess.106 When\n\nthe jury returned, the trial judge instructed them: “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, at this\n\ntime I am going to give you an instruction to disregard the last comment of the witness and\n\nnot consider it for any purpose whatsoever.” He denied appellant’s motion for mistrial, and\n\nthe prosecutor continued with his questions.\n\n       After six more witnesses had testified, the State called Lorna Sawyer, appellant’s\n\ncousin. As soon as she had been sworn in, but before any questioning, she burst out, “Evil\n\npiece of shit.” The defense immediately responded: “Judge we object. Call for a mistrial.\n\nRequest an instruction to disregard. Call for a mistrial.” The Judge said, “I’ll instruct the\n\njury to disregard the last comment of the witness,” and Ms. Sawyer said, “Sorry.” When\n\nappellant then requested that she be excluded as a witness, the trial judge took a recess.107\n\n\n       106\n          While the jury was out, defense counsel explained what had happened:\n       We would like to note for the record that the last comment of the witness\n       was–was made with the witness in a very tearful state. What the witness did was\n       to turn in her chair, look directly at [appellant] and say something along the lines\n       of, I hate you for making me go through this. That was an unsolicited comment\n       not made in response to any of the Government’s questions. So at this time, we\n       would ask the Court to rule that’s an inadmissible statement and not relevant and\n       unfairly prejudicial and we would like to ask the Court to instruct the jury to dis–\n       disregard the last remark.\nThe prosecutor agreed that, although it was “spontaneous,” and “in response to the emotion of\nthe moment,” it would be appropriate to instruct the jury. The defense then asked for a mistrial,\nbased on Rule 403, the Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and the Eighth Amendment.\n       107\n            During the recess, appellant reiterated his objection under Rule 403 and stated, “I think\nit’s completely poisoned the jury, this display of emotion, something that not even the–the\ncomplainants–you know, the Vicha family did, I think the jury’s going to be unfairly influenced\nby that to the point that [appellant] now can’t get a fair trial.” The record reflects that the witness\nthen made a laughing sound. The trial judge said that he would instruct the jury to disregard the\ncomment, and he admonished the witness to answer only the questions that are asked and to “not\n\f                                                                                 Coble    Page 55\n\n         When the jury returned, Ms. Sawyer testified that appellant offered her a job at a\n\ndrive-in theater when she was 16. She had worked there for about two and a half weeks when\n\nappellant picked her up for work, but he took her to his house and raped her instead. She was\n\nso scared that she had never told anyone, except her sister, about this experience. When the\n\nprosecutor asked Ms. Sawyer if she was still afraid of appellant, the following occurred:\n\nWitness:        Actually, uh, without being ugly, I’d like to go there and just knock the shit out\n                of him.\n\nDefense:        Judge, I’m, going to have to object, Your Honor.           I think that was an\n                inappropriate comment.\n\nWitness:        It is not inappropriate.\n\nDefense:        I’d object to the sidebar from the witness. Judge. I’d ask that–the jury to\n                disregard.\n\nCourt:          The jury is instructed to disregard the last comment of the witness and not\n                consider it for any purpose.\n\nDefense:        I’d ask for a mistrial, You Honor.\n\nCourt:          That’s denied.\n\nState:          Lorna–\n\nWitness:        I’m sorry, I’m sorry.\n\nAnd the testimony then continued.\n\n         Appellant argues that these outbursts, individually or collectively, unfairly influenced\n\nthe jury and that influence could not be limited by an instruction to disregard.\n\n\n\nmake any voluntary statements.”\n\f                                                                                 Coble    Page 56\n\n       A trial judge’s denial of a motion for mistrial is reviewed under an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard,108 and his ruling must be upheld if it was within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement.109 We have held that an outburst from a bystander or witness “which interferes\n\nwith the normal proceedings of a trial will not result in reversible error unless the defendant\n\nshows that a reasonable probability [exists] that the conduct interfered with the jury’s\n\nverdict.” 110 In the context of such outbursts, the trial judge’s instructions to disregard are\n\ngenerally considered sufficient to cure the impropriety because it is presumed that the jury\n\nwill follow those instructions.111\n\n       Appellant relies upon Stahl v. State112 for his claim that the judge’s instruction to\n\ndisregard the spontaneous outbursts could not have cured their prejudicial effect and those\n\noutbursts must have interfered with the jury’s verdict. But Stahl was decided upon the basis\n\nof prosecutorial misconduct, not merely the witness’s emotional outburst. In Stahl, the\n\n\n       108\n             Gamboa v.

My baby. My God. . . . May he rest in hell. May he burn in hell. Oh,\n\nmy baby.” 114 The judge instructed the jury to disregard, but the prosecutor “exacerbated”\n\nthe impact by repeatedly referring to the incident in closing argument.115 The prosecutor’s\n\n“deliberate” and “persistent” conduct, “in direct contravention of prior rulings by the judge”\n\nindicated “a desire to impermissibly sway the jury.” 116 Indeed, the court of appeals had\n\nsuggested that the Stahl prosecutor “actually orchestrated the original outburst.” 117\n\n       In this case, however, there is no suggestion that the prosecutor anticipated the short\n\nemotional outburst by Ms. Vicha in the middle of her lengthy testimony or the entirely\n\ninappropriate start of Ms. Sawyer’s testimony. In the first instance, the prosecutor agreed\n\nwith the correctness of an instruction to disregard and, in the second, he did not attempt to\n\njustify Ms. Sawyer’s outburst.118 The trial judge immediately instructed the jury to disregard\n\n\n\n\n       113\n             Id. at 828.\n       114\n             Id. at 828-29.\n       115\n          Id. at 830 (“The persistent appeals in the face of adverse rulings speak loudly of the\nprosecutor’s desire to use the outburst for inflammatory purposes.”).\n       116\n             Id. at 830-31.\n       117\n             Id. at 826-27.\n       118\n          Ms. Sawyer could charitably be called a “feisty” witness, and both the prosecutor and\ndefense had difficulty controlling her nonresponsive answers. She was quickly excused.\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 58\n\nthose outbursts, and we must presume that the jurors followed these instructions.119 The\n\nprosecution did not refer to, or attempt to capitalize upon, the outbursts during closing\n\narguments. Furthermore, they occurred during the sentencing stage of a capital murder trial,\n\nnot the guilt stage as in Stahl. At the punishment hearing, evidence of the defendant’s\n\ncharacter is both relevant and admissible as is the opinion testimony concerning good or bad\n\ncharacter traits by those who know him.120 Obviously, character evidence must be offered\n\nin a proper form and be responsive to specific questions, so these outbursts were not proper,\n\nbut their potential for prejudice was less than had they occurred during the guilt phase of a\n\ntrial.\n\n         Because we conclude that nothing in the record suggests that the outbursts were of\n\nsuch a nature that the jury could not follow the trial judge’s instructions to disregard them,121\n\nwe overrule appellant’s points of error nine and ten.\n\n                 The Admission of the Hearsay Statement by a Witness’s Sister\n\n         In his eleventh point of error, appellant claims that the trial judge erred in admitting\n\nAmy Zuniga’s testimony that her sister, Karen, told her that appellant was looking in her\n\nbedroom window as she was dressing. Appellant objected to hearsay, but the trial judge\n\n\n\n\n         119\n               See Gamboa, 296 S.W.3d at 580.\n         120\n         See TEX . CODE CRIM .

We\n\nconclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that Karen’s out-of-court\n\nstatement was admissible as an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.122\n\n       Amy Zuniga testified that appellant was her uncle and, when she was young, she\n\nthought he was a model of how a parent should be because he was so nice to his own son.\n\nHowever, Amy changed her mind about appellant when she was fifteen. She explained that\n\none day she was sitting in a rocking chair in her nightgown, when appellant came in and\n\npulled her legs apart; then he made “a vulgar display like he was licking me” between her\n\nlegs. After that, she avoided him. But right before appellant moved into Amy’s mother’s\n\nhome shortly before the murders, Amy came out of the shower and was changing her clothes\n\nin her bedroom when she heard a “commotion from the kitchen, a beating on the window.”\n\nThen Karen ran through Amy’s bedroom door from the kitchen, went outside through her\n\nback bedroom door, and started yelling. Amy peeked out through the curtains and saw\n\nappellant driving off in his truck. Then Karen came back inside, “very mad and frustrated.\n\nShe was red, angry.” Karen told Amy that she had seen appellant outside looking through\n\nthe curtains as Amy was dressing.\n\n       The trial judge admitted Karen’s out-of-court statement to Amy based on it being both\n\nan excited utterance and a present sense impression. We need examine its admissibility only\n\nunder the excited utterance exception. An excited utterance is a statement that relates to a\n\n\n\n       122\n       T     EX . R. EVID .   803(2).\n\f                                                                               Coble    Page 60\n\nstartling event or condition, and it is made when the declarant is still under the stress of\n\nexcitement caused by the event or condition.123\n\n       Appellant contends that Karen’s statement was not admissible as an excited utterance\n\nbecause there was no showing that she was in the “grip of violent emotion, excitement or\n\npain.” 124 She was angry, not excited. The critical question, however, is not the specific type\n\nof emotion that the declarant is dominated by–anger, fear, happiness–but whether the\n\ndeclarant was still dominated by the emotion caused by the startling event when she spoke.125\n\nAppellant also argues that Karen’s statement was not admissible because there was no\n\nindependent evidence of the startling event–appellant’s “Peeping Tom” conduct. Appellant\n\ncites to a Texas Supreme Court case, Richardson v. Green,126 which applied the common-law\n\n“res gestae” rule. But Rule 803(2) changed the common law; the current rule does not\n\nrequire independent evidence of the exciting event before the trial judge may admit the\n\n\n\n       123\n           Id.; see McCarty v.

The\n\nState objected, citing Standefer v. State,130 Sells v. State,131 and Wingo v. State,132 and stated\n\nthat these were commitment questions. The trial judge sustained the State’s objections, but\n\nallowed more general mitigation questions about whether there was anything that the jurors\n\n“could consider under the circumstances of having found [appellant] a future danger to\n\nsociety which might merit a life penalty.”\n\n       In Raby v. State, we rejected appellant’s claim that he is entitled to ask potential jurors\n\nin a death penalty case about what specific evidence that juror could or would consider as\n\nmitigating.133 We stated that “[a] trial court does not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow\n\na defendant to ask venire members questions based on facts peculiar to the case on trial (e.g.\n\nquestions about particular mitigating evidence).” 134 Appellant does not persuade us that Raby\n\n\n       130\n             59 S.W.3d 177, 180 (Tex.

We therefore overrule appellant’s twelfth point of error.\n\nB.     The Mitigation Instruction\n\n       In his thirteenth point of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred by refusing\n\nto instruct the jurors that they need not unanimously agree on what particular evidence\n\nsupports an affirmative finding on the mitigation issue. Appellant invokes Mills v.\n\nMaryland 135 in support of his argument. We addressed and rejected this same argument in\n\nSegundo v. State,136 and appellant has not persuaded us that Segundo was wrongly decided.\n\nWe overrule his thirteenth point of error.\n\nC.     The Definition of Mitigating Evidence\n\n       In his fourteenth and fifteenth points of error, appellant argues that the trial court\n\nshould not have given the jury the statutory definition of mitigating evidence “as evidence\n\nthat a juror might regard as reducing the defendant’s moral blameworthiness.” 137 This same\n\n\n\n\ncourt does not abuse his discretion in finding that appellant’s questioning consider specific\nmitigation evidence was an improper commitment question); Rosales v. State, 4 S.W.3d 228, 233\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (“This Court has held on numerous occasions that an appellant is not\nentitled to voir dire prospective jurors on whether they could consider particular types of\nmitigating evidence during the capital sentencing phase.”).\n       135\n             486 U.S. 367 (1988).\n       136\n             270 S.W.3d 79, 102-03 (Tex.

State,138 and appellant’s arguments do not persuade us to\n\noverrule that case. He also contends that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that\n\nthere need be no nexus between the mitigating evidence and the capital murder because the\n\nmandatory statutory definition, he argues, implies that there must be a connection between\n\nthe reduced moral blameworthiness and the capital offense itself. We do not see any\n\n“nexus” requirement in the statutory definition. Appellant relies upon Tennard v. Dretke,139\n\nbut the Supreme Court, in that case, simply chastised the Fifth Circuit for requiring a nexus\n\nbetween the crime and the mitigating evidence.140 It never suggested that a jury can, should,\n\nor must be instructed not to consider any nexus between the crime and the mitigating\n\nevidence. Such an instruction would be necessary only if the jury would be reasonably likely\n\nto infer a nexus requirement from the statutory words. 141 That is not the case. We overrule\n\nappellant’s fourteenth and fifteenth points of error.\n\nD.     The Mitigation Issue\n\n       In his sixteenth point of error, appellant relies on Apprendi142 and Ring 143 to argue that\n\n\n\n       138\n             220 S.W.3d 521, 534 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n       139\n             542 U.S. 274 (2004).\n       140\n          Id. at 287 (rejecting any suggestion that its prior opinions would require a nexus\nbetween low I.Q. and the crime).\n       141\n             See Segundo, 270 S.W.3d at 103.\n       142\n             Apprendi v.

He\n\nfails to mention that this Court has rejected that claim in numerous cases,144 and he fails to\n\npersuade us that our prior decisions were mistaken.\n\n       In his eighteenth point of error, appellant claims that the Texas death-penalty scheme\n\nis unconstitutional under Penry II,145 because the mitigation issue sends “mixed signals” to\n\nthe jury, thus rendering any finding reached on that special issue unreliable. Penry II is\n\ndistinguishable because, in that case, the jury was given a judicially crafted nullification\n\ninstruction.146 Here, the jury was given the statutorily mandated mitigation question, which\n\ndoes not contain a nullification instruction. No error exists, and we have repeatedly rejected\n\nthis claim.147 We overrule appellant’s eighteenth point of error\n\nE.     Constitutional Challenges to Art. 37.0711\n\n       In his seventeenth point of error, appellant contends that the Texas death-penalty\n\nstatute gives the jury too much discretion and therefore permits arbitrary and inconsistent\n\n\n\n       144\n           See Segundo, 270 S.W.3d at 102; Crutsinger v.

We have repeatedly rejected this claim and appellant\n\ndoes not persuade us to overrule these prior cases.148 In fact, he fails to mention them.\n\n       In his nineteenth and twentieth point of error, appellant argues that the jurors should\n\nhave been instructed on the consequences of a hung jury so that they would immediately stop\n\ndeliberating if a single juror voted in appellant’s favor on an issue that required unanimity.\n\nHe also argues that the jurors should not have been instructed on the “10-12” Rule. Although\n\nappellant fails to mention controlling precedent from this Court, we have repeatedly rejected\n\nthese claims.149 We do so again.\n\n       In his twenty-first through twenty-third points of error, appellant argues that the\n\nstatutory “future dangerousness” special issue is unconstitutional because the terms\n\n“probability,” “criminal acts of violence,” and “society” are not defined. We have repeatedly\n\nrejected these claims,150 and, although counsel suggests that we should revisit this precedent,\n\nwe decline to do so.\n\n       In his twenty-fourth point of error, appellant contends that the statutory “future\n\n\n       148\n         Escamilla v.

The “future dangerousness” aggravating factor has been recognized\n\nby the Supreme Court as properly narrowing the jury’s consideration to ensure individualized\n\nsentencing as recently as two years ago in Kennedy v. Louisiana.151 Although appellant\n\nasserts that only one other state, Oregon, requires a finding of future dangerousness in his\n\neffort to prove that a “national consensus” has developed against imposing the death penalty\n\nbased on that factor, he fails to note that twenty-one other states include a defendant’s\n\npossible future dangerousness among the aggravating circumstances to be considered at the\n\nsentencing stage of a capital case.152 Furthermore, we have previously rejected this claim,153\n\nand we are not persuaded by appellant’s arguments that our precedent should be overruled.\n\n       In his final point of error, appellant claims that the “future dangerousness” statutory\n\nscheme violates the Texas constitutional ban on cruel or unusual punishment. As appellant\n\n\n       151\n            128 S.Ct. 2641, 2661 (2008) (“The [Supreme] Court . . . has upheld the\nconstitutionality of aggravating factors ranging from whether the defendant was a ‘cold-blooded,\npitiless slayer,’ to whether the ‘perpetrator inflict[ed] mental anguish or physical abuse before the\nvictim’s death,’ to whether the defendant ‘would commit criminal acts of violence that would\nconstitute a continuing threat to society.’”) (internal citations omitted; some internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n       152\n           Jonathan R.

This is not the type of “evidence” upon which we can base a finding that the\n\n“future dangerousness” special issue is necessarily an unreliable factor to use in determining\n\nwhether a life or death sentence is appropriate. Evidence proves historical facts; the “future\n\ndangerousness” special issue is a normative assessment mandated by the legislature and\n\ndetermined by the jury. Questions about its “appropriateness” as a factor in determining a\n\nlife or death sentence should be addressed to the legislature. Furthermore, the article speaks\n\nof psychiatric predictions, not of the unreliability of jury verdicts. We overrule appellant’s\n\ntwenty-fifth point of error.\n\n       Having found no reversible error, we affirm the trial court’s judgment and sentence.\n\nDelivered: October 13, 2010\n\nPublish\n\n\n\n\n       154\n          See Anderson v.

They were married in July 1988 and lived\n\nin a house down the road from her brother and across the street from her parents. Appellant\n\nwas almost forty years old. The marriage quickly disintegrated,3 and, after a year, Karen told\n\nappellant to move out. She wanted a divorce. Appellant attempted to talk her out of this\n\ndecision and would randomly call her and show up at her work place.\n\n       Appellant then kidnapped Karen as a further effort to dissuade her from divorcing\n\nhim. He hid in the trunk of her car while she was at a bar one evening with a girlfriend.\n\nWhen Karen started to drive home, appellant folded down the back seat and “popped out of\n\nthe trunk with a knife.” He jumped over the console, halfway into the front seat, and stuck\n\nthe knife against Karen’s ribs. He told her to keep driving until they came to a field. Karen\n\nstopped the car, and appellant said that he if couldn’t have her, then no one else could. He\n\npulled out a roll of black electrical tape, but Karen kept talking, and, after about two hours,\n\nshe convinced him that she would reconsider the divorce issue. He let her go, and she called\n\nher brother, Bobby, who was a police officer. Bobby told Karen to report the kidnapping.\n\n\n       2\n           Coble v.

When appellant was released on bail for the kidnapping charge, Bobby got\n\nKaren a German shepherd for protection. A few days later, appellant told Karen, “Oh, I see\n\nyou–you’ve got a dog now. . . . [T]hat’s a big mean dog you’ve got.” Shortly thereafter,\n\nKaren found the dog lying dead in front of her house.\n\n       Nine days after he had kidnapped Karen, appellant went to her house in the early\n\nafternoon. As Karen’s three daughters each came home from school along with Bobby’s\n\nson,4 appellant handcuffed them, tied up their feet, and taped their mouths closed. Karen’s\n\noldest daughter testified that she heard appellant cut the telephone lines. Then he left to\n\nambush and shoot Karen’s father, mother, and brother Bobby as each of them came home.5\n\n       Appellant returned to Karen’s house after the triple killings and waited for his wife\n\nto come home from work. He told the children, “I wish I had blown you away like I intended\n\n\n       4\n        All four children, ages 16, 14, 11, and 10, testified that they had liked appellant prior to\nthe murders.\n       5\n            Karen’s father, the first victim, was found inside his home, covered with blankets and\ntowels. Karen’s mother was found in her garage. Bobby was found in his car in his garage.\n         Later that day, appellant told Karen that her brother was tough. “He put up one hell of a\nfight. . . . I chased him down the road one way, and I chased him back. And then I shot him, and\nhe was going for the gun in his car. And he wouldn’t die. . . . So, finally I had to blow a hole that\nbig in his neck.” Appellant also told Karen that he “really hated to do that to your mom. But\nwhen she found out about your dad, she just went crazy.”\n\f                                                                                  Coble     Page 4\n\nto.” When Karen arrived, appellant came out of one of the bedrooms with a gun. Appellant\n\nsaid, “Karen, I’ve killed your momma and your daddy and your brother, and they are all dead,\n\nand nobody is going to come help you now.” She didn’t believe him, so appellant showed\n\nher Bobby’s gun lying on the kitchen table and pulled the curtains so she could see her\n\nfather’s truck parked behind the house. He showed her $1,000 in cash that he had taken from\n\nher mother. Appellant told Karen that she was lucky that he hadn’t molested her daughters,\n\nand he told her to kiss them good-bye. She did. He made her put on handcuffs. Karen\n\ntalked appellant into leaving the house and taking her with him.6 He said he was going to\n\ntake her away for a few weeks and torture her.7\n\n       As appellant drove, Karen tried to escape by freeing one hand from the handcuffs and\n\ngrabbing at the steering wheel, making the car swerve into a ditch. She grabbed one of\n\nappellant’s guns, pointed it at his stomach, and pulled the trigger, but nothing happened.\n\nThen Karen and appellant fought over the gun, with appellant repeatedly pulling the trigger,\n\nbut still the gun did not fire. Appellant pistol-whipped Karen until she couldn’t see for all\n\nof the blood on her face. A woman passerby started shouting at appellant, “[W]hat are you\n\n\n       6\n         While Karen and appellant were still at her house, Bobby’s girlfriend dropped by and\nsaw Karen in handcuffs. She then went to Bobby’s house and called Karen’s uncle to tell him\nabout seeing Karen in handcuffs. After that call, she looked around Bobby’s house and saw\nblood everywhere, plants and furniture up-ended, and general disarray. She called the sheriff’s\noffice. Officers then came to Karen’s house, talked to the four children, found the bodies of the\nthree victims, and started the hunt for appellant.\n       7\n          Karen testified that when she came to a court hearing in 1998, appellant kept turning\naround and smiling at her with “a wicked evil grin.” Even in 2008, she was still scared of him\nand felt that he was a continuing threat to her.\n\f                                                                              Coble    Page 5\n\ntrying to do to that woman,” so appellant drove the car out of the ditch as Karen lay in the\n\npassenger seat. He shouted at her that if she got blood on his clothes, he would kill her. But\n\nhe was also rubbing her between her legs as he drove. He told her that his reputation was\n\nruined because she had had him arrested and his name was in the papers.\n\n       He drove to a deserted field in Bosque County where he threatened to rape her. After\n\ndark, he drove out of the field, but they passed a sheriff’s patrol car which turned around to\n\nfollow them. Appellant grabbed a knife and started stabbing Karen’s chin, forehead, and\n\nnose, as he was driving. Appellant said that he did not want to die in prison, so he “floored\n\nit” and rammed into a parked car. After the crash, appellant turned to Karen and said, “I\n\nguess now you’ll get a new car.” Both appellant and Karen were injured in the crash.\n\nOfficers had to cut the car door open to get Karen out. Appellant was found with Karen’s\n\nfather’s watch and wallet, as well as .37 and .38 caliber revolvers.\n\n       Although appellant was forty years old when he committed this triple murder, the\n\nState’s evidence showed that he was no stranger to violence. He had a long history of\n\nbrutalizing and molesting women. Appellant beat both of his former wives and molested\n\nseveral young girls, including relatives.\n\n       His first wife, Pam Woolley, testified that they were married in 1970 when appellant\n\nwas twenty-two. They had two children, but their marriage started downhill after two years.\n\nBy 1974, appellant had become violent, and he used to beat her on the head so that her hair\n\f                                                                                    Coble    Page 6\n\nwould hide the marks. 8 Pam said that appellant could go from normal to extremely angry in\n\na split second, and he always blamed her for his violent acts. Appellant told her that if she\n\never filed for divorce, he would “fix her” so no other man would look at her again.\n\n       During this ten-year marriage, appellant molested Pam’s younger sister and punched\n\nher on the mouth, “busting” her lip. He molested his children’s thirteen-year-old babysitter\n\nwhile teaching her how to water ski. He groped the breast of another neighborhood girl. In\n\n1979, when appellant was thirty, he raped his cousin who was about fifteen at the time.\n\nWhen appellant’s niece was fifteen, he grabbed her ankles as she sat in a chair wearing a\n\nnightgown, spread open her legs, and gestured with his tongue as if he were performing oral\n\nsex on her. Later that same day, he forcibly kissed her and then threw her a $5 bill.\n\n       Appellant married Candy Ryan, his second wife, when he was thirty-five and she was\n\neighteen. After one year of marriage, appellant started physically abusing her. He regularly\n\nhit her on the head. Once he grabbed her by the hair and repeatedly hit her against the\n\ncabinet and floor. After she dared to throw something at him, he hit her with a sledge\n\nhammer. Candy said that appellant had a “switch-type” personality–changing from sweet to\n\nnasty in a split-second. He stalked her, both during and after their marriage. He would sit\n\nin his car outside the gas station where Candy worked, and, if a customer stayed inside too\n\nlong, appellant came in and gave the customer an intimidating look. After Candy left\n\n\n\n       8\n         He also threw a plate at Pam when she cooked something he did not like; he knocked\nher to the floor with an open-hand slap; he hit her on the back with a baseball bat so hard that she\nhad to go the hospital; and he sat on her chest and punched her in the face, breaking her nose.\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 7\n\nappellant, he would call her late at night and tell her where she had been, whom she had been\n\nwith, and what she had been doing. Appellant threatened Candy’s father when he tried to\n\nhelp Candy leave.\n\n       Appellant’s childhood did not augur well for his future. His earliest years were spent\n\nin the custody of an alcoholic stepfather who worked only periodically and a sickly,\n\nwithdrawn, and depressed mother. When appellant was four, his mother was institutionalized\n\nin the Austin State Hospital with a psychoneurotic disorder. Appellant, his brother, and his\n\nolder sister were sent to the Corsicana State Home for Children. Because of her promiscuous\n\nacting-out, appellant’s older sister was sent to a convent school, and his problematic older\n\nbrother was placed under the supervision of the Waco Probation Department. Appellant\n\nremained at the Home for twelve years.\n\n       When appellant was fifteen, a psychiatrist, Dr. Hodges, evaluated him and concluded\n\nthat he was paranoid, distant, and impulsive; he showed poor self-control, displayed hostility\n\nto women, and blamed others for his own bad conduct. Dr. Hodges’s impression was that\n\nappellant “represent[ed] a sociopathic personality disturbance of the dissocial type.” People\n\nwith this diagnosis gratify their own desires without regard for the cost to others. Appellant’s\n\n“long term prognosis [did] not look good.”\n\n       At age seventeen, appellant joined the Marine Corps and was sent to Vietnam.\n\nAlthough he received an honorable discharge after his four-year tour of duty, he was not\n\nrecommended for re-enlistment because of a series of violations and convictions. He married\n\f                                                                               Coble    Page 8\n\nhis first wife shortly after he left the Marines.\n\n       Dr. Richard Coons, a psychiatrist, had testified at appellant’s 1990 trial that he would\n\nbe a future danger. Dr. Coons testified at the 2008 retrial that appellant would still be a\n\nfuture danger even though appellant did not have a single disciplinary report for the eighteen\n\nyears that he had been on death row. Dr. Coons explained this discrepancy by stating that\n\nall those on death row have an incentive to behave because their convictions are on appeal,\n\nand thus they are less violent than they would be in the general prison population.\n\n       Appellant called several witnesses to attest to his prison reformation and lack of\n\nviolence for the entire time that he had been on death row. According to one fellow inmate,\n\nappellant was well liked by everyone; he was always even-tempered and had the ability to\n\n“talk sense” into some of the more violent inmates. He said that appellant had organized a\n\nsports league at the Ellis Unit and that he helped inmates write letters and would read them\n\ntheir letters from family members. After Death Row was moved to the Polunsky Unit,\n\nappellant’s behavior was the same; he was always helpful and upbeat.\n\n       Another inmate testified that appellant would take people “under his wing” and help\n\nthe “agitated” ones. He stated that, while at the Ellis Unit, appellant was an SSI, which was\n\nlike a trustee, and would often walk around with female officers. A third inmate testified that\n\nappellant was generous and gave commissary items to other inmates. A fourth inmate said\n\nthat appellant helped him to learn English and to file a federal habeas petition. Appellant\n\nhelped mentally-retarded inmates and was known for his respect for the law and God.\n\f                                                                                  Coble    Page 9\n\n       Appellant’s older sister testified about their childhood and how appellant changed for\n\nthe worse after coming home from Vietnam. She said that, shortly before the triple murders,\n\nshe saw appellant throwing away many of his most prized possessions, and he began talking\n\nabout his experiences in Vietnam, something he had never done before. On the day of the\n\nmurders, appellant threw his truck keys at her and said that, if anything happened, the truck\n\nwas hers. Appellant’s son testified that appellant taught him welding, and he described his\n\nfather as loving and helpful to others.\n\n       Dr. Cunningham, a forensic psychologist, testified that he had reviewed appellant’s\n\nprison record which contained no disciplinary write-ups. Dr. Cunningham conducted a\n\nviolence risk assessment of appellant. In his opinion, appellant had a very low probability\n\nof committing acts of violence while in prison.\n\n              Sufficiency of the Evidence to Prove Future Dangerousness\n\n       In his first and second points of error, appellant asserts that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the jury’s finding that there is a probability that he would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence in the future. As appellant acknowledges, we have\n\nconsistently held that we lack authority to conduct a factual sufficiency review of the jury’s\n\nfuture-dangerousness verdict.9 Appellant’s arguments do not persuade us otherwise.\n\n       In assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support future dangerousness, we\n\n\n\n       9\n         See McGinn v.

Clearly it is sufficient. Instead, he argues\n\nthat, like Saul on the road to Damascus, he has experienced a character conversion while\n\nspending the last eighteen years in prison with a spotless disciplinary record. He has proven\n\nthat he no longer poses any realistic threat of violence.

Dr. Cunningham, his\n\nexpert forensic psychologist, placed appellant in the lowest risk group for violence in prison.\n\nBut, as the prosecutors pointed out, appellant had done many of these same positive things\n\nbefore the murders as well: he coached one of Karen’s daughter’s baseball teams; he fixed\n\nthings around the house; he tended the garden; he praised Karen; he repaired their car; he\n\nhelped organize a school sports banquet. Appellant’s son, Gordon, testified that his father\n\nhelped him with sports and took him fishing and hunting. He taught Gordon welding,\n\nelectrical work, and a good work ethic. He was a very patient teacher and friendly, talkative,\n\nhappy, and helpful to others.\n\n       Appellant agrees with the proposition that “the past is the best predictor of the future,”\n\nand he relies upon a spotless, positive prison record as a realistic predictor of the future.\n\nAppellant concludes that, “[i]n light of [his] age and his prison record, . . . the only rational\n\nfinding in this case is that he would not be a continuing threat to society. For that reason, his\n\nsentence must be vacated.” 13\n\n       This is the same argument that appellant made during the trial, and the jury must have\n\ntaken it seriously because it asked for just three pieces of evidence during its deliberations,\n\nevidence that was directly relevant to this argument:\n\n\n\n       13\n            Appellant’s Brief at 31.\n\f                                                                                 Coble     Page 12\n\n       (1)     Dr. Hodges’s Austin State School psychiatric report from 1964 when appellant\n               was 15. That report stated that appellant seemed paranoid and distant and\n               “extremely hostile to women”; Dr. Hodges’s impression was that “this boy\n               represents a sociopathic personality disturbance of the dissocial type.” 14 He\n               concluded, “The long term prognosis does not look good.”\n\n       (2)     The military medical record from appellant’s 1967 self-inflicted stabbing\n               wound in his thigh after he had a fight with his girlfriend.15 According to the\n               military doctor, appellant “revealed evidence of lifelong maladjustment.” On\n               the hospital ward he was “hostile and belligerent” and only slowly “began to\n               conform to the ward milieu.”\n\n       (3)     The pictures and cards that appellant had in his death row cell. These included\n               numerous pictures of scantily clad young women and girls–young gymnasts\n               and skaters–as well as romantic cards and photographs from a female pen pal.\n\n       14\n          During the psychiatric interview, appellant “talked at some length about [a] fairly\ninvolved series of thefts and many anti-social acts such as stealing the ball bearings out of other\nchildren’s bicycles so the wheels would not roll because he did not have a bicycle.” Appellant\ntold Dr. Hodges about “several thefts and [a] burglary in which he and his brother were suspected\nwhich he never admitted to the police but which he readily told me about during the interview.”\nThe penultimate paragraph of Dr. Hodges’s report reads,\n                [Appellant] seemed rather paranoid, distant, and deliberately non-smiling,\n        as if he must deliberately keep people away from him to avoid the hurt from\n        further rejection and hostility. He said that he did have some friends, but\n        throughout the interview he seemed extremely hostile to women, made very\n        deprecating remarks about them, and in general seemed to have a very low\n        opinion of women. For instance, he told of beating up a young girl in the\n        classroom because she said something smart to him, and he seemed impulsive,\n        had poor controls, a very low self-esteem and he seemed to project a great deal of\n        responsibility for his own actions on other people.\n       15\n         The medical report set out appellant’s explanation for the injury:\n       According to the patient, his fiancée came from Texas so that he and she could\n       become married. He had arrived from Da Nang and had met her and she was in\n       an apartment with another fellow. The patient thought that his fiancée was having\n       an affair with this other fellow and he became so angry and enraged that he\n       threatened to kill him and also threatened to kill his fiancée. He stated that while\n       he was involved in a fight, he picked up a knife and accidentally stabbed himself\n       in the right thigh. His previous story, upon admission, was that he attempted to\n       kill himself and was trying to stab himself in the abdomen and missed, finally\n       stabbing himself in the right thigh.\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 13\n\n\n       The jury had also heard from several different sources about appellant’s mercurial\n\nmoods: one moment calm and sweet, the next moment in a towering rage.16\n\n       The jury also heard evidence that appellant, after all his time on death row, was still\n\nhostile to women. Karen testified that when she appeared for a hearing in 1998, almost ten\n\nyears after appellant’s original conviction, appellant “turned around and watched me sit\n\ndown. And then, after that, he kept turning around and looking at me and grinning.” It was\n\na “weird evil grin.” Karen “called it to the Judge’s attention, and then he told him to stop.\n\nAnd then, he did it again. And [the judge] told him–I think his words were, I have to\n\nadmonish you for that and I’ll have to call you in contempt if you don’t stop it.” According\n\nto Karen, appellant had that same grin when she testified at the 2008 trial.\n\n       Appellant’s attorney explained at trial that, “I’m not saying Bill Coble is a different\n\nperson–okay–than he was in 1989. But you can see that he’s made changes. You can see\n\nthat he has adapted himself to prison environment, that[] he’s adapted himself to institutional\n\nlife. That’s very clear.” That is clear; appellant has adapted very well to prison life, but that\n\nfact, by itself, does not resolve the special issue:\n\n       Is there a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of\n       violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society? 17\n\n\n       16\n          Karen testified that she was really scared when she and appellant were in the Bosque\nCounty field after the murders because appellant would veer from pistol-whipping her and\nthreatening to kill her to wanting to carry her over the brambles in the field so she wouldn’t\nstumble and hurt her bare feet.\n       17\n        T   EX .

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2450978\"><a href=\"/opinion/2450978/jurek-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 945 (Tex. Crim. App. 1975) (Odom, J., concurring\nand dissenting). As Judge Odom complained, the Legislature declined to specify any particular\nlevel of probability in this special issue:\n                 What did the Legislature mean when it provided that a man’s life or death\n        shall rest upon whether there exists a “probability” that he will perform certain\n        acts in the future? Did it mean, as the words read, is there a probability, some\n        probability, any probability? We may say there is a twenty percent probability that\n        it will rain tomorrow, or a ten or five percent probability. Though this be a small\n        probability, yet it is some probability, a probability, and no one would say it is no\n        probability or not a probability. It has been written: “It is probable that many\n        things will happen contrary to probability,” and “A thousand probabilities do not\n        make one fact.” The statute does not require a particular degree of probability but\n        only directs that some probability need be found. The absence of a specification as\n        to what degree of probability is required is itself a vagueness inherent in the term\n        as used in this issue. Our common sense understanding of the term leaves the\n        statute too vague to pass constitutional muster.\nId. (footnote omitted). But the Supreme Court disagreed with Judge Odom’s constitutional\nconcerns about the vague nature of “a probability” in the special issue. See note 19 infra.\n       19\n         In upholding the Texas death penalty scheme and its special issues in Jurek v. Texas,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109534\"><a href=\"/opinion/109534/jurek-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), the United States Supreme Court agreed that it is\n      not easy to predict future behavior. The fact that such a determination is difficult,\n      however, does not mean that it cannot be made. Indeed, prediction of future\n      criminal conduct is an essential element in many of the decisions rendered\n      throughout our criminal justice system. . . . The task that a Texas jury must\n      perform in answering the statutory question in issue is thus basically no different\n      from the task performed countless times each day throughout the American\n      system of criminal justice. What is essential is that the jury have before it all\n      possible relevant information about the individual defendant whose fate it must\n      determine. Texas law clearly assures that all such evidence will be adduced.\n\f                                                                                  Coble    Page 15\n\nrecently stated in Estrada v. State,20 “This Court’s case law has construed the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue to ask whether a defendant would constitute a continuing threat\n\n‘whether in or out of prison’ without regard to how long the defendant would actually spend\n\nin prison if sentenced to life.” 21 That is, this special issue focuses upon the internal restraints\n\nof the individual, not merely the external restraints of incarceration. It is theoretically\n\npossible to devise a prison environment so confining, isolated, and highly structured that\n\nvirtually no one could have the opportunity to commit an act of violence, but incapacitation\n\nis not the sole focus of the Legislature or of our death penalty precedents.22\n\n\nId. at 274-76. Thus, the Supreme Court focused on the particular characteristics of the individual\ndefendant himself, not upon an outside entity to constrain or control the individual defendant. It\ndid not disagree with this Court’s original opinion in Jurek which had suggested possible types of\nevidence that jurors could use in assessing the probability that the defendant would commit\nfuture acts of violence:\n        In determining the likelihood that the defendant would be a continuing threat to\n        society, the jury could consider whether the defendant had a significant criminal\n        record. It could consider the range and severity of his prior criminal conduct. It\n        could further look to the age of the defendant and whether or not at the time of the\n        commission of the offense he was acting under duress or under the domination of\n        another. It could also consider whether the defendant was under an extreme form\n        of mental or emotional pressure, something less, perhaps, than insanity, but more\n        than the emotions of the average man, however inflamed, could withstand.\n522 S.W.2d at 939-40. These are all factors that relate to the individual defendant, not to the\nefficacy of external controls.\n       20\n            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1890229\"><a href=\"/opinion/1890229/estrada-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

He said that he also relies upon psychiatric principles when he\n\nevaluates defendants for “future dangerousness” for capital murder trials. He repeatedly\n\nstated that “the best predictor of the future is the past” and noted that\n\n       there are certain trends in people who are, in other words, habit patterns or\n       personality patterns that–that we rely on. Um, and then, of course, there’s the\n       experience one has, the training and then the experience that one has in seeing\n       quite a number of people and, uh–uh–watching classifications within various\n       jails and so forth. Uh, those are kind of the principles or the things that are\n       –opinions are based on.\n\nDr. Coons noted that there are some psychiatric diagnoses that are listed in the DSM,30 such\n\nas antisocial personality disorder, that might indicate that a person is dangerous. But in this\n\ncase, Dr. Coons relied on materials supplied by the District Attorney’s Office.\n\n       Dr. Coons explained his standard methodology in assessing the issue of future\n\ndangerousness. For at least the past twenty years he has relied upon several different factors:\n\n       (1)     The person’s history of violence;\n\n       (2)     The person’s attitude toward violence;\n\n       (3)     The particulars of the criminal offense;\n\n       (4)     The person’s personality and general behavior;\n\n       (5)     The person’s conscience; and\n\n       (6)     Where the person will be–in or out of prison.\n\n       30\n       D     IAGNOSTIC AND   STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS.\n\f                                                                              Coble    Page 20\n\nHe assesses these factors based on the information that he has been given. This is his own\n\npersonal methodology. He does not know whether others rely upon this method, and he does\n\nnot know of any psychiatric or psychology books or articles that use his factors. But “[t]hese\n\nare matters that are discussed commonly at–at forensic meetings and among forensic\n\npsychiatrists. . . . [B]ut generally speaking, those are the–are the kinds of things that, uh,\n\nforensic psychiatrists would take into consideration in reaching an opinion.” He doubts that\n\nhis methodology is shared by everyone because different psychiatrists construct their own\n\nmethodologies.\n\n       Dr. Coons stated that multiple psychiatrists would not necessarily agree on what is\n\nimportant in the first factor–looking to past conduct to predict future conduct. “I’m the one\n\nwho’s making the decision–about whether it means something to me in terms of what I–my\n\neducation or experience or background is.” It is a subjective evaluation. When assessing\n\npast violence, Dr. Coons looks at its nature and context.\n\n       The same subjectivity is true for the second factor, a person’s attitude about violence,\n\nas well as the third factor, the circumstances of the offense. Two different psychiatrists may\n\ncome to different conclusions based on the same facts. Dr. Coons said that forensic\n\npsychiatrists develop an experiential body of knowledge and information and approach that\n\nhelps them make their decisions. But Dr. Coons disagreed that it was “just a gut feeling.”\n\n       When it comes to the fourth factor of personality and behavior, Dr. Coons looks to\n\nwhether the crime was an aberration or whether that person has had a problem looking out\n\f                                                                                 Coble    Page 21\n\nfor other people. Is he controlling? Manipulative? With the fifth factor, “conscience is\n\ninvolved in–in helping people control their behavior. And, I mean, really, I guess almost\n\neverybody knows that.” There is no yardstick to measure it. With the final factor, Dr. Coons\n\nstated that if the person is on death row he will be less violent because “everybody that’s on\n\ndeath row is on appeal by definition. And they tend to be on their good behavior. Uh,\n\nbecause if they–on their bad behavior and they get another trial or punishment, they uh–they\n\nknow they’ll hear about it again. Their violence on death row or threats or whatever.” 31\n\n       All of these factors overlap and blend, but Dr. Coons knows of no book or article that\n\ndiscusses these factors or their overlap. He is not aware of any studies in psychiatric journals\n\nregarding the accuracy of long-term predictions into future violence in capital murder\n\nprosecutions or of any error rates concerning such predictions. Nor is he aware of any\n\npsychiatric studies which support the making of these predictions. Dr. Coons has never gone\n\nback and obtained records to try to check the accuracy of the “future dangerousness”\n\npredictions he has made in the past. He cannot tell what his accuracy rate is.\n\n       On redirect, the prosecutor asked Dr. Coons to read from a legal brief containing the\n\nnames and titles of some articles on future dangerousness that had been filed in a different\n\ncase, but Dr. Coons was not familiar with any of those articles.\n\n\n\n       31\n           Dr. Coons admitted that there is no objective way of differentiating between the two\nlocations, death row versus general population, “[j]ust logic. . . . I think if you took a thousand\npsychiatrists and presented that to them, most people would say they have motivation to be on\ntheir better behavior if they’re on death row.” But Dr. Coons stated that there is no objective way\nof proving that proposition and he knows of no studies that support that theory.\n\f                                                                                 Coble    Page 22\n\n       Based on this testimony, the trial judge found that Dr. Coons qualified as an expert\n\nwitness, that the subject matter of his testimony was an appropriate one for experts, and “that\n\nadmitting the expert testimony will actually assist the factfinder in deciding this case.”\n\n       Dr. Coons then testified before the jury and, in response to a lengthy hypothetical\n\nsetting out the salient features of appellant’s life and crimes, opined that there was a\n\nprobability that appellant would commit future acts of violence.\n\nB.     Legal Principles Concerning the Admission of Expert Psychiatric or\n       Psychological Testimony Concerning Future Dangerousness.\n\n       The admission of expert testimony is reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion.32\n\nHowever, trial judges must act as a true “gatekeeper” when addressing the reliability and\n\nrelevance of expert testimony.33 In Daubert, the United States Supreme Court held that when\n\nthe subject of the expert’s testimony is “scientific knowledge,” the basis of his testimony\n\nmust be grounded in the accepted methods and procedures of science.34 As that court\n\nexplained,\n\n       [I]n order to qualify as “scientific knowledge,” an inference or assertion must\n       be derived by the scientific method. Proposed testimony must be supported by\n       appropriate validation–i.e., “good grounds,” based on what is known. In short,\n\n       32\n         Lagrone v.

And have the predictions\n\nbased upon those factors been verified as accurate over time? 67 Some of Dr. Coons’s factors\n\nhave great intuitive appeal to jurors and judges,68 but are they actually accurate predictors of\n\nfuture behavior? Dr. Coons forthrightly stated that “he does it his way” with his own\n\nmethodology and has never gone back to see whether his prior predictions of future\n\ndangerousness have, in fact, been accurate. Although he had interviewed appellant before\n\nthe first trial in 1990, Dr. Coons had lost his notes of that interview in a flood and apparently\n\nhad no independent memory of that interview. He relied entirely upon the documentary\n\n\nby Dr. Coons about appellant, and it may be a valid assessment of a person who would likely be\n“dangerous” in the future, but there is nothing in this record that shows Dr. Coons relied upon the\nprinciples and methodology of Dr. Kozol or his colleagues.\n       67\n          “One study of capital murderers commuted as a result of the Furman decision found\nthat 188 murderers were paroled by the end of 1987, serving an average of 5.3 years in the\noutside community. Only one killed again, for a rate of .1% committing repeat homicides per\nyear. Six of the 188 committed violent offenses, resulting in a violent recidivism rate of .6% per\nyear.” Jonathan R.

One does not know whether any psychiatric expert predicted that some or all of these\ncapital murderers would constitute a future danger.\n       68\n          If these factors are not scientifically appropriate ones for predicting future violence,\nthen their intuitive appeal is doubly dangerous as the jury might accept such testimony\nuncritically.

And, as noted\n\nabove, it was some of that independent evidence that the jury requested to see during its\n\ndeliberations.

That’s the problem with not knowing the literature, without knowing\n       anything about the scientific studies that have been done in this area is then\n       you have no idea whether the factors that you’re looking at are predictive of\n       anything or not.\n\nAccording to Dr. Cunningham, if “what you’re doing is basing it on your own gut and you\n\nhaven’t done anything to check whether your gut reaction is correct or not, then your\n\naccuracy level never improves.”\n\n       He pointed to appellant’s first trial as an example of the “tea-leaf-reader” school of\n\nsubjective clinical assessments. In that trial, Dr. James Grigson,85 who used the same\n\n\n       84\n           The American Psychiatric Association’s 1974 Task Force report concluded,\n        Predictions of “dangerousness” are judgments of a “relative risk” sort, statements\n        of comparative probabilities that are usually quite low. All that may be\n        reasonably concluded in most cases is that in the clinician’s experience, and from\n        his knowledge of the literature, some persons are at a comparatively higher risk\n        for future violence than are others.\nAPA Task Force Report, supra note 63 at 31. As Judge Johnson has noted in this same context,\n        A probability that a single individual will engage in a given behavior does not\n        exist. The probability that does exist is the likelihood that a person like that\n        individual will engage in a given behavior. . . . The proceedings in capital trials\n        are on much more stable ground if the future-dangerousness witnesses are\n        questioned about the probability of future violence by a person who is like the\n        defendant in, for example, background, criminal history, mental status, and\n        demonstrated propensity for violence against others.\nAllen v.

Dr. Coons, using that very same methodology and\n\nfacts concerning appellant, came to exactly the opposite conclusion.86 Dr. Cunningham also\n\ntold the jury that the major psychological associations had criticized Dr. Coons and his\n\nmethodology as “unreliable and inconsistent with the standard of practice.” In sum, Dr.\n\nCunningham refuted Dr. Coon’s expertise and the whole “tea-leaf-reader” notion of clinical\n\npsychiatric predictions of future dangerousness.\n\n       Furthermore, the prosecution did not rely heavily upon Dr. Coons’s testimony during\n\nits closing arguments. Instead, the prosecutor emphasized his position that appellant was\n\nexactly the same person that he was when he killed Karen’s parents and her brother back in\n\n1989. He had not changed a bit.87 The prosecutor then went on to recount evidence from the\n\n\n       86\n         Dr. Cunningham concluded,\n       Both of those represent absurd unreliable conclusions based on a completely\n       unreliable method. That’s the benefit of using a subjective unreliable method is\n       whatever case you go into you can say whatever you want, because it’s based on\n       reading tea leaves.\n       87\n          The prosecutor’s theory was that “[t]his is the same person 20 years later exactly.\nThere is no difference.” He explained,\n       The evidence in this case, the evidence presented to you from the witness stand\n       here and testified to shows that he has no remorse. He had no remorse on August\n       29, 1989, when he individually killed three people and then kidnapped Karen\n       Vicha and told her all about what he’d done. He had no sorrow in that at all. And\n       he–he simply–he doesn’t have it. It’s not here. It’s not within him. And what did\n       he do later after the unspeakable horror that he inflicted on her? There was a\n       hearing in this court ten years later and she was sitting out there in the audience.\n       This man turned and was glaring at her, giving her an evil smile ten years later\n       after slaughtering her family and giving her heartache that lasts for a life. He’s\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 42\n\nmurders themselves and appellant’s bragging to Karen afterwards. The prosecutor then\n\nturned to the topic of predicting future dangerousness:\n\n               Can we predict a person’s future? Well, we absolutely can. You heard\n       what Dr. Hodges said. He made an analysis of it. He talked about how he had\n       a dislike of women, how he had a low opinion of them. Did he? His conduct\n       was absolutely borne out. And Dr. Hodges said the prognosis is poor, and it\n       was, because this person ultimately cares only about himself.\n\nHe then recounted how Bobby’s fellow officer had predicted that appellant would commit\n\nsome violent act after he had been arrested for kidnapping Karen before the murders. He\n\nthen turned briefly to Dr. Coons:\n\n       Dr. Coons examined–first he talked to [appellant] personally before the first\n       trial in 1990. He interviewed him, then he gave his assessment of him. And\n       the assessment is–sure, you deal with medical predictions and the training of\n       psychiatrists–but it’s just common sense. If you don’t have a conscience and\n       you’ve committed dangerous violent acts and you’ve shown that you have no\n       regard for human beings in any form unless it’s something that serves you, of\n       course, there’s a probability that you will commit criminal acts of violence.\n\nThe prosecutor then referred to appellant’s expert psychologist, Dr. Cunningham, and how\n\n\n\n       grinning at her. Is that any remorse? Ten years later he’s the same person that did\n       the killing.\n                And then in the courtroom during the trial last week, she told you that\n       when she–after she burst into tears and was sobbing and looked at him, as you\n       saw her do, he gave her the same smile. I got you. I hurt you. Folks, this is the\n       same man that committed those murders.\n                What’s another thing we can prove? He has the same unnatural\n       attachment to young girls that he did when he was out in the free world molesting\n       them. You’ve heard that testimony. You’ve heard what he did. There’s no\n       questioning the evidence about that. And so now, what does he do in his jail cell?\n       He’s got pictures of–not pinups of 30-year-old women from Playboy. He’s got\n       pictures of young girls in various gymnast positions. He is the same person that\n       was a molester and a murderer back on August 29, 1989.\n\f                                                                                  Coble     Page 43\n\nhe had called Karen biased for saying that appellant twice gave her an evil grin in two\n\ndifferent court appearances. The prosecutor then returned to his theme of appellant’s lack\n\nof conscience and how he had simply been restrained, not changed, in prison.\n\n       The defense, in its closing argument, quickly focused on the future dangerousness\n\nissue as well. Counsel argued that the statistical evidence that Dr. Cunningham had\n\npresented made it very difficult for the prosecution to prove that appellant would commit\n\nfuture acts of violence. He compared the two experts:\n\n       I want to talk about Dr. Coons versus Dr. Cunningham, because it really does\n       sort of come down to Dr. Coons versus Dr. Cunningham. Dr. Coons is a\n       likable guy. Dr. Coons does an excellent job of testifying. He seems to have\n       a lot of horse sense. Okay. He seems to have a lot of common sense. That’s\n       totally true. Dr. Cunningham is extremely long-winded. Okay. He has a hard\n       time sort of answering a question directly. I recognize those facts. But that’s\n       because he is a scientist.88 All right. And Dr. Cunningham talked about being\n       a scientist and what that means. What that means is, I don’t just look at the\n       evidence and make a wild guess. Okay. I’m not a tea-leaf reader. I’m not a\n       guy who says, well, I’m just going to depend on my–my experience and say\n       this person is a future danger–okay–without going back and checking my\n       work, without quantifying things, without being able to say, you know, I’m\n       correct to this certain quantum of correctness. . . . So he’s a scientist. A\n       scientist comes up with an idea, a theory. Okay. He tests that theory. He\n       doesn’t just test the theory, but he also gives his data to other scientists to look\n       at, so they can test his theory. Then he goes back and double-checks his work.\n       Then he thinks, now, maybe there’s a weakness in my own argument that I’ve\n       already made. Let’s go back and double-check that weakness and see it that\n       changes our numbers or does that reinforce our numbers. All right. So that’s\n       what a scientist is supposed to do.\n                Do you remember Dr. Coons’s testimony? Dr. Coons, do you check\n\n\n       88\n         Defense counsel had already explained why he had called Dr. Cunningham: “Because\nDr. Cunningham is the leading scientist in this field. All right. Out of every scientist who is\nlooking at these numbers, out of every scientist who is studying this issue, he’s the leading guy.”\n\f                                                                               Coble    Page 44\n\n       your work? Not really. Dr. Coons, do you remember going back and looking\n       at the records of people that you have predicted are going to be a future danger\n       to see if they really were? Well, I’m sure I’ve done it, but I can’t tell you who\n       I’ve done it with. In other words, he’s a guy who is completely uninterested\n       in whether he’s correct or not. . . .\n               . . . How can he ever get better? How can he establish for the jury that\n       his opinion is reliable? He can’t because he’s not a scientist. He’s a tea-leaf\n       reader.\n\n       The defense then recapped Dr. Cunningham’s testimony which had been that appellant\n\nposed an extremely low risk of committing future acts of violence because (1) he is well-\n\nadjusted to institutional life; (2) he is sixty years old and thus has “aged out” of his violent\n\nyears; (3) he has performed many positive acts and developed a positive attitude toward\n\nfellow inmates; (4) he is serving a very long sentence and “40 years of tests” show that long-\n\nterm inmates are statistically less likely to commit acts of aggression than are “short-\n\ntermers;” (5) he has a GED and additional work certificates; and (6) he has continuing family\n\nties to the community. All of these factors are supported by “the numbers that exist in reality.\n\nThese are the official numbers. So he’s not making up the numbers. He’s a scientist. He’s\n\njust reporting what the data is.”       The defense concluded its discussion of “future\n\ndangerousness,” with the statement that “Dr. Cunningham’s conclusions are very appropriate\n\nand very reasonable and scientific and provable as opposed to Dr. Coons’s conclusions,\n\nwhich are nonscientific and not provable. Okay. And even if they were provable, he hasn’t\n\nbothered to go out and try to prove them.” Counsel then moved on to the mitigation issue\n\nand appellant’s miserable childhood and youth.\n\n       During his final argument, the prosecutor mentioned Dr. Coons very briefly by\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 45\n\nreminding the jury that another psychiatrist, Dr. Hodges, had talked to appellant back in 1964\n\nand “he looked at him and listened to his answers” and reached the conclusion that appellant\n\nwas “extremely hostile to women, very low opinion of women, has poor control, very low\n\nself-esteem. Projects a great deal of responsibility for his own actions on other people. It\n\nwas Karen’s fault that she got kidnapped. It was Karen’s fault because she stood up to him.\n\nAnd it ruined his life. So it was her fault. And he had to extract revenge on her and he did\n\nit in the most brutal, the most selfish way he possibly could.” The prosecutor then referred\n\nto the military doctor’s assessment from 1967, with both doctors reaching the “same common\n\nsense assessment” of appellant.\n\n       Based upon the complete record of this case, we find that the error in admitting Dr.\n\nCoons’s testimony did not affect appellant’s substantial right to a fair sentencing hearing\n\nbecause\n\n(1)    There was ample other evidence supporting a finding that there was a\n       probability that appellant would commit future acts of violence;89\n\n       89\n          See Motilla v.

Merillat’s Testimony\n\n       In his sixth point of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred in admitting the\n\ntestimony of A.P. Merillat, an investigator for the Special Prosecution Unit, about the Texas\n\nprison classification system and violence in prison. Appellant argues that: (1) Mr. Merillat’s\n\ntestimony was irrelevant as it did not relate to appellant personally, and (2) this witness\n\ntestified to information that was already common knowledge among jurors. The State argues\n\nthat Mr. Merillat’s rebuttal testimony was relevant to refute Dr. Cunningham’s statistical data\n\nand to impeach the accuracy of his “low risk” future dangerousness prediction.93 We agree\n\nthat Mr. Merillat’s testimony was admissible as rebuttal “educator-expert” evidence.\n\n       On voir dire, Mr. Merillat stated that his testimony is based on his specialized\n\nknowledge of Texas prisons and prison violence during his nineteen years as a criminal\n\ninvestigator with the Special Prosecution Unit. He proposed to testify concerning the under-\n\nreporting of prison violence in official data compilations, the prison classification system,\n\nand the opportunities for violence inside prison.\n\n       The trial judge allowed Mr. Merillat’s testimony, although he granted appellant’s\n\nmotion in limine to avoid mention of any specific instances of misconduct by other inmates\n\n\noffense itself was particularly brutal; (3) after the murder, the defendant bragged that he would\nkill again; and (4) the State did not emphasize the documents during closing argument).\n       93\n          In the trial court, the State noted, “We have all of these statistics that Dr. Cunningham\nrelied upon and we have a right to show that there’s a substantial reason to believe that they may\nbe inaccurate.”\n\f                                                                                    Coble     Page 48\n\nexcept for one anecdote concerning an inmate’s forced starvation death which served as “a\n\ngreat example for underreporting of violence.”\n\n       Mr. Merillat then testified before the jury about the inmate classification system and\n\nthe under-reporting of violence in prison. He also described administrative segregation and\n\nhow it is used as “punitive housing” for recalcitrant inmates. Mr. Merillat explained why the\n\nofficial prison statistics used by Dr. Cunningham are not completely reliable: (1) the prison\n\nreporting system does not match the penal code definitions of “violent” behavior;94 and (2)\n\nnot all incidents of inmate-on-inmate incidents of violence are reported. Finally, he told the\n\njury that, in the last few years, his unit had prosecuted 94 inmates who were serving life\n\nsentences for capital murder for both assaultive and non-assaultive felonies.\n\n       On cross-examination, Mr. Merillat agreed that he knew nothing about appellant\n\nexcept that his office had never prosecuted him. He agreed that he was not qualified to\n\nexpress any opinion regarding appellant’s “future dangerousness.” He also explained how\n\ndeath row inmates “had the run of the row” and could work in the garment factory when\n\ndeath row was in the Ellis Unit. Mr. Merillat agreed that the point of his testimony was that\n\nthere are abundant opportunities for inmates to be either violent or good, depending upon\n\ntheir own decisions.\n\n\n\n       94\n          For example, Mr. Merillat said that the official TDCJ statistics define serious assaults\non staff as only those that result in injuries requiring more than first aid. Thus, while the official\nprison data showed 78 serious assaults on staff for 2007, the Special Prosecution Unit prosecuted\n197 assaults against prison staff members.

In the first, Mr.\n\nMerillat was not offering his statement of the official prison data compilation of “78 serious\n\nstaff assaults” for the truth of the matter asserted–that there were 78 serious staff assaults in\n\nthe previous year. Quite the reverse. Mr. Merillat’s point was that the official number of 78\n\nwas significantly lower than the actual number of serious assaults and thus the official prison\n\nstatistics that Dr. Cunningham used as the basis for his expert opinion were inaccurate.101\n\nIn the second, the testimony concerning why assaults upon inmates aren’t reported “because\n\nby telling on the person who did it, they are going to be much worse off[,]” Mr. Merillat did\n\nnot disclose any out-of-court statement.102         He was simply explaining, as a general\n\nproposition, why inmates do not “snitch” on each other.

As soon as she had been sworn in, but before any questioning, she burst out, “Evil\n\npiece of shit.” The defense immediately responded: “Judge we object. Call for a mistrial.\n\nRequest an instruction to disregard. Call for a mistrial.” The Judge said, “I’ll instruct the\n\njury to disregard the last comment of the witness,” and Ms. Sawyer said, “Sorry.” When\n\nappellant then requested that she be excluded as a witness, the trial judge took a recess.107\n\n\n       106\n          While the jury was out, defense counsel explained what had happened:\n       We would like to note for the record that the last comment of the witness\n       was–was made with the witness in a very tearful state. What the witness did was\n       to turn in her chair, look directly at [appellant] and say something along the lines\n       of, I hate you for making me go through this. That was an unsolicited comment\n       not made in response to any of the Government’s questions. So at this time, we\n       would ask the Court to rule that’s an inadmissible statement and not relevant and\n       unfairly prejudicial and we would like to ask the Court to instruct the jury to dis–\n       disregard the last remark.\nThe prosecutor agreed that, although it was “spontaneous,” and “in response to the emotion of\nthe moment,” it would be appropriate to instruct the jury. The defense then asked for a mistrial,\nbased on Rule 403, the Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and the Eighth Amendment.\n       107\n            During the recess, appellant reiterated his objection under Rule 403 and stated, “I think\nit’s completely poisoned the jury, this display of emotion, something that not even the–the\ncomplainants–you know, the Vicha family did, I think the jury’s going to be unfairly influenced\nby that to the point that [appellant] now can’t get a fair trial.” The record reflects that the witness\nthen made a laughing sound. The trial judge said that he would instruct the jury to disregard the\ncomment, and he admonished the witness to answer only the questions that are asked and to “not\n\f                                                                                 Coble    Page 55\n\n         When the jury returned, Ms. Sawyer testified that appellant offered her a job at a\n\ndrive-in theater when she was 16. She had worked there for about two and a half weeks when\n\nappellant picked her up for work, but he took her to his house and raped her instead. She was\n\nso scared that she had never told anyone, except her sister, about this experience.

In the first instance, the prosecutor agreed\n\nwith the correctness of an instruction to disregard and, in the second, he did not attempt to\n\njustify Ms. Sawyer’s outburst.118 The trial judge immediately instructed the jury to disregard\n\n\n\n\n       113\n             Id. at 828.\n       114\n             Id. at 828-29.\n       115\n          Id. at 830 (“The persistent appeals in the face of adverse rulings speak loudly of the\nprosecutor’s desire to use the outburst for inflammatory purposes.”).\n       116\n             Id. at 830-31.\n       117\n             Id. at 826-27.\n       118\n          Ms. Sawyer could charitably be called a “feisty” witness, and both the prosecutor and\ndefense had difficulty controlling her nonresponsive answers. She was quickly excused.\n\f                                                                                Coble    Page 58\n\nthose outbursts, and we must presume that the jurors followed these instructions.119 The\n\nprosecution did not refer to, or attempt to capitalize upon, the outbursts during closing\n\narguments. Furthermore, they occurred during the sentencing stage of a capital murder trial,\n\nnot the guilt stage as in Stahl. At the punishment hearing, evidence of the defendant’s\n\ncharacter is both relevant and admissible as is the opinion testimony concerning good or bad\n\ncharacter traits by those who know him.120 Obviously, character evidence must be offered\n\nin a proper form and be responsive to specific questions, so these outbursts were not proper,\n\nbut their potential for prejudice was less than had they occurred during the guilt phase of a\n\ntrial.\n\n         Because we conclude that nothing in the record suggests that the outbursts were of\n\nsuch a nature that the jury could not follow the trial judge’s instructions to disregard them,121\n\nwe overrule appellant’s points of error nine and ten.\n\n                 The Admission of the Hearsay Statement by a Witness’s Sister\n\n         In his eleventh point of error, appellant claims that the trial judge erred in admitting\n\nAmy Zuniga’s testimony that her sister, Karen, told her that appellant was looking in her\n\nbedroom window as she was dressing.

We\n\nconclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that Karen’s out-of-court\n\nstatement was admissible as an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.122\n\n       Amy Zuniga testified that appellant was her uncle and, when she was young, she\n\nthought he was a model of how a parent should be because he was so nice to his own son.\n\nHowever, Amy changed her mind about appellant when she was fifteen. She explained that\n\none day she was sitting in a rocking chair in her nightgown, when appellant came in and\n\npulled her legs apart; then he made “a vulgar display like he was licking me” between her\n\nlegs. After that, she avoided him. But right before appellant moved into Amy’s mother’s\n\nhome shortly before the murders, Amy came out of the shower and was changing her clothes\n\nin her bedroom when she heard a “commotion from the kitchen, a beating on the window.”\n\nThen Karen ran through Amy’s bedroom door from the kitchen, went outside through her\n\nback bedroom door, and started yelling. Amy peeked out through the curtains and saw\n\nappellant driving off in his truck. Then Karen came back inside, “very mad and frustrated.\n\nShe was red, angry.” Karen told Amy that she had seen appellant outside looking through\n\nthe curtains as Amy was dressing.\n\n       The trial judge admitted Karen’s out-of-court statement to Amy based on it being both\n\nan excited utterance and a present sense impression. We need examine its admissibility only\n\nunder the excited utterance exception. An excited utterance is a statement that relates to a\n\n\n\n       122\n       T     EX . R. EVID .   803(2).\n\f                                                                               Coble    Page 60\n\nstartling event or condition, and it is made when the declarant is still under the stress of\n\nexcitement caused by the event or condition.123\n\n       Appellant contends that Karen’s statement was not admissible as an excited utterance\n\nbecause there was no showing that she was in the “grip of violent emotion, excitement or\n\npain.” 124 She was angry, not excited. The critical question, however, is not the specific type\n\nof emotion that the declarant is dominated by–anger, fear, happiness–but whether the\n\ndeclarant was still dominated by the emotion caused by the startling event when she spoke.125\n\nAppellant also argues that Karen’s statement was not admissible because there was no\n\nindependent evidence of the startling event–appellant’s “Peeping Tom” conduct. Appellant\n\ncites to a Texas Supreme Court case, Richardson v. Green,126 which applied the common-law\n\n“res gestae” rule. But Rule 803(2) changed the common law; the current rule does not\n\nrequire independent evidence of the exciting event before the trial judge may admit the\n\n\n\n       123\n           Id.; see McCarty v.
