PARKER,\n\n         Plaintiff,\n\n                v.                                          Civil Action No. 15-1070 (JEB)\n\n UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF\n JUSTICE, OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL\n RESPONSIBILITY,\n\n          Defendant.\n\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       News reports that a former Assistant United States Attorney in Arkansas had represented\n\nthe United States in court despite lacking a valid license to practice law got Plaintiff Lonnie J.\n\nParker’s attention. See ECF No. 10-3 (Declaration of Lonnie J. Parker), ¶ 3. Wanting to\n\nunderstand how the AUSA had been hired and permitted to litigate on behalf of the United\n\nStates, and whether such misconduct could be prevented moving forward, Parker submitted a\n\nFreedom of Information Act request to Defendant, the Department of Justice’s Office of\n\nProfessional Responsibility. After OPR initially told Plaintiff it would neither confirm nor deny\n\nthe existence of responsive records, he administratively appealed and eventually filed suit here.\n\nDefendant then changed course and agreed to produce all non-exempt material. It released some\n\nrecords to Plaintiff and referred others to three different DOJ components for disclosure\n\ndecisions. The parties have now cross-moved for summary judgment, and the Court sides with\n\nthe government on all but one issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fI.     Background\n\n       In February 2014, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to OPR, seeking records “regarding\n\nany investigation or consideration of disciplinary actions involving the unauthorized practice of\n\nlaw by former Assistant U.S. Attorney Lesa Gail Bridges Jackson . . . .” ECF No. 23-1, Exh. D\n\nat 1. OPR, which investigates allegations of improper conduct by DOJ attorneys, see 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 0.39a, initially resisted disclosure. It issued a Glomar response, thereby refusing to confirm or\n\ndeny the existence of any records responsive to Plaintiff’s request. See ECF No. 7-2\n\n(Declaration of Ginae Barnett), ¶¶ 6, 14-15 and Exh. C. After Plaintiff exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies, id., Exh. D, he filed suit in July 2015, alleging that Defendant had\n\nviolated FOIA by failing to provide all non-exempt responsive records and failing to undertake\n\nan adequate search. See ECF No. 1 (Complaint), ¶¶ 21-22.\n\n       Before answering, OPR moved for summary judgment, explaining that because it\n\nbelieved that DOJ had not officially acknowledged an investigation into Bridges Jackson, OPR’s\n\nGlomar response was appropriate. See ECF No. 7 at 4-7. Plaintiff then filed his own summary-\n\njudgment motion and supporting materials, through which OPR learned that the Executive Office\n\nfor United States Attorneys, another DOJ component, had in fact already revealed, through a\n\ndocument previously released to Plaintiff, that OPR had investigated Bridges Jackson. See ECF\n\nNo. 14 at 1-2. OPR accordingly withdrew its Glomar response and summary-judgment motion\n\nand agreed to release to Parker all non-exempt records and to provide a Vaughn Index describing\n\nits withholdings. Id. The Court thus denied without prejudice as moot Plaintiff’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment. See Minute Order of Nov. 3, 2015.\n\n       Ginae Barnett, a Government Information Specialist with OPR, then processed Parker’s\n\nFOIA request and identified 251 pages of responsive documents. See ECF No. 23-1 (Revised\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fThird Declaration of Ginae Barnett), ¶¶ 1, 7. OPR released 18 pages in their entirety and,\n\npursuant to Exemptions 5, 6, and 7(C), withheld 20 pages in part and 149 pages in full. It also\n\nreferred 64 pages to other DOJ components — specifically, 56 to EOUSA, 6 to the Justice\n\nManagement Division, and 2 to the Office of Information Policy — for processing and direct\n\nresponse to Parker. Id., ¶¶ 8-13. OPR then prepared a Vaughn Index containing a description of\n\nthe 20 pages that it had withheld in part and the 149 pages that it had withheld in full, along with\n\nthe applicable FOIA exemption(s). Id., Exh. C.\n\n       Having produced some records, withheld others, and referred a portion to other DOJ\n\ncomponents, OPR believes it has satisfied its FOIA obligations and now renews its Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment. See ECF No. 23 (Def. Mot.). Parker, conversely, has filed a Cross-Motion\n\nto the same effect. See ECF No. 27 (Pl. Mot.). After reviewing the briefing, the Court ordered\n\nOPR to provide four documents for in camera review. See Minute Order of Sept. 26, 2016. The\n\nagency complied, see ECF No. 31, and, having reviewed the documents, the Court now proceeds\n\nto address the parties’ contentions.\n\nII.    Legal Standard\n\n       Summary judgment may be granted if “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). A fact is “material” if it is capable of affecting the substantive outcome of the litigation.\n\nSee Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A dispute is “genuine” if the\n\nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. See Scott\n\nv. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007); Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248. “A party asserting that a\n\nfact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion” by “citing to particular parts\n\nof materials in the record” or “showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fpresence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to\n\nsupport the fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating\n\nthe absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323\n\n(1986). In the event of conflicting evidence on a material issue, the Court is to construe the\n\nconflicting evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Sample v. Bureau\n\nof Prisons, 466 F.3d 1086, 1087 (D.C. Cir. 2006).\n\n       FOIA cases typically and appropriately are decided on motions for summary judgment.\n\nSee Brayton v. Office of U.S. Trade Rep., 641 F.3d 521, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2011). In a FOIA case, a\n\ncourt may grant summary judgment based solely on information provided in an agency’s\n\naffidavits or declarations when they “describe the justifications for nondisclosure with\n\nreasonably specific detail, demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the\n\nclaimed exemption, and are not controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by\n\nevidence of agency bad faith.” Larson v. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 862 (D.C. Cir. 2009)\n\n(citation omitted). “Unlike the review of other agency action that must be upheld if supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence and not arbitrary or capricious, the FOIA expressly places the burden ‘on\n\nthe agency to sustain its action’ and directs the district courts to ‘determine the matter de novo.’”\n\nDep’t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for the Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 755 (1989)\n\n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B)).\n\nIII.   Analysis\n\n       Congress enacted FOIA in order “to pierce the veil of administrative secrecy and to open\n\nagency action to the light of public scrutiny.” Dep’t of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361\n\n(1976) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “The basic purpose of FOIA is to ensure an\n\ninformed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society, needed to check against\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fcorruption and to hold the governors accountable to the governed.” John Doe Agency v. John\n\nDoe Corp., 493 U.S. 146, 152 (1989) (citation omitted). The statute provides that “each agency,\n\nupon any request for records which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is made in\n\naccordance with published rules . . . shall make the records promptly available to any person.” 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A). Consistent with this statutory mandate, federal courts have jurisdiction to\n\norder the production of records that an agency improperly withholds. See id. § 552(a)(4)(B);\n\nReporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 754-55. “At all times courts must bear in mind that FOIA\n\nmandates a ‘strong presumption in favor of disclosure.’” Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v.\n\nNorton, 309 F.3d 26, 32 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Dep’t of State v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164, 173\n\n(1991)).\n\n       As previously noted, the parties have cross-moved for summary judgment. In the course\n\nof the briefing, they have helpfully narrowed the issues remaining in dispute to three: (1)\n\nWhether Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law because Defendant filed a\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment instead of an Answer; (2) Whether Defendant properly withheld\n\nportions of four documents pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C); and (3) Whether OPR has\n\nsatisfied its FOIA obligations in regard to the documents referred to EOUSA. Before addressing\n\nthese in turn, the Court notes that Plaintiff does not challenge the adequacy of the search or the\n\napplicability of Exemption 5 to any of the records at issue. The Court thus need not discuss\n\nthose topics.\n\n       A. MSJ vs. Answer\n\n       Plaintiff first asserts that because OPR did not file an Answer to his Complaint, but\n\ninstead filed only a Motion for Summary Judgment, it is deemed to have admitted all matters\n\nalleged, thus entitling Parker to summary judgment as a matter of law. See Pl. Mot. at 4-5.\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fPlaintiff cites no case law for this novel proposition; in fact, precedent cuts the other way. As\n\nanother judge in this district explained, “A defendant . . . is not required to respond in the form of\n\nan answer before making a motion for summary judgment, which may be made by a defending\n\nparty ‘at any time.’” Jones v. Dep’t of Justice, 601 F. Supp. 2d 297, 302 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(b)) (citing Hubicki v. ACF Indus., Inc., 484 F.2d 519, 522 (3d Cir. 1973);\n\nGifford v. Travelers Protective Ass’n of Am., 153 F.2d 209, 210-11 (9th Cir. 1946); 10A C.\n\nWright, A. Miller, M. Kane, Fed. Practice & Proc. 3d § 2718 (1998)); see also First Nat’l Bank\n\nof Ariz. v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 290, 292 n.20, 299 (1968) (affirming grant of\n\nsummary judgment to defendant who never filed answer during litigation spanning more than six\n\nyears); Koch v. Walter, 935 F. Supp. 2d 143, 147 n.3 (D.D.C. 2013) (rejecting plaintiff’s\n\nobjection to defendant’s filing motion for summary judgment instead of answer).\n\n       Plaintiff insists that Jones “merely [held] that a party may file a Summary Judgment\n\nMotion or Rule 12 Motion prior to filing an Answer in a civil action.” ECF No. 30 (Reply) at 3.\n\nNot so. Jones rejected the exact argument Plaintiff makes here — namely, that “because the\n\ndefendant did not file an answer denying the allegations in the complaint but instead filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, judgment should be awarded to plaintiff.” 601 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n302 (emphasis added). In so doing, Jones explained that “it is standard practice in FOIA cases\n\nfor the defendant to file a motion for summary judgment instead of filing a responsive pleading.”\n\nId. (emphasis added). Indeed, “[s]uch a practice is substantively no different than filing a motion\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) accompanied by matters outside the pleadings, which is then converted by\n\noperation of Rule 12(b) to one under Rule 56.” Id.\n\n       Defendant’s actions here, furthermore, were consistent with Orders from this Court.\n\nFollowing two requests for an extension of time to respond to Plaintiff’s Complaint, each of\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fwhich the Court granted, see Minute Orders of July 28, 2015, and Sept. 17, 2015, the Court\n\nordered that “Defendant shall answer or otherwise respond to the Complaint by September 21,\n\n2015.” Minute Order of Sept. 17, 2015 (emphasis added). In filing a Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment, Defendant “otherwise respond[ed] to the Complaint,” just as the Court directed.\n\n       Plaintiff’s procedural gambit thus fails to persuade.\n\n       B. Exemptions 6, 7(C)\n\n       Parker next objects to Defendant’s invocation of Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to withhold\n\nportions of four records — labeled as OPR-3, -4, -9, and -75. See Pl. Mot. at 9. These are the\n\ndocuments that the Court has now reviewed in camera. Before proceeding, it notes that because\n\nPlaintiff does not challenge OPR’s decision to rely on Exemption 5, the Court does not consider\n\nany sections of these documents withheld pursuant to that exemption, even if those portions were\n\nalso withheld pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C).\n\n       Exemption 6 protects “personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of\n\nwhich would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b)(6). Exemption 7(C) excludes “records of information compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes . . . to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information . . .\n\ncould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Id.,\n\n§ 552(b)(7)(C). These provisions require agencies and reviewing courts to “balance the privacy\n\ninterests that would be compromised by disclosure against the public interest in release of the\n\nrequested information.” Beck v. Dep’t of Justice, 997 F.2d 1489, 1491 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (quoting\n\nDavis v. Dep’t of Justice, 968 F.2d 1276, 1281 (D.C. Cir. 1992)).\n\n       Although Exemptions 6 and 7(C) both require agencies and reviewing courts to undertake\n\nthe same weighing of interests, the balance tilts more strongly toward nondisclosure in the\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fcontext of Exemption 7(C) because its “privacy language is broader than the comparable\n\nlanguage in Exemption 6 in two respects.” Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 756. First, Exemption\n\n6 encompasses only “clearly unwarranted” invasions of privacy, while Exemption 7(C) omits the\n\nadverb “clearly.” Id. Second, Exemption 6 prevents disclosures that “would constitute” an\n\ninvasion of privacy, while Exemption 7(C) targets any disclosures that “could reasonably be\n\nexpected to constitute” such an invasion. Id. These differences are the result of specific\n\namendments and reflect Congress’s conscious choice to provide greater protection to law-\n\nenforcement materials than to personnel, medical, and other similar files. Id. This Circuit,\n\naccordingly, has held that Exemption 7(C) “establishes a lower bar for withholding material”\n\nthan Exemption 6. See ACLU v. Dep’t of Justice, 655 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011); see also Beck,\n\n997 F.2d at 1491.\n\n               1. Law-Enforcement Purposes\n\n       If the withheld records were “compiled for law enforcement purposes,” the Court need\n\nonly address whether the agency has properly invoked Exemption 7(C); there is no requirement\n\nto consider the higher bar for withholding of Exemption 6. In determining if the records were\n\ncompiled for such purposes, “the focus is on how and under what circumstances the requested\n\nfiles were compiled, and whether the files sought relate to anything that can fairly be\n\ncharacterized as an enforcement proceeding.” Jefferson v. Dep’t of Justice, Office of Prof’l\n\nResponsibility, 284 F.3d 172, 176-77 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted). “[I]f [an] investigation is for a possible violation of law, then the inquiry is for law\n\nenforcement purposes, as distinct from customary surveillance of the performance of duties by\n\ngovernment employees.” Id. at 177.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f       The D.C. Circuit and this Court have previously held that OPR records relating to the\n\ninvestigation of an AUSA for possible violations of civil or criminal law are compiled for law-\n\nenforcement purposes. See Kimberlin v. Dep’t of Justice, 139 F.3d 944, 947-48 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1998); Bartko v. Dep’t of Justice, 128 F. Supp. 3d 62, 69-70 (D.D.C. 2015). The parties agree\n\nthat the records Plaintiff seeks here are likewise correctly considered records compiled for law-\n\nenforcement purposes. See Def. Mot. at 22; ECF No. 28 (Opposition) at 3. The Court thus will\n\nconsider only Exemption 7(C).\n\n               2. Private vs. Public Interest\n\n       The first step in the Exemption 7(C) analysis is to determine whether there is, in fact, a\n\nprivacy interest in the materials sought. See ACLU, 655 F.3d at 6. To constitute a privacy\n\ninterest under FOIA, the claimed interest must be “substantial.” Multi Ag Media LLC v. USDA,\n\n515 F.3d 1224, 1229-30 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see also Roth v. Dep’t of Justice, 642 F.3d 1161, 1174\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011). “[S]ubstantial,” however, “means less than it might seem. A substantial\n\nprivacy interest is anything greater than a de minimis privacy interest.” Multi Ag Media, 515\n\nF.3d at 1229-30.\n\n       In a typical case, it is well established that “individuals have an obvious privacy interest\n\ncognizable under Exemption 7(C) in keeping secret the fact that they were subjects of a law\n\nenforcement investigation.” Nation Magazine, Washington Bureau v. U.S. Customs Serv., 71\n\nF.3d 885, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1995); see also Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 767 (D.C. Cir. 1990)\n\n(“It is surely beyond dispute that ‘the mention of an individual’s name in a law enforcement file\n\nwill engender comment and speculation and carries a stigmatizing connotation.’”) (quoting\n\nBranch v. FBI, 658 F. Supp. 204, 209 (D.D.C. 1987)). “That privacy interest also extends to\n\nthird parties who may be mentioned in investigatory files, as well as to witnesses and informants\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fwho provided information during the course of an investigation.” Nation Magazine, 71 F.3d at\n\n894. “A government employee,” moreover, “has at least some privacy interest in his own\n\nemployment records, an interest that extends to ‘not having it known whether those records\n\ncontain or do not contain’ information on wrongdoing, whether that information is favorable or\n\nnot.” Beck, 997 F.2d at 1494 (quoting Dunkelberger v. Dep’t of Justice, 906 F.2d 779, 781\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1990)).\n\n       Those privacy interests, however, are not implicated by the disclosures requested here,\n\nParker contends, because Bridges Jackson’s misconduct and the fact of DOJ’s investigation have\n\nalready been made public through court documents, records released to Plaintiff’s counsel\n\npursuant to another FOIA request, and Associated Press news reports. See Pl. Mot. at 10 (citing\n\nECF No. 10-2 (Declaration of Daniel Stotter), Exhs. A, B, C; Parker Decl., ¶ 3 & Exhs. D, E).\n\nTogether, those documents reveal information about Bridges Jackson’s career, the nature of the\n\nmisconduct, and some of the subsequent consequences.\n\n       Specifically, they reveal where Bridges Jackson attended law school, when she received\n\nher licenses to practice law in Kentucky and Arkansas, where she worked prior to becoming an\n\nAUSA, and that she served as an AUSA in Arkansas from 1989 to 2001. See ECF No. 10-2,\n\nExh. A at 1-3. They also disclose that Bridges Jackson failed to pay her Kentucky and Arkansas\n\nbar-association dues, that her licenses therefore were administratively suspended in 1987 and\n\n1989, that she did not disclose those suspensions to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and that, on the\n\ncontrary, she periodically provided the Office with certifications that she was an active member\n\nof both bars. Id. at 3-4; ECF No. 10-3, Exh. D. Finally, those documents show that DOJ began\n\ninvestigating Bridges Jackson’s license status in 2001, that she thereafter resigned her position as\n\nan AUSA and agreed to surrender her Arkansas law license, see ECF No. 10-2, Exh. A at 4, that\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fDOJ’s investigation triggered a Complaint by the Inquiry Commission in Kentucky alleging\n\nprofessional misconduct, and that Bridges Jackson admitted guilt and moved for a two-year\n\nsuspension from the practice of law, which the Kentucky Supreme Court granted in 2011. See\n\nECF No. 10-2, Exh. B at 2.\n\n       These public documents “undoubtedly . . . diminish [Bridges Jackson’s] interest in\n\nprivacy: the public already knows who [she] is, what [she] was accused of,” and the sanctions\n\nincurred. See Kimberlin, 139 F.3d at 949. But further details pertinent to substantial privacy\n\ninterests remain as yet undisclosed. The information withheld in OPR-3, -4, -9, and -75 includes\n\ndetails about how Bridges Jackson misrepresented her status as an active bar member and about\n\ninternal disciplinary actions considered or taken in response. OPR-9 also lists the names of OPR\n\nnon-attorney employees. See Third Barnett Decl., ¶ 27. And OPR-75, OPR’s report of its\n\ninvestigation into Bridges Jackson’s conduct, describes information relating to her work as an\n\nAUSA separate from the bar-membership issues, including evaluations by her supervisor, and\n\nother personal information relating to her work history.\n\n       In this respect, the instant case is much like the dispute in Kimberlin. There, the AUSA\n\ninvestigated by OPR made a statement to the press that revealed his identity, “what he was\n\naccused of, and that he received a relatively mild sanction.” 139 F.3d at 949. The Court of\n\nAppeals nonetheless concluded that he still retained a substantial privacy interest “in avoiding\n\ndisclosure of the details of the investigation [and] of his misconduct,” as such disclosure “could\n\nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of [his] personal privacy.” Id. It\n\nfurther noted that individuals other than the AUSA whose names appeared in the records\n\n“retain[ed] a strong privacy interest in not being associated with an investigation involving\n\nprofessional misconduct.” Id. For the same reasons, the Court so concludes here: Bridges\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fJackson and the other named individuals retain substantial privacy interests in the withheld\n\nrecords.\n\n       The Court must balance that substantial privacy interest against the public interest in\n\nreleasing the records. In this analysis, the public interest is limited to FOIA’s core purpose of\n\n“shed[ding] light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties.” Reporters Comm., 489\n\nU.S. at 773. Courts, moreover, must distinguish between the public interest that can generally\n\nexist in a subject that relates to a FOIA request and the public interest that might or might not be\n\nserved by disclosure of the specific records that are responsive to a given request. See Elec.\n\nPrivacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep’t of Defense, 355 F. Supp. 2d 98, 102 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that fact\n\nthat a plaintiff has provided evidence “that there is some media interest in data mining as an\n\numbrella issue does not satisfy the requirement that Plaintiff demonstrate interest in the specific\n\nsubject of Plaintiff’s FOIA request”). The key consideration is whether disclosure of the records\n\nat issue would serve an identified public interest and therefore warrant the overriding of personal\n\nprivacy. See Lopez v. EOUSA, 598 F. Supp. 2d 83, 89 (D.D.C. 2009) (holding that EOUSA’s\n\nVaughn Index demonstrates that disclosure of particular information withheld “is not likely to\n\nadvance any significant public interest, even if the plaintiff could establish that the public has a\n\nsignificant interest in the material he is seeking”); but see Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Secret\n\nServ., 579 F. Supp. 2d 151, 154 (D.D.C. 2008) (holding that disclosure of names of individuals\n\nrequesting White House access for visitors was not precluded under Exemption 7(C) because\n\nnames would shed light on why visitor came to White House).\n\n       Parker argues that the public interest favoring disclosure is great. He contends that\n\ndisclosure will “help[] the public to understand how the U.S. Attorney’s Office could have hired\n\nand retained an Assistant U.S. Attorney for many years, who was not licensed or authorized to\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fpractice law,” as well as to understand OPR’s response to the allegations, including its\n\ninvestigation and any subsequent policy recommendations to prevent similar problems from\n\nhappening again. See Parker Decl., ¶¶ 4-5. He further maintains that “the public has a very\n\nsignificant interest in knowing whether” AUSAs “are qualified and licensed to practice law”\n\nbecause if they are not, the interests of the United States, its agencies, and the public may be\n\nharmed. Id., ¶ 7.\n\n       The Court agrees that prosecutorial misconduct is “an undeniably serious issue.” Bartko,\n\n128 F. Supp. 3d at 71. But the Court’s in camera review of the specific records Plaintiff seeks\n\nconfirms that none “would reveal much, if anything, about systemic prosecutorial misconduct”\n\nrelated to the unauthorized practice of law or DOJ’s systemic efforts to prevent, identify, and/or\n\nrespond to misconduct, such that any public interest would outweigh the privacy interests of\n\nBridges Jackson and the named third parties. See id. at 72. OPR thus properly withheld the\n\nrecords under Exemption 7(C).\n\n               3. Segregability\n\n       FOIA requires that “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record . . . be provided to\n\nany person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b). Accordingly, “non-exempt portions of a document must be disclosed unless they are\n\ninextricably intertwined with exempt portions.” Mead Data Central, Inc. v. Dep’t of the Air\n\nForce, 566 F.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Still, an agency is not obligated to segregate non-\n\nexempt material if “the excision of exempt information would impose significant costs on the\n\nagency and produce an edited document with little informational value.” Neufeld v. IRS, 646\n\nF.2d 661, 666 (D.C. Cir. 1981), overruled on other grounds by Church of Scientology of\n\nCalifornia v. IRS, 792 F.2d 153 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Information that would have no meaning,\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\ftherefore, is not considered reasonably segregable. See Mead Data Center, Inc., 566 F.2d at 261\n\nn.55 (“A court may decline to order an agency to commit significant time and resources to the\n\nseparation of disjointed words, phrases or even sentences which taken separately or together\n\nhave minimal or no information content.”).\n\n        Plaintiff does not raise any specific complaints with OPR’s segregation decisions or\n\njustifications. He does, however, make a general request that the Court determine if OPR\n\n“properly applied its ‘segregability’ requirement to provide Plaintiff with all non-exempt\n\nportions” of OPR-3, -4, -9, and -75. See Pl. Mot. at 12. “In making a determination as to\n\nsegregability . . . a district court judge ‘may examine the contents of . . . agency records in\n\ncamera’ . . . . This Circuit has interpreted this language to give district court judges broad\n\ndiscretion in determining whether in camera review is appropriate” in run-of-the-mill cases.\n\nAm. Immigration Council v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 30 F. Supp. 3d 67, 80 (D.D.C. 2014)\n\n(quoting Armstrong v. Exec. Office of the President, 97 F.3d 575, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1996)); cf.\n\nACLU v. Dep’t of Defense, 628 F.3d 612, 626 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“In camera inspection is\n\nparticularly a last resort in national security situations . . . .”).\n\n        The Court has reviewed in camera the partially withheld documents to determine whether\n\nthey contain any material that can be reasonably segregated and disclosed “without\n\nunwarrantably impinging upon anyone’s privacy.” Kimberlin, 139 F.3d at 950. Having done so,\n\nthe Court is satisfied that there are no segregability problems. No additional portions of the\n\npartially redacted records need be released.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     14\n\f       C. Referred Documents\n\n       Finally, Plaintiff challenges “Defendant’s actions involving their referral of responsive\n\nrecords to the EOUSA.” Reply at 5. As he does not challenge OPR’s referrals to OIP and JMD,\n\nthe Court need not address those. Id.\n\n       DOJ’s regulations permit a component to “refer the responsibility for responding” to a\n\nrecords request when it “believes that a different component, agency, or other Federal\n\nGovernment office is best able to determine whether to disclose the record.” 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 16.4(d)(2)(i). Pursuant to that regulation, OPR referred 56 pages that had originated in\n\nEOUSA or a U.S. Attorney’s Office to EOUSA for processing and direct response to Parker.\n\nSee ECF No. 28-1 (Fourth Declaration of Ginae Barnett), ¶ 4. Plaintiff argued in his Cross-\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment, filed on June 24, 2016, that he had “not received any of the\n\nresponsive records to his February 6, 2014 FOIA request that DOJ OPR shipped off to EOUSA .\n\n. . , and . . . Defendant DOJ OPR has not provided any lawful basis for the continued withholding\n\nof any of those responsive records.” Pl. Mot. at 7. But, as OPR pointed out, see Opp. at 6-7,\n\nEOUSA has provided some of the responsive records. On February 9, 2016, EOUSA produced\n\n30 pages in full and, pursuant to Exemptions 5, 6, and 7(C), withheld 19 pages in part and 17\n\npages in full. See Fourth Barnett Decl., ¶ 5 & Exh. A. Because EOUSA had done so, OPR\n\ncontended, Plaintiff’s argument was moot. See Opp. at 7.\n\n       Plaintiff then recast the first part of his referral-related grievance in his Reply. He argued\n\nthat “OPR did not ever take any actions to independently review the EOUSA’s referral\n\ndetermination as to the records which the DOJ OPR located in OPR systems of records” and\n\n“therefore completely abdicated” and violated “its FOIA response duties.” Reply at 6. Although\n\nthat statement is somewhat confused, the Court understands Plaintiff to argue that OPR was\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fobligated by FOIA to review EOUSA’s decision to withhold some of the responsive records\n\nreferred to it.\n\n        Parker bases his position on McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), which\n\nexplained that “when an agency receives a FOIA request for ‘agency records’ in its possession, it\n\nmust take responsibility for processing the request. It cannot simply refuse to act on the ground\n\nthat the documents originated elsewhere.” Id. at 1110. But this Circuit later clarified that the\n\nagency receiving the initial request “may acquit itself [of the duty imposed] through a referral,\n\nprovided the referral does not lead to improper withholding.” Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv.,\n\n494 F.3d 1106, 1118 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Contrary to Parker’s position, therefore, a component\n\nneed not necessarily follow up on or independently review the disclosure decision of the\n\ncomponent, agency, or office to which it referred the records for decision. Whether the referring\n\nagency retains a duty to act depends on whether the referral resulted in an improper withholding.\n\n        Plaintiff’s second referral-related grievance — that OPR did not provide the legal bases\n\nfor withholding responsive records referred to EOUSA — goes to that question. See Pl. Mot. at\n\n7; Reply at 6-7. Notably, OPR never argues that Plaintiff must sue EOUSA to obtain the\n\nrequired explanations, so the Court will assume that OPR retains responsibility here for the\n\npropriety of the withholdings. Yet, as Plaintiff points out, OPR never provided a description of\n\nthe specific legal bases for EOUSA’s withholdings beyond the general citations to exemptions\n\ngiven in the form letter that accompanied EOUSA’s production. See Fourth Barnett Decl., ¶ 5 &\n\nExh. A. The Vaughn Index supplied by OPR discusses only pages it withheld; it does not\n\naddress EOUSA’s withholdings. See Third Barnett Decl., Exh. C at 1. An agency, however, has\n\nthe burden to establish that a claimed exemption applies. Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in\n\nWash. v. Dep’t of Justice, 746 F.3d 1082, 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2014). It “may carry that burden by\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\fsubmitting affidavits that ‘describe the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific\n\ndetail, demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption,\n\nand are not controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad\n\nfaith.’” Id. (quoting Larson v. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 862 (D.C. Cir. 2009)). Because\n\nOPR “does not assert that it has made any effort to ensure that” Parker received the explanations\n\nto which he is legally entitled, see Hall v. CIA, 668 F. Supp. 2d 172, 182 (D.D.C. 2009), it failed\n\nto carry its burden.\n\n       The Court, accordingly, will deny OPR’s Motion as to these EOUSA documents. After\n\nproviding an explanation to Plaintiff, unless he is satisfied, the agency shall renew its Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\nIt will grant Defendant’s Motion as to all issues except the referral of documents to EOUSA. A\n\nseparate Order so stating will issue this day.\n\n\n                                                      /s/ James E. Boasberg\n                                                      JAMES E.

PARKER,\n\n         Plaintiff,\n\n                v.                                          Civil Action No. 15-1070 (JEB)\n\n UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF\n JUSTICE, OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL\n RESPONSIBILITY,\n\n          Defendant.\n\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       News reports that a former Assistant United States Attorney in Arkansas had represented\n\nthe United States in court despite lacking a valid license to practice law got Plaintiff Lonnie J.\n\nParker’s attention. See ECF No. 10-3 (Declaration of Lonnie J. Parker), ¶ 3. Wanting to\n\nunderstand how the AUSA had been hired and permitted to litigate on behalf of the United\n\nStates, and whether such misconduct could be prevented moving forward, Parker submitted a\n\nFreedom of Information Act request to Defendant, the Department of Justice’s Office of\n\nProfessional Responsibility. After OPR initially told Plaintiff it would neither confirm nor deny\n\nthe existence of responsive records, he administratively appealed and eventually filed suit here.\n\nDefendant then changed course and agreed to produce all non-exempt material. It released some\n\nrecords to Plaintiff and referred others to three different DOJ components for disclosure\n\ndecisions. The parties have now cross-moved for summary judgment, and the Court sides with\n\nthe government on all but one issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fI.     Background\n\n       In February 2014, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to OPR, seeking records “regarding\n\nany investigation or consideration of disciplinary actions involving the unauthorized practice of\n\nlaw by former Assistant U.S. Attorney Lesa Gail Bridges Jackson . . . .” ECF No. 23-1, Exh. D\n\nat 1. OPR, which investigates allegations of improper conduct by DOJ attorneys, see 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 0.39a, initially resisted disclosure. It issued a Glomar response, thereby refusing to confirm or\n\ndeny the existence of any records responsive to Plaintiff’s request. See ECF No. 7-2\n\n(Declaration of Ginae Barnett), ¶¶ 6, 14-15 and Exh. C. After Plaintiff exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies, id., Exh. D, he filed suit in July 2015, alleging that Defendant had\n\nviolated FOIA by failing to provide all non-exempt responsive records and failing to undertake\n\nan adequate search. See ECF No. 1 (Complaint), ¶¶ 21-22.\n\n       Before answering, OPR moved for summary judgment, explaining that because it\n\nbelieved that DOJ had not officially acknowledged an investigation into Bridges Jackson, OPR’s\n\nGlomar response was appropriate. See ECF No. 7 at 4-7. Plaintiff then filed his own summary-\n\njudgment motion and supporting materials, through which OPR learned that the Executive Office\n\nfor United States Attorneys, another DOJ component, had in fact already revealed, through a\n\ndocument previously released to Plaintiff, that OPR had investigated Bridges Jackson. See ECF\n\nNo. 14 at 1-2. OPR accordingly withdrew its Glomar response and summary-judgment motion\n\nand agreed to release to Parker all non-exempt records and to provide a Vaughn Index describing\n\nits withholdings. Id. The Court thus denied without prejudice as moot Plaintiff’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment. See Minute Order of Nov. 3, 2015.\n\n       Ginae Barnett, a Government Information Specialist with OPR, then processed Parker’s\n\nFOIA request and identified 251 pages of responsive documents. See ECF No. 23-1 (Revised\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fThird Declaration of Ginae Barnett), ¶¶ 1, 7. OPR released 18 pages in their entirety and,\n\npursuant to Exemptions 5, 6, and 7(C), withheld 20 pages in part and 149 pages in full. It also\n\nreferred 64 pages to other DOJ components — specifically, 56 to EOUSA, 6 to the Justice\n\nManagement Division, and 2 to the Office of Information Policy — for processing and direct\n\nresponse to Parker. Id., ¶¶ 8-13. OPR then prepared a Vaughn Index containing a description of\n\nthe 20 pages that it had withheld in part and the 149 pages that it had withheld in full, along with\n\nthe applicable FOIA exemption(s). Id., Exh. C.\n\n       Having produced some records, withheld others, and referred a portion to other DOJ\n\ncomponents, OPR believes it has satisfied its FOIA obligations and now renews its Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment. See ECF No. 23 (Def. Mot.). Parker, conversely, has filed a Cross-Motion\n\nto the same effect. See ECF No. 27 (Pl. Mot.). After reviewing the briefing, the Court ordered\n\nOPR to provide four documents for in camera review. See Minute Order of Sept. 26, 2016. The\n\nagency complied, see ECF No. 31, and, having reviewed the documents, the Court now proceeds\n\nto address the parties’ contentions.\n\nII.    Legal Standard\n\n       Summary judgment may be granted if “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). A fact is “material” if it is capable of affecting the substantive outcome of the litigation.\n\nSee Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1986).

R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating\n\nthe absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v.

In the event of conflicting evidence on a material issue, the Court is to construe the\n\nconflicting evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Sample v. Bureau\n\nof Prisons, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1086</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1087 (D.C.

In a FOIA case, a\n\ncourt may grant summary judgment based solely on information provided in an agency’s\n\naffidavits or declarations when they “describe the justifications for nondisclosure with\n\nreasonably specific detail, demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the\n\nclaimed exemption, and are not controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by\n\nevidence of agency bad faith.” Larson v.

In the course\n\nof the briefing, they have helpfully narrowed the issues remaining in dispute to three: (1)\n\nWhether Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law because Defendant filed a\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment instead of an Answer; (2) Whether Defendant properly withheld\n\nportions of four documents pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C); and (3) Whether OPR has\n\nsatisfied its FOIA obligations in regard to the documents referred to EOUSA. Before addressing\n\nthese in turn, the Court notes that Plaintiff does not challenge the adequacy of the search or the\n\napplicability of Exemption 5 to any of the records at issue. The Court thus need not discuss\n\nthose topics.\n\n       A. MSJ vs. Answer\n\n       Plaintiff first asserts that because OPR did not file an Answer to his Complaint, but\n\ninstead filed only a Motion for Summary Judgment, it is deemed to have admitted all matters\n\nalleged, thus entitling Parker to summary judgment as a matter of law.

Jones rejected the exact argument Plaintiff makes here — namely, that “because the\n\ndefendant did not file an answer denying the allegations in the complaint but instead filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, judgment should be awarded to plaintiff.” 601 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n302 (emphasis added). In so doing, Jones explained that “it is standard practice in FOIA cases\n\nfor the defendant to file a motion for summary judgment instead of filing a responsive pleading.”\n\nId. (emphasis added). Indeed, “[s]uch a practice is substantively no different than filing a motion\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) accompanied by matters outside the pleadings, which is then converted by\n\noperation of Rule 12(b) to one under Rule 56.” Id.\n\n       Defendant’s actions here, furthermore, were consistent with Orders from this Court.\n\nFollowing two requests for an extension of time to respond to Plaintiff’s Complaint, each of\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fwhich the Court granted, see Minute Orders of July 28, 2015, and Sept. 17, 2015, the Court\n\nordered that “Defendant shall answer or otherwise respond to the Complaint by September 21,\n\n2015.” Minute Order of Sept. 17, 2015 (emphasis added). In filing a Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment, Defendant “otherwise respond[ed] to the Complaint,” just as the Court directed.\n\n       Plaintiff’s procedural gambit thus fails to persuade.\n\n       B. Exemptions 6, 7(C)\n\n       Parker next objects to Defendant’s invocation of Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to withhold\n\nportions of four records — labeled as OPR-3, -4, -9, and -75. See Pl. Mot. at 9. These are the\n\ndocuments that the Court has now reviewed in camera. Before proceeding, it notes that because\n\nPlaintiff does not challenge OPR’s decision to rely on Exemption 5, the Court does not consider\n\nany sections of these documents withheld pursuant to that exemption, even if those portions were\n\nalso withheld pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C).\n\n       Exemption 6 protects “personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of\n\nwhich would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b)(6). Exemption 7(C) excludes “records of information compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes . . . to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information . . .\n\ncould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Id.,\n\n§ 552(b)(7)(C). These provisions require agencies and reviewing courts to “balance the privacy\n\ninterests that would be compromised by disclosure against the public interest in release of the\n\nrequested information.” Beck v.

First, Exemption\n\n6 encompasses only “clearly unwarranted” invasions of privacy, while Exemption 7(C) omits the\n\nadverb “clearly.” Id. Second, Exemption 6 prevents disclosures that “would constitute” an\n\ninvasion of privacy, while Exemption 7(C) targets any disclosures that “could reasonably be\n\nexpected to constitute” such an invasion. Id. These differences are the result of specific\n\namendments and reflect Congress’s conscious choice to provide greater protection to law-\n\nenforcement materials than to personnel, medical, and other similar files. Id. This Circuit,\n\naccordingly, has held that Exemption 7(C) “establishes a lower bar for withholding material”\n\nthan Exemption 6. See ACLU v. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"613160\"><a href=\"/opinion/613160/american-civil-liberties-v-us-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">655</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (D.C.

Law-Enforcement Purposes\n\n       If the withheld records were “compiled for law enforcement purposes,” the Court need\n\nonly address whether the agency has properly invoked Exemption 7(C); there is no requirement\n\nto consider the higher bar for withholding of Exemption 6. In determining if the records were\n\ncompiled for such purposes, “the focus is on how and under what circumstances the requested\n\nfiles were compiled, and whether the files sought relate to anything that can fairly be\n\ncharacterized as an enforcement proceeding.” Jefferson v.

Circuit and this Court have previously held that OPR records relating to the\n\ninvestigation of an AUSA for possible violations of civil or criminal law are compiled for law-\n\nenforcement purposes. See Kimberlin v. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184504\"><a href=\"/opinion/184504/kimberlin-brett-c-v-doj/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 947-48 (D.C.

The parties agree\n\nthat the records Plaintiff seeks here are likewise correctly considered records compiled for law-\n\nenforcement purposes. See Def. Mot. at 22; ECF No. 28 (Opposition) at 3. The Court thus will\n\nconsider only Exemption 7(C).\n\n               2. Private vs. Public Interest\n\n       The first step in the Exemption 7(C) analysis is to determine whether there is, in fact, a\n\nprivacy interest in the materials sought. See ACLU, 655 F.3d at 6. To constitute a privacy\n\ninterest under FOIA, the claimed interest must be “substantial.” Multi Ag Media LLC v. USDA,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187093\"><a href=\"/opinion/187093/multi-ag-media-llc-v-department-of-agriculture/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1229-30 (D.C.

Cir. 2011). “[S]ubstantial,” however, “means less than it might seem. A substantial\n\nprivacy interest is anything greater than a de minimis privacy interest.” Multi Ag Media, 515\n\nF.3d at 1229-30.\n\n       In a typical case, it is well established that “individuals have an obvious privacy interest\n\ncognizable under Exemption 7(C) in keeping secret the fact that they were subjects of a law\n\nenforcement investigation.” Nation Magazine, Washington Bureau v.

Cir. 1990)).\n\n       Those privacy interests, however, are not implicated by the disclosures requested here,\n\nParker contends, because Bridges Jackson’s misconduct and the fact of DOJ’s investigation have\n\nalready been made public through court documents, records released to Plaintiff’s counsel\n\npursuant to another FOIA request, and Associated Press news reports. See Pl. Mot. at 10 (citing\n\nECF No. 10-2 (Declaration of Daniel Stotter), Exhs. A, B, C; Parker Decl., ¶ 3 & Exhs. D, E).\n\nTogether, those documents reveal information about Bridges Jackson’s career, the nature of the\n\nmisconduct, and some of the subsequent consequences.\n\n       Specifically, they reveal where Bridges Jackson attended law school, when she received\n\nher licenses to practice law in Kentucky and Arkansas, where she worked prior to becoming an\n\nAUSA, and that she served as an AUSA in Arkansas from 1989 to 2001. See ECF No. 10-2,\n\nExh. A at 1-3. They also disclose that Bridges Jackson failed to pay her Kentucky and Arkansas\n\nbar-association dues, that her licenses therefore were administratively suspended in 1987 and\n\n1989, that she did not disclose those suspensions to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and that, on the\n\ncontrary, she periodically provided the Office with certifications that she was an active member\n\nof both bars. Id. at 3-4; ECF No. 10-3, Exh. D. Finally, those documents show that DOJ began\n\ninvestigating Bridges Jackson’s license status in 2001, that she thereafter resigned her position as\n\nan AUSA and agreed to surrender her Arkansas law license, see ECF No. 10-2, Exh. A at 4, that\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fDOJ’s investigation triggered a Complaint by the Inquiry Commission in Kentucky alleging\n\nprofessional misconduct, and that Bridges Jackson admitted guilt and moved for a two-year\n\nsuspension from the practice of law, which the Kentucky Supreme Court granted in 2011. See\n\nECF No. 10-2, Exh. B at 2.\n\n       These public documents “undoubtedly . . . diminish [Bridges Jackson’s] interest in\n\nprivacy: the public already knows who [she] is, what [she] was accused of,” and the sanctions\n\nincurred. See Kimberlin, 139 F.3d at 949. But further details pertinent to substantial privacy\n\ninterests remain as yet undisclosed. The information withheld in OPR-3, -4, -9, and -75 includes\n\ndetails about how Bridges Jackson misrepresented her status as an active bar member and about\n\ninternal disciplinary actions considered or taken in response. OPR-9 also lists the names of OPR\n\nnon-attorney employees. See Third Barnett Decl., ¶ 27. And OPR-75, OPR’s report of its\n\ninvestigation into Bridges Jackson’s conduct, describes information relating to her work as an\n\nAUSA separate from the bar-membership issues, including evaluations by her supervisor, and\n\nother personal information relating to her work history.\n\n       In this respect, the instant case is much like the dispute in Kimberlin. There, the AUSA\n\ninvestigated by OPR made a statement to the press that revealed his identity, “what he was\n\naccused of, and that he received a relatively mild sanction.” 139 F.3d at 949. The Court of\n\nAppeals nonetheless concluded that he still retained a substantial privacy interest “in avoiding\n\ndisclosure of the details of the investigation [and] of his misconduct,” as such disclosure “could\n\nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of [his] personal privacy.” Id. It\n\nfurther noted that individuals other than the AUSA whose names appeared in the records\n\n“retain[ed] a strong privacy interest in not being associated with an investigation involving\n\nprofessional misconduct.” Id. For the same reasons, the Court so concludes here: Bridges\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fJackson and the other named individuals retain substantial privacy interests in the withheld\n\nrecords.\n\n       The Court must balance that substantial privacy interest against the public interest in\n\nreleasing the records. In this analysis, the public interest is limited to FOIA’s core purpose of\n\n“shed[ding] light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties.” Reporters Comm., 489\n\nU.S. at 773. Courts, moreover, must distinguish between the public interest that can generally\n\nexist in a subject that relates to a FOIA request and the public interest that might or might not be\n\nserved by disclosure of the specific records that are responsive to a given request.

He contends that\n\ndisclosure will “help[] the public to understand how the U.S. Attorney’s Office could have hired\n\nand retained an Assistant U.S. Attorney for many years, who was not licensed or authorized to\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fpractice law,” as well as to understand OPR’s response to the allegations, including its\n\ninvestigation and any subsequent policy recommendations to prevent similar problems from\n\nhappening again. See Parker Decl., ¶¶ 4-5. He further maintains that “the public has a very\n\nsignificant interest in knowing whether” AUSAs “are qualified and licensed to practice law”\n\nbecause if they are not, the interests of the United States, its agencies, and the public may be\n\nharmed. Id., ¶ 7.\n\n       The Court agrees that prosecutorial misconduct is “an undeniably serious issue.” Bartko,\n\n128 F. Supp. 3d at 71. But the Court’s in camera review of the specific records Plaintiff seeks\n\nconfirms that none “would reveal much, if anything, about systemic prosecutorial misconduct”\n\nrelated to the unauthorized practice of law or DOJ’s systemic efforts to prevent, identify, and/or\n\nrespond to misconduct, such that any public interest would outweigh the privacy interests of\n\nBridges Jackson and the named third parties. See id. at 72. OPR thus properly withheld the\n\nrecords under Exemption 7(C).\n\n               3. Segregability\n\n       FOIA requires that “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record . . . be provided to\n\nany person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b).

He does, however, make a general request that the Court determine if OPR\n\n“properly applied its ‘segregability’ requirement to provide Plaintiff with all non-exempt\n\nportions” of OPR-3, -4, -9, and -75. See Pl. Mot. at 12. “In making a determination as to\n\nsegregability . . . a district court judge ‘may examine the contents of . . . agency records in\n\ncamera’ . . . . This Circuit has interpreted this language to give district court judges broad\n\ndiscretion in determining whether in camera review is appropriate” in run-of-the-mill cases.\n\nAm.

Cir. 2011) (“In camera inspection is\n\nparticularly a last resort in national security situations . . . .”).\n\n        The Court has reviewed in camera the partially withheld documents to determine whether\n\nthey contain any material that can be reasonably segregated and disclosed “without\n\nunwarrantably impinging upon anyone’s privacy.” Kimberlin, 139 F.3d at 950. Having done so,\n\nthe Court is satisfied that there are no segregability problems. No additional portions of the\n\npartially redacted records need be released.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     14\n\f       C. Referred Documents\n\n       Finally, Plaintiff challenges “Defendant’s actions involving their referral of responsive\n\nrecords to the EOUSA.” Reply at 5. As he does not challenge OPR’s referrals to OIP and JMD,\n\nthe Court need not address those. Id.\n\n       DOJ’s regulations permit a component to “refer the responsibility for responding” to a\n\nrecords request when it “believes that a different component, agency, or other Federal\n\nGovernment office is best able to determine whether to disclose the record.” 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 16.4(d)(2)(i). Pursuant to that regulation, OPR referred 56 pages that had originated in\n\nEOUSA or a U.S. Attorney’s Office to EOUSA for processing and direct response to Parker.\n\nSee ECF No. 28-1 (Fourth Declaration of Ginae Barnett), ¶ 4. Plaintiff argued in his Cross-\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment, filed on June 24, 2016, that he had “not received any of the\n\nresponsive records to his February 6, 2014 FOIA request that DOJ OPR shipped off to EOUSA .\n\n. . , and . . . Defendant DOJ OPR has not provided any lawful basis for the continued withholding\n\nof any of those responsive records.” Pl. Mot. at 7. But, as OPR pointed out, see Opp. at 6-7,\n\nEOUSA has provided some of the responsive records. On February 9, 2016, EOUSA produced\n\n30 pages in full and, pursuant to Exemptions 5, 6, and 7(C), withheld 19 pages in part and 17\n\npages in full. See Fourth Barnett Decl., ¶ 5 & Exh. A. Because EOUSA had done so, OPR\n\ncontended, Plaintiff’s argument was moot. See Opp. at 7.\n\n       Plaintiff then recast the first part of his referral-related grievance in his Reply. He argued\n\nthat “OPR did not ever take any actions to independently review the EOUSA’s referral\n\ndetermination as to the records which the DOJ OPR located in OPR systems of records” and\n\n“therefore completely abdicated” and violated “its FOIA response duties.” Reply at 6. Although\n\nthat statement is somewhat confused, the Court understands Plaintiff to argue that OPR was\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fobligated by FOIA to review EOUSA’s decision to withhold some of the responsive records\n\nreferred to it.\n\n        Parker bases his position on McGehee v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"413259\"><a href=\"/opinion/413259/fielding-m-mcgehee-iii-v-central-intelligence-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1983), which\n\nexplained that “when an agency receives a FOIA request for ‘agency records’ in its possession, it\n\nmust take responsibility for processing the request. It cannot simply refuse to act on the ground\n\nthat the documents originated elsewhere.” Id. at 1110. But this Circuit later clarified that the\n\nagency receiving the initial request “may acquit itself [of the duty imposed] through a referral,\n\nprovided the referral does not lead to improper withholding.” Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186972\"><a href=\"/opinion/186972/sussman-v-us-marshals-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1118 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Contrary to Parker’s position, therefore, a component\n\nneed not necessarily follow up on or independently review the disclosure decision of the\n\ncomponent, agency, or office to which it referred the records for decision. Whether the referring\n\nagency retains a duty to act depends on whether the referral resulted in an improper withholding.\n\n        Plaintiff’s second referral-related grievance — that OPR did not provide the legal bases\n\nfor withholding responsive records referred to EOUSA — goes to that question. See Pl. Mot. at\n\n7; Reply at 6-7. Notably, OPR never argues that Plaintiff must sue EOUSA to obtain the\n\nrequired explanations, so the Court will assume that OPR retains responsibility here for the\n\npropriety of the withholdings. Yet, as Plaintiff points out, OPR never provided a description of\n\nthe specific legal bases for EOUSA’s withholdings beyond the general citations to exemptions\n\ngiven in the form letter that accompanied EOUSA’s production. See Fourth Barnett Decl., ¶ 5 &\n\nExh. A. The Vaughn Index supplied by OPR discusses only pages it withheld; it does not\n\naddress EOUSA’s withholdings. See Third Barnett Decl., Exh. C at 1. An agency, however, has\n\nthe burden to establish that a claimed exemption applies. Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in\n\nWash. v. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2014). It “may carry that burden by\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\fsubmitting affidavits that ‘describe the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific\n\ndetail, demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption,\n\nand are not controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad\n\nfaith.’” Id. (quoting Larson v. Dep’t of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187372\"><a href=\"/opinion/187372/larson-v-department-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (D.C. Cir. 2009)). Because\n\nOPR “does not assert that it has made any effort to ensure that” Parker received the explanations\n\nto which he is legally entitled, see Hall v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1403504\"><a href=\"/opinion/1403504/hall-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

After\n\nproviding an explanation to Plaintiff, unless he is satisfied, the agency shall renew its Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\nIt will grant Defendant’s Motion as to all issues except the referral of documents to EOUSA.
