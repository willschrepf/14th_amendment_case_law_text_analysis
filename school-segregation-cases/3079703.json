Despite Wicca’s relative\nobscurity, Rouser was not its only adherent in the California\nState Prison at Sacramento. In 1992, he petitioned on behalf\nof himself and some thirty fellow Wiccan inmates that the\nprison recognize Wicca as a bona fide religion and afford its\nfollowers the same rights accorded to inmates of other faiths.\nSpecifically, Rouser sought to (1) possess Wiccan ritual items\nlike candles, incense and Tarot cards; (2) access A Witches\nBible Compleat when placed in administrative segregation;\n(3) use the prison chapel for Wiccan ceremonies; and (4)\nreceive the ministry of a Wiccan chaplain.\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                         5\n\n    When the prison denied his requests, Rouser filed a civil\nrights complaint in the Eastern District of California. After\nDistrict Judge Karlton set the matter for trial, the parties\nentered into a comprehensive settlement agreement (the\n“1997 Agreement”). The agreement applied to “any\ninstitution under the jurisdiction of the California Department\nof Corrections (CDC) to which [Rouser] is assigned” and\ndescribed how the prisons and their staff would accommodate\nRouser’s religious needs.\n\n    Over the next 14 years, Rouser notified the court of\nvarious ways in which the CDC and its employees violated\nthe terms of the 1997 Agreement in the three facilities where\nhe was housed. Rouser alleged, for example, that officials\nsuspended Wiccan services while permitting other religious\nservices; precluded him from ordering religious items like\ncandles, oil, incense and herbs; prevented inmates from\ntimely attending Wiccan services; and disregarded his\nadministrative complaints.\n\n    Judge Karlton eventually granted a preliminary\ninjunction. In a 33-page order, he found that prison officials\nsubstantially burdened Rouser’s religious exercise by\n“[i]nhibiting [his] timely receipt of religious articles” and\n“[i]nhibiting group worship.” A year later, the parties entered\ninto another settlement agreement, which the district court\nadopted as a consent decree (“2011 Decree”) and is at the\nheart of this appeal. The decree reaffirmed the promises the\nCDC made in the 1997 Agreement and provided Rouser with\nadditional privileges: He was allowed to possess listed\nreligious items in his cell; he was entitled to attend weekly\n“esbats” and eight annual “sabbats” at an outdoor religious\nactivity area; and CDC employees would “develop a\nprocedure that allows the volunteer Wiccan minister . . . to\n\f6                     ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nobtain access to Wiccan group worship articles in a timely\nmanner for use at Wiccan esbats and sabbats.” In addition,\nRouser was permitted to bypass the informal, formal and first\nlevels of appeal and file a second-level appeal directly with\nthe warden or his designee to report any noncompliance with\nthe 2011 Decree.\n\n    The decree provided that after one year, defendants could\nmove for termination by showing that they had substantially\ncomplied with its terms. After approving the 2011 Decree,\nJudge Karlton transferred the case to the U.S. District Court\nfor the Central District of California on the parties’ motion.\n\n     Several months after the 2011 Decree went into effect,\nRouser filed a motion to enforce its terms and asked for a\npreliminary injunction. He argued that officials violated the\n2011 Decree in at least five ways: by damaging a religious\nnecklace in their custody; by canceling and suspending\nWiccan services without a legitimate justification; by\nprohibiting Rouser from using candles in his worship; and by\nfailing to construct an outdoor religious worship area. Most\nsignificantly, Rouser alleged that they screened and\ndisregarded his direct appeals to the warden. Defendants\ndenied or attempted to justify some of their actions, but didn’t\ncontest Rouser’s allegations that his appeals weren’t being\nprocessed in accordance with the terms of the 2011 Decree.\nAnd they all but conceded that they violated the decree by\ndenying Rouser access to candles.\n\n    The district court found that defendants had violated the\n2011 Decree in two ways: by damaging the religious necklace\nand dismissing Rouser’s grievances before they reached the\nwarden. The court reminded defendants to “adhere to the\nterms of the Decree” but didn’t order them to replace the\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                         7\n\nnecklace or grant any other relief. The court found no willful\nviolation of the provision permitting Rouser to use candles—\nonly a temporary prohibition due to a miscommunication that\nwas later resolved. As to the remaining claims, the district\ncourt faulted Rouser for failing to provide sufficient evidence\nto meet his burden of proving noncompliance. Rouser,\nhowever, had provided a sworn declaration, a prison\nmemorandum and a statement under penalty of perjury from\nanother inmate to support his claims that the prison had no\njustification for canceling and suspending Wiccan services.\nDefendants presented their own sworn statements\ncontradicting Rouser’s allegations, and the district court\ntacitly resolved the factual disputes in favor of defendants\nwithout an evidentiary hearing or even an acknowledgment\nthat Rouser had presented contrary evidence.\n\n    Three months later, defendants moved to vacate the\ndecree on grounds of substantial compliance. They relied on\nthe declaration of Correctional Counselor Nathan Wilcox,\nwho claimed that defendants “fully complied” with the 2011\nDecree, but he discussed only some of its terms and said\nnothing about compliance with the other terms. See infra p.\n12. Nor did he claim that defendants had remedied the two\nviolations the court had found just three months earlier.\nWilcox relied on an internal prison memorandum that set\nforth procedures for facilitating Wiccan group worship. But\nthat memorandum was dated October 2012 and thus predated\nthe district court’s finding that defendants had frustrated\nWiccan group worship by damaging the religious necklace\nand failing to give Rouser direct access to the warden for his\ngrievances.\n\n   Rouser disputed that the prison complied with the 2011\nDecree and sought an evidentiary hearing, claiming that he’d\n\f8                     ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nrecently been prevented from ordering candles and incense.\nIn their reply, defendants maintained that Rouser failed to\n“articulate any legitimate basis for extending this Court’s . . .\n2011 Order,” and asked the court to deny the motion without\na hearing or oral argument.\n\n    The court complied. It concluded in a minute order that\n“[d]efendants have demonstrated by a preponderance of the\nevidence that they have substantially complied with the terms\nof the settlement agreement.” The court didn’t mention its\nearlier finding that defendants had violated the 2011 Decree.\nRather, the court found that Wilcox’s declaration and the\noutdated prison memo showed defendants took “significant\nsteps to follow the settlement agreement” (emphasis added).\nFinding this sufficient to show substantial compliance, the\ncourt concluded that Rouser’s allegations of noncompliance,\neven if assumed to be true, were “insufficient to render\nDefendants substantially non-compliant” with the 2011\nDecree.\n\n                        DISCUSSION\n\n    We review for abuse of discretion the district court’s\ndecision to terminate a consent decree. See Jeff D. v. Otter\n(Otter), 643 F.3d 278, 283 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Jeff D. v.\nKempthorne (Kempthorne), 365 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir.\n2004)). We apply heightened deference to the district court’s\ndiscretionary decisions where it “has been overseeing\ncomplex institutional reform litigation for a long period of\ntime.” Kempthorne, 365 F.3d at 850. Here, however, the\ncourt that vacated the consent decree had supervised it for\nonly two years of the twenty-year history of the case. Neither\nour cases nor the PLRA require deference to a district court\nsimply because it has managed institutional-reform litigation\n\f                      ROUSER V. WHITE                         9\n\nfor two years. The dissent identifies no authority to the\ncontrary. Diss. at 33–34. Thus, we accord no special\ndeference in reviewing its exercise of discretion.\n\n       I. Purpose and History of the 2011 Decree\n\n    Our case law instructs district courts deciding a motion to\nvacate a consent decree to first consider “the more general\ngoals of the decree.” Otter, 643 F.3d at 288 (quoting\nYoungblood v. Dalzell, 925 F.2d 954, 960 (6th Cir. 1991)).\nThen the court should examine defendants’ entire “record of\ncompliance.” Id. (quoting Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467,\n491 (1992)). We have reversed a district court’s termination\nof a consent decree for failing to explicitly consider the\n“goals of the decree[]” and only evaluating compliance with\nindividual action items. Id. at 289.\n\n     The district court overlooked the teachings of Otter.\nNowhere in its terse minute order did it mention the\ndefendants’ record of compliance—either with the 2011\nDecree or its predecessor—“which over the course of the\nlitigation has been far from exemplary.” Id. at 288. Nor did\nit analyze whether the purposes of the 2011 Decree had been\n“adequately served” by defendants. Id. at 289.\n\n    The dissent claims that the district court identified the\npurpose of the decree by explaining that Rouser initially\nbrought suit for, and entered into a settlement that governs,\nhis “right to practice his religion, Wicca.” See Diss. at 38.\nBut these passing observations don’t satisfy Otter’s\nrequirement that a district court give “[e]xplicit consideration\n[to] the goals of the decree[].” 643 F.3d at 289. Nor do they\ncomply with Otter’s requirement that the district court find\n\f10                   ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nthat “those goals have been adequately served” before\nvacating the decree. Id.\n\n    This alone provides sufficient grounds for reversing the\norder vacating the decree. Id. But there’s much more.\nBecause the case must be returned to the district court, we\nnote numerous other errors so that they will not be repeated\non remand.\n\n               II. Substantial Compliance\n\n     A. Definition\n\n     The district court didn’t evaluate whether defendants\nsubstantially complied with each of the 2011 Decree’s terms.\nInstead, it concluded that they “complied with the [2011\nDecree]” as a whole. As such, it abused its discretion by\napplying law incorrectly. Id. at 283. Our cases do not treat\nconsent decrees as monolithic commands with which\ndefendants either comply or not. “Without question courts\ntreat consent decrees as contracts,” United States v. Asarco,\nInc., 430 F.3d 972, 980 (9th Cir. 2005), that have “the\nadditional element of judicial approbation.” Smith v. Sumner,\n994 F.2d 1401, 1406 (9th Cir. 1993). Like terms in a\ncontract, distinct provisions of consent decrees are\nindependent obligations, each of which must be satisfied\nbefore there can be a finding of substantial compliance.\nAccordingly, courts don’t release parties from a consent\ndecree unless they have substantially complied with every one\nof its provisions.\n\n    In Hallett v. Morgan we affirmed the district court’s\nruling that a prison substantially complied with the specific\nprovisions of a consent decree requiring the facility to\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        11\n\nprovide proper mental health and dental services to inmates.\n296 F.3d 732, 749–50 (9th Cir. 2002). At the same time, we\nreversed its determination that the prison substantially\ncomplied with the “other medical care provisions” of the\ndecree. Id. at 750–51. We also tacitly endorsed the Otter\ndistrict court’s approach of separately evaluating whether\ndefendants complied with individual “Action Items” in a\nconsent decree. Otter, 643 F.3d at 285; see also Washington\nv. Penwell, 700 F.2d 570, 572 (9th Cir. 1983) (remanding to\ndistrict court for failing to analyze compliance with one of\nseveral obligations in a consent decree).\n\n    The district court thus erred by applying the wrong legal\nstandard for substantial compliance. The court was satisfied\nthat the decree had been complied with because defendants\nhad taken “significant steps to follow the settlement\nagreement.” See supra p. 8. But merely taking significant\nsteps toward implementing the decree falls far short of\n“substantial compliance.” While the term is not amenable to\na “mathematically precise definition,” Otter, 643 F.3d at 284\n(quoting Joseph A. v. N.M. Dep’t of Human Servs., 69 F.3d\n1081, 1085 (10th Cir. 1995)), state law gives it meaning. Id.\nAnd in California a party is deemed to have substantially\ncomplied with an obligation only where any deviation is\n“unintentional and so minor or trivial as not ‘substantially to\ndefeat the object which the parties intend to accomplish.’”\nWells Benz, Inc. v. United States, 333 F.2d 89, 92 (9th Cir.\n1964) (quoting Connell v. Higgins, 150 P. 769, 775 (Cal.\n1915)).\n\n    This standard doesn’t require perfection, contrary to what\nthe dissent suggests. Diss. at 36. Deviations are permitted so\nlong as they don’t defeat the object of the decree. But merely\ntaking significant steps toward compliance comes nowhere\n\f12                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nnear satisfying this exacting standard. Rather, the district\ncourt should have first found that defendants substantially\ncomplied with each of the decree’s terms for a substantial\nperiod before terminating the decree.\n\n     B. Application\n\n    The record did not contain sufficient evidence to permit\nthe district court to conclude that defendants met the\nsubstantial-compliance standard. For one, the district court\nhad found, just four months earlier, that defendants had not\ncomplied with provisions related to custody over group\nworship supplies and expedited administrative appeals.\nWilcox says nothing in his declaration to indicate that\ndefendants had remedied these defects.             Given this\nuncontested record of violations and the absence of any\nevidence that the deficient performance had been remedied,\nthe district court’s conclusion that there has been substantial\ncompliance rested on a “clearly erroneous finding of material\nfact.” Otter, 643 F.3d at 283 (quoting Casey v. Albertson’s\nInc., 362 F.3d 1254, 1257 (9th Cir. 2004)).\n\n    More significant still, defendants failed to establish\naltogether that they complied with several action items in the\n2011 Decree. For example, defendants agreed to make copies\nof a master schedule of religious services that included the\ntime and location of Wiccan events. Nothing in the record\ndocuments that they fulfilled this obligation. And what of\nRouser’s ability to access his Wiccan bible in administrative\nsegregation? Or his right to be released from confinement in\ntime to attend full Wiccan services? We don’t know, because\ndefendants presented no evidence and the district court made\nno findings as to these terms of the 2011 Decree. There is no\nindication that the district court was aware of these terms\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        13\n\nwhen it entered its order. Yet a consent decree may not be\nterminated without well-supported findings that all of its\nterms have been faithfully complied with for a substantial\nperiod.\n\n    The dissent doesn’t explain how defendants could\npossibly show substantial compliance with all key obligations\nin a consent decree by only complying with some of those\nobligations. Nor does it explain how Rouser could\n“concede[]” that defendants complied with decree provisions\nthat weren’t mentioned in their motion to vacate. Diss. at 42.\nThe dissent relies on stale documents—the 2012 internal\nprison memorandum and a year-old joint status report—to\nsupport its claim that the prison was complying with all\ndecree provisions in 2013. Diss. at 45–46. That’s\ninconsistent with our caselaw requiring courts to examine the\n“record reflecting [prison] conditions as of the time\ntermination is sought.” Gilmore v. California, 220 F.3d 987,\n1010 (9th Cir. 2000). It’s also at odds with the dissent’s own\nwarning that “past instances of non-compliance are of\nquestionable relevance in deciding whether to vacate a\nconsent decree.” Diss. at 46.\n\n    In addition to these gaps in the record, the district court\noverlooked those of defendants’ claims that Rouser disputed.\nSpecifically, Rouser alleged that he was only allowed one\nritual outdoors. And he claimed that he wasn’t allowed to use\nthe seven candles specified in the 2011 Decree or obtain\nincense—both of which were important components of\noutdoor group worship. Where there is a factual dispute\nabout whether defendants substantially complied with a\ndecree, the district court may not simply “examine the\n[existing] record for ‘findings.’” Gilmore, 220 F.3d at 1010.\nRather, the court must take evidence on the current conditions\n\f14                        ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nat the prison. Id. As the dissent acknowledges, the district\ncourt didn’t follow this rule, even though Rouser contested\n“two relevant instances” of defendants’ compliance. Diss. at\n41–42. The defendants’ alleged failures weren’t merely\n“trivial” deviations warranting a finding of substantial\ncompliance. Connell, 150 P. at 775. If true, Rouser’s\nallegations would have documented material noncompliance\nwith the terms of the decree and thus precluded any finding\nof substantial compliance. Accordingly, the district court\nshould have—but didn’t—conduct a hearing before deciding\nmaterial factual disputes related to defendants’ compliance\nwith the decree.\n\n                    III. Denial of Due Process\n\n    The district court terminated the 2011 Decree at a time\nwhen Rouser wasn’t receiving notice of its orders. The court\nhad granted Rouser’s request to proceed pro se on March 28,\n2012 and had recorded his address as the California State\nPrison, Los Angeles County, in Lancaster. However, the\ndocket was not updated to reflect the address change, and the\ncourt continued to send its orders to Rouser’s former\ncounsel—almost two dozen over the course of two years.\nEach of those was returned to the district court as\nundeliverable.1 Once back, a deputy clerk dutifully filed and\n\n\n   1\n     Although the court substituted Rouser for a few of his attorneys when\nit granted his request to proceed pro se, the docket continued to show that\nRouser was being represented by attorney Richard Bates. Rouser had\nretained Bates in 2004 to represent him during his proceedings in the\nEastern District of California. Although Bates withdrew as counsel in\n2006, he was not removed as counsel of record until after Rouser filed his\nappeal. The dissent claims that the withdrawal was conditioned on Rouser\nfiling a separate order, which he never did. Diss. at 48. But the district\ncourt’s minute entry indicates that Bates was dismissed even absent the\n\f                          ROUSER V. WHITE                                15\n\ndocketed them. See Appendix A. But nobody bothered to\ncorrect the service address or resend the court’s orders to\nRouser in prison.\n\n    Rouser wrote to the court on October 27, 2012, explaining\nthat he was “pro per and the only way he has been finding out\nabout the [court’s] hearing dates is from the response filing of\nthe defendants.” If anyone read this statement on the first\npage of Rouser’s pleading, nobody bothered to find out why\nRouser was not getting the court’s orders or implement the\naddress change. The court’s orders continued to be sent\nto—and immediately returned from—Rouser’s former\nattorney’s address.\n\n    Rouser’s failure to receive the court’s orders prejudiced\nhis ability to allege violations of the 2011 Decree. The\ncourt’s November 15, 2012 order instructed Rouser on the\nproper format under the local rules for submitting notices of\nadditional violations. It also informed him that the court\nwould disregard any noncompliant filings dated after October\n9, 2012. Rouser had no way of knowing about this ruling. So\nhe was unfairly denied the chance to re-file his flawed notices\nand effectively oppose the motion to vacate the consent\ndecree.\n\n    Had Rouser submitted his notices in the proper format,\nthe district court would have been confronted with a host of\nadditional allegations of non-compliance. Rouser claimed in\n\n\nfiling of an order for the court’s signature. In any case, the district court\nwas well aware of Rouser’s pro se status, as it signed and filed his 2012\nattorney-substitution request identifying him as proceeding “pro se.”\nThus, despite knowing Rouser was pro se, the court delivered Rouser’s\ncopy of its orders to Bates as if he were still Rouser’s attorney.\n\f16                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nhis several defective filings that defendants deprived him of\nthe Wiccan bible in administrative segregation; prevented\nhim from applying for the volunteer chapel clerk position;\nand continued to deny him direct access to the warden for his\ngrievances. If true, each of these claims would have\namounted to a material violation of the 2011 Decree.\n\n    Most troubling is the district court’s cavalier response\nonce it finally realized that Rouser had not been receiving its\norders. Rouser, apparently unaware that the case was over,\nwrote to the court on April 12, 2013, explaining that he’d\nlearned that all of the court’s orders had been sent to his\nformer counsel. Rouser claimed that he had been “effectively\ndenied all due process and basically [had] been forced to fly\nblind.” He specifically sought leave to appeal “[i]f the judge\nhas granted the defendants’ motion [to terminate the decree]”\nand requested the district court send him past orders. On the\nsame day, he sent a letter addressed to the clerk’s office,\nexplaining that his former counsel left the case in 2006, that\nhe was a “pro per plaintiff” and that he had not received\norders from the court, which denied him “all due process.”\nThe docket does not reflect any response from either the court\nor the clerk’s office to Rouser’s letters.\n\n    On May 27, 2013, Rouser sent a strongly worded letter to\nthe deputy state attorney general who served as counsel for\ndefendants, with a copy to the court. In it, he declared that\nthe court had “refused to send [him] any of its orders\nconcerning this case . . . [w]hen it knows [he is] pro per and\n[has] been filing all motions and responses [himself].”\nExasperated, Rouser wrote: “I am at a loss on how to get this\ncourt to send me copies of its orders . . . . I have [written to]\nthe clerk as well and don’t know if I need to go to someone\n\f                      ROUSER V. WHITE                        17\n\nelse or who else is it when the court will not send you rulings\nin your own case.”\n\n    The court finally sent a copy of its order terminating the\ndecree to Rouser on June 7, 2013. It declined to give Rouser\nadditional time to oppose the now-moot motion to vacate,\nreasoning that Rouser already availed himself of the\nopportunity to respond to the motion. The court faulted\nRouser for failing to keep it advised of his address and\nconcluded that his failure to receive orders was due to his\nown oversight. The court, however, overlooked its own order\nof March 28, 2012 granting Rouser’s request to proceed pro\nse and recording his address as the Lancaster prison. Rouser\nhas remained at that prison since. The failure to effectuate\nRouser’s address change was thus the court’s fault, not\nRouser’s.\n\n     This breakdown of communication between the court and\nRouser is at loggerheads with the court’s obligation to alert\npro se litigants that they are entitled to submit evidence when\nthe district court is about to resolve a dispositive motion. Cf.\nAnderson v. Angelone, 86 F.3d 932, 935 (9th Cir. 1996). And\nit stands on its head the “special solicitude” we consistently\nafford pro se prisoners due to the lack of control they have\nover their mail. See Caldwell v. Amend, 30 F.3d 1199, 1201\n(9th Cir. 1994). To this day, there’s nothing in the record\nindicating that anyone in the Central District of California has\npaused to question why so many returned orders are being\ndocketed in this case. Rouser tried to bring the problem to\nthe district court’s attention in multiple filings, all to no\n\f18                        ROUSER V. WHITE\n\neffect.2 This raises doubts as to whether the judge or anyone\nelse paid sufficient attention to Rouser’s pleadings. Because\nof this failure, Rouser was denied a fair opportunity to contest\ndefendants’ motion to terminate the decree.\n\n                               *    *     *\n\n    We are disappointed by the district court’s insouciance in\nthis case. The court committed numerous errors in\nterminating a consent decree that had been carefully crafted\nover the course of two decades. The court applied the wrong\nlegal standard and found substantial compliance without\ngiving due attention to the various exacting obligations\nembodied in the decree, and without considering whether the\npurpose of the decree had been served. The court\nimprovidently refused to hold an evidentiary hearing to\nresolve material factual disputes about whether defendants\nhad complied with the decree. The court also encouraged\nnoncompliance by finding that defendants had violated the\nconsent decree, yet refusing to grant any meaningful relief.\n\n    In light of the court’s own findings, only four months\nearlier, that defendants had failed to comply with material\n\n\n 2\n   As discussed, in October 2012, Rouser filed a pleading indicating that\nhe was only receiving notice of hearing dates from the “response filing of\nthe defendants.” Then in April 2013, he wrote to the court and the clerk’s\noffice explaining that he was a pro se plaintiff and had not received the\ncourt’s orders, and was thus deprived of due process. When the district\ncourt and the clerk’s office remained silent, Rouser sent a letter to\nopposing counsel with a copy to the court, saying that he was “at a loss on\nhow to get [the] court to send [him] copies of its orders.” All of these\ncommunications were docketed and filed but had no effect until June 7,\n2013, when the court eventually sent Rouser a copy of the order\nterminating the decree.\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        19\n\naspects of the decree, and with no proof that those failures\nhad been remedied, termination of the decree was clearly an\nabuse of discretion. Under no circumstances should the\ndistrict court consider terminating a decree unless and until\nthere has been a substantial period of substantial\ncompliance—in this case no less than a year—with every one\nof its terms.\n\n    The district court’s protracted failure to correct Rouser’s\naddress, and its repeated failure to re-send notices of orders\nthat had been returned as undeliverable, raises even broader\nquestions. Bluntly stated, the record documented in\nAppendix A casts doubt on whether anyone in the Central\nDistrict of California’s Clerk’s Office is paying attention to\nthe important and sensitive process of providing parties with\nfair notice of the court’s orders. How can it be that the\ndistrict court failed to implement the change of address for\nthe delivery of orders after granting Rouser’s motion to\nproceed pro se, and then ignored almost two dozen orders that\nwere returned to the court as undeliverable? Is the problem\nwe note here limited to this case or does it reflect an absence\nof procedures designed to prevent and correct such errors in\nother cases? We find it inconceivable that a properly run\nclerk’s office would permit this to go on over the course of\nyears.\n\n    We therefore VACATE the district court’s order\nterminating the consent decree, REINSTATE the 2011\nConsent Decree and REMAND the case to the district court\nfor further proceedings consistent with our opinion.

WHITE\n\nCALLAHAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n     In 1993, William Rouser filed suit against California state\nprison officials (Defendants), alleging that they had infringed\nhis right to practice Wicca while incarcerated in violation of\nthe Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S.\nConstitution, among other laws. Twenty years later, the\ndistrict court concluded that a court-approved settlement\nagreement (the Consent Decree) balancing Rouser’s ability to\npractice Wicca with prison officials’ need to maintain safe\nprisons had served its purpose. The court therefore vacated\nthe Decree. We must decide whether the district court abused\nits discretion in determining that Defendants had substantially\ncomplied with the Decree.\n\n     The majority’s reversal of the district court improperly\ndenies the heightened deference due a trial court’s finding\nthat a consent decree aimed at institutional reform has served\nits purpose, is at odds with the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n(PLRA), and is undermined by a record showing compliance\nthat is substantial. The majority rules that a party seeking to\nterminate a consent decree, including decrees involving\nfederal-court intervention in state prisons, must demonstrate\ncompliance with every one of a decree’s provisions for a\nsubstantial period of time. This rule effectively requires full,\nnot substantial compliance. The rule is contrary to our\nprecedent and Congressional intent, and it thrusts federal\ncourts beyond their institutional competence. I dissent.\n\n                               I.\n\n   Understanding the district court’s determination that\nDefendants have substantially complied with the Consent\nDecree first requires understanding the Decree’s contents and\n\f                      ROUSER V. WHITE                         25\n\nthe events preceding its vacatur. The majority does not\nexplain the Decree’s numerous provisions and instead focuses\non, and incorrectly describes, the few provisions that Rouser\nsays have been violated. The majority’s failure to\nacknowledge the undisputed breadth of Defendants’\ncompliance is not without irony given that the majority faults\nthe district court for not addressing “every one of [the\nDecree’s] provisions.” Maj. Op. 10 (emphasis in original).\n\nA. The Consent Decree\n\n    Since Rouser initiated this lawsuit, the district court,\namong other things, approved a private settlement agreement\nin 1997, reopened the case in 2004 following Rouser’s\nmotion to enforce the settlement agreement, and granted\nRouser a preliminary injunction in 2010. After Defendants\nnoticed that they intended to appeal the district court’s\npreliminary injunction order, the parties agreed to mediation\nand, in 2011, reached a court-approved settlement agreement\nthat is the focus of this appeal.\n\n    The Consent Decree provides Rouser with access to listed\npersonal religious items, including the Witches’ Bible, the\nBook of Shadows, other religious literature, a deck of tarot\ncards, up to four ounces of listed oils, listed herbs, up to five\none-inch stones or ten one-half-inch stones, four feathers, a\npentagram or other approved Wiccan medallion, and one\npackage of eighteen seashells not larger than one-half inch in\ndiameter. While in administrative segregation or the security\nhousing unit Rouser is allowed access only to the Witches’\nBible, and only to the extent that prisoners of other religious\nfaiths are allowed to have a religious text in those units. The\nDecree provides Rouser with access to a different set of items\nfor group religious services, including candles and candle\n\f26                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nholders, incense and incense holders, listed oils, water, salt,\nlisted herbs, tarot cards, a drum, feathers, stones, seashells, a\nwood wand, a chalice or ritual cup, a small bell, a drum, an\naltar and altar cloth, and a small picture or statue of deities.\nWhile the Decree permits Rouser to use seven candles for\ngroup religious services, his access is subject to institutional\nsafety and security concerns, including applicable fire safety\nregulations. Prison officials maintain custody and control\nover these group religious items while they are not in use.\n\n    The Consent Decree requires Defendants to provide\nRouser with “reasonable opportunities to participate” in\nWiccan events, including weekly services called Esbats,\nweekly religious study groups, and special religious services\ncalled Sabbats. In fulfilling these obligations, however, the\nDecree recognizes that Defendants also must “tak[e] into\naccount factors such as the number of inmates, available\nspace, safety and security, resources, and administrative\nconsiderations.” Sabbats are held eight times a year, and\nprison officials are required to “use their reasonable efforts to\nschedule the Sabbats on the dates identified.” If a Sabbat is\ncancelled for administrative reasons, prison officials must\nreschedule the Sabbat at the earliest practicable date.\nHowever, the Decree provides that officials will not\nreschedule a Sabbat cancelled because of inmate-caused\nsafety or security concerns. The Decree requires Defendants\nto construct a fire pit and outdoor worship area, which Rouser\nmay use during Sabbats. A volunteer Wiccan minister may\nattend and lead Wiccan services.\n\n    The Decree also includes provisions aimed at ensuring\nthat prison officials treat Wicca similarly to how they treat\nother religions. For example, the Decree provides that the\nschedule, time, and location of Wiccan events will be posted\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        27\n\nand announced in the same manner as other religious events\nand that Rouser may apply and be considered for an inmate\nwork assignment as a clerk to the facility chaplain. The\nDecree requires prison officials to provide food for Sabbats\nto the extent that they provide food for special religious\nobservances of other religious groups. Similarly, if prison\nofficials allow inmates to bring food or canteen items to\nreligious services and study groups, they will permit Rouser\nto bring comparable food or canteen items to weekly Wiccan\nservices and study groups.\n\n    More generally, the Decree provides Rouser with an\nexpedited inmate appeals process for appeals relating to\nnoncompliance with the Decree. It also provides that prison\nofficials may temporarily suspend the Decree’s provisions in\nemergencies, for security reasons, or when Rouser is confined\nin administrative segregation or the secure housing unit.\nFinally, the Decree includes a termination provision stating\nthat, one year after its filing, Defendants could move to\nvacate the decree, dismiss the action with prejudice, and enter\njudgment on the ground that the preponderance of the\nevidence shows they have substantially complied with the\nDecree.\n\n    In sum, the Consent Decree’s central goal is to permit\nRouser, like inmates of other faiths, to practice his religion\nwhile incarcerated consistent with prison officials’ need to\nmaintain safe, orderly prisons in the face of finite resources.\nAchieving this goal requires prison officials to permit Rouser\nreasonable access to the religious items, services, and\nfacilities that are important to Wicca.\n\f28                   ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nB. Post-Settlement Litigation\n\n    Defendants proceeded to fulfill their obligations under the\nConsent Decree after the district court entered it on October\n18, 2011. On March 8, 2012, the parties filed a joint status\nreport describing Defendants’ compliance. The parties stated\nthat Defendants had provided Rouser with access to all\nspecified personal and group religious items, allowed Rouser\nto order additional religious items, progressed with\nconstruction of the fire pit, included Wiccan events in the\nmaster schedule for religious services and study groups,\nsecured a volunteer Wiccan minister, and determined that\nthere currently was not a chaplain clerk position open for\napplication by Rouser or any other inmate. Defendants\npermitted Rouser to attend Wiccan services and activities on\na regular basis, though Rouser complained that “there have\nbeen several instances where services were not timely started\nor were otherwise canceled.”               Rouser, however,\nacknowledged that he was able to avail himself of an\nexpedited inmate appeals process to address his concern.\n\n    On July 26, 2012, Rouser, now proceeding pro se, filed\nthe first of a series of documents with the district court\nseeking to compel Defendants’ compliance with the Consent\nDecree. He alleged that (1) a religious necklace had been\ndamaged; (2) the December 2011 Yule Sabbat had been\ncanceled due to a contraband-related “laundry sweep”; (3)\nweekly services had been “terminated indefinitely” for two\nweeks; (4) officers were “desecrating” religious items in their\ncustody by touching them while dispensing them; (5) the\noutdoor religious area under construction had not been\ncompleted; and (6) he had twice been denied expedited\nprisoner appeals. In later filings, Rouser sought monetary\ndamages and immediate release from administrative\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        29\n\nsegregation, where he alleged that he was placed due to\n“enemy concerns” related to a Protestant inmate. He also\nalleged that Defendants told him that he could not order\ncandles and incense.\n\n    Defendants responded with declarations from prison staff.\nDefendants explained that, consistent with the Consent\nDecree, the Yule Sabbat was “canceled due to inmate-caused\nsafety and security issues, specifically reports of contraband\nin the inmate laundry that precipitated a temporary lockdown\nof the prison facility.” They explained that Wiccan weekly\nservices were briefly suspended following a May 9, 2012\nservice during which “volunteers covered up windows in the\nchapel with inmates inside, restricting the view into the area,\nthereby creating a significant safety and security breach\nwithin the prison.” The suspension was lifted two weeks\nlater, immediately after the Wiccan volunteers returned and\nwere further instructed on compliance with prison procedures.\nDefendants averred that Rouser’s religious necklace, which\nis not listed among the group religious items kept by prison\nofficials, was damaged while it was in his control.\nDefendants confirmed that they completed construction of the\noutdoor religious activity area and fire pit on August 21,\n2012, and that Rouser had made use of the area since that\ntime. Addressing Rouser’s latter allegations, Defendants\nexplained that Rouser was not denied access to either candles\nor incense, but acknowledged “some miscommunication\nconcerning [his] access and use of an open flame during\nservices” stemming from security concerns, which had been\nresolved.\n\n   On November 15, 2012, the district court consolidated\nmost of Rouser’s numerous filings and denied most of his\n\f30                      ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nclaims.1 The court began by noting that many of Rouser’s\nallegations were “unclear, unsupported, or unrelated to the\nterms of the Decree.” The court found that prison officials\nhad not violated the Decree by improperly cancelling\nservices, noting that the officials provided evidence that\nservices were properly cancelled because of security and\nsafety threats. The court found that prison officials had not\ndenied Rouser access to an outdoor religious area or\n“desecrated” religious items by touching them, as they must\nin order to keep and dispense them. The court acknowledged\nRouser’s allegation that a necklace had been damaged and\nother unspecified items had been stolen, and ordered prison\nofficials to adhere to the terms of the Consent Decree “[t]o\nthe extent religious items are under [their] control.”\nAddressing the only uncontested violation of the Decree, the\ncourt ordered Defendants to provide Rouser with expedited\ninmate appeals concerning the Decree.\n\nC. Vacatur of the Consent Decree\n\n     A few months later, on February 4, 2013, Defendants\nmoved to vacate the Consent Decree. In support of the\nmotion, Defendants provided a declaration from Nathan\nWilcox, a Correctional Counselor and Litigation Coordinator\nat the Lancaster Prison. Wilcox attested to Defendants’ “full\ncompliance with the terms of the Consent Decree, including\nthe construction of the outdoor religious area and Plaintiff’s\naccess to religious items.” Wilcox stated that Rouser had\nbeen provided access to the personal religious items set forth\nin the Decree, including “tarot cards, oils, herbs, stones,\n\n\n  1\n    On November 28, 2012, the court issued a separate order denying\nRouser’s other outstanding motions because Rouser had failed to comply\nwith the Consent Decree’s exhaustion requirement.\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        31\n\nfeathers, and shells.” Rouser also had received access to all\nreligious group items for Wiccan services, and had “been\npermitted to order and purchase additional religious items.”\nEsbats now were scheduled and held on a weekly basis with\nthe assistance of a volunteer Wiccan minister, subject to\ninstitutional safety and security concerns. A fire pit and\noutdoor religious worship area had been constructed for\nWiccan inmates’ use. Wilcox explained that Wiccan inmates\nused the outdoor religious area for the Samhain Sabbat on\nOctober 31, 2012, and the Yule Sabbat on December 23,\n2012. Defendants also submitted an October 18, 2012\nmemorandum requiring Wiccan service “to be announced in\nthe same manner and to the same extent as announced for\nreligious events of other religious groups,” and detailing\nprocedures for storage of group religious items and use of the\noutdoor religious area.\n\n    On February 21, 2013, Rouser opposed the motion to\nvacate, alleging that prison officials had only allowed him, in\nthe absence of a volunteer chaplain, to complete one ritual at\nthe outdoor religious ground since it was completed and to\nuse one candle, instead of seven, for the 2012 Yule Sabbat.\n\n    On March 13, 2013, the district court granted the motion\nto vacate and entered judgment for Defendants. Citing to\ndeclarations by prison staff and “internal prison procedures\nsetting forth approved Wiccan religious activities,” the court\nruled that Defendants had demonstrated by a preponderance\nof the evidence that they had substantially complied with\nDecree. The court explained that “[a]lthough it is not entirely\nclear from his Opposition, Plaintiff contends that Defendants\nhave not complied with the settlement agreement in a handful\nof instances.” The court concluded that, even assuming these\n\f32                         ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nallegations to be true, they did not overcome Defendants’\nshowing of substantial compliance.\n\n                                     II.\n\n    The district court’s three-page order granting the motion\nto vacate is terse. Indeed, if the majority simply vacated and\nremanded for further explanation little ink would be spilled\nin dissent.2 However, the majority goes much further, rattling\noff supposed errors like a gatling gun. In doing so, the\nmajority commits larger legal errors related to the standards\napplicable to the termination of consent decrees governing\nstate prisons.\n\nA. We owe special deference to the district court’s\n   determination the Consent Decree has served its\n   purpose.\n\n    We review the district court’s grant of a motion to vacate\na consent decree for an abuse of discretion. Jeff D. v. Otter,\n643 F.3d 278, 283 (9th Cir. 2011). While the abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard is always deferential, the deference owed\n\n  2\n    While terse, the district court’s explanation is sufficient to allow for\nmeaningful judicial review. See Husain v. Olympic Airways, 316 F.3d\n829, 835 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[I]f the district court’s findings are plausible in\nlight of the record viewed in its entirety, the appellate court cannot reverse\neven if it is convinced it would have found differently.”). As elaborated\nbelow, the largely uncontested declaration and prison procedures\nreferenced by the district court confirm that the court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in finding substantial compliance. This case is therefore not, as\nRouser contends, like Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Ala. v. Unity\nOutpatient Surgery Center, Inc., 490 F.3d 718, 725 (9th Cir. 2007), where\nwe remanded because a district court’s order was devoid of “any\ndiscussion of the relevant factors or any indication of the basis for its\ndecision.”\n\f                      ROUSER V. WHITE                         33\n\na district court’s decision to terminate a consent decree\ngoverning institutional reform is heightened where, as here,\nthe trial judge oversaw the decree for a significant period of\ntime. See Jeff D. v. Kempthorne, 365 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir.\n2004). A trial court in an institutional reform case is due\nspecial deference not only because of its familiarity with any\nprogress toward compliance and past instances of non-\ncompliance, but also because of its better understanding of\nthe challenges that might make more perfect compliance\nunrealistic. For example, in overseeing a decree governing\nthe management of state prisons, the trial court “develop[s]\nan understanding of the difficulties involved in . . . managing\na jail that an appellate court, even with the best possible\nbriefing, could never hope to match.” Rufo v. Inmates of\nSuffolk Cty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 394 (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring); see also Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 688\n(1978) (providing “special deference because of the trial\njudge’s years of experience with the problem at hand and his\nrecognition of the limits on a federal court’s authority in a\ncase of this kind”).\n\n    The majority initially errs by denying special deference to\nthe district court’s determination that the Consent Decree has\nserved its purpose, reasoning that the district court handled\nthe case for “only two years.” Maj. Op. 8. But even\nassuming that a district court must oversee a consent decree\nfor some threshold amount of time before deference is due,\ntwo years of managing a decree is more than enough. This\ncase’s history demonstrates that the district court is far better\npositioned than we are to determine if Defendants have\nsubstantially complied with the Decree. As noted, the district\ncourt decided to grant the motion to vacate not long after\ngranting in part and denying in part Rouser’s motion to\nenforce. The district court was thus very familiar with the\n\f34                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nchallenges facing prison officials’ compliance, the steps that\nDefendants had made toward achieving full compliance, and\nthe nature of Rouser’s remaining allegations of non-\ncompliance.\n\n     That the district court’s experience supervising the Decree\nfor two years is enough to merit deference is also supported\nby the PLRA, pursuant to which the Consent Decree was\nentered. The PLRA provides that, after two years, consent\ndecrees providing prospective relief with respect to prison\nconditions are “terminable upon the motion of any party or\nintervener,” unless “the court makes written findings based\non the record that prospective relief remains necessary to\ncorrect a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right”\nat issue. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(1), (3). If consent decrees are\npresumptively terminable after two years under the PLRA, it\nfollows that two years of supervising a decree is a sufficient\namount of time for a trial judge to acquire the expertise\nneeded to determine whether a decree’s purpose has been\nserved.\n\n    Of course, we don’t need Congress to tell us that two\nyears is a substantial amount of time. Common sense tells us\nso. Two years is the term of a member of the House of\nRepresentatives, for example. Indeed, we classify crimes\npunishable by two years imprisonment as felonies because\nthat is a substantial amount of time. The majority errs by\nrefusing to accord “substantial deference to ‘the trial judge’s\nyears of experience with the problem at hand.’” Rufo, 502\nU.S. at 394 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (quoting Hutto, 437\nU.S. at 688).\n\f                      ROUSER V. WHITE                        35\n\nB. The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n   vacating the Consent Decree.\n\n    Giving the district court the special deference it is owed,\nI cannot agree with the majority that the district court abused\nits discretion in vacating the Consent Decree. “A district\ncourt abuses its discretion if it does not apply the correct law\nor if it rests its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of\nmaterial fact.” Casey v. Albertson’s Inc., 362 F.3d 1254,\n1257 (9th Cir. 2004). Rouser has demonstrated neither of\nthese conditions.\n\n   1. The district court did not fail to observe any\n      procedure required for terminating consent\n      decrees. Rather, the majority creates a rule that is\n      inconsistent with our case law and the PLRA.\n\n    The majority first faults the district court for failing to\nobserve procedure that the majority rules courts must follow\nin deciding whether to vacate a consent decree. According to\nthe majority, a court faced with a motion to terminate a\nconsent decree must first determine whether the basic\npurposes of the decree have been met, and then must\ndetermine whether the party seeking release from the decree\nhas “substantially complied with every one of its provisions”\nfor a “substantial period.” Maj. Op. 10, 11–12, 13, 19.\n\n     The majority’s “substantial period of substantial\ncompliance with every term” invention is inconsistent with\nour case law and at odds with the PLRA. The majority\nattributes its rule to “the teachings of Otter.” Maj. Op. 9. But\nJeff D. v. Otter, 643 F.3d 278 (9th Cir. 2011), created no such\nrule. In Otter, we faulted the district court for employing “the\ncontempt burden and standard of proof” in determining\n\f36                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nwhether “substantial compliance [permitted] consent decrees\nto be vacated.” Otter, 643 F.3d at 287. We also directed the\ndistrict court, on remand, to consider whether “the larger\npurposes of the decrees have been served,” rather than\nfocusing myopically on whether individual “Action Items”\nhad been completed. Id. at 288. This direction is consistent\nwith our other decisions, which emphasize that substantial\ncompliance does not mean that “every last wish and hope of\nthe decree [has been] achieved, but [that] the decree\naccomplished its essential purposes and the situation\nimproved greatly.” Labor/Cmty. Strategy Ctr. v. Los Angeles\nCty. Metro. Transp. Auth., 564 F.3d 1115, 1123 (9th Cir.\n2009) (emphasis added). The majority’s rule requiring a\nsubstantial period of substantial compliance with every term\nviolates this precedent.\n\n    The majority’s rule, which effectively requires full rather\nthan substantial compliance, is particularly inappropriate in\ncases involving federal oversight of a state prison. Its rule is\nin tension with the general “principle that federal court\nintervention in state institutions is a temporary measure and\nmay extend no longer than necessary to cure constitutional\nviolations.” Id. (citing Bd. of Ed. of Okla. City Pub. Sch. v.\nDowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248 (1991); Toussaint v. McCarthy,\n801 F.2d 1080, 1087 (9th Cir. 1986)). The majority’s rule is\nalso inconsistent with the PLRA, which we have recognized\nwas “intended . . . to revive the hands-off doctrine” regarding\nfederal judicial intervention in prisons.          Gilmore v.\nCalifornia, 220 F.3d 987, 997 (9th Cir. 2000). Under the\nPLRA, a court must terminate a consent decree after two\nyears in the absence of a “current and ongoing violation” of\n\f                          ROUSER V. WHITE                               37\n\nan asserted federal right.3 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3). “In other\nwords, if a violation no longer exists, the statute does not\npermit the court” to refuse to terminate the Decree. Hallett v.\nMorgan, 296 F.3d 732, 743 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n    Accordingly, the majority’s rule requiring substantial\ncompliance with every provision for a substantial period of\ntime has no place under our precedent or the law. Nor is its\nrule obligating district courts to examine in detail past\ninstances of non-compliance that are not ongoing consistent\nwith applicable law in prison-reform cases. Rather, our\nprecedent and California law direct courts to consider\n“whether the larger purposes of [consent] decrees have been\nserved” in deciding whether their vacatur is justified due to\nsubstantial compliance. Otter, 643 F.3d at 287; see\nLabor/Cmty. Strategy Ctr., 564 F.3d at 1122 (“Our analysis\nrequires we do more than simply count the number of\ntechnical deviations from the decree. Instead, we must\ndetermine, using a holistic view of all the available\ninformation, whether [defendant’s] compliance with the\nDecree overall was substantial, notwithstanding some\nminimal level of noncompliance.”). And in deciding whether\nprospective relief remains merited in a case aimed at reform\nof a state prison, federal courts should “give substantial\n\n\n\n\n  3\n    Rouser accepts that this requirement applies to the district court’s\ntermination of the Consent Decree, but argues that the PLRA requires\nevidentiary hearings and written findings before a district court terminates\na consent decree governed by the PLRA. This position is contrary to\n§ 3626(b)(3)’s plain language, our precedent, and decisions of our sister\ncircuits. See, e.g., Hallett, 296 F.3d at 743; Cagle v. Hutto, 177 F.3d 253,\n258 (4th Cir. 1999); see also Guajardo v. Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice,\n363 F.3d 392, 397 (5th Cir. 2004).\n\f38                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nweight to any adverse impact on public safety or the\noperation of a criminal justice system.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(a)(2).\n\n    Here, the district court satisfied these requirements by\nrecognizing that the underlying purpose of the Consent\nDecree was to provide for Rouser’s “ability to practice Wicca\nwhile incarcerated.” The majority does not explain why this\ndescription of the Decree’s goal is inadequate or even attempt\nto provide a better description. The district court then found\nthat Defendants’ largely uncontested declarations and\nmemorandum regarding prison procedures demonstrated, by\na preponderance of evidence, that Defendants have\nsubstantially complied with the Decree. In so holding, the\ndistrict court did not violate any court-mandated procedure\nfor resolving motions to vacate consent decrees.\n\n    Nor did the district court err, as the majority alternatively\nholds, by finding substantial compliance without conducting\nan evidentiary hearing. The majority relies on Gilmore v.\nCalifornia, but that case only held that a district court must\n“take evidence on the current circumstances at the prison . . .\nwith respect to those remedies as to which plaintiffs did not\nconcede that defendants were in compliance.” 220 F.3d at\n1010. Here the district court took and considered evidence on\ncurrent circumstances presented by both parties and assumed\nRouser’s evidence as true. The district court did not, as the\nmajority incorrectly states, “simply examine the existing\nrecord.” Maj Op. 13–14 (quotation marks and alteration\nomitted). The majority fails to understand that the act of\ntaking evidence includes taking declarations and other new\nevidence, and is not limited to live hearings.\n\f                           ROUSER V. WHITE                                39\n\n    Neither our precedent nor the terms of the Consent\nDecree required more. See, e.g., Stewart v. Cate, 757 F.3d\n929, 942 (9th Cir. 2014) (holding that a district court did not\nabuse its discretion in denying a request for an evidentiary\nhearing where newly presented evidence requiring a\ncredibility assessment was assumed true). In fact, under the\nPLRA, neither evidentiary hearings nor written findings\nbased on the record are required where a federal court\ndetermines that the consent decree governing state prisons\nshould terminate. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3); Cagle, 177 F.3d at\n258 (“The plain language of § 3626(b)(3) imposes no\nrequirement that a district court conduct an evidentiary\nhearing in order to determine whether there is a current and\nongoing violation of federal rights.”).\n\n     2. The district court did not use an incorrect\n        standard for substantial compliance.\n\n    The majority also faults the district court for “applying\nthe wrong legal standard for substantial compliance.” Maj.\nOp. 11. The majority claims that the district court equated\nsubstantial compliance with “significant steps to follow the\nsettlement agreement.” Id. Rouser, who is now represented\nby a major law firm, did not make, and thus waived, this\nargument, which unfairly characterizes the district court’s\ndecision.4 Consistent with the Consent Decree’s termination\n\n 4\n   Without providing any supporting precedent, Rouser incorrectly faults\nthe district court for “fail[ing] to define substantial compliance.” The\ndistrict court was under no obligation to define substantial compliance.\nIn fact, the court had no need to clarify its meaning in light of the parties’\nagreement that California law governs the term. The parties agree that,\nunder California law, substantial compliance does not require “literal\ncompliance,” it requires that “the defects of performance must not pervade\nthe whole or be so essential as substantially to defeat the object which the\n\f40                     ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nprovision, the district court placed the evidentiary burden on\nDefendants, and found that they had “demonstrated by a\npreponderance of the evidence that they have substantially\ncomplied with the terms of the [Decree].” The reference to\n“significant steps to follow the settlement agreement” simply\nindicates that Defendants have diligently worked to achieve\ncompliance with the Decree, as detailed in their mostly\nuncontested filings. The district court concluded that\nDefendants’ evidence established that they “have\nsubstantially complied with the settlement agreement.”\n\n     3. The district court did not clearly err in finding\n        that a preponderance of the evidence showed\n        substantial compliance with the Consent Decree.\n\n     The majority also holds that the district court’s substantial\ncompliance determination is based on a clearly erroneous\nfactual finding. Under the abuse of discretion standard, “if\nthe district court’s findings are plausible in light of the record\nviewed in its entirety, the appellate court cannot reverse even\nif it is convinced it would have found differently.” Husain,\n316 F.3d at 835. Again, this standard is even more\ndeferential where, as here, we review a district court’s\ndetermination that a consent decree aimed at institutional\nreform has served its purpose. Labor/Cmty. Strategy Ctr.,\n564 F.3d at 1121.\n\n    Applying these rules to the record presented compels me\nto conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin finding that Defendants had substantially complied with\nthe Consent Decree. As noted, the district court found that\n\n\nparties intend to accomplish.” Connell v. Higgins, 170 Cal. 541, 556\n(1915); see also Labor/Cmty. Strategy Ctr., 564 F.3d at 1122.\n\f                         ROUSER V. WHITE                             41\n\n“declarations from prison staff, outlining the various actions\ntaken to comply with the settlement agreement” and “internal\nprison procedures setting forth approved Wiccan religious\nactivities” demonstrated Defendants’ substantial compliance\nwith the Decree. The Wilcox declaration explained that (1)\nRouser had been provided access to the personal and religious\ngroup items listed in the Decree; (2) Wiccan group services\nwere scheduled and held on a weekly basis with the\nassistance of a volunteer Wiccan minister, subject to\ninstitutional safety and security considerations; (3) a fire pit\nand outdoor religious worship area had been constructed for\nWiccan inmates’ use; and (4) Wiccan inmates used the\noutdoor religious area for the “Samhain sabbat on October 31,\n2012 and the Yule sabbat on December 23, 2012.” The\nreferenced prison procedures, among other things, (1) provide\nthat Wiccan “services shall be announced in the same manner\nand to the same extent as announced for religious events of\nother religious groups”; (2) explain that the group religious\nitems listed in the Consent Decree “are to be secured in the\nFacility Chapel”; and (3) establish rules for use of the outdoor\nreligious area.\n\n    In response to Defendants’ proffer of compliance with the\nDecree, Rouser alleged two relevant instances of non-\ncompliance.5 He alleged that prison officials had (1) only\nallowed him, in the absence of the volunteer chaplain, to use\none candle, instead of seven, for the Yule 2012 Sabbat; and\n\n 5\n    Like his earlier motion to enforce, Rouser’s opposition to the motion\nto vacate focused in large part on his placement in administrative\nsegregation due to enemy concerns related to other inmates. As the\ndistrict court implicitly acknowledged in its earlier order on Rouser’s\nmotion to enforce, these allegations are “unclear” and “unrelated” to the\nConsent Decree. The majority appears to agree and does not address these\nallegations.\n\f42                   ROUSER V. WHITE\n\n(2) only allowed him, in the absence of the volunteer\nchaplain, to complete one ritual at the outdoor religious\nground since it was completed a few months earlier. The\ndistrict court determined that, even accepting these\nallegations that Defendants “have not complied with the\n[Decree] in a handful of instances” as true, they do not refute\nDefendants’ showing of substantial compliance.\n\n    The record does not show that this finding was clearly\nerroneous. Rouser did not contest most of Defendants’ sworn\ndeclaration stating that Defendants had fully complied with\nthe Decree. Accordingly, the district court could take as true\nthat Defendants complied with the Consent Decree except as\nto those provisions disputed by Rouser. The majority\nincorrectly treats all provisions in the Consent Decree not\nspecifically addressed by Defendants as having been\ninsufficiently evidenced. However, Defendants were not\nrequired to list out and address every line of the Consent\nDecree separately, and the majority errs by faulting the\ndistrict court for not holding Defendants to such a\nrequirement. A district court need not take evidence\nregarding provisions of a consent decree governing a state\nprison with which a plaintiff concedes defendants have\ncomplied. See Gilmore, 220 F.3d at 1010; 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(b)(3).\n\n     There is therefore no dispute that, for example: volunteer\nWiccan ministers now may attend and lead Wiccan services;\nweekly Esbats are now permitted; weekly Wiccan study\ngroups are now permitted; an outdoor religious area and fire\npit have been constructed for Wiccan inmates, which inmates\nhad already used during Sabbats; Wiccan services now are\nposted and announced in the same manner as other religious\nevents; Wiccan inmates are permitted to order food for\n\f                          ROUSER V. WHITE                              43\n\nSabbats and bring food to weekly Esbats and study groups;\nRouser has been allowed to order and possess all of the\npersonal religious items listed in the Decree; and Rouser may\napply and be considered for an inmate work assignment as a\nclerk to the facility chaplain.\n\n    Additionally, it is apparent that there is no dispute that\nRouser has been permitted to order and access the full list of\ngroup religious items. The single exception, according to\nRouser, was that, during one Sabbat, he was only allowed\naccess to one candle instead of seven in the absence of the\nvolunteer chaplain.6 While the Decree permits Rouser to use\nseven candles for group religious services, subject to\n“institutional safety and security concerns,” the alleged non-\ncompliance with this provision for a single service does not\nundermine Defendants’ showing of substantial compliance.\nIndeed, Rouser has not alleged that he was denied access to\nany group religious item for any weekly Esbat or any other\nSabbat.7\n\n\n  6\n    In one part of his opposition, Rouser alleges more generally that he\nwas not permitted to order candles, incense, or associated holders. This\nallegation, however, is contradicted by Rouser’s subsequent allegation that\nhe was denied access to more than one candle (with no mention of\nincense) and only during the 2012 Yule Sabbat. Indeed, Rouser does not\ndispute that he was permitted to use candles and incense during other\nSabbats and weekly Esbats. It follows that he has been permitted to order\ncandles, incense, and associated holders.\n  7\n    It is notable that the only items that have been of concern are those\ninvolving open flames, which raise obvious prison-safety concerns.\nIndeed, in responding to Rouser’s same claim in his motion to enforce\nregarding candles and incense, Defendants explained that Rouser was not\ndenied access to either candles or incense, but acknowledged “some\nmiscommunication concerning [his] access and use of an open flame\nduring services” stemming from security concerns, which had been\n\f44                        ROUSER V. WHITE\n\n    Rouser’s other allegation of non-compliance—that he was\nonly allowed to complete one ritual at the outdoor religious\nground since it was completed a few months earlier—does\nnot undermine Defendants’ showing of substantial\ncompliance either. There were three Sabbats since the\nbeginning of October—the Samhain Sabbat on October 31,\nthe Yule Sabbat on December 23, and the Imbolg Sabbat on\nFebruary 2. Before the Imbolg Sabbat had come to pass,\nDefendants declared under penalty of perjury that inmates\nused the outdoor religious area for the Samhain Sabbat and\nthe Yule Sabbat. Thus, it appears that Rouser’s concern is\neither with the Imbolg Sabbat or that, while Rouser accessed\nthe outdoor religious area during the Yule Sabbat, he could\nnot appropriately observe the event because he was denied\naccess to the requisite number of candles. Regardless, Rouser\nacknowledged that he was unable to use the outdoor religious\narea because the Wiccan volunteer chaplain was not available\nto supervise the event.\n\n    Even accepting Rouser’s allegation as true, the fact that\nhe could not use the outdoor religious area due to the absence\nof the volunteer chaplain during one Sabbat does not\nnecessarily demonstrate even an isolated violation of the\nConsent Decree. The Decree acknowledges that, in providing\nRouser “reasonable opportunities to participate in Wiccan\ngroup religious services,” prison officials must “tak[e] into\naccount factors such as the number of inmates, available\n\n\nresolved. Prison officials should, consistent with safety and administrative\nconsiderations, respect a Wiccan inmate’s interest in using candles for\nWiccan services to the same extent that inmates of other religions are\npermitted to use candles for their services. It is likely unreasonable,\nhowever, to expect prison officials to be able to supervise the use of\ncandles by Rouser and all other inmates every week of the year and on\nevery Sabbat.\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        45\n\nspace, safety and security, resources, and administrative\nconsiderations, so long as those factors are also considered in\ndetermining the access of other religious groups to regularly\nscheduled group religious activities.” Moreover, Defendants’\nprison procedures memorandum governing the use of the\noutdoor religious area makes clear that a volunteer or other\nstaff must be available to escort inmates to the event.\n\n    Indicative of its commitment to riddle the district court’s\nexercise of discretion with as many holes as possible,\nregardless of their merit, the majority goes beyond the\nallegations of non-compliance made by Rouser in his\nopposition to the motion to vacate. First, the majority faults\nthe district court and Defendants for not addressing a\nprovision of the Consent Decree that does not exist. The\nmajority says that Defendants should have addressed\nRouser’s “right to be released from confinement in time to\nattend full Wiccan services.” Maj. Op. 12. The Decree\ncontains no such provision. In fact, the Decree allows prison\nofficials to suspend its provisions “when Rouser is confined\nin Administrative Segregation.”\n\n    Second, the majority faults Defendants for not addressing\nissues that they addressed. For example, the majority faults\nDefendants for not explaining whether they had made “copies\nof a master schedule of religious services that included the\ntime and location of Wiccan events.” However, Rouser\nhimself acknowledged in a joint status report that Defendants\nhad included Wiccan events in the master schedule for\nreligious services and study groups, as required. Moreover,\nthe prison procedures memorandum states that “services shall\nbe announced in the same manner and the same extent as\n\f46                        ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nannounced for religious events of other religious groups.8 As\nwith the vast majority of other provisions in the Consent\nDecree, there is simply no dispute that Defendants have\ncomplied with this requirement.\n\n    Third, the majority faults the district court for not\nmentioning past instances of non-compliance with the\nDecree. As explained above, past instances of non-\ncompliance are of questionable relevance in deciding whether\nto vacate a consent decree entered under the PLRA, which\nrequires an “ongoing violation of the Federal right” for relief\nto be continued after two years. See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3);\nHallett, 296 F.3d at 743. In any case, the majority wrongly\nconcludes that the district court’s decision on the motion to\nenforce undermines the same court’s decision on the motion\nto vacate. The district court did not find that prison officials\nhad damaged Rouser’s necklace. Instead, it ordered prison\nofficials to adhere to the terms of the Consent Decree “[t]o\nthe extent religious items are under [their] control.” Indeed,\n\n\n  8\n    The majority’s dismissal of evidence such as the prison procedures\nmemorandum and the joint status report as “stale” illustrates how far the\nmajority oversteps its role as a reviewing court. This evidence was not\nstale—the prison procedures memorandum was less than five months old\nand the joint status report was a year old when the district court vacated\nthe Decree. Combined with Defendants’ declarations, this evidence\nconfirmed, as Rouser did not dispute in opposition to the motion to vacate,\nthat all or nearly all of the Decree’s provisions had been achieved.\nMoreover, the majority does not appreciate the difference between past,\nnow-corrected instances of non-compliance and past acts achieving\ncompliance. While corrected instances of non-compliance are of\nquestionable relevance under the PLRA, which requires an “ongoing\nviolation of the Federal right” for relief to be continued, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(b)(3), a district court obviously may look into the past in assessing\nwhether a decree’s objectives, such as commitments to construct fire pit\nand allow access to spiritual leaders, have been accomplished.\n\f                      ROUSER V. WHITE                         47\n\na “religious necklace” is not a listed item in the Consent\nDecree. To the extent that the necklace in question is the\nmedallion or pentagram, it is listed as a personal religious\nitem, which the Decree states that Rouser possesses.\n\n    The only uncontested violation of the Decree alleged in\nthe motion to enforce was Defendants’ failure to provide\nRouser with expedited inmate appeals on a few occasions.\nHowever, this procedural failure did not undermine the\npurpose of the Decree. The Decree’s purpose is to provide\nRouser with access to religious items, services, spiritual\nleadership, and facilities that are important to Wicca, not to\nprovide Rouser with expedited inmate appeals. The majority\nfails to appreciate the difference between a procedural\nmechanism and a “larger purpose” of a decree. See Otter,\n643 F.3d at 287; see also Labor/Cmty. Strategy Ctr., 564 F.3d\nat 1123.\n\n    On the record presented, the district court did not clearly\nerr in finding that Rouser’s allegations that Defendants had\nfailed to comply with the Decree in a “handful of instances”\ndid not undermine Defendants’ showing of substantial\ncompliance. The alleged “defects of performance [do] not\npervade the whole.” Connell, 170 Cal. at 556. Nor are they\n“so essential as substantially to defeat the object which the\nparties intend to accomplish.” Id. Instead, “the larger\npurposes of [the Consent Decree has] been served,” Otter,\n643 F.3d at 287, “and the situation improved greatly.”\nLabor/Cmty. Strategy Ctr., 564 F.3d at 1123. Like inmates of\nother religions, Rouser now has access, consistent with prison\nsecurity and administrative considerations, to religious items,\nservices, spiritual leadership, and facilities that are important\nto his faith. It certainly cannot be said that extending the\n\f48                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nDecree is necessary to correct an ongoing violation of\nRouser’s rights under federal law.\n\n     4. Rouser has not been deprived of due process, as he\n        concedes.\n\n    The final reason the majority gives for reversal is that the\ndistrict court violated Rouser’s due process rights by sending\nseveral orders to Rouser’s former counsel instead of Rouser.\nThis argument was not raised by Rouser on appeal and was\ntherefore abandoned. Wilcox v. Comm’r, 848 F.2d 1007,\n1008 n.2 (9th Cir. 1988). Indeed, it is the majority that\ndemonstrates “insouciance” by jumping to name-calling\nwithout having heard from the parties about due process\nconcerns.\n\n    As an initial matter, the majority inappropriately pins all\nof the blame for the misdeliveries on the district court.\nRouser’s previous attorney moved to withdraw as counsel in\n2006, citing irreconcilable differences, including Rouser’s\npropensity to pepper the court with unauthorized filings.\nAfter a hearing, the district court granted the motion to\nwithdraw subject to submission of “an order for the court’s\nsignature.” The district court subsequently reminded the\nparties that “[t]he court indicated its intent to grant this\nmotion and directed plaintiff’s counsel to file a proposed\norder.” Neither Rouser nor his former counsel ever filed the\nrequisite order and thus none was entered. Accordingly, the\nmajority faults the district court for sending court orders to a\ncounsel whose motion to withdraw was never granted and\nwho thus continued to be listed as Rouser’s counsel.\n\n   Moreover, Rouser was represented by attorneys at a major\nlaw firm from April 21, 2007, until March 28, 2012. During\n\f                      ROUSER V. WHITE                        49\n\nthis time, and certainly before withdrawing, Rouser’s counsel\ncould have notified the court that the docket should not list\nRouser’s previous attorney as a counsel of record. Even if the\nformer counsel’s ongoing listing as a counsel of record was\nnot apparent then, Rouser should have notified the district\ncourt of any problem earlier once it became apparent. The\nmajority states that Rouser clearly did so in October 2012.\nHowever, the filing that the majority references only requests\nthat “the court send him the ruling of the hearing of 10/5/12\nfor plaintiff is pro per and the only way he has been finding\nout about the hearing dates is from the response filing of\ndefendants.” The import of this single sentence of a stream-\nof-consciousness letter focused on unrelated issues, if clearer\nnow in hindsight, was undoubtedly less than obvious back\nthen. Rouser did not clearly notify the district court of the\ndelivery problem until April 24, 2013. Thereafter, on June 7,\n2013, the district court entered an order acknowledging that\nRouser had been proceeding pro se and directing the clerk to\nsend Rouser the order vacating the Consent Decree that\nRouser requested.\n\n    Even if the district court’s failure to send documents to\nRouser is partially attributed to the court and somehow\nconstituted an error of constitutional magnitude, the district\ncourt correctly concluded that Rouser suffered no prejudice.\nRouser received Defendants’ motion to vacate, learned of the\ncourt’s earlier order on his motion to enforce, and timely filed\nan opposition to the motion to vacate. Rouser has not alleged\nany prejudice.\n\n    The majority nonetheless contends that “Rouser’s failure\nto receive the court’s orders prejudiced his ability to allege\nviolations of the 2011 Decree.” Maj. Op. 15. The majority\nreasons that the docket error left Rouser in the dark about the\n\f50                        ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nrequirements that must be met before submitting notices of\nviolations of the Decree, which the majority says were set\nforth in the district court’s November 14, 2012 order denying\nRouser’s motion to enforce. The majority’s argument fails\nfor several reasons. First, it is not clear that Rouser did not\nactually obtain the November 14, 2012 order. Second, the\norder did not create any new filing requirements, it only\nreferenced the Consent Decree’s exhaustion provision. As\nthe district court noted, the Consent Decree requires that\n“allegations that Defendants violated the Decree must follow\nthe administrative procedures outlined in the Decree before\nbeing brought to this Court.” Rouser was well aware of these\nrequirements, having agreed to the Consent Decree, and thus\nsuffered no prejudice even if he did not obtain the order.\n\n    Third, the subsequent allegations made by Rouser do not\ndemonstrate that the district court erred in vacating the\nConsent Decree.9 Rouser’s allegation that he was denied the\nWitches’ Bible while in administrative segregation may be\nconcerning, but Rouser did not repeat this allegation in\nopposing the motion to vacate. Moreover, the Consent\nDecree only requires prison officials to permit Rouser access\nto the Witches’ Bible to the extent that prisoners of other\nreligious faiths are allowed to have a religious text while in\nadministrative segregation. Rouser has never alleged that\nother prisoners are allowed such texts. Nor did Rouser repeat\n\n  9\n    The majority’s lists of filings that the district court failed to address\nand orders that Rouser didn’t receive are inaccurate. The district court\naddressed Rouser’s March 13, 2013 oral argument request, which the\nmajority describes as alleging a violation of the expedited appeal\nprovision, in a March 18, 2013 Order. Appendix A incorrectly lists\nRouser as not having received the Court’s March 15, 2012 Order.\nHowever, Rouser was represented by counsel at the time that Order was\nfiled, and his counsel received the Order.\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        51\n\nhis unclear allegation regarding applying for a volunteer\nchapel clerk position. In any case, this provision does not\nguarantee that Rouser will be selected for the chaplain clerk\nposition, but only allows him “to apply and be considered for\nsuch an assignment.” In a joint status report, Rouser had\npreviously acknowledged that Defendants had determined\nthat there currently was not a chaplain clerk position open for\napplication by Rouser or any other inmate.\n\n   Thus, even if Rouser had made a due process argument,\nand even if the district court had made a due process error,\nRouser suffered no prejudice.\n\n                             III.\n\n    The district courts’s finding of substantial compliance\nwas not clearly erroneous or based on an incorrect legal\nstandard. The majority, however, imposes a standard for\nterminating consent decrees that is inconsistent with our\nprecedent and federal courts’ limited role in overseeing\nreform of state prisons. The majority also overreaches our\nrole as an appellate court by refusing to provide the district\ncourt the special deference that it is due in this case and\noffhandedly dismissing evidence that the trial court found\ncompelling.\n\n    The record shows that the basic purpose of the Consent\nDecree has been achieved. Prison officials now permit\nRouser, like inmates of other faiths, to practice his religion\nwhile incarcerated, consistent with security and\nadministrative considerations. Rouser has reasonable access\nto the religious items, services, spiritual leadership, and\nfacilities that are important to his faith. Prison officials\nprovide Wiccan events with resources comparable to those\n\f52                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nprovided for events of other religions, such as publicity, food,\nand staffing. While strictly observing any faith, particularly\none involving many rituals, is undoubtedly difficult for an\ninmate, whose rights are not coextensive with those of the\ngeneral public, Rouser’s ability to observe Wicca is greatly\nimproved. It is time for this twenty-three-year-old case to be\ndismissed. Accordingly, I dissent.\n\f",

Despite Wicca’s relative\nobscurity, Rouser was not its only adherent in the California\nState Prison at Sacramento. In 1992, he petitioned on behalf\nof himself and some thirty fellow Wiccan inmates that the\nprison recognize Wicca as a bona fide religion and afford its\nfollowers the same rights accorded to inmates of other faiths.\nSpecifically, Rouser sought to (1) possess Wiccan ritual items\nlike candles, incense and Tarot cards; (2) access A Witches\nBible Compleat when placed in administrative segregation;\n(3) use the prison chapel for Wiccan ceremonies; and (4)\nreceive the ministry of a Wiccan chaplain.\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                         5\n\n    When the prison denied his requests, Rouser filed a civil\nrights complaint in the Eastern District of California. After\nDistrict Judge Karlton set the matter for trial, the parties\nentered into a comprehensive settlement agreement (the\n“1997 Agreement”). The agreement applied to “any\ninstitution under the jurisdiction of the California Department\nof Corrections (CDC) to which [Rouser] is assigned” and\ndescribed how the prisons and their staff would accommodate\nRouser’s religious needs.\n\n    Over the next 14 years, Rouser notified the court of\nvarious ways in which the CDC and its employees violated\nthe terms of the 1997 Agreement in the three facilities where\nhe was housed. Rouser alleged, for example, that officials\nsuspended Wiccan services while permitting other religious\nservices; precluded him from ordering religious items like\ncandles, oil, incense and herbs; prevented inmates from\ntimely attending Wiccan services; and disregarded his\nadministrative complaints.\n\n    Judge Karlton eventually granted a preliminary\ninjunction. In a 33-page order, he found that prison officials\nsubstantially burdened Rouser’s religious exercise by\n“[i]nhibiting [his] timely receipt of religious articles” and\n“[i]nhibiting group worship.” A year later, the parties entered\ninto another settlement agreement, which the district court\nadopted as a consent decree (“2011 Decree”) and is at the\nheart of this appeal. The decree reaffirmed the promises the\nCDC made in the 1997 Agreement and provided Rouser with\nadditional privileges: He was allowed to possess listed\nreligious items in his cell; he was entitled to attend weekly\n“esbats” and eight annual “sabbats” at an outdoor religious\nactivity area; and CDC employees would “develop a\nprocedure that allows the volunteer Wiccan minister . . . to\n\f6                     ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nobtain access to Wiccan group worship articles in a timely\nmanner for use at Wiccan esbats and sabbats.” In addition,\nRouser was permitted to bypass the informal, formal and first\nlevels of appeal and file a second-level appeal directly with\nthe warden or his designee to report any noncompliance with\nthe 2011 Decree.\n\n    The decree provided that after one year, defendants could\nmove for termination by showing that they had substantially\ncomplied with its terms. After approving the 2011 Decree,\nJudge Karlton transferred the case to the U.S. District Court\nfor the Central District of California on the parties’ motion.\n\n     Several months after the 2011 Decree went into effect,\nRouser filed a motion to enforce its terms and asked for a\npreliminary injunction. He argued that officials violated the\n2011 Decree in at least five ways: by damaging a religious\nnecklace in their custody; by canceling and suspending\nWiccan services without a legitimate justification; by\nprohibiting Rouser from using candles in his worship; and by\nfailing to construct an outdoor religious worship area. Most\nsignificantly, Rouser alleged that they screened and\ndisregarded his direct appeals to the warden. Defendants\ndenied or attempted to justify some of their actions, but didn’t\ncontest Rouser’s allegations that his appeals weren’t being\nprocessed in accordance with the terms of the 2011 Decree.\nAnd they all but conceded that they violated the decree by\ndenying Rouser access to candles.\n\n    The district court found that defendants had violated the\n2011 Decree in two ways: by damaging the religious necklace\nand dismissing Rouser’s grievances before they reached the\nwarden. The court reminded defendants to “adhere to the\nterms of the Decree” but didn’t order them to replace the\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                         7\n\nnecklace or grant any other relief. The court found no willful\nviolation of the provision permitting Rouser to use candles—\nonly a temporary prohibition due to a miscommunication that\nwas later resolved. As to the remaining claims, the district\ncourt faulted Rouser for failing to provide sufficient evidence\nto meet his burden of proving noncompliance. Rouser,\nhowever, had provided a sworn declaration, a prison\nmemorandum and a statement under penalty of perjury from\nanother inmate to support his claims that the prison had no\njustification for canceling and suspending Wiccan services.\nDefendants presented their own sworn statements\ncontradicting Rouser’s allegations, and the district court\ntacitly resolved the factual disputes in favor of defendants\nwithout an evidentiary hearing or even an acknowledgment\nthat Rouser had presented contrary evidence.\n\n    Three months later, defendants moved to vacate the\ndecree on grounds of substantial compliance. They relied on\nthe declaration of Correctional Counselor Nathan Wilcox,\nwho claimed that defendants “fully complied” with the 2011\nDecree, but he discussed only some of its terms and said\nnothing about compliance with the other terms. See infra p.\n12. Nor did he claim that defendants had remedied the two\nviolations the court had found just three months earlier.\nWilcox relied on an internal prison memorandum that set\nforth procedures for facilitating Wiccan group worship. But\nthat memorandum was dated October 2012 and thus predated\nthe district court’s finding that defendants had frustrated\nWiccan group worship by damaging the religious necklace\nand failing to give Rouser direct access to the warden for his\ngrievances.\n\n   Rouser disputed that the prison complied with the 2011\nDecree and sought an evidentiary hearing, claiming that he’d\n\f8                     ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nrecently been prevented from ordering candles and incense.\nIn their reply, defendants maintained that Rouser failed to\n“articulate any legitimate basis for extending this Court’s . . .\n2011 Order,” and asked the court to deny the motion without\na hearing or oral argument.\n\n    The court complied. It concluded in a minute order that\n“[d]efendants have demonstrated by a preponderance of the\nevidence that they have substantially complied with the terms\nof the settlement agreement.” The court didn’t mention its\nearlier finding that defendants had violated the 2011 Decree.\nRather, the court found that Wilcox’s declaration and the\noutdated prison memo showed defendants took “significant\nsteps to follow the settlement agreement” (emphasis added).\nFinding this sufficient to show substantial compliance, the\ncourt concluded that Rouser’s allegations of noncompliance,\neven if assumed to be true, were “insufficient to render\nDefendants substantially non-compliant” with the 2011\nDecree.\n\n                        DISCUSSION\n\n    We review for abuse of discretion the district court’s\ndecision to terminate a consent decree.

Purpose and History of the 2011 Decree\n\n    Our case law instructs district courts deciding a motion to\nvacate a consent decree to first consider “the more general\ngoals of the decree.” Otter, 643 F.3d at 288 (quoting\nYoungblood v. Dalzell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555827\"><a href=\"/opinion/555827/tilford-youngblood-ralph-nichols-individually-and-on-behalf-of-the-class/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 960 (6th Cir. 1991)).\nThen the court should examine defendants’ entire “record of\ncompliance.” Id.

We have reversed a district court’s termination\nof a consent decree for failing to explicitly consider the\n“goals of the decree[]” and only evaluating compliance with\nindividual action items. Id. at 289.\n\n     The district court overlooked the teachings of Otter.\nNowhere in its terse minute order did it mention the\ndefendants’ record of compliance—either with the 2011\nDecree or its predecessor—“which over the course of the\nlitigation has been far from exemplary.” Id. at 288. Nor did\nit analyze whether the purposes of the 2011 Decree had been\n“adequately served” by defendants. Id. at 289.\n\n    The dissent claims that the district court identified the\npurpose of the decree by explaining that Rouser initially\nbrought suit for, and entered into a settlement that governs,\nhis “right to practice his religion, Wicca.” See Diss. at 38.\nBut these passing observations don’t satisfy Otter’s\nrequirement that a district court give “[e]xplicit consideration\n[to] the goals of the decree[].” 643 F.3d at 289. Nor do they\ncomply with Otter’s requirement that the district court find\n\f10                   ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nthat “those goals have been adequately served” before\nvacating the decree. Id.\n\n    This alone provides sufficient grounds for reversing the\norder vacating the decree. Id. But there’s much more.\nBecause the case must be returned to the district court, we\nnote numerous other errors so that they will not be repeated\non remand.\n\n               II. Substantial Compliance\n\n     A. Definition\n\n     The district court didn’t evaluate whether defendants\nsubstantially complied with each of the 2011 Decree’s terms.\nInstead, it concluded that they “complied with the [2011\nDecree]” as a whole. As such, it abused its discretion by\napplying law incorrectly. Id. at 283.

Like terms in a\ncontract, distinct provisions of consent decrees are\nindependent obligations, each of which must be satisfied\nbefore there can be a finding of substantial compliance.\nAccordingly, courts don’t release parties from a consent\ndecree unless they have substantially complied with every one\nof its provisions.\n\n    In Hallett v. Morgan we affirmed the district court’s\nruling that a prison substantially complied with the specific\nprovisions of a consent decree requiring the facility to\n\f                     ROUSER V.

At the same time, we\nreversed its determination that the prison substantially\ncomplied with the “other medical care provisions” of the\ndecree. Id. at 750–51. We also tacitly endorsed the Otter\ndistrict court’s approach of separately evaluating whether\ndefendants complied with individual “Action Items” in a\nconsent decree. Otter, 643 F.3d at 285; see also Washington\nv. Penwell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414420\"><a href=\"/opinion/414420/raymond-washington-v-clayton-penwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">700</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 572 (9th Cir. 1983) (remanding to\ndistrict court for failing to analyze compliance with one of\nseveral obligations in a consent decree).\n\n    The district court thus erred by applying the wrong legal\nstandard for substantial compliance. The court was satisfied\nthat the decree had been complied with because defendants\nhad taken “significant steps to follow the settlement\nagreement.” See supra p. 8. But merely taking significant\nsteps toward implementing the decree falls far short of\n“substantial compliance.” While the term is not amenable to\na “mathematically precise definition,” Otter, 643 F.3d at 284\n(quoting Joseph A. v. N.M. Dep’t of Human Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707584\"><a href=\"/opinion/707584/joseph-a-and-josephine-a-by-their-next-friend-corrine-wolfe-michael-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1081</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1085 (10th Cir. 1995)), state law gives it meaning. Id.\nAnd in California a party is deemed to have substantially\ncomplied with an obligation only where any deviation is\n“unintentional and so minor or trivial as not ‘substantially to\ndefeat the object which the parties intend to accomplish.’”\nWells Benz, Inc. v.

Diss. at 36. Deviations are permitted so\nlong as they don’t defeat the object of the decree. But merely\ntaking significant steps toward compliance comes nowhere\n\f12                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nnear satisfying this exacting standard. Rather, the district\ncourt should have first found that defendants substantially\ncomplied with each of the decree’s terms for a substantial\nperiod before terminating the decree.\n\n     B. Application\n\n    The record did not contain sufficient evidence to permit\nthe district court to conclude that defendants met the\nsubstantial-compliance standard. For one, the district court\nhad found, just four months earlier, that defendants had not\ncomplied with provisions related to custody over group\nworship supplies and expedited administrative appeals.\nWilcox says nothing in his declaration to indicate that\ndefendants had remedied these defects.             Given this\nuncontested record of violations and the absence of any\nevidence that the deficient performance had been remedied,\nthe district court’s conclusion that there has been substantial\ncompliance rested on a “clearly erroneous finding of material\nfact.” Otter, 643 F.3d at 283 (quoting Casey v. Albertson’s\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785643\"><a href=\"/opinion/785643/shannon-casey-v-albertsons-inc-a-delaware-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1257 (9th Cir. 2004)).\n\n    More significant still, defendants failed to establish\naltogether that they complied with several action items in the\n2011 Decree. For example, defendants agreed to make copies\nof a master schedule of religious services that included the\ntime and location of Wiccan events. Nothing in the record\ndocuments that they fulfilled this obligation. And what of\nRouser’s ability to access his Wiccan bible in administrative\nsegregation? Or his right to be released from confinement in\ntime to attend full Wiccan services? We don’t know, because\ndefendants presented no evidence and the district court made\nno findings as to these terms of the 2011 Decree. There is no\nindication that the district court was aware of these terms\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        13\n\nwhen it entered its order. Yet a consent decree may not be\nterminated without well-supported findings that all of its\nterms have been faithfully complied with for a substantial\nperiod.\n\n    The dissent doesn’t explain how defendants could\npossibly show substantial compliance with all key obligations\nin a consent decree by only complying with some of those\nobligations. Nor does it explain how Rouser could\n“concede[]” that defendants complied with decree provisions\nthat weren’t mentioned in their motion to vacate. Diss. at 42.\nThe dissent relies on stale documents—the 2012 internal\nprison memorandum and a year-old joint status report—to\nsupport its claim that the prison was complying with all\ndecree provisions in 2013. Diss. at 45–46. That’s\ninconsistent with our caselaw requiring courts to examine the\n“record reflecting [prison] conditions as of the time\ntermination is sought.” Gilmore v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769703\"><a href=\"/opinion/769703/robert-o-gilmore-jr-and-inmates-of-san-quentin-state-prison-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1010 (9th Cir. 2000). It’s also at odds with the dissent’s own\nwarning that “past instances of non-compliance are of\nquestionable relevance in deciding whether to vacate a\nconsent decree.” Diss. at 46.\n\n    In addition to these gaps in the record, the district court\noverlooked those of defendants’ claims that Rouser disputed.\nSpecifically, Rouser alleged that he was only allowed one\nritual outdoors. And he claimed that he wasn’t allowed to use\nthe seven candles specified in the 2011 Decree or obtain\nincense—both of which were important components of\noutdoor group worship. Where there is a factual dispute\nabout whether defendants substantially complied with a\ndecree, the district court may not simply “examine the\n[existing] record for ‘findings.’” Gilmore, 220 F.3d at 1010.\nRather, the court must take evidence on the current conditions\n\f14                        ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nat the prison. Id. As the dissent acknowledges, the district\ncourt didn’t follow this rule, even though Rouser contested\n“two relevant instances” of defendants’ compliance. Diss. at\n41–42. The defendants’ alleged failures weren’t merely\n“trivial” deviations warranting a finding of substantial\ncompliance. Connell, 150 P. at 775. If true, Rouser’s\nallegations would have documented material noncompliance\nwith the terms of the decree and thus precluded any finding\nof substantial compliance. Accordingly, the district court\nshould have—but didn’t—conduct a hearing before deciding\nmaterial factual disputes related to defendants’ compliance\nwith the decree.\n\n                    III. Denial of Due Process\n\n    The district court terminated the 2011 Decree at a time\nwhen Rouser wasn’t receiving notice of its orders. The court\nhad granted Rouser’s request to proceed pro se on March 28,\n2012 and had recorded his address as the California State\nPrison, Los Angeles County, in Lancaster. However, the\ndocket was not updated to reflect the address change, and the\ncourt continued to send its orders to Rouser’s former\ncounsel—almost two dozen over the course of two years.\nEach of those was returned to the district court as\nundeliverable.1 Once back, a deputy clerk dutifully filed and\n\n\n   1\n     Although the court substituted Rouser for a few of his attorneys when\nit granted his request to proceed pro se, the docket continued to show that\nRouser was being represented by attorney Richard Bates. Rouser had\nretained Bates in 2004 to represent him during his proceedings in the\nEastern District of California. Although Bates withdrew as counsel in\n2006, he was not removed as counsel of record until after Rouser filed his\nappeal. The dissent claims that the withdrawal was conditioned on Rouser\nfiling a separate order, which he never did. Diss. at 48. But the district\ncourt’s minute entry indicates that Bates was dismissed even absent the\n\f                          ROUSER V. WHITE                                15\n\ndocketed them. See Appendix A. But nobody bothered to\ncorrect the service address or resend the court’s orders to\nRouser in prison.\n\n    Rouser wrote to the court on October 27, 2012, explaining\nthat he was “pro per and the only way he has been finding out\nabout the [court’s] hearing dates is from the response filing of\nthe defendants.” If anyone read this statement on the first\npage of Rouser’s pleading, nobody bothered to find out why\nRouser was not getting the court’s orders or implement the\naddress change. The court’s orders continued to be sent\nto—and immediately returned from—Rouser’s former\nattorney’s address.\n\n    Rouser’s failure to receive the court’s orders prejudiced\nhis ability to allege violations of the 2011 Decree. The\ncourt’s November 15, 2012 order instructed Rouser on the\nproper format under the local rules for submitting notices of\nadditional violations. It also informed him that the court\nwould disregard any noncompliant filings dated after October\n9, 2012. Rouser had no way of knowing about this ruling. So\nhe was unfairly denied the chance to re-file his flawed notices\nand effectively oppose the motion to vacate the consent\ndecree.\n\n    Had Rouser submitted his notices in the proper format,\nthe district court would have been confronted with a host of\nadditional allegations of non-compliance. Rouser claimed in\n\n\nfiling of an order for the court’s signature. In any case, the district court\nwas well aware of Rouser’s pro se status, as it signed and filed his 2012\nattorney-substitution request identifying him as proceeding “pro se.”\nThus, despite knowing Rouser was pro se, the court delivered Rouser’s\ncopy of its orders to Bates as if he were still Rouser’s attorney.\n\f16                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nhis several defective filings that defendants deprived him of\nthe Wiccan bible in administrative segregation; prevented\nhim from applying for the volunteer chapel clerk position;\nand continued to deny him direct access to the warden for his\ngrievances. If true, each of these claims would have\namounted to a material violation of the 2011 Decree.\n\n    Most troubling is the district court’s cavalier response\nonce it finally realized that Rouser had not been receiving its\norders. Rouser, apparently unaware that the case was over,\nwrote to the court on April 12, 2013, explaining that he’d\nlearned that all of the court’s orders had been sent to his\nformer counsel. Rouser claimed that he had been “effectively\ndenied all due process and basically [had] been forced to fly\nblind.” He specifically sought leave to appeal “[i]f the judge\nhas granted the defendants’ motion [to terminate the decree]”\nand requested the district court send him past orders. On the\nsame day, he sent a letter addressed to the clerk’s office,\nexplaining that his former counsel left the case in 2006, that\nhe was a “pro per plaintiff” and that he had not received\norders from the court, which denied him “all due process.”\nThe docket does not reflect any response from either the court\nor the clerk’s office to Rouser’s letters.\n\n    On May 27, 2013, Rouser sent a strongly worded letter to\nthe deputy state attorney general who served as counsel for\ndefendants, with a copy to the court. In it, he declared that\nthe court had “refused to send [him] any of its orders\nconcerning this case . . . [w]hen it knows [he is] pro per and\n[has] been filing all motions and responses [himself].”\nExasperated, Rouser wrote: “I am at a loss on how to get this\ncourt to send me copies of its orders . . . . I have [written to]\nthe clerk as well and don’t know if I need to go to someone\n\f                      ROUSER V. WHITE                        17\n\nelse or who else is it when the court will not send you rulings\nin your own case.”\n\n    The court finally sent a copy of its order terminating the\ndecree to Rouser on June 7, 2013. It declined to give Rouser\nadditional time to oppose the now-moot motion to vacate,\nreasoning that Rouser already availed himself of the\nopportunity to respond to the motion. The court faulted\nRouser for failing to keep it advised of his address and\nconcluded that his failure to receive orders was due to his\nown oversight. The court, however, overlooked its own order\nof March 28, 2012 granting Rouser’s request to proceed pro\nse and recording his address as the Lancaster prison. Rouser\nhas remained at that prison since. The failure to effectuate\nRouser’s address change was thus the court’s fault, not\nRouser’s.\n\n     This breakdown of communication between the court and\nRouser is at loggerheads with the court’s obligation to alert\npro se litigants that they are entitled to submit evidence when\nthe district court is about to resolve a dispositive motion.

Angelone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719812\"><a href=\"/opinion/719812/96-cal-daily-op-serv-4442-96-daily-journal-dar-7181-charles-oren/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 935 (9th Cir. 1996).

To this day, there’s nothing in the record\nindicating that anyone in the Central District of California has\npaused to question why so many returned orders are being\ndocketed in this case.

WHITE\n\neffect.2 This raises doubts as to whether the judge or anyone\nelse paid sufficient attention to Rouser’s pleadings.

The court committed numerous errors in\nterminating a consent decree that had been carefully crafted\nover the course of two decades. The court applied the wrong\nlegal standard and found substantial compliance without\ngiving due attention to the various exacting obligations\nembodied in the decree, and without considering whether the\npurpose of the decree had been served. The court\nimprovidently refused to hold an evidentiary hearing to\nresolve material factual disputes about whether defendants\nhad complied with the decree. The court also encouraged\nnoncompliance by finding that defendants had violated the\nconsent decree, yet refusing to grant any meaningful relief.\n\n    In light of the court’s own findings, only four months\nearlier, that defendants had failed to comply with material\n\n\n 2\n   As discussed, in October 2012, Rouser filed a pleading indicating that\nhe was only receiving notice of hearing dates from the “response filing of\nthe defendants.” Then in April 2013, he wrote to the court and the clerk’s\noffice explaining that he was a pro se plaintiff and had not received the\ncourt’s orders, and was thus deprived of due process. When the district\ncourt and the clerk’s office remained silent, Rouser sent a letter to\nopposing counsel with a copy to the court, saying that he was “at a loss on\nhow to get [the] court to send [him] copies of its orders.” All of these\ncommunications were docketed and filed but had no effect until June 7,\n2013, when the court eventually sent Rouser a copy of the order\nterminating the decree.\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        19\n\naspects of the decree, and with no proof that those failures\nhad been remedied, termination of the decree was clearly an\nabuse of discretion. Under no circumstances should the\ndistrict court consider terminating a decree unless and until\nthere has been a substantial period of substantial\ncompliance—in this case no less than a year—with every one\nof its terms.\n\n    The district court’s protracted failure to correct Rouser’s\naddress, and its repeated failure to re-send notices of orders\nthat had been returned as undeliverable, raises even broader\nquestions. Bluntly stated, the record documented in\nAppendix A casts doubt on whether anyone in the Central\nDistrict of California’s Clerk’s Office is paying attention to\nthe important and sensitive process of providing parties with\nfair notice of the court’s orders. How can it be that the\ndistrict court failed to implement the change of address for\nthe delivery of orders after granting Rouser’s motion to\nproceed pro se, and then ignored almost two dozen orders that\nwere returned to the court as undeliverable? Is the problem\nwe note here limited to this case or does it reflect an absence\nof procedures designed to prevent and correct such errors in\nother cases? We find it inconceivable that a properly run\nclerk’s office would permit this to go on over the course of\nyears.\n\n    We therefore VACATE the district court’s order\nterminating the consent decree, REINSTATE the 2011\nConsent Decree and REMAND the case to the district court\nfor further proceedings consistent with our opinion.

WHITE\n\nCALLAHAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n     In 1993, William Rouser filed suit against California state\nprison officials (Defendants), alleging that they had infringed\nhis right to practice Wicca while incarcerated in violation of\nthe Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S.\nConstitution, among other laws. Twenty years later, the\ndistrict court concluded that a court-approved settlement\nagreement (the Consent Decree) balancing Rouser’s ability to\npractice Wicca with prison officials’ need to maintain safe\nprisons had served its purpose. The court therefore vacated\nthe Decree. We must decide whether the district court abused\nits discretion in determining that Defendants had substantially\ncomplied with the Decree.\n\n     The majority’s reversal of the district court improperly\ndenies the heightened deference due a trial court’s finding\nthat a consent decree aimed at institutional reform has served\nits purpose, is at odds with the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n(PLRA), and is undermined by a record showing compliance\nthat is substantial. The majority rules that a party seeking to\nterminate a consent decree, including decrees involving\nfederal-court intervention in state prisons, must demonstrate\ncompliance with every one of a decree’s provisions for a\nsubstantial period of time. This rule effectively requires full,\nnot substantial compliance. The rule is contrary to our\nprecedent and Congressional intent, and it thrusts federal\ncourts beyond their institutional competence. I dissent.\n\n                               I.\n\n   Understanding the district court’s determination that\nDefendants have substantially complied with the Consent\nDecree first requires understanding the Decree’s contents and\n\f                      ROUSER V. WHITE                         25\n\nthe events preceding its vacatur. The majority does not\nexplain the Decree’s numerous provisions and instead focuses\non, and incorrectly describes, the few provisions that Rouser\nsays have been violated. The majority’s failure to\nacknowledge the undisputed breadth of Defendants’\ncompliance is not without irony given that the majority faults\nthe district court for not addressing “every one of [the\nDecree’s] provisions.” Maj. Op. 10 (emphasis in original).\n\nA. The Consent Decree\n\n    Since Rouser initiated this lawsuit, the district court,\namong other things, approved a private settlement agreement\nin 1997, reopened the case in 2004 following Rouser’s\nmotion to enforce the settlement agreement, and granted\nRouser a preliminary injunction in 2010. After Defendants\nnoticed that they intended to appeal the district court’s\npreliminary injunction order, the parties agreed to mediation\nand, in 2011, reached a court-approved settlement agreement\nthat is the focus of this appeal.\n\n    The Consent Decree provides Rouser with access to listed\npersonal religious items, including the Witches’ Bible, the\nBook of Shadows, other religious literature, a deck of tarot\ncards, up to four ounces of listed oils, listed herbs, up to five\none-inch stones or ten one-half-inch stones, four feathers, a\npentagram or other approved Wiccan medallion, and one\npackage of eighteen seashells not larger than one-half inch in\ndiameter. While in administrative segregation or the security\nhousing unit Rouser is allowed access only to the Witches’\nBible, and only to the extent that prisoners of other religious\nfaiths are allowed to have a religious text in those units. The\nDecree provides Rouser with access to a different set of items\nfor group religious services, including candles and candle\n\f26                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nholders, incense and incense holders, listed oils, water, salt,\nlisted herbs, tarot cards, a drum, feathers, stones, seashells, a\nwood wand, a chalice or ritual cup, a small bell, a drum, an\naltar and altar cloth, and a small picture or statue of deities.\nWhile the Decree permits Rouser to use seven candles for\ngroup religious services, his access is subject to institutional\nsafety and security concerns, including applicable fire safety\nregulations. Prison officials maintain custody and control\nover these group religious items while they are not in use.\n\n    The Consent Decree requires Defendants to provide\nRouser with “reasonable opportunities to participate” in\nWiccan events, including weekly services called Esbats,\nweekly religious study groups, and special religious services\ncalled Sabbats. In fulfilling these obligations, however, the\nDecree recognizes that Defendants also must “tak[e] into\naccount factors such as the number of inmates, available\nspace, safety and security, resources, and administrative\nconsiderations.” Sabbats are held eight times a year, and\nprison officials are required to “use their reasonable efforts to\nschedule the Sabbats on the dates identified.” If a Sabbat is\ncancelled for administrative reasons, prison officials must\nreschedule the Sabbat at the earliest practicable date.\nHowever, the Decree provides that officials will not\nreschedule a Sabbat cancelled because of inmate-caused\nsafety or security concerns. The Decree requires Defendants\nto construct a fire pit and outdoor worship area, which Rouser\nmay use during Sabbats. A volunteer Wiccan minister may\nattend and lead Wiccan services.\n\n    The Decree also includes provisions aimed at ensuring\nthat prison officials treat Wicca similarly to how they treat\nother religions. For example, the Decree provides that the\nschedule, time, and location of Wiccan events will be posted\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        27\n\nand announced in the same manner as other religious events\nand that Rouser may apply and be considered for an inmate\nwork assignment as a clerk to the facility chaplain. The\nDecree requires prison officials to provide food for Sabbats\nto the extent that they provide food for special religious\nobservances of other religious groups. Similarly, if prison\nofficials allow inmates to bring food or canteen items to\nreligious services and study groups, they will permit Rouser\nto bring comparable food or canteen items to weekly Wiccan\nservices and study groups.\n\n    More generally, the Decree provides Rouser with an\nexpedited inmate appeals process for appeals relating to\nnoncompliance with the Decree. It also provides that prison\nofficials may temporarily suspend the Decree’s provisions in\nemergencies, for security reasons, or when Rouser is confined\nin administrative segregation or the secure housing unit.\nFinally, the Decree includes a termination provision stating\nthat, one year after its filing, Defendants could move to\nvacate the decree, dismiss the action with prejudice, and enter\njudgment on the ground that the preponderance of the\nevidence shows they have substantially complied with the\nDecree.\n\n    In sum, the Consent Decree’s central goal is to permit\nRouser, like inmates of other faiths, to practice his religion\nwhile incarcerated consistent with prison officials’ need to\nmaintain safe, orderly prisons in the face of finite resources.\nAchieving this goal requires prison officials to permit Rouser\nreasonable access to the religious items, services, and\nfacilities that are important to Wicca.\n\f28                   ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nB. Post-Settlement Litigation\n\n    Defendants proceeded to fulfill their obligations under the\nConsent Decree after the district court entered it on October\n18, 2011. On March 8, 2012, the parties filed a joint status\nreport describing Defendants’ compliance. The parties stated\nthat Defendants had provided Rouser with access to all\nspecified personal and group religious items, allowed Rouser\nto order additional religious items, progressed with\nconstruction of the fire pit, included Wiccan events in the\nmaster schedule for religious services and study groups,\nsecured a volunteer Wiccan minister, and determined that\nthere currently was not a chaplain clerk position open for\napplication by Rouser or any other inmate. Defendants\npermitted Rouser to attend Wiccan services and activities on\na regular basis, though Rouser complained that “there have\nbeen several instances where services were not timely started\nor were otherwise canceled.”               Rouser, however,\nacknowledged that he was able to avail himself of an\nexpedited inmate appeals process to address his concern.\n\n    On July 26, 2012, Rouser, now proceeding pro se, filed\nthe first of a series of documents with the district court\nseeking to compel Defendants’ compliance with the Consent\nDecree. He alleged that (1) a religious necklace had been\ndamaged; (2) the December 2011 Yule Sabbat had been\ncanceled due to a contraband-related “laundry sweep”; (3)\nweekly services had been “terminated indefinitely” for two\nweeks; (4) officers were “desecrating” religious items in their\ncustody by touching them while dispensing them; (5) the\noutdoor religious area under construction had not been\ncompleted; and (6) he had twice been denied expedited\nprisoner appeals.

WHITE                        29\n\nsegregation, where he alleged that he was placed due to\n“enemy concerns” related to a Protestant inmate. He also\nalleged that Defendants told him that he could not order\ncandles and incense.\n\n    Defendants responded with declarations from prison staff.\nDefendants explained that, consistent with the Consent\nDecree, the Yule Sabbat was “canceled due to inmate-caused\nsafety and security issues, specifically reports of contraband\nin the inmate laundry that precipitated a temporary lockdown\nof the prison facility.” They explained that Wiccan weekly\nservices were briefly suspended following a May 9, 2012\nservice during which “volunteers covered up windows in the\nchapel with inmates inside, restricting the view into the area,\nthereby creating a significant safety and security breach\nwithin the prison.” The suspension was lifted two weeks\nlater, immediately after the Wiccan volunteers returned and\nwere further instructed on compliance with prison procedures.\nDefendants averred that Rouser’s religious necklace, which\nis not listed among the group religious items kept by prison\nofficials, was damaged while it was in his control.\nDefendants confirmed that they completed construction of the\noutdoor religious activity area and fire pit on August 21,\n2012, and that Rouser had made use of the area since that\ntime. Addressing Rouser’s latter allegations, Defendants\nexplained that Rouser was not denied access to either candles\nor incense, but acknowledged “some miscommunication\nconcerning [his] access and use of an open flame during\nservices” stemming from security concerns, which had been\nresolved.\n\n   On November 15, 2012, the district court consolidated\nmost of Rouser’s numerous filings and denied most of his\n\f30                      ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nclaims.1 The court began by noting that many of Rouser’s\nallegations were “unclear, unsupported, or unrelated to the\nterms of the Decree.” The court found that prison officials\nhad not violated the Decree by improperly cancelling\nservices, noting that the officials provided evidence that\nservices were properly cancelled because of security and\nsafety threats. The court found that prison officials had not\ndenied Rouser access to an outdoor religious area or\n“desecrated” religious items by touching them, as they must\nin order to keep and dispense them. The court acknowledged\nRouser’s allegation that a necklace had been damaged and\nother unspecified items had been stolen, and ordered prison\nofficials to adhere to the terms of the Consent Decree “[t]o\nthe extent religious items are under [their] control.”\nAddressing the only uncontested violation of the Decree, the\ncourt ordered Defendants to provide Rouser with expedited\ninmate appeals concerning the Decree.\n\nC. Vacatur of the Consent Decree\n\n     A few months later, on February 4, 2013, Defendants\nmoved to vacate the Consent Decree. In support of the\nmotion, Defendants provided a declaration from Nathan\nWilcox, a Correctional Counselor and Litigation Coordinator\nat the Lancaster Prison. Wilcox attested to Defendants’ “full\ncompliance with the terms of the Consent Decree, including\nthe construction of the outdoor religious area and Plaintiff’s\naccess to religious items.” Wilcox stated that Rouser had\nbeen provided access to the personal religious items set forth\nin the Decree, including “tarot cards, oils, herbs, stones,\n\n\n  1\n    On November 28, 2012, the court issued a separate order denying\nRouser’s other outstanding motions because Rouser had failed to comply\nwith the Consent Decree’s exhaustion requirement.\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        31\n\nfeathers, and shells.” Rouser also had received access to all\nreligious group items for Wiccan services, and had “been\npermitted to order and purchase additional religious items.”\nEsbats now were scheduled and held on a weekly basis with\nthe assistance of a volunteer Wiccan minister, subject to\ninstitutional safety and security concerns. A fire pit and\noutdoor religious worship area had been constructed for\nWiccan inmates’ use. Wilcox explained that Wiccan inmates\nused the outdoor religious area for the Samhain Sabbat on\nOctober 31, 2012, and the Yule Sabbat on December 23,\n2012. Defendants also submitted an October 18, 2012\nmemorandum requiring Wiccan service “to be announced in\nthe same manner and to the same extent as announced for\nreligious events of other religious groups,” and detailing\nprocedures for storage of group religious items and use of the\noutdoor religious area.\n\n    On February 21, 2013, Rouser opposed the motion to\nvacate, alleging that prison officials had only allowed him, in\nthe absence of a volunteer chaplain, to complete one ritual at\nthe outdoor religious ground since it was completed and to\nuse one candle, instead of seven, for the 2012 Yule Sabbat.\n\n    On March 13, 2013, the district court granted the motion\nto vacate and entered judgment for Defendants. Citing to\ndeclarations by prison staff and “internal prison procedures\nsetting forth approved Wiccan religious activities,” the court\nruled that Defendants had demonstrated by a preponderance\nof the evidence that they had substantially complied with\nDecree. The court explained that “[a]lthough it is not entirely\nclear from his Opposition, Plaintiff contends that Defendants\nhave not complied with the settlement agreement in a handful\nof instances.” The court concluded that, even assuming these\n\f32                         ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nallegations to be true, they did not overcome Defendants’\nshowing of substantial compliance.\n\n                                     II.\n\n    The district court’s three-page order granting the motion\nto vacate is terse. Indeed, if the majority simply vacated and\nremanded for further explanation little ink would be spilled\nin dissent.2 However, the majority goes much further, rattling\noff supposed errors like a gatling gun. In doing so, the\nmajority commits larger legal errors related to the standards\napplicable to the termination of consent decrees governing\nstate prisons.\n\nA.

A trial court in an institutional reform case is due\nspecial deference not only because of its familiarity with any\nprogress toward compliance and past instances of non-\ncompliance, but also because of its better understanding of\nthe challenges that might make more perfect compliance\nunrealistic. For example, in overseeing a decree governing\nthe management of state prisons, the trial court “develop[s]\nan understanding of the difficulties involved in . . . managing\na jail that an appellate court, even with the best possible\nbriefing, could never hope to match.” Rufo v.

Op. 8. But even\nassuming that a district court must oversee a consent decree\nfor some threshold amount of time before deference is due,\ntwo years of managing a decree is more than enough. This\ncase’s history demonstrates that the district court is far better\npositioned than we are to determine if Defendants have\nsubstantially complied with the Decree. As noted, the district\ncourt decided to grant the motion to vacate not long after\ngranting in part and denying in part Rouser’s motion to\nenforce. The district court was thus very familiar with the\n\f34                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nchallenges facing prison officials’ compliance, the steps that\nDefendants had made toward achieving full compliance, and\nthe nature of Rouser’s remaining allegations of non-\ncompliance.\n\n     That the district court’s experience supervising the Decree\nfor two years is enough to merit deference is also supported\nby the PLRA, pursuant to which the Consent Decree was\nentered. The PLRA provides that, after two years, consent\ndecrees providing prospective relief with respect to prison\nconditions are “terminable upon the motion of any party or\nintervener,” unless “the court makes written findings based\non the record that prospective relief remains necessary to\ncorrect a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right”\nat issue. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(1), (3). If consent decrees are\npresumptively terminable after two years under the PLRA, it\nfollows that two years of supervising a decree is a sufficient\namount of time for a trial judge to acquire the expertise\nneeded to determine whether a decree’s purpose has been\nserved.\n\n    Of course, we don’t need Congress to tell us that two\nyears is a substantial amount of time. Common sense tells us\nso. Two years is the term of a member of the House of\nRepresentatives, for example. Indeed, we classify crimes\npunishable by two years imprisonment as felonies because\nthat is a substantial amount of time. The majority errs by\nrefusing to accord “substantial deference to ‘the trial judge’s\nyears of experience with the problem at hand.’” Rufo, 502\nU.S. at 394 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (quoting Hutto, 437\nU.S. at 688).\n\f                      ROUSER V.

The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n   vacating the Consent Decree.\n\n    Giving the district court the special deference it is owed,\nI cannot agree with the majority that the district court abused\nits discretion in vacating the Consent Decree. “A district\ncourt abuses its discretion if it does not apply the correct law\nor if it rests its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of\nmaterial fact.” Casey v.

Rouser has demonstrated neither of\nthese conditions.\n\n   1. The district court did not fail to observe any\n      procedure required for terminating consent\n      decrees. Rather, the majority creates a rule that is\n      inconsistent with our case law and the PLRA.\n\n    The majority first faults the district court for failing to\nobserve procedure that the majority rules courts must follow\nin deciding whether to vacate a consent decree. According to\nthe majority, a court faced with a motion to terminate a\nconsent decree must first determine whether the basic\npurposes of the decree have been met, and then must\ndetermine whether the party seeking release from the decree\nhas “substantially complied with every one of its provisions”\nfor a “substantial period.” Maj. Op. 10, 11–12, 13, 19.\n\n     The majority’s “substantial period of substantial\ncompliance with every term” invention is inconsistent with\nour case law and at odds with the PLRA. The majority\nattributes its rule to “the teachings of Otter.” Maj. Op. 9. But\nJeff D. v.

We also directed the\ndistrict court, on remand, to consider whether “the larger\npurposes of the decrees have been served,” rather than\nfocusing myopically on whether individual “Action Items”\nhad been completed. Id. at 288. This direction is consistent\nwith our other decisions, which emphasize that substantial\ncompliance does not mean that “every last wish and hope of\nthe decree [has been] achieved, but [that] the decree\naccomplished its essential purposes and the situation\nimproved greatly.” Labor/Cmty.

The majority’s rule requiring a\nsubstantial period of substantial compliance with every term\nviolates this precedent.\n\n    The majority’s rule, which effectively requires full rather\nthan substantial compliance, is particularly inappropriate in\ncases involving federal oversight of a state prison.

The majority’s rule is\nalso inconsistent with the PLRA, which we have recognized\nwas “intended . . . to revive the hands-off doctrine” regarding\nfederal judicial intervention in prisons.          Gilmore v.\nCalifornia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769703\"><a href=\"/opinion/769703/robert-o-gilmore-jr-and-inmates-of-san-quentin-state-prison-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 997 (9th Cir. 2000).

Nor is its\nrule obligating district courts to examine in detail past\ninstances of non-compliance that are not ongoing consistent\nwith applicable law in prison-reform cases. Rather, our\nprecedent and California law direct courts to consider\n“whether the larger purposes of [consent] decrees have been\nserved” in deciding whether their vacatur is justified due to\nsubstantial compliance. Otter, 643 F.3d at 287; see\nLabor/Cmty. Strategy Ctr., 564 F.3d at 1122 (“Our analysis\nrequires we do more than simply count the number of\ntechnical deviations from the decree.

The district court then found\nthat Defendants’ largely uncontested declarations and\nmemorandum regarding prison procedures demonstrated, by\na preponderance of evidence, that Defendants have\nsubstantially complied with the Decree. In so holding, the\ndistrict court did not violate any court-mandated procedure\nfor resolving motions to vacate consent decrees.\n\n    Nor did the district court err, as the majority alternatively\nholds, by finding substantial compliance without conducting\nan evidentiary hearing. The majority relies on Gilmore v.\nCalifornia, but that case only held that a district court must\n“take evidence on the current circumstances at the prison . . .\nwith respect to those remedies as to which plaintiffs did not\nconcede that defendants were in compliance.” 220 F.3d at\n1010. Here the district court took and considered evidence on\ncurrent circumstances presented by both parties and assumed\nRouser’s evidence as true. The district court did not, as the\nmajority incorrectly states, “simply examine the existing\nrecord.” Maj Op. 13–14 (quotation marks and alteration\nomitted). The majority fails to understand that the act of\ntaking evidence includes taking declarations and other new\nevidence, and is not limited to live hearings.\n\f                           ROUSER V. WHITE                                39\n\n    Neither our precedent nor the terms of the Consent\nDecree required more. See, e.g., Stewart v.

In fact, under the\nPLRA, neither evidentiary hearings nor written findings\nbased on the record are required where a federal court\ndetermines that the consent decree governing state prisons\nshould terminate. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3); Cagle, 177 F.3d at\n258 (“The plain language of § 3626(b)(3) imposes no\nrequirement that a district court conduct an evidentiary\nhearing in order to determine whether there is a current and\nongoing violation of federal rights.”).\n\n     2. The district court did not use an incorrect\n        standard for substantial compliance.\n\n    The majority also faults the district court for “applying\nthe wrong legal standard for substantial compliance.” Maj.\nOp. 11. The majority claims that the district court equated\nsubstantial compliance with “significant steps to follow the\nsettlement agreement.” Id. Rouser, who is now represented\nby a major law firm, did not make, and thus waived, this\nargument, which unfairly characterizes the district court’s\ndecision.4 Consistent with the Consent Decree’s termination\n\n 4\n   Without providing any supporting precedent, Rouser incorrectly faults\nthe district court for “fail[ing] to define substantial compliance.” The\ndistrict court was under no obligation to define substantial compliance.\nIn fact, the court had no need to clarify its meaning in light of the parties’\nagreement that California law governs the term. The parties agree that,\nunder California law, substantial compliance does not require “literal\ncompliance,” it requires that “the defects of performance must not pervade\nthe whole or be so essential as substantially to defeat the object which the\n\f40                     ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nprovision, the district court placed the evidentiary burden on\nDefendants, and found that they had “demonstrated by a\npreponderance of the evidence that they have substantially\ncomplied with the terms of the [Decree].” The reference to\n“significant steps to follow the settlement agreement” simply\nindicates that Defendants have diligently worked to achieve\ncompliance with the Decree, as detailed in their mostly\nuncontested filings. The district court concluded that\nDefendants’ evidence established that they “have\nsubstantially complied with the settlement agreement.”\n\n     3. The district court did not clearly err in finding\n        that a preponderance of the evidence showed\n        substantial compliance with the Consent Decree.\n\n     The majority also holds that the district court’s substantial\ncompliance determination is based on a clearly erroneous\nfactual finding. Under the abuse of discretion standard, “if\nthe district court’s findings are plausible in light of the record\nviewed in its entirety, the appellate court cannot reverse even\nif it is convinced it would have found differently.” Husain,\n316 F.3d at 835. Again, this standard is even more\ndeferential where, as here, we review a district court’s\ndetermination that a consent decree aimed at institutional\nreform has served its purpose. Labor/Cmty.

The Wilcox declaration explained that (1)\nRouser had been provided access to the personal and religious\ngroup items listed in the Decree; (2) Wiccan group services\nwere scheduled and held on a weekly basis with the\nassistance of a volunteer Wiccan minister, subject to\ninstitutional safety and security considerations; (3) a fire pit\nand outdoor religious worship area had been constructed for\nWiccan inmates’ use; and (4) Wiccan inmates used the\noutdoor religious area for the “Samhain sabbat on October 31,\n2012 and the Yule sabbat on December 23, 2012.” The\nreferenced prison procedures, among other things, (1) provide\nthat Wiccan “services shall be announced in the same manner\nand to the same extent as announced for religious events of\nother religious groups”; (2) explain that the group religious\nitems listed in the Consent Decree “are to be secured in the\nFacility Chapel”; and (3) establish rules for use of the outdoor\nreligious area.\n\n    In response to Defendants’ proffer of compliance with the\nDecree, Rouser alleged two relevant instances of non-\ncompliance.5 He alleged that prison officials had (1) only\nallowed him, in the absence of the volunteer chaplain, to use\none candle, instead of seven, for the Yule 2012 Sabbat; and\n\n 5\n    Like his earlier motion to enforce, Rouser’s opposition to the motion\nto vacate focused in large part on his placement in administrative\nsegregation due to enemy concerns related to other inmates. As the\ndistrict court implicitly acknowledged in its earlier order on Rouser’s\nmotion to enforce, these allegations are “unclear” and “unrelated” to the\nConsent Decree. The majority appears to agree and does not address these\nallegations.\n\f42                   ROUSER V. WHITE\n\n(2) only allowed him, in the absence of the volunteer\nchaplain, to complete one ritual at the outdoor religious\nground since it was completed a few months earlier. The\ndistrict court determined that, even accepting these\nallegations that Defendants “have not complied with the\n[Decree] in a handful of instances” as true, they do not refute\nDefendants’ showing of substantial compliance.\n\n    The record does not show that this finding was clearly\nerroneous. Rouser did not contest most of Defendants’ sworn\ndeclaration stating that Defendants had fully complied with\nthe Decree. Accordingly, the district court could take as true\nthat Defendants complied with the Consent Decree except as\nto those provisions disputed by Rouser. The majority\nincorrectly treats all provisions in the Consent Decree not\nspecifically addressed by Defendants as having been\ninsufficiently evidenced. However, Defendants were not\nrequired to list out and address every line of the Consent\nDecree separately, and the majority errs by faulting the\ndistrict court for not holding Defendants to such a\nrequirement. A district court need not take evidence\nregarding provisions of a consent decree governing a state\nprison with which a plaintiff concedes defendants have\ncomplied. See Gilmore, 220 F.3d at 1010; 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(b)(3).\n\n     There is therefore no dispute that, for example: volunteer\nWiccan ministers now may attend and lead Wiccan services;\nweekly Esbats are now permitted; weekly Wiccan study\ngroups are now permitted; an outdoor religious area and fire\npit have been constructed for Wiccan inmates, which inmates\nhad already used during Sabbats; Wiccan services now are\nposted and announced in the same manner as other religious\nevents; Wiccan inmates are permitted to order food for\n\f                          ROUSER V. WHITE                              43\n\nSabbats and bring food to weekly Esbats and study groups;\nRouser has been allowed to order and possess all of the\npersonal religious items listed in the Decree; and Rouser may\napply and be considered for an inmate work assignment as a\nclerk to the facility chaplain.\n\n    Additionally, it is apparent that there is no dispute that\nRouser has been permitted to order and access the full list of\ngroup religious items. The single exception, according to\nRouser, was that, during one Sabbat, he was only allowed\naccess to one candle instead of seven in the absence of the\nvolunteer chaplain.6 While the Decree permits Rouser to use\nseven candles for group religious services, subject to\n“institutional safety and security concerns,” the alleged non-\ncompliance with this provision for a single service does not\nundermine Defendants’ showing of substantial compliance.\nIndeed, Rouser has not alleged that he was denied access to\nany group religious item for any weekly Esbat or any other\nSabbat.7\n\n\n  6\n    In one part of his opposition, Rouser alleges more generally that he\nwas not permitted to order candles, incense, or associated holders. This\nallegation, however, is contradicted by Rouser’s subsequent allegation that\nhe was denied access to more than one candle (with no mention of\nincense) and only during the 2012 Yule Sabbat. Indeed, Rouser does not\ndispute that he was permitted to use candles and incense during other\nSabbats and weekly Esbats. It follows that he has been permitted to order\ncandles, incense, and associated holders.\n  7\n    It is notable that the only items that have been of concern are those\ninvolving open flames, which raise obvious prison-safety concerns.\nIndeed, in responding to Rouser’s same claim in his motion to enforce\nregarding candles and incense, Defendants explained that Rouser was not\ndenied access to either candles or incense, but acknowledged “some\nmiscommunication concerning [his] access and use of an open flame\nduring services” stemming from security concerns, which had been\n\f44                        ROUSER V. WHITE\n\n    Rouser’s other allegation of non-compliance—that he was\nonly allowed to complete one ritual at the outdoor religious\nground since it was completed a few months earlier—does\nnot undermine Defendants’ showing of substantial\ncompliance either. There were three Sabbats since the\nbeginning of October—the Samhain Sabbat on October 31,\nthe Yule Sabbat on December 23, and the Imbolg Sabbat on\nFebruary 2. Before the Imbolg Sabbat had come to pass,\nDefendants declared under penalty of perjury that inmates\nused the outdoor religious area for the Samhain Sabbat and\nthe Yule Sabbat. Thus, it appears that Rouser’s concern is\neither with the Imbolg Sabbat or that, while Rouser accessed\nthe outdoor religious area during the Yule Sabbat, he could\nnot appropriately observe the event because he was denied\naccess to the requisite number of candles. Regardless, Rouser\nacknowledged that he was unable to use the outdoor religious\narea because the Wiccan volunteer chaplain was not available\nto supervise the event.\n\n    Even accepting Rouser’s allegation as true, the fact that\nhe could not use the outdoor religious area due to the absence\nof the volunteer chaplain during one Sabbat does not\nnecessarily demonstrate even an isolated violation of the\nConsent Decree. The Decree acknowledges that, in providing\nRouser “reasonable opportunities to participate in Wiccan\ngroup religious services,” prison officials must “tak[e] into\naccount factors such as the number of inmates, available\n\n\nresolved. Prison officials should, consistent with safety and administrative\nconsiderations, respect a Wiccan inmate’s interest in using candles for\nWiccan services to the same extent that inmates of other religions are\npermitted to use candles for their services. It is likely unreasonable,\nhowever, to expect prison officials to be able to supervise the use of\ncandles by Rouser and all other inmates every week of the year and on\nevery Sabbat.\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        45\n\nspace, safety and security, resources, and administrative\nconsiderations, so long as those factors are also considered in\ndetermining the access of other religious groups to regularly\nscheduled group religious activities.” Moreover, Defendants’\nprison procedures memorandum governing the use of the\noutdoor religious area makes clear that a volunteer or other\nstaff must be available to escort inmates to the event.\n\n    Indicative of its commitment to riddle the district court’s\nexercise of discretion with as many holes as possible,\nregardless of their merit, the majority goes beyond the\nallegations of non-compliance made by Rouser in his\nopposition to the motion to vacate. First, the majority faults\nthe district court and Defendants for not addressing a\nprovision of the Consent Decree that does not exist. The\nmajority says that Defendants should have addressed\nRouser’s “right to be released from confinement in time to\nattend full Wiccan services.” Maj. Op. 12. The Decree\ncontains no such provision. In fact, the Decree allows prison\nofficials to suspend its provisions “when Rouser is confined\nin Administrative Segregation.”\n\n    Second, the majority faults Defendants for not addressing\nissues that they addressed. For example, the majority faults\nDefendants for not explaining whether they had made “copies\nof a master schedule of religious services that included the\ntime and location of Wiccan events.” However, Rouser\nhimself acknowledged in a joint status report that Defendants\nhad included Wiccan events in the master schedule for\nreligious services and study groups, as required. Moreover,\nthe prison procedures memorandum states that “services shall\nbe announced in the same manner and the same extent as\n\f46                        ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nannounced for religious events of other religious groups.8 As\nwith the vast majority of other provisions in the Consent\nDecree, there is simply no dispute that Defendants have\ncomplied with this requirement.\n\n    Third, the majority faults the district court for not\nmentioning past instances of non-compliance with the\nDecree. As explained above, past instances of non-\ncompliance are of questionable relevance in deciding whether\nto vacate a consent decree entered under the PLRA, which\nrequires an “ongoing violation of the Federal right” for relief\nto be continued after two years. See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3);\nHallett, 296 F.3d at 743. In any case, the majority wrongly\nconcludes that the district court’s decision on the motion to\nenforce undermines the same court’s decision on the motion\nto vacate. The district court did not find that prison officials\nhad damaged Rouser’s necklace. Instead, it ordered prison\nofficials to adhere to the terms of the Consent Decree “[t]o\nthe extent religious items are under [their] control.” Indeed,\n\n\n  8\n    The majority’s dismissal of evidence such as the prison procedures\nmemorandum and the joint status report as “stale” illustrates how far the\nmajority oversteps its role as a reviewing court. This evidence was not\nstale—the prison procedures memorandum was less than five months old\nand the joint status report was a year old when the district court vacated\nthe Decree. Combined with Defendants’ declarations, this evidence\nconfirmed, as Rouser did not dispute in opposition to the motion to vacate,\nthat all or nearly all of the Decree’s provisions had been achieved.\nMoreover, the majority does not appreciate the difference between past,\nnow-corrected instances of non-compliance and past acts achieving\ncompliance. While corrected instances of non-compliance are of\nquestionable relevance under the PLRA, which requires an “ongoing\nviolation of the Federal right” for relief to be continued, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(b)(3), a district court obviously may look into the past in assessing\nwhether a decree’s objectives, such as commitments to construct fire pit\nand allow access to spiritual leaders, have been accomplished.\n\f                      ROUSER V. WHITE                         47\n\na “religious necklace” is not a listed item in the Consent\nDecree. To the extent that the necklace in question is the\nmedallion or pentagram, it is listed as a personal religious\nitem, which the Decree states that Rouser possesses.\n\n    The only uncontested violation of the Decree alleged in\nthe motion to enforce was Defendants’ failure to provide\nRouser with expedited inmate appeals on a few occasions.\nHowever, this procedural failure did not undermine the\npurpose of the Decree. The Decree’s purpose is to provide\nRouser with access to religious items, services, spiritual\nleadership, and facilities that are important to Wicca, not to\nprovide Rouser with expedited inmate appeals. The majority\nfails to appreciate the difference between a procedural\nmechanism and a “larger purpose” of a decree. See Otter,\n643 F.3d at 287; see also Labor/Cmty. Strategy Ctr., 564 F.3d\nat 1123.\n\n    On the record presented, the district court did not clearly\nerr in finding that Rouser’s allegations that Defendants had\nfailed to comply with the Decree in a “handful of instances”\ndid not undermine Defendants’ showing of substantial\ncompliance. The alleged “defects of performance [do] not\npervade the whole.” Connell, 170 Cal. at 556. Nor are they\n“so essential as substantially to defeat the object which the\nparties intend to accomplish.” Id. Instead, “the larger\npurposes of [the Consent Decree has] been served,” Otter,\n643 F.3d at 287, “and the situation improved greatly.”\nLabor/Cmty. Strategy Ctr., 564 F.3d at 1123. Like inmates of\nother religions, Rouser now has access, consistent with prison\nsecurity and administrative considerations, to religious items,\nservices, spiritual leadership, and facilities that are important\nto his faith. It certainly cannot be said that extending the\n\f48                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nDecree is necessary to correct an ongoing violation of\nRouser’s rights under federal law.\n\n     4. Rouser has not been deprived of due process, as he\n        concedes.\n\n    The final reason the majority gives for reversal is that the\ndistrict court violated Rouser’s due process rights by sending\nseveral orders to Rouser’s former counsel instead of Rouser.\nThis argument was not raised by Rouser on appeal and was\ntherefore abandoned. Wilcox v. Comm’r, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507193\"><a href=\"/opinion/507193/robert-p-wilcox-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1008 n.2 (9th Cir. 1988). Indeed, it is the majority that\ndemonstrates “insouciance” by jumping to name-calling\nwithout having heard from the parties about due process\nconcerns.\n\n    As an initial matter, the majority inappropriately pins all\nof the blame for the misdeliveries on the district court.\nRouser’s previous attorney moved to withdraw as counsel in\n2006, citing irreconcilable differences, including Rouser’s\npropensity to pepper the court with unauthorized filings.\nAfter a hearing, the district court granted the motion to\nwithdraw subject to submission of “an order for the court’s\nsignature.” The district court subsequently reminded the\nparties that “[t]he court indicated its intent to grant this\nmotion and directed plaintiff’s counsel to file a proposed\norder.” Neither Rouser nor his former counsel ever filed the\nrequisite order and thus none was entered. Accordingly, the\nmajority faults the district court for sending court orders to a\ncounsel whose motion to withdraw was never granted and\nwho thus continued to be listed as Rouser’s counsel.\n\n   Moreover, Rouser was represented by attorneys at a major\nlaw firm from April 21, 2007, until March 28, 2012. During\n\f                      ROUSER V. WHITE                        49\n\nthis time, and certainly before withdrawing, Rouser’s counsel\ncould have notified the court that the docket should not list\nRouser’s previous attorney as a counsel of record. Even if the\nformer counsel’s ongoing listing as a counsel of record was\nnot apparent then, Rouser should have notified the district\ncourt of any problem earlier once it became apparent. The\nmajority states that Rouser clearly did so in October 2012.\nHowever, the filing that the majority references only requests\nthat “the court send him the ruling of the hearing of 10/5/12\nfor plaintiff is pro per and the only way he has been finding\nout about the hearing dates is from the response filing of\ndefendants.” The import of this single sentence of a stream-\nof-consciousness letter focused on unrelated issues, if clearer\nnow in hindsight, was undoubtedly less than obvious back\nthen. Rouser did not clearly notify the district court of the\ndelivery problem until April 24, 2013. Thereafter, on June 7,\n2013, the district court entered an order acknowledging that\nRouser had been proceeding pro se and directing the clerk to\nsend Rouser the order vacating the Consent Decree that\nRouser requested.\n\n    Even if the district court’s failure to send documents to\nRouser is partially attributed to the court and somehow\nconstituted an error of constitutional magnitude, the district\ncourt correctly concluded that Rouser suffered no prejudice.\nRouser received Defendants’ motion to vacate, learned of the\ncourt’s earlier order on his motion to enforce, and timely filed\nan opposition to the motion to vacate. Rouser has not alleged\nany prejudice.\n\n    The majority nonetheless contends that “Rouser’s failure\nto receive the court’s orders prejudiced his ability to allege\nviolations of the 2011 Decree.” Maj. Op. 15. The majority\nreasons that the docket error left Rouser in the dark about the\n\f50                        ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nrequirements that must be met before submitting notices of\nviolations of the Decree, which the majority says were set\nforth in the district court’s November 14, 2012 order denying\nRouser’s motion to enforce. The majority’s argument fails\nfor several reasons. First, it is not clear that Rouser did not\nactually obtain the November 14, 2012 order. Second, the\norder did not create any new filing requirements, it only\nreferenced the Consent Decree’s exhaustion provision. As\nthe district court noted, the Consent Decree requires that\n“allegations that Defendants violated the Decree must follow\nthe administrative procedures outlined in the Decree before\nbeing brought to this Court.” Rouser was well aware of these\nrequirements, having agreed to the Consent Decree, and thus\nsuffered no prejudice even if he did not obtain the order.\n\n    Third, the subsequent allegations made by Rouser do not\ndemonstrate that the district court erred in vacating the\nConsent Decree.9 Rouser’s allegation that he was denied the\nWitches’ Bible while in administrative segregation may be\nconcerning, but Rouser did not repeat this allegation in\nopposing the motion to vacate. Moreover, the Consent\nDecree only requires prison officials to permit Rouser access\nto the Witches’ Bible to the extent that prisoners of other\nreligious faiths are allowed to have a religious text while in\nadministrative segregation. Rouser has never alleged that\nother prisoners are allowed such texts. Nor did Rouser repeat\n\n  9\n    The majority’s lists of filings that the district court failed to address\nand orders that Rouser didn’t receive are inaccurate. The district court\naddressed Rouser’s March 13, 2013 oral argument request, which the\nmajority describes as alleging a violation of the expedited appeal\nprovision, in a March 18, 2013 Order. Appendix A incorrectly lists\nRouser as not having received the Court’s March 15, 2012 Order.\nHowever, Rouser was represented by counsel at the time that Order was\nfiled, and his counsel received the Order.\n\f                     ROUSER V. WHITE                        51\n\nhis unclear allegation regarding applying for a volunteer\nchapel clerk position. In any case, this provision does not\nguarantee that Rouser will be selected for the chaplain clerk\nposition, but only allows him “to apply and be considered for\nsuch an assignment.” In a joint status report, Rouser had\npreviously acknowledged that Defendants had determined\nthat there currently was not a chaplain clerk position open for\napplication by Rouser or any other inmate.\n\n   Thus, even if Rouser had made a due process argument,\nand even if the district court had made a due process error,\nRouser suffered no prejudice.\n\n                             III.\n\n    The district courts’s finding of substantial compliance\nwas not clearly erroneous or based on an incorrect legal\nstandard. The majority, however, imposes a standard for\nterminating consent decrees that is inconsistent with our\nprecedent and federal courts’ limited role in overseeing\nreform of state prisons. The majority also overreaches our\nrole as an appellate court by refusing to provide the district\ncourt the special deference that it is due in this case and\noffhandedly dismissing evidence that the trial court found\ncompelling.\n\n    The record shows that the basic purpose of the Consent\nDecree has been achieved. Prison officials now permit\nRouser, like inmates of other faiths, to practice his religion\nwhile incarcerated, consistent with security and\nadministrative considerations. Rouser has reasonable access\nto the religious items, services, spiritual leadership, and\nfacilities that are important to his faith. Prison officials\nprovide Wiccan events with resources comparable to those\n\f52                    ROUSER V. WHITE\n\nprovided for events of other religions, such as publicity, food,\nand staffing. While strictly observing any faith, particularly\none involving many rituals, is undoubtedly difficult for an\ninmate, whose rights are not coextensive with those of the\ngeneral public, Rouser’s ability to observe Wicca is greatly\nimproved. It is time for this twenty-three-year-old case to be\ndismissed. Accordingly, I dissent.\n\f</pre>",
