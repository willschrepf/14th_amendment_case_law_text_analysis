Howell\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND\nSECURITY, et al.,\n\n                          Defendants.\n\n\n                                       MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        The plaintiff, Denise Gilman, brings this case under the Freedom of Information Act\n\n(“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552, seeking release of certain U.S. Customs and Border Protection\n\n(“CBP”) records concerning the construction of a fence on the Texas-Mexico border. Pending\n\nbefore the Court are the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment regarding CBP’s\n\nproduction of email records in response to the plaintiff’s FOIA request, which response withheld\n\nlandowner names and addresses, under FOIA Exemption 6, and information related to CBP’s\n\nassessments of the need for fencing, under FOIA Exemption 7(E), and excluded email\n\nattachments from the records produced to the plaintiff.1 For the reasons explained below, CBP’s\n\nmotion is granted in part, with respect to portions of records withheld pursuant to FOIA\n\nExemption 7(E) and the exclusion of email attachments from production to the plaintiff, and\n\ndenied in part, as to its redaction of landowner names and addresses pursuant to FOIA\n\n1\n  The plaintiff has also named as defendants the Army Corps of Engineers (“ACE”) and the Department of\nHomeland Security (“DHS”), but has settled her claims with defendant ACE, which was dismissed as a party. See\nStip. Settlement Order Dismissal of ACE, ECF No. 24; see also Def.’s Mem. Supp. Def. CBP’s Mot. Summ. J.\nEmail Recs. (“Def.’s Mem.”) at 3. Although both DHS and CBP remain parties to the action, after DHS referred the\nrequest to CBP, see July 23, 2009, Joint Status Report (“7/23/09 JSR”) at 3, the parties agree that DHS is only\n“nominally a defendant . . . [but] has no further involvement in this action.” Def.’s Mem. at 3; Pl.’s Mem. Opp’n\nDef.’s Mot. Summ. J. Email Recs. Supp. Pl.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) at 4, ECF No. 35. Consequently, “only CBP\nrecords remain at issue.” Pl.’s Mem.\n\n                                                       1\n\fExemption 6, and the plaintiff’s motion is granted in part with respect to the redaction of\n\nlandowner names and addresses under FOIA Exemption 6 and is otherwise denied.2\n\nI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         A.       The Texas-Mexico Border Fence\n\n         In 2006, Congress passed the Secure Fence Act, ordering “construction of a fence or wall\n\nalong specific portions of the U.S.-Mexico border, including areas in Texas.” See Complaint\n\n(“Compl.”) ¶ 5, ECF No. 1 (citing Secure Fence Act, Pub. L. No. 109-367, § 3, 120 Stat. 2638\n\n(2006)). The Act was later amended to mandate “reinforced fencing along not less than 700\n\nmiles of the southwest border” and charged the Secretary of Homeland Security with completing\n\n370 miles of the reinforced fencing by the end of 2008. Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY\n\n2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, § 564, 121 Stat. 1844, 2090–91 (2007). The precise location of the\n\nfence, however, was left to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to determine\n\n“where fencing would be most practical and effective,” provided that DHS consult with, inter\n\nalia, “states, local governments, Indian tribes, and property owners . . . to minimize the impact”\n\non those living near the site of the future fence. Id.\n\n         B.       FOIA Requests\n\n         The plaintiff is a clinical professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Decl.\n\nDenise Gilman (“Gilman Decl.”) ¶ 1, ECF No. 35-1. In late 2007, the plaintiff spearheaded a\n\nworking group that focused on the human rights impact of the border fence by “conduct[ing]\n\nresearch and analysis of the legal, historical, property, environmental, indigenous, community,\n\nand other impacts of the border wall.” Id. ¶ 4–5. As part of that effort, the plaintiff submitted\n\nseveral FOIA requests to the CBP, DHS, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“ACE”). See\n\n2\n As of November 12, 2013, defendant CBP had completed production of all email and non-email records that it\nbelieved were responsive to the plaintiff’s request, and no challenge has been raised to the agency’s search. See\nNov. 12, 2013 Joint Status Report at 1–2, ECF No. 48; Def.’s Mem. at 1.\n\n                                                          2\n\fDef.’s Mem. Supp. Def. CBP’s Mot. Summ. J. Email Recs. (“Def.’s Mem.”) at 3, ECF No. 32.\n\nThe plaintiff’s request to CBP asked for: (1) “Maps of possible locations for segments of fence\n\nor wall along the Texas/Mexico border;” (2) “files including geographic coordinates . . . for\n\nsurveyed points along potential routes for segments of fence or wall along the Texas/Mexico\n\nborder;” (3) “Documents identifying the properties possibly affected by the construction of the\n\nborder fence or wall along the Texas/Mexico border, including documents that provide\n\ninformation regarding the ownership of the possibly affected properties and any other\n\ninformation about the characteristics of those properties;” (4) “Documents identifying the\n\nproperties for which the United States government has sought to obtain access through\n\nconsent/waiver or through litigation;” (5) “Documents reflecting appraisals of properties possibly\n\naffected by the construction of the border fence or wall along the Texas/Mexico border;” (6)\n\n“Documents reflecting surveys or other analyses of the areas possibly affected by the border\n\nfence or wall along the Texas/Mexico border;” (7) “Documents that describe the considerations\n\nor factors taken into account in making decisions regarding potential routes for segments of\n\nfence or wall along the Texas/Mexico border;” (8) “Communications received from, provided to\n\nor referenced by the Department of Homeland Security that make recommendations or\n\nsuggestions regarding the route for segments of fence or wall along the . . . Texas/Mexico\n\nBorder;” and (9) “Documents relating to potential or actual contracts for the execution of land\n\nsurveys or construction of segments of fence or wall along the Texas/Mexico border.” Gilman\n\nDecl. Ex. 2 at 18–19 (Plaintiff’s FOIA request to CBP dated April 11, 2008). Near-identical\n\nrequests were also sent to DHS and ACE. See Compl. ¶ 6.\n\n       DHS informed the plaintiff by letter that it referred her request to CBP “as the component\n\nof DHS likely to possess the records requested.” See July 23, 2009, Joint Status Report\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f(“7/23/09 JSR”) at 3, ECF No. 6. Before the plaintiff filed suit, she received from CBP two\n\nrecords, from ACE, 69 pages of records, and from DHS, no records. See Gilman Decl. ¶ 10;\n\nPl.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) at 4, ECF No. 35.\n\n       C.      FOIA LITIGATION\n\n       The plaintiff filed the instant action to compel the disclosure of responsive records, but\n\nsubsequently agreed with CBP to bifurcate the email production and non-email production of\n\nrecords. See 7/23/09 JSR at 2–3; see also July 27, 2009 Scheduling Order (“7/27/09 Sched.\n\nOrder”) ¶¶ 1–3, ECF No. 7. The parties submitted a joint status report informing the Court that\n\n“in the interest of expediting the release of e-mails to Plaintiff,” CBP could “satisfy Plaintiff’s\n\nFOIA request with respect to the processing of e-mails by providing to Plaintiff the e-mails as\n\nreleased in Crew v. DHS pursuant to the search described in the Joint Status Report and Proposed\n\nDisclosure Schedule . . . in that case.” See 7/23/09 JSR at 3 (citing Citizens for Responsibility &\n\nEthics in Wash. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. (“CREW”), No. 08-1046 (D.D.C. filed June 18,\n\n2008)). The parties further explained that CREW involved a search for emails “of the 25 CBP\n\nofficials most directly involved in the border fence placement division” and was scheduled to\n\nproduce “1,000 pages of e-mails per month” until there were no remaining responsive records.\n\nId. at 2–3. This was a “broader” search for records than that which the plaintiff had requested\n\nbecause the plaintiff in CREW sought records “for the entire Southwest border of the United\n\nStates instead of just the Texas-Mexico border.” Def.’s Mem. at 4–5. CBP was already\n\nprocessing email records in CREW, id. at 4, and the arrangement meant CBP “would not have to\n\nexpend its limited resources to search for, retrieve and process email records in response to\n\nPlaintiff’s FOIA request,” id. at 5, and “allowed Plaintiff to receive email records more\n\nexpeditiously than she otherwise would,” id. at 4. CBP agreed to release to the plaintiff “all e-\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fmails already released in CREW v. DHS” and to continue to provide the plaintiff with “further e-\n\nmails as they are released on a rolling basis in that case.” 7/23/09 JSR at 3. The Court\n\nsubsequently entered an order stating that “CBP will release to Plaintiff all email records already\n\nreleased in [CREW], and, going forward, CBP will release to Plaintiff on a rolling basis all e-\n\nmail records released in [CREW], on the same schedule as they are released in that case.”\n\n7/27/09 Sched. Order ¶ 2.\n\n       Two years after the plaintiff filed suit, CBP “completed or was near completion” of its\n\nproduction of records in both the CREW litigation and the instant case. Gilman Decl. ¶ 12. CBP\n\nwas ordered to produce any remaining responsive email records to the plaintiff within a month,\n\nsee March 28, 2011 Order, ECF No. 27, and the plaintiff was ordered to raise any disputes with\n\nthe claimed exemptions within 60 days. Id.; see also June 27, 2011 Joint Status Report\n\n(“6/27/2011 JSR”), ECF No. 28. In total, CBP “made 15 productions of email records . . .\n\nrepresenting all emails produced in the CREW v. DHS case.” Id. at 2 n.1. The plaintiff\n\n“identified for CBP the 289 emails with redactions and/or withholdings she is challenging,” Pl.’s\n\nMot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) at 5, and CBP agreed to conduct a further review of the\n\nchallenged records, 6/27/11 JSR at 3. The parties were aware when the 6/27/11 JSR was filed\n\nthat the plaintiff challenged “the fact that attachments were not part of the email production.” Id.\n\nCBP explained that it would satisfy its obligation to the plaintiff by releasing to her emails which\n\nwere identical to those released in CREW, “and, therefore, to the extent attachments were not\n\nincluded in the email release made in CREW v. DHS, they were not provided to Plaintiff.” Id.\n\nThis was contrary to the plaintiff’s understanding that, to the extent the CBP withheld portions of\n\nemails, the plaintiff would still be able to challenge those redactions. Id. In the plaintiff’s view,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fCBP’s non-production of attachments to responsive emails was a withholding without any\n\napplicable exemption that must therefore be disclosed. Id.\n\n       The plaintiff has substantially narrowed her challenges to CBP’s production of\n\nresponsive records. See Pl.’s Reply Def.’s Opp. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. Re. Email Discl. (“Pl.’s\n\nReply”) at 1, ECF No. 42. The plaintiff has expressly stated that she no longer challenges (1)\n\n“CBP’s redaction of emails under Exemption 5,” Pl.’s Reply at 1; (2) the “Exemption 7(E)\n\nredactions on” Record 24 listed in the Vaughn index, id.; (3) the “withholding of the phone\n\nnumbers or email addresses of landowners” or the withholding of names and contact information\n\nof “CBP employees or of individual employees of contractors,” Pl.’s Mem. at 5; and (4) the\n\nwithholding of email attachments beyond those attached to the “289 emails at issue in these\n\ncross-motions,” id. at 25. Due to the plaintiff’s decision not to challenge these withholdings,\n\nsummary judgment is granted to CBP as to those issues. The reasons for the plaintiff’s\n\nremaining challenges are discussed below.\n\nII.    LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       Congress enacted the FOIA to promote transparency across the government. See 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552; Stern v. FBI, 737 F.2d 84, 88 (D.C. Cir. 1984). The Supreme Court has explained\n\nthat the FOIA is “a means for citizens to know ‘what their Government is up to.’ This phrase\n\nshould not be dismissed as a convenient formalism. It defines a structural necessity in a real\n\ndemocracy.” Nat’l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 171–72 (2004) (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted). “The basic purpose of FOIA is to ensure an informed\n\ncitizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society, needed to check against corruption and\n\nto hold the governors accountable to the governed.” NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437\n\nU.S. 214, 242 (1978); see also SEC v. Am. Int’l Grp., 712 F.3d 1, 3 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“The\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fpublic has a fundamental interest in ‘keeping a watchful eye on the workings of public\n\nagencies.’” (quoting Wash. Legal Found. v. U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, 89 F.3d 897, 905 (D.C.\n\nCir.1996))). As a result, the FOIA requires federal agencies to release all nonexempt records\n\nresponsive to a request. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A).\n\n       To protect “legitimate governmental and private interests [that] could be harmed by\n\nrelease of certain types of information,” United Techs. Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 601 F.3d 557,\n\n559 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted), Congress included nine exemptions\n\npermitting agencies to withhold information from FOIA disclosure. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).\n\n“These exemptions are explicitly made exclusive, and must be narrowly construed.” Milner v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of the Navy, 131 S.Ct. 1259, 1262 (2011) (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Office of Mgmt. & Budget, 598 F.3d 865, 869 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2010) (“FOIA allows agencies to withhold only those documents that fall under one of nine\n\nspecific exemptions, which are construed narrowly in keeping with FOIA’s presumption in favor\n\nof disclosure.”) (citations omitted). Upon exhaustion of administrative remedies, a FOIA\n\nrequester may file a civil action challenging an agency’s response to its request. See 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(a)(4)(B); Wilbur v. CIA, 355 F.3d 675, 677 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Once such an action is filed,\n\nthe agency generally has the burden of demonstrating that its response to the plaintiff's FOIA\n\nrequest was appropriate. See id. at 678. Federal courts are authorized under the FOIA “to enjoin\n\nthe agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records\n\nimproperly withheld from the complainant.” Id. § 552(a)(4)(B).\n\n       It is typically appropriate to resolve FOIA cases on summary judgment. See Brayton v.\n\nOffice of the U.S. Trade Rep., 641 F.3d 521, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“the vast majority of FOIA\n\ncases can be resolved on summary judgment”). When an agency’s response to a FOIA request is\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fto withhold responsive records, either in whole or in part, the agency “bears the burden of\n\nproving the applicability of claimed exemptions.” Am. Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nDef. (“ACLU/DOD ”), 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The agency may sustain its burden\n\nof establishing that requested records were appropriately withheld through the submission of\n\ndeclarations detailing the reason that a FOIA exemption applies, along with an index, as\n\nnecessary, describing the materials withheld. See, e.g., id. at 619; Students Against Genocide v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of State, 257 F.3d 828, 840 (D.C. Cir. 2001); Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 827–28\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1973). “If an agency’s affidavit describes the justifications for withholding the\n\ninformation with specific detail, demonstrates that the information withheld logically falls within\n\nthe claimed exemption, and is not contradicted by contrary evidence in the record or by evidence\n\nof the agency’s bad faith, then summary judgment is warranted on the basis of the affidavit\n\nalone.” ACLU/DOD, 628 F.3d at 619. As the D.C. Circuit recently explained, in FOIA cases\n\n“‘[s]ummary judgment may be granted on the basis of agency affidavits if they contain\n\nreasonable specificity of detail rather than merely conclusory statements, and if they are not\n\ncalled into question by contradictory evidence in the record or by evidence of agency bad faith.’”\n\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Secret Serv., 726 F.3d 208, 215 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting Consumer\n\nFed’n of Am. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 455 F.3d 283, 287 (D.C. Cir. 2006) and Gallant v. NLRB,\n\n26 F.3d 168, 171 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). While the burden remains on the moving party to\n\ndemonstrate that there is an “absence of a genuine issue of material fact” in dispute, Celotex\n\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986), in FOIA cases, “an agency’s justification for\n\ninvoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient if it appears ‘logical’ or ‘plausible.’” ACLU/DOD, 628\n\nF.3d at 619 (quoting Larson v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 862 (D.C. Cir. 2009)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fIII.     DISCUSSION\n\n         The plaintiff contends that CBP: (1) improperly redacted “the names and addresses of\n\nlandowners who would potentially be affected by the border wall,” under FOIA Exemption 6; (2)\n\nimproperly redacted “records containing an assessment of the need for fencing in certain areas,”\n\nunder FOIA Exemption 7(E); and (3) improperly withheld email attachments pursuant to no\n\nspecific FOIA exemption. Pl.’s Reply at 1. The plaintiff’s challenges are addressed seriatim\n\nbelow.\n\n         A.      FOIA Exemption 6\n\n         The plaintiff challenges CBP’s withholding, under Exemption 6, of the names and\n\naddresses of private citizen landowners that are referenced in emails to and from CBP\n\nemployees.3 Exemption 6 protects “personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure\n\nof which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(b)(6). “The information in the file ‘need not be intimate’ for the file to satisfy the standard,\n\nand the threshold for determining whether information applies to a particular individual is\n\nminimal.” Milton v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 783 F. Supp. 2d 55, 58 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting N.Y.\n\nTimes Co. v. Nat’l Aeronautics & Space Admin., 920 F.2d 1002, 1006 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (en\n\nbanc)). Once this threshold determination is met, the Court next inquires whether disclosure\n\n“would compromise a substantial, as opposed to de minimis, privacy interest,” because FOIA\n\ndemands disclosure “[i]f no significant privacy interest is implicated.” See Multi Ag Media LLC\n\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 515 F.3d 1224, 1229 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Nat’l Ass’n of Retired Fed.\n\nEmps. v. Horner (“Horner”), 879 F.2d 873, 874 (D.C. Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1078\n\n(1990)). The standard “means less than it might seem,” as a substantial privacy interest is\n\n3\n  At issue is the withholding of names and addresses of private citizen landowners, not commercial landowners,\nindividuals who were points of contact for commercial entities, or employees of the CBP. See Supplemental Decl.\nof David E. Wade (“Suppl. Wade Decl.”) ¶ 15 & n.1.\n\n                                                       9\n\f“anything greater than a de minimis privacy interest.” Id. at 1229–30. If there is a substantial\n\nprivacy interest in the information, the Court employs a balancing test to determine whether\n\nrelease of such information constitutes a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\n\nWash. Post Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1982);\n\nU.S. Dep’t of the Air Force v.

Cir. 2007) (quoting\n\nWash. Post Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 690 F.2d at 261).\n\n       As a threshold matter, the Court must determine whether the withheld information\n\nconstitutes “similar files” to “personnel and medical files” that are subject to exemption 6. 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(6). “The terms [sic] ‘similar files’ is construed broadly and ‘is intended to cover\n\ndetailed Government records on an individual which can be identified as applying to that\n\nindividual.’” Gov’t Accountability Project, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 105–06 (quoting U.S. Dep’t of\n\nState v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 602 (1982)). Courts look to the “nature of the\n\ninformation at issue,” not necessarily “the nature of the files.” See Skybridge Spectrum Found. v.\n\nFCC, 842 F. Supp. 2d 65, 83 (D.D.C. 2012) (quoting N.Y. Times Co. v. Nat’l Aeronautics &\n\nSpace Admin., 920 F.2d at 1006 (quotation marks omitted)); see also Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\n\nFDA, 449 F.3d 141, 152–53 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“similar files” encompasses “not just files, but\n\nalso bits of personal information, such as names and addresses, the release of which would\n\n‘create[] a palpable threat to privacy.’”) (quoting Carter v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 830 F.2d\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f388, 391 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). The plaintiff does not dispute that the requested information is a\n\n“similar file,” see Pl.’s Mem. at 7–12, and because the names and addresses of landowners are\n\n“bits of personal information,” Judicial Watch, 449 F.3d at 152, that “applies to [] particular\n\nindividual[s],” see Wash. Post Co., 690 F.2d at 260, Exemption 6 may be triggered. The Court\n\nmust next examine whether the requested information implicates a substantial privacy interest\n\nand, if so, whether release of the information would be “clearly unwarranted” in view of the\n\npublic interest, if any, in the requested documents.\n\n               1.      A Substantial Privacy Interest Exists In The Withheld Name And Address\n                       Information\n\n       In construing Exemption 6, the D.C. Circuit has held that “the disclosure of names and\n\naddresses is not inherently and always a significant threat to the privacy of those listed; whether\n\nit is a significant or a de minimis threat depends upon the characteristic(s) revealed by virtue of\n\nbeing on the particular list, and the consequences likely to ensue.” Horner, 879 F.2d at 877; see\n\nalso United States Dep’t of State v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164, 176 n.12 (1991) (noting that disclosure of\n\na list of names and other identifying information is not “inherently and always a significant\n\nthreat to the privacy of the individuals on the list.”). “In the context of an individual residence,\n\nthe court has recognized that ‘the privacy interest of an individual in avoiding the unlimited\n\ndisclosure of his or her name and address is significant.’” Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v.\n\nNorton (“Norton”), 309 F.3d 26, 35 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Horner, 879 F.2d at 875); see also\n\nSkybridge Spectrum Found., 842 F. Supp. 2d at 84 (same). CBP supports its position that there\n\nare substantial privacy interests in the names and addresses of private citizens referenced in the\n\n289 challenged emails for three reasons.\n\n       First, CBP asserts that there is a “potential [for] unwanted contact that might ensue from\n\nsuch a disclosure,” and this risk creates a heightened privacy interest. Def.’s Combined Reply\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fSupp. Mot. Summ. J. Re Email Records & Opp’n Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J. (“Def.’s Reply”) at\n\n3, 7, ECF No. 40. According to the CBP, the unwanted contact to which the landowners could\n\nbe exposed may come from “the media, other members of the public, including other landowners\n\ninvolved in a similar process, and potential harassment.” Supplemental Decl. of David E. Wade\n\n(“Suppl. Wade Decl.”) ¶ 15; see also Def.’s Reply at 3 (explaining that disclosure would risk\n\nexposing landowners to unwanted media attention because the border fence “touched a nerve\n\namong many groups.”). CBP is correct that “a justified and articulable risk of media\n\nharassment” implicates a substantial privacy interest. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of State,\n\n875 F. Supp. 2d 37, 47 (D.D.C. 2012) (citing Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland\n\nSec., 384 F. Supp. 2d 100, 118 (D.D.C. 2005) (withholding of employee names upheld where\n\nmedia scrutiny and harassment were likely)). Given that the plaintiff herself admits that the\n\nconstruction of the wall received “significant public interest and attention,” and “extensive\n\ncoverage . . . in the national, international and state and local press,” see Gilman Decl. ¶ 6 (citing\n\narticles), there is sufficient evidence to support CBP’s claim that disclosure may expose the\n\nlandowners to unwanted contact from the media. See Judicial Watch, Inc., 875 F. Supp. 2d at 47\n\n(court found government employees had a substantial privacy interest in withholding names from\n\nemails discussing a meeting on the Keystone Alaska pipeline because it could lead to “possible\n\nharassment and undesired contact by media.”).\n\n       Second, CBP argues that disclosure implicates a substantial privacy interest because the\n\nemail threads discussing the landowners also discuss details of “specific negotiations between\n\nlandowners and the government, sometimes including a discussion of the particular terms a\n\nlandowner was willing to accept to permit access or purchase,” Suppl. Wade Decl. ¶ 15, or\n\nwhether “land was subject to pending condemnations for right of entry.” Def.’s Reply at 4, 8.\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fCBP contends that disclosure of the names would, in many instances, provide information about\n\nthe landowners’ discussions with the CBP about their valuation of the use or sale of their land.\n\nDef.’s Reply at 3; see, e.g., Suppl. Wade Decl. Ex. 1 at 18 (email dated November 26, 2007,\n\nrecounting one landowner’s extended negotiations with CBP officials seeking $10,000 and a\n\nfence structure agreement); Suppl. Wade Decl. at 22 (email dated November 21, 2007, stating\n\nthat a landowner “is agreeable to allowing us to complete our survey . . . [and] is very pleased\n\nwith the progress thus far and looks forward to working together, but he does have some requests\n\n(fence type)”); id. at 16 (email dated December 6, 2007, commenting that “[name redacted] is\n\nnot going to relent . . . [and] is absolutely sure that he has the upper hand” and wants “money and\n\na fence structure agreement from” CBP). This information, if disclosed, would “allow for an\n\ninference to be drawn about the financial situation of an individual,” see Multi Ag Media LLC,\n\n515 F.3d at 1230, which creates an amplified privacy interest in the names and addresses. See\n\nHorner, 879 F.2d at 876–77; Consumers’ Checkbook Ctr. for the Study of Servs. v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nHealth & Human Servs., 554 F.3d 1046, 1050 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (recognizing that the D.C. Circuit\n\nhas “consistently held that an individual has a substantial privacy interest under FOIA in his\n\nfinancial information, including income”); Jurewicz v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 741 F.3d 1326, 1332\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2014) (affirming district court’s finding that there is a “non-negligible, limited privacy\n\ninterest” in information related to dog breeders’ gross sales under Exemption 6 privacy interest\n\nanalysis); Multi Ag Media LLC, 515 F.3d at 1230 (finding a substantial privacy interest in\n\ndisclosure of a farm’s reported acreage and the “number and width of rows of tobacco” because\n\nit “‘may provide a snapshot’ of a farm’s financial circumstances and ‘shed[] light on the\n\nfinancial condition of the farmer’”) (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f       Third, CBP contends that the names implicate a substantial privacy interest because the\n\nnames are referenced as part of discussions between CBP employees that reveal the landowners’\n\npersonal relationships and “specific statements” that the landowners have made regarding their\n\nviews about the border fence. See Suppl. Wade Decl. ¶ 15; Def.’s Mem. at 8; see, e.g.,\n\nSupplemental Gilman Decl. (“Suppl. Gilman Decl.”) Ex. E at 16 (email dated February 25, 2008,\n\nstated that “[redacted name] admitted that he could not see the controversy after looking into the\n\nmaps available on the internet”); Gilman Decl. Ex. 4 at 30 (email dated April 30, 2007, that\n\nreferences area along the proposed fence “belong[ing] to one owner [name redacted] who is a\n\nfriend of the President and a staunch supporter of the Border Patrol . . . [but] is adamantly\n\nopposed to the fence concept”).\n\n       The plaintiff responds that there is no substantial privacy interest because “the main\n\ninformation that would be revealed” would be “that the named people owned land that was\n\npotentially going to be affected by the building of the border wall.” Pl.’s Mem. at 8; see, e.g.,\n\nSuppl. Wade Decl. Ex. 1 at 17 (email dated November 26, 2007, in which CBP employee asks,\n\n“[w]ill [name redacted] sell the property needed for the fence alignment as well as the ROE for\n\nsurvey?”). She contends that other emails with redactions only reference names with respect to\n\ninformation that is already publicly disclosed. Pl.’s Mem. at 8; see, e.g., Suppl. Gilman Decl.\n\nEx. B at 8 (email dated February 4, 2008, referencing a news article that is attached in the email\n\nabout a lawsuit filed by “the Mennonite Brethren Church and private landowner [name\n\nredacted]”). Other emails mention names as a shorthand way to identify property. Pl.’s Mem. at\n\n8 (citing Gilman Decl. Ex. 5 at 34 (email dated February 26, 2008, stating that “[w]e actually just\n\ndrove by [name redacted] house on segment O-15”); id. Ex. 6 at 37 (email dated February 1,\n\n2008, stating that CBP was granted possession to investigate a list of properties that are all\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fidentified by redacted names)); see also Suppl. Gilman Decl. Ex. E at 19 (email dated February\n\n22, 2008, referring to “property owned by the [name redacted]”).\n\n       The Court agrees with the CBP. Contrary to the plaintiff’s claims, the information at\n\nissue here comprises more than just publicly available names and addresses. Notably, even if\n\nthese names and addresses were publicly available, a finding of a substantial privacy interest\n\nwould not be precluded. See Am. Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice (“ACLU”), 655\n\nF.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (finding a minimal but “more than a de minimis” privacy interest in\n\ndocket numbers and names of defendants when information was “already publicly available and\n\nreadily accessible” and disclosure would “simply provide one more place in which a\n\ncomputerized search will find the same person’s name and conviction”). In any event, the\n\ncontext in which these names appear in the CBP emails is not publicly accessible information,\n\nwhich creates a heightened privacy interest. Indeed, some of the names and addresses are part of\n\ndiscussions revealing, at least to a limited extent, the property owner’s financial information,\n\nopinions, or the substance of their conversations with the CBP. See Suppl. Wade Decl. Ex. 1;\n\nsee also Def.’s Mem. at 4, 8. Cf. Columbia Riverkeeper v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm’n, 650\n\nF. Supp. 2d 1121, 1129 (D. Or. 2009) (finding that agency failed to establish sufficient privacy\n\ninterest in mailing list of landowners on the path of proposed pipeline in part because “the names\n\nand addresses themselves [did not] reveal private decisions of those individuals” and agency had\n\nreleased names on similar lists in the past). In this case, because CBP has demonstrated that\n\ndisclosure would create “a justified and articulable risk of media harassment” for all the\n\nlandowners, Judicial Watch, Inc., 875 F. Supp. 2d at 47, and that disclosure would reveal\n\nfinancial information, or opinions and views of some landowners, there is a more than de\n\nminimis privacy interest. As noted, the standard for demonstrating a substantial privacy interest\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fis not a high one, see Horner, 879 F.2d at 874 (substantial privacy interest is anything greater\n\nthan de minimis), and CBP has demonstrated that the privacy interest is more than de minimis.\n\n               2.      The Public Interest Outweighs The Private Interest\n\n        “The public interest to be weighed against the privacy interest in this balancing test is\n\n‘the extent to which disclosure would serve the ‘core purposes of the FOIA’” by “‘contribut[ing]\n\nsignificantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.’” Norton,\n\n309 F.3d at 33–34 (citing U.S. Dep’t of Def. v. Fed. Labor Relations Authority (“Dep’t of Def.”),\n\n510 U.S. 487, 495 (1994)). In making the requisite balancing analysis here, the Court finds that\n\nCBP has failed to demonstrate that the public interest outweighs the landowners’ privacy\n\ninterest.\n\n        The plaintiff claims that the public interest is “significant” because it will “help the public\n\nunderstand the actual dimensions and location of the wall” as well as “allow the public to\n\nanalyze whether the government was treating property owners equally and fairly” or whether\n\nCBP built the wall in such a way that it disadvantaged “minority property owners.” Pl.’s Mem.\n\nat 10–11; see also Pl.’s Reply at 6 (“[T]he public has a significant interest in understanding\n\nwhich properties were affected by the placement of the wall, and how those property owners\n\nwere affected.”). CBP responds that the public interest in the disclosure of landowner names and\n\naddresses is “sharply limited,” Def.’s Mem. at 15, because “the names and contact information\n\nfor these individuals does not shed light on CBP’s operations or activities.” Def.’s Mem. at 17.\n\nCBP adds that information on the personal impact of the wall on individual landowners’ families\n\nis not a matter of public concern “but a personal issue unique to the particular landowner.”\n\nDef.’s Reply at 9. Notwithstanding the fact that disclosure of the names the plaintiff seeks will,\n\nat least in some instances, reveal information about the landowners’ personal opinions and\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fnegotiations with the government, the plaintiff is correct that, on balance, the public interest\n\noutweighs the landowners’ privacy interest.\n\n       CBP fails adequately to consider the extent to which the release of the landowners’\n\nnames in the aggregate will further public understanding. It cites several cases for support, all of\n\nwhich are inapposite. CBP relies on U.S. Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for\n\nFreedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 775 (1989), to support its contention that “[i]nformation\n\nthat does not directly reveal the operation or activities of the federal government ‘falls outside\n\nthe ambit of the public interest that the FOIA was enacted to serve.’” Def.’s Mem. at 15–16.\n\nMore precisely, the Supreme Court held that where the request sought only private information\n\nand would reveal no “official information” about a government agency, the invasion of privacy\n\nis” unwarranted. Id. at 780. Reporters Comm. Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. at 780. Based\n\nupon this holding, CBP makes the unremarkable observation that “even a modest privacy interest\n\noutweighs nothing every time.” Def.’s Mem. at 16 (citing Horner, 879 F.2d at 874–75). This\n\nholding does not, as CBP asserts, foreclose a request that indirectly reveals information about the\n\noperations of a government agency through the disclosure of private information. Contrary to\n\nCBP’s argument, the public interest in this case is significant and does not amount to “nothing.”\n\nId.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit’s decision in ACLU, 655 F.3d at 1, is particularly instructive. There, the\n\nCircuit considered the balancing of privacy and public interests under Exemption 7(C), but the\n\nambit of Exemption 7(C) is relevant to this discussion. Exemption 7(C) is “somewhat broader”\n\nthan Exemption 6, Roth v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 642 F.3d 1161, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting\n\nReporters Comm. Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. at 756), because, although the cognizable harm\n\nunder both exemptions is an “unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” this harm must be\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f“clear[ ]” under Exemption 6, yet it need only be “reasonably [] expected” under Exemption\n\n7(C). See 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(b)(6), 552(b)(7)(C). Consequently, “‘Exemption 7(C) is more\n\nprotective of privacy than Exemption 6’ and thus establishes a lower bar for withholding\n\nmaterial.” ACLU, 655 F.3d at 6 (citations omitted). In ACLU, an advocacy organization sought\n\nthe disclosure of docket numbers and names of defendants who had been the targets of\n\nwarrantless cell phone tracking. Id. at 12. The Circuit found that there was “more than a de\n\nminimis privacy interest,” but not “much more” because the information was already “readily\n\navailable to the public,” which “reduces . . . the incursion on privacy resulting from disclosure.”\n\nId. at 9, 12. The agency argued that despite the minimal private interest, disclosure was not\n\nrequired because the case names and docket numbers “standing alone generate no public\n\nbenefit.” Id. at 15. The Court disagreed, holding that the public benefit was “significant”\n\nbecause the requested information could be used derivatively in order to “shed light on\n\ngovernment conduct” on “a topic of considerable public interest.” Id. at 12. The information,\n\nwhen compiled, would “inform [an] ongoing public policy discussion by shedding light on the\n\nscope and effectiveness of cell phone tracking as a law enforcement tool.” Id. at 13. Even under\n\nthe more stringent 7(C) privacy protection standard, the Circuit held that this public interest\n\noutweighed the minimal privacy interest of the publicly available information, and ordered\n\ndisclosure of the withheld information. Id. at 16.\n\n       Similarly here, although the names and addresses of the land owners implicates a stronger\n\nprivacy interest than in ACLU because the information reveals more than just publicly available\n\ninformation, see Part III.A.1., supra, there is great public benefit to learning the social impact of\n\nCBP’s construction of the wall. Revealing the identities of landowners in the wall’s planned\n\nconstruction site may shed light on, inter alia, the impact on indigenous communities, the\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fdisparate impact on lower-income minority communities, and the practices of private\n\ncontractors. See Gilman Decl. ¶ 7. The information, after appropriate analysis, could reveal\n\nCBP’s decisionmaking and conduct as it relates to the Texas-Mexico border wall planning and\n\nconstruction, thus it helps the public “learn something directly about the workings of the\n\nGovernment.” Horner, 879 F.2d at 879 (emphasis in original). Although the privacy interest in\n\nthe requested information is not insubstantial, it does not outweigh the strong public interest in\n\nreleasing the names and addresses.\n\n       “[W]ith regard to the applicability of Exemption 6 to names and home addresses, federal\n\ncourts have differed in their conclusions when employing the private interest/public interest\n\nbalancing test.” People for the Am. Way Found. v. Nat’l Park Serv., 503 F. Supp. 2d 284, 304–\n\n05 (D.D.C. 2007). A survey of these cases shows that, on balance, when the disclosed\n\ninformation would “‘she[d] light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties’ or otherwise\n\nlet citizens know ‘what their government is up to,’” Dep’t of Def., 510 U.S. at 497 (citations\n\nomitted), disclosure is appropriate, even if the Court has recognized a significant privacy interest.\n\nIn other words, even when a significant privacy interest is at stake, Exemption 6 “require[s] a\n\nbalance tilted emphatically in favor of disclosure.” Stern, 737 F.2d at 91; see also News-Press v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 489 F.3d 1173, 1198 (11th Cir. 2007) (“The federal courts,\n\nincluding this one, have therefore generally concluded that an agency’s burden under Exemption\n\n6 of showing that disclosure ‘would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal\n\nprivacy’ is an onerous one.”).\n\n       In considering disclosure of names and addresses of private citizens when such\n\ninformation is associated with citizens’ financial information, such as receipt of government\n\nbenefits, or the value of property and acreage, courts have scrutinized the precise public interest\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fin the information. Upon articulation by a requester of a legitimate public interest in disclosure\n\nof names and addresses, courts have required disclosure. See Multi Ag Media LLC, 515 F.3d at\n\n1232–33 (holding that Farm Service Agency’s database revealing field acreage and ownership of\n\nland was not properly withheld, even though there was a privacy interest in the financial\n\ninformation, because there was a strong public interest in enabling “the public [to] more easily\n\ndetermine whether USDA is” monitoring noncompliance); News-Press, 489 F.3d at 1196, 1205\n\n(ordering disclosure of street addresses of recipients of FEMA aid because there was “a powerful\n\npublic interest” in determining where FEMA distributed “billions of taxpayer dollars” that\n\noutweighed any privacy interest, but no disclosure of recipients’ names because “the names\n\n[were] not necessary to determine the extent of fraud against FEMA”); W. Watersheds Project v.\n\nBureau of Land Mgmt., CV 09-482-CWD, 2010 WL 3735710, at *10 (D. Idaho Sept. 13, 2010)\n\n(finding that name, address, email, phone number, and other details about grazing permittee’s\n\npermit allotments constituted a “minimal,” but “non-trivial privacy interest,” which was\n\nultimately outweighed by the public interest in determining whether permits were properly\n\nissued); Columbia Riverkeeper, 650 F. Supp. 2d at 1130 (holding that the public interest in\n\ndisclosing mailing list of names and addresses of people on path of proposed pipeline\n\noutweighed any privacy interest in the information because disclosure would help public to\n\noversee whether agency was complying with public notice mandate). By contrast, where courts\n\nhave found no public interest in the release of the information whatsoever, Exemption 6 has been\n\napplied to withhold names and addresses associated with financial information. See Consumers’\n\nCheckbook Ctr. for the Study of Servs., 554 F.3d at 1051 (finding a strong privacy interest “in the\n\ntotal payments [physicians] receive from Medicare for covered services” that prevented\n\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\fdisclosure only because revealing the physicians’ names did “not serve any FOIA-related public\n\ninterest”) (emphasis added).\n\n         Some of the challenged emails here also reveal the views of private citizens. In\n\nanalogous circumstances, courts have required the disclosure of names and addresses in\n\nconnection with a private citizen’s statements or views when the private citizen voluntarily\n\nrelayed this information to the government and the requester identified a public interest. See\n\nElec. Frontier Found. v. Office of the Dir. of Nat’l Intelligence, 639 F.3d 876, 887 (9th Cir.\n\n2010) (holding that Exemption 6 did not cover names of corporate lobbyists petitioning the\n\ngovernment on behalf of corporate clients because there “is a clear public interest in the public\n\nknowledge of the methods through which well-connected corporate lobbyists wield their\n\ninfluence”); People for the Am. Way Found., 503 F. Supp. 2d at 305–06 (finding that agency\n\nimproperly withheld under Exemption 6 names and addresses, phone numbers, and email\n\naddresses of citizens “who submitted unsolicited email comments . . . concerning the proposed\n\nchange of the video display at the Lincoln Memorial” because there is little privacy interest in\n\ncontact information when someone petitions the government and “the public interest in knowing\n\nwho” convinced the agency “to change the video outweighs any privacy interest in one’s name”);\n\nAlliance for Wild Rockies v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 53 F. Supp. 2d 32, 37 (D.D.C. 1999) (holding\n\nthat Exemption 6 did not cover withholding of names and addresses of rulemaking commenters\n\nbecause there was little privacy interest since information was voluntarily submitted and the\n\n“public has much to learn about defendants’ rulemaking process” including whose comments\n\n“the defendants give greater weight” to).4\n\n\n4\n  Consistent with CBP’s observation that disclosure is not warranted when no public interest in the information is\nidentified, courts have applied Exemption 6 to protect names and addresses associated with a citizen’s views where\nthey have found no public interest in the disclosure. See, e.g., Gov’t Accountability Project v. U.S. Dep’t of State,\n699 F. Supp. 2d 97, 106 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding that names and emails were properly withheld under Exemption 6\n\n                                                         21\n\f         The outcome of the D.C. Circuit cases the parties rely on only provides further support\n\nthat disclosure here is appropriate. Both parties extensively discuss Norton and Horner, which\n\nreach opposite conclusions in their consideration of the balancing of the privacy and public\n\ninterests at stake with the disclosure of names and addresses. See Def.’s Reply at 5–7, Pl.’s\n\nReply at 2–3; see also Horner, 879 F.2d at 874–77; Norton, 309 F.3d at 30. In Norton, the U.S.\n\nFish and Wildlife Service withheld the addresses of private landowners who had voluntarily\n\nreported pygmy owl sightings due to a fear that “lawless birdwatchers” would trespass on the\n\nlandowners’ properties. Norton, 309 F.3d at 30, 34. Although the requester only sought the\n\naddresses of the landowners, id. at 30, the D.C. Circuit still found a substantial privacy interest in\n\nthe information because knowledge of an individual address was “only a step from being able to\n\nidentify from state records the name of the individual property owner,” id. at 35. Nevertheless,\n\nthe Court held that this privacy interest was insufficient to overcome the significant public\n\ninterest in reviewing the agency’s use of the information to designate areas as a “critical habitat”\n\nunder the Endangered Species Act. Id. at 36.\n\n         CBP responds by arguing that the facts at issue are closer to Horner, where the D.C.\n\nCircuit found that the Office of Personnel Management properly withheld a list of names and\n\naddresses of retired or disabled federal employees. Horner, 879 F.2d at 879–80. The Circuit\n\nrecognized that there was a “modest personal privacy interest” that weighed against revealing the\n\n\nwhere there was a “clear privacy interest” in avoiding disclosure of emails and such disclosure would serve no\npublic purpose); Voinche v. F.B.I., 940 F. Supp. 323, 330 (D.D.C. 1996) aff’d, No. 96-5304, 1997 WL 411685 (D.C.\nCir. June 19, 1997) (finding that Exemption 6 protects from disclosure names of “private citizens who wrote to\ngovernment officials” because there was “no reason to believe that the public will obtain a better understanding of\nthe workings of various agencies by learning the[ir] identities”); Prudential Locations LLC v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. &\nUrban Dev., 739 F.3d 424, 426, 434 (9th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (finding that agency properly withheld names of\npeople who reported illegal activity because the privacy interest was great and the plaintiff presented no evidence\nthat disclosure of the names would shed light on agency’s investigations or activities); Lakin Law Firm, P.C. v. FTC,\n352 F.3d 1122, 1125 (7th Cir. 2003) (holding that names of people who complained to agency of billing scams were\nproperly withheld under Exemption 6 even though they submitted complaints via website that warned that\ncomments could be publicly disclosed because the information would reveal nothing about agency workings and\nthere was no public interest).\n\n                                                         22\n\fnames only because there was “no public interest” in disclosure where the only stated public\n\nbenefit was “inform[ing] the public . . . where its money is going.” Id. at 879 (emphasis added).\n\nThe Circuit found that this public interest is insufficient because it “say[s] nothing of\n\nsignificance” about the inner workings of the government. Id.\n\n       Horner and Norton are consistent with the cases discussed above. While there was no\n\npublic benefit found in Horner, the Norton court identified a strong public interest, which\n\nwarranted the intrusion into the privacy interest identified and compelled the Circuit to order\n\ndisclosure. The sum of these cases establish that where the requester has articulated a legitimate\n\npublic interest in the information, courts have ordered disclosure of names and addresses, even if\n\nsuch information is associated with financial information, views held by the landowner, or would\n\nrisk unwanted contact.\n\n       Similarly here, as noted, the public interest in learning how CBP negotiated with private\n\ncitizens regarding the planning and construction of the border wall is significant. This public\n\ninterest outweighs the privacy interest in landowners’ names and addresses in CBP emails.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court holds that the public interest in disclosing\n\nthe names and addresses of landowners outweighs the implicated privacy interest and CBP’s\n\nwithholding of the information under Exemption 6 is improper.\n\n       B.      FOIA Exemption 7(E)\n\n       CBP has withheld under exemption 7(E) information relating to its assessment of the\n\nneed for fencing. Exemption 7(E) covers “records or information compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes” that “would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or\n\nprosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if\n\nsuch disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.” 5 U.S.C. §\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f552(b)(7)(E). The “requirement that disclosure risk circumvention of the law ‘sets a relatively\n\nlow bar for the agency to justify withholding.’” See Pub. Employees for Envtl. Responsibility v.\n\nU.S. Section, Int’l Boundary & Water Comm’n, U.S.-Mexico, 740 F.3d 195, 204–05 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2014) (quoting Blackwell v. FBI, 646 F.3d 37, 42 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). The agency “must\n\ndemonstrate only that release of a document might increase the risk ‘that a law will be violated\n\nor that past violators will escape legal consequences.’” Id. at 205 (quoting Mayer Brown LLP v.\n\nIRS (“Mayer Brown”), 562 F.3d 1190, 1193 (D.C. Cir. 2009)). “Rather than requiring a highly\n\nspecific burden of showing how the law will be circumvented, exemption 7(E) only requires that\n\nthe [agency] demonstrate logically how the release of the requested information might create a\n\nrisk of circumvention of the law.” Blackwell, 646 F.3d at 42 (quoting Mayer Brown, 562 F.3d at\n\n1194 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).\n\n       The plaintiff challenges the CBP’s withholdings under exemption 7(E) on three grounds.\n\nFirst, the plaintiff argues that the records are not “compiled for law enforcement purposes,” 5\n\nU.S.C. §552(b)(7), because they do not relate to an enforcement proceeding. Pl.’s Mem. at 20.\n\nThe Court disagrees. As the D.C. Circuit recently pointed out, “Law enforcement entails more\n\nthan just investigating and prosecuting individuals after a violation of the law . . . the ordinary\n\nunderstanding of law enforcement includes . . . proactive steps designed to prevent criminal\n\nactivity and to maintain security.’” See Pub. Empls. for Envtl. Responsibility, 740 F.3d at 203\n\n(citing Milner, 131 S.Ct. at 1272 (Alito, J., concurring)). This Circuit has long employed a two-\n\npart test, first set forth in Pratt v. Webster, 673 F.2d 408 (D.C. Cir. 1982), to determine whether\n\nrecords are law enforcement records. Id. A record is used for law enforcement where: “the\n\ninvestigatory activity that gave rise to the documents is ‘related to the enforcement of federal\n\nlaws,’ and there is a rational nexus between the investigation at issue and the agency’s law\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fenforcement duties.” Tax Analysts v. IRS, 294 F.3d 71, 78 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing Pratt, 673\n\nF.2d at 420–21). Moreover, courts are “more deferential to the agency’s claimed purpose for the\n\nparticular records” where “the agency’s principal function is law enforcement.” Pub-Employees\n\nfor Envtl. Responsibility, 740 F.3d at 203 (quoting Tax Analysts, 294 F.3d at 77).\n\n       Here, CBP is indisputably a law enforcement agency and is entitled to deference in its\n\ndetermination that the records were compiled for a law enforcement purpose. CBP contends that\n\nthe challenged redactions relate to its “risk and vulnerabilities assessment of illicit cross-border\n\nactivity in order to assess fencing needs,” which includes information such as “terrain,\n\nfloodplain, waterways . . . migration patterns,” as well as “areas that are difficult for Border\n\nPatrol to access” and “areas patrolled by fewer agents, and urban areas where illegal traffic has a\n\ngreater chance of blending in quickly without being apprehended.” Wade Decl. ¶ 15. This\n\ninformation “inform[s CBP’s] decisions relating to fence placement.” Suppl. Wade Decl. ¶ 18.\n\nFurthermore, some emails “contain references to specific Border Patrol Station ‘border zones,’”\n\nwhich are designations used internally for assignment coverage, and knowledge of these border\n\nzones could be used to parse law enforcement radio discussions referencing them. Wade Decl. ¶\n\n15. CBP contends that “release of this information would essentially provide a ‘roadmap’ to\n\nthose attempting to cross the border.” Wade Decl. ¶ 15.\n\n       CBP’s declarations sufficiently demonstrate that the redacted information is related to the\n\nenforcement of federal laws, as the assessment of border vulnerabilities is directly related to the\n\npotential violation of federal immigration laws and the CBP’s duty to deter illegal immigration\n\nand to apprehend illegal immigrants. See Tax Analysts, 294 F.3d at 78. Thus, the CBP has\n\ndemonstrated that the records were created for a law enforcement purpose.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\f       Second, the plaintiff asserts that Exemption 7(E) does not apply because the CBP has not\n\nshown that the challenged emails qualify as “techniques, procedures, or guidelines.” Pl.’s Mem.\n\nat 19 (citing Wade Decl. ¶ 15). According to the plaintiff, the challenged emails “contain\n\n‘assessments of the operational need for fencing,’ not information relating to investigations or\n\nprosecutions.” Id. The plaintiff’s interpretation of the statutory language is overly restrictive.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit has held that “an agency may seek to block the disclosure of internal agency\n\nmaterials relating to guidelines, techniques, sources, and procedures for law enforcement\n\ninvestigations and prosecutions, even when the materials have not been compiled in the course of\n\na specific investigation.” Tax Analysts, 294 F.3d at 79. Even if withheld documents “are not\n\n‘how-to’ manuals for law-breakers, the exemption is broader than that.” See Mayer Brown, 562\n\nF.3d at 1192–93. “Information that relates to law enforcement techniques, policies, and\n\nprocedures is properly withheld under this exemption.” Showing Animals Respect & Kindness v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Interior, 730 F. Supp. 2d 180, 199 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing Boyd v. Bureau of\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, 570 F. Supp. 2d 156, 158 (D.D.C. 2008)).\n\n       In Mayer Brown, the D.C. Circuit held that records relating to “settlement strategies and\n\nobjectives, assessments of litigating hazards, [and] acceptable ranges of percentages for\n\nsettlement” were exempt under 7(E) because, although not a “blueprint for tax shelter schemes, it\n\ncould encourage decisions to violate the law or evade punishment.” Mayer Brown, 562 F.3d at\n\n1192–93 (citing Mayer Brown LLP v. IRS, No. 04–2187, slip op. at 3 (D.D.C. Nov. 28, 2006)).\n\nHere, although the information in the challenged records are not styled as formal guidelines or\n\nprocedures for CBP officials, the records refer to information, including how CBP officials\n\nassess vulnerable areas along the border, that could be used to “encourage decisions to violate\n\nthe law or evade punishment.” Id. at 1193; see also Showing Animals Respect & Kindness, 730\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fF. Supp. 2d at 199–200 (finding that files revealing “specific details of surveillance techniques,\n\nincluding equipment used and location and timing of use,” was exempt under 7(E) because it\n\n“could compromise [the agency’s] ability to conduct future investigations”); Strunk v. U.S. Dep’t\n\nof State, 905 F. Supp. 2d 142, 148 (D.D.C. 2012) (concluding that release of computer screen\n\ntransaction codes, computer transaction codes and computer function codes, although “not\n\nthemselves techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions” are\n\nexempt under 7(E) because it “could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, while the emails in question do not reveal\n\nformal guidelines, CBP has demonstrated that the information contained in the emails could be\n\nused in the same manner as a “technique, procedure, or guideline.”\n\n         Finally, the plaintiff claims that CBP has not “logically shown that release of the records\n\ncould be reasonably expected to risk circumvention of the law.” Pl.’s Mem. at 19.5 In the\n\nplaintiff’s view, details “such as terrain and geographic location are identifiable by sight,” and\n\ntherefore the challenged records will not add to criminals’ knowledge of the conditions along the\n\nborder wall. Id. at 19–20. The plaintiff argues further that since “Border Patrol operations may\n\nhave changed” since the emails were drafted, Pl.’s Mem. at 20, the information no longer\n\n“provide[s] a roadmap of where it would currently be best to cross the border,” and, thus, does\n\nnot risk circumvention of the law. Pl.’s Reply at 11. The Court disagrees.\n\n\n5\n  “[C]ourts have disagreed over whether” the qualifying clause requiring that disclosure “reasonably be expected to\nrisk circumvention of the law,” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E), applies to “techniques and procedures for law enforcement\ninvestigations or prosecutions.” Pub. Empls. for Envtl. Responsibility, 740 F.3d at 205 n.4. This Circuit has applied\nthe qualifying clause to “techniques and procedures,” id. (citing Blackwell, 646 F.3d at 41–42), but “given the low\nbar posed by the ‘risk circumvention of the law’ requirement, it is not clear that the difference matters much in\npractice.” Id. CBP argues that the final clause does not apply to “techniques and procedures,” and that the\nexemption thus “afford[s] ‘categorical protection’” for techniques and procedures. See Def.’s Mem. at 20 (citing\nSmith v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 977 F. Supp. 496, 501 (D.D.C. 1997)). As discussed below,\nCBP has demonstrated through its declarations that disclosure “could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention\nof the law.” Thus the exemption is applicable in any event and the Court need not decide the scope of the qualifying\nclause of Exemption 7(E).\n\n                                                         27\n\f       Although some geological factors may be readily identifiable by sight or through publicly\n\navailable information, CBP has also attested that the emails reveal “areas that are difficult for\n\nBorder Patrol to access” and “areas patrolled by fewer agents.” Wade Decl. ¶ 15. Such\n\ninformation discloses the CBP’s operations and vulnerabilities, which are not readily-accessible\n\npublic information, the disclosure of which could risk appropriation to circumvent the law. See\n\nShowing Animals Respect & Kindness, 730 F. Supp. 2d at 200 (finding that documents detailing\n\nsurveillance techniques logically risked circumvention of the law because, “although trespassers\n\nand poachers . . . likely know that they are subject to surveillance, the details of the surveillance\n\ntechniques are unknown to them”); Blanton v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 63 F. Supp. 2d 35, 49–50\n\n(D.D.C. 1999) (holding that Exemption 7(E) applies to documents revealing FBI polygraph\n\ntechniques because although general information on the polygraph test is “often depicted and\n\ndiscussed,” the “specific methods employed by the FBI” are not generally known). Moreover,\n\nthe discussion of publicly available information, itself, reveals what information CBP considers\n\nwhen analyzing its vulnerabilities at the border, and this analysis, itself, is not publicly known\n\nand may risk circumvention of the law. See Blackwell, 646 F.3d at 42 (manner in which FBI\n\ndata is “searched, organized, and reported to the FBI is an internal technique, not known to the\n\npublic” therefore is subject to exemption 7(E)). Although the plaintiff claims that vulnerabilities\n\nat the border may have changed since the emails were drafted, making this information\n\nineffectual, the plaintiff has put forth no evidence to prove that the information is no longer\n\ncurrent and lacks all value to would-be violators. See Pl.’s Mem. at 20; Pl.’s Reply at 11. Here,\n\nCBP has submitted two declarations declaring that release of this information would aid those\n\nattempting to cross the border as well as “smugglers and criminal elements” in their\n\ndetermination of CBP’s vulnerabilities along the border. See Wade Decl. ¶ 15; Suppl. Wade\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\fDecl. ¶ 18. In FOIA cases, agency declarations are viewed with “a presumption of good faith,”\n\nGround Saucer Watch v. CIA, 692 F.2d 770, 771 (D.C. Cir. 1981), and since the plaintiff has\n\npresented no counter-evidence and no evidence of the agency’s bad faith in its declarations, the\n\nCourt finds that CBP has shown that the challenged withholding under Exemption 7(E) would\n\nrisk circumvention of the law. Id.\n\n       The plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence contradicting the CBP’s contention\n\nthat the redacted information falls under Exemption 7(E) as techniques or procedures that are\n\nreasonably shown to risk circumvention of the law. Accordingly, the Court finds that CBP has\n\nshown that the challenged withholdings detailing the operational need to determine fencing are\n\nappropriately withheld under FOIA exemption 7(E).\n\n       C.        Email Attachments\n\n       The plaintiff and CBP dispute whether CBP is improperly withholding the attachments to\n\nresponsive emails pursuant to the parties’ agreement to limit the scope of CBP’s production of\n\nemails. The crux of the parties’ dispute is the interpretation of the language of their joint status\n\nreport, which embodies the parties’ agreement on the scope of the agency’s obligations in\n\nfulfilling the plaintiff’s FOIA request. See generally 7/23/09 JSR. As described below, the plain\n\nmeaning of the parties’ joint status report and the language of this Court’s order ratifying the\n\nparties’ agreement make it apparent that CBP was only obliged to produce to the plaintiff the\n\nsame records that CBP produced in the CREW litigation.\n\n       The parties fundamentally disagree over the terms of the agreement governing the CBP’s\n\nproduction of records to the plaintiff. The parties submitted a joint status report to the Court\n\nadvising that:\n\n       [I]n the interest of expediting the release of emails to Plaintiff, CBP may satisfy\n       Plaintiff’s FOIA request with respect to the processing of emails by providing to\n\n                                                 29\n\f       Plaintiff the emails as released in CREW v. DHS pursuant to the search described\n       in the Joint Status Report and Proposed Disclosure Schedule . . . in that case as\n       follows: (1) by providing Plaintiff, within 30 days of the entry of the\n       accompanying order, all emails already released in CREW v. DHS and (2) going\n       forward, by providing Plaintiff further emails as they are released on a rolling\n       basis in that case.\n\n7/23/09 JSR at 3 (emphasis added). The Court entered a Scheduling Order effectuating this\n\nagreement based on the proposed order submitted by the parties with their joint status report.\n\nSee Proposed Order ¶ 2, ECF No. 6-1; 7/27/09 Sched. Order ¶ 2; Def.’s Reply at 21 n.6. The\n\nOrder required CBP to, inter alia, “release to Plaintiff all email records already released in\n\n[CREW], and, going forward, CBP will release to Plaintiff on a rolling basis all email records\n\nreleased in CREW v. DHS, on the same schedule as they are released in that case.” See 7/27/09\n\nSched. Order ¶ 2.\n\n       Both parties construe the phrase “as released” in the joint status report to impose different\n\nrequirements on CBP with respect to the production of records. CBP contends that this wording\n\nlimits the scope of the plaintiff’s FOIA request and reflects the parties’ agreement that CBP\n\nwould only produce to the plaintiff the documents that were “actually released in CREW and\n\nnothing else” and that “any email related records not released in CREW because the parties in\n\nCREW did not consider them to be responsive were . . . not responsive to Plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequest.” See Def.’s Reply at 23. Thus, CBP contends that it satisfied its FOIA obligation to the\n\nplaintiff by “undertak[ing] the administrative act of forwarding emails released in CREW to\n\nPlaintiff.” Def.’s Reply at 21.\n\n       The plaintiff responds that CBP’s agreement to produce documents “as released” in\n\nCREW refers merely to the timing of the release of the records. Pl.’s Mem. at 22. The plaintiff\n\nasserts that under the agreement, CBP agreed to release the documents to the plaintiff according\n\nto the scheduled release of documents in CREW. Id. The plaintiff further explains that the\n\n                                                 30\n\flanguage of the joint status report stating that CBP would release records “pursuant to the search\n\ndescribed” in CREW, indicates that the parties agreed to limit the “scope of the search for\n\nrecords” only, and not the scope of the documents that CBP was obliged to produce. Id. at 21\n\n(emphasis added). The plaintiff reasons that the agreement relieved CBP of “retrieving and\n\nprocessing additional records,” but did not permit CBP to withhold portions of records that were\n\ndeemed responsive, even if these portions of records were not released to the plaintiff in CREW.\n\nPl.’s Reply at 12 (emphasis in original). Consequently, the plaintiff claims that CBP is\n\nimproperly withholding the attachments to the responsive emails because the attachments are a\n\n“portion of the records.” Pl.’s Mem. at 21.\n\n       The plain meaning of the joint status report makes clear that the plaintiff narrowed her\n\nFOIA request to require CBP to produce only emails that the CBP actually produced to the\n\nCREW plaintiff “on a rolling basis in that case.” 7/23/09 JSR at 3. The phrase “as released”\n\nplainly refers to the records actually released to the plaintiff in CREW, rather than the timing of\n\nthe releases, as the plaintiff contends. Thus, CBP is correct that it “may satisfy Plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequest” by providing the plaintiff the same emails that the CBP produced in CREW. The\n\nattachments, therefore, are not being withheld, but, as memorialized by the parties’ joint status\n\nreport, are not responsive to the plaintiff’s amended FOIA request.\n\n       Even if the joint status report were ambiguous on this point, the Court’s subsequent\n\nScheduling Order based on the parties’ proposed order supports CBP’s interpretation of the joint\n\nstatus report. See Act Now to Stop War & End Racism Coal. v. D.C., 286 F.R.D. 117, 129\n\n(D.D.C. 2012) (explaining that scheduling orders “should be read as being specific and\n\ncomprehensive” and that “[w]hen an Order details the scope of permissible discovery, a party\n\nshould not read into the gaps permission to propound whatever discovery it so wishes”). The\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fOrder states that CBP “will release to Plaintiff on a rolling basis all email records released in\n\nCREW, on the same schedule as they are released in that case.” 7/27/09 Sched. Order ¶ 2. The\n\nOrder clarifies CBP’s two separate obligations: the first phrase requires CBP to release to the\n\nplaintiff the same records “released” in CREW, while the latter phrase requires that CBP release\n\nthe responsive email records to the plaintiff at the same time that the records are released to the\n\nplaintiff in CREW. See Pl.’s Mem. at 21–25; Def.’s Mem. 4–9. The plain meaning of both the\n\nparties’ joint status report and this Court’s subsequent Order are clear that CBP had to release to\n\nthe plaintiff the same records released in CREW at the same time that they were released in\n\nCREW. The plaintiff’s post hoc effort to re-write the agreement with CBP as limiting her FOIA\n\nrequest only to the same search conducted but not the same production as in CREW is simply not\n\nsustainable. The agreement limited both CBP’s search and production obligation to the agency’s\n\nefforts in CREW. Thus, contrary to the plaintiff’s contention, the responsive documents to which\n\nthe plaintiff is entitled are defined both by the search conducted by CBP, and also by the\n\ndocuments actually produced in CREW. Since the email attachments were not actually produced\n\nin CREW because they were deemed nonresponsive, they correspondingly need not be produced\n\nto the plaintiff.6\n\n        The plaintiff argues that the Order ratifies her interpretation of the language of the joint\n\nstatus report because it omits the phrase “as released” from the Order. Pl.’s Mem. at 22; see\n\n7/27/09 Sched. Order ¶ 2 (requiring that “going forward, CBP will release to Plaintiff on a\n\nrolling basis all email records released in CREW v. DHS”). The omission of this phrase in the\n\n\n\n6\n  CBP further argues that the challenged email attachments are not required to be disclosed, first, because the\nplaintiff did not challenge the withholding of the email attachments while CBP was making its rolling productions,\nDef.’s Mem. at 8 (“It was not until late May 2011—nearly 21 months after the first release of email records—that\nPlaintiff first raised any issue regarding the lack of attachments to the emails released in CREW”), and, second,\nbecause producing the attachments would frustrate the parties’ purpose of expediting disclosure, id. at 8–9. Since\nthe Court finds in CBP’s favor, the Court need not address these arguments.\n\n                                                        32\n\fOrder does not support the plaintiff’s interpretation. Indeed, the language of the Order lends\n\nstronger support to CBP’s claim because the Order states, in two separate clauses, that (1) CBP\n\nmust “release to Plaintiff all email records already released in [CREW]” and that they must\n\ncontinue to release to the plaintiff “on a rolling basis all email records released in” CREW, and\n\n(2) this production must occur “on the same schedule as they are released in that case.” 7/27/09\n\nSched. Order ¶ 2. See also Def.’s Reply at 21 n.6. The schedule on which CBP was required to\n\nrelease records to the plaintiff is set out in the second clause and was thus a separate requirement\n\nfrom the scope of the responsive records set out in the first clause. The plaintiff’s interpretation\n\nconflates both clauses to refer to the timing of the releases, but this is inconsistent with the canon\n\nof statutory interpretation against surplusage. Courts have used canons of statutory interpretation\n\nto clarify court orders. See Act Now to Stop War & End Racism Coal., 286 F.R.D. at 129\n\n(interpreting court’s standing order); see also Bhd. of Locomotive Eng’rs & Trainmen v.\n\nBurlington N. Santa Fe Ry. Co., 925 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1256 (D. Wyo. 2013), aff’d sub nom.,\n\nBhd. of Locomotive Eng’rs & Trainmen v. BNSF Ry. Co., 13-8025, 2013 WL 6404962 (10th Cir.\n\nDec. 9, 2013) (interpreting order of a railroad adjustment board). Accordingly, applying the\n\ncanon against surplusage to the Court’s order dictates an interpretation that none of the phrases\n\nare “inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.” See Corley v. United States, 129 S.Ct.\n\n1558, 1566 (2009) (“[O]ne of the most basic interpretive canons [is] that ‘[a] statute should be\n\nconstrued so that effect is given to all its provisions’” (quoting Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 101,\n\n124 (2004))); Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848, 849 (2000) (“Judges should hesitate to treat\n\nstatutory terms in any setting as surplusage” (citing Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 140–\n\n41 (1994))). In short, the inclusion in the Order of the second clause requiring CBP to release\n\nthe emails “on the same schedule as they are released in that case,” is the relevant phrase to\n\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fcontrol the timing of disclosure, while the scope of the responsive records is defined by the\n\nrecords released in CREW. 7/27/09 Sched. Order.\n\n       Although CBP’s interpretation of the parties’ agreement is correct, this is a classic\n\nPyrrhic victory. The plaintiff may simply file a new FOIA request seeking these same email\n\nattachments. See Spannaus v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 824 F.2d 52, 61 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (discussing\n\na plaintiff’s ability to resurrect a FOIA claim for statute of limitations purposes because a\n\nrequester could simply “refile his FOIA request tomorrow and restart the process” because\n\n“nothing prevents him from requesting the same withheld documents decade after decade”)\n\n(cited in Aftergood v. CIA, 225 F. Supp. 2d 27, 30–31 (D.D.C. 2002)). Nevertheless, for the\n\npurposes of the plaintiff’s present FOIA request, as narrowed pursuant to the parties’ joint status\n\nreport and this Court’s Order, this Court holds that CBP is not required to produce the email\n\nattachments of responsive records to the plaintiff.\n\n       D.      Segregability\n\n       The FOIA requires that “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be\n\nprovided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.”\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b). The plaintiff has not challenged CBP’s failure to release all reasonably\n\nsegregable information to the plaintiff pursuant to its obligation to do so under the FOIA. See id.\n\nNevertheless, even when a plaintiff does not challenge the segregability efforts of an agency, the\n\nCourt has “an affirmative duty to consider the segregability issue sua sponte.” Trans-Pac.\n\nPolicing Agreement v. U.S. Customs Serv., 177 F.3d 1022, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 1999); see also\n\nJuarez v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 518 F.3d 54, 60 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (“Under this Circuit’s law, the\n\ndistrict court’s failure to address segregability in its memorandum opinion is reversible error.”).\n\nThe D.C. Circuit has acknowledged that establishing the non-segregability of non-exempt\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fmaterial “presents problems for the agency since ... segregability depends entirely on what\n\ninformation is in a document and how it is presented.” Mead Data Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Air\n\nForce, 566 F.2d 242, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Therefore, although “agencies should not be forced\n\nto provide such a detailed justification that would itself compromise the secret nature of\n\npotentially exempt information,” agencies “must be required to provide the reasons behind their\n\nconclusions in order that they may be challenged by FOIA plaintiffs and reviewed by the courts.”\n\nId.\n\n       To this end, the Circuit has said that “[i]n addition to a statement of its reasons, an agency\n\nshould also describe what proportion of the information in a document is non-exempt and how\n\nthat material is dispersed throughout the document.” Id. Under Mead Data, if a small\n\nproportion of the information is non-exempt, the agency’s explanatory burden is less, and if a\n\nlarger proportion of the information is non-exempt, “the courts should require a high standard of\n\nproof for an agency claim that the burden of separation justifies nondisclosure or that disclosure\n\nof the non-exempt material would indirectly reveal the exempt information.” Id. Since Mead\n\nData, the Circuit has relaxed this standard, holding that “[a]gencies are entitled to a presumption\n\nthat they complied with the obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material,” which must\n\nbe overcome by some “quantum of evidence” by the requester. Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv.,\n\n494 F.3d 1106, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Indeed, more recent decisions from the D.C. Circuit have\n\nheld that an agency may satisfy its segregability obligations by (1) providing a Vaughn index that\n\nadequately describes each withheld document and the exemption under which it was withheld;\n\nand (2) submitting a declaration attesting that the agency released all segregable material. See,\n\ne.g., Loving v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 550 F.3d 32, 41 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (stating that “the description\n\nof the document set forth in the Vaughn index and the agency’s declaration that it released all\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\fsegregable material” are “sufficient for [the segregability] determination”); Johnson v. Exec.\n\nOffice for U.S. Att’ys, 310 F.3d 771, 776 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (upholding agency’s segregation\n\nefforts based on “comprehensive Vaughn index” and “the affidavits of” agency officials).\n\n       In the instant case, CBP has provided the plaintiff with a Vaughn index of the 289\n\nchallenged records listing the justification for withholding information. See Wade Decl. at 15.\n\nCBP has also submitted two declarations by David E. Wade, the Operations Officer with the\n\nOffice of Border Patrol within the Department of Homeland Security, which attest that CBP “has\n\nprocessed and released all reasonably segregable information within the disputed email\n\ndocuments” after “carefully evaluat[ing] each email document.” Wade Decl. ¶ 16. Moreover,\n\nCBP reviewed the challenged records for segregability throughout the course of the litigation,\n\nreleasing to the plaintiff new copies of challenged records with fewer redactions when the CBP\n\nfiled its summary judgment motion, Gilman Decl. ¶ 12, and after the plaintiff filed her cross-\n\nmotion for summary judgment. Suppl. Wade Decl. ¶¶ 12–13. In sum, there is ample evidence\n\nthat CBP fulfilled its segregability obligation, which the plaintiff does not challenge in her briefs.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds that CBP has satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the\n\nchallenged records were examined and portions of the records were withheld only after\n\nconsidering whether CBP could disclose any “reasonably segregable portion[s]” of the records\n\npursuant to its obligation under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, CBP’s Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 32, is\n\nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part and the plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF\n\nNo. 35, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. CBP’s motion for summary judgment is\n\ngranted, as conceded, with respect to the redaction of emails under Exemption 5, the redaction of\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fRecord 24 in the Vaughn index under Exemption 7(E), the redaction of phone numbers or email\n\naddresses of landowners, the redaction of names and contact information of CBP employees or\n\nof individual employees of contractors, and the withholding of attachments to emails other than\n\nthe 289 emails challenged in this suit. CBP is further entitled to summary judgment on its\n\nwithholding of information under FOIA Exemption 7(E) and the non-production of email\n\nattachments for the 289 challenged emails. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on\n\nCBP’s withholding of information under FOIA Exemption 6. CBP shall release, by May 15,\n\n2014, to the plaintiff portions of the challenged email records that were previously withheld\n\nunder Exemption 6.\n\n\n                                                                  Digitally signed by Hon.

Pending\n\nbefore the Court are the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment regarding CBP’s\n\nproduction of email records in response to the plaintiff’s FOIA request, which response withheld\n\nlandowner names and addresses, under FOIA Exemption 6, and information related to CBP’s\n\nassessments of the need for fencing, under FOIA Exemption 7(E), and excluded email\n\nattachments from the records produced to the plaintiff.1 For the reasons explained below, CBP’s\n\nmotion is granted in part, with respect to portions of records withheld pursuant to FOIA\n\nExemption 7(E) and the exclusion of email attachments from production to the plaintiff, and\n\ndenied in part, as to its redaction of landowner names and addresses pursuant to FOIA\n\n1\n  The plaintiff has also named as defendants the Army Corps of Engineers (“ACE”) and the Department of\nHomeland Security (“DHS”), but has settled her claims with defendant ACE, which was dismissed as a party. See\nStip. Settlement Order Dismissal of ACE, ECF No. 24; see also Def.’s Mem. Supp. Def. CBP’s Mot. Summ. J.\nEmail Recs. (“Def.’s Mem.”) at 3. Although both DHS and CBP remain parties to the action, after DHS referred the\nrequest to CBP, see July 23, 2009, Joint Status Report (“7/23/09 JSR”) at 3, the parties agree that DHS is only\n“nominally a defendant . . .

BACKGROUND\n\n         A.       The Texas-Mexico Border Fence\n\n         In 2006, Congress passed the Secure Fence Act, ordering “construction of a fence or wall\n\nalong specific portions of the U.S.-Mexico border, including areas in Texas.” See Complaint\n\n(“Compl.”) ¶ 5, ECF No. 1 (citing Secure Fence Act, Pub. L. No. 109-367, § 3, 120 Stat. 2638\n\n(2006)). The Act was later amended to mandate “reinforced fencing along not less than 700\n\nmiles of the southwest border” and charged the Secretary of Homeland Security with completing\n\n370 miles of the reinforced fencing by the end of 2008. Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY\n\n2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, § 564, 121 Stat. 1844, 2090–91 (2007). The precise location of the\n\nfence, however, was left to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to determine\n\n“where fencing would be most practical and effective,” provided that DHS consult with, inter\n\nalia, “states, local governments, Indian tribes, and property owners . . . to minimize the impact”\n\non those living near the site of the future fence. Id.\n\n         B.       FOIA Requests\n\n         The plaintiff is a clinical professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Decl.\n\nDenise Gilman (“Gilman Decl.”) ¶ 1, ECF No. 35-1. In late 2007, the plaintiff spearheaded a\n\nworking group that focused on the human rights impact of the border fence by “conduct[ing]\n\nresearch and analysis of the legal, historical, property, environmental, indigenous, community,\n\nand other impacts of the border wall.” Id. ¶ 4–5. As part of that effort, the plaintiff submitted\n\nseveral FOIA requests to the CBP, DHS, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“ACE”). See\n\n2\n As of November 12, 2013, defendant CBP had completed production of all email and non-email records that it\nbelieved were responsive to the plaintiff’s request, and no challenge has been raised to the agency’s search. See\nNov. 12, 2013 Joint Status Report at 1–2, ECF No. 48; Def.’s Mem. at 1.\n\n                                                          2\n\fDef.’s Mem. Supp. Def. CBP’s Mot. Summ. J. Email Recs. (“Def.’s Mem.”) at 3, ECF No. 32.\n\nThe plaintiff’s request to CBP asked for: (1) “Maps of possible locations for segments of fence\n\nor wall along the Texas/Mexico border;” (2) “files including geographic coordinates . . . for\n\nsurveyed points along potential routes for segments of fence or wall along the Texas/Mexico\n\nborder;” (3) “Documents identifying the properties possibly affected by the construction of the\n\nborder fence or wall along the Texas/Mexico border, including documents that provide\n\ninformation regarding the ownership of the possibly affected properties and any other\n\ninformation about the characteristics of those properties;” (4) “Documents identifying the\n\nproperties for which the United States government has sought to obtain access through\n\nconsent/waiver or through litigation;” (5) “Documents reflecting appraisals of properties possibly\n\naffected by the construction of the border fence or wall along the Texas/Mexico border;” (6)\n\n“Documents reflecting surveys or other analyses of the areas possibly affected by the border\n\nfence or wall along the Texas/Mexico border;” (7) “Documents that describe the considerations\n\nor factors taken into account in making decisions regarding potential routes for segments of\n\nfence or wall along the Texas/Mexico border;” (8) “Communications received from, provided to\n\nor referenced by the Department of Homeland Security that make recommendations or\n\nsuggestions regarding the route for segments of fence or wall along the . . . Texas/Mexico\n\nBorder;” and (9) “Documents relating to potential or actual contracts for the execution of land\n\nsurveys or construction of segments of fence or wall along the Texas/Mexico border.” Gilman\n\nDecl. Ex. 2 at 18–19 (Plaintiff’s FOIA request to CBP dated April 11, 2008). Near-identical\n\nrequests were also sent to DHS and ACE. See Compl. ¶ 6.\n\n       DHS informed the plaintiff by letter that it referred her request to CBP “as the component\n\nof DHS likely to possess the records requested.” See July 23, 2009, Joint Status Report\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f(“7/23/09 JSR”) at 3, ECF No. 6. Before the plaintiff filed suit, she received from CBP two\n\nrecords, from ACE, 69 pages of records, and from DHS, no records. See Gilman Decl. ¶ 10;\n\nPl.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) at 4, ECF No. 35.\n\n       C.      FOIA LITIGATION\n\n       The plaintiff filed the instant action to compel the disclosure of responsive records, but\n\nsubsequently agreed with CBP to bifurcate the email production and non-email production of\n\nrecords. See 7/23/09 JSR at 2–3; see also July 27, 2009 Scheduling Order (“7/27/09 Sched.\n\nOrder”) ¶¶ 1–3, ECF No. 7. The parties submitted a joint status report informing the Court that\n\n“in the interest of expediting the release of e-mails to Plaintiff,” CBP could “satisfy Plaintiff’s\n\nFOIA request with respect to the processing of e-mails by providing to Plaintiff the e-mails as\n\nreleased in Crew v. DHS pursuant to the search described in the Joint Status Report and Proposed\n\nDisclosure Schedule . . . in that case.” See 7/23/09 JSR at 3 (citing Citizens for Responsibility &\n\nEthics in Wash. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. (“CREW”), No. 08-1046 (D.D.C. filed June 18,\n\n2008)). The parties further explained that CREW involved a search for emails “of the 25 CBP\n\nofficials most directly involved in the border fence placement division” and was scheduled to\n\nproduce “1,000 pages of e-mails per month” until there were no remaining responsive records.\n\nId. at 2–3. This was a “broader” search for records than that which the plaintiff had requested\n\nbecause the plaintiff in CREW sought records “for the entire Southwest border of the United\n\nStates instead of just the Texas-Mexico border.” Def.’s Mem. at 4–5. CBP was already\n\nprocessing email records in CREW, id. at 4, and the arrangement meant CBP “would not have to\n\nexpend its limited resources to search for, retrieve and process email records in response to\n\nPlaintiff’s FOIA request,” id. at 5, and “allowed Plaintiff to receive email records more\n\nexpeditiously than she otherwise would,” id. at 4. CBP agreed to release to the plaintiff “all e-\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fmails already released in CREW v. DHS” and to continue to provide the plaintiff with “further e-\n\nmails as they are released on a rolling basis in that case.” 7/23/09 JSR at 3. The Court\n\nsubsequently entered an order stating that “CBP will release to Plaintiff all email records already\n\nreleased in [CREW], and, going forward, CBP will release to Plaintiff on a rolling basis all e-\n\nmail records released in [CREW], on the same schedule as they are released in that case.”\n\n7/27/09 Sched. Order ¶ 2.\n\n       Two years after the plaintiff filed suit, CBP “completed or was near completion” of its\n\nproduction of records in both the CREW litigation and the instant case. Gilman Decl. ¶ 12. CBP\n\nwas ordered to produce any remaining responsive email records to the plaintiff within a month,\n\nsee March 28, 2011 Order, ECF No. 27, and the plaintiff was ordered to raise any disputes with\n\nthe claimed exemptions within 60 days. Id.; see also June 27, 2011 Joint Status Report\n\n(“6/27/2011 JSR”), ECF No. 28. In total, CBP “made 15 productions of email records . . .\n\nrepresenting all emails produced in the CREW v. DHS case.” Id. at 2 n.1. The plaintiff\n\n“identified for CBP the 289 emails with redactions and/or withholdings she is challenging,” Pl.’s\n\nMot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) at 5, and CBP agreed to conduct a further review of the\n\nchallenged records, 6/27/11 JSR at 3. The parties were aware when the 6/27/11 JSR was filed\n\nthat the plaintiff challenged “the fact that attachments were not part of the email production.” Id.\n\nCBP explained that it would satisfy its obligation to the plaintiff by releasing to her emails which\n\nwere identical to those released in CREW, “and, therefore, to the extent attachments were not\n\nincluded in the email release made in CREW v. DHS, they were not provided to Plaintiff.” Id.\n\nThis was contrary to the plaintiff’s understanding that, to the extent the CBP withheld portions of\n\nemails, the plaintiff would still be able to challenge those redactions. Id. In the plaintiff’s view,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fCBP’s non-production of attachments to responsive emails was a withholding without any\n\napplicable exemption that must therefore be disclosed.

In making the requisite balancing analysis here, the Court finds that\n\nCBP has failed to demonstrate that the public interest outweighs the landowners’ privacy\n\ninterest.\n\n        The plaintiff claims that the public interest is “significant” because it will “help the public\n\nunderstand the actual dimensions and location of the wall” as well as “allow the public to\n\nanalyze whether the government was treating property owners equally and fairly” or whether\n\nCBP built the wall in such a way that it disadvantaged “minority property owners.” Pl.’s Mem.\n\nat 10–11; see also Pl.’s Reply at 6 (“[T]he public has a significant interest in understanding\n\nwhich properties were affected by the placement of the wall, and how those property owners\n\nwere affected.”). CBP responds that the public interest in the disclosure of landowner names and\n\naddresses is “sharply limited,” Def.’s Mem. at 15, because “the names and contact information\n\nfor these individuals does not shed light on CBP’s operations or activities.” Def.’s Mem. at 17.\n\nCBP adds that information on the personal impact of the wall on individual landowners’ families\n\nis not a matter of public concern “but a personal issue unique to the particular landowner.”\n\nDef.’s Reply at 9.

It cites several cases for support, all of\n\nwhich are inapposite. CBP relies on U.S. Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for\n\nFreedom of the Press, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112224\"><a href=\"/opinion/112224/us-dept-of-justice-v-reporters-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 775 (1989), to support its contention that “[i]nformation\n\nthat does not directly reveal the operation or activities of the federal government ‘falls outside\n\nthe ambit of the public interest that the FOIA was enacted to serve.’” Def.’s Mem. at 15–16.\n\nMore precisely, the Supreme Court held that where the request sought only private information\n\nand would reveal no “official information” about a government agency, the invasion of privacy\n\nis” unwarranted. Id. at 780. Reporters Comm. Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. at 780. Based\n\nupon this holding, CBP makes the unremarkable observation that “even a modest privacy interest\n\noutweighs nothing every time.” Def.’s Mem. at 16 (citing Horner, 879 F.2d at 874–75). This\n\nholding does not, as CBP asserts, foreclose a request that indirectly reveals information about the\n\noperations of a government agency through the disclosure of private information. Contrary to\n\nCBP’s argument, the public interest in this case is significant and does not amount to “nothing.”\n\nId.\n\n       The D.C.

See 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(b)(6), 552(b)(7)(C). Consequently, “‘Exemption 7(C) is more\n\nprotective of privacy than Exemption 6’ and thus establishes a lower bar for withholding\n\nmaterial.” ACLU, 655 F.3d at 6 (citations omitted). In ACLU, an advocacy organization sought\n\nthe disclosure of docket numbers and names of defendants who had been the targets of\n\nwarrantless cell phone tracking. Id. at 12. The Circuit found that there was “more than a de\n\nminimis privacy interest,” but not “much more” because the information was already “readily\n\navailable to the public,” which “reduces . . . the incursion on privacy resulting from disclosure.”\n\nId. at 9, 12. The agency argued that despite the minimal private interest, disclosure was not\n\nrequired because the case names and docket numbers “standing alone generate no public\n\nbenefit.” Id. at 15. The Court disagreed, holding that the public benefit was “significant”\n\nbecause the requested information could be used derivatively in order to “shed light on\n\ngovernment conduct” on “a topic of considerable public interest.” Id. at 12. The information,\n\nwhen compiled, would “inform [an] ongoing public policy discussion by shedding light on the\n\nscope and effectiveness of cell phone tracking as a law enforcement tool.” Id. at 13. Even under\n\nthe more stringent 7(C) privacy protection standard, the Circuit held that this public interest\n\noutweighed the minimal privacy interest of the publicly available information, and ordered\n\ndisclosure of the withheld information. Id. at 16.\n\n       Similarly here, although the names and addresses of the land owners implicates a stronger\n\nprivacy interest than in ACLU because the information reveals more than just publicly available\n\ninformation, see Part III.A.1., supra, there is great public benefit to learning the social impact of\n\nCBP’s construction of the wall. Revealing the identities of landowners in the wall’s planned\n\nconstruction site may shed light on, inter alia, the impact on indigenous communities, the\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fdisparate impact on lower-income minority communities, and the practices of private\n\ncontractors. See Gilman Decl. ¶ 7. The information, after appropriate analysis, could reveal\n\nCBP’s decisionmaking and conduct as it relates to the Texas-Mexico border wall planning and\n\nconstruction, thus it helps the public “learn something directly about the workings of the\n\nGovernment.” Horner, 879 F.2d at 879 (emphasis in original).

Id.\n\n       Horner and Norton are consistent with the cases discussed above. While there was no\n\npublic benefit found in Horner, the Norton court identified a strong public interest, which\n\nwarranted the intrusion into the privacy interest identified and compelled the Circuit to order\n\ndisclosure. The sum of these cases establish that where the requester has articulated a legitimate\n\npublic interest in the information, courts have ordered disclosure of names and addresses, even if\n\nsuch information is associated with financial information, views held by the landowner, or would\n\nrisk unwanted contact.\n\n       Similarly here, as noted, the public interest in learning how CBP negotiated with private\n\ncitizens regarding the planning and construction of the border wall is significant. This public\n\ninterest outweighs the privacy interest in landowners’ names and addresses in CBP emails.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court holds that the public interest in disclosing\n\nthe names and addresses of landowners outweighs the implicated privacy interest and CBP’s\n\nwithholding of the information under Exemption 6 is improper.\n\n       B.      FOIA Exemption 7(E)\n\n       CBP has withheld under exemption 7(E) information relating to its assessment of the\n\nneed for fencing. Exemption 7(E) covers “records or information compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes” that “would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or\n\nprosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if\n\nsuch disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.” 5 U.S.C. §\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f552(b)(7)(E). The “requirement that disclosure risk circumvention of the law ‘sets a relatively\n\nlow bar for the agency to justify withholding.’” See Pub. Employees for Envtl.

Pl.’s Mem. at 20.\n\nThe Court disagrees. As the D.C. Circuit recently pointed out, “Law enforcement entails more\n\nthan just investigating and prosecuting individuals after a violation of the law . . . the ordinary\n\nunderstanding of law enforcement includes . . . proactive steps designed to prevent criminal\n\nactivity and to maintain security.’” See Pub. Empls. for Envtl. Responsibility, 740 F.3d at 203\n\n(citing Milner, 131 S.Ct. at 1272 (Alito, J., concurring)). This Circuit has long employed a two-\n\npart test, first set forth in Pratt v. Webster, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1982), to determine whether\n\nrecords are law enforcement records. Id. A record is used for law enforcement where: “the\n\ninvestigatory activity that gave rise to the documents is ‘related to the enforcement of federal\n\nlaws,’ and there is a rational nexus between the investigation at issue and the agency’s law\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fenforcement duties.” Tax Analysts v. IRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778068\"><a href=\"/opinion/778068/tax-analysts-v-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 78 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing Pratt, 673\n\nF.2d at 420–21). Moreover, courts are “more deferential to the agency’s claimed purpose for the\n\nparticular records” where “the agency’s principal function is law enforcement.” Pub-Employees\n\nfor Envtl. Responsibility, 740 F.3d at 203 (quoting Tax Analysts, 294 F.3d at 77).\n\n       Here, CBP is indisputably a law enforcement agency and is entitled to deference in its\n\ndetermination that the records were compiled for a law enforcement purpose. CBP contends that\n\nthe challenged redactions relate to its “risk and vulnerabilities assessment of illicit cross-border\n\nactivity in order to assess fencing needs,” which includes information such as “terrain,\n\nfloodplain, waterways . . . migration patterns,” as well as “areas that are difficult for Border\n\nPatrol to access” and “areas patrolled by fewer agents, and urban areas where illegal traffic has a\n\ngreater chance of blending in quickly without being apprehended.” Wade Decl. ¶ 15. This\n\ninformation “inform[s CBP’s] decisions relating to fence placement.” Suppl. Wade Decl. ¶ 18.\n\nFurthermore, some emails “contain references to specific Border Patrol Station ‘border zones,’”\n\nwhich are designations used internally for assignment coverage, and knowledge of these border\n\nzones could be used to parse law enforcement radio discussions referencing them. Wade Decl. ¶\n\n15. CBP contends that “release of this information would essentially provide a ‘roadmap’ to\n\nthose attempting to cross the border.” Wade Decl. ¶ 15.\n\n       CBP’s declarations sufficiently demonstrate that the redacted information is related to the\n\nenforcement of federal laws, as the assessment of border vulnerabilities is directly related to the\n\npotential violation of federal immigration laws and the CBP’s duty to deter illegal immigration\n\nand to apprehend illegal immigrants. See Tax Analysts, 294 F.3d at 78. Thus, the CBP has\n\ndemonstrated that the records were created for a law enforcement purpose.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\f       Second, the plaintiff asserts that Exemption 7(E) does not apply because the CBP has not\n\nshown that the challenged emails qualify as “techniques, procedures, or guidelines.” Pl.’s Mem.\n\nat 19 (citing Wade Decl. ¶ 15). According to the plaintiff, the challenged emails “contain\n\n‘assessments of the operational need for fencing,’ not information relating to investigations or\n\nprosecutions.” Id. The plaintiff’s interpretation of the statutory language is overly restrictive.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit has held that “an agency may seek to block the disclosure of internal agency\n\nmaterials relating to guidelines, techniques, sources, and procedures for law enforcement\n\ninvestigations and prosecutions, even when the materials have not been compiled in the course of\n\na specific investigation.” Tax Analysts, 294 F.3d at 79. Even if withheld documents “are not\n\n‘how-to’ manuals for law-breakers, the exemption is broader than that.” See Mayer Brown, 562\n\nF.3d at 1192–93. “Information that relates to law enforcement techniques, policies, and\n\nprocedures is properly withheld under this exemption.” Showing Animals Respect & Kindness v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Interior, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2474642\"><a href=\"/opinion/2474642/showing-animals-respect-and-kindness-v-us-doi/\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Circuit held that records relating to “settlement strategies and\n\nobjectives, assessments of litigating hazards, [and] acceptable ranges of percentages for\n\nsettlement” were exempt under 7(E) because, although not a “blueprint for tax shelter schemes, it\n\ncould encourage decisions to violate the law or evade punishment.” Mayer Brown, 562 F.3d at\n\n1192–93 (citing Mayer Brown LLP v. IRS, No. 04–2187, slip op. at 3 (D.D.C. Nov. 28, 2006)).\n\nHere, although the information in the challenged records are not styled as formal guidelines or\n\nprocedures for CBP officials, the records refer to information, including how CBP officials\n\nassess vulnerable areas along the border, that could be used to “encourage decisions to violate\n\nthe law or evade punishment.” Id. at 1193; see also Showing Animals Respect & Kindness, 730\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fF. Supp. 2d at 199–200 (finding that files revealing “specific details of surveillance techniques,\n\nincluding equipment used and location and timing of use,” was exempt under 7(E) because it\n\n“could compromise [the agency’s] ability to conduct future investigations”); Strunk v.

Accordingly, while the emails in question do not reveal\n\nformal guidelines, CBP has demonstrated that the information contained in the emails could be\n\nused in the same manner as a “technique, procedure, or guideline.”\n\n         Finally, the plaintiff claims that CBP has not “logically shown that release of the records\n\ncould be reasonably expected to risk circumvention of the law.” Pl.’s Mem. at 19.5 In the\n\nplaintiff’s view, details “such as terrain and geographic location are identifiable by sight,” and\n\ntherefore the challenged records will not add to criminals’ knowledge of the conditions along the\n\nborder wall. Id. at 19–20. The plaintiff argues further that since “Border Patrol operations may\n\nhave changed” since the emails were drafted, Pl.’s Mem. at 20, the information no longer\n\n“provide[s] a roadmap of where it would currently be best to cross the border,” and, thus, does\n\nnot risk circumvention of the law. Pl.’s Reply at 11. The Court disagrees.\n\n\n5\n  “[C]ourts have disagreed over whether” the qualifying clause requiring that disclosure “reasonably be expected to\nrisk circumvention of the law,” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E), applies to “techniques and procedures for law enforcement\ninvestigations or prosecutions.” Pub. Empls. for Envtl. Responsibility, 740 F.3d at 205 n.4. This Circuit has applied\nthe qualifying clause to “techniques and procedures,” id. (citing Blackwell, 646 F.3d at 41–42), but “given the low\nbar posed by the ‘risk circumvention of the law’ requirement, it is not clear that the difference matters much in\npractice.” Id. CBP argues that the final clause does not apply to “techniques and procedures,” and that the\nexemption thus “afford[s] ‘categorical protection’” for techniques and procedures. See Def.’s Mem. at 20 (citing\nSmith v.

As discussed below,\nCBP has demonstrated through its declarations that disclosure “could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention\nof the law.” Thus the exemption is applicable in any event and the Court need not decide the scope of the qualifying\nclause of Exemption 7(E).\n\n                                                         27\n\f       Although some geological factors may be readily identifiable by sight or through publicly\n\navailable information, CBP has also attested that the emails reveal “areas that are difficult for\n\nBorder Patrol to access” and “areas patrolled by fewer agents.” Wade Decl. ¶ 15. Such\n\ninformation discloses the CBP’s operations and vulnerabilities, which are not readily-accessible\n\npublic information, the disclosure of which could risk appropriation to circumvent the law. See\n\nShowing Animals Respect & Kindness, 730 F. Supp. 2d at 200 (finding that documents detailing\n\nsurveillance techniques logically risked circumvention of the law because, “although trespassers\n\nand poachers . . . likely know that they are subject to surveillance, the details of the surveillance\n\ntechniques are unknown to them”); Blanton v.

Moreover,\n\nthe discussion of publicly available information, itself, reveals what information CBP considers\n\nwhen analyzing its vulnerabilities at the border, and this analysis, itself, is not publicly known\n\nand may risk circumvention of the law. See Blackwell, 646 F.3d at 42 (manner in which FBI\n\ndata is “searched, organized, and reported to the FBI is an internal technique, not known to the\n\npublic” therefore is subject to exemption 7(E)).

See Pl.’s Mem. at 20; Pl.’s Reply at 11. Here,\n\nCBP has submitted two declarations declaring that release of this information would aid those\n\nattempting to cross the border as well as “smugglers and criminal elements” in their\n\ndetermination of CBP’s vulnerabilities along the border.

In FOIA cases, agency declarations are viewed with “a presumption of good faith,”\n\nGround Saucer Watch v.

Cir. 1981), and since the plaintiff has\n\npresented no counter-evidence and no evidence of the agency’s bad faith in its declarations, the\n\nCourt finds that CBP has shown that the challenged withholding under Exemption 7(E) would\n\nrisk circumvention of the law. Id.\n\n       The plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence contradicting the CBP’s contention\n\nthat the redacted information falls under Exemption 7(E) as techniques or procedures that are\n\nreasonably shown to risk circumvention of the law. Accordingly, the Court finds that CBP has\n\nshown that the challenged withholdings detailing the operational need to determine fencing are\n\nappropriately withheld under FOIA exemption 7(E).\n\n       C.        Email Attachments\n\n       The plaintiff and CBP dispute whether CBP is improperly withholding the attachments to\n\nresponsive emails pursuant to the parties’ agreement to limit the scope of CBP’s production of\n\nemails. The crux of the parties’ dispute is the interpretation of the language of their joint status\n\nreport, which embodies the parties’ agreement on the scope of the agency’s obligations in\n\nfulfilling the plaintiff’s FOIA request. See generally 7/23/09 JSR. As described below, the plain\n\nmeaning of the parties’ joint status report and the language of this Court’s order ratifying the\n\nparties’ agreement make it apparent that CBP was only obliged to produce to the plaintiff the\n\nsame records that CBP produced in the CREW litigation.\n\n       The parties fundamentally disagree over the terms of the agreement governing the CBP’s\n\nproduction of records to the plaintiff. The parties submitted a joint status report to the Court\n\nadvising that:\n\n       [I]n the interest of expediting the release of emails to Plaintiff, CBP may satisfy\n       Plaintiff’s FOIA request with respect to the processing of emails by providing to\n\n                                                 29\n\f       Plaintiff the emails as released in CREW v. DHS pursuant to the search described\n       in the Joint Status Report and Proposed Disclosure Schedule . . . in that case as\n       follows: (1) by providing Plaintiff, within 30 days of the entry of the\n       accompanying order, all emails already released in CREW v. DHS and (2) going\n       forward, by providing Plaintiff further emails as they are released on a rolling\n       basis in that case.\n\n7/23/09 JSR at 3 (emphasis added). The Court entered a Scheduling Order effectuating this\n\nagreement based on the proposed order submitted by the parties with their joint status report.\n\nSee Proposed Order ¶ 2, ECF No. 6-1; 7/27/09 Sched. Order ¶ 2; Def.’s Reply at 21 n.6. The\n\nOrder required CBP to, inter alia, “release to Plaintiff all email records already released in\n\n[CREW], and, going forward, CBP will release to Plaintiff on a rolling basis all email records\n\nreleased in CREW v. DHS, on the same schedule as they are released in that case.” See 7/27/09\n\nSched. Order ¶ 2.\n\n       Both parties construe the phrase “as released” in the joint status report to impose different\n\nrequirements on CBP with respect to the production of records. CBP contends that this wording\n\nlimits the scope of the plaintiff’s FOIA request and reflects the parties’ agreement that CBP\n\nwould only produce to the plaintiff the documents that were “actually released in CREW and\n\nnothing else” and that “any email related records not released in CREW because the parties in\n\nCREW did not consider them to be responsive were . . . not responsive to Plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequest.” See Def.’s Reply at 23. Thus, CBP contends that it satisfied its FOIA obligation to the\n\nplaintiff by “undertak[ing] the administrative act of forwarding emails released in CREW to\n\nPlaintiff.” Def.’s Reply at 21.\n\n       The plaintiff responds that CBP’s agreement to produce documents “as released” in\n\nCREW refers merely to the timing of the release of the records. Pl.’s Mem. at 22. The plaintiff\n\nasserts that under the agreement, CBP agreed to release the documents to the plaintiff according\n\nto the scheduled release of documents in CREW. Id. The plaintiff further explains that the\n\n                                                 30\n\flanguage of the joint status report stating that CBP would release records “pursuant to the search\n\ndescribed” in CREW, indicates that the parties agreed to limit the “scope of the search for\n\nrecords” only, and not the scope of the documents that CBP was obliged to produce. Id. at 21\n\n(emphasis added). The plaintiff reasons that the agreement relieved CBP of “retrieving and\n\nprocessing additional records,” but did not permit CBP to withhold portions of records that were\n\ndeemed responsive, even if these portions of records were not released to the plaintiff in CREW.\n\nPl.’s Reply at 12 (emphasis in original). Consequently, the plaintiff claims that CBP is\n\nimproperly withholding the attachments to the responsive emails because the attachments are a\n\n“portion of the records.” Pl.’s Mem. at 21.\n\n       The plain meaning of the joint status report makes clear that the plaintiff narrowed her\n\nFOIA request to require CBP to produce only emails that the CBP actually produced to the\n\nCREW plaintiff “on a rolling basis in that case.” 7/23/09 JSR at 3. The phrase “as released”\n\nplainly refers to the records actually released to the plaintiff in CREW, rather than the timing of\n\nthe releases, as the plaintiff contends. Thus, CBP is correct that it “may satisfy Plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequest” by providing the plaintiff the same emails that the CBP produced in CREW. The\n\nattachments, therefore, are not being withheld, but, as memorialized by the parties’ joint status\n\nreport, are not responsive to the plaintiff’s amended FOIA request.\n\n       Even if the joint status report were ambiguous on this point, the Court’s subsequent\n\nScheduling Order based on the parties’ proposed order supports CBP’s interpretation of the joint\n\nstatus report. See Act Now to Stop War & End Racism Coal. v. D.C., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129\n\n(D.D.C. 2012) (explaining that scheduling orders “should be read as being specific and\n\ncomprehensive” and that “[w]hen an Order details the scope of permissible discovery, a party\n\nshould not read into the gaps permission to propound whatever discovery it so wishes”). The\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fOrder states that CBP “will release to Plaintiff on a rolling basis all email records released in\n\nCREW, on the same schedule as they are released in that case.” 7/27/09 Sched. Order ¶ 2. The\n\nOrder clarifies CBP’s two separate obligations: the first phrase requires CBP to release to the\n\nplaintiff the same records “released” in CREW, while the latter phrase requires that CBP release\n\nthe responsive email records to the plaintiff at the same time that the records are released to the\n\nplaintiff in CREW. See Pl.’s Mem. at 21–25; Def.’s Mem. 4–9. The plain meaning of both the\n\nparties’ joint status report and this Court’s subsequent Order are clear that CBP had to release to\n\nthe plaintiff the same records released in CREW at the same time that they were released in\n\nCREW. The plaintiff’s post hoc effort to re-write the agreement with CBP as limiting her FOIA\n\nrequest only to the same search conducted but not the same production as in CREW is simply not\n\nsustainable. The agreement limited both CBP’s search and production obligation to the agency’s\n\nefforts in CREW. Thus, contrary to the plaintiff’s contention, the responsive documents to which\n\nthe plaintiff is entitled are defined both by the search conducted by CBP, and also by the\n\ndocuments actually produced in CREW. Since the email attachments were not actually produced\n\nin CREW because they were deemed nonresponsive, they correspondingly need not be produced\n\nto the plaintiff.6\n\n        The plaintiff argues that the Order ratifies her interpretation of the language of the joint\n\nstatus report because it omits the phrase “as released” from the Order. Pl.’s Mem. at 22; see\n\n7/27/09 Sched. Order ¶ 2 (requiring that “going forward, CBP will release to Plaintiff on a\n\nrolling basis all email records released in CREW v. DHS”). The omission of this phrase in the\n\n\n\n6\n  CBP further argues that the challenged email attachments are not required to be disclosed, first, because the\nplaintiff did not challenge the withholding of the email attachments while CBP was making its rolling productions,\nDef.’s Mem. at 8 (“It was not until late May 2011—nearly 21 months after the first release of email records—that\nPlaintiff first raised any issue regarding the lack of attachments to the emails released in CREW”), and, second,\nbecause producing the attachments would frustrate the parties’ purpose of expediting disclosure, id. at 8–9. Since\nthe Court finds in CBP’s favor, the Court need not address these arguments.\n\n                                                        32\n\fOrder does not support the plaintiff’s interpretation. Indeed, the language of the Order lends\n\nstronger support to CBP’s claim because the Order states, in two separate clauses, that (1) CBP\n\nmust “release to Plaintiff all email records already released in [CREW]” and that they must\n\ncontinue to release to the plaintiff “on a rolling basis all email records released in” CREW, and\n\n(2) this production must occur “on the same schedule as they are released in that case.” 7/27/09\n\nSched. Order ¶ 2. See also Def.’s Reply at 21 n.6. The schedule on which CBP was required to\n\nrelease records to the plaintiff is set out in the second clause and was thus a separate requirement\n\nfrom the scope of the responsive records set out in the first clause. The plaintiff’s interpretation\n\nconflates both clauses to refer to the timing of the releases, but this is inconsistent with the canon\n\nof statutory interpretation against surplusage. Courts have used canons of statutory interpretation\n\nto clarify court orders.

In short, the inclusion in the Order of the second clause requiring CBP to release\n\nthe emails “on the same schedule as they are released in that case,” is the relevant phrase to\n\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fcontrol the timing of disclosure, while the scope of the responsive records is defined by the\n\nrecords released in CREW. 7/27/09 Sched.

Nevertheless, for the\n\npurposes of the plaintiff’s present FOIA request, as narrowed pursuant to the parties’ joint status\n\nreport and this Court’s Order, this Court holds that CBP is not required to produce the email\n\nattachments of responsive records to the plaintiff.\n\n       D.

The plaintiff has not challenged CBP’s failure to release all reasonably\n\nsegregable information to the plaintiff pursuant to its obligation to do so under the FOIA.

Therefore, although “agencies should not be forced\n\nto provide such a detailed justification that would itself compromise the secret nature of\n\npotentially exempt information,” agencies “must be required to provide the reasons behind their\n\nconclusions in order that they may be challenged by FOIA plaintiffs and reviewed by the courts.”\n\nId.\n\n       To this end, the Circuit has said that “[i]n addition to a statement of its reasons, an agency\n\nshould also describe what proportion of the information in a document is non-exempt and how\n\nthat material is dispersed throughout the document.” Id. Under Mead Data, if a small\n\nproportion of the information is non-exempt, the agency’s explanatory burden is less, and if a\n\nlarger proportion of the information is non-exempt, “the courts should require a high standard of\n\nproof for an agency claim that the burden of separation justifies nondisclosure or that disclosure\n\nof the non-exempt material would indirectly reveal the exempt information.” Id. Since Mead\n\nData, the Circuit has relaxed this standard, holding that “[a]gencies are entitled to a presumption\n\nthat they complied with the obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material,” which must\n\nbe overcome by some “quantum of evidence” by the requester.

Cir. 2002) (upholding agency’s segregation\n\nefforts based on “comprehensive Vaughn index” and “the affidavits of” agency officials).\n\n       In the instant case, CBP has provided the plaintiff with a Vaughn index of the 289\n\nchallenged records listing the justification for withholding information. See Wade Decl. at 15.\n\nCBP has also submitted two declarations by David E. Wade, the Operations Officer with the\n\nOffice of Border Patrol within the Department of Homeland Security, which attest that CBP “has\n\nprocessed and released all reasonably segregable information within the disputed email\n\ndocuments” after “carefully evaluat[ing] each email document.” Wade Decl. ¶ 16. Moreover,\n\nCBP reviewed the challenged records for segregability throughout the course of the litigation,\n\nreleasing to the plaintiff new copies of challenged records with fewer redactions when the CBP\n\nfiled its summary judgment motion, Gilman Decl. ¶ 12, and after the plaintiff filed her cross-\n\nmotion for summary judgment. Suppl. Wade Decl. ¶¶ 12–13. In sum, there is ample evidence\n\nthat CBP fulfilled its segregability obligation, which the plaintiff does not challenge in her briefs.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds that CBP has satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the\n\nchallenged records were examined and portions of the records were withheld only after\n\nconsidering whether CBP could disclose any “reasonably segregable portion[s]” of the records\n\npursuant to its obligation under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, CBP’s Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 32, is\n\nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part and the plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF\n\nNo. 35, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. CBP’s motion for summary judgment is\n\ngranted, as conceded, with respect to the redaction of emails under Exemption 5, the redaction of\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fRecord 24 in the Vaughn index under Exemption 7(E), the redaction of phone numbers or email\n\naddresses of landowners, the redaction of names and contact information of CBP employees or\n\nof individual employees of contractors, and the withholding of attachments to emails other than\n\nthe 289 emails challenged in this suit. CBP is further entitled to summary judgment on its\n\nwithholding of information under FOIA Exemption 7(E) and the non-production of email\n\nattachments for the 289 challenged emails. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on\n\nCBP’s withholding of information under FOIA Exemption 6. CBP shall release, by May 15,\n\n2014, to the plaintiff portions of the challenged email records that were previously withheld\n\nunder Exemption 6.\n\n\n                                                                  Digitally signed by Hon.
