West Feliciana Parish School Bd., 396 U.S. 290, 90 S.Ct. 608, 24 L.Ed.2d 477 (1970); Alexander v. Holmes County Bd. of Ed., 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19 (1969); Stanley v. Darlington County School District, 424 F.2d 195 (4th Cir.), cert. denied 398 U.S. 909, 90 S.Ct. 1690, 26 L.Ed.2d 67 (1970); and Nesbit v. Statesville City Bd. of Ed., 418 F.2d 1040 (4th Cir. 1969). The need for immediate consideration of new plans for the operation of the districts' schools in September 1970 prompts disposition of the appeals by this order. The members of the court reserve the right to express their individual views in subsequent opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Franklin, Virginia, operates four schools. A freedom of choice plan adopted in 1965 has not succeeded in eliminating a dual system composed of a separate high school and a separate elementary school for each race. The district court approved a new plan submitted by the board in 1969, which would assign some black pupils to the two white schools, but otherwise would retain freedom of choice. The board planned to pair its high schools in 1971.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Southampton County operates one white and one black elementary school in each of the county's seven magisterial districts. It also has one white and one black high school located about a mile apart. Freedom of choice, in effect since 1965, has not eliminated dual schools. In 1969, the board proposed and the court approved, a plan that would assign some black pupils to white elementary schools. The plan designates the black high school for vocational training and the white high school for college preparation. The testimony of the Superintendent of Schools indicated, however, that no white pupils could be expected to choose the black high school under this arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court based its approval in part on testimony that it is educationally beneficial to have a majority of white pupils in mixed schools. In Franklin and Southampton, this method of assignment will leave a number of black pupils in completely segregated black schools. Although a definite ratio of white to black pupils might be desirable under certain circumstances, adherence to the quota that is proposed in these cases cannot be allowed to perpetuate segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Covington v. United States, No. 14,277, intervenors in the Southampton case urge that the Ninth Amendment justifies the continuation of freedom of choice for the assignment of pupils. This argument, we believe, however, has been foreclosed by Green v. County School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968), which holds that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the continuation of freedom of choice plans that fail to eliminate racially dual school systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.
