Sippel, United States District Judge for the Eastern and\nWestern Districts of Missouri, sitting by designation.\n\f       Carl Avery, through his mother Dorothy London, appeals the District Court's2\njudgment against him. Avery claims that the District Court erred in three respects: (1)\nin holding that defendant Jeff Rader did not violate Avery's substantive-due-process\nrights; (2) in holding there were no procedural-due-process violations in Avery's\nsuspension or in his expulsion; and (3) in not ordering the DeWitt School System to\nsubmit a remedial plan concerning discrimination in hiring. We affirm the judgment of\nthe District Court. We hold, in particular, that the school officials' conduct in the\ncourse of a physical confrontation with the plaintiff, a 13-year-old student, was not so\negregious or unconscionable as to shock the judicial conscience. In reaching this\nconclusion, we are mindful that effective discipline and order in the schools are vital\nto the educational process.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      On the morning of January 8, 1997, Jeff Rader, a teacher and coach at the\nDeWitt Middle School, entered the school cafeteria and saw two students, Carl Avery\nand Richard Foster, engaged in an activity that the District Court characterized as\n\"horseplay\" or \"scuffling.\" Coach Rader told Avery and Foster to leave the cafeteria.\nFoster followed Coach Rader's directive. However, Avery told Coach Rader that he\nwas going to eat his breakfast. Coach Rader again told Avery to leave the cafeteria.\nAvery then said he was going to get his books.\n\n       At this point, Coach Rader placed his hands on Avery and began to remove him\nfrom the cafeteria by force. Although the District Court was not clear on the precise\nchronology, it is undisputed that Avery fought back. Avery stated at a subsequent\ndisciplinary hearing that he \"slammed\" Coach Rader into the table. During the course\n\n\n      2\n        The Honorable Susan Webber Wright, Chief Judge, United States District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Arkansas.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fof this encounter, Coach Rader dragged Avery on the floor for approximately fifteen\nfeet and then banged Avery's head against a metal pole outside the cafeteria. At trial,\nalthough Avery claimed he had sustained a head injury, he was unsure which side of\nhis head had been hurt.\n\n       Coach Rader and Avery proceeded to Principal Tim Walton's office. Once\ninside, Principal Walton asked Avery what happened. Avery testified at trial that he\nattempted to tell his side of the story, but was told to \"shut up\" by Principal Walton\nwhen Coach Rader interjected his version. The District Court found that at some point,\nafter unsuccessfully trying to leave, a frustrated Avery stood up and tried to speak.\nPrincipal Walton either put his hands up, indicating that he wanted Avery to stop, or\nplaced his hands on the collar of Avery's coat. Avery struck both of Principal Walton's\narms. Principal Walton then called the police.\n\n        Immediately prior to the meeting in his office, Principal Walton had called\nAvery's mother, Dorothy London, and informed her she needed to come to school\nbecause of a problem with her son. Ms. London arrived at the school shortly after the\npolice. Principal Walton explained the situation to Ms. London, and informed her he\nwould be recommending that her son be expelled.\n\n       Six days later, Principal Walton sent a letter to Ms. London detailing the\nincident, and informed her that Avery had been suspended for ten days. The letter\nstated that Principal Walton intended to recommend that Avery be expelled for the\nremainder of the school year. This letter further stated that Ms. London could request\na hearing before the Board of Directors if she so desired, and at that meeting Avery had\na right to be represented by his parents, a lay representative, or an attorney.\n\n      The next day, James Emerson, the Superintendent of the DeWitt School District,\nwrote a letter to Ms. London. In this letter, he informed Ms. London of his agreement\nwith Principal Walton's decision to expel Avery for the remainder of the school year.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fThis letter also informed Ms. London that she could request a hearing before the Board\nof Education, and explained to her the procedures for doing so.\n\n       A hearing was held on January 22, 1997, before the DeWitt School Board to\nconsider the expulsion recommendation. Avery was represented at this hearing by\nattorney John Walker. Mr. Walker, pursuant to district rules, requested disclosure of\nstatements given by Coach Rader and Principal Walton. However, Mr. Walker did not\nreceive these statements until after Rader and Walton had testified. The District Court\nreviewed the audiotapes of the hearing, and found that Mr. Walker was allowed to\nquestion all witnesses against Avery, was not limited in types of questions he could\nask, and was allowed to respond to all of the allegations and testimony presented in\nsupport of the recommendation of expulsion. At the conclusion of the hearing, the\nschool board voted to expel Avery for the remainder of the school year.\n\n       Dorothy London filed this lawsuit against Superintendent James Emerson,\nPrincipal Tim Walton, Jeff Rader, and the Board of Directors of the DeWitt School\nDistrict. After a two-day bench trial, and at the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, the\nDistrict Court granted defendants' motion for judgment on partial findings pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(c). Dorothy London now appeals that judgment.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      The plaintiff argues that the factual findings of the District Court, supplemented\nby other portions of the record, make out a substantive-due-process violation under the\nstandard articulated by this Court in Wise v. Pea Ridge School District, 855 F.2d 560,\n564 (8th Cir. 1988). We disagree.\n\n      The District Court held that Coach Rader did not violate Avery's substantive-\ndue-process rights. The Court supported its holding by making certain factual findings\nfrom the record. The Court found that Avery twice refused Rader's directive to leave\n\n                                          -4-\n\fthe cafeteria, and that Avery fought back and \"slammed\" Rader into a table when Rader\nattempted to remove him from the cafeteria. Moreover, the District Court was \"unable\nto find that . . . his [Coach Rader's] actions were motivated by bad faith or ill-will.\"\n\n      We review the District Court's Rule 52(c) factual findings for clear error. See\nGeddes v. Northwest Missouri State University, 49 F.3d 426, 429 n.7 (8th Cir. 1995).\nOur review of the record convinces us that the District Court's factual findings had\nsubstantial support in the record and are not clearly erroneous. Even if we supplement\nthe District Court's factual findings with other parts of the record, as plaintiff requests,\nCoach Rader's conduct did not constitute a substantive-due-process violation under\nWise.\n\n       The first Wise factor is the need for application of corporal punishment. Carl\nAvery twice disobeyed Coach Rader. His first statement that he was going to eat his\nbreakfast is inconsistent with an intent to follow Coach Rader's directives. When he\nwas again told to leave the cafeteria, he again disobeyed, stating that he was going to\nget his books. Although Coach Rader could have allowed Avery to get his books and\nthen leave, we give school administrators substantial deference in matters such as\nstudent discipline and maintaining order. See Peterson v. Ind. School District No. 811,\n999 F. Supp. 665, 673 (D. Minn. 1998).\n\n       The second Wise factor is the relationship between the need and amount of\npunishment administered. Plaintiff argues that by physically removing Avery from the\ncafeteria and banging his head against a pole, Coach Rader used an unreasonable\namount of force. However, Avery was \"mouthing off\" to the coach and was involved\nin a physical altercation with him. We cannot find that Coach Rader's use of force was\nsufficiently excessive to approach a substantive-due-process violation.\n\n      The third Wise factor is the extent of the injury inflicted. We assume that Avery\nreceived a bump on his head, but the severity of the injury is questionable in light of the\n\n                                            -5-\n\ffact that Avery was unable to recall at trial which side of his head he had a bump on.\n\n       The fourth Wise factor is whether the punishment was administered in a good\nfaith effort to maintain discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose\nof causing harm. Here, the District Court was unable to find Rader's actions motivated\nby bad faith or ill-will, and this view of the facts is not clearly erroneous.\n\n      Taken as a whole, we agree with the District Court that Coach Rader's actions\nwere not shocking to the conscience, see Wise, supra, 855 F.3d at 565. This is not the\nkind of truly egregious and extraordinary case for which the theory of substantive due\nprocess is properly reserved.\n\n                                          III.\n\n       The plaintiff next argues that the District Court erred in holding that the\nsuspension and expulsion did not violate Avery's procedural-due-process rights. With\nrespect to the suspension, the District Court made the factual finding that Avery was\napprised of the charges against him and was given an opportunity to present his side\nof the case in Principal Walton's office the day of the incident. This finding has\nadequate support in the record, and is not clearly erroneous. The facts on which the\nsuspension was based occurred in the Principal's immediate presence. The situation is\nlike that of a direct contempt, in which someone misbehaves himself in open court. The\nPrincipal's suspension of the plaintiff was not procedurally defective.\n\n      With regard to the expulsion, the plaintiff was fully informed of the grounds upon\nwhich the expulsion recommendation was based, and her son was given a hearing\nwhere he was represented by counsel who had full opportunity to examine and cross-\nexamine witnesses. It is true that the school district violated its own rules by not\nsupplying plaintiff's counsel with the statements of two witnesses in advance of the\nhearing. This violation is not to be condoned, but it does not automatically amount to\n\n                                          -6-\n\fa violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Significantly, plaintiff does not indicate\nanything in particular that his lawyer would have done differently if the statements had\nbeen provided on time.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n      Plaintiff's last argument is that the DeWitt School District discriminates with\nrespect to staffing in its schools. This is a free-standing claim, which could be brought\neven in the absence of the plaintiff's other disciplinary-related claims.\n\n       The Supreme Court has held that where plaintiffs prove a current condition of\nsegregated schooling within a school district where a dual system was once compelled\nby law, the State has an affirmative duty to eliminate all vestiges of state-imposed\nsegregation. See Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 200 (1973). Therefore,\nwhen a plaintiff can show both prior de jure discrimination and currently segregated\nschools, there is a presumption that current disparities are the result of the defendant's\nprior unconstitutional conduct. See Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 443 U.S.\n526, 537-38 (1979). The burden then shifts to the defendant to prove otherwise. The\nSupreme Court has identified several areas of schools where a dual system can be\nshown, including but not limited to student body composition, faculty, staff,\ntransportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities. See Green v. County School\nBoard of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 435 (1968).\n\n       Arkansas once required its school districts to operate racially segregated\nsystems. Raney v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 443 (1968). But the plaintiff has not,\non this record, made a sufficient showing of current segregation. All the plaintiff has\noffered as evidence is a statistical imbalance in the faculty of the DeWitt School\nsystem, plus a lack of affirmative effort to recruit black applicants for faculty positions.\nThis is not enough to shift the burden to defendants and create a presumption of\nunlawful intent.\n\n                                            -7-\n\f       Plaintiff touches upon only one of the Green factors (staffing). Given the\npassage of time since state-mandated segregated schooling ceased, there are simply too\nmany other possible explanations that could plausibly explain these statistical\ndisparities. See Jenkins v. State of Missouri, 122 F.3d 588, 595 (8th Cir. 1997)\n(passage of time is evidentiary consideration in determination of shifting burden).\nFinally, although this plaintiff does have standing to litigate this issue, in the context of\nthis case this claim seems to come as an afterthought in what is essentially a dispute\nover an individual disciplinary action.\n\n       In our opinion, the plaintiff has not shown enough to warrant a full-blown inquiry\ninto the hiring practices of the DeWitt School system. We hold against plaintiff on this\nclaim, but do so without prejudice to the right of any proper party to make a fuller\nshowing.\n\n                                             V.\n\n       As a final matter, plaintiff asks this Court to reinstate her supplemental state-law\nclaims. We affirm the District Court's decision to decline to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction. These claims are dismissed without prejudice.\n\n       For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n       A true copy.\n\n              Attest:\n\n                      CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\f",

Dorothy London now appeals that judgment.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      The plaintiff argues that the factual findings of the District Court, supplemented\nby other portions of the record, make out a substantive-due-process violation under the\nstandard articulated by this Court in Wise v. Pea Ridge School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510717\"><a href=\"/opinion/510717/daniel-wise-v-pea-ridge-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n564 (8th Cir. 1988). We disagree.\n\n      The District Court held that Coach Rader did not violate Avery's substantive-\ndue-process rights. The Court supported its holding by making certain factual findings\nfrom the record. The Court found that Avery twice refused Rader's directive to leave\n\n                                          -4-\n\fthe cafeteria, and that Avery fought back and \"slammed\" Rader into a table when Rader\nattempted to remove him from the cafeteria. Moreover, the District Court was \"unable\nto find that . . . his [Coach Rader's] actions were motivated by bad faith or ill-will.\"\n\n      We review the District Court's Rule 52(c) factual findings for clear error. See\nGeddes v. Northwest Missouri State University, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691096\"><a href=\"/opinion/691096/ladonna-geddes-v-northwest-missouri-state-university-dean-l-hubbard/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429 n.7 (8th Cir. 1995).\nOur review of the record convinces us that the District Court's factual findings had\nsubstantial support in the record and are not clearly erroneous. Even if we supplement\nthe District Court's factual findings with other parts of the record, as plaintiff requests,\nCoach Rader's conduct did not constitute a substantive-due-process violation under\nWise.\n\n       The first Wise factor is the need for application of corporal punishment. Carl\nAvery twice disobeyed Coach Rader. His first statement that he was going to eat his\nbreakfast is inconsistent with an intent to follow Coach Rader's directives. When he\nwas again told to leave the cafeteria, he again disobeyed, stating that he was going to\nget his books. Although Coach Rader could have allowed Avery to get his books and\nthen leave, we give school administrators substantial deference in matters such as\nstudent discipline and maintaining order. See Peterson v. Ind. School District No. 811,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2267405\"><a href=\"/opinion/2267405/peterson-v-indep-sch-dist-no-811/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">665</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 673 (D. Minn. 1998).\n\n       The second Wise factor is the relationship between the need and amount of\npunishment administered. Plaintiff argues that by physically removing Avery from the\ncafeteria and banging his head against a pole, Coach Rader used an unreasonable\namount of force. However, Avery was \"mouthing off\" to the coach and was involved\nin a physical altercation with him. We cannot find that Coach Rader's use of force was\nsufficiently excessive to approach a substantive-due-process violation.\n\n      The third Wise factor is the extent of the injury inflicted. We assume that Avery\nreceived a bump on his head, but the severity of the injury is questionable in light of the\n\n                                            -5-\n\ffact that Avery was unable to recall at trial which side of his head he had a bump on.\n\n       The fourth Wise factor is whether the punishment was administered in a good\nfaith effort to maintain discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose\nof causing harm. Here, the District Court was unable to find Rader's actions motivated\nby bad faith or ill-will, and this view of the facts is not clearly erroneous.\n\n      Taken as a whole, we agree with the District Court that Coach Rader's actions\nwere not shocking to the conscience, see Wise, supra, 855 F.3d at 565. This is not the\nkind of truly egregious and extraordinary case for which the theory of substantive due\nprocess is properly reserved.\n\n                                          III.\n\n       The plaintiff next argues that the District Court erred in holding that the\nsuspension and expulsion did not violate Avery's procedural-due-process rights. With\nrespect to the suspension, the District Court made the factual finding that Avery was\napprised of the charges against him and was given an opportunity to present his side\nof the case in Principal Walton's office the day of the incident. This finding has\nadequate support in the record, and is not clearly erroneous. The facts on which the\nsuspension was based occurred in the Principal's immediate presence. The situation is\nlike that of a direct contempt, in which someone misbehaves himself in open court. The\nPrincipal's suspension of the plaintiff was not procedurally defective.\n\n      With regard to the expulsion, the plaintiff was fully informed of the grounds upon\nwhich the expulsion recommendation was based, and her son was given a hearing\nwhere he was represented by counsel who had full opportunity to examine and cross-\nexamine witnesses. It is true that the school district violated its own rules by not\nsupplying plaintiff's counsel with the statements of two witnesses in advance of the\nhearing. This violation is not to be condoned, but it does not automatically amount to\n\n                                          -6-\n\fa violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Significantly, plaintiff does not indicate\nanything in particular that his lawyer would have done differently if the statements had\nbeen provided on time.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n      Plaintiff's last argument is that the DeWitt School District discriminates with\nrespect to staffing in its schools. This is a free-standing claim, which could be brought\neven in the absence of the plaintiff's other disciplinary-related claims.\n\n       The Supreme Court has held that where plaintiffs prove a current condition of\nsegregated schooling within a school district where a dual system was once compelled\nby law, the State has an affirmative duty to eliminate all vestiges of state-imposed\nsegregation. See Keyes v. School District No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108844\"><a href=\"/opinion/108844/keyes-v-school-dist-no-1-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200 (1973). Therefore,\nwhen a plaintiff can show both prior de jure discrimination and currently segregated\nschools, there is a presumption that current disparities are the result of the defendant's\nprior unconstitutional conduct. See Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110142\"><a href=\"/opinion/110142/dayton-bd-of-ed-v-brinkman/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537-38 (1979). The burden then shifts to the defendant to prove otherwise. The\nSupreme Court has identified several areas of schools where a dual system can be\nshown, including but not limited to student body composition, faculty, staff,\ntransportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities. See Green v. County School\nBoard of New Kent County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 435 (1968).\n\n       Arkansas once required its school districts to operate racially segregated\nsystems. Raney v. Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107706\"><a href=\"/opinion/107706/raney-v-board-of-ed-of-gould-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968). But the plaintiff has not,\non this record, made a sufficient showing of current segregation. All the plaintiff has\noffered as evidence is a statistical imbalance in the faculty of the DeWitt School\nsystem, plus a lack of affirmative effort to recruit black applicants for faculty positions.\nThis is not enough to shift the burden to defendants and create a presumption of\nunlawful intent.\n\n                                            -7-\n\f       Plaintiff touches upon only one of the Green factors (staffing). Given the\npassage of time since state-mandated segregated schooling ceased, there are simply too\nmany other possible explanations that could plausibly explain these statistical\ndisparities. See Jenkins v. State of Missouri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744825\"><a href=\"/opinion/744825/chinyere-jenkins-by-her-next-friend-joi-jenkins-nicholas-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 595 (8th Cir. 1997)\n(passage of time is evidentiary consideration in determination of shifting burden).\nFinally, although this plaintiff does have standing to litigate this issue, in the context of\nthis case this claim seems to come as an afterthought in what is essentially a dispute\nover an individual disciplinary action.\n\n       In our opinion, the plaintiff has not shown enough to warrant a full-blown inquiry\ninto the hiring practices of the DeWitt School system. We hold against plaintiff on this\nclaim, but do so without prejudice to the right of any proper party to make a fuller\nshowing.\n\n                                             V.\n\n       As a final matter, plaintiff asks this Court to reinstate her supplemental state-law\nclaims. We affirm the District Court's decision to decline to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction. These claims are dismissed without prejudice.\n\n       For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n       A true copy.\n\n              Attest:\n\n                      CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\f</pre>",
