Tucker\n\n\n                   Submitted Pursuant to Third Circuit L.A.R. 34.1(a)\n                                 September 19, 2007\n\n               Before: SLOVITER, SMITH, and GARTH, Circuit Judges\n\n                              (Filed: September 21, 2007)\n\n\n\n\n                                      OPINION\n\n\nSMITH, Circuit Judge.\n\n      On February 10, 2005, a grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania indicted\n\nAngel Torres on a variety of charges stemming from ten alleged gunpoint robberies of\n\n                                           1\n\fbars, grocery stores, and pizzerias between December 27, 2003 and January 28, 2004.\n\nFollowing a seven-day trial, a jury convicted Torres of all charges.1 The District Court\n\nimposed a sentence of 262 years imprisonment. Torres timely appealed.\n\n       Torres’s sole argument on appeal is that the District Court abused its discretion by\n\ndeclining to sever the counts for separate trials, as Torres requested. However, all the\n\ncharges were properly joined as they were part of a common plan or scheme and evidence\n\nfrom each of the robberies would have been admissible in separate trials to demonstrate\n\nTorres’s identity as one of the robbers. See FED. R. CRIM. P. 8(a). Therefore, Torres was\n\nnot prejudiced by a single trial covering all the charges. See FED. R. CRIM. P. 14. We\n\nwill affirm Torres’s sentence.\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction over claims involving violation of federal law\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction over Torres’s appeal under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291. The District Court’s denial of Torres’s motion for severance is reviewed\n\nfor abuse of discretion. See United States v. Hart, 273 F.3d 363, 369 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\n       “Reversal of a conviction on the ground of abuse of discretion for failure to sever\n\nan offense under Rule 14 is almost non-existent.” United States v. Barrett, 505 F.2d\n\n1091, 1106 (7th Cir. 1974). We have held that, “even if the district court abused its\n\n\n\n       1\n         Torres was charged with one count of conspiracy to interfere with interstate\ncommerce by robbery and ten counts of interference with interstate commerce by robbery,\nall in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, and ten counts of knowingly using\nand carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 924(c).\n\n                                             2\n\fdiscretion in denying the severance motion, the defendant must pinpoint clear and\n\nsubstantial prejudice resulting in an unfair trial.” United States v. McGlory, 968 F.2d\n\n309, 340 (3d Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); see United States v. Eufrasio,\n\n935 F.2d 553, 568 (3d Cir. 1991) (“If we decide the trial court abused its discretion\n\ndenying severance, we must look to see whether appellants have pinpointed trial\n\nprejudice caused by the joinder they sought to avoid. Although a trial judge may have\n\nabused her discretion in denying a Rule 14 severance motion, we need reverse a\n\nconviction only if the appellant shows specifically that the denial caused trial prejudice.\n\nAn appellant’s burden is heavy: he must demonstrate clear and substantial prejudice\n\nresulting in a manifestly unfair trial.” (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).\n\nWe have also noted that “[i]t is not enough to show that severance would have increased\n\nthe defendant’s chances of acquittal.” McGlory, 968 F.2d at 340. Even where prejudice\n\nis possible, the district court need not order severance as “less drastic measures, such as\n\nlimiting instructions, often will suffice.” Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539\n\n(1993).\n\n       When considering whether a criminal defendant was prejudiced by joinder of\n\nmultiple charges, we have considered factors such as whether the presentation of separate\n\ncounts with distinct and extensive evidence confused the jury, whether the charging of\n\nseveral crimes made the jury hostile, and whether the jury was able to segregate the\n\nevidence as to each count. United States v. Weber, 437 F.2d 327, 332 (3d Cir. 1970); see\n\nalso United States v. Coleman, 22 F.3d 126, 132 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\n                                              3\n\f       As to the first factor, the District Court gave the jury explicit instructions that it\n\nwas to consider separately the evidence for each count. The jury is presumed to have\n\nfollowed its instructions. See Greer v. Miller, 483 U.S. 756, 766 n.8 (1987). Torres\n\npresents no evidence to rebut this presumption, apart from arguing that the robberies\n\ninvolved similar methods. Although the methods were similar, the jury was unlikely to\n\nconfuse them as the crimes were not complex and were committed against distinct entities\n\nwith easily distinguishable names. See Weber, 437 F.2d at 332 (“Although all the counts\n\nin the consolidated indictment related to Weber’s alleged misuse of his union office, the\n\njury was not likely to confuse one alleged transaction with another, because the various\n\nconstruction companies involved had separate and distinct names.”). More importantly,\n\nTorres presented no evidence tending to show confusion, such as “that witnesses’\n\nresponses at times indicated confusion as to which crime counsel were referring to in their\n\nquestions.” Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d 85, 93 (D.C. Cir. 1964).\n\n       As to the second factor, the crimes did not differ so greatly in nature that one was\n\nmore likely to arouse hostility than another. Although some of the crimes involved injury\n\nto others, all the counts arose from gunpoint robberies.\n\n       As to the third factor, an important consideration is “[w]hether the two indictments\n\nwere consolidated or severed, it is possible that [Torres] would have been confronted with\n\nsubstantially the same evidence, because evidence of each of the joined offenses would be\n\nadmissible in a separate trial for the other.” Weber, 437 F.2d at 332; see Eufrasio, 935\n\nF.2d at 570-71 (holding that severance was not required where the same evidence could\n\n                                               4\n\fhave been admitted for all counts). Evidence of other offenses is admissible for any\n\npurpose other than to show a mere propensity or disposition to commit a crime. Weber,\n\n437 F.2d at 332-33. In Torres’s case, each offense was relevant to show a common plan\n\nto rob similar commercial establishments within a few miles of each other at gunpoint and\n\nto establish Torres’s identity as one of the robbers.\n\n       Therefore, Torres has failed to carry his burden of showing actual prejudice from\n\njoinder of the claims against him. Torres also adds that the cases against him were\n\n“weak” and that the Government would have not been able to obtain convictions in\n\nseparate trials. Torres is mistaken, particularly as his partner in every robbery, Jaime\n\nValentin, gave the police a detailed account of each crime and inculpatory evidence was\n\nrecovered from Torres’s van. Finally, Torres concludes with a brief argument that\n\nprosecutions for armed robbery have no business in federal court. Irrespective of the\n\nacademic appeal of this argument, it is frivolous under the present scope of federal power.\n\nSee United States v. Haywood, 363 F.3d 200, 211 n.7 (3d Cir. 2004) (holding that the\n\nrobbery of a single bar that purchased beer in interstate commerce could be prosecuted\n\nunder federal law).\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f",

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"264122\"><a href=\"/opinion/264122/nathan-l-drew-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93 (D.C. Cir. 1964).\n\n       As to the second factor, the crimes did not differ so greatly in nature that one was\n\nmore likely to arouse hostility than another. Although some of the crimes involved injury\n\nto others, all the counts arose from gunpoint robberies.\n\n       As to the third factor, an important consideration is “[w]hether the two indictments\n\nwere consolidated or severed, it is possible that [Torres] would have been confronted with\n\nsubstantially the same evidence, because evidence of each of the joined offenses would be\n\nadmissible in a separate trial for the other.” Weber, 437 F.2d at 332; see Eufrasio, 935\n\nF.2d at 570-71 (holding that severance was not required where the same evidence could\n\n                                               4\n\fhave been admitted for all counts). Evidence of other offenses is admissible for any\n\npurpose other than to show a mere propensity or disposition to commit a crime. Weber,\n\n437 F.2d at 332-33. In Torres’s case, each offense was relevant to show a common plan\n\nto rob similar commercial establishments within a few miles of each other at gunpoint and\n\nto establish Torres’s identity as one of the robbers.\n\n       Therefore, Torres has failed to carry his burden of showing actual prejudice from\n\njoinder of the claims against him. Torres also adds that the cases against him were\n\n“weak” and that the Government would have not been able to obtain convictions in\n\nseparate trials. Torres is mistaken, particularly as his partner in every robbery, Jaime\n\nValentin, gave the police a detailed account of each crime and inculpatory evidence was\n\nrecovered from Torres’s van. Finally, Torres concludes with a brief argument that\n\nprosecutions for armed robbery have no business in federal court. Irrespective of the\n\nacademic appeal of this argument, it is frivolous under the present scope of federal power.\n\nSee United States v.
