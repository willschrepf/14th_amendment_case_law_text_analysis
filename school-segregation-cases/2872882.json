FACTS\n\f       Debtor Strategic Technologies, Inc. (“STI”) was in the business of providing\n\nshipping-related services to freight carrier customers. STI’s clients employed the\n\ncompany to audit their freight carrier invoices and inform them of the charges. The\n\nclients then could pay their bills by depositing funds with STI, which would then forward\n\nthe funds to the carrier. STI generally commingled its customers’ funds in “funding\n\naccounts,” maintained at different banks, but it did not maintain records to match or\n\nreconcile monies that customers deposited with monies that STI paid out to the freight\n\ncarriers.\n\n       STI maintained one of these funding accounts at Fleet Bank (the “Fleet Account”).\n\nThis account was essentially a pooled account into which STI deposited checks from its\n\ncustomers until it withdrew those funds to pay their freight charges. As a pooled account,\n\nthe customers’ funds were commingled in this account, but STI did not keep accurate\n\nrecords to track individual deposits and withdrawals on behalf of individual customers.\n\n       On June 11, 2002, STI stopped using the Fleet Account and began using an\n\naccount maintained by Commerce Bank (the “Commerce Funding Account”). The Fleet\n\nAccount was subsequently closed and the remaining funds totaling $5,132,456.02 were\n\ntransferred into the Commerce Funding Account by July 5, 2002. On July 11, 2002, the\n\nCommerce Funding Account had a negative balance of $2,371,223.54. Later that day, an\n\nSTI customer deposited $2,983,841.05 leaving a positive balance of $612,617.51.\n\nAppellant Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. (“Gulfstream”), one of STI’s clients, deposited\n\n$208,436.89 into the Commerce Funding Account on July 15, 2002. Several more\n\n                                             2\n\fdeposits and withdrawals were made by STI and its clients and, on July 17, the ending\n\nbalance was $3,130,576.44. The next day, STI filed for bankruptcy protection under\n\nChapter 11.\n\n       As it turns out, no later than 1993, STI had begun using monies in the client\n\nfunding accounts for purposes unrelated to paying its customers’ freight bills. For\n\ninstance, STI tapped its funding accounts to fund payroll and operating accounts, and\n\nMarc Cooper, the company’s president and sole shareholder, diverted money for his own\n\npersonal use. STI covered its misappropriations by engaging in what was essentially a\n\nkiting scheme. As it depleted the funding accounts, STI relied on newer funds deposited\n\nfrom customers to pay earlier, overdue freight bills of other customers. Eventually the\n\nreceipts from customers became insufficient to cover the shortfall in the funding\n\naccounts, and on July 18, 2002, STI filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11.\n\n       On July 31, 2002, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New\n\nJersey converted STI’s Chapter 11 proceeding into a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding\n\nand appointed Appellee Anthony Calascibetta as the bankruptcy trustee (the “Trustee”).\n\nOn August 14, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court ordered the Trustee to place all funds\n\nremaining in STI’s various bank accounts, including the Commerce Funding Account,\n\ninto an interest-bearing “segregated account.” The Trustee complied by depositing\n\n$3,634,438 into the segregated account. On September 24, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court\n\ndirected the Trustee to pay $255,468.03 from the segregated account to Knoll, Inc., one of\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fSTI’s former customers who mistakenly transferred that amount to STI after STI had filed\n\nfor bankruptcy.\n\n       The Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding naming all of STI’s customer-\n\ncreditors as defendants. Through the entry of default judgments and consent orders, the\n\nTrustee was able to resolve many of the claims against STI. Eventually, it resolved the\n\nclaims of all but four of the interested parties through a settlement agreement.\n\n       On August 11, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered the consent order embodying\n\nthe settlement agreement. The order called for the distribution of $423,155.73 from the\n\nsegregated account to Knoll, representing funds mistakenly transferred to STI after the\n\nbankruptcy case was filed. The remaining funds were distributed pro rata to the settling\n\ndefendants, with a portion set aside to cover the costs of administration of the bankruptcy\n\nestate and other priority claims. The agreement was to become effective upon entry of a\n\nfinal order granting summary judgment in the Bankruptcy Court in favor of the Trustee\n\nwith respect to any non-settling defendant.\n\n       On August 13, 2003, the Trustee filed a motion for summary judgment against the\n\nfour hold-out defendants. Prior to the return date of that motion, all but Gulfstream\n\nagreed to the settlement. Gulfstream filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment\n\nseeking return of $208,436.89 that it had deposited into the Commerce Funding Account\n\non July 15, 2002, three days before STI filed for bankruptcy. Gulfstream offered three\n\narguments in support of its motion: 1) none of the money in the funding account is\n\nproperty of the bankruptcy estate and therefore it can only be used to pay the beneficial\n\n                                              4\n\fowners; 2) although the trust money is commingled, the universe of co-owners of the\n\nmoney is determinable; and 3) the Trustee erred in preferring the claim of Knoll over\n\nGulfstream.1\n\n       The District Court rejected Gulfstream’s arguments and affirmed the decision of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Court. Gulfstream timely appealed.\n\n                     II. JURISDICTION & STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       The District Court derives its jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters from 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1334 (2005). This section confers upon the District Court “original and exclusive\n\njurisdiction of all cases under title 11” and “original but not exclusive jurisdiction over all\n\ncivil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.” Id.\n\nat (a)-(b). Section 157(a) of the Bankruptcy Code allows a district court to refer most of\n\nthese matters to a bankruptcy court. 28 U.S.C. § 157(a) (2005); see In re Combustion\n\nEng'g, Inc., 391 F.3d 190, 226 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n       We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 158(d) and 1291.\n\n“[T]his Court reviews ‘the Bankruptcy Court's findings of fact for clear error and\n\nexercises plenary review over the Bankruptcy Court's legal determinations.’” Zinchiak v.\n\nCIT Small Bus. Lending Corp. (In re Zinchiak), 406 F.3d 214, 221-22 (3d Cir. 2005)\n\n(citing Duke Energy Royal, LLC v. Pillowtex Corp. (In re Pillowtex, Inc.), 349 F.3d 711,\n\n716 (3d Cir. 2003)).\n\n   1\n       Although Gulfstream compares its claim to Knoll’s, it does not argue on appeal\nthat Knoll was not entitled to the return of funds it deposited after STI filed for\nbankruptcy.\n\n                                               5\n\f                                      III. ANALYSIS\n\n       Gulfstream seeks the return of funds it entrusted to STI shortly before STI filed for\n\nbankruptcy. To support its case, Gulfstream relies on two alternative principles. First,\n\nGulfstream, argues that all of the money in the Commerce Funding Account amounted to\n\ntrust assets and therefore the Bankruptcy Court had no jurisdiction to direct the\n\ndisposition of those funds. In the alternative, Gulfstream argues that if the money in the\n\nCommerce Funding Account was commingled, the Court was obligated to apply the\n\nLowest Intermediate Balancing Test. For the reasons set forth below, we reject both\n\ntheories and affirm.\n\n           A. The Court had Jurisdiction Over the Commerce Funding Account\n\n       Gulfstream’s initial argument is that the Bankruptcy Court and the Trustee agree\n\nthat the money in the Commerce Funding Account was primarily customer money held in\n\na constructive trust, and therefore, the Bankruptcy Court did not have jurisdiction to\n\ndirect the disposition of those funds. We find two flaws with this theory.\n\n       First, despite its statements that the amount of STI money in the Commerce\n\nFunding Account was negligible, the Bankruptcy Court specifically found that\n\nGulfstream’s funds were commingled in a single account with other clients’ funds and\n\nSTI funds. (Appellant App. at A349.) Neither party has demonstrated that this finding\n\nwas clearly erroneous. See Zinchiak, 406 F.3d at 221-22.\n\n       When funds are commingled, and a trust recipient claims a right in those funds, “a\n\nclaimant must make two showings: (1) demonstrate that the trust relationship and its legal\n\n                                             6\n\fsource exist, and (2) identify and trace the trust funds if they are commingled.” Goldberg\n\nv. N.J. Lawyers’ Fund for Client Prot., 932 F.2d 273, 280 (3d Cir. 1991). Because\n\nGulfstream could not sufficiently identify its funds in the commingled account, all of the\n\nCommerce Account Funds are presumed to be part of the bankruptcy estate.\n\n       Moreover, the question of whether the funds were part of the bankruptcy estate is\n\ndistinct from the question of whether the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction over the\n\ndisposition of the funds. Even if Gulfstream were able to establish that all of the funds in\n\nthe Commerce Funding Account were trust assets, the Bankruptcy Court would still retain\n\njurisdiction to return those funds to their rightful owners. See Canal Corp. v. Finnman (In\n\nre Johnson), 960 F.2d 396, 402 (4th Cir. 1992).\n\n                   B. The Court Properly Ordered Pro Rata Distribution\n\n       Gulfstream claims that once the Bankruptcy Court determined that the assets were\n\ncommingled assets, the Court was required to apply the Lowest Intermediate Balancing\n\nTest (“LIBT”) to allow it to trace its funds in the trust account. “The LIBT is a judicial\n\nconstruct that some federal courts have applied to ease a beneficiary’s tracing burden\n\nwhen ‘a trustee commingles trust funds with other monies in a single account.’” City of\n\nFarrell v. Sharon Steel Corp., 41 F.3d 92, 102 (3d Cir. 1994) (quoting In re Columbia Gas\n\nSys., 997 F.2d 1039, 1063 (3d Cir. 1993)). Under the LIBT, a court assumes that trust\n\nfunds are the last monies withdrawn from a commingled account. Id. However, once\n\ntrust money is removed (i.e. the balance of the commingled account dips below the total\n\namount of money claimed as trust funds), that money is not replenished, even if more\n\n                                             7\n\ffunds are deposited. Id. “Therefore, the lowest intermediate balance in a commingled\n\naccount represents trust funds that have never been dissipated and which are reasonably\n\nidentifiable.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n       Gulfstream argues that, applying the LIBT, it can trace $208,436.89 of its money\n\nin the Commerce Funding Account. However, Gulfstream ignores the fact that its funds\n\nwere not only commingled in an account with STI’s assets, but also with the trust assets\n\nof other STI customers.\n\n       While the LIBT is helpful in identifying one party’s assets commingled with the\n\ntrustee, its value is significantly lessened when the assets are commingled with many\n\nother similarly situated individuals. City of Farrell, 41 F.3d at 102 (“[T]he lowest\n\nintermediate balance in a commingled account represents trust funds which are\n\nreasonably identifiable.”) If the Bankruptcy Court had applied the LIBT to identify\n\nGulfstream’s funds, it would have done so at the possible expense of other customers\n\nsimilarly situated. In situations such as this one, when one party is claiming assets that\n\nare commingled with the assets of someone similarly situated, this Court has indicated a\n\npreference for a pro rata distribution. See Goldberg, 932 F.2d at 280 (“In general, courts\n\nfavor a pro rata distribution of funds when such funds are claimed by creditors of like\n\nstatus.”). Therefore, the Bankruptcy Court properly determined that all of the assets\n\noriginating in the Commerce Funding Account should be distributed pro rata.\n\n                 C. The Bankruptcy Court did not Err in Paying Expenses\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f       Finally, Gulfstream argues that the Bankruptcy Court should not have used client\n\ntrust funds to pay the expenses of the bankruptcy. However, as discussed above, the\n\nfunds that Gulfstream alleges are held in trust cannot be adequately traced. “[T]o\n\nestablish rights as a trust recipient, a claimant must . . . identify and trace the trust funds if\n\nthey are commingled.” Goldberg, 932 F.2d at 280. Since Gulfstream cannot identify and\n\ntrace the trust assets, the Court’s distribution was proper.\n\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f",

FACTS\n\f       Debtor Strategic Technologies, Inc. (“STI”) was in the business of providing\n\nshipping-related services to freight carrier customers. STI’s clients employed the\n\ncompany to audit their freight carrier invoices and inform them of the charges. The\n\nclients then could pay their bills by depositing funds with STI, which would then forward\n\nthe funds to the carrier. STI generally commingled its customers’ funds in “funding\n\naccounts,” maintained at different banks, but it did not maintain records to match or\n\nreconcile monies that customers deposited with monies that STI paid out to the freight\n\ncarriers.\n\n       STI maintained one of these funding accounts at Fleet Bank (the “Fleet Account”).\n\nThis account was essentially a pooled account into which STI deposited checks from its\n\ncustomers until it withdrew those funds to pay their freight charges. As a pooled account,\n\nthe customers’ funds were commingled in this account, but STI did not keep accurate\n\nrecords to track individual deposits and withdrawals on behalf of individual customers.\n\n       On June 11, 2002, STI stopped using the Fleet Account and began using an\n\naccount maintained by Commerce Bank (the “Commerce Funding Account”). The Fleet\n\nAccount was subsequently closed and the remaining funds totaling $5,132,456.02 were\n\ntransferred into the Commerce Funding Account by July 5, 2002. On July 11, 2002, the\n\nCommerce Funding Account had a negative balance of $2,371,223.54. Later that day, an\n\nSTI customer deposited $2,983,841.05 leaving a positive balance of $612,617.51.\n\nAppellant Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. (“Gulfstream”), one of STI’s clients, deposited\n\n$208,436.89 into the Commerce Funding Account on July 15, 2002. Several more\n\n                                             2\n\fdeposits and withdrawals were made by STI and its clients and, on July 17, the ending\n\nbalance was $3,130,576.44. The next day, STI filed for bankruptcy protection under\n\nChapter 11.\n\n       As it turns out, no later than 1993, STI had begun using monies in the client\n\nfunding accounts for purposes unrelated to paying its customers’ freight bills. For\n\ninstance, STI tapped its funding accounts to fund payroll and operating accounts, and\n\nMarc Cooper, the company’s president and sole shareholder, diverted money for his own\n\npersonal use. STI covered its misappropriations by engaging in what was essentially a\n\nkiting scheme. As it depleted the funding accounts, STI relied on newer funds deposited\n\nfrom customers to pay earlier, overdue freight bills of other customers. Eventually the\n\nreceipts from customers became insufficient to cover the shortfall in the funding\n\naccounts, and on July 18, 2002, STI filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11.\n\n       On July 31, 2002, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New\n\nJersey converted STI’s Chapter 11 proceeding into a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding\n\nand appointed Appellee Anthony Calascibetta as the bankruptcy trustee (the “Trustee”).\n\nOn August 14, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court ordered the Trustee to place all funds\n\nremaining in STI’s various bank accounts, including the Commerce Funding Account,\n\ninto an interest-bearing “segregated account.” The Trustee complied by depositing\n\n$3,634,438 into the segregated account. On September 24, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court\n\ndirected the Trustee to pay $255,468.03 from the segregated account to Knoll, Inc., one of\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fSTI’s former customers who mistakenly transferred that amount to STI after STI had filed\n\nfor bankruptcy.\n\n       The Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding naming all of STI’s customer-\n\ncreditors as defendants. Through the entry of default judgments and consent orders, the\n\nTrustee was able to resolve many of the claims against STI. Eventually, it resolved the\n\nclaims of all but four of the interested parties through a settlement agreement.\n\n       On August 11, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered the consent order embodying\n\nthe settlement agreement. The order called for the distribution of $423,155.73 from the\n\nsegregated account to Knoll, representing funds mistakenly transferred to STI after the\n\nbankruptcy case was filed. The remaining funds were distributed pro rata to the settling\n\ndefendants, with a portion set aside to cover the costs of administration of the bankruptcy\n\nestate and other priority claims. The agreement was to become effective upon entry of a\n\nfinal order granting summary judgment in the Bankruptcy Court in favor of the Trustee\n\nwith respect to any non-settling defendant.\n\n       On August 13, 2003, the Trustee filed a motion for summary judgment against the\n\nfour hold-out defendants. Prior to the return date of that motion, all but Gulfstream\n\nagreed to the settlement. Gulfstream filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment\n\nseeking return of $208,436.89 that it had deposited into the Commerce Funding Account\n\non July 15, 2002, three days before STI filed for bankruptcy. Gulfstream offered three\n\narguments in support of its motion: 1) none of the money in the funding account is\n\nproperty of the bankruptcy estate and therefore it can only be used to pay the beneficial\n\n                                              4\n\fowners; 2) although the trust money is commingled, the universe of co-owners of the\n\nmoney is determinable; and 3) the Trustee erred in preferring the claim of Knoll over\n\nGulfstream.1\n\n       The District Court rejected Gulfstream’s arguments and affirmed the decision of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Court. Gulfstream timely appealed.\n\n                     II. JURISDICTION & STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       The District Court derives its jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters from 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1334 (2005). This section confers upon the District Court “original and exclusive\n\njurisdiction of all cases under title 11” and “original but not exclusive jurisdiction over all\n\ncivil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.” Id.\n\nat (a)-(b). Section 157(a) of the Bankruptcy Code allows a district court to refer most of\n\nthese matters to a bankruptcy court. 28 U.S.C. § 157(a) (2005); see In re Combustion\n\nEng'g, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788550\"><a href=\"/opinion/788550/in-re-combustion-engineering-inc-first-state-insurance-company-hartford/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n       We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 158(d) and 1291.\n\n“[T]his Court reviews ‘the Bankruptcy Court's findings of fact for clear error and\n\nexercises plenary review over the Bankruptcy Court's legal determinations.’” Zinchiak v.\n\nCIT Small Bus.

ANALYSIS\n\n       Gulfstream seeks the return of funds it entrusted to STI shortly before STI filed for\n\nbankruptcy. To support its case, Gulfstream relies on two alternative principles. First,\n\nGulfstream, argues that all of the money in the Commerce Funding Account amounted to\n\ntrust assets and therefore the Bankruptcy Court had no jurisdiction to direct the\n\ndisposition of those funds. In the alternative, Gulfstream argues that if the money in the\n\nCommerce Funding Account was commingled, the Court was obligated to apply the\n\nLowest Intermediate Balancing Test. For the reasons set forth below, we reject both\n\ntheories and affirm.\n\n           A. The Court had Jurisdiction Over the Commerce Funding Account\n\n       Gulfstream’s initial argument is that the Bankruptcy Court and the Trustee agree\n\nthat the money in the Commerce Funding Account was primarily customer money held in\n\na constructive trust, and therefore, the Bankruptcy Court did not have jurisdiction to\n\ndirect the disposition of those funds. We find two flaws with this theory.\n\n       First, despite its statements that the amount of STI money in the Commerce\n\nFunding Account was negligible, the Bankruptcy Court specifically found that\n\nGulfstream’s funds were commingled in a single account with other clients’ funds and\n\nSTI funds. (Appellant App. at A349.) Neither party has demonstrated that this finding\n\nwas clearly erroneous. See Zinchiak, 406 F.3d at 221-22.\n\n       When funds are commingled, and a trust recipient claims a right in those funds, “a\n\nclaimant must make two showings: (1) demonstrate that the trust relationship and its legal\n\n                                             6\n\fsource exist, and (2) identify and trace the trust funds if they are commingled.” Goldberg\n\nv. N.J. Lawyers’ Fund for Client Prot., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560481\"><a href=\"/opinion/560481/24-collier-bankrcas2d-1745-bankr-l-rep-p-74013-in-re-harvey/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 (3d Cir. 1991). Because\n\nGulfstream could not sufficiently identify its funds in the commingled account, all of the\n\nCommerce Account Funds are presumed to be part of the bankruptcy estate.\n\n       Moreover, the question of whether the funds were part of the bankruptcy estate is\n\ndistinct from the question of whether the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction over the\n\ndisposition of the funds. Even if Gulfstream were able to establish that all of the funds in\n\nthe Commerce Funding Account were trust assets, the Bankruptcy Court would still retain\n\njurisdiction to return those funds to their rightful owners. See Canal Corp. v. Finnman (In\n\nre Johnson), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580717\"><a href=\"/opinion/580717/in-re-robert-d-johnson-debtor-canal-corporation-general-partner-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 402 (4th Cir. 1992).\n\n                   B. The Court Properly Ordered Pro Rata Distribution\n\n       Gulfstream claims that once the Bankruptcy Court determined that the assets were\n\ncommingled assets, the Court was required to apply the Lowest Intermediate Balancing\n\nTest (“LIBT”) to allow it to trace its funds in the trust account. “The LIBT is a judicial\n\nconstruct that some federal courts have applied to ease a beneficiary’s tracing burden\n\nwhen ‘a trustee commingles trust funds with other monies in a single account.’” City of\n\nFarrell v. Sharon Steel Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683160\"><a href=\"/opinion/683160/city-of-farrell-v-sharon-steel-corporation-united-states-trustees-office/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 (3d Cir. 1994) (quoting In re Columbia Gas\n\nSys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610810\"><a href=\"/opinion/610810/in-re-columbia-gas-systems-inc-columbia-gas-transmission-corporation-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1063 (3d Cir. 1993)). Under the LIBT, a court assumes that trust\n\nfunds are the last monies withdrawn from a commingled account. Id. However, once\n\ntrust money is removed (i.e. the balance of the commingled account dips below the total\n\namount of money claimed as trust funds), that money is not replenished, even if more\n\n                                             7\n\ffunds are deposited. Id. “Therefore, the lowest intermediate balance in a commingled\n\naccount represents trust funds that have never been dissipated and which are reasonably\n\nidentifiable.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n       Gulfstream argues that, applying the LIBT, it can trace $208,436.89 of its money\n\nin the Commerce Funding Account. However, Gulfstream ignores the fact that its funds\n\nwere not only commingled in an account with STI’s assets, but also with the trust assets\n\nof other STI customers.\n\n       While the LIBT is helpful in identifying one party’s assets commingled with the\n\ntrustee, its value is significantly lessened when the assets are commingled with many\n\nother similarly situated individuals. City of Farrell, 41 F.3d at 102 (“[T]he lowest\n\nintermediate balance in a commingled account represents trust funds which are\n\nreasonably identifiable.”) If the Bankruptcy Court had applied the LIBT to identify\n\nGulfstream’s funds, it would have done so at the possible expense of other customers\n\nsimilarly situated. In situations such as this one, when one party is claiming assets that\n\nare commingled with the assets of someone similarly situated, this Court has indicated a\n\npreference for a pro rata distribution. See Goldberg, 932 F.2d at 280 (“In general, courts\n\nfavor a pro rata distribution of funds when such funds are claimed by creditors of like\n\nstatus.”). Therefore, the Bankruptcy Court properly determined that all of the assets\n\noriginating in the Commerce Funding Account should be distributed pro rata.\n\n                 C. The Bankruptcy Court did not Err in Paying Expenses\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f       Finally, Gulfstream argues that the Bankruptcy Court should not have used client\n\ntrust funds to pay the expenses of the bankruptcy. However, as discussed above, the\n\nfunds that Gulfstream alleges are held in trust cannot be adequately traced. “[T]o\n\nestablish rights as a trust recipient, a claimant must . . . identify and trace the trust funds if\n\nthey are commingled.” Goldberg, 932 F.2d at 280. Since Gulfstream cannot identify and\n\ntrace the trust assets, the Court’s distribution was proper.\n\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f</pre>",
