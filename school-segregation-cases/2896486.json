See Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4 and\n\nI.O.P. 10.6.\n\f       In January 2006, Appellant, a federal prisoner incarcerated in Pennsylvania,\n\ninitiated a pro se Bivens action against various prison authorities at the Federal\n\nCorrectional Institute in Allenwood (FCI-Allenwood).1 Appellant’s amended complaint\n\ncontended that defendants violated his First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights by placing him in the prison’s Special Housing Unit (SHU) on\n\nadministrative detention status without following proper procedures. Prison officials\n\nplaced Wilson in the SHU pending the outcome of an internal investigation concerning a\n\nmagazine confiscated from Wilson’s locker. Specifically, Wilson claimed that he was\n\nnever provided with: 1) an administrative detention order as mandated by the Bureau of\n\nPrison (BOP) regulations; 2) an opportunity to appear before the Segregation Review\n\nBoard (SRO); and 3) a psychological assessment despite a history of mental and\n\nemotional problems. Wilson alleged that when he inquired about the status of the\n\ninvestigation and attempted to file an administrative grievance, prison officials did not\n\nprovide him with the proper forms and threatened him with misconduct charges. Wilson\n\nsought compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief. On September\n\n26, 2007 the District Court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all claims,\n\nand Wilson filed a timely notice of appeal in this Court.\n\n       We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s grant of Appellee’s motion\n\n\n\n       1\n       In Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403\nU.S. 388 (1971), the Supreme Court recognized a private cause of action to recover\ndamages against a federal agent for violations of constitutional rights.\n\n                                             -2-\n\ffor summary judgment. See Whitfield v. Radian Guar., Inc., 501 F.3d 262, 265 (3d Cir.\n\n2007). We apply the same standard in reviewing a motion for summary judgment as the\n\nDistrict Court. Id. A motion for summary judgment should be granted only if there are\n\nno genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n       Wilson’s complaint that he was kept in the SHU during the pendency of the ten-\n\nmonth internal investigation, and for ten weeks afterward, is not a cognizable\n\nconstitutional claim.2 In Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995), the United States\n\nSupreme Court acknowledged that state prison regulations may create liberty interests\n\nprotected by the Due Process Clause. However, “these [liberty] interests will be generally\n\nlimited to freedom of restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an\n\nunexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process clause of its own\n\nforce, nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to\n\nthe ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 483-84.3 We assume that the\n\nfederal government may conceivably also confer such liberty interests on prisoners. See\n\n\n       2\n        Under the Prison Reform Litigation Act, a prisoner must exhaust “such\nadministrative remedies as are available[.]” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). In the present case, the\nDistrict Court determined that there were issues of material fact in dispute as to the\nexhaustion requirement and therefore chose not to resolve the issue. See Ray v. Kertes,\n285 F.3d 287, 292 (3d Cir. 2002) (PLRA’s exhaustion requirement does not act as a\njurisdictional bar).\n       3\n       It is important to note that Wilson is a federal prisoner and therefore his case is\ngoverned by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See Crowder v. True, 74\nF.3d 812, 814-15 (7 th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                             -3-\n\fCrowder v. True, 74 F.3d 812, 815 (7 th Cir. 1996).\n\n       Here, however, the District Court correctly determined that Wilson’s confinement\n\nin administrative segregation did not implicate a liberty interest. As noted by the District\n\nCourt, Wilson was the subject of an internal investigation and there was a need for his\n\nconfinement in the SHU until November 2005. The subsequent ten-week period of\n\nconfinement, beginning after the end of the investigation and prior to Wilson’s transfer to\n\na different facility in February 2006, also did not transform the entire detention into the\n\natypical and significant hardship contemplated in Sandin. See Griffin v. Vaughn, 112\n\nF.3d 703, 706 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding that a Pennsylvania prisoner’s confinement in\n\nadministrative segregation for 15 months did not implicate a liberty interest). Therefore,\n\nthe confinement in SHU and the lack of a formal administrative detention order did not\n\nrise to the level of a constitutional violation.\n\n       Further, Wilson’s reliance on BOP regulations is misplaced. “The central teaching\n\nof Sandin is that a state statute or regulation conferring a right is not alone enough to\n\ntrigger due process.” Id. at 708. In any event, the forms and affidavits submitted by the\n\nDefendants indicate that Wilson received periodic psychological assessments and SRO\n\nreviews.\n\n       Wilson alleged that his placement in the SHU and subsequent deprivation of\n\nprocedural rights constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fHe failed to raise any genuine issues of material fact as to the claim, however.4\n\nSpecifically, Wilson did not plead any facts in his complaint which might lead a court to\n\nbelieve that he has been deprived of “the minimal civilized measures of life’s\n\nnecessities.” Id. at 709.\n\n       Finally, the District Court properly granted summary judgment for the wardens of\n\nFCI-Allenwood. Wilson pled only that the wardens failed to take disciplinary action\n\nagainst prison officials to curb “the known pattern of the staffs [sic] deliberate\n\nindifference to correct procedure”. As stated above, none of the claims against lower\n\nlevel prison officials is meritorious. Therefore, even if a respondeat superior theory were\n\navailable, Appellee’s motion for summary judgment was properly granted.5\n\n       Accordingly, because this appeal presents us with no substantial question, we will\n\nsummarily affirm the decision of the District Court. See Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4 and\n\nI.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n       Wilson does not state how defendants violated his First, Fourth, Sixth or\nFourteenth Amendment rights.\n       5\n        Most jurisdictions do not recognize respondeat superior liability in a Bivens\naction. See Young v. Quinlan, 960 F.2d 351, 358 n.14 (3d Cir. 1992) (superseded by\nstatute on other grounds).\n\n                                             -5-\n\f",

Vaughn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740238\"><a href=\"/opinion/740238/jerome-griffin-v-don-vaughn-hugh-owens-bk-smith-r-johnson-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding that a Pennsylvania prisoner’s confinement in\n\nadministrative segregation for 15 months did not implicate a liberty interest). Therefore,\n\nthe confinement in SHU and the lack of a formal administrative detention order did not\n\nrise to the level of a constitutional violation.\n\n       Further, Wilson’s reliance on BOP regulations is misplaced. “The central teaching\n\nof Sandin is that a state statute or regulation conferring a right is not alone enough to\n\ntrigger due process.” Id. at 708. In any event, the forms and affidavits submitted by the\n\nDefendants indicate that Wilson received periodic psychological assessments and SRO\n\nreviews.\n\n       Wilson alleged that his placement in the SHU and subsequent deprivation of\n\nprocedural rights constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fHe failed to raise any genuine issues of material fact as to the claim, however.4\n\nSpecifically, Wilson did not plead any facts in his complaint which might lead a court to\n\nbelieve that he has been deprived of “the minimal civilized measures of life’s\n\nnecessities.” Id. at 709.\n\n       Finally, the District Court properly granted summary judgment for the wardens of\n\nFCI-Allenwood. Wilson pled only that the wardens failed to take disciplinary action\n\nagainst prison officials to curb “the known pattern of the staffs [sic] deliberate\n\nindifference to correct procedure”. As stated above, none of the claims against lower\n\nlevel prison officials is meritorious. Therefore, even if a respondeat superior theory were\n\navailable, Appellee’s motion for summary judgment was properly granted.5\n\n       Accordingly, because this appeal presents us with no substantial question, we will\n\nsummarily affirm the decision of the District Court. See Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4 and\n\nI.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n       Wilson does not state how defendants violated his First, Fourth, Sixth or\nFourteenth Amendment rights.\n       5\n        Most jurisdictions do not recognize respondeat superior liability in a Bivens\naction.
