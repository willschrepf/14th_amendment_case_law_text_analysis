Comiskey, III a/k/a\nTrey Comiskey. The crux of the dispute between the parties is FH Partners’ enforcement\nof the cross-collateralization clause in a loan agreement. Although Comiskey was not\noriginally a party to the agreement, he signed an Extension and Modification of the\nagreement along with the original debtor. After the original debtor defaulted on other\nloans, FH Partners used the cross-collateralization clause to foreclose on property that the\ndebtor had deeded to Comiskey’s company, TC3, Inc.              In six issues, appellants,\nComiskey and TC3, contend (1) they presented more than a scintilla of evidence\n\fsupporting various theories of waiver, estoppel, and mutual mistake that bar FH Partners\nfrom enforcing the cross-collateralization clause, (2) the trial court erred in excluding\ntestimony regarding the purpose of the agreement Comiskey signed, (3) they presented\nmore than a scintilla of evidence that FH Partners committed fraud, (4) the court erred in\ndetermining that the loan documents unambiguously permit enforcement of the cross-\ncollaterization clause, (5) the court erred in refusing to take into consideration the fair\nmarket value of foreclosed property in determining the merit of certain counterclaims,\nand (6) the court erred in its award of attorney’s fees because FH Partners failed to\nsegregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.\n\n       We reverse the trial court’s grant of a directed verdict on appellants’ waiver claim\nand, consequently, the award of attorney’s fees to FH Partners. We affirm the remainder\nof the judgment.\n\n                                             I. Background\n\n       The connection between Comiskey and FH Partners runs through Paul Gomberg,\nwho was a debtor to FH Partners and a business associate of Comiskey. By May 2008,\nGomberg had several loans with 1st Choice Bank, a predecessor in interest to FH\nPartners. One of the transactions involved a purchase money loan for $1.365 million to\npurchase real property on Drury Street in Houston, Texas, and the other was a purchase\nmoney loan of $900,000 for property in an area known as “Burkhart Forest.”                                  In\nassociation with both of these notes, Gomberg executed deeds of trust to pledge the\nrespective properties as collateral.              These deeds of trust also contained cross-\ncollateralization or “dragnet” clauses that made each property security for all of\nGomberg’s indebtedness to the beneficiary of the deeds of trust (at the time, 1st Choice).1\n\n\n       1\n           For example, the deed of trust for the Burkhart property includes language stating as follows:\n\n       This conveyance is made in trust . . . for the purpose of securing and enforcing the\n       payment of a certain promissory note . . . executed by Grantor [Gomberg] and payable to\n       the order of 1ST CHOICE BANK, (hereinafter, together with any subsequent holder of\n       the Note, called “Beneficiary”[)] . . . all renewals, rearrangements, extensions and/or\n       modifications of the Note; and all other sums of money which may be hereafter paid or\n                                                      2\n\f       Gomberg used the Burkhart loan to buy the Burkhart property from GHC3\nDevelopment, a corporation owned by Comiskey. The purchase price was $1.2 million;\nGomberg paid $900,000 from proceeds of the 1st Choice loan and gave GHC3 a\npromissory note for the remainder. The promissory note also was secured by a second\nlien on the Burkhart property.          Apparently, Gomberg intended to sell the Burkhart\nproperty to a local developer, but when that sale fell through and it appeared that\nGomberg would be unable to make payment on the promissory note, Gomberg executed a\ndeed in lieu of foreclosure, conveying the Burkhart property to TC3, a separate\ncorporation wholly owned by Comiskey. That transaction, however, did not extinguish\nthe debt owed to 1st Choice or 1st Choice’s first lien on the Burkhart property.\n\n       On February 19, 2008, Gomberg and Comiskey went to 1st Choice’s offices where\nboth signed an “Extension and Modification” of the Burkhart note. This Extension and\nModification, and the circumstances surrounding its execution, are the focus of the\npresent litigation.\n\n       The Burkhart note was originally scheduled to mature on January 18, 2008. Under\nthe terms of the Extension and Modification, Gomberg and Comiskey promised to pay\nthe principal amount of the note ($900,000) plus 8% interest. The interest was due in six\nmonthly payments beginning February 18, 2008, and the principal balance was due at\nmaturity on July 18, 2008. FH Partners contends that it incorporated and maintained in\nfull force the Burkhart deed of trust with its cross-collateralization, or “dragnet,” clause,\nand appellants contend that it extinguished the clause. A key dispute between the parties\n\n\n\n       advanced by or on behalf of Beneficiary under the terms and provisions of this Deed of\n       Trust; any additional loans made by Beneficiary to Grantors; and any and all other\n       indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of any kind of Grantors to Beneficiary, now or\n       hereafter existing, absolute or contingent, joint and/or several, secured or unsecured, due\n       or not due, arising by operation of law, including indebtedness, obligations and liabilities\n       to Beneficiary of Grantors as a member of any partnership, syndicate, association or other\n       group, and whether incurred by Grantors as principal, surety, endorser, guarantor,\n       accommodation party or otherwise, and whether originally contracted with Beneficiary or\n       acquired by Beneficiary pursuant to a loan participation agreement or otherwise (all of\n       which are hereinafter referred to as the “Indebtedness”). (Emphasis added.)\n                                                    3\n\frevolves around interpretation of the following paragraph in the Extension and\nModification:\n\n       And the Undersigned [Gomberg and Comiskey] hereby extends said liens\n       on said property until said indebtedness and note as so renewed, modified\n       and extended has been fully paid, and agreed that such extension or\n       rearrangement shall in no manner affect or impair said note or the liens\n       securing the same and that said liens shall not in any manner be waived, the\n       purpose of this instrument being simply to extend or rearrange the time or\n       manner of payment of said notes and indebtedness and to carry forward all\n       liens securing the same, which are acknowledged by the Undersigned to be\n       valid and subsisting, and the Undersigned further agree that all terms and\n       provisions of said original note and of the instrument or instruments\n       creating or fixing the liens securing the same shall be and remain in full\n       force and effect as therein written, except as otherwise expressly provided\n       herein.\nThe parties’ arguments regarding this paragraph will be discussed in detail below.\n\n       Bill Sellers, a senior vice president of 1st Choice, signed the Extension and\nModification on behalf of 1st Choice. There is no dispute that Comiskey signed the\nExtension and Modification; however, at trial, there was conflicting testimony regarding\nthe circumstances under which Comiskey signed the agreement. Comiskey testified that\nhe asked 1st Choice’s representative, Sellers, about the Burkhart note itself but it was not\nproduced at the meeting. According to Comiskey, Sellers represented that “the key terms\nof what would be our relationship going forward were in that three-page document [the\nExtension and Modification].” Comiskey said that the terms he was interested in were\nthe interest rate and term of the loan. Comiskey had previously requested a copy of the\nBurkhart note from Gomberg, but Gomberg had failed to comply with Burkhart’s request.\nLater in his testimony, Comiskey stated it was his understanding that if he paid off the\nnote, title to the Burkhart property would be released to him. He said that he came to this\nconclusion in part because of discussions he had with Sellers. When asked what Sellers\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fsaid to make him think this, defense counsel objected on hearsay grounds and the trial\ncourt sustained the objection.2\n\n        In the offer of proof, Comiskey’s attorney indicated that, had he been permitted to\nanswer the question, Comiskey would have explained that Sellers told him the Extension\nand Modification was the only document he needed to review and full payment of the\nnote would result in a full release of 1st Choice’s lien on the property. Further according\nto the attorney, Comiskey would have testified that Sellers made these statements both\nbefore and after the Extension and Modification was signed. However, Comiskey also\nacknowledged in his trial testimony that he did not read all of the Extension and\nModification or any of the Burkhart note or deed of trust, which were referenced in the\nExtension and Modification.\n\n        Sellers and Gomberg both testified that contact between Sellers and Comiskey was\nlimited and no representations were made about any other documents.                             Gomberg,\nhowever, acknowledged that he was not in Comiskey’s presence the entire time on the\nday in question when they were at 1st Choice.3\n\n        Comiskey subdivided the Burkhart property into several lots and began selling\nindividual lots. When the first two lots sold, 1st Choice granted partial releases of its lien\non those particular parcels and the majority of sale proceeds was allocated to reduce the\nbalance on the Burkhart note.4 On May 23, 2008, all of Gomberg’s 1st Choice debt,\nincluding the Burkhart and Drury notes, was purchased by FH Partners. As the date of\nthe debt sale approached, Comiskey contacted AllegianceBank about the possibility of\nobtaining another loan to pay off the Burkhart note. Allegiance requested the current\nbalance from 1st Choice, and 1st Choice responded with a payoff quote addressed to\n\n        2\n             In their second issue, appellants specifically complain about the court’s sustaining of this\nobjection.\n        3\n          Gomberg stated that he stepped away from Comiskey for a brief period of time to transact other\nbusiness at the bank. There is no indication in the record that Gomberg left Comiskey with Sellers or that\nSellers and Comiskey had any contact outside of Gomberg’s presence on the day in question.\n        4\n          The Burkhart deed of trust specifically authorized the granting of partial releases “without\naffecting the lien hereof against the remainder.”\n                                                     5\n\fGomberg, which included the following language: “PLEASE FURNISH RELEASE OF\nLIEN.” Sellers testified that such language typically indicated a bank was expecting to\nrelease a lien once the indicated amount was paid. Comiskey never obtained the loan\nfrom Allegiance.\n\n       After FH Partners purchased the notes, Jeff Coupe, a senior vice president for First\nCity Servicing Corp., which managed Gomberg’s notes for FH Partners, communicated\nwith Comiskey about paying off the Burkhart note.          When Comiskey sold another\nsubdivided lot in the Burkhart property, FH Partners issued a partial release of its lien to\nfacilitate the sale. At some point, an apparent discrepancy arose regarding the balance on\nthe Burkhart note when Comiskey gave Gomberg a check to pay on the note, but the\nfunds were misapplied.      In the midst of this complication, Comiskey requested a\nstatement and Coupe responded that the balance was $87,174.53.\n\n       In late April 2008, Gomberg went into default on his purchase money loan for the\nDrury property. Evidence reflects that he was cooperative through that summer in trying\nto pay the loan, but in August 2008, negotiations between Gomberg and First City (as FH\nPartners’ representative) broke down, and FH Partners decided to foreclose on the Drury\nproperty.   In that same month, Comiskey again requested a payoff amount on the\nBurkhart property, and First City informed him that the Burkhart property was subject to\ncross-collateralization obligations for debt on which Gomberg was then in default and\nthat these other obligations would have to be satisfied before the lien on the Burkhart\nproperty could be released. Comiskey apparently attempted to pay the remaining balance\non the Burkhart note but FH Partners rejected the payment. FH Partners then foreclosed\non the last remaining subdivided lot from the Burkhart property.\n\n       Thereafter, FH Partners brought a declaratory judgment action to establish that it\nhad not breached the contract between the parties. Comiskey then raised numerous\ndefenses and counterclaims, including variations of waiver, estoppel, fraud, breach of\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fcontract, mutual mistake, and unjust enrichment.5 After presentation of the evidence but\nbefore the jury was charged, the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of FH\nPartners. The court then entered a declaratory judgment that FH Partners did not breach\nthe contract between the parties. Appellants now bring this appeal.\n\n        We begin our analysis by addressing appellants’ evidentiary complaints under\nissue two. We will then consider the breach-of-an-unambiguous-contract contention\nraised in issue four, the mutual mistake, estoppel, and waiver claims raised in issue one,\nand the fraud claim raised in issue three. Lastly, we will consider the fair market value\ncontention raised in issue five and the attorney’s fees complaint raised in issue six.\n\n                                     II. Standard of Review\n\n        Appellants primarily seek reversal of the trial court’s granting of a directed verdict\nfavoring FH Partners. We review the grant of a directed verdict under the usual standards\nfor assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence. See City of Keller v. Wilson, 168\nS.W.3d 802, 821–28 (Tex. 2005). We examine the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the party against whom the verdict was directed, and we determine whether there is\nany evidence of probative value to raise a material fact issue on the question presented.\nSee Bostrom Seating, Inc. v. Crane Carrier Co., 140 S.W.3d 681, 684 (Tex. 2004). We\ncredit favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could and disregard contrary evidence\nunless reasonable jurors could not. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827.\n\n                                  III. Evidentiary Complaints\n\n        We first address appellants’ challenges to evidentiary rulings made by the trial\ncourt to determine whether we can appropriately consider certain evidence in analyzing\nappellants’ substantive contentions. Under issue two, appellants specifically complain\nabout exclusion of (1) Comiskey’s testimony that Sellers told him that full payment of the\nBurkhart note would result in full release of the Burkhart lien, and (2) Sellers’s testimony\n\n        5\n         Appellants initially raised claims against Gomberg and other entities as third-party defendants,\nbut those claims were nonsuited or otherwise disposed of prior to trial. Appellants also raised other\ncounterclaims against FH Partners that are not raised as grounds for reversal in this appeal.\n                                                   7\n\fthat “the deal” was that if the note were paid in full, the lien would be released. To\npreserve error in the exclusion of evidence, a party must (1) attempt during the\nevidentiary portion of the trial to introduce the evidence; (2) if an objection is lodged,\nspecify the purpose for which the evidence is offered and give the trial court reasons why\nthe evidence is admissible; (3) obtain a ruling from the court; and (4) if the court rules the\nevidence inadmissible, make a record of the evidence the party desires admitted. E.g.,\nTex. Prop. and Cas. Guar. Ass’n v. Nat’l Am. Ins. Co., 208 S.W.3d 523, 546 (Tex. App.–\nAustin 2006, pet. denied).\n\n       We review a trial court’s evidentiary rulings under an abuse of discretion standard.\nIn re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570, 575 (Tex. 2005). A trial court abuses its discretion when it\nacts without regard to any guiding rules or principles. Downer v. Aquamarine Operators,\nInc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241–42 (Tex. 1985); Mitchell v. Bank of Am., N.A., 156 S.W.3d\n622, 626 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2004, pet. denied). Unless an erroneous evidentiary ruling\nprobably caused rendition of an improper judgment, this court will not overturn the trial\ncourt’s ruling. Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, 34 S.W.3d 887, 906 (Tex. 2000).\n\n                          A. Sellers’s Alleged Representations\n\n       We turn first to the excluded testimony from Comiskey regarding alleged\nrepresentations by Sellers. During direct examination, Comiskey’s counsel asked him\nwhy he thought that if he paid off the Burkhart note the lien would be released.\nComiskey answered, in part, that his belief was based on “[d]iscussions . . . with Mr.\nSellers.” Counsel next asked, “What did Mr. Sellers say that made you think this was the\ndeal?” Opposing counsel then raised a hearsay objection, which the trial court sustained.\nIn response, appellant’s counsel pointed out that the question and expected answer went\nto Comiskey’s state of mind when he acted in reliance on the statement. Counsel also\nexplained that the statement was relevant to the intent of the parties in making the\nagreement and was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Later, counsel\nsubmitted an offer of proof, indicating Comiskey would have testified that Sellers stated,\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fboth before and after the signing of the Extension and Modification, that full payment of\nthe note would result in full release of the lien.\n\n        On appeal, appellants argue that the proffered testimony concerned “operative\nfacts” and therefore was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted in Sellers’s\nalleged statements; in other words, the testimony was admissible as evidence that Sellers\nmade the statements, regardless of whether the statements were true. See 2 Steven Goode\net al., Texas Practice Series: Guide to the Texas Rules of Evidence § 801.2 (3d ed. 2002)\n(discussing nonhearsay utterances including “operative facts”). For example, in proving\nelements of estoppel, testimony that a promise was made would not be hearsay because\nrelevance of the testimony is not dependent on the truth of the statement but on the fact\nthat it was made. See Allen v. Allen, 280 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2008, pet.\ndenied); cf. Thomas C. Cook, Inc. v. Rowhanian, 774 S.W.2d 679, 685 (Tex. App.—El\nPaso 1989, writ denied) (explaining that statements constituting offer, acceptance, or\nterms of a contract concern operative facts and are therefore not barred by the hearsay\nrule); Cherokee Water Co. v. Forderhause, 727 S.W.2d 605, 614 (Tex. App.—\nTexarkana) (finding statements of operative facts admissible in context of mutual mistake\nclaim), rev’d on other grounds, 741 S.W.2d 377 (Tex. 1987). Because Comiskey’s\ntestimony was offered as proof that Sellers made certain statements, and not to establish\nthe truth of the matter asserted in the statements themselves, we agree that the proffered\ntestimony was not hearsay. We hold the trial court abused its discretion by excluding it.\nAccordingly, we will consider the excluded testimony where appropriate in our\nsubstantive analysis but reverse only if the evidentiary error was harmful. See Caffe Ribs,\nInc. v. State, 328 S.W.3d 919, 927, 931 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.).6\n\n\n\n\n        6\n          As will be explained in detail below, the excluded testimony was an integral part of the evidence\nestablishing a fact question regarding appellants’ waiver claims. Consequently, we reverse the trial\ncourt’s directed verdict against those claims.\n\n                                                    9\n\f                                        B. Sellers’s Testimony\n\n        Next, we consider the proffered testimony regarding Sellers’s purported belief that\n“the deal” required release of the lien upon full payment of the note.                           On appeal,\nappellants complain about two rulings made by the court below, specifically the\nsustaining of both a “legal conclusion” objection and a “speculation” objection during\ncross-examination of Sellers concerning Sellers’s understanding of the Extension and\nModification agreement.7 Appellants’ counsel asked Sellers, based on specific language\nin the agreement, “until when” were the liens to be extended? Opposing counsel objected\non the ground that the question called for a legal conclusion (i.e., interpretation of the\nparticular language in the agreement), and the trial court sustained the objection.\nBecause the question objected to was tied to the interpretation of a specific phrase in the\ncontract, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony.8\nAppellants’ counsel then abandoned that line of questioning.\n\n        Later, appellants’ counsel asked Sellers “if Mr. Comiskey had tendered full\npayment of that note at that time, would the bank have released this lien?” Opposing\ncounsel objected that the question called for “speculation,” and the trial court sustained\nthe objection. Because this particular question asked what 1st Choice would have done\nin a particular situation, rather than what Sellers would have done or recommended, the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the objection. Furthermore, appellant\ndid not offer any specific argument to the trial court, nor does so in its appellate brief, as\nto the propriety of the question at issue and whether it improperly called for speculation.\nSee Tex R. App. P. 38.1(i) (“The brief must contain a clear and concise argument for the\ncontentions made . . . .”).9 Because appellant has not demonstrated that the trial court\n\n        7\n         The trial court actually permitted much of this line of questioning over various objections by\nopposing counsel.\n        Appellants submitted an excerpt from Sellers’s deposition as an offer of proof of what Sellers\n        8\n\nwould have said had the trial court not excluded the evidence.\n        9\n           Although not mentioned by appellants in their briefing, counsel did ask one additional time\nregarding Sellers’s understanding of the agreement between the parties. Appellants’ counsel asked, “In\nthis time frame, sir, you understood that full payment of this note, the first lien note, would result in a full\n                                                      10\n\fcommitted any error in excluding Sellers’s testimony, we will not consider the proffered\ntestimony in our substantive analysis below.\n\n                            IV. Breach of Unambiguous Contract\n\n       In their fourth issue, appellants challenge the trial court’s finding that as a matter\nof law, FH Partners did not breach the parties’ unambiguous agreement. Appellants\ncontend the loan documents are ambiguous and that the interpretation of them, therefore,\nshould have been a matter for the jury. See Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex.\n1983) (explaining that when a contract contains an ambiguity, its interpretation becomes\na fact issue). According to appellants, the jury could have reasonably interpreted the\nambiguous agreement in their favor—as requiring FH Partners to release the Burkhart\nlien upon full payment of the $900,000 plus interest due on the Burkhart note. Because\nFH Partners clearly rejected Comiskey’s tendered final payment and refused to release\nthe lien, if the jury adopted appellant’s suggested interpretation, FH Partners would have\nbreached the contract. In granting the directed verdict, the trial court found that the\nagreement between the parties unambiguously included a cross-collateralization clause\nunder which the Burkhart property also secured other debts owed by Gomberg to FH\nPartners.\n\n       To prevail on a breach of contract claim, a plaintiff must prove (1) the existence of\na valid contract; (2) the plaintiff’s performance or tender of performance; (3) the\ndefendant’s breach; and (4) the plaintiff’s damages resulting from the breach. Roof Sys.\nInc. v. Johns Manville Corp., 130 S.W.3d 430 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004,\nno pet.). The interpretation or construction of an unambiguous contract is a matter of law\nto be determined by the court. Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d 154, 157\n(Tex. 2003). Whether a contract is ambiguous is also a question of law for the court.\n\n\nrelease of this lien; is that accurate?” Opposing counsel objected, “He’s already said the documents\ncontrol. And this is just going over the same—.” The trial court then cut off opposing counsel by\nsustaining his objection. Appellants’ counsel offered no response to the objection or defense of the\nquestion and moved on to questions concerning a document. The issue of whether the trial court erred in\nsustaining this objection is not preserved or presented for our review.\n                                                  11\n\fJ.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 229 (Tex. 2003). If a contract can be\ngiven a certain or definite legal meaning or interpretation, it is not ambiguous. Coker,\n650 S.W.2d at 391. Ambiguity does not arise simply because parties advance conflicting\ninterpretations of a contract. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Sturges, 52 S.W.3d 711, 728 (Tex.\n2001).\n\n         When interpreting a contract, our primary concern is to ascertain and give effect\nto the intent of the parties as expressed in the agreement. Seagull Energy E & P, Inc. v.\nEland Energy, Inc., 207 S.W.3d 342, 345 (Tex. 2006).           To discern this intent, we\nexamine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all of\nits provisions so that none will be rendered meaningless. Id. No single provision taken\nalone will be given controlling effect; rather, all the provisions must be considered with\nreference to the whole instrument. Id.\n\n         Appellants focus exclusively on language in the Extension and Modification. FH\nPartners contends that it incorporated and maintained in full force the Burkhart deed of\ntrust with its cross-collateralization, or “dragnet,” clause, and appellants contend that it\nextinguished the clause.     Appellants first note that the only indebtedness expressly\nmentioned in the Extension and Modification is the $900,000 owed on the loan for the\nBurkhart property. They then point to the following operative statement: “Undersigned\nhereby extends said liens on said property until said indebtedness and note as so renewed,\nmodified and extended has been fully paid.” Appellants contend that the provision for\nonly a $900,000 debt in the Extension and Modification in fact modified the amount\nrequired to be paid for a release of the lien, thus nullifying the cross-collateralization\nclause contained in the deed of trust.        According to appellants, since the only\nindebtedness mentioned in the Extension and Modification itself was on the Burkhart\nproperty, the reference to “indebtedness and note” in the operative statement must refer to\nthat and only that debt.\n\n         We agree with FH Partners’ and the trial court’s interpretation of the contract,\nhowever, and disagree with appellants that there was any ambiguity requiring\n\n                                            12\n\finterpretation by the jury. The Extension and Modification explains that “the purpose of\nthis instrument [is] simply to extend or rearrange the time or manner of payment of said\nnotes and indebtedness and to carry forward all liens securing the same . . . .” It further\nspecifically references the Burkhart note and deed of trust and states that their terms\n“remain in full force and effect . . . except as otherwise provided” in the Extension and\nModification.\n\n        The Extension and Modification does not expressly reference, much less\nextinguish, the cross-collateralization clause in the deed of trust.10 Appellants’ recitation\nof somewhat imprecise language in the Extension and Modification regarding\n“indebtedness” and “liens” does not convince us that there is any indication that the\nparties intended to nullify the cross-collateralization clause, particularly in light of the\nlanguage that the terms of the deed of trust were to remain in effect and the sole purpose\nof the Extension and Modification was to extend the time of payment and carry forward\nthe liens. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in ruling that the agreement between the\nparties unambiguously permitted enforcement of the cross-collateralization clause. We\noverrule appellants’ fourth issue.\n\n                               V. Mutual Mistake & Reformation\n\n        In their first issue, appellants contend, among other things discussed below, that\nthe evidence presented questions for the jury regarding whether there was a mutual\nmistake between the parties necessitating reformation of the contract and whether FH\nPartners breached the reformed contract. The underlying objective of reformation is to\ncorrect a mutual mistake made in preparing a written instrument, so that the instrument\ntruly reflects the original agreement of the parties. Cherokee Water, 741 S.W.2d at 379.\nThus, a party seeking reformation of a contract based on mutual mistake must prove: (1)\nan original agreement and (2) a mutual mistake, occurring after the original agreement, in\nreducing the original agreement to writing. See id. The mistake in reducing the original\n\n        10\n            Interestingly, in his trial testimony, Comiskey acknowledged that through the cross-\ncollateralization clause in the deed of trust, Gomberg’s other debts were secured by the Burkhart property.\n                                                    13\n\fagreement to writing must be by both parties. Valero Energy Corp. v. Teco Pipeline Co.,\n2 S.W.3d 576, 589 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.); United Interests,\nInc. v. Brewington, Inc., 729 S.W.2d 897, 903 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1987, writ\nref’d n.r.e.); see also Estes v. Republic Nat’l Bank of Dallas, 462 S.W.2d 273, 275 (Tex.\n1970) (stating that it is not enough that an agreement existed that was at variance with the\nwriting; the proponent must go further and “establish the fact that the terms or provisions\nof the writing which differ from the true agreement made were placed in the instrument\nby mutual mistake”). “A court is without power to make a contract that the parties did\nnot make; an actual agreement reached prior to the drafting of the instrument involved is\na prerequisite to an action for reformation.” Cherokee Water, 741 S.W.2d at 379. It is\nalso important to note that “[t]he doctrine of mutual mistake must not routinely be\navailable to avoid the result of an unhappy bargain.” Williams v. Glash, 789 S.W.2d 261,\n265 (Tex. 1990).\n\n       As evidence of mutual mistake, appellants point primarily to Comiskey’s proposed\ntestimony that Sellers told him that paying off the Burkhart note would result in release\nof the Burkhart lien. Based on this evidence, appellants suggest that Comiskey and 1st\nChoice both understood that this was the agreement. However, under the circumstances\nof this case, these alleged statements by Sellers do not establish that an agreement was\nreached between Comiskey and 1st Choice prior to the reduction of the agreement into\nwriting. Comiskey testified that he arrived at 1st Choice on the day the agreement was\nsigned expecting to receive a new and separate note of his own, replacing the one\nGomberg already had with 1st Choice.             He was then given the Extension and\nModification to sign, which had already been drafted before Comiskey and Gomberg\narrived at 1st Choice. Comiskey testified that Sellers told him that the Extension and\nModification was the only document he needed to review, and in his excluded testimony,\nComiskey would have stated that Sellers told him what “the deal” was between the\nparties.   Sellers denied making these representations to Comiskey.        However, even\nassuming, as we must, that Sellers made those representations, they were representations\n\n\n                                            14\n\fabout a document that already had been drafted but not yet signed; the statements did not\nconstitute contract negotiations or a meeting of the minds.11 Therefore, they are no\nevidence of mutual mistake. See Cherokee Water, 741 S.W.2d at 379 (explaining that\nmutual mistake concerns an actual agreement reached prior to the drafting of the written\ninstrument).12\n\n        Furthermore, the circumstances in this case are substantially similar to those the\nTexas Supreme Court addressed in Estes, 462 S.W.2d 273. In that case, the court held\nthat in the absence of a showing of “fraud or imposition,” mutual mistake cannot occur\nwhere one party did not even read the agreement before signing. Id. at 276. In other\nwords, the court reasoned that when one party does not read the contract, there cannot be\na mutual mistake in drafting the agreement absent fraud or duress. See id. Appellants do\nnot allege any form of duress or imposition.\n\n        The fraud exception referenced by the Estes court is often called “unilateral\nmistake.” See, e.g., Orix Capital Mkts., LLC v. La Villita Motor Inns, J.V., 329 S.W.3d\n30, 46 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2010, pet. denied); see also Cambridge Cos. v.\nWilliams, 602 S.W.2d 306, 308 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1980) (explaining unilateral\nmistake) (cited in Davis v. Grammer, 750 S.W.2d 766, 769 (Tex. 1988)), aff’d, 615\nS.W.2d 172 (Tex. 1981). In their briefing, appellants allege that the evidence presents a\nfact question as to whether there was a unilateral mistake on Comiskey’s part caused by\nfraud on the part of 1st Choice and FH Partners. Appellants do not cite, however, where\nthey raised this counterclaim or defense below, and our review has not revealed any\n\n        11\n           Sellers’s alleged representations also encompassed the deed of trust and note which preexisted, and were\nincorporated into, the Extension and Modification.\n        12\n           In Cherokee Water, the court explained that there could be no mutual mistake where the\ndocument in question was drafted before any alleged agreement occurred because the mistake must be in\nthe drafting of the agreement. 741 S.W.2d at 381. The court further clarified that the time of drafting is\nthe key and not the time of execution. Id. at 380.\n        Appellants additionally point to conduct by 1st Choice, and later FH Partners, which occurred\nwell after the Extension and Modification was signed, as evidence that both sides had a different\nunderstanding of what their agreement was than that contained in the written contract. This is also no\nevidence that an agreement was reached prior to the drafting and signing of the Extension and\nModification.\n                                                        15\n\fpreservation of this issue in the trial court. Accordingly, they cannot rely on this claim on\nappeal. See Orix Capital, 329 S.W.3d at 46; Loera v. Interstate Inv. Corp., 93 S.W.3d\n224, 228 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied). We overrule appellants’\nfirst issue to the extent it contends the trial court erred in not submitting the issue of\nreformation to the jury.\n\n                                       VI. Estoppel\n\n       Also in their first issue, appellants assert that the trial court erred in refusing to\nsubmit their promissory estoppel, equitable estoppel, and quasi-estoppel counterclaims\nand defenses to the jury. Specifically, appellants contend they presented a fact question\nregarding whether FH Partners was precluded, under these doctrines, from enforcing the\ncross-collateralization clause in the Burkhart deed of trust. We will address each of these\ndoctrines separately because their respective elements differ significantly.\n\n                                 A. Promissory Estoppel\n\n       Promissory estoppel is an equitable doctrine that ordinarily is used defensively to\nprevent “a party from insisting upon [its] strict legal rights when it would be unjust to\nallow [it] to enforce them.” Wheeler v. White, 398 S.W.2d 93, 96 (Tex. 1985). It\nrequires evidence of (1) a promise, (2) foreseeability of reliance, (3) actual, substantial,\nand reasonable reliance by the promisee to his or her detriment, and (4) that failure to\nenforce the promise would result in an injustice. In re Weekley Homes, L.P., 180 S.W.3d\n127, 133 (Tex. 2005); Collins v. Walker, 341 S.W.3d 570, 573–74 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.). To support a finding of promissory estoppel, the asserted\n“promise” must be sufficiently specific and definite that it would be reasonable and\njustified for the promisee to rely upon it as a commitment to future action. See Alpha\nVista, Inc. v. Holt, 987 S.W.2d 138, 141–42 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet.\ndenied). The “promise” also must be more than mere speculation concerning future\nevents, a statement of hope, or an expression of opinion, expectation, or assumption.\nEsty v. Beal Bank S.S.B., 298 S.W.3d 280, 305 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, no pet.).\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       Appellants support their promissory estoppel claim by pointing to (1) Sellers’s\nalleged statements that “the deal” between the parties was that full payment of the\nBurkhart note would result in release of the Burkhart lien; (2) the payoff quote provided\nby 1st Choice to Gomberg, which included the statement “please furnish release of lien”;\nand (3) FH Partners’ providing of an account balance without stating that Gomberg had\nother outstanding debts.13 Assuming without deciding that the evidence cited is proof of\npromises directly contradicting the terms of the agreement between the parties, there is no\nevidence that Comiskey reasonably relied on these promises. See Collins, 341 S.W.3d at\n573–74.\n\n       A party to an arm’s length transaction must exercise reasonable diligence in\nprotecting his own interests, and a failure to do so is not excused by mere confidence in\nthe honesty and integrity of the other party. Ortiz v. Collins, 203 S.W.3d 414, 422 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.); see also Thigpen v. Locke, 363 S.W.2d 247,\n251 (Tex. 1962) (fraud case). Appellants provide few arguments regarding Comiskey’s\nreliance or the reasonableness thereof. Instead, they essentially rely on the inference that\nbecause promises allegedly were made and Comiskey sold lots and paid the proceeds to\nthe successive owners of the Burkhart note, he must therefore have relied on the promises\nin doing so.14\n\n       The record reflects that Comiskey is a sophisticated businessman with significant\nexperience negotiating commercial contracts as well as real estate transactions and bank\nloans. See 1001 McKinney Ltd. v. Credit Suisse First Boston Mortg. Capital, 192 S.W.3d\n20, 30 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (explaining that the question\n\n       13\n          The balance in question was provided in email form and in response to an email request from\nComiskey asking specifically for “the outstanding balance on this note.” As discussed above, the email\nexchange was apparently in relation to a possible discrepancy in the loan balance. No specific payoff\nfigure was requested or given.\n       14\n           At no point in his testimony was Comiskey specifically asked about his alleged reliance on\npromises outside the written contract. At one point, he testified that he relied upon the Extension and\nModification agreement to protect his second lien in preference to the cross-collateralization of the\nproperty for Gomberg’s other debts. This interpretation of the written agreement, however, has not been\nmentioned in the appellate briefing.\n\n                                                  17\n\fof justifiable reliance often depends heavily on the relative sophistication of the parties);\nsee also BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Marshall, 342 S.W.3d 59, 68–69 (Tex. 2011) (considering\nsophistication of party in holding alleged reliance was not reasonable as a matter of\nlaw).15 He admitted that he did not fully read the Extension and Modification. Had he\nread it, he would have learned that, as discussed above, it referenced the note and deed of\ntrust and indicated that terms in those documents still governed the loan. Had he then\nread the deed of trust before signing the Extension and Modification, he would have seen\nthe cross-collateralization clause.16 Comiskey complained at trial that 1st Choice did not\nprovide him with copies of the deed of trust or the note; however, it is also clear from the\nevidence that (1) Comiskey was under no duress to sign the Extension and Modification\nwithout having read the deed of trust; (2) Comiskey did not refuse to sign without first\nseeing the deed of trust; (3) Comiskey also failed to obtain a copy of the document from\nGomberg, the other signatory; and (4) the deed of trust was filed in the public property\nrecords and thus available to Comiskey to view on his own.17\n\n        In summary, Comiskey was a relatively sophisticated person who by his own\nadmission signed on to an existing loan without fully reading the Extension and\nModification he was signing or even seeing the underlying and still largely controlling\nloan documents. In doing so, Comiskey did not act with reasonable diligence to protect\nhis own interests. See Swank v. Sverdlin, 121 S.W.3d 785, 802 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\nDist.] 2003, pet. denied) (holding that party, who failed to read contracts, could not\n\n        15\n          Comiskey testified that he has a degree in finance, has negotiated commercial contracts as a\nprofessional energy consultant, and has been involved in several prior real estate investments, each of\nwhich involved lenders.\n        16\n           Comiskey averred that had he read the cross-collateralization clause, he would not have\nunderstood it. But see R. Conrad Moore & Assocs., Inc. v. Lerma, 946 S.W.2d 90, 94 (Tex. App.—El\nPaso 1997, writ denied) (“A person who signs a contract is presumed to know and understand its\ncontents; absent a finding of fraud, failure to apprehend the rights and obligations under the contract will\nnot excuse performance.”). He further acknowledged that he should have consulted an attorney regarding\nthe transaction but did not.\n        17\n          Furthermore, Comiskey acknowledged in his own testimony at trial that he sold the third lot\nand paid the proceeds to FH Partners because he was “obligated to do so” under the Extension and\nModification agreement. He did not specifically say that he paid on the note based on any promises made\noutside and contradictory to the signed agreement.\n\n                                                    18\n\fjustifiably rely on alleged misrepresentations contrary to the terms of the contracts).\nConsequently, appellants have not raised a fact question on the element of reasonable\nreliance. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in directing a verdict against appellants’\npromissory estoppel claims.\n\n                                  B. Equitable Estoppel\n\n       Under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, a party is precluded, due to its voluntary\nconduct, from asserting rights it might otherwise possess against another person who has\nrelied on the party’s conduct to change his position for the worse. Royalco Oil & Gas\nCorp. v. Stockhome Trading Corp., No. 02-10-00455-CV, 2012 WL 254037, at *5 (Tex.\nApp.—Fort Worth 2012, no pet. h.). It requires evidence of (1) a false representation or\nconcealment of material facts, (2) made with actual or constructive knowledge of those\nfacts, (3) with the intention that it should be acted on, (4) to a party without knowledge,\nor the means of knowledge, of those facts, (5) who detrimentally relied upon the\nmisrepresentation. Johnson & Higgins of Tex., Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., 962 S.W.2d\n507, 515–16 (Tex. 1998).\n\n       In support of their equitable estoppel claim, appellants contend that 1st Choice and\nFH Partners knew the facts concerning the cross-collateralization clause and Gomberg’s\nother debts but concealed them from Comiskey and instead represented that payment of\nthe Burkhart debt would result in release of the Burkhart lien. They further state that\nhaving made representations about “the transaction and his debt,” 1st Choice and FH\nPartners had a duty to “tell him the full story and disclose the dragnet clause.” As for\nreliance, appellants again appear to rely on the inference that because Comiskey paid on\nthe Burkhart note, he must have done so in reliance on the representations by 1st Choice\nand FH Partners.\n\n       Appellants arguments, however, principally ignore the requirement that the party\nurging application of the equitable estoppel doctrine have been without the means of\nobtaining knowledge of the true facts. See Johnson & Higgins, 962 S.W.2d at 515–16.\nAlthough Comiskey testified that neither Gomberg nor 1st Choice provided him with a\n\n                                             19\n\fcopy of the deed of trust where the cross-collateralization clause could be found, he\nacknowledged that he did not insist on seeing a copy before signing the Extension and\nModification, and the record also reflects that the deed of trust was on file in the public\nproperty records prior to the Extension and Modification being signed.                        Appellants\nsuggest that Sellers kept appellant from obtaining knowledge of the “true facts” by\nsuggesting Comiskey did not need to review any other documents. Although this alleged\nstatement may have discouraged Comiskey from viewing the deed of trust before signing,\nit did not prevent him from doing so.18 Because Comiskey clearly had the means of\nknowledge regarding the existence of the cross-collateralization clause, the trial court did\nnot err in directing a verdict against appellants’ equitable estoppel claim. Simpson v.\nMBank Dallas, N.A., 724 S.W.2d 102, 108 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1987, writ ref’d n.r.e.)\n(affirming summary judgment where party claiming estoppel presented no evidence that\nhe was without means of knowledge concerning either the financial status of parties\nwhose loan he guaranteed or the effect of his guaranty).19\n\n\n\n        18\n          It is unclear to what extent appellants are contending that 1st Choice or FH Partners should\nhave informed Comiskey regarding Gomberg’s financial status. However, at the time Comiskey signed\nthe Extension and Modification, he knew that Gomberg had defaulted on payment of the promissory note\nto Comiskey himself. Furthermore, as FH Partners points out, Comiskey entered the bank with Gomberg\nto sign onto one of Gomberg’s loans. Appellants provide no argument as to why under those\ncircumstances, 1st Choice had a duty to inform Comiskey of Gomberg’s financial status.\n        19\n           In Simpson, similar to here, the party claiming estoppel admitted that he did not attempt to\nascertain the financial status of the parties whose loan he guaranteed but instead relied on the advice of\nanother. 724 S.W.2d at 108. Also in Simpson, the court explained that the claimant possessed the means\nto know the effect of his guarantee, in part, because he had signed prior similar guarantees with the same\nlender. Id.\n        In support of their arguments, appellants cite Alamo Bank of Texas v. Palacios, 804 S.W.2d 291\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1991, no writ), and Monumental Life Insurance Co. v. Hayes-Jenkins, 403\nF.3d 304 (5th Cir. 2005). Both are distinguishable from the present case. In Alamo Bank, the Corpus\nChristi Court of Appeals upheld a trial court’s estoppel finding where there was evidence that a bank\nrepresentative promised that the bank would not press criminal charges for forgery against a third party if\nPalacios signed a promissory note in favor of the bank. 804 S.W.2d at 295. However, at the time the\npromise was made, the bank already had reported the alleged forgery to the FBI. Id. There is no\ndiscussion in the opinion of whether Palacios had means of knowledge regarding the charges. Id.\n        In Monumental Life, the Fifth Circuit held that an issue of material fact was raised precluding\nsummary judgment where evidence suggested that insurance application instructions contained potentially\nmisleading statements on which a couple may have reasonably relied. 403 F.3d at 311–13. Again, there\n                                                    20\n\f                                        C. Quasi-Estoppel\n\n        Quasi-estoppel precludes a party from asserting, to another party’s disadvantage, a\nright inconsistent with a position previously taken; it applies only when it would be\nunconscionable to allow the party to maintain the inconsistent position. Lopez v. Munoz,\nHockema & Reed, L.L.P., 22 S.W.3d 857, 864 (Tex. 2000). Unlike equitable estoppel,\nquasi-estoppel requires no showing of misrepresentation or detrimental reliance. Eckland\nConsultants, Inc. v. Ryder, Stilwell Inc., 176 S.W.3d 80, 87 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\nDist.] 2004, no pet.).\n\n        Appellants’ argument is essentially that, with 1st Choice and FH Partners having\nmade representations, committed acts, and remained silent for months while Comiskey\ngradually paid off the Burkhart note under the belief that doing so would result in a full\nrelease of the Burkhart lien, FH Partners could not then assert the cross-collateralization\nclause and refuse to accept Comiskey’s final Burkhart payment and release the lien. As\nstated, in order to constitute quasi-estoppel, 1st Choice and FH Partners’ conduct had to\nhave been unconscionable. See, e.g., Doe v. Tex. Ass’n of Sch. Bds., Inc., 283 S.W.3d\n451, 464 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2009, pet. denied) (holding party who obtained money\nunder a settlement agreement was estopped from contending that she did not have\nauthority to provide the required consideration); Eckland Consultants, 176 S.W.3d at 81–\n83, 87–88 (holding that property inspector was estopped from claiming that a plaintiff did\nnot have standing to sue for a breach of the inspection contract when the company\naccepted the benefits of the contract and stated in a report that noncontracting entities\ncould rely on the report). The actions appellants complain of, even if true, were not\nunconscionable under the circumstances of this case.\n\n        As discussed above, none of 1st Choice’s or FH Partners’ statements or conduct\ndirectly contradicted the cross-collateralization clause or promised that it would not be\nenforced in the event of a default and subsequent lack of cooperation from Gomberg.\n\n\nis no discussion in the opinion regarding whether the couple had the means of knowledge regarding the\ntrue contents of the insurance policy, which they only received after their application was accepted. Id.\n                                                   21\n\fThus, it was not unconscionable for FH Partners to enforce the cross-collateralization\nclause. See Fasken Land & Minerals, Ltd. v. Occidental Permian Ltd., 225 S.W.3d 577,\n594 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2005, pet. denied) (holding it was not unconscionable for party\nto exercise its right under a contract). Ultimately, it was Comiskey’s own failure to read\nthe loan documents that caused any alleged disadvantage he suffered in the transaction.\nCf. Douglas v. Moody Gardens, Inc., No. 14-07-00016-CV, 2007 WL 4442617 at *4\n(Tex. App.—Houston Dec. 20, 2007, no pet.) (mem. op.) (rejecting quasi-estoppel claim\nand holding that workers’ compensation claimant’s failure to timely pursue claim, not\nemployer’s taking of inconsistent positions, was cause of denial of recovery). Comiskey\nmade payments on the Burkhart note as he was required to do under the Extension and\nModification agreement. FH Partners collected the benefits to which it was entitled\nunder the agreement (payment of principal and interest) and enforced the cross-\ncollateralization clause as it was entitled under the contract.20 It was not unconscionable\nfor FH Partners to accept benefits under the unambiguous contract. Consequently, the\ntrial court did not err in directing a verdict against appellants’ quasi-estoppel claim.\n\n                                                VII. Waiver\n\n        Appellants additionally assert in their first issue that the trial court erred in\ngranting a directed verdict because they presented more than a scintilla of evidence that\nFH Partners and its predecessor in interest, 1st Choice, waived the right to enforce the\n\n\n\n        20\n             In Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. City of Mont Belvieu, Texas, the Fifth Circuit explained that\n        “Rights expressly secured by contract” ordinarily cannot be “dissolve[d]” by quasi-\n        estoppel because a party may, pursuant to a contract and for legitimate reasons, have the\n        right to assert superficially inconsistent positions at different times. Neiman-Marcus\n        Group, Inc. v. Dworkin, 919 F.2d 368, 371 (5th Cir. 1990); Fasken Land & Minerals,\n        Ltd. v. Occidental Permian Ltd., 225 S.W.3d 577, 594 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2005,\n        petition denied) . . . . That party cannot “be equitably charged with choosing to accept\n        benefits in a manner genuinely inconsistent with his subsequent claim.” Neiman-Marcus,\n        919 F.2d at 371 (emphasis added). In such a case, the party has not acted to “avoid\n        corresponding obligations” but merely to assert its legal rights. Fasken, 225 S.W.3d at\n        593.\n611 F.3d 289, 298–99 (5th Cir. 2010) (first bracket omitted).\n\n                                                      22\n\fcross-collateralization clause.21 Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known,\nexisting right or intentional conduct inconsistent with claiming it. Jernigan v. Langley,\n111 S.W.3d 153, 156 (Tex. 2003). The affirmative defense of waiver can be established\nby a party’s express renunciation of a known right, by its conduct, or by silence or\ninaction for so long a period as to show an intention to yield the known right. See Aguiar\nv. Segal, 167 S.W.3d 443, 451 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.). A\nperson who does nothing inconsistent with an intent to rely upon a right does not waive\nthat right. Jernigan, 111 S.W.3d at 156. Waiver is ordinarily a question of fact, but\nwhen the surrounding facts and circumstances are undisputed, the question becomes one\nof law. WTG Gas Processing, L.P. v. ConocoPhillips Co., 309 S.W.3d 635, 648 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, pet. denied).                 We find that a fact issue existed\nregarding waiver, and thus, the trial court erred in directing a verdict against this claim.\n\n        As evidence of waiver, appellants point to (1) Comiskey’s proffered testimony that\nSellers told him both “before and after” they signed the Extension and Modification that\nfull payment of the Burkhart note would result in full release of the Burkhart lien; (2)\nSellers’s allegedly discouraging Comiskey from viewing the Burkhart note and deed of\ntrust by telling him that the Extension and Modification contained all of the key terms;\n(3) the issuance of partial releases by 1st Choice and FH Partners; (4) the pay-off\nstatement from 1st Choice which included the phrase “please furnish release of lien”; (5)\nalleged conversations involving Jeff Coupe, as representative of FH Partners, with\nComiskey and a representative of AllegianceBank, Dan Tralmer, who was attempting to\nset up a refinancing or buyout of the Burkhart note; and (6) 1st Choice and FH Partner’s\nfailure to inform Comiskey either that he would have to pay off Gomberg’s other debts in\norder to get clear title to the Burkhart property or exactly what other debts Gomberg had.\nWe will begin by addressing the evidence which will not support waiver; we will then\nexamine the evidence that created a fact issue on waiver.\n\n\n        21\n          Appellants explain in their briefing that their waiver claim was a defense to the declaratory\njudgment action and also supported their affirmative claims for unjust enrichment and breach of contract.\n\n                                                   23\n\f                                    A. Not Evidence of Waiver\n\n        Statements made and conduct occurring before signing the agreement could not\nconstitute waiver of terms in the agreement. See, e.g., Tri-Steel Structures, Inc. v. Baptist\nFound. of Tex., 166 S.W.3d 443, 451 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2005, pet. denied).\nLikewise, statements made contemporaneously with signing the agreement, and which\npurported to simply explain “the deal” that was being signed, would not constitute an\nexpress renunciation of a right contained in the document.                     Thus, Sellers’s alleged\nstatements at the time of signing the Extension and Modification, and his allegedly\ndiscouraging Comiskey from viewing the other loan documents, amount to no evidence\nof waiver.\n\n        Additionally, that 1st Choice and FH Partners had a practice of issuing partial\nreleases when parcels of the Burkhart property were sold, taken in isolation, was no\nevidence of waiver. The deed of trust itself provided for the granting of partial releases\n“without affecting the lien hereof against the remainder.”                   Furthermore, the partial\nreleases did no more than facilitate sale of the parcels in order to pay down the debt22;\nthus, by themselves, the partial releases neither demonstrated a clear intent to waive the\ncross-collateralization clause nor were inconsistent with assertion of the clause when\nComiskey attempted to pay the balance due on the Burkhart note and keep the final lot\nfor himself.\n\n        Lastly, appellants do not explain on what basis they claim 1st Choice or FH\nPartners had a duty to inform Comiskey regarding the nature of Gomberg’s other debts.\nSee generally Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i) (requiring briefs to contain argument for the\ncontentions raised); Brown v. Green, 302 S.W.3d 1, 14 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2009, no pet.) (declining to expand on party’s conclusory arguments). Comiskey entered\nthe bank with Gomberg and signed the Extension and Modification as a co-maker on\nGomberg’s preexisting note. Appellants cite no authority for the proposition that 1st\n\n        22\n           Evidence demonstrated that the vast majority of the proceeds from sale of the lots went to retire\nthe debt and very little, if any, was retained by Comiskey.\n\n                                                    24\n\fChoice or FH Partners had a duty to inform Comiskey about Gomberg’s other debts.23\nWithout such a duty, the failure to disclose is no evidence that 1st Choice or FH Partners\nwaived enforcement of the cross-collateralization clause.\n\n                                     B. More than a Scintilla\n\n        In the offer of proof responsive to the court’s exclusion of portions of Comiskey’s\ntestimony, appellants’ counsel represented that Comiskey would have testified that at\nsome point after the agreement was signed, Sellers told him full payment of the Burkhart\nnote would result in full release of the Burkhart lien.               Additionally, as mentioned,\nevidence was admitted regarding conversations between Coupe and Comiskey, and\nCoupe and Dan Tralmer, regarding a refinancing or buyout of the Burkhart note. These\nalleged statements and conversations, when taken together in light of the pay-off\nstatement and the assertion that neither 1st Choice nor FH Partners ever mentioned the\ncross-collateralization clause to Comiskey or Tralmer as a roadblock to full release of the\nlien, presented a fact question on the waiver claim.24 Of particular note, the pay-off\nstatement in question included the phrase “please furnish release of lien.”                      Sellers\nacknowledged that inclusion of such language on a pay-off statement typically indicated\nthat a bank was expecting to release a lien once the specified amount was paid. This\nlanguage, taken together with the alleged statements, conversations, and silence regarding\nthe clause itself, presents at least some evidence of an intention to yield a known right.\n        23\n           FH Partners suggests that informing Comiskey about Gomberg’s debt would have run contrary\nto certain banking laws, citing Tex. Fin. Code § 59.006. We need take no position on whether this is\ncorrect under the circumstances of this case.\n        24\n           Again, taken in isolation, the conversations between Coupe and Comiskey and Coupe and\nTralmer are were not enough to raise a fact issue; it is only when considered together that the evidence\ncreates a fact issue on waiver. Specifically concerning these conversations, the record shows that Coupe\nspoke to Comiskey about Comiskey’s plans to sell off several lots, pay off the note, and then build a\nhouse on the final Burkhart lot. However, at no point in the testimony are any specific promises or\nwaivers by Coupe mentioned. Coupe himself testified that he talked with Comiskey to try to figure out\nwhy Comiskey was involved with the loan because “[i]t just didn’t seem to make much sense.” Coupe\nsaid that he did not realize Comiskey expected a release if the note was fully paid. Similarly, the\ntestimony regarding Coupe’s discussions with Tralmer reveals, at most, negotiations regarding a possible\nrefinancing or buyout of the Burkhart note, but the conversations never resulted in any such buyout, much\nless any express renunciation of the cross-collateralization clause.\n\n\n                                                   25\n\fSee Aguiar, 167 S.W.3d at 451. It also is some evidence of conduct inconsistent with an\nintent to rely upon the right of cross-collateralization. See Jernigan, 111 S.W.3d at 156.\n\n        We sustain appellants’ first issue to the extent appellants contend the trial court\nerred in directing a verdict against their waiver claims.25 However, we overrule the first\nissue to the extent appellants allege the trial court erred by directing a verdict against\ntheir mutual mistake or estoppel contentions.\n\n                                             VIII. Fraud\n\n        In their third issue, appellants contend there was evidence to support submission to\nthe jury of their fraud, fraudulent concealment, and fraudulent inducement counterclaims\nagainst FH Partners. Under these counterclaims, appellants sought actual and exemplary\ndamages against FH Partners. Fraud requires a showing of a material misrepresentation,\nwhich (1) was false, (2) was either known to be false when made or was asserted without\nknowledge of the truth, (3) was intended to be acted upon, (4) was relied upon, and (5)\ncaused injury. DeSantis v. Wackenhut Corp., 793 S.W.2d 670, 688 (Tex. 1990). Silence\nwhen there is a duty to speak may equate to a misrepresentation of material facts. Ho v.\nUT Arlington, 984 S.W.2d 672, 691 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1998, pet. denied) (explaining\nthat a duty to speak may exist when the parties are in a fiduciary relationship or when a\nparty later discovers that a material representation it made was untrue). To support a\nclaim of fraud, reliance on a misrepresentation must be justifiable and reasonable. See\n\n\n\n        25\n           In the trial court, FH Partners pleaded application of the statute of frauds in response to\nappellants’ counterclaims; however, at no point in the trial court or on appeal has FH Partners contended\nthat the application of the statute defeats appellants’ waiver claim. Moreover, it does not appear that FH\nPartners established such a defense as a matter of law. For the statute in question, Texas Business and\nCommerce Code section 26.02, to apply, the financial institution must have given conspicuous notice to\nthe debtor or obligor in a writing signed by the debtor or obligor. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 26.02(e).\nThe Extension and Modification signed by Comiskey did not include this required notice. Appellants\nalso claimed that the subsequent waiver was evidenced by writings (the partial releases and payoff quote)\nand thus was not an oral modification barred by the statute of frauds, and that Comiskey partially\nperformed based on the alleged waiver, which is an exception to the statute of frauds. See Bank of Tex.,\nN.A. v. Gaubert, 286 S.W.3d 546, 553-54 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, pet. dism’d w.o.j.) (discussing partial\nperformance exception to statute of frauds).\n\n\n                                                   26\n\fAtl. Lloyds Ins. Co. v. Butler, 137 S.W.3d 199, 226 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n2004, pet. denied) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 531 (1977)).\n\n        As evidence of fraud, Comiskey cites (1) Coupe’s email stating the Burkhart note\nbalance, (2) the partial release issued by FH Partners for the sale of a portion of the\nBurkhart property, and (3) FH Partners’ failure to disclose Gomberg’s other debts and the\nfact they were tied to release of the lien on the Burkhart property.                     According to\nComiskey’s version, FH Partners led him along, taking his payments on the Burkhart\nnote, and then refused to accept final payment and release the lien.\n\n        In their briefing, appellants state that Coupe told Comiskey in an email that “the\nBurkhart note could be paid off for $87,174.53.” The email in question, however, only\nresponded to an email request from Comiskey for a balance amount on the Burkhart note;\nnothing was said by either party to the emails about a payoff of the note.26 The record\nfurther reflects that the correspondence concerned an alleged discrepancy in the balance,\napparently owing to the fact that Comiskey had given a check to Gomberg to take to the\nbank to pay on the note and some of the funds got misapplied. Corrections were made.\nThe email contained no representation that if the amount was paid, a release of lien would\nissue; it merely provided the information Comiskey requested: the balance on the\nBurkhart note.\n\n        As for the partial release issued by FH Partners for one of the lots sold from the\nBurkhart property, there is no evidence that the statements therein are untrue. Standing\nalone, this document makes no material misrepresentations which could be a basis for a\nfinding of fraud. It merely provided a partial release of lien, which was authorized under\nthe deed of trust and was a prerequisite for sale of the lot. Appellants suggest, though,\n\n        26\n           In an email dated June 6, 2008, Comiskey asked Coupe “What is the outstanding balance on\nthis note per your records?” Coupe responded the same day with an email stating a principal balance,\naccrued interest, and total for the note. Coupe further said that he needed to confirm the accuracy of the\nfigures because the “asset” had just been uploaded on the system. On June 13, after sale of one of the\nBurkhart lots, Comiskey again emailed Coupe: “Have you had a chance to review the balance on this\nyet? It was my belief we had a difference.” Coupe responded three days later, providing an attachment\nshowing payment and balance history for the note. He further stated “I am showing a current balance of\n$87,174.53.”\n                                                   27\n\fthat it “could [have] further[ed] Comiskey’s preexisting belief that payment of the last\nsum remaining on the note would discharge the lien.” However, assuming this allegation\ncould be a basis for a fraud claim, appellants cite no evidence that FH Partners was aware\nthat Comiskey had such a preexisting belief; appellants further cite no evidence that FH\nPartners intended for Comiskey to rely on the partial release in continuing to pay on the\ndebt.\n\n        Lastly, appellants complain that FH Partners never disclosed that Gomberg’s other\nloans were secured by the Burkhart property. But, as discussed above, appellants offer\nno basis for imposing a duty on FH Partners to supply that information. See generally\nTex. R. App. P. 38.1(i); Brown, 302 S.W.3d at 14. Because the evidence cited by\nappellants does not raise a material issue of fact supporting their fraud counterclaim, we\noverrule their third issue.\n\n                                 IX. Fair Market Value\n\n        In issue five, appellants contend that the trial court erred in entering a directed\nverdict against their breach of contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment counterclaims\nbecause there was evidence that FH Partners wrongfully refused to credit appellants with\nthe fair market value of the Drury property. Gomberg owned the Drury property and\ndefaulted on a balance of over $1.4 million owed to FH Partners for purchase of the\nproperty. FH Partners thereafter foreclosed on the Drury property and then credited the\n$850,000 sales price it paid for the property at foreclosure against the debts owed by\nGomberg and secured by the cross-collateralization clause in the Burkhart deed of trust.\nAppellants contend, however, that there was evidence that the fair market value of the\nDrury property was closer to $1.5 million, which sum should have been credited against\nGomberg’s debts. According to appellants, if the fair market value had been credited\nagainst Gomberg’s debts, there would have been no need to foreclose on the Burkhart\nproperty because there would not have been an outstanding balance on the Drury loan.\n\n        In support of their contention, appellants cite sections 51.003, 51.004, and 51.005\nof the Texas Property Code. Tex. Prop. Code §§ 51.003–.005. These sections permit a\n\n                                            28\n\fperson obligated for indebtedness, and against whom a post-foreclosure deficiency is\nsought, to offset the fair market value of the property foreclosed upon against the amount\nowed if the fair market value is greater than the actual foreclosure proceeds.                  Id.\nAppellants acknowledge, however, that they were not makers or guarantors of the note on\nthe Drury property and FH Partners did not seek to recover a foreclosure deficiency\nagainst them; thus, they cannot make a claim directly under those code sections.27 Other\nthan suggesting that this court apply the “spirit” of the Property Code to the facts of this\ncase, appellants do not cite any authority or make any particular argument suggesting\nthese code provisions can be used in this manner. We decline to apply the provisions\nbeyond the boundaries set by the legislature. See generally St. Luke’s Episcopal Hosp. v.\nAgbor, 952 S.W.2d 503, 505 (Tex. 1997) (explaining that courts must interpret statutes as\nwritten and are not themselves law-making bodies); Consol. Reinforcement, L.P. v.\nCarothers Exec. Homes, Ltd., 271 S.W.3d 887, 892 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, no pet.)\n(“It is not the function of this Court to expand the scope of [a statute] beyond the\nlegislature’s intent as expressed in the statute’s plain language.”). Accordingly, we\noverrule appellants’ fifth issue.\n\n                                         X. Conclusion\n\n         We reverse the trial court’s grant of a directed verdict on appellants’ waiver claim.\nBecause we reverse on this substantive issue, we also reverse the award of attorney’s fees\nfavoring FH Partners and need not reach appellants’ sixth issue complaining about FH\nPartners’ failure to properly segregate its fees.

Comiskey, III a/k/a\nTrey Comiskey. The crux of the dispute between the parties is FH Partners’ enforcement\nof the cross-collateralization clause in a loan agreement. Although Comiskey was not\noriginally a party to the agreement, he signed an Extension and Modification of the\nagreement along with the original debtor. After the original debtor defaulted on other\nloans, FH Partners used the cross-collateralization clause to foreclose on property that the\ndebtor had deeded to Comiskey’s company, TC3, Inc.              In six issues, appellants,\nComiskey and TC3, contend (1) they presented more than a scintilla of evidence\n\fsupporting various theories of waiver, estoppel, and mutual mistake that bar FH Partners\nfrom enforcing the cross-collateralization clause, (2) the trial court erred in excluding\ntestimony regarding the purpose of the agreement Comiskey signed, (3) they presented\nmore than a scintilla of evidence that FH Partners committed fraud, (4) the court erred in\ndetermining that the loan documents unambiguously permit enforcement of the cross-\ncollaterization clause, (5) the court erred in refusing to take into consideration the fair\nmarket value of foreclosed property in determining the merit of certain counterclaims,\nand (6) the court erred in its award of attorney’s fees because FH Partners failed to\nsegregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.\n\n       We reverse the trial court’s grant of a directed verdict on appellants’ waiver claim\nand, consequently, the award of attorney’s fees to FH Partners. We affirm the remainder\nof the judgment.\n\n                                             I. Background\n\n       The connection between Comiskey and FH Partners runs through Paul Gomberg,\nwho was a debtor to FH Partners and a business associate of Comiskey. By May 2008,\nGomberg had several loans with 1st Choice Bank, a predecessor in interest to FH\nPartners. One of the transactions involved a purchase money loan for $1.365 million to\npurchase real property on Drury Street in Houston, Texas, and the other was a purchase\nmoney loan of $900,000 for property in an area known as “Burkhart Forest.”                                  In\nassociation with both of these notes, Gomberg executed deeds of trust to pledge the\nrespective properties as collateral.              These deeds of trust also contained cross-\ncollateralization or “dragnet” clauses that made each property security for all of\nGomberg’s indebtedness to the beneficiary of the deeds of trust (at the time, 1st Choice).1\n\n\n       1\n           For example, the deed of trust for the Burkhart property includes language stating as follows:\n\n       This conveyance is made in trust . . . for the purpose of securing and enforcing the\n       payment of a certain promissory note . . . executed by Grantor [Gomberg] and payable to\n       the order of 1ST CHOICE BANK, (hereinafter, together with any subsequent holder of\n       the Note, called “Beneficiary”[)] . . . all renewals, rearrangements, extensions and/or\n       modifications of the Note; and all other sums of money which may be hereafter paid or\n                                                      2\n\f       Gomberg used the Burkhart loan to buy the Burkhart property from GHC3\nDevelopment, a corporation owned by Comiskey. The purchase price was $1.2 million;\nGomberg paid $900,000 from proceeds of the 1st Choice loan and gave GHC3 a\npromissory note for the remainder. The promissory note also was secured by a second\nlien on the Burkhart property.          Apparently, Gomberg intended to sell the Burkhart\nproperty to a local developer, but when that sale fell through and it appeared that\nGomberg would be unable to make payment on the promissory note, Gomberg executed a\ndeed in lieu of foreclosure, conveying the Burkhart property to TC3, a separate\ncorporation wholly owned by Comiskey. That transaction, however, did not extinguish\nthe debt owed to 1st Choice or 1st Choice’s first lien on the Burkhart property.\n\n       On February 19, 2008, Gomberg and Comiskey went to 1st Choice’s offices where\nboth signed an “Extension and Modification” of the Burkhart note. This Extension and\nModification, and the circumstances surrounding its execution, are the focus of the\npresent litigation.\n\n       The Burkhart note was originally scheduled to mature on January 18, 2008. Under\nthe terms of the Extension and Modification, Gomberg and Comiskey promised to pay\nthe principal amount of the note ($900,000) plus 8% interest. The interest was due in six\nmonthly payments beginning February 18, 2008, and the principal balance was due at\nmaturity on July 18, 2008. FH Partners contends that it incorporated and maintained in\nfull force the Burkhart deed of trust with its cross-collateralization, or “dragnet,” clause,\nand appellants contend that it extinguished the clause. A key dispute between the parties\n\n\n\n       advanced by or on behalf of Beneficiary under the terms and provisions of this Deed of\n       Trust; any additional loans made by Beneficiary to Grantors; and any and all other\n       indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of any kind of Grantors to Beneficiary, now or\n       hereafter existing, absolute or contingent, joint and/or several, secured or unsecured, due\n       or not due, arising by operation of law, including indebtedness, obligations and liabilities\n       to Beneficiary of Grantors as a member of any partnership, syndicate, association or other\n       group, and whether incurred by Grantors as principal, surety, endorser, guarantor,\n       accommodation party or otherwise, and whether originally contracted with Beneficiary or\n       acquired by Beneficiary pursuant to a loan participation agreement or otherwise (all of\n       which are hereinafter referred to as the “Indebtedness”). (Emphasis added.)\n                                                    3\n\frevolves around interpretation of the following paragraph in the Extension and\nModification:\n\n       And the Undersigned [Gomberg and Comiskey] hereby extends said liens\n       on said property until said indebtedness and note as so renewed, modified\n       and extended has been fully paid, and agreed that such extension or\n       rearrangement shall in no manner affect or impair said note or the liens\n       securing the same and that said liens shall not in any manner be waived, the\n       purpose of this instrument being simply to extend or rearrange the time or\n       manner of payment of said notes and indebtedness and to carry forward all\n       liens securing the same, which are acknowledged by the Undersigned to be\n       valid and subsisting, and the Undersigned further agree that all terms and\n       provisions of said original note and of the instrument or instruments\n       creating or fixing the liens securing the same shall be and remain in full\n       force and effect as therein written, except as otherwise expressly provided\n       herein.\nThe parties’ arguments regarding this paragraph will be discussed in detail below.\n\n       Bill Sellers, a senior vice president of 1st Choice, signed the Extension and\nModification on behalf of 1st Choice. There is no dispute that Comiskey signed the\nExtension and Modification; however, at trial, there was conflicting testimony regarding\nthe circumstances under which Comiskey signed the agreement. Comiskey testified that\nhe asked 1st Choice’s representative, Sellers, about the Burkhart note itself but it was not\nproduced at the meeting. According to Comiskey, Sellers represented that “the key terms\nof what would be our relationship going forward were in that three-page document [the\nExtension and Modification].” Comiskey said that the terms he was interested in were\nthe interest rate and term of the loan. Comiskey had previously requested a copy of the\nBurkhart note from Gomberg, but Gomberg had failed to comply with Burkhart’s request.\nLater in his testimony, Comiskey stated it was his understanding that if he paid off the\nnote, title to the Burkhart property would be released to him. He said that he came to this\nconclusion in part because of discussions he had with Sellers. When asked what Sellers\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fsaid to make him think this, defense counsel objected on hearsay grounds and the trial\ncourt sustained the objection.2\n\n        In the offer of proof, Comiskey’s attorney indicated that, had he been permitted to\nanswer the question, Comiskey would have explained that Sellers told him the Extension\nand Modification was the only document he needed to review and full payment of the\nnote would result in a full release of 1st Choice’s lien on the property. Further according\nto the attorney, Comiskey would have testified that Sellers made these statements both\nbefore and after the Extension and Modification was signed. However, Comiskey also\nacknowledged in his trial testimony that he did not read all of the Extension and\nModification or any of the Burkhart note or deed of trust, which were referenced in the\nExtension and Modification.\n\n        Sellers and Gomberg both testified that contact between Sellers and Comiskey was\nlimited and no representations were made about any other documents.                             Gomberg,\nhowever, acknowledged that he was not in Comiskey’s presence the entire time on the\nday in question when they were at 1st Choice.3\n\n        Comiskey subdivided the Burkhart property into several lots and began selling\nindividual lots. When the first two lots sold, 1st Choice granted partial releases of its lien\non those particular parcels and the majority of sale proceeds was allocated to reduce the\nbalance on the Burkhart note.4 On May 23, 2008, all of Gomberg’s 1st Choice debt,\nincluding the Burkhart and Drury notes, was purchased by FH Partners. As the date of\nthe debt sale approached, Comiskey contacted AllegianceBank about the possibility of\nobtaining another loan to pay off the Burkhart note. Allegiance requested the current\nbalance from 1st Choice, and 1st Choice responded with a payoff quote addressed to\n\n        2\n             In their second issue, appellants specifically complain about the court’s sustaining of this\nobjection.\n        3\n          Gomberg stated that he stepped away from Comiskey for a brief period of time to transact other\nbusiness at the bank. There is no indication in the record that Gomberg left Comiskey with Sellers or that\nSellers and Comiskey had any contact outside of Gomberg’s presence on the day in question.\n        4\n          The Burkhart deed of trust specifically authorized the granting of partial releases “without\naffecting the lien hereof against the remainder.”\n                                                     5\n\fGomberg, which included the following language: “PLEASE FURNISH RELEASE OF\nLIEN.” Sellers testified that such language typically indicated a bank was expecting to\nrelease a lien once the indicated amount was paid. Comiskey never obtained the loan\nfrom Allegiance.\n\n       After FH Partners purchased the notes, Jeff Coupe, a senior vice president for First\nCity Servicing Corp., which managed Gomberg’s notes for FH Partners, communicated\nwith Comiskey about paying off the Burkhart note.          When Comiskey sold another\nsubdivided lot in the Burkhart property, FH Partners issued a partial release of its lien to\nfacilitate the sale. At some point, an apparent discrepancy arose regarding the balance on\nthe Burkhart note when Comiskey gave Gomberg a check to pay on the note, but the\nfunds were misapplied.      In the midst of this complication, Comiskey requested a\nstatement and Coupe responded that the balance was $87,174.53.\n\n       In late April 2008, Gomberg went into default on his purchase money loan for the\nDrury property. Evidence reflects that he was cooperative through that summer in trying\nto pay the loan, but in August 2008, negotiations between Gomberg and First City (as FH\nPartners’ representative) broke down, and FH Partners decided to foreclose on the Drury\nproperty.   In that same month, Comiskey again requested a payoff amount on the\nBurkhart property, and First City informed him that the Burkhart property was subject to\ncross-collateralization obligations for debt on which Gomberg was then in default and\nthat these other obligations would have to be satisfied before the lien on the Burkhart\nproperty could be released. Comiskey apparently attempted to pay the remaining balance\non the Burkhart note but FH Partners rejected the payment. FH Partners then foreclosed\non the last remaining subdivided lot from the Burkhart property.\n\n       Thereafter, FH Partners brought a declaratory judgment action to establish that it\nhad not breached the contract between the parties. Comiskey then raised numerous\ndefenses and counterclaims, including variations of waiver, estoppel, fraud, breach of\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fcontract, mutual mistake, and unjust enrichment.5 After presentation of the evidence but\nbefore the jury was charged, the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of FH\nPartners. The court then entered a declaratory judgment that FH Partners did not breach\nthe contract between the parties. Appellants now bring this appeal.\n\n        We begin our analysis by addressing appellants’ evidentiary complaints under\nissue two. We will then consider the breach-of-an-unambiguous-contract contention\nraised in issue four, the mutual mistake, estoppel, and waiver claims raised in issue one,\nand the fraud claim raised in issue three. Lastly, we will consider the fair market value\ncontention raised in issue five and the attorney’s fees complaint raised in issue six.\n\n                                     II. Standard of Review\n\n        Appellants primarily seek reversal of the trial court’s granting of a directed verdict\nfavoring FH Partners. We review the grant of a directed verdict under the usual standards\nfor assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence. See City of Keller v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987708/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 821–28 (Tex. 2005). We examine the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the party against whom the verdict was directed, and we determine whether there is\nany evidence of probative value to raise a material fact issue on the question presented.\nSee Bostrom Seating, Inc. v. Crane Carrier Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894533\"><a href=\"/opinion/894533/bostrom-seating-inc-v-crane-carrier-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684 (Tex. 2004). We\ncredit favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could and disregard contrary evidence\nunless reasonable jurors could not. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827.\n\n                                  III. Evidentiary Complaints\n\n        We first address appellants’ challenges to evidentiary rulings made by the trial\ncourt to determine whether we can appropriately consider certain evidence in analyzing\nappellants’ substantive contentions. Under issue two, appellants specifically complain\nabout exclusion of (1) Comiskey’s testimony that Sellers told him that full payment of the\nBurkhart note would result in full release of the Burkhart lien, and (2) Sellers’s testimony\n\n        5\n         Appellants initially raised claims against Gomberg and other entities as third-party defendants,\nbut those claims were nonsuited or otherwise disposed of prior to trial. Appellants also raised other\ncounterclaims against FH Partners that are not raised as grounds for reversal in this appeal.\n                                                   7\n\fthat “the deal” was that if the note were paid in full, the lien would be released. To\npreserve error in the exclusion of evidence, a party must (1) attempt during the\nevidentiary portion of the trial to introduce the evidence; (2) if an objection is lodged,\nspecify the purpose for which the evidence is offered and give the trial court reasons why\nthe evidence is admissible; (3) obtain a ruling from the court; and (4) if the court rules the\nevidence inadmissible, make a record of the evidence the party desires admitted.

Sellers’s Alleged Representations\n\n       We turn first to the excluded testimony from Comiskey regarding alleged\nrepresentations by Sellers. During direct examination, Comiskey’s counsel asked him\nwhy he thought that if he paid off the Burkhart note the lien would be released.\nComiskey answered, in part, that his belief was based on “[d]iscussions . . . with Mr.\nSellers.” Counsel next asked, “What did Mr. Sellers say that made you think this was the\ndeal?” Opposing counsel then raised a hearsay objection, which the trial court sustained.\nIn response, appellant’s counsel pointed out that the question and expected answer went\nto Comiskey’s state of mind when he acted in reliance on the statement. Counsel also\nexplained that the statement was relevant to the intent of the parties in making the\nagreement and was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Later, counsel\nsubmitted an offer of proof, indicating Comiskey would have testified that Sellers stated,\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fboth before and after the signing of the Extension and Modification, that full payment of\nthe note would result in full release of the lien.\n\n        On appeal, appellants argue that the proffered testimony concerned “operative\nfacts” and therefore was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted in Sellers’s\nalleged statements; in other words, the testimony was admissible as evidence that Sellers\nmade the statements, regardless of whether the statements were true. See 2 Steven Goode\net al., Texas Practice Series: Guide to the Texas Rules of Evidence § 801.2 (3d ed. 2002)\n(discussing nonhearsay utterances including “operative facts”). For example, in proving\nelements of estoppel, testimony that a promise was made would not be hearsay because\nrelevance of the testimony is not dependent on the truth of the statement but on the fact\nthat it was made.

Because Comiskey’s\ntestimony was offered as proof that Sellers made certain statements, and not to establish\nthe truth of the matter asserted in the statements themselves, we agree that the proffered\ntestimony was not hearsay. We hold the trial court abused its discretion by excluding it.\nAccordingly, we will consider the excluded testimony where appropriate in our\nsubstantive analysis but reverse only if the evidentiary error was harmful. See Caffe Ribs,\nInc. v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2284558\"><a href=\"/opinion/2284558/caffe-ribs-inc-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 927, 931 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.).6\n\n\n\n\n        6\n          As will be explained in detail below, the excluded testimony was an integral part of the evidence\nestablishing a fact question regarding appellants’ waiver claims. Consequently, we reverse the trial\ncourt’s directed verdict against those claims.\n\n                                                    9\n\f                                        B. Sellers’s Testimony\n\n        Next, we consider the proffered testimony regarding Sellers’s purported belief that\n“the deal” required release of the lien upon full payment of the note.                           On appeal,\nappellants complain about two rulings made by the court below, specifically the\nsustaining of both a “legal conclusion” objection and a “speculation” objection during\ncross-examination of Sellers concerning Sellers’s understanding of the Extension and\nModification agreement.7 Appellants’ counsel asked Sellers, based on specific language\nin the agreement, “until when” were the liens to be extended? Opposing counsel objected\non the ground that the question called for a legal conclusion (i.e., interpretation of the\nparticular language in the agreement), and the trial court sustained the objection.\nBecause the question objected to was tied to the interpretation of a specific phrase in the\ncontract, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony.8\nAppellants’ counsel then abandoned that line of questioning.\n\n        Later, appellants’ counsel asked Sellers “if Mr. Comiskey had tendered full\npayment of that note at that time, would the bank have released this lien?” Opposing\ncounsel objected that the question called for “speculation,” and the trial court sustained\nthe objection. Because this particular question asked what 1st Choice would have done\nin a particular situation, rather than what Sellers would have done or recommended, the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the objection. Furthermore, appellant\ndid not offer any specific argument to the trial court, nor does so in its appellate brief, as\nto the propriety of the question at issue and whether it improperly called for speculation.\nSee Tex R. App. P. 38.1(i) (“The brief must contain a clear and concise argument for the\ncontentions made . . . .”).9 Because appellant has not demonstrated that the trial court\n\n        7\n         The trial court actually permitted much of this line of questioning over various objections by\nopposing counsel.\n        Appellants submitted an excerpt from Sellers’s deposition as an offer of proof of what Sellers\n        8\n\nwould have said had the trial court not excluded the evidence.\n        9\n           Although not mentioned by appellants in their briefing, counsel did ask one additional time\nregarding Sellers’s understanding of the agreement between the parties. Appellants’ counsel asked, “In\nthis time frame, sir, you understood that full payment of this note, the first lien note, would result in a full\n                                                      10\n\fcommitted any error in excluding Sellers’s testimony, we will not consider the proffered\ntestimony in our substantive analysis below.\n\n                            IV. Breach of Unambiguous Contract\n\n       In their fourth issue, appellants challenge the trial court’s finding that as a matter\nof law, FH Partners did not breach the parties’ unambiguous agreement. Appellants\ncontend the loan documents are ambiguous and that the interpretation of them, therefore,\nshould have been a matter for the jury. See Coker v. Coker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1502612\"><a href=\"/opinion/1502612/coker-v-coker/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 394 (Tex.\n1983) (explaining that when a contract contains an ambiguity, its interpretation becomes\na fact issue). According to appellants, the jury could have reasonably interpreted the\nambiguous agreement in their favor—as requiring FH Partners to release the Burkhart\nlien upon full payment of the $900,000 plus interest due on the Burkhart note. Because\nFH Partners clearly rejected Comiskey’s tendered final payment and refused to release\nthe lien, if the jury adopted appellant’s suggested interpretation, FH Partners would have\nbreached the contract. In granting the directed verdict, the trial court found that the\nagreement between the parties unambiguously included a cross-collateralization clause\nunder which the Burkhart property also secured other debts owed by Gomberg to FH\nPartners.\n\n       To prevail on a breach of contract claim, a plaintiff must prove (1) the existence of\na valid contract; (2) the plaintiff’s performance or tender of performance; (3) the\ndefendant’s breach; and (4) the plaintiff’s damages resulting from the breach.

To discern this intent, we\nexamine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all of\nits provisions so that none will be rendered meaningless. Id. No single provision taken\nalone will be given controlling effect; rather, all the provisions must be considered with\nreference to the whole instrument. Id.\n\n         Appellants focus exclusively on language in the Extension and Modification. FH\nPartners contends that it incorporated and maintained in full force the Burkhart deed of\ntrust with its cross-collateralization, or “dragnet,” clause, and appellants contend that it\nextinguished the clause.     Appellants first note that the only indebtedness expressly\nmentioned in the Extension and Modification is the $900,000 owed on the loan for the\nBurkhart property. They then point to the following operative statement: “Undersigned\nhereby extends said liens on said property until said indebtedness and note as so renewed,\nmodified and extended has been fully paid.” Appellants contend that the provision for\nonly a $900,000 debt in the Extension and Modification in fact modified the amount\nrequired to be paid for a release of the lien, thus nullifying the cross-collateralization\nclause contained in the deed of trust.        According to appellants, since the only\nindebtedness mentioned in the Extension and Modification itself was on the Burkhart\nproperty, the reference to “indebtedness and note” in the operative statement must refer to\nthat and only that debt.\n\n         We agree with FH Partners’ and the trial court’s interpretation of the contract,\nhowever, and disagree with appellants that there was any ambiguity requiring\n\n                                            12\n\finterpretation by the jury. The Extension and Modification explains that “the purpose of\nthis instrument [is] simply to extend or rearrange the time or manner of payment of said\nnotes and indebtedness and to carry forward all liens securing the same . . . .” It further\nspecifically references the Burkhart note and deed of trust and states that their terms\n“remain in full force and effect . . . except as otherwise provided” in the Extension and\nModification.\n\n        The Extension and Modification does not expressly reference, much less\nextinguish, the cross-collateralization clause in the deed of trust.10 Appellants’ recitation\nof somewhat imprecise language in the Extension and Modification regarding\n“indebtedness” and “liens” does not convince us that there is any indication that the\nparties intended to nullify the cross-collateralization clause, particularly in light of the\nlanguage that the terms of the deed of trust were to remain in effect and the sole purpose\nof the Extension and Modification was to extend the time of payment and carry forward\nthe liens. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in ruling that the agreement between the\nparties unambiguously permitted enforcement of the cross-collateralization clause. We\noverrule appellants’ fourth issue.\n\n                               V. Mutual Mistake & Reformation\n\n        In their first issue, appellants contend, among other things discussed below, that\nthe evidence presented questions for the jury regarding whether there was a mutual\nmistake between the parties necessitating reformation of the contract and whether FH\nPartners breached the reformed contract. The underlying objective of reformation is to\ncorrect a mutual mistake made in preparing a written instrument, so that the instrument\ntruly reflects the original agreement of the parties. Cherokee Water, 741 S.W.2d at 379.\nThus, a party seeking reformation of a contract based on mutual mistake must prove: (1)\nan original agreement and (2) a mutual mistake, occurring after the original agreement, in\nreducing the original agreement to writing. See id. The mistake in reducing the original\n\n        10\n            Interestingly, in his trial testimony, Comiskey acknowledged that through the cross-\ncollateralization clause in the deed of trust, Gomberg’s other debts were secured by the Burkhart property.\n                                                    13\n\fagreement to writing must be by both parties.

Based on this evidence, appellants suggest that Comiskey and 1st\nChoice both understood that this was the agreement. However, under the circumstances\nof this case, these alleged statements by Sellers do not establish that an agreement was\nreached between Comiskey and 1st Choice prior to the reduction of the agreement into\nwriting. Comiskey testified that he arrived at 1st Choice on the day the agreement was\nsigned expecting to receive a new and separate note of his own, replacing the one\nGomberg already had with 1st Choice.             He was then given the Extension and\nModification to sign, which had already been drafted before Comiskey and Gomberg\narrived at 1st Choice. Comiskey testified that Sellers told him that the Extension and\nModification was the only document he needed to review, and in his excluded testimony,\nComiskey would have stated that Sellers told him what “the deal” was between the\nparties.   Sellers denied making these representations to Comiskey.        However, even\nassuming, as we must, that Sellers made those representations, they were representations\n\n\n                                            14\n\fabout a document that already had been drafted but not yet signed; the statements did not\nconstitute contract negotiations or a meeting of the minds.11 Therefore, they are no\nevidence of mutual mistake. See Cherokee Water, 741 S.W.2d at 379 (explaining that\nmutual mistake concerns an actual agreement reached prior to the drafting of the written\ninstrument).12\n\n        Furthermore, the circumstances in this case are substantially similar to those the\nTexas Supreme Court addressed in Estes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1724585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1724585/estes-v-republic-national-bank-of-dallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In that case, the court held\nthat in the absence of a showing of “fraud or imposition,” mutual mistake cannot occur\nwhere one party did not even read the agreement before signing. Id. at 276. In other\nwords, the court reasoned that when one party does not read the contract, there cannot be\na mutual mistake in drafting the agreement absent fraud or duress. See id. Appellants do\nnot allege any form of duress or imposition.\n\n        The fraud exception referenced by the Estes court is often called “unilateral\nmistake.” See, e.g., Orix Capital Mkts., LLC v.

This is also no\nevidence that an agreement was reached prior to the drafting and signing of the Extension and\nModification.\n                                                        15\n\fpreservation of this issue in the trial court.

Estoppel\n\n       Also in their first issue, appellants assert that the trial court erred in refusing to\nsubmit their promissory estoppel, equitable estoppel, and quasi-estoppel counterclaims\nand defenses to the jury. Specifically, appellants contend they presented a fact question\nregarding whether FH Partners was precluded, under these doctrines, from enforcing the\ncross-collateralization clause in the Burkhart deed of trust. We will address each of these\ndoctrines separately because their respective elements differ significantly.\n\n                                 A. Promissory Estoppel\n\n       Promissory estoppel is an equitable doctrine that ordinarily is used defensively to\nprevent “a party from insisting upon [its] strict legal rights when it would be unjust to\nallow [it] to enforce them.” Wheeler v.

See Collins, 341 S.W.3d at\n573–74.\n\n       A party to an arm’s length transaction must exercise reasonable diligence in\nprotecting his own interests, and a failure to do so is not excused by mere confidence in\nthe honesty and integrity of the other party.

Had he then\nread the deed of trust before signing the Extension and Modification, he would have seen\nthe cross-collateralization clause.16 Comiskey complained at trial that 1st Choice did not\nprovide him with copies of the deed of trust or the note; however, it is also clear from the\nevidence that (1) Comiskey was under no duress to sign the Extension and Modification\nwithout having read the deed of trust; (2) Comiskey did not refuse to sign without first\nseeing the deed of trust; (3) Comiskey also failed to obtain a copy of the document from\nGomberg, the other signatory; and (4) the deed of trust was filed in the public property\nrecords and thus available to Comiskey to view on his own.17\n\n        In summary, Comiskey was a relatively sophisticated person who by his own\nadmission signed on to an existing loan without fully reading the Extension and\nModification he was signing or even seeing the underlying and still largely controlling\nloan documents.

They further state that\nhaving made representations about “the transaction and his debt,” 1st Choice and FH\nPartners had a duty to “tell him the full story and disclose the dragnet clause.” As for\nreliance, appellants again appear to rely on the inference that because Comiskey paid on\nthe Burkhart note, he must have done so in reliance on the representations by 1st Choice\nand FH Partners.\n\n       Appellants arguments, however, principally ignore the requirement that the party\nurging application of the equitable estoppel doctrine have been without the means of\nobtaining knowledge of the true facts. See Johnson & Higgins, 962 S.W.2d at 515–16.\nAlthough Comiskey testified that neither Gomberg nor 1st Choice provided him with a\n\n                                             19\n\fcopy of the deed of trust where the cross-collateralization clause could be found, he\nacknowledged that he did not insist on seeing a copy before signing the Extension and\nModification, and the record also reflects that the deed of trust was on file in the public\nproperty records prior to the Extension and Modification being signed.                        Appellants\nsuggest that Sellers kept appellant from obtaining knowledge of the “true facts” by\nsuggesting Comiskey did not need to review any other documents. Although this alleged\nstatement may have discouraged Comiskey from viewing the deed of trust before signing,\nit did not prevent him from doing so.18 Because Comiskey clearly had the means of\nknowledge regarding the existence of the cross-collateralization clause, the trial court did\nnot err in directing a verdict against appellants’ equitable estoppel claim.

Furthermore, as FH Partners points out, Comiskey entered the bank with Gomberg\nto sign onto one of Gomberg’s loans.

We find that a fact issue existed\nregarding waiver, and thus, the trial court erred in directing a verdict against this claim.\n\n        As evidence of waiver, appellants point to (1) Comiskey’s proffered testimony that\nSellers told him both “before and after” they signed the Extension and Modification that\nfull payment of the Burkhart note would result in full release of the Burkhart lien; (2)\nSellers’s allegedly discouraging Comiskey from viewing the Burkhart note and deed of\ntrust by telling him that the Extension and Modification contained all of the key terms;\n(3) the issuance of partial releases by 1st Choice and FH Partners; (4) the pay-off\nstatement from 1st Choice which included the phrase “please furnish release of lien”; (5)\nalleged conversations involving Jeff Coupe, as representative of FH Partners, with\nComiskey and a representative of AllegianceBank, Dan Tralmer, who was attempting to\nset up a refinancing or buyout of the Burkhart note; and (6) 1st Choice and FH Partner’s\nfailure to inform Comiskey either that he would have to pay off Gomberg’s other debts in\norder to get clear title to the Burkhart property or exactly what other debts Gomberg had.\nWe will begin by addressing the evidence which will not support waiver; we will then\nexamine the evidence that created a fact issue on waiver.\n\n\n        21\n          Appellants explain in their briefing that their waiver claim was a defense to the declaratory\njudgment action and also supported their affirmative claims for unjust enrichment and breach of contract.\n\n                                                   23\n\f                                    A. Not Evidence of Waiver\n\n        Statements made and conduct occurring before signing the agreement could not\nconstitute waiver of terms in the agreement. See, e.g., Tri-Steel Structures, Inc. v. Baptist\nFound. of Tex., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1380234\"><a href=\"/opinion/1380234/tri-steel-structures-v-baptist-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 451 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2005, pet. denied).\nLikewise, statements made contemporaneously with signing the agreement, and which\npurported to simply explain “the deal” that was being signed, would not constitute an\nexpress renunciation of a right contained in the document.                     Thus, Sellers’s alleged\nstatements at the time of signing the Extension and Modification, and his allegedly\ndiscouraging Comiskey from viewing the other loan documents, amount to no evidence\nof waiver.\n\n        Additionally, that 1st Choice and FH Partners had a practice of issuing partial\nreleases when parcels of the Burkhart property were sold, taken in isolation, was no\nevidence of waiver. The deed of trust itself provided for the granting of partial releases\n“without affecting the lien hereof against the remainder.”                   Furthermore, the partial\nreleases did no more than facilitate sale of the parcels in order to pay down the debt22;\nthus, by themselves, the partial releases neither demonstrated a clear intent to waive the\ncross-collateralization clause nor were inconsistent with assertion of the clause when\nComiskey attempted to pay the balance due on the Burkhart note and keep the final lot\nfor himself.\n\n        Lastly, appellants do not explain on what basis they claim 1st Choice or FH\nPartners had a duty to inform Comiskey regarding the nature of Gomberg’s other debts.\nSee generally Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i) (requiring briefs to contain argument for the\ncontentions raised); Brown v.

More than a Scintilla\n\n        In the offer of proof responsive to the court’s exclusion of portions of Comiskey’s\ntestimony, appellants’ counsel represented that Comiskey would have testified that at\nsome point after the agreement was signed, Sellers told him full payment of the Burkhart\nnote would result in full release of the Burkhart lien.               Additionally, as mentioned,\nevidence was admitted regarding conversations between Coupe and Comiskey, and\nCoupe and Dan Tralmer, regarding a refinancing or buyout of the Burkhart note. These\nalleged statements and conversations, when taken together in light of the pay-off\nstatement and the assertion that neither 1st Choice nor FH Partners ever mentioned the\ncross-collateralization clause to Comiskey or Tralmer as a roadblock to full release of the\nlien, presented a fact question on the waiver claim.24 Of particular note, the pay-off\nstatement in question included the phrase “please furnish release of lien.”                      Sellers\nacknowledged that inclusion of such language on a pay-off statement typically indicated\nthat a bank was expecting to release a lien once the specified amount was paid. This\nlanguage, taken together with the alleged statements, conversations, and silence regarding\nthe clause itself, presents at least some evidence of an intention to yield a known right.\n        23\n           FH Partners suggests that informing Comiskey about Gomberg’s debt would have run contrary\nto certain banking laws, citing Tex. Fin. Code § 59.006. We need take no position on whether this is\ncorrect under the circumstances of this case.\n        24\n           Again, taken in isolation, the conversations between Coupe and Comiskey and Coupe and\nTralmer are were not enough to raise a fact issue; it is only when considered together that the evidence\ncreates a fact issue on waiver. Specifically concerning these conversations, the record shows that Coupe\nspoke to Comiskey about Comiskey’s plans to sell off several lots, pay off the note, and then build a\nhouse on the final Burkhart lot. However, at no point in the testimony are any specific promises or\nwaivers by Coupe mentioned. Coupe himself testified that he talked with Comiskey to try to figure out\nwhy Comiskey was involved with the loan because “[i]t just didn’t seem to make much sense.” Coupe\nsaid that he did not realize Comiskey expected a release if the note was fully paid. Similarly, the\ntestimony regarding Coupe’s discussions with Tralmer reveals, at most, negotiations regarding a possible\nrefinancing or buyout of the Burkhart note, but the conversations never resulted in any such buyout, much\nless any express renunciation of the cross-collateralization clause.\n\n\n                                                   25\n\fSee Aguiar, 167 S.W.3d at 451. It also is some evidence of conduct inconsistent with an\nintent to rely upon the right of cross-collateralization. See Jernigan, 111 S.W.3d at 156.\n\n        We sustain appellants’ first issue to the extent appellants contend the trial court\nerred in directing a verdict against their waiver claims.25 However, we overrule the first\nissue to the extent appellants allege the trial court erred by directing a verdict against\ntheir mutual mistake or estoppel contentions.\n\n                                             VIII. Fraud\n\n        In their third issue, appellants contend there was evidence to support submission to\nthe jury of their fraud, fraudulent concealment, and fraudulent inducement counterclaims\nagainst FH Partners. Under these counterclaims, appellants sought actual and exemplary\ndamages against FH Partners.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n2004, pet. denied) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 531 (1977)).\n\n        As evidence of fraud, Comiskey cites (1) Coupe’s email stating the Burkhart note\nbalance, (2) the partial release issued by FH Partners for the sale of a portion of the\nBurkhart property, and (3) FH Partners’ failure to disclose Gomberg’s other debts and the\nfact they were tied to release of the lien on the Burkhart property.                     According to\nComiskey’s version, FH Partners led him along, taking his payments on the Burkhart\nnote, and then refused to accept final payment and release the lien.\n\n        In their briefing, appellants state that Coupe told Comiskey in an email that “the\nBurkhart note could be paid off for $87,174.53.” The email in question, however, only\nresponded to an email request from Comiskey for a balance amount on the Burkhart note;\nnothing was said by either party to the emails about a payoff of the note.26 The record\nfurther reflects that the correspondence concerned an alleged discrepancy in the balance,\napparently owing to the fact that Comiskey had given a check to Gomberg to take to the\nbank to pay on the note and some of the funds got misapplied. Corrections were made.\nThe email contained no representation that if the amount was paid, a release of lien would\nissue; it merely provided the information Comiskey requested: the balance on the\nBurkhart note.\n\n        As for the partial release issued by FH Partners for one of the lots sold from the\nBurkhart property, there is no evidence that the statements therein are untrue. Standing\nalone, this document makes no material misrepresentations which could be a basis for a\nfinding of fraud. It merely provided a partial release of lien, which was authorized under\nthe deed of trust and was a prerequisite for sale of the lot. Appellants suggest, though,\n\n        26\n           In an email dated June 6, 2008, Comiskey asked Coupe “What is the outstanding balance on\nthis note per your records?” Coupe responded the same day with an email stating a principal balance,\naccrued interest, and total for the note. Coupe further said that he needed to confirm the accuracy of the\nfigures because the “asset” had just been uploaded on the system. On June 13, after sale of one of the\nBurkhart lots, Comiskey again emailed Coupe: “Have you had a chance to review the balance on this\nyet? It was my belief we had a difference.” Coupe responded three days later, providing an attachment\nshowing payment and balance history for the note. He further stated “I am showing a current balance of\n$87,174.53.”\n                                                   27\n\fthat it “could [have] further[ed] Comiskey’s preexisting belief that payment of the last\nsum remaining on the note would discharge the lien.” However, assuming this allegation\ncould be a basis for a fraud claim, appellants cite no evidence that FH Partners was aware\nthat Comiskey had such a preexisting belief; appellants further cite no evidence that FH\nPartners intended for Comiskey to rely on the partial release in continuing to pay on the\ndebt.\n\n        Lastly, appellants complain that FH Partners never disclosed that Gomberg’s other\nloans were secured by the Burkhart property. But, as discussed above, appellants offer\nno basis for imposing a duty on FH Partners to supply that information. See generally\nTex. R. App. P. 38.1(i); Brown, 302 S.W.3d at 14. Because the evidence cited by\nappellants does not raise a material issue of fact supporting their fraud counterclaim, we\noverrule their third issue.\n\n                                 IX. Fair Market Value\n\n        In issue five, appellants contend that the trial court erred in entering a directed\nverdict against their breach of contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment counterclaims\nbecause there was evidence that FH Partners wrongfully refused to credit appellants with\nthe fair market value of the Drury property. Gomberg owned the Drury property and\ndefaulted on a balance of over $1.4 million owed to FH Partners for purchase of the\nproperty. FH Partners thereafter foreclosed on the Drury property and then credited the\n$850,000 sales price it paid for the property at foreclosure against the debts owed by\nGomberg and secured by the cross-collateralization clause in the Burkhart deed of trust.\nAppellants contend, however, that there was evidence that the fair market value of the\nDrury property was closer to $1.5 million, which sum should have been credited against\nGomberg’s debts. According to appellants, if the fair market value had been credited\nagainst Gomberg’s debts, there would have been no need to foreclose on the Burkhart\nproperty because there would not have been an outstanding balance on the Drury loan.\n\n        In support of their contention, appellants cite sections 51.003, 51.004, and 51.005\nof the Texas Property Code. Tex. Prop. Code §§ 51.003–.005. These sections permit a\n\n                                            28\n\fperson obligated for indebtedness, and against whom a post-foreclosure deficiency is\nsought, to offset the fair market value of the property foreclosed upon against the amount\nowed if the fair market value is greater than the actual foreclosure proceeds.                  Id.\nAppellants acknowledge, however, that they were not makers or guarantors of the note on\nthe Drury property and FH Partners did not seek to recover a foreclosure deficiency\nagainst them; thus, they cannot make a claim directly under those code sections.27 Other\nthan suggesting that this court apply the “spirit” of the Property Code to the facts of this\ncase, appellants do not cite any authority or make any particular argument suggesting\nthese code provisions can be used in this manner. We decline to apply the provisions\nbeyond the boundaries set by the legislature.
