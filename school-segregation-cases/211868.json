Section\n\n12131 (“Title II”) and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 701, et seq. This case\n\ninvolves an issue of first impression in our circuit: whether Title II of the ADA encompasses\n\nemployment discrimination. We answer the question in the affirmative and, accordingly, we\n\nreverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment and remand this case for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Bledsoe was employed as a Resource Technician for the District from January 1988\n\nuntil his termination in October of 1992. In his employment, Bledsoe had to spend a large\n\nportion of his time walking, surveying, and performing manual labor in the fields. While\n\nperforming his duties, on February 26, 1990, Bledsoe sustained an injury to his knee for\n\nwhich he made a claim for workers’ compensation benefits. Based on the advice of his\n\ndoctors that he should refrain from excessive walking and walking on uneven terrain,\n\nBledsoe requested some form of accommodation from his supervisor. In response, the\n\nDistrict offered Bledsoe the position of Resource Conservationist, but he rejected the offer.\n\nIn October 1992, the District terminated Bledsoe.\n\n                                             2\n\f       Subsequent to his termination, Bledsoe settled his workers’ compensation case with\n\nPalm Beach County.1 The joint settlement agreement entered into by the parties contained\n\nthe following partial release provision:\n\n              As further consideration for the aforementioned payment, the\n       Employee/Claimant agrees and does hereby release, discharge, and surrender\n       any and all claims, whether or not asserted, against the Employer/Carrier or\n       Servicing Agent, or any of its officers, agents, servants, employees, directors,\n       successors, assigns, and any other person or entity so connected to the\n       Employer/Carrier or Servicing Agent, of any nature whatsoever, excepting\n       only (1) future medical pursuant to other provisions of this agreement, or (2)\n       penalties, interest or attorneys’ fees which might be due because of failure to\n       pay order approving this Joint Petition within 30 days.\n\nR1-34-Exh. A.\n\n       Bledsoe filed suit on June 24, 1994, against the District and Palm Beach County\n\nalleging that both of those entities were his “employer” within the meaning of Title I of the\n\nADA and the Rehabilitation Act and had violated his rights protected by those acts.\n\nSpecifically, Bledsoe alleged that he had a disability within the meaning of the law, that the\n\ndefendants had failed to accommodate his disability, and that the defendants discharged him\n\nas a result of his disability. Palm Beach County filed a motion to dismiss arguing that it was\n\nnot Bledsoe’s “employer” for purposes of the claims and that it had been released from the\n\nclaims by virtue of Bledsoe’s partial release of his workers’ compensation benefits. After\n\n\n       1\n          At all relevant times, the District was Bledsoe’s employer; however, because the\nDistrict had no more than five employees at a time, it participated in Palm Beach County’s\ninsurance plans, including its workers’ compensation plan. For a fee, the County adjusted\nworkers’ compensation claims made against the District. Therefore, Palm Beach County was\nthe District’s workers’ compensation carrier and the party with whom Bledsoe settled his\nworkers’ compensation claim.\n\n                                              3\n\fconsideration, the district court determined that Palm Beach County was not Bledsoe’s\n\nemployer and, therefore, summary judgment should be entered for it on all claims. Bledsoe\n\nhas not appealed the district court’s disposition that the County was not his employer.\n\n       The litigation continued against the District. Because the District alone did not have\n\nthe requisite number of employees to effect coverage under Title I of the ADA,2 Bledsoe\n\nsought leave to amend the complaint to bring his claim under Title II, and the district court\n\ngranted leave. The District filed a motion for summary judgment arguing first that Title II\n\nof the ADA does not apply to discrimination in employment and, second, that the partial\n\nrelease in Bledsoe’s joint settlement agreement with the County released his claims against\n\nthe District. Bledsoe opposed the motion. The district court entered summary judgment for\n\nthe District on both Bledsoe’s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims. Bledsoe then perfected\n\nthis appeal.\n\n\n\n                                    II. DISCUSSION\n\n       Bledsoe raises two issues for our review: (1) whether the district court properly\n\nconcluded that the workers’ compensation release bars Bledsoe’s federal claims of\n\nemployment discrimination; and (2) whether the district court properly determined that Title\n\nII of the ADA does not apply to discrimination in employment. We review the district\n\n\n\n       2\n          The term “employer” in Title I is defined as “a person engaged in an industry\naffecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or\nmore calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year. . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 12111(5).\n\n                                             4\n\fcourt’s order granting summary judgment de novo. Parks v. City of Warner Robins, Ga., 43\n\nF.3d 609, 612 (11th Cir. 1995). After conducting our review, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt improperly found that the workers’ compensation release barred Bledsoe’s federal\n\nclaims of employment discrimination and that Title II does not encompass employment\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n       A. Workers’ Compensation Release\n\n       In its determination that the workers’ compensation release barred Bledsoe’s ADA\n\nand Rehabilitation Act claims, the district court relied on F.M. v. Palm Beach County, 912\n\nF.Supp. 514 (S.D. Fla. 1995), aff’d F.M. v. County Comm’rs, 84 F.3d 438 (11th Cir.\n\n1996)(Table). On appeal, Bledsoe contends that the district court erred in relying on F.M.\n\nv. Palm Beach County. He argues that the issue should have been analyzed under this\n\ncircuit’s decision in Puentes v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 86 F.3d 196 (11th Cir. 1996).\n\nBledsoe is correct.\n\n       The Supreme Court has stated that an employee can waive his “cause of action under\n\nTitle VII as part of a voluntary settlement agreement” if “the employee’s consent to the\n\nsettlement was voluntary and knowing.” Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 52,\n\nn.15 (1974). The same principles should be equally applicable to waiver of rights under Title\n\nII of the ADA. See Rivera-Flores v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Caribbean, 112 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.\n\n1997). The waiver of such remedial rights, however, “must be closely scrutinized,” and a\n\ncourt must look to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the release is\n\nknowing and voluntary. Puentes v. United Parcel Service, 86 F.3d at 198.\n\n                                             5\n\f       In Puentes, the plaintiffs, at the time of their terminations, were offered substantial\n\nseverance packages and the ability to resign “for personal reasons” on the condition that they\n\nexecute unambiguous release agreements waiving all employment discrimination claims\n\narising out of their terminations. Both plaintiffs executed the agreements, but later filed suit\n\nagainst UPS alleging racial and national origin discrimination. UPS moved for summary\n\njudgment, which the district court granted. On appeal, this court reversed, concluding that\n\na jury should decide whether the releases were knowingly and voluntarily executed.\n\n       The Puentes court explained that the following factors bear on whether a release is\n\nknowing and voluntary:\n\n       the plaintiff’s education and business experience; the amount of time the\n       plaintiff considered the agreement before signing it; the clarity of the\n       agreement; the plaintiff’s opportunity to consult with an attorney; the\n       employer’s encouragement or discouragement of consultation with an\n       attorney; and the consideration given in exchange for the waiver when\n       compared with the benefits to which the employee was already entitled.\n\n86 F.3d at 198 (quoting Beadle v. City of Tampa, 42 F.3d 633, 635 (11th Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n515 U.S. 1152 (1995)). When reviewing these factors in Puentes, the court determined that\n\nthe plaintiffs did not have sufficient time to consider their release agreements and neither\n\nplaintiff had consulted with an attorney. The court also noted that neither plaintiff had any\n\nrole in deciding the terms of the agreement; the plaintiffs were simply handed printed forms.\n\n86 F.3d at 199. These factors raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiffs\n\nvoluntarily and knowingly executed the release agreements. Accordingly, the issue could\n\nnot be resolved by summary judgment.\n\n\n                                               6\n\f         The factors set forth in Puentes should have been considered by the district court in\n\nthis case. The district court should not have summarily adopted a decision from another case,\n\neven though it dealt with the exact same release form. Each factor should be independently\n\nanalyzed. In applying the Puentes factors, we conclude that a jury question exists about\n\nwhether Bledsoe voluntarily and knowingly released ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.\n\nThe language of the release indicates that Bledsoe was only settling his claim for wage loss\n\nbenefits under the workers’ compensation law. There is nothing in the release that suggests\n\nor mentions a waiver of federal discrimination claims. Additionally, there was no evidence\n\nin the record of any consideration given to Bledsoe in exchange for his allegedly waiving his\n\nrights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Moreover, Bledsoe and his counsel\n\nprovided affidavits to the district court stating that the only matters released were benefits\n\nfor wage loss available under the workers’ compensation law, thus creating an issue of fact\n\nas to what was released. The district court erred in granting summary judgment on this\n\nclaim.\n\n         B. Title II of the ADA\n\n         The district court held that Title II of the ADA does not encompass employment\n\ndiscrimination. Bledsoe3 urges this court to reverse and join several other courts which have\n\n\n\n\n         3\n        Joining Bledsoe’s position are the United States Department of Justice, the National\nEmployment Lawyers Association, and the American Civil Liberties Union, which all filed\namicus briefs with the court.\n\n                                               7\n\fheld that Title II does encompass employment discrimination.4 Our circuit has not squarely\n\naddressed the issue, but two of our recent decisions have assumed or implied that Title II\n\ncreates a cause of action for employment discrimination. See Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta,\n\nGa., 112 F.3d 1522, 1528-29 (11th Cir. 1997); McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d\n\n1068, 1073 (11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S.Ct. 1819 (1997). Our review of the statutory\n\nlanguage of Title II, the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ”) regulations, our circuit’s reference\n\nto the issue, and other courts’ resolution of the issue, persuade us that Title II of the ADA\n\ndoes encompass public employment discrimination.\n\n       1. The statutory language\n\n       The ADA was implemented “to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate\n\nfor the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n12101(b)(1). In passing the ADA, Congress recognized that “society has tended to isolate\n\nand segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of\n\n\n\n       4\n          See e.g., Doe v. University of Maryland Medical Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1264-65\n  th\n(4 Cir. 1995); Dominguez v. City of Council Bluffs, Iowa, 974 F.Supp. 732, 736-37 (S.D.\nIowa 1997); Hernandez v. City of Hartford, 959 F.Supp. 125, 133 (D.Conn. 1997); Davoll\nv. Webb, 943 F.Supp. 1289, 1297 (D.Colo. 1996); Wagner v. Texas A & M Univ., 939\nF.Supp. 1297, 1309 (S.D.Tex. 1996); Graboski v. Guiliani, 937 F.Supp. 258, 267-69\n(S.D.N.Y. 1996); Silk v. City of Chicago, No. 95C0143, 312074, ( N.D.Ill., June 7, 1996);\nLundstedt v. City of Miami, 5 A.D. Cases 568 (S.D.Fla. Oct. 11, 1995); Bruton v.\nSoutheastern Pa. Transp. Authority, Civ.A.No. 94-CV-3111, (E.D.Pa. Aug. 19, 1994); Ethrie\nv. State of Alabama, 847 F.Supp. 9905-06 (M.D.Ala. 1993); Eisfelder v. Michigan Dept. of\nNatural Resources, 847 F.Supp. 78, 83 (W.D.Mich. 1993); Finley v. Giacobbe, 827 F.Supp.\n215, 219-20 (S.D.N.Y. 1993); Petersen v. University of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 818 F.Supp.\n1276, 1278 (W.D.Wis. 1993); Bell v. Retirement Bd. of Firemen’s Annuity & Benefit Fund,\n( N.D.Ill., Oct. 6, 1993).up\n\n                                              8\n\fdiscrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive\n\nsocial problem.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2). Congress further recognized that disabled\n\nindividuals face extraordinary barriers and discrimination by outright intentional segregation\n\nand often have “no legal recourse to redress such discrimination.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(4)\n\nand (5).   Moreover, in enacting the ADA, Congress hoped to increase employment\n\nopportunities for disabled people through prevention of employment discrimination. 42\n\nU.S.C. § 12101(a)(3), (8), and (9).\n\n       The provision of Title II allegedly violated by the District in this action provides:\n\n               Subject to the provisions of this [title], no qualified individual with a\n       disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in\n       or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public\n       entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. “Public entity” is defined to include “(A) any State or local government;\n\n[and] (B) any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State\n\nor States or local government; . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A) & (B).\n\n       The statutory language used by Congress in the creation of Title II is brief. Extensive\n\nlegislative commentary regarding the applicability of Title II to employment discrimination,\n\nhowever, is so pervasive as to belie any contention that Title II does not apply to employment\n\nactions. The Report of the United States House of Representatives Judiciary Committee\n\nstated, “[i]n the area of employment, title II incorporates the duty set forth in the regulations\n\nfor Sections 501, 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to provide a ‘reasonable\n\naccommodation’ that does not constitute an ‘undue hardship.’” See H.R.Rep. No. 101-\n\n\n                                               9\n\f485(III), at 50 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 473. In explaining the forms of\n\ndiscrimination prohibited by Title II, the Report noted that:\n\n       The Committee intends, however, that the forms of discrimination prohibited\n       by section 202 [codified as 42 U.S.C. § 12132] be identical to those set out in\n       the applicable provisions of titles I and III of this legislation . . . . In addition,\n       activities which do not fit into the employment or public accommodations\n       context are governed by the analogous section 504 regulations.\n\nH.R.Rep.No. 101- 485 (II), at 84 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 367. The\n\nReport further notes: “The purpose of title II is to continue to break down barriers to the\n\nintegrated participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of community life. The\n\nCommittee intends that title II work in the same manner as Section 504.” 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\nat 472-73.\n\n       It is significant that Congress intended Title II to work in the same manner as Section\n\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act, because Section 504 was so focused on employment\n\ndiscrimination that Congress enacted subsequent legislation to clarify that Section 504\n\napplied to other forms of discrimination in addition to employment discrimination. The first\n\nSupreme Court case to consider Section 504, Consolidated Rail v. Darrone, 465 U.S. 624\n\n(1984), was an employment discrimination case. The Court stated:\n\n       Among [the] purposes [of the Rehabilitation Act] as originally stated, were to\n       ‘promote and expand employment opportunities in the public and private\n       sectors for handicapped individuals and to place such individuals in\n       employment.’ 29 U.S.C. § 701(8). . . .¶ Section 504 neither refers explicitly\n       to § 604 nor contains analogous limiting language; rather, that section\n       prohibits discrimination against the handicapped under ‘any program or\n       activity receiving Federal financial assistance.’ And it is unquestionable that\n       the section was intended to reach employment discrimination.\n\n\n                                                10\n\fId. at 626-632 (emphasis in original).\n\n       Part of the language of Title II prohibits public entities from excluding disabled\n\nindividuals from “services, programs, or activities” or denying them the benefits of those\n\nservices, programs, or activities. The district court in this case focused on the meaning of\n\nthe words “services, programs, or activities.” Bledsoe v. Palm Beach Soil and Water\n\nConservation Dist., 942 F.Supp. 1439, 1443 (S.D.Fla. 1996). The district court found that\n\nthese words, “understood as a whole, focus [] on a public [] entity’s outputs rather than its\n\nimputs [sic].” Id. The court characterized public employment as “an imput [sic]” that\n\nenables a public entity “to produce desired outputs, such as parks and schools.” Id. at 1444.\n\nThe court’s analysis ignored the prohibition in the final clause of the section, which protects\n\nqualified individuals with a disability from being “subjected to discrimination by any such\n\nentity,” and is not tied directly to the “services, programs, or activities” of the public entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. As the Second Circuit found in Innovative Health Systems, Inc. v. City\n\nof White Plains, 117 F.3d 37, 44-45 (2d Cir. 1997), “the language of Title II’s anti-\n\ndiscrimination provision does not limit the ADA’s coverage to conduct that occurs in the\n\n‘programs, services, or activities’ of [a public entity]. Rather, it is a catch-all phrase that\n\nprohibits all discrimination by a public entity, regardless of the context, . . . .” Accordingly,\n\nemployment coverage is clear from the language and structure of Title II.\n\n       2. DOJ regulations\n\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\f       The DOJ regulations also support the position that Title II encompasses public\n\nemployment discrimination.5\n\n       Congress specifically provided in the ADA statute that the DOJ should write\n\nregulations implementing Title II’s prohibition against discrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 12134.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee Report provided:\n\n              Unlike the other titles in this Act, title II does not list all of the forms\n       of discrimination that the title is intended to prohibit. Thus, the purpose of this\n       section is to direct the Attorney General to issue regulations setting forth the\n       forms of discrimination prohibited.\n\nH.R.Rep. 101-485(III), at 52 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 475.\n\n       In promulgating regulations pertinent to Title II, the Attorney General created a\n\nspecific subpart in the Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”) addressing employment\n\ndiscrimination by public entities. These regulations state:\n\n              (a) No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of\n       disability, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any service,\n       program, or activity conducted by a public entity.\n\n               (b)(1) For purposes of this part, the requirements of title I of the Act .\n       . . apply to employment in any service, program, or activity conducted by a\n\n\n       5\n         The district court noted its familiarity with the principle that “considerable weight\nshould be accorded to an executive department’s construction of a statutory scheme it is\nentrusted to administer.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984). However, the district court found that the plain language of the\nADA, when read as a whole, does not support a cause of action for employment\ndiscrimination under Title II, and, therefore, Chevron deference was not applicable in this\ncase. “[T]he Court does not believe that the conflicting legislative history sufficiently\nobfuscates the statute to create a vacuum of meaning for the Justice Department to fill.”\nBledsoe, 942 F.Supp. at 1449. The court concluded that when the language of the statute is\nplain, administrative interpretation of the statute is not entitled to deference. Id.\n\n                                               12\n\f       public entity if that public entity is also subject to the jurisdiction of title I [i.e.\n       employs fifteen or more employees].\n\n              (b)(2) For the purposes of this part, the requirements of section 504 of\n       the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as established by the regulations of the\n       Department of Justice in 28 CFR part 41, as those requirements pertain to\n       employment, apply to employment in any service, program, or activity\n       conducted by a public entity if that public entity is not also subject to the\n       jurisdiction of title I.\n\n28 C.F.R. § 35.140.\n\n       There has been no modification to the regulations promulgated by the Attorney\n\nGeneral. Rather, in 1997, the United States Senate unanimously gave its consent to the\n\nprinting in the Congressional Record of the Board of Directors, Office of Compliance\n\nregulation adopting the Attorney General’s interpretation of Title II. See 143 Cong. Rec.\n\nS30-31 (January 7, 1997).6 Also, as this court has stated, “[C]ongress is deemed to know the\n\nexecutive and judicial gloss given to certain language and thus adopts the existing\n\ninterpretation unless it affirmatively acts to change the meaning.” Florida National Guard\n\nv. Federal Labor Relations Authority, 699 F.2d 1082, 1087 (11th Cir. 1983).\n\n       Under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n\n837, 844 (1984), “considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department’s\n\nconstruction of a statutory scheme,” unless the regulations are “arbitrary, capricious, or\n\nmanifestly contrary to the statute.” The DOJ regulations provide clearly that Title II\n\n\n\n       6\n             We note, however, that these regulations do not become effective until they\nare approved by Congress and published in the Congressional Record. See 2 U.S.C.A. §\n1384(d)(3).\n\n                                                 13\n\fencompasses employment actions against public entities. The regulations are neither\n\n“arbitrary, capricious, [n]or manifestly contrary to the statute.” Id. at 844. Thus, we cannot\n\nignore the DOJ’s reasonable construction of statutory language.\n\n       3. Our court’s reference to the issue\n\n       In McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068 (11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied,\n\n117 S.Ct. 1819 (1997), our court addressed the question whether a plaintiff suing under the\n\nADA can recover for discrimination without showing that his disability was the sole cause\n\nfor the adverse employment action taken against him. We answered the question in the\n\naffirmative. In discussing the issue, we noted that “[t]he stated purpose of the ADA is ‘to\n\nprovide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination\n\nagainst individuals with disabilities.’ ” 99 F.3d at 1073, quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1).\n\nWe acknowledged that Title I of the ADA applies to the private sector and provides for the\n\nelimination of disability-based discrimination. We then stated that “Title II of the ADA,\n\nwhich applies to public sector employment, contains a parallel provision.” Id. (emphasis\n\nadded). Later, we again assumed that Title II covered employment: “Title II (the public\n\nsector title).” Id. at 1074. Thus, without directly discussing the issue with which this court\n\nis presently faced, our court has assumed that Title II covers public employment\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n       Additionally, in Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., 112 F.3d 1522 (11th Cir. 1997),\n\nwe addressed the question whether claims brought pursuant to Title II of the ADA involving\n\nevents that occurred prior to the effective date of Title I are actionable under the ADA or the\n\n                                               14\n\fRehabilitation Act of 1973. In discussing this issue, we noted the language of Title II, the\n\nfederal regulations promulgated pursuant to the ADA, and the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”) guide. 112 F.3d at 1528-29. The court then determined\n\nthat “Title II thus incorporates by reference the substantive, detailed regulations prohibiting\n\ndiscrimination against disabled individuals contained in Title I.” Id. at 1529. We further\n\nnoted:\n\n         The above regulations suggest that the provisions of Title II extending the\n         protections afforded to employees in the private sector under Title I to state\n         and local government workers became effective only when Title I went into\n         effect. As explicitly described in the EEOC manual, the Rehabilitation Act\n         provided a remedy for discrimination in public employment prior to the\n         effective date of Title I. We conclude that Title II of the ADA did not become\n         effective until the date on which Title I became effective, July 26, 1992, and,\n         prior to that date, a plaintiff’s remedy for discrimination under Title II of the\n         ADA was the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\nId. Thus, the court implicitly determined that Title II was the “new replacement” for the\n\nRehabilitation Act, which is what the legislative history indicates.\n\n         Although not decisions of our court, Lundstedt v. City of Miami, 5 A.D. Cases 568\n\n(S.D.Fla. Oct. 11, 1995), and Ethridge v. State of Alabama, 847 F.Supp. 903 (M.D.Ala.\n\n1993), two district court decisions from within our circuit, held that Title II clearly\n\nencompasses employment discrimination by public entities. 5 A.D. Cases at 572-74; 847\n\nF.Supp. at 906. The district court in Ethridge found that although a plain reading of Title II\n\ndoes not reveal whether it covers employment discrimination, the legislative history of and\n\nregulations promulgated under Title II make clear that the section prohibits employment\n\ndiscrimination by public entities on the basis of disability. The court noted that the primary\n\n                                                15\n\fpurpose of Title II was to extend the reach of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and that\n\nSection 504 “clearly applies to employment discrimination.” 847 F.Supp. at 906, citing\n\nConsolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, 465 U.S. 624 (1984). The Ethridge court also discussed\n\nthe House Report addressing Title II and the regulations implementing Title II to find that\n\nTitle II covers employment discrimination.\n\n       Additionally, the Ethridge court noted the difference in the application of the\n\nexhaustion requirement which is mandatory in Title I but not in Title II of the ADA.7\n\nThe court found that although Title I requires exhaustion, Title II does not because it\n\n“incorporates the enforcement procedures of the Rehabilitation Act, . . . which do not require\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies for non-federal employees.” 847 F.Supp. at 907. “An\n\n\n\n       7\n         The district court in this case expressed great concern in the inconsistency in the\nexhaustion requirement if the court found that Title II covered employment discrimination.\n“Acceptance of the ‘no exhaustion rule,’ when coupled with the slighting of Title II’s plain\nmeaning and the redundancy of Titles I and II, renders the entire statutory framework a\nmonstrous distortion.” 942 F.Supp. at 1445. The court further stated that:\n\n       The statute the majority of the district courts (and the Justice Department) give\n       us is completely bewildering: Both Title I and Titles II apply to employment,\n       although Title II says nothing at all on the subject and Title I lays out a\n       comprehensive scheme to deal with employment issues; Title I says an\n       employer must hire 15 employees to be sued for employment discrimination,\n       but you can get around this under Title II if your employer is an arm of the\n       State; Title I says you must exhaust administrative remedies, but you can\n       ignore this requirement too if you are employed by the State. If this is really\n       what Congress meant, then the ADA surely must rank as one of the great\n       drafting debacles of recent times. Unwilling to impute such sheer ineptitude\n       to Congress, the Court must part company with the current consensus.\n\nId. at 1445-46.\n\n                                              16\n\fanalysis of Title II regulations further makes clear that, while resort to administrative\n\nremedies is optional, it is not required.” Id. The court referenced the regulations, which\n\nplainly state that exhaustion is not required. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.172, Appendix A. We agree\n\nwith this analysis and note that it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and\n\npurposely where “ ‘it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in\n\nanother.’ ” See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (quoting United States v.\n\nWong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972).\n\n       4. Other courts’ resolution of the issue\n\n       The only other circuit to consider this issue did not really discuss it. The court\n\nallowed a plaintiff to proceed against the employer/hospital under both the Rehabilitation Act\n\nand Title II. See Doe v. University of Maryland Medical Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261 (4th Cir.\n\n1995). The court found that both Title II and the Rehabilitation Act “prohibit discrimination\n\nagainst an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.” Id. at 1264. The court noted that\n\nthe parties did not dispute that the Medical System was “a ‘public entity’ subject to the\n\nprovisions of Title II of the ADA.” Id. n.8. Accordingly, Doe does not provide much\n\nguidance on the issue before us for consideration.\n\n       In Wagner v. Texas A & M University, 939 F.Supp. 1297 (S.D.Tex. 1996), the court\n\ndetermined that a tenured professor could bring a Title II claim against the University when\n\nhe was not rehired to his same position following a medical disability leave. In so finding,\n\nthe court found that Title II obtains its remedies from the Rehabilitation Act, which does not\n\nrequire exhaustion of administrative remedies before filing suit. The court relied upon\n\n                                              17\n\fEthridge in making its conclusion. In its discussion, the court noted that Title II encompasses\n\nemployment actions. 939 F.Supp. at 1310. The court also discussed the policy anomaly\n\ncreated when Title II does not require exhaustion of administrative remedies. The court\n\nstated that Title I and Title II create “separate and distinct enforceable rights.” Id. “Title I\n\naddresses primarily the rights of disabled individuals in workplaces, while Title II addresses\n\nthe rights of disabled citizens vis-a-vis the government.” Id. The court stated that this\n\ninconsistency “is undesirable from a policy standpoint;” however, given the DOJ’s regulatory\n\nposture, the court would “not fill the gaps in the ADA in an attempt to effectuate a purported\n\nCongressional intent that is not entirely evident.” Id. See also Hernandez v. City of\n\nHartford, 959 F.Supp. 125 (D.Conn. 1997); Graboski v. Guiliani, 937 F.Supp. 258 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n1996); Silk v. City of Chicago, No. 95C0143, (N.D.Ill. June 7, 1996).\n\n       In Dertz v. City of Chicago, 912 F.Supp. 319 (N.D.Ill. 1995), the court discussed\n\nwhether plaintiffs must exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing a claim under Title\n\nII of the ADA. The plaintiffs in Dertz were former police officers for the City of Chicago\n\nwho had been placed on medical leave and were not allowed to return to their former\n\npositions. The plaintiffs filed suit under the Rehabilitation Act and Titles I and II of the\n\nADA. The court relied on the district court’s decision in Petersen v. Univ. of Wisconsin Bd.\n\nof Regents, 818 F.Supp. 1276 (W.D.Wis. 1993), to find that the procedural requirements of\n\nTitle I do not apply to Title II plaintiffs. Dertz, 912 F.Supp. at 324-25. Because the court\n\nfound that the plaintiffs were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies under\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\fTitle II, their actions were allowed to proceed. Id. at 325. See also Finley v. Giacobbe, 827\n\nF.Supp. 215, 219 (S.D.N.Y. 1993).\n\n       The District cites other district court cases which have decided this issue as did the\n\ndistrict court in this case. See e.g., Decker v. University of Houston, 970 F.Supp. 575\n\n(S.D.Tex. 1997); Iskander v. Rodeo Sanitary District, No. C-94-0479-SC, (N.D.Cal. Feb.7,\n\n1995), aff’d, 121 F.3d 715 (9th Cir. 1997)(Table). However, in light of the foregoing\n\ndiscussion, these cases are not persuasive. Even the district judge in this case noted that he\n\nwas “swimming against the current,” 942 F.Supp. at 1442, in deciding that Title II does not\n\nencompass employment discrimination claims.\n\n       In conclusion, we hold that Title II does state a cause of action for employment\n\ndiscrimination and reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment.\n\n       REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f",

Section\n\n12131 (“Title II”) and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 701, et seq. This case\n\ninvolves an issue of first impression in our circuit: whether Title II of the ADA encompasses\n\nemployment discrimination. We answer the question in the affirmative and, accordingly, we\n\nreverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment and remand this case for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Bledsoe was employed as a Resource Technician for the District from January 1988\n\nuntil his termination in October of 1992. In his employment, Bledsoe had to spend a large\n\nportion of his time walking, surveying, and performing manual labor in the fields. While\n\nperforming his duties, on February 26, 1990, Bledsoe sustained an injury to his knee for\n\nwhich he made a claim for workers’ compensation benefits. Based on the advice of his\n\ndoctors that he should refrain from excessive walking and walking on uneven terrain,\n\nBledsoe requested some form of accommodation from his supervisor. In response, the\n\nDistrict offered Bledsoe the position of Resource Conservationist, but he rejected the offer.\n\nIn October 1992, the District terminated Bledsoe.\n\n                                             2\n\f       Subsequent to his termination, Bledsoe settled his workers’ compensation case with\n\nPalm Beach County.1 The joint settlement agreement entered into by the parties contained\n\nthe following partial release provision:\n\n              As further consideration for the aforementioned payment, the\n       Employee/Claimant agrees and does hereby release, discharge, and surrender\n       any and all claims, whether or not asserted, against the Employer/Carrier or\n       Servicing Agent, or any of its officers, agents, servants, employees, directors,\n       successors, assigns, and any other person or entity so connected to the\n       Employer/Carrier or Servicing Agent, of any nature whatsoever, excepting\n       only (1) future medical pursuant to other provisions of this agreement, or (2)\n       penalties, interest or attorneys’ fees which might be due because of failure to\n       pay order approving this Joint Petition within 30 days.\n\nR1-34-Exh. A.\n\n       Bledsoe filed suit on June 24, 1994, against the District and Palm Beach County\n\nalleging that both of those entities were his “employer” within the meaning of Title I of the\n\nADA and the Rehabilitation Act and had violated his rights protected by those acts.\n\nSpecifically, Bledsoe alleged that he had a disability within the meaning of the law, that the\n\ndefendants had failed to accommodate his disability, and that the defendants discharged him\n\nas a result of his disability. Palm Beach County filed a motion to dismiss arguing that it was\n\nnot Bledsoe’s “employer” for purposes of the claims and that it had been released from the\n\nclaims by virtue of Bledsoe’s partial release of his workers’ compensation benefits. After\n\n\n       1\n          At all relevant times, the District was Bledsoe’s employer; however, because the\nDistrict had no more than five employees at a time, it participated in Palm Beach County’s\ninsurance plans, including its workers’ compensation plan. For a fee, the County adjusted\nworkers’ compensation claims made against the District. Therefore, Palm Beach County was\nthe District’s workers’ compensation carrier and the party with whom Bledsoe settled his\nworkers’ compensation claim.\n\n                                              3\n\fconsideration, the district court determined that Palm Beach County was not Bledsoe’s\n\nemployer and, therefore, summary judgment should be entered for it on all claims. Bledsoe\n\nhas not appealed the district court’s disposition that the County was not his employer.\n\n       The litigation continued against the District. Because the District alone did not have\n\nthe requisite number of employees to effect coverage under Title I of the ADA,2 Bledsoe\n\nsought leave to amend the complaint to bring his claim under Title II, and the district court\n\ngranted leave. The District filed a motion for summary judgment arguing first that Title II\n\nof the ADA does not apply to discrimination in employment and, second, that the partial\n\nrelease in Bledsoe’s joint settlement agreement with the County released his claims against\n\nthe District. Bledsoe opposed the motion. The district court entered summary judgment for\n\nthe District on both Bledsoe’s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims. Bledsoe then perfected\n\nthis appeal.\n\n\n\n                                    II. DISCUSSION\n\n       Bledsoe raises two issues for our review: (1) whether the district court properly\n\nconcluded that the workers’ compensation release bars Bledsoe’s federal claims of\n\nemployment discrimination; and (2) whether the district court properly determined that Title\n\nII of the ADA does not apply to discrimination in employment. We review the district\n\n\n\n       2\n          The term “employer” in Title I is defined as “a person engaged in an industry\naffecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or\nmore calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year. . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 12111(5).\n\n                                             4\n\fcourt’s order granting summary judgment de novo.

After conducting our review, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt improperly found that the workers’ compensation release barred Bledsoe’s federal\n\nclaims of employment discrimination and that Title II does not encompass employment\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n       A. Workers’ Compensation Release\n\n       In its determination that the workers’ compensation release barred Bledsoe’s ADA\n\nand Rehabilitation Act claims, the district court relied on F.M. v. Palm Beach County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1986160\"><a href=\"/opinion/1986160/fm-v-palm-beach-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Gardner-Denver Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108961\"><a href=\"/opinion/108961/alexander-v-gardner-denver-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52,\n\nn.15 (1974). The same principles should be equally applicable to waiver of rights under Title\n\nII of the ADA. See Rivera-Flores v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Caribbean, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739949\"><a href=\"/opinion/739949/gidel-rivera-flores-v-bristol-myers-squibb-caribbean/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.\n\n1997). The waiver of such remedial rights, however, “must be closely scrutinized,” and a\n\ncourt must look to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the release is\n\nknowing and voluntary. Puentes v. United Parcel Service, 86 F.3d at 198.\n\n                                             5\n\f       In Puentes, the plaintiffs, at the time of their terminations, were offered substantial\n\nseverance packages and the ability to resign “for personal reasons” on the condition that they\n\nexecute unambiguous release agreements waiving all employment discrimination claims\n\narising out of their terminations. Both plaintiffs executed the agreements, but later filed suit\n\nagainst UPS alleging racial and national origin discrimination. UPS moved for summary\n\njudgment, which the district court granted. On appeal, this court reversed, concluding that\n\na jury should decide whether the releases were knowingly and voluntarily executed.\n\n       The Puentes court explained that the following factors bear on whether a release is\n\nknowing and voluntary:\n\n       the plaintiff’s education and business experience; the amount of time the\n       plaintiff considered the agreement before signing it; the clarity of the\n       agreement; the plaintiff’s opportunity to consult with an attorney; the\n       employer’s encouragement or discouragement of consultation with an\n       attorney; and the consideration given in exchange for the waiver when\n       compared with the benefits to which the employee was already entitled.\n\n86 F.3d at 198 (quoting Beadle v. City of Tampa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684146\"><a href=\"/opinion/684146/66-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1540-66-empl-prac-dec-p-43455-aston-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 635 (11th Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117970\"><a href=\"/opinion/117970/doe-john-and-jane-doe-v-kirchner-otakar-baby-richard-a-minor-by-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995)). When reviewing these factors in Puentes, the court determined that\n\nthe plaintiffs did not have sufficient time to consider their release agreements and neither\n\nplaintiff had consulted with an attorney. The court also noted that neither plaintiff had any\n\nrole in deciding the terms of the agreement; the plaintiffs were simply handed printed forms.\n\n86 F.3d at 199. These factors raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiffs\n\nvoluntarily and knowingly executed the release agreements. Accordingly, the issue could\n\nnot be resolved by summary judgment.\n\n\n                                               6\n\f         The factors set forth in Puentes should have been considered by the district court in\n\nthis case. The district court should not have summarily adopted a decision from another case,\n\neven though it dealt with the exact same release form. Each factor should be independently\n\nanalyzed. In applying the Puentes factors, we conclude that a jury question exists about\n\nwhether Bledsoe voluntarily and knowingly released ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.\n\nThe language of the release indicates that Bledsoe was only settling his claim for wage loss\n\nbenefits under the workers’ compensation law. There is nothing in the release that suggests\n\nor mentions a waiver of federal discrimination claims. Additionally, there was no evidence\n\nin the record of any consideration given to Bledsoe in exchange for his allegedly waiving his\n\nrights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Moreover, Bledsoe and his counsel\n\nprovided affidavits to the district court stating that the only matters released were benefits\n\nfor wage loss available under the workers’ compensation law, thus creating an issue of fact\n\nas to what was released. The district court erred in granting summary judgment on this\n\nclaim.\n\n         B. Title II of the ADA\n\n         The district court held that Title II of the ADA does not encompass employment\n\ndiscrimination. Bledsoe3 urges this court to reverse and join several other courts which have\n\n\n\n\n         3\n        Joining Bledsoe’s position are the United States Department of Justice, the National\nEmployment Lawyers Association, and the American Civil Liberties Union, which all filed\namicus briefs with the court.\n\n                                               7\n\fheld that Title II does encompass employment discrimination.4 Our circuit has not squarely\n\naddressed the issue, but two of our recent decisions have assumed or implied that Title II\n\ncreates a cause of action for employment discrimination.

Congress further recognized that disabled\n\nindividuals face extraordinary barriers and discrimination by outright intentional segregation\n\nand often have “no legal recourse to redress such discrimination.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(4)\n\nand (5).   Moreover, in enacting the ADA, Congress hoped to increase employment\n\nopportunities for disabled people through prevention of employment discrimination. 42\n\nU.S.C. § 12101(a)(3), (8), and (9).\n\n       The provision of Title II allegedly violated by the District in this action provides:\n\n               Subject to the provisions of this [title], no qualified individual with a\n       disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in\n       or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public\n       entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. “Public entity” is defined to include “(A) any State or local government;\n\n[and] (B) any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State\n\nor States or local government; . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A) & (B).\n\n       The statutory language used by Congress in the creation of Title II is brief. Extensive\n\nlegislative commentary regarding the applicability of Title II to employment discrimination,\n\nhowever, is so pervasive as to belie any contention that Title II does not apply to employment\n\nactions. The Report of the United States House of Representatives Judiciary Committee\n\nstated, “[i]n the area of employment, title II incorporates the duty set forth in the regulations\n\nfor Sections 501, 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to provide a ‘reasonable\n\naccommodation’ that does not constitute an ‘undue hardship.’” See H.R.Rep. No. 101-\n\n\n                                               9\n\f485(III), at 50 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 473. In explaining the forms of\n\ndiscrimination prohibited by Title II, the Report noted that:\n\n       The Committee intends, however, that the forms of discrimination prohibited\n       by section 202 [codified as 42 U.S.C. § 12132] be identical to those set out in\n       the applicable provisions of titles I and III of this legislation . . . . In addition,\n       activities which do not fit into the employment or public accommodations\n       context are governed by the analogous section 504 regulations.\n\nH.R.Rep.No. 101- 485 (II), at 84 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 367. The\n\nReport further notes: “The purpose of title II is to continue to break down barriers to the\n\nintegrated participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of community life. The\n\nCommittee intends that title II work in the same manner as Section 504.” 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\nat 472-73.\n\n       It is significant that Congress intended Title II to work in the same manner as Section\n\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act, because Section 504 was so focused on employment\n\ndiscrimination that Congress enacted subsequent legislation to clarify that Section 504\n\napplied to other forms of discrimination in addition to employment discrimination.

In discussing the issue, we noted that “[t]he stated purpose of the ADA is ‘to\n\nprovide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination\n\nagainst individuals with disabilities.’ ” 99 F.3d at 1073, quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1).\n\nWe acknowledged that Title I of the ADA applies to the private sector and provides for the\n\nelimination of disability-based discrimination. We then stated that “Title II of the ADA,\n\nwhich applies to public sector employment, contains a parallel provision.” Id. (emphasis\n\nadded). Later, we again assumed that Title II covered employment: “Title II (the public\n\nsector title).” Id. at 1074. Thus, without directly discussing the issue with which this court\n\nis presently faced, our court has assumed that Title II covers public employment\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n       Additionally, in Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740413\"><a href=\"/opinion/740413/william-a-holbrook-v-city-of-alpharetta-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1522</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1997),\n\nwe addressed the question whether claims brought pursuant to Title II of the ADA involving\n\nevents that occurred prior to the effective date of Title I are actionable under the ADA or the\n\n                                               14\n\fRehabilitation Act of 1973. In discussing this issue, we noted the language of Title II, the\n\nfederal regulations promulgated pursuant to the ADA, and the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”) guide. 112 F.3d at 1528-29. The court then determined\n\nthat “Title II thus incorporates by reference the substantive, detailed regulations prohibiting\n\ndiscrimination against disabled individuals contained in Title I.” Id. at 1529. We further\n\nnoted:\n\n         The above regulations suggest that the provisions of Title II extending the\n         protections afforded to employees in the private sector under Title I to state\n         and local government workers became effective only when Title I went into\n         effect. As explicitly described in the EEOC manual, the Rehabilitation Act\n         provided a remedy for discrimination in public employment prior to the\n         effective date of Title I. We conclude that Title II of the ADA did not become\n         effective until the date on which Title I became effective, July 26, 1992, and,\n         prior to that date, a plaintiff’s remedy for discrimination under Title II of the\n         ADA was the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\nId. Thus, the court implicitly determined that Title II was the “new replacement” for the\n\nRehabilitation Act, which is what the legislative history indicates.\n\n         Although not decisions of our court, Lundstedt v. City of Miami, 5 A.D. Cases 568\n\n(S.D.Fla. Oct. 11, 1995), and Ethridge v. State of Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1403074\"><a href=\"/opinion/1403074/ethridge-v-state-of-ala/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (M.D.Ala.\n\n1993), two district court decisions from within our circuit, held that Title II clearly\n\nencompasses employment discrimination by public entities. 5 A.D. Cases at 572-74; 847\n\nF.Supp. at 906. The district court in Ethridge found that although a plain reading of Title II\n\ndoes not reveal whether it covers employment discrimination, the legislative history of and\n\nregulations promulgated under Title II make clear that the section prohibits employment\n\ndiscrimination by public entities on the basis of disability. The court noted that the primary\n\n                                                15\n\fpurpose of Title II was to extend the reach of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and that\n\nSection 504 “clearly applies to employment discrimination.” 847 F.Supp. at 906, citing\n\nConsolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111111\"><a href=\"/opinion/111111/consolidated-rail-corporation-v-darrone/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). The Ethridge court also discussed\n\nthe House Report addressing Title II and the regulations implementing Title II to find that\n\nTitle II covers employment discrimination.\n\n       Additionally, the Ethridge court noted the difference in the application of the\n\nexhaustion requirement which is mandatory in Title I but not in Title II of the ADA.7\n\nThe court found that although Title I requires exhaustion, Title II does not because it\n\n“incorporates the enforcement procedures of the Rehabilitation Act, . . . which do not require\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies for non-federal employees.” 847 F.Supp. at 907. “An\n\n\n\n       7\n         The district court in this case expressed great concern in the inconsistency in the\nexhaustion requirement if the court found that Title II covered employment discrimination.\n“Acceptance of the ‘no exhaustion rule,’ when coupled with the slighting of Title II’s plain\nmeaning and the redundancy of Titles I and II, renders the entire statutory framework a\nmonstrous distortion.” 942 F.Supp. at 1445. The court further stated that:\n\n       The statute the majority of the district courts (and the Justice Department) give\n       us is completely bewildering: Both Title I and Titles II apply to employment,\n       although Title II says nothing at all on the subject and Title I lays out a\n       comprehensive scheme to deal with employment issues; Title I says an\n       employer must hire 15 employees to be sued for employment discrimination,\n       but you can get around this under Title II if your employer is an arm of the\n       State; Title I says you must exhaust administrative remedies, but you can\n       ignore this requirement too if you are employed by the State. If this is really\n       what Congress meant, then the ADA surely must rank as one of the great\n       drafting debacles of recent times. Unwilling to impute such sheer ineptitude\n       to Congress, the Court must part company with the current consensus.\n\nId. at 1445-46.\n\n                                              16\n\fanalysis of Title II regulations further makes clear that, while resort to administrative\n\nremedies is optional, it is not required.” Id. The court referenced the regulations, which\n\nplainly state that exhaustion is not required. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.172, Appendix A. We agree\n\nwith this analysis and note that it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and\n\npurposely where “ ‘it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in\n\nanother.’ ” See Russello v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1983) (quoting United States v.\n\nWong Kim Bo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"307927\"><a href=\"/opinion/307927/united-states-v-wong-kim-bo-aka-yee-kuk-ho-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 722 (5th Cir. 1972).\n\n       4. Other courts’ resolution of the issue\n\n       The only other circuit to consider this issue did not really discuss it. The court\n\nallowed a plaintiff to proceed against the employer/hospital under both the Rehabilitation Act\n\nand Title II. See Doe v. University of Maryland Medical Sys. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692288\"><a href=\"/opinion/692288/john-doe-v-university-of-maryland-medical-system-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir.\n\n1995). The court found that both Title II and the Rehabilitation Act “prohibit discrimination\n\nagainst an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.” Id. at 1264. The court noted that\n\nthe parties did not dispute that the Medical System was “a ‘public entity’ subject to the\n\nprovisions of Title II of the ADA.” Id. n.8. Accordingly, Doe does not provide much\n\nguidance on the issue before us for consideration.\n\n       In Wagner v. Texas A & M University, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1511295\"><a href=\"/opinion/1511295/wagner-v-texas-a-m-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1297</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D.Tex. 1996), the court\n\ndetermined that a tenured professor could bring a Title II claim against the University when\n\nhe was not rehired to his same position following a medical disability leave. In so finding,\n\nthe court found that Title II obtains its remedies from the Rehabilitation Act, which does not\n\nrequire exhaustion of administrative remedies before filing suit. The court relied upon\n\n                                              17\n\fEthridge in making its conclusion. In its discussion, the court noted that Title II encompasses\n\nemployment actions. 939 F.Supp. at 1310. The court also discussed the policy anomaly\n\ncreated when Title II does not require exhaustion of administrative remedies. The court\n\nstated that Title I and Title II create “separate and distinct enforceable rights.” Id. “Title I\n\naddresses primarily the rights of disabled individuals in workplaces, while Title II addresses\n\nthe rights of disabled citizens vis-a-vis the government.” Id. The court stated that this\n\ninconsistency “is undesirable from a policy standpoint;” however, given the DOJ’s regulatory\n\nposture, the court would “not fill the gaps in the ADA in an attempt to effectuate a purported\n\nCongressional intent that is not entirely evident.” Id.

The plaintiffs in Dertz were former police officers for the City of Chicago\n\nwho had been placed on medical leave and were not allowed to return to their former\n\npositions. The plaintiffs filed suit under the Rehabilitation Act and Titles I and II of the\n\nADA. The court relied on the district court’s decision in Petersen v. Univ. of Wisconsin Bd.\n\nof Regents, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1491371\"><a href=\"/opinion/1491371/petersen-v-university-of-wisconsin-bd-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
