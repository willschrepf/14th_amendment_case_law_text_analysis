In his complaint, Spencer alleged\n\nmore than twenty violations of Title II of the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (“Title II”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131, and § 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation    Act    of   1973   (“Rehabilitation         Act”),   29    U.S.C.\n\n§ 794(a), and advanced as well several constitutional claims\n\nagainst individual defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.                       After a\n\ncomplex procedural history which we recount below, the state\n\ndefendants     moved    to    dismiss       for   lack   of     subject      matter\n\njurisdiction.    The district court granted the motion and dismissed\n\nSpencer’s complaint in its entirety.              Spencer appealed only the\n\ndistrict     court’s    decisions    with     respect    to     §   504     of   the\n\nRehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA.\n\n     Because the district court erred in dismissing Spencer’s\n\nclaims under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, we reverse and remand\n\nwith instructions to reinstate those claims.              As to the Title II\n\nclaims, however, counsel informed the court at oral argument that\n\nSpencer agreed to their dismissal.            We therefore decline to reach\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fthe question of the constitutionality of Title II’s abrogation of\n\nsovereign immunity for claims against state entities not alleging\n\nconstitutional violations argued in Spencer’s brief.                     See Lyng v.\n\nNw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 445 (1988) (“A\n\nfundamental      and   longstanding     principle       of     judicial    restraint\n\nrequires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in\n\nadvance of the necessity of deciding them.”).\n\n\n\n                                        I.\n\n     Spencer is currently an inmate in the federal correctional\n\nsystem.    According to his complaint, he suffers from a variety of\n\nmental    and    physical   ailments,    including        a    “seizure    disorder,\n\nneurological      damage,     infarction     (in    the       brain),    involuntary\n\nmovement disorder, memory deficit disorder, cognitive dysfunction,\n\nmobility    disability,       and   a   myriad     of     non-psychotic        mental\n\ndisorders.”      J.A. 19.\n\n     In 2001, while incarcerated by the Virginia Department of\n\nCorrections (“VDOC”) at the Brunswick Correctional Center, Spencer\n\nfiled a complaint in the Eastern District of Virginia seeking\n\ndamages and injunctive relief against the former Virginia Attorney\n\nGeneral Mark Earley, the former and current Directors of VDOC, VDOC\n\nitself,    the    Brunswick     Correctional       Center       Office    of   Health\n\nServices, and prison psychologist Eric Madsen.                  He contended that\n\ndefendants discriminated against him because of his disabilities,\n\n\n                                        5\n\fin violation of Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, and the United States Constitution.                Spencer’s twenty-four\n\nclaims assert an extensive pattern of wrongful behavior.                           For\n\nexample, Spencer alleges that he was locked in the building during\n\na fire drill, despite defendants’ knowledge of his disabilities,\n\nand    threatened      with    disciplinary       action     for   delaying        and\n\ninterfering     with    the   drill.      He   also    contends        that   he   was\n\nimproperly denied single-cell housing and the medical services\n\naccommodations necessitated by his disabilities.\n\n       In May 2003, the district court dismissed Spencer’s complaint\n\nin its entirety.       The court concluded that: (1) his Title II claims\n\nagainst state entities and individuals in their official capacities\n\nwere   barred   by     the    Eleventh    Amendment;       (2)   his    claims     for\n\ninjunctive relief were moot as he had been released from VDOC\n\ncustody; (3) his Title II claims against named defendants in their\n\nindividual capacities were improper because there is no individual\n\nliability under the ADA; (4) his Rehabilitation Act claims lacked\n\nfactual   support;      and   (5)   he   failed   to   successfully       allege     a\n\nviolation of the Constitution, as is required to sustain a claim\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.         On appeal, this court summarily affirmed\n\nthe dismissal “for the reasons stated by the district court.”\n\nSpencer v. Earley, 88 Fed. Appx. 599, 600 (4th Cir. 2004).\n\n       Spencer then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, asking\n\nthe Supreme Court to review the portion of our decision finding\n\n\n                                         6\n\fthat the Eleventh Amendment barred his claims against the state\n\nentities under Title II of the ADA.           The Supreme Court granted\n\ncertiorari, vacated this court’s judgment, and remanded the case\n\nfor further proceedings in light of Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509\n\n(2004), in which the Court held that Title II validly abrogates\n\nstates’ Eleventh Amendment immunity in the context of access to\n\njudicial services.      See Spencer v. Earley, 543 U.S. 1018 (2004).\n\nThis court, in turn, remanded the case to the district court with\n\nthe same instruction.     See Spencer v. Earley, No. 037037 (4th Cir.\n\nJan. 20, 2005).      On remand, Virginia filed a motion to dismiss,\n\nasserting its Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity to suit.               The\n\ndistrict court subsequently stayed all proceedings pending the\n\noutcome   of   the   Supreme   Court’s   decision   in   United   States    v.\n\nGeorgia, 546 U.S. 151 (2006), which presented the question of\n\nwhether Title II validly abrogates states’ sovereign immunity from\n\nsuit in the prison context.\n\n     The Supreme Court held in Georgia that Title II does abrogate\n\nsuch immunity in the prison context for claims that also allege\n\nconstitutional violations.        Georgia, 546 U.S. at 158-59.             The\n\nSupreme Court declined, however, to decide the extent to which\n\nsovereign immunity is vitiated for non-constitutional Title II\n\nclaims because the lower courts had not yet determined whether the\n\nclaims in that case asserted independently viable constitutional\n\nclaims or purely statutory ones.         The Supreme Court instructed on\n\n\n                                     7\n\fremand that the lower courts must determine, “on a claim-by-claim\n\nbasis, (1) which aspects of the State’s alleged conduct violated\n\nTitle II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the\n\nFourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated\n\nTitle II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether\n\nCongress’s purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that\n\nclass of conduct is nevertheless valid.”   Id. at 159.\n\n     On the heels of the decision in Georgia, the state defendants\n\nfiled, and the district court granted, the motion to dismiss which\n\nforms the basis of this appeal.1    To frame our analysis, we set\n\nforth the district court’s rationale in some detail.\n\n     The district court first found that the Supreme Court’s prior\n\norder in this case, and the decisions in Tennessee v. Lane and\n\nUnited States v. Georgia, did not call “into question” the district\n\ncourt’s previous dismissal of (1) Spencer’s claims for injunctive\n\nrelief; (2) his Title II claims against named defendants in their\n\nindividual capacities; (3) Spencer’s Rehabilitation Act claims; or\n\n(4) his § 1983 claims, which were previously dismissed for failure\n\nto allege a constitutional violation. Spencer v. Earley, No. 1:01-\n\ncv-01578, *5-6 (E.D. Va. Jan. 30, 2007). With respect to Spencer’s\n\nRehabilitation Act claims, the district court elaborated further\n\n\n\n     1\n      While the district court’s ruling was pending, the United\nStates intervened as an appellant, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403, to\ndefend the constitutionality of Title II of the ADA, as applied in\nthe prison context, and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n                                8\n\fand reiterated its view that Spencer failed to present evidentiary\n\nsupport for his allegations. See id. at *5.\n\n     Turning   to   Spencer’s   Title   II   claims   against   the   state\n\nentities and actors in their official capacities, the district\n\ncourt applied the framework mandated by the Supreme Court in\n\nGeorgia.   In doing so, it first concluded that Spencer had stated\n\ntwelve valid Title II claims.2    The court then found, however, that\n\n\n     2\n      Briefly stated, Spencer’s valid Title II disability\ndiscrimination claims consisted of the following:\nB. Defendants denied Spencer’s reasonable request to use books to\ncomplete the required Breaking Barriers program in his cell because\nhis disabilities prevented him from attending the classroom\nsessions;\nD. Defendants denied Spencer’s reasonable request to have meetings\nwith his psychologist recorded for future use because his\ndisabilities prevented him from taking notes;\nF. Spencer was denied “single-cell housing and medical services\naccommodations,” as necessitated by his disabilities, and the\nwarden denied his reasonable request pertaining to access to the\ngeneral population mess hall;\nH. Defendants required Spencer to “perform feats, which by reason\nof his disabilities placed him at substantial risk of irreparable\nphysical injury” by requiring him to stand in an outdoor medication\ndispensing line on thirty occasions;\nK. Defendants locked Spencer in his building during a fire drill,\ndespite knowledge of his disabilities, and threatened him with\ndisciplinary action for delaying and interfering with the drill;\nM. Spencer was “denied authorization to display placards used to\nmotivate and remind him to attend to his personal hygiene”;\nN. He was denied access to the law library and refused assistance\nwith obtaining books, instead being insulted for his disabilities;\nO.   He   was  inappropriately   refused   him   the  single   cell\naccommodations required by his physical and mental disabilities;\nP. He was housed in the residential building farthest from all\ninmate services making it very difficult and painful for him to\nobtain such services;\nS. Spencer was thrown in administrative segregation under false\npretenses because a certain officer “did not want a disabled\nindividual with Spencer’s disabilities in his building”;\nW. Defendants denied Spencer’s request to be placed in single-\n\n                                   9\n\fnone       of    the   twelve   claims   alleged   an     actual   constitutional\n\nviolation, and Title II does not “validly abrogate[] [Eleventh\n\nAmendment] state sovereign immunity in the prison context for\n\n[Title II] claims not based on unconstitutional conduct.”                    Spencer\n\nv.   Earley,        No.   1:01-cv-01578,    *16   (E.D.   Va.   Jan.   30,   2007).\n\nAccordingly, the court dismissed Spencer’s remaining Title II\n\nclaims, and this appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                           II.\n\n       We now consider the dismissal of Spencer’s claims under § 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act.           We review the granting of a motion to\n\ndismiss de novo.          See Veney v. Wyche, 293 F.3d 726, 730 (4th Cir.\n\n2002).3         The district court summarily dismissed these claims on the\n\n\n\noccupancy housing and the inmate honor housing program, which\nprovides single-occupancy housing to some non-disabled inmates;\nX. Defendants penalized Spencer for his inability to complete the\nBreaking Barriers program despite their refusal to make reasonable\naccommodations to allow Spencer to participate in the program.\nJ.A. 21-28, 41-51, 83-85.\n       3\n      Although Virginia argues vigorously on appeal that even if\nSpencer has stated valid claims under § 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct they are nevertheless barred by state sovereign immunity, its\ncontentions in this regard are foreclosed by circuit precedent.\nThis court has previously held that state agencies that knowingly\nand willingly accept clearly conditioned federal funding validly\nwaive their Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to claims for\ndamages under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.     Constantine v.\nRectors and Visitors of George Mason Univ., 411 F.3d 474, 495-96\n(4th Cir. 2005).    Virginia does not dispute that it receives\nfederal funding for its prison system and the programs therein.\nThus, Spencer’s Rehabilitation Act claims are not barred by the\nEleventh Amendment. See id.\n\n                                           10\n\fgrounds that Spencer failed to present arguments in support of\n\nthem.4       Both Appellants, Spencer and the United States, respond\n\nthat       “[b]ecause    Title      II   of     the    ADA   and   [§    504    of]    the\n\nRehabilitation Act provide for identical causes of action, all of\n\n. . . Spencer’s [twelve] claims that made out a prima facie case\n\nunder      [Title   II   of]     the     ADA    also   state   a   claim       under   the\n\nRehabilitation Act.”           Appellant’s Br. at 58.          For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we agree.\n\n                                               A.\n\n       Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint contain only “a short\n\nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\n\nentitled to relief.”           Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).            The Supreme Court\n\nhas recently emphasized that the purpose of this rule is to provide\n\nthe defendant with “fair notice of what . . . the claim is and the\n\ngrounds upon which it rests.”              Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127\n\nS. Ct. 1955, 1964 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47\n\n(1957).       Thus, while a complaint comprised solely of labels and\n\nconclusions is insufficient to satisfy this rule, specific facts,\n\nelaborate      arguments,      or    fanciful       language   are      not   necessary.\n\nErickson v. Pardus, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 2200 (2007).\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      Although it is not completely clear from the district court’s\nopinion,   we   assume   that   the   court   dismissed   Spencer’s\nRehabilitation Act claims for “failure to state a claim upon which\nrelief can be granted.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n                                               11\n\f       More specifically, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that\n\nin the context of a motion to dismiss, a district court must\n\nconstrue a pro se complaint liberally.                 Such a complaint, “however\n\ninartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than\n\nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.”                   Id. (internal quotations\n\nomitted).     Dismissal of a pro se complaint such as Spencer’s for\n\nfailure to state a valid claim is therefore only appropriate when,\n\nafter applying this liberal construction, it appears “beyond doubt\n\nthat the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his\n\nclaim which would entitle him to relief.”                  Haines v. Kerner, 404\n\nU.S.   519,   521    (1972)        (internal     quotations    omitted)     (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n       Viewing Spencer’s complaint under this standard, its dismissal\n\nwas inappropriate.            Spencer plainly provides the defendants with\n\nnotice of his claims and the grounds therefor.                      It could scarcely\n\nbe     clearer      that      he     is     alleging     overlapping       disability\n\ndiscrimination claims under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and\n\nTitle II of the ADA, and he sets forth in some detail the alleged\n\nconduct    giving      rise    to    such   claims.      For   example,     Spencer’s\n\noriginal complaint is entitled, “Complaint Under Title II of the\n\nAmericans With Disabilities Act/§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of\n\n1973,”    J.A.   18,    and     he   refers      throughout    to    the   defendants’\n\nviolations of his rights under the “RA,” or Rehabilitation Act.\n\nSee, e.g., J.A. 21, 46.              Perhaps the strongest refutation of the\n\n\n                                            12\n\fdistrict court’s conclusion can be found in Claim B of Spencer’s\n\ncomplaint, in which he states the following:\n\n     B. (1). Spencer’s March 2001 “Institutional Treatment\n     Plan” at [Brunswick Correctional Center] indicated that\n     he needed to complete a so-called “Breaking Barriers”\n     program.   Due to Spencer’s Disabilities, i.e., memory\n     deficit disorder, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety [and]\n     panic disorder, (others omitted) he is unable to attend\n     a classroom setting, Spencer submitted a request . . .\n     for “reasonable accommodation” under the ADA and RA\n     ([Rehabilitation Act]) to borrow the programs books and\n     study them in his cell or a private room, in April 2001.\n     On 4-13-01 by written response to Spencer’s ADA/RA\n     reasonable accommodations request to participate in said\n     program, [the Assistant Warden of Programs] illegally\n     discriminates against Spencer and illegally excludes him\n     from said program by reason of his disabilities, by\n     denying him access/accommodation to participate in the\n     program.\n\n\nJ.A. 21 (emphasis added); see § 504 of Rehabilitation Act, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 794(a), (prohibiting exclusion from programs “solely by\n\nreason” of one’s disabilities).       After setting forth evidence\n\nsupporting the allegation that he was excluded from the program\n\n“solely by reason” of his disability, Spencer concludes Claim B by\n\nasserting that he was injured as a result of such exclusion and\n\nseeking damages and relief of any “type as may be found to be\n\nmerited after trial.”   J.A. 21-22.   Further, in the amendments to\n\nhis complaint, Spencer, again, specifically alleges that defendants\n\nviolated his rights “under the Rehabilitation Act,” and repeatedly\n\ncites § 504.   J.A. 45-47.   Thus, we reject the district court’s\n\n\n\n\n                                13\n\fcontention that Spencer made “no arguments” under § 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act.5\n\n     Spencer’s complaint, with respect to the twelve claims at\n\nissue, also contained “enough facts to state a claim to relief\n\n[under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act] that is plausible on its\n\nface.”   Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1974.    Our conclusion in this regard\n\nis reinforced by the district court’s finding that those claims\n\nsuccessfully alleged violations of Title II of the ADA.     Both § 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA were enacted, in\n\npart, to prohibit public entities from subjecting any person to\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability.     See Baird v. Rose, 192\n\nF.3d 462, 469 (4th Cir. 1999).          Title II provides that “no\n\nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n\ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the\n\nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public\n\nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”         42\n\nU.S.C. § 12132.      Similarly, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\nprovides   that   “[n]o   otherwise    qualified   individual   with   a\n\ndisability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability,\n\nbe excluded from the participation in, or be denied the benefits\n\n\n\n     5\n      Curiously, after concluding that “Spencer presented no\narguments” under the Rehabilitation Act, the district court, in the\nsame opinion, notes several times that Spencer “allege[s] that\ndefendants’ conduct violated . . . § 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct.” Spencer v. Earley, No. 1:01-cv-01578, *5, 7, 12 (E.D. Va.\nJan. 30, 2007) (memorandum opinion).\n\n                                  14\n\fof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\n\nreceiving Federal financial assistance.”        29 U.S.C. § 794(a).\n\n     This   court   has   repeatedly     held   that   “[t]he      ADA    and\n\nRehabilitation Act generally are construed to impose the same\n\nrequirements,”   and   “[b]ecause    the   language    of   the    Acts    is\n\nsubstantially the same, we apply the same analysis to both.”\n\nBaird, 192 F.3d at 468 (quoting Doe, 50 F.3d at 1264 n. 9).              Thus,\n\nalthough the two statutes have minor differences, in general, a\n\nplaintiff seeking recovery under “either statute” must allege that\n\n(1) he has a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to receive\n\nthe benefits of a public service, program, or activity; and (3) he\n\nwas “excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of such\n\nservice, program, or activity, or otherwise discriminated against,\n\non the basis of h[is] disability.”       Constantine, 411 F.3d at 498.\n\n     While Spencer may not mention § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\nin each of his successfully pleaded Title II claims, he initially\n\nstates that his claims are brought under both statutes and none of\n\nthe Acts’ established differences are implicated.6                Thus, the\n\n\n     6\n      “Despite the overall similarity of . . . Title II of the ADA\nand § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the language of these two\nstatutory provisions regarding the causative link between\ndiscrimination and adverse action is significantly dissimilar.”\nBaird, 192 F.3d at 469. However, the failure to show causation was\nnot the basis of the district court’s dismissal of Spencer’s\nRehabilitation Act claims.    Spencer’s complaint plainly alleges\nboth that he was discriminated against “solely by reason” of his\ndisability, as required by the Rehabilitation Act, and that he was\n“otherwise qualified” for the program or protection at issue, as\nrequired by Title II. We do not hold here that every successfully\n\n                                    15\n\fdistrict court’s finding that Spencer successfully pleaded twelve\n\nclaims under Title II should have foreclosed the blanket dismissal\n\nof the same twelve claims brought pursuant to § 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act.\n\n                                            B.\n\n     Nonetheless, Virginia contends that the law of the case\n\ndoctrine precludes our review of the district court’s decision\n\nregarding Spencer’s Rehabilitation Act claims.                       It asserts that\n\n“[b]ecause     Spencer     did   not   seek        Supreme   Court    review   of   the\n\ndismissal of the § 504 [of the Rehabilitation Act] claims, these\n\nclaims   are    not    implicated      in    the     Supreme   Court’s    subsequent\n\ndecision to grant certiorari, vacate, and remand [this case] to\n\nthis [c]ourt.”        Appellee’s Br. at 37.          Contrary to this assertion,\n\nhowever, the law of the case doctrine cannot pose an insurmountable\n\nobstacle to our reaching the conclusion here.\n\n     The law of the case doctrine “posits that when a court decides\n\nupon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the\n\nsame issues in subsequent stages in the same case.”                       Arizona v.\n\nCalifornia, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983).                 After the district court’s\n\nfirst dismissal of his claims, Spencer appealed them all, including\n\nhis § 504 claims, to this court.                 This court, with no independent\n\nanalysis,      summarily    affirmed        “for    the   reasons    stated    by   the\n\n\npleaded claim under Title II of the ADA necessarily states a valid\nclaim under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n\n                                            16\n\fdistrict court.”   See Spencer v. Earley, 88 Fed. Appx. at 600.           The\n\nSupreme Court granted certiorari, vacated this court’s entire\n\nopinion, including the decision with respect to § 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation   Act,   and   remanded   the   case   to   this   court   for\n\nreconsideration.    See Spencer v. Earley, 543 U.S. 1018 (2004).\n\nThis court, in turn, vacated and remanded the district court’s\n\ndecision.    See Spencer v. Earley, No. 037037 (4th Cir. Jan. 20,\n\n2005).   Given this procedural history, we are hard-pressed to find\n\nany remaining, decided “law of the case” from this court’s earlier\n\nopinion.7   Cf. Johnson v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chicago, 457 U.S.\n\n52, 53-54 (1982) (“Because we have vacated the Court of Appeals’\n\njudgments in this case, the doctrine of the law of the case does\n\nnot constrain either the District Court or, should an appeal\n\nsubsequently be taken, the Court of Appeals.”); Adams v. Aiken, 41\n\nF.3d 175, 179 (4th Cir. 1994) (“Inasmuch as the Supreme Court\n\nvacated our judgment, we are not precluded from reconsidering\n\n[another issue not affected by the Supreme Court’s mandate] in the\n\nlight of the Court's most recent opinion.”).\n\n\n\n     7\n      The district court appears to have been operating under the\nsame assumption. Rather than concluding that it was precluded by\nthe law of the case doctrine from considering Spencer’s\nRehabilitation Act claims, as Virginia contends, the district court\nmerely concluded that its previous ruling on this subject had not\nbeen “call[ed] . . . into question,” and then proceeded to make\nfindings and, again, issue a ruling on the subject. See Spencer v.\nEarley, No. 1:01-cv-01578, *5-6 (E.D. Va. Jan. 30, 2007)\n(memorandum opinion).\n\n\n                                   17\n\f     Assuming for argument’s sake, however, that the law of the\n\ncase doctrine does apply here, it still does not “limit th[is]\n\ncourt’s power” to review the dismissal of Spencer’s Rehabilitation\n\nAct claims.     Castro v. United States, 540 U.S. 375, 384 (2003)\n\n(internal quotations omitted). It is well established that the law\n\nof the case doctrine “merely expresses the practice of courts\n\ngenerally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, [and is] not\n\na limit to their power.”    Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating\n\nCorp., 486 U.S. 800, 817 (1988) (internal citations and quotations\n\nomitted).     “A court [therefore] has the power to revisit prior\n\ndecisions of its own or of a coordinate court in any circumstance,”\n\nand should readily do so where, as here, “the initial decision was\n\nclearly erroneous.”    Id. (emphasis added and internal quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n     Thus, we reverse the district court’s decision as to Spencer’s\n\nRehabilitation Act claims and remand with instructions to the\n\ndistrict court to reinstate the twelve claims found to properly\n\nallege violations of Title II of the ADA.8    As previously noted,\n\nSpencer has abandoned his appeal of the district court’s dismissal\n\nof his claims under Title II of the ADA.   We therefore decline to\n\nanswer the constitutional questions implicated in those claims, and\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      We refer here to the claims designated by both Spencer and\nthe district court as claims B, D, F, H, K, M, N, O, P, S, W, and\nX.\n\n                                 18\n\finstead affirm that portion of the district court’s judgment on\n\nabandonment grounds.\n\n\n\n                              III.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court\n\nis\n\n                              AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART,\n                                  AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n\n\n\n\n                               19\n\f",

In his complaint, Spencer alleged\n\nmore than twenty violations of Title II of the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (“Title II”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131, and § 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation    Act    of   1973   (“Rehabilitation         Act”),   29    U.S.C.\n\n§ 794(a), and advanced as well several constitutional claims\n\nagainst individual defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.                       After a\n\ncomplex procedural history which we recount below, the state\n\ndefendants     moved    to    dismiss       for   lack   of     subject      matter\n\njurisdiction.    The district court granted the motion and dismissed\n\nSpencer’s complaint in its entirety.              Spencer appealed only the\n\ndistrict     court’s    decisions    with     respect    to     §   504     of   the\n\nRehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA.\n\n     Because the district court erred in dismissing Spencer’s\n\nclaims under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, we reverse and remand\n\nwith instructions to reinstate those claims.              As to the Title II\n\nclaims, however, counsel informed the court at oral argument that\n\nSpencer agreed to their dismissal.            We therefore decline to reach\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fthe question of the constitutionality of Title II’s abrogation of\n\nsovereign immunity for claims against state entities not alleging\n\nconstitutional violations argued in Spencer’s brief.

According to his complaint, he suffers from a variety of\n\nmental    and    physical   ailments,    including        a    “seizure    disorder,\n\nneurological      damage,     infarction     (in    the       brain),    involuntary\n\nmovement disorder, memory deficit disorder, cognitive dysfunction,\n\nmobility    disability,       and   a   myriad     of     non-psychotic        mental\n\ndisorders.”      J.A. 19.\n\n     In 2001, while incarcerated by the Virginia Department of\n\nCorrections (“VDOC”) at the Brunswick Correctional Center, Spencer\n\nfiled a complaint in the Eastern District of Virginia seeking\n\ndamages and injunctive relief against the former Virginia Attorney\n\nGeneral Mark Earley, the former and current Directors of VDOC, VDOC\n\nitself,    the    Brunswick     Correctional       Center       Office    of   Health\n\nServices, and prison psychologist Eric Madsen.                  He contended that\n\ndefendants discriminated against him because of his disabilities,\n\n\n                                        5\n\fin violation of Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, and the United States Constitution.                Spencer’s twenty-four\n\nclaims assert an extensive pattern of wrongful behavior.                           For\n\nexample, Spencer alleges that he was locked in the building during\n\na fire drill, despite defendants’ knowledge of his disabilities,\n\nand    threatened      with    disciplinary       action     for   delaying        and\n\ninterfering     with    the   drill.

The court concluded that: (1) his Title II claims\n\nagainst state entities and individuals in their official capacities\n\nwere   barred   by     the    Eleventh    Amendment;       (2)   his    claims     for\n\ninjunctive relief were moot as he had been released from VDOC\n\ncustody; (3) his Title II claims against named defendants in their\n\nindividual capacities were improper because there is no individual\n\nliability under the ADA; (4) his Rehabilitation Act claims lacked\n\nfactual   support;      and   (5)   he   failed   to   successfully       allege     a\n\nviolation of the Constitution, as is required to sustain a claim\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

Georgia, 546 U.S. at 158-59.             The\n\nSupreme Court declined, however, to decide the extent to which\n\nsovereign immunity is vitiated for non-constitutional Title II\n\nclaims because the lower courts had not yet determined whether the\n\nclaims in that case asserted independently viable constitutional\n\nclaims or purely statutory ones.         The Supreme Court instructed on\n\n\n                                     7\n\fremand that the lower courts must determine, “on a claim-by-claim\n\nbasis, (1) which aspects of the State’s alleged conduct violated\n\nTitle II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the\n\nFourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated\n\nTitle II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether\n\nCongress’s purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that\n\nclass of conduct is nevertheless valid.”   Id. at 159.\n\n     On the heels of the decision in Georgia, the state defendants\n\nfiled, and the district court granted, the motion to dismiss which\n\nforms the basis of this appeal.1    To frame our analysis, we set\n\nforth the district court’s rationale in some detail.\n\n     The district court first found that the Supreme Court’s prior\n\norder in this case, and the decisions in Tennessee v. Lane and\n\nUnited States v. Georgia, did not call “into question” the district\n\ncourt’s previous dismissal of (1) Spencer’s claims for injunctive\n\nrelief; (2) his Title II claims against named defendants in their\n\nindividual capacities; (3) Spencer’s Rehabilitation Act claims; or\n\n(4) his § 1983 claims, which were previously dismissed for failure\n\nto allege a constitutional violation. Spencer v. Earley, No. 1:01-\n\ncv-01578, *5-6 (E.D. Va. Jan. 30, 2007). With respect to Spencer’s\n\nRehabilitation Act claims, the district court elaborated further\n\n\n\n     1\n      While the district court’s ruling was pending, the United\nStates intervened as an appellant, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403, to\ndefend the constitutionality of Title II of the ADA, as applied in\nthe prison context, and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n                                8\n\fand reiterated its view that Spencer failed to present evidentiary\n\nsupport for his allegations. See id. at *5.\n\n     Turning   to   Spencer’s   Title   II   claims   against   the   state\n\nentities and actors in their official capacities, the district\n\ncourt applied the framework mandated by the Supreme Court in\n\nGeorgia.   In doing so, it first concluded that Spencer had stated\n\ntwelve valid Title II claims.2    The court then found, however, that\n\n\n     2\n      Briefly stated, Spencer’s valid Title II disability\ndiscrimination claims consisted of the following:\nB. Defendants denied Spencer’s reasonable request to use books to\ncomplete the required Breaking Barriers program in his cell because\nhis disabilities prevented him from attending the classroom\nsessions;\nD. Defendants denied Spencer’s reasonable request to have meetings\nwith his psychologist recorded for future use because his\ndisabilities prevented him from taking notes;\nF. Spencer was denied “single-cell housing and medical services\naccommodations,” as necessitated by his disabilities, and the\nwarden denied his reasonable request pertaining to access to the\ngeneral population mess hall;\nH. Defendants required Spencer to “perform feats, which by reason\nof his disabilities placed him at substantial risk of irreparable\nphysical injury” by requiring him to stand in an outdoor medication\ndispensing line on thirty occasions;\nK. Defendants locked Spencer in his building during a fire drill,\ndespite knowledge of his disabilities, and threatened him with\ndisciplinary action for delaying and interfering with the drill;\nM. Spencer was “denied authorization to display placards used to\nmotivate and remind him to attend to his personal hygiene”;\nN. He was denied access to the law library and refused assistance\nwith obtaining books, instead being insulted for his disabilities;\nO.   He   was  inappropriately   refused   him   the  single   cell\naccommodations required by his physical and mental disabilities;\nP. He was housed in the residential building farthest from all\ninmate services making it very difficult and painful for him to\nobtain such services;\nS. Spencer was thrown in administrative segregation under false\npretenses because a certain officer “did not want a disabled\nindividual with Spencer’s disabilities in his building”;\nW. Defendants denied Spencer’s request to be placed in single-\n\n                                   9\n\fnone       of    the   twelve   claims   alleged   an     actual   constitutional\n\nviolation, and Title II does not “validly abrogate[] [Eleventh\n\nAmendment] state sovereign immunity in the prison context for\n\n[Title II] claims not based on unconstitutional conduct.”                    Spencer\n\nv.   Earley,        No.   1:01-cv-01578,    *16   (E.D.   Va.   Jan.   30,   2007).\n\nAccordingly, the court dismissed Spencer’s remaining Title II\n\nclaims, and this appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                           II.\n\n       We now consider the dismissal of Spencer’s claims under § 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act.           We review the granting of a motion to\n\ndismiss de novo.          See Veney v. Wyche, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778015\"><a href=\"/opinion/778015/daniel-l-veney-v-t-v-wyche-darnley-r-hodge-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 730 (4th Cir.\n\n2002).3         The district court summarily dismissed these claims on the\n\n\n\noccupancy housing and the inmate honor housing program, which\nprovides single-occupancy housing to some non-disabled inmates;\nX. Defendants penalized Spencer for his inability to complete the\nBreaking Barriers program despite their refusal to make reasonable\naccommodations to allow Spencer to participate in the program.\nJ.A. 21-28, 41-51, 83-85.\n       3\n      Although Virginia argues vigorously on appeal that even if\nSpencer has stated valid claims under § 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct they are nevertheless barred by state sovereign immunity, its\ncontentions in this regard are foreclosed by circuit precedent.\nThis court has previously held that state agencies that knowingly\nand willingly accept clearly conditioned federal funding validly\nwaive their Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to claims for\ndamages under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

See id.\n\n                                           10\n\fgrounds that Spencer failed to present arguments in support of\n\nthem.4       Both Appellants, Spencer and the United States, respond\n\nthat       “[b]ecause    Title      II   of     the    ADA   and   [§    504    of]    the\n\nRehabilitation Act provide for identical causes of action, all of\n\n. . .

The Supreme Court\n\nhas recently emphasized that the purpose of this rule is to provide\n\nthe defendant with “fair notice of what . . . the claim is and the\n\ngrounds upon which it rests.”              Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Thus, while a complaint comprised solely of labels and\n\nconclusions is insufficient to satisfy this rule, specific facts,\n\nelaborate      arguments,      or    fanciful       language   are      not   necessary.\n\nErickson v.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n                                               11\n\f       More specifically, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that\n\nin the context of a motion to dismiss, a district court must\n\nconstrue a pro se complaint liberally.                 Such a complaint, “however\n\ninartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than\n\nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.”                   Id. (internal quotations\n\nomitted).     Dismissal of a pro se complaint such as Spencer’s for\n\nfailure to state a valid claim is therefore only appropriate when,\n\nafter applying this liberal construction, it appears “beyond doubt\n\nthat the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his\n\nclaim which would entitle him to relief.”                  Haines v.

Spencer plainly provides the defendants with\n\nnotice of his claims and the grounds therefor.                      It could scarcely\n\nbe     clearer      that      he     is     alleging     overlapping       disability\n\ndiscrimination claims under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and\n\nTitle II of the ADA, and he sets forth in some detail the alleged\n\nconduct    giving      rise    to    such   claims.      For   example,     Spencer’s\n\noriginal complaint is entitled, “Complaint Under Title II of the\n\nAmericans With Disabilities Act/§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of\n\n1973,”    J.A.   18,    and     he   refers      throughout    to    the   defendants’\n\nviolations of his rights under the “RA,” or Rehabilitation Act.\n\nSee, e.g., J.A. 21, 46.              Perhaps the strongest refutation of the\n\n\n                                            12\n\fdistrict court’s conclusion can be found in Claim B of Spencer’s\n\ncomplaint, in which he states the following:\n\n     B. (1). Spencer’s March 2001 “Institutional Treatment\n     Plan” at [Brunswick Correctional Center] indicated that\n     he needed to complete a so-called “Breaking Barriers”\n     program.   Due to Spencer’s Disabilities, i.e., memory\n     deficit disorder, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety [and]\n     panic disorder, (others omitted) he is unable to attend\n     a classroom setting, Spencer submitted a request . . .\n     for “reasonable accommodation” under the ADA and RA\n     ([Rehabilitation Act]) to borrow the programs books and\n     study them in his cell or a private room, in April 2001.\n     On 4-13-01 by written response to Spencer’s ADA/RA\n     reasonable accommodations request to participate in said\n     program, [the Assistant Warden of Programs] illegally\n     discriminates against Spencer and illegally excludes him\n     from said program by reason of his disabilities, by\n     denying him access/accommodation to participate in the\n     program.\n\n\nJ.A. 21 (emphasis added); see § 504 of Rehabilitation Act, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 794(a), (prohibiting exclusion from programs “solely by\n\nreason” of one’s disabilities).       After setting forth evidence\n\nsupporting the allegation that he was excluded from the program\n\n“solely by reason” of his disability, Spencer concludes Claim B by\n\nasserting that he was injured as a result of such exclusion and\n\nseeking damages and relief of any “type as may be found to be\n\nmerited after trial.”   J.A. 21-22.   Further, in the amendments to\n\nhis complaint, Spencer, again, specifically alleges that defendants\n\nviolated his rights “under the Rehabilitation Act,” and repeatedly\n\ncites § 504.   J.A. 45-47.   Thus, we reject the district court’s\n\n\n\n\n                                13\n\fcontention that Spencer made “no arguments” under § 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act.5\n\n     Spencer’s complaint, with respect to the twelve claims at\n\nissue, also contained “enough facts to state a claim to relief\n\n[under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act] that is plausible on its\n\nface.”   Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1974.    Our conclusion in this regard\n\nis reinforced by the district court’s finding that those claims\n\nsuccessfully alleged violations of Title II of the ADA.     Both § 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA were enacted, in\n\npart, to prohibit public entities from subjecting any person to\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability.     See Baird v. Rose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766248\"><a href=\"/opinion/766248/kristen-elisabeth-baird-a-minor-by-her-next-friend-and-parent-nancy-baird/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 469 (4th Cir. 1999).          Title II provides that “no\n\nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n\ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the\n\nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public\n\nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”         42\n\nU.S.C. § 12132.      Similarly, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\nprovides   that   “[n]o   otherwise    qualified   individual   with   a\n\ndisability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability,\n\nbe excluded from the participation in, or be denied the benefits\n\n\n\n     5\n      Curiously, after concluding that “Spencer presented no\narguments” under the Rehabilitation Act, the district court, in the\nsame opinion, notes several times that Spencer “allege[s] that\ndefendants’ conduct violated . . . § 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct.” Spencer v. Earley, No. 1:01-cv-01578, *5, 7, 12 (E.D. Va.\nJan. 30, 2007) (memorandum opinion).\n\n                                  14\n\fof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\n\nreceiving Federal financial assistance.”        29 U.S.C. § 794(a).\n\n     This   court   has   repeatedly     held   that   “[t]he      ADA    and\n\nRehabilitation Act generally are construed to impose the same\n\nrequirements,”   and   “[b]ecause    the   language    of   the    Acts    is\n\nsubstantially the same, we apply the same analysis to both.”\n\nBaird, 192 F.3d at 468 (quoting Doe, 50 F.3d at 1264 n. 9).              Thus,\n\nalthough the two statutes have minor differences, in general, a\n\nplaintiff seeking recovery under “either statute” must allege that\n\n(1) he has a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to receive\n\nthe benefits of a public service, program, or activity; and (3) he\n\nwas “excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of such\n\nservice, program, or activity, or otherwise discriminated against,\n\non the basis of h[is] disability.”       Constantine, 411 F.3d at 498.\n\n     While Spencer may not mention § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\nin each of his successfully pleaded Title II claims, he initially\n\nstates that his claims are brought under both statutes and none of\n\nthe Acts’ established differences are implicated.6                Thus, the\n\n\n     6\n      “Despite the overall similarity of . . . Title II of the ADA\nand § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the language of these two\nstatutory provisions regarding the causative link between\ndiscrimination and adverse action is significantly dissimilar.”\nBaird, 192 F.3d at 469. However, the failure to show causation was\nnot the basis of the district court’s dismissal of Spencer’s\nRehabilitation Act claims.    Spencer’s complaint plainly alleges\nboth that he was discriminated against “solely by reason” of his\ndisability, as required by the Rehabilitation Act, and that he was\n“otherwise qualified” for the program or protection at issue, as\nrequired by Title II. We do not hold here that every successfully\n\n                                    15\n\fdistrict court’s finding that Spencer successfully pleaded twelve\n\nclaims under Title II should have foreclosed the blanket dismissal\n\nof the same twelve claims brought pursuant to § 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act.\n\n                                            B.\n\n     Nonetheless, Virginia contends that the law of the case\n\ndoctrine precludes our review of the district court’s decision\n\nregarding Spencer’s Rehabilitation Act claims.                       It asserts that\n\n“[b]ecause     Spencer     did   not   seek        Supreme   Court    review   of   the\n\ndismissal of the § 504 [of the Rehabilitation Act] claims, these\n\nclaims   are    not    implicated      in    the     Supreme   Court’s    subsequent\n\ndecision to grant certiorari, vacate, and remand [this case] to\n\nthis [c]ourt.”        Appellee’s Br. at 37.

Earley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"140572\"><a href=\"/opinion/140572/spencer-v-earley/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004).\n\nThis court, in turn, vacated and remanded the district court’s\n\ndecision.    See Spencer v. Earley, No. 037037 (4th Cir. Jan. 20,\n\n2005).   Given this procedural history, we are hard-pressed to find\n\nany remaining, decided “law of the case” from this court’s earlier\n\nopinion.7   Cf. Johnson v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110732\"><a href=\"/opinion/110732/johnson-v-board-of-ed-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53-54 (1982) (“Because we have vacated the Court of Appeals’\n\njudgments in this case, the doctrine of the law of the case does\n\nnot constrain either the District Court or, should an appeal\n\nsubsequently be taken, the Court of Appeals.”); Adams v. Aiken, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683168\"><a href=\"/opinion/683168/sylvester-lewis-adams-v-james-aiken-warden-central-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179 (4th Cir. 1994) (“Inasmuch as the Supreme Court\n\nvacated our judgment, we are not precluded from reconsidering\n\n[another issue not affected by the Supreme Court’s mandate] in the\n\nlight of the Court's most recent opinion.”).\n\n\n\n     7\n      The district court appears to have been operating under the\nsame assumption. Rather than concluding that it was precluded by\nthe law of the case doctrine from considering Spencer’s\nRehabilitation Act claims, as Virginia contends, the district court\nmerely concluded that its previous ruling on this subject had not\nbeen “call[ed] . . . into question,” and then proceeded to make\nfindings and, again, issue a ruling on the subject. See Spencer v.\nEarley, No. 1:01-cv-01578, *5-6 (E.D. Va. Jan. 30, 2007)\n(memorandum opinion).\n\n\n                                   17\n\f     Assuming for argument’s sake, however, that the law of the\n\ncase doctrine does apply here, it still does not “limit th[is]\n\ncourt’s power” to review the dismissal of Spencer’s Rehabilitation\n\nAct claims.     Castro v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131151\"><a href=\"/opinion/131151/castro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384 (2003)\n\n(internal quotations omitted). It is well established that the law\n\nof the case doctrine “merely expresses the practice of courts\n\ngenerally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, [and is] not\n\na limit to their power.”    Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating\n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112104\"><a href=\"/opinion/112104/christianson-v-colt-industries-operating-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 817 (1988) (internal citations and quotations\n\nomitted).     “A court [therefore] has the power to revisit prior\n\ndecisions of its own or of a coordinate court in any circumstance,”\n\nand should readily do so where, as here, “the initial decision was\n\nclearly erroneous.”    Id. (emphasis added and internal quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n     Thus, we reverse the district court’s decision as to Spencer’s\n\nRehabilitation Act claims and remand with instructions to the\n\ndistrict court to reinstate the twelve claims found to properly\n\nallege violations of Title II of the ADA.8    As previously noted,\n\nSpencer has abandoned his appeal of the district court’s dismissal\n\nof his claims under Title II of the ADA.   We therefore decline to\n\nanswer the constitutional questions implicated in those claims, and\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      We refer here to the claims designated by both Spencer and\nthe district court as claims B, D, F, H, K, M, N, O, P, S, W, and\nX.\n\n                                 18\n\finstead affirm that portion of the district court’s judgment on\n\nabandonment grounds.\n\n\n\n                              III.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court\n\nis\n\n                              AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART,\n                                  AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n\n\n\n\n                               19\n\f</pre>",
