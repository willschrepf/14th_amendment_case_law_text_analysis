His presumptive parole date is March 29, 1997. Almahdi sued the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), and\n\nofficials associated with both institutions and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He\n\nclaimed that his constitutional rights were violated when DHS arbitrarily placed his name\n\non a watch list, and when officials at FCI-Allenwood placed him in administrative\n\ndetention at times of elevated national security because his name was on the list.\n\nSpecifically, he alleged that he was placed in segregation for over two months in late\n\n2001, for nearly a month in early 2003, and for another six weeks in mid-2003. Second\n\nAmended Complaint, 5-6. He asked the District Court for an award of money damages\n\nagainst all Defendants, and he specifically asked that DHS be ordered to remove his name\n\nfrom the watch list. See id. at 12-13. In his complaint, Almahdi also stated that,\n\napparently as a result of the prison’s security concerns about him, his telephone privileges\n\nwere reduced to once a month. Id. at 8.\n\n       Defendants immediately moved for summary judgment, arguing primarily that\n\nAlmahdi had not administratively exhausted his claim about the watch list with prison\n\nofficials. See Summary Judgment Brief, 2 n.2 (noting that they would file another motion\n\nto address the merits if the exhaustion defense were unsuccessful), 7-12. As to Almahdi’s\n\nclaim about his reduced telephone privileges, Defendants argued that prisoners have no\n\nconstitutional right to use a telephone.\n\n       The District Court dismissed Almahdi’s claim about the watch list for failure to\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fexhaust his administrative remedies. It held that Almahdi had waived most of the claim\n\nconcerning phone privileges, and it denied the remainder of that claim on the merits.\n\nAlmahdi appeals.\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We exercise plenary review\n\nover the District Court’s order granting summary judgment. See Podobnick v. U.S. Postal\n\nService, 409 F.3d 584, 589 (3d Cir. 2005). We will affirm in part and vacate in part.\n\n       We previously dismissed Almahdi’s appeal insofar as it relates to his claim that\n\nprison officials improperly placed him in special housing at times of high national\n\nsecurity. See Almahdi v. Sec’y of Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 04-3120 (order entered\n\nJanuary 18, 2006). As we explained then, we agree with the District Court that Almahdi\n\ndid not exhaust that claim. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\n\n       We do not agree, however, with the District Court’s implicit determination that\n\nAlmahdi was obligated to exhaust his claim insofar as he alleged that his constitutional\n\nrights were violated when DHS improperly placed his name on a watch list.\n\nSection 1997e(a) requires exhaustion of claims concerning “prison conditions,” and\n\ncourts have taken a broad view of that term. See, e.g., Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516,\n\n532 (2002) (holding that the exhaustion requirement of § 1997e(a) “applies to all inmate\n\nsuits about prison life”). To interpret the phrase, we have considered its definition in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3626(g)(2), another section of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”).\n\nSee Booth v. Churner, 206 F.3d 289, 294 (3d Cir. 2000), aff’d 532 U.S. 731 (2001).\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f       In pertinent part, § 3626 defines the term “civil action with respect to prison\n\nconditions” as “any civil proceeding arising under Federal law with respect to the\n\nconditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of\n\npersons confined in prison.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(2). We have concluded that complaints\n\nabout “conditions of confinement” include “complaints such as those regarding cell\n\novercrowding, poor prison construction, inadequate medical facilities, and incomplete law\n\nlibraries.” Booth, 206 F.3d at 295. More generally, we have explained that “actions\n\narising under this clause relate to the environment in which prisoners live, the physical\n\nconditions of that environment, and the nature of the services provided therein.” Id. We\n\nhave read the phrase referring to civil actions about “the effects of actions by government\n\nofficials on the lives of persons confined in prison” to mean complaints “ranging from\n\nexcessive force actions . . . to actions ‘with respect to’ a prison official’s decision not to\n\nmake basic repairs in the prison, or intentionally to deny a prisoner food, heating, or\n\nmedical attention.” Id.\n\n       Almahdi’s claim that DHS improperly placed his name on a national watch list is\n\ncertainly not a claim about a condition of his confinement. And his claim is not a civil\n\naction about the effect of actions by governments officials on the lives of persons\n\nconfined in prison, either. As we concluded previously and iterated above, to the extent\n\nthat Almahdi complains about the effects of the addition of his name to the watch list by\n\nDHS on his experience in prison (including his relegation to segregation or the\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fdeprivation of his telephone privileges), Almahdi must exhaust his claims through the\n\nproper administrative channels. However, his separate and more fundamental claim that\n\nDHS improperly placed his name on a national watch list, a designation that affects him\n\ntemporally and figuratively beyond his term of imprisonment, need not be exhausted\n\nadministratively. Cf. Treesh v. Taft, 122 F. Supp. 2d 887, 891 (S.D. Ohio 2000) (holding\n\nthat prisoners were not obligated to exhaust their claims because they challenged actions\n\nwhose effect came after their term of imprisonment had ended). Furthermore, although\n\nlike the examples cited in Booth, the inclusion of Almahdi’s name on the watch list\n\n“makes [his] life worse,” unlike the examples in Booth, the action is not one taken by\n\nprison officials. 206 F.3d at 295. The placement of Almahdi’s name on watch list\n\noccurred outside the prison gates. Accordingly, Almahdi is not obligated to exhaust his\n\nclaim through the prison grievance process.1\n\n\n\n   1\n    We note that requiring Almahdi to seek relief in the prison grievance system would\nnot advance the general policies of the doctrine of administrative exhaustion or the more\nspecific policy underlying the PLRA exhaustion requirement. To wit, it would not allow\nthe prison to “‘correct its own mistakes with respect to the programs it administers,’” or\n“promote efficiency” through settlement at the administrative level. Woodford v. Ngo,\n126 S. Ct. 2378, 2384-85 (2006). It also would not further the goal of reducing\n“unwarranted federal-court interference with the administration of prisons” by affording\n“corrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints internally before\nallowing the initiation of a federal case.” Id. The policies are not forwarded because\nAlmahdi claims that another agency, not the prison, made a mistake when it placed his\nname on a watch list. Therefore, any mistake could not have been corrected by the prison\nalone and any judicial correction would not interfere with the administration of the prison.\nWhile we acknowledge Appellees’ argument that the BOP may be able to help an inmate\npursue a claim like Almahdi’s because of interagency data-sharing, see Appellees’ brief at\n28, n.13, there is no evidence that this is a task that the BOP ordinarily undertakes. Also,\n\n                                               5\n\f       In entering judgment in favor of Defendants for Almahdi’s failure to exhaust, the\n\nDistrict Court conflated Almahdi’s claim based on DHS’s alleged error in adding his\n\nname to a watch list with his claim based on prison officials’ actions taken in response to\n\nhis name on the watch list. While we separate the claims, we will affirm the District\n\nCourt’s judgment in favor of Defendants because Almahdi failed to state a claim upon\n\nwhich relief can be granted. See Erie Telecomms. v. Erie, 853 F.2d 1084, 1089 (3d Cir.\n\n1988) (holding that an appellate court may affirm on an alternative basis supported by the\n\nrecord).\n\n       Under the circumstances of this case, the listing of Almahdi’s name on a watch list\n\nviolated no constitutional right. Without more, the imposition of a stigma or an injury to\n\none’s reputation is not sufficient to state a claim for a due process violation. See Paul v.\n\nDavis, 424 U.S. 693, 709, 712 (1976); Robb v. City of Philadelphia, 733 F.2d 286, 294 (3d\n\nCir. 1984). A plaintiff must allege a stigma plus a deprivation of a liberty or property\n\ninterest protected by the Due Process Clause. See Paul, 424 U.S. at 712. Almahdi\n\nalleged his constitutional rights were violated when his name was arbitrarily placed on a\n\nwatch list by DHS, causing officials at FCI-Allenwood to place him in administrative\n\ndetention and downgrade his telephone privileges whenever the nation’s security level\n\nwas heightened. Even assuming that Almahdi suffers a stigma because his name is on the\n\n\n\n\nwe agree with Almahdi that an agency outside the prison is the ultimate decision-maker,\nsee Appellant’s brief at 4.\n\n                                              6\n\fwatch list, he does not state a claim because he does not suffer a concomitant deprivation\n\nof a liberty or property right.\n\n       Almahdi’s three transfers to segregated confinement and the limitations imposed\n\non his use of the telephone did not violate his due process rights. Almahdi has no\n\nprotected liberty interest in retaining his custody status. See Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S.\n\n215, 224 (1996). State-created interests are generally limited to freedom from restraint\n\nthat imposes “atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\n\nincidents of prison life.” Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995). Transfers,\n\nresulting in approximately six months of segregated confinement, or limitations on\n\ntelephone privileges, are not examples of such atypical or significant hardship. See Smith\n\nv. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 654 (3d Cir. 2002) (holding that seven months’ disciplinary\n\nconfinement “does not, on its own, violate a protected liberty interest as defined in\n\nSandin”); Fraise v. Terhune, 283 F.3d 506, 522-23 (3d Cir. 2002); Griffin v. Vaughn, 112\n\nF.3d 703. 706 (3d Cir. 1997). Furthermore, although Almahdi appears to contend that\n\nprison officials may not have abided by all pertinent regulations in changing his custody\n\nstatus and limiting his telephone usage, he has no independent liberty interest in the\n\nprison procedures themselves. See Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 250-51 (1983).\n\n       In addition to the claims described above, Almahdi presented an independent and\n\nfully exhausted claim based on the reduction of his telephone privileges. The District\n\nCourt read Almahdi’s opposition to the Government’s motion for summary judgment as\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fnarrowing his claim about his reduced telephone privileges to a claim concerning only\n\nwhether Almahdi was entitled to written (not oral) notice of the reduced privileges. See\n\nDistrict Court Memorandum, 10. We do not read Almahdi’s response to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment as so dramatically narrowing his claim, however. To be sure,\n\nAlmahdi did mention the notice he received of the reduced privileges, see Summary\n\nJudgment Opposition, 10, but he did so only in the context of arguing that the reduction in\n\nphone privileges was entirely irregular and unconstitutional. See id. at 4-11. On appeal,\n\nAlmahdi continues to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated by the\n\nrestriction on his phone usage. See Appellant’s brief, 8-11. Because the District Court\n\nmisconstrued Almahdi’s claim, and because the current record presents no alternative\n\nbasis to affirm, we will vacate the judgment in favor of Defendants on this claim. On\n\nremand, the District Court may wish to evaluate Almahdi’s claim under the First\n\nAmendment.2\n\n\n\n   2\n    The First Amendment doctrine relevant to Almahdi’s claim has been summarized\nelsewhere as follows:\n\n       The Supreme Court has recognized that ‘prison walls do not form a barrier\n       separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution,’ Turner\n       v. Safley, 482 U.S. [78] at 84 [(1987)] . . ., nor do they bar free citizens from\n       exercising their own constitutional rights by reaching out to those on the\n       ‘inside,’ id., at 94-99 . . .” Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 407, 104\n       L. Ed. 2d 459, 109 S. Ct. 1874 (1989). In fact, federal court opinions have\n       previously held that persons incarcerated in penal institutions retain their\n       First Amendment rights to communicate with family and friends, Morgan v.\n       LaVallee, 526 F.2d 221, 225 (2d Cir. 1975), and have recognized that “there\n       is no legitimate governmental purpose to be attained by not allowing\n\n                                              8\n\f       In sum, the District Court’s judgment will be affirmed in part and vacated in part.\n\nWe remand this matter to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n       reasonable access to the telephone, and . . . such use is protected by the\n       First Amendment.” Johnson v. Galli, 596 F. Supp. 135, 138 (D. Nev. 1984).\n\n       Nevertheless, an inmate “has no right to unlimited telephone use.” Benzel v.\n       Grammar, 869 F.2d 1105, 1108 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 895, 107\n       L. Ed. 2d 194, 110 S. Ct. 244 (1989), citing Lopez v. Reyes, 692 F.2d 15, 17\n       (5th Cir. 1982). Instead, a prisoner's right to telephone access is “subject to\n       rational limitations in the face of legitimate security interests of the penal\n       institution.” Strandberg v. City of Helena, 791 F.2d 744, 747 (9th Cir. 1986).\n       “The exact nature of telephone service to be provided to inmates is generally\n       to be determined by prison administrators, subject to court scrutiny for\n       unreasonable restrictions.” Fillmore v. Ordonez, 829 F. Supp. 1544, 1563-64\n       (D. Kan. 1993), aff'd, 17 F.3d 1436 (10th Cir. 1994), and citing Feeley v.\n       Sampson, 570 F.2d 364, 374 (1st Cir. 1978), and Jeffries v. Reed, 631 F.\n       Supp. 1212, 1219 (E.D. Wash. 1986).\n\nWashington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1100 (6th Cir. 1994). Under these standards,\nAlmahdi states a claim under the First Amendment. See also Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S.\n519, 520 (1972). However, it remains to be seen whether Almahdi will be entitled to\njudgment on his claim after further discovery. We note that in addition to claiming that\nprisoners have no constitutional right to telephone use, Defendants presented evidence in\nthe District Court that Defendant Malocu, an FBI agent, administered a polygraph\nexamination in which he asked Almahdi whether he had any involvement in, or prior\nknowledge of, the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks. See Summary Judgment Brief, Attachment\n#4, R.37. Malocu averred that Almahdi’s responses indicated deception. See id.\nAlmahdi disputed Malocu’s account, claiming that he was completely cleared of having\nany involvement or knowledge and that any deception related to a question about a\nhypothetical event.

His presumptive parole date is March 29, 1997. Almahdi sued the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), and\n\nofficials associated with both institutions and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He\n\nclaimed that his constitutional rights were violated when DHS arbitrarily placed his name\n\non a watch list, and when officials at FCI-Allenwood placed him in administrative\n\ndetention at times of elevated national security because his name was on the list.\n\nSpecifically, he alleged that he was placed in segregation for over two months in late\n\n2001, for nearly a month in early 2003, and for another six weeks in mid-2003. Second\n\nAmended Complaint, 5-6. He asked the District Court for an award of money damages\n\nagainst all Defendants, and he specifically asked that DHS be ordered to remove his name\n\nfrom the watch list. See id. at 12-13. In his complaint, Almahdi also stated that,\n\napparently as a result of the prison’s security concerns about him, his telephone privileges\n\nwere reduced to once a month. Id. at 8.\n\n       Defendants immediately moved for summary judgment, arguing primarily that\n\nAlmahdi had not administratively exhausted his claim about the watch list with prison\n\nofficials. See Summary Judgment Brief, 2 n.2 (noting that they would file another motion\n\nto address the merits if the exhaustion defense were unsuccessful), 7-12. As to Almahdi’s\n\nclaim about his reduced telephone privileges, Defendants argued that prisoners have no\n\nconstitutional right to use a telephone.\n\n       The District Court dismissed Almahdi’s claim about the watch list for failure to\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fexhaust his administrative remedies. It held that Almahdi had waived most of the claim\n\nconcerning phone privileges, and it denied the remainder of that claim on the merits.\n\nAlmahdi appeals.\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We exercise plenary review\n\nover the District Court’s order granting summary judgment. See Podobnick v. U.S. Postal\n\nService, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790411\"><a href=\"/opinion/790411/philip-j-podobnik-v-united-states-postal-service-national-rural-letter/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 589 (3d Cir. 2005). We will affirm in part and vacate in part.\n\n       We previously dismissed Almahdi’s appeal insofar as it relates to his claim that\n\nprison officials improperly placed him in special housing at times of high national\n\nsecurity. See Almahdi v. Sec’y of Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 04-3120 (order entered\n\nJanuary 18, 2006). As we explained then, we agree with the District Court that Almahdi\n\ndid not exhaust that claim. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\n\n       We do not agree, however, with the District Court’s implicit determination that\n\nAlmahdi was obligated to exhaust his claim insofar as he alleged that his constitutional\n\nrights were violated when DHS improperly placed his name on a watch list.\n\nSection 1997e(a) requires exhaustion of claims concerning “prison conditions,” and\n\ncourts have taken a broad view of that term. See, e.g., Porter v. Nussle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118483\"><a href=\"/opinion/118483/porter-v-nussle/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n532 (2002) (holding that the exhaustion requirement of § 1997e(a) “applies to all inmate\n\nsuits about prison life”). To interpret the phrase, we have considered its definition in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3626(g)(2), another section of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”).\n\nSee Booth v. Churner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767968\"><a href=\"/opinion/767968/timothy-booth-v-churner-co-workensher-sgt-rikus-lt-w-gardner-capt/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 294 (3d Cir. 2000), aff’d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118434\"><a href=\"/opinion/118434/booth-v-churner/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001).\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f       In pertinent part, § 3626 defines the term “civil action with respect to prison\n\nconditions” as “any civil proceeding arising under Federal law with respect to the\n\nconditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of\n\npersons confined in prison.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(2). We have concluded that complaints\n\nabout “conditions of confinement” include “complaints such as those regarding cell\n\novercrowding, poor prison construction, inadequate medical facilities, and incomplete law\n\nlibraries.” Booth, 206 F.3d at 295. More generally, we have explained that “actions\n\narising under this clause relate to the environment in which prisoners live, the physical\n\nconditions of that environment, and the nature of the services provided therein.” Id. We\n\nhave read the phrase referring to civil actions about “the effects of actions by government\n\nofficials on the lives of persons confined in prison” to mean complaints “ranging from\n\nexcessive force actions . . . to actions ‘with respect to’ a prison official’s decision not to\n\nmake basic repairs in the prison, or intentionally to deny a prisoner food, heating, or\n\nmedical attention.” Id.\n\n       Almahdi’s claim that DHS improperly placed his name on a national watch list is\n\ncertainly not a claim about a condition of his confinement. And his claim is not a civil\n\naction about the effect of actions by governments officials on the lives of persons\n\nconfined in prison, either. As we concluded previously and iterated above, to the extent\n\nthat Almahdi complains about the effects of the addition of his name to the watch list by\n\nDHS on his experience in prison (including his relegation to segregation or the\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fdeprivation of his telephone privileges), Almahdi must exhaust his claims through the\n\nproper administrative channels. However, his separate and more fundamental claim that\n\nDHS improperly placed his name on a national watch list, a designation that affects him\n\ntemporally and figuratively beyond his term of imprisonment, need not be exhausted\n\nadministratively. Cf. Treesh v. Taft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2580453\"><a href=\"/opinion/2580453/treesh-v-taft/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">887</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 891 (S.D. Ohio 2000) (holding\n\nthat prisoners were not obligated to exhaust their claims because they challenged actions\n\nwhose effect came after their term of imprisonment had ended). Furthermore, although\n\nlike the examples cited in Booth, the inclusion of Almahdi’s name on the watch list\n\n“makes [his] life worse,” unlike the examples in Booth, the action is not one taken by\n\nprison officials. 206 F.3d at 295. The placement of Almahdi’s name on watch list\n\noccurred outside the prison gates. Accordingly, Almahdi is not obligated to exhaust his\n\nclaim through the prison grievance process.1\n\n\n\n   1\n    We note that requiring Almahdi to seek relief in the prison grievance system would\nnot advance the general policies of the doctrine of administrative exhaustion or the more\nspecific policy underlying the PLRA exhaustion requirement. To wit, it would not allow\nthe prison to “‘correct its own mistakes with respect to the programs it administers,’” or\n“promote efficiency” through settlement at the administrative level. Woodford v. Ngo,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145635\"><a href=\"/opinion/145635/woodford-v-ngo/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2384-85 (2006). It also would not further the goal of reducing\n“unwarranted federal-court interference with the administration of prisons” by affording\n“corrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints internally before\nallowing the initiation of a federal case.” Id. The policies are not forwarded because\nAlmahdi claims that another agency, not the prison, made a mistake when it placed his\nname on a watch list. Therefore, any mistake could not have been corrected by the prison\nalone and any judicial correction would not interfere with the administration of the prison.\nWhile we acknowledge Appellees’ argument that the BOP may be able to help an inmate\npursue a claim like Almahdi’s because of interagency data-sharing, see Appellees’ brief at\n28, n.13, there is no evidence that this is a task that the BOP ordinarily undertakes. Also,\n\n                                               5\n\f       In entering judgment in favor of Defendants for Almahdi’s failure to exhaust, the\n\nDistrict Court conflated Almahdi’s claim based on DHS’s alleged error in adding his\n\nname to a watch list with his claim based on prison officials’ actions taken in response to\n\nhis name on the watch list. While we separate the claims, we will affirm the District\n\nCourt’s judgment in favor of Defendants because Almahdi failed to state a claim upon\n\nwhich relief can be granted. See Erie Telecomms. v. Erie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510039\"><a href=\"/opinion/510039/erie-telecommunications-inc-v-city-of-erie-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1089 (3d Cir.\n\n1988) (holding that an appellate court may affirm on an alternative basis supported by the\n\nrecord).\n\n       Under the circumstances of this case, the listing of Almahdi’s name on a watch list\n\nviolated no constitutional right. Without more, the imposition of a stigma or an injury to\n\none’s reputation is not sufficient to state a claim for a due process violation. See Paul v.\n\nDavis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 709, 712 (1976); Robb v.

A plaintiff must allege a stigma plus a deprivation of a liberty or property\n\ninterest protected by the Due Process Clause. See Paul, 424 U.S. at 712. Almahdi\n\nalleged his constitutional rights were violated when his name was arbitrarily placed on a\n\nwatch list by DHS, causing officials at FCI-Allenwood to place him in administrative\n\ndetention and downgrade his telephone privileges whenever the nation’s security level\n\nwas heightened. Even assuming that Almahdi suffers a stigma because his name is on the\n\n\n\n\nwe agree with Almahdi that an agency outside the prison is the ultimate decision-maker,\nsee Appellant’s brief at 4.\n\n                                              6\n\fwatch list, he does not state a claim because he does not suffer a concomitant deprivation\n\nof a liberty or property right.\n\n       Almahdi’s three transfers to segregated confinement and the limitations imposed\n\non his use of the telephone did not violate his due process rights. Almahdi has no\n\nprotected liberty interest in retaining his custody status. See Meachum v. Fano, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">215</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224 (1996). State-created interests are generally limited to freedom from restraint\n\nthat imposes “atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\n\nincidents of prison life.” Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (1995). Transfers,\n\nresulting in approximately six months of segregated confinement, or limitations on\n\ntelephone privileges, are not examples of such atypical or significant hardship. See Smith\n\nv.

Furthermore, although Almahdi appears to contend that\n\nprison officials may not have abided by all pertinent regulations in changing his custody\n\nstatus and limiting his telephone usage, he has no independent liberty interest in the\n\nprison procedures themselves. See Olim v. Wakinekona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110921\"><a href=\"/opinion/110921/olim-v-wakinekona/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 250-51 (1983).\n\n       In addition to the claims described above, Almahdi presented an independent and\n\nfully exhausted claim based on the reduction of his telephone privileges. The District\n\nCourt read Almahdi’s opposition to the Government’s motion for summary judgment as\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fnarrowing his claim about his reduced telephone privileges to a claim concerning only\n\nwhether Almahdi was entitled to written (not oral) notice of the reduced privileges. See\n\nDistrict Court Memorandum, 10. We do not read Almahdi’s response to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment as so dramatically narrowing his claim, however. To be sure,\n\nAlmahdi did mention the notice he received of the reduced privileges, see Summary\n\nJudgment Opposition, 10, but he did so only in the context of arguing that the reduction in\n\nphone privileges was entirely irregular and unconstitutional. See id. at 4-11. On appeal,\n\nAlmahdi continues to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated by the\n\nrestriction on his phone usage. See Appellant’s brief, 8-11. Because the District Court\n\nmisconstrued Almahdi’s claim, and because the current record presents no alternative\n\nbasis to affirm, we will vacate the judgment in favor of Defendants on this claim. On\n\nremand, the District Court may wish to evaluate Almahdi’s claim under the First\n\nAmendment.2\n\n\n\n   2\n    The First Amendment doctrine relevant to Almahdi’s claim has been summarized\nelsewhere as follows:\n\n       The Supreme Court has recognized that ‘prison walls do not form a barrier\n       separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution,’ Turner\n       v.

Kerner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108432\"><a href=\"/opinion/108432/haines-v-kerner/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 520 (1972). However, it remains to be seen whether Almahdi will be entitled to\njudgment on his claim after further discovery. We note that in addition to claiming that\nprisoners have no constitutional right to telephone use, Defendants presented evidence in\nthe District Court that Defendant Malocu, an FBI agent, administered a polygraph\nexamination in which he asked Almahdi whether he had any involvement in, or prior\nknowledge of, the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks. See Summary Judgment Brief, Attachment\n#4, R.37. Malocu averred that Almahdi’s responses indicated deception. See id.\nAlmahdi disputed Malocu’s account, claiming that he was completely cleared of having\nany involvement or knowledge and that any deception related to a question about a\nhypothetical event. See Summary Judgment Opposition, 4 & Declaration, 2, ¶¶ 7-8.\n\f</pre>",
