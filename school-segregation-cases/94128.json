Va. Code § 5-11-1 et seq. (“WVHRA”) is proper in the absence of the exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies available pursuant to the West Virginia Public Employees Grievance\n\nProcedure, W. Va. Code § 6C-2-1 et seq. (“Grievance Procedure”). In these combined cases,\n\nTheresa Weimer (“Ms. Weimer”) and Vicky Lou Hughes (“Ms. Hughes”) (collectively, “the\n\npetitioners”) appeal the respective circuit courts’ dismissals of their complaints. On appeal\n\nto this Court, the petitioners argue that the circuit courts erred in the determinations that the\n\nexhaustion of the Grievance Procedure was a necessary precondition to the filing of a circuit\n\ncourt action. Upon a review of the parties’ briefs,1 the appendix records designated for\n\nappellate consideration, the governing law, and the parties’ oral arguments, we reverse the\n\nrulings of the circuit courts and remand for further proceedings. Specifically, in Case\n\nNumber 12-0477 regarding Ms. Weimer, we reverse the March 12, 2012, “Order Granting\n\nMotion to Dismiss for Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies” entered by the Circuit\n\n\n\n              1\n                We acknowledge the contribution of the following amici curiae who filed\nbriefs in this case: Employment Lawyers Association; The West Virginia Human Rights\nCommission; West Virginia Advocates, Inc.; The West Virginia Conference of Branches of\nthe NAACP; WV Free; The Mountain State Bar Association; and American Civil Liberties\nUnion of West Virginia. All of the amici briefs were filed in Ms. Weimer’s appeal, Case\nNumber 12-0477, and posit that the dismissal of claims for failure to exhaust grievance\nprocedures should be reversed. We value the participation of the amici and will consider\ntheir briefs in conjunction with the parties’ arguments.\n\n                                               1\n\n\fCourt of Pocahontas County and remand the case for further consideration consistent with\n\nthis opinion. Additionally, in Case Number 12-1506 regarding Ms. Hughes, we reverse the\n\nCircuit Court of Monongalia County’s November 13, 2012, “Order Granting Defendants’\n\nMotion to Dismiss” and remand for additional judicial proceedings comporting with the\n\ndiscussion contained herein.\n\n\n\n                                              I.\n\n\n                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n              Because the errors assigned in each of the cases sub judice are substantially the\n\nsame, they have been consolidated for this Court’s consideration and decision. Resolution\n\nof these cases is based purely on the legal issues. However, a brief recitation of the\n\nindividual facts giving rise to each appeal is set forth below.\n\n\n\n                      A. Theresa L. Weimer, Case Number 12-0477\n\n              In 2006, Ms. Weimer began teaching at Pocahontas County High School\n\n(“PCHS”), a public school. During her teaching career at PCHS, she suffered from\n\ninsulin-dependent diabetes, lumbar degenerative disk disease, depression, degenerative joint\n\ndisease, fibromyalgia, plantar fasciitis, acute renal failure, hypertension, and sleep apnea.\n\nMs. Weimer’s medical problems were known to her supervisor, the school principal. Ms.\n\nWeimer asserts that the school principal harassed her, told her he needed “healthy teachers,”\n\n\n                                              2\n\n\fand failed to provide accommodations. She received a letter in 2009 from the principal\n\nregarding her alleged inability to teach. Further, she was suspended without pay on\n\nNovember 30, 2009; however, this suspension eventually was converted to family medical\n\nleave. Ms. Weimer returned to work in Fall 2010, and states that she expected work\n\naccommodations. In particular, she requested smaller class sizes and/or assistance from a\n\nteacher’s aide, which she asserts were refused by the principal.\n\n\n\n              In late 2011, Ms. Weimer tripped and fell in her classroom. Ms. Weimer\n\ncontends that the principal used this incident against her based on the perception that it\n\noccurred because of her disabilities. Shortly thereafter, it was recommended that Ms.\n\nWeimer’s employment be terminated: a pretermination hearing was conducted, which\n\nincluded evidence that Ms. Weimer had teaching deficiencies, including falling asleep while\n\nteaching and leaving students unattended. Based upon the recommendations of the school\n\nprincipal and the school superintendent, Ms. Weimer’s position as a public school teacher\n\nwas terminated by the Pocahontas County Board of Education on October 27, 2011.\n\n\n\n              Subsequent thereto, on November 30, 2011, Ms. Weimer filed a complaint in\n\nthe Circuit Court of Pocahontas County against Thomas Sanders, the Principal of PCHS;\n\nC.C. Lester, the Superintendent of the Pocahontas County Board of Education; and the\n\nPocahontas County Board of Education (collectively, “the Weimer respondents”). Ms.\n\n\n                                             3\n\n\fWeimer did not file a grievance with the West Virginia Public Employees Grievance Board\n\n(“Grievance Board”). See W. Va. Code § 6C-2-1 et seq. The circuit court complaint asserted\n\nviolations under the WVHRA: discriminatory discharge on the basis of actual or perceived\n\ndisability; hostile work environment on the basis of actual or perceived disability; and\n\ndisparate discipline on the basis of actual or perceived disability.\n\n\n\n              The Weimer respondents filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, in which they\n\nargued that Ms. Weimer’s complaint was flawed because she failed to exhaust her\n\nadministrative remedies with the Grievance Board. By order entered March 12, 2012, the\n\ncircuit court granted the motion to dismiss. The lower court reasoned that facts alleged in\n\nthe complaint point to “discrimination,” “harassment,” “favoritism,” and other matters that\n\nmay properly be addressed by the Grievance Procedure. Ultimately, the circuit court ruled\n\nthat Ms. Weimer first must exhaust her administrative remedies available through the\n\nGrievance Procedure prior to bringing a claim pursuant to the WVHRA before the circuit\n\ncourt. Ms. Weimer appealed to this Court, and her case was consolidated with Hughes v.\n\nWest Virginia University, Case Number 12-1506.\n\n\n\n                      B. Vicky Lou Hughes, Case Number 12-1506\n\n              Ms. Hughes began employment in December 2007 as a coordinator/clinical\n\nassociate for the Center for Excellence in Disabilities (“CED”), a branch of West Virginia\n\n\n                                              4\n\n\fUniversity (“WVU”). Her position provided Traumatic Brain Injury (“TBI”) services\n\nthroughout the state. During the interview process, Ms. Hughes advised the CED that she\n\nhas a disability known as multiple chemical sensitivity, which requires reasonable\n\naccommodation. Initially, the CED accommodated Ms. Hughes’s requests, permitting her\n\nto use her personal vehicle for work travel and allowing her to work from a different office\n\nlocation while her regular office location was undergoing renovation.\n\n\n\n              On April 6, 2010, a meeting was held wherein Ms. Hughes was informed that\n\nthere had been consumer complaints regarding her job performance. After an investigation,\n\na warning letter was issued June 11, 2010, stating that Ms. Hughes’s work quality was\n\nunsatisfactory. After the April 6, 2010, meeting, it was alleged that Ms. Hughes had engaged\n\nin additional inappropriate and potentially unethical clinical procedures and client\n\ninteractions. Ms. Hughes argued that these allegations were false and were made with the\n\npurpose and intent of harassing her in retribution for her requests for accommodation.\n\n\n\n              Ms. Hughes, in June 2010, suffered an orthopedic injury that resulted in a\n\nmedical leave of absence of approximately one year. When she attempted to return to work,\n\nshe was advised that several of her requests for accommodation had been rejected. On\n\nOctober 31, 2011, her employment was terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\n\f              Ms. Hughes initiated the Grievance Procedure, asserting that her employer had\n\nrefused to provide needed reasonable accommodations. Reportedly, several grievance\n\nhearings had occurred, with another grievance hearing scheduled to take place in late 2012.\n\nHowever, prior to the holding of the latest grievance hearing, Ms. Hughes filed the instant\n\ncivil action in circuit court against the respondents: WVU;2 Jeanette Motsch, Executive\n\nOfficer for Social Justice; and Mary Roberta “Bobbie” Brandt, Medical Management and\n\nADA Compliance Officer (collectively, “the Hughes respondents”). In her civil action, Ms.\n\nHughes alleged violations of the WVHRA for the failure to provide reasonable\n\naccommodations for her disability. The Hughes respondents moved the circuit court to\n\ndismiss the complaint, arguing that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction based\n\nupon Ms. Hughes’s failure to exhaust all available administrative remedies prior to filing the\n\ncivil action. Moreover, the Hughes respondents argued that Ms. Hughes had started the\n\ngrievance process, which must be completed prior to a civil action on the same issues.\n\n\n\n              By order of November 13, 2012, the circuit court granted the motion to dismiss,\n\nfinding that a circuit court action under the WVHRA is not precluded by prior grievance\n\nproceedings. However, the circuit court found that a parallel, contemporaneous proceeding\n\n\n\n              2\n             Recognizing the circuit court’s explanation that the parties incorrectly named\nWVU as the defendant and that the true party defendant is the West Virginia Board of\nGovernors, we use the misnomer “WVU” to maintain consistency with the case styling\nbelow.\n\n                                              6\n\n\fmay not be maintained. Accordingly, the circuit court ruled that Ms. Hughes, having elected\n\nthe Grievance Procedure, must exhaust her administrative remedies before filing an action\n\nin circuit court. Ms. Hughes appealed to this Court, and her case was consolidated with\n\nWeimer v. Sanders, Case Number 12-0477.\n\n\n\n                                              II.\n\n\n                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\n              The consolidated appeals before this Court result from the lower courts’\n\ngranting of motions to dismiss. It is well settled that “[a]ppellate review of a circuit court’s\n\norder granting a motion to dismiss a complaint is de novo.” Syl. pt. 2, State ex rel. McGraw\n\nv. Scott Runyan Pontiac–Buick, Inc., 194 W. Va. 770, 461 S .E.2d 516 (1995). Further,\n\nrecognizing that this case requires review of a purely legal issue, we have counseled that\n\n“[w]here the issue on an appeal from the circuit court is clearly a question of law or involving\n\nan interpretation of a statute, we apply a de novo standard of review.” Syl. pt. 1, Chrystal\n\nR.M. v. Charlie A.L., 194 W. Va. 138, 459 S.E.2d 415 (1995). Mindful of this applicable\n\nstandard, we now consider the substantive issues raised herein.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\n\f                                             III.\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\n              On appeal to this Court, Ms. Weimer asserts that the circuit court erred in its\n\ndetermination that administrative procedures must be exhausted before an action can be\n\nmaintained in the circuit court. Thus, Ms. Weimer claims that the circuit court’s dismissal\n\nof her complaint was flawed. Similarly, Ms. Hughes argues that the circuit court erred in\n\ndismissing her complaint based on its finding that she had not completed the grievance\n\nprocess and, further, in its ruling that commencement of the Grievance Procedure requires\n\nconclusion of the same. In essence, these cases present to this Court the question of whether\n\na public employee, whose employment confers grievance rights before the Grievance Board,\n\nis required to exhaust the administrative Grievance Procedure before initiating a complaint\n\nin the circuit court alleging violations of the WVHRA. Moreover, Ms. Hughes’s case raises\n\nthe additional question of whether commencement of the Grievance Procedure precludes the\n\ninstitution of a circuit court action prior to exhaustion of the Grievance Procedure.\n\n\n\n              At the outset, the initial question for this Court is whether the Grievance\n\nProcedure supplies an exclusive remedy or mandatory proceeding to the petitioners. To\n\ndetermine the answer, this Court must look to the statute. The Grievance Procedure applies\n\nto public employees and states, in pertinent part, that\n\n                     [w]ithin fifteen days following the occurrence of the\n              event upon which the grievance is based, or within fifteen days\n\n                                              8\n\n\f              of the date upon which the event became known to the\n              employee, or within fifteen days of the most recent occurrence\n              of a continuing practice giving rise to a grievance, an employee\n              may file a written grievance with the chief administrator stating\n              the nature of the grievance and the relief requested and request\n              either a conference or a hearing. . . .\n\nW. Va. Code § 6C-2-4(a)(1) (2008) (Repl. Vol. 2010).             The first step in statutory\n\nconstruction is to identify the intent expressed by the Legislature in promulgating the\n\nprovision at issue. “The primary object in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect\n\nto the intent of the Legislature.” Syl. pt. 1, Smith v. State Workmen’s Comp. Comm’r, 159\n\nW. Va. 108, 219 S.E.2d 361 (1975). Next, we look to the particular language used by the\n\nLegislature. “Where the language of a statute is clear and without ambiguity the plain\n\nmeaning is to be accepted without resorting to the rules of interpretation.” Syl. pt. 2, State\n\nv. Elder, 152 W. Va. 571, 165 S.E.2d 108 (1968). Accord Syl. pt. 5, State v. General Daniel\n\nMorgan Post No. 548, Veterans of Foreign Wars, 144 W. Va. 137, 107 S.E.2d 353 (1959)\n\n(“When a statute is clear and unambiguous and the legislative intent is plain, the statute\n\nshould not be interpreted by the courts, and in such case it is the duty of the courts not to\n\nconstrue but to apply the statute.”). Further guidance states that, “[i]n the absence of any\n\ndefinition of the intended meaning of words or terms used in a legislative enactment, they\n\nwill, in the interpretation of the act, be given their common, ordinary and accepted meaning\n\nin the connection in which they are used.” Syl. pt. 1, Miners in Gen. Group v. Hix, 123\n\nW. Va. 637, 17 S.E.2d 810 (1941), overruled on other grounds by Lee–Norse Co. v.\n\nRutledge, 170 W. Va. 162, 291 S.E.2d 477 (1982).\n\n                                              9\n\n\f              Under the plain wording of the statute, a public employee has a fifteen day time\n\nlimit that begins to accrue based upon different factual scenarios. Within the applicable\n\nfifteen day period, “an employee may file a written grievance with the chief administrator\n\nstating the nature of the grievance[.]” (Emphasis added). As a general rule, the word “may”\n\nis afforded a permissive connotation, which renders the referenced act discretionary, rather\n\nthan mandatory, in nature. See State v. Hedrick, 204 W. Va. 547, 552, 514 S.E.2d 397, 402\n\n(1999) (“The word ‘may’ generally signifies permission and connotes discretion.” (citations\n\nomitted)). Thus, applying this discretionary connotation to the present case, we now hold\n\nthat a public employee may file a written grievance to the West Virginia Public Employee\n\nGrievance Board pursuant to W. Va. Code § 6C-2-4(a)(1) (2008) (Repl. Vol. 2010);\n\nhowever, such filing is permissive and not mandatory under the clear wording of the statute.\n\n\n\n              Having determined that the Grievance Procedure is discretionary, we turn to\n\nthe issue of whether the decision to forego the filing of the permissive grievance with the\n\nGrievance Board precludes a petitioner’s right to file a cause of action elsewhere. In other\n\nwords, we must determine whether the exhaustion of administrative remedies is a\n\nprecondition to the filing of an action in circuit court.\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\n\f              As noted previously, Ms. Weimer filed her action in the circuit court pursuant\n\nto the WVHRA, without having filed a grievance with the Grievance Board.3 We have\n\nexpressly held that a claimant may pursue an action in either the Human Rights Commission\n\nor the circuit court. Specifically, “[a] plaintiff may, as an alternative to filing a complaint\n\nwith the Human Rights Commission, initiate an action in circuit court to enforce rights\n\ngranted by the West Virginia Human Rights Act.” Syl. pt. 1, Price v. Boone Cnty.\n\nAmbulance Auth., 175 W. Va. 676, 337 S.E.2d 913 (1985).4 Despite the fact that the Human\n\nRights Commission is an administrative agency that has jurisdiction to evaluate such claims,\n\nthere is no requirement that a complainant must exhaust the administrative remedies available\n\nthrough the Human Rights Commission prior to filing a circuit court action.5\n\n\n              3\n               Factually and legally, Ms. Hughes’s case raises an additional issue than Ms.\nWeimer’s situation. Ms. Weimer never availed herself of the grievance process. However,\nMs. Hughes originally filed a grievance, but then abandoned the claim and filed her case in\ncircuit court. The legal impact of this factual departure will be discussed, infra.\n              4\n                 Similarly, in a recent decision under the West Virginia Wage Payment and\nCollection Act (“WVWPCA”), this Court focused on the clear language of the WVWPCA\nand held that, “[p]ursuant to W. Va. Code, 21-5-12(a) (1975), a person whose wages have\nnot been paid in accord with [WVWPCA] may initiate a claim for the unpaid wages either\nthrough the administrative remedies provided under the Act or by filing a complaint for the\nunpaid wages directly in circuit court.” Syl. pt. 3, Beichler v. West Virginia Univ. at\nParkersburg, 226 W. Va. 321, 700 S.E.2d 532 (2010). This Court was persuaded that if the\nLegislature had intended to require a claimant to exhaust administrative remedies prior to\nfiling a civil action under the WVWPCA, the Legislature could have so provided, but it did\nnot. Similar to the WVWPCA, the WVHRA has no requirement for the exhaustion of any\nadministrative remedies prior to pursuing a civil action.\n              5\n              The general rule in this Court with regard to the exhaustion of administrative\nremedies provides “that where an administrative remedy is provided by statute or by rules\n                                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                              11\n\n\f              It stands to reason that if a claimant is not required to maintain an action before\n\nthe Human Rights Commission prior to filing a claim in the circuit court, the claimant is,\n\n\n\n              5\n                (...continued)\nand regulations having the force and effect of law, relief must be sought from the\nadministrative body, and such remedy must be exhausted before the courts will act.” Syl. pt.\n1, Daurelle v. Traders Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n., 143 W. Va. 674, 104 S.E.2d 320 (1958).\nSee also Syl. pt. 1, Sturm v. The Bd. of Educ. of Kanawha Cnty., 223 W. Va. 277, 672 S.E.2d\n606 (2008) (same); Syl. pt. 7, Expedited Trans. Sys. Inc. v. Vieweg, 207 W. Va. 90, 529\nS.E.2d 110 (2000) (same). However, we also have recognized\n\n              that where separate legislative enactments exist which provide\n              separate administrative remedies, preclusive doctrines will not\n              necessarily be applied. See Collins v. Elkay Mining Co., 179\n              W. Va. 549, 371 S.E.2d 46 (1988); Davis v. Kitt Energy Corp.,\n              179 W. Va. 37, 365 S.E.2d 82 (1987); Wiggins v. Eastern\n              Associated Coal Corp., 178 W. Va. 63, 357 S.E.2d 745 (1987).\n\nLiller v. West Virginia Human Rights Comm’n, 180 W. Va. 433, 441, 376 S.E.2d 639, 647\n(1988). Indeed, our cases require us to determine “whether applying the doctrines [of\npreclusion] is consistent with the express or implied policy in the legislation which created\nthe body.” Syl. pt. 3, in part, Mellon-Stuart Co. v. Hall, 178 W. Va. 291, 359 S.E.2d 124\n(1987).\n\n               We also have recognized exceptions to the rule requiring the exhaustion of\nremedies. Indeed, in Price, we recognized that the alternative administrative and judicial\navenues run “counter to the general rule of statutory construction that where a new right is\ncreated by statute, the remedy provided for its violation is exclusive.” Price v. Boone Cnty.\nAmbulance Auth., 175 W. Va. 676, 678, 337 S.E.2d 913, 916-17 (1985). “Where the\navailable administrative remedy is inadequate, this Court recognizes an exception to the\ngeneral rule that where a new right is created by statute, the remedy can be only that which\nthe statute prescribes.” Syl. pt. 2, Wiggins v. Eastern Assoc. Coal Corp., 178 W. Va. 63, 357\nS.E.2d 745 (1987). Also, “[t]his Court will not require the exhaustion of administrative\nremedies where such remedies are duplicative or the effort to obtain them futile.” Syl. pt. 6,\nWiggins, id. Finally, “[t]he doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is inapplicable\nwhere resort to available procedures would be an exercise in futility.” Syl. pt. 1, State ex rel.\nBoard of Educ. v. Casey, 176 W. Va. 733, 349 S.E.2d 436 (1986).\n\n                                               12\n\n\flikewise, not required to file a grievance with the Grievance Board before filing a claim\n\npursuant to the WVHRA in the circuit court. This is especially true given the fact that the\n\nHuman Rights Commission has broader power and authority to remedy discrimination claims\n\nthan does the Grievance Board.6 As this Court has explained,\n\n                     [t]he West Virginia Education and State Employees\n              Grievance Board does not have authority to determine liability\n              under the West Virginia Human Rights Act, W. Va. Code,\n              § 5-11-1, et seq.; nevertheless, the Grievance Board’s authority\n              to provide relief to employees for “discrimination,”\n              “favoritism,” and “harassment,” as those terms are defined in\n              W. Va. Code, 18-29-2 (1992),[7] includes jurisdiction to remedy\n              discrimination that also would violate the Human Rights Act.\n\nSyl. pt. 1, Vest v. Board of Educ., 193 W. Va. 222, 455 S.E.2d 781 (1995) (internal footnote\n\nadded). Therefore, we now hold that a plaintiff may, as an alternative to filing a grievance\n\nwith the West Virginia Public Employees Grievance Board, initiate an action in circuit court\n\nto enforce rights granted by the West Virginia Human Rights Act, W. Va. Code § 5-11-1 et\n\nseq.\n\n              6\n               While the Grievance Board has authority to provide remedies for causes of\naction within its definitions, we note that the Grievance Procedure and the WVHRA have\ndifferent definitions for the term “discrimination.” Under the grievance process,\n“discrimination” refers to “any differences in the treatment of similarly situated employees,\nunless the differences are related to the actual job responsibilities of the employee or are\nagreed to in writing by the employees.” W. Va. Code § 6C-2-2(d). However, pursuant to the\nWVHRA, “‘discriminate’ or ‘discrimination’ means to exclude from, or fail or refuse to\nextend to, a person equal opportunities because of race, religion, color, national origin,\nancestry, sex, age, blindness, disability or familial status and includes to separate or\nsegregate.” W. Va. Code § 5-11-3(h).\n              7\n             W. Va. Code §18-29-2 (1992) has been recodified and now is found at W. Va.\nCode § 6C-2-2 (2008) (Repl. Vol. 2010).\n\n                                             13\n\n\f              To hold otherwise would create a disparity between remedies for WVHRA\n\nviolations available to public employees and employees in the private sector.             The\n\nLegislature, in enacting the WVHRA, sets forth that all West Virginia citizens shall have\n\nequal employment opportunities:\n\n                     It is the public policy of the state of West Virginia to\n              provide all of its citizens equal opportunity for employment,\n              equal access to places of public accommodations, and equal\n              opportunity in the sale, purchase, lease, rental and financing of\n              housing accommodations or real property. Equal opportunity in\n              the areas of employment and public accommodations is hereby\n              declared to be a human right or civil right of all persons without\n              regard to race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, age,\n              blindness or disability. Equal opportunity in housing\n              accommodations or real property is hereby declared to be a\n              human right or civil right of all persons without regard to race,\n              religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, blindness,\n              disability or familial status.\n\n                     The denial of these rights to properly qualified persons by\n              reason of race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, age,\n              blindness, disability or familial status is contrary to the\n              principles of freedom and equality of opportunity and is\n              destructive to a free and democratic society.\n\nW. Va. Code § 5-11-2 (1998) (Repl. Vol. 2011). We discern no reason why a public\n\nemployee should be treated differently than a private employee in cases of alleged\n\ndiscrimination, et cetera, and be deprived of the opportunity to proceed directly to the Human\n\nRights Commission or the circuit court.8 Thus, we find that the circuit court erred when it\n\n\n              8\n               One argument set forth by the petitioners is that selecting any one specific\navenue for relief could result in an expiration of time within which to file a proper action in\n                                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                               14\n\n\fdismissed Ms. Weimer’s action on the basis that she had failed to exhaust the administrative\n\nremedies afforded to her under the Grievance Procedure. Furthermore, dismissal of Ms.\n\nHughes’s claim on the basis that she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies was also\n\nin error.\n\n\n\n              Having determined that a claimant is not required to pursue his or her\n\nadministrative remedies under the Grievance Procedure prior to the commencement of an\n\naction in circuit court that alleges a claim under the WVHRA, we now turn to discuss the\n\nadditional legal issue raised by the facts of Ms. Hughes’s case. Ms. Hughes initiated the\n\nGrievance Procedure and several grievance hearings were held. Another grievance hearing\n\nwas scheduled; however, prior to the time for the scheduled grievance hearing, Ms. Hughes\n\nfiled the instant civil action in circuit court. The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss\n\non the basis that “Ms. Hughes has failed to exhaust her available remedies by pursuing an\n\naction in Circuit Court while the grievance process she had previously commenced is still\n\npending.”\n\n\n\n              We have held that a previous grievance does not preclude a subsequent action\n\nin circuit court. In that regard, we stated that “[a] civil action filed under the West Virginia\n\n\n              8\n               (...continued)\none of the other forums. Our resolution of this matter obviates any need to discuss perceived\nissues regarding lapsing of time frames.\n\n                                              15\n\n\fHuman Rights Act, W. Va. Code, 5-11-1, et seq., is not precluded by a prior grievance\n\ndecided by the West Virginia Education and State Employees Grievance Board arising out\n\nof the same facts and circumstances.” Syl. pt. 3, Vest, 193 W. Va. 222, 455 S.E.2d 781.\n\nBecause of the striking differences between the procedures before the Grievance Board and\n\nthe Human Rights Commission and/or a circuit court, the Vest Court determined that even\n\na resolution of a grievance by the Grievance Board does not preclude further adjudication of\n\nthe claims pursuant to the WVHRA. Specifically,\n\n                       [f]or issue or claim preclusion to attach to quasi-judicial\n               determinations of administrative agencies, at least where there\n               is no statutory authority directing otherwise, the prior decision\n               must be rendered pursuant to the agency’s adjudicatory authority\n               and the procedures employed by the agency must be\n               substantially similar to those used in a court. In addition, the\n               identicality of the issues litigated is a key component to the\n               application of administrative res judicata or collateral estoppel.\n\nSyl. pt. 2, Vest, id.\n\n\n\n               In reaching the result in Vest, we explained that\n\n                      [t]he procedures employed by the Grievance Board are\n               not substantially similar to those employed by either a court of\n               law or the Human Rights Commission (Commission), and the\n               differences are of profound significance. Thus, even if a\n               grievance hearing examiner concludes that an employer’s\n               adverse action to a grievant was not “discriminatory,” but was\n               job related, that determination is not binding on a court or the\n               Commission deciding a claim under the Human Rights Act–\n               regardless of whether the grievant alleged or adduced evidence\n               of discriminatory motive or disparate impact at the grievance\n               hearing and regardless of whether the Grievance Board made a\n\n                                               16\n\n\f              determination about such issues.\n\n                      As noted above, the Legislature designed the grievance\n              process to be simple and expeditious. Consequently, the process\n              is streamlined and lacks many of the adversarial accoutrements\n              found in judicial and Commission’s proceedings. In the vast\n              majority of grievances, for example, the grievant is not\n              represented by a lawyer. Moreover, and more importantly, the\n              grievance process does not provide for any of the discovery\n              mechanisms available under the Rules of Civil Procedure and\n              the Commission’s procedural rules. Finally, in stark contrast to\n              the Human Rights Act, the grievance statute does not provide\n              for the right to an independent investigation of each grievance\n              filed before the Board, does not make available at public\n              expense representation by a lawyer for cases that proceed to a\n              hearing before an administrative law judge, and does not give\n              employees the option of skipping the administrative process and\n              pursuing their claims de novo in circuit court where jury trials\n              and the full array of legal and equitable remedies are obtainable.\n\nVest, 193 W. Va. at 227, 455 S.E.2d at 786.\n\n\n\n              Factually, Ms. Vest, a substitute teacher at a public school, filed a grievance\n\nwith the Grievance Board based on her termination. At a grievance hearing, Ms. Vest\n\npresented evidence in support of her discrimination claim. However, in her post-hearing\n\nbrief, she voluntarily relinquished her claim upon her belief that the Grievance Procedure\n\nwas not the proper forum to hear her discrimination claim. Ms. Vest’s grievance was denied\n\nin a decision that contained no conclusions of law with regard to her discrimination claim.\n\nDespite the fact that her grievance had culminated in a decision, albeit a decision that did not\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\n\faddress the discrimination claim, we found the Grievance Board’s determinations had no\n\npreclusive effect over her human rights claims.\n\n\n\n              Vest stands for the proposition that a claimant can prosecute a case before the\n\nGrievance Board to its conclusion, yet still retain the right to redress for the same issue\n\nbefore the circuit court. The logic follows that, if a claimant commences an action before\n\nthe Grievance Board and then abandons or relinquishes the claims so that there is no final\n\ndecision from the Grievance Board, there is nothing to preclude a subsequent action in the\n\ncircuit court. Based on the foregoing and this Court’s previous allusions to the same, we now\n\nspecifically hold that a civil action commenced in circuit court under the West Virginia\n\nHuman Rights Act, W. Va. Code § 5-11-1 et seq., is not precluded by a grievance that was\n\nfiled with, but not decided by, the West Virginia Education and State Employees Grievance\n\nBoard, W. Va. Code § 6C-2-1 et seq., and arising out of the same facts and circumstances.9\n\n\n\n\n              9\n                We recognize that there may be some overlap of remedies between the\ndifferent statutory schemes. We emphasize, however, that there can be only one recovery for\neach injury. An award under either process will be set off against any recovery from the\nother forum.\n\n                                             18\n\n\f                                          IV.\n\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n\n             Based on the foregoing, the circuit courts’ dismissal orders are reversed and\n\nremanded for further consideration.\n\n                                                                Reversed and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\n\f",

Va. Code § 5-11-1 et seq. (“WVHRA”) is proper in the absence of the exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies available pursuant to the West Virginia Public Employees Grievance\n\nProcedure, W. Va. Code § 6C-2-1 et seq. (“Grievance Procedure”). In these combined cases,\n\nTheresa Weimer (“Ms. Weimer”) and Vicky Lou Hughes (“Ms. Hughes”) (collectively, “the\n\npetitioners”) appeal the respective circuit courts’ dismissals of their complaints. On appeal\n\nto this Court, the petitioners argue that the circuit courts erred in the determinations that the\n\nexhaustion of the Grievance Procedure was a necessary precondition to the filing of a circuit\n\ncourt action. Upon a review of the parties’ briefs,1 the appendix records designated for\n\nappellate consideration, the governing law, and the parties’ oral arguments, we reverse the\n\nrulings of the circuit courts and remand for further proceedings. Specifically, in Case\n\nNumber 12-0477 regarding Ms. Weimer, we reverse the March 12, 2012, “Order Granting\n\nMotion to Dismiss for Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies” entered by the Circuit\n\n\n\n              1\n                We acknowledge the contribution of the following amici curiae who filed\nbriefs in this case: Employment Lawyers Association; The West Virginia Human Rights\nCommission; West Virginia Advocates, Inc.; The West Virginia Conference of Branches of\nthe NAACP; WV Free; The Mountain State Bar Association; and American Civil Liberties\nUnion of West Virginia. All of the amici briefs were filed in Ms. Weimer’s appeal, Case\nNumber 12-0477, and posit that the dismissal of claims for failure to exhaust grievance\nprocedures should be reversed. We value the participation of the amici and will consider\ntheir briefs in conjunction with the parties’ arguments.\n\n                                               1\n\n\fCourt of Pocahontas County and remand the case for further consideration consistent with\n\nthis opinion. Additionally, in Case Number 12-1506 regarding Ms. Hughes, we reverse the\n\nCircuit Court of Monongalia County’s November 13, 2012, “Order Granting Defendants’\n\nMotion to Dismiss” and remand for additional judicial proceedings comporting with the\n\ndiscussion contained herein.\n\n\n\n                                              I.\n\n\n                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n              Because the errors assigned in each of the cases sub judice are substantially the\n\nsame, they have been consolidated for this Court’s consideration and decision. Resolution\n\nof these cases is based purely on the legal issues. However, a brief recitation of the\n\nindividual facts giving rise to each appeal is set forth below.\n\n\n\n                      A. Theresa L. Weimer, Case Number 12-0477\n\n              In 2006, Ms. Weimer began teaching at Pocahontas County High School\n\n(“PCHS”), a public school. During her teaching career at PCHS, she suffered from\n\ninsulin-dependent diabetes, lumbar degenerative disk disease, depression, degenerative joint\n\ndisease, fibromyalgia, plantar fasciitis, acute renal failure, hypertension, and sleep apnea.\n\nMs. Weimer’s medical problems were known to her supervisor, the school principal. Ms.\n\nWeimer asserts that the school principal harassed her, told her he needed “healthy teachers,”\n\n\n                                              2\n\n\fand failed to provide accommodations. She received a letter in 2009 from the principal\n\nregarding her alleged inability to teach. Further, she was suspended without pay on\n\nNovember 30, 2009; however, this suspension eventually was converted to family medical\n\nleave. Ms. Weimer returned to work in Fall 2010, and states that she expected work\n\naccommodations. In particular, she requested smaller class sizes and/or assistance from a\n\nteacher’s aide, which she asserts were refused by the principal.\n\n\n\n              In late 2011, Ms. Weimer tripped and fell in her classroom. Ms. Weimer\n\ncontends that the principal used this incident against her based on the perception that it\n\noccurred because of her disabilities. Shortly thereafter, it was recommended that Ms.\n\nWeimer’s employment be terminated: a pretermination hearing was conducted, which\n\nincluded evidence that Ms. Weimer had teaching deficiencies, including falling asleep while\n\nteaching and leaving students unattended. Based upon the recommendations of the school\n\nprincipal and the school superintendent, Ms. Weimer’s position as a public school teacher\n\nwas terminated by the Pocahontas County Board of Education on October 27, 2011.\n\n\n\n              Subsequent thereto, on November 30, 2011, Ms. Weimer filed a complaint in\n\nthe Circuit Court of Pocahontas County against Thomas Sanders, the Principal of PCHS;\n\nC.C. Lester, the Superintendent of the Pocahontas County Board of Education; and the\n\nPocahontas County Board of Education (collectively, “the Weimer respondents”). Ms.\n\n\n                                             3\n\n\fWeimer did not file a grievance with the West Virginia Public Employees Grievance Board\n\n(“Grievance Board”). See W. Va. Code § 6C-2-1 et seq. The circuit court complaint asserted\n\nviolations under the WVHRA: discriminatory discharge on the basis of actual or perceived\n\ndisability; hostile work environment on the basis of actual or perceived disability; and\n\ndisparate discipline on the basis of actual or perceived disability.\n\n\n\n              The Weimer respondents filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, in which they\n\nargued that Ms. Weimer’s complaint was flawed because she failed to exhaust her\n\nadministrative remedies with the Grievance Board. By order entered March 12, 2012, the\n\ncircuit court granted the motion to dismiss. The lower court reasoned that facts alleged in\n\nthe complaint point to “discrimination,” “harassment,” “favoritism,” and other matters that\n\nmay properly be addressed by the Grievance Procedure. Ultimately, the circuit court ruled\n\nthat Ms. Weimer first must exhaust her administrative remedies available through the\n\nGrievance Procedure prior to bringing a claim pursuant to the WVHRA before the circuit\n\ncourt. Ms. Weimer appealed to this Court, and her case was consolidated with Hughes v.\n\nWest Virginia University, Case Number 12-1506.\n\n\n\n                      B. Vicky Lou Hughes, Case Number 12-1506\n\n              Ms. Hughes began employment in December 2007 as a coordinator/clinical\n\nassociate for the Center for Excellence in Disabilities (“CED”), a branch of West Virginia\n\n\n                                              4\n\n\fUniversity (“WVU”). Her position provided Traumatic Brain Injury (“TBI”) services\n\nthroughout the state. During the interview process, Ms. Hughes advised the CED that she\n\nhas a disability known as multiple chemical sensitivity, which requires reasonable\n\naccommodation. Initially, the CED accommodated Ms. Hughes’s requests, permitting her\n\nto use her personal vehicle for work travel and allowing her to work from a different office\n\nlocation while her regular office location was undergoing renovation.\n\n\n\n              On April 6, 2010, a meeting was held wherein Ms. Hughes was informed that\n\nthere had been consumer complaints regarding her job performance. After an investigation,\n\na warning letter was issued June 11, 2010, stating that Ms. Hughes’s work quality was\n\nunsatisfactory. After the April 6, 2010, meeting, it was alleged that Ms. Hughes had engaged\n\nin additional inappropriate and potentially unethical clinical procedures and client\n\ninteractions. Ms. Hughes argued that these allegations were false and were made with the\n\npurpose and intent of harassing her in retribution for her requests for accommodation.\n\n\n\n              Ms. Hughes, in June 2010, suffered an orthopedic injury that resulted in a\n\nmedical leave of absence of approximately one year. When she attempted to return to work,\n\nshe was advised that several of her requests for accommodation had been rejected. On\n\nOctober 31, 2011, her employment was terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\n\f              Ms. Hughes initiated the Grievance Procedure, asserting that her employer had\n\nrefused to provide needed reasonable accommodations. Reportedly, several grievance\n\nhearings had occurred, with another grievance hearing scheduled to take place in late 2012.\n\nHowever, prior to the holding of the latest grievance hearing, Ms. Hughes filed the instant\n\ncivil action in circuit court against the respondents: WVU;2 Jeanette Motsch, Executive\n\nOfficer for Social Justice; and Mary Roberta “Bobbie” Brandt, Medical Management and\n\nADA Compliance Officer (collectively, “the Hughes respondents”). In her civil action, Ms.\n\nHughes alleged violations of the WVHRA for the failure to provide reasonable\n\naccommodations for her disability. The Hughes respondents moved the circuit court to\n\ndismiss the complaint, arguing that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction based\n\nupon Ms. Hughes’s failure to exhaust all available administrative remedies prior to filing the\n\ncivil action. Moreover, the Hughes respondents argued that Ms. Hughes had started the\n\ngrievance process, which must be completed prior to a civil action on the same issues.\n\n\n\n              By order of November 13, 2012, the circuit court granted the motion to dismiss,\n\nfinding that a circuit court action under the WVHRA is not precluded by prior grievance\n\nproceedings. However, the circuit court found that a parallel, contemporaneous proceeding\n\n\n\n              2\n             Recognizing the circuit court’s explanation that the parties incorrectly named\nWVU as the defendant and that the true party defendant is the West Virginia Board of\nGovernors, we use the misnomer “WVU” to maintain consistency with the case styling\nbelow.\n\n                                              6\n\n\fmay not be maintained. Accordingly, the circuit court ruled that Ms. Hughes, having elected\n\nthe Grievance Procedure, must exhaust her administrative remedies before filing an action\n\nin circuit court. Ms. Hughes appealed to this Court, and her case was consolidated with\n\nWeimer v. Sanders, Case Number 12-0477.\n\n\n\n                                              II.\n\n\n                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\n              The consolidated appeals before this Court result from the lower courts’\n\ngranting of motions to dismiss.

Mindful of this applicable\n\nstandard, we now consider the substantive issues raised herein.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\n\f                                             III.\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\n              On appeal to this Court, Ms. Weimer asserts that the circuit court erred in its\n\ndetermination that administrative procedures must be exhausted before an action can be\n\nmaintained in the circuit court. Thus, Ms. Weimer claims that the circuit court’s dismissal\n\nof her complaint was flawed. Similarly, Ms. Hughes argues that the circuit court erred in\n\ndismissing her complaint based on its finding that she had not completed the grievance\n\nprocess and, further, in its ruling that commencement of the Grievance Procedure requires\n\nconclusion of the same. In essence, these cases present to this Court the question of whether\n\na public employee, whose employment confers grievance rights before the Grievance Board,\n\nis required to exhaust the administrative Grievance Procedure before initiating a complaint\n\nin the circuit court alleging violations of the WVHRA. Moreover, Ms. Hughes’s case raises\n\nthe additional question of whether commencement of the Grievance Procedure precludes the\n\ninstitution of a circuit court action prior to exhaustion of the Grievance Procedure.\n\n\n\n              At the outset, the initial question for this Court is whether the Grievance\n\nProcedure supplies an exclusive remedy or mandatory proceeding to the petitioners. To\n\ndetermine the answer, this Court must look to the statute. The Grievance Procedure applies\n\nto public employees and states, in pertinent part, that\n\n                     [w]ithin fifteen days following the occurrence of the\n              event upon which the grievance is based, or within fifteen days\n\n                                              8\n\n\f              of the date upon which the event became known to the\n              employee, or within fifteen days of the most recent occurrence\n              of a continuing practice giving rise to a grievance, an employee\n              may file a written grievance with the chief administrator stating\n              the nature of the grievance and the relief requested and request\n              either a conference or a hearing. . . .\n\nW. Va. Code § 6C-2-4(a)(1) (2008) (Repl. Vol. 2010).             The first step in statutory\n\nconstruction is to identify the intent expressed by the Legislature in promulgating the\n\nprovision at issue. “The primary object in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect\n\nto the intent of the Legislature.” Syl. pt. 1, Smith v.

Next, we look to the particular language used by the\n\nLegislature. “Where the language of a statute is clear and without ambiguity the plain\n\nmeaning is to be accepted without resorting to the rules of interpretation.” Syl. pt. 2, State\n\nv.

Within the applicable\n\nfifteen day period, “an employee may file a written grievance with the chief administrator\n\nstating the nature of the grievance[.]” (Emphasis added). As a general rule, the word “may”\n\nis afforded a permissive connotation, which renders the referenced act discretionary, rather\n\nthan mandatory, in nature. See State v. Hedrick, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">W.

Thus, applying this discretionary connotation to the present case, we now hold\n\nthat a public employee may file a written grievance to the West Virginia Public Employee\n\nGrievance Board pursuant to W. Va. Code § 6C-2-4(a)(1) (2008) (Repl. Vol. 2010);\n\nhowever, such filing is permissive and not mandatory under the clear wording of the statute.\n\n\n\n              Having determined that the Grievance Procedure is discretionary, we turn to\n\nthe issue of whether the decision to forego the filing of the permissive grievance with the\n\nGrievance Board precludes a petitioner’s right to file a cause of action elsewhere. In other\n\nwords, we must determine whether the exhaustion of administrative remedies is a\n\nprecondition to the filing of an action in circuit court.\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\n\f              As noted previously, Ms. Weimer filed her action in the circuit court pursuant\n\nto the WVHRA, without having filed a grievance with the Grievance Board.3 We have\n\nexpressly held that a claimant may pursue an action in either the Human Rights Commission\n\nor the circuit court. Specifically, “[a] plaintiff may, as an alternative to filing a complaint\n\nwith the Human Rights Commission, initiate an action in circuit court to enforce rights\n\ngranted by the West Virginia Human Rights Act.” Syl. pt. 1, Price v.

Ms. Weimer never availed herself of the grievance process. However,\nMs. Hughes originally filed a grievance, but then abandoned the claim and filed her case in\ncircuit court. The legal impact of this factual departure will be discussed, infra.\n              4\n                 Similarly, in a recent decision under the West Virginia Wage Payment and\nCollection Act (“WVWPCA”), this Court focused on the clear language of the WVWPCA\nand held that, “[p]ursuant to W. Va. Code, 21-5-12(a) (1975), a person whose wages have\nnot been paid in accord with [WVWPCA] may initiate a claim for the unpaid wages either\nthrough the administrative remedies provided under the Act or by filing a complaint for the\nunpaid wages directly in circuit court.” Syl. pt. 3, Beichler v.

This Court was persuaded that if the\nLegislature had intended to require a claimant to exhaust administrative remedies prior to\nfiling a civil action under the WVWPCA, the Legislature could have so provided, but it did\nnot.

Va. Code, 18-29-2 (1992),[7] includes jurisdiction to remedy\n              discrimination that also would violate the Human Rights Act.\n\nSyl. pt. 1, Vest v.

Therefore, we now hold that a plaintiff may, as an alternative to filing a grievance\n\nwith the West Virginia Public Employees Grievance Board, initiate an action in circuit court\n\nto enforce rights granted by the West Virginia Human Rights Act, W. Va. Code § 5-11-1 et\n\nseq.\n\n              6\n               While the Grievance Board has authority to provide remedies for causes of\naction within its definitions, we note that the Grievance Procedure and the WVHRA have\ndifferent definitions for the term “discrimination.” Under the grievance process,\n“discrimination” refers to “any differences in the treatment of similarly situated employees,\nunless the differences are related to the actual job responsibilities of the employee or are\nagreed to in writing by the employees.” W. Va. Code § 6C-2-2(d). However, pursuant to the\nWVHRA, “‘discriminate’ or ‘discrimination’ means to exclude from, or fail or refuse to\nextend to, a person equal opportunities because of race, religion, color, national origin,\nancestry, sex, age, blindness, disability or familial status and includes to separate or\nsegregate.” W. Va. Code § 5-11-3(h).\n              7\n             W. Va. Code §18-29-2 (1992) has been recodified and now is found at W. Va.\nCode § 6C-2-2 (2008) (Repl. Vol. 2010).\n\n                                             13\n\n\f              To hold otherwise would create a disparity between remedies for WVHRA\n\nviolations available to public employees and employees in the private sector.             The\n\nLegislature, in enacting the WVHRA, sets forth that all West Virginia citizens shall have\n\nequal employment opportunities:\n\n                     It is the public policy of the state of West Virginia to\n              provide all of its citizens equal opportunity for employment,\n              equal access to places of public accommodations, and equal\n              opportunity in the sale, purchase, lease, rental and financing of\n              housing accommodations or real property. Equal opportunity in\n              the areas of employment and public accommodations is hereby\n              declared to be a human right or civil right of all persons without\n              regard to race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, age,\n              blindness or disability. Equal opportunity in housing\n              accommodations or real property is hereby declared to be a\n              human right or civil right of all persons without regard to race,\n              religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, blindness,\n              disability or familial status.\n\n                     The denial of these rights to properly qualified persons by\n              reason of race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, age,\n              blindness, disability or familial status is contrary to the\n              principles of freedom and equality of opportunity and is\n              destructive to a free and democratic society.\n\nW. Va. Code § 5-11-2 (1998) (Repl. Vol. 2011). We discern no reason why a public\n\nemployee should be treated differently than a private employee in cases of alleged\n\ndiscrimination, et cetera, and be deprived of the opportunity to proceed directly to the Human\n\nRights Commission or the circuit court.8 Thus, we find that the circuit court erred when it\n\n\n              8\n               One argument set forth by the petitioners is that selecting any one specific\navenue for relief could result in an expiration of time within which to file a proper action in\n                                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                               14\n\n\fdismissed Ms. Weimer’s action on the basis that she had failed to exhaust the administrative\n\nremedies afforded to her under the Grievance Procedure. Furthermore, dismissal of Ms.\n\nHughes’s claim on the basis that she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies was also\n\nin error.\n\n\n\n              Having determined that a claimant is not required to pursue his or her\n\nadministrative remedies under the Grievance Procedure prior to the commencement of an\n\naction in circuit court that alleges a claim under the WVHRA, we now turn to discuss the\n\nadditional legal issue raised by the facts of Ms. Hughes’s case. Ms. Hughes initiated the\n\nGrievance Procedure and several grievance hearings were held. Another grievance hearing\n\nwas scheduled; however, prior to the time for the scheduled grievance hearing, Ms. Hughes\n\nfiled the instant civil action in circuit court. The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss\n\non the basis that “Ms. Hughes has failed to exhaust her available remedies by pursuing an\n\naction in Circuit Court while the grievance process she had previously commenced is still\n\npending.”\n\n\n\n              We have held that a previous grievance does not preclude a subsequent action\n\nin circuit court. In that regard, we stated that “[a] civil action filed under the West Virginia\n\n\n              8\n               (...continued)\none of the other forums. Our resolution of this matter obviates any need to discuss perceived\nissues regarding lapsing of time frames.\n\n                                              15\n\n\fHuman Rights Act, W. Va. Code, 5-11-1, et seq., is not precluded by a prior grievance\n\ndecided by the West Virginia Education and State Employees Grievance Board arising out\n\nof the same facts and circumstances.” Syl. pt. 3, Vest, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">W. Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1219292\"><a href=\"/opinion/1219292/vest-v-bd-of-educ-of-cty-of-nicholas/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\nBecause of the striking differences between the procedures before the Grievance Board and\n\nthe Human Rights Commission and/or a circuit court, the Vest Court determined that even\n\na resolution of a grievance by the Grievance Board does not preclude further adjudication of\n\nthe claims pursuant to the WVHRA. Specifically,\n\n                       [f]or issue or claim preclusion to attach to quasi-judicial\n               determinations of administrative agencies, at least where there\n               is no statutory authority directing otherwise, the prior decision\n               must be rendered pursuant to the agency’s adjudicatory authority\n               and the procedures employed by the agency must be\n               substantially similar to those used in a court. In addition, the\n               identicality of the issues litigated is a key component to the\n               application of administrative res judicata or collateral estoppel.\n\nSyl. pt. 2, Vest, id.\n\n\n\n               In reaching the result in Vest, we explained that\n\n                      [t]he procedures employed by the Grievance Board are\n               not substantially similar to those employed by either a court of\n               law or the Human Rights Commission (Commission), and the\n               differences are of profound significance. Thus, even if a\n               grievance hearing examiner concludes that an employer’s\n               adverse action to a grievant was not “discriminatory,” but was\n               job related, that determination is not binding on a court or the\n               Commission deciding a claim under the Human Rights Act–\n               regardless of whether the grievant alleged or adduced evidence\n               of discriminatory motive or disparate impact at the grievance\n               hearing and regardless of whether the Grievance Board made a\n\n                                               16\n\n\f              determination about such issues.\n\n                      As noted above, the Legislature designed the grievance\n              process to be simple and expeditious. Consequently, the process\n              is streamlined and lacks many of the adversarial accoutrements\n              found in judicial and Commission’s proceedings. In the vast\n              majority of grievances, for example, the grievant is not\n              represented by a lawyer. Moreover, and more importantly, the\n              grievance process does not provide for any of the discovery\n              mechanisms available under the Rules of Civil Procedure and\n              the Commission’s procedural rules. Finally, in stark contrast to\n              the Human Rights Act, the grievance statute does not provide\n              for the right to an independent investigation of each grievance\n              filed before the Board, does not make available at public\n              expense representation by a lawyer for cases that proceed to a\n              hearing before an administrative law judge, and does not give\n              employees the option of skipping the administrative process and\n              pursuing their claims de novo in circuit court where jury trials\n              and the full array of legal and equitable remedies are obtainable.\n\nVest, 193 W. Va. at 227, 455 S.E.2d at 786.\n\n\n\n              Factually, Ms. Vest, a substitute teacher at a public school, filed a grievance\n\nwith the Grievance Board based on her termination. At a grievance hearing, Ms. Vest\n\npresented evidence in support of her discrimination claim. However, in her post-hearing\n\nbrief, she voluntarily relinquished her claim upon her belief that the Grievance Procedure\n\nwas not the proper forum to hear her discrimination claim. Ms. Vest’s grievance was denied\n\nin a decision that contained no conclusions of law with regard to her discrimination claim.\n\nDespite the fact that her grievance had culminated in a decision, albeit a decision that did not\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\n\faddress the discrimination claim, we found the Grievance Board’s determinations had no\n\npreclusive effect over her human rights claims.\n\n\n\n              Vest stands for the proposition that a claimant can prosecute a case before the\n\nGrievance Board to its conclusion, yet still retain the right to redress for the same issue\n\nbefore the circuit court. The logic follows that, if a claimant commences an action before\n\nthe Grievance Board and then abandons or relinquishes the claims so that there is no final\n\ndecision from the Grievance Board, there is nothing to preclude a subsequent action in the\n\ncircuit court. Based on the foregoing and this Court’s previous allusions to the same, we now\n\nspecifically hold that a civil action commenced in circuit court under the West Virginia\n\nHuman Rights Act, W. Va. Code § 5-11-1 et seq., is not precluded by a grievance that was\n\nfiled with, but not decided by, the West Virginia Education and State Employees Grievance\n\nBoard, W. Va. Code § 6C-2-1 et seq., and arising out of the same facts and circumstances.9\n\n\n\n\n              9\n                We recognize that there may be some overlap of remedies between the\ndifferent statutory schemes. We emphasize, however, that there can be only one recovery for\neach injury. An award under either process will be set off against any recovery from the\nother forum.\n\n                                             18\n\n\f                                          IV.\n\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n\n             Based on the foregoing, the circuit courts’ dismissal orders are reversed and\n\nremanded for further consideration.\n\n                                                                Reversed and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\n\f</pre>",
