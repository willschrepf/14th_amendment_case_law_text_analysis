GARZA, and PARKER, Circuit Judges.\n\nPER CURIAM:*\n\n      Antonio Lacy, an inmate of the Texas Department of Criminal\n\nJustice's Institutional Division, appeals the district court's\n\ndismissal, under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) (1988), of his pro se, in\n\nforma pauperis civil rights suit.         We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n     *\n            Local Rule 47.5.1 provides: \"The publication of opinions that have\nno precedential value and merely decide particular cases on the basis of well-\nsettled principles of law imposes needless expense on the public and burdens on\nthe legal profession.\" Pursuant to that Rule, the Court has determined that this\nopinion should not be published.\n\f                                      I\n\n     Antonio Lacy filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1988),\n\nalleging that the conditions of his confinement violate his Eighth\n\nAmendment rights. Specifically, Lacy alleges that prison officials\n\n(1) allow HIV-positive inmates to masturbate and ejaculate in the\n\nprison dayroom, contaminating the drinking fountain and other\n\nsurfaces;    (2)   allow   inmates   to    expose   themselves   to    female\n\nemployees,   potentially    discouraging     the    female   employees    from\n\nresponding to inmates' emergency calls; (3) allow inmates to use\n\nvulgar and indecent language in speaking to prison employees and\n\nother inmates; and (4) allow inmates to play televisions and radios\n\nat high volume.       In his complaint, Lacy alleged that prison\n\nofficials do not enforce prison regulations designed to prevent\n\nthese problems, despite his and other inmates' complaints.               After\n\nLacy responded to an Order for a More Definite Statement, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed Lacy's complaint as frivolous under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1915(d), concluding that all four claims had no arguable\n\nbasis in law. Lacy appeals, arguing that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in dismissing his complaint under § 1915(d).\n\n                                     II\n\n     A district court may dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint as\n\nfrivolous under § 1915(d) if it lacks an arguable basis in law or\n\nfact.   Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S. Ct. 1827,\n\n1831-32, 104 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1989); Eason v. Thaler, 14 F.3d 8, 10\n\n(5th Cir. 1994).       \"A complaint is legally frivolous if it is\n\npremised on an `indisputably meritless legal theory.'\"                Boyd v.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fBiggers, 31 F.3d 279, 281-82 (5th Cir. 1994) (quoting Neitzke, 490\n\nU.S. at 327, 109 S. Ct. at 1833); see also Moore v. Mabus, 976 F.2d\n\n268, 271 (5th Cir. 1992) (reversing § 1915(d) dismissal based on\n\n\"potentially erroneous legal conclusions\" (citing Neitzke, 490 U.S.\n\nat 328-30, 109 S. Ct. at 1833-34)).       We review a district court's\n\n§ 1915(d) dismissal of an in forma pauperis complaint for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   Denton v. Hernandez, 504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S. Ct. 1728,\n\n1733-34, 118 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1992).       We consider whether \"(1) the\n\nplaintiff is proceeding pro se, (2) the court inappropriately\n\nresolved genuine issues of disputed fact, (3) the court applied\n\nerroneous legal conclusions, (4) the court has provided a statement\n\nof reasons which facilitates `intelligent appellate review,' and\n\n(5) any factual frivolousness could have been remedied through a\n\nmore specific pleading.\"      Moore, 976 F.2d at 270 (quoting Denton,\n\n504 U.S. at 34, 112 S. Ct. at 1734).\n\n     \"[T]he   treatment   a   prisoner   receives   in   prison   and   the\n\nconditions under which he is confined are subject to scrutiny under\n\nthe Eighth Amendment.\" Helling v. McKinney, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 113\n\nS. Ct. 2475, 2480, 125 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1993).         \"[A] prison official\n\nviolates the Eighth Amendment only when two requirements are met.\n\nFirst, the deprivation alleged must be, objectively, `sufficiently\n\nserious.'\"    Farmer v. Brennan, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 114 S. Ct. 1970,\n\n1977, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994) (quoting Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S.\n\n294, 298, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 2324, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1991)).\n\nSecond, the prison official must have acted with \"deliberate\n\nindifference.\" Id. at ___, 114 S. Ct. at 1977 (quoting Wilson, 501\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fU.S. at 302-303, 111 S. Ct. at 2326).\n\n     [A] prison official can[] be found liable under the\n     Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions\n     of confinement [if] the official knows of and disregards\n     an excessive risk to inmate health and safety; the\n     official must both be aware of facts from which the\n     inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\n     serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\n\nFarmer, ___ U.S. at ___, 114 S. Ct. at 1979.              Whether a prison\n\nofficial had the requisite knowledge \"is a question of fact subject\n\nto demonstration in the usual ways, including inferences from\n\ncircumstantial evidence, and a factfinder may conclude that a\n\nprison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that\n\nthe risk was obvious.\"     Id. at ___, 114 S. Ct. at 1981 (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n                                     A\n\n     Lacy claims that prison officials created unconstitutional\n\nconditions of confinement by allowing HIV-positive inmates to\n\nmasturbate and ejaculate in the prison dayroom, placing other\n\ninmates at risk of contracting the HIV virus.            The district court\n\ndismissed this claim on the grounds that prison administrators are\n\naccorded wide discretion in running their institutions, including\n\ndecisions   regarding    measures    taken    to    protect   inmates     from\n\ncontracting communicable diseases, unless any failure to so protect\n\ninmates represents an omission sufficiently harmful to evidence\n\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\n\n     Lacy may show that prison officials have been deliberately\n\nindifferent   to   the    risk    created    by     HIV-positive   inmates'\n\nejaculating   in   the   prison   dayroom    only   by   showing   that   the\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fofficials have been aware of the inmates' conduct and understand\n\nthat the conduct creates a substantial risk that other inmates will\n\ncontract the HIV virus.     See Farmer, ___ U.S. at ___, 114 S. Ct. at\n\n1979.    Lacy explicitly alleged in the district court that he had\n\ncomplained about the inmates' conduct to the prison officials.\n\nHowever, in order to grant relief, we must infer that the risk\n\ncreated by the inmates' alleged conduct is obvious.              See Farmer,\n\n___ U.S. at ___, 114 S. Ct. at 1981 (holding that \"a factfinder may\n\nconclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the\n\nvery fact that the risk was obvious\"). There is no allegation that\n\nany individual has contracted the HIV virus from the dayroom\n\nenvironment, nor is there any basis for believing that the conduct\n\ncomplained of, without more, creates a serious medical need for\n\nofficial intervention.      We are not prepared to hold, as a matter of\n\nlaw, that the alleged conduct creates an obvious risk that other\n\ninmates will contract the HIV virus.\n\n        In Moore v. Mabus, 976 F.2d 268 (5th Cir. 1992), in reviewing\n\nthe § 1915(d) dismissal of a similar suit, we discussed prisoner\n\ncomplaints of \"serious constitutional violations related to the\n\n`range    of   difficult,   AIDS-related       issues    that   confront   all\n\ncorrectional officials, administrators, policymakers and inmates as\n\nthey attempt     to   grapple   with    the   problems   engendered   by   the\n\npresence of HIV infection in our nation's prisons and jails.'\" Id.\n\nat 271 (quoting Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1499 (11th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f1991)).1     We acknowledged that reviewing such claims does not\n\n\"involve the mere application of well-settled principles of law,\"\n\nand reversed the district court's § 1915(d) dismissal of the AIDs-\n\nrelated claim.     Id.   However, alleging exposure to the HIV virus is\n\nnot   a    magic   incantation    that       relieves   a   litigant    from   the\n\nestablished constructs of Eighth Amendment law.                   The facts as\n\nalleged by Lacy do not implicate Eighth Amendment concerns.                    Lacy\n\nneither identifies the serious medical needs that he believes\n\nprison officials have been indifferent to, nor is the risk obvious.\n\n                                         B\n\n      Lacy also argues that prison authorities have violated the\n\nEighth Amendment by allowing inmates to expose themselves to female\n\nprison employees,        which   he   claims    will    result   in    the   female\n\nemployees' not responding to inmates' emergency calls.                 As support\n\nfor his claim, Lacy contends that female employees have already\n\nfailed to perform routine security checks in his cell block.2                  The\n\n\n      1\n             Other circuits have also recognized these difficulties. See Gates\nv. Rowland, 39 F.3d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir. 1994) (deferring to prison policy of\nexcluding HIV infected inmates from food service for several reasons, such as\neasing fears of inmates and as precaution against spreading infection when risks\nare slight or unknown); Harris, 941 F.2d at 1519-20 (noting that \"high risk\nbehavior occurs disproportionately in prison systems,\" requiring prison officials\nto establish effective infection-control policies); Muhammad v. Carlson, 845 F.2d\n175, 179 (8th Cir. 1988) (upholding constitutionality of prison policy requiring\nsegregation of HIV-infected inmates, in part because of court's \"reluctance to\nhinder prison officials' attempts to cope with the extraordinarily difficult\nproblems AIDS poses in a prison setting\"), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1068, 109 S.\nCt. 1346, 103 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1989).\n\n\n      2\n            We do not address whether the female employees' alleged failure to\nconduct security checks is violative of the Eighth Amendment, because Lacy did\nnot bring this claim in his petition. \"Although we liberally construe the briefs\nof pro se appellants, we also require that arguments must be briefed to be\npreserved.\" Yohey v. Collins, 985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir. 1993) (quoting Price\nv. Digital Equip. Corp., 846 F.2d 1026, 1028 (5th Cir. 1988)) (citations\nomitted).\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdistrict court dismissed Lacy's claim as overly speculative.\n\n      To have standing to bring his claim that prison authorities'\n\nconduct has resulted in inmate conduct that might lead to allegedly\n\nunconstitutional behavior on the part of female prison employees,\n\nLacy must show that he meets the standing requirements set forth in\n\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S. Ct.\n\n2130, 2136, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992):\n\n      First, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in\n      fact))an invasion of a legally protected interest which\n      is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or\n      imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Second, there\n      must be a causal connection between the injury and the\n      conduct complained of))the injury has to be fairly\n      traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and\n      not the result of the independent action of some third\n      party not before the court. Third, it must be likely, as\n      opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be\n      redressed by a favorable decision.\n\nAccord Ass'n for Retarded Citizens v. Dallas County Mental Health\n\n& Mental Retardation Ctr. Bd. of Trustees, 19 F.3d 241, 243 (5th\n\nCir. 1994).      Lacy fails to meet these requirements because his\n\nclaim that female prison employees will refuse to answer emergency\n\ncalls is conjectural and hypothetical.3           To the extent that it is\n\nnot, the likelihood that requiring prison guards to increase their\n\nenforcement    of   prison    regulations     against    inmates'     publicly\n\nexposing themselves will affect female employees' response to\n\n\n\n\n      3\n            In order for a claim to be ripe, the plaintiff \"must show that he\n`has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury' as\nthe result of the challenged official conduct and the injury or threat of injury\nmust be both `real and immediate,' not `conjectural' or `hypothetical.'\" City\nof Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 1665, 75 L. Ed.\n2d 675 (1983).\n\n                                      -7-\n\femergency calls is speculative at best.4                Thus, the district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in concluding that this claim has no\n\narguable basis in law.5\n\n                                       C\n\n      Finally,     Lacy   contends         that      prison    officials       created\n\nunconstitutional conditions of confinement by failing to control\n\nthe inmates' use of vulgar language and the volume at which they\n\nplay their radios and televisions. A prison condition violates the\n\nEighth   Amendment    only   if   it       is   so   serious    that    it    deprives\n\nprisoners     of   the    \"`minimal         civilized         measure    of     life's\n\nnecessities,' as when it denies the prisoner some basic human\n\nneed.\" Woods v.

Ed. 2d 556 (1984) (holding that it was overly speculative as\nto whether enforcement of Internal Revenue Service rules which prohibited tax\nbreaks to racially discriminatory private schools would prevent segregated\nschools, because withdrawal of tax breaks may not convince these private schools\nto change policies or parents to transfer their children to nonsegregated\nschools); accord National Treasury Employees Union v. Department of Treasury, 25\nF.3d 237, 241 (5th Cir. 1994); see also Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org.,\n426 U.S. 26, 43-44, 96 S. Ct. 1917, 1926-27, 48 L.

King, 900 F.2d 864, 871 (5th Cir. 1990) (characterizing\ninmate's § 1983 claim that prison officials' failure to provide toilet and hand-\nwashing facilities for inmates working in fields violated his Eighth Amendment\nrights as possibly deficient for standing purposes because it was overly\nspeculative that inmate's glaucoma condition would improve to enable him to be\nassigned field work, before remanding to district court for dismissal on other\ngrounds); Lamar v.

(holding that pro se\ninmate lacked standing to bring § 1983 claim because he could not show actual\ninjury from prison's policy of refusing to allow employees to write letters of\nrecommendation for inmates, as he did not show that prison employee would have\nactually written him a letter), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S. Ct. 641, 130\nL. Ed. 2d 546 (1994).\n\n                                        -8-\n\fHarris v. Angelina County, Tex., 31 F.3d 331, 334 (5th Cir. 1994)\n\n(quoting Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 304, 111 S. Ct. 2321,\n\n2327, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1991))).            Because Lacy has not alleged\n\nsuch a deprivation from the inmates' use of vulgar language,6 we\n\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndismissing that claim.       Lacy also alleges that the loud noise from\n\nthe radios and televisions deprived him of needed sleep, and the\n\nability to concentrate on reading materials. 7            To the extent that\n\nLacy contends that the excessive noise violates prison rules, he\n\nfails to allege a constitutional violation.                See Hernandez v.\n\nEstelle, 788 F.2d 1154, 1158 (5th Cir. 1986) (\"[T]he mere failure\n\nof   the   TDC   officials   to   follow    their    regulations\"   is   not   a\n\nconstitutional violation.).\n\n      Nor does Lacy's contention of excessive noise rise to the\n\nlevel of an Eighth Amendment violation.             Conditions of confinement\n\n\n      6\n            Lacy alleges only that a reasonable person would deem the inmates'\nuse of vulgar language to be excessive noise which creates disturbance in the\nliving area.\n      7\n            Lacy stated in his complaint that:\n\n      Inmates living near Plaintiffs are regularly permitted to play their\n      personal radios at sound levels which completely infiltrate the cell\n      of Plaintiffs, and at volume levels which can be heard into the cell\n      of Plaintiffs which is located up to 50 or 60 feet away from the\n      cell(s) in which such personal radios of inmates are located; and at\n      volume levels which a reasonable person with ordinary hearing and\n      intelligence would consider loud, raucous, and substantially in\n      excess of low volume. The television(s) located in the dayroom on\n      the cellblock in which Plaintiffs are assigned to live are\n      constantly played at a loud, raucous volume level and can be clearly\n      heard in an excessive manner into the cell of Plaintiff which is\n      located a substantial distance from the dayroom, and at a level of\n      sound which a reasonable person would consider substantially above\n      a low volume of sound. As a direct result of the institutionally-\n      violative television and radio volume levels that exist on a daily\n      basis for up to sixteen hours, Plaintiffs are deprived of needed\n      rest and sleep, deprived of the ability to concentrate on reading\n      materials.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fwhich do not lead to deprivations of essential food, medical care,\n\nor sanitation do not amount to an Eighth Amendment violation.          See\n\nRhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 348 (1981) (\"The double celling\n\nmade necessary by the unanticipated increase in prison population\n\ndid not lead to deprivations of essential food, medical care, or\n\nsanitation.\").    Lacy fails to allege any injury stemming from the\n\nexcessive noises or from any sleep deprivation.         Accordingly, we\n\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndismissing that claim. See Lunsford v. Bennett, 17 F.3d 1574, 1580\n\n(7th Cir. 1994) (a few hours of periodic loud noises that merely\n\nannoy,   rather   than   injure,   the    prisoner   does   not   state   a\n\nconstitutional claim).\n\n                                   III\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

GARZA, and PARKER, Circuit Judges.\n\nPER CURIAM:*\n\n      Antonio Lacy, an inmate of the Texas Department of Criminal\n\nJustice's Institutional Division, appeals the district court's\n\ndismissal, under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) (1988), of his pro se, in\n\nforma pauperis civil rights suit.         We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n     *\n            Local Rule 47.5.1 provides: \"The publication of opinions that have\nno precedential value and merely decide particular cases on the basis of well-\nsettled principles of law imposes needless expense on the public and burdens on\nthe legal profession.\" Pursuant to that Rule, the Court has determined that this\nopinion should not be published.\n\f                                      I\n\n     Antonio Lacy filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1988),\n\nalleging that the conditions of his confinement violate his Eighth\n\nAmendment rights. Specifically, Lacy alleges that prison officials\n\n(1) allow HIV-positive inmates to masturbate and ejaculate in the\n\nprison dayroom, contaminating the drinking fountain and other\n\nsurfaces;    (2)   allow   inmates   to    expose   themselves   to    female\n\nemployees,   potentially    discouraging     the    female   employees    from\n\nresponding to inmates' emergency calls; (3) allow inmates to use\n\nvulgar and indecent language in speaking to prison employees and\n\nother inmates; and (4) allow inmates to play televisions and radios\n\nat high volume.       In his complaint, Lacy alleged that prison\n\nofficials do not enforce prison regulations designed to prevent\n\nthese problems, despite his and other inmates' complaints.               After\n\nLacy responded to an Order for a More Definite Statement, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed Lacy's complaint as frivolous under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1915(d), concluding that all four claims had no arguable\n\nbasis in law. Lacy appeals, arguing that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in dismissing his complaint under § 1915(d).\n\n                                     II\n\n     A district court may dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint as\n\nfrivolous under § 1915(d) if it lacks an arguable basis in law or\n\nfact.

The district court\n\ndismissed this claim on the grounds that prison administrators are\n\naccorded wide discretion in running their institutions, including\n\ndecisions   regarding    measures    taken    to    protect   inmates     from\n\ncontracting communicable diseases, unless any failure to so protect\n\ninmates represents an omission sufficiently harmful to evidence\n\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\n\n     Lacy may show that prison officials have been deliberately\n\nindifferent   to   the    risk    created    by     HIV-positive   inmates'\n\nejaculating   in   the   prison   dayroom    only   by   showing   that   the\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fofficials have been aware of the inmates' conduct and understand\n\nthat the conduct creates a substantial risk that other inmates will\n\ncontract the HIV virus.

Lacy explicitly alleged in the district court that he had\n\ncomplained about the inmates' conduct to the prison officials.\n\nHowever, in order to grant relief, we must infer that the risk\n\ncreated by the inmates' alleged conduct is obvious.
