ON BRIEF: Richard Cullen, Attorney General of Vir-\nginia, Richmond, Virginia, for Appellees.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nMICHAEL, Circuit Judge:\n\nThe National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-\n5(a)(2)(B), requires states to designate as voter registration agencies\n\"all offices . . . that provide State-funded programs primarily engaged\nin providing services to persons with disabilities.\" The National\nCoalition for Students with Disabilities Education and Legal Defense\nFund (NCSD) brought this action against several Commonwealth of\nVirginia officials (collectively, Virginia or the Commonwealth) to\nforce the Commonwealth to designate as voter registration agencies\nthe offices providing services to disabled students at Virginia's public\ncolleges and universities.1 The district court granted summary judg-\nment for Virginia, holding that the NVRA does not apply to colleges.\nWe reverse because offices providing services to disabled students at\npublic colleges are \"offices\" under § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B). As a result,\nwe remand for the award of partial summary judgment to NCSD with\nrespect to particular offices at the University of Virginia (UVA) and\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech) that must be designated\nas voter registration agencies. Further proceedings with respect to\nother public colleges will also be necessary on remand.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 After this we will use \"colleges\" for colleges and universities.\n\n                     2\n\fI.\n\nA.\n\nCongress passed the NVRA -- dubbed the \"Motor Voter Law\" --\nto encourage increased voter registration for elections involving fed-\neral offices. See 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg(b)(1). The Act adopts procedures\ndesigned to make it easier to register to vote, and it requires the states\nto put these procedures into place. Specifically, states must (1)\ninclude a voter registration application as part of the application or\nrenewal form for a motor vehicle driver's license, (2) allow mail\napplication for voter registration, and (3) designate various offices as\n\"voter registration agencies\" where application for registration may be\nmade in person. See id. §§ 1973gg-2, -5(a).\n\nThis case involves aspects of the third requirement. Under this\nrequirement each state must designate the following offices as voter\nregistration agencies: (1) \"all offices in the State that provide public\nassistance\" and (2) \"all offices in the State that provide State-funded\nprograms primarily engaged in providing services to persons with dis-\nabilities.\" Id. § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(A)-(B). A state must also designate\nother offices, but it has latitude in deciding exactly which ones. The\nAct suggests that government offices such as public schools and\nlibraries, marriage license bureaus in clerks' offices, fishing and hunt-\ning license bureaus, and revenue offices may be included in the dis-\ncretionary designation. See id. § 1973gg-5(a)(3)(B).\n\nIt goes without saying that the offices designated as voter registra-\ntion agencies under the NVRA were originally created to provide ser-\nvice or assistance wholly apart from voter registration. The Act\nrequires a designated office to provide certain voter registration ser-\nvices to persons who request the service or assistance customarily\nprovided by that office. These voter registration services include dis-\ntribution of voter registration application forms and another form that\nincludes, among other things, the question, \"[i]f you are not registered\nto vote where you live now, would you like to apply to register to\nvote here today?\" See id. § 1973gg-5(a)(6)(A)-(B). Offices designated\nas voter registration agencies must also offer to assist applicants in\ncompleting voter registration forms and accept completed forms for\n\n                     3\n\ftransmittal to the appropriate state election official. See id. § 1973gg-\n5(a)(4)(A).\n\nB.\n\nNCSD is an organization headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia, whose\ngeneral purpose is to advance the educational opportunities and rights\nof students with disabilities. NCSD is currently working to encourage\ncollege students with disabilities to register to vote. Many disabled\nstudents do not drive or otherwise have difficulty traveling. In addi-\ntion, many of these students need assistance in completing voter reg-\nistration forms because of blindness or motor or muscular\ndysfunction. Thus, NCSD alleges that a voter registration site on col-\nlege campuses would permit many more disabled students to register.\nAnd, NCSD contends that the NVRA requires states to designate dis-\nability services offices at state-funded colleges as voter registration\nagencies.\n\nOn July 10, 1996, a visually impaired member of NCSD went to\nthe campus of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, to\n\"look[ ] into acceptance to\" that school. Among the offices she visited\nat George Mason was the Office of Disability Support Services,\nwhere she asked what assistance that office provided to students with\ndisabilities. In response to a specific question about voter registration,\nshe was told that the office did not provide voter registration services.\n\nOn July 17, 1996, NCSD sent a written complaint to the Virginia\nState Board of Elections, alleging that the Commonwealth was in vio-\nlation of the NVRA by failing to provide voter registration services\nin disabled student services offices in public colleges.2 After the\nBoard took no action on this complaint, NCSD sued the Common-\nwealth in the Eastern District of Virginia, asserting an NVRA claim\nas well as claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\nand several provisions of the United States Constitution. NCSD\nsought, among other relief, a declaration that Virginia was in violation\nof the NVRA and an injunction requiring the Commonwealth to pro-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2 Before suing for declaratory or injunctive relief under the Act, a per-\nson must (in most cases) give the state's chief election official prior writ-\nten notice of the alleged violation. See 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-9(b).\n\n                     4\n\fvide voter registration services in college offices providing services\nto students with disabilities.\n\nIn the course of discovery and motion practice in this case Virginia\nprovided undisputed facts about how the Commonwealth's institu-\ntions of higher education provide services to students with disabilities.\nTo begin with, every public college in Virginia has an \"office, section\nor department\" that provides services for disabled students. These\noffices provide assistance \"geared toward ensuring that qualified stu-\ndents with disabilities are receiving adequate access to the educational\nprograms and activities\" at their schools. None of these offices, how-\never, provides voter registration services.\n\nMore specific information was provided about three public col-\nleges, George Mason University, UVA, and Virginia Tech. George\nMason has a Disability Support Services Office (DSS) which is the\nonly office at George Mason that offers services\"specifically directed\nto students with disabilities.\" Operation of the DSS office at George\nMason is funded by student activity fees. At UVA disabled student\nservices are provided through the Office of the Vice President of Stu-\ndent Affairs. At Virginia Tech these services are provided by the\nOffice of the Dean of Students. UVA and Virginia Tech fund these\noffices from appropriations made by the General Assembly for\n\"Higher Education Student Services.\"3\n\nVirginia moved for summary judgment on November 25, 1996, and\nNCSD cross-moved for partial summary judgment on January 13,\n1977. The Commonwealth argued that \"offices\" under § 1973gg-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 A visit to the Internet reveals additional information about disabled\nstudents services available at UVA. UVA advertises a Learning Needs\nand Evaluation Center that provides \"numerous non-medical services to\nstudents with disabilities,\" including education counseling. See Univer-\nsity of Virginia, Guide to the University of Virginia for Students with\nDisabilities (visited June 30, 1998) http://www.uva.edu~vpsa/ada-\nstd.html>. This center appears to operate separately from the Office of\nthe Vice President of Student Affairs, the only UVA office the Common-\nwealth disclosed in this case. See id. Our decision, of course, must be\nbased on the record developed in district court. See United States v.\nRussell, 971 F.2d 1098, 1112 (4th Cir. 1992).\n\n                    5\n\f5(a)(2)(B) of the NVRA are only those state agencies created by the\nlegislature and funded by specific appropriation for the primary pur-\npose of providing assistance to the disabled. Because colleges as a\nwhole are not primarily engaged in that endeavor, they are not\n\"offices\" under the Act, according to Virginia. Finally, Virginia\nargued that particular college offices serving disabled students are not\n\"offices\" under the NVRA because these offices are not created by the\nlegislature or funded by an appropriation dedicated specifically for\nservices to disabled students.4\n\nNCSD based its cross-motion on three main grounds. First, it\npointed out that it was not contending that entire colleges should be\ndesignated as voter registration agencies. Rather, it said that disability\nservices offices in colleges were \"offices\" under the Act. These smal-\nler offices had to be designated as voter registration agencies, accord-\ning to NCSD, because they were offering \"programs primarily\nengaged in providing services\" to disabled students. Second, it argued\nthat the ADA requires colleges to provide convenient and accessible\nvoter registration sites for disabled students. Third, NCSD went\nbeyond its complaint and argued that the ADA requires Virginia to\nprovide braille and large print voter registration applications for per-\nsons who are visually impaired. This third argument was apparently\nbased on Lightbourn v. El Paso, 904 F. Supp. 1429, 1433-34 (W.D.\nTex. 1995) (holding that Texas Secretary of State had duty to make\nsure local election authorities complied with ADA in providing\naccommodations to allow visually impaired persons to vote in secret),\na decision that was reversed on appeal to the Fifth Circuit, see\nLightbourn v. El Paso, 118 F.3d 421 (5th Cir. 1997), cert. denied sub\nnom. Lightbourn v. Garza, 118 S. Ct. 700 (1998).\n\nThe district court granted Virginia's motion for summary judgment\nand denied NCSD's cross-motion. In addressing the NVRA, the court\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4 A few state government departments that serve the disabled have been\ndesignated by Virginia as voter registration agencies. They are the Vir-\nginia Department of Rehabilitative Services, the Department for Rights\nof Virginians with Disabilities, the Virginia Department for the Deaf and\nHard of Hearing, the Virginia Department for the Visually Handicapped,\nthe Virginia Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Sub-\nstance Abuse Services, and the Virginia Department of Social Services.\n\n                     6\n\fheld that Congress did not intend for the Act to apply to state colleges\nbecause these institutions are not primarily engaged in serving dis-\nabled persons. The court also rejected NCSD's claim that the ADA\nrequires a voter registration site for disabled students on college cam-\npuses. Finally, the court said that NCSD did not state a claim under\nthe Constitution. NCSD appeals the district court's ruling on its\nNVRA claim and also seeks to have us consider its claim that the\nADA requires voter registration application forms in braille and large\nprint. The district court did not address the braille/large print claim,\npresumably because the claim was not asserted in the complaint or in\nany motion to amend. Because the braille/large print claim was not\nproperly raised in district court, we will not consider it here. See\nKrouse v. American Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 499 n.1 (3d Cir.\n1997). We move, then, to the one claim that NCSD preserved for\nappeal, the NVRA claim.\n\nII.\n\nThe NVRA requires that states designate as voter registration agen-\ncies \"all offices in the State that provide State-funded programs pri-\nmarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.\" 42\nU.S.C. § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B).\n\nVirginia concedes that at each of its public colleges there is an\noffice, section, or department that provides services to disabled stu-\ndents to ensure them adequate access to educational programs and\nother activities. Virginia also concedes that these offices at UVA and\nVirginia Tech are funded by a line item appropriation made by the\nGeneral Assembly for \"Higher Education Student Services.\" As a\nresult, it cannot be disputed that the offices assisting disabled students\nat UVA and Virginia Tech fit a key portion of the controlling statu-\ntory language: they \"provide State-funded programs primarily\nengaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.\" Id.\n§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B).5 The focus of the dispute on appeal is therefore\nwhether the offices providing these programs at UVA and Virginia\nTech are \"offices\" under the NVRA.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5 We cannot say whether the DSS office at George Mason meets the\n\"State-funded\" requirement. See part III, infra.\n\n                    7\n\fNCSD argues that an \"office\" is a subdivision of a government\ndepartment or institution. This argument is based on the definition of\nthe term \"office\" found in several leading dictionaries. NCSD argues\nthat since an office providing services for disabled students in a pub-\nlic college is a subdivision of the college, it should be considered an\n\"office\" for purposes of the NVRA. Virginia disagrees, arguing that\nthe term \"office\" refers to a government agency as a whole and not\nto offices that are subdivisions of an agency. Only a government\nagency created by state statute could be an \"office\" under Virginia's\ninterpretation. Virginia's public colleges are public institutions cre-\nated by statute. See generally Va. Code Ann. tit. 23. Thus, Virginia\nsuggests that a public college as a whole would be an \"office\" in the\nNVRA sense, but an office serving the disabled within that college\ncould not be an NVRA \"office\" because it is merely a subdivision of\nthe college that is not designated by statute or specific appropriation.6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6 Although Virginia argues that its public colleges are \"offices,\" the\nCommonwealth concludes that they do not have to be designated as voter\nregistration agencies because a college as a whole is not primarily\nengaged in serving the disabled. Virginia's argument about the meaning\nof \"office\" thus proceeds on the assumption that in order to be designated\nas a voter registration agency under § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B), an office (as a\nwhole) must be primarily engaged in serving the disabled. The statutory\nlanguage does not permit this assumption. Again, § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B)\ndesignates \"all offices in the State that provide State-funded programs\nprimarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.\"\n\"Primarily engaged\" modifies \"programs\" under the most natural reading\nof this provision. This reading is also mandated by the fundamental\ncanon of statutory construction that a qualifying phrase refers solely to\nits immediate antecedent. See 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction\n§ 47.33 (5th ed. 1992). Absent an expression of contrary congressional\nintent, the failure to apply this canon \"flies in the face of common sense\nin grammar hardened into law.\" United States ex rel. Santarelli v.\nHughes, 116 F.2d 613, 616 (3d Cir. 1940). Here, the antecedent immedi-\nately preceding \"primarily engaged\" is \"programs.\" There is nothing in\nthe statute or legislative history to suggest that\"primarily engaged\" does\nnot modify \"programs.\" Accordingly, an office may qualify as a voter\nregistration agency if it provides programs primarily engaged in serving\nthe disabled, even if the office as a whole is not primarily engaged in\nserving the disabled.\n\n                    8\n\fWe conclude that § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B), read in light of the estab-\nlished rules of statutory construction, requires states to designate as\nvoter registration agencies those state-funded offices that provide ser-\nvices to disabled students at public colleges.\n\nA.\n\nCourts must apply the plain language of a statute except in the rare\ncircumstance when there is a clearly expressed legislative intent to the\ncontrary or when a literal application would frustrate the statute's pur-\npose or lead to an absurd result. See In re Vial, 115 F.3d 1192, 1196\n(4th Cir. 1997) (en banc). \"In interpreting statutory language, words\nare generally given their common and ordinary meaning.\" Alexander\nS. v. Boyd, 113 F.3d 1373, 1383 (4th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted); see\nalso Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 228 (1993) (\"When a word\nis not defined by statute, we normally construe it in accord with its\nordinary or natural meaning\"). We decide whether particular statutory\nlanguage is plain by considering \"the language itself, the specific con-\ntext in which that language is used, and the broader context of the\nstatute as a whole.\" Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 117 S. Ct. 843, 846\n(1997) (citations omitted); accord United States v. Wildes, 120 F.3d\n468, 469-70 (4th Cir. 1997), cert. denied sub nom. Cameron v. United\nStates, 118 S. Ct. 885 (1998).\n\n1.\n\nWe begin with the language itself, that is, the term \"offices\" in\n§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B), which specifies \"all offices in the State that pro-\nvide State-funded programs primarily engaged in providing services\nto persons with disabilities.\" (Emphasis added.) We customarily turn\nto dictionaries for help in determining whether a word in a statute has\na plain or common meaning. See, e.g., United States v. Harris, 128\nF.3d 850, 854 (4th Cir. 1997) (using Black's Law Dictionary to deter-\nmine plain meaning of \"similar\"); In re A.H. Robins Co., 109 F.3d\n965, 967-68 (4th Cir. 1997) (using Webster's Dictionary for \"there-\nfore\").\n\nWebster's defines the term \"office\" in a governmental context as\n\"a subdivision of a governmental department.\" See Webster's II New\nRiverside University Dictionary 816 (1988). Other dictionaries are in\n\n                    9\n\faccord with this definition of \"office.\" See, e.g., Webster's III New\nInternational Dictionary 1567 (1981) (\"a branch or subdivision of\ngovernmental administration that ranks (in the national government)\nbelow the department\"); Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 1844 (2d ed. 1987) (\"an operating agency or division of\ncertain departments of the U.S. Government: Office of Community\nServices\"); cf. Black's Law Dictionary 1083 (6th ed. 1990) (\"[a] place\nfor the regular transaction of business or performance of a particular\nservice\"). This definition means that an office within a government\ndepartment is a \"subdivision\" of that department. From this, NCSD\npersuasively argues that a public college created by the state is a state\ndepartment or institution. A public college is therefore not an \"office\"\nunder the NVRA because as a stand-alone department or institution,\nit could not be a \"subdivision\" of itself. NCSD concludes its applica-\ntion of the definition by arguing that a college office serving the dis-\nabled is a \"subdivision\" of the college and, hence, an \"office\" under\nthe Act.\n\nBy contrast, Virginia argues that the term \"office\" in § 1973gg-5\nmeans only a government department as a whole that is created\ndirectly by the state legislature; constituent subdivisions of a depart-\nment do not count. Under Virginia's interpretation public colleges are\nthemselves the \"offices\" referred to in the section. Virginia provides\nno textual support for this interpretation, however. In fact, the only\nsupport for Virginia's argument comes not from American but from\nBritish usage of the term \"office.\" See, e.g., Random House, supra,\nat 1844 (\"Brit. a major administrative unit or department of the\nnational government: the Foreign Office.\" (emphasis in original));\nWebster's III, supra, at 1567 (\"Brit: a principal branch or division of\ngovernmental administration: DEPARTMENT\" (emphasis in origi-\nnal)). Were we interpreting a statute of British origin, this definition\nmight be sufficient to create an ambiguity of meaning.\n\nIn this case, however, we are interpreting a statute enacted by the\nUnited States Congress, with the constituent states of the Union as the\nintended audience. The fact that an alternative definition exists in the\nEnglish language is not enough to create ambiguity.\"[T]he plain,\nobvious and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to\nany curious, narrow, hidden sense that nothing but the exigency of a\nhard case and the ingenuity and study of an acute and powerful intel-\n\n                     10\n\flect would discover.\" Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens Co., 267 U.S. 364,\n370 (1925) (Sutherland, J.) (quotations omitted). We believe that\nwhen the alternative definition of a term derives chiefly from usage\noutside the United States, the foreign usage will not blur an otherwise\nplain meaning of the term in one of our statutes, unless there is clear\nevidence that Congress intended to adopt the foreign definition. Cf.\nMCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Tel. & Tele. Co., 512\nU.S. 218, 228 & n.3 (1995) (rejecting aberrant definition of \"modify\"\nwhen weight of common American usage dictates otherwise). There\nis no evidence that Congress intended to use \"office\" in the NVRA\nin the British (department of government) sense.\n\nWhen we focus on what the term \"office\" means insofar as govern-\nment structure is concerned, respected dictionaries tell us that in com-\nmon American usage the term means a subdivision of a government\ndepartment or institution. Virginia acknowledges that every one of its\npublic colleges has \"an office, section or department\" providing ser-\nvices to disabled students. Virginia does not dispute that these offices\nare subdivisions of the colleges. Accordingly, the dictionary defini-\ntion of the term \"office\" (a subdivision of a government department)\nsupports the proposition that offices providing disability services in\npublic colleges are \"offices\" under the NVRA.\n\n2.\n\nIn looking for the plain meaning of a statutory term, we also refer\nto the specific context (usually the subsection) in which the term is\nused. See e.g., Robinson, 117 S. Ct. at 846-47; Wildes, 120 F.3d at\n740. The context in which a term is used often determines how\nbroadly or narrowly the term is to be defined. And, when \"Congress\nemploy[s] broad language\" in drafting a statute, we \"are not free to\ndisregard\" it. Wildes, 120 F.3d at 740.\n\nThe term \"offices\" in the provision at issue appears in the following\ncontext: \"all offices in the State that provide State-funded programs\nprimarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.\"\n§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Virginia can point to nothing\nin this language that can be read to construe \"office\" to refer to an\nentire government department or institution, such as a college, created\ndirectly by the legislature. Nor can Virginia claim, once specific con-\n\n                    11\n\ftext is taken into account, that college offices providing programs for\nthe disabled are not \"offices\" under the provision. Indeed, the use of\nthe word \"all\" to modify \"offices\" suggests an expansive meaning\nbecause \"all\" is a term of great breadth. See Wildes, 120 F.2d at 740.\nThe addition of the broad, inclusive word \"all\" in the specific context\n(§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B)) in which the term \"offices\" is used also sup-\nports the conclusion that an office providing programs for the dis-\nabled in a public college is an \"office\" under the Act.\n\n3.\n\nNext, we must consider what \"offices\" means in the context of the\nstatute as a whole. See Robinson, 117 S. Ct. at 846-47; Wildes, 120\nF.3d at 740. The word \"offices\" is used in other provisions, § 1973gg-\n5(a)(2)(A) & (3)(B), which are interrelated with and in close proxim-\nity to § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B), the provision we are studying today. We\nthus have the \"classic case for application of the normal rule of statu-\ntory construction that identical words used in different parts of the\nsame act are intended to have the same meaning.\" See Commissioner\nv. Lundy, 516 U.S. 235, 250 (1996)(citations and internal quotations\nomitted).\n\nTo provide adequate voter registration opportunities to citizens\nwho may not apply for or renew driver's licenses, Congress requires\nstates to designate a number of \"offices\" as voter registration offices.\nSee generally § 1973gg-5. A state must designate \"all offices\" that\nprovide public assistance, see id. § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(A), and \"all\noffices\" \"that provide State-funded programs primarily engaged\" in\nserving the disabled, id. § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B). In addition to these spe-\ncific offices that must be designated as voter registration agencies, a\nstate must also designate \"other offices,\" see id. § 1973gg-5(a)(3)(A).\nAlthough a state has discretion in choosing the additional offices for\ndesignation, paragraph (3)(B) lists offices that may be included in the\ndiscretionary designation. See id. § 1973gg-5(a)(3)(B). Thus, para-\ngraph (3)(B), like paragraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B) just above it,\ndescribes \"offices\" that are suitable, in Congress's judgment, as voter\nregistration agencies.\n\nAmong the \"offices\" suggested in paragraph (3)(B) for designation\nare \"public libraries, public schools, offices of city and county clerks\n\n                     12\n\f(including marriage license bureaus), fishing and hunting license\nbureaus, government revenue offices, [and] unemployment compen-\nsation offices.\" Id. § 1973gg-5(3)(B). Congress is not describing over-\nall government departments here; it is describing subdivisions of\ndepartments. Thus, a marriage license bureau is a subdivision of a\nclerk's office, a hunting license bureau is a subdivision of a state\ngame and wildlife department, a revenue office is a subdivision of a\nstate tax department, an unemployment compensation office is a sub-\ndivision of a state department of employment security, and so on.\nCongress's focus in paragraph (3)(B) is on the small offices or loca-\ntions where citizens conduct their daily business with government.\nBecause of the high volume of citizen traffic in these offices, they are\nideal as voter registration agencies.\n\nVirginia argues that in paragraph (2)(B), relating to \"offices\" serv-\ning the disabled, Congress used \"offices\" to mean overall governmen-\ntal departments. Thus, according to Virginia, \"offices\" providing\n\"programs primarily engaged in providing services\" to the disabled\nwould only include the half-dozen major state departments serving\nthe disabled, such as the Virginia Department of Rehabilitative Ser-\nvices. However, when paragraph (2)(B) is read in context with para-\ngraphs (2)(A) (offices providing public assistance) and (3)(B)\n(various local offices), it appears that Congress in all three places\nused \"offices\" in the same (smaller) sense. In other words, Congress\nwanted to make voter registration services available in community-\nbased offices that citizens visit frequently for services or assistance.\nThis purpose applies especially to the disabled, many of whom do not\ndrive or have difficulty in traveling.\n\nWhen we consider what the word \"office\" means in the broader\ncontext of the NVRA as a whole, it does not stand for a government\ndepartment but it is a subdivision of a department where citizens reg-\nularly go for service and assistance. Under this meaning, a college\noffice serving disabled students would be an \"office\" under the spe-\ncific paragraph, § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B), we are considering.\n\nB.\n\nWe have just said that the plain meaning of the term\"offices\" in\n§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) includes an office providing services to disabled\n\n                    13\n\fstudents in a public college. This plain meaning cannot be circum-\nvented unless we have the rare instance when there is a clearly\nexpressed congressional intent to the contrary or when a literal appli-\ncation of the plain language would frustrate the statute's purpose or\nlead to an absurd result. See In re Vial, 115 F.3d 1192, 1196 (4th Cir.\n1997) (en banc). Virginia does not argue that use of the plain meaning\nof \"offices\" would frustrate the purposes of the NVRA or lead to an\nabsurd result. However, Virginia did cite legislative history to the dis-\ntrict court to argue that Congress did not intend for the NVRA to\nreach state-supported colleges.\n\nThe district court held that the language of § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B)\ndoes not apply to state colleges because they are not primarily\nengaged in serving the disabled. The court then adopted Virginia's\nlegislative history argument to bolster this holding. The court cited a\nparagraph from the legislative history indicating that the Act's cover-\nage includes agencies providing \"education counseling\" to the dis-\nabled. From this, the court said that Congress \"intended that the act\napply to state institutions providing `education counseling' and not to\nthose agencies [that is, colleges] providing educational services.\"\nNational Coalition For Students with Disabilities Educ. and Legal\nDefense Fund v. Allen, 961 F. Supp. 129, 131 (E.D. Va. 1997)\n(emphasis added).7 The district court added that state colleges are not\nmentioned in the legislative history. See id.\n\nThis is an inappropriate use of legislative history. Because the plain\nmeaning of \"offices\" includes an office in a college serving the dis-\nabled, the NVRA's legislative history is irrelevant unless it proves\nthat this meaning of the statutory term violates congressional intent.\nWe have read the legislative history, and nothing in it reveals that\nusing the plain meaning of \"offices\" would violate congressional\nintent.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7 The undisputed facts in this case do not support the district court's\nreliance on legislative history. By Virginia's own admission it appears\nthat public college offices serving disabled students provide \"education\ncounseling\" to those students. According to the legislative history, there-\nfore, these particular college offices would be covered by the Act.\n\n                    14\n\fWe backtrack for a moment to the opening language of the NVRA,\nwhich makes its purpose clear: \"to establish procedures that will\nincrease the number of eligible citizens who register to vote.\"\n§ 1973gg(b)(1). The centerpiece of the Act is the motor voter section,\nproviding for the simultaneous application for a driver's license and\nvoter registration. See id. § 1973gg-3. But Congress recognized that\nmany citizens do not drive. To accommodate the non-drivers among\nus and to provide greater opportunity for registration in general, Con-\ngress requires states to designate a number of offices -- offices that\nare not part of state motor vehicle departments -- as voter registration\nagencies. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that state college\noffices serving the disabled are not \"offices\" to be designated as voter\nregistration agencies.\n\nAccording to the House Report, the office designation section of\nthe Act is designed to \"supplement the motor-voter provisions of the\nbill by reaching out to those citizens who are likely not to benefit\nfrom the State motor-voter application provisions.\" H.R. Rep. No.\n103-9, at 12 (1993), reprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 105, 116.\nOffices serving the disabled and recipients of public assistance were\nidentified as the offices \"most likely to serve the person of voting age\nwho may not have driver licenses.\" Id. By requiring states to desig-\nnate these offices as voter registration agencies, \"we will be assured\nthat almost all of our citizens will come into contact with an office\nat which they may apply to register to vote with the same convenience\nas will be available to most other people under the motor voter pro-\ngram of this Act.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-66, at 19 (1993),\nreprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 140, 144; see also id. (\"If a State\ndoes not include . . . public assistance [offices and] agencies serving\npersons with disabilities . . . it will exclude a segment of its popula-\ntion from those for whom registration will be convenient and readily\navailable -- the poor and persons with disabilities who do not have\ndriver's licenses and will not come into contact with the other princi-\nple [sic] place to register under this Act\").\n\nThe above passages from the legislative history are representative.\nCongress did not in any way express an intent to exclude offices serv-\ning the disabled in public colleges from the term \"offices\" in\n§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) of the NVRA.\n\n                    15\n\fC.\n\nIn sum, the dictionary defines \"office\" as a subdivision of a govern-\nment department or institution. The specific context in which the term\n\"office\" is used in § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) and the use of the term else-\nwhere in the Act reinforce this dictionary definition. Nothing in the\nlegislative history reveals that Congress intended for a different defi-\nnition to apply. Accordingly, we hold that the plain meaning of the\nterm \"offices\" in § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) includes an office providing\nservices to disabled students at a public college. Such an office, as a\nsubdivision of the college, fits the plain meaning of \"office.\"8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8 Virginia has indicated that under this interpretation an office that pro-\nvides programs primarily serving the disabled could be designated as a\nvoter registration agency even though the office also provides other pro-\ngrams not aimed at serving the disabled. See n.6, supra. The Common-\nwealth has in mind the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs\nat UVA and the Office of the Dean of Students at Virginia Tech. How-\never, the fact that such an office is designated as a voter registration\nagency does not mean that it must provide voter registration services to\nall patrons, including those without disabilities. Rather, only those per-\nsons seeking the benefits of the programs primarily serving the disabled\nwould be entitled to voter registration services.\n\nIt is true that the NVRA states that \"[a] voter registration agency that\nis an office that provides service or assistance in addition to voter regis-\ntration shall . . . distribute [the voter registration application forms, etc.]\nwith each application for such service or assistance, and with each recer-\ntification, renewal, or change of address form relating to such service or\nassistance.\" § 1973gg-5(a)(6). Read literally, this could require a multi-\npurpose office, designated as a voter registration agency because its\nfunctions include offering programs primarily serving the disabled, to\noffer voter registration services to all patrons, disabled and non-disabled\nalike. This would be an absurd result, however, given the NVRA's care-\nfully structured program to promote registration.\n\nA study showed that about 90 percent of the population 18 years and\nolder had driver's licenses, so Congress believed that a vast majority of\ncitizens would have improved access to voter registration through the\nmotor voter provision. See H.R. Rep. No. 103-9, at 4-5 (1993), reprinted\nin 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 105, 108-09. Recognizing that many disabled per-\nsons do not drive and would therefore miss the opportunity to register\nunder the motor voter program, Congress added § 1973gg-5(2)(B)\n\n                     16\n\fIII.\n\nOur final piece of business is the disposition required in light of our\nanalysis. Because we have held that the term \"offices\" in 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) includes public college offices with programs\nserving the disabled, we reverse the district court's order awarding\nsummary judgment to Virginia.\n\nNCSD asserts that the district court erred in denying its motion for\npartial summary judgment. Although an order denying summary\njudgment is not independently appealable, we may review such an\norder when it is appealed along with an order granting a cross-motion\nfor summary judgment. See Monahan v. County of Chesterfield, 95\nF.3d 1263, 1265 (4th Cir. 1996). When the facts are uncontroverted,\nwe are free to direct the entry of an order awarding summary judg-\nment to the party whose motion was denied. See id.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Office of the Vice President of Student\nAffairs at UVA and the Office of the Dean of Students at Virginia\nTech offer \"programs primarily engaged in providing services to\" dis-\nabled students. It is also undisputed that these programs are \"State-\nfunded\" by the Commonwealth through the \"Higher Education Stu-\ndent Services\" appropriation made by the General Assembly. Virginia\ndoes not suggest any issue of material fact that would preclude sum-\nmary judgment regarding these two institutions. See Appellee's Br. at\n4 (\"There [a]re no disputed issues of material fact\"). Accordingly, on\nremand the district court is to grant partial summary judgment for\nNCSD, declaring that the Office of the Vice President of Student\nAffairs at the University of Virginia and the Office of the Dean of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n(requiring designation of offices with \"programs primarily engaged\" in\nserving the disabled) solely to target the disabled portion of the popula-\ntion. Because § 1973gg-5(2)(B) was enacted only to cover the disabled,\nwe believe that an office designated as a voter registration agency under\nthat section is required to provide voter registration services just to those\nof its patrons who are disabled. Accordingly, while an office, such as a\ndean of students office, that serves both disabled and non-disabled stu-\ndents may qualify for designation under § 1973gg-5(2)(B), only the dis-\nabled will be entitled to voter registration services.\n\n                     17\n\fStudents at Virginia Polytechnic Institute qualify for designation as\nvoter registration agencies under § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B).\n\nWe are not in a position to order any relief with respect to the DSS\noffice at George Mason University. The DSS office is an \"office\" for\nNVRA purposes because its function is to assist disabled students. It\nis not clear, however, whether the office is state funded because it is\nfinanced with student activity fees and not appropriated funds. Stu-\ndent activity fees may be considered a source of state funding if the\nmonies generated by those fees are controlled by the college. See,\ne.g., Student Gov't Assoc. v. Board of Trustees of the Univ. of Mass.,\n868 F.2d 473, 478 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding that student activity fees\ncollected under authority of state law and disbursed at direction of\nboard of trustees are university funds). If, however, the fees are not\nsubject to university control and are segregated from other university\nfunds, they may not be considered as state funds. Cf. Schiff v.\nWilliams, 519 F.2d 257, 262 & n.2 (5th Cir. 1975) (holding student\nactivity fees not to be state funds when they were segregated from\nuniversity funds and the state treasury); cf. also Rosenberger v. Rector\nand Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 851-52 (1995)\n(O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting that student activity fees adminis-\ntered by students and kept separate from state treasury are not govern-\nment resources). Both the record and Virginia law are silent as to how\nstudent activities fees are collected, maintained, or disbursed at\nGeorge Mason University. When the factual record is insufficient on\na threshold question, we must remand to the district court for further\nproceedings. See Shao v. Link Cargo (Taiwan) Ltd., 986 F.2d 700,\n703-04 (4th Cir. 1993). On remand the district court will determine\nthe sources, nature, and handling of funding for the programs offered\nby the DSS office at George Mason University.\n\nNCSD should also be given the opportunity on remand to establish,\nif it can, that there are offices serving disabled students in other public\ncolleges in Virginia that should be designated as voter registration\nagencies.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS\n\n                     18\n\f",

ON BRIEF: Richard Cullen, Attorney General of Vir-\nginia, Richmond, Virginia, for Appellees.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nMICHAEL, Circuit Judge:\n\nThe National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-\n5(a)(2)(B), requires states to designate as voter registration agencies\n\"all offices . . . that provide State-funded programs primarily engaged\nin providing services to persons with disabilities.\" The National\nCoalition for Students with Disabilities Education and Legal Defense\nFund (NCSD) brought this action against several Commonwealth of\nVirginia officials (collectively, Virginia or the Commonwealth) to\nforce the Commonwealth to designate as voter registration agencies\nthe offices providing services to disabled students at Virginia's public\ncolleges and universities.1 The district court granted summary judg-\nment for Virginia, holding that the NVRA does not apply to colleges.\nWe reverse because offices providing services to disabled students at\npublic colleges are \"offices\" under § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B). As a result,\nwe remand for the award of partial summary judgment to NCSD with\nrespect to particular offices at the University of Virginia (UVA) and\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech) that must be designated\nas voter registration agencies. Further proceedings with respect to\nother public colleges will also be necessary on remand.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 After this we will use \"colleges\" for colleges and universities.\n\n                     2\n\fI.\n\nA.\n\nCongress passed the NVRA -- dubbed the \"Motor Voter Law\" --\nto encourage increased voter registration for elections involving fed-\neral offices. See 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg(b)(1). The Act adopts procedures\ndesigned to make it easier to register to vote, and it requires the states\nto put these procedures into place. Specifically, states must (1)\ninclude a voter registration application as part of the application or\nrenewal form for a motor vehicle driver's license, (2) allow mail\napplication for voter registration, and (3) designate various offices as\n\"voter registration agencies\" where application for registration may be\nmade in person. See id. §§ 1973gg-2, -5(a).\n\nThis case involves aspects of the third requirement. Under this\nrequirement each state must designate the following offices as voter\nregistration agencies: (1) \"all offices in the State that provide public\nassistance\" and (2) \"all offices in the State that provide State-funded\nprograms primarily engaged in providing services to persons with dis-\nabilities.\" Id. § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(A)-(B). A state must also designate\nother offices, but it has latitude in deciding exactly which ones. The\nAct suggests that government offices such as public schools and\nlibraries, marriage license bureaus in clerks' offices, fishing and hunt-\ning license bureaus, and revenue offices may be included in the dis-\ncretionary designation. See id. § 1973gg-5(a)(3)(B).\n\nIt goes without saying that the offices designated as voter registra-\ntion agencies under the NVRA were originally created to provide ser-\nvice or assistance wholly apart from voter registration. The Act\nrequires a designated office to provide certain voter registration ser-\nvices to persons who request the service or assistance customarily\nprovided by that office. These voter registration services include dis-\ntribution of voter registration application forms and another form that\nincludes, among other things, the question, \"[i]f you are not registered\nto vote where you live now, would you like to apply to register to\nvote here today?\" See id. § 1973gg-5(a)(6)(A)-(B). Offices designated\nas voter registration agencies must also offer to assist applicants in\ncompleting voter registration forms and accept completed forms for\n\n                     3\n\ftransmittal to the appropriate state election official. See id. § 1973gg-\n5(a)(4)(A).\n\nB.\n\nNCSD is an organization headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia, whose\ngeneral purpose is to advance the educational opportunities and rights\nof students with disabilities. NCSD is currently working to encourage\ncollege students with disabilities to register to vote. Many disabled\nstudents do not drive or otherwise have difficulty traveling. In addi-\ntion, many of these students need assistance in completing voter reg-\nistration forms because of blindness or motor or muscular\ndysfunction. Thus, NCSD alleges that a voter registration site on col-\nlege campuses would permit many more disabled students to register.\nAnd, NCSD contends that the NVRA requires states to designate dis-\nability services offices at state-funded colleges as voter registration\nagencies.\n\nOn July 10, 1996, a visually impaired member of NCSD went to\nthe campus of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, to\n\"look[ ] into acceptance to\" that school. Among the offices she visited\nat George Mason was the Office of Disability Support Services,\nwhere she asked what assistance that office provided to students with\ndisabilities. In response to a specific question about voter registration,\nshe was told that the office did not provide voter registration services.\n\nOn July 17, 1996, NCSD sent a written complaint to the Virginia\nState Board of Elections, alleging that the Commonwealth was in vio-\nlation of the NVRA by failing to provide voter registration services\nin disabled student services offices in public colleges.2 After the\nBoard took no action on this complaint, NCSD sued the Common-\nwealth in the Eastern District of Virginia, asserting an NVRA claim\nas well as claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\nand several provisions of the United States Constitution. NCSD\nsought, among other relief, a declaration that Virginia was in violation\nof the NVRA and an injunction requiring the Commonwealth to pro-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2 Before suing for declaratory or injunctive relief under the Act, a per-\nson must (in most cases) give the state's chief election official prior writ-\nten notice of the alleged violation. See 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-9(b).\n\n                     4\n\fvide voter registration services in college offices providing services\nto students with disabilities.\n\nIn the course of discovery and motion practice in this case Virginia\nprovided undisputed facts about how the Commonwealth's institu-\ntions of higher education provide services to students with disabilities.\nTo begin with, every public college in Virginia has an \"office, section\nor department\" that provides services for disabled students. These\noffices provide assistance \"geared toward ensuring that qualified stu-\ndents with disabilities are receiving adequate access to the educational\nprograms and activities\" at their schools. None of these offices, how-\never, provides voter registration services.\n\nMore specific information was provided about three public col-\nleges, George Mason University, UVA, and Virginia Tech. George\nMason has a Disability Support Services Office (DSS) which is the\nonly office at George Mason that offers services\"specifically directed\nto students with disabilities.\" Operation of the DSS office at George\nMason is funded by student activity fees. At UVA disabled student\nservices are provided through the Office of the Vice President of Stu-\ndent Affairs. At Virginia Tech these services are provided by the\nOffice of the Dean of Students. UVA and Virginia Tech fund these\noffices from appropriations made by the General Assembly for\n\"Higher Education Student Services.\"3\n\nVirginia moved for summary judgment on November 25, 1996, and\nNCSD cross-moved for partial summary judgment on January 13,\n1977. The Commonwealth argued that \"offices\" under § 1973gg-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 A visit to the Internet reveals additional information about disabled\nstudents services available at UVA. UVA advertises a Learning Needs\nand Evaluation Center that provides \"numerous non-medical services to\nstudents with disabilities,\" including education counseling. See Univer-\nsity of Virginia, Guide to the University of Virginia for Students with\nDisabilities (visited June 30, 1998) http://www.uva.edu~vpsa/ada-\nstd.html>.

First, it\npointed out that it was not contending that entire colleges should be\ndesignated as voter registration agencies.

These smal-\nler offices had to be designated as voter registration agencies, accord-\ning to NCSD, because they were offering \"programs primarily\nengaged in providing services\" to disabled students. Second, it argued\nthat the ADA requires colleges to provide convenient and accessible\nvoter registration sites for disabled students.

In addressing the NVRA, the court\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4 A few state government departments that serve the disabled have been\ndesignated by Virginia as voter registration agencies. They are the Vir-\nginia Department of Rehabilitative Services, the Department for Rights\nof Virginians with Disabilities, the Virginia Department for the Deaf and\nHard of Hearing, the Virginia Department for the Visually Handicapped,\nthe Virginia Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Sub-\nstance Abuse Services, and the Virginia Department of Social Services.\n\n                     6\n\fheld that Congress did not intend for the Act to apply to state colleges\nbecause these institutions are not primarily engaged in serving dis-\nabled persons. The court also rejected NCSD's claim that the ADA\nrequires a voter registration site for disabled students on college cam-\npuses. Finally, the court said that NCSD did not state a claim under\nthe Constitution. NCSD appeals the district court's ruling on its\nNVRA claim and also seeks to have us consider its claim that the\nADA requires voter registration application forms in braille and large\nprint. The district court did not address the braille/large print claim,\npresumably because the claim was not asserted in the complaint or in\nany motion to amend. Because the braille/large print claim was not\nproperly raised in district court, we will not consider it here. See\nKrouse v. American Sterilizer Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746873\"><a href=\"/opinion/746873/robert-v-krouse-v-american-sterilizer-company-liberty-mutual-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499 n.1 (3d Cir.\n1997). We move, then, to the one claim that NCSD preserved for\nappeal, the NVRA claim.\n\nII.\n\nThe NVRA requires that states designate as voter registration agen-\ncies \"all offices in the State that provide State-funded programs pri-\nmarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.\" 42\nU.S.C. § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B).\n\nVirginia concedes that at each of its public colleges there is an\noffice, section, or department that provides services to disabled stu-\ndents to ensure them adequate access to educational programs and\nother activities. Virginia also concedes that these offices at UVA and\nVirginia Tech are funded by a line item appropriation made by the\nGeneral Assembly for \"Higher Education Student Services.\" As a\nresult, it cannot be disputed that the offices assisting disabled students\nat UVA and Virginia Tech fit a key portion of the controlling statu-\ntory language: they \"provide State-funded programs primarily\nengaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.\" Id.\n§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B).5 The focus of the dispute on appeal is therefore\nwhether the offices providing these programs at UVA and Virginia\nTech are \"offices\" under the NVRA.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5 We cannot say whether the DSS office at George Mason meets the\n\"State-funded\" requirement. See part III, infra.\n\n                    7\n\fNCSD argues that an \"office\" is a subdivision of a government\ndepartment or institution. This argument is based on the definition of\nthe term \"office\" found in several leading dictionaries. NCSD argues\nthat since an office providing services for disabled students in a pub-\nlic college is a subdivision of the college, it should be considered an\n\"office\" for purposes of the NVRA. Virginia disagrees, arguing that\nthe term \"office\" refers to a government agency as a whole and not\nto offices that are subdivisions of an agency. Only a government\nagency created by state statute could be an \"office\" under Virginia's\ninterpretation. Virginia's public colleges are public institutions cre-\nated by statute. See generally Va. Code Ann. tit. 23. Thus, Virginia\nsuggests that a public college as a whole would be an \"office\" in the\nNVRA sense, but an office serving the disabled within that college\ncould not be an NVRA \"office\" because it is merely a subdivision of\nthe college that is not designated by statute or specific appropriation.6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6 Although Virginia argues that its public colleges are \"offices,\" the\nCommonwealth concludes that they do not have to be designated as voter\nregistration agencies because a college as a whole is not primarily\nengaged in serving the disabled. Virginia's argument about the meaning\nof \"office\" thus proceeds on the assumption that in order to be designated\nas a voter registration agency under § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B), an office (as a\nwhole) must be primarily engaged in serving the disabled. The statutory\nlanguage does not permit this assumption. Again, § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B)\ndesignates \"all offices in the State that provide State-funded programs\nprimarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.\"\n\"Primarily engaged\" modifies \"programs\" under the most natural reading\nof this provision. This reading is also mandated by the fundamental\ncanon of statutory construction that a qualifying phrase refers solely to\nits immediate antecedent. See 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction\n§ 47.33 (5th ed. 1992). Absent an expression of contrary congressional\nintent, the failure to apply this canon \"flies in the face of common sense\nin grammar hardened into law.\" United States ex rel.

Here, the antecedent immedi-\nately preceding \"primarily engaged\" is \"programs.\" There is nothing in\nthe statute or legislative history to suggest that\"primarily engaged\" does\nnot modify \"programs.\" Accordingly, an office may qualify as a voter\nregistration agency if it provides programs primarily engaged in serving\nthe disabled, even if the office as a whole is not primarily engaged in\nserving the disabled.\n\n                    8\n\fWe conclude that § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B), read in light of the estab-\nlished rules of statutory construction, requires states to designate as\nvoter registration agencies those state-funded offices that provide ser-\nvices to disabled students at public colleges.\n\nA.\n\nCourts must apply the plain language of a statute except in the rare\ncircumstance when there is a clearly expressed legislative intent to the\ncontrary or when a literal application would frustrate the statute's pur-\npose or lead to an absurd result.

Other dictionaries are in\n\n                    9\n\faccord with this definition of \"office.\" See, e.g., Webster's III New\nInternational Dictionary 1567 (1981) (\"a branch or subdivision of\ngovernmental administration that ranks (in the national government)\nbelow the department\"); Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 1844 (2d ed. 1987) (\"an operating agency or division of\ncertain departments of the U.S. Government: Office of Community\nServices\"); cf. Black's Law Dictionary 1083 (6th ed. 1990) (\"[a] place\nfor the regular transaction of business or performance of a particular\nservice\"). This definition means that an office within a government\ndepartment is a \"subdivision\" of that department. From this, NCSD\npersuasively argues that a public college created by the state is a state\ndepartment or institution. A public college is therefore not an \"office\"\nunder the NVRA because as a stand-alone department or institution,\nit could not be a \"subdivision\" of itself. NCSD concludes its applica-\ntion of the definition by arguing that a college office serving the dis-\nabled is a \"subdivision\" of the college and, hence, an \"office\" under\nthe Act.\n\nBy contrast, Virginia argues that the term \"office\" in § 1973gg-5\nmeans only a government department as a whole that is created\ndirectly by the state legislature; constituent subdivisions of a depart-\nment do not count. Under Virginia's interpretation public colleges are\nthemselves the \"offices\" referred to in the section. Virginia provides\nno textual support for this interpretation, however. In fact, the only\nsupport for Virginia's argument comes not from American but from\nBritish usage of the term \"office.\" See, e.g., Random House, supra,\nat 1844 (\"Brit. a major administrative unit or department of the\nnational government: the Foreign Office.\" (emphasis in original));\nWebster's III, supra, at 1567 (\"Brit: a principal branch or division of\ngovernmental administration: DEPARTMENT\" (emphasis in origi-\nnal)). Were we interpreting a statute of British origin, this definition\nmight be sufficient to create an ambiguity of meaning.\n\nIn this case, however, we are interpreting a statute enacted by the\nUnited States Congress, with the constituent states of the Union as the\nintended audience. The fact that an alternative definition exists in the\nEnglish language is not enough to create ambiguity.\"[T]he plain,\nobvious and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to\nany curious, narrow, hidden sense that nothing but the exigency of a\nhard case and the ingenuity and study of an acute and powerful intel-\n\n                     10\n\flect would discover.\" Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100599\"><a href=\"/opinion/100599/lynch-v-alworth-stephens-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n370 (1925) (Sutherland, J.) (quotations omitted). We believe that\nwhen the alternative definition of a term derives chiefly from usage\noutside the United States, the foreign usage will not blur an otherwise\nplain meaning of the term in one of our statutes, unless there is clear\nevidence that Congress intended to adopt the foreign definition. Cf.\nMCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Tel. & Tele. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 228 & n.3 (1995) (rejecting aberrant definition of \"modify\"\nwhen weight of common American usage dictates otherwise). There\nis no evidence that Congress intended to use \"office\" in the NVRA\nin the British (department of government) sense.\n\nWhen we focus on what the term \"office\" means insofar as govern-\nment structure is concerned, respected dictionaries tell us that in com-\nmon American usage the term means a subdivision of a government\ndepartment or institution. Virginia acknowledges that every one of its\npublic colleges has \"an office, section or department\" providing ser-\nvices to disabled students. Virginia does not dispute that these offices\nare subdivisions of the colleges. Accordingly, the dictionary defini-\ntion of the term \"office\" (a subdivision of a government department)\nsupports the proposition that offices providing disability services in\npublic colleges are \"offices\" under the NVRA.\n\n2.\n\nIn looking for the plain meaning of a statutory term, we also refer\nto the specific context (usually the subsection) in which the term is\nused. See e.g., Robinson, 117 S. Ct. at 846-47; Wildes, 120 F.3d at\n740. The context in which a term is used often determines how\nbroadly or narrowly the term is to be defined. And, when \"Congress\nemploy[s] broad language\" in drafting a statute, we \"are not free to\ndisregard\" it. Wildes, 120 F.3d at 740.\n\nThe term \"offices\" in the provision at issue appears in the following\ncontext: \"all offices in the State that provide State-funded programs\nprimarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.\"\n§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Virginia can point to nothing\nin this language that can be read to construe \"office\" to refer to an\nentire government department or institution, such as a college, created\ndirectly by the legislature. Nor can Virginia claim, once specific con-\n\n                    11\n\ftext is taken into account, that college offices providing programs for\nthe disabled are not \"offices\" under the provision. Indeed, the use of\nthe word \"all\" to modify \"offices\" suggests an expansive meaning\nbecause \"all\" is a term of great breadth. See Wildes, 120 F.2d at 740.\nThe addition of the broad, inclusive word \"all\" in the specific context\n(§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B)) in which the term \"offices\" is used also sup-\nports the conclusion that an office providing programs for the dis-\nabled in a public college is an \"office\" under the Act.\n\n3.\n\nNext, we must consider what \"offices\" means in the context of the\nstatute as a whole. See Robinson, 117 S. Ct. at 846-47; Wildes, 120\nF.3d at 740. The word \"offices\" is used in other provisions, § 1973gg-\n5(a)(2)(A) & (3)(B), which are interrelated with and in close proxim-\nity to § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B), the provision we are studying today. We\nthus have the \"classic case for application of the normal rule of statu-\ntory construction that identical words used in different parts of the\nsame act are intended to have the same meaning.\" See Commissioner\nv. Lundy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117992\"><a href=\"/opinion/117992/commissioner-v-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 250 (1996)(citations and internal quotations\nomitted).\n\nTo provide adequate voter registration opportunities to citizens\nwho may not apply for or renew driver's licenses, Congress requires\nstates to designate a number of \"offices\" as voter registration offices.\nSee generally § 1973gg-5. A state must designate \"all offices\" that\nprovide public assistance, see id. § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(A), and \"all\noffices\" \"that provide State-funded programs primarily engaged\" in\nserving the disabled, id. § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B). In addition to these spe-\ncific offices that must be designated as voter registration agencies, a\nstate must also designate \"other offices,\" see id. § 1973gg-5(a)(3)(A).\nAlthough a state has discretion in choosing the additional offices for\ndesignation, paragraph (3)(B) lists offices that may be included in the\ndiscretionary designation. See id. § 1973gg-5(a)(3)(B). Thus, para-\ngraph (3)(B), like paragraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B) just above it,\ndescribes \"offices\" that are suitable, in Congress's judgment, as voter\nregistration agencies.\n\nAmong the \"offices\" suggested in paragraph (3)(B) for designation\nare \"public libraries, public schools, offices of city and county clerks\n\n                     12\n\f(including marriage license bureaus), fishing and hunting license\nbureaus, government revenue offices, [and] unemployment compen-\nsation offices.\" Id. § 1973gg-5(3)(B). Congress is not describing over-\nall government departments here; it is describing subdivisions of\ndepartments. Thus, a marriage license bureau is a subdivision of a\nclerk's office, a hunting license bureau is a subdivision of a state\ngame and wildlife department, a revenue office is a subdivision of a\nstate tax department, an unemployment compensation office is a sub-\ndivision of a state department of employment security, and so on.\nCongress's focus in paragraph (3)(B) is on the small offices or loca-\ntions where citizens conduct their daily business with government.\nBecause of the high volume of citizen traffic in these offices, they are\nideal as voter registration agencies.\n\nVirginia argues that in paragraph (2)(B), relating to \"offices\" serv-\ning the disabled, Congress used \"offices\" to mean overall governmen-\ntal departments. Thus, according to Virginia, \"offices\" providing\n\"programs primarily engaged in providing services\" to the disabled\nwould only include the half-dozen major state departments serving\nthe disabled, such as the Virginia Department of Rehabilitative Ser-\nvices. However, when paragraph (2)(B) is read in context with para-\ngraphs (2)(A) (offices providing public assistance) and (3)(B)\n(various local offices), it appears that Congress in all three places\nused \"offices\" in the same (smaller) sense. In other words, Congress\nwanted to make voter registration services available in community-\nbased offices that citizens visit frequently for services or assistance.\nThis purpose applies especially to the disabled, many of whom do not\ndrive or have difficulty in traveling.\n\nWhen we consider what the word \"office\" means in the broader\ncontext of the NVRA as a whole, it does not stand for a government\ndepartment but it is a subdivision of a department where citizens reg-\nularly go for service and assistance. Under this meaning, a college\noffice serving disabled students would be an \"office\" under the spe-\ncific paragraph, § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B), we are considering.\n\nB.\n\nWe have just said that the plain meaning of the term\"offices\" in\n§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) includes an office providing services to disabled\n\n                    13\n\fstudents in a public college. This plain meaning cannot be circum-\nvented unless we have the rare instance when there is a clearly\nexpressed congressional intent to the contrary or when a literal appli-\ncation of the plain language would frustrate the statute's purpose or\nlead to an absurd result. See In re Vial, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741872\"><a href=\"/opinion/741872/in-re-avery-w-vial-movant/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1196 (4th Cir.\n1997) (en banc). Virginia does not argue that use of the plain meaning\nof \"offices\" would frustrate the purposes of the NVRA or lead to an\nabsurd result. However, Virginia did cite legislative history to the dis-\ntrict court to argue that Congress did not intend for the NVRA to\nreach state-supported colleges.\n\nThe district court held that the language of § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B)\ndoes not apply to state colleges because they are not primarily\nengaged in serving the disabled. The court then adopted Virginia's\nlegislative history argument to bolster this holding. The court cited a\nparagraph from the legislative history indicating that the Act's cover-\nage includes agencies providing \"education counseling\" to the dis-\nabled. From this, the court said that Congress \"intended that the act\napply to state institutions providing `education counseling' and not to\nthose agencies [that is, colleges] providing educational services.\"\nNational Coalition For Students with Disabilities Educ. and Legal\nDefense Fund v.

Because the plain\nmeaning of \"offices\" includes an office in a college serving the dis-\nabled, the NVRA's legislative history is irrelevant unless it proves\nthat this meaning of the statutory term violates congressional intent.\nWe have read the legislative history, and nothing in it reveals that\nusing the plain meaning of \"offices\" would violate congressional\nintent.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7 The undisputed facts in this case do not support the district court's\nreliance on legislative history. By Virginia's own admission it appears\nthat public college offices serving disabled students provide \"education\ncounseling\" to those students. According to the legislative history, there-\nfore, these particular college offices would be covered by the Act.\n\n                    14\n\fWe backtrack for a moment to the opening language of the NVRA,\nwhich makes its purpose clear: \"to establish procedures that will\nincrease the number of eligible citizens who register to vote.\"\n§ 1973gg(b)(1). The centerpiece of the Act is the motor voter section,\nproviding for the simultaneous application for a driver's license and\nvoter registration. See id. § 1973gg-3. But Congress recognized that\nmany citizens do not drive. To accommodate the non-drivers among\nus and to provide greater opportunity for registration in general, Con-\ngress requires states to designate a number of offices -- offices that\nare not part of state motor vehicle departments -- as voter registration\nagencies. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that state college\noffices serving the disabled are not \"offices\" to be designated as voter\nregistration agencies.\n\nAccording to the House Report, the office designation section of\nthe Act is designed to \"supplement the motor-voter provisions of the\nbill by reaching out to those citizens who are likely not to benefit\nfrom the State motor-voter application provisions.\" H.R.

(\"If a State\ndoes not include . . . public assistance [offices and] agencies serving\npersons with disabilities . . . it will exclude a segment of its popula-\ntion from those for whom registration will be convenient and readily\navailable -- the poor and persons with disabilities who do not have\ndriver's licenses and will not come into contact with the other princi-\nple [sic] place to register under this Act\").\n\nThe above passages from the legislative history are representative.\nCongress did not in any way express an intent to exclude offices serv-\ning the disabled in public colleges from the term \"offices\" in\n§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) of the NVRA.\n\n                    15\n\fC.\n\nIn sum, the dictionary defines \"office\" as a subdivision of a govern-\nment department or institution. The specific context in which the term\n\"office\" is used in § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) and the use of the term else-\nwhere in the Act reinforce this dictionary definition. Nothing in the\nlegislative history reveals that Congress intended for a different defi-\nnition to apply. Accordingly, we hold that the plain meaning of the\nterm \"offices\" in § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) includes an office providing\nservices to disabled students at a public college. Such an office, as a\nsubdivision of the college, fits the plain meaning of \"office.\"8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8 Virginia has indicated that under this interpretation an office that pro-\nvides programs primarily serving the disabled could be designated as a\nvoter registration agency even though the office also provides other pro-\ngrams not aimed at serving the disabled. See n.6, supra. The Common-\nwealth has in mind the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs\nat UVA and the Office of the Dean of Students at Virginia Tech. How-\never, the fact that such an office is designated as a voter registration\nagency does not mean that it must provide voter registration services to\nall patrons, including those without disabilities. Rather, only those per-\nsons seeking the benefits of the programs primarily serving the disabled\nwould be entitled to voter registration services.\n\nIt is true that the NVRA states that \"[a] voter registration agency that\nis an office that provides service or assistance in addition to voter regis-\ntration shall . . . distribute [the voter registration application forms, etc.]\nwith each application for such service or assistance, and with each recer-\ntification, renewal, or change of address form relating to such service or\nassistance.\" § 1973gg-5(a)(6). Read literally, this could require a multi-\npurpose office, designated as a voter registration agency because its\nfunctions include offering programs primarily serving the disabled, to\noffer voter registration services to all patrons, disabled and non-disabled\nalike. This would be an absurd result, however, given the NVRA's care-\nfully structured program to promote registration.\n\nA study showed that about 90 percent of the population 18 years and\nolder had driver's licenses, so Congress believed that a vast majority of\ncitizens would have improved access to voter registration through the\nmotor voter provision. See H.R. Rep. No. 103-9, at 4-5 (1993), reprinted\nin 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 105, 108-09. Recognizing that many disabled per-\nsons do not drive and would therefore miss the opportunity to register\nunder the motor voter program, Congress added § 1973gg-5(2)(B)\n\n                     16\n\fIII.\n\nOur final piece of business is the disposition required in light of our\nanalysis. Because we have held that the term \"offices\" in 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B) includes public college offices with programs\nserving the disabled, we reverse the district court's order awarding\nsummary judgment to Virginia.\n\nNCSD asserts that the district court erred in denying its motion for\npartial summary judgment. Although an order denying summary\njudgment is not independently appealable, we may review such an\norder when it is appealed along with an order granting a cross-motion\nfor summary judgment. See Monahan v. County of Chesterfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726575\"><a href=\"/opinion/726575/brian-f-monahan-robert-e-balducci-jr-paul-blocker-n-scott-meyerhoffer/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1265 (4th Cir. 1996). When the facts are uncontroverted,\nwe are free to direct the entry of an order awarding summary judg-\nment to the party whose motion was denied. See id.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Office of the Vice President of Student\nAffairs at UVA and the Office of the Dean of Students at Virginia\nTech offer \"programs primarily engaged in providing services to\" dis-\nabled students. It is also undisputed that these programs are \"State-\nfunded\" by the Commonwealth through the \"Higher Education Stu-\ndent Services\" appropriation made by the General Assembly. Virginia\ndoes not suggest any issue of material fact that would preclude sum-\nmary judgment regarding these two institutions. See Appellee's Br. at\n4 (\"There [a]re no disputed issues of material fact\"). Accordingly, on\nremand the district court is to grant partial summary judgment for\nNCSD, declaring that the Office of the Vice President of Student\nAffairs at the University of Virginia and the Office of the Dean of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n(requiring designation of offices with \"programs primarily engaged\" in\nserving the disabled) solely to target the disabled portion of the popula-\ntion. Because § 1973gg-5(2)(B) was enacted only to cover the disabled,\nwe believe that an office designated as a voter registration agency under\nthat section is required to provide voter registration services just to those\nof its patrons who are disabled. Accordingly, while an office, such as a\ndean of students office, that serves both disabled and non-disabled stu-\ndents may qualify for designation under § 1973gg-5(2)(B), only the dis-\nabled will be entitled to voter registration services.\n\n                     17\n\fStudents at Virginia Polytechnic Institute qualify for designation as\nvoter registration agencies under § 1973gg-5(a)(2)(B).\n\nWe are not in a position to order any relief with respect to the DSS\noffice at George Mason University. The DSS office is an \"office\" for\nNVRA purposes because its function is to assist disabled students. It\nis not clear, however, whether the office is state funded because it is\nfinanced with student activity fees and not appropriated funds. Stu-\ndent activity fees may be considered a source of state funding if the\nmonies generated by those fees are controlled by the college. See,\ne.g., Student Gov't Assoc. v. Board of Trustees of the Univ. of Mass.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518836\"><a href=\"/opinion/518836/the-student-government-association-etc-v-the-board-of-trustees-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 478 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding that student activity fees\ncollected under authority of state law and disbursed at direction of\nboard of trustees are university funds). If, however, the fees are not\nsubject to university control and are segregated from other university\nfunds, they may not be considered as state funds. Cf.

Both the record and Virginia law are silent as to how\nstudent activities fees are collected, maintained, or disbursed at\nGeorge Mason University. When the factual record is insufficient on\na threshold question, we must remand to the district court for further\nproceedings. See Shao v. Link Cargo (Taiwan) Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600749\"><a href=\"/opinion/600749/ting-hwa-shao-v-link-cargo-taiwan-limited-abacus-transports-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n703-04 (4th Cir. 1993). On remand the district court will determine\nthe sources, nature, and handling of funding for the programs offered\nby the DSS office at George Mason University.\n\nNCSD should also be given the opportunity on remand to establish,\nif it can, that there are offices serving disabled students in other public\ncolleges in Virginia that should be designated as voter registration\nagencies.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS\n\n                     18\n\f</pre>",
