W. id, 1084 (1941j, Attorney General’s    Opinion R-2461.\n\n              Clark vs. Finley, 93 Tex. 171, 54 S. W. 343, recognized       that substantial\ndifferences   in population,s of counties was a basis for legislation    fixing compensation\nof officers  on the theory that the work devolved upon an officer was directly pro-\nportionate to the population of the county.       This was recognized   as sufficient to\njustify a larger compensation     for officers   in counties having a large population\nas compared     with compensation    to like officers  in counties having a smaller    popu-\nlation.\n\n              This same doctrine applies in like manner to regulation        of the working\nhours of firemen    by means of a graduated bracket regulation       on a population basis.\nSince it has be,en clearly recognized     that the work devolving upon officers      is\ndirectly proportionate    to the population of the county, a sufficient basis to justify\na graduated scale of maximum working hours is thus established.            It follows that\nthe Legislature   may determine that the work load of firemen        in counties with a\nlarge population is more strenuous than that in counties with a small population.\nTherefore,    a more restricted   number of maximum work hours is a reasonable\nregulation.\n\n              Senate Committee Amendment       No. 1 restricts  the application of the\nbill to cities containing the population of “not more than 400,000 inhabitants”,\nand eliminates    at least three cities from the Act, i. e. Dallas, Houston and San\nAntonio.    Amendment     No. 1 is based upon the determination   that cities having\n\fHon. Wardlow       Lane,   Page   3 (WW-34)\n\n\nthe larger population would not have as great or greater need for regulated maxi-\nmum working hours as would small cities.      The Legislature cannot determine the\npositive and the negative of the same propostion and expect the Act to pass the\ntest of being based upon a reasonable classification.\n\n                In Attorney   General’s Opinion R-2414,     quoting   Oakley   vs. Kent, Supra,\nthe following     reasoning   was adopted:\n\n                        “If population affords a ground for creating the office\n                of county purchasing   agent, it must be upon one of two theories:\n\n                        “(1) The smaller   the population    of the county the gr,eater\n                the need for such an office.\n\n                        “(2)  The greater the population     of the county the greater\n                the need of such an office.”\n\n                          “The bracket is from 140,000 to 220,000.      Upon the first\n                theory the law is arbitrary    and discriminatory    because it excludes\n                counties below 140,000, which would have a greater need than the\n                counties in the bracket,     Upon the second theory, the law is likewise\n                arbitrary   and discriminatory    in that it does not embrace  counties\n                having a population above 220,000 which counties would have a\n                greater need for a purchasing      agent than counties within the bracket,\n\n              Neither Senate Bill 103 of the 55th Legislature,    nor Senate Committee\nAmendment      No. 2, by Senator Krueger   sets the maximum working hours of firemen\nin cities with a population of less than 10,000 inhabitants.     The Legislature    can\ndetermine   that there is no need for regulation   in cities of such size.   Therefore,\nthe exclusion   of coverage  of such cities in the Bill as written and Senate Com-\nmittee Amendment No. 2, does not prevent the Bill as written nor Amendment\nNo. 2 from being a general law within the meaning of Section 56 of Article         III of\nthe Constitution of Texas.\n\n                In order for a population bracket to be used as a classification        device,\nthe premises      upon which it is based must be consistent.\n\n\n\n                                               SUMMARY\n\n                                   Senate Bill No. 103 and Senate Committee\n                        Amendment      No. 2 use a consistent classification\n                        cLeiric~e:and are don.stitutional. Amendment     No. 1 is\n                        inconsistent with the basic premise     of the classi-\n                        fication device that the work load in counties with\n\fHon.

This was recognized   as sufficient to\njustify a larger compensation     for officers   in counties having a large population\nas compared     with compensation    to like officers  in counties having a smaller    popu-\nlation.\n\n              This same doctrine applies in like manner to regulation        of the working\nhours of firemen    by means of a graduated bracket regulation       on a population basis.\nSince it has be,en clearly recognized     that the work devolving upon officers      is\ndirectly proportionate    to the population of the county, a sufficient basis to justify\na graduated scale of maximum working hours is thus established.            It follows that\nthe Legislature   may determine that the work load of firemen        in counties with a\nlarge population is more strenuous than that in counties with a small population.\nTherefore,    a more restricted   number of maximum work hours is a reasonable\nregulation.\n\n              Senate Committee Amendment       No. 1 restricts  the application of the\nbill to cities containing the population of “not more than 400,000 inhabitants”,\nand eliminates    at least three cities from the Act, i. e. Dallas, Houston and San\nAntonio.    Amendment     No. 1 is based upon the determination   that cities having\n\fHon. Wardlow       Lane,   Page   3 (WW-34)\n\n\nthe larger population would not have as great or greater need for regulated maxi-\nmum working hours as would small cities.      The Legislature cannot determine the\npositive and the negative of the same propostion and expect the Act to pass the\ntest of being based upon a reasonable classification.\n\n                In Attorney   General’s Opinion R-2414,     quoting   Oakley   vs. Kent, Supra,\nthe following     reasoning   was adopted:\n\n                        “If population affords a ground for creating the office\n                of county purchasing   agent, it must be upon one of two theories:\n\n                        “(1) The smaller   the population    of the county the gr,eater\n                the need for such an office.\n\n                        “(2)  The greater the population     of the county the greater\n                the need of such an office.”\n\n                          “The bracket is from 140,000 to 220,000.      Upon the first\n                theory the law is arbitrary    and discriminatory    because it excludes\n                counties below 140,000, which would have a greater need than the\n                counties in the bracket,     Upon the second theory, the law is likewise\n                arbitrary   and discriminatory    in that it does not embrace  counties\n                having a population above 220,000 which counties would have a\n                greater need for a purchasing      agent than counties within the bracket,\n\n              Neither Senate Bill 103 of the 55th Legislature,    nor Senate Committee\nAmendment      No. 2, by Senator Krueger   sets the maximum working hours of firemen\nin cities with a population of less than 10,000 inhabitants.     The Legislature    can\ndetermine   that there is no need for regulation   in cities of such size.   Therefore,\nthe exclusion   of coverage  of such cities in the Bill as written and Senate Com-\nmittee Amendment No. 2, does not prevent the Bill as written nor Amendment\nNo. 2 from being a general law within the meaning of Section 56 of Article         III of\nthe Constitution of Texas.\n\n                In order for a population bracket to be used as a classification        device,\nthe premises      upon which it is based must be consistent.\n\n\n\n                                               SUMMARY\n\n                                   Senate Bill No. 103 and Senate Committee\n                        Amendment      No. 2 use a consistent classification\n                        cLeiric~e:and are don.stitutional. Amendment     No. 1 is\n                        inconsistent with the basic premise     of the classi-\n                        fication device that the work load in counties with\n\fHon.
