At the time of the transfers, Debtor\n 7   was a defendant in state court litigation; a default judgment was\n 8   entered in that litigation shortly after the transfers.      Debtor\n 9   and his spouse testified that the transfers were for her sole\n10   benefit as part of long-contemplated estate planning, and from\n11   the face of the relevant documents, the transfers to the trust\n12   appeared to be for the sole benefit of Debtor’s spouse.      Post-\n13   transfer, however, Debtor and his spouse ignored the stated\n14   purpose of the transfers and continued to treat the trust\n15   property as they had pre-transfer.\n16        After Debtor filed his chapter 71 petition, the trustee\n17   filed an adversary proceeding against Debtor and his non-debtor\n18   spouse seeking to avoid the transfers under the California\n19   Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (“CUFTA”) and other theories.\n20   After a one-day trial, the bankruptcy court entered judgment in\n21   favor of the chapter 7 trustee.    On reconsideration, the\n22   bankruptcy court amended the judgment to clarify that while the\n23\n24        **\n            Hon.

Consequently, the court determined that\n 6   the estate held the entire interest in all of the properties that\n 7   had been improperly transferred to the trust.\n 8        Debtor and his spouse appeal the bankruptcy court’s findings\n 9   that the transfers were avoidable as actually fraudulent\n10   transfers and that the estate has a deemed community property\n11   interest in the recovered properties.\n12        In this unpublished memorandum, we AFFIRM the decision of\n13   the bankruptcy court with respect to its findings that the\n14   transfers were avoidable as actually fraudulent transfers.    In a\n15   separate published opinion, we also AFFIRM the bankruptcy court’s\n16   ruling that the recovered properties were restored to community\n17   property status and thus were fully recoverable by the bankruptcy\n18   estate.\n19                                  FACTS\n20   A.   Pre-Petition Events\n21        Debtor and his non-debtor spouse, Anh N. Brace, were married\n22   in 1972.   Debtor is a real estate consultant with approximately\n23   30 years of experience as a licensed real estate agent, broker,\n24   and consultant.   During the marriage, Appellants acquired their\n25   residence in Redlands, California, a rental property in San\n26   Bernardino, California, and a parcel of real property in Mohave,\n27   Arizona (collectively, the “Properties”).   Appellants took title\n28   to each of the Properties as “husband and wife as joint tenants.”\n\n                                     -3-\n\f 1        On July 30, 2004, Debtor formed the Crescent Trust.    The\n 2   instrument creating the Crescent Trust states that it is an\n 3   irrevocable trust and that Debtor is the sole trustee; Ms. Brace\n 4   is the sole beneficiary of the trust.    The trust instrument was\n 5   not recorded.   Shortly thereafter, Debtor executed and had\n 6   recorded trust transfer deeds transferring his interests in the\n 7   Redlands and San Bernardino properties into the Crescent Trust\n 8   for no consideration.   Additionally, the box on each deed was\n 9   checked indicating that the transfer was to a revocable trust.\n10   Thus, although the unrecorded trust instrument for the Crescent\n11   Trust appeared to place the trust assets out of the reach of\n12   creditors, the public record reflected that the trust was\n13   revocable and thus its assets were potentially subject to\n14   execution by creditors and subject to disposition by the trustor.\n15   See Laycock v. Hammer, 141 Cal. App. 4th 25, 29-30 (2006) (in\n16   order to reach trust assets, creditor must show that trust was\n17   revocable); Cal. Prob. Code § 18200.\n18        For reasons that were not explained, Ms. Brace did not\n19   transfer her interests in the Redlands and San Bernardino\n20   properties into the Crescent Trust.     Also, no deed transferring\n21   the Mohave property was ever recorded, although Debtor testified\n22   that such a deed was prepared.    In the parties’ joint pre-trial\n23   statement, Appellants stipulated that the Mohave property was an\n24   asset of the bankruptcy estate.\n25        At the time of the transfers, Debtor was a defendant in\n26   litigation in San Bernardino County Superior Court; a default\n27   judgment in the amount of $60,000 was entered against the Debtor\n28   in that litigation approximately one month after the transfers\n\n                                       -4-\n\f 1   occurred.\n 2        After the Redlands and San Bernardino properties were\n 3   transferred into the Crescent Trust, Debtor and Ms. Brace\n 4   continued to live in the Redlands property; they also used those\n 5   properties to secure bail bonds in a criminal matter.    Debtor\n 6   never filed tax returns for the Crescent Trust.2\n 7   B.   Post-Petition Events\n 8        Debtor filed a chapter 7 petition on May 16, 2011, and\n 9   Robert L. Goodrich was appointed chapter 7 trustee (“Trustee”).3\n10   Debtor did not list any real property on Schedule A.    At Debtor’s\n11   341 meeting, he testified that he had owned no real property in\n12   the prior two years.    He also testified that Ms. Brace owned no\n13   property that was not listed in his schedules.\n14        On December 15, 2011, Trustee filed an adversary proceeding\n15   against Appellants, individually and in their capacities as\n16   trustees of the Crescent Trust,4 seeking:    a declaration that the\n17   Properties were property of the bankruptcy estate; a judgment\n18   quieting title to the Properties in the bankruptcy estate;\n19   turnover of any of the Properties determined to be property of\n20\n          2\n            At the time he formed the Crescent Trust, Debtor owned two\n21\n     other parcels of real property, one in Palm Springs and the other\n22   in Moreno Valley, which he held as his sole and separate\n     property. Concurrently with the formation of the Crescent Trust,\n23   Debtor formed two additional trusts, the Cardillo Trust and the\n     Casilla Trust. Debtor transferred into those trusts his\n24   interests in the Palm Springs and Moreno Valley properties,\n     respectively.\n25\n          3\n26          Appellee Steven M. Speier was substituted as chapter 7\n     trustee after Mr. Goodrich resigned in December 2015.\n27\n          4\n              As noted, Ms. Brace is not a trustee of the Crescent\n28   Trust.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f 1   the estate; and avoidance and recovery of Debtor’s transfers of\n 2   the Redlands and San Bernardino properties into the Crescent\n 3   Trust as actually and/or constructively fraudulent transfers\n 4   under Cal. Civ. Code § 3439.04(a) (collectively, the “Fraudulent\n 5   Transfer Claims”); and revocation of Debtor’s discharge under\n 6   §§ 727(d)(1) and (d)(2).\n 7        The bankruptcy court ordered the issues bifurcated for trial\n 8   pursuant to Civil Rule 42(b), applicable via Rule 7042, with the\n 9   Fraudulent Transfer Claims being tried before the revocation of\n10   discharge claims.    Trial was held on the Fraudulent Transfer\n11   Claims on May 11, 2015.    The witnesses were Debtor, Ms. Brace,\n12   Trustee, and Burke Huber, an attorney who authenticated Debtor’s\n13   deposition testimony from a separate lawsuit.    Direct testimony\n14   was by declaration;5 Debtor, Ms. Brace, and Trustee were cross-\n15   examined at trial.    The bankruptcy court thereafter made oral\n16   findings and conclusions in favor of Trustee on the actually\n17   fraudulent transfer claim.\n18        The bankruptcy court found: that the Crescent Trust was an\n19   illegal trust and should be disregarded because Debtor had\n20   created it for the sole purpose of defrauding creditors; that the\n21   transfers of the Redlands and San Bernardino properties into the\n22   Crescent Trust were actually fraudulent transfers; that the\n23   Crescent Trust was Debtor’s alter ego; that Ms. Brace was not a\n24   good faith transferee; and that the Trustee was entitled to avoid\n25   the unrecorded transfer of the Mohave property as a hypothetical\n26\n          5\n27          The bankruptcy court sustained certain objections to the\n     declaration testimony. No party has assigned error to those\n28   rulings.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f 1   bona fide purchaser under § 544.    For all of these reasons, the\n 2   bankruptcy court concluded that the transfers of the Redlands and\n 3   San Bernardino properties into the Crescent Trust were avoidable\n 4   and recoverable by Trustee as property of the estate.\n 5        The court entered judgment on September 25, 2015.   The\n 6   judgment provided that the Properties were property of the estate\n 7   and were to be turned over to Trustee.    Defendants timely moved\n 8   to reconsider and amend the judgment, arguing that the judgment\n 9   should have provided that the Properties were owned one half by\n10   Debtor and one half by Ms. Brace as tenants in common and that\n11   only Debtor’s interests in the Properties, and not Ms. Brace’s,\n12   were property of the estate.   After oral argument, the bankruptcy\n13   court issued its findings on the record, granting the motion to\n14   reconsider in part: the bankruptcy court entered an amended\n15   judgment clarifying that although the Properties were restored to\n16   joint tenancy as a matter of title, they were community property\n17   under California law and were thus property of the estate.\n18        Appellants timely appealed.6\n19                             JURISDICTION\n20        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n21   §§ 1334 and 157(b)(2)(E), (H), and (J).   We have jurisdiction\n22   under 28 U.S.C. § 158.\n23                                  ISSUES\n24        A.   Whether the bankruptcy court erred in finding that the\n25\n26        6\n            Because the amended judgment did not dispose of all the\n27   claims in the adversary proceeding, after this appeal was filed\n     the parties obtained a second amended judgment from the\n28   bankruptcy court that contained a Rule 54(b) certification.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f 1   transfers of the Redlands and San Bernardino properties into the\n 2   Crescent Trust were actually fraudulent transfers.\n 3        B.   Whether the bankruptcy court erred in finding that the\n 4   Crescent Trust was Debtor’s alter ego.\n 5        C.   Whether the bankruptcy court erred in finding that\n 6   Ms. Brace was not a good faith transferee.\n 7                              STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n 8        We review the bankruptcy court’s findings of fact for clear\n 9   error, and its conclusions of law de novo.       Carrillo v. Su\n10   (In re Su), 290 F.3d 1140, 1142 (9th Cir. 2002).       A finding is\n11   clearly erroneous “when although there is evidence to support it,\n12   the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the\n13   definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.”\n14   Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985)\n15   (citation omitted).   Where two permissible views of the evidence\n16   exist, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be clearly\n17   erroneous.   Id. at 574.    We are to give “due regard to the trial\n18   court’s opportunity to judge the witnesses’ credibility.”         Civil\n19   Rule 52(a)(6) (incorporated via Rule 7052).       We also give\n20   deference to inferences drawn by the trial court.       Beech Aircraft\n21   Corp. v. United States, 51 F.3d 834, 838 (9th Cir. 1995).\n22                                  DISCUSSION\n23   A.   The bankruptcy court did not err in finding that the\n          transfers of the Redlands and San Bernardino properties into\n24        the Crescent Trust were avoidable as actually fraudulent\n          transfers.\n25\n26        1.   The bankruptcy court correctly found that the transfers\n               were made with actual fraudulent intent.\n27\n28        California Civil Code § 3439.04 provides:\n\n                                        -8-\n\f 1             (a) A transfer made or obligation incurred by a\n          debtor is voidable as to a creditor, whether the\n 2        creditor’s claim arose before or after the transfer was\n          made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made\n 3        the transfer or incurred the obligation as follows:\n 4             (1) With actual intent to hinder, delay, or\n          defraud any creditor of the debtor.\n 5\n 6        The statute further provides that, in determining actual\n 7   intent to defraud, the court may consider the following factors:\n 8             (1) Whether the transfer or obligation was to an\n          insider.\n 9\n               (2) Whether the debtor retained possession or\n10        control of the property transferred after the transfer.\n11             (3) Whether the transfer or obligation was\n          disclosed or concealed.\n12\n               (4) Whether before the transfer was made or\n13        obligation was incurred, the debtor had been sued or\n          threatened with suit.\n14\n               (5) Whether the transfer was of substantially all\n15        the debtor’s assets.\n16             (6) Whether the debtor absconded.\n17             (7) Whether the debtor removed or concealed\n          assets.\n18\n               (8) Whether the value of the consideration\n19        received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the\n          value of the asset transferred or the amount of the\n20        obligation incurred.\n21             (9) Whether the debtor was insolvent or became\n          insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the\n22        obligation was incurred.\n23             (10) Whether the transfer occurred shortly before\n          or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred.\n24\n               (11) Whether the debtor transferred the essential\n25        assets of the business to a lienor that transferred the\n          assets to an insider of the debtor.\n26\n27   Cal. Civ. Code § 3439.04(b).\n28        These eleven factors:\n\n                                    -9-\n\f 1        provide neither a counting rule, nor a mathematical\n          formula. No minimum number of factors tips the scales\n 2        toward actual intent. A trier of fact is entitled to\n          find actual intent based on the evidence in the case,\n 3        even if no “badges of fraud” are present. Conversely,\n          specific evidence may negate an inference of fraud\n 4        notwithstanding the presence of a number of “badges of\n          fraud.”\n 5\n 6   Wolkowitz v. Beverly (In re Beverly), 374 B.R. 221, 236 (9th Cir.\n 7   BAP 2007), aff’d in part, dismissed in part, 551 F.3d 1092 (9th\n 8   Cir. 2008) (citations omitted).\n 9        The bankruptcy court found that the presence of numerous\n10   badges of fraud supported a finding that the Crescent Trust was\n11   created for the purpose of defrauding creditors and thus was an\n12   illegal trust that should be disregarded.   Specifically, the\n13   bankruptcy court found that the following factors supported a\n14   finding of actual fraud: (1) the transfers to the Crescent Trust\n15   were to an insider because Ms. Brace was the sole beneficiary of\n16   the Crescent Trust; (2) the Debtor retained possession and\n17   control of the transferred properties–-he continued to live in\n18   the Redlands Property, and Debtor used the San Bernardino\n19   Property as collateral to post bonds for himself and a friend in\n20   criminal matters; (3) the Debtor concealed the nature of the\n21   transfers by claiming on the trust transfer deeds that the\n22   properties were transferred into a revocable trust; (4) at the\n23   time of the transfers the Debtor was a defendant in state court\n24   litigation; (5) the Debtor removed or concealed the properties by\n25   transferring them to the Crescent Trust; and (6) the Debtor\n26   transferred the properties shortly before a substantial debt was\n27   incurred, that is, the entry of the $60,000 default judgment.\n28        Appellants argue that the bankruptcy court’s finding of\n\n                                   -10-\n\f 1   actual fraudulent intent was clearly erroneous because there was\n 2   no evidence that Debtor had notice of the state court lawsuit\n 3   which resulted in entry of the default judgment.   Debtor\n 4   testified that he did not know of the lawsuit because he was not\n 5   personally served with the summons and complaint in that action,\n 6   which were served only by publication.   Additionally, as\n 7   discussed below, Appellants contend that the transfers to the\n 8   Crescent Trust were done for estate planning purposes and to\n 9   memorialize the couple’s longstanding agreement for Ms. Brace to\n10   hold title to the Properties.\n11        These arguments are not persuasive; they ignore the trial\n12   court’s function in assessing credibility of witnesses and this\n13   Panel’s duty to defer to that assessment, and they misconstrue\n14   the rationale for the court’s reliance on “badges of fraud” to\n15   assess fraudulent intent.\n16        As should be obvious, fraudulent intent is not readily\n17   conceded and, for that reason among others, not easily proven.\n18   In these instances, courts have access to two tools to assist\n19   them in determining fraudulent intent: (1) assessment of a\n20   witness’s credibility via observing his or her demeanor and\n21   testimony at trial, and (2) consideration of the “badges of\n22   fraud” that provide essentially a checklist of the circumstances\n23   that typically surround fraudulent acts.\n24        a.   This Panel must defer to the trial court’s findings\n               regarding credibility.\n25\n26        At the outset of its ruling, the bankruptcy court observed\n27   that neither Debtor nor Ms. Brace were credible witnesses.    The\n28   bankruptcy court noted that Debtor was “alert, educated, [and]\n\n                                     -11-\n\f 1   sophisticated” but that he had a “very selective memory”: he had\n 2   good recall of events that were in his favor, but his memory\n 3   failed him when he was questioned by Trustee’s counsel.\n 4   Regarding Ms. Brace, the bankruptcy court noted that she\n 5   testified “like she was reading a script that her husband or\n 6   someone gave her to say.    But even then, she was neither\n 7   convincing nor credible.”\n 8        We must defer to the bankruptcy court’s credibility\n 9   determination to the extent it was based on the witnesses’\n10   demeanor.\n11        When factual findings are based on determinations\n          regarding the credibility of witnesses, we give great\n12        deference to the bankruptcy court’s findings, because\n          the bankruptcy court, as the trier of fact, had the\n13        opportunity to note variations in demeanor and tone of\n          voice that bear so heavily on the listener’s\n14        understanding of and belief in what is said.\n15   Retz v. Samson (In re Retz), 606 F.3d 1189, 1196 (9th Cir.\n16   2010)(citing Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 575\n17   (1985)).\n18        Moreover, there was ample evidence in the record to support\n19   an inference that Debtor was not an honest individual: (1) Debtor\n20   had a history of using multiple aliases that he did not disclose\n21   in his bankruptcy petition; (2) at Debtor’s 341 meeting, he\n22   contradicted deposition testimony he gave in 2012 in state court\n23   litigation; (3) Debtor pled guilty to forgery in 2010; and\n24   (4) according to the declaration filed in the superior court in\n25   support of the state court plaintiffs’ request to serve\n26   defendants by publication, plaintiffs made the request because,\n27   in prior litigation against the same defendants, plaintiffs’\n28   counsel had been unable to locate Debtor:\n\n                                     -12-\n\f 1        In the [prior lawsuit] . . . I never could find . . .\n          WALTER HARRIS or CLIFF BRACE and am not certain that\n 2        these are their real names. . . . I believe the WILSON\n          DEFENDANTS have set up P.O. Boxes, created false names,\n 3        and false entities in order to evade service. . . . I\n          am not certain that Defendants JUAN GARCIA, WALTER\n 4        HARRIS, NANCY NETTER, C. ALLEN, or CLIFF BRACE are even\n          real people. I have been unable to find any\n 5        information that they exist.7\n 6\n     In granting the request, the state court necessarily found that\n 7\n     defendants had a history of evading service, which warranted\n 8\n     service by publication.\n 9\n          Because there is nothing in the record to suggest that the\n10\n     bankruptcy court’s credibility determinations were erroneous, we\n11\n     defer to those determinations.\n12\n          b.   The bankruptcy court correctly applied the “badges of\n13             fraud” to determine that the Debtor made the transfers\n               with actual intent to defraud creditors.\n14\n15        Appellants claim that the trial court incorrectly determined\n16   that the transfers were made with actual intent to defraud,\n17   because there was no evidence that Debtor knew about the pending\n18   state court claim at the time of the transfers.   This assertion\n19   is erroneous.\n20        First, Appellants ignore the fact that the trial court found\n21   that six separate badges of fraud were present with respect to\n22   the challenged transfers and that only two related to the\n23   existence of litigation: whether Debtor had been sued before the\n24   transfer was made and whether the transfer occurred shortly\n25   before a substantial debt was incurred.   Thus, even if we agreed\n26\n          7\n27          Debtor admitted at trial that he had used the names\n     “C. Allen,” “Robert Keller,” and “David Walton” as aliases for\n28   various purposes.\n\n                                      -13-\n\f 1   with Appellants that the trial court wrongly relied on the\n 2   existence of litigation, or the imminent entry of a judgment, as\n 3   badges of fraud, there was ample, and unchallenged, support in\n 4   the record for a finding of fraudulent intent; there are four\n 5   additional badges of fraud present here.\n 6        Second, and as noted above, the bankruptcy court need not\n 7   find the presence of a majority, or even any set number, of the\n 8   enumerated badges of fraud to conclude that a party likely\n 9   engaged in fraud.   Rather, the court is entitled to conclude that\n10   a party acted with actual intent to defraud creditors based on\n11   the court’s reasonable assessment of all the facts and\n12   circumstances; the badges of fraud are merely a tool to assist in\n13   that task.\n14        Third, Debtor’s premise that unless the court could\n15   essentially demonstrate that the Debtor “knew” a fact that he\n16   denied knowing, it could not conclude that he had acted with\n17   fraudulent intent, requires exactly the sort of impossible\n18   “seeing inside the debtor’s conscience” that the legislature\n19   sought to avoid by compiling the badges of fraud.   To require\n20   demonstrable certainty of a debtor’s knowledge would completely\n21   obviate the utility of consideration of circumstantial, and\n22   reliable, evidence.   See In re Beverly, 374 B.R. at 235 (“Since\n23   direct evidence of intent to hinder, delay or defraud is\n24   uncommon, the determination typically is made inferentially from\n25   circumstances consistent with the requisite intent.”) (citing\n26   Filip v. Bucurenciu, 129 Cal. App. 4th 825, 835, 28 Cal. Rptr. 3d\n27   884, 890 (2005)).\n28\n\n                                    -14-\n\f 1        c.   The bankruptcy court was not required to believe\n               Debtor’s wholly implausible explanation for the\n 2             transfers.\n 3        Putting aside Debtor’s courtroom demeanor and history of\n 4   deceptive practices, as well as the court’s reliance on the\n 5   existence of numerous “badges of fraud,” the bankruptcy court was\n 6   not required to believe Appellants’ version of the reasons for\n 7   the transfers.   Stated plainly, Appellants’ testimony concerning\n 8   the background for and their motivations to conclude the\n 9   transfers was consistently implausible.\n10        For example, Appellants’ contention that the timing of the\n11   subject transfers was merely the consummation of a longstanding\n12   agreement between spouses to divide the couple’s property would\n13   require a finding that the timing of the transfers right before\n14   judgment was entered against Debtor was purely and entirely\n15   coincidental, and would require the court to ignore the numerous\n16   suspicious circumstances surrounding the transactions.\n17        In light of these circumstances, any argument in support of\n18   Appellants’ version of the rationale for these transaction would\n19   have to be supported by the most indubitable evidence of their\n20   innocent intent.   Yet, Appellants offered nothing of any\n21   genuinely probative, let alone persuasive, value.   Appellants did\n22   not present any documentation of the couple’s plan to divide\n23   their property, nor did they testify to an alternative catalyst\n24   for the execution of that plan.\n25        Moreover, there is nothing about the acquisition of the\n26   Properties or the history of the financial arrangements between\n27   Appellants as a married couple that would objectively support\n28   their story that they “always intended” to hold the Properties\n\n                                    -15-\n\f 1   separately.   There was no contention that the Properties were\n 2   acquired via inheritance or with separate funds, or any other\n 3   facts that would support a claim that the Properties should have\n 4   been categorized as separate property; to the contrary, it is\n 5   undisputed that the Properties were acquired with community\n 6   assets.   Nor would the fact that the Appellants alternately paid\n 7   expenses of the Properties, depending on which of them was\n 8   gainfully employed at various points during the marriage,\n 9   described in greater detail in subsection C below, suggest a\n10   different result.   Indeed, it is the nature of a “community” that\n11   a married couple acknowledges that they will pool their resources\n12   to acquire and maintain property, and there is no requirement\n13   that the contributions of the spouses be equal or available at\n14   the same time.\n15        We note also certain inconsistencies in the documentation of\n16   the transactions that suggest an ulterior motive: first, despite\n17   Debtor’s vast experience in real estate matters, the trust\n18   transfer deeds recited that the transfers were to a revocable\n19   trust (rather than an irrevocable trust as set forth in the Trust\n20   Agreement) and designated that Debtor was the sole grantee.    Even\n21   though the Properties were held by the couple as joint tenants,\n22   there was no evidence that Ms. Brace ever transferred her\n23   interests into the Crescent Trust.    Debtor proffered no plausible\n24   explanation for these inconsistencies, which suggest that Debtor\n25   was focused on divesting himself of his interests in the\n26   Properties and confusing the state of title to shield the\n27   Properties from the impending judgment.   And as discussed below,\n28   even after the transfers, Appellants continued to treat the\n\n                                    -16-\n\f 1   Properties as their own.\n 2        In light of the foregoing, the bankruptcy court did not\n 3   clearly err in giving Debtor’s testimony little to no weight in\n 4   finding that the transfers were made with actual fraudulent\n 5   intent.   The court also supported its finding of fraudulent\n 6   intent by reference to numerous badges of fraud that accompanied\n 7   the transactions.    Moreover, the court did not need to find that\n 8   Debtor knew about the litigation or to believe Debtor’s highly\n 9   implausible “explanations” for his behavior.   The finding of\n10   actual intent to defraud is supported by the evidence and is not\n11   clearly erroneous.\n12   B.   The bankruptcy court did not err in finding that the\n          Crescent Trust was Debtor’s alter ego.\n13\n14         As an alternative theory for recovery of the Properties,\n15   the bankruptcy court found that the Crescent Trust was Debtor’s\n16   alter ego.   In determining whether the alter ego doctrine applies\n17   to eliminate any distinction between an entity and an individual\n18   controlling or dominating that entity, we apply the law of the\n19   forum state.   In re Schwartzkopf, 626 F.3d at 1037-38.\n20   California courts have applied the alter ego doctrine to trusts.\n21   Id. at 1038.   Alter ego liability exists where two conditions are\n22   met: (1) where there is such a unity of interest and ownership\n23   that the separateness of the individual and the entity has\n24   ceased; and (2) where adherence to the fiction of the separate\n25   existence of the entity would sanction a fraud or promote\n26   injustice.   See id.   Factors suggesting an alter ego relationship\n27   include: (a) commingling of assets and failure to segregate\n28   funds; (b) treatment by an individual of the assets of the\n\n                                     -17-\n\f 1   corporation as his own; (c) the disregard of legal formalities\n 2   and the failure to maintain arm’s length relationships among\n 3   related entities; and (d) the diversion of assets from a trust by\n 4   or to another person or entity, to the detriment of creditors, or\n 5   the manipulation of assets between entities so as to concentrate\n 6   the assets in one and the liabilities in another.      See id.\n 7        The bankruptcy court concluded that the Crescent Trust was\n 8   Debtor’s alter ego based on its findings that (1) the trust was\n 9   formed for a fraudulent purpose; (2) Debtor treated the trust’s\n10   assets as his own; (3) Debtor disregarded legal formalities by\n11   failing to file trust tax returns; and (4) by transferring real\n12   property into the trust, Debtor manipulated assets so as to\n13   concentrate the assets in one entity and the liabilities in\n14   another.\n15        Appellants contend that the bankruptcy court erred in\n16   finding that the Crescent Trust was an illegal trust formed for\n17   an improper purpose; thus, the second condition required for an\n18   alter ego finding was not met.    However, as discussed above, the\n19   bankruptcy court did not err in that finding.      Accordingly, we\n20   find no error in the bankruptcy court’s ultimate finding that the\n21   Crescent Trust was Debtor’s alter ego.\n22   C.   The bankruptcy court did not err in finding that Ms. Brace\n          was not a good faith transferee.\n23\n24        California Civil Code § 3439.08 states, “(a) A transfer or\n25   obligation is not voidable under paragraph (1) of subdivision (a)\n26   of Section 3439.04, against a person that took in good faith and\n27   for a reasonably equivalent value given the debtor or against any\n28   subsequent transferee or obligee.”      A defendant asserting the\n\n                                      -18-\n\f 1   existence of good faith has the burden of proof.   Plotkin v.\n 2   Pomona Valley Imports, Inc. (In re Cohen), 199 B.R. 709, 718-19\n 3   (9th Cir. BAP 1996).\n 4        1.   Good faith\n 5        It is not necessary that a defendant actually participate in\n 6   another’s fraud, or even be completely aware of the fraud, to\n 7   fail to qualify as a good faith transferee.   See id. at 719\n 8   (transferee lacks good faith if “possessed of enough knowledge of\n 9   the actual facts to induce a reasonable person to inquire further\n10   about the transaction”).   See also CyberMedia, Inc. v. Symantec\n11   Corp., 19 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1075 (N.D. Cal. 1998) (under UFTA, a\n12   transferee lacks good faith if he or she (1) colludes with the\n13   debtor or otherwise actively participates in the debtor’s\n14   fraudulent scheme, or (2) has actual knowledge of facts which\n15   would suggest to a reasonable person that the transfer was\n16   fraudulent).\n17        The bankruptcy court found that although Ms. Brace had not\n18   engineered the scheme to defraud, she participated in and\n19   benefitted from the scheme:\n20        [Ms. Brace] may not have been the one who engineered\n          this scheme to create the Crescent Trust and transfer\n21        the Debtor’s interest in the property to the trust, so\n          to defraud Mr. Brace’s creditors. But she did not act\n22        in good faith either. Maybe she didn’t act in bad\n          faith, but she participated in the scheme; and even\n23        though her testimony was conflicting, at best, she\n          continues to support her husband’s attempt at\n24        defrauding his creditors. So I don’t believe she acted\n          in good faith.\n25\n26        Appellants argue that the bankruptcy court erred in finding\n27   that Ms. Brace was not a good faith transferee because there was\n28   no evidence that she was aware of any fraudulent intent on her\n\n                                    -19-\n\f 1   husband’s part or that she had participated in the scheme.\n 2   Appellant’s first point misapprehends the applicable standard--\n 3   the bankruptcy court did not need to find that Ms. Brace was\n 4   aware of Debtor’s fraudulent intent.   And there was evidence in\n 5   the record that Ms. Brace knew of and was complicit in the\n 6   transfers.   Importantly, the bankruptcy court found not credible\n 7   Appellants’ explanations for the transfers.\n 8        Debtor and Ms. Brace testified in their declarations that\n 9   the transfers into the Crescent Trust were part of an agreement\n10   the couple made early in their marriage to keep their financial\n11   affairs separate.   Debtor testified that shortly after the couple\n12   were married they purchased the San Bernardino Property as their\n13   residence.   Debtor further testified that while Ms. Brace was in\n14   nursing school, Debtor made the payments on the residence, and\n15   that after Ms. Brace became employed the payments were made from\n16   the couple’s joint checking account.   According to Debtor,\n17   virtually all of the funds in the joint checking account were\n18   deposited by Ms. Brace because Debtor did not have regular income\n19   at that time.\n20        Debtor’s testimony continued: sometime in the 1970s the\n21   couple purchased the Redlands Property and made it their\n22   residence; the couple agreed prior to 1978 that because Ms. Brace\n23   had made the payments on the San Bernardino and Redlands\n24   properties that those properties would belong to her.\n25   Thereafter, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, Debtor purchased real\n26   properties in Moreno Valley and Palm Springs, taking title as a\n27   married man as his sole and separate property; Ms. Brace\n28   relinquished her interests in those properties.\n\n                                    -20-\n\f 1          Debtor testified that he created the trusts for estate\n 2   planning purposes and to carry out the couple’s agreement for\n 3   Ms. Brace to own the Redlands and San Bernardino properties as\n 4   her separate property and for Debtor to own the Moreno Valley and\n 5   Palm Springs properties as his separate property.\n 6          Ms. Brace testified in her declaration that the couple had a\n 7   longstanding oral agreement to keep their financial affairs\n 8   separate and that the San Bernardino and Redlands properties\n 9   would belong to Ms. Brace.    She further testified that Debtor had\n10   set up the Crescent Trust “to place his interest in my properties\n11   into an irrevocable living trust to protect that interest for\n12   me.”\n13          Our review of the record convinces us that the bankruptcy\n14   court had ample reason to be skeptical of the Appellant’s version\n15   of the background to the transfers, and support for its\n16   conclusion that Ms. Brace had not met her burden to show she was\n17   a good faith transferee.\n18          As an initial matter, we restate the point made earlier in\n19   connection with the “actual intent to defraud” analysis, that the\n20   bankruptcy court found both Debtor’s and Ms. Brace’s testimony to\n21   be not credible.    In particular, with respect to Ms. Brace’s\n22   testimony, the court stated that it was as if she were reading a\n23   script that someone (i.e., her husband) had given her--and even\n24   in this polished, scripted form, she was not at all convincing.\n25          That conclusion was not only an appropriate exercise of a\n26   trial court’s prerogative in assessing credibility, it appears\n27   entirely justified and accurate in light of Ms. Brace’s testimony\n28   on cross-examination, which repeatedly contradicted and\n\n                                     -21-\n\f 1   undermined the narrative presented in her declaration.      On cross-\n 2   examination, Ms. Brace testified that she did not remember\n 3   hearing of the Crescent Trust, did not know why Debtor\n 4   transferred his interests in the Redlands and San Bernardino\n 5   properties into the Crescent Trust, and did not remember asking\n 6   Debtor to do so.   Ms. Brace also testified that she did not\n 7   believe Debtor owed her money for the payments she had made on\n 8   the San Bernardino property mortgage or that she had paid a\n 9   disproportionate amount of the expenses on the Redlands property.\n10        The repeated and striking disharmony between the scripted\n11   narrative of Ms. Brace’s declaration and the spontaneous and\n12   apparently quite genuine answers she provided on cross-\n13   examination not only raise troubling questions about her\n14   credibility but eviscerate her claim to be a good faith\n15   transferee.   See Filip, 129 Cal. App. 4th at 836, 28 Cal. Rptr.\n16   3d at 891 (affirming trial court’s finding that defendant was not\n17   a good faith transferee because defendant’s testimony was not\n18   credible).\n19        That said, the evidence in the record supports the\n20   bankruptcy court’s finding that Ms. Brace participated in and\n21   benefitted from the transfers.    Although Ms. Brace gave\n22   conflicting testimony regarding her knowledge of the transfers,\n23   the bankruptcy court’s choice among multiple plausible views of\n24   the evidence cannot be clearly erroneous.    See Anderson v. City\n25   of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-75 (1985).    Ms. Brace\n26   testified that she was aware that her husband had set up the\n27   Crescent Trust “to place his interest in my properties into an\n28   irrevocable living trust to protect that interest for me.”     And\n\n                                      -22-\n\f 1   the transfers benefitted Ms. Brace because they effectively\n 2   conveyed to Ms. Brace her husband’s interests in the transferred\n 3   properties.    Although the bankruptcy court did not explicitly\n 4   find that Ms. Brace was possessed of enough knowledge to put a\n 5   reasonable person on inquiry notice, the record supports such a\n 6   finding.   Ms. Brace knew about the transfers, and, as discussed\n 7   in subsection A.1.c. above, no plausible explanation was provided\n 8   for the timing of the transfers or the irregularities in the\n 9   documentation of the transactions, and Appellants continued to\n10   treat the transferred properties as their own even after the\n11   transfers.    Under these circumstances, Ms. Brace was on notice\n12   that Debtor may have had a fraudulent motive in making the\n13   transfers.\n14        For all of these reasons, the bankruptcy court did not err\n15   in finding that Appellants had failed to meet their burden of\n16   showing that Ms. Brace acted in good faith.\n17        2.    Reasonably Equivalent Value\n18        The bankruptcy court correctly found that there was\n19   insufficient evidence from which to make a finding that Ms. Brace\n20   gave reasonably equivalent value for the transfers.    The only\n21   valuation evidence presented was Debtor’s opinion testimony, to\n22   which the bankruptcy court gave no weight: there was no basis to\n23   conclude that Debtor was an expert in real property valuations,\n24   and the bankruptcy court found implausible that Debtor knew\n25   during the bankruptcy what the transferred properties were worth\n26   in 2004.\n27        Appellants argue that the undisputed fact that Debtor\n28   obtained a $240,000 credit line against his Palm Springs property\n\n                                     -23-\n\f 1   shortly after it was acquired supports an inference that the Palm\n 2   Springs property was worth an amount reasonably equivalent to the\n 3   approximately $527,000 of equity transferred by Debtor to the\n 4   Crescent Trust.   The bankruptcy court gave little weight to this\n 5   evidence, observing that in 2004 lending standards were more\n 6   relaxed, thus implicitly finding that any extrapolation of value\n 7   from the amount of the credit line would be inherently\n 8   unreliable.\n 9        Appellants argue that the bankruptcy court’s observation\n10   regarding 2004 lending standards was speculative and not\n11   supported by evidence, but even if we were to disregard that\n12   observation, we would not find error in the bankruptcy court’s\n13   conclusion.   In fact, a finding of value of real property based\n14   solely on the amount a lender would loan against it would\n15   constitute speculation, as the amount that a particular lender\n16   would loan is subject to a number of factors.   More importantly,\n17   the bankruptcy court rejected Debtor’s opinion evidence of the\n18   value of the Redlands and San Bernardino properties, making\n19   impossible any finding as to whether Ms. Brace gave “reasonably\n20   equivalent” value.\n21        Therefore, we find no error in the bankruptcy court’s\n22   conclusion that Appellants failed to carry their burden of\n23   proving a good faith transferee defense.\n24                               CONCLUSION\n25        For these reasons, the bankruptcy court did not err in\n26   concluding that the transfers into the Crescent Trust were\n27   actually fraudulent, that the Crescent Trust was Debtor’s alter\n28   ego, or that Ms. Brace was not a good faith transferee.\n\n                                    -24-\n\f 1   Accordingly, we AFFIRM.\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n                               -25-\n\f",

At the time of the transfers, Debtor\n 7   was a defendant in state court litigation; a default judgment was\n 8   entered in that litigation shortly after the transfers.      Debtor\n 9   and his spouse testified that the transfers were for her sole\n10   benefit as part of long-contemplated estate planning, and from\n11   the face of the relevant documents, the transfers to the trust\n12   appeared to be for the sole benefit of Debtor’s spouse.      Post-\n13   transfer, however, Debtor and his spouse ignored the stated\n14   purpose of the transfers and continued to treat the trust\n15   property as they had pre-transfer.\n16        After Debtor filed his chapter 71 petition, the trustee\n17   filed an adversary proceeding against Debtor and his non-debtor\n18   spouse seeking to avoid the transfers under the California\n19   Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (“CUFTA”) and other theories.\n20   After a one-day trial, the bankruptcy court entered judgment in\n21   favor of the chapter 7 trustee.    On reconsideration, the\n22   bankruptcy court amended the judgment to clarify that while the\n23\n24        **\n            Hon.

Consequently, the court determined that\n 6   the estate held the entire interest in all of the properties that\n 7   had been improperly transferred to the trust.\n 8        Debtor and his spouse appeal the bankruptcy court’s findings\n 9   that the transfers were avoidable as actually fraudulent\n10   transfers and that the estate has a deemed community property\n11   interest in the recovered properties.\n12        In this unpublished memorandum, we AFFIRM the decision of\n13   the bankruptcy court with respect to its findings that the\n14   transfers were avoidable as actually fraudulent transfers.    In a\n15   separate published opinion, we also AFFIRM the bankruptcy court’s\n16   ruling that the recovered properties were restored to community\n17   property status and thus were fully recoverable by the bankruptcy\n18   estate.\n19                                  FACTS\n20   A.   Pre-Petition Events\n21        Debtor and his non-debtor spouse, Anh N. Brace, were married\n22   in 1972.   Debtor is a real estate consultant with approximately\n23   30 years of experience as a licensed real estate agent, broker,\n24   and consultant.   During the marriage, Appellants acquired their\n25   residence in Redlands, California, a rental property in San\n26   Bernardino, California, and a parcel of real property in Mohave,\n27   Arizona (collectively, the “Properties”).   Appellants took title\n28   to each of the Properties as “husband and wife as joint tenants.”\n\n                                     -3-\n\f 1        On July 30, 2004, Debtor formed the Crescent Trust.    The\n 2   instrument creating the Crescent Trust states that it is an\n 3   irrevocable trust and that Debtor is the sole trustee; Ms. Brace\n 4   is the sole beneficiary of the trust.    The trust instrument was\n 5   not recorded.   Shortly thereafter, Debtor executed and had\n 6   recorded trust transfer deeds transferring his interests in the\n 7   Redlands and San Bernardino properties into the Crescent Trust\n 8   for no consideration.   Additionally, the box on each deed was\n 9   checked indicating that the transfer was to a revocable trust.\n10   Thus, although the unrecorded trust instrument for the Crescent\n11   Trust appeared to place the trust assets out of the reach of\n12   creditors, the public record reflected that the trust was\n13   revocable and thus its assets were potentially subject to\n14   execution by creditors and subject to disposition by the trustor.\n15   See Laycock v. Hammer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29-30 (2006) (in\n16   order to reach trust assets, creditor must show that trust was\n17   revocable); Cal. Prob. Code § 18200.\n18        For reasons that were not explained, Ms. Brace did not\n19   transfer her interests in the Redlands and San Bernardino\n20   properties into the Crescent Trust.     Also, no deed transferring\n21   the Mohave property was ever recorded, although Debtor testified\n22   that such a deed was prepared.    In the parties’ joint pre-trial\n23   statement, Appellants stipulated that the Mohave property was an\n24   asset of the bankruptcy estate.\n25        At the time of the transfers, Debtor was a defendant in\n26   litigation in San Bernardino County Superior Court; a default\n27   judgment in the amount of $60,000 was entered against the Debtor\n28   in that litigation approximately one month after the transfers\n\n                                       -4-\n\f 1   occurred.\n 2        After the Redlands and San Bernardino properties were\n 3   transferred into the Crescent Trust, Debtor and Ms. Brace\n 4   continued to live in the Redlands property; they also used those\n 5   properties to secure bail bonds in a criminal matter.    Debtor\n 6   never filed tax returns for the Crescent Trust.2\n 7   B.   Post-Petition Events\n 8        Debtor filed a chapter 7 petition on May 16, 2011, and\n 9   Robert L. Goodrich was appointed chapter 7 trustee (“Trustee”).3\n10   Debtor did not list any real property on Schedule A.    At Debtor’s\n11   341 meeting, he testified that he had owned no real property in\n12   the prior two years.    He also testified that Ms. Brace owned no\n13   property that was not listed in his schedules.\n14        On December 15, 2011, Trustee filed an adversary proceeding\n15   against Appellants, individually and in their capacities as\n16   trustees of the Crescent Trust,4 seeking:    a declaration that the\n17   Properties were property of the bankruptcy estate; a judgment\n18   quieting title to the Properties in the bankruptcy estate;\n19   turnover of any of the Properties determined to be property of\n20\n          2\n            At the time he formed the Crescent Trust, Debtor owned two\n21\n     other parcels of real property, one in Palm Springs and the other\n22   in Moreno Valley, which he held as his sole and separate\n     property. Concurrently with the formation of the Crescent Trust,\n23   Debtor formed two additional trusts, the Cardillo Trust and the\n     Casilla Trust. Debtor transferred into those trusts his\n24   interests in the Palm Springs and Moreno Valley properties,\n     respectively.\n25\n          3\n26          Appellee Steven M. Speier was substituted as chapter 7\n     trustee after Mr. Goodrich resigned in December 2015.\n27\n          4\n              As noted, Ms. Brace is not a trustee of the Crescent\n28   Trust.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f 1   the estate; and avoidance and recovery of Debtor’s transfers of\n 2   the Redlands and San Bernardino properties into the Crescent\n 3   Trust as actually and/or constructively fraudulent transfers\n 4   under Cal. Civ. Code § 3439.04(a) (collectively, the “Fraudulent\n 5   Transfer Claims”); and revocation of Debtor’s discharge under\n 6   §§ 727(d)(1) and (d)(2).\n 7        The bankruptcy court ordered the issues bifurcated for trial\n 8   pursuant to Civil Rule 42(b), applicable via Rule 7042, with the\n 9   Fraudulent Transfer Claims being tried before the revocation of\n10   discharge claims.    Trial was held on the Fraudulent Transfer\n11   Claims on May 11, 2015.    The witnesses were Debtor, Ms. Brace,\n12   Trustee, and Burke Huber, an attorney who authenticated Debtor’s\n13   deposition testimony from a separate lawsuit.    Direct testimony\n14   was by declaration;5 Debtor, Ms. Brace, and Trustee were cross-\n15   examined at trial.    The bankruptcy court thereafter made oral\n16   findings and conclusions in favor of Trustee on the actually\n17   fraudulent transfer claim.\n18        The bankruptcy court found: that the Crescent Trust was an\n19   illegal trust and should be disregarded because Debtor had\n20   created it for the sole purpose of defrauding creditors; that the\n21   transfers of the Redlands and San Bernardino properties into the\n22   Crescent Trust were actually fraudulent transfers; that the\n23   Crescent Trust was Debtor’s alter ego; that Ms. Brace was not a\n24   good faith transferee; and that the Trustee was entitled to avoid\n25   the unrecorded transfer of the Mohave property as a hypothetical\n26\n          5\n27          The bankruptcy court sustained certain objections to the\n     declaration testimony. No party has assigned error to those\n28   rulings.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f 1   bona fide purchaser under § 544.    For all of these reasons, the\n 2   bankruptcy court concluded that the transfers of the Redlands and\n 3   San Bernardino properties into the Crescent Trust were avoidable\n 4   and recoverable by Trustee as property of the estate.\n 5        The court entered judgment on September 25, 2015.   The\n 6   judgment provided that the Properties were property of the estate\n 7   and were to be turned over to Trustee.    Defendants timely moved\n 8   to reconsider and amend the judgment, arguing that the judgment\n 9   should have provided that the Properties were owned one half by\n10   Debtor and one half by Ms. Brace as tenants in common and that\n11   only Debtor’s interests in the Properties, and not Ms. Brace’s,\n12   were property of the estate.   After oral argument, the bankruptcy\n13   court issued its findings on the record, granting the motion to\n14   reconsider in part: the bankruptcy court entered an amended\n15   judgment clarifying that although the Properties were restored to\n16   joint tenancy as a matter of title, they were community property\n17   under California law and were thus property of the estate.\n18        Appellants timely appealed.6\n19                             JURISDICTION\n20        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n21   §§ 1334 and 157(b)(2)(E), (H), and (J).

The bankruptcy court correctly found that the transfers\n               were made with actual fraudulent intent.\n27\n28        California Civil Code § 3439.04 provides:\n\n                                        -8-\n\f 1             (a) A transfer made or obligation incurred by a\n          debtor is voidable as to a creditor, whether the\n 2        creditor’s claim arose before or after the transfer was\n          made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made\n 3        the transfer or incurred the obligation as follows:\n 4             (1) With actual intent to hinder, delay, or\n          defraud any creditor of the debtor.\n 5\n 6        The statute further provides that, in determining actual\n 7   intent to defraud, the court may consider the following factors:\n 8             (1) Whether the transfer or obligation was to an\n          insider.\n 9\n               (2) Whether the debtor retained possession or\n10        control of the property transferred after the transfer.\n11             (3) Whether the transfer or obligation was\n          disclosed or concealed.\n12\n               (4) Whether before the transfer was made or\n13        obligation was incurred, the debtor had been sued or\n          threatened with suit.\n14\n               (5) Whether the transfer was of substantially all\n15        the debtor’s assets.\n16             (6) Whether the debtor absconded.\n17             (7) Whether the debtor removed or concealed\n          assets.\n18\n               (8) Whether the value of the consideration\n19        received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the\n          value of the asset transferred or the amount of the\n20        obligation incurred.\n21             (9) Whether the debtor was insolvent or became\n          insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the\n22        obligation was incurred.\n23             (10) Whether the transfer occurred shortly before\n          or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred.\n24\n               (11) Whether the debtor transferred the essential\n25        assets of the business to a lienor that transferred the\n          assets to an insider of the debtor.\n26\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">Civ</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Specifically, the\n13   bankruptcy court found that the following factors supported a\n14   finding of actual fraud: (1) the transfers to the Crescent Trust\n15   were to an insider because Ms. Brace was the sole beneficiary of\n16   the Crescent Trust; (2) the Debtor retained possession and\n17   control of the transferred properties–-he continued to live in\n18   the Redlands Property, and Debtor used the San Bernardino\n19   Property as collateral to post bonds for himself and a friend in\n20   criminal matters; (3) the Debtor concealed the nature of the\n21   transfers by claiming on the trust transfer deeds that the\n22   properties were transferred into a revocable trust; (4) at the\n23   time of the transfers the Debtor was a defendant in state court\n24   litigation; (5) the Debtor removed or concealed the properties by\n25   transferring them to the Crescent Trust; and (6) the Debtor\n26   transferred the properties shortly before a substantial debt was\n27   incurred, that is, the entry of the $60,000 default judgment.\n28        Appellants argue that the bankruptcy court’s finding of\n\n                                   -10-\n\f 1   actual fraudulent intent was clearly erroneous because there was\n 2   no evidence that Debtor had notice of the state court lawsuit\n 3   which resulted in entry of the default judgment.   Debtor\n 4   testified that he did not know of the lawsuit because he was not\n 5   personally served with the summons and complaint in that action,\n 6   which were served only by publication.   Additionally, as\n 7   discussed below, Appellants contend that the transfers to the\n 8   Crescent Trust were done for estate planning purposes and to\n 9   memorialize the couple’s longstanding agreement for Ms. Brace to\n10   hold title to the Properties.\n11        These arguments are not persuasive; they ignore the trial\n12   court’s function in assessing credibility of witnesses and this\n13   Panel’s duty to defer to that assessment, and they misconstrue\n14   the rationale for the court’s reliance on “badges of fraud” to\n15   assess fraudulent intent.\n16        As should be obvious, fraudulent intent is not readily\n17   conceded and, for that reason among others, not easily proven.\n18   In these instances, courts have access to two tools to assist\n19   them in determining fraudulent intent: (1) assessment of a\n20   witness’s credibility via observing his or her demeanor and\n21   testimony at trial, and (2) consideration of the “badges of\n22   fraud” that provide essentially a checklist of the circumstances\n23   that typically surround fraudulent acts.\n24        a.   This Panel must defer to the trial court’s findings\n               regarding credibility.\n25\n26        At the outset of its ruling, the bankruptcy court observed\n27   that neither Debtor nor Ms. Brace were credible witnesses.    The\n28   bankruptcy court noted that Debtor was “alert, educated, [and]\n\n                                     -11-\n\f 1   sophisticated” but that he had a “very selective memory”: he had\n 2   good recall of events that were in his favor, but his memory\n 3   failed him when he was questioned by Trustee’s counsel.\n 4   Regarding Ms. Brace, the bankruptcy court noted that she\n 5   testified “like she was reading a script that her husband or\n 6   someone gave her to say.    But even then, she was neither\n 7   convincing nor credible.”\n 8        We must defer to the bankruptcy court’s credibility\n 9   determination to the extent it was based on the witnesses’\n10   demeanor.\n11        When factual findings are based on determinations\n          regarding the credibility of witnesses, we give great\n12        deference to the bankruptcy court’s findings, because\n          the bankruptcy court, as the trier of fact, had the\n13        opportunity to note variations in demeanor and tone of\n          voice that bear so heavily on the listener’s\n14        understanding of and belief in what is said.\n15   Retz v.

Boxes, created false names,\n 3        and false entities in order to evade service. . . . I\n          am not certain that Defendants JUAN GARCIA, WALTER\n 4        HARRIS, NANCY NETTER, C. ALLEN, or CLIFF BRACE are even\n          real people. I have been unable to find any\n 5        information that they exist.7\n 6\n     In granting the request, the state court necessarily found that\n 7\n     defendants had a history of evading service, which warranted\n 8\n     service by publication.\n 9\n          Because there is nothing in the record to suggest that the\n10\n     bankruptcy court’s credibility determinations were erroneous, we\n11\n     defer to those determinations.\n12\n          b.   The bankruptcy court correctly applied the “badges of\n13             fraud” to determine that the Debtor made the transfers\n               with actual intent to defraud creditors.\n14\n15        Appellants claim that the trial court incorrectly determined\n16   that the transfers were made with actual intent to defraud,\n17   because there was no evidence that Debtor knew about the pending\n18   state court claim at the time of the transfers.   This assertion\n19   is erroneous.\n20        First, Appellants ignore the fact that the trial court found\n21   that six separate badges of fraud were present with respect to\n22   the challenged transfers and that only two related to the\n23   existence of litigation: whether Debtor had been sued before the\n24   transfer was made and whether the transfer occurred shortly\n25   before a substantial debt was incurred.   Thus, even if we agreed\n26\n          7\n27          Debtor admitted at trial that he had used the names\n     “C. Allen,” “Robert Keller,” and “David Walton” as aliases for\n28   various purposes.\n\n                                      -13-\n\f 1   with Appellants that the trial court wrongly relied on the\n 2   existence of litigation, or the imminent entry of a judgment, as\n 3   badges of fraud, there was ample, and unchallenged, support in\n 4   the record for a finding of fraudulent intent; there are four\n 5   additional badges of fraud present here.\n 6        Second, and as noted above, the bankruptcy court need not\n 7   find the presence of a majority, or even any set number, of the\n 8   enumerated badges of fraud to conclude that a party likely\n 9   engaged in fraud.   Rather, the court is entitled to conclude that\n10   a party acted with actual intent to defraud creditors based on\n11   the court’s reasonable assessment of all the facts and\n12   circumstances; the badges of fraud are merely a tool to assist in\n13   that task.\n14        Third, Debtor’s premise that unless the court could\n15   essentially demonstrate that the Debtor “knew” a fact that he\n16   denied knowing, it could not conclude that he had acted with\n17   fraudulent intent, requires exactly the sort of impossible\n18   “seeing inside the debtor’s conscience” that the legislature\n19   sought to avoid by compiling the badges of fraud.   To require\n20   demonstrable certainty of a debtor’s knowledge would completely\n21   obviate the utility of consideration of circumstantial, and\n22   reliable, evidence.   See In re Beverly, 374 B.R. at 235 (“Since\n23   direct evidence of intent to hinder, delay or defraud is\n24   uncommon, the determination typically is made inferentially from\n25   circumstances consistent with the requisite intent.”) (citing\n26   Filip v.

The bankruptcy court was not required to believe\n               Debtor’s wholly implausible explanation for the\n 2             transfers.\n 3        Putting aside Debtor’s courtroom demeanor and history of\n 4   deceptive practices, as well as the court’s reliance on the\n 5   existence of numerous “badges of fraud,” the bankruptcy court was\n 6   not required to believe Appellants’ version of the reasons for\n 7   the transfers.   Stated plainly, Appellants’ testimony concerning\n 8   the background for and their motivations to conclude the\n 9   transfers was consistently implausible.\n10        For example, Appellants’ contention that the timing of the\n11   subject transfers was merely the consummation of a longstanding\n12   agreement between spouses to divide the couple’s property would\n13   require a finding that the timing of the transfers right before\n14   judgment was entered against Debtor was purely and entirely\n15   coincidental, and would require the court to ignore the numerous\n16   suspicious circumstances surrounding the transactions.\n17        In light of these circumstances, any argument in support of\n18   Appellants’ version of the rationale for these transaction would\n19   have to be supported by the most indubitable evidence of their\n20   innocent intent.   Yet, Appellants offered nothing of any\n21   genuinely probative, let alone persuasive, value.   Appellants did\n22   not present any documentation of the couple’s plan to divide\n23   their property, nor did they testify to an alternative catalyst\n24   for the execution of that plan.\n25        Moreover, there is nothing about the acquisition of the\n26   Properties or the history of the financial arrangements between\n27   Appellants as a married couple that would objectively support\n28   their story that they “always intended” to hold the Properties\n\n                                    -15-\n\f 1   separately.   There was no contention that the Properties were\n 2   acquired via inheritance or with separate funds, or any other\n 3   facts that would support a claim that the Properties should have\n 4   been categorized as separate property; to the contrary, it is\n 5   undisputed that the Properties were acquired with community\n 6   assets.   Nor would the fact that the Appellants alternately paid\n 7   expenses of the Properties, depending on which of them was\n 8   gainfully employed at various points during the marriage,\n 9   described in greater detail in subsection C below, suggest a\n10   different result.   Indeed, it is the nature of a “community” that\n11   a married couple acknowledges that they will pool their resources\n12   to acquire and maintain property, and there is no requirement\n13   that the contributions of the spouses be equal or available at\n14   the same time.\n15        We note also certain inconsistencies in the documentation of\n16   the transactions that suggest an ulterior motive: first, despite\n17   Debtor’s vast experience in real estate matters, the trust\n18   transfer deeds recited that the transfers were to a revocable\n19   trust (rather than an irrevocable trust as set forth in the Trust\n20   Agreement) and designated that Debtor was the sole grantee.    Even\n21   though the Properties were held by the couple as joint tenants,\n22   there was no evidence that Ms. Brace ever transferred her\n23   interests into the Crescent Trust.    Debtor proffered no plausible\n24   explanation for these inconsistencies, which suggest that Debtor\n25   was focused on divesting himself of his interests in the\n26   Properties and confusing the state of title to shield the\n27   Properties from the impending judgment.   And as discussed below,\n28   even after the transfers, Appellants continued to treat the\n\n                                    -16-\n\f 1   Properties as their own.\n 2        In light of the foregoing, the bankruptcy court did not\n 3   clearly err in giving Debtor’s testimony little to no weight in\n 4   finding that the transfers were made with actual fraudulent\n 5   intent.   The court also supported its finding of fraudulent\n 6   intent by reference to numerous badges of fraud that accompanied\n 7   the transactions.    Moreover, the court did not need to find that\n 8   Debtor knew about the litigation or to believe Debtor’s highly\n 9   implausible “explanations” for his behavior.   The finding of\n10   actual intent to defraud is supported by the evidence and is not\n11   clearly erroneous.\n12   B.   The bankruptcy court did not err in finding that the\n          Crescent Trust was Debtor’s alter ego.\n13\n14         As an alternative theory for recovery of the Properties,\n15   the bankruptcy court found that the Crescent Trust was Debtor’s\n16   alter ego.   In determining whether the alter ego doctrine applies\n17   to eliminate any distinction between an entity and an individual\n18   controlling or dominating that entity, we apply the law of the\n19   forum state.   In re Schwartzkopf, 626 F.3d at 1037-38.\n20   California courts have applied the alter ego doctrine to trusts.\n21   Id. at 1038.   Alter ego liability exists where two conditions are\n22   met: (1) where there is such a unity of interest and ownership\n23   that the separateness of the individual and the entity has\n24   ceased; and (2) where adherence to the fiction of the separate\n25   existence of the entity would sanction a fraud or promote\n26   injustice.   See id.   Factors suggesting an alter ego relationship\n27   include: (a) commingling of assets and failure to segregate\n28   funds; (b) treatment by an individual of the assets of the\n\n                                     -17-\n\f 1   corporation as his own; (c) the disregard of legal formalities\n 2   and the failure to maintain arm’s length relationships among\n 3   related entities; and (d) the diversion of assets from a trust by\n 4   or to another person or entity, to the detriment of creditors, or\n 5   the manipulation of assets between entities so as to concentrate\n 6   the assets in one and the liabilities in another.      See id.\n 7        The bankruptcy court concluded that the Crescent Trust was\n 8   Debtor’s alter ego based on its findings that (1) the trust was\n 9   formed for a fraudulent purpose; (2) Debtor treated the trust’s\n10   assets as his own; (3) Debtor disregarded legal formalities by\n11   failing to file trust tax returns; and (4) by transferring real\n12   property into the trust, Debtor manipulated assets so as to\n13   concentrate the assets in one entity and the liabilities in\n14   another.\n15        Appellants contend that the bankruptcy court erred in\n16   finding that the Crescent Trust was an illegal trust formed for\n17   an improper purpose; thus, the second condition required for an\n18   alter ego finding was not met.    However, as discussed above, the\n19   bankruptcy court did not err in that finding.      Accordingly, we\n20   find no error in the bankruptcy court’s ultimate finding that the\n21   Crescent Trust was Debtor’s alter ego.\n22   C.   The bankruptcy court did not err in finding that Ms. Brace\n          was not a good faith transferee.\n23\n24        California Civil Code § 3439.08 states, “(a) A transfer or\n25   obligation is not voidable under paragraph (1) of subdivision (a)\n26   of Section 3439.04, against a person that took in good faith and\n27   for a reasonably equivalent value given the debtor or against any\n28   subsequent transferee or obligee.”      A defendant asserting the\n\n                                      -18-\n\f 1   existence of good faith has the burden of proof.

Cal. 1998) (under UFTA, a\n12   transferee lacks good faith if he or she (1) colludes with the\n13   debtor or otherwise actively participates in the debtor’s\n14   fraudulent scheme, or (2) has actual knowledge of facts which\n15   would suggest to a reasonable person that the transfer was\n16   fraudulent).\n17        The bankruptcy court found that although Ms. Brace had not\n18   engineered the scheme to defraud, she participated in and\n19   benefitted from the scheme:\n20        [Ms. Brace] may not have been the one who engineered\n          this scheme to create the Crescent Trust and transfer\n21        the Debtor’s interest in the property to the trust, so\n          to defraud Mr. Brace’s creditors. But she did not act\n22        in good faith either. Maybe she didn’t act in bad\n          faith, but she participated in the scheme; and even\n23        though her testimony was conflicting, at best, she\n          continues to support her husband’s attempt at\n24        defrauding his creditors. So I don’t believe she acted\n          in good faith.\n25\n26        Appellants argue that the bankruptcy court erred in finding\n27   that Ms. Brace was not a good faith transferee because there was\n28   no evidence that she was aware of any fraudulent intent on her\n\n                                    -19-\n\f 1   husband’s part or that she had participated in the scheme.\n 2   Appellant’s first point misapprehends the applicable standard--\n 3   the bankruptcy court did not need to find that Ms. Brace was\n 4   aware of Debtor’s fraudulent intent.   And there was evidence in\n 5   the record that Ms. Brace knew of and was complicit in the\n 6   transfers.   Importantly, the bankruptcy court found not credible\n 7   Appellants’ explanations for the transfers.\n 8        Debtor and Ms. Brace testified in their declarations that\n 9   the transfers into the Crescent Trust were part of an agreement\n10   the couple made early in their marriage to keep their financial\n11   affairs separate.   Debtor testified that shortly after the couple\n12   were married they purchased the San Bernardino Property as their\n13   residence.   Debtor further testified that while Ms. Brace was in\n14   nursing school, Debtor made the payments on the residence, and\n15   that after Ms. Brace became employed the payments were made from\n16   the couple’s joint checking account.   According to Debtor,\n17   virtually all of the funds in the joint checking account were\n18   deposited by Ms. Brace because Debtor did not have regular income\n19   at that time.\n20        Debtor’s testimony continued: sometime in the 1970s the\n21   couple purchased the Redlands Property and made it their\n22   residence; the couple agreed prior to 1978 that because Ms. Brace\n23   had made the payments on the San Bernardino and Redlands\n24   properties that those properties would belong to her.\n25   Thereafter, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, Debtor purchased real\n26   properties in Moreno Valley and Palm Springs, taking title as a\n27   married man as his sole and separate property; Ms. Brace\n28   relinquished her interests in those properties.\n\n                                    -20-\n\f 1          Debtor testified that he created the trusts for estate\n 2   planning purposes and to carry out the couple’s agreement for\n 3   Ms. Brace to own the Redlands and San Bernardino properties as\n 4   her separate property and for Debtor to own the Moreno Valley and\n 5   Palm Springs properties as his separate property.\n 6          Ms. Brace testified in her declaration that the couple had a\n 7   longstanding oral agreement to keep their financial affairs\n 8   separate and that the San Bernardino and Redlands properties\n 9   would belong to Ms. Brace.    She further testified that Debtor had\n10   set up the Crescent Trust “to place his interest in my properties\n11   into an irrevocable living trust to protect that interest for\n12   me.”\n13          Our review of the record convinces us that the bankruptcy\n14   court had ample reason to be skeptical of the Appellant’s version\n15   of the background to the transfers, and support for its\n16   conclusion that Ms. Brace had not met her burden to show she was\n17   a good faith transferee.\n18          As an initial matter, we restate the point made earlier in\n19   connection with the “actual intent to defraud” analysis, that the\n20   bankruptcy court found both Debtor’s and Ms. Brace’s testimony to\n21   be not credible.    In particular, with respect to Ms. Brace’s\n22   testimony, the court stated that it was as if she were reading a\n23   script that someone (i.e., her husband) had given her--and even\n24   in this polished, scripted form, she was not at all convincing.\n25          That conclusion was not only an appropriate exercise of a\n26   trial court’s prerogative in assessing credibility, it appears\n27   entirely justified and accurate in light of Ms. Brace’s testimony\n28   on cross-examination, which repeatedly contradicted and\n\n                                     -21-\n\f 1   undermined the narrative presented in her declaration.      On cross-\n 2   examination, Ms. Brace testified that she did not remember\n 3   hearing of the Crescent Trust, did not know why Debtor\n 4   transferred his interests in the Redlands and San Bernardino\n 5   properties into the Crescent Trust, and did not remember asking\n 6   Debtor to do so.   Ms. Brace also testified that she did not\n 7   believe Debtor owed her money for the payments she had made on\n 8   the San Bernardino property mortgage or that she had paid a\n 9   disproportionate amount of the expenses on the Redlands property.\n10        The repeated and striking disharmony between the scripted\n11   narrative of Ms. Brace’s declaration and the spontaneous and\n12   apparently quite genuine answers she provided on cross-\n13   examination not only raise troubling questions about her\n14   credibility but eviscerate her claim to be a good faith\n15   transferee.

Although Ms. Brace gave\n22   conflicting testimony regarding her knowledge of the transfers,\n23   the bankruptcy court’s choice among multiple plausible views of\n24   the evidence cannot be clearly erroneous.    See Anderson v. City\n25   of Bessemer City, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573-75 (1985).    Ms. Brace\n26   testified that she was aware that her husband had set up the\n27   Crescent Trust “to place his interest in my properties into an\n28   irrevocable living trust to protect that interest for me.”     And\n\n                                      -22-\n\f 1   the transfers benefitted Ms. Brace because they effectively\n 2   conveyed to Ms. Brace her husband’s interests in the transferred\n 3   properties.    Although the bankruptcy court did not explicitly\n 4   find that Ms. Brace was possessed of enough knowledge to put a\n 5   reasonable person on inquiry notice, the record supports such a\n 6   finding.   Ms. Brace knew about the transfers, and, as discussed\n 7   in subsection A.1.c. above, no plausible explanation was provided\n 8   for the timing of the transfers or the irregularities in the\n 9   documentation of the transactions, and Appellants continued to\n10   treat the transferred properties as their own even after the\n11   transfers.    Under these circumstances, Ms. Brace was on notice\n12   that Debtor may have had a fraudulent motive in making the\n13   transfers.\n14        For all of these reasons, the bankruptcy court did not err\n15   in finding that Appellants had failed to meet their burden of\n16   showing that Ms. Brace acted in good faith.\n17        2.    Reasonably Equivalent Value\n18        The bankruptcy court correctly found that there was\n19   insufficient evidence from which to make a finding that Ms. Brace\n20   gave reasonably equivalent value for the transfers.    The only\n21   valuation evidence presented was Debtor’s opinion testimony, to\n22   which the bankruptcy court gave no weight: there was no basis to\n23   conclude that Debtor was an expert in real property valuations,\n24   and the bankruptcy court found implausible that Debtor knew\n25   during the bankruptcy what the transferred properties were worth\n26   in 2004.\n27        Appellants argue that the undisputed fact that Debtor\n28   obtained a $240,000 credit line against his Palm Springs property\n\n                                     -23-\n\f 1   shortly after it was acquired supports an inference that the Palm\n 2   Springs property was worth an amount reasonably equivalent to the\n 3   approximately $527,000 of equity transferred by Debtor to the\n 4   Crescent Trust.   The bankruptcy court gave little weight to this\n 5   evidence, observing that in 2004 lending standards were more\n 6   relaxed, thus implicitly finding that any extrapolation of value\n 7   from the amount of the credit line would be inherently\n 8   unreliable.\n 9        Appellants argue that the bankruptcy court’s observation\n10   regarding 2004 lending standards was speculative and not\n11   supported by evidence, but even if we were to disregard that\n12   observation, we would not find error in the bankruptcy court’s\n13   conclusion.   In fact, a finding of value of real property based\n14   solely on the amount a lender would loan against it would\n15   constitute speculation, as the amount that a particular lender\n16   would loan is subject to a number of factors.   More importantly,\n17   the bankruptcy court rejected Debtor’s opinion evidence of the\n18   value of the Redlands and San Bernardino properties, making\n19   impossible any finding as to whether Ms. Brace gave “reasonably\n20   equivalent” value.\n21        Therefore, we find no error in the bankruptcy court’s\n22   conclusion that Appellants failed to carry their burden of\n23   proving a good faith transferee defense.\n24                               CONCLUSION\n25        For these reasons, the bankruptcy court did not err in\n26   concluding that the transfers into the Crescent Trust were\n27   actually fraudulent, that the Crescent Trust was Debtor’s alter\n28   ego, or that Ms. Brace was not a good faith transferee.\n\n                                    -24-\n\f 1   Accordingly, we AFFIRM.\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n                               -25-\n\f</pre>",
