Sanchez, District Judge\n\nBennett J. Baur, Chief Public Defender\nJ.K. Theodosia Johnson, Assistant Appellate Defender\nSanta Fe, NM\n\nfor Appellant\n\nHector H. Balderas, Attorney General\nSteven H. Johnston, Assistant Attorney General\nSanta Fe, NM\n\nfor Appellee\n\n                                       OPINION\n\nCHÁVEZ, Justice.\n\n{1}      Defendant Anthony Samora was accused of luring a sixteen-year-old male into his\ntruck by deception, driving him to a secluded location in Albuquerque, and then forcibly\npenetrating him in the anus. A jury convicted Defendant of second-degree criminal sexual\npenetration in the commission of a felony (CSP-felony), contrary to NMSA 1978, Section\n30-9-11(E)(5) (2007, amended 2009), and first-degree kidnapping, contrary to NMSA 1978,\nSection 30-4-1(A)(4) (2003). Due to sentencing enhancements, Defendant was sentenced\nto life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after thirty years for his CSP-felony\n\n                                           1\n\fconviction plus a consecutive eighteen-year sentence for his kidnapping conviction. In this\ndirect appeal, Defendant brings a variety of challenges to both convictions, including a\nchallenge to the district court for omitting that the sexual act must have been non-consensual\nwhen instructing the jury on CSP-felony.\n\n{2}     Because we conclude that it was fundamental error to omit the phrase “without\nconsent” from the jury instructions relevant to CSP-felony, we must reverse Defendant’s\nCSP conviction. The same fundamental error also infected the jury’s findings with respect\nto Defendant’s intent to inflict a sexual offense against the alleged victim, and we must\ntherefore also reverse Defendant’s kidnapping conviction. Accordingly, we remand this case\nto the district court, where Defendant may be retried on both charges.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n{3}     J.Z.1 was at a bus stop in downtown Albuquerque “bugging people for money” so\nthat he could catch a bus home. Defendant approached him, stated that he knew J.Z.’s\nfamily, and offered to give J.Z. a ride home. J.Z. got into Defendant’s pickup truck, and\nDefendant started driving.\n\n{4}      J.Z. testified that he soon noticed that Defendant was not driving J.Z. toward his\nhouse. J.Z. told Defendant he was driving the wrong way, and Defendant did not respond.\nDefendant eventually stopped the truck in a remote location under a highway underpass.\nDefendant then punched J.Z. in the head, and J.Z. became “dizzy.” Defendant pulled down\nJ.Z.’s pants, maneuvered him into a receptive position, got on top of J.Z., and penetrated\nJ.Z.’s anus with his penis. J.Z. further testified that he tried to escape by opening the\npassenger-side door of Defendant’s truck, but the door would not open. After a few minutes\nDefendant ejaculated and said, “Now I can take you home.” Defendant dropped off J.Z. on\nthe west side of Albuquerque at a gas station near a Walmart. J.Z. testified that he was afraid\nto call the police because he did not want to be arrested for a probation violation. He also\ntestified that he fought back throughout the encounter but that Defendant threw him around\nand overpowered him. J.Z. was sixteen years old at the time of the alleged crime.\n\n{5}     Two days later, J.Z. was arrested for absconding from juvenile probation. In jail, J.Z.\ntold a counselor that he had been sexually assaulted. J.Z. went through a sexual assault\n\n\n       1\n         Although some mention of the alleged victim’s name was inevitable at trial, we do\nnot refer to him by name here because “the constitution and laws of New Mexico require that\nwe respect ‘the victim’s dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process,’ ” State\nv. Allen, 2000-NMSC-002, ¶ 2 n.1, 128 N.M. 482, 994 P.2d 728 (quoting N.M. Const. art.\nII, § 24(A)(1)), and because the alleged victim was a child under NMSA 1978, Section 32A-\n1-4(B) (2005, amended 2016), since state law affords some degree of confidentiality in child\nabuse and neglect cases. See generally NMSA 1978, § 32A-4-33 (2005, amended 2016); see\nalso Allen, 2000-NMSC-002, ¶ 2 n.1.\n\n                                              2\n\fnurse examination (SANE exam) four days after the alleged attack. During the SANE exam,\na nurse took swabs from J.Z.’s anus, penis, and mouth. The nurse found no evidence of any\ninjuries on his body, and no DNA from Defendant was found on the swabs.\n\n{6}     After his release from custody about thirty days later, J.Z. told Jennifer Brown, his\nbig sister under the Big Brothers Big Sisters program, what had happened to him and\ndescribed his attacker, including the fact that the attacker wore a GPS monitor on his belt.\nMs. Brown located a photograph of Defendant and Defendant’s address on a website, and\nfrom that website photograph J.Z. recognized Defendant as his attacker. J.Z. drove to the\naddress listed on the website, and J.Z. identified Defendant’s truck as the truck in which he\nwas attacked. State employees later matched the locations and sequence of Defendant’s GPS\ncoordinates to those described in J.Z.’s story.\n\n{7}     Defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal sexual penetration in the second\ndegree “by the use of force or coercion on a child thirteen to eighteen years of age” (CSP-\nforce/coercion). Section 30-9-11(E)(1). Each count was alternatively charged as CSP-\nfelony. Section 30-9-11(E)(5). Defendant was also charged with criminal sexual contact\nof a minor in the fourth degree (CSC), contrary to NMSA 1978, Section 30-9-13(D)(1)\n(2003), and kidnapping, contrary to Section 30-4-1(A)(4). With respect to an allegation that\nDefendant forced J.Z. to engage in fellatio or touched J.Z.’s penis without his consent, the\njury unanimously found Defendant not guilty of CSP-felony or CSP-force/coercion and not\nguilty of the charge of CSC. The jury also unanimously found Defendant guilty of CSP-\nfelony with respect to the allegation of anal penetration and guilty of kidnapping. The jury\nhung on whether Defendant was guilty of CSP-force/coercion with respect to the allegation\nof anal penetration.\n\n{8}      At a separate sentencing proceeding, see NMSA 1978, § 31-18-26 (1996), the jury\nunanimously found by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant had been convicted\nof two violent sexual offenses pursuant to NMSA 1978, Section 31-18-25(F) (1997,\namended 2015), and was accordingly subject to a mandatory enhancement by a sentence of\nlife imprisonment. Defendant was sentenced to nine years imprisonment enhanced by a term\nof life imprisonment with the possibility of parole in thirty years for the second-degree CSP-\nfelony conviction and to eighteen years imprisonment for first-degree kidnapping, to be\nserved consecutively.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\nA.      Defendant’s Right to a Speedy Trial Was Not Violated\n\n{9}    The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that “[i]n all\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy . . . trial.” See also N.M.\nConst. art. II, § 14 (“[T]he accused shall have the right to . . . a speedy . . . trial.”).\nPreventing prejudice to the accused is at the heart of the speedy trial right, which also\nemanates from “the concomitant ‘societal interest in bringing an accused to trial.’ ” State\n\n                                               3\n\fv. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 4, 366 P.3d 1121 (quoting State v. Garza, 2009-NMSC-038,\n¶ 12, 146 N.M. 499, 212 P.3d 387). To determine whether the accused has been deprived\nof his speedy trial right, this Court follows the four-factor test established by the United\nStates Supreme Court in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), and considers “(1) the length\nof delay in bringing the case to trial, (2) the reasons for the delay, (3) the defendant’s\nassertion of the right to a speedy trial, and (4) the prejudice to the defendant caused by the\ndelay.” Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 5 (citing Barker, 407 U.S. at 530). The Court “weigh[s]\nthese factors according to the unique circumstances of each case in light of ‘the State and the\ndefendant’s conduct and the harm to the defendant from the delay.’ ” Id. ¶ 5 (quoting Garza,\n2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 13). “In reviewing a district court’s ruling on a speedy trial violation\nclaim, we defer to the court’s findings of fact, and we weigh and balance the Barker factors\nde novo.” Id. ¶ 20.\n\n1.      Length of the delay\n\n{10} The Court must first determine whether the length of the delay is presumptively\nprejudicial. “The first factor, the length of delay, has a dual function: it acts as a triggering\nmechanism for considering the four Barker factors if the delay crosses the threshold of being\npresumptively prejudicial, and it is an independent factor to consider in evaluating whether\na speedy trial violation has occurred.” Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 22 (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). Defendant was arrested and indicted on September 8, 2008, and\nhis trial began on November 12, 2013. The State therefore failed to bring the case to trial\nfor more than five years. This delay is presumptively prejudicial, regardless of the\ncomplexity of the case. See Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶¶ 21-23 (determining that a delay\nof more than four years was “presumptively prejudicial irrespective of the case’s\ncomplexity”). This sixty-two-month delay is extraordinary and weighs heavily against the\nState. Because the delay is presumptively prejudicial, we must consider the remaining\nBarker factors. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 22.\n\n2.      Reasons for the delay\n\n{11} The Court must evaluate “the reason the government assigns to justify the delay,”\nwhich “may either heighten or temper the prejudice to the defendant caused by the length\nof the delay.” Id. ¶ 29 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If the State\ndeliberately attempts to delay the trial to hamper the defense, the delay weighs heavily\nagainst the State. Id. Negligent or administrative delay must be considered because “the\nultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government,” although such\ndelay is not weighed as heavily against the State. Id. (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). However, “[a]s the length of delay increases, negligent or administrative delay\nweighs more heavily against the State.” Id. Finally, “ ‘appropriate delay,’ justified for ‘a\nvalid reason, such as a missing witness,’ is neutral and does not weigh against the State.”\nId. (quoting Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 27). Delay caused by a defendant weighs against\nthat defendant. See Vermont v. Brillon, 556 U.S. 81, 90, 94 (2009) (holding that the\ndefendant’s “deliberate attempt to disrupt proceedings” weighed heavily against the\n\n                                               4\n\fdefendant).\n\n{12} In this case, the pretrial delay can be grouped into three time periods: (1) from\nSeptember 8, 2008 until April 2010; (2) from April 2010 until September 2011; and (3) from\nSeptember 2011 until trial in November 2013.\n\n{13} During the first time period, the parties individually or jointly filed at least a dozen\nmotions for continuance stating a variety of reasons, including to negotiate a plea deal that\npotentially included other charges against Defendant, to prepare for trial, and to complete\ndiscovery. Defendant either stipulated to each of the State’s motions or did not oppose them.\nFor the first time on appeal, Defendant asserts that he stipulated to or jointly filed the\nnumerous motions for continuance which stated as grounds the need to continue plea\ndiscussions because of the apparent policy of the Second Judicial District Attorney’s Office\nthat only allowed plea negotiations prior to the victim being interviewed. This is the same\npolicy that we previously disfavored in Serros because “it is well settled that the possibility\nof a plea agreement does not relieve the State of its duty to pursue a timely disposition of the\ncase.” 2016-NMSC-008, ¶¶ 69, 71-72 (citing State v. Maddox, 2008-NMSC-062, ¶ 26, 145\nN.M. 242, 195 P.3d 1254 (“The State must affirmatively seek to move the case to trial, even\nwhile plea negotiations are pending.”)). Here, the plea negotiations were complicated and\ndelayed by Defendant’s admission to a parole violation on June 2, 2009, the filing of\nadditional criminal sexual penetration charges against Defendant in September 2009, and the\nparties’ effort to reach a plea deal with respect to all charges pending against Defendant and\nnot just the charges in this case. There is no evidence that the State deliberately delayed the\ncase during this time, and therefore these nineteen months from September 8, 2008 until\nApril 2010 weigh only slightly against the State.\n\n{14} During the second time period, Defendant concedes that he was responsible for\ndelaying the trial from April 2010 until February 2011. However, Defendant was also\nresponsible for the delay from March 2011 until April 2011 because his attorney missed a\nhearing and filed a motion for a continuance due to a scheduling conflict in another case.\nOn May 2, 2011, Defendant filed a request for judicial recusal. This motion was denied, and\nthe judge found that the motion was filed for the purpose of delaying the trial. On May 6,\n2011, Defendant petitioned this Court to issue an extraordinary writ reversing the district\njudge. We denied the writ on May 27, 2011. The time relating to Defendant’s petition for\nan extraordinary writ cannot be weighed against the State, and in any event, Defendant\naccepted responsibility for this delay. The district court set the trial for September 6, 2011;\ntherefore, we hold that Defendant is solely responsible for the seventeen-month delay from\nApril 2010 to September 2011.\n\n{15} The third time period, the twenty-six-month delay from September 2011 until\nNovember 2013, involved the district court’s consideration of numerous motions filed by\nboth parties and an appeal to this Court. The State appealed an order which excluded a\nstatement Defendant made to his counselor, Tewana Bell, which Bell later relayed to police\nofficers. In that statement, Defendant told Bell that he had sex with someone whose\n\n                                               5\n\fdescription was consistent with the physical characteristics of the alleged victim. The\ndistrict court entered its order on December 15, 2011 excluding Defendant’s statement\nbecause of the psychotherapist-patient privilege. See Rule 11-504 NMRA.\n\n{16} The State then filed a notice of appeal with the district court on December 16, 2011.\nThe State appealed to the Court of Appeals, which transferred the appeal to this Court\npursuant to State v. Smallwood, 2007-NMSC-005, ¶ 11, 141 N.M. 178, 152 P.3d 821,\nbecause Defendant, if found guilty, might be sentenced to life in prison. For speedy trial\npurposes in weighing the responsibility assigned to a party for delay caused by an\ninterlocutory appeal, courts may consider several factors, including “the strength of the\nGovernment’s position on the appealed issue, the importance of the issue in the posture of\nthe case, and—in some cases—the seriousness of the crime.” United States v. Loud Hawk,\n474 U.S. 302, 315 (1986). Applying the Loud Hawk analysis, we conclude that the delay\nfrom the filing of the appeal until our disposition should weigh neutrally because there were\nno unusual delays. First, the State certified that the appeal was not taken for the purpose of\ndelay and that the evidence would have been substantial proof of a material fact. Second,\nwe are persuaded that the evidence was important because, if admitted, it served as evidence\nthat Defendant admitted to having sex with someone who had the specific characteristics of\nthe alleged victim. Third, it illustrated the seriousness of a crime that Defendant could be\nsubjected to a sentence of life in prison if he were found guilty. Ultimately, this Court issued\na dispositional order affirming the district court. State v. Samora, No. 33,394, dispositional\norder of affirmance ¶ 13 (N.M. Sup. Ct. Aug. 29, 2013).\n\n{17} Further, the three and one-half months of motions from September 6, 2011 until\nDecember 16, 2011 and the two and one-half months between our dispositional order and\nthe actual trial on November 12, 2013 are administrative delays which weigh, if at all, only\nslightly against the State.\n\n{18} To summarize how we have weighed the reasons for the delay, twenty-five months\nweigh slightly against the State, seventeen months weigh against Defendant, and twenty\nmonths weigh neutrally. Considered together, the parties bear a similar responsibility for\nthe delays, and this factor weighs only slightly against the State.\n\nC.      Assertion of the right\n\n{19} Under this factor, “[w]e accord weight to the frequency and force of the defendant’s\nobjections to the delay and analyze the defendant’s actions with regard to the delay.” State\nv. Spearman, 2012-NMSC-023, ¶ 31, 283 P.3d 272 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). This inquiry is “closely related to the other Barker factors, because ‘[t]he strength\nof [the defendant’s] efforts will be affected by the length of the delay, to some extent by the\nreason for the delay, and most particularly by the personal prejudice, which is not always\nreadily identifiable, that [the defendant] experiences.’ ” Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 31\n(quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at 531) (alterations in original). Further, “[t]he timeliness and\nvigor with which the right is asserted may be considered as an indication of whether a\n\n                                               6\n\fdefendant was denied needed access to [a] speedy trial over his objection or whether the\nissue was raised on appeal as [an] afterthought.” Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 76 (second and\nthird alterations in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n{20} Defendant did not meaningfully assert his right, and therefore this factor does not\nsupport his speedy trial claim. Defendant made a pro forma assertion of his right on October\n30, 2008, when the Public Defender Department entered its appearance on his behalf. The\nonly other time he asserted the right was five years later in his October 25, 2013 motion to\ndismiss on speedy trial grounds. Considered alone, these two assertions would often be\nenough to weigh this factor slightly in favor of Defendant. See, e.g., Spearman, 2012-\nNMSC-023, ¶¶ 32-33 (holding that the defendant’s initial pro forma assertion along with a\nmotion to dismiss based on a speedy trial violation weighed against the State). However,\nDefendant’s assertions of the right were mitigated by his acquiescence to, and responsibility\nfor, numerous delays. See Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 34 (holding that the defendant’s\nassertion of the right at the outset of the case along with a motion to dismiss based on a\nspeedy trial violation weighed “slightly” in the defendant’s favor where the assertion was\nnot “mitigated . . . by any apparent acquiescence to the delay” by the defendant). In this\ncase, Defendant either stipulated to or did not oppose the State’s numerous motions for a\ncontinuance and was himself responsible for seventeen months of delay. Admittedly, it is\ndifficult to determine whether Defendant only stipulated to the continuances because of the\ndistrict attorney’s policy of not allowing plea deals after pretrial interviews with victims.\nIn the petition for continuance filed on December 4, 2009, the State noted that “Defendant\nhas chosen to forgo pretrial interviews of the victims until all written discovery is complete\nin both cases and to encourage a more favorable plea offer from the State.” This may\nsuggest that Defendant at least partially stipulated to the continuances because of the district\nattorney’s policy. Further, in the petition for continuance filed on March 3, 2010, the State\nsaid that “[t]he parties are in the process of setting up pretrial interviews and preparing for\ntrial in both cases should negotiations fall through . . . .” While this also may suggest that\nDefendant stipulated due to the policy, it is certainly not conclusive. If Defendant felt\ncompelled to concur in the State’s motions for a continuance because of the district\nattorney’s policy, he could have stated so in a pleading to the district court so that the court\ncould consider Defendant’s position in assessing whether to grant or deny the motion. We\nare left to speculate whether Defendant truly felt compelled to stipulate to the continuances\nor whether his counsel simply decided it was not urgent to conduct pre-trial interviews\nbecause Defendant had access to J.Z.’s safehouse interview and could prepare his case on\nthat basis. Defendant also demonstrated a lack of concern for his speedy trial right by\ndelaying his trial for seventeen months. Defendant’s assertion of his speedy trial right only\nat the very beginning and very end of the pretrial period, his continued stipulations to the\nState’s continuances, and his own significant contributions to the delay all show that his\nassertion of his speedy trial right was only an afterthought, and therefore this factor does not\nweigh in his favor.\n\nD.     Prejudice\n\n\n                                               7\n\f{21} This Court must analyze three separate interests to determine whether Defendant\nsuffered prejudice: “(i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety\nand concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be\nimpaired.” Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 35 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nDefendant must make a particularized showing of prejudice to demonstrate a violation of any\nof the three interests. Id. ¶¶ 35, 37. Because some oppression and anxiety are inevitably\nsuffered by every defendant awaiting trial, “we weigh this factor in the defendant’s favor\nonly where the pretrial incarceration or the anxiety suffered is undue.” Id. ¶ 35.\n\n{22} Here, Defendant has not asserted any particularized prejudice, such as identifying a\nwitness whose memory may have been impaired by the delay. See Serros, 2016-NMSC-008,\n¶ 92 (holding that the inability to interview the very young victim for four years prejudiced\nthe defendant’s ability to defend himself at trial). Nor has Defendant made a particularized\nshowing that he suffered undue anxiety or oppressive pretrial incarceration. Furthermore,\ndespite being incarcerated for more than five years while awaiting trial in this case,\nDefendant would have been incarcerated on the new CSP charge brought in September 2009,\nand other serious criminal charges were also brought against him a year into the pendency\nof this case. Cf. id. ¶¶ 88-91 (determining that the defendant being held in segregated\nprotective custody on a single charge for over four years was extremely prejudicial). We\nhold that Defendant did not articulate any particularized prejudice that he suffered as a result\nof the lengthy delay in this case.\n\n5.     Balancing the factors\n\n{23} To find a speedy trial violation without a showing of actual prejudice, the Court must\nfind that the three other Barker factors weigh heavily against the State. Garza, 2009-NMSC-\n038, ¶ 39. While the extraordinary length of the delay in this case weighs heavily against\nthe State, the reasons for the delay weigh only slightly against the State, and Defendant did\nnot meaningfully assert his speedy trial right. Therefore, we conclude that there was no\nspeedy trial violation. Accordingly, we must examine Defendant’s other claims.\n\nB.     The District Court Committed Fundamental Error by Failing to Instruct on the\n       Consent Element of CSP-Felony\n\n{24} The district court instructed the jury that to convict Defendant of CSP, CSC, or\nkidnapping, the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed an act that was\n“unlawful.” The jury instructions defined an unlawful act as follows: “For the act to have\nbeen unlawful it must have been done with the intent to arouse or gratify sexual desire or to\nintrude upon the bodily integrity or personal safety of [J.Z.].” This instruction reflected UJI\n14-132 NMRA, except that it failed to include the bracketed phrase “without consent,”\nwhich would have clarified that any sexual contact between J.Z. and Defendant had to be\nnon-consensual for the jury to determine that Defendant’s act was “unlawful.”\n\n{25}   If unlawfulness is at issue, then consent is an essential element of CSP-felony. CSP\n\n                                               8\n\fis defined, in relevant part, as “the unlawful and intentional causing of a person to engage\nin . . . anal intercourse . . . whether or not there is any emission.” Section 30-9-11(A). The\ncrime of CSP-felony requires that CSP be perpetrated “in the commission of any other\nfelony.” Section 30-9-11(E)(5). In State v. Stevens, we examined historical sources relevant\nto CSP-felony and determined that the Legislature “has never deviated from the common law\napproach of criminalizing only those sex acts that are perpetrated on persons without their\nconsent, either as a matter of fact or, in the case of children or other vulnerable victims, as\na matter of law.” 2014-NMSC-011, ¶ 27, 323 P.3d 901. Accordingly, we concluded that\nthe CSP-felony offense was intended to criminalize only “sexual acts perpetrated on persons\nwithout their consent . . . .” Id. ¶ 39 (emphasis added). Therefore, to convict under this\nprovision, the jury must determine that the underlying felony was “committed against the\nvictim of, and . . . assist[ed] in the accomplishment of, sexual penetration perpetrated by\nforce or coercion against a victim who, by age or other statutory factor,” did not or could not\ngive lawful consent. Id.\n\n{26} Here, the State provided the unlawfulness jury instruction to the district court and\nargued that “without consent” had been properly omitted because the issue of consent was\n“legally irrelevant” to the unlawfulness of CSP-felony in this case under State v. Moore,\n2011-NMCA-089, 150 N.M. 512, 263 P.3d 289. Yet, as the State acknowledges on appeal,\nMoore is inapplicable to this case. Moore held that “the consent of a statutorily defined\nchild is irrelevant to the unlawfulness element of CSP[-felony],” and it was therefore proper\nin Moore to omit the phrase “without consent” from the jury instructions when the alleged\nvictim was fourteen years old and the defendant was forty-six years old. Id. ¶¶ 13-16. As\nwe noted in Stevens, 2014-NMSC-011, ¶¶ 20, 40, Moore’s reference to a “ ‘statutorily\ndefined child’ ” meant a child “below the age of consent.” The age of consent, and whether\nthe lack of consent is an aspect of the unlawfulness element of CSP, varies statutorily\ndepending on the perpetrator’s age, the child’s age, and other factors as follows. Under\nSection 30-9-11(D), any sexual penetration of a child under thirteen years old is first-degree\nCSP because the child cannot legally consent to sex. Section 30-9-11(E)(1) punishes as\nsecond-degree CSP any sexual penetration of a child between the ages of thirteen and\neighteen years old by the use of force or coercion. Under that form of CSP, if the\nprosecution has proved that force or coercion was used by the perpetrator, it has also\nnecessarily proved that the act was non-consensual, and a separate finding of a lack of\nconsent is not required. See State v. Perea, 2008-NMCA-147, ¶ 9, 145 N.M. 123, 194 P.3d\n738 (“Consent of a child between the ages of thirteen and sixteen to engage in sexual\nintercourse is irrelevant where force or coercion is involved.”). Section 30-9-11(G)(1)\npunishes any sexual penetration, regardless of consent, where the child is between thirteen\nand sixteen years old and the perpetrator is at least eighteen years old, is at least four years\nolder than the child, and is not the child’s spouse. See Moore, 2011-NMCA-089, ¶ 11\n(concluding that “[a child’s] consent or lack thereof is legally irrelevant” under Section 30-9-\n11(6)(1)). Finally, under Section 30-9-11(G)(2), consent is irrelevant when the child is\nbetween the ages of thirteen and eighteen years old and the perpetrator is a school employee\nor volunteer, the perpetrator is at least eighteen years old, is at least four years older than the\nchild, and is not the child’s spouse, and the perpetrator learns while performing services for\n\n                                                9\n\fthe school that the child is a student at the school. Unlike in Moore, where the victim was\nfourteen years old, whether J.Z. consented to sex with Defendant was legally relevant to the\nCSP-felony charge because sixteen-year-old J.Z. could have legally consented to sex with\nDefendant. Therefore, the omission of “without consent” from the jury instructions was\nerroneous.\n\n{27} Because Defendant failed to object to the proffered jury instruction or otherwise\npreserve this issue at trial, we will only reverse if the omission of “without consent” was\nfundamental error. See Stevens, 2014-NMSC-011, ¶ 42. “Fundamental error only applies\nin exceptional circumstances when guilt is so doubtful that it would shock the judicial\nconscience to allow the conviction to stand.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). Under this standard, we must determine whether a reasonable juror would have\nbeen confused or misdirected “not only from instructions that are facially contradictory or\nambiguous, but from instructions which, through omission or misstatement, fail to provide\nthe juror with an accurate rendition of the relevant law.” State v. Benally, 2001-NMSC-033,\n¶ 12, 131 N.M. 258, 34 P.3d 1134. “In applying the fundamental error analysis to deficient\njury instructions, we are required to reverse when the misinstruction leaves us with ‘no way\nof knowing whether the conviction was or was not based on the lack of the essential\nelement.’ ” State v. Montoya, 2013-NMSC-020, ¶ 14, 306 P.3d 426 (quoting State v. Swick,\n2012-NMSC-018, ¶ 46, 279 P.3d 747).\n\n{28} “[I]f the instructions omitted an element which was at issue in the case, the error\ncould be fundamental.” State v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, ¶ 9, 113 N.M. 780, 833 P.2d\n1146. Accordingly, we initially examine whether J.Z.’s consent was at issue in this case to\ndetermine whether the omission of this element could be fundamental error. Cf. id. ¶¶ 9-20\n(concluding that it was not fundamental error to omit the unlawfulness element of criminal\nsexual contact of a minor under age thirteen where there was no evidence putting the\nlawfulness of the alleged acts “in issue,” and therefore “no rational jury could have\nconcluded that defendants had committed the acts without also determining that the acts\nwere performed in the manner proscribed by law”). There is some evidence in the record\nthat could have led the jury to infer that consent was at issue in this case. First, there was\nno evidence of physical injuries to corroborate J.Z.’s story that Defendant held him down\nand forced him to have sex. Second, during his interview with police Defendant did not deny\nhaving sex on May 25, 2008, so it would be possible to infer that he had consensual sex with\nJ.Z. on that date. Third, Defendant’s rigorous cross-examination of J.Z. focused on J.Z.’s\nchanging account of the alleged sexual assault and his alleged unreliability. If the jury\nbelieved that J.Z. was in some way unreliable or not telling the truth, the jurors could have\nreasonably concluded that Defendant and J.Z. went to a remote location and engaged in\nconsensual sex. Based on this testimony, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence\npresented to the jury to put consent at issue in this case, and we must therefore determine\nwhether the omission of this essential element was fundamental error.\n\n{29} Fundamental error occurs when jury instructions fail to inform the jurors that the\nState has the burden of proving an essential element of a crime and we are left with “no way\n\n                                             10\n\fof knowing” whether the jury found that element beyond a reasonable doubt. Swick,\n2012-NMSC-018, ¶ 46; see also Rule 5-608(A) NMRA (“The court must instruct the jury\nupon all questions of law essential for a conviction of any crime submitted to the jury.”).\nHowever, we need not conclude that there was fundamental error despite the court’s failure\nto instruct on an essential element where “the jury’s findings, in light of the undisputed\nevidence in the case, necessarily establish that the [omitted] element was met beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, ¶ 15. For instance, in Stevens we held that\nit was not fundamental error to omit the element of unlawfulness from a CSP-felony\ninstruction because the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged sexual act\noccurred between the thirteen-year-old victim and the defendant’s boyfriend, who was at\nleast ten years older than the victim, and that under those circumstances, the sexual act could\nnot be other than unlawful. 2014-NMSC-011, ¶¶ 43-46. In other words, the jury’s finding\nin Stevens that the sexual act occurred beyond a reasonable doubt was necessarily also a\nfinding that the act was unlawful beyond a reasonable doubt because the victim in that case\ncould not legally consent to sex with that defendant, and there was no other evidence\nsuggesting that the alleged sexual act could have been otherwise lawful, such as a touching\nfor purposes of reasonable medical treatment. See id. Further, in State v. Cunningham, the\nfailure to instruct on the essential element of unlawfulness or self-defense was not\nfundamental error because the jury received a separate self-defense instruction containing\nthe appropriate burden of proof and the jurors specifically found beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant did not act in self-defense, a finding which also satisfied the essential\nelement that was erroneously excluded. 2000-NMSC-009, ¶¶ 9, 20-22, 128 N.M. 711, 998\nP.2d 176.\n\n{30} Turning to this case, to ascertain whether fundamental error occurred, we must\n“review the entire record, placing the jury instructions in the context of the individual facts\nand circumstances of the case, to determine whether the Defendant’s conviction was the\nresult of a plain miscarriage of justice.” State v. Sutphin, 2007-NMSC-045, ¶ 19, 142 N.M.\n191, 164 P.3d 72 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The State argues that if\nthe omission of the entire “unlawful” element was not fundamental error in Stevens, then the\ndistrict court’s inclusion of that element and omission of only two words (“without consent”)\ncannot be fundamental error in this case. However, as we have previously discussed,\nunlawfulness is at issue in this case, where at age sixteen the alleged victim had passed the\nage of consent, unlike the thirteen-year-old victim in Stevens who legally could not consent\npursuant to Section 30-9-11(G)(1), and the conclusion that no fundamental error occurred\nin Stevens is therefore not dispositive here. The State further contends that the jury’s other\nfindings demonstrate that the jurors must have ultimately concluded that J.Z. did not consent\nto anal penetration by Defendant.\n\n{31} The jury convicted Defendant of kidnapping by finding beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat J.Z. was taken, restrained, confined, or transported by force, intimidation, or deception\nby Defendant. As part of the kidnapping conviction, the jury also found that Defendant\nintended to hold J.Z. against his will to inflict death, physical injury, or a sexual offense on\nhim. However, the jury’s conclusions regarding Defendant’s act of kidnapping do not\n\n                                              11\n\festablish beyond a reasonable doubt that it considered Defendant’s separate act of anally\npenetrating J.Z. to have been non-consensual beyond a reasonable doubt, despite the fact that\nit found the anal penetration in this case to have taken place during the commission of\nkidnapping. The jury further found that Defendant committed a “sexual offense” against J.Z.\nduring the kidnapping, despite the absence of a definition of “sexual offense” in the jury\ninstruction. Therefore, the jury also could have reached this finding without an\nunderstanding that in this case, it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the anal\npenetration was non-consensual for Defendant’s act to constitute a sexual offense. Finally,\nthe jury hung on an alternative CSP-force/coercion count with respect to Defendant’s anal\npenetration of J.Z. The only significant distinction between the jury instructions regarding\nCSP-force/coercion and those regarding CSP-felony was that the CSP-force/coercion\ninstruction required the jury to additionally conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that\nDefendant used physical force, physical violence, or threats of physical force or physical\nviolence against J.Z. While a finding that force or coercion was used during the sexual\npenetration is certainly not necessary to establish a lack of consent, if the jury had found this\nelement beyond a reasonable doubt under the alternative count, we would have no\nmisgivings in concluding that the jury also necessarily found beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe sexual penetration in this case was non-consensual. Yet the jury apparently hung on this\nvery element, and we therefore cannot draw any definitive conclusions regarding the jury’s\nunderstanding of the role of consent from their findings regarding the CSP-force/coercion\ncharge.\n\n{32} Moreover, we agree with Defendant that the juror questions submitted during trial\nhinted at juror confusion regarding the issue of consent. The record indicates that several\njuror questions were submitted to the district judge after the jurors were provided with the\ninstructions. In one of those questions, a juror asked “[h]ow old you have to be to have\nconsentual [sic] sex . . . ? We think [the SANE nurse] said the age was 13.” Indeed, the\nSANE nurse who examined J.Z. testified that the age of consent in New Mexico was\nthirteen. Another juror asked what it meant that Defendant’s act needed to be “unlawful,”\nand further stated that the term “seems conclus[ory] or unnecessary.” The district court\nresponded to these questions by instructing the jurors, “you are to decide this case based on\nthe testimony at trial and the jury instructions as a whole.” These questions indicate some\nlevel of confusion regarding the age of consent in New Mexico and the meaning of the\n“unlawful act” element of CSP-felony, and further support our conclusion that the jurors in\nthis case may have been confused or misdirected as to whether Defendant could have still\nacted unlawfully if J.Z. had consented to sex. See Benally, 2001-NMSC-033, ¶ 12 (“Under\n[fundamental error review,] we seek to determine whether a reasonable juror would have\nbeen confused or misdirected by the jury instruction.” (emphasis added) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted)). Accordingly, we hold that in the circumstances of this case,\nit was fundamental error to omit the element of consent from the jury instructions that were\nrelevant to CSP-felony.\n\n{33} Defendant only requests that his CSP-felony conviction be reversed as a result of this\nerror. However, we are responsible for determining whether this fundamental error also\n\n                                               12\n\finfected his conviction for kidnapping. See State v. Arrendondo, 2012-NMSC-013, ¶ 20,\n278 P.3d 517 (concluding that appellate courts have a responsibility to raise issues sua\nsponte when it is necessary to protect a party’s fundamental rights); see also State v.\nCabezuela, 2011-NMSC-041, ¶ 39, 150 N.M. 654, 265 P.3d 705 (“It is the fundamental right\nof a criminal defendant to have the jury determine whether each element of the charged\noffense has been proved by the state beyond a reasonable doubt.” (internal quotation marks\nand citations omitted)). We conclude that the error of omitting the element of consent from\nthe jury instruction affected the kidnapping conviction. The jury instructions did not define\nthe term “sexual offense” beyond providing the elements of CSP and CSC through other\ninstructions. Because the jury may have been confused or misdirected as to whether\nconsensual sex between J.Z. and Defendant could still be a sexual offense, then the jury’s\nfinding under the kidnapping charge that Defendant intended to inflict death, physical injury,\nor a sexual offense on J.Z. was necessarily infected by the same potential confusion,\naffecting the verdict on the kidnapping charge in this case where there was not sufficient\nevidence to support the inference that Defendant intended to inflict death or a physical injury\non J.Z. Therefore, because we cannot determine whether the jury found that the sexual act\nwas non-consensual beyond a reasonable doubt, we must also reverse Defendant’s\nkidnapping conviction for fundamental error.\n\n{34} Because we have determined that we must reverse Defendant’s convictions for CSP-\nfelony and kidnapping, we are required to determine whether sufficient evidence was\npresented to support these convictions to avoid double jeopardy concerns should the State\nseek to retry Defendant. State v. Dowling, 2011-NMSC-016, ¶ 18, 150 N.M. 110, 257 P.3d\n930; Cabezuela, 2011-NMSC-041, ¶ 40. “The test for sufficiency of the evidence is whether\nsubstantial evidence of either a direct or circumstantial nature exists to support a verdict of\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to every element essential to a conviction.”\nId. ¶ 42 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In doing so, we view “the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the guilty verdict, indulging all reasonable inferences and\nresolving all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the verdict.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n\n{35} There was sufficient evidence to support Defendant’s kidnapping and CSP-felony\nconvictions. In this case, the alleged victim’s testimony was by itself enough to establish\nevery element of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt under a sufficiency of the evidence\nreview. The jury could have reasonably inferred that Defendant took or transported J.Z. by\ndeception based on J.Z.’s testimony that he got into Defendant’s truck because Defendant\nsaid that he would take J.Z. home. Alternatively, J.Z. also testified that when he tried to\nescape from Defendant’s truck, the door was locked—testimony from which the jurors could\nhave reasonably concluded that Defendant confined J.Z. by force. Further, the jurors could\nhave reasonably inferred that Defendant intended to hold J.Z. against J.Z.’s will to inflict a\nsexual offense against him based on J.Z.’s testimony that Defendant took him to a remote\nlocation, pulled down J.Z.’s pants, and then penetrated his anus. This evidence also supports\na reasonable inference that Defendant caused J.Z. to engage in anal intercourse.\nAdditionally, the jury also could have reasonably concluded that Defendant’s statement to\n\n                                              13\n\fJ.Z. after ejaculating—“Now I can take you home”—indicated that Defendant transported\nJ.Z. to a remote location and confined him there for the purpose of inflicting a sexual offense\non him. J.Z.’s testimony regarding the sexual act in this case also supported a reasonable\ninference that Defendant’s act against J.Z. was unlawful because the jury could have inferred\nthat it was done without J.Z.’s consent and for the purpose of gratifying Defendant’s sexual\ndesire or to intrude upon J.Z.’s bodily safety or integrity. Further, because J.Z.’s account\nsupported a conviction for kidnapping, the jury could have reasonably determined that the\nCSP in this case was committed during the course of the kidnapping since the sexual\npenetration occurred while J.Z. was either being transported by deception or confined by\nforce. Ultimately, if the jury believed J.Z.’s story regarding his encounter with Defendant,\nit could have reasonably found that every element of both crimes was met beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Therefore, Defendant may be retried on both charges.\n\n{36} Because we have determined that the omission of consent from the jury instructions\nrose to the level of fundamental error and requires reversal of both convictions, we need not\nreach the other issues raised by Defendant. However, to provide guidance on remand, we\naddress (1) the admission of GPS evidence and online identification evidence, and (2) the\nscope of Defendant’s cross-examination of J.Z., but not any of the other arguments raised\nby Defendant. See State v. Allison, 2000-NMSC-027, ¶ 1, 129 N.M. 566, 11 P.3d 141\n(stating that the Court may address additional issues “[f]or guidance upon remand”); State\nv. Torres, 1999-NMSC-010, ¶ 8, 127 N.M. 20, 976 P.2d 20 (same).\n\nIII.   The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Admitting Evidence\n       Regarding J.Z.’s Identification of Defendant via the Internet or by Allowing\n       Testimony Regarding the Fact that Defendant Was Subject to GPS Monitoring\n\n{37} Defendant claims that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence\nthat he wore a GPS monitoring device and that J.Z. found Defendant’s picture, name, and\naddress on an Internet website. Absent a clear abuse of discretion, we will not reverse a trial\njudge’s decision to admit evidence. State v. Apodaca, 1994-NMSC-121, ¶ 23, 118 N.M.\n762, 887 P.2d 756. “An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is clearly against the\nlogic and effect of the facts and circumstances of the case. We cannot say the trial court\nabused its discretion by its ruling unless we can characterize it as clearly untenable or not\njustified by reason.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n{38} Prior to trial, Defendant filed a motion to exclude any evidence that he wore a GPS\ntracker and was subject to GPS monitoring by the State, and any evidence that J.Z. identified\nDefendant while viewing New Mexico’s online sex offender registry. The district court ruled\nthat the State could elicit the fact that Defendant was wearing a GPS device, but that it could\nnot describe the nature of Defendant’s underlying conviction. The district court later\nspecified that if the GPS monitoring information was elicited through the testimony of parole\nauthorities, they should simply be introduced as employees of the State of New Mexico\nwithout any further detail. The district court further held that the State could introduce\nevidence that J.Z. found Defendant’s picture and other identifying information “on the\n\n                                              14\n\fInternet,” but could not be more specific about the nature of the website.\n\n{39} As an initial matter, we reject Defendant’s argument that we should consider his offer\nto stipulate to being with J.Z. at the time and place of the alleged sexual assault as precluding\nthe State’s need for the online identification and GPS evidence admitted by the district court.\nThe State is “not bound to present its case to the jury through abstract stipulations,” despite\na defendant’s offer to stipulate to certain facts. State v. Martinez, 1999-NMSC-018, ¶ 34,\n127 N.M. 207, 979 P.2d 718. For example, in State v. Sarracino, this Court held that it was\nnot an abuse of discretion to allow the State to elicit testimony regarding statements made\nby the defendant while threatening a couple with a gun when the defendant had offered to\nstipulate to making the statements and had claimed that the circumstances surrounding their\nadmission would be impermissible evidence of prior bad acts. 1998-NMSC-022, ¶¶ 5, 21-\n22, 125 N.M. 511, 964 P.2d 72. In that case, we looked only to whether the evidence of this\nuncharged prior bad act fit within an exception to Rule 11-404(B) NMRA, and did not\nconsider the defendant’s stipulation offer in our analysis. See Sarracino, 1998-NMSC-022,\n¶ 22. Similarly, in this case we need not consider Defendant’s offer to stipulate that he was\nwith J.Z. at the times and places alleged to determine whether the GPS and online\nidentification evidence was admissible under either Rule 11-404(B) or Rule 11-403 NMRA,\nor whether it improperly bolstered J.Z.’s testimony.\n\n{40} We also disagree with Defendant’s contention that admission of “[t]he fact that\n[Defendant] was on GPS monitoring and that his name and address were listed on a website\ninexorably leads to one conclusion: he was a convicted sex offender” and that this evidence\nwas therefore improper evidence of prior bad acts under Rule 11-404(B). Rule 11-404(B)(1)\nexcludes “[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act . . . to prove a person’s character in\norder to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with [that]\ncharacter.” This rule only “prohibits the use of otherwise relevant evidence when its sole\npurpose or effect is to prove criminal propensity.” State v. Gallegos, 2007-NMSC-007, ¶\n22, 141 N.M. 185, 152 P.3d 828 (emphasis added). However, such “evidence may be\nadmissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\nplan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.” Rule 11-404(B)(2). In\nconsidering the online identification evidence in this case, the district court opined that\n“nowadays computer access and computer use is very common . . . . I’ve thought about the\nwhole issue of computer access and computer use, and we’re in a new age, and it’s the 21st\ncentury, and it’s just a fact of life.” We hold that it was not an abuse of discretion for the\ndistrict court to conclude that the limited information admitted regarding J.Z.’s identification\nof Defendant through online information did not constitute evidence of a crime, a wrong, or\nanother act under Rule 11-404(B). The district court also determined that evidence of\nDefendant’s GPS coordinates on the date of the alleged crime and the fact that he was\nwearing a GPS tracking device were admissible because they showed “identity, opportunity\nand lack of mistake.” We again conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion in this case\nto admit limited evidence that Defendant was on GPS monitoring. The evidence did not\nhave the sole purpose or effect of proving criminal propensity, but was instead probative to\nmaterial facts in the case because (1) J.Z. testified that the person who assaulted him was\n\n                                               15\n\fwearing a GPS monitor on his belt, which Defendant was required to wear; and (2)\nDefendant’s GPS coordinates placed him in the same locations where J.Z. claimed to have\nbeen assaulted.\n\n{41} We reject Defendant’s additional contention that the probative value of the online\nidentification and GPS evidence was substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair\nprejudice from its admission under Rule 11-403. As we have previously discussed, the\ndistrict court limited the online identification evidence presented at trial to completely\nexclude the fact that J.Z. found Defendant’s picture at an online sex offender registry. The\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this limited version of J.Z.’s\nidentification of Defendant because it was reasonable to conclude that the mere fact that J.Z.\nfound Defendant’s picture, name, and address online, without any additional information,\nwas completely unremarkable and neither reflected negatively on Defendant nor created a\ndanger of unfair prejudice. Similarly, the GPS evidence was limited to prevent any mention\nof why Defendant was being monitored. Under the circumstances of this case, the generic\ninformation that Defendant was subject to GPS monitoring was not overly prejudicial, and\ncontrary to Defendant’s suggestion, did not strongly imply that Defendant was a sex\noffender. During the hearing on Defendant’s motion to exclude, the district court concluded\nthat individuals may wear a GPS device and be monitored by state employees for a variety\nof reasons, including pretrial monitoring programs and probation in cases not involving sex\noffenses. Indeed, during voir dire, two prospective jurors mentioned that they associated\nGPS monitoring with a DWI or other alcohol-related offense, but none of the prospective\njurors mentioned any specific association with sex offenses. Thus, we do not conclude that\nthere was an abuse of discretion in the district court’s admission of the information that\nDefendant was subject to GPS monitoring by the State, without anything more, because any\nprejudice to Defendant did not substantially outweigh the probative value of this evidence\nin identifying Defendant as J.Z.’s alleged attacker.\n\n{42} Finally, we reject Defendant’s contention that presenting the online identification and\nGPS evidence improperly bolstered J.Z.’s credibility. Evidence will be excluded as\nimproper bolstering when it directly comments on a witness’s credibility, but not when it\nprovides “[i]ncidental verification” of a witness’s story or only indirectly bolsters that\nwitness’s credibility. State v. Alberico, 1993-NMSC-047, ¶ 89, 116 N.M. 156, 861 P.2d\n192. For example, in State v. Lucero, a psychiatrist’s testimony was improper bolstering\nwhen she commented directly on the victim’s credibility, repeatedly mentioned that the\nvictim claimed to have been assaulted by the defendant, and opined that the victim’s post-\ntraumatic stress disorder was caused by sexual molestation. 1993-NMSC-064, ¶¶ 5-6, 15-17,\n116 N.M. 450, 863 P.2d 1071. However, in this case the GPS evidence and online\nidentification evidence only corroborated J.Z.’s testimony; it did not comment directly on\nhis credibility or impinge in any way on the jury’s role of assessing J.Z.’s story and\ndetermining whether he was telling the truth. Therefore, the admission of this evidence was\nnot an abuse of the district court’s discretion.\n\nIV.    The District Court’s Limitation of Defendant’s Cross-Examination of J.Z. Was\n\n                                             16\n\f       Not an Abuse of Discretion and Did Not Violate Defendant’s Rights under the\n       Confrontation Clause\n\n{43} Defendant argues that the district court erred by limiting his cross-examination of\nJ.Z. Generally, “[t]he district court has broad discretion to control the scope of\ncross-examination, including the discretion to control cross-examination to ensure a fair and\nefficient trial.” State v. Bent, 2013-NMCA-108, ¶ 10, 328 P.3d 677 (citation omitted). Prior\nto trial, the State filed a motion seeking to exclude Defendant from using any of J.Z.’s\njuvenile adjudications for impeachment purposes, to limit Defendant to only inquiring about\nthe number of J.Z.’s felony convictions, and to exclude Defendant from using the names of\nany of those felonies with the exception of J.Z.’s conviction for commercial burglary. The\nrecord indicates that Defendant did not file a written response. The district court held a\nhearing on this motion and ruled that (a) the names of J.Z.’s juvenile adjudications were not\nto be presented to the jury; (b) Defendant could mention J.Z.’s violations of his juvenile\nprobation right after the alleged incident with Defendant because that was “a matter of\nmotive”; (c) Defendant could not cross-examine J.Z. regarding J.Z.’s convictions for\npossession of a firearm by a felon and contributing to the delinquency of a minor as a result\nof a DWI because “it confuses the jury, it gets [them] into a mini trial,” while J.Z.’s other\nfelony convictions went to credibility and were fair game; (d) however, Defendant could\nrefer to the existence of these other felony convictions without naming them; and (e)\nDefendant could ask about charges pending against J.Z., but could not detail those charges\nand could not bring in extrinsic evidence to prove them.\n\n{44} First, Defendant contends that it was improper to limit cross-examination regarding\nJ.Z.’s prior convictions and his experience with the criminal justice system as an adult and\nas a juvenile. Under Rule 11-609(D) NMRA, prior juvenile adjudications are admissible for\nimpeachment of a witness only when they are offered in a criminal case, the witness is not\nthe defendant, an adult’s conviction for that offense would normally be admissible to attack\ncredibility, and admitting the evidence is necessary to fairly determine guilt or innocence.\nAt the hearing on the State’s motion, the district court indicated that Defendant could use\nJ.Z.’s juvenile criminal history to show that J.Z. was in juvenile detention when he first\naccused Defendant and that his detention may have given him a motive to lie. At the\nhearing, Defendant agreed that he did not need to name J.Z.’s prior juvenile convictions, and\nthe district court acknowledged that concession on the record. Therefore, Defendant did not\nproperly preserve for appeal any objection with respect to the scope of permissible cross-\nexamination regarding J.Z.’s juvenile convictions. See State v. Varela, 1999-NMSC-045,\n¶ 25, 128 N.M. 454, 993 P.2d 1280 (“In order to preserve an error for appeal, it is essential\nthat the ground or grounds of the objection or motion be made with sufficient specificity to\nalert the mind of the trial court to the claimed error or errors, and that a ruling thereon then\nbe invoked.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n{45} As to J.Z.’s adult convictions, under Rule 11-609(A) the district court must admit\nprior adult convictions for impeachment purposes if (1) the conviction is for any crime that\nis punishable by imprisonment for more than a year, subject to the balancing test of Rule 11-\n\n                                              17\n\f403, or (2) the conviction is for any crime involving a dishonest act or false statement. The\ndistrict court permitted Defendant to refer by name to J.Z.’s felony convictions for\ncommercial burglary, conspiracy to tamper with evidence, and a probation violation on the\ncharge of receiving or transferring a stolen vehicle. The district court also exercised its\ndiscretion under Rule 11-609(A)(1) by preventing Defendant from mentioning by name\nJ.Z.’s prior convictions for possession of a firearm by a felon and contributing to the\ndelinquency of a minor under Rule 11-403. However, Defendant would still be allowed to\nrefer to the existence of these other felony convictions without naming those offenses. On\nappeal, Defendant does not state which specific convictions he should have been allowed to\nname, but instead merely makes a general reference to the jury’s potential “misunderstanding\nof [J.Z.’s] possible motives and the extent to which he was familiar with the horse-trading\naspect of the criminal justice system.” We hold that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in limiting how Defendant could refer to two of J.Z.’s prior adult felony\nconvictions. Contrary to Defendant’s arguments, the district court’s ruling still allowed\nDefendant to elicit that J.Z. had frequent encounters with the criminal justice system and to\nargue that J.Z. was exaggerating his story to get a deal on some of his other charges.\n\n{46} Second, Defendant asserts that it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to\nlimit his cross-examination of J.Z. regarding how J.Z. made his living on the streets,\nincluding the fact that J.Z. “used and/or sold drugs.” The record reflects that Defendant\nelicited testimony from J.Z. that J.Z. was hustling, panhandling, and selling drugs to survive\non the streets. The district court then cut off any additional questions from Defendant\nregarding how J.Z. made his living on the streets because the court reasoned that selling\ndrugs and being homeless was impermissible character evidence that was not relevant to any\nissues either in the case or to J.Z.’s credibility. However, the district court later allowed\nDefendant to elicit testimony from J.Z. that he had a bad memory from using drugs,\npresumably because that testimony was relevant to the jury’s assessment of J.Z.’s reliability\nas a witness. Under these circumstances, we conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion\nfor the district court to limit Defendant’s cross-examination regarding J.Z.’s homelessness\nor drug use since the specific issue of how J.Z. made his living on the streets was of minimal\nrelevance to any issues either in the case or to J.Z.’s credibility.\n\n{47} Third, Defendant claims that it was an improper abuse of discretion for the district\ncourt to prevent Defendant from providing J.Z. with transcripts of his safehouse interview\nwhile J.Z. was on the stand to refresh J.Z.’s recollection and then impeach him with prior\ninconsistent statements. “The admission or exclusion of [an] inconsistent statement rests\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial court under the particular facts in this case and will\nnot be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.” State v. Davis, 1981-NMSC-131, ¶ 20,\n97 N.M. 130, 637 P.2d 561. During cross-examination, Defendant asked J.Z. whether J.Z.\nhad stated during his safehouse interview that Defendant punched him. J.Z. responded, “I\nbelieve so.” Defense counsel asked J.Z. to show him where in the transcript he had made this\nstatement. The State objected that showing J.Z. the transcript would be improper\nrefreshment and improper impeachment. The district court sustained this objection and did\nnot agree to Defendant’s proposal of letting J.Z. review the entire transcript because it would\n\n                                              18\n\fhave taken a significant amount of time and the issue was de minimus. Defendant was then\nallowed to resume his cross-examination of J.Z. regarding J.Z.’s safehouse statement, during\nwhich J.Z. stated that he was not sure what he said, that he may not have said it, and that he\ndid not know if he said it. J.Z. finally agreed that he did not say that Defendant had punched\nhim in the head during the interview. We conclude that the district court acted within its\ndiscretion to control cross-examination to ensure an efficient trial by denying Defendant’s\nrequest to have J.Z. review the entire transcript of the safehouse interview to confirm that\nhe never said he was hit in the head, and instead requiring Defendant to continue to cross-\nexamine J.Z. to elicit this statement through testimony. See Bent, 2013-NMCA-108, ¶ 10.\n\n{48} Fourth and finally, Defendant argues that these limitations on his cross-examination\nof J.Z. collectively violated Defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause. The\nConfrontation Clause “guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be\nconfronted with the witnesses against him.” Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 315 (1974)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). However, “the trial court retains wide\nlatitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on . . .\ncross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice,\nconfusion of the issues, the witness’[s] safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only\nmarginally relevant.” State v. Smith, 2001-NMSC-004, ¶ 19, 130 N.M. 117, 19 P.3d 254\n(omission in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although the extent\nof cross-examination is within the sound discretion of the district court, we still review de\nnovo whether limits on cross-examination have violated the Confrontation Clause. Id.\n\n{49} We disagree with Defendant’s argument that the limitations on cross-examination\nin this case were analogous to those limitations held to be violations of the Confrontation\nClause by the United States Supreme Court in Davis. In Davis, the defendant, who was\naccused of stealing a safe, was prohibited from cross-examining a witness against him\nregarding the fact that the witness was on probation for burglary. 415 U.S. at 311-12. Davis\nheld that the district court’s limitations on cross-examination of the witness violated the\ndefendant’s confrontation rights because he was not permitted to produce evidence to create\nany record of the reason that the witness might potentially be biased or motivated to lie, such\nas the witness’s fear that the police might otherwise suspect the witness of committing the\ncrime, based on his prior criminal history. See id. at 317-18. Instead, “defense counsel\nshould have been permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole\ntriers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability\nof the witness.” Id. By contrast, here the district court’s limitations on cross-examination\ndid not prevent Defendant from creating a record regarding potential credibility problems\nwith J.Z.’s testimony. Indeed, the district court specifically did not limit Defendant’s cross-\nexamination regarding J.Z.’s prior convictions for crimes of dishonesty, and permitted\nDefendant to elicit general information illustrating that J.Z. had significant experience with\nthe criminal justice system and made his living by hustling on the streets, both of which also\nprovided fodder for Defendant’s argument that J.Z. had motivations to fabricate his story.\nTherefore, we conclude that the district court’s exercise of discretion to limit the extent of\nDefendant’s cross-examination of J.Z. was proper and did not violate Defendant’s rights\n\n                                              19\n\funder the Confrontation Clause.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n{50} We reverse Defendant’s convictions for CSP-felony and kidnapping and remand to\nthe district court, where Defendant may be retried on those charges.\n\n{51}   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                         ____________________________________\n                                         EDWARD L.

Sanchez, District Judge\n\nBennett J. Baur, Chief Public Defender\nJ.K. Theodosia Johnson, Assistant Appellate Defender\nSanta Fe, NM\n\nfor Appellant\n\nHector H. Balderas, Attorney General\nSteven H. Johnston, Assistant Attorney General\nSanta Fe, NM\n\nfor Appellee\n\n                                       OPINION\n\nCHÁVEZ, Justice.\n\n{1}      Defendant Anthony Samora was accused of luring a sixteen-year-old male into his\ntruck by deception, driving him to a secluded location in Albuquerque, and then forcibly\npenetrating him in the anus. A jury convicted Defendant of second-degree criminal sexual\npenetration in the commission of a felony (CSP-felony), contrary to NMSA 1978, Section\n30-9-11(E)(5) (2007, amended 2009), and first-degree kidnapping, contrary to NMSA 1978,\nSection 30-4-1(A)(4) (2003). Due to sentencing enhancements, Defendant was sentenced\nto life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after thirty years for his CSP-felony\n\n                                           1\n\fconviction plus a consecutive eighteen-year sentence for his kidnapping conviction. In this\ndirect appeal, Defendant brings a variety of challenges to both convictions, including a\nchallenge to the district court for omitting that the sexual act must have been non-consensual\nwhen instructing the jury on CSP-felony.\n\n{2}     Because we conclude that it was fundamental error to omit the phrase “without\nconsent” from the jury instructions relevant to CSP-felony, we must reverse Defendant’s\nCSP conviction. The same fundamental error also infected the jury’s findings with respect\nto Defendant’s intent to inflict a sexual offense against the alleged victim, and we must\ntherefore also reverse Defendant’s kidnapping conviction. Accordingly, we remand this case\nto the district court, where Defendant may be retried on both charges.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n{3}     J.Z.1 was at a bus stop in downtown Albuquerque “bugging people for money” so\nthat he could catch a bus home. Defendant approached him, stated that he knew J.Z.’s\nfamily, and offered to give J.Z. a ride home. J.Z. got into Defendant’s pickup truck, and\nDefendant started driving.\n\n{4}      J.Z. testified that he soon noticed that Defendant was not driving J.Z. toward his\nhouse. J.Z. told Defendant he was driving the wrong way, and Defendant did not respond.\nDefendant eventually stopped the truck in a remote location under a highway underpass.\nDefendant then punched J.Z. in the head, and J.Z. became “dizzy.” Defendant pulled down\nJ.Z.’s pants, maneuvered him into a receptive position, got on top of J.Z., and penetrated\nJ.Z.’s anus with his penis. J.Z. further testified that he tried to escape by opening the\npassenger-side door of Defendant’s truck, but the door would not open. After a few minutes\nDefendant ejaculated and said, “Now I can take you home.” Defendant dropped off J.Z. on\nthe west side of Albuquerque at a gas station near a Walmart. J.Z. testified that he was afraid\nto call the police because he did not want to be arrested for a probation violation. He also\ntestified that he fought back throughout the encounter but that Defendant threw him around\nand overpowered him. J.Z. was sixteen years old at the time of the alleged crime.\n\n{5}     Two days later, J.Z. was arrested for absconding from juvenile probation. In jail, J.Z.\ntold a counselor that he had been sexually assaulted. J.Z. went through a sexual assault\n\n\n       1\n         Although some mention of the alleged victim’s name was inevitable at trial, we do\nnot refer to him by name here because “the constitution and laws of New Mexico require that\nwe respect ‘the victim’s dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process,’ ” State\nv.

Const. art.\nII, § 24(A)(1)), and because the alleged victim was a child under NMSA 1978, Section 32A-\n1-4(B) (2005, amended 2016), since state law affords some degree of confidentiality in child\nabuse and neglect cases. See generally NMSA 1978, § 32A-4-33 (2005, amended 2016); see\nalso Allen, 2000-NMSC-002, ¶ 2 n.1.\n\n                                              2\n\fnurse examination (SANE exam) four days after the alleged attack. During the SANE exam,\na nurse took swabs from J.Z.’s anus, penis, and mouth. The nurse found no evidence of any\ninjuries on his body, and no DNA from Defendant was found on the swabs.\n\n{6}     After his release from custody about thirty days later, J.Z. told Jennifer Brown, his\nbig sister under the Big Brothers Big Sisters program, what had happened to him and\ndescribed his attacker, including the fact that the attacker wore a GPS monitor on his belt.\nMs. Brown located a photograph of Defendant and Defendant’s address on a website, and\nfrom that website photograph J.Z. recognized Defendant as his attacker. J.Z. drove to the\naddress listed on the website, and J.Z. identified Defendant’s truck as the truck in which he\nwas attacked. State employees later matched the locations and sequence of Defendant’s GPS\ncoordinates to those described in J.Z.’s story.\n\n{7}     Defendant was indicted on two counts of criminal sexual penetration in the second\ndegree “by the use of force or coercion on a child thirteen to eighteen years of age” (CSP-\nforce/coercion). Section 30-9-11(E)(1). Each count was alternatively charged as CSP-\nfelony. Section 30-9-11(E)(5). Defendant was also charged with criminal sexual contact\nof a minor in the fourth degree (CSC), contrary to NMSA 1978, Section 30-9-13(D)(1)\n(2003), and kidnapping, contrary to Section 30-4-1(A)(4). With respect to an allegation that\nDefendant forced J.Z. to engage in fellatio or touched J.Z.’s penis without his consent, the\njury unanimously found Defendant not guilty of CSP-felony or CSP-force/coercion and not\nguilty of the charge of CSC. The jury also unanimously found Defendant guilty of CSP-\nfelony with respect to the allegation of anal penetration and guilty of kidnapping. The jury\nhung on whether Defendant was guilty of CSP-force/coercion with respect to the allegation\nof anal penetration.\n\n{8}      At a separate sentencing proceeding, see NMSA 1978, § 31-18-26 (1996), the jury\nunanimously found by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant had been convicted\nof two violent sexual offenses pursuant to NMSA 1978, Section 31-18-25(F) (1997,\namended 2015), and was accordingly subject to a mandatory enhancement by a sentence of\nlife imprisonment. Defendant was sentenced to nine years imprisonment enhanced by a term\nof life imprisonment with the possibility of parole in thirty years for the second-degree CSP-\nfelony conviction and to eighteen years imprisonment for first-degree kidnapping, to be\nserved consecutively.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\nA.      Defendant’s Right to a Speedy Trial Was Not Violated\n\n{9}    The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that “[i]n all\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy . . . trial.” See also N.M.\nConst. art. II, § 14 (“[T]he accused shall have the right to . . . a speedy . . . trial.”).\nPreventing prejudice to the accused is at the heart of the speedy trial right, which also\nemanates from “the concomitant ‘societal interest in bringing an accused to trial.’ ” State\n\n                                               3\n\fv. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 4, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (quoting State v. Garza, 2009-NMSC-038,\n¶ 12, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"891580\"><a href=\"/opinion/891580/state-v-garza/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">). To determine whether the accused has been deprived\nof his speedy trial right, this Court follows the four-factor test established by the United\nStates Supreme Court in Barker v. Wingo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108590\"><a href=\"/opinion/108590/barker-v-wingo/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972), and considers “(1) the length\nof delay in bringing the case to trial, (2) the reasons for the delay, (3) the defendant’s\nassertion of the right to a speedy trial, and (4) the prejudice to the defendant caused by the\ndelay.” Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 5 (citing Barker, 407 U.S. at 530). The Court “weigh[s]\nthese factors according to the unique circumstances of each case in light of ‘the State and the\ndefendant’s conduct and the harm to the defendant from the delay.’ ” Id. ¶ 5 (quoting Garza,\n2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 13). “In reviewing a district court’s ruling on a speedy trial violation\nclaim, we defer to the court’s findings of fact, and we weigh and balance the Barker factors\nde novo.” Id. ¶ 20.\n\n1.      Length of the delay\n\n{10} The Court must first determine whether the length of the delay is presumptively\nprejudicial. “The first factor, the length of delay, has a dual function: it acts as a triggering\nmechanism for considering the four Barker factors if the delay crosses the threshold of being\npresumptively prejudicial, and it is an independent factor to consider in evaluating whether\na speedy trial violation has occurred.” Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 22 (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). Defendant was arrested and indicted on September 8, 2008, and\nhis trial began on November 12, 2013. The State therefore failed to bring the case to trial\nfor more than five years. This delay is presumptively prejudicial, regardless of the\ncomplexity of the case. See Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶¶ 21-23 (determining that a delay\nof more than four years was “presumptively prejudicial irrespective of the case’s\ncomplexity”). This sixty-two-month delay is extraordinary and weighs heavily against the\nState. Because the delay is presumptively prejudicial, we must consider the remaining\nBarker factors. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 22.\n\n2.      Reasons for the delay\n\n{11} The Court must evaluate “the reason the government assigns to justify the delay,”\nwhich “may either heighten or temper the prejudice to the defendant caused by the length\nof the delay.” Id. ¶ 29 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If the State\ndeliberately attempts to delay the trial to hamper the defense, the delay weighs heavily\nagainst the State. Id. Negligent or administrative delay must be considered because “the\nultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government,” although such\ndelay is not weighed as heavily against the State. Id. (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). However, “[a]s the length of delay increases, negligent or administrative delay\nweighs more heavily against the State.” Id. Finally, “ ‘appropriate delay,’ justified for ‘a\nvalid reason, such as a missing witness,’ is neutral and does not weigh against the State.”\nId. (quoting Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 27). Delay caused by a defendant weighs against\nthat defendant. See Vermont v. Brillon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145899\"><a href=\"/opinion/145899/vermont-v-brillon/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90, 94 (2009) (holding that the\ndefendant’s “deliberate attempt to disrupt proceedings” weighed heavily against the\n\n                                               4\n\fdefendant).\n\n{12} In this case, the pretrial delay can be grouped into three time periods: (1) from\nSeptember 8, 2008 until April 2010; (2) from April 2010 until September 2011; and (3) from\nSeptember 2011 until trial in November 2013.\n\n{13} During the first time period, the parties individually or jointly filed at least a dozen\nmotions for continuance stating a variety of reasons, including to negotiate a plea deal that\npotentially included other charges against Defendant, to prepare for trial, and to complete\ndiscovery. Defendant either stipulated to each of the State’s motions or did not oppose them.\nFor the first time on appeal, Defendant asserts that he stipulated to or jointly filed the\nnumerous motions for continuance which stated as grounds the need to continue plea\ndiscussions because of the apparent policy of the Second Judicial District Attorney’s Office\nthat only allowed plea negotiations prior to the victim being interviewed. This is the same\npolicy that we previously disfavored in Serros because “it is well settled that the possibility\nof a plea agreement does not relieve the State of its duty to pursue a timely disposition of the\ncase.” 2016-NMSC-008, ¶¶ 69, 71-72 (citing State v. Maddox, 2008-NMSC-062, ¶ 26, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2636528\"><a href=\"/opinion/2636528/state-v-maddox/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“The State must affirmatively seek to move the case to trial, even\nwhile plea negotiations are pending.”)). Here, the plea negotiations were complicated and\ndelayed by Defendant’s admission to a parole violation on June 2, 2009, the filing of\nadditional criminal sexual penetration charges against Defendant in September 2009, and the\nparties’ effort to reach a plea deal with respect to all charges pending against Defendant and\nnot just the charges in this case. There is no evidence that the State deliberately delayed the\ncase during this time, and therefore these nineteen months from September 8, 2008 until\nApril 2010 weigh only slightly against the State.\n\n{14} During the second time period, Defendant concedes that he was responsible for\ndelaying the trial from April 2010 until February 2011. However, Defendant was also\nresponsible for the delay from March 2011 until April 2011 because his attorney missed a\nhearing and filed a motion for a continuance due to a scheduling conflict in another case.\nOn May 2, 2011, Defendant filed a request for judicial recusal. This motion was denied, and\nthe judge found that the motion was filed for the purpose of delaying the trial. On May 6,\n2011, Defendant petitioned this Court to issue an extraordinary writ reversing the district\njudge. We denied the writ on May 27, 2011. The time relating to Defendant’s petition for\nan extraordinary writ cannot be weighed against the State, and in any event, Defendant\naccepted responsibility for this delay. The district court set the trial for September 6, 2011;\ntherefore, we hold that Defendant is solely responsible for the seventeen-month delay from\nApril 2010 to September 2011.\n\n{15} The third time period, the twenty-six-month delay from September 2011 until\nNovember 2013, involved the district court’s consideration of numerous motions filed by\nboth parties and an appeal to this Court. The State appealed an order which excluded a\nstatement Defendant made to his counselor, Tewana Bell, which Bell later relayed to police\nofficers. In that statement, Defendant told Bell that he had sex with someone whose\n\n                                               5\n\fdescription was consistent with the physical characteristics of the alleged victim. The\ndistrict court entered its order on December 15, 2011 excluding Defendant’s statement\nbecause of the psychotherapist-patient privilege. See Rule 11-504 NMRA.\n\n{16} The State then filed a notice of appeal with the district court on December 16, 2011.\nThe State appealed to the Court of Appeals, which transferred the appeal to this Court\npursuant to State v. Smallwood, 2007-NMSC-005, ¶ 11, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nbecause Defendant, if found guilty, might be sentenced to life in prison. For speedy trial\npurposes in weighing the responsibility assigned to a party for delay caused by an\ninterlocutory appeal, courts may consider several factors, including “the strength of the\nGovernment’s position on the appealed issue, the importance of the issue in the posture of\nthe case, and—in some cases—the seriousness of the crime.” United States v. Loud Hawk,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111554\"><a href=\"/opinion/111554/united-states-v-loud-hawk/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 315 (1986). Applying the Loud Hawk analysis, we conclude that the delay\nfrom the filing of the appeal until our disposition should weigh neutrally because there were\nno unusual delays. First, the State certified that the appeal was not taken for the purpose of\ndelay and that the evidence would have been substantial proof of a material fact. Second,\nwe are persuaded that the evidence was important because, if admitted, it served as evidence\nthat Defendant admitted to having sex with someone who had the specific characteristics of\nthe alleged victim. Third, it illustrated the seriousness of a crime that Defendant could be\nsubjected to a sentence of life in prison if he were found guilty. Ultimately, this Court issued\na dispositional order affirming the district court. State v. Samora, No. 33,394, dispositional\norder of affirmance ¶ 13 (N.M. Sup. Ct. Aug. 29, 2013).\n\n{17} Further, the three and one-half months of motions from September 6, 2011 until\nDecember 16, 2011 and the two and one-half months between our dispositional order and\nthe actual trial on November 12, 2013 are administrative delays which weigh, if at all, only\nslightly against the State.\n\n{18} To summarize how we have weighed the reasons for the delay, twenty-five months\nweigh slightly against the State, seventeen months weigh against Defendant, and twenty\nmonths weigh neutrally. Considered together, the parties bear a similar responsibility for\nthe delays, and this factor weighs only slightly against the State.\n\nC.      Assertion of the right\n\n{19} Under this factor, “[w]e accord weight to the frequency and force of the defendant’s\nobjections to the delay and analyze the defendant’s actions with regard to the delay.” State\nv. Spearman, 2012-NMSC-023, ¶ 31, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). This inquiry is “closely related to the other Barker factors, because ‘[t]he strength\nof [the defendant’s] efforts will be affected by the length of the delay, to some extent by the\nreason for the delay, and most particularly by the personal prejudice, which is not always\nreadily identifiable, that [the defendant] experiences.’ ” Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 31\n(quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at 531) (alterations in original). Further, “[t]he timeliness and\nvigor with which the right is asserted may be considered as an indication of whether a\n\n                                               6\n\fdefendant was denied needed access to [a] speedy trial over his objection or whether the\nissue was raised on appeal as [an] afterthought.” Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 76 (second and\nthird alterations in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n{20} Defendant did not meaningfully assert his right, and therefore this factor does not\nsupport his speedy trial claim. Defendant made a pro forma assertion of his right on October\n30, 2008, when the Public Defender Department entered its appearance on his behalf. The\nonly other time he asserted the right was five years later in his October 25, 2013 motion to\ndismiss on speedy trial grounds. Considered alone, these two assertions would often be\nenough to weigh this factor slightly in favor of Defendant. See, e.g., Spearman, 2012-\nNMSC-023, ¶¶ 32-33 (holding that the defendant’s initial pro forma assertion along with a\nmotion to dismiss based on a speedy trial violation weighed against the State). However,\nDefendant’s assertions of the right were mitigated by his acquiescence to, and responsibility\nfor, numerous delays. See Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 34 (holding that the defendant’s\nassertion of the right at the outset of the case along with a motion to dismiss based on a\nspeedy trial violation weighed “slightly” in the defendant’s favor where the assertion was\nnot “mitigated . . . by any apparent acquiescence to the delay” by the defendant). In this\ncase, Defendant either stipulated to or did not oppose the State’s numerous motions for a\ncontinuance and was himself responsible for seventeen months of delay. Admittedly, it is\ndifficult to determine whether Defendant only stipulated to the continuances because of the\ndistrict attorney’s policy of not allowing plea deals after pretrial interviews with victims.\nIn the petition for continuance filed on December 4, 2009, the State noted that “Defendant\nhas chosen to forgo pretrial interviews of the victims until all written discovery is complete\nin both cases and to encourage a more favorable plea offer from the State.” This may\nsuggest that Defendant at least partially stipulated to the continuances because of the district\nattorney’s policy. Further, in the petition for continuance filed on March 3, 2010, the State\nsaid that “[t]he parties are in the process of setting up pretrial interviews and preparing for\ntrial in both cases should negotiations fall through . . . .” While this also may suggest that\nDefendant stipulated due to the policy, it is certainly not conclusive. If Defendant felt\ncompelled to concur in the State’s motions for a continuance because of the district\nattorney’s policy, he could have stated so in a pleading to the district court so that the court\ncould consider Defendant’s position in assessing whether to grant or deny the motion. We\nare left to speculate whether Defendant truly felt compelled to stipulate to the continuances\nor whether his counsel simply decided it was not urgent to conduct pre-trial interviews\nbecause Defendant had access to J.Z.’s safehouse interview and could prepare his case on\nthat basis. Defendant also demonstrated a lack of concern for his speedy trial right by\ndelaying his trial for seventeen months. Defendant’s assertion of his speedy trial right only\nat the very beginning and very end of the pretrial period, his continued stipulations to the\nState’s continuances, and his own significant contributions to the delay all show that his\nassertion of his speedy trial right was only an afterthought, and therefore this factor does not\nweigh in his favor.\n\nD.     Prejudice\n\n\n                                               7\n\f{21} This Court must analyze three separate interests to determine whether Defendant\nsuffered prejudice: “(i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety\nand concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be\nimpaired.” Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 35 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nDefendant must make a particularized showing of prejudice to demonstrate a violation of any\nof the three interests. Id. ¶¶ 35, 37. Because some oppression and anxiety are inevitably\nsuffered by every defendant awaiting trial, “we weigh this factor in the defendant’s favor\nonly where the pretrial incarceration or the anxiety suffered is undue.” Id. ¶ 35.\n\n{22} Here, Defendant has not asserted any particularized prejudice, such as identifying a\nwitness whose memory may have been impaired by the delay. See Serros, 2016-NMSC-008,\n¶ 92 (holding that the inability to interview the very young victim for four years prejudiced\nthe defendant’s ability to defend himself at trial). Nor has Defendant made a particularized\nshowing that he suffered undue anxiety or oppressive pretrial incarceration. Furthermore,\ndespite being incarcerated for more than five years while awaiting trial in this case,\nDefendant would have been incarcerated on the new CSP charge brought in September 2009,\nand other serious criminal charges were also brought against him a year into the pendency\nof this case. Cf. id. ¶¶ 88-91 (determining that the defendant being held in segregated\nprotective custody on a single charge for over four years was extremely prejudicial). We\nhold that Defendant did not articulate any particularized prejudice that he suffered as a result\nof the lengthy delay in this case.\n\n5.     Balancing the factors\n\n{23} To find a speedy trial violation without a showing of actual prejudice, the Court must\nfind that the three other Barker factors weigh heavily against the State. Garza, 2009-NMSC-\n038, ¶ 39. While the extraordinary length of the delay in this case weighs heavily against\nthe State, the reasons for the delay weigh only slightly against the State, and Defendant did\nnot meaningfully assert his speedy trial right. Therefore, we conclude that there was no\nspeedy trial violation. Accordingly, we must examine Defendant’s other claims.\n\nB.     The District Court Committed Fundamental Error by Failing to Instruct on the\n       Consent Element of CSP-Felony\n\n{24} The district court instructed the jury that to convict Defendant of CSP, CSC, or\nkidnapping, the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed an act that was\n“unlawful.” The jury instructions defined an unlawful act as follows: “For the act to have\nbeen unlawful it must have been done with the intent to arouse or gratify sexual desire or to\nintrude upon the bodily integrity or personal safety of [J.Z.].” This instruction reflected UJI\n14-132 NMRA, except that it failed to include the bracketed phrase “without consent,”\nwhich would have clarified that any sexual contact between J.Z. and Defendant had to be\nnon-consensual for the jury to determine that Defendant’s act was “unlawful.”\n\n{25}   If unlawfulness is at issue, then consent is an essential element of CSP-felony. CSP\n\n                                               8\n\fis defined, in relevant part, as “the unlawful and intentional causing of a person to engage\nin . . . anal intercourse . . . whether or not there is any emission.” Section 30-9-11(A). The\ncrime of CSP-felony requires that CSP be perpetrated “in the commission of any other\nfelony.” Section 30-9-11(E)(5). In State v. Stevens, we examined historical sources relevant\nto CSP-felony and determined that the Legislature “has never deviated from the common law\napproach of criminalizing only those sex acts that are perpetrated on persons without their\nconsent, either as a matter of fact or, in the case of children or other vulnerable victims, as\na matter of law.” 2014-NMSC-011, ¶ 27, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Accordingly, we concluded that\nthe CSP-felony offense was intended to criminalize only “sexual acts perpetrated on persons\nwithout their consent . . . .” Id. ¶ 39 (emphasis added). Therefore, to convict under this\nprovision, the jury must determine that the underlying felony was “committed against the\nvictim of, and . . . assist[ed] in the accomplishment of, sexual penetration perpetrated by\nforce or coercion against a victim who, by age or other statutory factor,” did not or could not\ngive lawful consent. Id.\n\n{26} Here, the State provided the unlawfulness jury instruction to the district court and\nargued that “without consent” had been properly omitted because the issue of consent was\n“legally irrelevant” to the unlawfulness of CSP-felony in this case under State v. Moore,\n2011-NMCA-089, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"892714\"><a href=\"/opinion/892714/state-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Yet, as the State acknowledges on appeal,\nMoore is inapplicable to this case. Moore held that “the consent of a statutorily defined\nchild is irrelevant to the unlawfulness element of CSP[-felony],” and it was therefore proper\nin Moore to omit the phrase “without consent” from the jury instructions when the alleged\nvictim was fourteen years old and the defendant was forty-six years old. Id. ¶¶ 13-16. As\nwe noted in Stevens, 2014-NMSC-011, ¶¶ 20, 40, Moore’s reference to a “ ‘statutorily\ndefined child’ ” meant a child “below the age of consent.” The age of consent, and whether\nthe lack of consent is an aspect of the unlawfulness element of CSP, varies statutorily\ndepending on the perpetrator’s age, the child’s age, and other factors as follows. Under\nSection 30-9-11(D), any sexual penetration of a child under thirteen years old is first-degree\nCSP because the child cannot legally consent to sex. Section 30-9-11(E)(1) punishes as\nsecond-degree CSP any sexual penetration of a child between the ages of thirteen and\neighteen years old by the use of force or coercion. Under that form of CSP, if the\nprosecution has proved that force or coercion was used by the perpetrator, it has also\nnecessarily proved that the act was non-consensual, and a separate finding of a lack of\nconsent is not required. See State v. Perea, 2008-NMCA-147, ¶ 9, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“Consent of a child between the ages of thirteen and sixteen to engage in sexual\nintercourse is irrelevant where force or coercion is involved.”). Section 30-9-11(G)(1)\npunishes any sexual penetration, regardless of consent, where the child is between thirteen\nand sixteen years old and the perpetrator is at least eighteen years old, is at least four years\nolder than the child, and is not the child’s spouse. See Moore, 2011-NMCA-089, ¶ 11\n(concluding that “[a child’s] consent or lack thereof is legally irrelevant” under Section 30-9-\n11(6)(1)). Finally, under Section 30-9-11(G)(2), consent is irrelevant when the child is\nbetween the ages of thirteen and eighteen years old and the perpetrator is a school employee\nor volunteer, the perpetrator is at least eighteen years old, is at least four years older than the\nchild, and is not the child’s spouse, and the perpetrator learns while performing services for\n\n                                                9\n\fthe school that the child is a student at the school. Unlike in Moore, where the victim was\nfourteen years old, whether J.Z. consented to sex with Defendant was legally relevant to the\nCSP-felony charge because sixteen-year-old J.Z. could have legally consented to sex with\nDefendant. Therefore, the omission of “without consent” from the jury instructions was\nerroneous.\n\n{27} Because Defendant failed to object to the proffered jury instruction or otherwise\npreserve this issue at trial, we will only reverse if the omission of “without consent” was\nfundamental error. See Stevens, 2014-NMSC-011, ¶ 42. “Fundamental error only applies\nin exceptional circumstances when guilt is so doubtful that it would shock the judicial\nconscience to allow the conviction to stand.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). Under this standard, we must determine whether a reasonable juror would have\nbeen confused or misdirected “not only from instructions that are facially contradictory or\nambiguous, but from instructions which, through omission or misstatement, fail to provide\nthe juror with an accurate rendition of the relevant law.” State v. Benally, 2001-NMSC-033,\n¶ 12, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2631833\"><a href=\"/opinion/2631833/state-v-benally/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2631833\"><a href=\"/opinion/2631833/state-v-benally/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. “In applying the fundamental error analysis to deficient\njury instructions, we are required to reverse when the misinstruction leaves us with ‘no way\nof knowing whether the conviction was or was not based on the lack of the essential\nelement.’ ” State v. Montoya, 2013-NMSC-020, ¶ 14, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (quoting State v. Swick,\n2012-NMSC-018, ¶ 46, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">).\n\n{28} “[I]f the instructions omitted an element which was at issue in the case, the error\ncould be fundamental.” State v. Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, ¶ 9, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607452\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607452/state-v-orosco/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607452\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607452/state-v-orosco/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Accordingly, we initially examine whether J.Z.’s consent was at issue in this case to\ndetermine whether the omission of this element could be fundamental error. Cf. id. ¶¶ 9-20\n(concluding that it was not fundamental error to omit the unlawfulness element of criminal\nsexual contact of a minor under age thirteen where there was no evidence putting the\nlawfulness of the alleged acts “in issue,” and therefore “no rational jury could have\nconcluded that defendants had committed the acts without also determining that the acts\nwere performed in the manner proscribed by law”). There is some evidence in the record\nthat could have led the jury to infer that consent was at issue in this case. First, there was\nno evidence of physical injuries to corroborate J.Z.’s story that Defendant held him down\nand forced him to have sex. Second, during his interview with police Defendant did not deny\nhaving sex on May 25, 2008, so it would be possible to infer that he had consensual sex with\nJ.Z. on that date. Third, Defendant’s rigorous cross-examination of J.Z. focused on J.Z.’s\nchanging account of the alleged sexual assault and his alleged unreliability. If the jury\nbelieved that J.Z. was in some way unreliable or not telling the truth, the jurors could have\nreasonably concluded that Defendant and J.Z. went to a remote location and engaged in\nconsensual sex. Based on this testimony, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence\npresented to the jury to put consent at issue in this case, and we must therefore determine\nwhether the omission of this essential element was fundamental error.\n\n{29} Fundamental error occurs when jury instructions fail to inform the jurors that the\nState has the burden of proving an essential element of a crime and we are left with “no way\n\n                                             10\n\fof knowing” whether the jury found that element beyond a reasonable doubt. Swick,\n2012-NMSC-018, ¶ 46; see also Rule 5-608(A) NMRA (“The court must instruct the jury\nupon all questions of law essential for a conviction of any crime submitted to the jury.”).\nHowever, we need not conclude that there was fundamental error despite the court’s failure\nto instruct on an essential element where “the jury’s findings, in light of the undisputed\nevidence in the case, necessarily establish that the [omitted] element was met beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” Orosco, 1992-NMSC-006, ¶ 15. For instance, in Stevens we held that\nit was not fundamental error to omit the element of unlawfulness from a CSP-felony\ninstruction because the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged sexual act\noccurred between the thirteen-year-old victim and the defendant’s boyfriend, who was at\nleast ten years older than the victim, and that under those circumstances, the sexual act could\nnot be other than unlawful. 2014-NMSC-011, ¶¶ 43-46. In other words, the jury’s finding\nin Stevens that the sexual act occurred beyond a reasonable doubt was necessarily also a\nfinding that the act was unlawful beyond a reasonable doubt because the victim in that case\ncould not legally consent to sex with that defendant, and there was no other evidence\nsuggesting that the alleged sexual act could have been otherwise lawful, such as a touching\nfor purposes of reasonable medical treatment. See id. Further, in State v. Cunningham, the\nfailure to instruct on the essential element of unlawfulness or self-defense was not\nfundamental error because the jury received a separate self-defense instruction containing\nthe appropriate burden of proof and the jurors specifically found beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant did not act in self-defense, a finding which also satisfied the essential\nelement that was erroneously excluded. 2000-NMSC-009, ¶¶ 9, 20-22, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1356445\"><a href=\"/opinion/1356445/state-v-cunningham/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1356445\"><a href=\"/opinion/1356445/state-v-cunningham/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n{30} Turning to this case, to ascertain whether fundamental error occurred, we must\n“review the entire record, placing the jury instructions in the context of the individual facts\nand circumstances of the case, to determine whether the Defendant’s conviction was the\nresult of a plain miscarriage of justice.” State v. Sutphin, 2007-NMSC-045, ¶ 19, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">191</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2631120\"><a href=\"/opinion/2631120/state-v-sutphin/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The State argues that if\nthe omission of the entire “unlawful” element was not fundamental error in Stevens, then the\ndistrict court’s inclusion of that element and omission of only two words (“without consent”)\ncannot be fundamental error in this case. However, as we have previously discussed,\nunlawfulness is at issue in this case, where at age sixteen the alleged victim had passed the\nage of consent, unlike the thirteen-year-old victim in Stevens who legally could not consent\npursuant to Section 30-9-11(G)(1), and the conclusion that no fundamental error occurred\nin Stevens is therefore not dispositive here. The State further contends that the jury’s other\nfindings demonstrate that the jurors must have ultimately concluded that J.Z. did not consent\nto anal penetration by Defendant.\n\n{31} The jury convicted Defendant of kidnapping by finding beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat J.Z. was taken, restrained, confined, or transported by force, intimidation, or deception\nby Defendant. As part of the kidnapping conviction, the jury also found that Defendant\nintended to hold J.Z. against his will to inflict death, physical injury, or a sexual offense on\nhim. However, the jury’s conclusions regarding Defendant’s act of kidnapping do not\n\n                                              11\n\festablish beyond a reasonable doubt that it considered Defendant’s separate act of anally\npenetrating J.Z. to have been non-consensual beyond a reasonable doubt, despite the fact that\nit found the anal penetration in this case to have taken place during the commission of\nkidnapping. The jury further found that Defendant committed a “sexual offense” against J.Z.\nduring the kidnapping, despite the absence of a definition of “sexual offense” in the jury\ninstruction. Therefore, the jury also could have reached this finding without an\nunderstanding that in this case, it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the anal\npenetration was non-consensual for Defendant’s act to constitute a sexual offense. Finally,\nthe jury hung on an alternative CSP-force/coercion count with respect to Defendant’s anal\npenetration of J.Z. The only significant distinction between the jury instructions regarding\nCSP-force/coercion and those regarding CSP-felony was that the CSP-force/coercion\ninstruction required the jury to additionally conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that\nDefendant used physical force, physical violence, or threats of physical force or physical\nviolence against J.Z. While a finding that force or coercion was used during the sexual\npenetration is certainly not necessary to establish a lack of consent, if the jury had found this\nelement beyond a reasonable doubt under the alternative count, we would have no\nmisgivings in concluding that the jury also necessarily found beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe sexual penetration in this case was non-consensual. Yet the jury apparently hung on this\nvery element, and we therefore cannot draw any definitive conclusions regarding the jury’s\nunderstanding of the role of consent from their findings regarding the CSP-force/coercion\ncharge.\n\n{32} Moreover, we agree with Defendant that the juror questions submitted during trial\nhinted at juror confusion regarding the issue of consent. The record indicates that several\njuror questions were submitted to the district judge after the jurors were provided with the\ninstructions. In one of those questions, a juror asked “[h]ow old you have to be to have\nconsentual [sic] sex . . . ? We think [the SANE nurse] said the age was 13.” Indeed, the\nSANE nurse who examined J.Z. testified that the age of consent in New Mexico was\nthirteen. Another juror asked what it meant that Defendant’s act needed to be “unlawful,”\nand further stated that the term “seems conclus[ory] or unnecessary.” The district court\nresponded to these questions by instructing the jurors, “you are to decide this case based on\nthe testimony at trial and the jury instructions as a whole.” These questions indicate some\nlevel of confusion regarding the age of consent in New Mexico and the meaning of the\n“unlawful act” element of CSP-felony, and further support our conclusion that the jurors in\nthis case may have been confused or misdirected as to whether Defendant could have still\nacted unlawfully if J.Z. had consented to sex. See Benally, 2001-NMSC-033, ¶ 12 (“Under\n[fundamental error review,] we seek to determine whether a reasonable juror would have\nbeen confused or misdirected by the jury instruction.” (emphasis added) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted)). Accordingly, we hold that in the circumstances of this case,\nit was fundamental error to omit the element of consent from the jury instructions that were\nrelevant to CSP-felony.\n\n{33} Defendant only requests that his CSP-felony conviction be reversed as a result of this\nerror. However, we are responsible for determining whether this fundamental error also\n\n                                               12\n\finfected his conviction for kidnapping. See State v.

We conclude that the error of omitting the element of consent from\nthe jury instruction affected the kidnapping conviction. The jury instructions did not define\nthe term “sexual offense” beyond providing the elements of CSP and CSC through other\ninstructions. Because the jury may have been confused or misdirected as to whether\nconsensual sex between J.Z. and Defendant could still be a sexual offense, then the jury’s\nfinding under the kidnapping charge that Defendant intended to inflict death, physical injury,\nor a sexual offense on J.Z. was necessarily infected by the same potential confusion,\naffecting the verdict on the kidnapping charge in this case where there was not sufficient\nevidence to support the inference that Defendant intended to inflict death or a physical injury\non J.Z. Therefore, because we cannot determine whether the jury found that the sexual act\nwas non-consensual beyond a reasonable doubt, we must also reverse Defendant’s\nkidnapping conviction for fundamental error.\n\n{34} Because we have determined that we must reverse Defendant’s convictions for CSP-\nfelony and kidnapping, we are required to determine whether sufficient evidence was\npresented to support these convictions to avoid double jeopardy concerns should the State\nseek to retry Defendant.

In doing so, we view “the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the guilty verdict, indulging all reasonable inferences and\nresolving all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the verdict.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n\n{35} There was sufficient evidence to support Defendant’s kidnapping and CSP-felony\nconvictions. In this case, the alleged victim’s testimony was by itself enough to establish\nevery element of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt under a sufficiency of the evidence\nreview. The jury could have reasonably inferred that Defendant took or transported J.Z. by\ndeception based on J.Z.’s testimony that he got into Defendant’s truck because Defendant\nsaid that he would take J.Z. home. Alternatively, J.Z. also testified that when he tried to\nescape from Defendant’s truck, the door was locked—testimony from which the jurors could\nhave reasonably concluded that Defendant confined J.Z. by force. Further, the jurors could\nhave reasonably inferred that Defendant intended to hold J.Z. against J.Z.’s will to inflict a\nsexual offense against him based on J.Z.’s testimony that Defendant took him to a remote\nlocation, pulled down J.Z.’s pants, and then penetrated his anus. This evidence also supports\na reasonable inference that Defendant caused J.Z. to engage in anal intercourse.\nAdditionally, the jury also could have reasonably concluded that Defendant’s statement to\n\n                                              13\n\fJ.Z. after ejaculating—“Now I can take you home”—indicated that Defendant transported\nJ.Z. to a remote location and confined him there for the purpose of inflicting a sexual offense\non him. J.Z.’s testimony regarding the sexual act in this case also supported a reasonable\ninference that Defendant’s act against J.Z. was unlawful because the jury could have inferred\nthat it was done without J.Z.’s consent and for the purpose of gratifying Defendant’s sexual\ndesire or to intrude upon J.Z.’s bodily safety or integrity. Further, because J.Z.’s account\nsupported a conviction for kidnapping, the jury could have reasonably determined that the\nCSP in this case was committed during the course of the kidnapping since the sexual\npenetration occurred while J.Z. was either being transported by deception or confined by\nforce. Ultimately, if the jury believed J.Z.’s story regarding his encounter with Defendant,\nit could have reasonably found that every element of both crimes was met beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Therefore, Defendant may be retried on both charges.\n\n{36} Because we have determined that the omission of consent from the jury instructions\nrose to the level of fundamental error and requires reversal of both convictions, we need not\nreach the other issues raised by Defendant. However, to provide guidance on remand, we\naddress (1) the admission of GPS evidence and online identification evidence, and (2) the\nscope of Defendant’s cross-examination of J.Z., but not any of the other arguments raised\nby Defendant.

The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Admitting Evidence\n       Regarding J.Z.’s Identification of Defendant via the Internet or by Allowing\n       Testimony Regarding the Fact that Defendant Was Subject to GPS Monitoring\n\n{37} Defendant claims that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence\nthat he wore a GPS monitoring device and that J.Z. found Defendant’s picture, name, and\naddress on an Internet website. Absent a clear abuse of discretion, we will not reverse a trial\njudge’s decision to admit evidence. State v. Apodaca, 1994-NMSC-121, ¶ 23, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160124\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160124/state-v-apodaca/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">762</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160124\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160124/state-v-apodaca/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. “An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is clearly against the\nlogic and effect of the facts and circumstances of the case. We cannot say the trial court\nabused its discretion by its ruling unless we can characterize it as clearly untenable or not\njustified by reason.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n{38} Prior to trial, Defendant filed a motion to exclude any evidence that he wore a GPS\ntracker and was subject to GPS monitoring by the State, and any evidence that J.Z. identified\nDefendant while viewing New Mexico’s online sex offender registry. The district court ruled\nthat the State could elicit the fact that Defendant was wearing a GPS device, but that it could\nnot describe the nature of Defendant’s underlying conviction. The district court later\nspecified that if the GPS monitoring information was elicited through the testimony of parole\nauthorities, they should simply be introduced as employees of the State of New Mexico\nwithout any further detail. The district court further held that the State could introduce\nevidence that J.Z. found Defendant’s picture and other identifying information “on the\n\n                                              14\n\fInternet,” but could not be more specific about the nature of the website.\n\n{39} As an initial matter, we reject Defendant’s argument that we should consider his offer\nto stipulate to being with J.Z. at the time and place of the alleged sexual assault as precluding\nthe State’s need for the online identification and GPS evidence admitted by the district court.\nThe State is “not bound to present its case to the jury through abstract stipulations,” despite\na defendant’s offer to stipulate to certain facts. State v. Martinez, 1999-NMSC-018, ¶ 34,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1277506\"><a href=\"/opinion/1277506/state-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">7, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1191871\"><a href=\"/opinion/1191871/state-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. For example, in State v. Sarracino, this Court held that it was\nnot an abuse of discretion to allow the State to elicit testimony regarding statements made\nby the defendant while threatening a couple with a gun when the defendant had offered to\nstipulate to making the statements and had claimed that the circumstances surrounding their\nadmission would be impermissible evidence of prior bad acts. 1998-NMSC-022, ¶¶ 5, 21-\n22, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2617117\"><a href=\"/opinion/2617117/state-v-sarracino/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2617117\"><a href=\"/opinion/2617117/state-v-sarracino/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In that case, we looked only to whether the evidence of this\nuncharged prior bad act fit within an exception to Rule 11-404(B) NMRA, and did not\nconsider the defendant’s stipulation offer in our analysis. See Sarracino, 1998-NMSC-022,\n¶ 22. Similarly, in this case we need not consider Defendant’s offer to stipulate that he was\nwith J.Z. at the times and places alleged to determine whether the GPS and online\nidentification evidence was admissible under either Rule 11-404(B) or Rule 11-403 NMRA,\nor whether it improperly bolstered J.Z.’s testimony.\n\n{40} We also disagree with Defendant’s contention that admission of “[t]he fact that\n[Defendant] was on GPS monitoring and that his name and address were listed on a website\ninexorably leads to one conclusion: he was a convicted sex offender” and that this evidence\nwas therefore improper evidence of prior bad acts under Rule 11-404(B). Rule 11-404(B)(1)\nexcludes “[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act . . . to prove a person’s character in\norder to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with [that]\ncharacter.” This rule only “prohibits the use of otherwise relevant evidence when its sole\npurpose or effect is to prove criminal propensity.” State v. Gallegos, 2007-NMSC-007, ¶\n22, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2635298\"><a href=\"/opinion/2635298/state-v-gallegos/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (emphasis added). However, such “evidence may be\nadmissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\nplan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.” Rule 11-404(B)(2). In\nconsidering the online identification evidence in this case, the district court opined that\n“nowadays computer access and computer use is very common . . . . I’ve thought about the\nwhole issue of computer access and computer use, and we’re in a new age, and it’s the 21st\ncentury, and it’s just a fact of life.” We hold that it was not an abuse of discretion for the\ndistrict court to conclude that the limited information admitted regarding J.Z.’s identification\nof Defendant through online information did not constitute evidence of a crime, a wrong, or\nanother act under Rule 11-404(B). The district court also determined that evidence of\nDefendant’s GPS coordinates on the date of the alleged crime and the fact that he was\nwearing a GPS tracking device were admissible because they showed “identity, opportunity\nand lack of mistake.” We again conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion in this case\nto admit limited evidence that Defendant was on GPS monitoring. The evidence did not\nhave the sole purpose or effect of proving criminal propensity, but was instead probative to\nmaterial facts in the case because (1) J.Z. testified that the person who assaulted him was\n\n                                               15\n\fwearing a GPS monitor on his belt, which Defendant was required to wear; and (2)\nDefendant’s GPS coordinates placed him in the same locations where J.Z. claimed to have\nbeen assaulted.\n\n{41} We reject Defendant’s additional contention that the probative value of the online\nidentification and GPS evidence was substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair\nprejudice from its admission under Rule 11-403. As we have previously discussed, the\ndistrict court limited the online identification evidence presented at trial to completely\nexclude the fact that J.Z. found Defendant’s picture at an online sex offender registry. The\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this limited version of J.Z.’s\nidentification of Defendant because it was reasonable to conclude that the mere fact that J.Z.\nfound Defendant’s picture, name, and address online, without any additional information,\nwas completely unremarkable and neither reflected negatively on Defendant nor created a\ndanger of unfair prejudice. Similarly, the GPS evidence was limited to prevent any mention\nof why Defendant was being monitored. Under the circumstances of this case, the generic\ninformation that Defendant was subject to GPS monitoring was not overly prejudicial, and\ncontrary to Defendant’s suggestion, did not strongly imply that Defendant was a sex\noffender. During the hearing on Defendant’s motion to exclude, the district court concluded\nthat individuals may wear a GPS device and be monitored by state employees for a variety\nof reasons, including pretrial monitoring programs and probation in cases not involving sex\noffenses. Indeed, during voir dire, two prospective jurors mentioned that they associated\nGPS monitoring with a DWI or other alcohol-related offense, but none of the prospective\njurors mentioned any specific association with sex offenses. Thus, we do not conclude that\nthere was an abuse of discretion in the district court’s admission of the information that\nDefendant was subject to GPS monitoring by the State, without anything more, because any\nprejudice to Defendant did not substantially outweigh the probative value of this evidence\nin identifying Defendant as J.Z.’s alleged attacker.\n\n{42} Finally, we reject Defendant’s contention that presenting the online identification and\nGPS evidence improperly bolstered J.Z.’s credibility. Evidence will be excluded as\nimproper bolstering when it directly comments on a witness’s credibility, but not when it\nprovides “[i]ncidental verification” of a witness’s story or only indirectly bolsters that\nwitness’s credibility.

Alberico, 1993-NMSC-047, ¶ 89, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158206\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158206/state-v-alberico/\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. For example, in State v. Lucero, a psychiatrist’s testimony was improper bolstering\nwhen she commented directly on the victim’s credibility, repeatedly mentioned that the\nvictim claimed to have been assaulted by the defendant, and opined that the victim’s post-\ntraumatic stress disorder was caused by sexual molestation. 1993-NMSC-064, ¶¶ 5-6, 15-17,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201716\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201716/state-v-lucero/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201716\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201716/state-v-lucero/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1071</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. However, in this case the GPS evidence and online\nidentification evidence only corroborated J.Z.’s testimony; it did not comment directly on\nhis credibility or impinge in any way on the jury’s role of assessing J.Z.’s story and\ndetermining whether he was telling the truth. Therefore, the admission of this evidence was\nnot an abuse of the district court’s discretion.\n\nIV.    The District Court’s Limitation of Defendant’s Cross-Examination of J.Z. Was\n\n                                             16\n\f       Not an Abuse of Discretion and Did Not Violate Defendant’s Rights under the\n       Confrontation Clause\n\n{43} Defendant argues that the district court erred by limiting his cross-examination of\nJ.Z. Generally, “[t]he district court has broad discretion to control the scope of\ncross-examination, including the discretion to control cross-examination to ensure a fair and\nefficient trial.” State v. Bent, 2013-NMCA-108, ¶ 10, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (citation omitted). Prior\nto trial, the State filed a motion seeking to exclude Defendant from using any of J.Z.’s\njuvenile adjudications for impeachment purposes, to limit Defendant to only inquiring about\nthe number of J.Z.’s felony convictions, and to exclude Defendant from using the names of\nany of those felonies with the exception of J.Z.’s conviction for commercial burglary. The\nrecord indicates that Defendant did not file a written response. The district court held a\nhearing on this motion and ruled that (a) the names of J.Z.’s juvenile adjudications were not\nto be presented to the jury; (b) Defendant could mention J.Z.’s violations of his juvenile\nprobation right after the alleged incident with Defendant because that was “a matter of\nmotive”; (c) Defendant could not cross-examine J.Z. regarding J.Z.’s convictions for\npossession of a firearm by a felon and contributing to the delinquency of a minor as a result\nof a DWI because “it confuses the jury, it gets [them] into a mini trial,” while J.Z.’s other\nfelony convictions went to credibility and were fair game; (d) however, Defendant could\nrefer to the existence of these other felony convictions without naming them; and (e)\nDefendant could ask about charges pending against J.Z., but could not detail those charges\nand could not bring in extrinsic evidence to prove them.\n\n{44} First, Defendant contends that it was improper to limit cross-examination regarding\nJ.Z.’s prior convictions and his experience with the criminal justice system as an adult and\nas a juvenile. Under Rule 11-609(D) NMRA, prior juvenile adjudications are admissible for\nimpeachment of a witness only when they are offered in a criminal case, the witness is not\nthe defendant, an adult’s conviction for that offense would normally be admissible to attack\ncredibility, and admitting the evidence is necessary to fairly determine guilt or innocence.\nAt the hearing on the State’s motion, the district court indicated that Defendant could use\nJ.Z.’s juvenile criminal history to show that J.Z. was in juvenile detention when he first\naccused Defendant and that his detention may have given him a motive to lie. At the\nhearing, Defendant agreed that he did not need to name J.Z.’s prior juvenile convictions, and\nthe district court acknowledged that concession on the record. Therefore, Defendant did not\nproperly preserve for appeal any objection with respect to the scope of permissible cross-\nexamination regarding J.Z.’s juvenile convictions. See State v. Varela, 1999-NMSC-045,\n¶ 25, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1161590\"><a href=\"/opinion/1161590/state-v-varela/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1161590\"><a href=\"/opinion/1161590/state-v-varela/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“In order to preserve an error for appeal, it is essential\nthat the ground or grounds of the objection or motion be made with sufficient specificity to\nalert the mind of the trial court to the claimed error or errors, and that a ruling thereon then\nbe invoked.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n{45} As to J.Z.’s adult convictions, under Rule 11-609(A) the district court must admit\nprior adult convictions for impeachment purposes if (1) the conviction is for any crime that\nis punishable by imprisonment for more than a year, subject to the balancing test of Rule 11-\n\n                                              17\n\f403, or (2) the conviction is for any crime involving a dishonest act or false statement. The\ndistrict court permitted Defendant to refer by name to J.Z.’s felony convictions for\ncommercial burglary, conspiracy to tamper with evidence, and a probation violation on the\ncharge of receiving or transferring a stolen vehicle. The district court also exercised its\ndiscretion under Rule 11-609(A)(1) by preventing Defendant from mentioning by name\nJ.Z.’s prior convictions for possession of a firearm by a felon and contributing to the\ndelinquency of a minor under Rule 11-403. However, Defendant would still be allowed to\nrefer to the existence of these other felony convictions without naming those offenses. On\nappeal, Defendant does not state which specific convictions he should have been allowed to\nname, but instead merely makes a general reference to the jury’s potential “misunderstanding\nof [J.Z.’s] possible motives and the extent to which he was familiar with the horse-trading\naspect of the criminal justice system.” We hold that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in limiting how Defendant could refer to two of J.Z.’s prior adult felony\nconvictions. Contrary to Defendant’s arguments, the district court’s ruling still allowed\nDefendant to elicit that J.Z. had frequent encounters with the criminal justice system and to\nargue that J.Z. was exaggerating his story to get a deal on some of his other charges.\n\n{46} Second, Defendant asserts that it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to\nlimit his cross-examination of J.Z. regarding how J.Z. made his living on the streets,\nincluding the fact that J.Z. “used and/or sold drugs.” The record reflects that Defendant\nelicited testimony from J.Z. that J.Z. was hustling, panhandling, and selling drugs to survive\non the streets. The district court then cut off any additional questions from Defendant\nregarding how J.Z. made his living on the streets because the court reasoned that selling\ndrugs and being homeless was impermissible character evidence that was not relevant to any\nissues either in the case or to J.Z.’s credibility. However, the district court later allowed\nDefendant to elicit testimony from J.Z. that he had a bad memory from using drugs,\npresumably because that testimony was relevant to the jury’s assessment of J.Z.’s reliability\nas a witness. Under these circumstances, we conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion\nfor the district court to limit Defendant’s cross-examination regarding J.Z.’s homelessness\nor drug use since the specific issue of how J.Z. made his living on the streets was of minimal\nrelevance to any issues either in the case or to J.Z.’s credibility.\n\n{47} Third, Defendant claims that it was an improper abuse of discretion for the district\ncourt to prevent Defendant from providing J.Z. with transcripts of his safehouse interview\nwhile J.Z. was on the stand to refresh J.Z.’s recollection and then impeach him with prior\ninconsistent statements. “The admission or exclusion of [an] inconsistent statement rests\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial court under the particular facts in this case and will\nnot be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.” State v. Davis, 1981-NMSC-131, ¶ 20,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1168522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1168522/state-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1168522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1168522/state-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. During cross-examination, Defendant asked J.Z. whether J.Z.\nhad stated during his safehouse interview that Defendant punched him. J.Z. responded, “I\nbelieve so.” Defense counsel asked J.Z. to show him where in the transcript he had made this\nstatement. The State objected that showing J.Z. the transcript would be improper\nrefreshment and improper impeachment. The district court sustained this objection and did\nnot agree to Defendant’s proposal of letting J.Z. review the entire transcript because it would\n\n                                              18\n\fhave taken a significant amount of time and the issue was de minimus. Defendant was then\nallowed to resume his cross-examination of J.Z. regarding J.Z.’s safehouse statement, during\nwhich J.Z. stated that he was not sure what he said, that he may not have said it, and that he\ndid not know if he said it. J.Z. finally agreed that he did not say that Defendant had punched\nhim in the head during the interview. We conclude that the district court acted within its\ndiscretion to control cross-examination to ensure an efficient trial by denying Defendant’s\nrequest to have J.Z. review the entire transcript of the safehouse interview to confirm that\nhe never said he was hit in the head, and instead requiring Defendant to continue to cross-\nexamine J.Z. to elicit this statement through testimony. See Bent, 2013-NMCA-108, ¶ 10.\n\n{48} Fourth and finally, Defendant argues that these limitations on his cross-examination\nof J.Z. collectively violated Defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause. The\nConfrontation Clause “guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be\nconfronted with the witnesses against him.” Davis v. Alaska, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108974\"><a href=\"/opinion/108974/davis-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 315 (1974)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). However, “the trial court retains wide\nlatitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on . . .\ncross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice,\nconfusion of the issues, the witness’[s] safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only\nmarginally relevant.” State v. Smith, 2001-NMSC-004, ¶ 19, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2524378\"><a href=\"/opinion/2524378/state-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2524378\"><a href=\"/opinion/2524378/state-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(omission in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although the extent\nof cross-examination is within the sound discretion of the district court, we still review de\nnovo whether limits on cross-examination have violated the Confrontation Clause. Id.\n\n{49} We disagree with Defendant’s argument that the limitations on cross-examination\nin this case were analogous to those limitations held to be violations of the Confrontation\nClause by the United States Supreme Court in Davis. In Davis, the defendant, who was\naccused of stealing a safe, was prohibited from cross-examining a witness against him\nregarding the fact that the witness was on probation for burglary. 415 U.S. at 311-12. Davis\nheld that the district court’s limitations on cross-examination of the witness violated the\ndefendant’s confrontation rights because he was not permitted to produce evidence to create\nany record of the reason that the witness might potentially be biased or motivated to lie, such\nas the witness’s fear that the police might otherwise suspect the witness of committing the\ncrime, based on his prior criminal history. See id. at 317-18. Instead, “defense counsel\nshould have been permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole\ntriers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability\nof the witness.” Id. By contrast, here the district court’s limitations on cross-examination\ndid not prevent Defendant from creating a record regarding potential credibility problems\nwith J.Z.’s testimony. Indeed, the district court specifically did not limit Defendant’s cross-\nexamination regarding J.Z.’s prior convictions for crimes of dishonesty, and permitted\nDefendant to elicit general information illustrating that J.Z. had significant experience with\nthe criminal justice system and made his living by hustling on the streets, both of which also\nprovided fodder for Defendant’s argument that J.Z. had motivations to fabricate his story.\nTherefore, we conclude that the district court’s exercise of discretion to limit the extent of\nDefendant’s cross-examination of J.Z. was proper and did not violate Defendant’s rights\n\n                                              19\n\funder the Confrontation Clause.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n{50} We reverse Defendant’s convictions for CSP-felony and kidnapping and remand to\nthe district court, where Defendant may be retried on those charges.\n\n{51}   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                         ____________________________________\n                                         EDWARD L.
