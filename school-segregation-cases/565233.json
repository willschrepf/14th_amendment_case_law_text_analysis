In 1972, after the Board already had adopted Rule 4115.3 and had begun implementing procedures for correcting racial segregation in faculty assignments, a class-action suit was filed against the Board seeking to eliminate segregated conditions and their vestiges from the County school system.   Vaughns v. Bd of Educ. of Prince George's County, 355 F. Supp. 1034 (D.Md. 1972);  355 F. Supp. 1038 (D.Md. 1972);  355 F. Supp. 1051 (D.Md. 1972), aff'd, No. 73-1024 (4th Cir.  Jan. 23, 1973), cert. denied sub nom, 410 U.S. 910 (1973) (Vaughns I ).  In Vaughns I, The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, holding that the defendants had maintained a school system racially segregated by law until 1954 and had failed to take adequate steps to dismantle that system between 1954 and 1972.  As a result, the district court ordered the Board to develop a workable desegregation plan, but noted in its opinion that it had \"been informed by counsel for both sides that ... a plan for faculty [integration was] already in existence,\" referring to the existence of Rule 4115.3  Vaughns I, 355 F. Supp. 1034, 1037 n.3.  The agreements among the parties concerning a faculty desegregation plan were embodied in a consent decree dated February 20, 1974.  Vaughns II, 574 F. Supp. at 1284.  In 1974 and 1975, the district court relinquished jurisdiction in Vaughns subject to the right of any party to seek to have the court again resume jurisdiction.  Id. at 1284-85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 1, 1981, a motion to reopen the Vaughns litigation was filed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), alleging, inter alia, that the Board had disproportionately assigned black teachers to black schools and white teachers to white schools.  The district court found, after reviewing the history of the Vaughns litigation and the racial composition of the faculties of the County schools, that \"with respect to faculty assignments, there presently [were] no vestiges of past racial segregation, no indications since 1973 of any discriminatory actions of lack of actions, and no violations of any orders of\" the district court.   Vaughns v. Bd. of Educ. of Prince George's County, 574 F. Supp. 1280, 1293 (D.Md. 1983), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 758 F.2d 983 (4th Cir. 1985) (Vaughns II ).  The district court, therefore, declined the plaintiffs' request for court-ordered teacher reassignments.  However, the district court did find that vestiges of segregation did remain in student assignments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present action was brought in 1989 by 35 tenured teachers (32 white and 3 black).  The plaintiffs had been involuntarily transferred by the Board in derogation of their seniority pursuant to the Board's race-conscious faculty assignment policy.  All parties met and submitted detailed factual stipulations concerning the challenged policy.  Following briefing and oral argument, the district court decided that the challenged policies did not violate either the U.S. Constitution or Title VII, although the court did order several modifications to the teacher transfer policy which, in general, required it to be based on the racial makeup of the faculty rather than the community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After argument of this case in this court, the Supreme Court decided  Freeman v. Pitts, 60 U.S.L.W. 4286 (1992).  The principal holding in Freeman is that \" ... a district court is permitted to withdraw judicial supervision with respect to discrete categories in which the school district has achieved compliance with a court-ordered desegregation plan.  A district court need not retain active control of every aspect of school administration until a school district has demonstrated unitary status in all facets of its system.\"  60 U.S.L.W. at 4287.  The Court reasoned that \"[a] federal court in a school desegregation case has the discretion to order an incremental or partial withdrawal of its supervision and control.\" p.4292.  And, in discussing whether or not a district court should be prohibited from returning to the school district partial control over some of its affairs, its reasoning continued that \" ... a continuing violation in one area may need to be addressed by remedies in another.\"  60 U.S.L.W. at 4294.  It cited  Bradley v. Richmond School Board, 382 U.S. 103, 105 (1965) (per curiam), for the proposition that the relation between faculty allocation on a racial basis and the adequacy of desegregation plans is not entirely speculative, and, more importantly, the district court's opinion below,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> from which this case grew, for the proposition that \"the components of a school desegregation plan are interdependent upon, and interact with, one another, so that changes with respect to one component may impinge upon the success or failure of another.\" p.4295.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in our case, while it acknowledged that there was no need to continue assignment of faculty by race so far as the faculty itself was concerned, found that the racially based faculty assignment plan was critical to the desegregation plan of Prince Georges County.  It found that the faculty assignment plan was necessary to avoid a racially identifiable faculty, in default of which the success of the overall school desegregation program might well be threatened and result in the sole option of altered student assignment policies.  It found that \"[s]uch a drastic limitation with respect to alternatives may well doom the Board's pursuit of unitary status to failure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think these findings of the district court as to cause and effect are largely factual and are not clearly erroneous.
