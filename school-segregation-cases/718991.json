Board of Public Instruction of Orange County, 423 F.2d 203 (5th Cir. 1970) to be applicable. Thus a student transferring is given absolute priority for space, and he must be furnished free transportation.

When a transfer request is received by the school board during a school term, it may be denied at that time if there is no space available in the school to which the student wishes to transfer. In such a situation the transfer request will be deferred until the beginning of the next school term, at which time the transfer applicant will be given an absolute priority for space.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allen v. Board of Instruction of Broward County, Florida, 432 F.2d 362 (5th Cir., 1970). However, because the opening of school is at hand, and various changes are made by this court in student assignment, majority to minority transfer requests shall be honored if received within 14 days after the schools open. This requirement must be given thorough publicity to students and their parents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court order includes the <i>Singleton</i> requirements for staff and faculty. No complaint is made that as between schools these standards are not being carried out. However, the Negro plaintiffs assert that system-wide the board has systematically reduced the proportion of black teachers employed in the parish. Alternatively they assert that the number of black teachers has decreased as a result of closing black schools because of desegregation. The record does not establish these assertions. As to the latter it appears that all black teachers from closed black schools have been absorbed in the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As best we can tell, what plaintiffs really are claiming is that as places have become vacant from attrition not related to race and from diminished faculty requirements at some grade levels resulting from closing black schools, the Board's hiring practices in filling such vacancies have caused the number of black teachers in the system, and the proportion of black teachers in the system, to decrease while the number and proportion of white teachers have increased. If the complaint is of hiring practices, it must be presented first to the District Court. We do not have before us findings, a record, or even sufficiently clear statements of what is claimed for us to consider that issue. The bare statistics showing that for three years black teachers increased from 390 in the first year to 417 in the second, and decreased to 397 in the third, while whites increased from 1255 to 1379 to 1426, do not establish racially discriminatory hiring practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found the parties to be in agreement that, except for Wards 3 and 4, the school system is unitary with respect to student assignment. No objections are made to this finding. As to Ward 4, the record is slim, but plaintiffs interpose no objections to the finding that the system in that ward is unitary and we will not disturb it. Of the approximately 28 schools, of all levels, in the wards other than Ward 3, only one has a heavily black student body. The schools in these wards have projected 1970-71 enrollment of 16,516 students, 14,459 white (88%) and 2057 black (12%).<sup>4A</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The major issue is student assignment in Ward 3. Several plans have been before the District Court since the case was remanded by Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board, 417 F.2d 801 (5th Cir. 1969). Geographic zoning has been in effect since July, 1969. Following a hearing in April, 1970 the District Court concluded that the amended Board plan then presented did not convert the system to a unitary one and directed that zones in Ward 3 be redrawn so that each student would be assigned to attend the school nearest his home, limited only by the capacity of the school, as in Ellis v. Board of Public Instruction of Orange County, 423 F.2d 203 (5th Cir. 1970). The Board presented what appeared to be such a plan. The plaintiffs concede that it contained \"no trickery, no devices, no gerrymandering.\" Also, the HEW plan prepared in the summer of 1969 was before the court. The latter provides for pairing or clustering of schools, some close together, others many miles apart, and massive crosstown bussing. The District Court rejected it with the finding that \"[v]iewed from any direction, it would be a disaster.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the elementary grades and some junior high grades and one high school, the neighborhood plan which the Board submitted and the District Court approved was not adjusted for the maximum capacities of schools. The approved plan stated that \"adjustments [in student assignment] will have to be made for capacities.\" When capacities are matched against the assignments made by the neighborhood zones it is immediately apparent that a number of changes and adjustments must be made. The Board states that it planned to present to the District Court the matter of adjustments necessitated by overcapacity but before it could do so this appeal was filed. Under the requirements of Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed. 2d 19 (1959), we cannot await further proceedings at the District Court level to establish a constitutionally acceptable plan. A plan must be put into effect now under which the system will begin to operate immediately as a unitary system. The beginning of school is at hand. At the appellate level our alternatives are that we order the HEW plan put into effect immediately or that we make such changes and adjustments in the plan approved by the District Court as will bring it up to constitutional standards. For reasons set out below we have chosen the latter alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appendix A contains data for all Ward 3 schools based on projected 1970-71 enrollment. Considering approximately 90% or more black students as creating a black school, of approximately 36 schools in Ward 3 the plan approved by the District Court left in existence for the 1970-71 school year three black elementary schools (Cherry Street, Mill Street, and Opelousas/Jackson), a black junior-senior high school (Washington), and Lincoln (grades 1-8), which is so close to being black and so startlingly overcrowded as to require consideration along with the others:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <pre><i>Zone</i>                                                    <i>%</i>             <i>Over</i>\n<i>No.</i>  <i>School</i>          <i>Grades</i>     <i>Wh.</i>   <i>Bl.</i>     <i>Total</i>     <i>Bl.</i>    <i>Cap.</i>    <i>Cap.</i>\nE-4  Cherry St.        1-6       6    873      879     99.3%    630    249\nE-7  Mill St.          1-6       8    492      500     98.4%    840    340\nE-3  Opelousas/Jackson 1-6      17    706      723     97.6%   1260\nE-2  Lincoln           1-8     223   1409     1632     86.3%    990    642\nand\nJ-1\nJ-3 Washington        7-12      38   1454     1492     97.5%   1590\nand\nH-2\n                               ___   ____     ____                    ____\n                               292   4934     5226                    1231\n[A3000]</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 5226 black students in these schools constitute 65% of the 8018 black students in Ward 3<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and 52% of the blacks in the system. To relieve the overcapacity in the Cherry Street, Mill Street and Lincoln schools, places must be found elsewhere in the system for more than 1200 children, most of them black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Ward 3, the Board plan is not up to constitutional standards. In many circumstances the <i>Orange County</i> approach of neighborhood schools is adequate to convert a school system from a dual to a unitary system. But, as <i>Orange County</i> itself makes clear, 423 F.2d at 208, footnote 9, each case turns on all of its own facts, including those peculiar to the particular system. In Ward 3 of this system, a plan which leaves two out of three black children in Lake Charles in schools all black or substantially so, and more than 1200 of those in schools that have no places for them, cannot be upheld as constitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered the strong plea of the plaintiffs that we order the HEW plan put into effect forthwith. We will not lightly overturn the District Court's finding that the HEW plan is administratively, economically and educationally unsound. Andrews v. City of Monroe, 425 F.2d 1017 (5th Cir., 1970). We have considered also the possibility of pairing or clustering schools, an approach strongly opposed by the Board. In this instance that approach would involve many schools and a sweeping relocation of students. We choose instead the less drastic alternative of applying adjustments to the approved plan to substantially relieve the overcapacity schools and to bring the plan up to constitutional standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We direct that the following adjustments be made in the plan approved by the District Court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Lincoln (E-2) zone: the area from Prater Street west to the Calcasieu River will be assigned to Central (E-8).

But to say that compliance with the constitutional requirements is difficult is not to say that the difficulties cannot be solved. We are fully aware that the Board, with expertise and knowledge of local conditions, may be able to develop a different plan which effectively desegregates the Ward 3 schools, or to make adjustments in what we order, and thereby eliminate disadvantages that are present, and offer advantages that are absent, in what we direct. The Board is free to devise a different plan, or to seek changes and adjustments, and the District Court has discretion to approve such alternatives, provided that no such different plan or adjustment diminishes the extent of desegregation projected by this opinion, and, provided further, that the plan ordered by this court, unless modified by the District Court within the above limitations, must be put into effect when the schools open for the 1970-71 term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mandate shall issue immediately and no stay will be granted for filing petition for rehearing or petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cause is remanded to the District Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, remanded with directions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <pre>                           <i>APPENDIX A</i>\n                         <i>WARD 3 SCHOOLS</i>\n               <i>PROJECTED ENROLLMENT FOR 1970-71</i>\n             <i>UNDER PLAN APPROVED BY DISTRICT COURT</i>\n\n<i>Zone</i>                                                <i>%</i>\n<i>No.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a>      <i>School</i>        <i>Grades</i>      <i>Wh.</i>     <i>Bl.</i>    <i>Bl.</i>   <i>Total</i>   <i>Cap.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s\" id=\"fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\nE-16      Barbe           1-6       390     58     -0-    448     390\nH-3       Boston         9-12       161    517     76%    678     800\nE-20      Brentwood       1-6       391      0     -0-    391     540\nE-6 &amp;     Carver/      K, 4-8</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <pre>J-5  Fisherville          1-3        171     331    66%    502    600\nE-8  Central              K-6        222      82    27%    304    630\nE-4  Cherry Street        1-6          6     873    99%    879    540\nE-18 College Oaks         1-6        441       0    -0-    441    570\nE-14 Cooley               1-6        367      23     6%    390    450\nE-23 Dolby                1-6        531       0    -0-    531    540\nE-5  Eastwood             1-6        277     109    28%    386    630\nE-15 Fourth Ward          1-6        136       0    -0-    136    180\nE-21 Greinwich/Fairview   1-6        518     130    20%    648    930\nE-9  Hamilton             1-6        304       3     1%    307    540\nE-19 Henry Heights        1-6        404       0    -0-    404    540\nE-25 Kaufman              1-6        302      37    11%    339    390\nE-11 Kennedy              1-6        292     272    48%    564    300\nJ-8  LaGrange/Welsh Jr.   7-9       1379      65     5%   1444   1800\nH-5  LaGrange Sr.       10-12       2069      61     3%   2130   1800\nH-4  Lake Charles       10-12        771      80     9%    851   1200\n     High\nE-2 &amp;\nJ-1  Lincoln              1-8        223    1409    86%   1632    990\nJ-4 &amp;\nH-1  Marion              7-12        299     416    58%    715    600\nE-7  Mill Street          1-6          8     492    98%    500    750\nE-24 Nelson               1-6        207       0    -0-    207    420\nE-13 Oak Park Elem.       1-6        561       0    -0-    561    600\nJ-9  Oak Park.

When a transfer request is received by the school board during a school term, it may be denied at that time if there is no space available in the school to which the student wishes to transfer. In such a situation the transfer request will be deferred until the beginning of the next school term, at which time the transfer applicant will be given an absolute priority for space.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allen v.

However, because the opening of school is at hand, and various changes are made by this court in student assignment, majority to minority transfer requests shall be honored if received within 14 days after the schools open.

No complaint is made that as between schools these standards are not being carried out. However, the Negro plaintiffs assert that system-wide the board has systematically reduced the proportion of black teachers employed in the parish. Alternatively they assert that the number of black teachers has decreased as a result of closing black schools because of desegregation. The record does not establish these assertions. As to the latter it appears that all black teachers from closed black schools have been absorbed in the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As best we can tell, what plaintiffs really are claiming is that as places have become vacant from attrition not related to race and from diminished faculty requirements at some grade levels resulting from closing black schools, the Board's hiring practices in filling such vacancies have caused the number of black teachers in the system, and the proportion of black teachers in the system, to decrease while the number and proportion of white teachers have increased. If the complaint is of hiring practices, it must be presented first to the District Court. We do not have before us findings, a record, or even sufficiently clear statements of what is claimed for us to consider that issue. The bare statistics showing that for three years black teachers increased from 390 in the first year to 417 in the second, and decreased to 397 in the third, while whites increased from 1255 to 1379 to 1426, do not establish racially discriminatory hiring practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found the parties to be in agreement that, except for Wards 3 and 4, the school system is unitary with respect to student assignment. No objections are made to this finding. As to Ward 4, the record is slim, but plaintiffs interpose no objections to the finding that the system in that ward is unitary and we will not disturb it. Of the approximately 28 schools, of all levels, in the wards other than Ward 3, only one has a heavily black student body. The schools in these wards have projected 1970-71 enrollment of 16,516 students, 14,459 white (88%) and 2057 black (12%).<sup>4A</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The major issue is student assignment in Ward 3. Several plans have been before the District Court since the case was remanded by Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"287039\"><a href=\"/opinion/287039/st-helena-parish-school-board-v-james-williams-jr-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1969). Geographic zoning has been in effect since July, 1969. Following a hearing in April, 1970 the District Court concluded that the amended Board plan then presented did not convert the system to a unitary one and directed that zones in Ward 3 be redrawn so that each student would be assigned to attend the school nearest his home, limited only by the capacity of the school, as in Ellis v. Board of Public Instruction of Orange County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"288995\"><a href=\"/opinion/288995/evelyn-r-ellis-a-minor-v-the-board-of-public-instruction-of-orange/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1970). The Board presented what appeared to be such a plan. The plaintiffs concede that it contained \"no trickery, no devices, no gerrymandering.\" Also, the HEW plan prepared in the summer of 1969 was before the court. The latter provides for pairing or clustering of schools, some close together, others many miles apart, and massive crosstown bussing. The District Court rejected it with the finding that \"[v]iewed from any direction, it would be a disaster.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the elementary grades and some junior high grades and one high school, the neighborhood plan which the Board submitted and the District Court approved was not adjusted for the maximum capacities of schools. The approved plan stated that \"adjustments [in student assignment] will have to be made for capacities.\" When capacities are matched against the assignments made by the neighborhood zones it is immediately apparent that a number of changes and adjustments must be made. The Board states that it planned to present to the District Court the matter of adjustments necessitated by overcapacity but before it could do so this appeal was filed. Under the requirements of Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></span> (1959), we cannot await further proceedings at the District Court level to establish a constitutionally acceptable plan. A plan must be put into effect now under which the system will begin to operate immediately as a unitary system. The beginning of school is at hand. At the appellate level our alternatives are that we order the HEW plan put into effect immediately or that we make such changes and adjustments in the plan approved by the District Court as will bring it up to constitutional standards. For reasons set out below we have chosen the latter alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appendix A contains data for all Ward 3 schools based on projected 1970-71 enrollment. Considering approximately 90% or more black students as creating a black school, of approximately 36 schools in Ward 3 the plan approved by the District Court left in existence for the 1970-71 school year three black elementary schools (Cherry Street, Mill Street, and Opelousas/Jackson), a black junior-senior high school (Washington), and Lincoln (grades 1-8), which is so close to being black and so startlingly overcrowded as to require consideration along with the others:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <pre><i>Zone</i>                                                    <i>%</i>             <i>Over</i>\n<i>No.</i>  <i>School</i>          <i>Grades</i>     <i>Wh.</i>   <i>Bl.</i>     <i>Total</i>     <i>Bl.</i>    <i>Cap.</i>    <i>Cap.</i>\nE-4  Cherry St.        1-6       6    873      879     99.3%    630    249\nE-7  Mill St.          1-6       8    492      500     98.4%    840    340\nE-3  Opelousas/Jackson 1-6      17    706      723     97.6%   1260\nE-2  Lincoln           1-8     223   1409     1632     86.3%    990    642\nand\nJ-1\nJ-3 Washington        7-12      38   1454     1492     97.5%   1590\nand\nH-2\n                               ___   ____     ____                    ____\n                               292   4934     5226                    1231\n[A3000]</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 5226 black students in these schools constitute 65% of the 8018 black students in Ward 3<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and 52% of the blacks in the system.

In many circumstances the <i>Orange County</i> approach of neighborhood schools is adequate to convert a school system from a dual to a unitary system. But, as <i>Orange County</i> itself makes clear, 423 F.2d at 208, footnote 9, each case turns on all of its own facts, including those peculiar to the particular system. In Ward 3 of this system, a plan which leaves two out of three black children in Lake Charles in schools all black or substantially so, and more than 1200 of those in schools that have no places for them, cannot be upheld as constitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered the strong plea of the plaintiffs that we order the HEW plan put into effect forthwith.

We have considered also the possibility of pairing or clustering schools, an approach strongly opposed by the Board. In this instance that approach would involve many schools and a sweeping relocation of students.

The Board is free to devise a different plan, or to seek changes and adjustments, and the District Court has discretion to approve such alternatives, provided that no such different plan or adjustment diminishes the extent of desegregation projected by this opinion, and, provided further, that the plan ordered by this court, unless modified by the District Court within the above limitations, must be put into effect when the schools open for the 1970-71 term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mandate shall issue immediately and no stay will be granted for filing petition for rehearing or petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cause is remanded to the District Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, remanded with directions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <pre>                           <i>APPENDIX A</i>\n                         <i>WARD 3 SCHOOLS</i>\n               <i>PROJECTED ENROLLMENT FOR 1970-71</i>\n             <i>UNDER PLAN APPROVED BY DISTRICT COURT</i>\n\n<i>Zone</i>                                                <i>%</i>\n<i>No.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a>      <i>School</i>        <i>Grades</i>      <i>Wh.</i>     <i>Bl.</i>    <i>Bl.</i>   <i>Total</i>   <i>Cap.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s\" id=\"fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\nE-16      Barbe           1-6       390     58     -0-    448     390\nH-3       Boston         9-12       161    517     76%    678     800\nE-20      Brentwood       1-6       391      0     -0-    391     540\nE-6 &amp;     Carver/      K, 4-8</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <pre>J-5  Fisherville          1-3        171     331    66%    502    600\nE-8  Central              K-6        222      82    27%    304    630\nE-4  Cherry Street        1-6          6     873    99%    879    540\nE-18 College Oaks         1-6        441       0    -0-    441    570\nE-14 Cooley               1-6        367      23     6%    390    450\nE-23 Dolby                1-6        531       0    -0-    531    540\nE-5  Eastwood             1-6        277     109    28%    386    630\nE-15 Fourth Ward          1-6        136       0    -0-    136    180\nE-21 Greinwich/Fairview   1-6        518     130    20%    648    930\nE-9  Hamilton             1-6        304       3     1%    307    540\nE-19 Henry Heights        1-6        404       0    -0-    404    540\nE-25 Kaufman              1-6        302      37    11%    339    390\nE-11 Kennedy              1-6        292     272    48%    564    300\nJ-8  LaGrange/Welsh Jr.   7-9       1379      65     5%   1444   1800\nH-5  LaGrange Sr.       10-12       2069      61     3%   2130   1800\nH-4  Lake Charles       10-12        771      80     9%    851   1200\n     High\nE-2 &amp;\nJ-1  Lincoln              1-8        223    1409    86%   1632    990\nJ-4 &amp;\nH-1  Marion              7-12        299     416    58%    715    600\nE-7  Mill Street          1-6          8     492    98%    500    750\nE-24 Nelson               1-6        207       0    -0-    207    420\nE-13 Oak Park Elem.       1-6        561       0    -0-    561    600\nJ-9  Oak Park.
