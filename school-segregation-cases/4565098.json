The question in this case is\nwhether a disparate-impact claim is cognizable where a\n“subgroup” of employees at the upper end of that\nrange—in this case, employees aged fifty and older—\nwere alleged to have been disfavored relative to younger\nemployees.\n\n       We answer in the affirmative. Our decision is\ndictated by the plain text of the statute as interpreted by\nthe Supreme Court. In particular, the ADEA prohibits\ndisparate impacts based on age, not forty-and-older\nidentity. A rule that disallowed subgroups would ignore\ngenuine statistical disparities that could otherwise be\nactionable through application of the plain text of the\nstatute. Although several of our sister circuits have ruled\nto the contrary, their reasoning relies primarily on policy\narguments that we do not find persuasive.\n\n       We will therefore reverse the judgment of the\nDistrict Court based on its interpretation of the ADEA.\nWe will also vacate the District Court’s order excluding\nthe testimony of plaintiffs’ statistics expert and remand\nfor further Daubert proceedings. We will affirm in all\nother respects.\n\n\n                            4\n\f                            I\n\n      Defendant Pittsburgh Glass Works, LLC (“PGW”)\nmanufactures automotive glass in Harmarville,\nPennsylvania. PGW also owns (1) GTS Services, a\nsoftware business, (2) PGW Auto Glass, an automotive\nreplacement-glass distribution business, (3) LYNX\nServices, an insurance claims administrator, and\n(4) Aquapel, a glass treatment supplier.\n\n       In 2008, the automobile industry began to falter.\nPGW engaged in several reductions in force (“RIFs”) to\noffset deteriorating sales. The RIF of relevance to this\ncase occurred on March 31, 2009, and terminated the\nemployment of approximately one hundred salaried\nemployees in over forty locations or divisions. Individual\nunit directors had broad discretion in selecting whom to\nterminate. PGW did not train those directors in how to\nimplement the RIF. Nor did PGW employ any written\nguidelines or policies, conduct any disparate-impact\nanalysis, review prospective RIF terminees with counsel,\nor document why any particular employee was selected\nfor inclusion in the RIF.\n\n     Plaintiffs Rudolph A. Karlo, William S.\nCunningham, Jeffrey Marietti, David Meixelberger,\nMark K. McLure, Benjamin D. Thompson, and Richard\n\n\n\n                            5\n\fCsukas1 worked in PGW’s Manufacturing Technology\ndivision. They were terminated as part of the March 2009\nRIF by their supervisor, Gary Cannon. Each was over\nfifty years old at the time.\n\n       In January 2010, plaintiffs filed charges of\nemployment discrimination with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”). Thereafter, they\nreceived a Dismissal and Notice of Rights from the\nEEOC, and this lawsuit followed. Plaintiffs brought a\nputative ADEA collective action, asserting three claims:\n(1) disparate treatment, (2) disparate impact, and\n(3) retaliation as to only Karlo and McLure.\n\n       On plaintiffs’ motion for conditional certification,\nthe District Court ruled that ADEA subgroups are\ncognizable, and conditionally certified a collective action\nto be comprised of employees terminated by the RIF who\nwere at least fifty years old at the time. See Karlo v.\nPittsburgh Glass Works, LLC, 880 F. Supp. 2d 629\n(W.D. Pa. 2012). In addition to the named plaintiffs,\neleven individuals opted in. Three voluntarily dismissed\ntheir claims and four settled. Four opt-ins remained:\nMichael Breen, a former production supervisor at a plant\nin Crestline, Ohio; Matthew Clawson, a former Project\nEngineer in Evansville, Indiana; Stephen Shaw, a former\n\n      1\n        McLure, Thompson, and Csukas settled their\nclaims prior to this appeal.\n                            6\n\fmarketing manager in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and John\nTitus, a former Area Services Manager in Irving, Texas.\n\n       On June 26, 2013, the case was transferred to\nanother district judge. PGW filed a motion to decertify\nthe collective action. On March 31, 2014, the District\nCourt granted the motion, concluding that the collective\naction should be decertified because the opt-in plaintiffs’\nclaims are factually dissimilar from those of the named\nplaintiffs. See Karlo, 2014 WL 1317595.\n\n      PGW then filed motions to exclude plaintiffs’\nexperts. Of relevance to this appeal, PGW sought to\nexclude three areas of expert testimony. First, Dr.\nMichael Campion was prepared to offer statistical\nevidence in favor of plaintiffs’ disparate-impact claim.\nSecond, Dr. Campion intended to offer his expert opinion\non “reasonable” human-resources practices during a RIF.\nAnd third, Dr. Anthony G. Greenwald proposed to testify\nas to age-related implicit-bias studies. By Order dated\nJuly 13, 2015, the District Court excluded the testimony\nof each. See Karlo, 2015 WL 4232600.\n\n      PGW moved for summary judgment on each\nclaim. On September 3, 2015, the District Court ruled on\nthe motions, granting them in part and denying them in\npart. See Karlo, 2015 WL 5156913. As to plaintiffs’\ndisparate-impact claims, the District Court granted\nsummary judgment on two grounds: (1) plaintiffs’ fifty-\nand-older disparate-impact claim is not cognizable under\n                            7\n\fthe ADEA; and (2) plaintiffs’ lack of evidence to support\ntheir claim of disparate impact following the exclusion of\nDr. Campion’s statistics-related testimony. The District\nCourt also granted summary judgment as to plaintiffs’\ndisparate-treatment claims. That ruling has not been\nappealed. Finally, the District Court denied summary\njudgment as to Karlo’s and McLure’s individual\nretaliation claims.\n\n       On October 2, 2015, the District Court certified the\ndisparate-impact and disparate-treatment claims for final\njudgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. See Karlo, 2015 WL 5782062. This\nappeal followed. Plaintiffs seek reversal of the District\nCourt’s summary judgment decision and statistics-related\nDaubert ruling regarding their disparate-impact claims.\nPlaintiffs also appeal the District Court’s other Daubert\nrulings and its order decertifying the collective action.\n\n                            II\n\n      The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1331. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1291.\n\n      The parties dispute whether our jurisdiction\nextends to one or all named plaintiffs. PGW concedes\nthat Karlo perfected an appeal, but argues that the other\nremaining named plaintiffs—Cunningham, Marietti, and\nMeixelberger—were not identified in the Notice of\n                            8\n\fAppeal, and therefore did not preserve their appellate\nrights under Rule 3(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure. See Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487\nU.S. 312, 317 (1988).2 We conclude that plaintiffs\ncomplied with Rule 3(c) with respect to all named\nplaintiffs.\n\n        Rule 3(c)(1)(A) requires a notice of appeal to\n“specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming\neach one in the caption or body of the notice,” but that\nrule is relaxed where “an attorney [is] representing more\nthan one party.” Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(A). The attorney\n“may describe those parties with such terms as ‘all\nplaintiffs,’ ‘the defendants,’ ‘the plaintiffs A, B, et al.,’ or\n‘all defendants except X.’” Id.\n\n       The Notice of Appeal here states, “Plaintiffs in the\nabove-captioned case hereby appeal . . . an order . . .\nentering judgment against Plaintiffs . . . on Plaintiffs’\ndiscrimination claims . . . .” A.1 (emphases added). The\n\n       2\n         Although it does not influence our analysis, the\nNotice of Appeal’s caption has a perfectly innocent\nexplanation. Following Rule 54(b) certification, the\nDistrict Court amended the caption by order to identify\nonly Karlo and McLure as plaintiffs because their\nretaliation claims were the only claims remaining after\nsummary judgment. The Notice of Appeal used the\nDistrict Court’s updated caption.\n                               9\n\fuse of “Plaintiffs” is equivalent to “the defendants” in the\nexample provided by the Rule.3 We have observed that\n“[t]he purpose of Rule 3(c)’s identification requirement is\nto provide notice to the court and the opposing parties of\nthe identity of the appellants.” In re Cont’l Airlines, 125\nF.3d 120, 129 (3d Cir. 1997). Because all of the\nremaining named plaintiffs were identically situated as to\nthis appeal, were represented by the same counsel, and\nwere each identified by name in the District Court’s\n“order . . . entering judgment against [all named]\nPlaintiffs,” as referenced on the face of the Notice, Rule\n3(c)’s purpose is amply served, and “the intent to appeal\nis otherwise clear from the notice.” Fed. R. App. P.\n3(c)(4); see United States v. Carelock, 459 F.3d 437, 441\n(3d Cir. 2006) (“The Supreme Court has stated that\ncourts should ‘liberally construe the requirements of Rule\n3.’” (quoting Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 248 (1992))).\n\n                            III\n\n       The central question in this case is whether so-\ncalled “subgroup” disparate-impact claims are cognizable\nunder the ADEA. We hold that they are.\n\n\n      3\n         The phrase “in the above captioned case” does\nnot change our interpretation. We read the Notice to\nmean “Plaintiffs in [Civil Action No. 10-1283] hereby\nappeal.”\n                            10\n\f      Disparate-impact claims in ADEA cases ordinarily\nevaluate the effect of a facially neutral policy on all\nemployees who are at least forty years old—that is, all\nemployees covered by the ADEA. In this case, plaintiffs\nclaim to have identified a policy that disproportionately\nimpacted a subgroup of that population: employees older\nthan fifty. But because the policy favored younger\nmembers of the protected class, adding those individuals\nto the comparison group washes out the statistical\nevidence of a disparity.\n\n        Plaintiffs’ claim is cognizable under the ADEA.\nSpecifically, we hold that an ADEA disparate-impact\nclaim may proceed when a plaintiff offers evidence that a\nspecific, facially neutral employment practice caused a\nsignificantly disproportionate adverse impact based on\nage. Plaintiffs can demonstrate such impact with various\nforms      of     evidence,    including   forty-and-older\ncomparisons, subgroup comparisons, or more\nsophisticated statistical modeling, so long as that\nevidence meets the usual standards for admissibility. A\ncontrary rule would ignore significant age-based\ndisparities. Where such disparities exist, they must be\njustified pursuant to the ADEA’s relatively broad\ndefenses.\n\n                            A\n\n     We begin with an overview of the statutory\nscheme. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n                           11\n\f1967, 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.,\nmakes it unlawful for an employer:\n\n      (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n      individual or otherwise discriminate against\n      any individual with respect to his\n      compensation,        terms,     conditions,    or\n      privileges of employment, because of such\n      individual’s age;\n\n      (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\n      employees in any way which would deprive\n      or tend to deprive any individual of\n      employment opportunities or otherwise\n      adversely affect his status as an employee,\n      because of such individual’s age; or\n\n      (3) to reduce the wage rate of any employee\n      in order to comply with this chapter.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a). “Except for substitution of the word\n‘age,’ for the words ‘race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin,’ the language of that provision in the ADEA is\nidentical to that found in § 703(a)(2) of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 (Title VII).” Smith v. City of Jackson, 544\nU.S. 228, 233 (2005). But unlike Title VII, which\nprotects individuals of every race, color, religion, sex,\nand national origin, the ADEA’s protection is “limited to\nindividuals who are at least 40 years of age.” 29 U.S.C.\n§ 631(a).\n                             12\n\f       ADEA claims may proceed under a disparate-\nimpact or disparate-treatment theory. See Smith, 544 U.S.\nat 231–32. Disparate treatment is governed by\n§ 623(a)(1); disparate impact is governed by § 623(a)(2).\nId. at 235 (plurality opinion); cf. Watson v. Fort Worth\nBank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 991 (1988); Connecticut v.\nTeal, 457 U.S. 440, 446–47 (1982).\n\n       The disparate-impact theory of recovery was first\nrecognized in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424\n(1971), a Title VII case. Unlike claims of disparate\ntreatment, disparate-impact claims do not require proof\nof discriminatory intent. Disparate impact redresses\npolicies that are “fair in form, but discriminatory in\noperation.” Id. at 431. To that end, disparate-impact\nclaims “usually focus[] on statistical disparities . . . .”\nWatson, 487 U.S. at 987.\n\n       To state a prima facie case for disparate impact\nunder the ADEA, a plaintiff must (1) identify a specific,\nfacially neutral policy, and (2) proffer statistical evidence\nthat the policy caused a significant age-based disparity.\nCf. NAACP v. N. Hudson Reg’l Fire & Rescue, 665 F.3d\n464, 476–77 (3d Cir. 2011). Once a plaintiff establishes a\nprima facie case, an employer can defend by arguing that\nthe challenged practice was based on “reasonable factors\nother than age”—commonly referred to as the “RFOA”\ndefense. 29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7.\n\n\n                             13\n\f       “[T]he scope of disparate-impact liability under the\nADEA is narrower than under Title VII” because of\n“[t]wo textual differences” between the statutes. Smith,\n544 U.S. at 240. First, the RFOA defense imposes a\nlighter burden on the employer than its Title VII\ncounterpart, the “business necessity” defense. Under the\nADEA, the employer only needs to show that it relied on\na “reasonable” factor, not that “there are [no] other ways\nfor the employer to achieve its goals . . . .” Smith, 544\nU.S. at 243. Congress’s decision to impose a relatively\nlight burden on employers “is consistent with the fact that\nage, unlike race or other classifications protected by Title\nVII, not uncommonly has relevance to an individual’s\ncapacity to engage in certain types of employment.” Id. at\n240. The second textual difference requires ADEA\nplaintiffs to “isolat[e] and identify[] the specific\nemployment practices that are allegedly responsible for\nany observed statistical disparities.” Id. at 241 (quoting\nWards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 656\n(1989)). Congress stripped that requirement from Title\nVII when it amended the statute in 1991, but it remains\noperative under the ADEA. Id. at 240; see 42 U.S.C. §\n2000e–2(k).\n\n                             B\n\n     The ADEA’s disparate-impact provision makes it\nunlawful for an employer “to adversely affect [an\nemployee’s] status . . . because of such individual’s age.”\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2). This plain text supports the\n                            14\n\fviability of subgroup claims. See Hardt v. Reliance\nStandard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 251 (2010) (“We\nmust enforce plain and unambiguous statutory language\naccording to its terms.”). Two aspects of the text guide\nour decision in this case: (1) the focus on age as the\nrelevant protected trait, as interpreted by O’Connor v.\nConsolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308 (1996),\nand (2) the focus on the rights of individuals, as\ninterpreted by Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440 (1982).\nOur interpretation is further supported by the ADEA’s\nremedial purpose.\n\n                           1\n\n       We begin with the Supreme Court’s unanimous\nopinion in O’Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers\nCorp., 517 U.S. 308 (1996), an ADEA disparate-\ntreatment case. O’Connor clarified that the ADEA\nproscribes age discrimination, not forty-and-over\ndiscrimination. The same interpretation applies to\nidentical operative language in the ADEA’s disparate-\nimpact provision.\n\n      The plaintiff in O’Connor was fifty-six years old\nwhen he was fired and replaced with a younger worker.\n517 U.S. at 309. The plaintiff’s replacement, however,\nwas over the age of forty, and therefore within the class\nof individuals protected by the ADEA. Id. The Fourth\nCircuit held that the ADEA prima facie case requires the\n\n                           15\n\freplacement to be younger than forty years old. Id. at\n310. The Supreme Court reversed.\n\n       The Supreme Court began its analysis with the\nplain text of the statute: “The discrimination prohibited\nby the ADEA is discrimination ‘because of [an]\nindividual’s age,’ though the prohibition is ‘limited to\nindividuals who are at least 40 years of age.’” 517 U.S. at\n312 (alteration in original) (citations omitted). On the\nbasis of that text, the Court held that the ADEA\n\n       does not ban discrimination against\n      employees because they are aged 40 or\n      older; it bans discrimination against\n      employees because of their age, but limits\n      the protected class to those who are 40 or\n      older. The fact that one person in the\n      protected class has lost out to another person\n      in the protected class is thus irrelevant, so\n      long as he has lost out because of his age.\n\nId. Although the ADEA protects a class of individuals at\nleast forty years old, it “prohibits discrimination on the\nbasis of age and not class membership . . . .” Id. at 313. It\nis therefore “utterly irrelevant” that the beneficiary of age\ndiscrimination was also over the age of forty. Id. at 312.\nAccordingly, the proposed limitation on the prima facie\ncase—replacement by an employee younger than forty—\nlacked a “logical connection” to the plain text of the\nADEA. Id. at 311–12. As the Supreme Court later\n                             16\n\freaffirmed, “[it] is beyond reasonable doubt[] that the\nADEA was concerned to protect a relatively old worker\nfrom discrimination that works to the advantage of the\nrelatively young.” Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v.\nCline, 540 U.S. 581, 590–91 (2004).\n\n       The Supreme Court’s reasoning ineluctably leads\nto our conclusion that subgroup claims are cognizable.\nSimply put, evidence that a policy disfavors employees\nolder than fifty is probative of the relevant statutory\nquestion: whether the policy creates a disparate impact\n“because of such individual[s’] age.” 29 U.S.C.\n§ 623(a)(2). Requiring the comparison group to include\nemployees in their forties has no “logical connection” to\nthat prohibition. O’Connor, 517 U.S. at 311.\n\n      The key insight from O’Connor is that the forty-\nand-older line drawn by § 631(a) constrains the ADEA’s\ngeneral scope; it does not modify or define the ADEA’s\nsubstantive prohibition against “discriminat[ion] . . .\nbecause of such individual’s age.” § 623(a)(1). The\nADEA protects against “age discrimination []as opposed\nto ‘40 or over’ discrimination . . . .” O’Connor, 517 U.S.\nat 312.\n\n      The disparate-impact provision uses the same\noperative phrase, “because of such individual’s age.” 29\nU.S.C. § 623(a)(2). Our interpretation of it, therefore,\nshould be consistent with our interpretation of the\ndisparate-treatment provision, § 623(a)(1). See, e.g.,\n                           17\n\fDep’t of Revenue of Or. v. ACF Indus., Inc., 510 U.S.\n332, 342 (1994) (“[I]dentical words used in different\nparts of the same act are intended to have the same\nmeaning.”). Thus, “adversely affect . . . because of such\nindividual’s age” must mean adversely affect based on\nage, not adversely affect based on forty-and-older status.4\n\n       O’Connor’s applicability is not diminished by the\nfact that it addressed a disparate-treatment claim. As\ndemonstrated by the identical operative phrasing of\n§ 623(a)(1) and § 623(a)(2), the two types of claims share\nthe same “ultimate legal issue . . . .” Watson, 487 U.S. at\n987; see also Teal, 457 U.S. at 455–56 (discussed infra\nSection III.B.2). Disparate-impact claims are primarily\ndistinguished by “the factual issues that typically\ndominate”—namely, whether a facially neutral policy is\n\n      4\n         In Cline, the Supreme Court interpreted the word\n“age” to take different meanings in different parts of the\nADEA. 540 U.S. at 596. The Court distinguished\nbetween two alternative definitions: “any number of\nyears lived, or . . . the longer span and concurrent aches\nthat make youth look good.” Id. The Court determined\nthat “[t]he presumption of uniform usage thus relents”\nwhen comparing § 623(a)(1) and § 623(f). Id. at 595. In\nthis case, the presumption holds because § 623(a)(1) and\n§ 623(a)(2) employ “age” in virtually the same context.\nBoth use “age” as in Cline’s second definition, to mean\n“old age.” 540 U.S. at 596.\n                            18\n\fdiscriminatory in operation. Watson, 487 U.S. at 987\n(emphasis added); see Tex. Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v.\nBurdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252 n.5 (1981). A disparate\nimpact “may in operation be functionally equivalent to\nintentional discrimination.” Watson, 487 U.S. at 987; see\nTex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys.\nProject, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2522 (2015) (“[D]isparate-\nimpact liability . . . plays a role in uncovering\ndiscriminatory intent[.]”). Our holding restores the parity\ndescribed in Watson. Under the ADEA, both disparate\nimpact and disparate treatment address the same ultimate\nlegal issue: age discrimination.\n\n       We conclude that the Supreme Court’s analysis in\nO’Connor answers the question now before us. A\nspecific, facially neutral policy that significantly\ndisfavors employees over fifty years old supports a claim\nof disparate impact under the plain text of § 623(a)(2).\nAlthough the employer’s policy might favor younger\nmembers of the forty-and-over cohort, that is an “utterly\nirrelevant factor,” O’Connor, 517 U.S. at 312, in\nevaluating whether a company’s oldest employees were\ndisproportionately affected because of their age.\n\n                            2\n\n       Our decision is further supported by the Supreme\nCourt’s opinion in Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440\n(1982), a Title VII disparate-impact case. Teal confirms\nthat, even under a disparate-impact theory, the plain text\n                            19\n\fof the statute is designed to protect the rights of\nindividual employees, not the rights of a class.\n\n        In Teal, a Connecticut state agency used a two-step\nprocess to determine eligibility for promotions. First,\nConnecticut required applicants to take a written test.\nSecond, Connecticut selected the employees for\npromotion out of the pool of candidates that passed the\ntest. Id. at 443. Black applicants who failed the test sued,\nadvancing evidence that black employees failed the\nwritten test at a significantly higher rate than white\nemployees. In response, Connecticut argued that, at the\nsecond step of the process, the black employees who\npassed were given preferential treatment through an\naffirmative action program, counterbalancing the\ndiscriminatory effect of the written test. Connecticut\nargued that its two-step process promoted black\nemployees at an overall higher rate than white\nemployees. Id. at 444.\n\n       The Supreme Court rejected this so-called\n“bottom-line” defense and held that the purpose of Title\nVII “is the protection of the individual employee, rather\nthan the protection of the minority group as a whole.” Id.\nat 453–54. “[F]avorable treatment of . . . members of\nthese respondents’ racial group” did not justify\ndiscrimination against other members of the protected\nclass. Id. at 454; see El v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., 479 F.3d\n232, 239–40 (3d Cir. 2007) (“Title VII operates not\nprimarily to the benefit of racial or minority groups, but\n                            20\n\fto ensure that individual applicants receive the\nconsideration they are due . . . .”).\n\n       This case presents a similar issue. The ADEA, like\nTitle VII, protects individuals who are members of a\nprotected class, not a class itself. See 29 U.S.C.\n§ 623(a)(1) (proscribing forms of discrimination\n“because of such individual’s age”); id. § 623(a)(2)\n(same); id. § 631(a) (limiting the ADEA’s scope to\n“individuals who are at least 40 years of age”). Such\nprotection under the statute does not disappear when a\nplaintiff advances a disparate-impact claim. Teal\nprohibits the use of a bottom-line statistic to justify\nignoring a disproportionate impact against individuals\nthat would otherwise be actionable under the plain text of\nthe statute. That is precisely the problem subgroups are\nmeant to address here.\n\n     As a result, Teal answers PGW’s argument that\nemployees older than forty were, as a class, favored to\nkeep their jobs. That is equivalent to Connecticut’s\nargument that black employees were collectively favored\nfor promotions. The Supreme Court rejected that\nargument in Teal, and we reject it here.\n\n       Similar to the position of PGW and its amici in this\ncase, the dissenting Justices in Teal accused the majority\nof “confus[ing] the distinction—uniformly recognized\nuntil today—between disparate impact and disparate\n\n                            21\n\ftreatment.” 457 U.S. at 462 (Powell, J., dissenting). The\nmajority responded as follows:\n\n      The fact remains . . . that irrespective of the\n      form taken by the discriminatory practice, an\n      employer’s treatment of other members of\n      the plaintiffs’ group can be of little comfort\n      to the victims of . . . discrimination. Title VII\n      does not permit the victim of a facially\n      discriminatory policy to be told that he has\n      not been wronged because other persons of\n      his or her race or sex were hired. That answer\n      is no more satisfactory when it is given to\n      victims of a policy that is facially neutral but\n      practically discriminatory. Every individual\n      employee is protected against both\n      discriminatory treatment and practices that\n      are fair in form, but discriminatory in\n      operation.\n\nId. at 455–56 (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). The same reasoning applies to this case. The\nADEA “does not permit the victim of a facially\ndiscriminatory policy to be told that he has not been\nwronged because other persons” aged forty or older were\npreferred. Id. at 455. “That answer is no more\nsatisfactory when it is given to victims of a policy that is\nfacially neutral but practically discriminatory.” Id.\n\n\n                             22\n\f                            3\n\n       PGW and its amici maintain that disparate-impact\nclaims generally rely on comparisons between entire\nclasses. Even in Teal, for example, plaintiffs’ evidence\nshowed that the written test caused a disparate impact on\nblack employees as a class. 457 U.S. at 443. That general\nfocus on groups, however, is explained by the fact that\nTitle VII protects group identities like race and sex. The\ntrait protected by the ADEA, age, is qualitatively\ndifferent.\n\n       “The term ‘age’ employed by the ADEA is not . . .\ncomparable to the terms ‘race’ or ‘sex’ employed by Title\nVII.” Cline, 540 U.S. at 597. Age is a continuous\nvariable, whereas race and sex are treated categorically in\nthe mine-run of Title VII cases. See Bienkowski v. Am.\nAirlines, Inc., 851 F.2d 1503, 1506 (5th Cir. 1988) (“The\nADEA does not lend itself to a bright-line age rule and in\nthis respect differs from racial or sex discrimination\ncases . . . .”); Goldstein v. Manhattan Indus., Inc., 758\nF.2d 1435, 1442 (11th Cir. 1985) (observing that age\ndiscrimination is “qualitatively different from race or sex\ndiscrimination” because “the basis of the discrimination\nis not a discre[te] and immutable characteristic of an\nemployee which separates the members of the protected\ngroup indelibly from persons outside the protected\ngroup”).\n\n\n                            23\n\f         On account of that difference, the statistical\ntechniques common in Title VII cases are not perfectly\ntransferable to ADEA cases. If, for example, the\ncomparison group in Teal omitted some black employees\nwho took the written test, the statistics would likely have\nfailed to address whether there was a disparate impact\n“because of . . . race . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(a)(2);\nsee also id. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). It would be unclear\nwhether the test’s effects fell more harshly on individuals\nof a particular race without looking at how the test\naffected all members. But with the ADEA, by contrast, a\ncomparison group that omits employees in their forties is\nfully capable of demonstrating disparate impact “because\nof . . . age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2).\n\n        The forty-and-older line established in § 631(a)\ndoes not convert age into a binary trait. By its own terms,\nit imposes a “limit[ation]” on the “individuals” covered\nby “[t]he prohibitions in this chapter . . . .” 29 U.S.C.\n§ 631(a). It simply establishes “the age at which ADEA\nprotection begins.” Maxfield v. Sinclair Int’l, 766 F.2d\n788, 792 (3d Cir. 1985). The appropriate disparate-\nimpact statistics should be guided by the trait protected\nby the statute, not the population of employees inside or\noutside the statute’s general scope. In fact, when the\nSupreme Court recognized ADEA disparate-impact\nliability in Smith, nothing in its reasoning turned on the\n\n\n\n                            24\n\fexistence or purpose of § 631(a). That provision was not\ncited once.5\n\n       PGW and its amici would have us rewrite 29\nU.S.C. § 623(a)(2) to proscribe “adverse[] effect[s] . . .\nbecause of such individual’s [membership in the 40-and-\nolder class].” That interpretation would bring the ADEA\ncloser to more familiar Title VII territory, but “[w]e have\nto read it the way Congress wrote it.” Meacham v. Knolls\nAtomic Power Lab., 554 U.S. 84, 101–02 (2008). The\ncontinuous, non-categorical nature of age cannot be\nadequately addressed by simply aggregating forty-and-\nolder employees. More exacting analysis may be needed\nin certain cases, and subgroups may answer that need.\n\n                            4\n\n       Finally, our decision is supported by the ADEA’s\nremedial purpose. Refusing to recognize subgroup claims\nwould deny redress for significantly discriminatory\npolicies that affect employees most in need of the\nADEA’s protection.\n\n\n\n      5\n        To be sure, the plaintiffs in Smith happened to\nrely on forty-and-older statistics. 544 U.S. at 242.\nNothing in our opinion should be read to rule out such\nevidence. Nonetheless, Smith’s reasoning does not\nforeclose subgroup claims.\n                            25\n\f       Mandating a forty-and-older comparison group\n“would allow an employer to adopt facially neutral\npolicies which had a profoundly disparate impact on\nindividuals over age 50 or 55,” so long as younger\nindividuals within the protected class received\nsufficiently favorable treatment. Finch v. Hercules Inc.,\n865 F. Supp. 1104, 1129 (D. Del. 1994). Such policies\n“reflect the specific type of arbitrary age discrimination\nCongress sought to prohibit,” but would nonetheless\nevade judicial scrutiny. Id.; see also Graffam v. Scott\nPaper Co., 848 F. Supp. 1, 4 (D. Me. 1994).\n\n        We have also acknowledged in the disparate-\ntreatment context that “[i]f no intra-age group protection\nwere provided by the ADEA, it would be of virtually no\nuse to persons at the upper ages of the protected\nclass . . . .” Maxfield, 766 F.2d at 792. The same rationale\napplies to the disparate-impact context. The older the\nemployees affected by a policy, the more confounding\nfavoritism would be included in the rigid forty-and-older\nsample. Thus, an impact on employees in their seventies\nmay be easier to average out of existence compared to an\nimpact that also affects younger employees. Mandating\nforty-and-older comparisons would predominantly harm\n“those most in need of the statute’s protection.” Lowe v.\nCommack Union Free Sch. Dist., 886 F.2d 1364, 1379\n(2d Cir. 1989) (Pierce, J., dissenting in relevant part).\n“[I]t would indeed be strange, and even perverse, if the\nyoungest members of the protected class were to be\n\n                            26\n\faccorded a greater degree of statutory protection than\nolder members of the class.” Id.6\n\n      Accordingly, our interpretation of the ADEA is\nsupported not only by the statute’s text and Supreme\nCourt precedent, but also by the ADEA’s purpose.\n\n                            C\n\n      Our holding in this case is at odds with decisions\nfrom three of our sister circuits. See Lowe v. Commack\nUnion Free Sch. Dist., 886 F.2d 1364 (2d Cir. 1989);\nSmith v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 924 F.2d 1059, 1991 WL\n11271 (6th Cir. 1991) (table opinion); E.E.O.C. v.\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., 191 F.3d 948 (8th Cir.\n\n\n\n      6\n        Ironically, mandating a forty-and-older sample\nhas the potential to harm employers in certain\ncircumstances. For example, if a substantial disparate\nimpact is experienced only by individuals sixty-five and\nolder, the effect can show up in the forty-and-older\naggregate statistic, creating the misimpression that forty-\nyear-old plaintiffs were disparately impacted. See\nRamona L. Paetzold & Steve L. Willborn, The Statistics\nof Discrimination: Using Statistical Evidence in\nDiscrimination Cases § 7:2, at 340 (2016–2017 ed. 2016)\n(noting that “[t]he errors can occur in either direction”\nwhen relying on forty-and-older comparisons).\n                            27\n\f1999).7 Those decisions have primarily relied on policy\nconsiderations that we do not find persuasive. In short,\nthey are contradicted by O’Connor and Teal, confuse\nevidentiary concerns with statutory interpretation, and\nincorrectly assume that recognizing subgroups will\nproliferate liability for reasonable employment practices.\n\n\n\n      7\n        While we are generally reluctant to create circuit\nsplits, we do so where a “compelling basis” exists.\nWagner v. PennWest Farm Credit, ACA, 109 F.3d 909,\n912 (3d Cir. 1997). For the reasons discussed in this\nopinion, we think a compelling basis exists in this case.\nEven so, we note that (1) the Second Circuit and Sixth\nCircuit cases predate the Supreme Court’s decisions in\nO’Connor and Smith; (2) the Sixth Circuit case is non-\nprecedential; and (3) the Eighth Circuit case predates\nSmith. One circuit has noted the issue but declined to\nrule. See Katz v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., 229 F.3d\n831, 835–36 (9th Cir. 2000).\n       PGW and its amici argue that we already decided\nthis question in Massarsky v. General Motors Corp., 706\nF.2d 111, 121 (3d Cir. 1983). We did not. The plaintiff in\nMassarsky failed to advance any evidence of disparate\nimpact. Id. Thus, its contemplation of a specific age\ngroup is dicta not binding on this panel. In any event,\nMassarsky predates the Supreme Court’s decisions in\nboth O’Connor and Smith.\n                           28\n\f                              1\n\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit addressed disparate-impact subgroups in Lowe v.\nCommack Union Free Sch. Dist., 886 F.2d 1364 (2d Cir.\n1989). See also Criley v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 119 F.3d\n102, 105 (2d Cir. 1997). Because Lowe predates\nO’Connor, it gives improper significance to the forty-\nand-older line drawn by § 631(a), and fails to compare\nthe textual similarities between § 623(a)(1) and\n§ 623(a)(2). Lowe also rejects subgroup claims because\nspecific types of evidence could be misleading. We do\nnot find Lowe persuasive.\n\n       The Second Circuit’s legal analysis begins with the\npremise that disparate-treatment analysis in Title VII\ncases “generally has focused . . . on the protected group\nof which plaintiff is a member.” Lowe, 886 F.2d at 1373.\nBut Lowe does not address the text of § 623(a)(2).\nDivorced from that text, the Second Circuit allows the\n“general[] . . . focus[]” of a different statute to limit what\nthis statute plainly permits. Lowe does not, and cannot,\nexplain why forty-and-older group membership is\n“utterly irrelevant” to discrimination based on age,\n\n\n\n\n                             29\n\fO’Connor, 517 U.S. at 312, but is the sine qua non of an\nadverse effect based on age.8\n\n      Lowe is primarily concerned with the practical\nimplications of subgroup claims.9 Its main objection is\n\n      8\n          Lowe’s treatment of Teal is similarly\nunpersuasive. See Lowe, 886 F.2d at 1374. We addressed\nthe same argument in Section III.B.3, supra.\n      9\n          For example, Lowe offers a flawed reductio ad\nabsurdum: “an 85 year old plaintiff could seek to prove a\ndiscrimination claim by showing that a hiring practice\ncaused a disparate impact on the ‘sub-group’ of those age\n85 and above, even though all those hired were in their\nlate seventies.” Lowe, 886 F.2d at 1373. This argument\nrelies on the false assumption that an employer who\nfavors 70-year-old employees could not possibly be\nliable under the ADEA. “If an 85-year old person . . .\nfails to attain that position for no reason other than age,\ns/he has suffered age discrimination under the Act . . . .”\nId. at 1380 (Pierce, J., dissenting in relevant part). In any\nevent, we can be reasonably assured that such a\nhypothetical would never arise due to the demographic\ncharacteristics of the workforce, which limit the\nstatistical power to compare impacts on seventy- and\neighty-year-old employees. See Sandra F. Sperino, The\nSky Remains Intact: Why Allowing Subgroup Evidence Is\nConsistent with the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct, 90 Marq. L. Rev. 227, 263 (2006).\n                             30\n\fevidentiary: “any plaintiff can take his or her own age as\nthe lower end of a ‘sub-protected group’ and argue that\nsaid ‘sub-group’ is disparately impacted.” Lowe, 886\nF.2d at 1373. Here, PGW and its amici similarly argue\nthat plaintiffs will be able to “gerrymander” arbitrary age\ngroups in order to manufacture a statistically significant\neffect. We disagree.\n\n       Essentially, PGW and its amici argue that a\nparticular form of evidence carries such a high risk of\nmanipulation that we should interpret the ADEA to\npreclude the entire claim. That is a thoroughly\nunsatisfactory justification for ignoring statutory text and\nSupreme Court precedent.10 Our interpretation of the\nADEA is based on text, not evidentiary gatekeeping.\nThat function is capably performed by district judges\nwho routinely apply the Federal Rules of Evidence and\nDaubert jurisprudence. We consider that to be a\nsufficient safeguard against the menace of unscientific\nmethods and manipulative statistics.\n\n\n      10\n          The Eighth Circuit, which ultimately agreed\nwith Lowe’s outcome, did criticize the Second Circuit’s\nreasoning on this point. See E.E.O.C. v. McDonnell\nDouglas Corp., 191 F.3d 948, 950–51 (8th Cir. 1999)\n(“The fact that a particular interpretation of a statute\nmight spawn lawsuits is not a reason to reject that\ninterpretation.”).\n                            31\n\f       Preliminarily, PGW’s “gerrymandering” objection\nonly applies to the kind of statistical studies that compare\nsubgroups selected by an expert. Some scholars have\nproposed the use of statistical models that treat age as a\ncontinuous variable and thus avoid the need to draw\n“arbitrary” age groups. Options discussed in the literature\ninclude proportional hazards models and logistic\nregression. See Ramona L. Paetzold & Steve L. Willborn,\nThe Statistics of Discrimination: Using Statistical\nEvidence in Discrimination Cases § 7:11, at 372 (2016–\n2017 ed. 2016) [hereinafter Paetzold & Willborn]; see\nalso, e.g., George Woodworth & Joseph Kadane, Age-\nand Time-Varying Proportional Hazards Models for\nEmployment Discrimination, 4 Annals Applied Statistics\n1139 (2010); Michael O. Finkelstein & Bruce Levin,\nProportional Hazard Models for Age Discrimination\nCases, 34 Jurimetrics J. 153 (1994).\n\n        We have no need today to bless any one approach.\n“Statistics ‘come in infinite variety and . . . their\nusefulness depends on all of the surrounding facts and\ncircumstances.’” Watson, 487 U.S. at 995 n.3 (quoting\nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 340 (1977)).\nOur purpose is rather to demonstrate that the\ngerrymandering objection exposes a weakness in one\nparticular research method, not a cause of action. “The\ncontinuous nature of the age variable need not be a\nstatistical problem under disparate-impact analysis;\nexisting statistical procedures can be adapted to the\n\n                            32\n\fspecific needs of disparate-impact analysis.” Paetzold &\nWillborn § 7:11, at 373.\n\n      Even if the statistical evidence in an ADEA case\nuses age groups selected by the expert, PGW and its\namici overstate the risk of manipulation. “The claim can\nbe analyzed, of course, to determine if the result is robust\nacross various age breaks and whether the age breaks can\nbe justified independently of the data . . . .” Id. § 7:3, at\n344. In fact, some courts have long permitted statistical\nsubgroup evidence in the context of disparate-treatment\nclaims. See, e.g., Barnes v. GenCorp Inc., 896 F.2d 1457,\n1466–67 (6th Cir. 1990). We see no reason why that\nsame evidence would be any less workable in a disparate-\nimpact case. See MacNamara v. Korean Air Lines, 863\nF.2d 1135, 1148 (3d Cir. 1988) (“[T]he statistical\nevidence supporting a claim of disparate impact often\nresembles that used to help establish disparate\ntreatment.”).\n\n       So-called “age-break” analysis has well-\nunderstood limitations. See Paetzold & Willborn § 7:3, at\n343–46. For example, if an expert does not devise the age\nbreaks independently of the data, and instead cherry-\npicks groups to manufacture a particular result, that “may\ninvalidate the usual tests of statistical significance.” Id. at\n341. In addition, “the appropriate inference for plaintiffs\nnear a selected age break is always likely to be\nproblematic.” Id. at 344–45. Without more, this challenge\nmay undermine the claims of plaintiffs who “take [their]\n                              33\n\fown age as the lower end of a ‘sub-protected group’ and\nargue that said ‘sub-group’ is disparately impacted.”\nLowe, 886 F.2d at 1373; see also Finch, 865 F. Supp. at\n1129–30 (“If a plaintiff attempts to define the subset too\nnarrowly, he or she will not be able to obtain reliable\nstatistics upon which to prove a prima facie case.”).\n\n       The EEOC and plaintiffs have only argued in favor\nof subgroups with “lower boundaries,” not “upper\nboundaries.” Oral Arg. Tr. 23:24–24:3. That rule would\npreclude, for example, a “banded” 50-to-55 subgroup.\nWe think that limitation is well founded. A plaintiff\nwould benefit from introducing an upper boundary if a\npolicy favored employees older than that limit. But in\nCline, the Supreme Court interpreted the term “age” in\n§ 623(a)(1) to mean “old age.” 540 U.S. at 596. Under\nCline, the ADEA protects only “relatively old worker[s]\nfrom discrimination that works to the advantage of the\nrelatively young.” Id. at 590–91. If a facially neutral\npolicy systematically favors a company’s oldest\nemployees,11 that fact may be fatal to a claim that\n      11\n          We note that the ability to draw inferences about\nthe treatment of a company’s oldest employees may be\nlimited by sample size. In this case, for example,\nplaintiffs’ expert argues that there is no statistically\nsignificant effect on employees age sixty and older\nbecause “[t]here are only 14 terminations, which means\nthe statistical power to detect a significant effect is very\nlow.” A.244–45.\n                            34\n\fmembers of a younger subgroup were disparately\nimpacted because of their “old age.” Id. at 596; see Tex.\nDep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys.\nProject, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2523 (2015) (describing\nthe importance of “[a] robust causality requirement” in\ndisparate-impact cases); Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc.,\n557 U.S. 167, 176 (2009). Thus, a banded subgroup\nwould be self-defeating under Cline, further limiting\nplaintiffs’ ability to gerrymander age groups.\n\n       We reject the notion that the risk of gerrymandered\nevidence is so great that it can override what the text of\nthe statute otherwise permits. District courts should, as in\nany other case, ensure that plaintiffs’ evidence is reliable\nunder Daubert and provides more than the “mere scintilla\nof evidence” needed to survive summary judgment. S.H.\nex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248,\n256 (3d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n(quoting Jakimas v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., 485 F.3d\n770, 777 (3d Cir. 2007)). Accordingly, we are not\npersuaded by Lowe’s legal or practical groundings.\n\n                             2\n\n      The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit addressed disparate-impact subgroups in a non-\nprecedential opinion, Smith v. Tennessee Valley\nAuthority, 924 F.2d 1059, 1991 WL 11271 (6th Cir.\n1991) (table opinion). This decision also predates\nO’Connor. Its reasoning contradicts both O’Connor and\n                            35\n\fTeal, and conflicts with a precedential Sixth Circuit\nopinion that allows subgroup analysis in disparate-\ntreatment cases.\n\n       In Smith, the Sixth Circuit asserts by citation to\nLowe that “[a] plaintiff cannot succeed under a disparate\nimpact theory by showing that younger members of the\nprotected class were preferred over older members of the\nprotected class.” Id. at *4. As we have discussed, Lowe’s\nreasoning is explicitly rejected by O’Connor and Teal.\nTeal held that a plaintiff can succeed under a disparate-\nimpact theory if other members of the protected class\nwere preferred, 457 U.S. at 454, and O’Connor held that\nforty-and-older status is irrelevant to evaluating the\napplication of a protection based on “age,” 517 U.S. at\n312.\n\n       As we have also noted, the Sixth Circuit has long\nrecognized statistical subgroup evidence in disparate-\ntreatment claims. In a precedential opinion, Barnes v.\nGenCorp Inc., 896 F.2d 1457 (6th Cir. 1990), the Sixth\nCircuit specifically rejected the defendant’s argument\nthat “the only valid statistics would necessarily divide the\nemployees into groups age 40-and-over and those under\n40.” Id. at 1466. The Sixth Circuit suggests in a footnote,\nby citation to Lowe, that “[s]uch sub-group analysis may\nnot apply to discriminatory impact cases[.]” Id. at 1467\nn.12. With the exception of that speculative footnote, we\nfind the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Barnes more\npersuasive than its decision in Smith.\n                            36\n\f                           3\n\n      Finally, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nEighth Circuit addressed disparate-impact subgroups in\nE.E.O.C. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 191 F.3d 948\n(8th Cir. 1999). The Eighth Circuit’s analysis is also\nunpersuasive because it contradicts Teal and ignores\nimportant limitations on the scope of disparate-impact\nclaims.\n\n      First, the Eighth Circuit argued that if subgroup\nclaims were cognizable,\n\n      a plaintiff could bring a disparate-impact\n      claim despite the fact that the statistical\n      evidence indicated that an employer’s RIF\n      criteria had a very favorable impact upon the\n      entire protected group of employees aged 40\n      and older, compared to those employees\n      outside the protected group. We do not\n      believe that Congress could have intended\n      such a result.\n\nId. at 951. This is no more than an endorsement of the\nbottom-line defense that the Supreme Court rejected in\nTeal. The State of Connecticut tried a similar argument\nby suggesting that black employees were favored for\npromotions as an overall class. But that bottom-line\noutcome concealed individual rights violations. Far from\nbeing a result “Congress could [not] have intended,” id.,\n                           37\n\fthe Supreme Court’s ruling in Teal vindicated Title VII’s\nplain text and purpose. The same applies to the ADEA.\n\n      Second, the Eighth Circuit panel wrote:\n\n      [T]he consequence would be to require an\n      employer engaging in a RIF to attempt what\n      might well be impossible: to achieve\n      statistical parity among the virtually infinite\n      number of age subgroups in its work force.\n      Adoption of such a theory, moreover, might\n      well have the anomalous result of forcing\n      employers to take age into account in making\n      layoff decisions, which is the very sort of\n      age-based decision-making that the statute\n      proscribes.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., 191 F.3d at 951.12\n\n       Even without the prospect of subgroups, it has\nalways been the case that “a completely neutral practice\nwill inevitably have some disproportionate impact on one\ngroup or another.” DiBiase v. SmithKline Beecham\nCorp., 48 F.3d 719, 731–32 (3d Cir. 1995) (quoting City\nof L.A., Dep't of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S.\n\n      12\n        PGW’s amici make an opposite argument—that\nemployers already fine-tune employment decisions to\navoid creating a disparate impact, and our decision will\nmake it more costly or complicated for them to do so.\n                            38\n\f702, 710 n.20 (1978)). That is precisely why deviating\nfrom statistical parity is not, by itself, enough to incur\ndisparate-impact liability. Just last Term, the Supreme\nCourt recognized that “disparate-impact liability has\nalways been properly limited in key respects” so that it is\nnot “imposed based solely on a showing of a statistical\ndisparity.” Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct. at\n2512; see also Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 657 (showing a\nstatistical disparity alone “will not suffice to make out a\nprima facie case of disparate impact”); Watson, 487 U.S.\nat 994 (plurality opinion) (“[P]laintiff’s burden in\nestablishing a prima facie case goes beyond the need to\nshow that there are statistical disparities in the\nemployer’s work force.”).\n\n        To make out a prima facie case, plaintiffs must\nfirst identify a specific employment practice that causes\nthe disparity. See Wards Cove, 490 U.S. 642; see also\nSmith, 544 U.S. at 241 (noting that the Wards Cove\nholding remains in effect under the ADEA). The\nSupreme Court has recognized that this requirement\nguards against “the myriad of innocent causes that may\nlead to statistical imbalances.” Smith, 544 U.S. at 241\n(quoting Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 657). “Identifying a\nspecific practice is not a trivial burden . . . .” Meacham v.\nKnolls Atomic Power Lab., 554 U.S. 84, 101 (2008); see\nInclusive Communities Project, 135 S. Ct. at 2523 (“[A]\ndisparate-impact claim that relies on a statistical disparity\n\n\n                             39\n\fmust fail if the plaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s\npolicy or policies causing that disparity.”).\n\n       Furthermore, not just any disparity will make out\nthe prima facie case; the disparity must be significant.\nSee Watson, 487 U.S. at 995 (“[S]tatistical disparities\nmust be sufficiently substantial that they raise such an\ninference of causation.”); Teal, 457 U.S. at 446 (“[T]he\nfacially neutral employment practice [must have] had a\nsignificantly discriminatory impact.”); Wards Cove, 490\nU.S. at 657 (requiring a “significantly disparate impact”);\nHazelwood Sch. Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299,\n307–08 (1977) (requiring “gross statistical disparities”).\nWe have not adopted a uniform rule for what this\nrequirement entails; it must be evaluated “on a case-by-\ncase basis.” Watson, 487 U.S. at 995 n.3.\n\n       Finally, even if plaintiffs make out a prima facie\ncase, the RFOA defense imposes a relatively light burden\non employers. See Smith, 544 U.S. at 243. If a company’s\noldest employees are inadvertently disadvantaged by a\nmerit-based policy, for example, the RFOA defense is\ndesigned to address just such a scenario. See id. at 229\n(observing that Congress included the RFOA defense\nbecause age “not uncommonly has relevance to an\nindividual’s capacity to engage in certain types of\nemployment”). But if an employer can provide no\nreasonable justification for a policy that creates a\nsignificant age-based disparity, the ADEA prohibits that\npolicy.\n                            40\n\f       In sum, the limitations applicable to any ADEA\ndisparate-impact claim preclude liability for reasonable\nemployment practices, regardless of subgroups.\nNonetheless, as amici argue, our decision may very well\nrequire employers to be more vigilant about the effects of\ntheir employment practices. “But at the end of the day,\namici’s concerns have to be directed at Congress, which\nset the balance where it is . . . . We have to read it the\nway Congress wrote it.” Meacham, 554 U.S. at 101–02;\nsee Watson, 487 U.S. at 993–99 (plurality opinion)\n(explaining why “disparate impact theory need [not] have\nany chilling effect on legitimate business practices”).\n\n                     *       *       *\n\n       We conclude that ADEA disparate-impact claims\nare not limited to forty-and-older comparisons. While\nclaims based on subgroups present unique challenges, the\nlimitations applicable to any other disparate-impact\ncase—evidentiary gatekeeping, the prima facie case, and\naffirmative     defenses—are     adequate   safeguards.\nAccordingly, we will reverse the District Court’s\ndetermination that PGW is entitled to summary judgment\non this ground.\n\n                            IV\n\n      We now address the District Court’s second\nground for granting summary judgment in favor of PGW:\nthe exclusion of plaintiffs’ statistics expert under Daubert\n                            41\n\fand Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. For the\nreasons that follow, we will vacate and remand for\nfurther Daubert proceedings regarding plaintiffs’\nstatistical evidence. We then turn to plaintiffs’ other\nexpert reports, concluding that the District Court did not\nerr in excluding each.\n\n                            A\n\n       Pursuant to Daubert v. Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), district\ncourts perform a gatekeeping function to ensure that\nexpert testimony meets the requirements of Federal Rule\nof Evidence 702. That function extends not only to\nscientific testimony, but also to other forms of\n“technical” or “specialized” knowledge. Fed R. Evid.\n702(a); Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S.\n137, 141 (1999). “Rule 702 embodies three distinct\nsubstantive restrictions on the admission of expert\ntestimony: qualifications, reliability, and fit.” Elcock v.\nKmart Corp., 233 F.3d 734, 741 (3d Cir. 2000). This case\npresents issues of reliability and fit.\n\n       “In order for expert testimony to meet Daubert’s\nreliability standard, it must be based on the methods and\nprocedures of science, not on subjective belief and\nunsupported speculation.” In re TMI Litig., 193 F.3d 613,\n703–04 (3d Cir. 1999), amended, 199 F.3d 158 (3d Cir.\n2000). “The test of admissibility is not whether a\nparticular scientific opinion has the best foundation, or\n                            42\n\feven whether the opinion is supported by the best\nmethodology or unassailable research.” Id. at 665.\nInstead, the court looks to whether the expert’s testimony\nis supported by “good grounds.” Id. at 665 (quoting In re\nPaoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig. (Paoli II), 35 F.3d 717, 745\n(3d Cir. 1994)). The standard for reliability is “not that\nhigh.” Id. It is “lower than the merits standard of\ncorrectness.” Id. Each aspect of the expert’s opinion\n“must be evaluated practically and flexibly without\nbright-line exclusionary (or inclusionary) rules.” ZF\nMeritor, LLC v. Eaton Corp., 696 F.3d 254, 291 (3d Cir.\n2012) (quoting Heller v. Shaw Indus., Inc., 167 F.3d 146,\n155 (3d Cir. 1999)).\n\n      The “fit” requirement ensures that the evidence or\ntestimony “[helps] the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue.” TMI, 193 F.3d\nat 663 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 702(a)). “This condition\ngoes primarily to relevance.” Id. (quoting Daubert, 509\nU.S. at 591).\n\n       “We review a district court’s decision to admit\nexpert testimony for abuse of discretion and exercise\nplenary review over a district court’s legal interpretation\nof Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.” United\nStates v. Walker, 657 F.3d 160, 175–76 (3d Cir. 2011).\n\n\n\n\n                            43\n\f                             B\n\n      Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Michael Campion, proposes\nto offer statistical evidence in support of the disparate-\nimpact claims. Specifically, Dr. Campion would testify\nthat employees older than forty-five, fifty, and fifty-five\nyears old were likelier to be fired in the March 2009 RIF\nthan were younger employees.\n\n      The District Court identified three grounds13 for\nexclusion: (1) Dr. Campion used facts or data that were\nnot reliable; (2) he failed to use a statistical adjustment\ncalled the Bonferroni procedure; and (3) his testimony\nlacks “fit” to the case because subgroup claims are not\ncognizable. For the reasons that follow, we will vacate\nthe District Court’s order and remand for further Daubert\nproceedings.14\n\n      13\n         The District Court assumed that Dr. Campion is\nqualified. We need not, then, address that issue.\n      14\n          Dr. Campion based his opinion on two analyses:\none using the EEOC’s “four-fifths” test, see 29 C.F.R.\n§ 1607.4 (1987), and another using a more traditional\nstatistical method, a z-score test. The District Court noted\nthat the four-fifths test “has been criticized,” but may be\n“used in conjunction” with other statistical evidence.\nKarlo, 2015 WL 4232600, at *13 (citation omitted). That\ndetermination is not disputed on appeal. We therefore\nfocus on the reliability of Dr. Campion’s z-score test.\n                            44\n\f                            1\n\n      First, the District Court concluded that Dr.\nCampion’s report should be excluded because it is not\nbased on reliable data, contrary to Federal Rule of\nEvidence 702(b). Specifically, Dr. Campion’s dataset\nincluded certain “Evart Terminees” who were not part of\nthe “Agreed Data Set” to which the parties stipulated. We\nconclude that the District Court abused its discretion to\nthe extent that it excluded Dr. Campion’s testimony on\nthis basis because the District Court ignored, without\nexplanation, Dr. Campion’s subsequent analysis.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Campion cured this\ndeficiency, and the District Court’s opinion provides no\nreason to doubt their argument. Specifically, plaintiffs\nclaim that Dr. Campion excluded the Evart Terminees\nand determined that it did not affect his conclusions. At\noral argument, plaintiffs explained that the Evart\nTerminees “skewed the data actually in favor of more of\nthe defendants,” Oral Arg. Tr. 5:6–7, whereas PGW\ninsists that the Evart Terminees “skewed the data to favor\nPlaintiffs’ theory of the case.” Br. Appellee 29.\n\n       It is appropriate for the District Court to address\nthis issue in the first instance. But the District Court\nnoted plaintiffs’ counterargument without addressing it.\nTo the extent that the District Court excluded Dr.\nCampion’s testimony based on problems that were cured\nby subsequent analysis, it abused its discretion. To the\n                            45\n\fextent that the subsequent analysis was deficient, the\nDistrict Court also abused its discretion because it failed\nto provide any justification for discrediting that analysis.\nBecause we will remand for further Daubert proceedings,\nas described below, the District Court will have the\nopportunity to revisit this issue.\n\n                             2\n\n        Next, the District Court determined that Dr.\nCampion “does not apply any of the generally accepted\nstatistical procedures (i.e., the Bonferroni procedure) to\ncorrect his results for the likelihood of a false indication\nof significance. This sort of subgrouping ‘analysis’ is\ndata-snooping, plain and simple.” Karlo, 2015 WL\n4232600, at *13. We conclude that the District Court\napplied an incorrectly rigorous standard for reliability.\n\n       The Bonferroni procedure makes it more difficult\nto find statistical significance where a researcher tests\nmultiple comparisons using the same data. In theory, a\nresearcher who searches for statistical significance in\nmultiple attempts raises the probability of discovering it\npurely by chance, committing Type I error (i.e., finding a\nfalse positive). See Ballew v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 223, 234\n(1978) (describing Type I and Type II errors). The\nBonferroni procedure adjusts for that risk by dividing the\n“critical” significance level by the number of\ncomparisons tested. In this case, PGW’s rebuttal expert,\nDr. James L. Rosenberger, argues that the critical\n                            46\n\fsignificance level should be p < 0.01, rather than the\ntypical p < 0.05, because Dr. Campion tested five age\ngroups (0.05 / 5 = 0.01).15 Once the Bonferroni\nadjustment is applied, Dr. Campion’s results are not\nstatistically significant. Thus, Dr. Rosenberger argues\nthat Dr. Campion cannot reject the null hypothesis and\nreport evidence of disparate impact.16\n\n       Dr. Campion responds that adjusting the required\nsignificance level is generally required in a “data\nsnooping” scenario where a researcher conducts “a huge\nnumber of analyses of all possibilities to try to find\nsomething significant.” A.239. In contrast to “data\nsnooping,” Dr. Campion calls his methodology\n“hypothesis driven”; he evaluates the likelihood of\ntermination on a small number of groups based on logical\nincrements in age to discover “evidence that increasing\nage relates to increased likelihood of termination . . . .”\n\n      15\n          Dr. Campion notes that he tested only four age\ngroups, not five. Dr. Rosenberger tests a subgroup of\nsixty-and-older employees, which Dr. Campion did not\ninclude in his analysis because “[t]here are only 14\nterminations, which means the statistical power to detect\na significant effect is very low.” A.244–45.\n      16\n         The relationship between statistical significance\nand admissibility is currently before this Court in In re\nZoloft (Sertralinehydrochloride) Prod. Liab. Litig., No.\n16-2247, appealing 176 F. Supp. 3d 483 (E.D. Pa. 2016).\n                            47\n\fA.240. He also points out that “nearly all the tests are\nsignificant,” which makes his method analogous to\n“cross-validating the relationship between age and\ntermination at different cut-offs,” or “replication with\ndifferent samples.” A.241. And finally, Dr. Campion\nincludes supplemental results that he claims “control for\nthe error rate by conducting only one analysis . . . .”\nA.242.\n\n       We conclude that the District Court erred by\napplying a “merits standard of correctness,” a higher bar\nthan what Rule 702 demands. TMI, 193 F.3d at 665.\nAfter identifying a potential methodological flaw, the\nDistrict Court did not proceed to evaluate whether Dr.\nCampion’s opinion nonetheless rests on good grounds.\nInstead, it applied a “bright-line exclusionary . . . rule[],”\nZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 291, based on Dr. Campion’s\nfailure to perform a specific arithmetical adjustment. As\nwe have observed, there could be good grounds for an\nexpert’s conclusion “even if the judge thinks that . . . a\nscientist’s methodology has some flaws such that if they\nhad been corrected, the scientist would have reached a\ndifferent result.” Paoli II, 35 F.3d at 744.\n\n        In certain cases, failure to perform a statistical\nadjustment may simply diminish the weight of an\nexpert’s finding. See Paetzold & Willborn § 6:7, at 308\nn.2 (describing the Bonferroni adjustment as “good\nstatistical practice,” but “not widely or consistently\nadopted” in the behavioral and social sciences); E.E.O.C.\n                             48\n\fv. Autozone, Inc., No. 00-2923, 2006 WL 2524093, at *4\n(W.D. Tenn. Aug. 29, 2006) (“[T]he Court does not have\na sufficient basis to find that . . . the non-utilization [of\nthe Bonferroni adjustment] makes [the expert’s] results\nunreliable.”). The question of whether a study’s results\nwere properly calculated or interpreted ordinarily goes to\nthe weight of the evidence, not to its admissibility. See\nLeonard v. Stemtech Int’l Inc., 834 F.3d 376, 391 (3d Cir.\n2016). “Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of\ncontrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden\nof proof are the traditional and appropriate means of\nattacking shaky but admissible evidence.” Daubert, 509\nU.S. at 596; cf. Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 400\n(1986) (“Normally, failure to include variables will affect\nthe analysis’ probativeness, not its admissibility.”).\n\n       “That is not to say that a significant error in\napplication will never go to the admissibility, as opposed\nto the weight, of the evidence.” In re Scrap Metal\nAntitrust Litig., 527 F.3d 517, 530 (6th Cir. 2008). An\nexpert’s failure to use a statistical adjustment may, in\ncertain cases, present a “flaw . . . large enough that the\nexpert lacks ‘good grounds’ for his or her conclusions.”\nPaoli II, 35 F.3d at 746; see Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v.\nHalliburton Co., 309 F.R.D. 251, 266–67 (N.D. Tex.\n2015) (applying a less conservative adjustment, Holm-\nBonferroni, based on “the substantial number of\ncomparisons” made by the expert, and citing an article\nexplaining that the risk of finding false significance is\n\n                             49\n\fprevalent where at least twenty to forty comparisons are\ntested). Nonetheless, “[t]he grounds for the expert’s\nopinion merely have to be good, they do not have to be\nperfect.” Paoli II., 35 F.3d at 744. “So long as the\nexpert’s testimony rests upon ‘good grounds,’ it should\nbe tested by the adversary process . . . rather than\nexcluded from jurors[’] scrutiny for fear that they will not\ngrasp its complexities or satisfactory [sic] weigh its\ninadequacies.” TMI, 193 F.3d at 692 (quoting Ruiz–\nTroche v. Pepsi Cola of P. R. Bottling Co., 161 F.3d 77,\n85 (1st Cir. 1998)). Accordingly, we will remand for\nfurther Daubert proceedings as to Dr. Campion’s\nstatistics-related testimony to allow the District Court to\napply the correct standard for reliability.\n\n                             3\n\n       Finally, the District Court determined that Dr.\nCampion’s statistics lacked fit to the case. “[T]he\nsubgrouping analysis would only be helpful to the\nfactfinder if this Court held that Plaintiffs could maintain\nan over-fifty disparate impact claim.” Karlo, 2015 WL\n4232600, at *13 n.16. Having held that plaintiffs’ over-\nfifty disparate-impact claim is cognizable, we conclude\nthat this ground for exclusion fails as well. Because each\nground fails, we will vacate the District Court’s order\n\n\n\n\n                            50\n\fexcluding Dr. Campion’s statistics-related testimony and\nremand for further Daubert proceedings.17\n\n                           C\n\n       Dr. Campion offered a second expert report on a\ndifferent subject: reasonable human-resources (“HR”)\npractices. We conclude that the District Court did not\nabuse its discretion in excluding this testimony.\n\n       Dr. Campion intended to testify as to twenty\n“reasonable” HR practices that PGW could have, but did\nnot, employ when conducting its RIFs. Plaintiffs aver\nthat this testimony is necessary to rebut PGW’s RFOA\ndefense. The District Court disagreed. It concluded that\nDr. Campion’s HR testimony lacked relevance to the\ncase because “plaintiffs c[ould] rebut Defendants’ RFOA\ndefense only by demonstrating that the factors offered by\nDefendants [we]re unreasonable.” Karlo, 2015 WL\n4232600, at *15 (quoting Powell v. Dallas Morning\nNews L.P., 776 F. Supp. 2d 240, 247 (N.D. Tex. 2011),\naff’d 486 F. App’x 469 (5th Cir. 2012)) (alterations in\noriginal).\n\n       We agree. When a defendant proffers a RFOA, the\nplaintiff can rebut it by showing that the factor relied\n\n      17\n        We do not reach the issue of whether the District\nCourt abused its discretion by declining to hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n                           51\n\fupon is unreasonable, not by identifying twenty other\npractices that would have been reasonable instead. See\nSmith, 544 U.S. at 243 (“While there may have been\nother reasonable ways for the City to achieve its goals,\nthe one selected was not unreasonable.”).\n\n       Plaintiffs also argue that PGW’s proffered RFOA\nfails as a matter of law. If true, that would eliminate the\nneed for Dr. Campion’s HR testimony under plaintiffs’\nown explanation for its relevance. But because the\nDistrict Court did not grant summary judgment on the\nbasis of PGW’s RFOA defense, the question of that\ndefense’s legal sufficiency is not before us.\n\n                            D\n\n       Finally, the District Court excluded the testimony\nof Dr. Anthony G. Greenwald. Dr. Greenwald proposed\nto testify as to his experience with Implicit Association\nTests (IAT), a type of test designed to measure “the\nstrength of a mental association that links a social\ncategory (such as race, gender, or age group) with a trait\n(i.e., a stereotype) . . . .” A.405. Specifically, Dr.\nGreenwald reports that 80% of research participants hold\nan implicit bias based on age. He also evaluated the\ndeposition transcripts of certain PGW employees and\ndetermined that their RIF procedures were susceptible to\nimplicit biases.\n\n\n                            52\n\f       The District Court concluded that Dr. Greenwald’s\ntestimony lacks fit to this case because his population-\nwide statistics have only speculative application to PGW\nand its decision-makers. The District Court also observed\nthat disparate-impact claims do not inquire into the\nemployer’s state of mind. We agree. Plaintiffs are not\nrequired to prove that any particular psychological\nmechanism caused the disparity in question; they are\nonly required to demonstrate that the disparity itself is\n“sufficiently substantial that [it] raise[s] such an\ninference of causation.” Watson, 487 U.S. at 995. That is\nnot to say, however, that implicit-bias testimony is never\nadmissible. Courts may, in their discretion, determine\nthat such testimony elucidates the kind of headwind\ndisparate-impact liability is meant to redress. We are\nsimply unable here to conclude that the District Court\nabused its discretion in excluding this evidence.\n\n                            V\n\n       The final issue presented in this appeal is whether\nthe District Court committed clear error in decertifying\nthe collective action.18 We hold that it did not.\n\n\n      18\n          Defendants argue that we should not reach this\nissue for two reasons. First, they argue that the four opt-\nin plaintiffs were not named in the notice of appeal. We\nhave rejected that argument in Section II of this opinion.\nSecond, they argue that the Notice of Appeal failed to\n                            53\n\f        The collective action19 “is a form of group\nlitigation in which a named employee plaintiff or\nplaintiffs file a complaint ‘in behalf of’ a group of other,\ninitially unnamed employees who purport to be ‘similarly\nsituated’ to the named plaintiff.” Halle v. W. Penn\nAllegheny Health Sys. Inc., 842 F.3d 215, 223 (3d Cir.\n2016). Courts in this circuit use a two-step certification\n\nspecify that plaintiffs sought review of the decertification\norder. We reject that argument as well. We exercise\njurisdiction over orders not specified in a notice of appeal\nif: “[1] there is a connection between the specified and\nunspecified order, [2] the intention to appeal the\nunspecified order is apparent and [3] the opposing party\nis not prejudiced and has a full opportunity to brief the\nissues.” Lusardi v. Xerox Corp., 975 F.2d 964, 972 (3d\nCir. 1992). Each prong is met. The District Court’s 54(b)\nmemorandum stated that “[T]he same reasons that\nwarrant the certification of a final judgment on the\ndisparate impact and disparate treatment claims also fully\njustify an immediate appeal on the decertification\nruling.” Karlo, 2015 WL 5782062, at *4 n.2. Thus,\ndefendants had full notice and opportunity to brief the\nissue.\n      19\n           “[T]he ADEA incorporates enforcement\nprovisions of the [Fair Labor Standards Act], including\nthe collective action provisions of 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).”\nHalle v. W. Penn Allegheny Health Sys. Inc., 842 F.3d\n215, 224 n.8 (3d Cir. 2016).\n                            54\n\fprocess. The first step, so-called conditional certification,\nrequires the named plaintiffs to make a “modest factual\nshowing” to demonstrate “a factual nexus between the\nmanner in which the employer’s alleged policy affected\nhim or her and the manner in which it affected the\nproposed collective action members.” Id. at 224.\n\n       The second step, final certification, is what is at\nissue here. “[T]he named plaintiffs bear the burden of\nshowing that the opt-in plaintiffs are ‘similarly situated’\nto them for FLSA purposes.” Id. at 226. “Being\n‘similarly situated’ . . . means that one is subjected to\nsome common employer practice that, if proved, would\nhelp demonstrate a violation of the FLSA.” Id. (quoting\nZavala v. Wal Mart Stores Inc., 691 F.3d 527, 538 (3d\nCir. 2012)). In determining whether plaintiffs are\nsimilarly situated, relevant factors include:\n\n      whether the plaintiffs are employed in the\n      same corporate department, division, and\n      location; whether they advance similar\n      claims; whether they seek substantially the\n      same form of relief; and whether they have\n      similar salaries and circumstances of\n      employment. Plaintiffs may also be found\n      dissimilar based on the existence of\n      individualized defenses.\n\nZavala, 691 F.3d at 536–37 (emphases added). A district\ncourt’s determination as to whether plaintiffs are\n                             55\n\fsimilarly situated is a finding of fact that we review for\nclear error. Zavala, 691 F.3d at 535.\n\n       In this case, the District Court properly relied on\nZavala in determining that plaintiffs did not meet their\nburden to show that they are similarly situated.\nSpecifically, the District Court observed that the nine\nplaintiffs “held seven different titles with varied job\nduties in two separate divisions of PGW and across five\nlocations in which no less than six decision-makers\nindependently included them in the RIF.” Karlo, 2014\nWL 1317595, at *18. The District Court also based its\nopinion on “[t]he existence of individualized defenses\nand procedural concerns . . . .” Id. at *19. Those\nconsiderations fall squarely within the factors listed in\nZavala.\n\n       To be sure, the named plaintiffs and opt-in\nplaintiffs were each terminated in a single RIF that left\nfull discretion in the hands of local managers. But the\nDistrict Court did not clearly err when it concluded that\n“[t]he similarities among the proposed plaintiffs are too\nfew, and the differences among the proposed plaintiffs\nare too many” for the case to proceed as a collective\naction. Zavala, 691 F.3d at 537–38. Such differences\nmay undermine the “efficiencies for the judicial system\nthrough resolution in one proceeding of common\nissues . . . .” Halle, 842 F.3d at 223; see Zavala, 691 F.3d\nat 538 (“[T]hese common links are of minimal utility in\nstreamlining resolution of these cases.”).\n                            56\n\f       Plaintiffs essentially concede this point, but argue\nthat the “small class size” makes the class “easily\nmanageable even with the presence of potentially\nindividualized defenses and damages evidence.” Br.\nAppellant 34. We decline to read the statutory phrase\n“similarly situated” differently depending on the size of\nthe collective action.\n\n       Plaintiffs are correct that the existence of separate\ndefenses or damage calculations “does not vitiate\nautomatically” the collective action. Lockhart v.\nWestinghouse Credit Corp., 879 F.2d 43, 52 (3d Cir.\n1989) (emphasis added); cf. Tyson Foods, Inc. v.\nBouaphakeo, 136 S. Ct. 1036, 1045 (2016) (quoting 7AA\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur Miller & Mary Kay Kane,\nFederal Practice and Procedure §1778, at 123–24 (3d\ned. 2005)). But under the guidance we have provided in\nZavala, a district court may determine that such\ndifferences are too pronounced for the case to proceed as\na collective action. Under our deferential standard of\nreview, we are simply unable to conclude that the District\nCourt committed clear error.\n\n                            VI\n\n        We conclude that plaintiffs’ disparate-impact\nclaims are cognizable under the ADEA. We will\ntherefore vacate the District Court’s orders granting\nsummary judgment in favor of PGW and excluding the\nstatistics-related testimony of Dr. Campion. We will\n                            57\n\fremand for further Daubert proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion. We will affirm the District Court in all other\nrespects.\n\n\n\n\n                            58\n\f",

The question in this case is\nwhether a disparate-impact claim is cognizable where a\n“subgroup” of employees at the upper end of that\nrange—in this case, employees aged fifty and older—\nwere alleged to have been disfavored relative to younger\nemployees.\n\n       We answer in the affirmative. Our decision is\ndictated by the plain text of the statute as interpreted by\nthe Supreme Court. In particular, the ADEA prohibits\ndisparate impacts based on age, not forty-and-older\nidentity. A rule that disallowed subgroups would ignore\ngenuine statistical disparities that could otherwise be\nactionable through application of the plain text of the\nstatute. Although several of our sister circuits have ruled\nto the contrary, their reasoning relies primarily on policy\narguments that we do not find persuasive.\n\n       We will therefore reverse the judgment of the\nDistrict Court based on its interpretation of the ADEA.\nWe will also vacate the District Court’s order excluding\nthe testimony of plaintiffs’ statistics expert and remand\nfor further Daubert proceedings. We will affirm in all\nother respects.\n\n\n                            4\n\f                            I\n\n      Defendant Pittsburgh Glass Works, LLC (“PGW”)\nmanufactures automotive glass in Harmarville,\nPennsylvania. PGW also owns (1) GTS Services, a\nsoftware business, (2) PGW Auto Glass, an automotive\nreplacement-glass distribution business, (3) LYNX\nServices, an insurance claims administrator, and\n(4) Aquapel, a glass treatment supplier.\n\n       In 2008, the automobile industry began to falter.\nPGW engaged in several reductions in force (“RIFs”) to\noffset deteriorating sales. The RIF of relevance to this\ncase occurred on March 31, 2009, and terminated the\nemployment of approximately one hundred salaried\nemployees in over forty locations or divisions. Individual\nunit directors had broad discretion in selecting whom to\nterminate. PGW did not train those directors in how to\nimplement the RIF. Nor did PGW employ any written\nguidelines or policies, conduct any disparate-impact\nanalysis, review prospective RIF terminees with counsel,\nor document why any particular employee was selected\nfor inclusion in the RIF.\n\n     Plaintiffs Rudolph A. Karlo, William S.\nCunningham, Jeffrey Marietti, David Meixelberger,\nMark K. McLure, Benjamin D. Thompson, and Richard\n\n\n\n                            5\n\fCsukas1 worked in PGW’s Manufacturing Technology\ndivision. They were terminated as part of the March 2009\nRIF by their supervisor, Gary Cannon. Each was over\nfifty years old at the time.\n\n       In January 2010, plaintiffs filed charges of\nemployment discrimination with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”). Thereafter, they\nreceived a Dismissal and Notice of Rights from the\nEEOC, and this lawsuit followed. Plaintiffs brought a\nputative ADEA collective action, asserting three claims:\n(1) disparate treatment, (2) disparate impact, and\n(3) retaliation as to only Karlo and McLure.\n\n       On plaintiffs’ motion for conditional certification,\nthe District Court ruled that ADEA subgroups are\ncognizable, and conditionally certified a collective action\nto be comprised of employees terminated by the RIF who\nwere at least fifty years old at the time. See Karlo v.\nPittsburgh Glass Works, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Three voluntarily dismissed\ntheir claims and four settled. Four opt-ins remained:\nMichael Breen, a former production supervisor at a plant\nin Crestline, Ohio; Matthew Clawson, a former Project\nEngineer in Evansville, Indiana; Stephen Shaw, a former\n\n      1\n        McLure, Thompson, and Csukas settled their\nclaims prior to this appeal.\n                            6\n\fmarketing manager in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and John\nTitus, a former Area Services Manager in Irving, Texas.\n\n       On June 26, 2013, the case was transferred to\nanother district judge. PGW filed a motion to decertify\nthe collective action. On March 31, 2014, the District\nCourt granted the motion, concluding that the collective\naction should be decertified because the opt-in plaintiffs’\nclaims are factually dissimilar from those of the named\nplaintiffs. See Karlo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1317595</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n      PGW then filed motions to exclude plaintiffs’\nexperts. Of relevance to this appeal, PGW sought to\nexclude three areas of expert testimony. First, Dr.\nMichael Campion was prepared to offer statistical\nevidence in favor of plaintiffs’ disparate-impact claim.\nSecond, Dr. Campion intended to offer his expert opinion\non “reasonable” human-resources practices during a RIF.\nAnd third, Dr. Anthony G. Greenwald proposed to testify\nas to age-related implicit-bias studies. By Order dated\nJuly 13, 2015, the District Court excluded the testimony\nof each. See Karlo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4232600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n      PGW moved for summary judgment on each\nclaim. On September 3, 2015, the District Court ruled on\nthe motions, granting them in part and denying them in\npart. See Karlo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5156913</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. As to plaintiffs’\ndisparate-impact claims, the District Court granted\nsummary judgment on two grounds: (1) plaintiffs’ fifty-\nand-older disparate-impact claim is not cognizable under\n                            7\n\fthe ADEA; and (2) plaintiffs’ lack of evidence to support\ntheir claim of disparate impact following the exclusion of\nDr. Campion’s statistics-related testimony. The District\nCourt also granted summary judgment as to plaintiffs’\ndisparate-treatment claims. That ruling has not been\nappealed. Finally, the District Court denied summary\njudgment as to Karlo’s and McLure’s individual\nretaliation claims.\n\n       On October 2, 2015, the District Court certified the\ndisparate-impact and disparate-treatment claims for final\njudgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. See Karlo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5782062</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. This\nappeal followed. Plaintiffs seek reversal of the District\nCourt’s summary judgment decision and statistics-related\nDaubert ruling regarding their disparate-impact claims.\nPlaintiffs also appeal the District Court’s other Daubert\nrulings and its order decertifying the collective action.\n\n                            II\n\n      The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1331. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1291.\n\n      The parties dispute whether our jurisdiction\nextends to one or all named plaintiffs. PGW concedes\nthat Karlo perfected an appeal, but argues that the other\nremaining named plaintiffs—Cunningham, Marietti, and\nMeixelberger—were not identified in the Notice of\n                            8\n\fAppeal, and therefore did not preserve their appellate\nrights under Rule 3(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure.

R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(A). The attorney\n“may describe those parties with such terms as ‘all\nplaintiffs,’ ‘the defendants,’ ‘the plaintiffs A, B, et al.,’ or\n‘all defendants except X.’” Id.\n\n       The Notice of Appeal here states, “Plaintiffs in the\nabove-captioned case hereby appeal . . . an order . . .\nentering judgment against Plaintiffs . . . on Plaintiffs’\ndiscrimination claims . . . .” A.1 (emphases added).

We hold that they are.\n\n\n      3\n         The phrase “in the above captioned case” does\nnot change our interpretation. We read the Notice to\nmean “Plaintiffs in [Civil Action No. 10-1283] hereby\nappeal.”\n                            10\n\f      Disparate-impact claims in ADEA cases ordinarily\nevaluate the effect of a facially neutral policy on all\nemployees who are at least forty years old—that is, all\nemployees covered by the ADEA. In this case, plaintiffs\nclaim to have identified a policy that disproportionately\nimpacted a subgroup of that population: employees older\nthan fifty. But because the policy favored younger\nmembers of the protected class, adding those individuals\nto the comparison group washes out the statistical\nevidence of a disparity.\n\n        Plaintiffs’ claim is cognizable under the ADEA.\nSpecifically, we hold that an ADEA disparate-impact\nclaim may proceed when a plaintiff offers evidence that a\nspecific, facially neutral employment practice caused a\nsignificantly disproportionate adverse impact based on\nage. Plaintiffs can demonstrate such impact with various\nforms      of     evidence,    including   forty-and-older\ncomparisons, subgroup comparisons, or more\nsophisticated statistical modeling, so long as that\nevidence meets the usual standards for admissibility. A\ncontrary rule would ignore significant age-based\ndisparities. Where such disparities exist, they must be\njustified pursuant to the ADEA’s relatively broad\ndefenses.\n\n                            A\n\n     We begin with an overview of the statutory\nscheme. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n                           11\n\f1967, 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.,\nmakes it unlawful for an employer:\n\n      (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n      individual or otherwise discriminate against\n      any individual with respect to his\n      compensation,        terms,     conditions,    or\n      privileges of employment, because of such\n      individual’s age;\n\n      (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\n      employees in any way which would deprive\n      or tend to deprive any individual of\n      employment opportunities or otherwise\n      adversely affect his status as an employee,\n      because of such individual’s age; or\n\n      (3) to reduce the wage rate of any employee\n      in order to comply with this chapter.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a). “Except for substitution of the word\n‘age,’ for the words ‘race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin,’ the language of that provision in the ADEA is\nidentical to that found in § 703(a)(2) of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 (Title VII).” Smith v.

O’Connor clarified that the ADEA\nproscribes age discrimination, not forty-and-over\ndiscrimination. The same interpretation applies to\nidentical operative language in the ADEA’s disparate-\nimpact provision.\n\n      The plaintiff in O’Connor was fifty-six years old\nwhen he was fired and replaced with a younger worker.\n517 U.S. at 309. The plaintiff’s replacement, however,\nwas over the age of forty, and therefore within the class\nof individuals protected by the ADEA. Id. The Fourth\nCircuit held that the ADEA prima facie case requires the\n\n                           15\n\freplacement to be younger than forty years old. Id. at\n310. The Supreme Court reversed.\n\n       The Supreme Court began its analysis with the\nplain text of the statute: “The discrimination prohibited\nby the ADEA is discrimination ‘because of [an]\nindividual’s age,’ though the prohibition is ‘limited to\nindividuals who are at least 40 years of age.’” 517 U.S. at\n312 (alteration in original) (citations omitted). On the\nbasis of that text, the Court held that the ADEA\n\n       does not ban discrimination against\n      employees because they are aged 40 or\n      older; it bans discrimination against\n      employees because of their age, but limits\n      the protected class to those who are 40 or\n      older. The fact that one person in the\n      protected class has lost out to another person\n      in the protected class is thus irrelevant, so\n      long as he has lost out because of his age.\n\nId. Although the ADEA protects a class of individuals at\nleast forty years old, it “prohibits discrimination on the\nbasis of age and not class membership . . . .” Id. at 313. It\nis therefore “utterly irrelevant” that the beneficiary of age\ndiscrimination was also over the age of forty. Id. at 312.\nAccordingly, the proposed limitation on the prima facie\ncase—replacement by an employee younger than forty—\nlacked a “logical connection” to the plain text of the\nADEA. Id. at 311–12. As the Supreme Court later\n                             16\n\freaffirmed, “[it] is beyond reasonable doubt[] that the\nADEA was concerned to protect a relatively old worker\nfrom discrimination that works to the advantage of the\nrelatively young.” Gen.

Requiring the comparison group to include\nemployees in their forties has no “logical connection” to\nthat prohibition. O’Connor, 517 U.S. at 311.\n\n      The key insight from O’Connor is that the forty-\nand-older line drawn by § 631(a) constrains the ADEA’s\ngeneral scope; it does not modify or define the ADEA’s\nsubstantive prohibition against “discriminat[ion] . . .\nbecause of such individual’s age.” § 623(a)(1). The\nADEA protects against “age discrimination []as opposed\nto ‘40 or over’ discrimination . . . .” O’Connor, 517 U.S.\nat 312.\n\n      The disparate-impact provision uses the same\noperative phrase, “because of such individual’s age.” 29\nU.S.C. § 623(a)(2). Our interpretation of it, therefore,\nshould be consistent with our interpretation of the\ndisparate-treatment provision, § 623(a)(1).

Thus, “adversely affect . . . because of such\nindividual’s age” must mean adversely affect based on\nage, not adversely affect based on forty-and-older status.4\n\n       O’Connor’s applicability is not diminished by the\nfact that it addressed a disparate-treatment claim. As\ndemonstrated by the identical operative phrasing of\n§ 623(a)(1) and § 623(a)(2), the two types of claims share\nthe same “ultimate legal issue . . . .” Watson, 487 U.S. at\n987; see also Teal, 457 U.S. at 455–56 (discussed infra\nSection III.B.2).

The Court determined\nthat “[t]he presumption of uniform usage thus relents”\nwhen comparing § 623(a)(1) and § 623(f). Id. at 595. In\nthis case, the presumption holds because § 623(a)(1) and\n§ 623(a)(2) employ “age” in virtually the same context.\nBoth use “age” as in Cline’s second definition, to mean\n“old age.” 540 U.S. at 596.\n                            18\n\fdiscriminatory in operation.

A\nspecific, facially neutral policy that significantly\ndisfavors employees over fifty years old supports a claim\nof disparate impact under the plain text of § 623(a)(2).\nAlthough the employer’s policy might favor younger\nmembers of the forty-and-over cohort, that is an “utterly\nirrelevant factor,” O’Connor, 517 U.S. at 312, in\nevaluating whether a company’s oldest employees were\ndisproportionately affected because of their age.\n\n                            2\n\n       Our decision is further supported by the Supreme\nCourt’s opinion in Connecticut v. Teal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110751\"><a href=\"/opinion/110751/connecticut-v-teal/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1982), a Title VII disparate-impact case. Teal confirms\nthat, even under a disparate-impact theory, the plain text\n                            19\n\fof the statute is designed to protect the rights of\nindividual employees, not the rights of a class.\n\n        In Teal, a Connecticut state agency used a two-step\nprocess to determine eligibility for promotions. First,\nConnecticut required applicants to take a written test.\nSecond, Connecticut selected the employees for\npromotion out of the pool of candidates that passed the\ntest. Id. at 443. Black applicants who failed the test sued,\nadvancing evidence that black employees failed the\nwritten test at a significantly higher rate than white\nemployees. In response, Connecticut argued that, at the\nsecond step of the process, the black employees who\npassed were given preferential treatment through an\naffirmative action program, counterbalancing the\ndiscriminatory effect of the written test. Connecticut\nargued that its two-step process promoted black\nemployees at an overall higher rate than white\nemployees. Id. at 444.\n\n       The Supreme Court rejected this so-called\n“bottom-line” defense and held that the purpose of Title\nVII “is the protection of the individual employee, rather\nthan the protection of the minority group as a whole.” Id.\nat 453–54. “[F]avorable treatment of . . . members of\nthese respondents’ racial group” did not justify\ndiscrimination against other members of the protected\nclass.

The ADEA, like\nTitle VII, protects individuals who are members of a\nprotected class, not a class itself. See 29 U.S.C.\n§ 623(a)(1) (proscribing forms of discrimination\n“because of such individual’s age”); id. § 623(a)(2)\n(same); id. § 631(a) (limiting the ADEA’s scope to\n“individuals who are at least 40 years of age”). Such\nprotection under the statute does not disappear when a\nplaintiff advances a disparate-impact claim. Teal\nprohibits the use of a bottom-line statistic to justify\nignoring a disproportionate impact against individuals\nthat would otherwise be actionable under the plain text of\nthe statute. That is precisely the problem subgroups are\nmeant to address here.\n\n     As a result, Teal answers PGW’s argument that\nemployees older than forty were, as a class, favored to\nkeep their jobs. That is equivalent to Connecticut’s\nargument that black employees were collectively favored\nfor promotions. The Supreme Court rejected that\nargument in Teal, and we reject it here.\n\n       Similar to the position of PGW and its amici in this\ncase, the dissenting Justices in Teal accused the majority\nof “confus[ing] the distinction—uniformly recognized\nuntil today—between disparate impact and disparate\n\n                            21\n\ftreatment.” 457 U.S. at 462 (Powell, J., dissenting). The\nmajority responded as follows:\n\n      The fact remains . . . that irrespective of the\n      form taken by the discriminatory practice, an\n      employer’s treatment of other members of\n      the plaintiffs’ group can be of little comfort\n      to the victims of . . . discrimination. Title VII\n      does not permit the victim of a facially\n      discriminatory policy to be told that he has\n      not been wronged because other persons of\n      his or her race or sex were hired. That answer\n      is no more satisfactory when it is given to\n      victims of a policy that is facially neutral but\n      practically discriminatory. Every individual\n      employee is protected against both\n      discriminatory treatment and practices that\n      are fair in form, but discriminatory in\n      operation.\n\nId. at 455–56 (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). The same reasoning applies to this case. The\nADEA “does not permit the victim of a facially\ndiscriminatory policy to be told that he has not been\nwronged because other persons” aged forty or older were\npreferred. Id. at 455. “That answer is no more\nsatisfactory when it is given to victims of a policy that is\nfacially neutral but practically discriminatory.” Id.\n\n\n                             22\n\f                            3\n\n       PGW and its amici maintain that disparate-impact\nclaims generally rely on comparisons between entire\nclasses. Even in Teal, for example, plaintiffs’ evidence\nshowed that the written test caused a disparate impact on\nblack employees as a class. 457 U.S. at 443. That general\nfocus on groups, however, is explained by the fact that\nTitle VII protects group identities like race and sex. The\ntrait protected by the ADEA, age, is qualitatively\ndifferent.\n\n       “The term ‘age’ employed by the ADEA is not . . .\ncomparable to the terms ‘race’ or ‘sex’ employed by Title\nVII.” Cline, 540 U.S. at 597. Age is a continuous\nvariable, whereas race and sex are treated categorically in\nthe mine-run of Title VII cases. See Bienkowski v.

Because Lowe predates\nO’Connor, it gives improper significance to the forty-\nand-older line drawn by § 631(a), and fails to compare\nthe textual similarities between § 623(a)(1) and\n§ 623(a)(2). Lowe also rejects subgroup claims because\nspecific types of evidence could be misleading. We do\nnot find Lowe persuasive.\n\n       The Second Circuit’s legal analysis begins with the\npremise that disparate-treatment analysis in Title VII\ncases “generally has focused . . . on the protected group\nof which plaintiff is a member.” Lowe, 886 F.2d at 1373.\nBut Lowe does not address the text of § 623(a)(2).\nDivorced from that text, the Second Circuit allows the\n“general[] . . . focus[]” of a different statute to limit what\nthis statute plainly permits. Lowe does not, and cannot,\nexplain why forty-and-older group membership is\n“utterly irrelevant” to discrimination based on age,\n\n\n\n\n                             29\n\fO’Connor, 517 U.S. at 312, but is the sine qua non of an\nadverse effect based on age.8\n\n      Lowe is primarily concerned with the practical\nimplications of subgroup claims.9 Its main objection is\n\n      8\n          Lowe’s treatment of Teal is similarly\nunpersuasive. See Lowe, 886 F.2d at 1374. We addressed\nthe same argument in Section III.B.3, supra.\n      9\n          For example, Lowe offers a flawed reductio ad\nabsurdum: “an 85 year old plaintiff could seek to prove a\ndiscrimination claim by showing that a hiring practice\ncaused a disparate impact on the ‘sub-group’ of those age\n85 and above, even though all those hired were in their\nlate seventies.” Lowe, 886 F.2d at 1373. This argument\nrelies on the false assumption that an employer who\nfavors 70-year-old employees could not possibly be\nliable under the ADEA. “If an 85-year old person . . .\nfails to attain that position for no reason other than age,\ns/he has suffered age discrimination under the Act . . . .”\nId. at 1380 (Pierce, J., dissenting in relevant part). In any\nevent, we can be reasonably assured that such a\nhypothetical would never arise due to the demographic\ncharacteristics of the workforce, which limit the\nstatistical power to compare impacts on seventy- and\neighty-year-old employees. See Sandra F. Sperino, The\nSky Remains Intact: Why Allowing Subgroup Evidence Is\nConsistent with the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct, 90 Marq. L. Rev. 227, 263 (2006).\n                             30\n\fevidentiary: “any plaintiff can take his or her own age as\nthe lower end of a ‘sub-protected group’ and argue that\nsaid ‘sub-group’ is disparately impacted.” Lowe, 886\nF.2d at 1373. Here, PGW and its amici similarly argue\nthat plaintiffs will be able to “gerrymander” arbitrary age\ngroups in order to manufacture a statistically significant\neffect. We disagree.\n\n       Essentially, PGW and its amici argue that a\nparticular form of evidence carries such a high risk of\nmanipulation that we should interpret the ADEA to\npreclude the entire claim. That is a thoroughly\nunsatisfactory justification for ignoring statutory text and\nSupreme Court precedent.10 Our interpretation of the\nADEA is based on text, not evidentiary gatekeeping.\nThat function is capably performed by district judges\nwho routinely apply the Federal Rules of Evidence and\nDaubert jurisprudence. We consider that to be a\nsufficient safeguard against the menace of unscientific\nmethods and manipulative statistics.\n\n\n      10\n          The Eighth Circuit, which ultimately agreed\nwith Lowe’s outcome, did criticize the Second Circuit’s\nreasoning on this point. See E.E.O.C. v. McDonnell\nDouglas Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766177\"><a href=\"/opinion/766177/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-v-mcdonnell-douglas-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 950–51 (8th Cir. 1999)\n(“The fact that a particular interpretation of a statute\nmight spawn lawsuits is not a reason to reject that\ninterpretation.”).\n                            31\n\f       Preliminarily, PGW’s “gerrymandering” objection\nonly applies to the kind of statistical studies that compare\nsubgroups selected by an expert. Some scholars have\nproposed the use of statistical models that treat age as a\ncontinuous variable and thus avoid the need to draw\n“arbitrary” age groups. Options discussed in the literature\ninclude proportional hazards models and logistic\nregression. See Ramona L. Paetzold & Steve L. Willborn,\nThe Statistics of Discrimination: Using Statistical\nEvidence in Discrimination Cases § 7:11, at 372 (2016–\n2017 ed. 2016) [hereinafter Paetzold & Willborn]; see\nalso, e.g., George Woodworth & Joseph Kadane, Age-\nand Time-Varying Proportional Hazards Models for\nEmployment Discrimination, 4 Annals Applied Statistics\n1139 (2010); Michael O. Finkelstein & Bruce Levin,\nProportional Hazard Models for Age Discrimination\nCases, 34 Jurimetrics J. 153 (1994).\n\n        We have no need today to bless any one approach.\n“Statistics ‘come in infinite variety and . . . their\nusefulness depends on all of the surrounding facts and\ncircumstances.’” Watson, 487 U.S. at 995 n.3 (quoting\nTeamsters v.

In fact, some courts have long permitted statistical\nsubgroup evidence in the context of disparate-treatment\nclaims. See, e.g., Barnes v.

See Paetzold & Willborn § 7:3, at\n343–46. For example, if an expert does not devise the age\nbreaks independently of the data, and instead cherry-\npicks groups to manufacture a particular result, that “may\ninvalidate the usual tests of statistical significance.” Id. at\n341. In addition, “the appropriate inference for plaintiffs\nnear a selected age break is always likely to be\nproblematic.” Id. at 344–45. Without more, this challenge\nmay undermine the claims of plaintiffs who “take [their]\n                              33\n\fown age as the lower end of a ‘sub-protected group’ and\nargue that said ‘sub-group’ is disparately impacted.”\nLowe, 886 F.2d at 1373; see also Finch, 865 F. Supp. at\n1129–30 (“If a plaintiff attempts to define the subset too\nnarrowly, he or she will not be able to obtain reliable\nstatistics upon which to prove a prima facie case.”).\n\n       The EEOC and plaintiffs have only argued in favor\nof subgroups with “lower boundaries,” not “upper\nboundaries.” Oral Arg. Tr. 23:24–24:3. That rule would\npreclude, for example, a “banded” 50-to-55 subgroup.\nWe think that limitation is well founded. A plaintiff\nwould benefit from introducing an upper boundary if a\npolicy favored employees older than that limit. But in\nCline, the Supreme Court interpreted the term “age” in\n§ 623(a)(1) to mean “old age.” 540 U.S. at 596. Under\nCline, the ADEA protects only “relatively old worker[s]\nfrom discrimination that works to the advantage of the\nrelatively young.” Id. at 590–91. If a facially neutral\npolicy systematically favors a company’s oldest\nemployees,11 that fact may be fatal to a claim that\n      11\n          We note that the ability to draw inferences about\nthe treatment of a company’s oldest employees may be\nlimited by sample size. In this case, for example,\nplaintiffs’ expert argues that there is no statistically\nsignificant effect on employees age sixty and older\nbecause “[t]here are only 14 terminations, which means\nthe statistical power to detect a significant effect is very\nlow.” A.244–45.\n                            34\n\fmembers of a younger subgroup were disparately\nimpacted because of their “old age.” Id. at 596; see Tex.\nDep’t of Hous. & Cmty.

The Eighth Circuit’s analysis is also\nunpersuasive because it contradicts Teal and ignores\nimportant limitations on the scope of disparate-impact\nclaims.\n\n      First, the Eighth Circuit argued that if subgroup\nclaims were cognizable,\n\n      a plaintiff could bring a disparate-impact\n      claim despite the fact that the statistical\n      evidence indicated that an employer’s RIF\n      criteria had a very favorable impact upon the\n      entire protected group of employees aged 40\n      and older, compared to those employees\n      outside the protected group. We do not\n      believe that Congress could have intended\n      such a result.\n\nId. at 951. This is no more than an endorsement of the\nbottom-line defense that the Supreme Court rejected in\nTeal. The State of Connecticut tried a similar argument\nby suggesting that black employees were favored for\npromotions as an overall class. But that bottom-line\noutcome concealed individual rights violations. Far from\nbeing a result “Congress could [not] have intended,” id.,\n                           37\n\fthe Supreme Court’s ruling in Teal vindicated Title VII’s\nplain text and purpose. The same applies to the ADEA.\n\n      Second, the Eighth Circuit panel wrote:\n\n      [T]he consequence would be to require an\n      employer engaging in a RIF to attempt what\n      might well be impossible: to achieve\n      statistical parity among the virtually infinite\n      number of age subgroups in its work force.\n      Adoption of such a theory, moreover, might\n      well have the anomalous result of forcing\n      employers to take age into account in making\n      layoff decisions, which is the very sort of\n      age-based decision-making that the statute\n      proscribes.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., 191 F.3d at 951.12\n\n       Even without the prospect of subgroups, it has\nalways been the case that “a completely neutral practice\nwill inevitably have some disproportionate impact on one\ngroup or another.” DiBiase v.

See Smith, 544 U.S. at 243. If a company’s\noldest employees are inadvertently disadvantaged by a\nmerit-based policy, for example, the RFOA defense is\ndesigned to address just such a scenario. See id. at 229\n(observing that Congress included the RFOA defense\nbecause age “not uncommonly has relevance to an\nindividual’s capacity to engage in certain types of\nemployment”). But if an employer can provide no\nreasonable justification for a policy that creates a\nsignificant age-based disparity, the ADEA prohibits that\npolicy.\n                            40\n\f       In sum, the limitations applicable to any ADEA\ndisparate-impact claim preclude liability for reasonable\nemployment practices, regardless of subgroups.\nNonetheless, as amici argue, our decision may very well\nrequire employers to be more vigilant about the effects of\ntheir employment practices. “But at the end of the day,\namici’s concerns have to be directed at Congress, which\nset the balance where it is . . . . We have to read it the\nway Congress wrote it.” Meacham, 554 U.S. at 101–02;\nsee Watson, 487 U.S. at 993–99 (plurality opinion)\n(explaining why “disparate impact theory need [not] have\nany chilling effect on legitimate business practices”).\n\n                     *       *       *\n\n       We conclude that ADEA disparate-impact claims\nare not limited to forty-and-older comparisons.

Specifically, Dr. Campion would testify\nthat employees older than forty-five, fifty, and fifty-five\nyears old were likelier to be fired in the March 2009 RIF\nthan were younger employees.\n\n      The District Court identified three grounds13 for\nexclusion: (1) Dr. Campion used facts or data that were\nnot reliable; (2) he failed to use a statistical adjustment\ncalled the Bonferroni procedure; and (3) his testimony\nlacks “fit” to the case because subgroup claims are not\ncognizable. For the reasons that follow, we will vacate\nthe District Court’s order and remand for further Daubert\nproceedings.14\n\n      13\n         The District Court assumed that Dr. Campion is\nqualified. We need not, then, address that issue.\n      14\n          Dr. Campion based his opinion on two analyses:\none using the EEOC’s “four-fifths” test, see 29 C.F.R.\n§ 1607.4 (1987), and another using a more traditional\nstatistical method, a z-score test. The District Court noted\nthat the four-fifths test “has been criticized,” but may be\n“used in conjunction” with other statistical evidence.\nKarlo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4232600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *13 (citation omitted). That\ndetermination is not disputed on appeal. We therefore\nfocus on the reliability of Dr. Campion’s z-score test.\n                            44\n\f                            1\n\n      First, the District Court concluded that Dr.\nCampion’s report should be excluded because it is not\nbased on reliable data, contrary to Federal Rule of\nEvidence 702(b). Specifically, Dr. Campion’s dataset\nincluded certain “Evart Terminees” who were not part of\nthe “Agreed Data Set” to which the parties stipulated. We\nconclude that the District Court abused its discretion to\nthe extent that it excluded Dr. Campion’s testimony on\nthis basis because the District Court ignored, without\nexplanation, Dr. Campion’s subsequent analysis.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Campion cured this\ndeficiency, and the District Court’s opinion provides no\nreason to doubt their argument. Specifically, plaintiffs\nclaim that Dr. Campion excluded the Evart Terminees\nand determined that it did not affect his conclusions. At\noral argument, plaintiffs explained that the Evart\nTerminees “skewed the data actually in favor of more of\nthe defendants,” Oral Arg. Tr. 5:6–7, whereas PGW\ninsists that the Evart Terminees “skewed the data to favor\nPlaintiffs’ theory of the case.” Br. Appellee 29.\n\n       It is appropriate for the District Court to address\nthis issue in the first instance. But the District Court\nnoted plaintiffs’ counterargument without addressing it.\nTo the extent that the District Court excluded Dr.\nCampion’s testimony based on problems that were cured\nby subsequent analysis, it abused its discretion. To the\n                            45\n\fextent that the subsequent analysis was deficient, the\nDistrict Court also abused its discretion because it failed\nto provide any justification for discrediting that analysis.\nBecause we will remand for further Daubert proceedings,\nas described below, the District Court will have the\nopportunity to revisit this issue.\n\n                             2\n\n        Next, the District Court determined that Dr.\nCampion “does not apply any of the generally accepted\nstatistical procedures (i.e., the Bonferroni procedure) to\ncorrect his results for the likelihood of a false indication\nof significance. This sort of subgrouping ‘analysis’ is\ndata-snooping, plain and simple.” Karlo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">4232600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *13. We conclude that the District Court\napplied an incorrectly rigorous standard for reliability.\n\n       The Bonferroni procedure makes it more difficult\nto find statistical significance where a researcher tests\nmultiple comparisons using the same data. In theory, a\nresearcher who searches for statistical significance in\nmultiple attempts raises the probability of discovering it\npurely by chance, committing Type I error (i.e., finding a\nfalse positive). See Ballew v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109814\"><a href=\"/opinion/109814/ballew-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 234\n(1978) (describing Type I and Type II errors). The\nBonferroni procedure adjusts for that risk by dividing the\n“critical” significance level by the number of\ncomparisons tested. In this case, PGW’s rebuttal expert,\nDr. James L. Rosenberger, argues that the critical\n                            46\n\fsignificance level should be p < 0.01, rather than the\ntypical p < 0.05, because Dr. Campion tested five age\ngroups (0.05 / 5 = 0.01).15 Once the Bonferroni\nadjustment is applied, Dr. Campion’s results are not\nstatistically significant. Thus, Dr. Rosenberger argues\nthat Dr. Campion cannot reject the null hypothesis and\nreport evidence of disparate impact.16\n\n       Dr. Campion responds that adjusting the required\nsignificance level is generally required in a “data\nsnooping” scenario where a researcher conducts “a huge\nnumber of analyses of all possibilities to try to find\nsomething significant.” A.239. In contrast to “data\nsnooping,” Dr. Campion calls his methodology\n“hypothesis driven”; he evaluates the likelihood of\ntermination on a small number of groups based on logical\nincrements in age to discover “evidence that increasing\nage relates to increased likelihood of termination . . . .”\n\n      15\n          Dr. Campion notes that he tested only four age\ngroups, not five. Dr. Rosenberger tests a subgroup of\nsixty-and-older employees, which Dr. Campion did not\ninclude in his analysis because “[t]here are only 14\nterminations, which means the statistical power to detect\na significant effect is very low.” A.244–45.\n      16\n         The relationship between statistical significance\nand admissibility is currently before this Court in In re\nZoloft (Sertralinehydrochloride) Prod. Liab. Litig., No.\n16-2247, appealing </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

He also points out that “nearly all the tests are\nsignificant,” which makes his method analogous to\n“cross-validating the relationship between age and\ntermination at different cut-offs,” or “replication with\ndifferent samples.” A.241. And finally, Dr. Campion\nincludes supplemental results that he claims “control for\nthe error rate by conducting only one analysis . . . .”\nA.242.\n\n       We conclude that the District Court erred by\napplying a “merits standard of correctness,” a higher bar\nthan what Rule 702 demands. TMI, 193 F.3d at 665.\nAfter identifying a potential methodological flaw, the\nDistrict Court did not proceed to evaluate whether Dr.\nCampion’s opinion nonetheless rests on good grounds.\nInstead, it applied a “bright-line exclusionary . . . rule[],”\nZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 291, based on Dr. Campion’s\nfailure to perform a specific arithmetical adjustment. As\nwe have observed, there could be good grounds for an\nexpert’s conclusion “even if the judge thinks that . . . a\nscientist’s methodology has some flaws such that if they\nhad been corrected, the scientist would have reached a\ndifferent result.” Paoli II, 35 F.3d at 744.\n\n        In certain cases, failure to perform a statistical\nadjustment may simply diminish the weight of an\nexpert’s finding.

Having held that plaintiffs’ over-\nfifty disparate-impact claim is cognizable, we conclude\nthat this ground for exclusion fails as well. Because each\nground fails, we will vacate the District Court’s order\n\n\n\n\n                            50\n\fexcluding Dr. Campion’s statistics-related testimony and\nremand for further Daubert proceedings.17\n\n                           C\n\n       Dr. Campion offered a second expert report on a\ndifferent subject: reasonable human-resources (“HR”)\npractices. We conclude that the District Court did not\nabuse its discretion in excluding this testimony.\n\n       Dr. Campion intended to testify as to twenty\n“reasonable” HR practices that PGW could have, but did\nnot, employ when conducting its RIFs. Plaintiffs aver\nthat this testimony is necessary to rebut PGW’s RFOA\ndefense. The District Court disagreed. It concluded that\nDr. Campion’s HR testimony lacked relevance to the\ncase because “plaintiffs c[ould] rebut Defendants’ RFOA\ndefense only by demonstrating that the factors offered by\nDefendants [we]re unreasonable.” Karlo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">4232600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *15 (quoting Powell v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247 (N.D. Tex. 2011),\naff’d 486 F. App’x 469 (5th Cir. 2012)) (alterations in\noriginal).\n\n       We agree. When a defendant proffers a RFOA, the\nplaintiff can rebut it by showing that the factor relied\n\n      17\n        We do not reach the issue of whether the District\nCourt abused its discretion by declining to hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n                           51\n\fupon is unreasonable, not by identifying twenty other\npractices that would have been reasonable instead. See\nSmith, 544 U.S. at 243 (“While there may have been\nother reasonable ways for the City to achieve its goals,\nthe one selected was not unreasonable.”).\n\n       Plaintiffs also argue that PGW’s proffered RFOA\nfails as a matter of law. If true, that would eliminate the\nneed for Dr. Campion’s HR testimony under plaintiffs’\nown explanation for its relevance. But because the\nDistrict Court did not grant summary judgment on the\nbasis of PGW’s RFOA defense, the question of that\ndefense’s legal sufficiency is not before us.\n\n                            D\n\n       Finally, the District Court excluded the testimony\nof Dr. Anthony G. Greenwald. Dr. Greenwald proposed\nto testify as to his experience with Implicit Association\nTests (IAT), a type of test designed to measure “the\nstrength of a mental association that links a social\ncategory (such as race, gender, or age group) with a trait\n(i.e., a stereotype) . . . .” A.405. Specifically, Dr.\nGreenwald reports that 80% of research participants hold\nan implicit bias based on age. He also evaluated the\ndeposition transcripts of certain PGW employees and\ndetermined that their RIF procedures were susceptible to\nimplicit biases.\n\n\n                            52\n\f       The District Court concluded that Dr. Greenwald’s\ntestimony lacks fit to this case because his population-\nwide statistics have only speculative application to PGW\nand its decision-makers. The District Court also observed\nthat disparate-impact claims do not inquire into the\nemployer’s state of mind. We agree. Plaintiffs are not\nrequired to prove that any particular psychological\nmechanism caused the disparity in question; they are\nonly required to demonstrate that the disparity itself is\n“sufficiently substantial that [it] raise[s] such an\ninference of causation.” Watson, 487 U.S. at 995. That is\nnot to say, however, that implicit-bias testimony is never\nadmissible. Courts may, in their discretion, determine\nthat such testimony elucidates the kind of headwind\ndisparate-impact liability is meant to redress. We are\nsimply unable here to conclude that the District Court\nabused its discretion in excluding this evidence.\n\n                            V\n\n       The final issue presented in this appeal is whether\nthe District Court committed clear error in decertifying\nthe collective action.18 We hold that it did not.\n\n\n      18\n          Defendants argue that we should not reach this\nissue for two reasons. First, they argue that the four opt-\nin plaintiffs were not named in the notice of appeal. We\nhave rejected that argument in Section II of this opinion.\nSecond, they argue that the Notice of Appeal failed to\n                            53\n\f        The collective action19 “is a form of group\nlitigation in which a named employee plaintiff or\nplaintiffs file a complaint ‘in behalf of’ a group of other,\ninitially unnamed employees who purport to be ‘similarly\nsituated’ to the named plaintiff.” Halle v. W. Penn\nAllegheny Health Sys. Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223 (3d Cir.\n2016). Courts in this circuit use a two-step certification\n\nspecify that plaintiffs sought review of the decertification\norder. We reject that argument as well. We exercise\njurisdiction over orders not specified in a notice of appeal\nif: “[1] there is a connection between the specified and\nunspecified order, [2] the intention to appeal the\nunspecified order is apparent and [3] the opposing party\nis not prejudiced and has a full opportunity to brief the\nissues.” Lusardi v. Xerox Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591134\"><a href=\"/opinion/591134/jules-lusardi-walter-n-hill-james-marr-jr-and-john-f-weiss/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">964</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 972 (3d\nCir. 1992). Each prong is met. The District Court’s 54(b)\nmemorandum stated that “[T]he same reasons that\nwarrant the certification of a final judgment on the\ndisparate impact and disparate treatment claims also fully\njustify an immediate appeal on the decertification\nruling.” Karlo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5782062</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 n.2. Thus,\ndefendants had full notice and opportunity to brief the\nissue.\n      19\n           “[T]he ADEA incorporates enforcement\nprovisions of the [Fair Labor Standards Act], including\nthe collective action provisions of 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).”\nHalle v. W. Penn Allegheny Health Sys. Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">215</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224 n.8 (3d Cir. 2016).\n                            54\n\fprocess. The first step, so-called conditional certification,\nrequires the named plaintiffs to make a “modest factual\nshowing” to demonstrate “a factual nexus between the\nmanner in which the employer’s alleged policy affected\nhim or her and the manner in which it affected the\nproposed collective action members.” Id. at 224.\n\n       The second step, final certification, is what is at\nissue here. “[T]he named plaintiffs bear the burden of\nshowing that the opt-in plaintiffs are ‘similarly situated’\nto them for FLSA purposes.” Id. at 226. “Being\n‘similarly situated’ . . . means that one is subjected to\nsome common employer practice that, if proved, would\nhelp demonstrate a violation of the FLSA.” Id. (quoting\nZavala v. Wal Mart Stores Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538 (3d\nCir. 2012)). In determining whether plaintiffs are\nsimilarly situated, relevant factors include:\n\n      whether the plaintiffs are employed in the\n      same corporate department, division, and\n      location; whether they advance similar\n      claims; whether they seek substantially the\n      same form of relief; and whether they have\n      similar salaries and circumstances of\n      employment. Plaintiffs may also be found\n      dissimilar based on the existence of\n      individualized defenses.\n\nZavala, 691 F.3d at 536–37 (emphases added). A district\ncourt’s determination as to whether plaintiffs are\n                             55\n\fsimilarly situated is a finding of fact that we review for\nclear error. Zavala, 691 F.3d at 535.\n\n       In this case, the District Court properly relied on\nZavala in determining that plaintiffs did not meet their\nburden to show that they are similarly situated.\nSpecifically, the District Court observed that the nine\nplaintiffs “held seven different titles with varied job\nduties in two separate divisions of PGW and across five\nlocations in which no less than six decision-makers\nindependently included them in the RIF.” Karlo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1317595</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *18. The District Court also based its\nopinion on “[t]he existence of individualized defenses\nand procedural concerns . . . .” Id. at *19. Those\nconsiderations fall squarely within the factors listed in\nZavala.\n\n       To be sure, the named plaintiffs and opt-in\nplaintiffs were each terminated in a single RIF that left\nfull discretion in the hands of local managers. But the\nDistrict Court did not clearly err when it concluded that\n“[t]he similarities among the proposed plaintiffs are too\nfew, and the differences among the proposed plaintiffs\nare too many” for the case to proceed as a collective\naction. Zavala, 691 F.3d at 537–38. Such differences\nmay undermine the “efficiencies for the judicial system\nthrough resolution in one proceeding of common\nissues . . . .” Halle, 842 F.3d at 223; see Zavala, 691 F.3d\nat 538 (“[T]hese common links are of minimal utility in\nstreamlining resolution of these cases.”).\n                            56\n\f       Plaintiffs essentially concede this point, but argue\nthat the “small class size” makes the class “easily\nmanageable even with the presence of potentially\nindividualized defenses and damages evidence.” Br.\nAppellant 34. We decline to read the statutory phrase\n“similarly situated” differently depending on the size of\nthe collective action.\n\n       Plaintiffs are correct that the existence of separate\ndefenses or damage calculations “does not vitiate\nautomatically” the collective action.

But under the guidance we have provided in\nZavala, a district court may determine that such\ndifferences are too pronounced for the case to proceed as\na collective action. Under our deferential standard of\nreview, we are simply unable to conclude that the District\nCourt committed clear error.\n\n                            VI\n\n        We conclude that plaintiffs’ disparate-impact\nclaims are cognizable under the ADEA. We will\ntherefore vacate the District Court’s orders granting\nsummary judgment in favor of PGW and excluding the\nstatistics-related testimony of Dr. Campion. We will\n                            57\n\fremand for further Daubert proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion. We will affirm the District Court in all other\nrespects.\n\n\n\n\n                            58\n\f</pre>",
