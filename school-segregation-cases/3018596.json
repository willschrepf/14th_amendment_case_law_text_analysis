LEWIS,\n\n          Plaintiff,\n                 v.                                        Civil Action No. 15-521 (JEB)\n GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF\n COLUMBIA, et al.,\n\n          Defendants.\n\n\n                                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Happily ensconced in the District of Columbia’s new Consolidated Forensic Sciences\n\nLaboratory, the city’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) decided that all employees\n\nstationed there had to take a drug test as a condition of continued employment. Plaintiff Patricia\n\nLewis, formerly employed as a human-resources adviser with OCME, balked. Objecting on\n\nprivacy grounds, she refused to take the test and was fired nine months later. She then brought\n\nthis suit against the District, former Mayor Vincent Gray, and a number of its officials.\n\nAlthough the crux of her grievance lies with the drug testing, her Complaint is muddied by a\n\nskein of claims under the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, state statutes, and state common\n\nlaw. A subset of Defendants – the District, former Mayor Gray, and OCME’s Chief of Staff,\n\nBeverly Fields – now moves to dismiss. The Court will grant in part and deny in part their\n\nMotion.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Before her termination in 2013, Lewis held the job of “[Human Resources] Advisor,\n\nManagement Liaison Specialist” in the city’s Office of Chief Medical Examiner. See Am.\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fCompl., ¶ 20. OCME’s duties include autopsies as well as other forensic and medicolegal\n\ninvestigations. See generally D.C. Code Ann. § 5-1401 et seq. When she was hired, OCME was\n\nlocated in an office building on Massachusetts Avenue in Southeast Washington. See id., ¶ 24.\n\nSometime in or before July 2012, the city informed OCME’s workforce that it would be moved\n\nto a new facility: the city’s Consolidated Forensic Sciences Laboratory. See id., ¶ 21. The new\n\nlaboratory, which opened in October 2012, was designed to house under one roof a number of\n\ncity departments, including OCME, the Department of Forensic Sciences, and several divisions\n\nof the Metropolitan Police Department, such as the Firearms and Fingerprint Examination\n\nDivision, the DNA laboratory, and the Forensic Sciences Services Division. See D.C. Council\n\nResolution No. 19-726 § 2(b) (Dec. 4, 2012).\n\n       During a staff meeting on July 18, 2012, an attorney for the city, Charles Tucker,\n\ninformed OCME employees that, as a condition of their ability to relocate to the new laboratory,\n\nand thus to maintain their jobs, they would be required to consent to a set of background checks\n\ndetailed in a 2012 Mayor’s Order. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 21, 22, 28 (citing Mayor’s Order 2012-\n\n84); Def. Mot., Exh. A (Mayor’s Order 2012-84). The Order indicated that the city’s\n\nDepartment of Human Resources possessed the authority to require employees with “a duty\n\nstation” at the new laboratory to submit to some combination of “background checks,\n\ninvestigations, mandatory criminal background checks, and tests for controlled substance use.”\n\nMayor’s Order 2012-84 at 2. Tucker stated that employees had until 4:00 p.m. that day to sign a\n\n“Notification of [] Drug and Alcohol Testing Form,” which also required disclosure of “any\n\ncurrent medications,” or risk being fired. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 21, 22.\n\n       Lewis “immediately protested” both the requirements themselves and the short timeframe\n\nthat employees were given to respond. See id., ¶ 23. She alleges that she made her objections\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fknown “verbally” to an unspecified audience on July 18, 2012, and “in writing” in a letter to\n\nTucker two days later. See id., ¶¶ 23, 24. In the letter, Lewis stated that she was “hired into a\n\nnon-sensitive position that has not been reclassified, nor designated as high risk,” suggesting that\n\ncertain inquiries into her background, like the drug test, were unwarranted. See id., ¶ 23.\n\nPlaintiff received a written response from Tucker on August 30, 2012, which stated definitively\n\nthat, “due to the relocations of your position to the new facility, you will be subject to mandatory\n\ncriminal background checks and testing for controlled substance use in accordance with [M.O.\n\n2012-84].” Id., ¶ 27. According to Lewis, she refused to “submit[] to the background check,”\n\nincluding a drug test. See id., ¶ 24.\n\n       Plaintiff claims that, as a consequence of her refusal to comply with those requirements,\n\nshe suffered repeated mistreatment at the hands of the city and its agents. The first set of wrongs\n\nrelated to her working conditions. Beginning on October 23, 2012, she was forced to “remain at\n\nthe abandoned [OCME] Office” building – i.e., her former duty station prior to the relocation –\n\nwhile the rest of the OCME workforce departed for the new facility. See id., ¶ 24. She remained\n\nworking there, alone, until January 3, 2013, when she received a proposed letter of termination\n\nfrom her employer. See id., ¶¶ 24, 57. More on that later. During that time, the facility lacked\n\n“adequate heat” and afforded her inadequate access to her office and the bathroom, given what\n\nshe claims was her “known disability-- difficulty of traversing stairs.” Id., ¶ 24. The problem,\n\naccording to Plaintiff, was that the “elevators were largely inoperable[,] which meant that [she]\n\nhad to climb the stairs to get to her office on the second floor.” Id., ¶ 55. Furthermore, because\n\nthe “bathroom facilities on the second floor were disabled because the ceiling in the bathroom\n\nhad fallen,” Plaintiff was forced “to make the difficult climb up and down two flights of stairs\n\njust to use the bathroom.” Id., ¶ 56.\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f        She also alleges that certain city employees retaliated against her, at times in rather odd\n\nways. One grievance is that OCME’s Chief of Staff, Beverly Fields, directed her executive\n\nassistant to “stealthily and surreptitiously enter the suite occupied by Ms. Lewis without\n\nidentifying herself,” ostensibly to either scare or intimidate Plaintiff. Id., ¶¶ 58, 59. These\n\nspectral visitations apparently happened “on several occasions.” Id. In one instance, Lewis\n\n“heard noises and shouted out for the individual to identify himself or herself.” Id. The\n\nassistant, who was apparently “hiding in the supply room next to [Plaintiff’s] office space, came\n\nout and said to [Plaintiff], ‘While you’re calling out for someone to identify themselves you\n\ncould already be dead.’” Id. The assistant then left. Id.\n\n        She also complains of harm to her reputation. Specifically, she asserts that an OCME\n\nemployee posted Plaintiff’s picture at a guard station at the new laboratory with a caption\n\nindicating that she had “fail[ed] the background check,” even though she had simply refused to\n\nsubmit to one. Id., ¶¶ 24, 60.\n\n        Finally – and perhaps most importantly – Lewis claims that the city fired her because of\n\nher refusal to undergo the background checks and her decision to “speak[] up and protest[]” the\n\nbackground-check requirement. Id., ¶¶ 5, 25, 98. The District issued its proposed letter of\n\ntermination on January 3, 2013, see id., ¶ 57, and terminated her on April 9. See id., ¶ 5. (The\n\nComplaint leaves unexplained what Plaintiff was doing or where she was working between\n\nJanuary 3, 2013, and her eventual termination, but she appears to concede that she no longer\n\nwent to work in the abandoned office building after receiving the proposed-termination letter.\n\nSee id., ¶ 24).\n\n        She then brought this 10-count suit against the District, certain officials, and various city\n\nemployees, alleging violations of: (1) the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fConstitution (Counts IX, II, and V); (2) various federal and state civil-rights statutes, including\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act, and the D.C. Human Rights Act (Counts III, VII, VIII, and IV); and (3)\n\nstate law prohibiting wrongful termination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and\n\ndefamation (Counts I, VI, and X). Certain Defendants – comprising the District, former Mayor\n\nGray, and Beverly Fields – now move to dismiss. (Other Defendants subsequently filed separate\n\nmotions, which the Court does not address here.)\n\nII.    Legal Standard\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) provides for the dismissal of an action where a\n\ncomplaint fails “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” In evaluating Defendants’\n\nMotion to Dismiss, the Court must “treat the complaint's factual allegations as true . . . and must\n\ngrant plaintiff ‘the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.’” Sparrow\n\nv. United Air Lines, Inc., 216 F.3d 1111, 1113 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Schuler v. United\n\nStates, 617 F.2d 605, 608 (D.C. Cir. 1979)) (citation omitted); see also Jerome Stevens Pharms.,\n\nInc. v. FDA, 402 F.3d 1249, 1250 (D.C. Cir. 2005). The notice-pleading rules are “not meant to\n\nimpose a great burden upon a plaintiff,” Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 347 (2005),\n\nand she must thus be given every favorable inference that may be drawn from the allegations of\n\nfact. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 584 (2007).\n\n       Although “detailed factual allegations” are not necessary to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion, id. at 555, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state\n\na claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)\n\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Plaintiff must put forth “factual content that allows the\n\ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fId. The Court need not accept as true “a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation,” nor an\n\ninference unsupported by the facts set forth in the Complaint. Trudeau v. Fed. Trade Comm’n.,\n\n456 F.3d 178, 193 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). For a plaintiff to survive a 12(b)(6) motion even if\n\n“recovery is very remote and unlikely,” moreover, the facts alleged in the complaint “must be\n\nenough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56\n\n(citing Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974)).\n\n       In evaluating the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court may\n\nconsider “the facts alleged in the complaint, any documents either attached to or incorporated in\n\nthe complaint and matters of which [the court] may take judicial notice.” Equal Emp’t\n\nOpportunity Comm’n v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n\nThe Court may thus consider those materials on a motion to dismiss without treating the motion\n\n“as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d); Marshall v. Honeywell\n\nTech. Solutions, Inc., 536 F. Supp. 2d 59, 65 (D.D.C. 2008).\n\nIII.   Analysis\n\n       As is frequently the case when counsel toss any conceivable claim into the cauldron and\n\ngive it a mighty stir, the Complaint here often looks more like a product of Macbeth’s witches\n\nthan a well-drafted legal pleading. Because the Court has thus been unable to tease out a clear\n\norganizational thread therein, it finds the cleanest way to address Plaintiff’s causes of action –\n\nalbeit out of order – is to begin with her Constitutional claims, proceed to her statutory claims,\n\nand end with her remaining common-law claims.\n\n       Before addressing the merits of those claims, however, the Court will dismiss Plaintiff’s\n\nCount XI for “DECLARATORY and INJUNCTION [sic] RELIEF.” Am. Compl. at 28.\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fRequests for declaratory judgments and injunctions are not “freestanding cause[s] of action” but\n\nrather invoke “form[s] of relief to redress the other claims asserted by Plaintiff.” Base One\n\nTechnologies, Inc. v. Ali, 78 F. Supp. 3d 186, 199 (D.D.C. 2015). Such dismissal does not limit\n\nthe remedies to which Lewis may be entitled, of course, should she succeed on one or more of\n\nher claims. See Thorp v. D.C., No. 15-195, 2015 WL 6769071, at *12 (D.D.C. Nov. 5, 2015).\n\n       A. Constitutional Claims (Counts II, V, and IX)\n\n       Lewis presents three counts that invoke the U.S. Constitution in one form or another.\n\nAlthough she has not specifically so pled, the Court presumes that Plaintiff means to rely on 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, and that she aims to hold the District liable for its actions under Monell v. Dep’t\n\nof Soc. Servs. of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978) (holding that a municipality may be\n\nsued under § 1983 for injuries arising from execution of a government’s policy or custom).\n\nAmong other failings, each count does not contain only one distinct constitutional violation. The\n\nCourt will thus proceed amendment by amendment, rather than count by count, in addressing\n\nPlaintiff’s claims. It ultimately concludes that the causes of action based on the Fourth and First\n\nAmendments will survive, but that those based on the due-process clauses of the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments will not.\n\n               1. Fourth Amendment (Count II)\n\n       The true gravamen of Lewis’s digressive Complaint is her challenge to the drug-testing\n\nrequirement. She asserts that the city’s blanket and mandatory background check for all\n\nlaboratory employees – which included a drug test – is an “unreasonable search” under the\n\nFourth Amendment, see Am. Compl., ¶ 49; Opp. at 7, which protects the “right of the people to\n\nbe secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\n\nseizures. . . .” U.S. Const., Amend. IV. The grist of her dispute is that she and her coworkers\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fwere forced to either submit to an unconstitutional practice – a suspicionless drug test – or face\n\ntermination as a consequence.\n\n       It is helpful to view the claim as a subspecies of the doctrine of “unconstitutional\n\nconditions,” in which the government improperly seeks to “extract[] . . . consent” for an invalid\n\nsearch “through a threatened withholding of a benefit,” like public employment. Dubbs v. Head\n\nStart, Inc., 336 F.3d 1194, 1214 (10th Cir. 2003); accord United States v. Scott, 450 F.3d 863,\n\n868 (9th Cir. 2006) (“Government employees . . . do not waive their Fourth Amendment rights\n\nsimply by accepting a government job; searches of government employees must still be\n\nreasonable.”); Burka v. New York City Transit Auth., 747 F. Supp. 214, 223 (S.D.N.Y. 1990)\n\n(concluding that city employees fired for refusing to submit to unconstitutional drug tests were\n\nentitled to seek compensation and correction of employment records).\n\n       In considering the Fourth Amendment question, the Court begins with the obvious: “For\n\nthe most part, [the Supreme Court has] required that a search be based upon probable cause.”\n\nO’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709, 722 (1987). But in the context of a government employer’s\n\nsearch of an employee where that “search is not used to gather evidence of a criminal offense,”\n\nthe Court has concluded that probable cause is not required. Id. at 724-25. The search, rather,\n\nmust be judged against the standard of “reasonableness under all the circumstances,” id. at 725-\n\n26, which typically means that it “must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.”\n\nChandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 313 (1997).\n\n       In certain limited circumstances, however, “where the privacy interests implicated by the\n\nsearch are minimal, and where an important governmental interest furthered by the intrusion\n\nwould be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion, a search may be\n\nreasonable despite the absence of such suspicion.” Id. at 314 (internal quotation marks and\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fcitation omitted); see Nat’l Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 668 (1989)\n\n(holding that subset of U.S. Customs Service employees may be required to submit to\n\nmandatory, suspicionless drug tests).\n\n       Here, the government does not dispute that the drug test is a Fourth Amendment search,\n\nnor does it argue that Lewis’s privacy interests are diminished for any reason apart from her\n\nposition. Defendants instead emphasize that certain interests pertaining to the city’s\n\nmanagement of the laboratory and its multi-agency workforce justify recourse to blanket drug\n\ntesting. See Mot. at 11.\n\n       In so doing, the District relies on an amorphous bucket of cases bearing the “special\n\nneeds” moniker, wherein warrantless or suspicionless searches may be justified where the\n\ngovernment’s interests lie “‘beyond the normal need for law enforcement’” and when “‘it is\n\nimpractical to require a warrant or some level of individualized suspicion in the particular\n\ncontext.’” Stigile v. Clinton, 110 F.3d 801, 808 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (quoting Von Raab, 489 U.S. at\n\n665-66). In particular, Defendants argue, a suspicionless testing program is justified here\n\nbecause of the city’s overall interest in “maintaining a secure [laboratory] facility” and\n\n“reduc[ing] or eliminat[ing] any fraud, waste, and abuse of individuals who have a duty station\n\n[there],” as well as the Department of Forensic Science’s specific interest, mandated by Mayoral\n\nOrder, in “safeguard[ing] evidence and samples in [DFS’s] custody.” Mot. at 11.\n\n       There can be no doubt that the city intends its drug test to “‘serve[] special governmental\n\nneeds, beyond the normal need for law enforcement,’” Stigile, 110 F.3d at 808 (quoting Skinner\n\nv. Ry. Labor Executives’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 619 (1989)), because the stated goal is to make\n\nthe facility and its assets more secure by ensuring its workforce is free from substance abuse.\n\nThe dispositive question, then, is whether the city’s search is reasonable, which “is determined\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fby balancing ‘the public interest in the . . . testing program against the privacy concerns\n\nimplicated by the tests, without reference to [the] usual presumption in favor of the procedures\n\nspecified in the Warrant Clause.’” Id. at 803 (quoting Von Raab, 489 U.S. at 679).\n\n          As a preliminary observation, the city has an undeniable interest in eliminating “fraud,\n\nwaste and abuse” among all of its employees, whether they work in the laboratory or not. See,\n\ne.g., D.C. Code § 1–615.51 (establishing protections for whistleblowers who “report waste,\n\nfraud, abuse of authority, violations of law, or threats to public health or safety”). Because\n\nDefendants have not, at this stage of the proceedings, had an opportunity to make clear how the\n\ncity’s general interest in curbing corruption applies with particularity to individuals stationed at\n\nthe laboratory, the Court cannot now find this interest sufficient to justify a “special needs”\n\nsearch.\n\n          As for the remaining interests – maintaining a secure facility (generally) and safeguarding\n\nevidence and samples in the custody of DFS (specifically) – those, too, furnish an inadequate\n\nbasis at this stage to render Plaintiff’s claim deficient as a matter of law. For one thing, the city\n\nhas not yet explained why those interests justify compulsory drug testing for all employees\n\nstationed at the laboratory, regardless of which agency they work in, what position they occupy,\n\nor what level of access they have within the facility. See Harmon v. Thornburgh, 878 F.2d 484,\n\n490 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (“[T]he government may search its employees only where a clear, direct\n\nnexus exists between the nature of the employee’s duty and the nature of the feared violation.”).\n\nAlthough facts submitted on summary judgment may well reveal this justification to be sound,\n\nthe Court cannot say at this point that Defendants’ “proffered special need for drug testing” is so\n\npatently “substantial—important enough to override the individual’s . . . privacy interest [and]\n\nsufficiently vital to suppress the Fourth Amendment’s normal requirement of individualized\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fsuspicion.” Chandler, 520 U.S. at 318 (1997); see also Douglas v. New York State Adirondack\n\nPark Agency, 895 F. Supp. 2d 321, 352 (N.D.N.Y. 2012) (concluding that the special-needs\n\ndoctrine’s “fact-specific analysis is [more] appropriately decided on a motion for summary\n\njudgment”).\n\n        To the extent, furthermore, that the city means to suggest that drug testing is justified\n\nsimply because an individual works in a facility that also houses evidence from ongoing\n\ninvestigations, the opinion of Romaguera v. Gegenheimer, No. 91-4469, 1996 WL 229836 (E.D.\n\nLa. May 3, 1996), is instructive. In that case, several employees of a state district court in\n\nJefferson Parish, Louisiana, challenged a random drug-testing policy instituted by the local clerk\n\nof court. See id. at *1. The clerk insisted that drug testing was appropriate for, among other\n\npositions, the court’s criminal- and civil-minute clerks because they might have “access” to\n\ncertain evidence used during court proceedings, including drugs. See id. at *16. After a trial on\n\nthe merits, the federal court concluded that even though minute clerks are often in close\n\nproximity to drugs, “at no time [are drugs] left in these employee’s [sic] unsupervised\n\npossession,” thus rendering the “feared harm” – that the “clerks will remove the evidence from\n\nthe courtroom in plain view of all other persons present [ – ] improbable and remote.” Id. The\n\ngovernment’s invocation of special needs as to those employees, therefore, was not justified,\n\neven if the test was permissible as to others. See id.; accord Jakubowicz v. Dittemore, No. 05-\n\n4135, 2006 WL 2623210, at *7 (W.D. Mo. Sept. 12, 2006) (enjoining drug testing of certain\n\nemployees working in mental-health centers in part because “[t]here [was] no evidence that the\n\nPlaintiffs work in secure areas of the facilities . . . . no[r] evidence that these Plaintiffs have\n\ndirect responsibility for patient care”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   11\n\f       Defendants’ appeal to Stigile is also inapposite at this stage. In that case, the D.C. Circuit\n\nreversed a district court’s decision, made after an expedited Rule 65(a) trial, that random drug\n\ntests of Office of Management and Budget employees that either had offices in or permanent\n\naccess to areas “within the White House security perimeter” were not reasonable under the\n\nFourth Amendment. See 110 F.3d at 802. In reaching its conclusion, the D.C. Circuit held that\n\nthe government’s interest – protecting the safety of the President and Vice President, who were\n\n“frequently” on the grounds or in the same building as those employees – was “substantial.” Id.\n\nat 802, 806. Unlike here, the employees challenging the drug tests did not argue that they could\n\nor should be segregated from areas of the White House grounds in such a way as to render drug\n\ntests unnecessary. See id. at 806-07 (noting that only “permanent passholders” were required to\n\nundergo drug testing, unlike “non-permanent passholders” like interns, reporters, and\n\ncontractors, who had more limited access to the facilities). In contrast, Plaintiff has argued quite\n\nclearly that the drug-testing program was capable of being more “narrowly tailored.” Opp. at 7;\n\nsee id. at 9 n.3 (suggesting that “[i]t is disingenusous for defendants to assert that within the\n\nCFL, there would not be different levels of security and areas of restricted access, e.g.,\n\nlaboratories, storage facilities, and file rooms such that Ms. Lewis, as a Human Resources\n\nadvisor would be prohibited from entering”). The government has not responded to this\n\nassertion – likely because it cannot without citing materials outside the pleadings – and it is not\n\nobvious to the Court that Plaintiff’s intuition here is off the mark. The Court will thus deny\n\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss Lewis’s challenge to the drug-testing policy, at least as it was\n\napplied to her.\n\n       Given Plaintiff’s disjointed approach to pleading, however, a couple of additional loose\n\nends must be tied up. First is that, in addition to her challenge to the drug-testing policy as\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fapplied to her specifically, she also seeks injunctive relief prohibiting application of the policy to\n\nall employees with duty stations in the consolidated laboratory, see Am. Compl., at 29, ¶ 4, or at\n\nleast to all employees “who are not in a ‘high-risk, safety-sensitive job.’” Opp. at 11. As this\n\nremedial request “reach[es] beyond [Plaintiff’s] particular circumstances,” Lewis must either be\n\nbringing suit on behalf of others (which she is not) or she must satisfy the Supreme Court’s\n\n“standards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.” John Doe No. 1 v. Reed, 561 U.S.\n\n186, 194 (2010). To accomplish the latter, she must show “that no set of circumstances exists\n\nunder which [the Mayor’s policy] would be valid” as to at least the subset of employees who are\n\nnot designated as occupying high-risk or safety-sensitive positions. See United States v. Stevens,\n\n559 U.S. 460, 472 (2010). This she cannot do, in no small part because her Complaint is bereft\n\nof any definition of the categorical distinction between “high risk” and “low risk” positions she\n\nseeks to make. Without an understanding of how far the relief she seeks would extend, the Court\n\ncannot say that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that no set of circumstances exists in which non-\n\nhigh-risk or non-safety-sensitive personnel might reasonably be subject to suspicionless\n\nsearches. See Cook v. City of Bell Gardens, No. 13-2030, 2015 WL 2342412, at *11 (C.D. Cal.\n\nMay 11, 2015) (dismissing facial constitutional challenge where “Plaintiff has not even\n\nattempted to allege that no set of circumstances exist in which the enforcement of [a city’s\n\nbuilding code] could be lawful”).\n\n       The second loose end is that Lewis attacks other non-drug-test elements of the\n\nbackground check as violating the Fourth Amendment, including criminal-background checks\n\nand what she calls “medical background check[s].” Opp. at 7; see Am. Compl. at 29, ¶ 1. She\n\nall but abandons her objection to the former in her Opposition, and rightfully so, as Plaintiff has\n\nidentified no privacy interest implicated by using her name to search databases of criminal\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\frecords. See United States v. Villagrana-Flores, 467 F.3d 1269, 1277 n.4 (10th Cir. 2006)\n\n(“[T]he Fourth Amendment is not implicated simply because a name, legally obtained, is later\n\nused to run a criminal background check. That action is neither a search nor a seizure, for there\n\nis no legitimate expectation of privacy in one’s criminal history.”). Any such objection thus may\n\nnot proceed.\n\n        As to the medical-background check, Plaintiff objects to the policy of requiring\n\nemployees to “execute a Notification of a Drug and Alcohol Testing Form, which . . . .\n\nrequire[s] . . . disclos[ure of] any current medications.” Am. Compl., ¶ 22. This policy appears\n\ninextricably linked to the drug-testing policy itself, and because that challenge survives, the\n\nCourt will not dismiss her related challenge to the prescription-drug-disclosure requirement at\n\nthis stage.\n\n               2. First Amendment (Count IX)\n\n        Plaintiff’s First Amendment claim is that she suffered certain harms – being forced to\n\nendure unpleasant employment conditions and ultimately termination – that were inflicted in\n\nretaliation for engaging in speech protected by the First Amendment. That speech, she alleges,\n\nconsists of protesting that the city’s blanket drug-testing policy was substantively\n\nunconstitutional and that it was imposed without adequate process. See Am. Compl., ¶ 97.\n\n        “A public employer may not discharge an employee on a basis that infringes that\n\nemployee’s constitutionally protected interest in freedom of speech.” LeFande v. D.C., 613 F.3d\n\n1155, 1158 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citation and quotation marks omitted). To determine whether such\n\na violation has come to pass, the D.C. Circuit uses a four-part inquiry:\n\n               “First, the public employee must have spoken as a citizen on a matter\n               of public concern. Second, the court must consider whether the\n               governmental interest in promoting the efficiency of the public\n               services it performs through its employees outweighs the\n\n                                                 14\n\f               employee’s interest, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of\n               public concern. Third, the employee must show that [his] speech\n               was a substantial or motivating factor in prompting the retaliatory or\n               punitive act. Finally, the employee must refute the government\n               employer’s showing, if made, that it would have reached the same\n               decision in the absence of the protected speech.”\n\nBowie v. Maddox, 642 F.3d 1122, 1133 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Wilburn v. Robinson, 480\n\nF.3d 1140, 1149 (D.C. Cir. 2007)). “The first two inquiries are questions of law, while the last\n\ntwo are questions of fact usually left to the jury.” Thompson, 428 F.3d at 286. At the pleading\n\nstage, however, the Complaint must still “allege[] sufficient facts for a jury to conclude” that\n\neach factor has been satisfied, see id., giving Plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\n\nSee Sparrow, 216 F.3d at 1113.\n\n       The first prong of the D.C. Circuit’s test “really imposes two requirements – that the\n\nemployee speak ‘as a citizen’ and that the speech be ‘on a matter of public concern.’” Hawkins\n\nv. D.C., 923 F. Supp. 2d 128, 137 (D.D.C. 2013). The “matter of public concern” requirement\n\nshould be addressed first because “[i]f the speech is not on a matter of public concern, ‘the\n\nemployee has no First Amendment cause of action based on his or her employer’s reaction.’”\n\nLeFande, 613 F.3d at 1159) (quoting Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 418 (2006)).\n\n       The city argues that Lewis’s protestations did not tackle matters of public concern,\n\ncharacterizing them as mere “workplace grievance[s]” consisting of a “refusal to comply with\n\nthe Mayor’s Order . . . .” Mot. at 7. But the D.C. Circuit has refuted “the proposition that a\n\npersonnel matter per se cannot be a matter of public concern.” LeFande, 613 F.3d at 1161.\n\nRather, speech “relates to a matter of public concern if it is ‘of political, social, or other concern\n\nto the community.’” Id. at 1159 (quoting Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 146 (1983)). As an\n\nexample, were the head of a city department “to assert the power to fire, without process, all [its\n\nsubordinate] officers, paid and unpaid, that action would ‘be fairly considered as relating to [a]\n\n                                                  15\n\fmatter of political, social, or other concern to the community’ . . . although it relates to a\n\n‘personnel matter.’” Id. at 1161.\n\n       Although she may not have been acting as a latter-day Dorothy Day, it is clear that\n\nPlaintiff’s objections to the city’s drug-testing policy were not so myopic in focus as to be only\n\napplicable to her as an individual. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 23, 24. Lewis states that her written\n\ncorrespondence with the city attorney questioned whether the policy should be applied across the\n\nboard or if it might be more narrowly tailored to exclude “positions” that were designated as\n\n“non-sensitive.” Id., ¶ 23. It is thus quite different from an employee who merely protests that,\n\nfor reasons specific to her, she should not be subject to drug testing. See Durand v. D.C., 38 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 119, 126 (D.D.C. 2014) (police officer’s emails up the chain of command constituted a\n\n“specific personnel grievance” as he was simply “objecting to the manner in which disciplinary\n\nproceedings against him were conducted”); Hultquist v. Hartman, No. 94-424, 1995 WL 519979,\n\nat *3 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 30, 1995) (plaintiff’s criticism of employer’s drug-testing policy with\n\nsubordinate employees “during a spirited lunch break” was not made with intent to “spur\n\norganized public interest to protest the policy” but rather “to further a purely personal interest,”\n\nand thus was not matter of public concern). Tellingly, the city has not even attempted to argue\n\nthat a broadside attack on the constitutionality of the city’s drug-testing policy is not a matter of\n\npublic import. Given the facts as alleged, Lewis’s speech touched on matters of public concern.\n\n       The next question is whether she spoke “as a citizen” or, instead, “pursuant to [her]\n\nofficial duties.” Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 421. “[W]hen public employees make statements pursuant\n\nto their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes,\n\nand the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.” Id.\n\n(district attorney did not speak as private citizen when he wrote and filed memorandum that was\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\f“part of what he, as a calendar deputy, was employed to do”). The Court need not dwell here,\n\nhowever, because Defendants have not asserted that Lewis spoke pursuant to her official duties,\n\nsee Mot. at 7-8, nor is it apparent from the face of her Complaint that her job as a human-\n\nresources adviser contemplated that she advance the type of grievance she made here. The Court\n\nwill thus not dismiss her claim on that basis.\n\n       The second prong of the four-part inquiry requires the Court to consider whether the\n\ncity’s “interest in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its\n\nemployees outweighs [Lewis’s] interest, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public\n\nconcern.” Bowie, 642 F.3d at 1133. Perhaps confused as to what “interests” are at stake in this\n\nbalancing act, Defendants here offer that “the District’s interest in promoting the safety and\n\neffectiveness of the [laboratory] would clearly outweigh Plaintiff’s interest.” Mot. at 7. But\n\nwhatever interest the city may have in establishing a drug-test policy, that has no bearing on the\n\nFirst Amendment question here, which is what interest the government has “as an employer in\n\nregulating the speech of its employees,” and whether that interest outweighs Plaintiff’s interest as\n\na citizen “in commenting upon matters of public concern.” Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S.\n\n563, 568 (1968) (emphasis added). “Here, the employer’s side of the Pickering scale is entirely\n\nempty,” Lane v. Franks, 134 S. Ct. 2369, 2381 (2014), and thus the Court will not dismiss\n\nLewis’s claim on this basis.\n\n       Defendants also argue that Lewis fails the third prong, which requires her to plead facts\n\nsufficient to find that the “speech was a substantial or motivating factor in prompting the\n\nretaliatory or punitive act.” Bowie, 642 F.3d at 1133. They argue that there is too great an\n\ninterval between her speech, which allegedly took place in July of 2012, see Am. Compl., ¶¶ 23-\n\n24, and her termination, which occurred in April 2013. See id., ¶ 20; Mot. at 8. Even if they are\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fright, they calculated the time elapsed based only on Plaintiff’s date of termination. Their\n\nMotion thus completely ignores her allegations that the retaliation comprised “a campaign” of\n\nactions including but not limited to her firing. See id., ¶ 24. Some of those steps took place at\n\nleast as early as October 2012, when Plaintiff alleges she was forced to remain in her office alone\n\nand without heat. See id., ¶ 24. Others, like the posting of her photograph at the guard booth,\n\nmay have taken place earlier than that. Having not disputed that these other incidents may also\n\nconstitute “adverse actions” in the First Amendment context, see Tao v. Freeh, 27 F.3d 635, 639\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1994), Defendants are wrong to assert that the Complaint fails to plausibly allege\n\ncausation between her speech and the city’s retaliatory conduct.\n\n       Finally, Defendants make no argument on the fourth prong, which is not, in any case,\n\nappropriately decided on a motion to dismiss. The Court will thus not dismiss Plaintiff’s First\n\nAmendment claim at this stage.\n\n               3. Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments (Also Count II)\n\n       Plaintiff also alleges (in the same count as her Fourth Amendment claim) that Defendants\n\ndenied her “Right of Due Process” guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. See Am. Compl.,\n\n¶ 49; see also id., ¶¶ 4, 28, 65, 68, 71. As a preliminary matter, Defendants correctly point out\n\nthat she invoked the wrong constitutional amendment, since it is the Fifth Amendment, and not\n\nthe Fourteenth, that applies to the District of Columbia and its employees. See Butera v. D.C.,\n\n235 F.3d 637, 646 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (citing Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954)). For\n\nthat reason alone, the District asks that all due-process claims be dismissed. See Mot. at 13.\n\nWhile the Court is not predisposed to leniency as Plaintiff’s Complaint leaves much to be\n\ndesired, Defendants were given “fair notice” that she intended to invoke those due-process\n\nprotections that were applicable to the District – viz., in the Fifth Amendment – which is “all that\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\fis required in this instance to withstand a motion to dismiss.” Jones v. D.C., 273 F. Supp. 2d 61,\n\n65 (D.D.C. 2003).\n\n       Even giving Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt on that front, however, she never provides\n\nfair notice of what she means when she invokes “due process” in her Complaint. And, as a\n\nconsequence, she offers no plausible basis for stating a Fifth Amendment claim. As far as the\n\nCourt can tell, Plaintiff appears to allege only varieties of procedural due-process violations.\n\nGiven the prolixity of Plaintiff’s Complaint, it is, of course, possible that, buried deep therein,\n\nshe dropped clues that, if properly assembled, would allege a deprivation of substantive due\n\nprocess. Yet “‘[o]nly the most egregious official conduct’ rises to the level of a substantive due\n\nprocess violation.” Yates v. D.C., 324 F.3d 724, 725 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting County of\n\nSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998)). The facts alleged here come nowhere close to\n\nmeeting this high standard.\n\n       Returning to procedural due process, the Complaint similarly fails to state a claim that\n\ncan survive a motion to dismiss. “Procedural due process imposes constraints on governmental\n\ndecisions which deprive individuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests within the meaning of the\n\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.” Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S.\n\n319, 332 (1976). To the extent that a constitutionally protected “liberty” or “property” interest is\n\nplaced at risk of deprivation, the government must provide “such procedural protections as the\n\nparticular situation demands.” Id. at 334 (quoting Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481\n\n(1972)).\n\n       Plaintiff’s Complaint does not satisfy the key components of this standard. In many\n\nparagraphs, she alleges the inadequacy of certain procedural protections but without ever\n\nidentifying any deprivation of a recognized liberty or property interest. See Am. Compl., ¶ 23\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f(suggesting the “ultimatum” she was given by the city attorney to consent to the drug test or risk\n\ntermination violated her “due process right to fair notice”); id., ¶ 28 (same), id., ¶ 41 (arguing\n\nthat “threaten[ing] to take away [her] paramount property interest in her civil servant job is per se\n\na violation of due process”) (emphasis added); id., ¶ 65 (same). Lewis offers no legal basis for\n\nconcluding that she has a constitutionally protected interest in being free from a threatened\n\ntermination, and, indeed, the Court knows of no such case to so hold.\n\n       In other paragraphs, Plaintiff identifies at least some plausible constitutionally protected\n\ninterests that were infringed upon – e.g., her public employment and her reputation. See Am.\n\nCompl., ¶ 95 (alleging that “Defendants’ actions and conduct have caused . . . loss of\n\nreputation”); see also id., ¶¶ 71-73. But even if these interests are constitutionally protected,\n\nPlaintiff offers absolutely no detail as to what procedures she was owed to avoid such harms.\n\nSee, e.g., id., ¶ 43 (alleging that she was terminated “without . . . any proper and reasonable\n\nprocedure”). “Because it is devoid of allegations as to the actual process purportedly denied\n\n[Plaintiff], the Amended Complaint does not raise [her] procedural due process claim ‘above the\n\nspeculative level’ to the realm of plausibility.” McManus v. D.C., 530 F. Supp. 2d 46, 73\n\n(D.D.C. 2007) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp., 550 U.S. at 555). Her due-process claims will thus be\n\ndismissed.\n\n               4. “Wrongful Termination and Retaliation in Violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983”\n                  (Count V)\n\n       The Court will also dismiss Count V, entitled “Wrongful Termination and Retaliation in\n\nViolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983,” which does not state a claim distinct from the three\n\nconstitutional ones discussed above. Having done the work to align Plaintiff’s pleadings into\n\ncogent constitutional claims, the Court concludes that all of the allegations contained within\n\nCount V are purely repetitive of the others. As a reminder: § 1983 already serves as the statutory\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fbasis for Plaintiff’s constitutional claims, and it “is not itself a source of substantive rights, but\n\nmerely provides a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.” Albright v.\n\nOliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271 (1994) (quoting Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 144 n. 3 (1979)).\n\nThis count cannot proceed.\n\n        B. Federal and State Statutory Claims\n\n        Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants violated various and sundry federal and state\n\nstatutes that prohibit discrimination or retaliation in some form or another. All but one of these\n\nstatutory claims fail.\n\n                1. Title VII Discrimination (Count III)\n\n        The Complaint first asserts without any factual basis that the city discriminated against\n\nPlaintiff on the basis of her race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See\n\nAm. Compl., ¶ 55. She appears, however, to have abandoned this claim in her Opposition, see\n\nOpp. at 17, and the Court will thus grant Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss this count. See Hopkins\n\nv. Women’s Div., Gen. Bd. of Glob. Ministries, 284 F. Supp. 2d 15, 25 (D.D.C. 2003) (“It is\n\nwell understood in this Circuit that when a plaintiff files an opposition to a dispositive motion\n\nand addresses only certain arguments raised by the defendant, a court may treat those arguments\n\nthat the plaintiff failed to address as conceded.”); accord Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons v.\n\nSebelius, 746 F.3d 468, 471 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (affirming district court’s decision to “infer[]\n\nconcession from gaps in a plaintiff’s opposition to a motion to dismiss”).\n\n                2. Americans with Disabilities Act (Count VIII)\n\n        Continuing her pattern of advancing numerous causes of action in a single count, Plaintiff\n\nnext alleges several distinct ADA violations against Defendants in Count VIII. The first claims\n\nthat the city made an improper medical inquiry, which is prohibited under the ADA except under\n\n\n\n                                                   21\n\fcertain circumstances. The second asserts that the District discriminated against her on the basis\n\nof her disability. Finally, in her Opposition, she seeks to add a third ground for relief –\n\nretaliation. All but the first proceed no farther.\n\n                              Improper Medical Inquiry\n\n       Plaintiff’s primary allegation is that the ADA prohibited the District from requiring her to\n\nboth submit to a drug test and to fill out the “Notification of [] Drug and Alcohol Testing Form,”\n\nwhich allegedly demanded that Plaintiff disclose “any current medications.” Am. Compl., ¶¶ 21,\n\n22. Such demands, she claims, are barred under the ADA.\n\n       In addition to prohibiting discrimination and retaliation on the basis of an employee’s\n\ndisability, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112, 12203, the ADA also places restrictions on an\n\nemployer’s ability to make medically related inquiries of its employees, whether they suffer from\n\na disability or not. Section 12112(d)(4)(A) provides that a covered employer\n\n               shall not require a medical examination and shall not make inquiries\n               of an employee as to whether such employee is an individual with a\n               disability . . . unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-\n               related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nDespite the apparent breadth of that provision, the statute elsewhere clarifies that “a test to\n\ndetermine the illegal use of drugs shall not be considered a medical examination,” id. §\n\n12114(d)(1), although it includes a disclaimer that “[n]othing in this subchapter shall be\n\nconstrued to encourage, prohibit, or authorize the conducting of drug testing for the illegal use of\n\ndrugs by job applicants or employees or making employment decisions based on such test\n\nresults.” Id. § 12114(d)(2); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.16(c).\n\n       In responding to Plaintiff’s allegations, Defendants argue primarily that “a drug test is not\n\na medical examination” under § 12114(d)(1), and that Plaintiff’s ADA claim thus fails as a\n\nmatter of law. See Mot. at 22. Defendants may be right on that first narrow point. But see\n\n\n                                                     22\n\fE.E.O.C. v. Grane Healthcare Co., No. 10-250, 2015 WL 5439052, at *39 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 15,\n\n2015) (explaining that, under certain conditions, a drug test may be an improper “medical\n\nexamination” under § 12112(d)(4)). But they conveniently ignore Plaintiff’s other allegation –\n\nthat the District impermissibly required her to disclose her prescription-drug regimen. Without\n\ndeveloped argumentation from the District on this point, and considering that other courts have\n\nfound factually similar inquiries to be prohibited by the ADA, the Court concludes that this\n\nallegation is sufficient to allow her claim to proceed at this stage. See, e.g., Bates v. Dura Auto.\n\nSys., Inc., 767 F.3d 566, 578 (6th Cir. 2014) (“‘Obviously, asking an employee whether he is\n\ntaking prescription drugs or medication, or questions seek[ing] information about illnesses,\n\nmental conditions, or other impairments [an employee] has or had in the past [,] trigger the\n\nADA’s . . . protections.’”) (quoting Lee v. City of Columbus, 636 F.3d 245, 254 (6th Cir. 2011);\n\nRoe v. Cheyenne Mountain Conference Resort, Inc., 124 F.3d 1221, 1226 (10th Cir. 1997)\n\n(same); accord EEOC, Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical\n\nExaminations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Part B.1 (July\n\n27, 2000) (“Disability-related inquiries may include . . . asking an employee whether s/he\n\ncurrently is taking any prescription drugs or medications . . . .”) available at:\n\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/guidance-inquiries.html.\n\n       Defendants also argue that all Plaintiff’s ADA claims fail because she has not pled a\n\ncovered disability. While the Court agrees that “difficulty of traversing stairs” almost certainly\n\ndoes not qualify as a disability under the ADA, see Am. Compl., ¶ 24, the medical-inquiry\n\nprovisions of the statute “protect[] all employees from medical inquiries, regardless of whether\n\nthey have a qualifying disability.” Bates, 767 F.3d at 573. Lewis’s improper-inquiry claim\n\nunder Count VIII thus survives.\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f                              Disability Discrimination\n\n       Like her race-discrimination count, Plaintiff has vaguely pleaded but subsequently\n\nabandoned a claim that she was discriminated against on the basis of a disability. Compare Am.\n\nCompl., ¶ 85-86 with Opp. at 17. To the extent Count VIII contains a cause of action for\n\ndisability discrimination, it will not proceed.\n\n                              Retaliation\n\n       In her Opposition, Plaintiff also attempts to plead that she was retaliated against for\n\nprotesting the drug test. See Opp. at 17. But because that claim is newly presented, the Court\n\nwill not address it here. See, e.g., Kingman Park Civic Ass’n v. Gray, 27 F. Supp. 3d 142, 160\n\nn.7 (D.D.C. 2014) (“It is well settled law that a plaintiff cannot amend his or her complaint by\n\nthe briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.”). Nor will the Court treat her request for “leave\n\nto amend” her Complaint as a properly filed motion under Rule 15(a). See Opp. at 17; Rollins v.\n\nWackenhut Servs., Inc., 703 F.3d 122, 130 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (“[A] bare request in an opposition\n\nto a motion to dismiss – without any indication of the particular grounds on which amendment is\n\nsought – does not constitute a motion within the contemplation of Rule 15(a).”) (citation and\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n               3. Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (Count VII)\n\n       Next up is Plaintiff’s novel gambit of alleging discrimination under the Genetic\n\nInformation Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000ff et seq., which\n\nprohibits discrimination on the basis of an employee’s “genetic information.” See id. § 2000ff-\n\n1(a). In some ways similar to the ADA, GINA prohibits an employer from “request[ing],\n\nrequir[ing], or purchas[ing] genetic information with respect to an employee,” id. § 2000ff-1(b)\n\n(emphasis added), subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. Lewis alleges that the\n\nmandatory drug test constituted such an improper request. See Am. Compl., ¶ 78-80. As\n\n                                                  24\n\fDefendants point out, however, nothing in the Complaint suggests that, through its drug-test\n\npolicy, the District requested genetic information as that phrase is defined by statute. See\n\n§ 2000ff(4) (“The term ‘genetic information’ means, with respect to any individual, information\n\nabout--(i) such individual’s genetic tests, (ii) the genetic tests of family members of such\n\nindividual, and (iii) the manifestation of a disease or disorder in family members of such\n\nindividual.”); 29 C.F.R. § 1635.3(c). EEOC implementing regulations make clear, furthermore,\n\nthat “[a] test for the presence of alcohol or illegal drugs is not a genetic test,” 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1635.3(f)(4)(i), meaning that a request for such a test similarly does not constitute a request for\n\ngenetic information under EEOC rules. This brave-new-world count ends here.\n\n                4. D.C. Human Rights Act (Count IV)\n\n        Plaintiff’s final statutory claim is that the District retaliated against her in violation of the\n\nD.C. Human Rights Act. Although the Complaint clearly identifies what Plaintiff believes\n\nconstitutes the retaliation – her exile in the abandoned building and her eventual termination, see\n\nAm. Compl., ¶ 69 – she never alleges that she took any action covered by the statute that\n\nprompted her employer to react improperly. For that reason, her claim will not continue beyond\n\nthe pleading stage.\n\n        The DCHRA proscribes discriminatory employment practices based on an employee’s\n\n“race, color, religion, . . . disability . . . or political affiliation,” among other things, D.C.Code §\n\n2–1402.11(a)(1), and also prohibits retaliating against an employee “on account of having\n\nexercised or enjoyed . . . any right granted or protected under this chapter.” Id. § 2–1402.61(a);\n\nsee McCaskill v. Gallaudet Univ., 36 F. Supp. 3d 145, 154 (D.D.C. 2014). A DCHRA retaliation\n\nclaim effectively mirrors such a claim “under the federal employment discrimination laws.”\n\nMcCain v. CCA of Tenn., Inc., 254 F. Supp. 2d 115, 124 (D.D.C. 2003). Thus, “to prove\n\n\n\n                                                   25\n\funlawful retaliation, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she engaged in [a statutorily protected\n\nactivity]; (2) the employer took an adverse employment action against her; and (3) the adverse\n\naction was causally related to the exercise of her rights.” McCaskill, 36 F. Supp. 3d at 154\n\n(citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In Lewis’s case, she has not plausibly alleged that she participated in any “statutorily\n\nprotected activity.” Id. She alleges only that she “rightfully objected” to the District’s drug-\n\ntesting policy and consent form, see Am. Compl., ¶ 65, but nowhere in her Opposition does she\n\nexplain how such actions constitute protected activity under the DCHRA. To be sure, the\n\nstatute’s language offers little guidance in determining what types of activities fall within the\n\nambit of “protected activity.” See McCaskill, 36 F. Supp. 3d at 154. But courts interpreting this\n\nprovision of the DCHRA have emphasized that the law serves primarily to “protect[] employees\n\nwho bring or threaten to bring a discrimination claim against their employer.” Id. (emphasis\n\nadded); see also Vogel v. D.C. Office of Planning, 944 A.2d 456, 464 (D.C. 2008) (“To\n\nconstitute ‘protected activity,’ [an employee’s complaint to the D.C. Office of Human Rights]\n\nmust allege an employment practice that is prohibited by the DCHRA.”). Plaintiff nowhere\n\nalleges that the communications with the city’s lawyer about her objection to a generally\n\napplicable city policy constituted a complaint of discrimination in any manner of speaking, and\n\nthe Court sees no other basis on which Lewis may properly establish a claim of retaliation under\n\nthe DCHRA.\n\n       C. Common-Law Claims\n\n       Plaintiff’s last set of counts involves common-law claims for wrongful termination\n\n(Count I), intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count VI), and defamation (Count X). The\n\nCourt need not address the merits of any of these, as it is clear that Plaintiff should have first\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\fsought administrative redress under the District’s Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act (CMPA)\n\nbefore lodging such claims in court.\n\n        “The CMPA provides a remedy for the majority of employment related conflicts that\n\noccur between the District of Columbia and its employees.” Owens v. D.C., 923 F. Supp. 2d\n\n241, 248 (D.D.C. 2013); see D.C. Code § 1-601.02. The D.C. Court of Appeals views the\n\nCMPA’s breadth expansively and has construed its provisions as creating “a comprehensive\n\nsystem of administrative review of employer actions” that “address[es] virtually every\n\nconceivable personnel issue among the District, its employees, and their unions – with a\n\nreviewing role for the courts as a last resort, not a supplementary role for the courts as an\n\nalternative forum.” D.C. v. Thompson, 593 A.2d 621, 633, 634 (D.C. 1991) (emphasis added).\n\n       Its provisions cover all manner of employee complaints arising out of “performance\n\nratings,” “discipline,” and other grievances. Stockard v. Moss, 706 A.2d 561, 564 (D.C. 1997);\n\nsee also D.C. Code § 1-603.01(10) (defining “grievance” as “any matter under the control of the\n\nDistrict government which impairs or adversely affects the interest, concern, or welfare of\n\nemployees,” excluding removals, suspensions, and other pay or classification-related changes).\n\nThus, if an employee “claims wrongful treatment and injury [that is] cognizable as a ‘personnel\n\nissue’ under the Act’s ‘performance ratings,’ ‘adverse actions,’ and employee ‘grievances’\n\nprovisions,” a common-law claim arising out of those circumstances will be preempted by the\n\nAct. King v. Kidd, 640 A.2d 656, 663 (D.C. 1993) (emphasis added) (quoting D.C. Code §§ 1-\n\n615.1 to -615.5 and §§ 1-617.1 to -617.3); see Washington v. D.C., 538 F. Supp. 2d 269, 279\n\n(D.D.C. 2008) (“When tort claims are predicated upon conduct that may be a proper subject of a\n\ngrievance under the CMPA, the [Act’s] exclusivity principles . . . will preclude litigation\n\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fof . . . [claims such as] emotional distress and defamation prior to exhaustion of administrative\n\nremedies.”) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n       While its provisions are not so expansive as to cover every harmful act occurring in the\n\nworkplace, see, e.g., King, 640 A.2d at 664 (concluding that “discrimination complaints” falling\n\n“within the jurisdiction of the D.C. Office of Human Rights” were expressly excluded by\n\nregulation from the remedial provisions of the CMPA); Stockard, 706 A.2d at 565 n.9 (noting the\n\nDistrict’s concession that assault and battery are not covered by the CMPA), courts have found\n\nits provisions to preclude the types of common-law claims filed against Defendants here. See,\n\ne.g., Stockard, 706 A.2d at 563 (defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress);\n\nLewis v. D.C. Dep’t of Motor Vehicles, 987 A.2d 1134, 1138 (D.C. 2010) (wrongful termination\n\nin violation of public policy); Saint-Jean v. District of Columbia, 846 F. Supp. 2d 247, 264-65\n\n(D.D.C. 2012) (defamation); Payne v. District of Columbia, 592 F. Supp. 2d 29, 38 (D.D.C.\n\n2008) (defamation); but see King, 640 A.2d at 664 (concluding that intentional-infliction-of-\n\nemotional-distress and retaliation claims “premised on” employee’s sexual-harassment complaint\n\nnot preempted by CMPA).\n\n       All of Plaintiff’s common-law causes of action fall within the general category of\n\npersonnel matters redressable under CMPA processes. Her claim that she was wrongfully\n\nterminated, for instance, is precisely the type of complaint that the CMPA was designed to\n\nhandle. See Lewis, 987 A.2d at 1137 (DMV hearing examiner who was fired for refusing to\n\nenforce what he believed was an unconstitutional statute was required to exhaust CMPA\n\nremedies before filing wrongful-termination action in court).\n\n       Her defamation claim is also properly categorized as a “personnel issue” under the\n\nCMPA, as it “arise[s] out of an employment-related dispute.” Alexis v. D.C., 44 F. Supp. 2d\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\f331, 349 (D.D.C. 1999). The link between Plaintiff’s refusal to undertake the drug test and the\n\ninaccurately captioned photograph posted at the laboratory’s guard station is unmistakable.\n\nLewis admittedly refused to take the drug test, and, despite being an employee of OCME, she\n\nwas not permitted to enter the laboratory under the city’s new policy. Whether categorized as a\n\ngrievance or an adverse action under the CMPA, the statute’s administrative procedures afforded\n\nher a clear avenue for seeking relief, which she must pursue before seeking judicial review. See\n\nThompson, 593 A.2d at 635; cf. Hoey v. D.C., 540 F. Supp. 2d 218, 230 (D.D.C. 2008) (noting\n\nthat even defamatory statements made after employee was fired are covered by CMPA).\n\n       Her intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress claim follows suit. The primary injury\n\nshe alleges is the enforcement of what Lewis asserts is an unconstitutional employment policy.\n\nThe Court is unsure how such policy could even plausibly satisfy the substantive standard for an\n\nemotional-distress claim, see Abourezk v. New York Airlines, Inc., 895 F.2d 1456, 1458 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1990) (plaintiff must prove, among other things, “extreme and outrageous” conduct by\n\ndefendants), and, in any event, the actions Lewis complains of are, at bottom, a personnel issue\n\nthat is redressable under the CMPA.\n\n       To the extent Plaintiff premises her cause of action on the purportedly retaliatory\n\nbehavior of Beverly Fields – i.e., by directing individuals to “stealthily and surreptitiously enter”\n\nLewis’s office space, see Am. Compl., ¶ 58 – she has offered no explanation as to why such\n\nactions fall within the “narrow exception[s] to the exclusivity provision of the CMPA.”\n\nRobinson v. D.C., 748 A.2d 409, 411 (D.C. 2000). Even if they did, such conduct does not\n\nplausibly satisfy the “demanding standard” of being “so outrageous in character, and so extreme\n\nin degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and\n\nutterly intolerable in a civilized society.” Heasley v. D.C. Gen. Hosp., 180 F. Supp. 2d 158, 173\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f(D.D.C. 2002) (quoting Bernstein v. Fernandez, 649 A.2d 1064, 1075 (D.C. 1991)). Plaintiff’s\n\nintentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress claim, like her other two common-law claims, will\n\ntherefore be dismissed.\n\n        D. Dismissal of Individual Plaintiffs\n\n        In addition to suing the District, Lewis has also named an array of individual Defendants,\n\nincluding Gray, Tucker, Fields, and Paul Quander, the city’s director of public safety, along with\n\n“Does 1 through 50.” See Am. Compl. at 1. In this Motion, Gray and Fields seek dismissal of\n\nall surviving claims against them, whether in their official or individual capacities. Now that the\n\nCourt has dismissed much of the Complaint, the only surviving count lodged against these two\n\nindividual Defendants is Count II, which is Plaintiff’s § 1983 claim for a violation of her rights\n\nunder the Fourth Amendment. See Section III.A.1, infra. The Court separately considers it as an\n\nofficial-capacity and personal-capacity claim.\n\n                1. Official-Capacity Claim\n\n        While “personal-capacity suits seek to impose personal liability upon a government\n\nofficial for actions he takes under color of state law,” Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-66\n\n(1985), “[o]fficial-capacity suits . . . ‘generally represent only another way of pleading an action\n\nagainst an entity of which an officer is an agent.’” Id. (quoting Monell v. New York City Dept.\n\nof Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690 n.55 (1978)). The D.C. Circuit has thus concluded that\n\n“[a] section 1983 suit for damages against municipal officials in their official capacities is . . .\n\nequivalent to a suit against the municipality itself.” Atchinson v. D.C., 73 F.3d 418, 424 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1996). Because Plaintiff’s § 1983 claim under the Fourth Amendment will proceed against\n\n\n\n\n                                                  30\n\fthe District, the Court will dismiss it as redundant against Gray and Fields in their official\n\ncapacities. See Cooke-Seals v. District of Columbia, 973 F.Supp. 184, 187 (D.D.C. 1997).\n\n               2. Personal-Capacity Claim\n\n        “To state a claim under § 1983 against an official in his individual capacity, a plaintiff\n\nmust plead facts sufficient to allege (1) ‘the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and\n\nthe laws of the United States,’ and (2) ‘that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person\n\nacting under color of state law.’” Ford v. Donovan, 891 F. Supp. 2d 60, 65 (D.D.C. 2012)\n\n(quoting West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988)) (emphasis added).\n\n       As to Fields: The Complaint pleads no facts that any Fourth Amendment deprivation was\n\ncommitted by her. The only specific conduct attributed to her pertains to her alleged\n\ninvolvement in directing a subordinate to surprise Plaintiff in the abandoned office building – a\n\nseries of incidents that has no bearing on Lewis’s Fourth Amendment claim. Fields will thus be\n\ndismissed from the case.\n\n       As to Gray: While a plaintiff may bring suit against a mayor in his individual capacity\n\nunder § 1983, she may do so only by alleging “that the Mayor was directly responsible for the\n\nconstitutional deprivation” or that he gave “‘authorization or approval of such misconduct.’”\n\nEkwem v. Fenty, 666 F. Supp. 2d 71, 76 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Int’l Action Center v. United\n\nStates, 365 F.3d 20, 27 (D.C. Cir. 2004), quoting, in turn, Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 371\n\n(1976)). A key flaw in Plaintiff’s claim against Gray is that, while the Mayor’s Order clearly\n\nprovides the basis for the District’s implementation of a drug-testing policy, neither the Order\n\nnor the facts alleged in the Complaint indicate that the Mayor himself had any role in the\n\ndecision to fire employees who refused to comply with that policy. The Order merely delegates\n\nauthority to the District’s Department of Human Resources to use a variety of means – including\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\f“one or more of the following: background checks, investigations, mandatory criminal\n\nbackground checks, and testing for controlled substance use” – as a way of “provid[ing] for the\n\nsecurity and protection of evidence and samples in [the Department of Forensic Sciences’]\n\ncustody.” Mayor’s Order 2012-84 at 1. It does not require the Human Resources department to\n\nuse drug testing as the chosen means for providing such security, nor does it even state that any\n\nsuch means must necessarily apply to the entire laboratory workforce. Without allegations in her\n\nComplaint to suggest that Gray had any personal role in her ouster, the suit against him cannot\n\nproceed.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For these reasons, the Court will grant Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to Counts I, III-\n\nVII, and X-XI, and as to Defendants Gray and Fields. It will deny Defendants’ Motion as to\n\nCounts II, VIII, and IX. A separate Order so stating will issue this day.\n\n\n\n                                                             /s/ James E.

LEWIS,\n\n          Plaintiff,\n                 v.                                        Civil Action No. 15-521 (JEB)\n GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF\n COLUMBIA, et al.,\n\n          Defendants.\n\n\n                                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Happily ensconced in the District of Columbia’s new Consolidated Forensic Sciences\n\nLaboratory, the city’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) decided that all employees\n\nstationed there had to take a drug test as a condition of continued employment. Plaintiff Patricia\n\nLewis, formerly employed as a human-resources adviser with OCME, balked. Objecting on\n\nprivacy grounds, she refused to take the test and was fired nine months later. She then brought\n\nthis suit against the District, former Mayor Vincent Gray, and a number of its officials.\n\nAlthough the crux of her grievance lies with the drug testing, her Complaint is muddied by a\n\nskein of claims under the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, state statutes, and state common\n\nlaw. A subset of Defendants – the District, former Mayor Gray, and OCME’s Chief of Staff,\n\nBeverly Fields – now moves to dismiss. The Court will grant in part and deny in part their\n\nMotion.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Before her termination in 2013, Lewis held the job of “[Human Resources] Advisor,\n\nManagement Liaison Specialist” in the city’s Office of Chief Medical Examiner. See Am.\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fCompl., ¶ 20. OCME’s duties include autopsies as well as other forensic and medicolegal\n\ninvestigations. See generally D.C. Code Ann. § 5-1401 et seq. When she was hired, OCME was\n\nlocated in an office building on Massachusetts Avenue in Southeast Washington. See id., ¶ 24.\n\nSometime in or before July 2012, the city informed OCME’s workforce that it would be moved\n\nto a new facility: the city’s Consolidated Forensic Sciences Laboratory. See id., ¶ 21. The new\n\nlaboratory, which opened in October 2012, was designed to house under one roof a number of\n\ncity departments, including OCME, the Department of Forensic Sciences, and several divisions\n\nof the Metropolitan Police Department, such as the Firearms and Fingerprint Examination\n\nDivision, the DNA laboratory, and the Forensic Sciences Services Division. See D.C. Council\n\nResolution No. 19-726 § 2(b) (Dec. 4, 2012).\n\n       During a staff meeting on July 18, 2012, an attorney for the city, Charles Tucker,\n\ninformed OCME employees that, as a condition of their ability to relocate to the new laboratory,\n\nand thus to maintain their jobs, they would be required to consent to a set of background checks\n\ndetailed in a 2012 Mayor’s Order. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 21, 22, 28 (citing Mayor’s Order 2012-\n\n84); Def. Mot., Exh. A (Mayor’s Order 2012-84). The Order indicated that the city’s\n\nDepartment of Human Resources possessed the authority to require employees with “a duty\n\nstation” at the new laboratory to submit to some combination of “background checks,\n\ninvestigations, mandatory criminal background checks, and tests for controlled substance use.”\n\nMayor’s Order 2012-84 at 2. Tucker stated that employees had until 4:00 p.m. that day to sign a\n\n“Notification of [] Drug and Alcohol Testing Form,” which also required disclosure of “any\n\ncurrent medications,” or risk being fired. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 21, 22.\n\n       Lewis “immediately protested” both the requirements themselves and the short timeframe\n\nthat employees were given to respond. See id., ¶ 23. She alleges that she made her objections\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fknown “verbally” to an unspecified audience on July 18, 2012, and “in writing” in a letter to\n\nTucker two days later. See id., ¶¶ 23, 24. In the letter, Lewis stated that she was “hired into a\n\nnon-sensitive position that has not been reclassified, nor designated as high risk,” suggesting that\n\ncertain inquiries into her background, like the drug test, were unwarranted. See id., ¶ 23.\n\nPlaintiff received a written response from Tucker on August 30, 2012, which stated definitively\n\nthat, “due to the relocations of your position to the new facility, you will be subject to mandatory\n\ncriminal background checks and testing for controlled substance use in accordance with [M.O.\n\n2012-84].” Id., ¶ 27. According to Lewis, she refused to “submit[] to the background check,”\n\nincluding a drug test. See id., ¶ 24.\n\n       Plaintiff claims that, as a consequence of her refusal to comply with those requirements,\n\nshe suffered repeated mistreatment at the hands of the city and its agents. The first set of wrongs\n\nrelated to her working conditions. Beginning on October 23, 2012, she was forced to “remain at\n\nthe abandoned [OCME] Office” building – i.e., her former duty station prior to the relocation –\n\nwhile the rest of the OCME workforce departed for the new facility. See id., ¶ 24. She remained\n\nworking there, alone, until January 3, 2013, when she received a proposed letter of termination\n\nfrom her employer. See id., ¶¶ 24, 57. More on that later. During that time, the facility lacked\n\n“adequate heat” and afforded her inadequate access to her office and the bathroom, given what\n\nshe claims was her “known disability-- difficulty of traversing stairs.” Id., ¶ 24. The problem,\n\naccording to Plaintiff, was that the “elevators were largely inoperable[,] which meant that [she]\n\nhad to climb the stairs to get to her office on the second floor.” Id., ¶ 55. Furthermore, because\n\nthe “bathroom facilities on the second floor were disabled because the ceiling in the bathroom\n\nhad fallen,” Plaintiff was forced “to make the difficult climb up and down two flights of stairs\n\njust to use the bathroom.” Id., ¶ 56.\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f        She also alleges that certain city employees retaliated against her, at times in rather odd\n\nways. One grievance is that OCME’s Chief of Staff, Beverly Fields, directed her executive\n\nassistant to “stealthily and surreptitiously enter the suite occupied by Ms. Lewis without\n\nidentifying herself,” ostensibly to either scare or intimidate Plaintiff. Id., ¶¶ 58, 59. These\n\nspectral visitations apparently happened “on several occasions.” Id. In one instance, Lewis\n\n“heard noises and shouted out for the individual to identify himself or herself.” Id. The\n\nassistant, who was apparently “hiding in the supply room next to [Plaintiff’s] office space, came\n\nout and said to [Plaintiff], ‘While you’re calling out for someone to identify themselves you\n\ncould already be dead.’” Id. The assistant then left. Id.\n\n        She also complains of harm to her reputation. Specifically, she asserts that an OCME\n\nemployee posted Plaintiff’s picture at a guard station at the new laboratory with a caption\n\nindicating that she had “fail[ed] the background check,” even though she had simply refused to\n\nsubmit to one. Id., ¶¶ 24, 60.\n\n        Finally – and perhaps most importantly – Lewis claims that the city fired her because of\n\nher refusal to undergo the background checks and her decision to “speak[] up and protest[]” the\n\nbackground-check requirement. Id., ¶¶ 5, 25, 98. The District issued its proposed letter of\n\ntermination on January 3, 2013, see id., ¶ 57, and terminated her on April 9. See id., ¶ 5. (The\n\nComplaint leaves unexplained what Plaintiff was doing or where she was working between\n\nJanuary 3, 2013, and her eventual termination, but she appears to concede that she no longer\n\nwent to work in the abandoned office building after receiving the proposed-termination letter.\n\nSee id., ¶ 24).\n\n        She then brought this 10-count suit against the District, certain officials, and various city\n\nemployees, alleging violations of: (1) the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fConstitution (Counts IX, II, and V); (2) various federal and state civil-rights statutes, including\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act, and the D.C. Human Rights Act (Counts III, VII, VIII, and IV); and (3)\n\nstate law prohibiting wrongful termination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and\n\ndefamation (Counts I, VI, and X). Certain Defendants – comprising the District, former Mayor\n\nGray, and Beverly Fields – now move to dismiss. (Other Defendants subsequently filed separate\n\nmotions, which the Court does not address here.)\n\nII.    Legal Standard\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) provides for the dismissal of an action where a\n\ncomplaint fails “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” In evaluating Defendants’\n\nMotion to Dismiss, the Court must “treat the complaint's factual allegations as true . . . and must\n\ngrant plaintiff ‘the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.’” Sparrow\n\nv.

Analysis\n\n       As is frequently the case when counsel toss any conceivable claim into the cauldron and\n\ngive it a mighty stir, the Complaint here often looks more like a product of Macbeth’s witches\n\nthan a well-drafted legal pleading. Because the Court has thus been unable to tease out a clear\n\norganizational thread therein, it finds the cleanest way to address Plaintiff’s causes of action –\n\nalbeit out of order – is to begin with her Constitutional claims, proceed to her statutory claims,\n\nand end with her remaining common-law claims.\n\n       Before addressing the merits of those claims, however, the Court will dismiss Plaintiff’s\n\nCount XI for “DECLARATORY and INJUNCTION [sic] RELIEF.” Am. Compl. at 28.\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fRequests for declaratory judgments and injunctions are not “freestanding cause[s] of action” but\n\nrather invoke “form[s] of relief to redress the other claims asserted by Plaintiff.” Base One\n\nTechnologies, Inc. v.

Such dismissal does not limit\n\nthe remedies to which Lewis may be entitled, of course, should she succeed on one or more of\n\nher claims. See Thorp v.

Nov. 5, 2015).\n\n       A. Constitutional Claims (Counts II, V, and IX)\n\n       Lewis presents three counts that invoke the U.S. Constitution in one form or another.\n\nAlthough she has not specifically so pled, the Court presumes that Plaintiff means to rely on 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, and that she aims to hold the District liable for its actions under Monell v. Dep’t\n\nof Soc. Servs. of City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978) (holding that a municipality may be\n\nsued under § 1983 for injuries arising from execution of a government’s policy or custom).\n\nAmong other failings, each count does not contain only one distinct constitutional violation. The\n\nCourt will thus proceed amendment by amendment, rather than count by count, in addressing\n\nPlaintiff’s claims. It ultimately concludes that the causes of action based on the Fourth and First\n\nAmendments will survive, but that those based on the due-process clauses of the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments will not.\n\n               1. Fourth Amendment (Count II)\n\n       The true gravamen of Lewis’s digressive Complaint is her challenge to the drug-testing\n\nrequirement. She asserts that the city’s blanket and mandatory background check for all\n\nlaboratory employees – which included a drug test – is an “unreasonable search” under the\n\nFourth Amendment, see Am. Compl., ¶ 49; Opp. at 7, which protects the “right of the people to\n\nbe secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\n\nseizures. . . .” U.S. Const., Amend. IV. The grist of her dispute is that she and her coworkers\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fwere forced to either submit to an unconstitutional practice – a suspicionless drug test – or face\n\ntermination as a consequence.\n\n       It is helpful to view the claim as a subspecies of the doctrine of “unconstitutional\n\nconditions,” in which the government improperly seeks to “extract[] . . . consent” for an invalid\n\nsearch “through a threatened withholding of a benefit,” like public employment.

But in the context of a government employer’s\n\nsearch of an employee where that “search is not used to gather evidence of a criminal offense,”\n\nthe Court has concluded that probable cause is not required. Id. at 724-25. The search, rather,\n\nmust be judged against the standard of “reasonableness under all the circumstances,” id. at 725-\n\n26, which typically means that it “must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.”\n\nChandler v.

Defendants instead emphasize that certain interests pertaining to the city’s\n\nmanagement of the laboratory and its multi-agency workforce justify recourse to blanket drug\n\ntesting. See Mot. at 11.\n\n       In so doing, the District relies on an amorphous bucket of cases bearing the “special\n\nneeds” moniker, wherein warrantless or suspicionless searches may be justified where the\n\ngovernment’s interests lie “‘beyond the normal need for law enforcement’” and when “‘it is\n\nimpractical to require a warrant or some level of individualized suspicion in the particular\n\ncontext.’” Stigile v.

Cir. 1997) (quoting Von Raab, 489 U.S. at\n\n665-66). In particular, Defendants argue, a suspicionless testing program is justified here\n\nbecause of the city’s overall interest in “maintaining a secure [laboratory] facility” and\n\n“reduc[ing] or eliminat[ing] any fraud, waste, and abuse of individuals who have a duty station\n\n[there],” as well as the Department of Forensic Science’s specific interest, mandated by Mayoral\n\nOrder, in “safeguard[ing] evidence and samples in [DFS’s] custody.” Mot. at 11.\n\n       There can be no doubt that the city intends its drug test to “‘serve[] special governmental\n\nneeds, beyond the normal need for law enforcement,’” Stigile, 110 F.3d at 808 (quoting Skinner\n\nv.

See,\n\ne.g., D.C. Code § 1–615.51 (establishing protections for whistleblowers who “report waste,\n\nfraud, abuse of authority, violations of law, or threats to public health or safety”). Because\n\nDefendants have not, at this stage of the proceedings, had an opportunity to make clear how the\n\ncity’s general interest in curbing corruption applies with particularity to individuals stationed at\n\nthe laboratory, the Court cannot now find this interest sufficient to justify a “special needs”\n\nsearch.\n\n          As for the remaining interests – maintaining a secure facility (generally) and safeguarding\n\nevidence and samples in the custody of DFS (specifically) – those, too, furnish an inadequate\n\nbasis at this stage to render Plaintiff’s claim deficient as a matter of law. For one thing, the city\n\nhas not yet explained why those interests justify compulsory drug testing for all employees\n\nstationed at the laboratory, regardless of which agency they work in, what position they occupy,\n\nor what level of access they have within the facility.

The clerk insisted that drug testing was appropriate for, among other\n\npositions, the court’s criminal- and civil-minute clerks because they might have “access” to\n\ncertain evidence used during court proceedings, including drugs. See id. at *16. After a trial on\n\nthe merits, the federal court concluded that even though minute clerks are often in close\n\nproximity to drugs, “at no time [are drugs] left in these employee’s [sic] unsupervised\n\npossession,” thus rendering the “feared harm” – that the “clerks will remove the evidence from\n\nthe courtroom in plain view of all other persons present [ – ] improbable and remote.” Id. The\n\ngovernment’s invocation of special needs as to those employees, therefore, was not justified,\n\neven if the test was permissible as to others. See id.; accord Jakubowicz v. Dittemore, No. 05-\n\n4135, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2623210</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (W.D. Mo. Sept. 12, 2006) (enjoining drug testing of certain\n\nemployees working in mental-health centers in part because “[t]here [was] no evidence that the\n\nPlaintiffs work in secure areas of the facilities . . . . no[r] evidence that these Plaintiffs have\n\ndirect responsibility for patient care”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   11\n\f       Defendants’ appeal to Stigile is also inapposite at this stage. In that case, the D.C. Circuit\n\nreversed a district court’s decision, made after an expedited Rule 65(a) trial, that random drug\n\ntests of Office of Management and Budget employees that either had offices in or permanent\n\naccess to areas “within the White House security perimeter” were not reasonable under the\n\nFourth Amendment. See 110 F.3d at 802. In reaching its conclusion, the D.C. Circuit held that\n\nthe government’s interest – protecting the safety of the President and Vice President, who were\n\n“frequently” on the grounds or in the same building as those employees – was “substantial.” Id.\n\nat 802, 806. Unlike here, the employees challenging the drug tests did not argue that they could\n\nor should be segregated from areas of the White House grounds in such a way as to render drug\n\ntests unnecessary. See id. at 806-07 (noting that only “permanent passholders” were required to\n\nundergo drug testing, unlike “non-permanent passholders” like interns, reporters, and\n\ncontractors, who had more limited access to the facilities). In contrast, Plaintiff has argued quite\n\nclearly that the drug-testing program was capable of being more “narrowly tailored.” Opp. at 7;\n\nsee id. at 9 n.3 (suggesting that “[i]t is disingenusous for defendants to assert that within the\n\nCFL, there would not be different levels of security and areas of restricted access, e.g.,\n\nlaboratories, storage facilities, and file rooms such that Ms. Lewis, as a Human Resources\n\nadvisor would be prohibited from entering”). The government has not responded to this\n\nassertion – likely because it cannot without citing materials outside the pleadings – and it is not\n\nobvious to the Court that Plaintiff’s intuition here is off the mark. The Court will thus deny\n\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss Lewis’s challenge to the drug-testing policy, at least as it was\n\napplied to her.\n\n       Given Plaintiff’s disjointed approach to pleading, however, a couple of additional loose\n\nends must be tied up. First is that, in addition to her challenge to the drug-testing policy as\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fapplied to her specifically, she also seeks injunctive relief prohibiting application of the policy to\n\nall employees with duty stations in the consolidated laboratory, see Am. Compl., at 29, ¶ 4, or at\n\nleast to all employees “who are not in a ‘high-risk, safety-sensitive job.’” Opp. at 11. As this\n\nremedial request “reach[es] beyond [Plaintiff’s] particular circumstances,” Lewis must either be\n\nbringing suit on behalf of others (which she is not) or she must satisfy the Supreme Court’s\n\n“standards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.” John Doe No. 1 v. Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150541\"><a href=\"/opinion/150541/doe-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194 (2010). To accomplish the latter, she must show “that no set of circumstances exists\n\nunder which [the Mayor’s policy] would be valid” as to at least the subset of employees who are\n\nnot designated as occupying high-risk or safety-sensitive positions. See United States v.

This she cannot do, in no small part because her Complaint is bereft\n\nof any definition of the categorical distinction between “high risk” and “low risk” positions she\n\nseeks to make. Without an understanding of how far the relief she seeks would extend, the Court\n\ncannot say that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that no set of circumstances exists in which non-\n\nhigh-risk or non-safety-sensitive personnel might reasonably be subject to suspicionless\n\nsearches. See Cook v. City of Bell Gardens, No. 13-2030, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2342412</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11 (C.D.

Compl. at 29, ¶ 1.

Compl., ¶ 22. This policy appears\n\ninextricably linked to the drug-testing policy itself, and because that challenge survives, the\n\nCourt will not dismiss her related challenge to the prescription-drug-disclosure requirement at\n\nthis stage.\n\n               2. First Amendment (Count IX)\n\n        Plaintiff’s First Amendment claim is that she suffered certain harms – being forced to\n\nendure unpleasant employment conditions and ultimately termination – that were inflicted in\n\nretaliation for engaging in speech protected by the First Amendment.

But the D.C. Circuit has refuted “the proposition that a\n\npersonnel matter per se cannot be a matter of public concern.” LeFande, 613 F.3d at 1161.\n\nRather, speech “relates to a matter of public concern if it is ‘of political, social, or other concern\n\nto the community.’” Id. at 1159 (quoting Connick v.

As an\n\nexample, were the head of a city department “to assert the power to fire, without process, all [its\n\nsubordinate] officers, paid and unpaid, that action would ‘be fairly considered as relating to [a]\n\n                                                  15\n\fmatter of political, social, or other concern to the community’ . . . although it relates to a\n\n‘personnel matter.’” Id. at 1161.\n\n       Although she may not have been acting as a latter-day Dorothy Day, it is clear that\n\nPlaintiff’s objections to the city’s drug-testing policy were not so myopic in focus as to be only\n\napplicable to her as an individual. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 23, 24. Lewis states that her written\n\ncorrespondence with the city attorney questioned whether the policy should be applied across the\n\nboard or if it might be more narrowly tailored to exclude “positions” that were designated as\n\n“non-sensitive.” Id., ¶ 23. It is thus quite different from an employee who merely protests that,\n\nfor reasons specific to her, she should not be subject to drug testing. See Durand v. D.C., 38 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 119, 126 (D.D.C. 2014) (police officer’s emails up the chain of command constituted a\n\n“specific personnel grievance” as he was simply “objecting to the manner in which disciplinary\n\nproceedings against him were conducted”); Hultquist v.

Tellingly, the city has not even attempted to argue\n\nthat a broadside attack on the constitutionality of the city’s drug-testing policy is not a matter of\n\npublic import. Given the facts as alleged, Lewis’s speech touched on matters of public concern.\n\n       The next question is whether she spoke “as a citizen” or, instead, “pursuant to [her]\n\nofficial duties.” Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 421. “[W]hen public employees make statements pursuant\n\nto their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes,\n\nand the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.” Id.\n\n(district attorney did not speak as private citizen when he wrote and filed memorandum that was\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\f“part of what he, as a calendar deputy, was employed to do”). The Court need not dwell here,\n\nhowever, because Defendants have not asserted that Lewis spoke pursuant to her official duties,\n\nsee Mot. at 7-8, nor is it apparent from the face of her Complaint that her job as a human-\n\nresources adviser contemplated that she advance the type of grievance she made here. The Court\n\nwill thus not dismiss her claim on that basis.\n\n       The second prong of the four-part inquiry requires the Court to consider whether the\n\ncity’s “interest in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its\n\nemployees outweighs [Lewis’s] interest, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public\n\nconcern.” Bowie, 642 F.3d at 1133. Perhaps confused as to what “interests” are at stake in this\n\nbalancing act, Defendants here offer that “the District’s interest in promoting the safety and\n\neffectiveness of the [laboratory] would clearly outweigh Plaintiff’s interest.” Mot. at 7. But\n\nwhatever interest the city may have in establishing a drug-test policy, that has no bearing on the\n\nFirst Amendment question here, which is what interest the government has “as an employer in\n\nregulating the speech of its employees,” and whether that interest outweighs Plaintiff’s interest as\n\na citizen “in commenting upon matters of public concern.” Pickering v.

They argue that there is too great an\n\ninterval between her speech, which allegedly took place in July of 2012, see Am. Compl., ¶¶ 23-\n\n24, and her termination, which occurred in April 2013. See id., ¶ 20; Mot. at 8. Even if they are\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fright, they calculated the time elapsed based only on Plaintiff’s date of termination. Their\n\nMotion thus completely ignores her allegations that the retaliation comprised “a campaign” of\n\nactions including but not limited to her firing. See id., ¶ 24. Some of those steps took place at\n\nleast as early as October 2012, when Plaintiff alleges she was forced to remain in her office alone\n\nand without heat. See id., ¶ 24. Others, like the posting of her photograph at the guard booth,\n\nmay have taken place earlier than that. Having not disputed that these other incidents may also\n\nconstitute “adverse actions” in the First Amendment context, see Tao v.

The Court will thus not dismiss Plaintiff’s First\n\nAmendment claim at this stage.\n\n               3. Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments (Also Count II)\n\n       Plaintiff also alleges (in the same count as her Fourth Amendment claim) that Defendants\n\ndenied her “Right of Due Process” guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.

As a preliminary matter, Defendants correctly point out\n\nthat she invoked the wrong constitutional amendment, since it is the Fifth Amendment, and not\n\nthe Fourteenth, that applies to the District of Columbia and its employees.

As far as the\n\nCourt can tell, Plaintiff appears to allege only varieties of procedural due-process violations.\n\nGiven the prolixity of Plaintiff’s Complaint, it is, of course, possible that, buried deep therein,\n\nshe dropped clues that, if properly assembled, would allege a deprivation of substantive due\n\nprocess.

The facts alleged here come nowhere close to\n\nmeeting this high standard.\n\n       Returning to procedural due process, the Complaint similarly fails to state a claim that\n\ncan survive a motion to dismiss. “Procedural due process imposes constraints on governmental\n\ndecisions which deprive individuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests within the meaning of the\n\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.” Mathews v.

In many\n\nparagraphs, she alleges the inadequacy of certain procedural protections but without ever\n\nidentifying any deprivation of a recognized liberty or property interest. See Am. Compl., ¶ 23\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f(suggesting the “ultimatum” she was given by the city attorney to consent to the drug test or risk\n\ntermination violated her “due process right to fair notice”); id., ¶ 28 (same), id., ¶ 41 (arguing\n\nthat “threaten[ing] to take away [her] paramount property interest in her civil servant job is per se\n\na violation of due process”) (emphasis added); id., ¶ 65 (same). Lewis offers no legal basis for\n\nconcluding that she has a constitutionally protected interest in being free from a threatened\n\ntermination, and, indeed, the Court knows of no such case to so hold.\n\n       In other paragraphs, Plaintiff identifies at least some plausible constitutionally protected\n\ninterests that were infringed upon – e.g., her public employment and her reputation.

Americans with Disabilities Act (Count VIII)\n\n        Continuing her pattern of advancing numerous causes of action in a single count, Plaintiff\n\nnext alleges several distinct ADA violations against Defendants in Count VIII. The first claims\n\nthat the city made an improper medical inquiry, which is prohibited under the ADA except under\n\n\n\n                                                   21\n\fcertain circumstances. The second asserts that the District discriminated against her on the basis\n\nof her disability. Finally, in her Opposition, she seeks to add a third ground for relief –\n\nretaliation. All but the first proceed no farther.\n\n                              Improper Medical Inquiry\n\n       Plaintiff’s primary allegation is that the ADA prohibited the District from requiring her to\n\nboth submit to a drug test and to fill out the “Notification of [] Drug and Alcohol Testing Form,”\n\nwhich allegedly demanded that Plaintiff disclose “any current medications.” Am. Compl., ¶¶ 21,\n\n22. Such demands, she claims, are barred under the ADA.\n\n       In addition to prohibiting discrimination and retaliation on the basis of an employee’s\n\ndisability, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112, 12203, the ADA also places restrictions on an\n\nemployer’s ability to make medically related inquiries of its employees, whether they suffer from\n\na disability or not. Section 12112(d)(4)(A) provides that a covered employer\n\n               shall not require a medical examination and shall not make inquiries\n               of an employee as to whether such employee is an individual with a\n               disability . . . unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-\n               related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nDespite the apparent breadth of that provision, the statute elsewhere clarifies that “a test to\n\ndetermine the illegal use of drugs shall not be considered a medical examination,” id. §\n\n12114(d)(1), although it includes a disclaimer that “[n]othing in this subchapter shall be\n\nconstrued to encourage, prohibit, or authorize the conducting of drug testing for the illegal use of\n\ndrugs by job applicants or employees or making employment decisions based on such test\n\nresults.” Id. § 12114(d)(2); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.16(c).\n\n       In responding to Plaintiff’s allegations, Defendants argue primarily that “a drug test is not\n\na medical examination” under § 12114(d)(1), and that Plaintiff’s ADA claim thus fails as a\n\nmatter of law. See Mot. at 22. Defendants may be right on that first narrow point. But see\n\n\n                                                     22\n\fE.E.O.C. v.

But they conveniently ignore Plaintiff’s other allegation –\n\nthat the District impermissibly required her to disclose her prescription-drug regimen. Without\n\ndeveloped argumentation from the District on this point, and considering that other courts have\n\nfound factually similar inquiries to be prohibited by the ADA, the Court concludes that this\n\nallegation is sufficient to allow her claim to proceed at this stage.

While the Court agrees that “difficulty of traversing stairs” almost certainly\n\ndoes not qualify as a disability under the ADA, see Am. Compl., ¶ 24, the medical-inquiry\n\nprovisions of the statute “protect[] all employees from medical inquiries, regardless of whether\n\nthey have a qualifying disability.” Bates, 767 F.3d at 573. Lewis’s improper-inquiry claim\n\nunder Count VIII thus survives.\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f                              Disability Discrimination\n\n       Like her race-discrimination count, Plaintiff has vaguely pleaded but subsequently\n\nabandoned a claim that she was discriminated against on the basis of a disability.

To the extent Count VIII contains a cause of action for\n\ndisability discrimination, it will not proceed.\n\n                              Retaliation\n\n       In her Opposition, Plaintiff also attempts to plead that she was retaliated against for\n\nprotesting the drug test. See Opp. at 17. But because that claim is newly presented, the Court\n\nwill not address it here. See, e.g., Kingman Park Civic Ass’n v.

Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (Count VII)\n\n       Next up is Plaintiff’s novel gambit of alleging discrimination under the Genetic\n\nInformation Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000ff et seq., which\n\nprohibits discrimination on the basis of an employee’s “genetic information.” See id. § 2000ff-\n\n1(a). In some ways similar to the ADA, GINA prohibits an employer from “request[ing],\n\nrequir[ing], or purchas[ing] genetic information with respect to an employee,” id. § 2000ff-1(b)\n\n(emphasis added), subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. Lewis alleges that the\n\nmandatory drug test constituted such an improper request. See Am. Compl., ¶ 78-80. As\n\n                                                  24\n\fDefendants point out, however, nothing in the Complaint suggests that, through its drug-test\n\npolicy, the District requested genetic information as that phrase is defined by statute. See\n\n§ 2000ff(4) (“The term ‘genetic information’ means, with respect to any individual, information\n\nabout--(i) such individual’s genetic tests, (ii) the genetic tests of family members of such\n\nindividual, and (iii) the manifestation of a disease or disorder in family members of such\n\nindividual.”); 29 C.F.R. § 1635.3(c). EEOC implementing regulations make clear, furthermore,\n\nthat “[a] test for the presence of alcohol or illegal drugs is not a genetic test,” 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1635.3(f)(4)(i), meaning that a request for such a test similarly does not constitute a request for\n\ngenetic information under EEOC rules. This brave-new-world count ends here.\n\n                4. D.C. Human Rights Act (Count IV)\n\n        Plaintiff’s final statutory claim is that the District retaliated against her in violation of the\n\nD.C. Human Rights Act. Although the Complaint clearly identifies what Plaintiff believes\n\nconstitutes the retaliation – her exile in the abandoned building and her eventual termination, see\n\nAm. Compl., ¶ 69 – she never alleges that she took any action covered by the statute that\n\nprompted her employer to react improperly. For that reason, her claim will not continue beyond\n\nthe pleading stage.\n\n        The DCHRA proscribes discriminatory employment practices based on an employee’s\n\n“race, color, religion, . . . disability . . . or political affiliation,” among other things, D.C.Code §\n\n2–1402.11(a)(1), and also prohibits retaliating against an employee “on account of having\n\nexercised or enjoyed . . . any right granted or protected under this chapter.” Id. § 2–1402.61(a);\n\nsee McCaskill v.

Supp. 3d at 154\n\n(citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In Lewis’s case, she has not plausibly alleged that she participated in any “statutorily\n\nprotected activity.” Id. She alleges only that she “rightfully objected” to the District’s drug-\n\ntesting policy and consent form, see Am. Compl., ¶ 65, but nowhere in her Opposition does she\n\nexplain how such actions constitute protected activity under the DCHRA. To be sure, the\n\nstatute’s language offers little guidance in determining what types of activities fall within the\n\nambit of “protected activity.” See McCaskill, 36 F. Supp. 3d at 154. But courts interpreting this\n\nprovision of the DCHRA have emphasized that the law serves primarily to “protect[] employees\n\nwho bring or threaten to bring a discrimination claim against their employer.” Id.

Plaintiff nowhere\n\nalleges that the communications with the city’s lawyer about her objection to a generally\n\napplicable city policy constituted a complaint of discrimination in any manner of speaking, and\n\nthe Court sees no other basis on which Lewis may properly establish a claim of retaliation under\n\nthe DCHRA.\n\n       C. Common-Law Claims\n\n       Plaintiff’s last set of counts involves common-law claims for wrongful termination\n\n(Count I), intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count VI), and defamation (Count X). The\n\nCourt need not address the merits of any of these, as it is clear that Plaintiff should have first\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\fsought administrative redress under the District’s Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act (CMPA)\n\nbefore lodging such claims in court.\n\n        “The CMPA provides a remedy for the majority of employment related conflicts that\n\noccur between the District of Columbia and its employees.” Owens v.

Even if they did, such conduct does not\n\nplausibly satisfy the “demanding standard” of being “so outrageous in character, and so extreme\n\nin degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and\n\nutterly intolerable in a civilized society.” Heasley v.

Fernandez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1064</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1075 (D.C. 1991)). Plaintiff’s\n\nintentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress claim, like her other two common-law claims, will\n\ntherefore be dismissed.\n\n        D. Dismissal of Individual Plaintiffs\n\n        In addition to suing the District, Lewis has also named an array of individual Defendants,\n\nincluding Gray, Tucker, Fields, and Paul Quander, the city’s director of public safety, along with\n\n“Does 1 through 50.” See Am. Compl. at 1. In this Motion, Gray and Fields seek dismissal of\n\nall surviving claims against them, whether in their official or individual capacities. Now that the\n\nCourt has dismissed much of the Complaint, the only surviving count lodged against these two\n\nindividual Defendants is Count II, which is Plaintiff’s § 1983 claim for a violation of her rights\n\nunder the Fourth Amendment. See Section III.A.1, infra. The Court separately considers it as an\n\nofficial-capacity and personal-capacity claim.\n\n                1. Official-Capacity Claim\n\n        While “personal-capacity suits seek to impose personal liability upon a government\n\nofficial for actions he takes under color of state law,” Kentucky v. Graham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111500\"><a href=\"/opinion/111500/kentucky-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 165-66\n\n(1985), “[o]fficial-capacity suits . . . ‘generally represent only another way of pleading an action\n\nagainst an entity of which an officer is an agent.’” Id. (quoting Monell v. New York City Dept.\n\nof Social Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 690 n.55 (1978)). The D.C. Circuit has thus concluded that\n\n“[a] section 1983 suit for damages against municipal officials in their official capacities is . . .\n\nequivalent to a suit against the municipality itself.” Atchinson v. D.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710872\"><a href=\"/opinion/710872/richard-atchinson-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1996). Because Plaintiff’s § 1983 claim under the Fourth Amendment will proceed against\n\n\n\n\n                                                  30\n\fthe District, the Court will dismiss it as redundant against Gray and Fields in their official\n\ncapacities. See Cooke-Seals v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1609129\"><a href=\"/opinion/1609129/cooke-seals-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 187 (D.D.C. 1997).\n\n               2. Personal-Capacity Claim\n\n        “To state a claim under § 1983 against an official in his individual capacity, a plaintiff\n\nmust plead facts sufficient to allege (1) ‘the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and\n\nthe laws of the United States,’ and (2) ‘that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person\n\nacting under color of state law.’” Ford v. Donovan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (D.D.C. 2012)\n\n(quoting West v. Atkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112116\"><a href=\"/opinion/112116/west-v-atkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (1988)) (emphasis added).\n\n       As to Fields: The Complaint pleads no facts that any Fourth Amendment deprivation was\n\ncommitted by her. The only specific conduct attributed to her pertains to her alleged\n\ninvolvement in directing a subordinate to surprise Plaintiff in the abandoned office building – a\n\nseries of incidents that has no bearing on Lewis’s Fourth Amendment claim. Fields will thus be\n\ndismissed from the case.\n\n       As to Gray: While a plaintiff may bring suit against a mayor in his individual capacity\n\nunder § 1983, she may do so only by alleging “that the Mayor was directly responsible for the\n\nconstitutional deprivation” or that he gave “‘authorization or approval of such misconduct.’”\n\nEkwem v. Fenty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2151327\"><a href=\"/opinion/2151327/ekwem-v-fenty/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Int’l Action Center v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186179\"><a href=\"/opinion/186179/intl-actn-ctr-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (D.C.

A key flaw in Plaintiff’s claim against Gray is that, while the Mayor’s Order clearly\n\nprovides the basis for the District’s implementation of a drug-testing policy, neither the Order\n\nnor the facts alleged in the Complaint indicate that the Mayor himself had any role in the\n\ndecision to fire employees who refused to comply with that policy. The Order merely delegates\n\nauthority to the District’s Department of Human Resources to use a variety of means – including\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\f“one or more of the following: background checks, investigations, mandatory criminal\n\nbackground checks, and testing for controlled substance use” – as a way of “provid[ing] for the\n\nsecurity and protection of evidence and samples in [the Department of Forensic Sciences’]\n\ncustody.” Mayor’s Order 2012-84 at 1. It does not require the Human Resources department to\n\nuse drug testing as the chosen means for providing such security, nor does it even state that any\n\nsuch means must necessarily apply to the entire laboratory workforce. Without allegations in her\n\nComplaint to suggest that Gray had any personal role in her ouster, the suit against him cannot\n\nproceed.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For these reasons, the Court will grant Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to Counts I, III-\n\nVII, and X-XI, and as to Defendants Gray and Fields. It will deny Defendants’ Motion as to\n\nCounts II, VIII, and IX. A separate Order so stating will issue this day.\n\n\n\n                                                             /s/ James E.
