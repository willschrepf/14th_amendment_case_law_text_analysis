TEXAS \n\n    DIVISION, SONS OF CONFEDERATE VETERANS, \n\n                    INC., ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 14–144.      Argued March 23, 2015—Decided June 18, 2015\nTexas offers automobile owners a choice between general-issue and\n  specialty license plates. Those who want the State to issue a particu-\n  lar specialty plate may propose a plate design, comprising a slogan, a\n  graphic, or both. If the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board\n  approves the design, the State will make it available for display on\n  vehicles registered in Texas. Here, the Texas Division of the Sons of\n  Confederate Veterans and its officers (collectively SCV) filed suit\n  against the Chairman and members of the Board (collectively Board),\n  arguing that the Board’s rejection of SCV’s proposal for a specialty\n  plate design featuring a Confederate battle flag violated the Free\n  Speech Clause. The District Court entered judgment for the Board,\n  but the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that Texas’s specialty license\n  plate designs are private speech and that the Board engaged in con-\n  stitutionally forbidden viewpoint discrimination when it refused to\n  approve SCV’s design.\nHeld: Texas’s specialty license plate designs constitute government\n  speech, and thus Texas was entitled to refuse to issue plates featur-\n  ing SCV’s proposed design. Pp. 5–18.\n    (a) When government speaks, it is not barred by the Free Speech\n  Clause from determining the content of what it says. Pleasant Grove\n  City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 467–468. A government is generally\n  entitled to promote a program, espouse a policy, or take a position.\n  Were the Free Speech Clause interpreted otherwise, “it is not easy to\n  imagine how government would function.” Id., at 468. That is not to\n\f2                   WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n                    CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    say that a government’s ability to express itself is without restriction.\n    Constitutional and statutory provisions outside of the Free Speech\n    Clause may limit government speech, and the Free Speech Clause it-\n    self may constrain the government’s speech if, for example, the gov-\n    ernment seeks to compel private persons to convey the government’s\n    speech. Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) This Court’s precedents regarding government speech provide\n    the appropriate framework through which to approach the case.\n    Pp. 6–17.\n         (1) The same analysis the Court used in Summum—to conclude\n    that a city “accepting a privately donated monument and placing it\n    on city property” was engaging in government speech, 555 U. S., at\n    464—leads to the conclusion that government speech is at issue here.\n    First, history shows that States, including Texas, have long used li-\n    cense plates to convey government speech, e.g., slogans urging action,\n    promoting tourism, and touting local industries. Cf. id., at 470. Se-\n    cond, Texas license plate designs “are often closely identified in the\n    public mind with the [State].” Id., at 472. Each plate is a govern-\n    ment article serving the governmental purposes of vehicle registra-\n    tion and identification. The governmental nature of the plates is\n    clear from their faces: the State places the name “TEXAS” in large\n    letters across the top of every plate. Texas also requires Texas vehi-\n    cle owners to display license plates, issues every Texas plate, and\n    owns all of the designs on its plates. The plates are, essentially, gov-\n    ernment IDs, and ID issuers “typically do not permit” their IDs to\n    contain “message[s] with which they do not wish to be associated,”\n    id., at 471. Third, Texas maintains direct control over the messages\n    conveyed on its specialty plates, by giving the Board final approval\n    over each design. Like the city government in Summum, Texas “has\n    effectively controlled the messages [conveyed] by exercising final ap-\n    proval authority over their selection.” Id., at 473. These considera-\n    tions, taken together, show that Texas’s specialty plates are similar\n    enough to the monuments in Summum to call for the same result.\n    Pp. 7–12.\n         (2) Forum analysis, which applies to government restrictions on\n    purely private speech occurring on government property, Cornelius v.\n    NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800, is not\n    appropriate when the State is speaking on its own behalf. The par-\n    ties agree that Texas’s specialty license plates are not a traditional\n    public forum. Further, Texas’s policies and the nature of its license\n    plates indicate that the State did not intend its specialty plates to\n    serve as either a designated public forum—where “government prop-\n    erty . . . not traditionally . . . a public forum is intentionally opened\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  up for that purpose,” Summum, supra, at 469—or a limited public fo-\n  rum—where a government “reserv[es a forum] for certain groups or\n  for the discussion of certain topics,” Rosenberger v. Rector and Visi-\n  tors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829. The State exercises final au-\n  thority over the messages that may be conveyed by its specialty\n  plates, it takes ownership of each specialty plate design, and it has\n  traditionally used its plates for government speech. These features of\n  Texas specialty plates militate against a determination that Texas\n  has created a public forum. Finally, the plates are not a nonpublic\n  forum, where the “government is . . . a proprietor, managing its in-\n  ternal operations.” International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc.\n  v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672, 678–679. The fact that private parties take\n  part in the design and propagation of a message does not extinguish\n  the governmental nature of the message or transform the govern-\n  ment’s role into that of a mere forum provider. See Summum, supra,\n  at 470–471. Nor does Texas’s requirement that vehicle owners pay\n  annual fees for specialty plates mean that the plates are a forum for\n  private speech. And this case does not resemble other nonpublic fo-\n  rum cases. Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators’ Assn., 460 U. S.\n  37, 48–49; Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298; and Cornelius,\n  supra, at 804–806, distinguished. Pp. 13–17.\n    (c) The determination that Texas’s specialty license plate designs\n  are government speech does not mean that the designs do not also\n  implicate the free speech rights of private persons. The Court has\n  acknowledged that drivers who display a State’s selected license\n  plate designs convey the messages communicated through those de-\n  signs. See Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 717, n. 15. The Court\n  has also recognized that the First Amendment stringently limits a\n  State’s authority to compel a private party to express a view with\n  which the private party disagrees. Just as Texas cannot require SCV\n  to convey “the State’s ideological message,” id., at 715, SCV cannot\n  force Texas to include a Confederate battle flag on its specialty li-\n  cense plates.

Those who want the\nState to issue a particular specialty plate may propose a\nplate design, comprising a slogan, a graphic, or (most\ncommonly) both. If the Texas Department of Motor Vehi-\ncles Board approves the design, the State will make it\navailable for display on vehicles registered in Texas.\n  In this case, the Texas Division of the Sons of Confeder-\nate Veterans proposed a specialty license plate design\nfeaturing a Confederate battle flag. The Board rejected\nthe proposal. We must decide whether that rejection\nviolated the Constitution’s free speech guarantees. See\nAmdts. 1, 14. We conclude that it did not.\n                           I\n\n                           A\n\n  Texas law requires all motor vehicles operating on the\nState’s roads to display valid license plates. See Tex.\nTransp. Code Ann. §§502.001 (West Supp. 2014), 504.001\n\f2             WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n(2013), 504.943 (Supp. 2014). And Texas makes available\nseveral kinds of plates. Drivers may choose to display the\nState’s general-issue license plates. See Texas Dept. of\nMotor Vehicles, Motor Vehicle Registration Manual 9.1\n(Apr. 2015). Each of these plates contains the word\n“Texas,” a license plate number, a silhouette of the\nState, a graphic of the Lone Star, and the slogan\n“The Lone Star State.” Texas Dept. of Motor Vehicles, The\nTexas Classic FAQs (July 16, 2012), online at\nhttp://www.txdmv.gov/motorists/license-plates (all Inter-\nnet materials as visited June 16, 2015, and available in\nClerk of Court’s case file). In the alternative, drivers may\nchoose from an assortment of specialty license plates.\n§504.008(b) (West 2013). Each of these plates contains the\nword “Texas,” a license plate number, and one of a selec-\ntion of designs prepared by the State. See ibid.; Specialty\nLicense Plates, http://www.txdmv.gov/motorists/license-\nplates/specialty-license-plates (displaying available Texas\nspecialty plates); Create a Plate: Your Design,\nhttp://www.myplates.com/BackgroundOnly (same). Finally,\nTexas law provides for personalized plates (also known\nas vanity plates). 43 Tex. Admin. Code §217.45(c)(7)\n(2015). Pursuant to the personalization program, a vehi-\ncle owner may request a particular alphanumeric pattern\nfor use as a plate number, such as “BOB” or “TEXPL8.”\n   Here we are concerned only with the second category of\nplates, namely specialty license plates, not with the per-\nsonalization program. Texas offers vehicle owners a va-\nriety of specialty plates, generally for an annual fee. See\n§217.45(b)(2). And Texas selects the designs for specialty\nplates through three distinct processes.\n   First, the state legislature may specifically call for the\ndevelopment of a specialty license plate. See Tex. Transp.\nCode §§504.602–504.663 (West 2013 and Supp. 2014). The\nlegislature has enacted statutes authorizing, for example,\nplates that say “Keep Texas Beautiful” and “Mothers\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAgainst Drunk Driving,” plates that “honor” the Texas\ncitrus industry, and plates that feature an image of the\nWorld Trade Center towers and the words “Fight Terror-\nism.” See §§504.602, 504.608, 504.626, 504.647.\n   Second, the Board may approve a specialty plate design\nproposal that a state-designated private vendor has\ncreated at the request of an individual or organization.\nSee §§504.6011(a), 504.851(a); 43 Tex. Admin. Code\n§217.52(b). Among the plates created through the private-\nvendor process are plates promoting the “Keller Indians”\nand plates with the slogan “Get it Sold with RE/MAX.”\n   Third, the Board “may create new specialty license\nplates on its own initiative or on receipt of an application\nfrom a” nonprofit entity seeking to sponsor a specialty\nplate. Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §§504.801(a), (b). A non-\nprofit must include in its application “a draft design of the\nspecialty license plate.” 43 Tex. Admin. Code\n§217.45(i)(2)(C). And Texas law vests in the Board author-\nity to approve or to disapprove an application. See\n§217.45(i)(7). The relevant statute says that the Board\n“may refuse to create a new specialty license plate” for a\nnumber of reasons, for example “if the design might be\noffensive to any member of the public . . . or for any other\nreason established by rule.” Tex. Transp. Code Ann.\n§504.801(c). Specialty plates that the Board has sanc-\ntioned through this process include plates featuring the\nwords “The Gator Nation,” together with the Florida\nGators logo, and plates featuring the logo of Rotary Inter-\nnational and the words “SERVICE ABOVE SELF.”\n                             B\n   In 2009, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Texas Divi-\nsion (a nonprofit entity), applied to sponsor a specialty\nlicense plate through this last-mentioned process. SCV’s\napplication included a draft plate design. See Appendix,\ninfra. At the bottom of the proposed plate were the words\n\f4             WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n“SONS OF CONFEDERATE VETERANS.” At the side\nwas the organization’s logo, a square Confederate battle\nflag framed by the words “Sons of Confederate Veterans\n1896.” A faint Confederate battle flag appeared in the back-\nground on the lower portion of the plate. Additionally,\nin the middle of the plate was the license plate number,\nand at the top was the State’s name and silhouette. The\nBoard’s predecessor denied this application.\n   In 2010, SCV renewed its application before the Board.\nThe Board invited public comment on its website and at\nan open meeting. After considering the responses, includ-\ning a number of letters sent by elected officials who op-\nposed the proposal, the Board voted unanimously against\nissuing the plate. The Board explained that it had found\n“it necessary to deny th[e] plate design application, specif-\nically the confederate flag portion of the design, because\npublic comments ha[d] shown that many members of the\ngeneral public find the design offensive, and because such\ncomments are reasonable.” App. 64. The Board added\n“that a significant portion of the public associate the con-\nfederate flag with organizations advocating expressions of\nhate directed toward people or groups that is demeaning\nto those people or groups.” Id., at 65.\n   In 2012, SCV and two of its officers (collectively SCV)\nbrought this lawsuit against the chairman and members\nof the Board (collectively Board). SCV argued that the\nBoard’s decision violated the Free Speech Clause of the\nFirst Amendment, and it sought an injunction requiring\nthe Board to approve the proposed plate design. The\nDistrict Court entered judgment for the Board. A divided\npanel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit re-\nversed. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., v.\nVandergriff, 759 F. 3d 388 (2014). It held that Texas’s\nspecialty license plate designs are private speech and that\nthe Board, in refusing to approve SCV’s design, engaged in\nconstitutionally forbidden viewpoint discrimination. The\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndissenting judge argued that Texas’s specialty license\nplate designs are government speech, the content of which\nthe State is free to control.\n  We granted the Board’s petition for certiorari, and we\nnow reverse.\n                             II\n  When government speaks, it is not barred by the Free\nSpeech Clause from determining the content of what it\nsays. Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460,\n467–468 (2009). That freedom in part reflects the fact\nthat it is the democratic electoral process that first and\nforemost provides a check on government speech. See\nBoard of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth,\n529 U. S. 217, 235 (2000). Thus, government statements\n(and government actions and programs that take the form\nof speech) do not normally trigger the First Amendment\nrules designed to protect the marketplace of ideas. See\nJohanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn., 544 U. S. 550, 559\n(2005). Instead, the Free Speech Clause helps produce\ninformed opinions among members of the public, who are\nthen able to influence the choices of a government that,\nthrough words and deeds, will reflect its electoral man-\ndate. See Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359, 369\n(1931) (observing that “our constitutional system” seeks to\nmaintain “the opportunity for free political discussion to\nthe end that government may be responsive to the will of\nthe people”).\n  Were the Free Speech Clause interpreted otherwise,\ngovernment would not work. How could a city government\ncreate a successful recycling program if officials, when\nwriting householders asking them to recycle cans and\nbottles, had to include in the letter a long plea from the\nlocal trash disposal enterprise demanding the contrary?\nHow could a state government effectively develop pro-\ngrams designed to encourage and provide vaccinations, if\n\f6              WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n               CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nofficials also had to voice the perspective of those who\noppose this type of immunization? “[I]t is not easy to\nimagine how government could function if it lacked th[e]\nfreedom” to select the messages it wishes to convey.\nSummum, supra, at 468.\n   We have therefore refused “[t]o hold that the Govern-\nment unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of\nviewpoint when it chooses to fund a program dedicated to\nadvance certain permissible goals, because the program in\nadvancing those goals necessarily discourages alternative\ngoals.” Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 194 (1991). We\nhave pointed out that a contrary holding “would render\nnumerous Government programs constitutionally sus-\npect.” Ibid. Cf. Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 12–\n13 (1990) (“If every citizen were to have a right to insist\nthat no one paid by public funds express a view with\nwhich he disagreed, debate over issues of great concern to\nthe public would be limited to those in the private sector,\nand the process of government as we know it radically\ntransformed”). And we have made clear that “the govern-\nment can speak for itself.” Southworth, supra, at 229.\n   That is not to say that a government’s ability to express\nitself is without restriction. Constitutional and statutory\nprovisions outside of the Free Speech Clause may limit\ngovernment speech. Summum, supra, at 468. And the\nFree Speech Clause itself may constrain the government’s\nspeech if, for example, the government seeks to compel\nprivate persons to convey the government’s speech. But,\nas a general matter, when the government speaks it is\nentitled to promote a program, to espouse a policy, or to\ntake a position. In doing so, it represents its citizens and\nit carries out its duties on their behalf.\n                             III\n  In our view, specialty license plates issued pursuant to\nTexas’s statutory scheme convey government speech. Our\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)          7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreasoning rests primarily on our analysis in Summum, a\nrecent case that presented a similar problem. We con-\nclude here, as we did there, that our precedents regarding\ngovernment speech (and not our precedents regarding\nforums for private speech) provide the appropriate frame-\nwork through which to approach the case. See 555 U. S.,\nat 464.\n                              A\n   In Summum, we considered a religious organization’s\nrequest to erect in a 2.5-acre city park a monument setting\nforth the organization’s religious tenets. See id., at 464–\n465. In the park were 15 other permanent displays. Id.,\nat 464. At least 11 of these—including a wishing well, a\nSeptember 11 monument, a historic granary, the city’s\nfirst fire station, and a Ten Commandments monument—\nhad been donated to the city by private entities. Id., at\n464–465. The religious organization argued that the Free\nSpeech Clause required the city to display the organiza-\ntion’s proposed monument because, by accepting a broad\nrange of permanent exhibitions at the park, the city had\ncreated a forum for private speech in the form of monu-\nments. Brief for Respondent in Pleasant Grove City v.\nSummum, O. T. 2008, No. 07–665, pp. 2–3, 30–36.\n   This Court rejected the organization’s argument. We\nheld that the city had not “provid[ed] a forum for private\nspeech” with respect to monuments. Summum, 555 U. S.,\nat 470. Rather, the city, even when “accepting a privately\ndonated monument and placing it on city property,” had\n“engage[d] in expressive conduct.” Id., at 476. The speech\nat issue, this Court decided, was “best viewed as a form of\ngovernment speech” and “therefore [was] not subject to\nscrutiny under the Free Speech Clause.” Id., at 464.\n   We based our conclusion on several factors. First, his-\ntory shows that “[g]overnments have long used monuments\nto speak to the public.” Id., at 470. Thus, we observed\n\f8             WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF \n\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthat “[w]hen a government entity arranges for the con-\nstruction of a monument, it does so because it wishes to\nconvey some thought or instill some feeling in those who\nsee the structure.” Ibid.\n  Second, we noted that it “is not common for property\nowners to open up their property for the installation of\npermanent monuments that convey a message with which\nthey do not wish to be associated.” Id., at 471. As a re-\nsult, “persons who observe donated monuments routine-\nly—and reasonably—interpret them as conveying some\nmessage on the property owner’s behalf.” Ibid. And “ob-\nservers” of such monuments, as a consequence, ordinarily\n“appreciate the identity of the speaker.” Ibid.\n  Third, we found relevant the fact that the city main-\ntained control over the selection of monuments. We\nthought it “fair to say that throughout our Nation’s his-\ntory, the general government practice with respect to do-\nnated monuments has been one of selective receptivity.”\nIbid. And we observed that the city government in Sum-\nmum “ ‘effectively controlled’ the messages sent by the\nmonuments in the [p]ark by exercising ‘final approval\nauthority’ over their selection.” Id., at 473.\n  In light of these and a few other relevant considerations,\nthe Court concluded that the expression at issue was\ngovernment speech. See id., at 470–472. And, in reaching\nthat conclusion, the Court rejected the premise that the\ninvolvement of private parties in designing the monu-\nments was sufficient to prevent the government from\ncontrolling which monuments it placed in its own public\npark. See id., at 470–471. Cf. Rust, supra, at 192–196\n(upholding a federal regulation limiting speech in a\nGovernment-funded program where the program was\nestablished and administered by private parties).\n                         B\n    Our analysis in Summum leads us to the conclusion\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat here, too, government speech is at issue. First, the\nhistory of license plates shows that, insofar as license\nplates have conveyed more than state names and vehicle\nidentification numbers, they long have communicated\nmessages from the States. Cf. 555 U. S., at 470 (“Govern-\nments have long used monuments to speak to the public”).\nIn 1917, Arizona became the first State to display a graphic\non its plates. J. Fox, License Plates of the United States\n15 (1997) (Fox); J. Minard & T. Stentiford, A Moving\nHistory 56 (2004) (Minard). The State presented a depic-\ntion of the head of a Hereford steer. Fox 15; Minard 56.\nIn the years since, New Hampshire plates have featured\nthe profile of the “Old Man of the Mountain,” Massachu-\nsetts plates have included a representation of the Com-\nmonwealth’s famous codfish, and Wyoming plates have\ndisplayed a rider atop a bucking bronco. Minard 60, 61,\n66.\n   In 1928, Idaho became the first State to include a slogan\non its plates. The 1928 Idaho plate proclaimed “Idaho\nPotatoes” and featured an illustration of a brown potato,\nonto which the license plate number was superimposed in\ngreen. Id., at 61. The brown potato did not catch on, but\nslogans on license plates did. Over the years, state plates\nhave included the phrases “North to the Future” (Alaska),\n“Keep Florida Green” (Florida), “Hoosier Hospitality”\n(Indiana), “The Iodine Products State” (South Carolina),\n“Green Mountains” (Vermont), and “America’s Dairyland”\n(Wisconsin). Fox 13, 29, 39, 91, 101, 109. States have\nused license plate slogans to urge action, to promote tour-\nism, and to tout local industries.\n   Texas, too, has selected various messages to communi-\ncate through its license plate designs. By 1919, Texas had\nbegun to display the Lone Star emblem on its plates.\nTexas Department of Transportation, The History of\nTexas License Plates 9, 11 (1999).      In 1936, the State’s\ngeneral-issue plates featured the first slogan on Texas\n\f10            WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF \n\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nlicense plates: the word “Centennial.” Id., at 20. In 1968,\nTexas plates promoted a San Antonio event by including\nthe phrase “Hemisfair 68.” Id., at 46. In 1977, Texas\nreplaced the Lone Star with a small silhouette of the\nState. Id., at 63. And in 1995, Texas plates celebrated\n“150 Years of Statehood.” Id., at 101. Additionally, the\nTexas Legislature has specifically authorized specialty\nplate designs stating, among other things, “Read to Suc-\nceed,” “Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo,” “Texans\nConquer Cancer,” and “Girl Scouts.” Tex. Transp. Code\nAnn. §§504.607, 504.613, 504.620, 504.622. This kind of\nstate speech has appeared on Texas plates for decades.\n   Second, Texas license plate designs “are often closely\nidentified in the public mind with the [State].” Summum,\nsupra, at 472. Each Texas license plate is a government\narticle serving the governmental purposes of vehicle regis-\ntration and identification. The governmental nature of the\nplates is clear from their faces: The State places the name\n“TEXAS” in large letters at the top of every plate. More-\nover, the State requires Texas vehicle owners to display\nlicense plates, and every Texas license plate is issued by\nthe State. See §504.943. Texas also owns the designs on\nits license plates, including the designs that Texas adopts\non the basis of proposals made by private individuals and\norganizations. See §504.002(3). And Texas dictates the\nmanner in which drivers may dispose of unused plates.\nSee §504.901(c). See also §504.008(g) (requiring that\nvehicle owners return unused specialty plates to the\nState).\n   Texas license plates are, essentially, government IDs.\nAnd issuers of ID “typically do not permit” the placement\non their IDs of “message[s] with which they do not wish to\nbe associated.” Summum, 555 U. S., at 471. Consequently,\n“persons who observe” designs on IDs “routinely—and\nreasonably—interpret them as conveying some message\non the [issuer’s] behalf.” Ibid.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Indeed, a person who displays a message on a Texas\nlicense plate likely intends to convey to the public that the\nState has endorsed that message. If not, the individual\ncould simply display the message in question in larger\nletters on a bumper sticker right next to the plate. But\nthe individual prefers a license plate design to the purely\nprivate speech expressed through bumper stickers. That\nmay well be because Texas’s license plate designs convey\ngovernment agreement with the message displayed.\n   Third, Texas maintains direct control over the messages\nconveyed on its specialty plates. Texas law provides that\nthe State “has sole control over the design, typeface, color,\nand alphanumeric pattern for all license plates.”\n§504.005. The Board must approve every specialty plate\ndesign proposal before the design can appear on a Texas\nplate. 43 Tex. Admin. Code §§217.45(i)(7)–(8), 217.52(b).\nAnd the Board and its predecessor have actively exercised\nthis authority. Texas asserts, and SCV concedes, that the\nState has rejected at least a dozen proposed designs.\nReply Brief 10; Tr. of Oral Arg. 49–51. Accordingly, like\nthe city government in Summum, Texas “has ‘effectively\ncontrolled’ the messages [conveyed] by exercising ‘final\napproval authority’ over their selection.” 555 U. S., at 473\n(quoting Johanns, 544 U. S., at 560–561).\n   This final approval authority allows Texas to choose\nhow to present itself and its constituency. Thus, Texas\noffers plates celebrating the many educational institutions\nattended by its citizens. See Tex. Transp. Code Ann.\n§504.615. But it need not issue plates deriding schooling.\nTexas offers plates that pay tribute to the Texas citrus\nindustry. See §504.626. But it need not issue plates\npraising Florida’s oranges as far better. And Texas offers\nplates that say “Fight Terrorism.” See §504.647. But it\nneed not issue plates promoting al Qaeda.\n   These considerations, taken together, convince us that\nthe specialty plates here in question are similar enough to\n\f12            WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe monuments in Summum to call for the same result.\nThat is not to say that every element of our discussion in\nSummum is relevant here. For instance, in Summum we\nemphasized that monuments were “permanent” and we\nobserved that “public parks can accommodate only a lim-\nited number of permanent monuments.” 555 U. S., at 464,\n470, 478. We believed that the speech at issue was gov-\nernment speech rather than private speech in part be-\ncause we found it “hard to imagine how a public park\ncould be opened up for the installation of permanent mon-\numents by every person or group wishing to engage in that\nform of expression.” Id., at 479. Here, a State could theo-\nretically offer a much larger number of license plate de-\nsigns, and those designs need not be available for time\nimmemorial.\n   But those characteristics of the speech at issue in Sum-\nmum were particularly important because the government\nspeech at issue occurred in public parks, which are tradi-\ntional public forums for “the delivery of speeches and the\nholding of marches and demonstrations” by private citi-\nzens. Id., at 478. By contrast, license plates are not tradi-\ntional public forums for private speech.\n   And other features of the designs on Texas’s specialty\nlicense plates indicate that the message conveyed by those\ndesigns is conveyed on behalf of the government. Texas,\nthrough its Board, selects each design featured on the\nState’s specialty license plates. Texas presents these\ndesigns on government-mandated, government-controlled,\nand government-issued IDs that have traditionally been\nused as a medium for government speech. And it places\nthe designs directly below the large letters identifying\n“TEXAS” as the issuer of the IDs. “The [designs] that are\naccepted, therefore, are meant to convey and have the\neffect of conveying a government message, and they thus\nconstitute government speech.” Id., at 472.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              C\n   SCV believes that Texas’s specialty license plate designs\nare not government speech, at least with respect to the\ndesigns (comprising slogans and graphics) that were ini-\ntially proposed by private parties. According to SCV, the\nState does not engage in expressive activity through such\nslogans and graphics, but rather provides a forum for\nprivate speech by making license plates available to dis-\nplay the private parties’ designs. We cannot agree.\n   We have previously used what we have called “forum\nanalysis” to evaluate government restrictions on purely\nprivate speech that occurs on government property. Cor-\nnelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473\nU. S. 788, 800 (1985). But forum analysis is misplaced\nhere. Because the State is speaking on its own behalf, the\nFirst Amendment strictures that attend the various types\nof government-established forums do not apply.\n   The parties agree that Texas’s specialty license plates\nare not a “traditional public forum,” such as a street or a\npark, “which ha[s] immemorially been held in trust for the\nuse of the public and, time out of mind, ha[s] been used for\npurposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between\ncitizens, and discussing public questions.” Perry Ed. Assn.\nv. Perry Local Educators’ Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45–46 (1983)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “The Court has re-\njected the view that traditional public forum status ex-\ntends beyond its historic confines.” Arkansas Ed. Televi-\nsion Comm’n v. Forbes, 523 U. S. 666, 678 (1998). And\nstate-issued specialty license plates lie far beyond those\nconfines.\n   It is equally clear that Texas’s specialty plates are nei-\nther a “ ‘designated public forum,’ ” which exists where\n“government property that has not traditionally been\nregarded as a public forum is intentionally opened up for\nthat purpose,” Summum, supra, at 469, nor a “limited\npublic forum,” which exists where a government has\n\f14            WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n“reserv[ed a forum] for certain groups or for the discussion\nof certain topics,” Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of\nUniv. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829 (1995). A government\n“does not create a public forum by inaction or by permit-\nting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening a\nnontraditional forum for public discourse.” Cornelius, 473\nU. S., at 802. And in order “to ascertain whether [a gov-\nernment] intended to designate a place not traditionally\nopen to assembly and debate as a public forum,” this Court\n“has looked to the policy and practice of the government”\nand to “the nature of the property and its compatibility\nwith expressive activity.” Ibid.\n   Texas’s policies and the nature of its license plates\nindicate that the State did not intend its specialty license\nplates to serve as either a designated public forum or a\nlimited public forum. First, the State exercises final au-\nthority over each specialty license plate design. This\nauthority militates against a determination that Texas\nhas created a public forum. See id., at 803–804 (explain-\ning that a school mail system was not a public forum\nbecause “[t]he practice was to require permission from the\nindividual school principal before access to the system to\ncommunicate with teachers was granted”). Second, Texas\ntakes ownership of each specialty plate design, making it\nparticularly untenable that the State intended specialty\nplates to serve as a forum for public discourse. Finally,\nTexas license plates have traditionally been used for\ngovernment speech, are primarily used as a form of gov-\nernment ID, and bear the State’s name. These features of\nTexas license plates indicate that Texas explicitly associ-\nates itself with the speech on its plates.\n   For similar reasons, we conclude that Texas’s specialty\nlicense plates are not a “nonpublic for[um],” which exists\n“[w]here the government is acting as a proprietor, manag-\ning its internal operations.” International Soc. for Krishna\nConsciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672, 678–679 (1992).\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWith respect to specialty license plate designs, Texas is\nnot simply managing government property, but instead is\nengaging in expressive conduct. As we have described, we\nreach this conclusion based on the historical context,\nobservers’ reasonable interpretation of the messages\nconveyed by Texas specialty plates, and the effective\ncontrol that the State exerts over the design selection\nprocess. Texas’s specialty license plate designs “are meant\nto convey and have the effect of conveying a government\nmessage.” Summum, 555 U. S., at 472. They “constitute\ngovernment speech.” Ibid.\n   The fact that private parties take part in the design and\npropagation of a message does not extinguish the govern-\nmental nature of the message or transform the govern-\nment’s role into that of a mere forum-provider. In Sum-\nmum, private entities “financed and donated monuments\nthat the government accept[ed] and display[ed] to the\npublic.” Id., at 470–471. Here, similarly, private parties\npropose designs that Texas may accept and display on its\nlicense plates. In this case, as in Summum, the “govern-\nment entity may exercise [its] freedom to express its\nviews” even “when it receives assistance from private\nsources for the purpose of delivering a government-\ncontrolled message.” Id., at 468. And in this case, as in\nSummum, forum analysis is inapposite. See id., at 480.\n   Of course, Texas allows many more license plate designs\nthan the city in Summum allowed monuments. But our\nholding in Summum was not dependent on the precise\nnumber of monuments found within the park. Indeed, we\nindicated that the permanent displays in New York City’s\nCentral Park also constitute government speech. See id.,\nat 471–472. And an amicus brief had informed us that\nthere were, at the time, 52 such displays. See Brief for\nCity of New York in Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,\nO. T. 2008, No. 07–665, p. 2. Further, there may well be\nmany more messages that Texas wishes to convey through\n\f16             WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n               CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nits license plates than there were messages that the city in\nSummum wished to convey through its monuments.\nTexas’s desire to communicate numerous messages does\nnot mean that the messages conveyed are not Texas’s own.\n   Additionally, the fact that Texas vehicle owners pay\nannual fees in order to display specialty license plates\ndoes not imply that the plate designs are merely a forum\nfor private speech. While some nonpublic forums provide\ngovernments the opportunity to profit from speech, see,\ne.g., Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298, 299 (1974)\n(plurality opinion), the existence of government profit\nalone is insufficient to trigger forum analysis. Thus, if the\ncity in Summum had established a rule that organizations\nwishing to donate monuments must also pay fees to assist\nin park maintenance, we do not believe that the result in\nthat case would have been any different. Here, too, we\nthink it sufficiently clear that Texas is speaking through\nits specialty license plate designs, such that the existence\nof annual fees does not convince us that the specialty\nplates are a nonpublic forum.\n   Finally, we note that this case does not resemble other\ncases in which we have identified a nonpublic forum. This\ncase is not like Perry Ed. Assn., where we found a school\ndistrict’s internal mail system to be a nonpublic forum for\nprivate speech. See 460 U. S., at 48–49. There, it was\nundisputed that a number of private organizations, includ-\ning a teachers’ union, had access to the mail system. See\nid., at 39–40. It was therefore clear that private parties,\nand not only the government, used the system to com-\nmunicate. Here, by contrast, each specialty license plate\ndesign is formally approved by and stamped with the\nimprimatur of Texas.\n   Nor is this case like Lehman, where we found the adver-\ntising space on city buses to be a nonpublic forum. See\nR. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 390, n. 6 (1992) (identi-\nfying Lehman as a case about a nonpublic forum). There,\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe messages were located in a context (advertising space)\nthat is traditionally available for private speech. And the\nadvertising space, in contrast to license plates, bore no\nindicia that the speech was owned or conveyed by the\ngovernment.\n  Nor is this case like Cornelius, where we determined\nthat a charitable fundraising program directed at federal\nemployees constituted a nonpublic forum. See 473 U. S.,\nat 804–806. That forum lacked the kind of history present\nhere. The fundraising drive had never been a medium for\ngovernment speech. Instead, it was established “to bring\norder to [a] solicitation process” which had previously\nconsisted of ad hoc solicitation by individual charitable\norganizations. Id., at 792, 805. The drive “was designed\nto minimize . . . disruption to the [federal] workplace,” id.,\nat 805, not to communicate messages from the govern-\nment. Further, the charitable solicitations did not appear\non a government ID under the government’s name. In\ncontrast to the instant case, there was no reason for em-\nployees to “interpret [the solicitation] as conveying some\nmessage on the [government’s] behalf.” Summum, 555\nU. S., at 471.\n                              IV\n  Our determination that Texas’s specialty license plate\ndesigns are government speech does not mean that the\ndesigns do not also implicate the free speech rights of\nprivate persons. We have acknowledged that drivers who\ndisplay a State’s selected license plate designs convey the\nmessages communicated through those designs.              See\nWooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 717, n. 15, 715 (1977)\n(observing that a vehicle “is readily associated with its\noperator” and that drivers displaying license plates “use\ntheir private property as a ‘mobile billboard’ for the State’s\nideological message”). And we have recognized that the\nFirst Amendment stringently limits a State’s authority to\n\f18            WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF \n\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncompel a private party to express a view with which the\nprivate party disagrees. See id., at 715; Hurley v. Irish-\nAmerican Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston,\nInc., 515 U. S. 557, 573 (1995); West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v.\nBarnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943). But here, compelled\nprivate speech is not at issue. And just as Texas cannot\nrequire SCV to convey “the State’s ideological message,”\nWooley, supra, at 715, SCV cannot force Texas to include a\nConfederate battle flag on its specialty license plates.\n                       *    *    *\n   For the reasons stated, we hold that Texas’s specialty\nlicense plate designs constitute government speech and\nthat Texas was consequently entitled to refuse to issue\nplates featuring SCV’s proposed design. Accordingly, the\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit is\n                                               Reversed.\n\f\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Under our First Amendment cases, the dis-\ntinction between government speech and private speech is\ncritical. The First Amendment “does not regulate gov-\nernment speech,” and therefore when government speaks,\nit is free “to select the views that it wants to express.”\nPleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 467–468\n(2009). By contrast, “[i]n the realm of private speech or\nexpression, government regulation may not favor one\nspeaker over another.” Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors\nof Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 828 (1995).\n   Unfortunately, the Court’s decision categorizes private\nspeech as government speech and thus strips it of all First\nAmendment protection. The Court holds that all the\nprivately created messages on the many specialty plates\nissued by the State of Texas convey a government message\nrather than the message of the motorist displaying the\nplate. Can this possibly be correct?\n   Here is a test. Suppose you sat by the side of a Texas\n\f2                      WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF \n\n                       CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                            ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nhighway and studied the license plates on the vehicles\npassing by. You would see, in addition to the standard\nTexas plates, an impressive array of specialty plates.\n(There are now more than 350 varieties.) You would likely\nobserve plates that honor numerous colleges and universi-\nties. You might see plates bearing the name of a high\nschool, a fraternity or sorority, the Masons, the Knights of\nColumbus, the Daughters of the American Revolution, a\nrealty company, a favorite soft drink, a favorite burger\nrestaurant, and a favorite NASCAR driver.\n   As you sat there watching these plates speed by, would\nyou really think that the sentiments reflected in these\nspecialty plates are the views of the State of Texas and not\nthose of the owners of the cars? If a car with a plate that\nsays “Rather Be Golfing” passed by at 8:30 am on a Mon-\nday morning, would you think: “This is the official policy\nof the State—better to golf than to work?” If you did your\nviewing at the start of the college football season and you\nsaw Texas plates with the names of the University of\nTexas’s out-of-state competitors in upcoming games—\nNotre Dame, Oklahoma State, the University of Okla-\nhoma, Kansas State, Iowa State—would you assume that the\nState of Texas was officially (and perhaps treasonously)\nrooting for the Longhorns’ opponents? And when a car\nzipped by with a plate that reads “NASCAR – 24 Jeff\nGordon,” would you think that Gordon (born in California,\nraised in Indiana, resides in North Carolina)1 is the official\nfavorite of the State government?\n   The Court says that all of these messages are govern-\nment speech. It is essential that government be able to\nexpress its own viewpoint, the Court reminds us, because\notherwise, how would it promote its programs, like recy-\ncling and vaccinations? Ante, at 5–6.

And when Texas allows motorists to obtain a\nNotre Dame license plate but not a University of South-\nern California plate, it is taking sides in that long-time\nrivalry.\n   This capacious understanding of government speech\ntakes a large and painful bite out of the First Amendment.\nSpecialty plates may seem innocuous. They make motor-\nists happy, and they put money in a State’s coffers. But\nthe precedent this case sets is dangerous. While all li-\ncense plates unquestionably contain some government\nspeech (e.g., the name of the State and the numbers and/or\nletters identifying the vehicle), the State of Texas has\nconverted the remaining space on its specialty plates into\nlittle mobile billboards on which motorists can display\ntheir own messages. And what Texas did here was to\nreject one of the messages that members of a private\ngroup wanted to post on some of these little billboards be-\ncause the State thought that many of its citizens would\nfind the message offensive. That is blatant viewpoint\ndiscrimination.\n   If the State can do this with its little mobile billboards,\ncould it do the same with big, stationary billboards? Sup-\npose that a State erected electronic billboards along its\nhighways. Suppose that the State posted some govern-\nment messages on these billboards and then, to raise\nmoney, allowed private entities and individuals to pur-\nchase the right to post their own messages. And suppose\nthat the State allowed only those messages that it liked or\nfound not too controversial. Would that be constitutional?\n   What if a state college or university did the same thing\nwith a similar billboard or a campus bulletin board or\ndorm list serve? What if it allowed private messages that\nare consistent with prevailing views on campus but\nbanned those that disturbed some students or faculty?\n\f4              WALKER v.

License plates originated solely as a\nmeans of identifying vehicles. In 1901, New York became\nthe first State to require automobiles to be licensed, but\nrather than issue license plates itself, New York required\ndrivers to display their initials on their cars. J. Minard &\nT. Stentiford, A Moving History 50 (2004). Two years\nlater, Massachusetts became the first State to issue li-\ncense plates. The plates said “Mass. Automobile Register”\nand displayed the vehicle’s registration number. Id., at\n51. Plates of this type—featuring a registration number,\nthe name of the State, and sometimes the date—were the\nstandard for decades thereafter. See id., at 52–94; see also\ngenerally, J. Fox, License Plates of the United States 10–\n99 (1997).\n  Texas license plates initially followed this pattern.\nWhen the first official state plate appeared in 1917, it\nfeatured a number and the abbreviation “TEX.” Texas\nDepartment of Transportation, The History of Texas\nLicense Plates 9 (1999) (History). In 1925, the year of\nissue was added, and the State began issuing plates that\nidentified certain vehicle types, e.g., “C-M” for commercial\ntrucks (1925), id., at 14–15; “FARM” for farm trucks\n(1935), id., at 22; “Overwidth” (1949), id., at 32; “House\nTrailer” (1951), id., at 36. In 1936, a special plate with the\nword “CENTENNIAL” was created to mark the State’s\n100th birthday, and the first plate identifying the owner\nas a “State Official” appeared two years later. Id., at 20,\n25. Starting in the 1950’s, Texas began issuing plates to\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U.

Id., at 81. The proposal aimed to make\nthe State a profit, but it failed to pass. Ibid.\n   It was not until 1989 that anything that might be con-\nsidered a message was featured regularly on Texas plates.\nThe words “The Lone Star State” were added “as a means\nof bringing favorable recognition to Texas.” Id., at 82.\n   Finally, in the late 1990’s, license plates containing a\nsmall variety of messages, selected by the State, became\navailable for the first time. Id., at 101. These messages\nincluded slogans like “Read to Succeed,” “Keep Texas\nBeautiful,” “Animal Friendly,” “Big Bend National Park,”\n“Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo,” and “Lone Star\nProud.” Id., at 101, 113. Also issued in the 1990’s were\nplates bearing the names of colleges and universities, and\nsome plates (e.g., “State of the Arts,” “State Capitol Resto-\nration”) were made available to raise funds for special\npurposes. Id., 101.\n   Once the idea of specialty plates took hold, the number\nof varieties quickly multiplied, and today, we are told,\nTexas motorists can choose from more than 350 messages,\nincluding many designs proposed by nonprofit groups or\nby individuals and for-profit businesses through the State’s\nthird-party vendor.

Summum, 555 U. S. 460—the Court holds\nthat messages that private groups succeed in placing on\nTexas license plates are government messages. The Court\nbadly misunderstands Summum.\n   In Summum, a private group claimed the right to erect\na large stone monument in a small city park. Id., at 464.\nThe 2.5-acre park contained 15 permanent displays, 11 of\nwhich had been donated by private parties. Ibid. The\ncentral question concerned the nature of the municipal\ngovernment’s conduct when it accepted privately donated\nmonuments for placement in its park: Had the city created\na forum for private speech, or had it accepted donated\nmonuments that expressed a government message? We\nheld that the monuments represented government speech,\nand we identified several important factors that led to this\nconclusion.\n   First, governments have long used monuments as a\nmeans of expressing a government message. As we put it,\n“[s]ince ancient times, kings, emperors, and other rulers\nhave erected statues of themselves to remind their sub-\njects of their authority and power.” Id., at 470.

Thus, long experience has led the\npublic to associate public monuments with government\nspeech.\n  Second, there is no history of landowners allowing their\nproperty to be used by third parties as the site of large\npermanent monuments that do not express messages that\nthe landowners wish to convey. See id., at 471. While “[a]\ngreat many of the monuments that adorn the Nation’s\npublic parks were financed with private funds or donated\nby private parties,” “cities and other jurisdictions take\nsome care in accepting donated monuments” and select\nthose that “conve[y] a government message.” Id., at 471–\n472. We were not presented in Summum with any exam-\nples of public parks that had been thrown open for private\ngroups or individuals to put up whatever monuments they\ndesired.\n  Third, spatial limitations played a prominent part in our\nanalysis. See id., at 478–479. “[P]ublic parks can accom-\nmodate only a limited number of permanent monuments,”\nand consequently permanent monuments “monopolize the\nuse of the land on which they stand and interfere perma-\nnently with other uses of public space.” Ibid. Because\nonly a limited number of monuments can be built in any\ngiven space, governments do not allow their parks to be\ncluttered with monuments that do not serve a government\npurpose, a point well understood by those who visit parks\nand view the monuments they contain.\n  These characteristics, which rendered public monu-\nments government speech in Summum, are not present in\nTexas’s specialty plate program.\n\f10             WALKER v.

As we said in Summum, govern-\nments have used monuments since time immemorial to\nexpress important government messages, and there is no\nhistory of governments giving equal space to those wishing\nto express dissenting views. In 1775, when a large gilded\nequestrian statue of King George III dominated Bowling\nGreen, a small park in lower Manhattan,3 the colonial\ngovernor surely would not have permitted the construction\non that land of a monument to the fallen at Lexington and\nConcord. When the United States accepted the Third\nFrench Republic’s gift of the Statue of Liberty in 1877, see\nid., at 477, Congress, it seems safe to say, would not have\nwelcomed a gift of a Statue of Authoritarianism if one had\nbeen offered by another country. Nor is it likely that the\nNational Park Service today would be receptive if private\ngroups, pointing to the Lincoln Memorial, the Martin\nLuther King, Jr., Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans\nMemorial on the National Mall, sought permission to put\nup monuments to Jefferson Davis, Orval Faubus, or the\nNorth Vietnamese Army. Governments have always used\npublic monuments to express a government message, and\nmembers of the public understand this.\n  The history of messages on license plates is quite differ-\nent. After the beginning of motor vehicle registration in\n1917, more than 70 years passed before the proliferation of\nspecialty plates in Texas. It was not until the 1990’s that\nmotorists were allowed to choose from among 10 messages,\nsuch as “Read to Succeed” and “Keep Texas Beautiful.”\nHistory at 101.\n  Up to this point, the words on the Texas plates can be\nconsidered government speech. The messages were created\n——————\n  3 The Statue That Was Made Into Bullets, N. Y. Times Magazine,\n\nJuly 21, 1901, at p.6.\n\f                    Cite as: 576 U.

As the Court notes, some of these were\nissued well before “The Lone Star State” made its debut in\nTexas in 1991. Id., at 82. But this history is irrelevant for\npresent purposes. Like the 1991 Texas plate, these out-of-\nstate plates were created by the States that issued them,\nand motorists generally had no choice but to accept them.\nFor example, the State of New Hampshire made it a crime\nto cover up the words “Live Free or Die” on its plates. See\nWooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705 (1977).\n   The words and symbols on plates of this sort were and\nare government speech, but plates that are essentially\ncommissioned by private entities (at a cost that exceeds\n$8,000) and that express a message chosen by those enti-\nties are very different—and quite new. Unlike in Sum-\nmum, history here does not suggest that the messages at\nissue are government speech.\n                             2\n  The Texas specialty plate program also does not exhibit\nthe “selective receptivity” present in Summum. To the\ncontrary, Texas’s program is not selective by design. The\nBoard’s chairman, who is charged with approving designs,\n——————\n  4 This opinion does not address whether the unique combination of\n\nletters and/or numbers assigned to each vehicle, even when selected by\nthe motorist, is private speech.\n\f12             WALKER v.

And most of the time, the Board\n“base[s] [its] decisions on rules that primarily deal with\nreflectivity and readability.” Ibid. A Department bro-\nchure explains: “Q. Who provides the plate design? A.\nYou do, though your design is subject to reflectivity, legi-\nbility, and design standards.” Id., at 67.b.\n   Pressed to come up with any evidence that the State has\nexercised “selective receptivity,” Texas (and the Court)\nrely primarily on sketchy information not contained in the\nrecord, specifically that the Board’s predecessor (might\nhave) rejected a “pro-life” plate and perhaps others on the\nground that they contained messages that were offensive.\nSee ante, at 11 (citing Reply Brief 10 and Tr. of Oral Arg.\n49–51). But even if this happened, it shows only that the\npresent case may not be the only one in which the State\nhas exercised viewpoint discrimination.\n   Texas’s only other (also extrarecord) evidence of selectiv-\nity concerns a proposed plate that was thought to create a\nthreat to the fair enforcement of the State’s motor\nvehicle laws. Reply Brief 9–10 (citing publicly avail-\nable Transcript of Texas Department of Motor Vehicles\nBoard Meeting, Aug. 9, 2012, p. 112, online at http://\nwww.txdmv.gov/reports-and-data/doc_download/450–2012–\ntran-aug9). This proposed plate was a Texas DPS Troopers\nFoundation (Troopers) plate, proposed in 2012. The Board\nconsidered that proposed plate at an August 2012 meet-\ning, at which it approved six other plate designs without\ndiscussion, but it rejected the Troopers plate in a dead-\nlocked vote due to apparent concern that the plate could\ngive the impression that those displaying it would receive\nfavored treatment from state troopers. Id., at 109–112.\nThe constitutionality of this Board action does not neces-\nsarily turn on whether approval of this plate would have\nmade the message government speech. If, as I believe, the\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U.

Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at\n829.\n   Thus, even if Texas’s extrarecord information is taken\ninto account, the picture here is different from that in\nSummum. Texas does not take care to approve only those\nproposed plates that convey messages that the State\nsupports. Instead, it proclaims that it is open to all pri-\nvate messages—except those, like the SCV plate, that\nwould offend some who viewed them.\n   The Court believes that messages on privately created\nplates are government speech because motorists want a\nseal of state approval for their messages and therefore\nprefer plates over bumper stickers. Ante, at 10–11. This\nis dangerous reasoning. There is a big difference between\ngovernment speech (that is, speech by the government in\nfurtherance of its programs) and governmental blessing\n(or condemnation) of private speech. Many private speak-\ners in a forum would welcome a sign of government ap-\nproval. But in the realm of private speech, government\nregulation may not favor one viewpoint over another.\nRosenberger, supra, at 828.\n                             3\n  A final factor that was important in Summum was\nspace. A park can accommodate only so many permanent\nmonuments. Often large and made of stone, monuments\ncan last for centuries and are difficult to move. License\nplates, on the other hand, are small, light, mobile, and\ndesigned to last for only a relatively brief time. The only\nabsolute limit on the number of specialty plates that a\nState could issue is the number of registered vehicles. The\nvariety of available plates is limitless, too. Today Texas\noffers more than 350 varieties. In 10 years, might it be\n3,500?\n\f14            WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF \n\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\n   In sum, the Texas specialty plate program has none\nof the factors that were critical in Summum, and the\nTexas program exhibits a very important characteristic\nthat was missing in that case: Individuals who want to\ndisplay a Texas specialty plate, instead of the standard\nplate, must pay an increased annual registration fee.\nSee http://www.dmv.org/tx-texas/license-plates.php. How\nmany groups or individuals would clamor to pay $8,000\n(the cost of the deposit required to create a new plate) in\norder to broadcast the government’s message as opposed\nto their own? And if Texas really wants to speak out in\nsupport of, say, Iowa State University (but not the Univer-\nsity of Iowa) or “Young Lawyers” (but not old ones), why\nmust it be paid to say things that it really wants to say?\nThe fees Texas collects pay for much more than merely the\nadministration of the program.\n   States have not adopted specialty license plate programs\nlike Texas’s because they are now bursting with things\nthey want to say on their license plates. Those programs\nwere adopted because they bring in money. Texas makes\npublic the revenue totals generated by its specialty\nplate program, and it is apparent that the program\nbrings in many millions of dollars every year. See\nhttp://www.txdmv.gov/reports-and-data/doc_download/5050–\nspecialty-plates-revenue-fy-1994-2014.\n   Texas has space available on millions of little mobile\nbillboards. And Texas, in effect, sells that space to those\nwho wish to use it to express a personal message—\nprovided only that the message does not express a view-\npoint that the State finds unacceptable. That is not gov-\nernment speech; it is the regulation of private speech.\n                          III\n   What Texas has done by selling space on its license\nplates is to create what we have called a limited public\nforum. It has allowed state property (i.e., motor vehicle\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlicense plates) to be used by private speakers according to\nrules that the State prescribes. Cf. Good News Club v.\nMilford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106–107 (2001).\nUnder the First Amendment, however, those rules cannot\ndiscriminate on the basis of viewpoint. See Rosenberger,\n515 U. S., at 829 (quoting Cornelius v. NAACP Legal\nDefense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806 (1985)). But\nthat is exactly what Texas did here. The Board rejected\nTexas SCV’s design, “specifically the confederate flag\nportion of the design, because public comments have\nshown that many members of the general public find the\ndesign offensive, and because such comments are reason-\nable.” App. 64. These statements indisputably demon-\nstrate that the Board denied Texas SCV’s design because\nof its viewpoint.\n   The Confederate battle flag is a controversial symbol.\nTo the Texas Sons of Confederate Veterans, it is said to\nevoke the memory of their ancestors and other soldiers\nwho fought for the South in the Civil War. See id., at 15–\n16. To others, it symbolizes slavery, segregation, and\nhatred. Whatever it means to motorists who display that\nsymbol and to those who see it, the flag expresses a view-\npoint. The Board rejected the plate design because it\nconcluded that many Texans would find the flag symbol\noffensive. That was pure viewpoint discrimination.\n   If the Board’s candid explanation of its reason for reject-\ning the SCV plate were not alone sufficient to establish\nthis point, the Board’s approval of the Buffalo Soldiers\nplate at the same meeting dispels any doubt. The propo-\nnents of both the SCV and Buffalo Soldiers plates saw\nthem as honoring soldiers who served with bravery and\nhonor in the past. To the opponents of both plates, the\nimages on the plates evoked painful memories. The Board\nrejected one plate and approved the other.\n   Like these two plates, many other specialty plates have\nthe potential to irritate and perhaps even infuriate those\n\f16              WALKER v.

Fiala, ___ F. 3d ___, ___,\n2015 WL 2444501, *18 (CA2, May 22, 2015). Texas allows\na specialty plate honoring the Boy Scouts, but the group’s\nrefusal to accept gay leaders angers some. Virginia, an-\nother State with a proliferation of specialty plates, issues\nplates for controversial organizations like the National\nRifle Association, controversial commercial enterprises\n(raising tobacco and mining coal), controversial sports (fox\nhunting), and a professional sports team with a controver-\nsial name (the Washington Redskins). Allowing States to\nreject specialty plates based on their potential to offend is\nviewpoint discrimination.\n   The Board’s decision cannot be saved by its suggestion\nthat the plate, if allowed, “could distract or disturb some\ndrivers to the point of being unreasonably dangerous.”\nApp. 65. This rationale cannot withstand strict scrutiny.\nOther States allow specialty plates with the Confederate\nBattle Flag,5 and Texas has not pointed to evidence that\nthese plates have led to incidents of road rage or accidents.\nTexas does not ban bumper stickers bearing the image of\nthe Confederate battle flag. Nor does it ban any of the\nmany other bumper stickers that convey political messages\nand other messages that are capable of exciting the ire\nof those who loathe the ideas they express. Cf.

Argued March 23, 2015—Decided June 18, 2015\nTexas offers automobile owners a choice between general-issue and\n  specialty license plates. Those who want the State to issue a particu-\n  lar specialty plate may propose a plate design, comprising a slogan, a\n  graphic, or both. If the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board\n  approves the design, the State will make it available for display on\n  vehicles registered in Texas. Here, the Texas Division of the Sons of\n  Confederate Veterans and its officers (collectively SCV) filed suit\n  against the Chairman and members of the Board (collectively Board),\n  arguing that the Board’s rejection of SCV’s proposal for a specialty\n  plate design featuring a Confederate battle flag violated the Free\n  Speech Clause. The District Court entered judgment for the Board,\n  but the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that Texas’s specialty license\n  plate designs are private speech and that the Board engaged in con-\n  stitutionally forbidden viewpoint discrimination when it refused to\n  approve SCV’s design.\nHeld: Texas’s specialty license plate designs constitute government\n  speech, and thus Texas was entitled to refuse to issue plates featur-\n  ing SCV’s proposed design.

Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) This Court’s precedents regarding government speech provide\n    the appropriate framework through which to approach the case.\n    Pp. 6–17.\n         (1) The same analysis the Court used in Summum—to conclude\n    that a city “accepting a privately donated monument and placing it\n    on city property” was engaging in government speech, 555 U. S., at\n    464—leads to the conclusion that government speech is at issue here.\n    First, history shows that States, including Texas, have long used li-\n    cense plates to convey government speech, e.g., slogans urging action,\n    promoting tourism, and touting local industries. Cf. id., at 470. Se-\n    cond, Texas license plate designs “are often closely identified in the\n    public mind with the [State].” Id., at 472. Each plate is a govern-\n    ment article serving the governmental purposes of vehicle registra-\n    tion and identification. The governmental nature of the plates is\n    clear from their faces: the State places the name “TEXAS” in large\n    letters across the top of every plate. Texas also requires Texas vehi-\n    cle owners to display license plates, issues every Texas plate, and\n    owns all of the designs on its plates. The plates are, essentially, gov-\n    ernment IDs, and ID issuers “typically do not permit” their IDs to\n    contain “message[s] with which they do not wish to be associated,”\n    id., at 471. Third, Texas maintains direct control over the messages\n    conveyed on its specialty plates, by giving the Board final approval\n    over each design. Like the city government in Summum, Texas “has\n    effectively controlled the messages [conveyed] by exercising final ap-\n    proval authority over their selection.” Id., at 473. These considera-\n    tions, taken together, show that Texas’s specialty plates are similar\n    enough to the monuments in Summum to call for the same result.\n    Pp. 7–12.\n         (2) Forum analysis, which applies to government restrictions on\n    purely private speech occurring on government property, Cornelius v.\n    NAACP Legal Defense & Ed.

The par-\n    ties agree that Texas’s specialty license plates are not a traditional\n    public forum. Further, Texas’s policies and the nature of its license\n    plates indicate that the State did not intend its specialty plates to\n    serve as either a designated public forum—where “government prop-\n    erty . . . not traditionally . . . a public forum is intentionally opened\n\f                     Cite as: 576 U.

The State exercises final au-\n  thority over the messages that may be conveyed by its specialty\n  plates, it takes ownership of each specialty plate design, and it has\n  traditionally used its plates for government speech. These features of\n  Texas specialty plates militate against a determination that Texas\n  has created a public forum. Finally, the plates are not a nonpublic\n  forum, where the “government is . . . a proprietor, managing its in-\n  ternal operations.” International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc.\n  v. Lee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112781\"><a href=\"/opinion/112781/international-soc-for-krishna-consciousness-inc-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678–679. The fact that private parties take\n  part in the design and propagation of a message does not extinguish\n  the governmental nature of the message or transform the govern-\n  ment’s role into that of a mere forum provider. See Summum, supra,\n  at 470–471. Nor does Texas’s requirement that vehicle owners pay\n  annual fees for specialty plates mean that the plates are a forum for\n  private speech. And this case does not resemble other nonpublic fo-\n  rum cases. Perry Ed. Assn. v.

Pp. 13–17.\n    (c) The determination that Texas’s specialty license plate designs\n  are government speech does not mean that the designs do not also\n  implicate the free speech rights of private persons. The Court has\n  acknowledged that drivers who display a State’s selected license\n  plate designs convey the messages communicated through those de-\n  signs. See Wooley v.

The Court\n  has also recognized that the First Amendment stringently limits a\n  State’s authority to compel a private party to express a view with\n  which the private party disagrees. Just as Texas cannot require SCV\n  to convey “the State’s ideological message,” id., at 715, SCV cannot\n  force Texas to include a Confederate battle flag on its specialty li-\n  cense plates.

Those who want the\nState to issue a particular specialty plate may propose a\nplate design, comprising a slogan, a graphic, or (most\ncommonly) both. If the Texas Department of Motor Vehi-\ncles Board approves the design, the State will make it\navailable for display on vehicles registered in Texas.\n  In this case, the Texas Division of the Sons of Confeder-\nate Veterans proposed a specialty license plate design\nfeaturing a Confederate battle flag. The Board rejected\nthe proposal. We must decide whether that rejection\nviolated the Constitution’s free speech guarantees. See\nAmdts. 1, 14. We conclude that it did not.\n                           I\n\n                           A\n\n  Texas law requires all motor vehicles operating on the\nState’s roads to display valid license plates. See Tex.\nTransp. Code Ann. §§502.001 (West Supp. 2014), 504.001\n\f2             WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n(2013), 504.943 (Supp. 2014). And Texas makes available\nseveral kinds of plates. Drivers may choose to display the\nState’s general-issue license plates. See Texas Dept. of\nMotor Vehicles, Motor Vehicle Registration Manual 9.1\n(Apr. 2015). Each of these plates contains the word\n“Texas,” a license plate number, a silhouette of the\nState, a graphic of the Lone Star, and the slogan\n“The Lone Star State.” Texas Dept. of Motor Vehicles, The\nTexas Classic FAQs (July 16, 2012), online at\nhttp://www.txdmv.gov/motorists/license-plates (all Inter-\nnet materials as visited June 16, 2015, and available in\nClerk of Court’s case file). In the alternative, drivers may\nchoose from an assortment of specialty license plates.\n§504.008(b) (West 2013). Each of these plates contains the\nword “Texas,” a license plate number, and one of a selec-\ntion of designs prepared by the State. See ibid.; Specialty\nLicense Plates, http://www.txdmv.gov/motorists/license-\nplates/specialty-license-plates (displaying available Texas\nspecialty plates); Create a Plate: Your Design,\nhttp://www.myplates.com/BackgroundOnly (same). Finally,\nTexas law provides for personalized plates (also known\nas vanity plates). 43 Tex. Admin. Code §217.45(c)(7)\n(2015). Pursuant to the personalization program, a vehi-\ncle owner may request a particular alphanumeric pattern\nfor use as a plate number, such as “BOB” or “TEXPL8.”\n   Here we are concerned only with the second category of\nplates, namely specialty license plates, not with the per-\nsonalization program. Texas offers vehicle owners a va-\nriety of specialty plates, generally for an annual fee. See\n§217.45(b)(2). And Texas selects the designs for specialty\nplates through three distinct processes.\n   First, the state legislature may specifically call for the\ndevelopment of a specialty license plate. See Tex. Transp.\nCode §§504.602–504.663 (West 2013 and Supp. 2014). The\nlegislature has enacted statutes authorizing, for example,\nplates that say “Keep Texas Beautiful” and “Mothers\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAgainst Drunk Driving,” plates that “honor” the Texas\ncitrus industry, and plates that feature an image of the\nWorld Trade Center towers and the words “Fight Terror-\nism.” See §§504.602, 504.608, 504.626, 504.647.\n   Second, the Board may approve a specialty plate design\nproposal that a state-designated private vendor has\ncreated at the request of an individual or organization.\nSee §§504.6011(a), 504.851(a); 43 Tex. Admin. Code\n§217.52(b). Among the plates created through the private-\nvendor process are plates promoting the “Keller Indians”\nand plates with the slogan “Get it Sold with RE/MAX.”\n   Third, the Board “may create new specialty license\nplates on its own initiative or on receipt of an application\nfrom a” nonprofit entity seeking to sponsor a specialty\nplate. Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §§504.801(a), (b). A non-\nprofit must include in its application “a draft design of the\nspecialty license plate.” 43 Tex. Admin. Code\n§217.45(i)(2)(C). And Texas law vests in the Board author-\nity to approve or to disapprove an application. See\n§217.45(i)(7). The relevant statute says that the Board\n“may refuse to create a new specialty license plate” for a\nnumber of reasons, for example “if the design might be\noffensive to any member of the public . . . or for any other\nreason established by rule.” Tex. Transp. Code Ann.\n§504.801(c). Specialty plates that the Board has sanc-\ntioned through this process include plates featuring the\nwords “The Gator Nation,” together with the Florida\nGators logo, and plates featuring the logo of Rotary Inter-\nnational and the words “SERVICE ABOVE SELF.”\n                             B\n   In 2009, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Texas Divi-\nsion (a nonprofit entity), applied to sponsor a specialty\nlicense plate through this last-mentioned process. SCV’s\napplication included a draft plate design. See Appendix,\ninfra. At the bottom of the proposed plate were the words\n\f4             WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n“SONS OF CONFEDERATE VETERANS.” At the side\nwas the organization’s logo, a square Confederate battle\nflag framed by the words “Sons of Confederate Veterans\n1896.” A faint Confederate battle flag appeared in the back-\nground on the lower portion of the plate. Additionally,\nin the middle of the plate was the license plate number,\nand at the top was the State’s name and silhouette. The\nBoard’s predecessor denied this application.\n   In 2010, SCV renewed its application before the Board.\nThe Board invited public comment on its website and at\nan open meeting. After considering the responses, includ-\ning a number of letters sent by elected officials who op-\nposed the proposal, the Board voted unanimously against\nissuing the plate. The Board explained that it had found\n“it necessary to deny th[e] plate design application, specif-\nically the confederate flag portion of the design, because\npublic comments ha[d] shown that many members of the\ngeneral public find the design offensive, and because such\ncomments are reasonable.” App. 64. The Board added\n“that a significant portion of the public associate the con-\nfederate flag with organizations advocating expressions of\nhate directed toward people or groups that is demeaning\nto those people or groups.” Id., at 65.\n   In 2012, SCV and two of its officers (collectively SCV)\nbrought this lawsuit against the chairman and members\nof the Board (collectively Board). SCV argued that the\nBoard’s decision violated the Free Speech Clause of the\nFirst Amendment, and it sought an injunction requiring\nthe Board to approve the proposed plate design. The\nDistrict Court entered judgment for the Board. A divided\npanel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit re-\nversed.

And we have made clear that “the govern-\nment can speak for itself.” Southworth, supra, at 229.\n   That is not to say that a government’s ability to express\nitself is without restriction.

But,\nas a general matter, when the government speaks it is\nentitled to promote a program, to espouse a policy, or to\ntake a position. In doing so, it represents its citizens and\nit carries out its duties on their behalf.\n                             III\n  In our view, specialty license plates issued pursuant to\nTexas’s statutory scheme convey government speech.

S. ____ (2015)          7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreasoning rests primarily on our analysis in Summum, a\nrecent case that presented a similar problem. We con-\nclude here, as we did there, that our precedents regarding\ngovernment speech (and not our precedents regarding\nforums for private speech) provide the appropriate frame-\nwork through which to approach the case. See 555 U. S.,\nat 464.\n                              A\n   In Summum, we considered a religious organization’s\nrequest to erect in a 2.5-acre city park a monument setting\nforth the organization’s religious tenets. See id., at 464–\n465. In the park were 15 other permanent displays. Id.,\nat 464. At least 11 of these—including a wishing well, a\nSeptember 11 monument, a historic granary, the city’s\nfirst fire station, and a Ten Commandments monument—\nhad been donated to the city by private entities. Id., at\n464–465. The religious organization argued that the Free\nSpeech Clause required the city to display the organiza-\ntion’s proposed monument because, by accepting a broad\nrange of permanent exhibitions at the park, the city had\ncreated a forum for private speech in the form of monu-\nments. Brief for Respondent in Pleasant Grove City v.\nSummum, O. T. 2008, No. 07–665, pp. 2–3, 30–36.\n   This Court rejected the organization’s argument. We\nheld that the city had not “provid[ed] a forum for private\nspeech” with respect to monuments. Summum, 555 U. S.,\nat 470. Rather, the city, even when “accepting a privately\ndonated monument and placing it on city property,” had\n“engage[d] in expressive conduct.” Id., at 476. The speech\nat issue, this Court decided, was “best viewed as a form of\ngovernment speech” and “therefore [was] not subject to\nscrutiny under the Free Speech Clause.” Id., at 464.\n   We based our conclusion on several factors. First, his-\ntory shows that “[g]overnments have long used monuments\nto speak to the public.” Id., at 470. Thus, we observed\n\f8             WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF \n\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthat “[w]hen a government entity arranges for the con-\nstruction of a monument, it does so because it wishes to\nconvey some thought or instill some feeling in those who\nsee the structure.” Ibid.\n  Second, we noted that it “is not common for property\nowners to open up their property for the installation of\npermanent monuments that convey a message with which\nthey do not wish to be associated.” Id., at 471. As a re-\nsult, “persons who observe donated monuments routine-\nly—and reasonably—interpret them as conveying some\nmessage on the property owner’s behalf.” Ibid. And “ob-\nservers” of such monuments, as a consequence, ordinarily\n“appreciate the identity of the speaker.” Ibid.\n  Third, we found relevant the fact that the city main-\ntained control over the selection of monuments. We\nthought it “fair to say that throughout our Nation’s his-\ntory, the general government practice with respect to do-\nnated monuments has been one of selective receptivity.”\nIbid. And we observed that the city government in Sum-\nmum “ ‘effectively controlled’ the messages sent by the\nmonuments in the [p]ark by exercising ‘final approval\nauthority’ over their selection.” Id., at 473.\n  In light of these and a few other relevant considerations,\nthe Court concluded that the expression at issue was\ngovernment speech. See id., at 470–472. And, in reaching\nthat conclusion, the Court rejected the premise that the\ninvolvement of private parties in designing the monu-\nments was sufficient to prevent the government from\ncontrolling which monuments it placed in its own public\npark. See id., at 470–471. Cf. Rust, supra, at 192–196\n(upholding a federal regulation limiting speech in a\nGovernment-funded program where the program was\nestablished and administered by private parties).\n                         B\n    Our analysis in Summum leads us to the conclusion\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat here, too, government speech is at issue. First, the\nhistory of license plates shows that, insofar as license\nplates have conveyed more than state names and vehicle\nidentification numbers, they long have communicated\nmessages from the States. Cf. 555 U. S., at 470 (“Govern-\nments have long used monuments to speak to the public”).\nIn 1917, Arizona became the first State to display a graphic\non its plates. J. Fox, License Plates of the United States\n15 (1997) (Fox); J. Minard & T. Stentiford, A Moving\nHistory 56 (2004) (Minard). The State presented a depic-\ntion of the head of a Hereford steer. Fox 15; Minard 56.\nIn the years since, New Hampshire plates have featured\nthe profile of the “Old Man of the Mountain,” Massachu-\nsetts plates have included a representation of the Com-\nmonwealth’s famous codfish, and Wyoming plates have\ndisplayed a rider atop a bucking bronco. Minard 60, 61,\n66.\n   In 1928, Idaho became the first State to include a slogan\non its plates. The 1928 Idaho plate proclaimed “Idaho\nPotatoes” and featured an illustration of a brown potato,\nonto which the license plate number was superimposed in\ngreen. Id., at 61. The brown potato did not catch on, but\nslogans on license plates did. Over the years, state plates\nhave included the phrases “North to the Future” (Alaska),\n“Keep Florida Green” (Florida), “Hoosier Hospitality”\n(Indiana), “The Iodine Products State” (South Carolina),\n“Green Mountains” (Vermont), and “America’s Dairyland”\n(Wisconsin). Fox 13, 29, 39, 91, 101, 109. States have\nused license plate slogans to urge action, to promote tour-\nism, and to tout local industries.\n   Texas, too, has selected various messages to communi-\ncate through its license plate designs. By 1919, Texas had\nbegun to display the Lone Star emblem on its plates.\nTexas Department of Transportation, The History of\nTexas License Plates 9, 11 (1999).      In 1936, the State’s\ngeneral-issue plates featured the first slogan on Texas\n\f10            WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF \n\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nlicense plates: the word “Centennial.” Id., at 20. In 1968,\nTexas plates promoted a San Antonio event by including\nthe phrase “Hemisfair 68.” Id., at 46. In 1977, Texas\nreplaced the Lone Star with a small silhouette of the\nState. Id., at 63. And in 1995, Texas plates celebrated\n“150 Years of Statehood.” Id., at 101. Additionally, the\nTexas Legislature has specifically authorized specialty\nplate designs stating, among other things, “Read to Suc-\nceed,” “Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo,” “Texans\nConquer Cancer,” and “Girl Scouts.” Tex. Transp. Code\nAnn. §§504.607, 504.613, 504.620, 504.622. This kind of\nstate speech has appeared on Texas plates for decades.\n   Second, Texas license plate designs “are often closely\nidentified in the public mind with the [State].” Summum,\nsupra, at 472. Each Texas license plate is a government\narticle serving the governmental purposes of vehicle regis-\ntration and identification. The governmental nature of the\nplates is clear from their faces: The State places the name\n“TEXAS” in large letters at the top of every plate. More-\nover, the State requires Texas vehicle owners to display\nlicense plates, and every Texas license plate is issued by\nthe State. See §504.943. Texas also owns the designs on\nits license plates, including the designs that Texas adopts\non the basis of proposals made by private individuals and\norganizations. See §504.002(3). And Texas dictates the\nmanner in which drivers may dispose of unused plates.\nSee §504.901(c). See also §504.008(g) (requiring that\nvehicle owners return unused specialty plates to the\nState).\n   Texas license plates are, essentially, government IDs.\nAnd issuers of ID “typically do not permit” the placement\non their IDs of “message[s] with which they do not wish to\nbe associated.” Summum, 555 U. S., at 471. Consequently,\n“persons who observe” designs on IDs “routinely—and\nreasonably—interpret them as conveying some message\non the [issuer’s] behalf.” Ibid.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Indeed, a person who displays a message on a Texas\nlicense plate likely intends to convey to the public that the\nState has endorsed that message. If not, the individual\ncould simply display the message in question in larger\nletters on a bumper sticker right next to the plate. But\nthe individual prefers a license plate design to the purely\nprivate speech expressed through bumper stickers. That\nmay well be because Texas’s license plate designs convey\ngovernment agreement with the message displayed.\n   Third, Texas maintains direct control over the messages\nconveyed on its specialty plates. Texas law provides that\nthe State “has sole control over the design, typeface, color,\nand alphanumeric pattern for all license plates.”\n§504.005. The Board must approve every specialty plate\ndesign proposal before the design can appear on a Texas\nplate. 43 Tex. Admin. Code §§217.45(i)(7)–(8), 217.52(b).\nAnd the Board and its predecessor have actively exercised\nthis authority. Texas asserts, and SCV concedes, that the\nState has rejected at least a dozen proposed designs.\nReply Brief 10; Tr. of Oral Arg. 49–51. Accordingly, like\nthe city government in Summum, Texas “has ‘effectively\ncontrolled’ the messages [conveyed] by exercising ‘final\napproval authority’ over their selection.” 555 U. S., at 473\n(quoting Johanns, 544 U. S., at 560–561).\n   This final approval authority allows Texas to choose\nhow to present itself and its constituency. Thus, Texas\noffers plates celebrating the many educational institutions\nattended by its citizens. See Tex. Transp. Code Ann.\n§504.615. But it need not issue plates deriding schooling.\nTexas offers plates that pay tribute to the Texas citrus\nindustry. See §504.626. But it need not issue plates\npraising Florida’s oranges as far better. And Texas offers\nplates that say “Fight Terrorism.” See §504.647. But it\nneed not issue plates promoting al Qaeda.\n   These considerations, taken together, convince us that\nthe specialty plates here in question are similar enough to\n\f12            WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe monuments in Summum to call for the same result.\nThat is not to say that every element of our discussion in\nSummum is relevant here. For instance, in Summum we\nemphasized that monuments were “permanent” and we\nobserved that “public parks can accommodate only a lim-\nited number of permanent monuments.” 555 U. S., at 464,\n470, 478. We believed that the speech at issue was gov-\nernment speech rather than private speech in part be-\ncause we found it “hard to imagine how a public park\ncould be opened up for the installation of permanent mon-\numents by every person or group wishing to engage in that\nform of expression.” Id., at 479. Here, a State could theo-\nretically offer a much larger number of license plate de-\nsigns, and those designs need not be available for time\nimmemorial.\n   But those characteristics of the speech at issue in Sum-\nmum were particularly important because the government\nspeech at issue occurred in public parks, which are tradi-\ntional public forums for “the delivery of speeches and the\nholding of marches and demonstrations” by private citi-\nzens. Id., at 478. By contrast, license plates are not tradi-\ntional public forums for private speech.\n   And other features of the designs on Texas’s specialty\nlicense plates indicate that the message conveyed by those\ndesigns is conveyed on behalf of the government. Texas,\nthrough its Board, selects each design featured on the\nState’s specialty license plates. Texas presents these\ndesigns on government-mandated, government-controlled,\nand government-issued IDs that have traditionally been\nused as a medium for government speech. And it places\nthe designs directly below the large letters identifying\n“TEXAS” as the issuer of the IDs. “The [designs] that are\naccepted, therefore, are meant to convey and have the\neffect of conveying a government message, and they thus\nconstitute government speech.” Id., at 472.\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              C\n   SCV believes that Texas’s specialty license plate designs\nare not government speech, at least with respect to the\ndesigns (comprising slogans and graphics) that were ini-\ntially proposed by private parties. According to SCV, the\nState does not engage in expressive activity through such\nslogans and graphics, but rather provides a forum for\nprivate speech by making license plates available to dis-\nplay the private parties’ designs. We cannot agree.\n   We have previously used what we have called “forum\nanalysis” to evaluate government restrictions on purely\nprivate speech that occurs on government property. Cor-\nnelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800 (1985). But forum analysis is misplaced\nhere. Because the State is speaking on its own behalf, the\nFirst Amendment strictures that attend the various types\nof government-established forums do not apply.\n   The parties agree that Texas’s specialty license plates\nare not a “traditional public forum,” such as a street or a\npark, “which ha[s] immemorially been held in trust for the\nuse of the public and, time out of mind, ha[s] been used for\npurposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between\ncitizens, and discussing public questions.” Perry Ed.

And\nstate-issued specialty license plates lie far beyond those\nconfines.\n   It is equally clear that Texas’s specialty plates are nei-\nther a “ ‘designated public forum,’ ” which exists where\n“government property that has not traditionally been\nregarded as a public forum is intentionally opened up for\nthat purpose,” Summum, supra, at 469, nor a “limited\npublic forum,” which exists where a government has\n\f14            WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n“reserv[ed a forum] for certain groups or for the discussion\nof certain topics,” Rosenberger v.

A government\n“does not create a public forum by inaction or by permit-\nting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening a\nnontraditional forum for public discourse.” Cornelius, 473\nU. S., at 802. And in order “to ascertain whether [a gov-\nernment] intended to designate a place not traditionally\nopen to assembly and debate as a public forum,” this Court\n“has looked to the policy and practice of the government”\nand to “the nature of the property and its compatibility\nwith expressive activity.” Ibid.\n   Texas’s policies and the nature of its license plates\nindicate that the State did not intend its specialty license\nplates to serve as either a designated public forum or a\nlimited public forum. First, the State exercises final au-\nthority over each specialty license plate design. This\nauthority militates against a determination that Texas\nhas created a public forum. See id., at 803–804 (explain-\ning that a school mail system was not a public forum\nbecause “[t]he practice was to require permission from the\nindividual school principal before access to the system to\ncommunicate with teachers was granted”). Second, Texas\ntakes ownership of each specialty plate design, making it\nparticularly untenable that the State intended specialty\nplates to serve as a forum for public discourse. Finally,\nTexas license plates have traditionally been used for\ngovernment speech, are primarily used as a form of gov-\nernment ID, and bear the State’s name. These features of\nTexas license plates indicate that Texas explicitly associ-\nates itself with the speech on its plates.\n   For similar reasons, we conclude that Texas’s specialty\nlicense plates are not a “nonpublic for[um],” which exists\n“[w]here the government is acting as a proprietor, manag-\ning its internal operations.” International Soc. for Krishna\nConsciousness, Inc. v. Lee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112781\"><a href=\"/opinion/112781/international-soc-for-krishna-consciousness-inc-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678–679 (1992).\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWith respect to specialty license plate designs, Texas is\nnot simply managing government property, but instead is\nengaging in expressive conduct. As we have described, we\nreach this conclusion based on the historical context,\nobservers’ reasonable interpretation of the messages\nconveyed by Texas specialty plates, and the effective\ncontrol that the State exerts over the design selection\nprocess. Texas’s specialty license plate designs “are meant\nto convey and have the effect of conveying a government\nmessage.” Summum, 555 U. S., at 472. They “constitute\ngovernment speech.” Ibid.\n   The fact that private parties take part in the design and\npropagation of a message does not extinguish the govern-\nmental nature of the message or transform the govern-\nment’s role into that of a mere forum-provider. In Sum-\nmum, private entities “financed and donated monuments\nthat the government accept[ed] and display[ed] to the\npublic.” Id., at 470–471. Here, similarly, private parties\npropose designs that Texas may accept and display on its\nlicense plates. In this case, as in Summum, the “govern-\nment entity may exercise [its] freedom to express its\nviews” even “when it receives assistance from private\nsources for the purpose of delivering a government-\ncontrolled message.” Id., at 468. And in this case, as in\nSummum, forum analysis is inapposite. See id., at 480.\n   Of course, Texas allows many more license plate designs\nthan the city in Summum allowed monuments. But our\nholding in Summum was not dependent on the precise\nnumber of monuments found within the park. Indeed, we\nindicated that the permanent displays in New York City’s\nCentral Park also constitute government speech. See id.,\nat 471–472. And an amicus brief had informed us that\nthere were, at the time, 52 such displays. See Brief for\nCity of New York in Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,\nO. T. 2008, No. 07–665, p. 2. Further, there may well be\nmany more messages that Texas wishes to convey through\n\f16             WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n               CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nits license plates than there were messages that the city in\nSummum wished to convey through its monuments.\nTexas’s desire to communicate numerous messages does\nnot mean that the messages conveyed are not Texas’s own.\n   Additionally, the fact that Texas vehicle owners pay\nannual fees in order to display specialty license plates\ndoes not imply that the plate designs are merely a forum\nfor private speech. While some nonpublic forums provide\ngovernments the opportunity to profit from speech, see,\ne.g., Lehman v. Shaker Heights, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109090\"><a href=\"/opinion/109090/lehman-v-shaker-heights/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299 (1974)\n(plurality opinion), the existence of government profit\nalone is insufficient to trigger forum analysis. Thus, if the\ncity in Summum had established a rule that organizations\nwishing to donate monuments must also pay fees to assist\nin park maintenance, we do not believe that the result in\nthat case would have been any different. Here, too, we\nthink it sufficiently clear that Texas is speaking through\nits specialty license plate designs, such that the existence\nof annual fees does not convince us that the specialty\nplates are a nonpublic forum.\n   Finally, we note that this case does not resemble other\ncases in which we have identified a nonpublic forum. This\ncase is not like Perry Ed. Assn., where we found a school\ndistrict’s internal mail system to be a nonpublic forum for\nprivate speech. See 460 U. S., at 48–49. There, it was\nundisputed that a number of private organizations, includ-\ning a teachers’ union, had access to the mail system. See\nid., at 39–40. It was therefore clear that private parties,\nand not only the government, used the system to com-\nmunicate. Here, by contrast, each specialty license plate\ndesign is formally approved by and stamped with the\nimprimatur of Texas.\n   Nor is this case like Lehman, where we found the adver-\ntising space on city buses to be a nonpublic forum.

See 473 U. S.,\nat 804–806. That forum lacked the kind of history present\nhere. The fundraising drive had never been a medium for\ngovernment speech. Instead, it was established “to bring\norder to [a] solicitation process” which had previously\nconsisted of ad hoc solicitation by individual charitable\norganizations. Id., at 792, 805. The drive “was designed\nto minimize . . . disruption to the [federal] workplace,” id.,\nat 805, not to communicate messages from the govern-\nment. Further, the charitable solicitations did not appear\non a government ID under the government’s name.

The Court holds that all the\nprivately created messages on the many specialty plates\nissued by the State of Texas convey a government message\nrather than the message of the motorist displaying the\nplate. Can this possibly be correct?\n   Here is a test. Suppose you sat by the side of a Texas\n\f2                      WALKER v.

You would see, in addition to the standard\nTexas plates, an impressive array of specialty plates.\n(There are now more than 350 varieties.) You would likely\nobserve plates that honor numerous colleges and universi-\nties. You might see plates bearing the name of a high\nschool, a fraternity or sorority, the Masons, the Knights of\nColumbus, the Daughters of the American Revolution, a\nrealty company, a favorite soft drink, a favorite burger\nrestaurant, and a favorite NASCAR driver.\n   As you sat there watching these plates speed by, would\nyou really think that the sentiments reflected in these\nspecialty plates are the views of the State of Texas and not\nthose of the owners of the cars? If a car with a plate that\nsays “Rather Be Golfing” passed by at 8:30 am on a Mon-\nday morning, would you think: “This is the official policy\nof the State—better to golf than to work?” If you did your\nviewing at the start of the college football season and you\nsaw Texas plates with the names of the University of\nTexas’s out-of-state competitors in upcoming games—\nNotre Dame, Oklahoma State, the University of Okla-\nhoma, Kansas State, Iowa State—would you assume that the\nState of Texas was officially (and perhaps treasonously)\nrooting for the Longhorns’ opponents? And when a car\nzipped by with a plate that reads “NASCAR – 24 Jeff\nGordon,” would you think that Gordon (born in California,\nraised in Indiana, resides in North Carolina)1 is the official\nfavorite of the State government?\n   The Court says that all of these messages are govern-\nment speech. It is essential that government be able to\nexpress its own viewpoint, the Court reminds us, because\notherwise, how would it promote its programs, like recy-\ncling and vaccinations? Ante, at 5–6.

And when Texas allows motorists to obtain a\nNotre Dame license plate but not a University of South-\nern California plate, it is taking sides in that long-time\nrivalry.\n   This capacious understanding of government speech\ntakes a large and painful bite out of the First Amendment.\nSpecialty plates may seem innocuous. They make motor-\nists happy, and they put money in a State’s coffers. But\nthe precedent this case sets is dangerous. While all li-\ncense plates unquestionably contain some government\nspeech (e.g., the name of the State and the numbers and/or\nletters identifying the vehicle), the State of Texas has\nconverted the remaining space on its specialty plates into\nlittle mobile billboards on which motorists can display\ntheir own messages. And what Texas did here was to\nreject one of the messages that members of a private\ngroup wanted to post on some of these little billboards be-\ncause the State thought that many of its citizens would\nfind the message offensive. That is blatant viewpoint\ndiscrimination.\n   If the State can do this with its little mobile billboards,\ncould it do the same with big, stationary billboards? Sup-\npose that a State erected electronic billboards along its\nhighways. Suppose that the State posted some govern-\nment messages on these billboards and then, to raise\nmoney, allowed private entities and individuals to pur-\nchase the right to post their own messages. And suppose\nthat the State allowed only those messages that it liked or\nfound not too controversial. Would that be constitutional?\n   What if a state college or university did the same thing\nwith a similar billboard or a campus bulletin board or\ndorm list serve? What if it allowed private messages that\nare consistent with prevailing views on campus but\nbanned those that disturbed some students or faculty?\n\f4              WALKER v.

License plates originated solely as a\nmeans of identifying vehicles. In 1901, New York became\nthe first State to require automobiles to be licensed, but\nrather than issue license plates itself, New York required\ndrivers to display their initials on their cars. J. Minard &\nT. Stentiford, A Moving History 50 (2004). Two years\nlater, Massachusetts became the first State to issue li-\ncense plates. The plates said “Mass. Automobile Register”\nand displayed the vehicle’s registration number. Id., at\n51. Plates of this type—featuring a registration number,\nthe name of the State, and sometimes the date—were the\nstandard for decades thereafter. See id., at 52–94; see also\ngenerally, J. Fox, License Plates of the United States 10–\n99 (1997).\n  Texas license plates initially followed this pattern.\nWhen the first official state plate appeared in 1917, it\nfeatured a number and the abbreviation “TEX.” Texas\nDepartment of Transportation, The History of Texas\nLicense Plates 9 (1999) (History). In 1925, the year of\nissue was added, and the State began issuing plates that\nidentified certain vehicle types, e.g., “C-M” for commercial\ntrucks (1925), id., at 14–15; “FARM” for farm trucks\n(1935), id., at 22; “Overwidth” (1949), id., at 32; “House\nTrailer” (1951), id., at 36. In 1936, a special plate with the\nword “CENTENNIAL” was created to mark the State’s\n100th birthday, and the first plate identifying the owner\nas a “State Official” appeared two years later. Id., at 20,\n25. Starting in the 1950’s, Texas began issuing plates to\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U.

Id., at 81. The proposal aimed to make\nthe State a profit, but it failed to pass. Ibid.\n   It was not until 1989 that anything that might be con-\nsidered a message was featured regularly on Texas plates.\nThe words “The Lone Star State” were added “as a means\nof bringing favorable recognition to Texas.” Id., at 82.\n   Finally, in the late 1990’s, license plates containing a\nsmall variety of messages, selected by the State, became\navailable for the first time. Id., at 101. These messages\nincluded slogans like “Read to Succeed,” “Keep Texas\nBeautiful,” “Animal Friendly,” “Big Bend National Park,”\n“Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo,” and “Lone Star\nProud.” Id., at 101, 113. Also issued in the 1990’s were\nplates bearing the names of colleges and universities, and\nsome plates (e.g., “State of the Arts,” “State Capitol Resto-\nration”) were made available to raise funds for special\npurposes. Id., 101.\n   Once the idea of specialty plates took hold, the number\nof varieties quickly multiplied, and today, we are told,\nTexas motorists can choose from more than 350 messages,\nincluding many designs proposed by nonprofit groups or\nby individuals and for-profit businesses through the State’s\nthird-party vendor.

The Court\nbadly misunderstands Summum.\n   In Summum, a private group claimed the right to erect\na large stone monument in a small city park. Id., at 464.\nThe 2.5-acre park contained 15 permanent displays, 11 of\nwhich had been donated by private parties. Ibid. The\ncentral question concerned the nature of the municipal\ngovernment’s conduct when it accepted privately donated\nmonuments for placement in its park: Had the city created\na forum for private speech, or had it accepted donated\nmonuments that expressed a government message? We\nheld that the monuments represented government speech,\nand we identified several important factors that led to this\nconclusion.\n   First, governments have long used monuments as a\nmeans of expressing a government message. As we put it,\n“[s]ince ancient times, kings, emperors, and other rulers\nhave erected statues of themselves to remind their sub-\njects of their authority and power.” Id., at 470. Here in\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthe United States, important public monuments like the\nStatue of Liberty, the Washington Monument, and the\nLincoln Memorial, express principles that inspire and bind\nthe Nation together. Thus, long experience has led the\npublic to associate public monuments with government\nspeech.\n  Second, there is no history of landowners allowing their\nproperty to be used by third parties as the site of large\npermanent monuments that do not express messages that\nthe landowners wish to convey. See id., at 471. While “[a]\ngreat many of the monuments that adorn the Nation’s\npublic parks were financed with private funds or donated\nby private parties,” “cities and other jurisdictions take\nsome care in accepting donated monuments” and select\nthose that “conve[y] a government message.” Id., at 471–\n472. We were not presented in Summum with any exam-\nples of public parks that had been thrown open for private\ngroups or individuals to put up whatever monuments they\ndesired.\n  Third, spatial limitations played a prominent part in our\nanalysis. See id., at 478–479. “[P]ublic parks can accom-\nmodate only a limited number of permanent monuments,”\nand consequently permanent monuments “monopolize the\nuse of the land on which they stand and interfere perma-\nnently with other uses of public space.” Ibid. Because\nonly a limited number of monuments can be built in any\ngiven space, governments do not allow their parks to be\ncluttered with monuments that do not serve a government\npurpose, a point well understood by those who visit parks\nand view the monuments they contain.\n  These characteristics, which rendered public monu-\nments government speech in Summum, are not present in\nTexas’s specialty plate program.\n\f10             WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF\n               CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\n                              B\n                              1\n  I begin with history. As we said in Summum, govern-\nments have used monuments since time immemorial to\nexpress important government messages, and there is no\nhistory of governments giving equal space to those wishing\nto express dissenting views. In 1775, when a large gilded\nequestrian statue of King George III dominated Bowling\nGreen, a small park in lower Manhattan,3 the colonial\ngovernor surely would not have permitted the construction\non that land of a monument to the fallen at Lexington and\nConcord. When the United States accepted the Third\nFrench Republic’s gift of the Statue of Liberty in 1877, see\nid., at 477, Congress, it seems safe to say, would not have\nwelcomed a gift of a Statue of Authoritarianism if one had\nbeen offered by another country. Nor is it likely that the\nNational Park Service today would be receptive if private\ngroups, pointing to the Lincoln Memorial, the Martin\nLuther King, Jr., Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans\nMemorial on the National Mall, sought permission to put\nup monuments to Jefferson Davis, Orval Faubus, or the\nNorth Vietnamese Army. Governments have always used\npublic monuments to express a government message, and\nmembers of the public understand this.\n  The history of messages on license plates is quite differ-\nent. After the beginning of motor vehicle registration in\n1917, more than 70 years passed before the proliferation of\nspecialty plates in Texas. It was not until the 1990’s that\nmotorists were allowed to choose from among 10 messages,\nsuch as “Read to Succeed” and “Keep Texas Beautiful.”\nHistory at 101.\n  Up to this point, the words on the Texas plates can be\nconsidered government speech. The messages were created\n——————\n  3 The Statue That Was Made Into Bullets, N. Y. Times Magazine,\n\nJuly 21, 1901, at p.6.\n\f                    Cite as: 576 U.

As the Court notes, some of these were\nissued well before “The Lone Star State” made its debut in\nTexas in 1991. Id., at 82. But this history is irrelevant for\npresent purposes. Like the 1991 Texas plate, these out-of-\nstate plates were created by the States that issued them,\nand motorists generally had no choice but to accept them.\nFor example, the State of New Hampshire made it a crime\nto cover up the words “Live Free or Die” on its plates. See\nWooley v. Maynard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109638\"><a href=\"/opinion/109638/wooley-v-maynard/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1977).\n   The words and symbols on plates of this sort were and\nare government speech, but plates that are essentially\ncommissioned by private entities (at a cost that exceeds\n$8,000) and that express a message chosen by those enti-\nties are very different—and quite new. Unlike in Sum-\nmum, history here does not suggest that the messages at\nissue are government speech.\n                             2\n  The Texas specialty plate program also does not exhibit\nthe “selective receptivity” present in Summum. To the\ncontrary, Texas’s program is not selective by design. The\nBoard’s chairman, who is charged with approving designs,\n——————\n  4 This opinion does not address whether the unique combination of\n\nletters and/or numbers assigned to each vehicle, even when selected by\nthe motorist, is private speech.\n\f12             WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF \n\n               CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nexplained that the program’s purpose is “to encourage\nprivate plates” in order to “generate additional revenue for\nthe state.” Ibid., 58. And most of the time, the Board\n“base[s] [its] decisions on rules that primarily deal with\nreflectivity and readability.” Ibid. A Department bro-\nchure explains: “Q. Who provides the plate design? A.\nYou do, though your design is subject to reflectivity, legi-\nbility, and design standards.” Id., at 67.b.\n   Pressed to come up with any evidence that the State has\nexercised “selective receptivity,” Texas (and the Court)\nrely primarily on sketchy information not contained in the\nrecord, specifically that the Board’s predecessor (might\nhave) rejected a “pro-life” plate and perhaps others on the\nground that they contained messages that were offensive.\nSee ante, at 11 (citing Reply Brief 10 and Tr. of Oral Arg.\n49–51). But even if this happened, it shows only that the\npresent case may not be the only one in which the State\nhas exercised viewpoint discrimination.\n   Texas’s only other (also extrarecord) evidence of selectiv-\nity concerns a proposed plate that was thought to create a\nthreat to the fair enforcement of the State’s motor\nvehicle laws. Reply Brief 9–10 (citing publicly avail-\nable Transcript of Texas Department of Motor Vehicles\nBoard Meeting, Aug. 9, 2012, p. 112, online at http://\nwww.txdmv.gov/reports-and-data/doc_download/450–2012–\ntran-aug9). This proposed plate was a Texas DPS Troopers\nFoundation (Troopers) plate, proposed in 2012. The Board\nconsidered that proposed plate at an August 2012 meet-\ning, at which it approved six other plate designs without\ndiscussion, but it rejected the Troopers plate in a dead-\nlocked vote due to apparent concern that the plate could\ngive the impression that those displaying it would receive\nfavored treatment from state troopers. Id., at 109–112.\nThe constitutionality of this Board action does not neces-\nsarily turn on whether approval of this plate would have\nmade the message government speech. If, as I believe, the\n\f                 Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)          13\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nTexas specialty plate program created a limited public\nforum, private speech may be excluded if it is inconsistent\nwith the purpose of the forum. Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at\n829.\n   Thus, even if Texas’s extrarecord information is taken\ninto account, the picture here is different from that in\nSummum. Texas does not take care to approve only those\nproposed plates that convey messages that the State\nsupports. Instead, it proclaims that it is open to all pri-\nvate messages—except those, like the SCV plate, that\nwould offend some who viewed them.\n   The Court believes that messages on privately created\nplates are government speech because motorists want a\nseal of state approval for their messages and therefore\nprefer plates over bumper stickers. Ante, at 10–11. This\nis dangerous reasoning. There is a big difference between\ngovernment speech (that is, speech by the government in\nfurtherance of its programs) and governmental blessing\n(or condemnation) of private speech. Many private speak-\ners in a forum would welcome a sign of government ap-\nproval. But in the realm of private speech, government\nregulation may not favor one viewpoint over another.\nRosenberger, supra, at 828.\n                             3\n  A final factor that was important in Summum was\nspace. A park can accommodate only so many permanent\nmonuments. Often large and made of stone, monuments\ncan last for centuries and are difficult to move. License\nplates, on the other hand, are small, light, mobile, and\ndesigned to last for only a relatively brief time. The only\nabsolute limit on the number of specialty plates that a\nState could issue is the number of registered vehicles. The\nvariety of available plates is limitless, too. Today Texas\noffers more than 350 varieties. In 10 years, might it be\n3,500?\n\f14            WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF \n\n              CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\n   In sum, the Texas specialty plate program has none\nof the factors that were critical in Summum, and the\nTexas program exhibits a very important characteristic\nthat was missing in that case: Individuals who want to\ndisplay a Texas specialty plate, instead of the standard\nplate, must pay an increased annual registration fee.\nSee http://www.dmv.org/tx-texas/license-plates.php. How\nmany groups or individuals would clamor to pay $8,000\n(the cost of the deposit required to create a new plate) in\norder to broadcast the government’s message as opposed\nto their own? And if Texas really wants to speak out in\nsupport of, say, Iowa State University (but not the Univer-\nsity of Iowa) or “Young Lawyers” (but not old ones), why\nmust it be paid to say things that it really wants to say?\nThe fees Texas collects pay for much more than merely the\nadministration of the program.\n   States have not adopted specialty license plate programs\nlike Texas’s because they are now bursting with things\nthey want to say on their license plates. Those programs\nwere adopted because they bring in money. Texas makes\npublic the revenue totals generated by its specialty\nplate program, and it is apparent that the program\nbrings in many millions of dollars every year. See\nhttp://www.txdmv.gov/reports-and-data/doc_download/5050–\nspecialty-plates-revenue-fy-1994-2014.\n   Texas has space available on millions of little mobile\nbillboards. And Texas, in effect, sells that space to those\nwho wish to use it to express a personal message—\nprovided only that the message does not express a view-\npoint that the State finds unacceptable. That is not gov-\nernment speech; it is the regulation of private speech.\n                          III\n   What Texas has done by selling space on its license\nplates is to create what we have called a limited public\nforum. It has allowed state property (i.e., motor vehicle\n\f                  Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlicense plates) to be used by private speakers according to\nrules that the State prescribes. Cf. Good News Club v.\nMilford Central School, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118446\"><a href=\"/opinion/118446/good-news-club-v-milford-central-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106–107 (2001).\nUnder the First Amendment, however, those rules cannot\ndiscriminate on the basis of viewpoint. See Rosenberger,\n515 U. S., at 829 (quoting Cornelius v. NAACP Legal\nDefense & Ed. Fund, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 806 (1985)). But\nthat is exactly what Texas did here. The Board rejected\nTexas SCV’s design, “specifically the confederate flag\nportion of the design, because public comments have\nshown that many members of the general public find the\ndesign offensive, and because such comments are reason-\nable.” App. 64. These statements indisputably demon-\nstrate that the Board denied Texas SCV’s design because\nof its viewpoint.\n   The Confederate battle flag is a controversial symbol.\nTo the Texas Sons of Confederate Veterans, it is said to\nevoke the memory of their ancestors and other soldiers\nwho fought for the South in the Civil War. See id., at 15–\n16. To others, it symbolizes slavery, segregation, and\nhatred. Whatever it means to motorists who display that\nsymbol and to those who see it, the flag expresses a view-\npoint. The Board rejected the plate design because it\nconcluded that many Texans would find the flag symbol\noffensive. That was pure viewpoint discrimination.\n   If the Board’s candid explanation of its reason for reject-\ning the SCV plate were not alone sufficient to establish\nthis point, the Board’s approval of the Buffalo Soldiers\nplate at the same meeting dispels any doubt. The propo-\nnents of both the SCV and Buffalo Soldiers plates saw\nthem as honoring soldiers who served with bravery and\nhonor in the past. To the opponents of both plates, the\nimages on the plates evoked painful memories. The Board\nrejected one plate and approved the other.\n   Like these two plates, many other specialty plates have\nthe potential to irritate and perhaps even infuriate those\n\f16              WALKER v. TEXAS DIV., SONS OF \n\n                CONFEDERATE VETERANS, INC. \n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\nwho see them. Texas allows a plate with the words\n“Choose Life,” but the State of New York rejected such a\nplate because the message “ ‘[is] so incredibly divisive,’ ”\nand the Second Circuit recently sustained that decision.\nChildren First Foundation, Inc. v. Fiala, ___ F. 3d ___, ___,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2444501</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *18 (CA2, May 22, 2015). Texas allows\na specialty plate honoring the Boy Scouts, but the group’s\nrefusal to accept gay leaders angers some. Virginia, an-\nother State with a proliferation of specialty plates, issues\nplates for controversial organizations like the National\nRifle Association, controversial commercial enterprises\n(raising tobacco and mining coal), controversial sports (fox\nhunting), and a professional sports team with a controver-\nsial name (the Washington Redskins). Allowing States to\nreject specialty plates based on their potential to offend is\nviewpoint discrimination.\n   The Board’s decision cannot be saved by its suggestion\nthat the plate, if allowed, “could distract or disturb some\ndrivers to the point of being unreasonably dangerous.”\nApp. 65. This rationale cannot withstand strict scrutiny.\nOther States allow specialty plates with the Confederate\nBattle Flag,5 and Texas has not pointed to evidence that\nthese plates have led to incidents of road rage or accidents.\nTexas does not ban bumper stickers bearing the image of\nthe Confederate battle flag. Nor does it ban any of the\nmany other bumper stickers that convey political messages\nand other messages that are capable of exciting the ire\nof those who loathe the ideas they express. Cf. Good News\nClub, supra, at 111–112.\n                      *    *     *\n  Messages that are proposed by private parties and\nplaced on Texas specialty plates are private speech, not\n\n——————\n  5 See  http://www.dmv.virginia.gov/vehicles/#splates/category.asp?\ncategory=SCITTexas\n\f                Cite as: 576 U.
