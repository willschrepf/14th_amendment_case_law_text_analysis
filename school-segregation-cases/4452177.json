DISCIPLINARY R. PROFF’L CONDUCT Preamble, reprinted in TEX. GOV’T CODE\nANN., title 2, subtit. G, app. A. (Vernon 2013).\n\n          To support this goal of assuring that self-regulation is undertaken “in the\n\npublic interest” (rather than in self-interest), the system must always strive to be\n\ntransparent. Yet, that is exactly the opposite of what the State Bar Defendants\n\nseek in this case. They have insisted that the very rules put into place to implement\n\nself-regulation “in the public interest” actually prohibit a complaining member of\n\nthe public from learning why his grievance against a Texas attorney was\n\nsummarily dismissed with no explanation. There are no rules or laws, however,\n\nwhich prohibit the complaining party himself, from learning about his own\n\ngrievance and why it was dismissed.\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                       1\n\f                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       The procedural facts of this case are not in dispute. John Doe filed a\n\nsixteen-page grievance against a Texas-licensed attorney. The Chief Disciplinary\n\nCounsel (“CDC”) sent its recommendation regarding the grievance ex parte to the\n\nSummary Disposition Panel (“SDP”). The CDC then informed Complainant that\n\nhis grievance had been dismissed.\n\n       When Doe requested the CDC’s recommendation to the SDP (to understand\n\nwhy the CDC believed the allegations in his complaint did not surpass the low-\n\nthreshold of “just cause”), the CDC claimed that such a disclosure would violate\n\nTexas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure 2.16, which generally makes the grievance\n\nprocess confidential. Thus, the CDC has interpreted 2.16 as making the grievance\n\nprocess confidential, from the complainant himself.\n\n       This misinterpretation of 2.16 provided the basis for Doe’s declaratory\n\njudgment action, filed on May 30, 2014, against the State Bar of Texas,\n\nCommission for Lawyer Discipline, the State Bar of Texas, and Linda Acevedo in\n\nher Official Capacity as the Chief Disciplinary Counsel of the State Bar of Texas\n\n(collectively, “The State Bar Defendants”). C.R. 4-20.1 In his declaratory\n\njudgment action below, Doe sought to have the trial court declare that Texas Rules\n1\n Appellant will cite to the Clerk’s Record as “CR [Page No.]” and to the Reporter’s Record as\n“RR [Page No.]/[Line No.].”\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                               2\n\fof Disciplinary Procedure 2.16 does not apply to complainants, and the CDC\n\ncannot hide its recommendation to the SDP from the Complainant (Appellant).2\n\nC.R. 8 at ¶ 22. Doe also requested a declaration that Defendant Linda Acevedo, in\n\nher official capacity as the Chief Disciplinary Counsel of the CFLD, by and\n\nthrough her employee agents, acted without legal authority in denying Doe a copy\n\nof the CDC’s recommendation to the SDP on Doe’s grievance, and that as a result,\n\nhe is entitled to receive a copy of the recommendation. C.R. 9 at ¶ 23.\n\n         To avoid such a declaration, the State Bar Defendants filed a Motion to\n\nDismiss, which raised 5 separate arguments, and requested dismissal of the suit.\n\nC.R. 21-29. On July 23, 2014, a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss was held before\n\nthe Honorable Scott Jenkins. R.R. 1-40.\n\n       On October 8, 2014, an Order granting dismissal was signed. C.R. 88.\n\nHowever, the parties were not notified that the Order was granted, and did not\n\ndiscover the Order until December 5, 2014. Doe then filed an Unopposed Motion\n\nto Establish Notice of Judgment under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 306a (C.R.\n\n89-106), which the trial court signed on January 6, 2015 (C.R. 107), thus\n\n\n2\n  Along with his original declaratory judgment petition, Appellant filed below a Motion to Seal\nRecords, out of an abundance of caution, to maintain the confidentiality of the entire grievance\nproceeding. Oddly, the State Bar Defendants opposed the Motion to Seal, a position contrary to\ntheir underlying confidentiality arguments. Despite this opposition, the Trial Court granted the\nMotion to Seal (CR 31-32) ordering eleven separate documents sealed, including the original 16-\npage grievance. Thus, while not included in the Clerk’s Record, those sealed records are\navailable to this appellate court.\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                              3\n\festablishing that Doe first had notice of the October 8, 2014 Order on December 5,\n\n2014, and appellate deadlines would run from December 5, 2014. While the\n\nMotion to Establish Notice of Judgment was pending, out of an abundance of\n\ncaution, Doe filed his Notice of Appeal on December 31, 2014. Pursuant to the\n\nsigned Order granting the Motion to Establish Notice, Doe’s notice of appeal was\n\ntimely filed.\n\n                         SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      The trial court had jurisdiction over Does’s claims because the State Bar\n\nDefendants were not immune from suit under Texas Rules of Disciplinary\n\nProcedure 15.09 or under Sefzik. Furthermore, the trial court had jurisdiction\n\nbecause Does’s claims are justiciable, and because Does’s lawsuit does not seek to\n\nenjoin the grievance process.\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                  4\n\f                     ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      The Motion to Dismiss is properly characterized as a motion to dismiss for\n\nwant of jurisdiction. RR 6 at 9-10. Under Texas caselaw, the proper standard of\n\nreview is dictated by the substance of the issue to be reviewed as opposed to the\n\nprocedural vehicle through which that issue is developed. See Sheth v. Dearen,\n\n225 S.W.3d 828, 831 n. 2 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.) (citing\n\nIn re Doe, 19 S.W.3d 249, 253 (Tex. 2000); Valley Baptist Med. Ctr. v. Stradley,\n\n210 S.W.3d 770, 773 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2006, no pet.)). Each argument\n\nAppellees raised below as a basis for dismissal implicates jurisdiction. Thus, the\n\nstandard of review is de novo. See State v. Holland, 221 S.W.3d 639, 642 (Tex.\n\n2007).\n\nB.    The State Bar Defendants do not enjoy sovereign immunity from this\n      lawsuit.\n\n      The Motion to Dismiss argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because\n\nTexas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure 15.09 provides the State Bar Defendants\n\nwith complete immunity. C.R. 24 ¶6. But 15.09 applies to individuals, not entities,\n\nand thus the trial court should have rejected this argument. TEX. R. DISC. P. 15.09,\n\nreprinted in TEX.

G, app. A-1 (Vernon 2013).\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                    5\n\f      Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure 15.09 states, in relevant part, that all\n\n“members of the Commission, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel . . . all members of\n\nCommittees, all members of the Board of Disciplinary Appeals . . . are immune\n\nfrom suit for any conduct in the course of their official duties. Id. (emphases\n\nadded). “Member” means “one of the individuals composing a group.” MERRIAM-\n\nWEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY, Definition 2, available at www.merriam-\n\nwebster.com/dictionary/member (last visited July 17, 2014). The use of the term\n\n“their” also confirms that 15.09 applies to individuals, not entities. Thus, by its\n\nown terms, Rule 15.09 applies only to suits against individuals.\n\n      In the case at bar, Doe named as Defendants the Board of Directors of the\n\nState Bar and the Commission for Lawyer Discipline, neither of which is an\n\nindividual (or “member”), as contemplated by Rule 15.09. See C.R. 79; TEX. R.\n\nDISC. P. 15.09. Doe also named the Chief Disciplinary Counsel in her official\n\ncapacity, but a suit against her in her official capacity is not a suit against her as an\n\nindividual. See, e.g., Estate of Terrell v. Sisk, 111 S.W.3d 274, 282 (Tex. App.—\n\nTexarkana 2003, no pet.) (noting that an official-capacity suit against a\n\ngovernmental employee is not a suit against the employee but against his\n\nemployer). Accordingly, none of the named Defendants are “members,” or\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                       6\n\findividuals, as Rule 15.09 contemplates; therefore, Rule 15.09 does not apply, and\n\nthe trial court should have rejected this argument.3\n\n       At the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss (for the first time), the State Bar\n\nDefendants asserted that they were entitled to sovereign immunity as state\n\nagencies, citing Sefzik. See RR 15/20 (citing Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Sefzik, 355\n\nS.W.3d 618 (Tex. 2011). According to the State Bar Defendants, Sefzik confirmed\n\nthat the declaratory judgment act does not waive immunity, i.e. there must be a\n\nlegislatively-provided waiver for the claims at issue. See id. This general\n\nstatement of Sefzik’s holding is correct. However, Sefzik also made clear that\n\ndeclaratory judgment actions may be brought against the state or its officers in two\n\ninstances: (1) in actions against the state, and its agencies, which challenge the\n\nvalidity of a statute; and (2) in ultra vires claims against a state officer. Id. at 621–\n\n22.\n\n       Doe’s pleadings comply with Sefzik’s directives. In the present case, Doe\n\nprayed for (1) an interpretation that Rule 2.16 does not bar Doe from receiving a\n\ncopy of the CDC’s recommendation to the SDP, and (2) a declaration that\n\nDefendant Acevedo, in her official capacity as the Chief Disciplinary Counsel,\n\nacted ultra vires in denying Doe’s request for a copy of the CDC’s\n3\n Even if the Chief Disciplinary Counsel, who was sued in her official capacity, is considered an\nindividual to whom TRDP may apply, Complainant alleged that she acted ultra vires—without\nauthority—which means she could not have been acting “in the course of [her] official duties” as\nrequired for Rule 15.09 to apply. See TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY. P 15.09; see, e.g., C.R. 82 ¶18.\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                              7\n\frecommendation to the SDP. CR 83. Because both requests are allowed by Sefzik,\n\nthe trial court should have disregarded the State Bar Defendants’ argument. See id.\n\n\n\n\nC.    Doe has standing to bring this suit, which is not moot.\n\n      In their Motion to Dismiss, the State Bar Defendants asserted that (1) Doe\n\nfailed to plead an injury-in-fact; and (2) the issues are moot. Both points are\n\nincorrect. Because Doe properly alleged his specific and legally cognizable\n\ninterest affected by the State Bar Defendants’ actions, and because those actions\n\nwill be repeated time and again without being reviewed, the issues are justiciable,\n\nand the trial court has jurisdiction to decide them.\n\n      1. Injury\n\n      The State Bar Defendants argue that Doe alleged “no actual harm from any\n\nact of any of the Defendants.” C.R. 25 ¶8. In a declaratory judgment action, to\n\nestablish standing, a plaintiff must show actual or imminent harm to his own\n\nparticular interests. See Tex. Dep’t of Pub. Safety v. Salazar, 304 S.W.3d 896, 906\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 2009, no pet.) (citing Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. v. City\n\nof Dripping Springs, 304 S.W.3d 871, 882 (Tex. App.—Austin 2010, pet. denied)).\n\n      In his Second Amended Petition, Doe states that the State Bar Defendants’\n\nunauthorized action—denying his request for a copy of the CDC’s ex parte\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                     8\n\frecommendation to the SDP—prevents him from reviewing the CDC’s finding of\n\n“no just cause.” C.R. 82 ¶18. Thus, Doe cannot evaluate how his grievance failed,\n\nin Defendants’ estimation, to satisfy the very low “just cause” standard. Id.\n\nFurther, the “TRDP authorizes Plaintiff to file another grievance in this matter, but\n\nthe CDC’s unauthorized decision to hide its ex parte recommendation to the SDP\n\nrenders futile any effort to correct Plaintiff’s grievance in a new filing.”4 Id.; see\n\nTEX. R. DISC. P. 2.10. Thus, Doe’s interest in filing a new grievance is actually\n\nharmed by the State Bar Defendants’ unauthorized actions relating to their ex parte\n\nrecommendation. See Salazar, 304 S.W.3d at 906 (citation omitted).\n\n       2. Mootness\n\n       The Motion to Dismiss asserts that there is no live controversy because once\n\nthe SDP dismissed Doe’s grievance, the process ended and cannot be revisited.\n\nC.R. 25-26 ¶9. But because this case meets the “public interest” exception to the\n\nmootness doctrine—the questions involved in this case are of considerable public\n\nimportance, are capable of arising again between the same parties or other\n\n\n4\n To the extent the State Bar Defendants argue that Doe cannot assert a new grievance against\nthis attorney, and thus there is no need for Doe to review the ex parte recommendation, this\nargument fails under the language of TRDP 2.10. TRDP 2.10 does not limit the number of\ngrievances a complainant may file, so long as the grievance is classified as a “complaint.” TRDP\n2.10. The limitations of TRDP 2.10 apply only when the CDC classifies grievances as\n“inquiries,” and then circumscribe the number of attempts a complainant may make to have his\ngrievance classified as a complaint and not an inquiry. Id. TRDP 2.10’s restrictions simply do\nnot apply once the CDC classifies a grievance as a “complaint.” Id.\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                             9\n\fmembers of the public, and will continue to evade judicial review—this case is not\n\nmoot. See Univ. Scholastic League v. Buchanan, 848 S.W.2d 298, 304 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 1993, no writ).\n\n      Specifically, under the State Bar Defendants’ interpretation of Texas Rules\n\nof Disciplinary Procedure 2.16, a person complaining of attorney conduct—\n\nnormally a member of the public—will never have access to the CDC’s ex parte\n\nrecommendation to the SDP. Thus, the question in this case will arise again and\n\nagain, each time a grieving complaint’s grievance is summarily dismissed with no\n\nexplanation. Each time Defendants determine that the “just cause” standard has\n\nnot been met (in any grievance proceeding against any attorney), Defendants will\n\nagain refuse to provide a copy of their ex parte recommendation to the\n\ncomplaining party (who began the whole complaint process).\n\n      Moreover, following this pattern ensures that Defendants’ “no just cause”\n\ndetermination is never scrutinized, and the complaining member of the public\n\nnever knows why his grievance against the attorney did not meet that low standard.\n\n      In addition, whether the State Bar Defendants are permitted to hide their ex\n\nparte recommendation to the decision-maker from the complaining member of the\n\npublic—the very person who initiated the grievance process—is a question of\n\nconsiderable public importance. The State Bar Defendants will continue\n\nunjustifiably using Rule 2.16 to keep their ex parte recommendation from the\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                   10\n\fparties to a grievance proceeding and again, more importantly, keep their reasons\n\nto recommend dismissal from the very person making the complaint. Furthermore,\n\nas in this case, the SDP will continue to rule on the recommendations from the\n\nCDC before a court can intervene, thereby prohibiting review of the CDC’s ex\n\nparte recommendation and “no just cause” finding. For those reasons, this case\n\nsatisfies the “public interest exception” to the mootness doctrine, and the trial court\n\nhad jurisdiction to hear the pending declaratory judgment action.\n\nD.    This case does not seek to enjoin a grievance proceeding.\n\n      The State Bar Defendants argue generally that trial courts cannot enjoin\n\ngrievance proceedings, and claim this general proposition of law prevents this\n\nCourt from hearing this Declaratory Judgment action. But because Doe does not\n\nseek (and has never sought) to enjoin any grievance proceeding, this argument is\n\nmisplaced.\n\n      Defendants rely on State Bar of Texas v. Gomez, in which the plaintiffs\n\nasked a state district court to create a mandatory duty for attorneys to undertake\n\npro bono representations. 891 S.W2d 243, 246 (Tex. 1994). The supreme court\n\nnarrowly held that creating duties for attorneys is the sole province of the supreme\n\ncourt, and any attempt by a lower court to so regulate the legal profession is an\n\nimpermissible usurpation of the supreme court’s authority. Id. In other words, a\n\ntrial court cannot “promulgat[e] policies and regulations governing Texas\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                    11\n\flawyers.” Id. For that reason, in Gomez, the district court could not grant the relief\n\nrequested by the plaintiff—an injunction creating a mandatory pro bono program.\n\nId. Thus, because the district court could not grant the relief request, the case\n\nbefore it was not justiciable, and that court lacked jurisdiction. Id.\n\n       Gomez is inapposite to this case. Doe is not asking the trial court to create a\n\nnew rule, institute a new program, insert a new requirement, or promulgate a new\n\npolicy or regulation. All the trial court is asked to do is declare that disclosure to a\n\ncomplainant is not prohibited by Rule 2.16.\n\n       The State Bar Defendants also cite Favaloro v. Commission for Lawyer\n\nDiscipline, in which the plaintiff sought a court order enjoining the State Bar of\n\nTexas, the grievance committee, and others from enforcing the grievance rules\n\nagainst him. 13 S.W.3d 831, 836–37 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2000, no pet.). The\n\nDallas Court of Appeals rejected the plaintiff’s argument, holding that a district\n\ncourt does not have jurisdiction to enjoin the “grievance procedures authorized by\n\nthe State Bar Act.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n       Favaloro is likewise inapposite to this case. In this case, Doe is merely\n\nasking the Court to declare rights under a rule of disciplinary procedure. Unlike\n\nthe plaintiff in Favaloro, Doe is not seeking an order from the Court halting or\n\nforbidding the State Bar Defendants from enforcing the disciplinary rules against\n\nhim.\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                     12\n\f      Defendants cite no cases which have held that a district court may not\n\ninterpret a rule of disciplinary procedure, and the trial court is well-within its\n\npower to make such a declaration.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      The trial erred when it dismissed Doe’s claims for lack of jurisdiction, and\n\nthis Court should reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n                                       PRAYER\n\n      Appellant John Doe prays that this Court reverse the trial court’s dismissal\n\nand remand this case for further proceedings.\n\n\n                                  Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                  WEST, WEBB, ALLBRITTON & GENTRY, P.C.\n                                  1515 Emerald Plaza\n                                  College Station, Texas 77845-1515\n                                  Telephone: (979) 694-7000\n                                  Facsimile: (979) 694-8000\n\n                                       /s/ Gaines West\n                                  By:________________________\n                                    GAINES WEST\n                                    State Bar No. 21197500\n                                    gaines.west@westwebblaw.com\n\n                                     JENNIFER D.

Favaloro does         with appropriate citations to authorities and the *840\nnot direct us to any place in the record where he objected to      record. See TEX.R.APP. P. 74(f) (former rules). Because,\nthe jury charge and obtained a ruling.

A comparison of these documents         preserve these arguments for review. See Trenholm v. Ratcliff,\nshows that the judgment stated Favaloro had violated rules         646 S.W.2d 927, 934 (Tex.1983); Bowles v.

In all other civil cases, the repealed rules\n        apply. In this case, the appeal was perfected on April 17, 1996, and Favaloro's brief was filed on February 7, 1997.

Because           the undisputed facts provided by the minor.

And as we have said before,\nas the Court has construed it, I conclude this case presents           trial courts have no discretion in determining what the law is\nexceptional circumstances warranting a remand.                         or in applying the law to the facts. 2\n\nI join the Court's construction of the statutory phrase “mature        Thus, in these unique, non-adversarial, parental notification\nand sufficiently well-informed to make the decision to have            proceedings, I would hold that Texas appellate courts must\nan abortion performed without notification to either of her            review a trial court's decision under an abuse of discretion\nparents.” 1 But I do not agree that the standard of review             standard.

The two lawsuits were consolidated in early 2003. Friendship Alliance settled its lawsuit in 2004 after\n       certain amendments to the Agreements had been negotiated.\n3      SOS Alliance has dismissed its claims against Cypress–Hays, which is no longer a party to this case.

The\n       Development Agreements were approved in April 2001. This lawsuit was filed in November 2002. SOS Alliance has not asserted\n       any claims under section 26.177, nor could it have. Moreover, SOS Alliance does not allege any other statute on which its standing\n       to assert its claims not related to the Open Meetings Act might be based.\n6      We note that this Court's holding in Texas Rivers that harm for purposes of standing may be “economic, recreational, or\n       environmental” appears to be connected to federal case law in which a federal statute protected such interests. The Texas case from\n       which the “economic, recreational, or environmental” language originates is Housing Authority of Harlingen v. State in its general\n       statement of the test for standing. 539 S.W.2d 911, 913–14 (Tex.Civ.App.-Corpus Christi 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.). As authority for\n       the language, the court in Housing Authority of Harlingen cited several United States Supreme Court opinions, and appears to have\n       taken its description of the scope of an injury in fact from Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397\n       U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). In that case, the Supreme Court observed that the legal interest required for purposes\n       of standing “may reflect ‘aesthetic, conservational, and recreational’ as well as economic values,” provided that “the interest sought\n       to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional\n       guarantee in question.” 397 U.S. at 153–54, 90 S.Ct. 827.\n7      SOS Alliance contends that this conclusion ignores SOS Alliance's “long and proud history” of obtaining standing to challenge\n       government actions. SOS Alliance relies on Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. v. Lowry, 934 S.W.2d 161 (Tex.App.-Austin 1996, orig.\n       proceeding), as indicative of such standing. However, that case involved standing based on a statute—the Texas Open Meetings Act.\n       See 934 S.W.2d at 162. That Act authorizes an “interested person” to file suit. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 551.142(a) (West 2004).\n       According to Lowry, this statutory provision dispenses with the standing requirement of an injury distinct from that of the general\n       public. Lowry, 934 S.W.2d at 163.\n          Similarly, the San Marcos River Foundation (SMRF) filed a letter brief as amicus curiae, expressing its concern that a determination\n          in this case that SOS Alliance does not have standing based on environmental harm would impair SMRF's future ability to litigate.\n          We note that in City of San Marcos v. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality—by which, SMRF asserts, it was successful in\n          protecting the San Marcos River—a statute specifically authorized judicial review. 128 S.W.3d 264, 266 (Tex.App.-Austin 2004,\n          pet. denied) (citing Tex. Water Code Ann. § 5.351 (West 2008)). Thus, our adjudication of SOS Alliance's standing in the absence\n          of such statutory provision will not likely affect SMRF's future ability to again file suit under the same statute.\n8      SOS Alliance argues that it should not be required to “hire experts to map and calculate local hydrogeological flows to engage in\n       debates about gradients of flows” at this stage. Whether or not this is the case, SOS Alliance must at least provide evidence that\n       a member “used an area subject to contamination from the discharge.” American Canoe Ass'n, 326 F.3d at 520. In the cases SOS\n       Alliance cites on this issue, unlike here, there was evidence from which the court could find that the consequences of the challenged\n       action of the defendant would in fact extend to the plaintiff. See id. (members' use of river was downstream from polluting defendant);\n       Barshop v. Medina County Underground Water Conservation Dist., 925 S.W.2d 618, 624, 627 (Tex.1996) (landowner over Edwards\n       Aquifer challenges constitutionality of statute governing entire aquifer); City of Canyon v. McBroom, 121 S.W.3d 410, 415 (Tex.App.-\n       Amarillo 2003, no pet.) (landowner in flood plain complaining of increased risk of flooding); Lake Medina Conservation Soc'y\n       v. Texas Natural Res. Conservation Comm'n, 980 S.W.2d 511, 515–16 (Tex.App.-Austin 1998, pet. denied) (owners of lakefront\n       property challenging removal of water from lake); Texas Rivers Prot. Ass'n v. Texas Natural Res. Conservation Comm'n, 910 S.W.2d\n       147, 151 (Tex.App.-Austin 1995, writ denied) (property owners “fronting the affected area of the river” challenging diversion of\n       water from river).\n9      In fact, it appears more feasible that many of these members' interests as landowners might even be contrary to SOS Alliance's\n       purpose. SOS Alliance would likely welcome declining property values if they would enable SOS Alliance to place more watershed\n       land into long-term conservation easements, and would likely welcome inconveniences such as increased traffic and light if the result\n       was surrounding areas becoming less desirable for home buyers and future real estate developers. Moreover, in the event that Mak\n       Foster and Cypress Hays successfully develop their properties in accordance with the Development Agreements, we question whether\n       SOS Alliance would subsequently seek to protect those developments' interests in increasing property values as well.\n10     In its second point on appeal, SOS Alliance contends that the district court erred in granting appellees' pleas to the jurisdiction based\n       on the case not being ripe for adjudication as to any land that had not become subject to a finally approved plat, and based on the\n       case being moot as to land that was subject to a finally approved plat that SOS Alliance neither appealed nor challenged. Given that\n       we have determined that the court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction based on standing, we need not consider the issues of\n       ripeness or mootness.\n11     SOS Alliance alleges that the Cypress–Hays Development Agreement contains more than 32 variances, including reduction of\n       minimum lot size, reduction of minimum setbacks, and reduction of plat review and approval time.\n12     In fact, given that the Development Agreements were apparently without precedent as to the City (SOS Alliance itself describes\n       the developments as “unprecedented in size and density for Dripping Springs”), it appears that the City actually followed its usual\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The second notice—for the Mak Foster Development Agreement—was essentially identical to the first notice\n       —for the Cypress Hays Development Agreement.\n13     Appellees argue that any potential violations of the Act were validated by the legislature in 2003. See Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann.\n       § 212.172(h) (West 2008) (“An agreement between a municipality and a landowner entered into prior to the effective date of this\n       section and that complies with this section is validated.”). Because we conclude that SOS Alliance has not shown a violation of the\n       Act, we need not address this argument\n14     Due to a partial settlement between SOS Alliance and the City, SOS Alliance does not seek appellate review of the attorneys' fees\n       awarded to the City.\n15     Neither of the cases cited by SOS Alliance suggests otherwise. In Gregg County Appraisal District v. Laidlaw Waste Systems, Inc.,\n       the statute at issue allowed attorneys' fees for a property owner who prevailed in his tax appeal. 907 S.W.2d 12, 21 (Tex.App.-Tyler\n       1995, writ denied). To the extent the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the owner's claims, he did not “prevail” and, therefore,\n       by statute was not entitled to attorneys' fees. Id. In Lipshy Motorcars, Inc. v. Sovereign Associates, Inc., 944 S.W.2d 68 (Tex.App.-\n       Dallas 1997, no writ), an appellate court determined it had no jurisdiction to consider a motion for sanctions and attorneys' fees\n       against an appellant who attempted to appeal a non-appealable interlocutory order. 944 S.W.2d at 70–72.\n16     According to Mak Foster, SOS Alliance represented in its motion to consolidate that the plaintiffs' lawsuits were “based on identical\n       facts and circumstances,” asked for “identical declaratory and nearly identical injunctive relief,” and were based on “identical legal\n       grounds.”\n1      In Coastal Habitat Alliance, this Court also cites Cantrell v. City of Long Beach, 241 F.3d 674, 681 (9th Cir.2001) (“That the litigant's\n       interest [for purposes of standing] must be greater than that of the public at large does not imply that the interest must be a substantive\n       right sounding in property or contract.”), to support its conclusion that “[w]hether a plaintiff has standing in federal courts to assert\n       a cause of action is not indicative of the deprivation of a vested property right.” Coastal Habitat Alliance v. Public Util. Comm'n,\n       294 S.W.3d 276, 287 (Tex.App.-Austin 2009, no pet.).\n2      In Summers, the government conceded that affidavits that a member had “repeatedly visited” a particular public site, that he had\n       “imminent plans to do so again,” and that “his interests in viewing the flora and fauna of the area” would be harmed were sufficient to\n       establish standing under Article III.

Nealon, our sister court, in analyzing the appellee's 101.106(f) motion to dismiss, stated that “the proper standard of\n      review for a motion to dismiss is abuse of discretion.” 199 S.W.3d at 465. To the extent the court was holding that all motions to\n      dismiss are reviewed for abuse of discretion, we disagree. The proper standard of review to be employed is dictated by the substance\n      of the issue to be reviewed as opposed to the procedural vehicle through which that issue is developed. See In re Doe, 19 S.W.3d\n      249, 253 (Tex.2000) (stating that, in order to determine the proper standard of review, “we must determine whether the [issue] is\n      a question of law or fact”); Valley Baptist Med. Ctr. v. Stradley, 210 S.W.3d 770, 773 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2006, pet. filed)\n      (finding that, while motions to dismiss are generally reviewed for abuse of discretion, the issue of whether plaintiff's claim is a health\n      care liability claim in accordance with the statute at issue is a question of law and is thus reviewed de novo ). Because the issue in\n      this case—waiver of sovereign immunity—is legal in nature, we apply the de novo standard.\n3     To the extent there is a distinction, Dearen apparently intended to allege that Dr. Sheth failed to align the nail hole and the jig to\n      permit the placement of the distal interlocking screw. As the expert's report states, the procedure itself was called an “intramedullary\n      nailing” and involved the placement of a short Gamma nail which requires a distal interlocking screw to “lock” the nail in place.\n      Dearen's amended petition further clarifies this by alleging the same facts, but substituting the term “distal interlocking screw” for\n      “intramedullary hip screw.”\n4     Both Dearen, in his amended petition, and Dearen's expert, in his report, stated that the nail “requires the distal interlocking screw\n      for stability (emphasis added).”\n5     White also argued that the pump's use on his property caused the damages, however, this claim was not considered by the court\n      because it involved factual allegations first raised on appeal. White, 46 S.W.3d at 870.\n6     Dr. Sheth argues that once he filed his motion to dismiss pursuant to 101.016(f), his right to dismissal was perfected and any\n      subsequent pleadings by Dearen could not effect that right. See Villasan v. O'Rourke, 166 S.W.3d 752, 758 (Tex.App.-Beaumont\n      2005, pet. filed) (finding that the defendant's right to dismissal under 101.106(e) was perfected upon the filing of his motion to dismiss\n      and any subsequent pleadings “do not moot the right created by the filing of the motion under section 101.106”). Because we find\n      that the amended petition provides no additional value, we need not address this argument.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                     © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See 284 S.W.3d at 373. Therefore, even if we determine that the Appellees have\n       raised a valid ultra vires claim with respect to the September 2008 memorandum, that claim remains barred by sovereign immunity\n       to the extent it is brought against any party other than the Director of the Department.\n7      To the extent the Appellees also seek relief under the UDJA in connection with these rule challenges, we dismiss those claims for\n       want of jurisdiction on the ground that a party may not seek relief under the UDJA when such relief would be redundant to relief\n       under the APA. See Texas State Bd. of Plumbing Exam'rs v. Associated Plumbing–Heating–Cooling Contractors of Tex., Inc., 31\n       S.W.3d 750, 753 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, pet. dism'd by agr.) (“When a plaintiff files a proceeding that only challenges the validity\n       of an administrative rule, the parties are bound by the APA and may not seek relief under the UDJA because such relief would be\n       redundant.”).\n8      For the same reason, even if we considered Gomez's rule challenge to be a valid ultra vires claim under the UDJA, he has failed to\n       establish a justiciable controversy and therefore lacks standing under the UDJA as well.\n9      Like Gomez, Galvan has also failed to establish a justiciable controversy that would give him standing under the UDJA in the event\n       of a valid ultra vires claim regarding the Department's rules.\n10     In light of our holding on the jurisdictional question, we need only determine whether Green Meadows, Salazar, Soria, and Trejo\n       established the elements necessary to entitle them to a temporary injunction, as the remaining appellees have been dismissed.\n11     Based on the testimony provided at the temporary-injunction hearing, it appears that Salazar holds a license from Mexico, but that\n       Soria and Trejo do not. However, the question at issue here is whether an adequate remedy is available, not whether the parties have\n       actually availed themselves of that remedy. Furthermore, “[t]he lack of an adequate remedy is not shown by the mere fact that the\n       remedy provided would involve more expense or delay.” Kendall Appraisal Dist. v.

The relief he seeks\n       —a declaration that he is entitled to a hearing—is directly related to whether Behrens acted outside the scope of his authority in\n       denying a hearing. That is, Sefzik ultimately wishes to compel a government official (Behrens) to perform some act that he considers\n       to be nondiscretionary (holding a hearing).

For reasons discussed later in this opinion,\n       we decline to dismiss the appeal as moot.\n2      The ARD Committee is composed of, at a minimum, a school administrator, a special education teacher, a regular education teacher,\n       and the child's parent. Other persons may be included in the ARD Committee if determined to be necessary. One of the functions of the\n       ARD Committee is to develop an individualized educational plan (IEP) for the student. Buchanan's IEP did not include interscholastic\n       football as part of his program. Buchanan never petitioned for an administrative appeal of the decision of the ARD Committee to the\n       Texas Education Agency. Buchanan's mother testified that because the ARD Committee recommended a waiver from the over–19\n       rule, she agreed with its decision, and thus did not feel it was necessary to appeal the decision.\n3      See Texas Educ. Agency v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 797 S.W.2d 367, 369 (Tex.App.—Austin 1990, no writ). (This Court held that the\n       appeal in that case was moot, and therefore the underlying order was vacated. Accordingly, the UIL's determination of ineligibility\n       became final and triggered the enforcement of the mandatory forfeiture rule).\n4      As a preliminary matter, the UIL contends in its second point of error that the Students do not meet the definition of “qualified\n       handicapped persons” under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. After reviewing the Act and its attendant regulations, we reject\n       this argument and conclude that both students meet the definition of “qualified handicapped persons.”\n5      Although not controlling, this Court looks to federal precedent for its persuasive value.\n6      Among the stated purposes of IDEA are\n            to assure that all children with disabilities have available to them, within the time periods specified in section 1412(2)(B) of this\n            title, a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique\n            needs [and] to assure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected....\n          20 U.S.C.A. § 1400(c).\n7      The UIL admitted in oral argument that had the school districts declared the Students eligible under the IDEA, the UIL would not have\n       abided by such determination. We also note that the school districts requested waivers from the UIL of the over–19 rule, and therefore\n       the Students had no need to invoke an administrative procedure designed to request affirmative action from the school authorities.\n8      We overruled the Students' original motion to dismiss as moot.\n9      If we moot this appeal and the judgment of the district court is vacated, the judgment for attorneys' fees is vacated as well.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

G App. A, Art. 10, § 9, Preamble\n\n                                           Preamble: A Lawyer's Responsibilities\n\n                                                          Currentness\n\n\n1. A lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for\nthe quality of justice. Lawyers, as guardians of the law, play a vital role in the preservation of society. The fulfillment of this\nrole requires an understanding by lawyers of their relationship with and function in our legal system. A consequent obligation\nof lawyers is to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct.\n\n2. As a representative of clients, a lawyer performs various functions. As advisor, a lawyer provides a client with an informed\nunderstanding of the client's legal rights and obligations and explains their practical implications. As advocate, a lawyer\nzealously asserts the client's position under the rules of the adversary system. As negotiator, a lawyer seeks a result advantageous\nto the client but consistent with requirements of honest dealing with others. As intermediary between clients, a lawyer seeks\nto reconcile their divergent interests as an advisor and, to a limited extent, as a spokesperson for each client. A lawyer acts as\nevaluator by examining a client's affairs and reporting about them to the client or to others.\n\n3. In all professional functions, a lawyer should zealously pursue clients' interests within the bounds of the law. In doing so,\na lawyer should be competent, prompt and diligent. A lawyer should maintain communication with a client concerning the\nrepresentation. A lawyer should keep in confidence information relating to representation of a client except so far as disclosure\nis required or permitted by the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.\n\n4. A lawyer's conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer's\nbusiness and personal affairs. A lawyer should use the law's procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or\nintimidate others. A lawyer should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, other\nlawyers and public officials. While it is a lawyer's duty, when necessary, to challenge the rectitude of official action, it is also\na lawyer's duty to uphold legal process.\n\n5. As a public citizen, a lawyer should seek improvement of the law, the administration of justice and the quality of service\nrendered by the legal profession. As a member of a learned profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law beyond\nits use for clients, employ that knowledge in reform of the law and work to strengthen legal education. A lawyer should be\nmindful of deficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and sometimes persons who are not poor,\ncannot afford adequate legal assistance, and should therefore devote professional time and civic influence in their behalf. A\nlawyer should aid the legal profession in pursuing these objectives and should help the bar regulate itself in the public interest.\n\n6. A lawyer should render public interest legal service. The basic responsibility for providing legal services for those unable\nto pay ultimately rests upon the individual lawyer, and personal involvement in the problems of the disadvantaged can be one\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional\nworkload, should find time to participate in or otherwise support the provision of legal services to the disadvantaged. The\nprovision of free legal services to those unable to pay reasonable fees is a moral obligation of each lawyer as well as the\nprofession generally. A lawyer may discharge this basic responsibility by providing public interest legal services without fee, or\nat a substantially reduced fee, in one or more of the following areas: poverty law, civil rights law, public rights law, charitable\norganization representation, the administration of justice, and by financial support for organizations that provide legal services\nto persons of limited means.\n\n7. In the nature of law practice, conflicting responsibilities are encountered. Virtually all difficult ethical problems arise from\napparent conflict between a lawyer's responsibilities to clients, to the legal system and to the lawyer's own interests. The\nTexas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct prescribe terms for resolving such tensions. They do so by stating minimum\nstandards of conduct below which no lawyer can fall without being subject to disciplinary action. Within the framework of these\nRules many difficult issues of professional discretion can arise. The Rules and their Comments constitute a body of principles\nupon which the lawyer can rely for guidance in resolving such issues through the exercise of sensitive professional and moral\njudgment. In applying these rules, lawyers may find interpretive guidance in the principles developed in the Comments.\n\n8. The legal profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulation is undertaken in the public interest rather than in\nfurtherance of parochial or self-interested concerns of the bar, and to insist that every lawyer both comply with its minimum\ndisciplinary standards and aid in securing their observance by other lawyers. Neglect of these responsibilities compromises the\nindependence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.\n\n9. Each lawyer's own conscience is the touchstone against which to test the extent to which his actions may rise above the\ndisciplinary standards prescribed by these rules. The desire for the respect and confidence of the members of the profession\nand of the society which it serves provides the lawyer the incentive to attain the highest possible degree of ethical conduct. The\npossible loss of that respect and confidence is the ultimate sanction. So long as its practitioners are guided by these principles,\nthe law will continue to be a noble profession. This is its greatness and its strength, which permit of no compromise.\n\n\nCredits\nAdopted by order of Oct. 17, 1989, eff.

DISCIPLINARY R. PROFF’L CONDUCT Preamble, reprinted in TEX. GOV’T CODE\nANN., title 2, subtit. G, app. A. (Vernon 2013).\n\n          To support this goal of assuring that self-regulation is undertaken “in the\n\npublic interest” (rather than in self-interest), the system must always strive to be\n\ntransparent. Yet, that is exactly the opposite of what the State Bar Defendants\n\nseek in this case. They have insisted that the very rules put into place to implement\n\nself-regulation “in the public interest” actually prohibit a complaining member of\n\nthe public from learning why his grievance against a Texas attorney was\n\nsummarily dismissed with no explanation. There are no rules or laws, however,\n\nwhich prohibit the complaining party himself, from learning about his own\n\ngrievance and why it was dismissed.\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                       1\n\f                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       The procedural facts of this case are not in dispute. John Doe filed a\n\nsixteen-page grievance against a Texas-licensed attorney. The Chief Disciplinary\n\nCounsel (“CDC”) sent its recommendation regarding the grievance ex parte to the\n\nSummary Disposition Panel (“SDP”). The CDC then informed Complainant that\n\nhis grievance had been dismissed.\n\n       When Doe requested the CDC’s recommendation to the SDP (to understand\n\nwhy the CDC believed the allegations in his complaint did not surpass the low-\n\nthreshold of “just cause”), the CDC claimed that such a disclosure would violate\n\nTexas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure 2.16, which generally makes the grievance\n\nprocess confidential. Thus, the CDC has interpreted 2.16 as making the grievance\n\nprocess confidential, from the complainant himself.\n\n       This misinterpretation of 2.16 provided the basis for Doe’s declaratory\n\njudgment action, filed on May 30, 2014, against the State Bar of Texas,\n\nCommission for Lawyer Discipline, the State Bar of Texas, and Linda Acevedo in\n\nher Official Capacity as the Chief Disciplinary Counsel of the State Bar of Texas\n\n(collectively, “The State Bar Defendants”). C.R. 4-20.1 In his declaratory\n\njudgment action below, Doe sought to have the trial court declare that Texas Rules\n1\n Appellant will cite to the Clerk’s Record as “CR [Page No.]” and to the Reporter’s Record as\n“RR [Page No.]/[Line No.].”\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                               2\n\fof Disciplinary Procedure 2.16 does not apply to complainants, and the CDC\n\ncannot hide its recommendation to the SDP from the Complainant (Appellant).2\n\nC.R. 8 at ¶ 22. Doe also requested a declaration that Defendant Linda Acevedo, in\n\nher official capacity as the Chief Disciplinary Counsel of the CFLD, by and\n\nthrough her employee agents, acted without legal authority in denying Doe a copy\n\nof the CDC’s recommendation to the SDP on Doe’s grievance, and that as a result,\n\nhe is entitled to receive a copy of the recommendation. C.R. 9 at ¶ 23.\n\n         To avoid such a declaration, the State Bar Defendants filed a Motion to\n\nDismiss, which raised 5 separate arguments, and requested dismissal of the suit.\n\nC.R. 21-29. On July 23, 2014, a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss was held before\n\nthe Honorable Scott Jenkins. R.R. 1-40.\n\n       On October 8, 2014, an Order granting dismissal was signed. C.R. 88.\n\nHowever, the parties were not notified that the Order was granted, and did not\n\ndiscover the Order until December 5, 2014. Doe then filed an Unopposed Motion\n\nto Establish Notice of Judgment under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 306a (C.R.\n\n89-106), which the trial court signed on January 6, 2015 (C.R. 107), thus\n\n\n2\n  Along with his original declaratory judgment petition, Appellant filed below a Motion to Seal\nRecords, out of an abundance of caution, to maintain the confidentiality of the entire grievance\nproceeding. Oddly, the State Bar Defendants opposed the Motion to Seal, a position contrary to\ntheir underlying confidentiality arguments. Despite this opposition, the Trial Court granted the\nMotion to Seal (CR 31-32) ordering eleven separate documents sealed, including the original 16-\npage grievance. Thus, while not included in the Clerk’s Record, those sealed records are\navailable to this appellate court.\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                              3\n\festablishing that Doe first had notice of the October 8, 2014 Order on December 5,\n\n2014, and appellate deadlines would run from December 5, 2014. While the\n\nMotion to Establish Notice of Judgment was pending, out of an abundance of\n\ncaution, Doe filed his Notice of Appeal on December 31, 2014. Pursuant to the\n\nsigned Order granting the Motion to Establish Notice, Doe’s notice of appeal was\n\ntimely filed.\n\n                         SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      The trial court had jurisdiction over Does’s claims because the State Bar\n\nDefendants were not immune from suit under Texas Rules of Disciplinary\n\nProcedure 15.09 or under Sefzik. Furthermore, the trial court had jurisdiction\n\nbecause Does’s claims are justiciable, and because Does’s lawsuit does not seek to\n\nenjoin the grievance process.\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                  4\n\f                     ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      The Motion to Dismiss is properly characterized as a motion to dismiss for\n\nwant of jurisdiction. RR 6 at 9-10. Under Texas caselaw, the proper standard of\n\nreview is dictated by the substance of the issue to be reviewed as opposed to the\n\nprocedural vehicle through which that issue is developed.

The State Bar Defendants do not enjoy sovereign immunity from this\n      lawsuit.\n\n      The Motion to Dismiss argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because\n\nTexas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure 15.09 provides the State Bar Defendants\n\nwith complete immunity. C.R. 24 ¶6. But 15.09 applies to individuals, not entities,\n\nand thus the trial court should have rejected this argument. TEX. R. DISC. P. 15.09,\n\nreprinted in TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN., title 2, subtit. G, app. A-1 (Vernon 2013).\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                    5\n\f      Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure 15.09 states, in relevant part, that all\n\n“members of the Commission, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel . . . all members of\n\nCommittees, all members of the Board of Disciplinary Appeals . . . are immune\n\nfrom suit for any conduct in the course of their official duties. Id. (emphases\n\nadded). “Member” means “one of the individuals composing a group.” MERRIAM-\n\nWEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY, Definition 2, available at www.merriam-\n\nwebster.com/dictionary/member (last visited July 17, 2014). The use of the term\n\n“their” also confirms that 15.09 applies to individuals, not entities. Thus, by its\n\nown terms, Rule 15.09 applies only to suits against individuals.\n\n      In the case at bar, Doe named as Defendants the Board of Directors of the\n\nState Bar and the Commission for Lawyer Discipline, neither of which is an\n\nindividual (or “member”), as contemplated by Rule 15.09. See C.R. 79; TEX. R.\n\nDISC. P. 15.09. Doe also named the Chief Disciplinary Counsel in her official\n\ncapacity, but a suit against her in her official capacity is not a suit against her as an\n\nindividual. See, e.g., Estate of Terrell v. Sisk, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758601\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758601/terrell-ex-rel-estate-of-terrell-v-sisk/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 282 (Tex. App.—\n\nTexarkana 2003, no pet.) (noting that an official-capacity suit against a\n\ngovernmental employee is not a suit against the employee but against his\n\nemployer). Accordingly, none of the named Defendants are “members,” or\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                       6\n\findividuals, as Rule 15.09 contemplates; therefore, Rule 15.09 does not apply, and\n\nthe trial court should have rejected this argument.3\n\n       At the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss (for the first time), the State Bar\n\nDefendants asserted that they were entitled to sovereign immunity as state\n\nagencies, citing Sefzik. See RR 15/20 (citing Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Sefzik, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011). According to the State Bar Defendants, Sefzik confirmed\n\nthat the declaratory judgment act does not waive immunity, i.e. there must be a\n\nlegislatively-provided waiver for the claims at issue. See id. This general\n\nstatement of Sefzik’s holding is correct. However, Sefzik also made clear that\n\ndeclaratory judgment actions may be brought against the state or its officers in two\n\ninstances: (1) in actions against the state, and its agencies, which challenge the\n\nvalidity of a statute; and (2) in ultra vires claims against a state officer. Id. at 621–\n\n22.\n\n       Doe’s pleadings comply with Sefzik’s directives. In the present case, Doe\n\nprayed for (1) an interpretation that Rule 2.16 does not bar Doe from receiving a\n\ncopy of the CDC’s recommendation to the SDP, and (2) a declaration that\n\nDefendant Acevedo, in her official capacity as the Chief Disciplinary Counsel,\n\nacted ultra vires in denying Doe’s request for a copy of the CDC’s\n3\n Even if the Chief Disciplinary Counsel, who was sued in her official capacity, is considered an\nindividual to whom TRDP may apply, Complainant alleged that she acted ultra vires—without\nauthority—which means she could not have been acting “in the course of [her] official duties” as\nrequired for Rule 15.09 to apply. See TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY. P 15.09; see, e.g., C.R. 82 ¶18.\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                              7\n\frecommendation to the SDP. CR 83. Because both requests are allowed by Sefzik,\n\nthe trial court should have disregarded the State Bar Defendants’ argument. See id.\n\n\n\n\nC.    Doe has standing to bring this suit, which is not moot.\n\n      In their Motion to Dismiss, the State Bar Defendants asserted that (1) Doe\n\nfailed to plead an injury-in-fact; and (2) the issues are moot. Both points are\n\nincorrect. Because Doe properly alleged his specific and legally cognizable\n\ninterest affected by the State Bar Defendants’ actions, and because those actions\n\nwill be repeated time and again without being reviewed, the issues are justiciable,\n\nand the trial court has jurisdiction to decide them.\n\n      1. Injury\n\n      The State Bar Defendants argue that Doe alleged “no actual harm from any\n\nact of any of the Defendants.” C.R. 25 ¶8. In a declaratory judgment action, to\n\nestablish standing, a plaintiff must show actual or imminent harm to his own\n\nparticular interests. See Tex. Dep’t of Pub. Safety v.

Thus, Doe cannot evaluate how his grievance failed,\n\nin Defendants’ estimation, to satisfy the very low “just cause” standard. Id.\n\nFurther, the “TRDP authorizes Plaintiff to file another grievance in this matter, but\n\nthe CDC’s unauthorized decision to hide its ex parte recommendation to the SDP\n\nrenders futile any effort to correct Plaintiff’s grievance in a new filing.”4 Id.; see\n\nTEX. R. DISC. P. 2.10. Thus, Doe’s interest in filing a new grievance is actually\n\nharmed by the State Bar Defendants’ unauthorized actions relating to their ex parte\n\nrecommendation. See Salazar, 304 S.W.3d at 906 (citation omitted).\n\n       2. Mootness\n\n       The Motion to Dismiss asserts that there is no live controversy because once\n\nthe SDP dismissed Doe’s grievance, the process ended and cannot be revisited.\n\nC.R. 25-26 ¶9. But because this case meets the “public interest” exception to the\n\nmootness doctrine—the questions involved in this case are of considerable public\n\nimportance, are capable of arising again between the same parties or other\n\n\n4\n To the extent the State Bar Defendants argue that Doe cannot assert a new grievance against\nthis attorney, and thus there is no need for Doe to review the ex parte recommendation, this\nargument fails under the language of TRDP 2.10. TRDP 2.10 does not limit the number of\ngrievances a complainant may file, so long as the grievance is classified as a “complaint.” TRDP\n2.10. The limitations of TRDP 2.10 apply only when the CDC classifies grievances as\n“inquiries,” and then circumscribe the number of attempts a complainant may make to have his\ngrievance classified as a complaint and not an inquiry. Id. TRDP 2.10’s restrictions simply do\nnot apply once the CDC classifies a grievance as a “complaint.” Id.\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                             9\n\fmembers of the public, and will continue to evade judicial review—this case is not\n\nmoot.

Thus, the question in this case will arise again and\n\nagain, each time a grieving complaint’s grievance is summarily dismissed with no\n\nexplanation. Each time Defendants determine that the “just cause” standard has\n\nnot been met (in any grievance proceeding against any attorney), Defendants will\n\nagain refuse to provide a copy of their ex parte recommendation to the\n\ncomplaining party (who began the whole complaint process).\n\n      Moreover, following this pattern ensures that Defendants’ “no just cause”\n\ndetermination is never scrutinized, and the complaining member of the public\n\nnever knows why his grievance against the attorney did not meet that low standard.\n\n      In addition, whether the State Bar Defendants are permitted to hide their ex\n\nparte recommendation to the decision-maker from the complaining member of the\n\npublic—the very person who initiated the grievance process—is a question of\n\nconsiderable public importance. The State Bar Defendants will continue\n\nunjustifiably using Rule 2.16 to keep their ex parte recommendation from the\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                   10\n\fparties to a grievance proceeding and again, more importantly, keep their reasons\n\nto recommend dismissal from the very person making the complaint. Furthermore,\n\nas in this case, the SDP will continue to rule on the recommendations from the\n\nCDC before a court can intervene, thereby prohibiting review of the CDC’s ex\n\nparte recommendation and “no just cause” finding. For those reasons, this case\n\nsatisfies the “public interest exception” to the mootness doctrine, and the trial court\n\nhad jurisdiction to hear the pending declaratory judgment action.\n\nD.    This case does not seek to enjoin a grievance proceeding.\n\n      The State Bar Defendants argue generally that trial courts cannot enjoin\n\ngrievance proceedings, and claim this general proposition of law prevents this\n\nCourt from hearing this Declaratory Judgment action. But because Doe does not\n\nseek (and has never sought) to enjoin any grievance proceeding, this argument is\n\nmisplaced.\n\n      Defendants rely on State Bar of Texas v. Gomez, in which the plaintiffs\n\nasked a state district court to create a mandatory duty for attorneys to undertake\n\npro bono representations. 891 S.W2d 243, 246 (Tex. 1994). The supreme court\n\nnarrowly held that creating duties for attorneys is the sole province of the supreme\n\ncourt, and any attempt by a lower court to so regulate the legal profession is an\n\nimpermissible usurpation of the supreme court’s authority. Id. In other words, a\n\ntrial court cannot “promulgat[e] policies and regulations governing Texas\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                    11\n\flawyers.” Id. For that reason, in Gomez, the district court could not grant the relief\n\nrequested by the plaintiff—an injunction creating a mandatory pro bono program.\n\nId. Thus, because the district court could not grant the relief request, the case\n\nbefore it was not justiciable, and that court lacked jurisdiction. Id.\n\n       Gomez is inapposite to this case. Doe is not asking the trial court to create a\n\nnew rule, institute a new program, insert a new requirement, or promulgate a new\n\npolicy or regulation. All the trial court is asked to do is declare that disclosure to a\n\ncomplainant is not prohibited by Rule 2.16.\n\n       The State Bar Defendants also cite Favaloro v. Commission for Lawyer\n\nDiscipline, in which the plaintiff sought a court order enjoining the State Bar of\n\nTexas, the grievance committee, and others from enforcing the grievance rules\n\nagainst him. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2104552\"><a href=\"/opinion/2104552/favaloro-v-comn-for-lawyer-discipline/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836–37 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2000, no pet.). The\n\nDallas Court of Appeals rejected the plaintiff’s argument, holding that a district\n\ncourt does not have jurisdiction to enjoin the “grievance procedures authorized by\n\nthe State Bar Act.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n       Favaloro is likewise inapposite to this case. In this case, Doe is merely\n\nasking the Court to declare rights under a rule of disciplinary procedure. Unlike\n\nthe plaintiff in Favaloro, Doe is not seeking an order from the Court halting or\n\nforbidding the State Bar Defendants from enforcing the disciplinary rules against\n\nhim.\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF                                                                     12\n\f      Defendants cite no cases which have held that a district court may not\n\ninterpret a rule of disciplinary procedure, and the trial court is well-within its\n\npower to make such a declaration.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      The trial erred when it dismissed Doe’s claims for lack of jurisdiction, and\n\nthis Court should reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n                                       PRAYER\n\n      Appellant John Doe prays that this Court reverse the trial court’s dismissal\n\nand remand this case for further proceedings.\n\n\n                                  Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                  WEST, WEBB, ALLBRITTON & GENTRY, P.C.\n                                  1515 Emerald Plaza\n                                  College Station, Texas 77845-1515\n                                  Telephone: (979) 694-7000\n                                  Facsimile: (979) 694-8000\n\n                                       /s/ Gaines West\n                                  By:________________________\n                                    GAINES WEST\n                                    State Bar No. 21197500\n                                    gaines.west@westwebblaw.com\n\n                                     JENNIFER D.

We note that violation of rule 8.03(a) was not alleged in the disciplinary petition and was not\n        submitted to the jury.\n2       Effective September 1, 1997, the Texas Supreme Court repealed the then-existing rules of appellate procedure and replaced them\n        with the current rules of appellate procedure. In civil cases, the current rules of appellate procedure apply to cases in which the notice\n        of appeal or the brief (depending on the circumstances) was filed after September 1, 1997. In all other civil cases, the repealed rules\n        apply. In this case, the appeal was perfected on April 17, 1996, and Favaloro's brief was filed on February 7, 1997. Therefore, the\n        former rules of appellate procedure apply to this case.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                       © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Because           the undisputed facts provided by the minor. Whether those\ntoday we are construing the parental notification act for the          undisputed facts demonstrate that the minor is “mature and\nfirst time, and because I agree it is in the interests of justice to   sufficiently well informed to make *259 the decision to have\ngive Jane Doe an opportunity to meet the statutory standard            an abortion” is a legal question. And as we have said before,\nas the Court has construed it, I conclude this case presents           trial courts have no discretion in determining what the law is\nexceptional circumstances warranting a remand.                         or in applying the law to the facts. 2\n\nI join the Court's construction of the statutory phrase “mature        Thus, in these unique, non-adversarial, parental notification\nand sufficiently well-informed to make the decision to have            proceedings, I would hold that Texas appellate courts must\nan abortion performed without notification to either of her            review a trial court's decision under an abuse of discretion\nparents.” 1 But I do not agree that the standard of review             standard.

In essence, the Court holds that minors can                                    VI\nget by without the help.\n                                                                     I agree with the conclusion in Part II of the Court's opinion\n                                                                     that this Court must publicly explain its decisions, even in\n                                                                     cases like this one in which there is a special need for\n                                V\n                                                                     confidentiality. 30 Neither our duty to the rule of law, nor our\nI have set out above in complete detail petitioner's testimony,      constitutional role in the government, nor our obligations to\nomitting only those facts that tend to identify her. It is fair to   the people whose government it is, permit this Court to rule\nsay that she based her decision to have an abortion on what          in secret.

SOS Alliance relies on Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. v. Lowry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1657647\"><a href=\"/opinion/1657647/save-our-springs-alliance-inc-v-lowry/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.-Austin 1996, orig.\n       proceeding), as indicative of such standing. However, that case involved standing based on a statute—the Texas Open Meetings Act.\n       See 934 S.W.2d at 162. That Act authorizes an “interested person” to file suit. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 551.142(a) (West 2004).\n       According to Lowry, this statutory provision dispenses with the standing requirement of an injury distinct from that of the general\n       public. Lowry, 934 S.W.2d at 163.\n          Similarly, the San Marcos River Foundation (SMRF) filed a letter brief as amicus curiae, expressing its concern that a determination\n          in this case that SOS Alliance does not have standing based on environmental harm would impair SMRF's future ability to litigate.\n          We note that in City of San Marcos v. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality—by which, SMRF asserts, it was successful in\n          protecting the San Marcos River—a statute specifically authorized judicial review. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2003330\"><a href=\"/opinion/2003330/city-of-san-marcos-v-tx-comn-on-environ/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 266 (Tex.App.-Austin 2004,\n          pet. denied) (citing Tex.

Thus, our adjudication of SOS Alliance's standing in the absence\n          of such statutory provision will not likely affect SMRF's future ability to again file suit under the same statute.\n8      SOS Alliance argues that it should not be required to “hire experts to map and calculate local hydrogeological flows to engage in\n       debates about gradients of flows” at this stage.

To the extent the court was holding that all motions to\n      dismiss are reviewed for abuse of discretion, we disagree.

Because the issue in\n      this case—waiver of sovereign immunity—is legal in nature, we apply the de novo standard.\n3     To the extent there is a distinction, Dearen apparently intended to allege that Dr. Sheth failed to align the nail hole and the jig to\n      permit the placement of the distal interlocking screw. As the expert's report states, the procedure itself was called an “intramedullary\n      nailing” and involved the placement of a short Gamma nail which requires a distal interlocking screw to “lock” the nail in place.\n      Dearen's amended petition further clarifies this by alleging the same facts, but substituting the term “distal interlocking screw” for\n      “intramedullary hip screw.”\n4     Both Dearen, in his amended petition, and Dearen's expert, in his report, stated that the nail “requires the distal interlocking screw\n      for stability (emphasis added).”\n5     White also argued that the pump's use on his property caused the damages, however, this claim was not considered by the court\n      because it involved factual allegations first raised on appeal. White, 46 S.W.3d at 870.\n6     Dr. Sheth argues that once he filed his motion to dismiss pursuant to 101.016(f), his right to dismissal was perfected and any\n      subsequent pleadings by Dearen could not effect that right.

Therefore, even if we determine that the Appellees have\n       raised a valid ultra vires claim with respect to the September 2008 memorandum, that claim remains barred by sovereign immunity\n       to the extent it is brought against any party other than the Director of the Department.\n7      To the extent the Appellees also seek relief under the UDJA in connection with these rule challenges, we dismiss those claims for\n       want of jurisdiction on the ground that a party may not seek relief under the UDJA when such relief would be redundant to relief\n       under the APA.

(“When a plaintiff files a proceeding that only challenges the validity\n       of an administrative rule, the parties are bound by the APA and may not seek relief under the UDJA because such relief would be\n       redundant.”).\n8      For the same reason, even if we considered Gomez's rule challenge to be a valid ultra vires claim under the UDJA, he has failed to\n       establish a justiciable controversy and therefore lacks standing under the UDJA as well.\n9      Like Gomez, Galvan has also failed to establish a justiciable controversy that would give him standing under the UDJA in the event\n       of a valid ultra vires claim regarding the Department's rules.\n10     In light of our holding on the jurisdictional question, we need only determine whether Green Meadows, Salazar, Soria, and Trejo\n       established the elements necessary to entitle them to a temporary injunction, as the remaining appellees have been dismissed.\n11     Based on the testimony provided at the temporary-injunction hearing, it appears that Salazar holds a license from Mexico, but that\n       Soria and Trejo do not. However, the question at issue here is whether an adequate remedy is available, not whether the parties have\n       actually availed themselves of that remedy. Furthermore, “[t]he lack of an adequate remedy is not shown by the mere fact that the\n       remedy provided would involve more expense or delay.” Kendall Appraisal Dist. v.

We also note that the school districts requested waivers from the UIL of the over–19 rule, and therefore\n       the Students had no need to invoke an administrative procedure designed to request affirmative action from the school authorities.\n8      We overruled the Students' original motion to dismiss as moot.\n9      If we moot this appeal and the judgment of the district court is vacated, the judgment for attorneys' fees is vacated as well.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

G App. A, Art. 10, § 9, Preamble\n\n                                           Preamble: A Lawyer's Responsibilities\n\n                                                          Currentness\n\n\n1. A lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for\nthe quality of justice. Lawyers, as guardians of the law, play a vital role in the preservation of society. The fulfillment of this\nrole requires an understanding by lawyers of their relationship with and function in our legal system. A consequent obligation\nof lawyers is to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct.\n\n2. As a representative of clients, a lawyer performs various functions. As advisor, a lawyer provides a client with an informed\nunderstanding of the client's legal rights and obligations and explains their practical implications. As advocate, a lawyer\nzealously asserts the client's position under the rules of the adversary system. As negotiator, a lawyer seeks a result advantageous\nto the client but consistent with requirements of honest dealing with others. As intermediary between clients, a lawyer seeks\nto reconcile their divergent interests as an advisor and, to a limited extent, as a spokesperson for each client. A lawyer acts as\nevaluator by examining a client's affairs and reporting about them to the client or to others.\n\n3. In all professional functions, a lawyer should zealously pursue clients' interests within the bounds of the law. In doing so,\na lawyer should be competent, prompt and diligent. A lawyer should maintain communication with a client concerning the\nrepresentation. A lawyer should keep in confidence information relating to representation of a client except so far as disclosure\nis required or permitted by the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.\n\n4. A lawyer's conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer's\nbusiness and personal affairs. A lawyer should use the law's procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or\nintimidate others. A lawyer should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, other\nlawyers and public officials. While it is a lawyer's duty, when necessary, to challenge the rectitude of official action, it is also\na lawyer's duty to uphold legal process.\n\n5. As a public citizen, a lawyer should seek improvement of the law, the administration of justice and the quality of service\nrendered by the legal profession. As a member of a learned profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law beyond\nits use for clients, employ that knowledge in reform of the law and work to strengthen legal education. A lawyer should be\nmindful of deficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and sometimes persons who are not poor,\ncannot afford adequate legal assistance, and should therefore devote professional time and civic influence in their behalf. A\nlawyer should aid the legal profession in pursuing these objectives and should help the bar regulate itself in the public interest.\n\n6. A lawyer should render public interest legal service. The basic responsibility for providing legal services for those unable\nto pay ultimately rests upon the individual lawyer, and personal involvement in the problems of the disadvantaged can be one\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional\nworkload, should find time to participate in or otherwise support the provision of legal services to the disadvantaged. The\nprovision of free legal services to those unable to pay reasonable fees is a moral obligation of each lawyer as well as the\nprofession generally. A lawyer may discharge this basic responsibility by providing public interest legal services without fee, or\nat a substantially reduced fee, in one or more of the following areas: poverty law, civil rights law, public rights law, charitable\norganization representation, the administration of justice, and by financial support for organizations that provide legal services\nto persons of limited means.\n\n7. In the nature of law practice, conflicting responsibilities are encountered. Virtually all difficult ethical problems arise from\napparent conflict between a lawyer's responsibilities to clients, to the legal system and to the lawyer's own interests. The\nTexas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct prescribe terms for resolving such tensions. They do so by stating minimum\nstandards of conduct below which no lawyer can fall without being subject to disciplinary action. Within the framework of these\nRules many difficult issues of professional discretion can arise. The Rules and their Comments constitute a body of principles\nupon which the lawyer can rely for guidance in resolving such issues through the exercise of sensitive professional and moral\njudgment. In applying these rules, lawyers may find interpretive guidance in the principles developed in the Comments.\n\n8. The legal profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulation is undertaken in the public interest rather than in\nfurtherance of parochial or self-interested concerns of the bar, and to insist that every lawyer both comply with its minimum\ndisciplinary standards and aid in securing their observance by other lawyers. Neglect of these responsibilities compromises the\nindependence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.\n\n9. Each lawyer's own conscience is the touchstone against which to test the extent to which his actions may rise above the\ndisciplinary standards prescribed by these rules. The desire for the respect and confidence of the members of the profession\nand of the society which it serves provides the lawyer the incentive to attain the highest possible degree of ethical conduct. The\npossible loss of that respect and confidence is the ultimate sanction. So long as its practitioners are guided by these principles,\nthe law will continue to be a noble profession. This is its greatness and its strength, which permit of no compromise.\n\n\nCredits\nAdopted by order of Oct. 17, 1989, eff.
