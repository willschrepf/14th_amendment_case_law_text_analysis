Thus, we reverse in part, and\n\naffirm in part, the order of the Commonwealth Court.\n\n         Before we consider the specifics of this appeal, a brief overview of the law\n\nconcerning mine safety in our Commonwealth is in order.              Historically, and not\n\nsurprisingly, the mining of underground coal in Pennsylvania has been widely\n\nconsidered a dangerous endeavor. While significant improvements in mining safety\n\nhave been achieved over the years, the recent events at the 2002 Quecreek Mine\n\naccident in Somerset County Pennsylvania, where nine miners were trapped for three\n\ndays in a flooded mine shaft, made manifest the continued perilousness of mining.\n\nWhile the federal government regulates mining in Pennsylvania through the Mine Safety\n\nand Health Administration Act, as amended by the Mine Improvement Emergency\n\nResponse Act,2 state governments are permitted to regulate mining as well, and our\n\nCommonwealth has done so for over 100 years.\n\n         Specifically, the progenitor of Pennsylvania’s Bituminous Coal Mine Safety Act,\n\nentitled the Bituminous Coal Mine Act, was originally codified in 1883. The most recent\n\nversion of the statute was drafted in 1961 and constituted the first comprehensive\n\nmining legislation designed to regulate mining safety practices. The 1961 version of the\n\nAct included various provisions concerning safety, including inspectors being tasked\n\n\n1\n    Act of July 7, 2008, P.L. 654, No. 55, 52 P.S. §§ 690-101 to 690-708.\n2\n    30 U.S.C. § 801-878.\n\n\n\n                                    [J-77A&B-2013] - 2\n\fwith inspecting mines on a regular basis, with the ultimate purpose being to protect the\n\nhealth and safety of miners.\n\n       In 2008, after years of work among industry, workers, and government\n\nrepresentatives, the retitled “Bituminous Coal Mine Safety Act of 2008” (“Mine Safety\n\nAct” or “Act”), at issue herein, was unanimously enacted by the General Assembly.\n\nStressing the theme of the statute, the legislature’s findings declared that the “first\n\npriority and concern of all in the bituminous coal mining industry must be the health and\n\nsafety of those who work in and at mines and others in and about mines.” 52 P.S. §\n\n690-103(a)(1).      Consistent therewith, the General Assembly added to the multiple\n\ndeclared purposes of the Act, including “[t]o use the full extent of the Commonwealth’s\n\npowers to protect the lives, health and safety of miners and others in and about\n\nunderground bituminous coal mines.” Id. § 690-103(b)(1).\n\n       Three aspects of the recent legislation are particularly noteworthy for purposes of\n\nthe matter before us. First, pursuant to Section 109 of the Mine Safety Act, mine\n\noperators must notify the DEP of “accidents” that occur at their mines, within 15 minutes\n\nof the discovery of the accident. 52 P.S. § 690-109(a)(1). Unlike its predecessor, the\n\nAct provides a broad definition to the operative term “accident” as follows:\n\n              “Accident.” An unanticipated event, including any of the\n              following:\n              (1)    A death of an individual at a mine.\n              (2) An injury to an individual at a mine, which has a\n              reasonable potential to cause death.\n              (3) An entrapment of an individual at a mine which has a\n              reasonable potential to cause death or serious injury.\n              (4)    An unplanned inundation of a mine by a liquid or a gas.\n              (5)    An unplanned ignition or explosion of gas or dust.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-77A&B-2013] - 3\n\f                (6) An unplanned mine fire not extinguished within ten\n                minutes of discovery.\n                (7) An unplanned ignition or explosion of a blasting agent\n                or an explosive.\n                (8) An unplanned roof fall at or above the anchorage zone\n                in active workings where roof bolts are in use.\n                (9) An unplanned roof or rib fall in active workings that\n                impairs ventilation or impedes passage.\n                (10) A coal or rock outburst that causes withdrawal of\n                miners or which disrupts regular mining activity for more than\n                one hour.\n                (11) An unstable condition at an impoundment or refuse pile\n                which does any of the following:\n                      (i) Requires emergency action in order to prevent\n                failure.\n                     (ii) Causes individuals to evacuate an area.\n                (12) Failure of an impoundment or refuse pile.\n                (13) Damage to hoisting equipment in a shaft or slope which\n                endangers an individual or which interferes with use of the\n                equipment for more than 30 minutes.\n                (14) An event at a mine which causes death or bodily injury\n                to an individual not at the mine at the time the event occurs.\n52 P.S. § 690-104.\n\n      Second, the Mine Safety Act requires certain vehicles to carry portable fire\n\nextinguishers. Specifically, “[e]ach track or off-track locomotive, self-propelled mantrip\n\ncar or personnel carrier shall be equipped with one portable fire extinguisher.” 52 P.S.\n\n§ 690-273(f).\n\n      Third, the Act created the Board of Coal Mine Safety (“Safety Board” or “Board”),\n\nwhich was established to provide the means to rapidly respond to changes in mining\n\ntechnology and conditions.       52 P.S. § 690-106.       The Board, comprised of seven\n\nmembers representing the DEP, workers, and owner/operators, is given the authority to\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-77A&B-2013] - 4\n\fwrite amendments to interim mandatory safety standards, as well as promulgate new\n\nmine safety regulations.\n\n       With this history and relevant legal background in hand, we turn to the facts\n\nunderlying this appeal, which are largely undisputed and involve alleged violations of\n\nthe Mine Safety Act at mines in the southwestern part of the Commonwealth. The\n\ninstant case arises out of several orders issued by the DEP to Appellees as a result of\n\nAppellees’ alleged failure to report various incidents that purportedly compromised the\n\nsafety of their mines — i.e., the alleged failure to report an “accident” — as well as\n\nAppellees’ alleged failure to maintain proper fire protection equipment.         We first\n\nconsider the charges of a failure to report an “accident.”\n\n       Appellee Emerald Coal Resources L.P. (“Emerald”) engages in underground\n\nbituminous coal mining at its Emerald Mine in Wayne Township, Greene County,\n\nPennsylvania. On January 19, 2009, at approximately 10:00 p.m., a crew of miners\n\nworking in the B-7 section of the operation mined through into the adjoining B-6 section.\n\nA plan for the cut through had been prepared and a mine examiner was to be sent and\n\nstationed at the B-6 section to wait for and listen for the approach of the mining crew in\n\nthe B-7 section. The plan also required the mine examiner to close two doors that the\n\ncompany had erected for the purpose of maintaining safe ventilation in the mine\n\nfollowing the cut through. Although the mine examiner went to the B-6 area, he did not\n\nremain there, and the doors stood open at the time of the cut through. Due to the doors\n\nremaining open, the ventilation in the area was affected. Specifically, a witness to the\n\ncut through felt the air along a conveyer belt reverse, and he could feel the heat from\n\nthe feeder on his face. Additionally, a methane detector on a shuttle car sounded an\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 5\n\falarm. Once certain protective measures were taken at the cut through, employees\n\nentered the B-6 area and closed the doors, resulting in the ventilation returning to its\n\nproper path.\n\n       Emerald did not notify the DEP of the incident. Thus, on January 30, 2009, the\n\nDEP issued an administrative order for Emerald’s violation of Section 109 of the Mine\n\nSafety Act for failing to report this “accident,” even though Section 104 does not list a\n\nventilation disruption as a specific reportable accident.\n\n       Appellee Cumberland Coal Resources L.P. (“Cumberland”) is the owner and\n\noperator of Cumberland Mine in Waynesburg, Greene County, Pennsylvania.                   At\n\napproximately 2:00 a.m. on February 12, 2009, an electrical storm resulted in a power\n\noutage at its mine that caused a fan in the mine’s ventilation system to stop working.\n\nThe mine’s backup power system also failed to start after the loss of power, and, as a\n\nresult, the mine’s ventilation system at the No. 5 bleeder shaft was inoperable for over\n\n16 minutes. The diesel powered back-up system, which should have automatically\n\nbeen triggered, failed to operate. Ultimately, a fan monitoring system alerted surface\n\npersonnel of the stoppage, and an electrician restarted the fan. The Mine Safety Act\n\nrequires mine operators to evacuate the mine when a ventilation system is down for 15\n\nminutes or more; however, such an event is not included in Section 104’s list of\n\n“accidents” subject to reporting requirements. Cumberland did not notify the DEP of the\n\nfan outage, and the DEP issued an administrative order for the violation.\n\n       Turning to the alleged fire equipment maintenance violations, as noted above,\n\nthe Mine Safety Act requires certain vehicles to contain portable fire extinguishers. The\n\nDEP,   interpreting   “off-track   locomotive”   to   include   “scoops,”   issued   multiple\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-77A&B-2013] - 6\n\fadministrative orders and notices of violation to both Cumberland and Appellee Amfire\n\nMining Co. (“Amfire”) for failing to equip their scoops with portable fire extinguishers in\n\nviolation of Section 273(f) of the Mine Safety Act. A scoop is a “battery-powered, four-\n\nwheeled vehicle equipped with a bucket” used “to transport tools, materials, and coal”\n\nthroughout the mine. EHB Opinion, 3/16/10, at 2. Scoops have only one seat for the\n\noperator’s use, and do not transport other miners. Id.\n\n       Emerald and Cumberland appealed their administrative orders to the\n\nEnvironmental Hearing Board (“EHB”), arguing they were not required to report the\n\nincidents that occurred at their mines because the incidents were not “accidents” as\n\ncontemplated by Section 104 of the Mine Safety Act. The EHB consolidated these two\n\ncases, and the DEP moved for summary judgment, arguing the events occurring at both\n\nmines did, in fact, constitute “accidents” under Section 104 that required reporting under\n\nSection 109(a)(1).\n\n      Cumberland and Amfire also filed appeals to the EHB from the administrative\n\norders issued regarding their failure to provide fire extinguishers on scoops, which were\n\nconsolidated for review.    The DEP and Cumberland/Amfire filed cross motions for\n\nsummary judgment concerning whether a scoop constitutes a “locomotive” under\n\nSection 273(f) and whether the DEP had the authority under the Mine Safety Act to\n\nissue orders requiring Cumberland and Amfire to supply fire extinguishers for scoops.\n\n      The EHB denied the DEP’s motions in both appeals. In the Emerald/Cumberland\n\nmatter, the EHB found the DEP lacked the authority to issue orders effectively\n\nexpanding Section 104’s list of “accidents” to include the incidents that occurred at the\n\nEmerald and Cumberland mines.          As to the Cumberland/Amfire matter, the EHB\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 7\n\fdetermined a scoop was not a “locomotive” within the meaning of Section 273(f), and,\n\nthus, that the DEP erred in citing Cumberland and Amfire for violating the Mine Safety\n\nAct. The DEP appealed both decisions to the Commonwealth Court.\n\n      The Commonwealth Court consolidated the appeals and affirmed.                DEP v.\n\nCumberland Coal Resources, 29 A.3d 414 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2011). First, the court held\n\nEmerald and Cumberland did not violate the reporting requirements of Section\n\n109(a)(1). In reaching this conclusion, the court looked to the definition of “accident” in\n\nSection 104 and noted the definition was subject to two different interpretations: the use\n\nof the word “including” before the list of events could signify that the list was not\n\nintended to be exclusive, and the use of the word “any” in the phrase “any of the\n\nfollowing” could mean that the General Assembly intended the list to be exclusive. As\n\nsuch, the court determined Section 104 was ambiguous, and it deferred to the DEP’s\n\nreasonable interpretation of the definition of “accident” as allowing additional events of\n\nthe same general kind or class as those expressly set forth in the list.        The court\n\nconcluded, however, that the DEP could not expand this list through the adjudicatory\n\nprocess, as the General Assembly vested the Safety Board with the authority to develop\n\nthe Mine Safety Act through rulemaking, and gave the DEP no such power.\n\nAccordingly, the court opined that the DEP’s powers under the Mine Safety Act are\n\nlimited to enforcing the express provisions of the Act and any regulations promulgated\n\nby the Safety Board. According to the court, were it to hold otherwise, the DEP could\n\nexpand the list of “accidents” on a case by case basis without giving mine operators any\n\nadvanced notice, effectively punishing operators for failing to act when they had no\n\nreason to know action was required.\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 8\n\f       The court also rejected the DEP’s alternative argument that it had authority to\n\nissue the administrative orders pursuant to its general enforcement powers under\n\nSections 105 and 501 of the Mine Safety Act. The court observed that Sections 105\n\nand 501 contain no language giving the DEP authority to create rules and requirements\n\nunder the Act, and it further opined that the General Assembly would not have expressly\n\nprovided for an expedited reporting requirement for “accidents” in Section 109(a)(1) if it\n\nalso allowed the DEP to use its general enforcement powers under Sections 105 and\n\n501 to impose a similar reporting requirement for events not included in the definition of\n\n“accident.”\n\n       As to the issue of whether the DEP established that Cumberland and Amfire\n\nviolated Section 273(f) by failing to provide fire extinguishers for their scoops, the court\n\nheld the DEP’s interpretation of the term “locomotive” to include scoops was erroneous.\n\nIn so holding, the court noted the General Assembly did not define the term “locomotive”\n\nin the Act, and it relied on both the technical and common dictionary definitions of\n\n“locomotive,” which both define “locomotive” as a “powered vehicle used to move\n\nnonpowered vehicles.” As scoops do not move nonpowered vehicles, the court agreed\n\nwith the EHB that they were not locomotives and, thus, not subject to the requirements\n\nof Section 273(f). Additionally, for the same reasons the court held the DEP could not\n\nrely on its enforcement powers to expand the list of “accidents” under the Act, the court\n\nfound the DEP also could not rely on its general enforcement powers under Sections\n\n105 and 501 to require fire extinguishers to be placed on scoops.\n\n       Notably, Judge Pellegrini filed a vigorous dissent joined by Judges Leadbetter\n\nand McCullough. Therein, Judge Pellegrini focused solely on the issue of the reporting\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 9\n\frequirements of Section 109, and disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that the DEP\n\nwas precluded from expanding the list of “accidents” in Section 104, as the Mine Safety\n\nAct contained no language indicating that enforcement of the Act depended on the\n\nSafety Board’s enactment of regulations.      According to Judge Pellegrini, to hold\n\notherwise would allow the Safety Board to become a quasi-enforcement body, hindering\n\nthe enforcement of the Mine Safety Act and the safety of miners.\n\n       We granted allocatur in the consolidated appeals, in sum, to address the scope\n\nof DEP’s authority to interpret the Mine Safety Act beyond its express provisions with\n\nrespect to the reporting of accidents and its authority to require portable fire\n\nextinguishers on certain mining vehicles.    As the issues on appeal are pure legal\n\nquestions, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary.\n\nBuffalo Twp. v. Jones, 813 A.2d 659, 664 n.4 (Pa. 2002). Moreover, as the issues\n\noverlap regarding the breadth of the DEP’s authority, we will consider the issues stated\n\nabove collectively.\n\n       The DEP first asserts that it acted under its authority as recognized by our\n\nCourt’s prior precedent when issuing its administrative orders in enforcing the Mine\n\nSafety Act. Indeed, the DEP contends that this Court has consistently recognized that\n\nadministrative agencies possess both rulemaking and adjudicatory powers, citing Dept.\n\nof Env. Res. v. Butler County Mushroom Farm, 454 A.2d 1 (Pa. 1982) and Pa. Human\n\nRel. Comm. v. Norristown Area Sch. Dist., 374 A.2d 671 (Pa. 1977).\n\n\n\n\n                                 [J-77A&B-2013] - 10\n\f       The DEP develops that the situation sub judice is analogous to that in Butler\n\nCounty, wherein its predecessor, the Department of Environmental Resources (“DER”),3\n\nacting under the General Safety Law,4 issued an administrative order to the Butler\n\nCounty Mushroom Farm after identifying a potential fire safety issue. Specifically, the\n\nDEP offers that, in Butler County, during an inspection of the Mushroom Farm, the DER\n\nnoted a problem in tracking every person who was underground in the limestone mines\n\nin which the mushrooms were grown. The DER observed that, while the Mushroom\n\nFarm identified every hourly employee underground, it did not have a process to identify\n\nsupervisors, independent contractors, repairmen, or visitors, including high school\n\nstudents on tours. This was critical to the DER, as, in the event of a fire, the absence of\n\nindividuals in the mines would allow rescuers to avoid embarking upon an unnecessary\n\nand dangerous search and rescue mission.           In response, the DER ordered the\n\nMushroom Farm to develop and implement a system to track all individuals in the\n\nmines. The Mushroom Farm appealed the order to the EHB, contending the DER did\n\nnot have legal authority to issue such an order. While the EHB affirmed the issuance of\n\nthe order, on appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed.\n\n       DEP points to our Court’s resolution of the issue in favor of the DER, noting that\n\nthe adjudicatory power was a customary and vital tool in the operation of administrative\n\nagencies, that unforeseeable circumstances required flexibility, and that the choice of\n\n\n3\n  The General Assembly changed the agency’s name from the DER to the DEP, created\na new agency, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (“DCNR”), and\nassigned to the new agency some of the responsibilities which previously had been\nassigned to the DER. Management of the Commonwealth’s state parks and forests\nwere the primary functions vested in the new DCNR. 71 P.S. § 340.101, et seq.\n4\n  Act of May 18, 1937, P.L. 654, as amended, 43 P.S. §§ 25-1 et seq.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 11\n\fproceeding by general rule or by individual ad hoc litigation was for the discretion of the\n\nadministrative agency. Butler County, 434 A.2d at 4 n.2. Although the text of the\n\nGeneral Safety Law spoke only of “instructions,” the DEP stresses that our Court\n\nnevertheless concluded that the statute authorized the issuance of the administrative\n\norders. Indeed, the DEP notes that our Court went further and held that the DER’s\n\nability to issue such orders extended beyond the borders of the statute itself. Id. at 8.\n\n       The DEP further points out that this Court in Butler County relied upon our prior\n\ndecision in Norristown Area, wherein we affirmed, in the context of ending school\n\nsegregation, that the Human Relations Commission could act by rule-making or on a\n\ncase-by-case basis through litigation. The DEP emphasizes that our Court held that\n\nthere was no abuse of discretion on the part of the Commission by choosing to proceed\n\nto remedy segregation through adjudication proceedings.\n\n       The DEP maintains that it relied upon this precedent to issue the administrative\n\norders in the matters before us, and that both mandating reporting to the DEP about life\n\nendangering mining incidents, and requiring fire extinguishers on scoops, were\n\nconsistent with and furthered the purposes of the Mine Safety Act. Indeed, the DEP\n\nsubmits that it was merely interpreting a statute that it is responsible for implementing,\n\nand, with respect to reporting, a statute that contains a non-exhaustive list of already\n\nexisting statutory requirements.\n\n       The DEP further challenges what it regards as the Commonwealth Court’s overly\n\nrestrictive construction of the Mine Safety Act, arguing that it is both contrary to the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute and the General Assembly’s intent to modernize the\n\nCommonwealth’s mine safety laws.         Specifically, the DEP cites Section 105, which\n\n\n                                    [J-77A&B-2013] - 12\n\fgrants to the DEP the “power and the duty to administer a mine safety program for\n\nindividuals employed at mines,” including the power to “[i]ssue orders to implement and\n\nenforce the provisions of this act.” 52 P.S. § 690-105(1), (3). The DEP contends this is\n\none of the many enumerated powers and duties conferred on the DEP as part of its\n\noverall power and duty to administer the mine safety program. Even more broadly, the\n\nDEP points to its power to issue written orders “to enforce this act, to effectuate the\n\npurposes of this act and to protect the health and safety of miners and individuals in and\n\nabout mines.” 52 P.S. § 690-501(a). Thus, according to the DEP, the express and\n\nexpansive authority conferred by the Mine Safety Act upon the DEP allows it to issue\n\nadministrative orders requiring actions not specifically expressed by statute that\n\npromote safety.\n\n       Building on this argument, the DEP maintains that the General Assembly\n\nsubstantially re-wrote the prior existing law, created the Safety Board to promulgate\n\nregulations, and empowered the DEP to issue orders to protect miner safety. The DEP\n\nsubmits that the Act contains nothing that would suggest the Safety Board’s authority to\n\npromulgate regulations dilutes the DEP’s adjudicatory authority under the Act, and\n\ncontends that both provisions should be given full force and effect to protect the “lives,\n\nhealth and safety of miners and others in and about underground bituminous coal\n\nmines.” 52 P.S. § 690-103(1).\n\n       The DEP further avers that it is its interpretation of the Mine Safety Act,\n\npermitting it to issue administrative orders for incidents not expressly provided for in the\n\nAct, that is entitled to deference.    According to the DEP, the Safety Board is the\n\n“administrative legislative branch” which enacts regulations, but it is the DEP which\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 13\n\fpossesses specialized knowledge of, and the greatest practical experience with, mine\n\nsafety issues. The DEP asserts it interpreted and applied the Mine Safety Act to the\n\nincidents at issue, in light of the expansive definition of the statutory term “accident” and\n\nthe requirement to provide notice to the DEP. In concluding that the mine operators\n\nshould have provided notice of the incidents at issue, the DEP reasons that it was\n\nmerely exercising its prerogative to interpret the statute as it deemed appropriate, as\n\nlong as that interpretation is consistent with the Mine Safety Act. Similarly, DEP asserts\n\nthat it reasonably determined that scoops fell within the term “off-track locomotive”\n\nunder the Mine Safety Act and ordered operators to equip such vehicles with fire\n\nextinguishers.\n\n       The DEP also offers various tenets of statutory construction in support of its\n\nposition. Specifically, the DEP points out that the General Assembly is presumed to\n\nintend that all provisions in a statute are to be given effect, citing 1 Pa.C.S.A.\n\n§§ 1921(a), 1922(2). Here, it notes Section 106 of the Act empowers the Safety Board\n\nto promulgate appropriate regulations to protect the health and safety of miners and\n\nothers, and consistent therewith, Section 501 of the Act empowers the DEP to issue\n\nwritten orders.\n\n       In response, Appellees’ primary contention is that the Commonwealth Court\n\nproperly determined that the DEP was without authority under Section 501 and 105 of\n\nthe Mine Safety Act to issue administrative orders that had the effect of creating new\n\nevents constituting “accidents” under Section 104.        Stated another way, Appellees\n\nmaintain that the definition of “accidents” in Section 104 of the Mine Safety Act is\n\nexhaustive and the DEP cannot expand the listing of events contained therein.\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 14\n\f       Appellees offer that the General Assembly bifurcated the compliance and\n\nrulemaking functions under the Mine Safety Act, as Section 106.1 explicitly vested the\n\nSafety Board with broad rulemaking authority, and reserved implementation and\n\nenforcement powers to the DEP under Sections 105 and 501. According to Appellees,\n\nif the DEP were able to, in essence, engage in rulemaking as well as issue\n\nadministrative orders, it would undermine the legislature’s intent to grant sole\n\nrulemaking power to the Safety Board, and would make the Safety Board’s rulemaking\n\npowers superfluous and redundant.\n\n       Appellees contend that not only does the DEP lack authority to issue\n\nadministrative orders expanding the requirements of the Act, but that the DEP offers no\n\neffort to define or limit the scope of this “catch-all” authority. This, Appellees stress, is\n\nmarkedly unfair, given the criminal and civil penalties that accompany a violation of the\n\nMine Safety Act and results in an ad hoc process in which the mine operator would\n\nhave no notice of the statute’s requirements and anticipating its reporting requirements.\n\nAppellees urge that this is especially true where the rule requires reporting an event\n\nwithin 15 minutes of an accident. Indeed, Appellees submit that a general authority\n\ngiven to DEP based upon an obligation to protect “health and safety” of miners, without\n\nany specific meaning, would prevent a mine operator from being proactive in complying\n\nwith the Act.\n\n       Appellees also offer our decision in Pa. State Bd. of Pharm. v. Cohen, 292 A.2d\n\n277 (Pa. 1972), in which our Court considered a pharmacist’s appeal of the suspension\n\nof his license by the Board of Pharmacy for “grossly unprofessional conduct” under the\n\nPharmacy Act. While not violating any of the specifically enumerated grounds that\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 15\n\fconstituted “grossly unprofessional conduct,” the Board of Pharmacy nevertheless took\n\nthe position that such prohibitions were not intended to be exclusive, but only an\n\nexemplary description of the prohibited conduct which served as guidance to the Board.\n\nAppellees point out that our Court rejected such a claim of expansive powers, instead\n\nlimiting the meaning of “gross unprofessional conduct” to those listed in the statute.\n\nCohen, 292 A.2d at 280-81. Appellees argue that the DEP should defer to the Board’s\n\nrulemaking powers to clarify which events constituted “accidents,” and what equipment\n\nmust be provided with fire extinguishers. Further, Appellees distinguish Butler County\n\nand Norristown Area as being factually unique and arising in the context of statutes that\n\ndid not delegate rulemaking authority to a board. According to Appellees, the DEP is\n\nimproperly trying to prescribe general rules of conduct via adjudication, yet, the line of\n\ndemarcation between rulemaking and enforcement under the Mine Safety Act prohibits\n\nthe DEP’s approach.\n\n       Further, Appellees maintain that, in the event that this Court finds that Section\n\n104 is not exclusive, and the General Assembly intended to grant unlimited power to the\n\nDEP, such a grant of “catch-all” power would be unconstitutional, as an impermissible\n\ndelegation of legislative power in violation of Pa. Const. art. 2, § 1.      According to\n\nAppellees, the DEP in this instance is acting as a super-legislature and in a fashion\n\ncontrary to what the legislature intended when creating the Board. Appellees urge that\n\nthis is true for the DEP’s expansion of what constitutes an “accident,” as well as its\n\ndecision to require fire extinguishers on scoops.          Similarly, Appellees make a\n\nconstitutional argument that any application of “catch-all” authority is unconstitutionally\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 16\n\fvague, as the requirements would be uncertain and ambiguous, rendering compliance\n\nimpossible.\n\n       Appellees also present a statutory construction analysis.     They offer that the\n\nMine Safety Act, because it imposes criminal and civil penalties for non-compliance,\n\nmust be strictly construed against the Commonwealth; accordingly, they contend the\n\nimmediate reporting requirements must be limited to the events enumerated in Section\n\n104.   Appellees again emphasize that, if DEP had the power to expand reporting\n\nrequirements, mine operators would be left in a state of uncertainty as to when to\n\nprovide the DEP notice.      Addressing the expansive phrase “including any of the\n\nfollowing” with respect to enumerated events that constitute accidents, Appellees turn to\n\nBlack’s Law Dictionary and assert that the term “including” may expand a meaning, but\n\nalso may merely specify a particular thing already included within general words already\n\nused. Pointing to the prior mine safety statute, Appellees vaguely offer that a policy\n\nissued pursuant to that statute listed 14 events requiring notification, and, although not\n\nidentical to those contained in the present statute, the policy spoke to two events not\n\nincluded in the statute, one relating to ventilation interruptions and one regarding\n\nunplanned connections into abandoned workings.          These two events, as noted by\n\nAppellees, were not included in the 2008 version of the Mine Safety Act and, according\n\nto Appellees, this omission indicates that the legislature did not intend the statute to\n\ninclude these circumstances as reportable accidents.\n\n       Appellees also offer that the General Assembly adopted the federal regulatory list\n\nof accident notifications, limited to the 14 enumerated events as prescribed by federal\n\nlaw. Appellees claim, because the state statute was patterned after the federal law, the\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 17\n\ftwo should be construed together. Construing the two statutes together, Appellees\n\npoint out that the only difference between the statutes is the prefatory language that an\n\naccident was an “unanticipated event, including any of the following.” According to\n\nAppellees, as noted above, this additional text does not change the meaning of the\n\nstatute, and that it is merely consistent with limiting the definition to events prescribed\n\nby federal law.\n\n       Finally, with respect to the requirement of fire extinguishers on scoops, Appellees\n\npoint out that, under Section 273(f) of the Mine Safety Act, operators are required to\n\nequip locomotives, self-propelled mantrip cars, and personnel carriers with one portable\n\nfire extinguisher.   Appellees offer that scoops, like numerous other self-propelled\n\nvehicles used in mining that are equipped with fire suppression systems, are excluded\n\nfrom this requirement; however, the DEP contends that they are “off-track locomotives”\n\nand, thus, required to carry fire extinguishers. According to Appellees, scoops are not\n\nlocomotives, as they are not merely engines used for pulling, but are equipped with a\n\nbucket for scooping material off the mine floor. Further, Appellees note that personnel\n\ncarriers and mantrips are used to move individuals in and out of the mines, but a scoop\n\nhas a single operator with no seats for passengers. Thus, Appellees argue that Section\n\n273(f) simply does not support the DEP’s position that a scoop must carry a fire\n\nextinguisher, and any attempts to require such equipment on that vehicle requires\n\nrulemaking. Finally, Appellees contend that the DEP is entitled to no deference in its\n\ninterpretation of the Mine Safety Act, as the language is clear that scoops are not the\n\ntype of vehicle required to carry portable fire extinguishers.      That being the case,\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 18\n\fAppellees assert that the unambiguous expressed intent of the legislature must be\n\ngiven effect.\n\n       With the arguments of the parties in hand, we turn to the jurisprudential principles\n\nunderlying our review. Specifically, the primary focus of the parties is on the terms of\n\nthe Mine Safety Act. Thus, we necessarily turn to the Statutory Construction Act. 1\n\nPa.C.S.A. §§ 1501 et seq. Pursuant to that Act, the objective of all interpretation and\n\nconstruction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General\n\nAssembly. Id. § 1921(a). The best indication of the legislature’s intent is the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute. When considering statutory language, “[w]ords and phrases\n\nshall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and\n\napproved usage.” Id. § 1903(a). Further, when the words of a statute are clear and\n\nunambiguous, there is no need to go beyond the plain meaning of the language of the\n\nstatute “under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” Id. § 1921(b). Thus, only when the\n\nwords of a statute are ambiguous should a reviewing court seek to ascertain the intent\n\nof the General Assembly through considerations of the various factors found in Section\n\n1921(c). Id. § 1921(c); see generally Bayada Nurses Inc. v. Com. Dept. Labor and\n\nIndus., 8 A.3d 866, 880-81 (Pa. 2010). Finally, an administrative agency’s interpretation\n\nof a governing statute is to be given controlling weight, unless that interpretation is\n\nclearly erroneous. Whitaker Borough v. PLRB, 729 A.2d 1109, 1110 (Pa. 1999).\n\n       We first consider the issue of whether the DEP acted within its authority with\n\nrespect to the administrative orders issued regarding the mine operators’ failure to\n\nreport certain accidents.\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 19\n\f       As noted above, the DEP asserts that it has broad authority to protect miner\n\nhealth and safety.      The Mine Safety Act empowers it to “administer a mine safety\n\nprogram for individuals employed at mines” and to “[i]ssue orders to implement and\n\nenforce the provisions of this act.”         52 P.S. § 690-105(a), (a)(3).   Traditionally,\n\nadministrative agencies enjoy wide latitude in implementing, interpreting, and enforcing\n\ntheir statutory mandate.        Moreover, pursuant to the Mine Safety Act, the DEP is\n\nexpressly charged with certain safety-related responsibilities and enjoys broad powers\n\nin fulfilling its mission in this regard.\n\n       Yet, we need not speak to the breadth of, or limitations on, this general authority\n\nto determine this matter. The parties do not dispute that administrative agencies have\n\nauthority to interpret their guiding statute and that they may enforce that enactment’s\n\nprovisions. Thus, we are able to resolve the issue of whether the DEP properly issued\n\nits orders regarding a failure to report certain accidents on the more narrow grounds of\n\nwhether the DEP properly interpreted the relevant statutory reporting language\n\ncontained in the Act.\n\n       To determine the General Assembly’s intent in this regard, we first look to the\n\nexpress statutory language in question. Pursuant to Section 109 of the Mine Safety Act,\n\nmine operators must notify the DEP of “accidents” that occur at their mines, within 15\n\nminutes of the discovery of the accident. 52 P.S. § 690-109(a)(1). Turning to the\n\ndefinition of “accident,” Section 104 describes an accident as an “unanticipated event,\n\nincluding any of the following . . . .” 52 P.S. § 690-104. Fourteen types of unanticipated\n\nevents follow this introductory phrase, as set forth above.\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-77A&B-2013] - 20\n\f       The focus of the precise controversy here centers upon the meaning of the\n\nphrases “unanticipated event” and “including any of the following.” In sum, the DEP\n\nclaims this language to be expansive, and includes not only the specifically expressed\n\nunintended events, but other unanticipated incidents outside of the list as well, while\n\nAppellees assert that the 14 unanticipated events are exhaustive — i.e., that they are\n\nthe only events which can constitute an “accident” for purposes of the DEP’s\n\nenforcement.\n\n       Initially, we note the definition of “accident” begins with the generic reference to\n\nan “unanticipated event.”    If the General Assembly had intended to limit reportable\n\n“accidents” to the 14 listed events, there would have been no need for the definition to\n\nfirst state that an “accident” is an “unanticipated event.” Indeed, all of the prefatory\n\nlanguage to the 14 examples would be surplusage under the Appellees’ interpretation of\n\nSection 104. Conversely, by employing the phrase “unanticipated event,” the legislature\n\nrendered the understanding of “accident” to be broad in scope and meaning.\n\n      Turning to the next phrase, it is widely accepted that general expressions such\n\nas “including,” or “including but not limited to,” that precede a specific list of included\n\nitems are to be considered as words of enlargement and not limitation. Pa. Human Rel.\n\nComm. v. Alto-Rest Park Cemetery Ass’n., 306 A.2d 881, 885 (Pa. 1973). Indeed, such\n\na list of specific items is not meant to be exclusive of all items other than those\n\nspecifically named. Id. Yet, these terms also should not be construed in their widest\n\ncontext. Under our venerable statutory construction doctrine of ejusdem generis (“of the\n\nsame kind or class”), where specific terms setting forth enumeration of particular\n\nclasses of persons or things follow general terms, the general words will be construed\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 21\n\fas applicable only to persons or things of the same general nature or class as those\n\nenumerated. See Steele v. Statesman Ins. Co., 607 A.2d 742, 743 (Pa. 1992); Summit\n\nHouse Condominium v. Commonwealth, 523 A.2d 333, 336 (Pa. 1987); Breininger v.\n\nSheet Metal Workers Int’l. Ass’n. Loc. Union No. 6, 493 U.S. 67, 91-92 (1989). In sum,\n\nthe presence of such a term as “including” in a definition exhibits a legislative intent that\n\nthe list that follows is not an exhaustive list of items that fall within the definition; yet, any\n\nadditional matters purportedly falling within the definition, but that are not express, must\n\nbe similar to those listed by the legislature and of the same general class or nature.\n\nFurther, contrary to Appellants’ assertions, we find that the term “any,” as used in the\n\nphrase “including any of the following” does not place a limitation on the definition, but,\n\nrather, sharpens the point that the list of 14 events is not exhaustive, but merely\n\nincluded as the type of events that may constitute an accident.\n\n       With these preliminary interpretations in mind, we turn to consideration of the 14\n\nmatters set forth in Section 104. These occurrences include unanticipated events such\n\nas death, serious injury, entrapment of an individual with reasonable potential for\n\nserious injury, inundation of a mine by liquid or gas, unplanned ignition or explosion of\n\ngas or dust, unplanned roof fall that impairs ventilation, an unstable condition requiring\n\nemergency action, and damage to hoisting equipment which endangers an individual or\n\ninterferes with the use of equipment for more than 30 minutes. As is clear from this list,\n\nthe unanticipated events contained in Section 104 all share the common thread of fairly\n\nserious unplanned incidents that potentially pose a serious risk to miners and other\n\nindividuals’ health, safety, or life. Thus, as the DEP has the power to interpret and\n\nenforce the Mine Safety Act, the DEP has the authority to issue administrative orders for\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-77A&B-2013] - 22\n\fa failure to report unanticipated events if they may be regarded as of the same general\n\nclass or nature as those expressly set forth in Section 104 — i.e., those involving fairly\n\nserious incidents potentially impacting the miner or other individual’s health, safety, or\n\nlife.\n\n        Thus, the question then becomes whether the unplanned changes in ventilation\n\nflow and a power failure resulting in an inoperable ventilation system are substantially\n\nsimilar and of the same general class as the expressly listed examples of an unplanned\n\nevent constituting an “accident.”        We believe these unanticipated circumstances\n\noccurring at the Emerald and Cumberland Mines fit comfortably in this class of events.\n\nAs noted by the EHB, Emerald did not dispute the DEP’s contention that the incident at\n\nits mine caused a potential threat to the health and safety of the miners. EHB Opinion,\n\n2/24/2010 at 2.       Indeed, at the Emerald Mine, the change in ventilation was\n\naccompanied by a methane detector being activated. Moreover, with respect to the\n\nCumberland Mine, the EHB explained “there is no dispute that the loss of ventilation\n\ncaused by the malfunctioning equipment posed a potential threat to the health and\n\nsafety of miners, not only directly as a result of the disruption in air flow, but indirectly as\n\na result of the need to commence an evacuation of numerous miners over long\n\ndistances on foot.” Id. at 3.\n\n        Because the accidents alleged by the DEP involving changes in, and cessation\n\nof, air flow to miners were of the same general class and similar to the unanticipated\n\nevents incidents listed in Section 104, we have no hesitation concluding that, based\n\nupon the plain language of Section 104, the DEP was within its authority to issue the\n\nadministrative orders regarding Appellees’ failure to report these unanticipated events.\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-77A&B-2013] - 23\n\fMoreover, our conclusion is made in the light of an administrative agency’s\n\ninterpretation of a governing statute enjoying controlling weight, as noted above, unless\n\nclearly erroneous.\n\n       Appellees’ protestations to the contrary are without merit. Specifically, Appellees’\n\nposition is that, by interpreting Section 104 to include events beyond those expressly\n\nlisted, the DEP engaged in rulemaking, and, if permitted, would make the Safety\n\nBoard’s rulemaking powers superfluous.         Appellees’ argument is overstated.        Our\n\nconclusion that the DEP properly has the authority to interpret and enforce the Mine\n\nSafety Act with respect to the reporting of accidents refutes Appellees’ contention that it\n\nengaged in unlawful rulemaking in contravention to the rulemaking functions of the\n\nSafety Board. The DEP’s interpretation of its governing statute and enforcement of a\n\nbroad statutory directive is not rulemaking. Moreover, while Section 106.1 of the Act\n\nvests the Safety Board with rulemaking powers, permitting the DEP to engage in\n\ntraditional interpretation and enforcement responsibilities, based upon statutory\n\nauthority, would not render the Safety Board’s rulemaking powers superfluous or\n\nredundant, as the Board could, consistent with its statutory powers, promulgate new\n\nrules or amend existing ones. Nor does it avoid or undermine the legislature’s construct\n\nfor rulemaking through the Safety Board. Indeed, every statute should be construed, if\n\npossible, to give effect to all of its provisions, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(a), and the legislature\n\nintends for the entire statute to be effective and certain, id. § 1922(2). Here, there is no\n\nindication that the General Assembly intended that enforcement of the Mine Safety Act\n\nwas solely dependent upon the Safety Board’s promulgation of regulations, and there is\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 24\n\fno evidence of a concomitant legislative intent to strip the DEP of its traditional\n\ninterpretive and enforcement powers. See Butler County; Norristown Area.\n\n      Our determination that both the DEP and the Safety Board are authorized to act\n\nto protect the health and safety of miners — through interpretation and enforcement,\n\nand by rulemaking, respectively — is consistent with these principles. The protection of\n\nminers under the Act may be through enforcement of reasonably interpreted statutory\n\nrequirements and through the formal promulgation of regulations, and both methods\n\nsupport the overarching and laudable purposes of the Mine Safety Act. Moreover, the\n\nauthority conferred upon each of these entities does not mean a diminution in the\n\npowers of the other. Thus, we reject Appellees’ assertion that the DEP’s actions are, in\n\nessence, preempted by the regulation promulgation powers of the Safety Board.\n\n      Further, Appellees contend federal mine safety regulation, through the federal\n\nMine Safety and Health Act, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New\n\nEmergency Response Act, is limited to the enumerated events and that our statute was\n\nbased upon that law.    Thus, we compare the federal mine safety statute with our\n\nCommonwealth’s Mine Safety Act.\n\n      The federal definition is limited, and offers that “accident means” one of 12 listed\n\nitems. 30 CFR § 50.2(h). By its express terms, Pennsylvania’s Mine Safety Act’s\n\ndefinition is clearly broader, including in the definition that the matter be an\n\n“unanticipated event,” and, more importantly, using the above-stated broadening\n\nverbiage, “including any of the following.” While Appellees claim that the Mine Safety\n\nAct is based upon the federal statute, and should be limited to the enumerated items\n\n\n\n\n                                 [J-77A&B-2013] - 25\n\fcontained therein, the express words of the Mine Safety Act command a different\n\nconclusion.5\n\n      Also, as noted above, Appellees offer somewhat cursory arguments that\n\nembracing the DEP’s interpretation of Section 104 would constitute an unconstitutional\n\ndelegation of legislative power and would render the statute unconstitutionally vague.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n      The legislature may not constitutionally delegate its power to make, alter, and\n\nrepeal laws to other branches of government or to any other body or authority. It may,\n\nhowever, delegate authority and discretion in connection with the execution and\n\nadministration of its law, and it may establish primary guidelines and bestow upon\n\nothers the duty to carry out declared legislative policy in accordance with the general\n\nprovisions of the enabling legislation. The touchstone of such delegation is that it is for\n\nthe General Assembly to make basic policy choices. Pennsylvanians Against Gambling\n\nExpansion Fund v. Commonwealth, 877 A.2d 383, 417 (Pa. 2005).              In determining\n\nwhether the legislature has established adequate standards, a court must consider the\n\nlanguage of the statute, the underlying purpose of the statute, and its reasonable effect.\n\nBlackwell v. State Ethics Comm’n., 567 A.2d 630, 636-37 (Pa. 1989).\n\n\n\n5\n  Appellees’ reliance upon our decision in Cohen, supra, fails for the same reason. In\nthat matter, a pharmacist’s license was suspended for “grossly unprofessional conduct.”\n63 P.S. § 390-5(a)(9). Under the Pharmacy Act, “grossly unprofessional conduct”\nconsisted of 13 specific prohibitions. The statutory provision, unlike the section at issue\nin this appeal, was limited to certain specifically enumerated grounds, and did not\ninclude any broadening language. Our Court reasoned that the legislature specifically\nintended to define “grossly unprofessional conduct” by the 13 enumerated grounds,\nand, thus, the State Board of Pharmacy could not expand that definition in the absence\nof statute or rule. Cohen, 292 A.2d at 282-83.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 26\n\f          We find that the statutory language employed by the General Assembly explains\n\nin sufficient detail the type of unanticipated events which constitute reportable accidents\n\nunder the Mine Safety Act. It reflects not only basic policy choices, but a specifically\n\narticulated class of events which must be reported to the DEP.                Further, this\n\nunderstanding of the definition of “accident” is entirely consistent with the underlying\n\npurpose of the Mine Safety Act, which could not be clearer: “[t]o use the full extent of\n\nthe Commonwealth’s powers to protect the lives, health and safety of miners and others\n\nin and about underground bituminous coal mines.” 52 P.S. § 690-103(b)(1). Finally, the\n\nreasonable effect of the statute is to place mine operators on reasonable notice of the\n\ntypes of unanticipated events which constitute accidents, and which are reportable to\n\nthe DEP.        In sum, Section 104, and the DEP’s interpretation thereof, does not\n\nimpermissibly delegate to the DEP basic legislative policy choices regarding mine\n\nsafety.\n\n          Further, we find that our interpretation today does not, as Appellees have argued,\n\nrender the Mine Safety Act unconstitutionally vague.          Under a void-for-vagueness\n\nchallenge, a statute will be found unconstitutional only if the enactment is so vague that\n\npersons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to\n\nits application. Commonwealth v. Cotto, 753 A.2d 217, 220 (Pa. 2000). A statute will\n\npass a vagueness attack if the statute defines the objectionable conduct “with sufficient\n\ndefiniteness, that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a\n\nmanner that does not encourage              arbitrary and    discriminatory enforcement.”\n\nCommonwealth v. Bullock, 913 A.2d 207, 212 (Pa. 2006). In essence, a statute must\n\ngive fair warning as to the conduct it penalizes.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-77A&B-2013] - 27\n\f        In defining the term “accident,” the General Assembly has offered 14 examples of\n\nthe types of unanticipated events that it intended to be covered by the Act and subject\n\nto its notice requirements. As noted above, all 14 examples are events which are fairly\n\nserious incidents potentially impacting the miner or other individual’s health, safety, or\n\nlife.   Contrary to Appellees’ assertion that mine operators will be left in a state of\n\nuncertainty, we find that these examples provide sufficient guidance and definiteness\n\nregarding the nature of unanticipated events that constitute reportable accidents such\n\nthat ordinary individuals are able to understand what conduct is required to be reported,\n\nand in our view, such statutory definition does not encourage arbitrary and\n\ndiscriminatory enforcement.     Commonwealth v. Davidson, 938 A.2d 198, 207 (Pa.\n\n2007). Moreover, as offered by Judge Pellegrini in his dissenting opinion below, if a\n\nbyproduct of this broader understanding of reportable accidents is the over-reporting of\n\nincidents in an abundance of caution, such effect will increase the safety of miners, an\n\noutcome consistent with the overall purpose of the Act. Cumberland Coal Resources,\n\n29 A.3d at 436 (Pellegrini, J. dissenting).\n\n        For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that the DEP acted within its statutory\n\nauthority when it issued the administrative orders regarding Appellees’ failure to report\n\nthe “accidents” at issue, as they were of the same general class or nature as those\n\nexpressly set forth in Section 104 — i.e., those involving fairly serious incidents\n\npotentially impacting miner’s or other individual’s health, safety, or life.    Thus, we\n\nreverse the order of the Commonwealth Court on this issue.\n\n        We next turn to the DEP’s sanctioning of Appellees for a failure to comply with\n\nSection 273 of the Mine Safety Act which requires a portable fire extinguisher for certain\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 28\n\fmining vehicles.    Specifically, Section 273 requires that each “track or off-track\n\nlocomotive, self-propelled mantrip car or personnel carrier shall be equipped with one\n\nportable fire extinguisher.” 52 P.S. § 690-273(f). The DEP considered the scoops at\n\nissue in this appeal to be “off-track locomotives,” requiring a portable fire extinguisher.\n\nAppellees, as noted above, refute this understanding and, instead, assert that a scoop,\n\nwhich has a shovel, is used to remove coal, and is driven by a single individual, is not a\n\nlocomotive, as a locomotive pushes or pulls cars and a scoop does not. As a scoop is\n\nnot a locomotive, Appellees assert that the DEP was without authority to require a\n\nportable fire extinguisher on such vehicles.\n\n      As with the prior issue on appeal, our initial focus in resolving this issue is on the\n\nlanguage employed by the legislature in the statute, in this instance, to determine if the\n\nDEP erred in applying the portable fire extinguisher requirement to scoops. We note\n\nthat Section 273 is specific, limited in scope, and lacks any broader “including” language\n\nfound in Section 104. The provision lists three particular pieces of mining transportation\n\nvehicles which require a portable fire extinguisher. Focusing on the term “locomotive,”\n\ndictionaries commonly provide that a locomotive is a “self-propelled engine, now usually\n\nelectric or diesel-powered, that pulls or pushes freight or passenger cars on railroad\n\ntracks.” American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Houghton Mifflin Morris\n\n766 (ed. Boston 1996). Conversely, a “scoop” is a battery-powered, four wheel vehicle\n\nwith a single operator seat that is equipped with a bucket and used in underground\n\nmines to transport tools, materials, and coal from one location to another in the mine; it\n\ndoes not pull or push anything. Scoops are used daily and travel throughout a mine.\n\nR.R. 98a. While, generally, scoops are equipped with fire suppression systems, the\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 29\n\fscoop battery, which is large and can accumulate coal dust, is not protected by a fire\n\nsuppression system. Id. We also note that the other vehicles listed — a mantrip car\n\nand personnel carriers — just as the terms connote, are vehicles used for shuttling and\n\ncarrying miners, and scoops are neither used to transport miners nor pull cars of\n\nsupplies or coal.\n\n       By its plain and narrow language, the statutory portable fire extinguisher\n\nrequirement is limited to three statutorily enumerated types of vehicles, none of which\n\nspecifically include, or could reasonably be understood to include, a scoop or scoop-like\n\nvehicle. A scoop does not pull or push freight or passenger cars. Nor does a scoop\n\nmove individuals in and out of a mine, like a mantrip car or personnel carrier, as a scoop\n\nhas a single operator seat with no room for passengers. Indeed, consistent with our\n\ndiscussion above regarding the definition of “accident,” if a scoop were substantially\n\nsimilar to these vehicles, or in the same general class, the DEP’s interpretation may\n\nhave more validity; but to interpret the definition of “locomotive” to include a scoop\n\nwould be to stretch the plain meaning of the term used by the General Assembly\n\nbeyond the breaking point. Consistent with the limited statutory language delineating\n\nthe specific types of vehicles encompassed by this statutory provision, we find that\n\nscoops fall outside of the requirements of Section 273.          While an administrative\n\nagency’s interpretation of a governing statute is to be given controlling weight, there are\n\nlimitations, and here, based upon the plain language of the statute, the DEP’s\n\ninterpretation of Section 273 was clearly erroneous. Whitaker Borough, supra.\n\n       The DEP hinted as much in its argument before the Commonwealth Court,\n\nwherein it took the position that a scoop was a locomotive, but nevertheless suggested\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 30\n\fthat, even if not a locomotive, because mandating fire extinguishers is safety related, it\n\nwas a permissible exercise of its authority. The DEP points to Section 501 of the Act\n\nwhich permits the DEP to “effectuate the purposes of this act and to protect the health\n\nand safety of miners and individuals in and about mines.”            52 P.S. § 690-501.\n\nAccording to the DEP, this section, pertaining to enforcement powers and remedies,\n\nexpands upon the already broad powers enjoyed by the DEP and allows it to issue\n\norders to mine operators to perform actions not contemplated by statute or regulation\n\nfor the purpose of promoting miner safety. We do not doubt that the DEP enjoys broad\n\npowers to carry out the laudable and essential purposes of the Mine Safety Act, and,\n\nmore specifically, that requiring a portable fire extinguisher to be carried by scoops may\n\nbe exceedingly prudent; however, the DEP’s suggestion that, simply because it is safety\n\nrelated, it can require fire extinguishers on all vehicles, even if they are not statutorily\n\nrequired, would be to arrogate a power without a statutory basis, make it virtually\n\nimpossible for a mine operator to reasonably understand what was required of it so as\n\nto comply with the law, and to raise the specter of constitutional infirmity on the basis of\n\nvagueness.\n\n       Thus, we find that the DEP acted outside of its statutory authority when it\n\nincluded a scoop in the limited vehicular category of locomotive, mantrip car, or\n\npersonnel carrier, which require a portable fire extinguisher, and, therefore, we affirm\n\nthe Commonwealth Court’s order with respect to this issue.\n\n       For all of the above-stated reasons, we hold that (1) the DEP acted within its\n\nstatutory authority when it issued the administrative orders to Appellees for their failure\n\nto report the “accidents” at issue in this appeal, under 52 P.S. § 690-104; but (2) the\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 31\n\fDEP acted outside its authority when it required scoops to be equipped with a portable\n\nfire extinguisher under 52 P.S. § 690-273(f). Thus, we reverse in part, and affirm in\n\npart, the order of the Commonwealth Court.\n\n      Jurisdiction relinquished.\n\n      Mr. Chief Justice Castille and Messrs.

Thus, we reverse in part, and\n\naffirm in part, the order of the Commonwealth Court.\n\n         Before we consider the specifics of this appeal, a brief overview of the law\n\nconcerning mine safety in our Commonwealth is in order.              Historically, and not\n\nsurprisingly, the mining of underground coal in Pennsylvania has been widely\n\nconsidered a dangerous endeavor. While significant improvements in mining safety\n\nhave been achieved over the years, the recent events at the 2002 Quecreek Mine\n\naccident in Somerset County Pennsylvania, where nine miners were trapped for three\n\ndays in a flooded mine shaft, made manifest the continued perilousness of mining.\n\nWhile the federal government regulates mining in Pennsylvania through the Mine Safety\n\nand Health Administration Act, as amended by the Mine Improvement Emergency\n\nResponse Act,2 state governments are permitted to regulate mining as well, and our\n\nCommonwealth has done so for over 100 years.\n\n         Specifically, the progenitor of Pennsylvania’s Bituminous Coal Mine Safety Act,\n\nentitled the Bituminous Coal Mine Act, was originally codified in 1883. The most recent\n\nversion of the statute was drafted in 1961 and constituted the first comprehensive\n\nmining legislation designed to regulate mining safety practices. The 1961 version of the\n\nAct included various provisions concerning safety, including inspectors being tasked\n\n\n1\n    Act of July 7, 2008, P.L. 654, No. 55, 52 P.S. §§ 690-101 to 690-708.\n2\n    30 U.S.C. § 801-878.\n\n\n\n                                    [J-77A&B-2013] - 2\n\fwith inspecting mines on a regular basis, with the ultimate purpose being to protect the\n\nhealth and safety of miners.\n\n       In 2008, after years of work among industry, workers, and government\n\nrepresentatives, the retitled “Bituminous Coal Mine Safety Act of 2008” (“Mine Safety\n\nAct” or “Act”), at issue herein, was unanimously enacted by the General Assembly.\n\nStressing the theme of the statute, the legislature’s findings declared that the “first\n\npriority and concern of all in the bituminous coal mining industry must be the health and\n\nsafety of those who work in and at mines and others in and about mines.” 52 P.S. §\n\n690-103(a)(1).      Consistent therewith, the General Assembly added to the multiple\n\ndeclared purposes of the Act, including “[t]o use the full extent of the Commonwealth’s\n\npowers to protect the lives, health and safety of miners and others in and about\n\nunderground bituminous coal mines.” Id. § 690-103(b)(1).\n\n       Three aspects of the recent legislation are particularly noteworthy for purposes of\n\nthe matter before us. First, pursuant to Section 109 of the Mine Safety Act, mine\n\noperators must notify the DEP of “accidents” that occur at their mines, within 15 minutes\n\nof the discovery of the accident. 52 P.S. § 690-109(a)(1). Unlike its predecessor, the\n\nAct provides a broad definition to the operative term “accident” as follows:\n\n              “Accident.” An unanticipated event, including any of the\n              following:\n              (1)    A death of an individual at a mine.\n              (2) An injury to an individual at a mine, which has a\n              reasonable potential to cause death.\n              (3) An entrapment of an individual at a mine which has a\n              reasonable potential to cause death or serious injury.\n              (4)    An unplanned inundation of a mine by a liquid or a gas.\n              (5)    An unplanned ignition or explosion of gas or dust.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-77A&B-2013] - 3\n\f                (6) An unplanned mine fire not extinguished within ten\n                minutes of discovery.\n                (7) An unplanned ignition or explosion of a blasting agent\n                or an explosive.\n                (8) An unplanned roof fall at or above the anchorage zone\n                in active workings where roof bolts are in use.\n                (9) An unplanned roof or rib fall in active workings that\n                impairs ventilation or impedes passage.\n                (10) A coal or rock outburst that causes withdrawal of\n                miners or which disrupts regular mining activity for more than\n                one hour.\n                (11) An unstable condition at an impoundment or refuse pile\n                which does any of the following:\n                      (i) Requires emergency action in order to prevent\n                failure.\n                     (ii) Causes individuals to evacuate an area.\n                (12) Failure of an impoundment or refuse pile.\n                (13) Damage to hoisting equipment in a shaft or slope which\n                endangers an individual or which interferes with use of the\n                equipment for more than 30 minutes.\n                (14) An event at a mine which causes death or bodily injury\n                to an individual not at the mine at the time the event occurs.\n52 P.S. § 690-104.\n\n      Second, the Mine Safety Act requires certain vehicles to carry portable fire\n\nextinguishers. Specifically, “[e]ach track or off-track locomotive, self-propelled mantrip\n\ncar or personnel carrier shall be equipped with one portable fire extinguisher.” 52 P.S.\n\n§ 690-273(f).\n\n      Third, the Act created the Board of Coal Mine Safety (“Safety Board” or “Board”),\n\nwhich was established to provide the means to rapidly respond to changes in mining\n\ntechnology and conditions.       52 P.S. § 690-106.       The Board, comprised of seven\n\nmembers representing the DEP, workers, and owner/operators, is given the authority to\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-77A&B-2013] - 4\n\fwrite amendments to interim mandatory safety standards, as well as promulgate new\n\nmine safety regulations.\n\n       With this history and relevant legal background in hand, we turn to the facts\n\nunderlying this appeal, which are largely undisputed and involve alleged violations of\n\nthe Mine Safety Act at mines in the southwestern part of the Commonwealth. The\n\ninstant case arises out of several orders issued by the DEP to Appellees as a result of\n\nAppellees’ alleged failure to report various incidents that purportedly compromised the\n\nsafety of their mines — i.e., the alleged failure to report an “accident” — as well as\n\nAppellees’ alleged failure to maintain proper fire protection equipment.         We first\n\nconsider the charges of a failure to report an “accident.”\n\n       Appellee Emerald Coal Resources L.P. (“Emerald”) engages in underground\n\nbituminous coal mining at its Emerald Mine in Wayne Township, Greene County,\n\nPennsylvania. On January 19, 2009, at approximately 10:00 p.m., a crew of miners\n\nworking in the B-7 section of the operation mined through into the adjoining B-6 section.\n\nA plan for the cut through had been prepared and a mine examiner was to be sent and\n\nstationed at the B-6 section to wait for and listen for the approach of the mining crew in\n\nthe B-7 section. The plan also required the mine examiner to close two doors that the\n\ncompany had erected for the purpose of maintaining safe ventilation in the mine\n\nfollowing the cut through. Although the mine examiner went to the B-6 area, he did not\n\nremain there, and the doors stood open at the time of the cut through. Due to the doors\n\nremaining open, the ventilation in the area was affected. Specifically, a witness to the\n\ncut through felt the air along a conveyer belt reverse, and he could feel the heat from\n\nthe feeder on his face. Additionally, a methane detector on a shuttle car sounded an\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 5\n\falarm. Once certain protective measures were taken at the cut through, employees\n\nentered the B-6 area and closed the doors, resulting in the ventilation returning to its\n\nproper path.\n\n       Emerald did not notify the DEP of the incident. Thus, on January 30, 2009, the\n\nDEP issued an administrative order for Emerald’s violation of Section 109 of the Mine\n\nSafety Act for failing to report this “accident,” even though Section 104 does not list a\n\nventilation disruption as a specific reportable accident.\n\n       Appellee Cumberland Coal Resources L.P. (“Cumberland”) is the owner and\n\noperator of Cumberland Mine in Waynesburg, Greene County, Pennsylvania.                   At\n\napproximately 2:00 a.m. on February 12, 2009, an electrical storm resulted in a power\n\noutage at its mine that caused a fan in the mine’s ventilation system to stop working.\n\nThe mine’s backup power system also failed to start after the loss of power, and, as a\n\nresult, the mine’s ventilation system at the No. 5 bleeder shaft was inoperable for over\n\n16 minutes. The diesel powered back-up system, which should have automatically\n\nbeen triggered, failed to operate. Ultimately, a fan monitoring system alerted surface\n\npersonnel of the stoppage, and an electrician restarted the fan. The Mine Safety Act\n\nrequires mine operators to evacuate the mine when a ventilation system is down for 15\n\nminutes or more; however, such an event is not included in Section 104’s list of\n\n“accidents” subject to reporting requirements. Cumberland did not notify the DEP of the\n\nfan outage, and the DEP issued an administrative order for the violation.\n\n       Turning to the alleged fire equipment maintenance violations, as noted above,\n\nthe Mine Safety Act requires certain vehicles to contain portable fire extinguishers. The\n\nDEP,   interpreting   “off-track   locomotive”   to   include   “scoops,”   issued   multiple\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-77A&B-2013] - 6\n\fadministrative orders and notices of violation to both Cumberland and Appellee Amfire\n\nMining Co. (“Amfire”) for failing to equip their scoops with portable fire extinguishers in\n\nviolation of Section 273(f) of the Mine Safety Act. A scoop is a “battery-powered, four-\n\nwheeled vehicle equipped with a bucket” used “to transport tools, materials, and coal”\n\nthroughout the mine. EHB Opinion, 3/16/10, at 2. Scoops have only one seat for the\n\noperator’s use, and do not transport other miners. Id.\n\n       Emerald and Cumberland appealed their administrative orders to the\n\nEnvironmental Hearing Board (“EHB”), arguing they were not required to report the\n\nincidents that occurred at their mines because the incidents were not “accidents” as\n\ncontemplated by Section 104 of the Mine Safety Act. The EHB consolidated these two\n\ncases, and the DEP moved for summary judgment, arguing the events occurring at both\n\nmines did, in fact, constitute “accidents” under Section 104 that required reporting under\n\nSection 109(a)(1).\n\n      Cumberland and Amfire also filed appeals to the EHB from the administrative\n\norders issued regarding their failure to provide fire extinguishers on scoops, which were\n\nconsolidated for review.    The DEP and Cumberland/Amfire filed cross motions for\n\nsummary judgment concerning whether a scoop constitutes a “locomotive” under\n\nSection 273(f) and whether the DEP had the authority under the Mine Safety Act to\n\nissue orders requiring Cumberland and Amfire to supply fire extinguishers for scoops.\n\n      The EHB denied the DEP’s motions in both appeals. In the Emerald/Cumberland\n\nmatter, the EHB found the DEP lacked the authority to issue orders effectively\n\nexpanding Section 104’s list of “accidents” to include the incidents that occurred at the\n\nEmerald and Cumberland mines.          As to the Cumberland/Amfire matter, the EHB\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 7\n\fdetermined a scoop was not a “locomotive” within the meaning of Section 273(f), and,\n\nthus, that the DEP erred in citing Cumberland and Amfire for violating the Mine Safety\n\nAct. The DEP appealed both decisions to the Commonwealth Court.\n\n      The Commonwealth Court consolidated the appeals and affirmed.                DEP v.\n\nCumberland Coal Resources, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. Cmwlth. 2011). First, the court held\n\nEmerald and Cumberland did not violate the reporting requirements of Section\n\n109(a)(1). In reaching this conclusion, the court looked to the definition of “accident” in\n\nSection 104 and noted the definition was subject to two different interpretations: the use\n\nof the word “including” before the list of events could signify that the list was not\n\nintended to be exclusive, and the use of the word “any” in the phrase “any of the\n\nfollowing” could mean that the General Assembly intended the list to be exclusive. As\n\nsuch, the court determined Section 104 was ambiguous, and it deferred to the DEP’s\n\nreasonable interpretation of the definition of “accident” as allowing additional events of\n\nthe same general kind or class as those expressly set forth in the list.        The court\n\nconcluded, however, that the DEP could not expand this list through the adjudicatory\n\nprocess, as the General Assembly vested the Safety Board with the authority to develop\n\nthe Mine Safety Act through rulemaking, and gave the DEP no such power.\n\nAccordingly, the court opined that the DEP’s powers under the Mine Safety Act are\n\nlimited to enforcing the express provisions of the Act and any regulations promulgated\n\nby the Safety Board. According to the court, were it to hold otherwise, the DEP could\n\nexpand the list of “accidents” on a case by case basis without giving mine operators any\n\nadvanced notice, effectively punishing operators for failing to act when they had no\n\nreason to know action was required.\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 8\n\f       The court also rejected the DEP’s alternative argument that it had authority to\n\nissue the administrative orders pursuant to its general enforcement powers under\n\nSections 105 and 501 of the Mine Safety Act. The court observed that Sections 105\n\nand 501 contain no language giving the DEP authority to create rules and requirements\n\nunder the Act, and it further opined that the General Assembly would not have expressly\n\nprovided for an expedited reporting requirement for “accidents” in Section 109(a)(1) if it\n\nalso allowed the DEP to use its general enforcement powers under Sections 105 and\n\n501 to impose a similar reporting requirement for events not included in the definition of\n\n“accident.”\n\n       As to the issue of whether the DEP established that Cumberland and Amfire\n\nviolated Section 273(f) by failing to provide fire extinguishers for their scoops, the court\n\nheld the DEP’s interpretation of the term “locomotive” to include scoops was erroneous.\n\nIn so holding, the court noted the General Assembly did not define the term “locomotive”\n\nin the Act, and it relied on both the technical and common dictionary definitions of\n\n“locomotive,” which both define “locomotive” as a “powered vehicle used to move\n\nnonpowered vehicles.” As scoops do not move nonpowered vehicles, the court agreed\n\nwith the EHB that they were not locomotives and, thus, not subject to the requirements\n\nof Section 273(f). Additionally, for the same reasons the court held the DEP could not\n\nrely on its enforcement powers to expand the list of “accidents” under the Act, the court\n\nfound the DEP also could not rely on its general enforcement powers under Sections\n\n105 and 501 to require fire extinguishers to be placed on scoops.\n\n       Notably, Judge Pellegrini filed a vigorous dissent joined by Judges Leadbetter\n\nand McCullough. Therein, Judge Pellegrini focused solely on the issue of the reporting\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 9\n\frequirements of Section 109, and disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that the DEP\n\nwas precluded from expanding the list of “accidents” in Section 104, as the Mine Safety\n\nAct contained no language indicating that enforcement of the Act depended on the\n\nSafety Board’s enactment of regulations.      According to Judge Pellegrini, to hold\n\notherwise would allow the Safety Board to become a quasi-enforcement body, hindering\n\nthe enforcement of the Mine Safety Act and the safety of miners.\n\n       We granted allocatur in the consolidated appeals, in sum, to address the scope\n\nof DEP’s authority to interpret the Mine Safety Act beyond its express provisions with\n\nrespect to the reporting of accidents and its authority to require portable fire\n\nextinguishers on certain mining vehicles.    As the issues on appeal are pure legal\n\nquestions, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary.\n\nBuffalo Twp. v.

Moreover, as the issues\n\noverlap regarding the breadth of the DEP’s authority, we will consider the issues stated\n\nabove collectively.\n\n       The DEP first asserts that it acted under its authority as recognized by our\n\nCourt’s prior precedent when issuing its administrative orders in enforcing the Mine\n\nSafety Act.

Specifically, the\n\nDEP offers that, in Butler County, during an inspection of the Mushroom Farm, the DER\n\nnoted a problem in tracking every person who was underground in the limestone mines\n\nin which the mushrooms were grown. The DER observed that, while the Mushroom\n\nFarm identified every hourly employee underground, it did not have a process to identify\n\nsupervisors, independent contractors, repairmen, or visitors, including high school\n\nstudents on tours. This was critical to the DER, as, in the event of a fire, the absence of\n\nindividuals in the mines would allow rescuers to avoid embarking upon an unnecessary\n\nand dangerous search and rescue mission.           In response, the DER ordered the\n\nMushroom Farm to develop and implement a system to track all individuals in the\n\nmines. The Mushroom Farm appealed the order to the EHB, contending the DER did\n\nnot have legal authority to issue such an order. While the EHB affirmed the issuance of\n\nthe order, on appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed.\n\n       DEP points to our Court’s resolution of the issue in favor of the DER, noting that\n\nthe adjudicatory power was a customary and vital tool in the operation of administrative\n\nagencies, that unforeseeable circumstances required flexibility, and that the choice of\n\n\n3\n  The General Assembly changed the agency’s name from the DER to the DEP, created\na new agency, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (“DCNR”), and\nassigned to the new agency some of the responsibilities which previously had been\nassigned to the DER. Management of the Commonwealth’s state parks and forests\nwere the primary functions vested in the new DCNR. 71 P.S. § 340.101, et seq.\n4\n  Act of May 18, 1937, P.L. 654, as amended, 43 P.S. §§ 25-1 et seq.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 11\n\fproceeding by general rule or by individual ad hoc litigation was for the discretion of the\n\nadministrative agency. Butler County, 434 A.2d at 4 n.2. Although the text of the\n\nGeneral Safety Law spoke only of “instructions,” the DEP stresses that our Court\n\nnevertheless concluded that the statute authorized the issuance of the administrative\n\norders. Indeed, the DEP notes that our Court went further and held that the DER’s\n\nability to issue such orders extended beyond the borders of the statute itself. Id. at 8.\n\n       The DEP further points out that this Court in Butler County relied upon our prior\n\ndecision in Norristown Area, wherein we affirmed, in the context of ending school\n\nsegregation, that the Human Relations Commission could act by rule-making or on a\n\ncase-by-case basis through litigation. The DEP emphasizes that our Court held that\n\nthere was no abuse of discretion on the part of the Commission by choosing to proceed\n\nto remedy segregation through adjudication proceedings.\n\n       The DEP maintains that it relied upon this precedent to issue the administrative\n\norders in the matters before us, and that both mandating reporting to the DEP about life\n\nendangering mining incidents, and requiring fire extinguishers on scoops, were\n\nconsistent with and furthered the purposes of the Mine Safety Act. Indeed, the DEP\n\nsubmits that it was merely interpreting a statute that it is responsible for implementing,\n\nand, with respect to reporting, a statute that contains a non-exhaustive list of already\n\nexisting statutory requirements.\n\n       The DEP further challenges what it regards as the Commonwealth Court’s overly\n\nrestrictive construction of the Mine Safety Act, arguing that it is both contrary to the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute and the General Assembly’s intent to modernize the\n\nCommonwealth’s mine safety laws.         Specifically, the DEP cites Section 105, which\n\n\n                                    [J-77A&B-2013] - 12\n\fgrants to the DEP the “power and the duty to administer a mine safety program for\n\nindividuals employed at mines,” including the power to “[i]ssue orders to implement and\n\nenforce the provisions of this act.” 52 P.S. § 690-105(1), (3). The DEP contends this is\n\none of the many enumerated powers and duties conferred on the DEP as part of its\n\noverall power and duty to administer the mine safety program. Even more broadly, the\n\nDEP points to its power to issue written orders “to enforce this act, to effectuate the\n\npurposes of this act and to protect the health and safety of miners and individuals in and\n\nabout mines.” 52 P.S. § 690-501(a). Thus, according to the DEP, the express and\n\nexpansive authority conferred by the Mine Safety Act upon the DEP allows it to issue\n\nadministrative orders requiring actions not specifically expressed by statute that\n\npromote safety.\n\n       Building on this argument, the DEP maintains that the General Assembly\n\nsubstantially re-wrote the prior existing law, created the Safety Board to promulgate\n\nregulations, and empowered the DEP to issue orders to protect miner safety. The DEP\n\nsubmits that the Act contains nothing that would suggest the Safety Board’s authority to\n\npromulgate regulations dilutes the DEP’s adjudicatory authority under the Act, and\n\ncontends that both provisions should be given full force and effect to protect the “lives,\n\nhealth and safety of miners and others in and about underground bituminous coal\n\nmines.” 52 P.S. § 690-103(1).\n\n       The DEP further avers that it is its interpretation of the Mine Safety Act,\n\npermitting it to issue administrative orders for incidents not expressly provided for in the\n\nAct, that is entitled to deference.    According to the DEP, the Safety Board is the\n\n“administrative legislative branch” which enacts regulations, but it is the DEP which\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 13\n\fpossesses specialized knowledge of, and the greatest practical experience with, mine\n\nsafety issues. The DEP asserts it interpreted and applied the Mine Safety Act to the\n\nincidents at issue, in light of the expansive definition of the statutory term “accident” and\n\nthe requirement to provide notice to the DEP. In concluding that the mine operators\n\nshould have provided notice of the incidents at issue, the DEP reasons that it was\n\nmerely exercising its prerogative to interpret the statute as it deemed appropriate, as\n\nlong as that interpretation is consistent with the Mine Safety Act. Similarly, DEP asserts\n\nthat it reasonably determined that scoops fell within the term “off-track locomotive”\n\nunder the Mine Safety Act and ordered operators to equip such vehicles with fire\n\nextinguishers.\n\n       The DEP also offers various tenets of statutory construction in support of its\n\nposition. Specifically, the DEP points out that the General Assembly is presumed to\n\nintend that all provisions in a statute are to be given effect, citing 1 Pa.C.S.A.\n\n§§ 1921(a), 1922(2). Here, it notes Section 106 of the Act empowers the Safety Board\n\nto promulgate appropriate regulations to protect the health and safety of miners and\n\nothers, and consistent therewith, Section 501 of the Act empowers the DEP to issue\n\nwritten orders.\n\n       In response, Appellees’ primary contention is that the Commonwealth Court\n\nproperly determined that the DEP was without authority under Section 501 and 105 of\n\nthe Mine Safety Act to issue administrative orders that had the effect of creating new\n\nevents constituting “accidents” under Section 104.        Stated another way, Appellees\n\nmaintain that the definition of “accidents” in Section 104 of the Mine Safety Act is\n\nexhaustive and the DEP cannot expand the listing of events contained therein.\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 14\n\f       Appellees offer that the General Assembly bifurcated the compliance and\n\nrulemaking functions under the Mine Safety Act, as Section 106.1 explicitly vested the\n\nSafety Board with broad rulemaking authority, and reserved implementation and\n\nenforcement powers to the DEP under Sections 105 and 501. According to Appellees,\n\nif the DEP were able to, in essence, engage in rulemaking as well as issue\n\nadministrative orders, it would undermine the legislature’s intent to grant sole\n\nrulemaking power to the Safety Board, and would make the Safety Board’s rulemaking\n\npowers superfluous and redundant.\n\n       Appellees contend that not only does the DEP lack authority to issue\n\nadministrative orders expanding the requirements of the Act, but that the DEP offers no\n\neffort to define or limit the scope of this “catch-all” authority. This, Appellees stress, is\n\nmarkedly unfair, given the criminal and civil penalties that accompany a violation of the\n\nMine Safety Act and results in an ad hoc process in which the mine operator would\n\nhave no notice of the statute’s requirements and anticipating its reporting requirements.\n\nAppellees urge that this is especially true where the rule requires reporting an event\n\nwithin 15 minutes of an accident. Indeed, Appellees submit that a general authority\n\ngiven to DEP based upon an obligation to protect “health and safety” of miners, without\n\nany specific meaning, would prevent a mine operator from being proactive in complying\n\nwith the Act.\n\n       Appellees also offer our decision in Pa. State Bd. of Pharm. v. Cohen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">277</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 1972), in which our Court considered a pharmacist’s appeal of the suspension\n\nof his license by the Board of Pharmacy for “grossly unprofessional conduct” under the\n\nPharmacy Act. While not violating any of the specifically enumerated grounds that\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 15\n\fconstituted “grossly unprofessional conduct,” the Board of Pharmacy nevertheless took\n\nthe position that such prohibitions were not intended to be exclusive, but only an\n\nexemplary description of the prohibited conduct which served as guidance to the Board.\n\nAppellees point out that our Court rejected such a claim of expansive powers, instead\n\nlimiting the meaning of “gross unprofessional conduct” to those listed in the statute.\n\nCohen, 292 A.2d at 280-81. Appellees argue that the DEP should defer to the Board’s\n\nrulemaking powers to clarify which events constituted “accidents,” and what equipment\n\nmust be provided with fire extinguishers. Further, Appellees distinguish Butler County\n\nand Norristown Area as being factually unique and arising in the context of statutes that\n\ndid not delegate rulemaking authority to a board. According to Appellees, the DEP is\n\nimproperly trying to prescribe general rules of conduct via adjudication, yet, the line of\n\ndemarcation between rulemaking and enforcement under the Mine Safety Act prohibits\n\nthe DEP’s approach.\n\n       Further, Appellees maintain that, in the event that this Court finds that Section\n\n104 is not exclusive, and the General Assembly intended to grant unlimited power to the\n\nDEP, such a grant of “catch-all” power would be unconstitutional, as an impermissible\n\ndelegation of legislative power in violation of Pa. Const. art. 2, § 1.      According to\n\nAppellees, the DEP in this instance is acting as a super-legislature and in a fashion\n\ncontrary to what the legislature intended when creating the Board. Appellees urge that\n\nthis is true for the DEP’s expansion of what constitutes an “accident,” as well as its\n\ndecision to require fire extinguishers on scoops.          Similarly, Appellees make a\n\nconstitutional argument that any application of “catch-all” authority is unconstitutionally\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 16\n\fvague, as the requirements would be uncertain and ambiguous, rendering compliance\n\nimpossible.\n\n       Appellees also present a statutory construction analysis.     They offer that the\n\nMine Safety Act, because it imposes criminal and civil penalties for non-compliance,\n\nmust be strictly construed against the Commonwealth; accordingly, they contend the\n\nimmediate reporting requirements must be limited to the events enumerated in Section\n\n104.   Appellees again emphasize that, if DEP had the power to expand reporting\n\nrequirements, mine operators would be left in a state of uncertainty as to when to\n\nprovide the DEP notice.      Addressing the expansive phrase “including any of the\n\nfollowing” with respect to enumerated events that constitute accidents, Appellees turn to\n\nBlack’s Law Dictionary and assert that the term “including” may expand a meaning, but\n\nalso may merely specify a particular thing already included within general words already\n\nused. Pointing to the prior mine safety statute, Appellees vaguely offer that a policy\n\nissued pursuant to that statute listed 14 events requiring notification, and, although not\n\nidentical to those contained in the present statute, the policy spoke to two events not\n\nincluded in the statute, one relating to ventilation interruptions and one regarding\n\nunplanned connections into abandoned workings.          These two events, as noted by\n\nAppellees, were not included in the 2008 version of the Mine Safety Act and, according\n\nto Appellees, this omission indicates that the legislature did not intend the statute to\n\ninclude these circumstances as reportable accidents.\n\n       Appellees also offer that the General Assembly adopted the federal regulatory list\n\nof accident notifications, limited to the 14 enumerated events as prescribed by federal\n\nlaw. Appellees claim, because the state statute was patterned after the federal law, the\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 17\n\ftwo should be construed together. Construing the two statutes together, Appellees\n\npoint out that the only difference between the statutes is the prefatory language that an\n\naccident was an “unanticipated event, including any of the following.” According to\n\nAppellees, as noted above, this additional text does not change the meaning of the\n\nstatute, and that it is merely consistent with limiting the definition to events prescribed\n\nby federal law.\n\n       Finally, with respect to the requirement of fire extinguishers on scoops, Appellees\n\npoint out that, under Section 273(f) of the Mine Safety Act, operators are required to\n\nequip locomotives, self-propelled mantrip cars, and personnel carriers with one portable\n\nfire extinguisher.   Appellees offer that scoops, like numerous other self-propelled\n\nvehicles used in mining that are equipped with fire suppression systems, are excluded\n\nfrom this requirement; however, the DEP contends that they are “off-track locomotives”\n\nand, thus, required to carry fire extinguishers. According to Appellees, scoops are not\n\nlocomotives, as they are not merely engines used for pulling, but are equipped with a\n\nbucket for scooping material off the mine floor. Further, Appellees note that personnel\n\ncarriers and mantrips are used to move individuals in and out of the mines, but a scoop\n\nhas a single operator with no seats for passengers. Thus, Appellees argue that Section\n\n273(f) simply does not support the DEP’s position that a scoop must carry a fire\n\nextinguisher, and any attempts to require such equipment on that vehicle requires\n\nrulemaking. Finally, Appellees contend that the DEP is entitled to no deference in its\n\ninterpretation of the Mine Safety Act, as the language is clear that scoops are not the\n\ntype of vehicle required to carry portable fire extinguishers.      That being the case,\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 18\n\fAppellees assert that the unambiguous expressed intent of the legislature must be\n\ngiven effect.\n\n       With the arguments of the parties in hand, we turn to the jurisprudential principles\n\nunderlying our review. Specifically, the primary focus of the parties is on the terms of\n\nthe Mine Safety Act. Thus, we necessarily turn to the Statutory Construction Act. 1\n\nPa.C.S.A. §§ 1501 et seq. Pursuant to that Act, the objective of all interpretation and\n\nconstruction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General\n\nAssembly. Id. § 1921(a). The best indication of the legislature’s intent is the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute. When considering statutory language, “[w]ords and phrases\n\nshall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and\n\napproved usage.” Id. § 1903(a). Further, when the words of a statute are clear and\n\nunambiguous, there is no need to go beyond the plain meaning of the language of the\n\nstatute “under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” Id. § 1921(b). Thus, only when the\n\nwords of a statute are ambiguous should a reviewing court seek to ascertain the intent\n\nof the General Assembly through considerations of the various factors found in Section\n\n1921(c).

The Mine Safety Act empowers it to “administer a mine safety\n\nprogram for individuals employed at mines” and to “[i]ssue orders to implement and\n\nenforce the provisions of this act.”         52 P.S. § 690-105(a), (a)(3).   Traditionally,\n\nadministrative agencies enjoy wide latitude in implementing, interpreting, and enforcing\n\ntheir statutory mandate.        Moreover, pursuant to the Mine Safety Act, the DEP is\n\nexpressly charged with certain safety-related responsibilities and enjoys broad powers\n\nin fulfilling its mission in this regard.\n\n       Yet, we need not speak to the breadth of, or limitations on, this general authority\n\nto determine this matter. The parties do not dispute that administrative agencies have\n\nauthority to interpret their guiding statute and that they may enforce that enactment’s\n\nprovisions. Thus, we are able to resolve the issue of whether the DEP properly issued\n\nits orders regarding a failure to report certain accidents on the more narrow grounds of\n\nwhether the DEP properly interpreted the relevant statutory reporting language\n\ncontained in the Act.\n\n       To determine the General Assembly’s intent in this regard, we first look to the\n\nexpress statutory language in question. Pursuant to Section 109 of the Mine Safety Act,\n\nmine operators must notify the DEP of “accidents” that occur at their mines, within 15\n\nminutes of the discovery of the accident. 52 P.S. § 690-109(a)(1). Turning to the\n\ndefinition of “accident,” Section 104 describes an accident as an “unanticipated event,\n\nincluding any of the following . . . .” 52 P.S. § 690-104. Fourteen types of unanticipated\n\nevents follow this introductory phrase, as set forth above.\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-77A&B-2013] - 20\n\f       The focus of the precise controversy here centers upon the meaning of the\n\nphrases “unanticipated event” and “including any of the following.” In sum, the DEP\n\nclaims this language to be expansive, and includes not only the specifically expressed\n\nunintended events, but other unanticipated incidents outside of the list as well, while\n\nAppellees assert that the 14 unanticipated events are exhaustive — i.e., that they are\n\nthe only events which can constitute an “accident” for purposes of the DEP’s\n\nenforcement.\n\n       Initially, we note the definition of “accident” begins with the generic reference to\n\nan “unanticipated event.”    If the General Assembly had intended to limit reportable\n\n“accidents” to the 14 listed events, there would have been no need for the definition to\n\nfirst state that an “accident” is an “unanticipated event.” Indeed, all of the prefatory\n\nlanguage to the 14 examples would be surplusage under the Appellees’ interpretation of\n\nSection 104. Conversely, by employing the phrase “unanticipated event,” the legislature\n\nrendered the understanding of “accident” to be broad in scope and meaning.\n\n      Turning to the next phrase, it is widely accepted that general expressions such\n\nas “including,” or “including but not limited to,” that precede a specific list of included\n\nitems are to be considered as words of enlargement and not limitation.

In sum,\n\nthe presence of such a term as “including” in a definition exhibits a legislative intent that\n\nthe list that follows is not an exhaustive list of items that fall within the definition; yet, any\n\nadditional matters purportedly falling within the definition, but that are not express, must\n\nbe similar to those listed by the legislature and of the same general class or nature.\n\nFurther, contrary to Appellants’ assertions, we find that the term “any,” as used in the\n\nphrase “including any of the following” does not place a limitation on the definition, but,\n\nrather, sharpens the point that the list of 14 events is not exhaustive, but merely\n\nincluded as the type of events that may constitute an accident.\n\n       With these preliminary interpretations in mind, we turn to consideration of the 14\n\nmatters set forth in Section 104. These occurrences include unanticipated events such\n\nas death, serious injury, entrapment of an individual with reasonable potential for\n\nserious injury, inundation of a mine by liquid or gas, unplanned ignition or explosion of\n\ngas or dust, unplanned roof fall that impairs ventilation, an unstable condition requiring\n\nemergency action, and damage to hoisting equipment which endangers an individual or\n\ninterferes with the use of equipment for more than 30 minutes. As is clear from this list,\n\nthe unanticipated events contained in Section 104 all share the common thread of fairly\n\nserious unplanned incidents that potentially pose a serious risk to miners and other\n\nindividuals’ health, safety, or life. Thus, as the DEP has the power to interpret and\n\nenforce the Mine Safety Act, the DEP has the authority to issue administrative orders for\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-77A&B-2013] - 22\n\fa failure to report unanticipated events if they may be regarded as of the same general\n\nclass or nature as those expressly set forth in Section 104 — i.e., those involving fairly\n\nserious incidents potentially impacting the miner or other individual’s health, safety, or\n\nlife.\n\n        Thus, the question then becomes whether the unplanned changes in ventilation\n\nflow and a power failure resulting in an inoperable ventilation system are substantially\n\nsimilar and of the same general class as the expressly listed examples of an unplanned\n\nevent constituting an “accident.”        We believe these unanticipated circumstances\n\noccurring at the Emerald and Cumberland Mines fit comfortably in this class of events.\n\nAs noted by the EHB, Emerald did not dispute the DEP’s contention that the incident at\n\nits mine caused a potential threat to the health and safety of the miners. EHB Opinion,\n\n2/24/2010 at 2.       Indeed, at the Emerald Mine, the change in ventilation was\n\naccompanied by a methane detector being activated. Moreover, with respect to the\n\nCumberland Mine, the EHB explained “there is no dispute that the loss of ventilation\n\ncaused by the malfunctioning equipment posed a potential threat to the health and\n\nsafety of miners, not only directly as a result of the disruption in air flow, but indirectly as\n\na result of the need to commence an evacuation of numerous miners over long\n\ndistances on foot.” Id. at 3.\n\n        Because the accidents alleged by the DEP involving changes in, and cessation\n\nof, air flow to miners were of the same general class and similar to the unanticipated\n\nevents incidents listed in Section 104, we have no hesitation concluding that, based\n\nupon the plain language of Section 104, the DEP was within its authority to issue the\n\nadministrative orders regarding Appellees’ failure to report these unanticipated events.\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-77A&B-2013] - 23\n\fMoreover, our conclusion is made in the light of an administrative agency’s\n\ninterpretation of a governing statute enjoying controlling weight, as noted above, unless\n\nclearly erroneous.\n\n       Appellees’ protestations to the contrary are without merit. Specifically, Appellees’\n\nposition is that, by interpreting Section 104 to include events beyond those expressly\n\nlisted, the DEP engaged in rulemaking, and, if permitted, would make the Safety\n\nBoard’s rulemaking powers superfluous.         Appellees’ argument is overstated.        Our\n\nconclusion that the DEP properly has the authority to interpret and enforce the Mine\n\nSafety Act with respect to the reporting of accidents refutes Appellees’ contention that it\n\nengaged in unlawful rulemaking in contravention to the rulemaking functions of the\n\nSafety Board. The DEP’s interpretation of its governing statute and enforcement of a\n\nbroad statutory directive is not rulemaking. Moreover, while Section 106.1 of the Act\n\nvests the Safety Board with rulemaking powers, permitting the DEP to engage in\n\ntraditional interpretation and enforcement responsibilities, based upon statutory\n\nauthority, would not render the Safety Board’s rulemaking powers superfluous or\n\nredundant, as the Board could, consistent with its statutory powers, promulgate new\n\nrules or amend existing ones. Nor does it avoid or undermine the legislature’s construct\n\nfor rulemaking through the Safety Board. Indeed, every statute should be construed, if\n\npossible, to give effect to all of its provisions, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(a), and the legislature\n\nintends for the entire statute to be effective and certain, id. § 1922(2). Here, there is no\n\nindication that the General Assembly intended that enforcement of the Mine Safety Act\n\nwas solely dependent upon the Safety Board’s promulgation of regulations, and there is\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 24\n\fno evidence of a concomitant legislative intent to strip the DEP of its traditional\n\ninterpretive and enforcement powers. See Butler County; Norristown Area.\n\n      Our determination that both the DEP and the Safety Board are authorized to act\n\nto protect the health and safety of miners — through interpretation and enforcement,\n\nand by rulemaking, respectively — is consistent with these principles. The protection of\n\nminers under the Act may be through enforcement of reasonably interpreted statutory\n\nrequirements and through the formal promulgation of regulations, and both methods\n\nsupport the overarching and laudable purposes of the Mine Safety Act. Moreover, the\n\nauthority conferred upon each of these entities does not mean a diminution in the\n\npowers of the other. Thus, we reject Appellees’ assertion that the DEP’s actions are, in\n\nessence, preempted by the regulation promulgation powers of the Safety Board.\n\n      Further, Appellees contend federal mine safety regulation, through the federal\n\nMine Safety and Health Act, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New\n\nEmergency Response Act, is limited to the enumerated events and that our statute was\n\nbased upon that law.    Thus, we compare the federal mine safety statute with our\n\nCommonwealth’s Mine Safety Act.\n\n      The federal definition is limited, and offers that “accident means” one of 12 listed\n\nitems. 30 CFR § 50.2(h). By its express terms, Pennsylvania’s Mine Safety Act’s\n\ndefinition is clearly broader, including in the definition that the matter be an\n\n“unanticipated event,” and, more importantly, using the above-stated broadening\n\nverbiage, “including any of the following.” While Appellees claim that the Mine Safety\n\nAct is based upon the federal statute, and should be limited to the enumerated items\n\n\n\n\n                                 [J-77A&B-2013] - 25\n\fcontained therein, the express words of the Mine Safety Act command a different\n\nconclusion.5\n\n      Also, as noted above, Appellees offer somewhat cursory arguments that\n\nembracing the DEP’s interpretation of Section 104 would constitute an unconstitutional\n\ndelegation of legislative power and would render the statute unconstitutionally vague.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n      The legislature may not constitutionally delegate its power to make, alter, and\n\nrepeal laws to other branches of government or to any other body or authority. It may,\n\nhowever, delegate authority and discretion in connection with the execution and\n\nadministration of its law, and it may establish primary guidelines and bestow upon\n\nothers the duty to carry out declared legislative policy in accordance with the general\n\nprovisions of the enabling legislation. The touchstone of such delegation is that it is for\n\nthe General Assembly to make basic policy choices. Pennsylvanians Against Gambling\n\nExpansion Fund v.

In\nthat matter, a pharmacist’s license was suspended for “grossly unprofessional conduct.”\n63 P.S. § 390-5(a)(9). Under the Pharmacy Act, “grossly unprofessional conduct”\nconsisted of 13 specific prohibitions. The statutory provision, unlike the section at issue\nin this appeal, was limited to certain specifically enumerated grounds, and did not\ninclude any broadening language. Our Court reasoned that the legislature specifically\nintended to define “grossly unprofessional conduct” by the 13 enumerated grounds,\nand, thus, the State Board of Pharmacy could not expand that definition in the absence\nof statute or rule. Cohen, 292 A.2d at 282-83.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 26\n\f          We find that the statutory language employed by the General Assembly explains\n\nin sufficient detail the type of unanticipated events which constitute reportable accidents\n\nunder the Mine Safety Act. It reflects not only basic policy choices, but a specifically\n\narticulated class of events which must be reported to the DEP.                Further, this\n\nunderstanding of the definition of “accident” is entirely consistent with the underlying\n\npurpose of the Mine Safety Act, which could not be clearer: “[t]o use the full extent of\n\nthe Commonwealth’s powers to protect the lives, health and safety of miners and others\n\nin and about underground bituminous coal mines.” 52 P.S. § 690-103(b)(1). Finally, the\n\nreasonable effect of the statute is to place mine operators on reasonable notice of the\n\ntypes of unanticipated events which constitute accidents, and which are reportable to\n\nthe DEP.        In sum, Section 104, and the DEP’s interpretation thereof, does not\n\nimpermissibly delegate to the DEP basic legislative policy choices regarding mine\n\nsafety.\n\n          Further, we find that our interpretation today does not, as Appellees have argued,\n\nrender the Mine Safety Act unconstitutionally vague.          Under a void-for-vagueness\n\nchallenge, a statute will be found unconstitutional only if the enactment is so vague that\n\npersons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to\n\nits application.

As noted above, all 14 examples are events which are fairly\n\nserious incidents potentially impacting the miner or other individual’s health, safety, or\n\nlife.   Contrary to Appellees’ assertion that mine operators will be left in a state of\n\nuncertainty, we find that these examples provide sufficient guidance and definiteness\n\nregarding the nature of unanticipated events that constitute reportable accidents such\n\nthat ordinary individuals are able to understand what conduct is required to be reported,\n\nand in our view, such statutory definition does not encourage arbitrary and\n\ndiscriminatory enforcement.     Commonwealth v. Davidson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1440983\"><a href=\"/opinion/1440983/com-v-davidson/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207 (Pa.\n\n2007). Moreover, as offered by Judge Pellegrini in his dissenting opinion below, if a\n\nbyproduct of this broader understanding of reportable accidents is the over-reporting of\n\nincidents in an abundance of caution, such effect will increase the safety of miners, an\n\noutcome consistent with the overall purpose of the Act. Cumberland Coal Resources,\n\n29 A.3d at 436 (Pellegrini, J. dissenting).\n\n        For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that the DEP acted within its statutory\n\nauthority when it issued the administrative orders regarding Appellees’ failure to report\n\nthe “accidents” at issue, as they were of the same general class or nature as those\n\nexpressly set forth in Section 104 — i.e., those involving fairly serious incidents\n\npotentially impacting miner’s or other individual’s health, safety, or life.    Thus, we\n\nreverse the order of the Commonwealth Court on this issue.\n\n        We next turn to the DEP’s sanctioning of Appellees for a failure to comply with\n\nSection 273 of the Mine Safety Act which requires a portable fire extinguisher for certain\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 28\n\fmining vehicles.    Specifically, Section 273 requires that each “track or off-track\n\nlocomotive, self-propelled mantrip car or personnel carrier shall be equipped with one\n\nportable fire extinguisher.” 52 P.S. § 690-273(f). The DEP considered the scoops at\n\nissue in this appeal to be “off-track locomotives,” requiring a portable fire extinguisher.\n\nAppellees, as noted above, refute this understanding and, instead, assert that a scoop,\n\nwhich has a shovel, is used to remove coal, and is driven by a single individual, is not a\n\nlocomotive, as a locomotive pushes or pulls cars and a scoop does not. As a scoop is\n\nnot a locomotive, Appellees assert that the DEP was without authority to require a\n\nportable fire extinguisher on such vehicles.\n\n      As with the prior issue on appeal, our initial focus in resolving this issue is on the\n\nlanguage employed by the legislature in the statute, in this instance, to determine if the\n\nDEP erred in applying the portable fire extinguisher requirement to scoops. We note\n\nthat Section 273 is specific, limited in scope, and lacks any broader “including” language\n\nfound in Section 104. The provision lists three particular pieces of mining transportation\n\nvehicles which require a portable fire extinguisher. Focusing on the term “locomotive,”\n\ndictionaries commonly provide that a locomotive is a “self-propelled engine, now usually\n\nelectric or diesel-powered, that pulls or pushes freight or passenger cars on railroad\n\ntracks.” American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Houghton Mifflin Morris\n\n766 (ed. Boston 1996). Conversely, a “scoop” is a battery-powered, four wheel vehicle\n\nwith a single operator seat that is equipped with a bucket and used in underground\n\nmines to transport tools, materials, and coal from one location to another in the mine; it\n\ndoes not pull or push anything. Scoops are used daily and travel throughout a mine.\n\nR.R. 98a. While, generally, scoops are equipped with fire suppression systems, the\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 29\n\fscoop battery, which is large and can accumulate coal dust, is not protected by a fire\n\nsuppression system. Id. We also note that the other vehicles listed — a mantrip car\n\nand personnel carriers — just as the terms connote, are vehicles used for shuttling and\n\ncarrying miners, and scoops are neither used to transport miners nor pull cars of\n\nsupplies or coal.\n\n       By its plain and narrow language, the statutory portable fire extinguisher\n\nrequirement is limited to three statutorily enumerated types of vehicles, none of which\n\nspecifically include, or could reasonably be understood to include, a scoop or scoop-like\n\nvehicle. A scoop does not pull or push freight or passenger cars. Nor does a scoop\n\nmove individuals in and out of a mine, like a mantrip car or personnel carrier, as a scoop\n\nhas a single operator seat with no room for passengers. Indeed, consistent with our\n\ndiscussion above regarding the definition of “accident,” if a scoop were substantially\n\nsimilar to these vehicles, or in the same general class, the DEP’s interpretation may\n\nhave more validity; but to interpret the definition of “locomotive” to include a scoop\n\nwould be to stretch the plain meaning of the term used by the General Assembly\n\nbeyond the breaking point. Consistent with the limited statutory language delineating\n\nthe specific types of vehicles encompassed by this statutory provision, we find that\n\nscoops fall outside of the requirements of Section 273.          While an administrative\n\nagency’s interpretation of a governing statute is to be given controlling weight, there are\n\nlimitations, and here, based upon the plain language of the statute, the DEP’s\n\ninterpretation of Section 273 was clearly erroneous. Whitaker Borough, supra.\n\n       The DEP hinted as much in its argument before the Commonwealth Court,\n\nwherein it took the position that a scoop was a locomotive, but nevertheless suggested\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-77A&B-2013] - 30\n\fthat, even if not a locomotive, because mandating fire extinguishers is safety related, it\n\nwas a permissible exercise of its authority. The DEP points to Section 501 of the Act\n\nwhich permits the DEP to “effectuate the purposes of this act and to protect the health\n\nand safety of miners and individuals in and about mines.”            52 P.S. § 690-501.\n\nAccording to the DEP, this section, pertaining to enforcement powers and remedies,\n\nexpands upon the already broad powers enjoyed by the DEP and allows it to issue\n\norders to mine operators to perform actions not contemplated by statute or regulation\n\nfor the purpose of promoting miner safety. We do not doubt that the DEP enjoys broad\n\npowers to carry out the laudable and essential purposes of the Mine Safety Act, and,\n\nmore specifically, that requiring a portable fire extinguisher to be carried by scoops may\n\nbe exceedingly prudent; however, the DEP’s suggestion that, simply because it is safety\n\nrelated, it can require fire extinguishers on all vehicles, even if they are not statutorily\n\nrequired, would be to arrogate a power without a statutory basis, make it virtually\n\nimpossible for a mine operator to reasonably understand what was required of it so as\n\nto comply with the law, and to raise the specter of constitutional infirmity on the basis of\n\nvagueness.\n\n       Thus, we find that the DEP acted outside of its statutory authority when it\n\nincluded a scoop in the limited vehicular category of locomotive, mantrip car, or\n\npersonnel carrier, which require a portable fire extinguisher, and, therefore, we affirm\n\nthe Commonwealth Court’s order with respect to this issue.\n\n       For all of the above-stated reasons, we hold that (1) the DEP acted within its\n\nstatutory authority when it issued the administrative orders to Appellees for their failure\n\nto report the “accidents” at issue in this appeal, under 52 P.S. § 690-104; but (2) the\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 31\n\fDEP acted outside its authority when it required scoops to be equipped with a portable\n\nfire extinguisher under 52 P.S. § 690-273(f). Thus, we reverse in part, and affirm in\n\npart, the order of the Commonwealth Court.\n\n      Jurisdiction relinquished.\n\n      Mr. Chief Justice Castille and Messrs. Justice Eakin, Baer, McCaffery and\n\nStevens join the opinion.\n\n      Mr. Justice Saylor files a concurring opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-77A&B-2013] - 32\n\f</pre>",
