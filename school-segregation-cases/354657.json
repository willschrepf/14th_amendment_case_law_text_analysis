Koffman, Judge\n\n     Opinion issued April 15, 2014, and modified on Court’s own motion May 27, 2014\n\n         John Templemire (hereinafter, “Templemire”) appeals from a jury verdict entered\n\nin favor of W & M Welding, Inc. (hereinafter, “Employer”) on Templemire’s claim of\n\nretaliatory discharge in violation of section 287.780, RSMo 2000, 1 after Templemire\n\nsought workers’ compensation benefits and was discharged from his employment.\n\nTemplemire raises two claims of instructional error regarding: (1) the proper causation\n\nstandard an employee must demonstrate to make a prima facie case for retaliatory\n\ndischarge under this statute and (2) whether an employee is entitled to submit an\n\ninstruction regarding an employer’s alleged pretextual motive for the employee’s\n\ndischarge.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    All statutory references are to RSMo 2000 unless otherwise indicated.\n\f       This Court holds that to make a submissible case for retaliatory discharge under\n\nsection 287.780, an employee must demonstrate his or her filing of a workers’\n\ncompensation claim was a “contributing factor” to the employer’s discrimination or the\n\nemployee’s discharge.      To the extent the decisions in Hansome v. Northwestern\n\nCooperage Co., 679 S.W.2d 273 (Mo. banc 1984), and Crabtree v. Bugby, 967 S.W.2d\n\n66 (Mo. banc 1998), are inconsistent with this decision, they are overruled. This Court\n\nneed not reach Templemire’s alternative claim of instructional error regarding pretext.\n\nThe circuit court’s judgment is reversed, the case is remanded. 2\n\n                              Factual and Procedural History\n\n       Employer hired Templemire in October 2005 to work as a painter and general\n\nlaborer whose job duties included driving trucks and washing parts in the wash bay. On\n\nJanuary 9, 2006, Templemire was injured in the course and scope of his employment\n\nwhen a large metal beam fell from a forklift and crushed his left foot. Templemire’s\n\ninjury required surgery and the installation of plating and screws into his foot.\n\nTemplemire reported the injury to Employer and filed a workers’ compensation claim for\n\nwhich he received benefits.\n\n       Approximately three to four weeks following his injury, Templemire was cleared\n\nto return to work with certain restrictions.      Templemire was instructed to wear a\n\nprotective boot on his injured foot while at work and was prohibited from climbing\n\n\n2\n  This Court transferred this case after an opinion by the Missouri Court of Appeals,\nWestern District. Portions of the court of appeals opinion are incorporated without\nfurther attribution.\n\fladders. The following month, Templemire’s physician added a restriction preventing\n\nTemplemire from driving a vehicle with a clutch. In July 2006, Templemire’s physician\n\nordered that he only perform seated work due to continuing complications from his\n\ninjury. In September 2006, the seated restriction was lifted, but Templemire’s physician\n\nimplemented new restrictions, which included restraining him from climbing stairs,\n\npushing, pulling, and standing longer than one hour without a fifteen-minute break.\n\n      As a result of these restrictions, Employer placed Templemire on “light duty”\n\nwhen he returned to work even though light duty work was not available when\n\nTemplemire returned. Employer’s owner, Gary McMullin (hereinafter, “McMullin”),\n\naccommodated the restrictions and created a light duty work assignment for Templemire\n\nby assigning him to be a tool room assistant to Nick Twenter (hereinafter, “Twenter”).\n\n      On November 29, 2006, Templemire remained on light duty. McMullin received\n\na request from a customer to have a railing washed and painted for pick up later that\n\nafternoon. Templemire testified that when he arrived at work that morning, he did not\n\nspeak to McMullin. Instead, Twenter informed Templemire that he would need to wash\n\nthe railing, but that it was not ready. Twenter then assigned him to complete other tasks\n\nwhile the railing was prepared for washing. Templemire completed these tasks and\n\nreturned to the job site. Around 1:50 p.m., Templemire went toward the wash bay to\n\nwash the railing. Before reaching the wash bay, Templemire stopped to rest his foot,\n\nwhich was infected.\n\n      During this break, McMullin confronted Templemire and cursed at him because\n\nthe railing had not been washed. Templemire tried to explain the railing had just arrived\n\n\n                                            3\n\fin the wash bay, and he intended to wash the railing as soon as his break was over. After\n\ncontinuing to curse at Templemire, McMullin discharged Templemire effective\n\nimmediately. Templemire asked McMullin if he was sure he wanted to fire him “because\n\n[he] was going to go home and call workman’s [sic] comp?” to which McMullin replied,\n\n“I don’t give a f--- what you do, this is my f---ing place.”\n\n       After being terminated, Templemire contacted Liz Gragg (hereinafter, “Gragg”),\n\nthe insurance adjuster on his workers’ compensation claim.           Gragg subsequently\n\ncontacted McMullin to discuss Templemire’s discharge.           Gragg’s notes from her\n\nconversation with McMullin reflected that, after Gragg indicated Templemire had work\n\nrestrictions that required him to take a break, McMullin “went on a [tirade] about\n\n[Templemire] ‘milking’ his injury and that he can sue him for whatever reason that is\n\nwhat he pays his premiums for and the [attorneys].”\n\n       Templemire subsequently filed suit against Employer pursuant to section 287.780\n\nalleging he was discharged in retaliation for filing a workers’ compensation claim. At the\n\ntrial, McMullin characterized Templemire as a “high maintenance employee” and\n\ndisputed Templemire’s account of what transpired between them. McMullin testified he\n\nplaced the railing in the wash bay early in the morning. McMullin directed Templemire\n\nto wash the railing immediately and to disregard any other assignments from Twenter or\n\nanyone else until the washing was complete.              McMullin returned to check on\n\nTemplemire’s progress two hours later and found the railing unwashed and Templemire\n\ntaking a break. McMullin testified that Templemire told him that he needed a break for\n\nhis foot and if McMullin did not like it, he could take it up with Templemire’s physician.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fMcMullin advised Templemire that he did not work for Templemire’s physician and\n\ndischarged Templemire for insubordination.\n\n         Templemire presented evidence that McMullin yelled at him due to this injury and\n\nreferred to other workers who had been injured as “whiners.” Templemire also offered\n\ntestimony from former employees who were belittled as a result of their injuries and who\n\ndid not receive work accommodations. One witness testified he was discharged shortly\n\nafter filing a workers’ compensation claim. Another witness testified that he overheard\n\nMcMullin yell at Templemire, “[a]ll you do is sit on your a-- and draw my money”\n\nduring the argument that resulted in Templemire’s discharge. Templemire’s immediate\n\ndischarge was contrary to Employer’s progressive discipline policy, which was submitted\n\ninto evidence. Templemire presented evidence about another employee who received\n\nmultiple disciplinary write-ups and had a drug problem but had not been discharged. By\n\ncontrast, after returning to work, Templemire received his only disciplinary write-up for\n\nfailing to wear a paint mask while in the paint booth. Despite this one issue, Templemire\n\nwas regarded as a good employee who performed his tasks efficiently.\n\n         During the jury instruction conference, Templemire argued MAI-23.13, 3 the\n\napplicable MAI-approved verdict director, misstated the law insofar as it required a\n\nfinding that Templemire’s filing of a workers’ compensation claim was the exclusive\n\nfactor in Employer’s decision to terminate him to prevail on his claim. Templemire\n\noffered an alternative instruction stating the jury could find in his favor if the filing of the\n\nworkers’ compensation claim was a contributing factor to Employer’s decision to\n\n3\n    MAI 23.13 has been replaced with MAI 38.04.\n\n                                               5\n\fdischarge him. 4    Alternatively, Templemire submitted a pretext instruction, which\n\nadvised the jury that it could find exclusive causation if it found that Employer’s stated\n\nreason for his discharge was a mere pretext, rather than the true reason stated. 5 The\n\ncircuit court refused both of Templemire’s instructions and advised the jury it had to find\n\nthe filing of a workers’ compensation claim was the exclusive factor considered by\n\nEmployer when it terminated Templemire for him to prevail on his claim. The jury\n\nreturned a verdict in Employer’s favor. After an opinion by the court of appeals, this\n\nCourt granted transfer. 6 Mo. Const. art. V, sec. 10.\n\n                                   Standard of Review\n\n       Whether a jury was instructed properly is a question of law that this Court reviews\n\nde novo. Edgerton v. Morrison, 280 S.W.3d 62, 65 (Mo. banc 2009). “Instructional\n\nerrors are reversed only if the error resulted in prejudice that materially affects the merits\n\n\n4\n   Templemire’s rejected verdict director stated: “On the claim of plaintiff for\ncompensatory damages for retaliatory discharge against defendant, your verdict must be\nfor plaintiff if you believe:\n       First, plaintiff was employed by defendant, and\n       Second, plaintiff filed a workers’ compensation claim, and\n       Third, defendant discharged plaintiff, and\n       Fourth, plaintiff’s filing of the workers’ compensation claim was a contributing\n       factor in such discharge, and\n       Fifth, as a direct result of such discharge plaintiff sustained damage.”\n5\n   Templemire’s rejected pretext instruction stated: “You may find that plaintiff\nexercising his workers’ compensation rights was the exclusive cause of defendant’s\ndecision to discharge plaintiff if the defendant’s stated reason for its decision are not the\ntrue reasons, but are a pretext to hide retaliation against plaintiff for exercising his\nworkers’ compensation rights.”\n6\n  The Missouri Association of Trial Attorneys and The St. Louis and Kansas City\nchapters of the National Employment Lawyers Association filed amicus briefs in support\nof Templemire. The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry and The Missouri\nOrganization of Defense Lawyers filed amicus briefs in support of Employer.\n\n                                              6\n\fof the action.” Bach v. Winfield-Foley Fire Protection Dist., 257 S.W.3d 605, 608 (Mo.\n\nbanc 2008).\n\n      Generally, “[w]henever Missouri Approved Instructions contains an instruction\n\napplicable to the facts of a case, such instruction shall be given to the exclusion of any\n\nother instructions on the same subject.” Rule 70.02(b). Rule 70.02 further provides that\n\ndeparture from an applicable MAI constitutes error, with its prejudicial effect to be\n\ndetermined judicially. Rule 70.02(b)-(c). If, however, a particular MAI does not state\n\nthe substantive law accurately, it should not be given. State v. Celis-Garcia, 344 S.W.3d\n\n150, 158 (Mo. banc 2011).\n\n                         Section 287.780 Causation Standard\n\n      Templemire argues the circuit court erred in refusing his verdict director that\n\nmodified the applicable MAI by substituting “contributing factor” for the “exclusive\n\ncause” language. Templemire claims that submitting the MAI as written misstates the\n\nlaw. Templemire asserts the MAI’s use of the phrase “exclusive cause” is contrary to the\n\nplain language of section 287.780 and this Court’s recent decisions construing the\n\nMissouri Human Rights Act (“the MHRA”) and public policy wrongful termination\n\nclaims, which both hold liability attaches if the employer’s prohibited motive was a\n\n“contributing factor” in the employee’s subsequent discharge.\n\n      Generally, an employer can discharge an at-will employee for any reason.\n\nKeveney v. Missouri Military Acad., 304 S.W.3d 98, 101 (Mo. banc 2010). There are\n\nexceptions and limits, however, to the at-will employment doctrine. For example, an\n\nemployer cannot terminate an at-will employee for being a member of a protected class\n\n\n                                            7\n\fbased on “race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry, age or disability.” Fleshner\n\nv. Pepose Vision Institute, P.C., 304 S.W.3d 81, 92 (Mo. banc 2010) (quoting section\n\n213.055 of the MHRA). Additionally, this Court has adopted the following public policy\n\nexception to the at-will employment doctrine:\n\n        An at-will employee may not be terminated (1) for refusing to violate the\n        law or any well-established and clear mandate of public policy as expressed\n        in the constitution, statutes, regulations promulgated pursuant to statute, or\n        rules created by a governmental body or (2) for reporting wrongdoing or\n        violations of law to superiors or public authorities…. If an employer\n        terminates an employee for either reason, then the employee has a cause of\n        action in tort for wrongful discharge based on the public-policy exception.\n\nId. at 92. 7\n\nSection 287.780’s Historic Construction\n\n        Section 287.780 is a statutory exception to the at-will employment doctrine and\n\nprovides: “No employer or agent shall discharge or in any way discriminate against any\n\nemployee for exercising any of his [or her] rights under this chapter. Any employee who\n\nhas been discharged or discriminated against shall have a civil action for damages against\n\nhis [or her] employer.” This section was enacted in 1925 as a part of the original\n\nMissouri workers’ compensation law. Christy v. Petrus, 365 Mo. 1187, 295 S.W.2d 122,\n\n124 (Mo. 1956). At the time of enactment, the workers’ compensation law was construed\n\nliberally in favor of the worker and the award of benefits. Maltz v. Jackoway-Katz Cap\n\n\n\n7\n  The legislature has provided statutory protection against discrimination or discharge for\nother whistle-blowing activities as well. See section 191.908.1 (protection for reporting\nMedicaid fraud); section 162.068.1 (protection for school employees who report sexual\nmisconduct committed by teachers and other school employees); and section 84.342.1\n(protection for municipal police officers).\n\n                                              8\n\fCo., 336 Mo. 1000, 82 S.W.2d 909, 911 (Mo. 1934). Section 287.780 was amended in\n\n1973 to provide employees with the private right of action that remains today.\n\n       The first case to address the statute after the legislature provided employees with a\n\nprivate cause of action was Mitchell v. St. Louis County, 575 S.W.2d 813 (Mo. App. E.D.\n\n1978). In Mitchell, the plaintiff alleged her discharge was discriminatory because it\n\noccurred six months after she filed a workers’ compensation claim for a back injury. Id.\n\nat 814. The court affirmed the circuit court’s entry of a directed verdict in the employer’s\n\nfavor after the employer demonstrated the plaintiff was discharged due to excessive\n\nabsenteeism unrelated to the injury. Id. The court stated, “It is palpable that a cause of\n\naction lies only if an employee is discharged discriminatorily by reason of exercising his\n\nor her rights” under the workers’ compensation law. Id. at 815. Here, the employer\n\npresented evidence of a valid and nonpretextual motive to discharge the plaintiff. Id.\n\n       A plaintiff’s need to demonstrate a causal connection between his or her exercise\n\nof workers’ compensation rights and the subsequent discharge was discussed in Davis v.\n\nRichmond Special Road Dist., 649 S.W.2d 252 (Mo. App. W.D. 1983). The court\n\nexplained:\n\n       By its wording, section 287.780 is, to the extent of authorizing recovery of\n       damages by a civil action, penal in nature. The statute predicates recovery\n       upon the discharge or discrimination of an employee for the exercise of his\n       or her workers’ compensation rights. By its wording, the statute does not\n       convey an intent that mere discharge of an employee gives rise to a claim\n       against the employer. On the other hand, the statute reveals a legislative\n       intent that there must be a causal relationship between the exercise of the\n       right by the employee and his discharge by his employer arising precisely\n       from the employee’s exercise of his rights, and upon proof, that the\n       discharge was related to the employee’s exercise of his or her rights. In its\n       enactment of section 287.780, the General Assembly did not prohibit\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       (although it could have) the discharge of employees merely during the\n       pendency of a claim for workers’ compensation. On the other hand, the\n       General Assembly, by its wording of section 287.780, enacted a prohibition\n       against employers (to the extent they might be liable for damages in a\n       separate civil proceeding) not to discriminate or discharge employees\n       because of the employee’s exercise of his or her rights relative to a\n       workers’ compensation claim. Stated another way, the legislative intent\n       conveyed by the statute is to authorize recovery for damages if, upon proof,\n       it be shown that the employee was discriminated against or discharged\n       simply because of the exercise of his or her rights regarding a workers’\n       compensation claim.\n\nId. at 255. (Emphasis added).\n\n       For the first time in Hansome v. Northwestern Cooperage Co., this Court set forth\n\nthe elements a plaintiff must demonstrate to make a submissible case for a claim brought\n\npursuant to section 287.780: “(1) plaintiff’s status as employee of defendant before\n\ninjury, (2) plaintiff’s exercise of a right granted by Chapter 287, (3) employer’s discharge\n\nof or discrimination against plaintiff, and (4) an exclusive causal relationship between\n\nplaintiff’s actions and defendant’s actions.” Hansome, 679 S.W.2d at 275. (Emphasis\n\nadded). This Court did not analyze or interpret the wording of section 287.780; rather, it\n\ncited Mitchell and Davis as support for its declaration that the exclusive causation\n\nstandard was appropriate for this cause of action.            This Court further explained,\n\n“Causality does not exist if the basis for discharge is valid and nonpretextual.” Id. at 277,\n\nn.2.\n\n       This Court reaffirmed the holding in Hansome in Crabtree v. Bugby. In Crabtree,\n\nthe employer challenged the verdict director submitted by the discharged employee that\n\ndirected the jury to return a verdict in her favor if it found “as a direct result of plaintiff’s\n\nfiling of a claim for [workers’] compensation, defendant discharged plaintiff.” Crabtree,\n\n\n                                               10\n\f967 S.W.2d at 71. (Emphasis added). This Court found the instruction was erroneous\n\nbecause it permitted the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff even though the reasons\n\nfor her discharge included causes other than filing a workers’ compensation claim. Id.\n\nThis Court held the jury should have been instructed that it had to find the exclusive\n\ncause of the plaintiff’s discharge was the filing of her claim as articulated in Hansome.\n\nId. This Court explained:\n\n       Once this Court by case law has resolved the elements of a cause of action\n       pursuant to section 287.780, neither the trial court nor the court of appeals\n       is free to redefine the elements in every case that comes before them. Mo.\n       Const. art. V, sec. 2. Similarly, this Court should not lightly disturb its own\n       precedent. Mere disagreement by the current Court with the statutory\n       analysis of a predecessor Court is not a satisfactory basis for violating the\n       doctrine of stare decisis, at least in the absence of a recurring injustice or\n       absurd results. 8\n\nId. at 71-72.\n\n       The disagreement regarding the statutory analysis was set forth in the dissenting\n\nopinion in Crabtree. The dissent stated section 287.780 did not contain any language\n\nsuggesting that an employee is entitled to relief only when he or she has been discharged\n\n\n8\n  Echoing this concern in Crabtree, the dissenting opinion likewise asserts the reason this\nCourt has overruled Hansome and Crabtree is due solely to a change of heart by the\nchanged membership of the Court, not based upon a legal need. Undoubtedly, the\nmembership of this Court, as well as that of the legislature, has changed dramatically\nsince Hansome was decided in 1984 and Crabtree in 1998. However, today’s decision\nstems from this Court’s duty to address an appellant’s properly raised challenge\nrequesting reexamination of this Court’s precedent in light of the current legal landscape.\nMoreover, reexamination is warranted given the legislature’s expansive enactment of a\nnumber of statutes that protect Missouri’s citizens from discrimination, most notably\npassage of the MHRA. Given the legislature’s demonstrated intent that discrimination,\nbased on any number of factors, will not be tolerated in the workplace, it is appropriate\nfor this Court to reevaluate the accuracy of the exclusive causation standard.\n\n\n                                             11\n\f“solely” or “exclusively” because the employee sought the protection afforded by\n\nworkers’ compensation.      Id. at 73.   The dissent also characterized the holding in\n\nHansome as “an aberration” in which the “exclusive” language “appears to be plucked\n\nout of thin air” because neither Mitchell nor Davis used the word “exclusive” to describe\n\nthe causation standard. Id. at 74.\n\n       Hansome and its progeny remained unquestioned until this Court’s recent decision\n\nin Fleshner v. Pepose Vision Institute, P.C.. In Fleshner, this Court explicitly recognized\n\nfor the first time the public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine.\n\nFleshner, 304 S.W.3d at 92. The defendant in Fleshner modeled its jury instruction after\n\nthe MAI-approved instruction that relied on the Hansome factors to prove a claim of\n\nretaliatory discharge and used the exclusive cause language. This Court noted, “Nowhere\n\nin the workers’ compensation laws does ‘exclusive causal’ or ‘exclusive causation’\n\nlanguage appear.” Id. The Court acknowledged there was a key distinction between\n\nworkers’ compensation retaliation cases and public policy exception cases, in that the\n\nformer arises under the statute, while the latter arises under the common law. Id. at 93.\n\nFleshner found the exclusive causation standard was “inconsistent with the proximate\n\ncause standard typically employed in tort cases.”      Id.   Moreover, this Court found\n\napplication of the exclusive causation standard would discourage employees from\n\nreporting their employers’ violations of the law or for refusing to violate the law. Id. In\n\nother words, application of the exclusive causation standard “would result in an exception\n\nthat fails to accomplish its task of protecting employees who refuse to violate the law or\n\npublic policy.” Id.\n\n\n                                            12\n\fStare Decisis\n\n         Templemire acknowledges the applicable holdings in Hansome and Crabtree but\n\nurges this Court to reexamine those cases in light of this Court’s recent criticisms in\n\nFleshner. Templemire argues Hansome and Crabtree should be reversed or modified\n\nbecause they erroneously analyzed section 287.780 and the appropriate causation\n\nstandard from its inception. Employer and its amici argue that this Court should adhere\n\nto the principles of stare decisis and continue to follow the precedent set by Hansome and\n\nCrabtree.\n\n         “The doctrine of stare decisis promotes security in the law by encouraging\n\nadherence to previously decided cases.” Independence-Nat. Educ. Ass’n v. Independence\n\nSch. Dist., 223 S.W.3d 131, 137 (Mo. banc 2007). “But, the adherence to precedent is\n\nnot absolute, and the passage of time and the experience of enforcing a purportedly\n\nincorrect precedent may demonstrate a compelling case for changing course.” Watts v.\n\nLester E. Cox Medical Centers, 376 S.W.3d 633, 644 (Mo. banc 2012) (quoting Med.\n\nShoppe Intern., Inc. v. Dir. of Revenue, 156 S.W.3d 333, 335 (Mo. banc 2005)).\n\n“[W]here it appears that an opinion is clearly erroneous and manifestly wrong, the rule\n\n[of] stare decisis is never applied to prevent the repudiation of such a decision.”\n\nSouthwestern Bell Yellow Pages, Inc. v. Dir. of Revenue, 94 S.W.3d 388, 390-91 (Mo.\n\nbanc 2002) (quoting Novak v. Kansas City Transit, Inc., 365 S.W.2d 539, 546 (Mo. banc\n\n1963).\n\n         Here, adherence to stare decisis is ill-advised when one carefully examines this\n\nCourt’s sua sponte creation of the exclusive causation standard articulated in Hansome.\n\n\n                                            13\n\fHansome’s reliance on Mitchell and Davis to support an exclusive causation standard is\n\nunfounded.     Neither Mitchell nor Davis contains any reference whatsoever to a\n\nheightened or exclusive causation standard for a plaintiff to prevail on a claim for\n\nretaliatory discharge under the workers’ compensation law. Mitchell did not address\n\ncausation explicitly, while Davis recognized causation was an element of the claim but\n\ndid not allude to an “exclusive causation” standard by any means.              The dissent in\n\nCrabtree aptly described the holding in Hansome as “an aberration” in which the\n\n“exclusive” language “appears to be plucked out of thin air” with no support in the\n\ncaselaw or statutory interpretation. As the learned jurist Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes\n\nJr. admonished, “It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it\n\nwas laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon\n\nwhich it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind\n\nimitation of the past.” Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev.\n\n457, 469 (1897).9 Thus, the holdings in Hansome and Crabtree are clearly erroneous and\n\nstare decisis should not be applied to prevent their repudiation. 10\n\n\n9\n   The dissenting opinion cites another learned jurist, Justice Louis Brandeis, for the\nproposition that “it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it\nbe settled right.” Staunch adherence to stare decisis based solely on this notion would\nresult in a society in which insidious discrimination still would subject school children to\nbeing segregated into schools that were purportedly separate but equal, women could not\nserve on juries, interracial marriage still would be subject to criminal prosecution, and\ncrime victims would be prohibited from offering impact testimony during the punishment\nphase of death penalty trials.\n10\n   The dissenting opinion accuses this Court of failing to acknowledge that the common\nlaw is the exclusive prerogative of the judiciary, for which this Court is the ultimate\nauthority, and that stare decisis is at its strongest in cases of statutory interpretation. This\nCourt did not employ the tenets of statutory construction when it articulated the exclusive\n\n                                              14\n\fLegislative Inaction\n\n       Employer and its amici assert the legislature had ample opportunity to correct any\n\nmisstatement by this Court of the exclusive causation standard and chose not to do so,\n\nparticularly when it substantially revised the workers’ compensation laws in 2005.11\n\nTemplemire argues that legislative inaction is not a factor that trumps other rules of\n\nstatutory construction, and that section 287.780 has been construed improperly since\n\nHansome.\n\n       If this Court rejects a litigant’s pleas to overrule existing caselaw, a party can seek\n\nredress with the legislature to implore it to change an incorrect or otherwise undesirable\n\ninterpretation of a statute. Med. Shoppe, 156 S.W.3d at 334. This Court explained the\n\nfallacy of relying upon legislative inaction as tacit approval of an interpretation of a\n\nstatute:\n\n       The General Assembly’s inaction has sometimes been interpreted to be\n       approval of the Court’s reading of a statute. Legislative inaction, however,\n\ncausation standard in Hansome or when it reaffirmed the standard in Crabtree. Rather,\nHansome merely turned to common law causation principles to fill the causation void in\nan otherwise silent statute. In doing so, this Court misconstrued the holdings in Mitchell\nand Davis, which the dissent does not contest. Only now is this Court examining the\nplain meaning of the statute to determine legislative intent to discern the appropriate\ncausation standard.\n11\n   The dissenting opinion asserts that today’s decision encroaches on the legislature’s\nimplicit adoption of the exclusive causation standard given the extensive amendments to\nthe workers’ compensation statutes in 2005 and fears this decision will invite the\nlegislature to do away with the private right of action altogether. The dissent’s fear is\nspeculative at best given the legislature’s enactment of a number of statutes that protect\ncitizens from discrimination since Hansome was decided. It was this Court’s misguided\nproclamation of the exclusive causation standard in Hansome that effectively eviscerated\nthe legislature’s plain intent to prohibit employers from discriminating “in any way”\nagainst an employee who exercised his or her workers’ compensation rights.\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       can just as well mean that the forces arrayed in favor of changing the law\n       are matched by the forces against changing it. In truth, the match does not\n       have to be an even one, for the legislative process in our republican form of\n       government is designed more to prevent the passage of legislation than to\n       encourage it. An incorrect judicial interpretation of a statute may also stand\n       simply because the legislature has paid no attention to it. Thus, it is\n       speculative to infer legislative approval from legislative inaction.\n\nId. at 334-35.\n\n       “Workers’ compensation law is entirely a creature of statute, and when\n\ninterpreting the law the court must ascertain the intent of the legislature by considering\n\nthe plain and ordinary meaning of the terms and give effect to that intent if possible.”\n\nHayes v. Show Me Believers, Inc., 192 S.W.3d 706, 707 (Mo. banc 2006) (quoting\n\nGreenlee v. Dukes Plastering Service, 75 S.W.3d 273, 276 (Mo. banc 2002)). “Insight\n\ninto the legislature’s object can be gained by identifying the problems sought to be\n\nremedied and the circumstances and conditions existing at the time of the enactment.”\n\nBachtel v. Miller County Nursing Home Dist., 110 S.W.3d 799, 801 (Mo. banc 2003).\n\n       The plain language of section 287.780 prohibits an employer from discharging or\n\nin any way discriminating against an employee for exercising his or her workers’\n\ncompensation rights. At the time section 287.780 was enacted and when this Court\n\ndecided Hansome, workers’ compensation laws were to be construed liberally. This\n\nCourt’s imposition of the exclusive causation standard ran afoul of this statutory\n\nimperative. Even if this Court strictly construed the statute as it must do pursuant to\n\nsection 287.800, “[a] strict construction of a statute presumes nothing that is not\n\nexpressed.” Robinson v. Hooker, 323 S.W.3d 418, 423 (Mo. App. W.D. 2010). “The\n\noperation of the statute must be confined to ‘matters affirmatively pointed out by its\n\n\n                                            16\n\fterms, and to cases which fall fairly within its letter.’” Id. (quoting Allcorn v. Tap\n\nEnters., Inc., 277 S.W.3d 823, 828 (Mo. App. S.D. 2009)).              Undisputedly, section\n\n287.780 does not contain the word “exclusively” or “solely” or “only” to support the\n\nexclusive causation standard articulated in Hansome. 12 Further, the legislative dictate is\n\nclear that it is inappropriate for an employer to give any consideration to the fact that an\n\nemployee filed a workers’ compensation claim when making employment decisions.\n\n       Moreover, in Reed v. Sale Memorial Hosp. and Clinic, 698 S.W.2d 931, 935 (Mo.\n\nApp. S.D. 1985), the court explained that section 287.780 is an exception to Missouri’s\n\nemployment at-will doctrine and that the statute declared “public policy” by addressing\n\n“the evil to be remedied,” which was “want of an effective remedy for retaliatory\n\ndischarge arising out of the exercise of rights” under the workers’ compensation law. Id.\n\nAs it stands today, an employer’s discrimination against or discharge of an employee who\n\n12\n   Compare, Ala. Code § 25-5-11.1 (“No employee shall be terminated by an employer\nsolely because the employee has instituted or maintained any action against the employer\nto recover workers’ compensation benefits ….”); Haw. Rev. Stat. § 386-142 (“It shall be\nunlawful for any employer to suspend or discharge any employee solely because the\nemployee suffers any work injury which is compensable under this chapter and which\narises out of and in the course of employment with the employer unless it is shown to the\nsatisfaction of the director that the employee will no longer be capable of performing the\nemployee’s work as a result of the work injury and that employer has no other available\nwork which the employee is capable of performing.”); Md. Code Labor & Emply, § 9-\n1105 (“An employer may not discharge a covered employee from employment solely\nbecause the covered employee files a claim for [workers’] compensation ….”); N.M. Stat.\nAnn. § 52-1-28.2A (“An employer shall not discharge, threaten to discharge or otherwise\nretaliate in the terms or conditions of employment against a worker who seeks workers’\ncompensation benefits for the sole reason that that employee seeks workers’\ncompensation benefits.”); and Va. Code Ann. § 65.2-308A (“No employer or person shall\ndischarge an employee solely because the employee intends to file or has filed a claim\nunder this title or has testified or is about to testify in any proceeding under this title.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\fexercises his or her rights under section 287.780 is acceptable so long as it is not the\n\nexclusive cause of the employer’s action. Thus, the imposition of an exclusive causation\n\nstandard effectively deprives an employee’s right to remedy the evil of being\n\ndiscriminated against or discharged for exercising workers’ compensation rights.\n\n       Hence, the reasoning in Hansome, and the cases it relied on, is flawed. Therefore,\n\nto the extent Hansome, Crabtree, and their progeny require a plaintiff to demonstrate his\n\nor her exercise of workers’ compensation rights was the exclusive cause of his or her\n\ndischarge or discrimination, they no longer should be followed.\n\nAppropriate Causation Standard\n\n       Because the exclusive causation standard is unsupported by the plain language of\n\nsection 287.780 and the caselaw relied upon in Hansome and Crabtree, the issue remains\n\nwhat causation standard must a plaintiff demonstrate to make a submissible case for\n\nretaliatory discharge under this statute. Templemire and his amici argue this Court\n\nshould align workers’ compensation discrimination cases with MHRA employment\n\ndiscrimination and public policy exception cases by adopting the “contributing factor”\n\nstandard. Employer and his amici disagree, urging this Court to adopt a “heightened” or\n\n“motivating factor” test to avoid marginally competent employees from filing the pettiest\n\nof claims in an effort to avoid a valid termination.\n\n       “There is nothing in the entire field of law which has called forth more\n\ndisagreement, or upon which the opinions are in such a welter of confusion” than\n\ncausation. Prosser and Keeton on Torts, §41 at 263 (5th ed. 1984). This Court explained\n\nthe confusion that has permeated tort law due to the different terminology used by the\n\n\n                                             18\n\fclassic Prosser and Keeton treatise and the Restatement (Second) of Torts in Callahan v.\n\nCardinal Glennon Hosp., 863 S.W.2d 852 (Mo. banc 1993). “The ‘but for’ causation test\n\nprovides that ‘the defendant’s conduct is a cause’ of the event if the event would not have\n\noccurred ‘but for’ that conduct.” Callahan, 863 S.W.2d at 860-61 (quoting Prosser, §41\n\nat 266). Prosser uses the term “proximate cause” to encompass all “but for” cases, except\n\nfor the certain limited exception to the “two fires case” in which each of two or more\n\ncauses would be sufficient, standing alone, to cause the plaintiff harm. 13\n\n       By comparison, Restatement section 430 requires a plaintiff to demonstrate the\n\ndefendant was the legal cause of his or her harm for liability to attach. Section 431\n\nprovides that legal cause is shown when the defendant’s conduct is a “substantial factor”\n\nin bringing about the harm. However, section 432 instructs that the defendant’s conduct\n\nis not a “substantial factor” unless it meets the “but for” test. Thus, the confusion arises\n\n\n\n\n13\n   “Two fires case” is an illustration used to demonstrate when the application of the “but\nfor” causation test fails to test for causation in fact accurately. The scenario entails two\nindependent tortfeasors who set fires being swept by the wind toward a piece of property,\nwith either fire sufficiently strong, standing alone, to burn down the property. Before\neither fire reaches the property, they combine and burn the property. If each actor\nnegligently set his or her respective fire, each could claim that he or she is not a factual\ncause of the harm under the “but for” causation rule because, in the absence of setting\none fire, the other fire would have burned the property. Therefore, because both actors\ncould make the same argument, a court that applied the “but for” causation test\neffectively would bar the victim from recovery from either of two negligent actors who\nwere obvious factual causes of the damages. “Thus, application of the ‘but for’ test\n“leads to a result that is almost always condemned as violating both an intuitive sense of\ncausation and good legal policy. Cases like the two fires cases have consequently put the\nsimple but-for test in doubt and courts have in fact modified that test to deal with such\ncases.” See 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Paul T. Hayden and Ellen M. Bublick, The Law of Torts,\n§189 at 631-32 (2d ed. 2011).\n\n                                             19\n\fwherein the Restatement labels all cases in which legal cause is present as requiring the\n\n“substantial factor” analysis but provides they must meet the “but for” causation test.\n\n       This Court recognizes that whether one adheres to the Restatement or Prosser, this\n\nhistorical causation analysis typically pertains to common law tort and negligence actions\n\nas opposed to statutory actions. However, as stated in Fleshner, an exclusive causation\n\nstandard is inconsistent with the proximate cause standard typically employed in tort\n\ncases. Fleshner, 304 S.W.3d at 93. Moreover, this Court cautioned that these semantic\n\ndifferences are of little consequence in Missouri because “under the MAI we do not use\n\nthe terms 1) ‘proximate cause,’ 2) ‘but for causation,’ or 3) ‘substantial factor’ when\n\ninstructing the jury.” Callahan, 863 S.W.2d at 863. See also Sundermeyer v. SSM\n\nRegional Health Services, 271 S.W.3d 552, 555 (Mo. banc 2008). Rather, “[s]uch terms\n\nare standards by which the courts determine whether a submissible case has been made\n\nand instructing the jury by use of such terms creates the potential for confusion.” Thomas\n\nv. McKeever’s Enterprises, Inc., 388 S.W.3d 206, 216 (Mo. App. W.D. 2012) (internal\n\ncitations omitted).   “We merely instruct the jury that the defendant’s conduct must\n\n‘directly cause’ or ‘directly contributed to cause’ plaintiff’s injury.” Callahan, 863\n\nS.W.3d 863 and Sundermeyer, 271 S.W.3d 555.\n\n       In recent years, this Court has addressed what causation standard Missouri\n\nplaintiffs must demonstrate to make a submissible case for various forms of employment\n\ndiscrimination. In Daugherty v. City of Maryland Heights, 231 S.W.3d 814 (Mo. banc\n\n2007), this Court held a plaintiff must prove his or her protected status under the MHRA\n\nwas a “contributing factor” to his or her discrimination or discharge to make a\n\n\n                                            20\n\fsubmissible case.    Daugherty, 231 S.W.3d at 820.        This Court made it clear that\n\nMissouri’s discrimination safeguards under the MHRA were not identical to the federal\n\nstandards and could offer greater protection. Id. at 818-19. As such, this Court rejected\n\nthe application of the burden-shifting analysis that McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\n\n411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973), employed in federal discrimination cases, commonly referred\n\nto as the “motivating factor” analysis. Further, the plain statutory language of the MHRA\n\ndid not require a plaintiff to prove that discrimination was a “substantial” or\n\n“determining” factor in an employment decision. Id. at 819. The MHRA is clear that if\n\nan employer considers age, disability or other protected characteristics when making an\n\nemployment decision, an employee has made a submissible case for discrimination. Id.\n\n      Two years later, this Court reaffirmed the application of the “contributing factor”\n\nanalysis to the plaintiff’s MHRA retaliation claims in Hill v. Ford Motor Co., 277\n\nS.W.3d 659, 665 (Mo. banc 2009), and once again rejected the burden-shifting\n\nframework employed under McDonnell Douglas. This Court explained that although\n\nclaims for discrimination and retaliation under the MHRA were contained in different\n\nsections of the act, there was no substantive difference between the claims with respect to\n\ncausation. Id.\n\n      The following year, this Court addressed the appropriate standard a plaintiff must\n\nsatisfy to prevail on a wrongful discharge claim pursuant to the public policy exception in\n\nFleshner. This Court rejected the exclusive causation standard, as discussed previously,\n\nand adopted the “contributing factor” test articulated in Daugherty and Hill. Fleshner,\n\n304 S.W.3d at 94-95. This Court found both the MHRA and the public policy exception\n\n\n                                            21\n\fmodified Missouri’s at-will employment doctrine by instructing that an employer can\n\nterminate employees, but its reasoning cannot be improper. Id. at 94. This Court\n\nexplicitly renounced a heightened standard, stating:\n\n       Likewise, cases involving both the MHRA and the public-policy exception\n       turn on whether an illegal factor played a role in the decision to discharge\n       the employee. The evidence in both types of cases directly relates to the\n       employer’s intent or motivation. The employer discharges the employee,\n       asserting a reason for the termination that may or may not be pretextual.\n       Under the MHRA, if race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry,\n       age, or disability of the employee was a “contributing factor” to the\n       discharge, then the employer has violated the MHRA. The employer’s\n       action is no less reprehensible because that factor was not the only reason.\n       Similarly, if an employee reports violations of law or refuses to violate the\n       law or public policy as described herein, it is a “contributing factor” to the\n       discharge, and the discharge is still reprehensible regardless of any other\n       reasons of the employer.\n\nId. at 94-95.\n\n       Taking into account the statutory language and this Court’s precedent in other\n\ndiscrimination cases, this Court holds that the “contributing factor” standard should apply\n\nto causes of action that arise pursuant to section 287.780. Adopting the “contributing\n\nfactor” standard serves two purposes. First, the legislature’s use of the phrase, “in any\n\nway,” is consistent with this Court’s analysis of the “contributory factor” language\n\narticulated in Daughtery, Hill, and Fleshner. Therefore, application of the “contributory\n\nfactor” standard fulfills the purpose of the statute, which is to prohibit employers from\n\ndischarging or in any way discriminating against an employee for exercising his or her\n\nrights under chapter 287.     Second, the standard now aligns workers’ compensation\n\ndiscrimination with other Missouri employment discrimination laws.\n\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f       While this Court recognizes a fundamental difference between the purposes of the\n\nMHRA and the workers’ compensation laws as a whole, there can be no tolerance for\n\nemployment discrimination in the workplace, be it based upon protected classes such as\n\ngender, race or age, or an employee blowing the whistle on an employer’s illegal\n\npractices in violation of public policy, or for exercising workers’ compensation rights.\n\nDiscrimination against an employee for exercising his or her rights under the workers’\n\ncompensation law is just as illegal, insidious, and reprehensible as discrimination under\n\nthe MHRA or for retaliatory discharge under the public policy exception of the at-will\n\nemployment doctrine.\n\n       Employer and his amici, along with this Court in Crabtree, expressed the concern\n\nthat abandoning the exclusive causation standard would render the statute a “job security\n\nact.” Crabtree stated to find otherwise would permit “an employee who admittedly was\n\nfired for tardiness, absenteeism, or incompetence at work [to] still be able to maintain a\n\ncause of action for discharge if the worker could persuade a factfinder that, in addition to\n\nthe other causes, a cause of discharge was the exercise of rights under the workers’\n\ncompensation law. Such a rule would encourage marginally competent employees to file\n\nthe most petty claims in order to enjoy the benefits of heightened job security.”\n\nCrabtree, 967 S.W.2d at 72.\n\n       This concern was legitimate at the time section 287.780 was amended to include a\n\nprivate cause of action because it was one of only a few statutes that limited the at-will\n\nemployment doctrine. Since that time, the legislature has seen fit to carve out additional\n\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fstatutory exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine, with the MHRA being one of the\n\nmost significant, which has demonstrated that these concerns are unwarranted. 14\n\nPrejudice\n\n       In addition to demonstrating the circuit court erred in requiring a faulty\n\ninstruction, Templemire bears the burden of demonstrating he suffered prejudice.\n\nPrejudicial error “is an error that materially affected the merits and outcome of the case.”\n\nD.R. Sherry Const., Ltd. v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 316 S.W.3d 899, 904 (Mo.\n\nbanc 2010).\n\n       Here, Templemire demonstrated he suffered prejudice from the submission of the\n\n“exclusive cause” language as opposed to the “contributing factor” language in the\n\nverdict director.      Templemire presented substantial evidence of Employer’s\n\ndiscrimination against him due to his filing of a workers’ compensation claim that a\n\nreasonable trier of fact could determine directly caused or contributed to cause his\n\ndischarge. There was evidence that McMullin repeatedly yelled at Templemire and\n\ncomplained to others about his injury, characterizing Templemire as a “high maintenance\n\nemployee” who “s[a]t on his a-- and dr[e]w my money.” Other injured workers were\n\nbelittled for their injuries and described as “whiners,” did not receive accommodations\n\nwhen injured, and one was discharged shortly after filing a workers’ compensation claim.\n\n\n14\n  Other statutory exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine enacted since 1973 that\nprotect an employee from being discharged or discriminated against for exercising a\nvariety of rights, in addition to those statutory exceptions noted in footnote 7, include:\nsection 494.460.1 (jury service); section 595.209 (responding to a subpoena in a criminal\nmatter); section 288.375.1 (testifying in employment security hearings); and section\n115.102.1 (serving as an election judge).\n\n                                            24\n\fTemplemire also presented evidence that his discharge was contrary to Employer’s\n\nprogressive discipline policy. Finally, Templemire presented evidence of McMullin’s\n\nstatements to Gragg, the workers’ compensation insurance claims adjuster, that he\n\nbelieved Templemire was “milking his injury” and that Templemire could sue him for\n\nwhatever reason he wanted because he paid his premiums and attorneys to handle the\n\nissues.\n\n          By instructing the jury that it had to determine Templemire was discharged\n\nexclusively in retaliation for filing a workers’ compensation claim, any evidence of\n\nTemplemire’s purported insubordination, even in the face of substantial and direct\n\nevidence of discrimination, negated Templemire’s claim.         As stated previously, the\n\nstatute does not dictate such a standard and the law will not tolerate even a portion of an\n\nemployer’s motivation to be discriminatory when discharging an employee.\n\nAccordingly, Templemire is entitled to a new trial with the submission of a verdict\n\ndirector that instructs the jury that it must determine whether his filing of a workers’\n\ncompensation claim was a “contributing factor” to his discharge.\n\n                                          Pretext\n\n          Alternatively, Templemire argues that should this Court retain the exclusive\n\ncausation standard, the circuit court erred in refusing to submit his instruction regarding\n\nEmployer’s pretextual reason for his discharge. This Court need not resolve whether\n\nTemplemire was entitled to a pretext instruction given this Court’s holding that the\n\nexclusive causation standard should be followed no longer. Templemire raised this claim\n\nin the alternative, and his concerns regarding pretext are no longer valid given that a jury\n\n\n                                            25\n\fnow will be instructed to determine whether Templemire’s exercise of his rights under\n\nthe workers’ compensation law was a contributing factor in Employer’s decision to\n\ndischarge him.\n\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       The circuit court’s judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  ______________________________\n                                                   GEORGE W.

Nw. Cooperage\n\nCo., 679 S.W.2d 273 (Mo. banc 1984), and Crabtree v. Bugby, 967 S.W.2d 66 (Mo. banc\n\n1998). The Court is not free to decide this case, which is merely a matter of statutory\n\nconstruction, as though presented with the issue of causation as a matter of first\n\nimpression.\n\n       What makes this country's legal system the envy of the modern democratic world,\n\nand what sets it apart from most others, is the reliability of the outcome of cases based on\n\nthe doctrine of stare decisis. The principal opinion gives short shrift to the doctrine of\n\nstare decisis, and it fails to recognize that adherence to precedent is most important when\n\nthat precedent concerns settled questions of statutory interpretation.       The principal\n\fopinion adopts a new statutory interpretation of an identical statute based solely on\n\narguments that this Court has already considered and rejected twice. I would affirm the\n\ncircuit court, which dutifully followed this Court's prior decisions in Hansome and\n\nCrabtree.\n\n       Section 287.780, RSMo 2000, permits an employee to bring a civil action against\n\nhis or her employer for discharging the employee in retaliation for seeking workers'\n\ncompensation benefits. In Hansome, this Court held that, for a workers' compensation\n\nretaliation claim against the employer pursuant to § 287.780, the employee must prove\n\nthat his or her action in seeking workers' compensation benefits was the \"exclusive\n\ncause\" of termination. 679 S.W.2d at 275, 277 n.2.\n\n       Fourteen years later, this Court reaffirmed that interpretation of § 287.780.\n\nCrabtree, 967 S.W.2d at 71. In Crabtree, this Court endorsed the exclusive cause\n\nstandard of Hansome because any other rule \"would encourage marginally competent\n\nemployees to file the most petty [sic] claims in order to enjoy the benefits of heightened\n\njob security.\" Id. The Court rejected the plaintiff's argument to give a more expansive\n\nconstruction to § 287.780 than that adopted in Hansome due, in part, to the absence of\n\nany intervening legislative action. Id. On the questions of stare decisis, this Court stated:\n\n\"[T]his Court should not lightly disturb its own precedent. Mere disagreement by the\n\ncurrent Court with the statutory analysis of a predecessor Court is not a satisfactory\n\nbasis for violating the doctrine of stare decisis, at least in the absence of a recurring\n\ninjustice or absurd results.\" Id. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       Other than 16 years and the changing membership of this Court, nothing has\n\nchanged that can explain why there is a legal need to change the standard of causation\n\nrequired by § 287.780.1        The statutory language never provided, and still does not\n\nprovide, a causation standard. This Court was originally forced to construe the statute in\n\nHansome and provide a standard for the element of causation. This Court in Crabtree\n\nand Hansome declared that \"exclusive cause\" was the law. Now this Court declares\n\n\"contributing factor\" is the law. The doctrine of stare decisis would have little practical\n\nor intellectual value if all it took to change the law was the passage of time and Court\n\nmembership. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it most succinctly, \"[E]stablishing that a\n\ndecision was wrong does not, without more, justify overruling it.\" Alleyne v. United\n\nStates, 133 S. Ct. 2151, 2164 (2013).\n\n       Adherence to precedent is especially vital in my view with respect to prior cases\n\ninterpreting statutes. Justice Louis Brandeis said it well in 1932:\n\n       Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more\n       important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled\n       right. This is commonly true even when the error is a matter of serious\n       concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. But in cases\n       involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative\n       action is practically impossible, this court has often overruled its earlier\n       decisions. . . . In cases involving the Federal Constitution the position of\n       this court is unlike that of the highest court of England, where the policy of\n       stare decisis was formulated and is strictly applied to all classes of cases.\n\n 1\n    The principal opinion concludes that it is appropriate for this Court to reexamine the law\nbecause the legislature since has enacted the MHRA, which created private causes of action for\nspecific categories of discrimination not related to filing a workers' compensation claim. This\nrationale seems misplaced in light of the fact that the legislature is presumed to have adopted this\nCourt's prior interpretation of § 287.780 if it does not take any action, particularly in the context\nof enacting workers' compensation legislation modifying causation standards without changing\nthis Court's prior construction of § 287.780, as explained infra.\n\n                                                 3\n\f       Parliament is free to correct any judicial error; and the remedy may be\n       promptly invoked.\n\nBurnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)\n\n(internal citations omitted), overruled by Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303\n\nU.S. 376, 387 (1938). The United States Supreme Court has continually upheld this\n\nprinciple. John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130, 138-39 (2008)\n\n(reaffirming a prior interpretation of a statute and stating that \"stare decisis in respect to\n\nstatutory interpretation has 'special force,' for 'Congress remains free to alter what we\n\nhave done'\"); California v. F.E.R.C., 495 U.S. 490, 500 (1990) (expressly adopting\n\nJustice Brandeis's view that statutory interpretations are given greater stare decisis effect\n\nthan constitutional interpretations); see also Alleyne, 133 S. Ct. at 2163 & n.5 (stating that\n\nthe force of stare decisis is at its lowest point in cases concerning procedural rules that\n\nimplicate constitutional protections).\n\n       As these cases make clear, stare decisis is most essential regarding prior statutory\n\ninterpretations because it is there that the rule of law and respect for the separation of\n\npowers meet. The General Assembly is presumed to rely on this Court's prior decisions\n\ninterpreting statutes. State ex rel. Howard Elec. Co-op. v. Riney, 490 S.W.2d 1, 9 (Mo.\n\n1970) (\"[T]he General Assembly must be presumed to have accepted the judicial and\n\nadministrative construction of its enactments . . . .\"); see State v. Grubb, 120 S.W.3d 737,\n\n740-41 (Mo. banc 2003) (Teitelman, J., dissenting) (noting that the General Assembly is\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fpresumed to know the law in enacting statutes and stating that it had implicitly adopted a\n\nprior court of appeals decision by amending the law but not overruling the case). 2\n\n        Cases interpreting statutes carry the legislature's approval when it does not take\n\naction to overrule them, and the legislature ratifies them by allowing them to stand while\n\nenacting particular legislation on the same subject matter. See F.E.R.C., 495 U.S. at 500\n\n(\"We are especially reluctant to reject this presumption in an area that has seen careful,\n\nintense, and sustained congressional attention.\"). To overrule a legislative ratification of\n\nthis Court's prior statutory interpretations is to encroach on the function of the\n\nlegislature. 3\n\n\n\n\n 2\n    State ex rel. Howard Elec. Co-op. is the last holding on point. Although this Court has stated\nthat the presumption of legislative reliance on precedent is disfavored, this Court has never\noverruled its own prior decision after stating that the presumption is insufficient reasoning, on its\nown, to reaffirm the prior decision. The Medicine Shoppe case, cited by the majority, reaffirmed\nthis Court's prior interpretation of a statute. Med. Shoppe Int'l, Inc. v. Dir. of Revenue, 156\nS.W.3d 333, 335 n.5 (Mo. banc 2005).\n  3\n    Although the People are ultimately sovereign and can change a constitution by amendment, it\nis up to this Court to say what the Missouri Constitution means. Mo. Const. art. V, sec. 3\n(stating that this Court shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction in all cases involving the\nvalidity of a statute); see Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803) (\"It is emphatically the\nprovince and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\"); see also City of Boerne v.\nFlores, 521 U.S. 507, 519 (1997) (holding that section five of the Fourteenth Amendment gives\nCongress power to enforce its provisions, not power to interpret them). Constitutional\nreinterpretation is not disfavored to the extent statutory reinterpretation is disfavored because it is\nmore problematic to infer that the People have approved or ratified a prior constitutional\ninterpretation without explicit amendment, as compared to legislation, which is relatively easier\nto enact.\n  Although the People may amend the Constitution to overrule or approve of a constitutional\ninterpretation, this kind of amendment has been rare and is difficult to achieve. E.g., U.S. Const.\namend. XI (overruling Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. 419 (1793)). And although the Missouri\nConstitution is amended more readily than the United States Constitution, and, therefore, cases\ninterpreting it deserve somewhat greater stare decisis effect, the amendment process is still\ncumbersome and \"much more difficult than a legislative change to correct an unwarranted\ninterpretation of a statute.\" Med. Shoppe Int'l, Inc., 156 S.W.3d at 335 n.5.\n\n                                                  5\n\f       The principal opinion cites various cases for the proposition that this Court may\n\noverrule its wrong decisions.    Only one of those cases overruled a prior statutory\n\ninterpretation—a 56-year old decision that the Court held could not be reconciled with\n\nthe language of the statute. Sw. Bell Yellow Pages, Inc. v. Dir. of Revenue, 94 S.W.3d\n\n388, 391 (Mo. banc 2002). In the other cases cited by the majority, this Court either\n\nreaffirmed its prior statutory interpretation or considered only a prior constitutional\n\ninterpretation or common law doctrine and not a questions of statutory interpretation. See\n\nWatts v. Lester E. Cox Med. Ctrs., 376 S.W.3d 633 (Mo. banc 2012) (interpreting article\n\nI, section 22(a), involving the right of trial by jury); Independence-Nat'l Educ. Ass'n v.\n\nIndependence Sch. Dist., 223 S.W.3d 131, 137 (Mo. banc 2007) (interpreting article I,\n\nsection 29, involving the right to bargain collectively); Med. Shoppe Int'l, Inc., 156\n\nS.W.3d 333 (reaffirming this Court's prior interpretation of a statute); Novak v. Kansas\n\nCity Transit, Inc., 365 S.W.2d 539, 547 (Mo. banc 1963) (per curiam) (overruling a prior\n\ndecision that refused to recognize a cause of action under the common law).\n\n       The principal opinion also points to Fleshner v. Pepose Vision Institute, P.C., 304\n\nS.W.3d 81, 92-93 (Mo. banc 2010), in support of its holding that the Court need not stick\n\nwith the exclusive cause standard set out in Hansome and Crabree. In Fleshner, the\n\nCourt decided that \"contributing factor\" causation was better than \"exclusive cause\" for\n\nwrongful discharge claims based on the public policy exception to the at-will doctrine.\n\nId.   The \"key distinction\" between such wrongful termination claims and workers'\n\ncompensation retaliation claims is that public policy termination claims arise under the\n\ncommon law of torts. Id.; slip op. at 12. What the majority fails to acknowledge is that\n\n\n                                            6\n\fthe common law is the exclusive prerogative of the judiciary, for which this Court is the\n\nultimate authority. 4 Although this Court has adopted the contributing factor causation\n\nstandard for retaliation claims under the MHRA, as the principal opinion notes, this Court\n\nin Hill v. Ford Motor Co. merely reaffirmed its interpretation of the MHRA. 277 S.W.3d\n\n659, 665 (Mo. banc 2009) (reaffirming Daugherty v. City of Maryland Heights, 231\n\nS.W.3d 814, 819-20 (Mo. banc 2007)); slip op. at 21.\n\n       The holdings in Hansome and Crabtree were not based on judicially created\n\ncommon law doctrine, nor were they interpretations of an infrequently amended state\n\nconstitution or the tough-to-amend United States Constitution. They were interpretations\n\nof a Missouri statute, on which the General Assembly is presumed to rely, and to which\n\nthis Court should give the greatest stare decisis effect. State ex rel. Howard Elec. Co-op.,\n\n490 S.W.2d at 9.\n\n       The principal opinion states that this Court did not \"analyze or interpret the\n\nwording of section 287.780\" in Hansome. Slip op. at 10. This Court in Hansome quoted\n\n§ 287.780, then stated the four elements necessary to make a claim. 679 S.W.2d at 275-\n\n76. It did cite Davis and Mitchell as precedent for all four elements, but then analyzed\n\nthose cases and another court of appeals case regarding the element of causation. Id. at\n\n 4\n     Because stare decisis is at its strongest in cases involving statutory interpretation, it\nnecessarily is at its weakest in cases involving common law doctrines. Although the rule of law\nstill demands that this Court not lightly overrule its prior common law decisions (because it is\nimperative to retain them in the interests of reliance, predictability, and stability), this Court is\nthe ultimate authority on questions of Missouri common law. In deciding whether to overrule\nprior decisions based solely on common law doctrine, this Court does not face the same\nseparation of powers concerns it faces in deciding whether to overrule prior interpretations of\nstatutes and, to a lesser degree, the United States and Missouri constitutions.\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\f275-76 & n.2. This Court recognized that the text of § 287.780 did not provide a specific\n\ncausation standard.    Then, this Court's opinion analyzed how enacting § 287.780\n\nnecessarily modified the at-will employment doctrine and how that justified the holdings\n\nof the prior court of appeals decisions construing § 287.780 to require the filing of a\n\nworkers' compensation claim to be the exclusive cause for the termination. Id. at 275 n.2.\n\nWhile reasonable minds may differ in hindsight as to whether that construction was\n\ncorrect, there is no doubt that this Court was required to, and did, construe § 287.780 in\n\nHansome.\n\n       The presumption of legislative reliance on Hansome and Crabtree has even\n\ngreater weight here because the General Assembly overhauled the workers' compensation\n\nlaw in 2005. Not only did it expressly abrogate other prior cases of this Court and the\n\ncourt of appeals by name and citation, see, e.g., Drewes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,\n\n984 S.W.2d 512, 514-15 (Mo. banc 1999); Kasl v. Bristol Care, Inc., 984 S.W.2d 852,\n\n853-54 (Mo. banc 1999); Bennett v. Columbia Health Care, 80 S.W.3d 524, 531-32 (Mo.\n\nApp. 2002), the 2005 amendments took affirmative steps to abrogate a different\n\ncausation standard, while leaving this Court's decisions in Hansome and Crabtree\n\nundisturbed.    The General Assembly thereby demonstrated its intent to retain the\n\nexclusive cause standard for workers' compensation retaliation claims. 5\n\n\n 5\n   In 2005, the General Assembly repealed 35 sections of the revised statutes of Missouri and\nenacted 40 new sections \"relating to workers' compensation law.\" Act of Mar. 30, 2005, S.B. 1\n& 130, 2005 Mo. Laws 907, 907 (codified as amended at chapters 286 and 287, RSMo Supp.\n2013). This Court and the court of appeals had previously held that, to obtain a workers'\ncompensation award for accidental injury, an employer need only show that the employee's work\nwas a \"substantial factor\" in the cause of the injury. Drewes, 984 S.W.2d at 514-15; Kasl, 984\n\n                                              8\n\f       Contrary to the suggestion in the principal opinion, the 2005 amendments discredit\n\nthe attempt to characterize this case as merely involving \"legislative inaction.\" The\n\nGeneral Assembly took affirmative steps that demonstrate its intent to retain the\n\nexclusive cause standard. It enacted a new causation standard for determining workers'\n\ncompensation coverage of accidental injuries by expressly abrogating two of this Court's\n\nprior decisions by name. It could have enacted a new causation standard for workers'\n\ncompensation retaliation cases by abrogating Hansome and Crabtree.                It did not.\n\nAccordingly, the principal opinion's failure to adhere to this Court's prior interpretation of\n\n§ 287.780 offends the separation of powers by encroaching on the General Assembly's\n\nratification of the exclusive cause standard. Even if the \"contributing factor\" standard is\n\nthe better rule, this Court should not usurp the legislative function by re-deciding settled\n\nquestions of statutory construction due solely to a change of heart.\n\n       Finally, it should be noted that the principal opinion assumes that, if the legislature\n\ndislikes this Court's decision to change the law from \"exclusive cause\" to \"contributing\n\nfactor,\" the General Assembly is free to abrogate this holding by passing a bill to\n\nreinstate the exclusive cause standard.        Once this Court puts this burden on the\n\nlegislature, however, there is no reason why the General Assembly could not go the next\n\nstep and repeal § 287.780 to eliminate the private cause of action entirely. Rather than\n\n\n\n\nS.W.2d at 853-54; Bennett, 80 S.W.3d at 531-32. The General Assembly expressly abrogated\nthose three decisions and replaced the \"substantial factor\" causation test with the \"prevailing\nfactor\" causation test. 2005 Mo. Laws at 910-11 (codified at §§ 287.020(3)(1), 287.020(10),\nRSMo Supp. 2013).\n\n                                              9\n\frisk watching such a debate, I would adhere to the principle of stare decisis, reaffirm this\n\nCourt's holdings in Hansome and Crabtree, and affirm the circuit court's judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                 ___________________________\n                                                 Zel M.

On\n\nJanuary 9, 2006, Templemire was injured in the course and scope of his employment\n\nwhen a large metal beam fell from a forklift and crushed his left foot. Templemire’s\n\ninjury required surgery and the installation of plating and screws into his foot.\n\nTemplemire reported the injury to Employer and filed a workers’ compensation claim for\n\nwhich he received benefits.\n\n       Approximately three to four weeks following his injury, Templemire was cleared\n\nto return to work with certain restrictions.      Templemire was instructed to wear a\n\nprotective boot on his injured foot while at work and was prohibited from climbing\n\n\n2\n  This Court transferred this case after an opinion by the Missouri Court of Appeals,\nWestern District. Portions of the court of appeals opinion are incorporated without\nfurther attribution.\n\fladders. The following month, Templemire’s physician added a restriction preventing\n\nTemplemire from driving a vehicle with a clutch. In July 2006, Templemire’s physician\n\nordered that he only perform seated work due to continuing complications from his\n\ninjury. In September 2006, the seated restriction was lifted, but Templemire’s physician\n\nimplemented new restrictions, which included restraining him from climbing stairs,\n\npushing, pulling, and standing longer than one hour without a fifteen-minute break.\n\n      As a result of these restrictions, Employer placed Templemire on “light duty”\n\nwhen he returned to work even though light duty work was not available when\n\nTemplemire returned. Employer’s owner, Gary McMullin (hereinafter, “McMullin”),\n\naccommodated the restrictions and created a light duty work assignment for Templemire\n\nby assigning him to be a tool room assistant to Nick Twenter (hereinafter, “Twenter”).\n\n      On November 29, 2006, Templemire remained on light duty. McMullin received\n\na request from a customer to have a railing washed and painted for pick up later that\n\nafternoon. Templemire testified that when he arrived at work that morning, he did not\n\nspeak to McMullin. Instead, Twenter informed Templemire that he would need to wash\n\nthe railing, but that it was not ready. Twenter then assigned him to complete other tasks\n\nwhile the railing was prepared for washing. Templemire completed these tasks and\n\nreturned to the job site. Around 1:50 p.m., Templemire went toward the wash bay to\n\nwash the railing. Before reaching the wash bay, Templemire stopped to rest his foot,\n\nwhich was infected.\n\n      During this break, McMullin confronted Templemire and cursed at him because\n\nthe railing had not been washed. Templemire tried to explain the railing had just arrived\n\n\n                                            3\n\fin the wash bay, and he intended to wash the railing as soon as his break was over. After\n\ncontinuing to curse at Templemire, McMullin discharged Templemire effective\n\nimmediately. Templemire asked McMullin if he was sure he wanted to fire him “because\n\n[he] was going to go home and call workman’s [sic] comp?” to which McMullin replied,\n\n“I don’t give a f--- what you do, this is my f---ing place.”\n\n       After being terminated, Templemire contacted Liz Gragg (hereinafter, “Gragg”),\n\nthe insurance adjuster on his workers’ compensation claim.           Gragg subsequently\n\ncontacted McMullin to discuss Templemire’s discharge.           Gragg’s notes from her\n\nconversation with McMullin reflected that, after Gragg indicated Templemire had work\n\nrestrictions that required him to take a break, McMullin “went on a [tirade] about\n\n[Templemire] ‘milking’ his injury and that he can sue him for whatever reason that is\n\nwhat he pays his premiums for and the [attorneys].”\n\n       Templemire subsequently filed suit against Employer pursuant to section 287.780\n\nalleging he was discharged in retaliation for filing a workers’ compensation claim. At the\n\ntrial, McMullin characterized Templemire as a “high maintenance employee” and\n\ndisputed Templemire’s account of what transpired between them. McMullin testified he\n\nplaced the railing in the wash bay early in the morning. McMullin directed Templemire\n\nto wash the railing immediately and to disregard any other assignments from Twenter or\n\nanyone else until the washing was complete.              McMullin returned to check on\n\nTemplemire’s progress two hours later and found the railing unwashed and Templemire\n\ntaking a break. McMullin testified that Templemire told him that he needed a break for\n\nhis foot and if McMullin did not like it, he could take it up with Templemire’s physician.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fMcMullin advised Templemire that he did not work for Templemire’s physician and\n\ndischarged Templemire for insubordination.\n\n         Templemire presented evidence that McMullin yelled at him due to this injury and\n\nreferred to other workers who had been injured as “whiners.” Templemire also offered\n\ntestimony from former employees who were belittled as a result of their injuries and who\n\ndid not receive work accommodations. One witness testified he was discharged shortly\n\nafter filing a workers’ compensation claim. Another witness testified that he overheard\n\nMcMullin yell at Templemire, “[a]ll you do is sit on your a-- and draw my money”\n\nduring the argument that resulted in Templemire’s discharge. Templemire’s immediate\n\ndischarge was contrary to Employer’s progressive discipline policy, which was submitted\n\ninto evidence. Templemire presented evidence about another employee who received\n\nmultiple disciplinary write-ups and had a drug problem but had not been discharged. By\n\ncontrast, after returning to work, Templemire received his only disciplinary write-up for\n\nfailing to wear a paint mask while in the paint booth. Despite this one issue, Templemire\n\nwas regarded as a good employee who performed his tasks efficiently.\n\n         During the jury instruction conference, Templemire argued MAI-23.13, 3 the\n\napplicable MAI-approved verdict director, misstated the law insofar as it required a\n\nfinding that Templemire’s filing of a workers’ compensation claim was the exclusive\n\nfactor in Employer’s decision to terminate him to prevail on his claim. Templemire\n\noffered an alternative instruction stating the jury could find in his favor if the filing of the\n\nworkers’ compensation claim was a contributing factor to Employer’s decision to\n\n3\n    MAI 23.13 has been replaced with MAI 38.04.\n\n                                               5\n\fdischarge him. 4    Alternatively, Templemire submitted a pretext instruction, which\n\nadvised the jury that it could find exclusive causation if it found that Employer’s stated\n\nreason for his discharge was a mere pretext, rather than the true reason stated. 5 The\n\ncircuit court refused both of Templemire’s instructions and advised the jury it had to find\n\nthe filing of a workers’ compensation claim was the exclusive factor considered by\n\nEmployer when it terminated Templemire for him to prevail on his claim. The jury\n\nreturned a verdict in Employer’s favor. After an opinion by the court of appeals, this\n\nCourt granted transfer. 6 Mo. Const. art.

Section 287.780 was amended in\n\n1973 to provide employees with the private right of action that remains today.\n\n       The first case to address the statute after the legislature provided employees with a\n\nprivate cause of action was Mitchell v. St. Louis County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2431739\"><a href=\"/opinion/2431739/mitchell-v-st-louis-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mo. App. E.D.\n\n1978). In Mitchell, the plaintiff alleged her discharge was discriminatory because it\n\noccurred six months after she filed a workers’ compensation claim for a back injury. Id.\n\nat 814. The court affirmed the circuit court’s entry of a directed verdict in the employer’s\n\nfavor after the employer demonstrated the plaintiff was discharged due to excessive\n\nabsenteeism unrelated to the injury. Id. The court stated, “It is palpable that a cause of\n\naction lies only if an employee is discharged discriminatorily by reason of exercising his\n\nor her rights” under the workers’ compensation law. Id. at 815. Here, the employer\n\npresented evidence of a valid and nonpretextual motive to discharge the plaintiff. Id.\n\n       A plaintiff’s need to demonstrate a causal connection between his or her exercise\n\nof workers’ compensation rights and the subsequent discharge was discussed in Davis v.\n\nRichmond Special Road Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1485776\"><a href=\"/opinion/1485776/davis-v-richmond-special-road-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mo. App. W.D. 1983). The court\n\nexplained:\n\n       By its wording, section 287.780 is, to the extent of authorizing recovery of\n       damages by a civil action, penal in nature. The statute predicates recovery\n       upon the discharge or discrimination of an employee for the exercise of his\n       or her workers’ compensation rights. By its wording, the statute does not\n       convey an intent that mere discharge of an employee gives rise to a claim\n       against the employer. On the other hand, the statute reveals a legislative\n       intent that there must be a causal relationship between the exercise of the\n       right by the employee and his discharge by his employer arising precisely\n       from the employee’s exercise of his rights, and upon proof, that the\n       discharge was related to the employee’s exercise of his or her rights. In its\n       enactment of section 287.780, the General Assembly did not prohibit\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       (although it could have) the discharge of employees merely during the\n       pendency of a claim for workers’ compensation. On the other hand, the\n       General Assembly, by its wording of section 287.780, enacted a prohibition\n       against employers (to the extent they might be liable for damages in a\n       separate civil proceeding) not to discriminate or discharge employees\n       because of the employee’s exercise of his or her rights relative to a\n       workers’ compensation claim. Stated another way, the legislative intent\n       conveyed by the statute is to authorize recovery for damages if, upon proof,\n       it be shown that the employee was discriminated against or discharged\n       simply because of the exercise of his or her rights regarding a workers’\n       compensation claim.\n\nId. at 255. (Emphasis added).\n\n       For the first time in Hansome v. Northwestern Cooperage Co., this Court set forth\n\nthe elements a plaintiff must demonstrate to make a submissible case for a claim brought\n\npursuant to section 287.780: “(1) plaintiff’s status as employee of defendant before\n\ninjury, (2) plaintiff’s exercise of a right granted by Chapter 287, (3) employer’s discharge\n\nof or discrimination against plaintiff, and (4) an exclusive causal relationship between\n\nplaintiff’s actions and defendant’s actions.” Hansome, 679 S.W.2d at 275. (Emphasis\n\nadded). This Court did not analyze or interpret the wording of section 287.780; rather, it\n\ncited Mitchell and Davis as support for its declaration that the exclusive causation\n\nstandard was appropriate for this cause of action.            This Court further explained,\n\n“Causality does not exist if the basis for discharge is valid and nonpretextual.” Id. at 277,\n\nn.2.\n\n       This Court reaffirmed the holding in Hansome in Crabtree v. Bugby. In Crabtree,\n\nthe employer challenged the verdict director submitted by the discharged employee that\n\ndirected the jury to return a verdict in her favor if it found “as a direct result of plaintiff’s\n\nfiling of a claim for [workers’] compensation, defendant discharged plaintiff.” Crabtree,\n\n\n                                               10\n\f967 S.W.2d at 71. (Emphasis added). This Court found the instruction was erroneous\n\nbecause it permitted the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff even though the reasons\n\nfor her discharge included causes other than filing a workers’ compensation claim. Id.\n\nThis Court held the jury should have been instructed that it had to find the exclusive\n\ncause of the plaintiff’s discharge was the filing of her claim as articulated in Hansome.\n\nId. This Court explained:\n\n       Once this Court by case law has resolved the elements of a cause of action\n       pursuant to section 287.780, neither the trial court nor the court of appeals\n       is free to redefine the elements in every case that comes before them. Mo.\n       Const. art. V, sec. 2. Similarly, this Court should not lightly disturb its own\n       precedent. Mere disagreement by the current Court with the statutory\n       analysis of a predecessor Court is not a satisfactory basis for violating the\n       doctrine of stare decisis, at least in the absence of a recurring injustice or\n       absurd results. 8\n\nId. at 71-72.\n\n       The disagreement regarding the statutory analysis was set forth in the dissenting\n\nopinion in Crabtree. The dissent stated section 287.780 did not contain any language\n\nsuggesting that an employee is entitled to relief only when he or she has been discharged\n\n\n8\n  Echoing this concern in Crabtree, the dissenting opinion likewise asserts the reason this\nCourt has overruled Hansome and Crabtree is due solely to a change of heart by the\nchanged membership of the Court, not based upon a legal need. Undoubtedly, the\nmembership of this Court, as well as that of the legislature, has changed dramatically\nsince Hansome was decided in 1984 and Crabtree in 1998. However, today’s decision\nstems from this Court’s duty to address an appellant’s properly raised challenge\nrequesting reexamination of this Court’s precedent in light of the current legal landscape.\nMoreover, reexamination is warranted given the legislature’s expansive enactment of a\nnumber of statutes that protect Missouri’s citizens from discrimination, most notably\npassage of the MHRA. Given the legislature’s demonstrated intent that discrimination,\nbased on any number of factors, will not be tolerated in the workplace, it is appropriate\nfor this Court to reevaluate the accuracy of the exclusive causation standard.\n\n\n                                             11\n\f“solely” or “exclusively” because the employee sought the protection afforded by\n\nworkers’ compensation.      Id. at 73.

The defendant in Fleshner modeled its jury instruction after\n\nthe MAI-approved instruction that relied on the Hansome factors to prove a claim of\n\nretaliatory discharge and used the exclusive cause language. This Court noted, “Nowhere\n\nin the workers’ compensation laws does ‘exclusive causal’ or ‘exclusive causation’\n\nlanguage appear.” Id. The Court acknowledged there was a key distinction between\n\nworkers’ compensation retaliation cases and public policy exception cases, in that the\n\nformer arises under the statute, while the latter arises under the common law. Id. at 93.\n\nFleshner found the exclusive causation standard was “inconsistent with the proximate\n\ncause standard typically employed in tort cases.”      Id.   Moreover, this Court found\n\napplication of the exclusive causation standard would discourage employees from\n\nreporting their employers’ violations of the law or for refusing to violate the law. Id. In\n\nother words, application of the exclusive causation standard “would result in an exception\n\nthat fails to accomplish its task of protecting employees who refuse to violate the law or\n\npublic policy.” Id.\n\n\n                                            12\n\fStare Decisis\n\n         Templemire acknowledges the applicable holdings in Hansome and Crabtree but\n\nurges this Court to reexamine those cases in light of this Court’s recent criticisms in\n\nFleshner.

Neither Mitchell nor Davis contains any reference whatsoever to a\n\nheightened or exclusive causation standard for a plaintiff to prevail on a claim for\n\nretaliatory discharge under the workers’ compensation law. Mitchell did not address\n\ncausation explicitly, while Davis recognized causation was an element of the claim but\n\ndid not allude to an “exclusive causation” standard by any means.              The dissent in\n\nCrabtree aptly described the holding in Hansome as “an aberration” in which the\n\n“exclusive” language “appears to be plucked out of thin air” with no support in the\n\ncaselaw or statutory interpretation. As the learned jurist Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes\n\nJr. admonished, “It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it\n\nwas laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon\n\nwhich it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind\n\nimitation of the past.” Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev.\n\n457, 469 (1897).9 Thus, the holdings in Hansome and Crabtree are clearly erroneous and\n\nstare decisis should not be applied to prevent their repudiation. 10\n\n\n9\n   The dissenting opinion cites another learned jurist, Justice Louis Brandeis, for the\nproposition that “it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it\nbe settled right.” Staunch adherence to stare decisis based solely on this notion would\nresult in a society in which insidious discrimination still would subject school children to\nbeing segregated into schools that were purportedly separate but equal, women could not\nserve on juries, interracial marriage still would be subject to criminal prosecution, and\ncrime victims would be prohibited from offering impact testimony during the punishment\nphase of death penalty trials.\n10\n   The dissenting opinion accuses this Court of failing to acknowledge that the common\nlaw is the exclusive prerogative of the judiciary, for which this Court is the ultimate\nauthority, and that stare decisis is at its strongest in cases of statutory interpretation. This\nCourt did not employ the tenets of statutory construction when it articulated the exclusive\n\n                                              14\n\fLegislative Inaction\n\n       Employer and its amici assert the legislature had ample opportunity to correct any\n\nmisstatement by this Court of the exclusive causation standard and chose not to do so,\n\nparticularly when it substantially revised the workers’ compensation laws in 2005.11\n\nTemplemire argues that legislative inaction is not a factor that trumps other rules of\n\nstatutory construction, and that section 287.780 has been construed improperly since\n\nHansome.\n\n       If this Court rejects a litigant’s pleas to overrule existing caselaw, a party can seek\n\nredress with the legislature to implore it to change an incorrect or otherwise undesirable\n\ninterpretation of a statute. Med. Shoppe, 156 S.W.3d at 334. This Court explained the\n\nfallacy of relying upon legislative inaction as tacit approval of an interpretation of a\n\nstatute:\n\n       The General Assembly’s inaction has sometimes been interpreted to be\n       approval of the Court’s reading of a statute. Legislative inaction, however,\n\ncausation standard in Hansome or when it reaffirmed the standard in Crabtree. Rather,\nHansome merely turned to common law causation principles to fill the causation void in\nan otherwise silent statute. In doing so, this Court misconstrued the holdings in Mitchell\nand Davis, which the dissent does not contest. Only now is this Court examining the\nplain meaning of the statute to determine legislative intent to discern the appropriate\ncausation standard.\n11\n   The dissenting opinion asserts that today’s decision encroaches on the legislature’s\nimplicit adoption of the exclusive causation standard given the extensive amendments to\nthe workers’ compensation statutes in 2005 and fears this decision will invite the\nlegislature to do away with the private right of action altogether. The dissent’s fear is\nspeculative at best given the legislature’s enactment of a number of statutes that protect\ncitizens from discrimination since Hansome was decided. It was this Court’s misguided\nproclamation of the exclusive causation standard in Hansome that effectively eviscerated\nthe legislature’s plain intent to prohibit employers from discriminating “in any way”\nagainst an employee who exercised his or her workers’ compensation rights.\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       can just as well mean that the forces arrayed in favor of changing the law\n       are matched by the forces against changing it. In truth, the match does not\n       have to be an even one, for the legislative process in our republican form of\n       government is designed more to prevent the passage of legislation than to\n       encourage it. An incorrect judicial interpretation of a statute may also stand\n       simply because the legislature has paid no attention to it. Thus, it is\n       speculative to infer legislative approval from legislative inaction.\n\nId. at 334-35.\n\n       “Workers’ compensation law is entirely a creature of statute, and when\n\ninterpreting the law the court must ascertain the intent of the legislature by considering\n\nthe plain and ordinary meaning of the terms and give effect to that intent if possible.”\n\nHayes v.

Undisputedly, section\n\n287.780 does not contain the word “exclusively” or “solely” or “only” to support the\n\nexclusive causation standard articulated in Hansome. 12 Further, the legislative dictate is\n\nclear that it is inappropriate for an employer to give any consideration to the fact that an\n\nemployee filed a workers’ compensation claim when making employment decisions.\n\n       Moreover, in Reed v.

Id.\n\nAs it stands today, an employer’s discrimination against or discharge of an employee who\n\n12\n   Compare, Ala. Code § 25-5-11.1 (“No employee shall be terminated by an employer\nsolely because the employee has instituted or maintained any action against the employer\nto recover workers’ compensation benefits ….”); Haw. Rev. Stat. § 386-142 (“It shall be\nunlawful for any employer to suspend or discharge any employee solely because the\nemployee suffers any work injury which is compensable under this chapter and which\narises out of and in the course of employment with the employer unless it is shown to the\nsatisfaction of the director that the employee will no longer be capable of performing the\nemployee’s work as a result of the work injury and that employer has no other available\nwork which the employee is capable of performing.”); Md. Code Labor & Emply, § 9-\n1105 (“An employer may not discharge a covered employee from employment solely\nbecause the covered employee files a claim for [workers’] compensation ….”); N.M. Stat.\nAnn. § 52-1-28.2A (“An employer shall not discharge, threaten to discharge or otherwise\nretaliate in the terms or conditions of employment against a worker who seeks workers’\ncompensation benefits for the sole reason that that employee seeks workers’\ncompensation benefits.”); and Va. Code Ann. § 65.2-308A (“No employer or person shall\ndischarge an employee solely because the employee intends to file or has filed a claim\nunder this title or has testified or is about to testify in any proceeding under this title.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\fexercises his or her rights under section 287.780 is acceptable so long as it is not the\n\nexclusive cause of the employer’s action. Thus, the imposition of an exclusive causation\n\nstandard effectively deprives an employee’s right to remedy the evil of being\n\ndiscriminated against or discharged for exercising workers’ compensation rights.\n\n       Hence, the reasoning in Hansome, and the cases it relied on, is flawed. Therefore,\n\nto the extent Hansome, Crabtree, and their progeny require a plaintiff to demonstrate his\n\nor her exercise of workers’ compensation rights was the exclusive cause of his or her\n\ndischarge or discrimination, they no longer should be followed.\n\nAppropriate Causation Standard\n\n       Because the exclusive causation standard is unsupported by the plain language of\n\nsection 287.780 and the caselaw relied upon in Hansome and Crabtree, the issue remains\n\nwhat causation standard must a plaintiff demonstrate to make a submissible case for\n\nretaliatory discharge under this statute. Templemire and his amici argue this Court\n\nshould align workers’ compensation discrimination cases with MHRA employment\n\ndiscrimination and public policy exception cases by adopting the “contributing factor”\n\nstandard. Employer and his amici disagree, urging this Court to adopt a “heightened” or\n\n“motivating factor” test to avoid marginally competent employees from filing the pettiest\n\nof claims in an effort to avoid a valid termination.\n\n       “There is nothing in the entire field of law which has called forth more\n\ndisagreement, or upon which the opinions are in such a welter of confusion” than\n\ncausation. Prosser and Keeton on Torts, §41 at 263 (5th ed. 1984).

Prosser uses the term “proximate cause” to encompass all “but for” cases, except\n\nfor the certain limited exception to the “two fires case” in which each of two or more\n\ncauses would be sufficient, standing alone, to cause the plaintiff harm. 13\n\n       By comparison, Restatement section 430 requires a plaintiff to demonstrate the\n\ndefendant was the legal cause of his or her harm for liability to attach. Section 431\n\nprovides that legal cause is shown when the defendant’s conduct is a “substantial factor”\n\nin bringing about the harm. However, section 432 instructs that the defendant’s conduct\n\nis not a “substantial factor” unless it meets the “but for” test. Thus, the confusion arises\n\n\n\n\n13\n   “Two fires case” is an illustration used to demonstrate when the application of the “but\nfor” causation test fails to test for causation in fact accurately. The scenario entails two\nindependent tortfeasors who set fires being swept by the wind toward a piece of property,\nwith either fire sufficiently strong, standing alone, to burn down the property. Before\neither fire reaches the property, they combine and burn the property. If each actor\nnegligently set his or her respective fire, each could claim that he or she is not a factual\ncause of the harm under the “but for” causation rule because, in the absence of setting\none fire, the other fire would have burned the property. Therefore, because both actors\ncould make the same argument, a court that applied the “but for” causation test\neffectively would bar the victim from recovery from either of two negligent actors who\nwere obvious factual causes of the damages. “Thus, application of the ‘but for’ test\n“leads to a result that is almost always condemned as violating both an intuitive sense of\ncausation and good legal policy. Cases like the two fires cases have consequently put the\nsimple but-for test in doubt and courts have in fact modified that test to deal with such\ncases.” See 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Paul T. Hayden and Ellen M. Bublick, The Law of Torts,\n§189 at 631-32 (2d ed. 2011).\n\n                                             19\n\fwherein the Restatement labels all cases in which legal cause is present as requiring the\n\n“substantial factor” analysis but provides they must meet the “but for” causation test.\n\n       This Court recognizes that whether one adheres to the Restatement or Prosser, this\n\nhistorical causation analysis typically pertains to common law tort and negligence actions\n\nas opposed to statutory actions. However, as stated in Fleshner, an exclusive causation\n\nstandard is inconsistent with the proximate cause standard typically employed in tort\n\ncases. Fleshner, 304 S.W.3d at 93. Moreover, this Court cautioned that these semantic\n\ndifferences are of little consequence in Missouri because “under the MAI we do not use\n\nthe terms 1) ‘proximate cause,’ 2) ‘but for causation,’ or 3) ‘substantial factor’ when\n\ninstructing the jury.” Callahan, 863 S.W.2d at 863.

Id. at 94. This Court\n\nexplicitly renounced a heightened standard, stating:\n\n       Likewise, cases involving both the MHRA and the public-policy exception\n       turn on whether an illegal factor played a role in the decision to discharge\n       the employee. The evidence in both types of cases directly relates to the\n       employer’s intent or motivation. The employer discharges the employee,\n       asserting a reason for the termination that may or may not be pretextual.\n       Under the MHRA, if race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry,\n       age, or disability of the employee was a “contributing factor” to the\n       discharge, then the employer has violated the MHRA. The employer’s\n       action is no less reprehensible because that factor was not the only reason.\n       Similarly, if an employee reports violations of law or refuses to violate the\n       law or public policy as described herein, it is a “contributing factor” to the\n       discharge, and the discharge is still reprehensible regardless of any other\n       reasons of the employer.\n\nId. at 94-95.\n\n       Taking into account the statutory language and this Court’s precedent in other\n\ndiscrimination cases, this Court holds that the “contributing factor” standard should apply\n\nto causes of action that arise pursuant to section 287.780. Adopting the “contributing\n\nfactor” standard serves two purposes. First, the legislature’s use of the phrase, “in any\n\nway,” is consistent with this Court’s analysis of the “contributory factor” language\n\narticulated in Daughtery, Hill, and Fleshner. Therefore, application of the “contributory\n\nfactor” standard fulfills the purpose of the statute, which is to prohibit employers from\n\ndischarging or in any way discriminating against an employee for exercising his or her\n\nrights under chapter 287.     Second, the standard now aligns workers’ compensation\n\ndiscrimination with other Missouri employment discrimination laws.\n\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f       While this Court recognizes a fundamental difference between the purposes of the\n\nMHRA and the workers’ compensation laws as a whole, there can be no tolerance for\n\nemployment discrimination in the workplace, be it based upon protected classes such as\n\ngender, race or age, or an employee blowing the whistle on an employer’s illegal\n\npractices in violation of public policy, or for exercising workers’ compensation rights.\n\nDiscrimination against an employee for exercising his or her rights under the workers’\n\ncompensation law is just as illegal, insidious, and reprehensible as discrimination under\n\nthe MHRA or for retaliatory discharge under the public policy exception of the at-will\n\nemployment doctrine.\n\n       Employer and his amici, along with this Court in Crabtree, expressed the concern\n\nthat abandoning the exclusive causation standard would render the statute a “job security\n\nact.” Crabtree stated to find otherwise would permit “an employee who admittedly was\n\nfired for tardiness, absenteeism, or incompetence at work [to] still be able to maintain a\n\ncause of action for discharge if the worker could persuade a factfinder that, in addition to\n\nthe other causes, a cause of discharge was the exercise of rights under the workers’\n\ncompensation law. Such a rule would encourage marginally competent employees to file\n\nthe most petty claims in order to enjoy the benefits of heightened job security.”\n\nCrabtree, 967 S.W.2d at 72.\n\n       This concern was legitimate at the time section 287.780 was amended to include a\n\nprivate cause of action because it was one of only a few statutes that limited the at-will\n\nemployment doctrine. Since that time, the legislature has seen fit to carve out additional\n\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fstatutory exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine, with the MHRA being one of the\n\nmost significant, which has demonstrated that these concerns are unwarranted. 14\n\nPrejudice\n\n       In addition to demonstrating the circuit court erred in requiring a faulty\n\ninstruction, Templemire bears the burden of demonstrating he suffered prejudice.\n\nPrejudicial error “is an error that materially affected the merits and outcome of the case.”\n\nD.R. Sherry Const., Ltd. v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1873435\"><a href=\"/opinion/1873435/dr-sherry-const-v-american-family-mut/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 904 (Mo.\n\nbanc 2010).\n\n       Here, Templemire demonstrated he suffered prejudice from the submission of the\n\n“exclusive cause” language as opposed to the “contributing factor” language in the\n\nverdict director.      Templemire presented substantial evidence of Employer’s\n\ndiscrimination against him due to his filing of a workers’ compensation claim that a\n\nreasonable trier of fact could determine directly caused or contributed to cause his\n\ndischarge. There was evidence that McMullin repeatedly yelled at Templemire and\n\ncomplained to others about his injury, characterizing Templemire as a “high maintenance\n\nemployee” who “s[a]t on his a-- and dr[e]w my money.” Other injured workers were\n\nbelittled for their injuries and described as “whiners,” did not receive accommodations\n\nwhen injured, and one was discharged shortly after filing a workers’ compensation claim.\n\n\n14\n  Other statutory exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine enacted since 1973 that\nprotect an employee from being discharged or discriminated against for exercising a\nvariety of rights, in addition to those statutory exceptions noted in footnote 7, include:\nsection 494.460.1 (jury service); section 595.209 (responding to a subpoena in a criminal\nmatter); section 288.375.1 (testifying in employment security hearings); and section\n115.102.1 (serving as an election judge).\n\n                                            24\n\fTemplemire also presented evidence that his discharge was contrary to Employer’s\n\nprogressive discipline policy. Finally, Templemire presented evidence of McMullin’s\n\nstatements to Gragg, the workers’ compensation insurance claims adjuster, that he\n\nbelieved Templemire was “milking his injury” and that Templemire could sue him for\n\nwhatever reason he wanted because he paid his premiums and attorneys to handle the\n\nissues.\n\n          By instructing the jury that it had to determine Templemire was discharged\n\nexclusively in retaliation for filing a workers’ compensation claim, any evidence of\n\nTemplemire’s purported insubordination, even in the face of substantial and direct\n\nevidence of discrimination, negated Templemire’s claim.         As stated previously, the\n\nstatute does not dictate such a standard and the law will not tolerate even a portion of an\n\nemployer’s motivation to be discriminatory when discharging an employee.\n\nAccordingly, Templemire is entitled to a new trial with the submission of a verdict\n\ndirector that instructs the jury that it must determine whether his filing of a workers’\n\ncompensation claim was a “contributing factor” to his discharge.\n\n                                          Pretext\n\n          Alternatively, Templemire argues that should this Court retain the exclusive\n\ncausation standard, the circuit court erred in refusing to submit his instruction regarding\n\nEmployer’s pretextual reason for his discharge. This Court need not resolve whether\n\nTemplemire was entitled to a pretext instruction given this Court’s holding that the\n\nexclusive causation standard should be followed no longer. Templemire raised this claim\n\nin the alternative, and his concerns regarding pretext are no longer valid given that a jury\n\n\n                                            25\n\fnow will be instructed to determine whether Templemire’s exercise of his rights under\n\nthe workers’ compensation law was a contributing factor in Employer’s decision to\n\ndischarge him.\n\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       The circuit court’s judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  ______________________________\n                                                   GEORGE W.

The Court is not free to decide this case, which is merely a matter of statutory\n\nconstruction, as though presented with the issue of causation as a matter of first\n\nimpression.\n\n       What makes this country's legal system the envy of the modern democratic world,\n\nand what sets it apart from most others, is the reliability of the outcome of cases based on\n\nthe doctrine of stare decisis. The principal opinion gives short shrift to the doctrine of\n\nstare decisis, and it fails to recognize that adherence to precedent is most important when\n\nthat precedent concerns settled questions of statutory interpretation.       The principal\n\fopinion adopts a new statutory interpretation of an identical statute based solely on\n\narguments that this Court has already considered and rejected twice. I would affirm the\n\ncircuit court, which dutifully followed this Court's prior decisions in Hansome and\n\nCrabtree.\n\n       Section 287.780, RSMo 2000, permits an employee to bring a civil action against\n\nhis or her employer for discharging the employee in retaliation for seeking workers'\n\ncompensation benefits. In Hansome, this Court held that, for a workers' compensation\n\nretaliation claim against the employer pursuant to § 287.780, the employee must prove\n\nthat his or her action in seeking workers' compensation benefits was the \"exclusive\n\ncause\" of termination. 679 S.W.2d at 275, 277 n.2.\n\n       Fourteen years later, this Court reaffirmed that interpretation of § 287.780.\n\nCrabtree, 967 S.W.2d at 71. In Crabtree, this Court endorsed the exclusive cause\n\nstandard of Hansome because any other rule \"would encourage marginally competent\n\nemployees to file the most petty [sic] claims in order to enjoy the benefits of heightened\n\njob security.\" Id. The Court rejected the plaintiff's argument to give a more expansive\n\nconstruction to § 287.780 than that adopted in Hansome due, in part, to the absence of\n\nany intervening legislative action. Id. On the questions of stare decisis, this Court stated:\n\n\"[T]his Court should not lightly disturb its own precedent. Mere disagreement by the\n\ncurrent Court with the statutory analysis of a predecessor Court is not a satisfactory\n\nbasis for violating the doctrine of stare decisis, at least in the absence of a recurring\n\ninjustice or absurd results.\" Id. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       Other than 16 years and the changing membership of this Court, nothing has\n\nchanged that can explain why there is a legal need to change the standard of causation\n\nrequired by § 287.780.1        The statutory language never provided, and still does not\n\nprovide, a causation standard. This Court was originally forced to construe the statute in\n\nHansome and provide a standard for the element of causation. This Court in Crabtree\n\nand Hansome declared that \"exclusive cause\" was the law. Now this Court declares\n\n\"contributing factor\" is the law. The doctrine of stare decisis would have little practical\n\nor intellectual value if all it took to change the law was the passage of time and Court\n\nmembership. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it most succinctly, \"[E]stablishing that a\n\ndecision was wrong does not, without more, justify overruling it.\" Alleyne v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"903985\"><a href=\"/opinion/903985/alleyne-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Justice Louis Brandeis said it well in 1932:\n\n       Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more\n       important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled\n       right. This is commonly true even when the error is a matter of serious\n       concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. But in cases\n       involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative\n       action is practically impossible, this court has often overruled its earlier\n       decisions. . . . In cases involving the Federal Constitution the position of\n       this court is unlike that of the highest court of England, where the policy of\n       stare decisis was formulated and is strictly applied to all classes of cases.\n\n 1\n    The principal opinion concludes that it is appropriate for this Court to reexamine the law\nbecause the legislature since has enacted the MHRA, which created private causes of action for\nspecific categories of discrimination not related to filing a workers' compensation claim. This\nrationale seems misplaced in light of the fact that the legislature is presumed to have adopted this\nCourt's prior interpretation of § 287.780 if it does not take any action, particularly in the context\nof enacting workers' compensation legislation modifying causation standards without changing\nthis Court's prior construction of § 287.780, as explained infra.\n\n                                                 3\n\f       Parliament is free to correct any judicial error; and the remedy may be\n       promptly invoked.\n\nBurnet v.

Constitutional\nreinterpretation is not disfavored to the extent statutory reinterpretation is disfavored because it is\nmore problematic to infer that the People have approved or ratified a prior constitutional\ninterpretation without explicit amendment, as compared to legislation, which is relatively easier\nto enact.\n  Although the People may amend the Constitution to overrule or approve of a constitutional\ninterpretation, this kind of amendment has been rare and is difficult to achieve.

Id.; slip op. at 12. What the majority fails to acknowledge is that\n\n\n                                            6\n\fthe common law is the exclusive prerogative of the judiciary, for which this Court is the\n\nultimate authority. 4 Although this Court has adopted the contributing factor causation\n\nstandard for retaliation claims under the MHRA, as the principal opinion notes, this Court\n\nin Hill v. Ford Motor Co. merely reaffirmed its interpretation of the MHRA. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1767797\"><a href=\"/opinion/1767797/hill-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 665 (Mo. banc 2009) (reaffirming Daugherty v.

They were interpretations\n\nof a Missouri statute, on which the General Assembly is presumed to rely, and to which\n\nthis Court should give the greatest stare decisis effect. State ex rel. Howard Elec. Co-op.,\n\n490 S.W.2d at 9.\n\n       The principal opinion states that this Court did not \"analyze or interpret the\n\nwording of section 287.780\" in Hansome. Slip op. at 10. This Court in Hansome quoted\n\n§ 287.780, then stated the four elements necessary to make a claim. 679 S.W.2d at 275-\n\n76. It did cite Davis and Mitchell as precedent for all four elements, but then analyzed\n\nthose cases and another court of appeals case regarding the element of causation. Id. at\n\n 4\n     Because stare decisis is at its strongest in cases involving statutory interpretation, it\nnecessarily is at its weakest in cases involving common law doctrines. Although the rule of law\nstill demands that this Court not lightly overrule its prior common law decisions (because it is\nimperative to retain them in the interests of reliance, predictability, and stability), this Court is\nthe ultimate authority on questions of Missouri common law. In deciding whether to overrule\nprior decisions based solely on common law doctrine, this Court does not face the same\nseparation of powers concerns it faces in deciding whether to overrule prior interpretations of\nstatutes and, to a lesser degree, the United States and Missouri constitutions.\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\f275-76 & n.2. This Court recognized that the text of § 287.780 did not provide a specific\n\ncausation standard.    Then, this Court's opinion analyzed how enacting § 287.780\n\nnecessarily modified the at-will employment doctrine and how that justified the holdings\n\nof the prior court of appeals decisions construing § 287.780 to require the filing of a\n\nworkers' compensation claim to be the exclusive cause for the termination. Id. at 275 n.2.\n\nWhile reasonable minds may differ in hindsight as to whether that construction was\n\ncorrect, there is no doubt that this Court was required to, and did, construe § 287.780 in\n\nHansome.\n\n       The presumption of legislative reliance on Hansome and Crabtree has even\n\ngreater weight here because the General Assembly overhauled the workers' compensation\n\nlaw in 2005. Not only did it expressly abrogate other prior cases of this Court and the\n\ncourt of appeals by name and citation, see, e.g., Drewes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2387638\"><a href=\"/opinion/2387638/drewes-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514-15 (Mo. banc 1999); Kasl v.

The General Assembly thereby demonstrated its intent to retain the\n\nexclusive cause standard for workers' compensation retaliation claims. 5\n\n\n 5\n   In 2005, the General Assembly repealed 35 sections of the revised statutes of Missouri and\nenacted 40 new sections \"relating to workers' compensation law.\" Act of Mar. 30, 2005, S.B. 1\n& 130, 2005 Mo. Laws 907, 907 (codified as amended at chapters 286 and 287, RSMo Supp.\n2013). This Court and the court of appeals had previously held that, to obtain a workers'\ncompensation award for accidental injury, an employer need only show that the employee's work\nwas a \"substantial factor\" in the cause of the injury. Drewes, 984 S.W.2d at 514-15; Kasl, 984\n\n                                              8\n\f       Contrary to the suggestion in the principal opinion, the 2005 amendments discredit\n\nthe attempt to characterize this case as merely involving \"legislative inaction.\" The\n\nGeneral Assembly took affirmative steps that demonstrate its intent to retain the\n\nexclusive cause standard. It enacted a new causation standard for determining workers'\n\ncompensation coverage of accidental injuries by expressly abrogating two of this Court's\n\nprior decisions by name. It could have enacted a new causation standard for workers'\n\ncompensation retaliation cases by abrogating Hansome and Crabtree.                It did not.\n\nAccordingly, the principal opinion's failure to adhere to this Court's prior interpretation of\n\n§ 287.780 offends the separation of powers by encroaching on the General Assembly's\n\nratification of the exclusive cause standard. Even if the \"contributing factor\" standard is\n\nthe better rule, this Court should not usurp the legislative function by re-deciding settled\n\nquestions of statutory construction due solely to a change of heart.\n\n       Finally, it should be noted that the principal opinion assumes that, if the legislature\n\ndislikes this Court's decision to change the law from \"exclusive cause\" to \"contributing\n\nfactor,\" the General Assembly is free to abrogate this holding by passing a bill to\n\nreinstate the exclusive cause standard.        Once this Court puts this burden on the\n\nlegislature, however, there is no reason why the General Assembly could not go the next\n\nstep and repeal § 287.780 to eliminate the private cause of action entirely. Rather than\n\n\n\n\nS.W.2d at 853-54; Bennett, 80 S.W.3d at 531-32. The General Assembly expressly abrogated\nthose three decisions and replaced the \"substantial factor\" causation test with the \"prevailing\nfactor\" causation test. 2005 Mo. Laws at 910-11 (codified at §§ 287.020(3)(1), 287.020(10),\nRSMo Supp. 2013).\n\n                                              9\n\frisk watching such a debate, I would adhere to the principle of stare decisis, reaffirm this\n\nCourt's holdings in Hansome and Crabtree, and affirm the circuit court's judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                 ___________________________\n                                                 Zel M.
