We will\n\naffirm.\n\n          Kohler commenced the action in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania while\n\nincarcerated at the York County Prison, although he has since been released.1 He alleged\n\nthat “over the past 13 years [he had] been set-up to lose credibility. People have used\n\ntheir professional power and abused it by doing whatever they want with me. . . . All\n\nbecause of my [mental health] diagnosis.” Compl. 3, ECF No. 6. Kohler disclaimed any\n\nphysical injury, but emphasized the psychic and emotional toll caused by this alleged\n\nabuse. Compl. 3. He requested relief in the form of “release from prison . . . money\n\ncompensation, plus investigations done.” Compl. 5. Elsewhere, Kohler complained of\n\ndiscrimination by a counselor at the York County Prison, charged an unspecified “they”\n\n          1\n         We are uncertain whether venue was proper in the Eastern District, given the\nYork-County-centric nature of both the defendants and claims. See 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).\nWhether venue was proper below does not affect the exercise of federal subject-matter\njurisdiction. See Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Schmidt, 546 U.S. 303, 316 (2006); Polizzi v.\nCowles Magazines, Inc., 345 U.S. 663, 665 (1953); see also Khouzam v. Att‟y Gen., 549\nF.3d 235, 249 (3d Cir. 2008) (in immigration context, section 1252(b)(2) is a non-\njurisdictional venue provision); United States v. Gallagher, 183 F.2d 342, 346 (3d Cir.\n1950) (criminal venue provision, like other venue statutes, is waivable).\n\n\n                                               2\n\fwith “stall[ing his] legal fight,” and accused the judge who oversaw his case of trying to\n\n“make [him] lose credibility, which is defamation of character.” See “Notice of Intent,”\n\nECF No. 4.\n\n       The District Court warned Kohler that his complaint, in its current form, failed to\n\nstate a claim for relief, and granted him leave to amend. See 12/17/2010 Order 7, ECF\n\nNo. 5. In response, Kohler filed a handwritten “Amendment,” in which he claimed to\n\nhave “already written a 100-page-plus” complaint that he had submitted as part of his\n\nYork County criminal case.2 He expounded further upon the discrimination he felt he\n\nhad suffered, alleging that “Dr. Super and Wendy Parg” lied in a hearing, that the judge\n\nin his criminal case called him a “crack head,” and that guards at the prison yelled at him\n\nand said he had “no credibility.” More significantly, he claimed to have been kept in a\n\nsegregation cell in less-than-ideal conditions and was forcibly injected with medicine that\n\nleft his “body . . . shaking the rest of the day and they left me in my cell to suffer.” See\n\ngenerally Amendment, ECF No. 7.\n\n       Finding that Kohler‟s amendment did not state a claim, the District Court sua\n\nsponte dismissed the complaint. It observed that most of the actors he referenced by\n\nname in the bodies of his original complaint and its amendment were not, in fact, parties\n\nto the suit, and that his filings failed to provide notice as required by Federal Rule of\n\n       2\n        The docket for the case number Kohler provides, CP-67-CR-0003429-2009, does\nnot reveal any submission matching the one described. Our attempts to track down this\ndocument were for naught. As it is not before us – and as it was not before the District\nCourt – it does not factor in our decision today.\n\n\n                                              3\n\fCivil Procedure 8(a). The District Court also discussed the vague and unspecific nature\n\nof his claims, and identified several defendants who could not, as per this Circuit‟s\n\nprecedent, be proper parties to the suit. Finally, it concluded that, having granted leave to\n\namend once, further amendment would be futile. See generally 1/28/2011 Order, ECF\n\nNo. 8.\n\n         We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. While the District Court did not\n\nspecify in its order whether it was dismissing under Rule 8(a) or under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915(e)(2) for failure to state a claim, the totality of the memorandum suggests an\n\nintent to rule pursuant to the latter3; accordingly, we conduct plenary review of the\n\nDistrict Court‟s decision, accepting as true the allegations of fact established in the\n\ncomplaint along with reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. Allah v. Seiverling, 229\n\nF.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir. 2000). If no substantial question is presented by the instant\n\nappeal, we may summarily affirm on any ground supported by the record. See Third\n\nCircuit LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6; United States v. Rhines, ___ F.3d ___, slip op. at 3 (3d\n\nCir. Apr. 4, 2011, No. 10-4077).\n\n         Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983, under which this complaint arises, creates a federal cause\n\nof action for “the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\n\nConstitution and laws” by persons acting under color of state law. See also Revell v. Port\n\nAuth. of N.Y. and N.J., 598 F.3d 128, 134 (3d Cir. 2010). As it is well established that\n\n         3\n        See, e.g., 1/28/2011 Order ¶¶ a (citing § 1915), o & n.4 (closing case and\ndeclining to grant leave to amend).\n\n\n                                              4\n\f§ 1983 complaints “need only satisfy the notice pleading standard of Rule 8(a),” Thomas\n\nv. Independence Twp., 463 F.3d 285, 295 (3d Cir. 2006), it follows that such a complaint\n\nmust, at the very least, put the defendants on notice of the character of the constitutional\n\nwrong alleged. However, a plaintiff must plead more than mere labels and conclusions,\n\nand a complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to „state a claim\n\nto relief that is plausible on its face.‟” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S. Ct. 1937,\n\n1939 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). “In other\n\nwords, a complaint must do more than allege the plaintiff's entitlement to relief. A\n\ncomplaint has to „show‟ such an entitlement with its facts.” Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside,\n\n578 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir. 2009); see also W. Penn Allegheny Health Sys. v. UPMC, 627\n\nF.3d 85, 98 (3d Cir. 2010) (“In determining whether a complaint is sufficient, courts\n\nshould disregard the complaint‟s legal conclusions and determine whether the remaining\n\nfactual allegations suggest that the plaintiff has a plausible – as opposed to merely\n\nconceivable – claim for relief.”).\n\n       We agree with the District Court that the complaint failed to state a claim for\n\nrelief. First, several of the wrongs alleged by Kohler are not constitutional in nature; for\n\nexample, “defamation of character” is “actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 only if it\n\noccurs in the course of or is accompanied by a change or extinguishment of a right or\n\nstatus guaranteed by state law or the Constitution.” Clark v. Falls, 890 F.2d 611, 619 (3d\n\nCir. 1989) (citing Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 701–12 (1976)); see also Sturm v. Clark,\n\n835 F.2d 1009, 1012 (3d Cir. 1987) (“Absent the alteration or extinguishment of a more\n\n                                              5\n\ftangible interest, injury to reputation is actionable only under state defamation law.”).\n\nThe comments to which Kohler referred do not implicate an alteration of a more tangible\n\ninterest. Furthermore, without an underlying constitutional violation, Kohler cannot\n\nmake out an emotional distress case under § 1983. See Spence v. Bd. of Educ. of the\n\nChristina Sch. Dist., 806 F.2d 1198, 1203 (3d Cir. 1986). When Kohler does describe a\n\npossible facial violation of his constitutional rights, such as questionable prison\n\nconditions or the alleged forcible administration of psychiatric drugs, he fails to connect\n\nthe named defendants4 to those violations – or even to situate the violations concretely in\n\ntime. See Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988) (“A defendant in a\n\ncivil rights action must have personal involvement in the alleged wrongs; liability cannot\n\nbe predicated solely on the operation of respondeat superior.”). Other claims, such as\n\nintimations that he was singled out for this discriminatory treatment, are too undeveloped\n\nto be considered as more than the conclusory allegations disfavored by Iqbal.\n\n       Finally, to the extent that Kohler requested release from prison or attempted to\n\notherwise contest the validity of his conviction or sentence, his claim would have been\n\n       4\n         On appeal, Kohler asks this Court to “drop” several of the defendants from the\naction. We appreciate his desire for parsimony, but the request serves to emphasize the\noverbroad nature of the original complaint. For instance, he requests the dismissal of\ndefendant Judy Shultz, as his dispute with Ms. Shultz “was more landlord-tenant [related]\nthan civil[-rights] related.” He also apparently sued several of his family members whom\nhe now wishes to dismiss “even though they violated [his] rights” – although he still\n“want[s] to question” several of them. We cannot see how his grievances against these\nvaried and disparate defendants were part of the same transaction or occurrence, or series\nthereof. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(2); see also DirecTV, Inc. v. Leto, 467 F.3d 842, 844\n(3d Cir. 2006).\n\n\n                                              6\n\fproperly brought only as a petition for writ of habeas corpus. See Preiser v. Rodriguez,\n\n411 U.S. 475, 500 (1973); Williams v. Consovoy, 453 F.3d 173, 177 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\nAttempts to proceed under § 1983 would be otherwise barred by the “favorable\n\ntermination rule” of Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), which requires “a § 1983\n\nplaintiff [to] prove that [his] conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,\n\nexpunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such\n\ndetermination, or called into question by a federal court‟s issuance of a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus” in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or\n\nimprisonment. Id. at 486–87. The favorable termination rule applies even to those\n\nprisoners who, like Kohler, may no longer be in custody. Williams, 453 F.3d at 177–78.\n\n       As a pro se plaintiff, Kohler is and was entitled to liberal construction of his\n\ncomplaint. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam). Moreover, we are\n\nsensitive to the likelihood that Kohler‟s mental illness – which he declines to specifically\n\ndisclose, but which is undoubtedly an issue in many of the events in his complaint – may\n\nimpede his ability to craft a coherent pleading. But in a desire to effect justice by\n\naffording an uncounseled plaintiff leeway in pleading his case, a court must be mindful to\n\nwork with what the complaint reasonably provides; it cannot stretch the obligation of\n\nlenience to its breaking point. Cf. Capogrosso v. Sup. Ct. of N.J., 588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d\n\nCir. 2009) (per curiam) (inferences drawn in plaintiff‟s favor must be reasonable); Smith-\n\nBey v. Hosp. Adm‟r, 841 F.2d 751, 758 (7th Cir. 1988) (“Although a district court must\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fgive such pleadings a liberal construction, this does not mean that the district court must\n\ninvent factual scenarios that cannot be reasonably inferred from the pleadings.”).\n\n       Having reviewed Kohler‟s complaint and its amendment, we agree with the\n\nDistrict Court that it does not state a valid constitutional claim in its present form. Hence,\n\nas no substantial issue is presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the District\n\nCourt‟s judgment. Kohler‟s motion for appointment of counsel is denied; his motion to\n\ndismiss individual parties is denied as unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f",

See 12/17/2010 Order 7, ECF\n\nNo. 5. In response, Kohler filed a handwritten “Amendment,” in which he claimed to\n\nhave “already written a 100-page-plus” complaint that he had submitted as part of his\n\nYork County criminal case.2 He expounded further upon the discrimination he felt he\n\nhad suffered, alleging that “Dr. Super and Wendy Parg” lied in a hearing, that the judge\n\nin his criminal case called him a “crack head,” and that guards at the prison yelled at him\n\nand said he had “no credibility.” More significantly, he claimed to have been kept in a\n\nsegregation cell in less-than-ideal conditions and was forcibly injected with medicine that\n\nleft his “body . . . shaking the rest of the day and they left me in my cell to suffer.” See\n\ngenerally Amendment, ECF No. 7.\n\n       Finding that Kohler‟s amendment did not state a claim, the District Court sua\n\nsponte dismissed the complaint. It observed that most of the actors he referenced by\n\nname in the bodies of his original complaint and its amendment were not, in fact, parties\n\nto the suit, and that his filings failed to provide notice as required by Federal Rule of\n\n       2\n        The docket for the case number Kohler provides, CP-67-CR-0003429-2009, does\nnot reveal any submission matching the one described. Our attempts to track down this\ndocument were for naught. As it is not before us – and as it was not before the District\nCourt – it does not factor in our decision today.\n\n\n                                              3\n\fCivil Procedure 8(a). The District Court also discussed the vague and unspecific nature\n\nof his claims, and identified several defendants who could not, as per this Circuit‟s\n\nprecedent, be proper parties to the suit. Finally, it concluded that, having granted leave to\n\namend once, further amendment would be futile. See generally 1/28/2011 Order, ECF\n\nNo. 8.\n\n         We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. While the District Court did not\n\nspecify in its order whether it was dismissing under Rule 8(a) or under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915(e)(2) for failure to state a claim, the totality of the memorandum suggests an\n\nintent to rule pursuant to the latter3; accordingly, we conduct plenary review of the\n\nDistrict Court‟s decision, accepting as true the allegations of fact established in the\n\ncomplaint along with reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.

First, several of the wrongs alleged by Kohler are not constitutional in nature; for\n\nexample, “defamation of character” is “actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 only if it\n\noccurs in the course of or is accompanied by a change or extinguishment of a right or\n\nstatus guaranteed by state law or the Constitution.” Clark v.

Furthermore, without an underlying constitutional violation, Kohler cannot\n\nmake out an emotional distress case under § 1983. See Spence v. Bd. of Educ. of the\n\nChristina Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480355\"><a href=\"/opinion/480355/catherine-l-spence-v-board-of-education-of-the-christina-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1203 (3d Cir. 1986). When Kohler does describe a\n\npossible facial violation of his constitutional rights, such as questionable prison\n\nconditions or the alleged forcible administration of psychiatric drugs, he fails to connect\n\nthe named defendants4 to those violations – or even to situate the violations concretely in\n\ntime. See Rode v. Dellarciprete, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505504\"><a href=\"/opinion/505504/vivian-m-rode-and-jay-c-hileman-v-nicholas-g-dellarciprete-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988) (“A defendant in a\n\ncivil rights action must have personal involvement in the alleged wrongs; liability cannot\n\nbe predicated solely on the operation of respondeat superior.”). Other claims, such as\n\nintimations that he was singled out for this discriminatory treatment, are too undeveloped\n\nto be considered as more than the conclusory allegations disfavored by Iqbal.\n\n       Finally, to the extent that Kohler requested release from prison or attempted to\n\notherwise contest the validity of his conviction or sentence, his claim would have been\n\n       4\n         On appeal, Kohler asks this Court to “drop” several of the defendants from the\naction. We appreciate his desire for parsimony, but the request serves to emphasize the\noverbroad nature of the original complaint. For instance, he requests the dismissal of\ndefendant Judy Shultz, as his dispute with Ms. Shultz “was more landlord-tenant [related]\nthan civil[-rights] related.” He also apparently sued several of his family members whom\nhe now wishes to dismiss “even though they violated [his] rights” – although he still\n“want[s] to question” several of them. We cannot see how his grievances against these\nvaried and disparate defendants were part of the same transaction or occurrence, or series\nthereof. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(2); see also DirecTV, Inc. v.

Id. at 486–87. The favorable termination rule applies even to those\n\nprisoners who, like Kohler, may no longer be in custody. Williams, 453 F.3d at 177–78.\n\n       As a pro se plaintiff, Kohler is and was entitled to liberal construction of his\n\ncomplaint. Erickson v. Pardus, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145722\"><a href=\"/opinion/145722/erickson-v-pardus/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94 (2007) (per curiam). Moreover, we are\n\nsensitive to the likelihood that Kohler‟s mental illness – which he declines to specifically\n\ndisclose, but which is undoubtedly an issue in many of the events in his complaint – may\n\nimpede his ability to craft a coherent pleading. But in a desire to effect justice by\n\naffording an uncounseled plaintiff leeway in pleading his case, a court must be mindful to\n\nwork with what the complaint reasonably provides; it cannot stretch the obligation of\n\nlenience to its breaking point.
