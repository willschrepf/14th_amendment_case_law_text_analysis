The decree ordered the Warden to implement various changes in classification procedures and daily routines in San Quentin's North Segregation unit.  The decree set forth minimum requirements for housing and treatment of condemned inmates.  The decree also specified various types of personal property and clothing to be made available to these inmates and set guidelines for food service and visitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since entry of the consent decree, the inmates have filed four motions to hold the Warden in contempt.  All contempt motions but the last were subsequently withdrawn, after the Warden gave assurances of future compliance with the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, a provision in the consent decree stated that in the event of a dispute over compliance with the decree, the court could establish procedures for the resolution of any such disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>[I]n the event of a dispute, ... with respect to whether the terms of this decree have been reasonably complied with, any party may present such dispute to this Court which will then establish procedures for the resolution of such dispute and may thereafter issue such orders as it deems necessary to assure compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consent Decree of Oct. 23, 1980 at 2 (N.D.Cal.1980) (No. 79-1630).  Referring to this provision, the inmates filed a motion in district court on January 11, 1985 requesting appointment of a special master pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 53<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> to assure compliance with the decree.  Defendants objected.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering written and oral arguments from both sides, the district court found that \"exceptional conditions\" warranted the appointment of a special master.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a>   Accordingly, on March 25, 1985, Judge Weigel entered an order appointing Robert R. Riggs as \"Monitor,\" and filed an accompanying Order of Reference, detailing the Monitor's responsibilities, authority and compensation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Warden appealed the appointing order and this motions panel was presented with the narrow task of considering whether the court of appeals has jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of whether a district court's order appointing a special master to supervise compliance with a consent decree is immediately appealable presents a question of first impression in this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court of appeals does not ordinarily have jurisdiction over appeals from interlocutory decisions.  However, appellate jurisdiction exists for:  Interlocutory orders of the district courts ... or of the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions,....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must first consider whether the consent decree before us is equivalent to an injunction.  Injunctions are \"orders that are directed to a party, enforceable by contempt, and designed to accord or protect 'some or all of the substantive relief sought by a complaint' in more than preliminary fashion.\"    16 C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper and E. Gressman, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction Sec. 3922, at 29 (1977) (quoting International Products Corp. v. Koons, 325 F.2d 403, 406 (2d Cir.1963)).   Accord Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 762 F.2d 158, 160 (1st Cir.1985);  United States v. Western Electric Company, 777 F.2d 23, 28 n. 12 (D.C.Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the consent decree prescribes conduct for the California Department of Corrections and compels compliance.  Indeed, an inmates' motion for a contempt order for the Warden's alleged partial non-compliance with the decree is pending in the district court.  Accordingly, we conclude that the consent decree is \"sufficiently injunctive in nature\" to be treated as an \"injunction\" under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1).   See Smith v. Eggar, 655 F.2d 181, 184 (9th Cir.1981) (order enforcing an agreement of security).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must next consider whether, under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1), the interlocutory order appointing the Monitor is an order \"granting, modifying, refusing, or dissolving\" the consent decree.   Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996-97, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), set out a three-part test to apply in determining whether an appeal falls under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1):  (1) does the order have the practical effect of the grant or denial of an injunction;  (2) does the order have serious, perhaps irreparable consequences;  and (3) is the order one that can be effectively challenged only by immediate appeal?    The Ninth Circuit adopted this test in EEOC v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., 796 F.2d 314, 316-17 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary W. v. Louisiana, 601 F.2d 240 (5th Cir.1979), examined the State of Louisiana's compliance with a 1976 injunctive court order protecting the rights of mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed, and other handicapped children.  Id. at 242.  In 1978 the district court appointed a special master to monitor compliance with the 1976 order;  on appeal, the Fifth Circuit held that the interlocutory appointment of a special master was a modification of an injunction under section 1292(a)(1) and therefore appealable.  Id. at 243.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Fifth Circuit to the extent that jurisdictional analysis under section 1292(a)(1) should focus on whether the interlocutory order appointing a special master \"modifies\" the consent decree.  The inmates, however, argue that Gary W. is distinguishable and not controlling here.  In Gary W. the district court had previously been requested to appoint a special master as part of the injunction and refused to do so.  Id.  Here, neither side raised the issue of a special master in shaping the consent decree.  We find the decree implicitly contemplates appointment of a master by retaining authority to \"establish procedures\" for its compliance.  Therefore, unlike Gary W., appointment of the Monitor here is pursuant to, and not a modification of, the original consent decree.  The appointing order appealed from does not have the practical effect of the grant or denial of an injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carson also requires a showing of serious and irreparable harm from the interlocutory order and a showing of no other opportunity for its effective appeal.  Here, the Warden made no showing of serious or irreparable harm from the interim appointment of a master.  In addition, the Warden has not shown that the appointment of a special master cannot be effectively reviewed when the district court decides whether to adopt the Monitor's recommendations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the congressional policy against piecemeal appeals is best served by deferring review.   Switzerland Cheese Association v. E. Horne's Market, 385 U.S. 23, 25, 87 S.Ct. 193, 195, 17 L.Ed.2d 23 (1966).  Appointment of the Monitor facilitates pretrial procedure and our review of the matter at this time would be premature.

The decree ordered the Warden to implement various changes in classification procedures and daily routines in San Quentin's North Segregation unit.  The decree set forth minimum requirements for housing and treatment of condemned inmates.

Indeed, an inmates' motion for a contempt order for the Warden's alleged partial non-compliance with the decree is pending in the district court.  Accordingly, we conclude that the consent decree is \"sufficiently injunctive in nature\" to be treated as an \"injunction\" under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1).   See Smith v. Eggar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392761\"><a href=\"/opinion/392761/c-arnholt-smith-british-columbia-investment-company-and-westward-realty/\"><span class=\"volume\">655</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span>, 184 (9th Cir.1981) (order enforcing an agreement of security).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must next consider whether, under 28 U.S.C.

Sec. 1292(a)(1):  (1) does the order have the practical effect of the grant or denial of an injunction;  (2) does the order have serious, perhaps irreparable consequences;  and (3) is the order one that can be effectively challenged only by immediate appeal?    The Ninth Circuit adopted this test in EEOC v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"473750\"><a href=\"/opinion/473750/41-fair-emplpraccas-769-41-empl-prac-dec-p-36488-equal-employment/\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 316-17 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gary W. v.

Id. at 242.  In 1978 the district court appointed a special master to monitor compliance with the 1976 order;  on appeal, the Fifth Circuit held that the interlocutory appointment of a special master was a modification of an injunction under section 1292(a)(1) and therefore appealable.  Id. at 243.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Fifth Circuit to the extent that jurisdictional analysis under section 1292(a)(1) should focus on whether the interlocutory order appointing a special master \"modifies\" the consent decree.  The inmates, however, argue that Gary W. is distinguishable and not controlling here.  In Gary W. the district court had previously been requested to appoint a special master as part of the injunction and refused to do so.  Id.  Here, neither side raised the issue of a special master in shaping the consent decree.  We find the decree implicitly contemplates appointment of a master by retaining authority to \"establish procedures\" for its compliance.  Therefore, unlike Gary W., appointment of the Monitor here is pursuant to, and not a modification of, the original consent decree.  The appointing order appealed from does not have the practical effect of the grant or denial of an injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carson also requires a showing of serious and irreparable harm from the interlocutory order and a showing of no other opportunity for its effective appeal.  Here, the Warden made no showing of serious or irreparable harm from the interim appointment of a master.  In addition, the Warden has not shown that the appointment of a special master cannot be effectively reviewed when the district court decides whether to adopt the Monitor's recommendations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the congressional policy against piecemeal appeals is best served by deferring review.
