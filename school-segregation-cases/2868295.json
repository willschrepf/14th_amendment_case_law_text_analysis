In particular, he claims that the Commission's\nconclusion that he was affiliated with an organized crime\nfamily was not supported by any evidence, and that an\norganized crime affiliation is not enough, in itself, to deny\nparole. Gambino filed a writ of habeas corpus, which the\ndistrict court denied. Because we find that the United\nStates Parole Commission abused its discretion, we will\nreverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n\nI.\n\nErasmo Gambino is currently incarcerated at the Federal\nCorrectional Institution at Fairton, New Jersey. In 1984, he\nwas convicted of conspiracy to distribute heroin; two counts\nof possession of heroin with intent to distribute; and two\ncounts of distribution of heroin, all in violation of 21 U.S.C.\nSS 841(a)(1) and (b)(1). Gambino was also convicted of use\nof a telephone in a conspiracy to distribute and possess\nheroin, a felony under 21 U.S.C. S 846, in violation of 21\nU.S.C. SS 843(b) and (c). On December 6, 1984, he was\nsentenced to a 34-year term of imprisonment and a\n$95,000 fine.\n\nPrior to the verdict, Gambino was cited for attempted\nescape from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New\nYork City. He was later found guilty and given a 30-day\ndisciplinary segregation as punishment.\n\nAll of these offenses occurred between December 1983\nand March 1984, before the enactment of the Sentencing\n\n                                 2\n\fReform Act of 1984 (\"SRA\"), Pub. L. No. 98-473, Title II,\nOct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 1987. The SRA abolished parole,\nsee SRA S 218(a)(5), 98 Stat. 2027, 2031, but only for\noffenses committed after November 1, 1987. See Sentencing\nReform Amendment Act of 1985, Pub. L. No. 99-217, S 4,\nDec. 26, 1985, 99 Stat. 1728.1 Thus, Gambino was entitled\nto a parole hearing.\n\nOn April 20, 1994, the United States Parole Commission\nconducted a parole hearing and Gambino was denied\nrelease.2 The Hearing Panel assigned Gambino a Category\nSix Offense Severity Rating because he had been convicted\nof conspiracy to distribute more than 50 but less than 999\ngrams of pure heroin. See U.S. Parole Commission Offense\nBehavior Severity Index, Chapter Nine, Subchapter A,\nP 901(d), 28 C.F.R. S 2.20 (1995).3 The Panel assessed his\nsalient factor score as 10 out of 10, with 10 representing\nthe lowest risk of parole violation. See id. (Salient Factor\nScoring Manual). The parole guidelines for a prisoner with\na salient score of 10 and a Category Six offense severity\nrating indicate a term of incarceration of 40 to 52 months.\nSee 28 C.F.R. S 2.20(b). The Panel assessed an additional 8\nto 16 months for Gambino's attempted escape from secure\ncustody.4 The resulting aggregate guideline range was 48 to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The parole enabling statutes, 18 U.S.C. SS 4201 to 4218 (1997), were\nrepealed pursuant to Pub. L. 98-473, Title II, S 218(a)(5), Oct. 12, 1984,\n98 Stat. 2027. Nonetheless, these statutes remain in effect for ten years\nafter Nov. 1, 1987. Pub. L. 101-650, Title III,S 316, Dec. 1, 1990, 104\nStat. 5115. For the sake of brevity, the subsequent history of the parole\nstatutes will be hereafter omitted.\n\n2. To avoid later confusion when citing early cases regarding parole, we\nnote that the Parole Commission is the successor to the Parole Board.\nCampbell v. United States Parole Commission, 704 F.2d 106, 111 (3d Cir.\n1983); Pub. L. No. 94-233, S 2, Mar. 15, 1996, 90 Stat. 219.\n\n3. The Commission does not indicate which edition of its regulations it\nrelied upon, although it is clearly a recent one. The district court\nrelied\non the 1995 edition, as do we.\n\n4. The Commission's Notices of Action do not indicate under which\nprovision this penalty was assessed. The district court stated that it was\nassessed pursuant to 28 C.F.R. S 2.36(a)(23)(1)(A). There is no such\nsection, but it appears that the district court intended to indicate 28\nC.F.R. S 2.36(a)(2)(i)(A). However, on its face, this section does not\napply\n\n                               3\n\f68 months.5 However, 18 U.S.C. S 4205(a) (1997) requires\nthat Gambino remain incarcerated for at least 10 years\nprior to being eligible for parole.6 At the time of the April 20,\n1994 hearing, Gambino had served approximately 119\nmonths. Nevertheless, the Panel recommended that he\nremain incarcerated until the expiration of his sentence,\nsolely because Gambino has been identified as a member of\nan organized crime family.\n\nThe Panel also recommended that the case be referred for\n\"original jurisdiction.\"7 Government's Supplemental\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nto Gambino's attempted escape because it only applies \"to the\nsanctioning of disciplinary infractions or new criminal behavior\ncommitted by a prisoner subsequent to the commencement of his\nsentence.\" Id. S 2.36(a). Gambino attempted to escape prior to the verdict\nand thus prior to the commencement of his sentence. Moreover, he was\ngiven a 30-day disciplinary segregation for this offense after he was\nfound guilty.\n\nBecause Gambino has not raised this issue and because his\nmandatory minimum sentence exceeds the guideline range with or\nwithout the additional 8 to 16 months, we need not decide if this\nincrease in the guideline range was proper.\n\n5. The district court stated that the guideline range was 48 to 78\nmonths. This is incorrect and appears to be a typographical error.\nBecause both figures are below the applicable statutory mandatory\nminimum sentence, the disparity has no effect on our analysis.\n\n6. 18 U.S.C. S 4205(a) (1997) provides that \"[w]henever confined and\nserving a definite term or terms of more than one year, a prisoner shall\nbe eligible for release on parole after serving one-third of such term or\nterms or after serving ten years of a life sentence or of a sentence of\nover\nthirty years, except to the extent otherwise provided by law.\"\n\n7. The district court stated that this case was referred for \"original\njurisdiction\" consideration pursuant to 28 C.F.R.S 2.17. Gambino v.\nMorris, slip op. at 4, No. 95-CV 4559 (D.N.J. Apr. 11, 1996). However,\nthe Regional Commissioner's May 13, 1994 Notice of Action indicates\nthat the case was referred for further review pursuant to 28 C.F.R.\nS 2.24(a). S.A. at 17. Subsection 2.24(a), entitled \"Review of Panel\nRecommendations by the Regional Commissioner,\" provides that\n\n       [a] Regional Commissioner may review the recommendation of any\n       examiner panel and refer this recommendation, prior to written\n       notification to the prisoner with his recommendation and vote to\nthe\n\n                               4\n\fAppendix (\"S.A.\") at 16. On June 27, 1994, the Commission\nrendered an \"original jurisdiction\" decision by Notice of\nAction, determining that Gambino would serve until the\nexpiration of his sentence. Id. at 18. The Commission\ninformed Gambino that a decision to go outside the\nguidelines was warranted because Gambino was\n\n       a more serious risk than indicated by [his] salient\n       factor score in that [he has] been identified by the\n       government as a member of an organized crime family\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       National Commissioners for consideration and any action deemed\n       appropriate . . . . The Regional Commissioner and each National\n       Commissioner shall have one vote and decisions will be based upon\n       the concurrence of two votes.\n\n(Emphasis added.) The section entitled \"Original Jurisdiction cases\"\nprovides that\n\n       [f]ollowing any hearing conducted pursuant to these rules, a\n       Regional Commissioner may designate certain cases for decision by\n       a quorum of Commissioners as described below, as original\n       jurisdiction cases . . . . Decisions shall be based on the\nconcurrence\n       of three votes with the appropriate Regional Commissioner and each\n       National Commissioner having one vote.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 2.17(a) (emphasis added).\n\nThe National Commission stated in its Dec. 7, 1994 Notice of Action\nthat it had \"original jurisdiction\" pursuant to 28 C.F.R. SS 2.17(b)(2)\nand\n(b)(4). S.A. at 19. Not only is this inconsistent with the Regional\nCommissioner's Notice of Action, it is also facially incorrect. Subsection\n(b)(4) only applies to \"[p]risoners sentenced to a maximum term of forty\nfive years (or more) or prisoners serving life sentences.\" Because\nGambino is only serving a sentence of 34 years, this subsection does not\napply.\n\nSubsection (b)(2)(ii) would apply, however, if the case had been referred\npursuant to section 2.17. See 28 C.F.R. S 2.17(b)(2)(ii) (Regional\nCommissioner may designate a case as \"original jurisdiction\" when a\nprisoner's offense \"was part of a large-scale criminal conspiracy or a\ncontinuing criminal enterprise.\").\n\nNotwithstanding these procedural irregularities, we need not decide\nwhether Gambino was prejudiced by them because of the result we\nreach in this case. We note them only to ensure that they are not\nrepeated on remand.\n\n                               5\n\f       and as evidenced by the body of an execution murder\n       victim found in the trunk of [his] automobile on\n       November 15, 1982.\n\nId. The Notice of Action concluded that \"[a] decision above\nthe guidelines is mandated in that [Gambino has] a\nminimum sentence which exceeds the guideline range.\" Id.\nThe body referred to in the Notice of Action was that of\nPietro Inzerillo. Inzerillo was Gambino's cousin, and the two\nmen jointly owned a pizzeria. Gambino claims, and the\ngovernment does not dispute, that he was never a suspect\nin this slaying.\n\nGambino appealed to the Commission's National Appeals\nBoard, which affirmed the Commission's decision on\nDecember 7, 1994, by Notice of Action. Id. at 19. The\nAppeals Board stated that\n\n       [i]n response to [Gambino's] claim that the reasons\n       provided to exceed the guidelines are not a part of the\n       offense of conviction and therefore should not be relied\n       upon is without merit. The Commission may consider\n       available information to determine an appropriate\n       sanction for the total offense behavior. [His] claim that\n       the information used is flawed does not persuade the\n       Commission to change the decision.\n\nId.\n\nIn summary, the parole guidelines indicated that\nGambino should serve a term of 48 to 68 months. However,\nGambino was not eligible for parole until he served a\nminimum sentence of 120 months. He had a parole hearing\nafter serving approximately 120 months and was denied\nparole. The Commission requires that he serve until the\nexpiration of his 34-year sentence.\n\nIf Gambino remains a model prisoner, he will be released\nafter completing two-thirds of his sentence, a period of\napproximately 272 months. 18 U.S.C. S 4206(d) (1997).8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. 18 U.S.C. S 4206(d) (1997) provides:\n\n       Any prisoner serving a sentence of five years or longer, who is not\n       earlier released under this section or any other applicable\nprovision\n\n                               6\n\fHowever, if he seriously or frequently violates prison rules,\nhe will serve out his full term of 408 months. See id. These\ncalculations exclude any possible reduction for good time,\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. S 4161 et seq. (1997) (repealed by\nPub. L. 98-473, Title II, S 218(a), Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat.\n2027) (repeal effective Nov. 1, 1987, and applicable only to\noffenses committed after it took effect).\n\nGambino petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas\ncorpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 2241. The district court\ndenied the writ.\n\nThe district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nS 1331. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1291.\n\nII.\n\nOur role in reviewing decisions by the Parole Commission\non application for a writ of habeas corpus is limited. The\nappropriate standard of review of the Commission's findings\nof fact \"is not whether the [Commission's decision] is\nsupported by the preponderance of the evidence, or even by\nsubstantial evidence; the inquiry is only whether there is a\nrational basis in the record for the [Commission's]\nconclusions embodied in its statement of reasons.\" Zannino\nv. Arnold, 531 F.2d 687, 691 (3d Cir. 1976). See also 28\nC.F.R. S 2.18 (\"The granting of parole to an eligible prisoner\nrests in the discretion of the United States Parole\nCommission.\"). Moreover, we must ensure that the\nCommission \"has followed criteria appropriate, rational and\nconsistent\" with its enabling statutes and that its \"decision\nis not arbitrary and capricious, nor based on impermissible\nconsiderations.\" Id. at 690.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       of law, shall be released on parole after having served two-thirds\nof\n       each consecutive term or terms, or after serving thirty years of\neach\n       consecutive term or terms of more than forty-five years including\n       any life term, whichever is earlier. Provided, however, that the\n       Commission shall not release such prisoner if it determines that he\n       has seriously or frequently violated institution rules and\nregulations\n       or that there is a reasonable probability that he will commit any\n       Federal, State or local crime.\n\n(Emphasis in original.)\n\n                                7\n\fAlthough the Commission must, in the first instance, use\nthe parole guidelines in determining the release of a\nprisoner, 18 U.S.C. S 4206(a) (1997), it is not limited by\nthose regulations. 18 U.S.C. S 4206(c)(1997).9 The\nCommission is authorized to \"deny release on parole\nnotwithstanding the guidelines . . . if it determines there is\ngood cause for so doing . . . .\" Id. The legislative history of\nthat statute indicates the definition of good cause cannot be\nprecise \" `because [good cause] must be broad enough to\ncover many circumstances.' \" Iuteri v. Nardoza, 732 F.2d\n32, 36-37 (2d Cir. 1984) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 838, 94th\nCong., 2d Sess. 27, reprinted in 1976 U.S. Code Cong. &\nAdmin. News 335, 351, 359). Nonetheless, it is not so broad\nas to evade any definition. \"Good cause\" may include\nconsideration of such factors as whether \" `the prisoner was\ninvolved in an offense with an unusual degree of\nsophistication or planning or has a lengthy prior record, or\nwas part of a large scale conspiracy or continuing criminal\nenterprise.' \" Romano v. Baer, 805 F.2d 268, 270 (7th Cir.\n1986) (quoting H.R. Conf.Rep. No. 94-838, 94th Cong., 2d\nSess. 27, reprinted in 1976 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.\nNews 335, 351, 359). Moreover, \"good cause\" means\n\"substantial reason and includes only those grounds put\nforward by the Commission in good faith and which are not\narbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, irrelevant or capricious.\"\nHarris v. Martin, 792 F.2d 52, 55 (3d Cir. 1986) (citing H.R.\nConf.Rep. No. 94-838, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 27, reprinted in\n1976 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 335, 351, 359).\n\nIn reaching its decision to grant or deny parole, the\nCommission may consider a broad range of sources,\nincluding presentence investigation reports and \"such\nadditional relevant information concerning the prisoner . . .\nas may be reasonably available.\" 18 U.S.C. S 4207 (1997).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. 18 U.S.C. S 4206(a) (1997) provides that a prisoner may be released\n\"pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the Commission . . . .\"; see also\n28 C.F.R. S 2.20(b), (c) (\"These guidelines indicate the customary range\nof time to be served before release for various combinations of offense\n(severity) and offender (parole prognosis) characteristics . . . . These\ntime\nranges are merely guidelines. When the circumstances warrant,\ndecisions outside of the guidelines (either above or below) may be\nrendered.\").\n\n                               8\n\fThe Commission must resolve disputes with respect to\ninformation presented by \"a preponderance of the evidence\nstandard.\" 28 C.F.R. S 2.19(c).\n\nOn appeal, Gambino argues that: (1) none of the\ninformation relied upon by the Commission is rationally\nconnected to the Commission's finding that he was a\nmember of an organized crime family; and (2) there was not\n\"good cause\" to place his sentence outside the sentencing\nguidelines.10\n\nA.\n\nGambino contends that the Commission had no evidence\nbefore it which rationally connects him to the Gambino\nfamily of La Cosa Nostra. We may inquire as to \"whether\nthere is a rational basis in the record for the Board's\nconclusions embodied in its statement of reasons.\" Zannino\nv. Arnold, 531 F.2d 687, 691 (3d Cir. 1976); see United\nStates ex rel. Farese v. Luther, 953 F.2d 49, 53 (3d Cir.\n1992). While we may not weigh the evidence, we must be\ncertain that at least some of it is rationally connected to the\nCommission's finding.\n\nThe government argues that the Commission relied on\nfour facts that support its finding that Gambino is a\nmember of a crime family: (1) a Pennsylvania Crime\nCommission report indicating that Gambino is connected to\nthe Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra; (2) the discovery of\nInzerillo's body in the trunk of Gambino's car; (3) a New\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. At times, Gambino appears to be arguing that his due process rights\nunder the Fifth Amendment have been violated as well. Because of the\nresult that we reach here, we need not address this constitutional claim.\nSee Erie Telecommunications, Inc. v. City of Erie, Pa., 853 F.2d 1084,\n1093 (3d Cir. 1988) (\"a court faced with both constitutional and\nnonconstitutional claims must address the nonconstitutional claims\nfirst, if doing so will enable the court to avoid a constitutional\nconfrontation.\").\n\nGambino raised a number of additional arguments in his \"Pro Se Reply\nBrief.\" We will \"not consider arguments raised on appeal for the first\ntime in a reply brief.\" United States v. Boggi, 74 F.3d 470, 478 (3d Cir.\n1996).\n\n                                9\n\fJersey state police report identifying Gambino as a member\nof the Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra; and (4) a reliable,\nbut unnamed, informant who identified Gambino as a\nmember of the Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra.11\n\nThe government asserts that the Commission properly\nfound that the Pennsylvania Crime Commission Report was\nevidence that Erasmo Gambino was a member of the\nGambino family of La Cosa Nostra. But the Pennsylvania\nCrime Commission Report does not say what either the\ngovernment or the Commission suggest. The sole reference\nto Erasmo Gambino in the report states that he is married\nto the sister of Rosario Gambino (his cousin), who, the\nreport alleges, is a member of La Cosa Nostra.12 This\nattenuated familial tie does not, indeed cannot, in and of\nitself, provide a rational basis for finding that Gambino\nparticipated in organized crime. Thus, the Commission\nerred in concluding that this report stated that Gambino\nwas affiliated with La Cosa Nostra, and accordingly, it is an\ninvalid basis for the Commission's decision to deny parole.\nSee Campbell v. United States Parole Comm'n, 704 F.2d\n106, 109 (3d Cir. 1983) (\"[t]he Commission may not base its\njudgment as to parole on an inaccurate factual predicate.\").\n\nFor the government to assert that this reference\nconstitutes evidence proving that Gambino is a member of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. Gambino argues that the Panel only considered the Pennsylvania\nCrime Commission Report and the fact that Inzerillo's body was found in\nhis car. The Initial Hearing Summary does, in fact, only rely on those\ntwo items. Plaintiff 's Appendix (\"P.A.\") at 7. The Pre-Hearing Assessment\nrelies on those two items and one other for its conclusion. P.A. at 5. The\nAssessment mentions that the New Jersey State Police had identified\nGambino as a member of the Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra.\nHowever, nowhere does this Assessment explicitly mention that it relied\non information provided by an informant.\n\nBecause we find that the information provided by that informant is\nunreliable, we need not decide whether Gambino was further prejudiced\nby the failure to mention the reliance on the informant before and during\nthe parole hearing. See Misasi v. United States Parole Commission, 835\nF.2d 754 (10th Cir. 1987) (only weighing evidence presented at initial\nparole hearing).\n\n12. The entire report is not part of the record before us, but the\ngovernment does not dispute this characterization of it.\n\n                               10\n\fthe Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra is, to say the least,\na troubling exercise in conjecture. To rely upon the fact\nthat Gambino is married to the sister of someone who is\nallegedly affiliated with the mafia as evidence that he, too,\nis a member of the mafia, is to adopt a rule of guilt by\nassociation. This would be impermissible even if Gambino\nwere the son, brother or father of a confirmed member of\nan organized crime family. But Gambino's wife is not even\nthat. The record in this case does not suggest that she is a\nmafiosa, only that she is related to mafiosos. We cannot\nunderstand how the fact that Gambino is related to\nsomeone who is related to a mafioso somehow makes him\none as well. Nor does the fact that he is a blood relative of\nthe Gambino family make him an ex officio member of the\nGambino \"family\" of La Cosa Nostra.\n\nThe discovery of Inzerillo's corpse in the trunk of\nGambino's car, also does not link Gambino to La Cosa\nNostra. At best, it suggests that Inzerillo, Gambino's cousin\nand business partner, was involved with, or perhaps the\nvictim of, organized crime. But the record indicates-- and\nthe government does not dispute -- that Gambino was\nnever a suspect in the homicide investigation, and fully\ncooperated with it. This is a very important point. The\ndiscovery of a body in the trunk of a car -- particularly a\nso-called \"execution murder victim,\" as the Commission\ndescribed Inzerillo -- carries with it an undeniable graphic\nimpact. It is almost natural to assume initially that the\ncar's owner was not only involved in the murder, but in\nother unsavory activity as well. While we in no way mean\nto diminish the magnitude of this crime, we cannot see\nhow, after investigators had determined that Gambino was\nnot involved with that killing, the Commission can consider\nhis proximity to it as a basis for the denial of parole. Under\nthe particular circumstances of this case, we cannot hold\nthat this evidence provides a \"rational basis . .. for the\nBoard's conclusion[ ] embodied in its statement of reasons.\"\nZannino, 531 F.2d at 690.\n\nWith regard to the New Jersey State Police Report, we\nbegin by noting that evidence of affiliation with a crime\nfamily may be particularly amorphous in a case like this, in\nwhich confusions caused by appellation and genealogy\n\n                               11\n\fmight interfere with the accurate assessment of Erasmo\nGambino's criminal history.\n\nThe New Jersey State Police report's conclusion that\nGambino is linked to organized crime is, to say the least,\nvague. Although the parties have not included a copy of the\nNew Jersey State Police report in the record, the\nCommission apparently relied upon a reference to this\nreport in the Government's Sentencing Memorandum.\nAppellee's Supplemental Appendix at 54. The Sentencing\nMemorandum indicates only that Gambino \"has been\nidentified by the New Jersey State Police . . . as a member\nof the Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra.\" Id. at 76. But we\nrequire evidence intended to establish a defendant's ties to\norganized crime to be more reliable than a bald assertion\nfrom an unverified source. See United States v. Cammisano,\n917 F.2d 1057, 1061 (8th Cir. 1990) (reliable information\nneeded to justify upward departure for involvement with\norganized crime under Sentencing Guidelines); see also\nCardarapoli v. Norton, 523 F.2d 990, 997 (2d Cir. 1975)\n(noting that government often has no basis for its\nconclusions that inmates \"played a significant role in a\ncriminal organization\"); Coralluzzo v. New York State Parole\nBd., 420 F. Supp. 592, 598 (W.D.N.Y. 1976), aff'd, 566\nF.2d 375 (2d Cir. 1977) (noting that \"serious errors are\noften made by the Government in determining that an\ninmate has links with organized crime\"); Mascolo v. Norton,\n405 F. Supp. 523, 524 (D. Conn. 1975) (\"This is another in\na series of cases which disclose the arbitrary classification\nof an inmate as a `member of organized crime' or`Special\nOffender' by federal prison officials without a rational basis\nin fact and without affording the inmate any procedural\ndue process protections.\"); Catalano v. United States, 383 F.\nSupp. 346, 350 (D. Conn. 1974) (Bureau of Prisons'\nimposition of `organized crime' status must be done \"in a\nrational and non-discriminatory manner.\"); Masiello v.\nNorton, 364 F. Supp. 1133, 1136 (D. Conn. 1973) (finding\nno basis in fact for parole board to conclude that defendant\nshould be given organized crime designation, as\nconfidential presentence report was \"replete with hearsay,\ninferences, and conclusions concerning alleged connections\nbetween [the defendant's] family and organized crime\").\n\n                               12\n\fThe hearsay allegations of the \"reliable, unnamed\ninformant\" are similarly flawed. While it is true that the\nCommission can consider hearsay, Campbell, 704 F.2d at\n109-10, this allegation, in the context of this particular\ncase, is especially suspect. The appellant's name itself is\nsufficiently evocative to question the government's\ncharacterization of the informant's allegation that Erasmo\nGambino is a member of the Gambino family of La Cosa\nNostra.13 We have noted above that the government has\nmischaracterized the contents of the Pennsylvania Crime\nCommission Report, most likely as a result of the\nappellant's surname and familial ties. We are similarly\nconcerned with the government's characterization of the\ninformant's allegation: we were not provided with the\nunderlying report from which the allegation is derived.\nMoreover, Gambino has not had the opportunity to\nchallenge the veracity of the informant.\n\nTo protect against arbitrary action, the government\nshould have good cause for the non-disclosure of an\nanonymous informant's identity, and sufficient\ncorroboration of the testimony. Cf. United States v. Fatico,\n579 F.2d 707 (2d Cir. 1978) (subsequent history omitted)\n(at sentencing, district court can consider hearsay\ntestimony of unidentified informant regarding defendants'\ninvolvement in organized crime as long as there is good\ncause for non-disclosure and sufficient corroboration). The\ngovernment's summary of the unnamed informant's\nallegation is neither sufficiently reliable nor sufficiently\ncorroborated to support the Commission's finding. See id.\nat 712-13 (\"a significant possibility of misinformation\" may\njustify the sentencing court in requiring \"the Government to\nverify the information.\"); United States v. Borello, 766 F.2d\n46, 60 n.23 (2d Cir. 1985); see also Misasi v. United States\nParole Comm'n, 835 F.2d 754, 757-58 (10th Cir. 1987)\n(being described by unnamed local and federal authorities\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. The record suggests that the Commission relied upon one reference\nin the Government's Sentencing Memorandum to the informant's\nallegation. The Sentencing Memorandum states that a \"reliable\ninformant . . . has been told by Erasmo Gambino that he is a member\nof the Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra.\" Appellee's Supplemental\nAppendix at 77.\n\n                               13\n\fas largest distributor of illegal prescription drugs in report\nby the United States Attorney is not a \"specific fact\" for the\npurposes of the Commission's own procedures); cf. Zannino,\n531 F.2d at 691-92 (Parole Board may consider hearsay\nregarding membership in crime organization that was\npresented as sworn testimony during the course of a formal\nCongressional hearing where defendant and counsel had\nthe opportunity to rebut it). Here, the corroboration of the\nallegation consists of the New Jersey State Police Report we\ndiscussed earlier, and no good cause has been shown for\nthe non-disclosure of the informant's identity. The\ngovernment's unilateral, untested assertion that the\ninformant is reliable is not sufficient to overcome these\nshortcomings.14\n\nThe Commission relied upon the above evidence to\nrequire that Gambino serve until the expiration of his\nsentence, adding anything from 12 to 24 years to the\nminimum period of incarceration required by statute. Yet,\nsome of the evidence relied upon by the Commission is\naltogether speculative as to Erasmo Gambino's connection\nto the Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra. Other evidence\nonly tenuously demonstrates the connection. The\nremainder is hearsay from unnamed sources. It can hardly\nbe said that this evidence, in itself, provides a \"rational\nbasis in the record for the Board's conclusions embodied in\nits statement of reasons,\" Zannino v. Arnold, 531 F.2d at\n691, and the denial of parole is arbitrary and capricious as\na result. See id. at 689; see also Misasi, 835 F.2d at 757-58\n(reliance on one factually incorrect reason and one non-\nspecific reason does not constitute \"rational basis\" for\nparole date outside of guidelines).\n\nIn the context of a sentencing hearing, we have warned\nof situations where a substantial upward departure in a\nsentence becomes \" `a tail which wags the dog of the\nsubstantive offense.' \" United States v. Kikumura, 918\nF.2d 1084, 1101 (3d Cir. 1990) (quoting McMillan v.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. As Judge Roth observes in her concurring opinion, the evidentiary\nproblem raised by the informant testimony is exacerbated by the fact\nthat Gambino had no opportunity to present his own version of the facts,\nor to rebut or challenge the informant's alleged statements.\n\n                               14\n\fPennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 88 (1986)). In Kikumura we held\nthat a greater evidentiary burden was required when the\nmagnitude of a contemplated departure was extreme.\nKikumura, 918 F.2d at 1101. Although the Parole\nCommission has greater discretion than a sentencing judge,\nwe are concerned that it was willing to add one or two\ndecades to Gambino's prison term based on the quality of\nevidence discussed above. A rational penal system must\nhave some concern for the probable accuracy of the\nevidence it uses to make its decisions. See United States v.\nPerri, 513 F.2d 572, 575 (9th Cir. 1975).15\n\nB.\n\nWe consider next Gambino's contention that the\nCommission's failure to demonstrate \"good cause\" warrants\nhis immediate release. The government argues that a\nremand to the Parole Commission is the appropriate\nremedy if \"good cause\" is found lacking. We agree.\n\nWe have ordered a prisoner released on parole only under\nunique circumstances, which are not present in this case.\nOnly \"[w]hen a district court remands a case to the Parole\nBoard for failure to adequately explain its decision and, on\nremand, the Commission again declines to articulate a\nbasis for the identical conclusion, [may] a district court . . .\npermanently decide this issue on the record before it.\"\nBridge v. United States Parole Comm'n, 981 F.2d 97, 106\n(3d Cir. 1992). See also Billiteri v. United States Bd. of\nParole, 541 F.2d 938, 944 (2d Cir. 1976) (in the case of\nnon-compliance by the Parole Board, a \"court can grant the\nwrit of habeas corpus and order the prisoner discharged\nfrom custody.\").\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. Gambino also argues that affiliation with organized crime is an\ninadequate basis for denying parole, at least where an inmate's crime of\nconviction does not indicate organized criminal activity. We can envision\ncircumstances in which an inmate has participated in organized criminal\nactivity, yet that participation nonetheless does not indicate a\nlikelihood\nof future criminal activity (for instance, where a member of a crime\nfamily renounces his allegiance or becomes a government informant).\nThis argument, therefore, is not to be dismissed lightly. Because we have\ndetermined that Gambino is entitled to relief on other grounds, however,\nwe need not decide this issue.\n\n                               15\n\fFor instance, in Marshall v. Lansing, 839 F.2d 933 (3d\nCir. 1988), the district court remanded a habeas proceeding\nto the Commission with instructions to clearly explain the\nreasoning for its offense categorization. Notwithstanding the\ncourt order, the Commission reassigned the same offense\nseverity level without providing an adequate explanation. In\nlight of the protracted history of the case and the district\ncourt's impression that the Commission intentionally had\nevaded its mandate, the district court ordered the\nCommission to reassess the prisoner's parole status under\na specific offenses severity category. We affirmed this final\nrelief. We also have ordered the release of a prisoner who\nwas denied parole in part because of his race, where a\nremand would have consumed several months, by which\ntime his sentence would have expired. See Block v. Potter,\n631 F.2d 233 (3d Cir. 1980).\n\nIn the absence of such unusual circumstances, however,\nit is clear that a remand is the appropriate remedy. See\ne.g., Zannino v. Arnold, 531 F.2d 687, 692 (3d Cir. 1976);\nBilliteri, 541 F.2d at 938. In this case, although we have\ndetermined that the Commission's basis for exceeding the\nguideline lacks \"good cause,\" it is conceivable that \"good\ncause\" may be demonstrated at a new hearing. Because we\nfind no unusual circumstances, like those presented in\nBridge, Marshall and Block, we will remand for further\nproceedings.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, we reverse the\njudgment and remand the case to the district court with\ndirections that it vacate its judgment and order.\nFurthermore, the district court should remand the case to\nthe Parole Commission with directions that it conduct\nanother Panel hearing within 60 days, and in a manner\nconsistent with this opinion. Since Gambino has already\nserved many months more than prescribed by his guideline\nrange and his mandatory minimum sentence, additional\nadministrative proceedings should be conducted\nexpeditiously.\n\n                                16\n\fROTH, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\nThe Parole Commission denied parole to Erasmo\nGambino on the ground that he was identified as a member\nof an organized crime family. The majority found that in so\nholding, the Parole Commission abused its discretion. The\nmajority determined that the Commission's conclusion was\nnot supported by sufficient evidence, indeed that there was\nno rational basis to support the Commission's conclusion.\nI would, however, not reach the merits of the Parole\nCommission's decision, as the majority did, because I find\nthat two procedural errors occurred prior to any\nCommission decision which errors prejudiced Gambino's\nright to a fair parole hearing. For this reason, I concur in\nthe judgment of the Court as I, too, would reverse the\njudgment of the district court and remand for a new parole\nhearing.\n\nCongress has charged the Parole Commission with\nconducting parole hearings and thereafter determining\nwhether a given prisoner is eligible for parole. 18 U.S.C.\nS 4201 et seq. In order to ensure that a prisoner's due\nprocess rights are respected throughout the parole\ndetermination, Congress both (a) codified certain procedural\nstatutes to guide the Commission, e.g. 18 U.S.C. S 4206,\nand (b) authorized the Commission to promulgate rules and\nregulations to administer parole eligibility determinations in\na fair manner. 18 U.S.C. S 4203(a)(1). The Commission, in\nresponse, established 28 C.F.R. S 2 et seq. The Parole\nCommission's handling of the Gambino parole hearing\ndemonstrates a disregard of these rules and regulations,\nthe sum total of which is a denial of Gambino's due process\nrights.\n\nFirst, Gambino did not receive an opportunity at his\ninitial parole hearing to rebut allegations of organized crime\nuntil after the hearing examiner had ruled on Gambino's\nparole eligibility. This action on the part of the Parole\nCommission constituted a violation of 28 C.F.R. S 2.531 by\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1.     A prisoner . . . serving a term . . . of 5 years or longer shall be\n       released on parole after completion of two-thirds of each\n       consecutive term . . . unless pursuant to a hearing under this\n\n                               17\n\ffailing to provide a hearing complying with 28 C.F.R.\nS 2.19(c).2 Second, after the Hearing, the Commission may\ndeny parole but it must explain with particularity the\nreason for the denial and include a summary of the\ninformation relied on in making this determination.\nGambino was denied proper notice of the factual allegations\nsupporting the Parole Commission's determination that he\nwas a member of La Cosa Nostra. The Commission violated\n18 U.S.C. S 4206(c)3 when it did not inform Gambino of an\nessential piece of information upon which it relied when it\ndetermined that Gambino was a member of La Cosa Nostra.\n\nEither of the these two errors is serious enough to\nwarrant a reversal of the district court and a remand to the\nParole Commission for a new parole hearing. Patterson v.\nGunnell, 753 F.2d 253 (2d Cir. 1985) (remanding for a new\nparole hearing upon finding of Commission's failure to\ncomply with S 2.19(c)'s notice provision); Marshall v.\nLansing 839 F.2d 933, 943 (recognizing that setting aside\nthe Commission's action and remanding for a new hearing\nis appropriate where agency fails to comply with its own\nregulations) (3d Cir. 1988). I address each of these errors in\nturn.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n        section, the Commission determines that there is a reasonable\n        probability that the prisoner will commit any Federal, State or\nlocal\n        crime or that the prisoner has frequently or seriously violated the\n        rules of the institution in which he is confined.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 2.53(a).\n\n2.      The Commission may take into account any substantial\n        information available to it . . . and any aggravating or mitigating\n        circumstances, provided the prisoner is apprised of the information\n        and afforded an opportunity to respond.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 2.19(c).\n\n3. 18 U.S.C. S 4206 (c) provides in part:\n\n        The Commission may grant or deny release on parole .. . if it\n        determines there is good cause for so doing: Provided, That the\n        prisoner is furnished written notice stating with particularity the\n        reasons for its determination, including summary of the information\n        relied upon.\n\n                                18\n\fI. The Parole Hearing\n\nThe Parole Commission held a parole hearing for Erasmo\nGambino on April 20, 1994. At this hearing the Hearing\nExaminer took into account information regarding\nGambino's alleged affiliation with La Cosa Nostra.4\nSpecifically the Examiner relied on a Pennsylvania Crime\nCommission Report and a Government Sentencing\nMemorandum for Gambino's co-defendant Rosario\nGambino, Gambino Pro Se Reply Br. at 11-13; Parole\nHearing Uncertified Transcript (\"Hearing Transcript\") at 13;\nPetitioner's Supplemental Appendix (\"PSA\") at 14.\n\nThere is no question that the Commission is entitled to\nconsider the contents of these documents, but the\nCommission must provide a prisoner with notice that the\ninformation will be used as evidence to deny him parole\nand the prisoner must have an opportunity to respond to\nthe evidence in the documents. S 2.19(c) (\"[t]he Commission\nmay take into account any substantial information\navailable to it . . . and any aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances, provided the prisoner is apprised of the\ninformation and afforded an opportunity to respond.\");\nPatterson v. Gunnell, 753 F.2d 253, 255 (2d Cir. 1985)\n(holding that where the National Appeals Board had\ninformation unknown to prisoner and on which it relied,\nprisoner's case had to be returned for a new parole hearing\nso that prisoner would not be \"deprive[d] .. . of a\nprocedural protection guaranteed by the Commission's\nregulations.\").\n\nFurthermore, the opportunity to respond to the evidence\nin the documents must take place before the Examiner\nproffers his recommendation. Section 2.19(c) explains that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Gambino with his pro se brief in this Court presented a copy of the\nuncertified transcript of the parole hearing. This record was not before\nthe district court. Thus, it is not properly part of the record before us.\nNevertheless, pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 10, I will consider it to\nsubstantiate factual allegations made by Gambino as to the events that\ntook place at the Hearing. This is appropriate particularly where the\nParole Commission has never challenged the accuracy of the transcript\nor of Gambino's version of what transpired at the parole hearing as\nargued in his pro se brief.\n\n                               19\n\fafter the prisoner has had an opportunity to respond to the\nevidence, if there exists a factual dispute, the Commission\nshall resolve it according to the preponderance of evidence.\nIt is inconceivable that Congress intended this fact-finding\nto take place after a Hearing Examiner had made his\ndetermination to grant or deny parole.\n\nThe Commission did not comply with S 2.19(c) here.5\nAfter an extensive discussion about Gambino's role in the\noffense of conviction and without mention of any of the\nevidence connecting Gambino to La Cosa Nostra, the\nultimate basis for the denial of parole, the Examiner\nadjourned the hearing. Gambino Pro Se Reply Br. at 12;\nHearing Transcript at 11; PSA at 12. When the Examiner\ncalled Gambino back into the room, the Examiner read his\nrecommendation that Gambino be denied parole. Id. The\nExaminer explained that the reason for the denial was that\nGambino had been \"identified by the government as being\na member of organized crime.\" Id. The Examiner further\nexplained that the bases for his conclusion were the\nPennsylvania Crime Commission Report and the\nGovernment's Sentencing Memorandum.\n\nThe explanation for the denial of parole (at the conclusion\nof the hearing) was the first mention to Gambino of this\nevidence. Gambino was not given notice that this evidence\nwould be used against him and he was not given an\nopportunity to respond prior to the Examiner's\nrecommendation. The fact that the issue was discussed\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Gambino described the procedure in the following manner:\n\n       Gambino and his attorney were instructed by the parole examiner to\n       leave the hearing room. After being called back by the parole\n       examiner, Gambino was informed of the parole examiner's\n       recommendation to serve to the expiration of his 34 year sentence.\n       The parole examiner then mentioned for the first time the\n       Pennsylvania Crime Commission report [linking him to La Cosa\n       Nostra]. A single question was posed to Gambino, and only after\n       counsel suggested to the parole examiner to ask Gambino if he was\n       a member of organized crime. The superficial organized crime\n       question came only after the parole examiner made his decision to\n       continue Gambino to expiration of his sentence.\n\nGambino Pro Se Reply Br., at 12-13.\n\n                                20\n\fafter the Examiner made his decision is not sufficient to\nprevent a violation of 28 U.S.C. S 2.19(c). As the\nCommissioner asserts, \"the record reveal[s] that appellant's\ncounsel spoke to [the issue of Gambino's organized crime\nties] in the hearing\" reiterating the district court holding.\nParole Comm'n Reply Br. at 5. The consideration of the\nevidence must, however, take place before the Hearing\nExaminer has decided what the outcome will be and has\nmade his recommendation. An opportunity to develop one's\nposition on the merits, i.e., deny one's involvement with\norganized crime, after the Examiner has made up his mind\nand stated his recommendation, is not sufficient\n\"opportunity to be heard.\"\n\nEven more troubling was the Examiner's apparent\nreliance on a New Jersey State Police Report conclusion\nthat Gambino was involved in organized crime. This report\nwas never mentioned at the hearing. There is passing\nreference to it in the Examiner's Initial Hearing Summary\nas evidence providing one of the bases for the conclusion\nthat Gambino was involved in organized crime. However,\nthe Examiner made no mention at all of the New Jersey\nreport during the hearing -- either before or after he had\nmade his decision.\n\nFollowing the hearing, Gambino appealed the denial of\nparole to the National Appeals Board. The fact that he may\nhave had an opportunity to challenge the evidence on\nappeal is not sufficient.6 The procedural posture on appeal\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. I recognize that Kell v. United States Parole Commission, 26 F.3d\n1016, 1022 (10th Cir. 1994), accepted the contrary proposition. There\nthe Tenth Circuit held that, in the context of a parole revocation\nhearing,\na prisoner was sufficiently \"apprised of the information and afforded an\nopportunity to respond\" within the meaning of 28 C.F.R. S 2.19(c), when\nhe, being denied information at the parole revocation hearing, was\nafforded an opportunity to respond via pursuit of the administrative\nreview process. Kell relied on Patterson v. Gunnell, 753 F.2d 253, 255-56\n(2d. Cir. 1985), where the Second Circuit held that S 2.19(c) was not\nsatisfied where petitioner had no opportunity to respond when the\nNational Appeals Board relied on aggravating circumstances of which\npetitioner had not been informed. However, the Second Circuit never\npassed on the issue before us. Furthermore, the Tenth Circuit in Kell\nwas ruling in the context of a parole revocation hearing, not an initial\nparole hearing where the due process liberty interests at issue are\ndifferent.\n\n                                21\n\fof a denial of parole is completely different from that of the\ninitial hearing on the merits. First, at the hearing the\nprisoner can submit live testimony (his own or a witness's);\non appeal, the prisoner can only make written\npresentations. Compare 18 U.S.C. S 4208(e); 28 C.F.R.\nS 2.19(b)(4)7 with S 2.27(b).8 For example, if a prisoner had\nan alibi defense for prior uncharged criminal conduct that\nwas being used as the basis for denial of parole, the alibi\nwitness could testify before the Hearing Examiner; he could\nnot before the National Appeals Board. Second, the\nstandard of review of evidence submitted is different at the\nhearing than it is on appeal. At the hearing, the Examiner\nmakes factual findings on a \"preponderance of the\nevidence\" standard; on appeal, the National Appeals Board\nowes some deference to the findings of the Hearing\nExaminer. Compare S 2.19(c)9 with S 2.26(e).10Thus, a\nprisoner, who has an opportunity to be heard only on\nappeal, must prove not only that his version of the events\nis true by a preponderance of the evidence, as at a hearing,\nbut also that the hearing examiner, whose decision is owed\nsome deference, was wrong in his preponderance of the\nevidence determination. This is a higher standard of\npersuasion. Third, a prisoner has a statutory right to be\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. \"The Commission will normally consider only verbal and written\nevidence at hearings.\" 28 C.F.R. S 2.19(b)(4).\n\n8. \"Attorneys, relatives, and other interested parties who wish to\nsubmit written information concerning [a prisoner's appeal] should send\nsuch information to [the following address] . . . thirty days in advance.\"\n28 C.F.R. S 2.27(b).\n\n9. \"If the prisoner disputes the accuracy of the information presented,\nthe Commission shall resolve such dispute by the preponderance of the\nevidence standard.\" 28 C.F.R. S 2.19(c).\n\n10. Appeals . . . may be based on the following grounds:\n\n       (3) That especially mitigating circumstances (for example, facts\n       relating to the severity of the offense or the prisoner's\nprobability of\n       success on parole) justify a different decision;\n       (4) That a decision was based on erroneous information, and the\n       actual facts justify a different decision.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 2.26(e). It would appear that review of factual determinations\nby the National Appeals Board is for clear error.\n\n                               22\n\fpresent at his parole hearing; he does not at his appeal.\nSee 18 U.S.C. S 4208(e); 28 C.F.R. S 2.13(a).\n\nFor all these reasons, the posture of a case on appeal is\nnot the same as a hearing on the merits. A prisoner's\nopportunity at the hearing to rebut allegations of fact is a\nright protected by statute and regulations. His opportunity\non appeal to challenge the veracity of facts, already\nestablished, cannot make up for the loss of his earlier right\nto be heard.\n\nInferential support for this proposition is drawn from the\nfact that many circuits have held that the Commission may\nnot rely on information undisclosed to the prisoner in\ndetermining eligibility for parole even if the information is\nsubsequently made available to prisoners on administrative\nappeal. See United States ex rel. Schiano v. Luther, 954 F.2d\n910, 915 (3d Cir. 1992); Pulver v. Luther, 912 F.2d 894,\n896-97 (7th Cir. 1990); Anderson v. United States Parole\nComm'n, 793 F.2d 1136, 1137-38 (9th Cir. 1986). See also\nLiberatore v. Story, 854 F.2d 830, 838 (6th Cir. 1988\n(remanding to determine whether late received documents\nhad to be disclosed). These cases all deal with violations\nof either 18 U.S.C. S 4208(b)(2) or 28 C.F.R.\nS 2.55 (Commission's obligation to disclose inculpatory\ninformation prior to a parole hearing), not of S 2.19(c), the\nregulation at issue here. However, they recognize the notion\nthat post-hearing access to information does not remedy\nprior violations.11\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. Gambino argues for the first time on appeal to this Court that he\nwas not provided the requisite disclosure of documents prior to his\nparole hearing. Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations section\n2.55(a) instructs that the Parole Commission, at least 60 days prior to\nan initial parole hearing, must notify each prisoner of \"his right to\nrequest disclosure of the reports and other documents to be used by the\nCommission in making its [parole] determination.\" Gambino argues that\nhe was not provided such notice. Gambino Pro Se Reply Br. at 8. As a\nresult, Gambino did not exercise his right to request disclosure under\nS 2.55. He claims that as a consequence he was ill-prepared at his parole\nhearing to refute the evidence of his involvement with La Cosa Nostra.\nWe cannot determine from the record before us whether the Parole\nCommission violated S 2.55(a) as well.\n\n                               23\n\fIn response to Gambino's argument that the Commission\nhas violated S 2.19(c), the Commission has raised a\nprocedural default issue of waiver. The Commission asserts\nthat Gambino waived his right to appeal the S 2.19(c) issue\nbecause he neglected to assert this argument to this Court\nuntil his pro se reply brief. Ordinarily, an appellant's failure\nto raise an issue in a opening brief constitutes\nabandonment or waiver of that issue. See Republic of the\nPhillippines v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 43 F.3d 65, 71\nn.5 (3d Cir. 1994) (appellants required to set forth issues\nand present arguments in favor of those issues in opening\nbrief); Kost v. Kozakiewicz, 1 F.3d 176, 182 (3d Cir. 1993).\nSee also Fed. R. App. P. 28(a). The rule serves two related\npurposes. First, it protects the appellee from the prejudice\nthat results from the court's consideration of a late\nargument to which the appellee ordinarily cannot issue a\nwritten response. Second, it promotes the values of our\nadversarial system by ensuring that the court has heard\nadequate argument on a particular issue prior to rendering\nits decision. See Headrick v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 24 F.3d\n1272, 1277-78 (10th Cir. 1994); Hebert v. National\nAcademy of Sciences, 974 F.2d 192, 196 (D.C.Cir. 1992). 16\nC. Wright, A. Miller, et. al., Federal Practice and Procedure\nS 3974 n.4 (1996). Despite this rule, however, appellate\ncourts may in their discretion consider issues not properly\nraised in an opening brief. The D.C. Circuit has stated that\nit will consider issues raised only in the reply brief - or\nissues not raised at all - when the error is so\"plain\" that\nmanifest injustice would otherwise result. See Herbert v.\nNational Academy of Sciences, 974 F.2d 192, 196 (D.C.Cir.\n1992). Similarly, the Ninth Circuit also has held that courts\nmay consider an issue improperly raised if failure to do so\nwould create manifest injustice. See United States v. Ullah,\n976 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir. 1992) (because manifest\ninjustice would result in court's reversal only of\ncodefendant's conviction, court would entertain defendant's\nargument for reversal despite fact that argument was not\nraised until reply brief).12\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. The manifest injustice exception is somewhat similar to the \"plain\nerror\" rule, which is applied in the context of appeals from criminal\ntrials, and allows appellate courts to consider defects at the trial level\neven when the defendant has failed to lodge an appropriate objection.\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).\n\n                               24\n\fIn addition to preventing manifest injustice, some circuit\ncourts have expressed a willingness to consider an issue\nnot properly presented in an opening brief where the\nequities favor the court's consideration of the issue or if the\nappellee is not likely to be prejudiced. See Ullah, 976 F.2d\nat 514 (Ninth Circuit willing to consider issue raised only in\nreply brief when government had already addressed the\nissue in consolidated brief and therefore suffered no\nprejudice); Curry v. Beatrice Pocahontas Coal Co., 67 F.3d\n517, 522 n.8 (4th Cir. 1995).\n\nUnder the circumstances of this case, I conclude that it\nis appropriate to consider the notice issue raised by\nGambino in his pro se reply brief. First, the record clearly\ndemonstrates that the Parole Commission never gave\nGambino an opportunity to refute the evidence against him\nat his parole hearing. Were this a trial, this defect might\nvery well rise to the level of \"plain error.\" Manifest injustice\nwould result if we were to penalize Erasmo Gambino for the\nstrategic shortcomings of his attorney. Second, the\ngovernment was not prejudiced by Gambino's late\npresentation of the issue in the reply brief because we\npermitted the Commission to file a surreply brief in\nresponse to Gambino's pro se reply. Consequently, the\nissue was fully addressed by both sides and therefore was\nsubject to the intellectual rigors of the adversarial process.\nAs such, I find the Parole Commission's waiver argument\nnot to be persuasive.\n\nAs a remedy for the violation of S 2.19(c), it is clear that\n\"[a] court can set aside agency action that fails to comply\nwith the agency's own regulations at least where the\nregulations are designed to protect the individual grievant.\"\nMarshall v. Lansing, 839 F.2d 933, 943 (3d Cir. 1988).13\nSuch is the case here. An appropriate disposition is to\nremand to the Commission to conduct a parole hearing in\ncompliance with its regulations. Patterson v. Gunnell, 753\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. See also United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S.   683, 695-96, 94 S.Ct.\n3090, 3101-02 (1974); Frisby v. United States   Department of Housing &\nUrban Development, 755 F.2d 1052, 1055-56 (3d   Cir. 1985); D'Iorio v.\nCounty of Delaware, 592 F.2d 681, 685 n.2 (3d   Cir. 1978); Bluth v.\nLaird, 435 F.2d 1065, 1071(4th Cir. 1970).\n\n                               25\n\fF.2d 253 (2d Cir. 1985) (remanding for a new parole\nhearing upon finding of Commission's failure to comply\nwith S 2.19(c)'s notice provision).\n\nII. The Written Notice of Reasons for Denial of Parole\n\nIn addition to violating 28 C.F.R. S 2.19(c) by not\nproviding Gambino with notice and an opportunity to\nrespond to the evidence against him, the Commission\nexacerbated matters by its subsequent failure to provide a\nsummary of the evidence used in determining to deny\nparole, in violation of 18 U.S.C. S 4206(c) 14 and its\nconcomitant Parole Commission regulation, 28 C.F.R.\nS 2.13(d).15 16 Gambino had a parole hearing on August 20,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14.    The Commission may grant or deny release on parole . . . if it\n       determines there is good cause for so doing: Provided, That the\n       prisoner is furnished written notice stating with particularity the\n       reasons for its determination, including a summary of the\n       information relied upon.\n\n18 U.S.C. S 4206(c).\n\n15.    In accordance with 18 U.S.C. 4206 the reasons for establishment\n       of a release date shall include . . . the specific factors and\n       information relied upon for any decision outside the range\n       indicated by the guidelines.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 2.13(d).\n\n16. In addition, it is quite possible that the Commission's behavior\nviolated Gambino's constitutional due process rights. Several courts of\nappeal have found that the federal parole statute creates a substantial\nexpectation of parole that is protected by the due process clause. See\nKindred v. Spears, 894 F.2d 1477, 1481 (5th Cir. 1990); Solomon v.\nElsea, 676 F.2d 282, 285 (7th Cir. 1982); Evans v. Dillahunty, 662 F.2d\n522, 526 (8th Cir. 1981). While the amount of process owed a parolee by\nthe Constitution is not clear, see, e.g., Evans, 662 F.2d at 526, the\nParole Commission's statutes and regulations bind it to a higher level of\nprocedural protection. See Kindred, 894 F.2d at 1481-82. As a federal\nagency, the Parole Commission has an obligation to abide by its own\nregulations and laws. See Marshall v. Lansing, 839 F.2d 933, 941 (3d\nCir. 1988). Because I find a violation of federal statute and regulations,\nthe question of whether there was a violation of Gambino's\nConstitutional due process rights need not be decided. Northwest\nAirlines, Inc., v. Transport Workers Union Of America, 101 S.Ct. 1571,\n1578 n.15 (1981).\n\n                               26\n\f1994, pursuant to which he was denied parole. Both federal\nlaw and Commission regulations require that the\nCommission explain the nature of the evidence relied on to\ndeny parole. Section 4206(c) requires that the prisoner be\n\"furnished [with] written notice stating with particularity\nthe reasons for its determination including a summary of\nthe information relied upon.\" Section 2.13(d) requires that\n\"the reasons . . . [shall include] the specific factors and\ninformation relied upon.\" In an effort to comply with these\nrequirements, the Commission, throughout the\nadministrative appeals process prepared four separate\ndocuments purporting to summarize the evidence linking\nGambino to La Cosa Nostra. All were inadequate. None of\nthe Pre-Hearing Assessment, Parole Commissioner's Initial\nHearing Summary, Regional Commissioner's decision, and\nNational Appeals Board Notice of Action refer to the reliable\ninformant, cited by the government in its sentencing\nmemorandum for co-defendant Rosario Gambino, who\nlinked Erasmo Gambino to La Cosa Nostra.17 Thus\nGambino was denied any notice of arguably the most\nforceful evidence linking him to La Cosa Nostra and so was\nill-prepared to contest this evidence on appeal. See Nunez-\nGuardado v. Hadden, 722 F.2d 618, 624 (10th Cir. 1983)\n(explaining that the purpose of requiring a summary of the\nevidence is so that prisoner can \"fully exercise his right of\nappeal\"). Furthermore, the combination of the failure to\nconfront Gambino with such evidence at the hearing-- the\nviolation of S 2.19(c), coupled with the failure to summarize\nthe evidence post-hearing -- placed Gambino in a\nparticularly difficult position.\n\nThe Commission's claim in its response to Gambino's Pro\nSe Reply Brief that we should reject Gambino's claim\nbecause Gambino had access to the government's\nsentencing memorandum, which was a part of his central\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17. In addition, the Parole Commissioner's Initial Hearing Summary\nfails to mention the discovery of Pietro Inzerillo's body in Gambino's\ncar.\nSee Petitioner's Appendix, at 6. However, the Parole Commission\narguably cured this deficiency after the case was referred for original\njurisdiction, since the Regional Commissioner's decision cites the\ndiscovery of the body in Gambino's trunk as support for its\ndetermination. See Petitioner's Appendix, at 9.\n\n                               27\n\ffile, see Parole Comm'n Reply Br., at 2, is weak. The mere\nfact that Gambino may have had access to the sentencing\nmemorandum (and the informant's statements contained\ntherein) is meaningless. Section 4206(c) requires the\nCommission to provide a summary of the information on\nwhich it has relied when it makes a \"good cause\"\ndetermination and denies parole. To construe the\nrequirements of S 4206(c) as anything less than to require\nthe Commission to identify the essential pieces of\ninformation that caused it to associate Gambino with\norganized crime, would be improper. Only with such\nidentification, can Gambino be in a position to challenge\nthis determination on appeal.\n\nIn addition, the government argues that Gambino waived\nthe S 4206(c)/S 2.13(d) claim, despite Gambino having\nraised the issue before the district court, see District Court\nOp., at 9-10, by not asserting it in his opening appellate\nbrief, i.e., he did not raise it on appeal until he submitted\nhis pro se reply brief. Despite the procedural default, I have\nconsidered this claim. I did so for the reasons stated in\nSection I: a) so as not to create manifest injustice to the\ndefendant and b) since the Commission will not be\nprejudiced because we permitted it to file a Surreply Brief.\n\nThe Commission's argument that Gambino failed to\nexhaust his administrative remedies by not making this\nargument before the Parole Commission stumbles at the\noutset. Gambino could hardly have complained about\ninadequate notice of inculpatory information before he\nknew he was being deprived of pertinent information in the\nfirst place.\n\nOrdinarily, federal prisoners are required to exhaust their\nadministrative remedies prior to seeking a writ of habeas\ncorpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 2241. See Moscato v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, 98 F.3d 757, 760 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(prisoner must exhaust administrative remedy prior to\nchallenging disciplinary proceeding in habeas petition);\nTatum v. Christiansen, 786 F.2d 959, 964 (9th Cir. 1986).\nUnlike the rule requiring prisoners to exhaust state\nremedies, this rule is of judicial and not statutory creation.\nIn either case, exhaustion is not required when the\npetitioner demonstrates that it is futile. See Rose v. Lundy,\n\n                                28\n\f455 U.S. 509, 516 n.7, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1202 (1982)\n(exhaustion of state remedies not required where futile). Cf.\nLyons v. U.S. Marshalls, 840 F.2d 202, 205 (3d Cir. 1988)\n(in Bivens action, federal prisoners need not exhaust\nadministrative remedies if futile or if actions of agency\n\"clearly and unambiguously violate statutory or\nconstitutional rights\").\n\nThere is no question that Gambino appealed the Hearing\nExaminer's denial of parole to the regional and national\nlevels of the Parole Commission. Throughout those appeals,\nGambino maintained that the Commission had incorrectly\nidentified him as a member of an organized crime family. At\nno point did the Commission indicate that it had relied on\nthe \"reliable government informant\" for its determination\nthat Gambino was a member of La Cosa Nostra. Since the\nadministrative process failed to reveal to Gambino the\nCommission's reliance on the government informant, that\nprocess has proved itself to be futile. As such, the\nCommission's exhaustion argument must fail.\n\nIt is clear that the Commission failed to comply with\nS 4206(c) or S 2.13(d) by failing to adequately summarize\nthe information it relied on in denying Gambino parole. It\nis also clear that the district court relied at least partially\non this information when it affirmed the Commission's\ndecision. See District Court Op. at 8-9. For these reasons, I\nwould reverse the district court's finding thatS 4206(c) was\nsatisfied and I would join with the majority in remanding\nfor another parole hearing, one which would comply with\nall applicable law, including SS 4206(c), 2.13(d) and 2.19(c).\nPatterson v.

In particular, he claims that the Commission's\nconclusion that he was affiliated with an organized crime\nfamily was not supported by any evidence, and that an\norganized crime affiliation is not enough, in itself, to deny\nparole. Gambino filed a writ of habeas corpus, which the\ndistrict court denied. Because we find that the United\nStates Parole Commission abused its discretion, we will\nreverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n\nI.\n\nErasmo Gambino is currently incarcerated at the Federal\nCorrectional Institution at Fairton, New Jersey. In 1984, he\nwas convicted of conspiracy to distribute heroin; two counts\nof possession of heroin with intent to distribute; and two\ncounts of distribution of heroin, all in violation of 21 U.S.C.\nSS 841(a)(1) and (b)(1). Gambino was also convicted of use\nof a telephone in a conspiracy to distribute and possess\nheroin, a felony under 21 U.S.C. S 846, in violation of 21\nU.S.C. SS 843(b) and (c). On December 6, 1984, he was\nsentenced to a 34-year term of imprisonment and a\n$95,000 fine.\n\nPrior to the verdict, Gambino was cited for attempted\nescape from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New\nYork City. He was later found guilty and given a 30-day\ndisciplinary segregation as punishment.\n\nAll of these offenses occurred between December 1983\nand March 1984, before the enactment of the Sentencing\n\n                                 2\n\fReform Act of 1984 (\"SRA\"), Pub. L. No. 98-473, Title II,\nOct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 1987. The SRA abolished parole,\nsee SRA S 218(a)(5), 98 Stat. 2027, 2031, but only for\noffenses committed after November 1, 1987. See Sentencing\nReform Amendment Act of 1985, Pub. L. No. 99-217, S 4,\nDec. 26, 1985, 99 Stat. 1728.1 Thus, Gambino was entitled\nto a parole hearing.\n\nOn April 20, 1994, the United States Parole Commission\nconducted a parole hearing and Gambino was denied\nrelease.2 The Hearing Panel assigned Gambino a Category\nSix Offense Severity Rating because he had been convicted\nof conspiracy to distribute more than 50 but less than 999\ngrams of pure heroin. See U.S. Parole Commission Offense\nBehavior Severity Index, Chapter Nine, Subchapter A,\nP 901(d), 28 C.F.R. S 2.20 (1995).3 The Panel assessed his\nsalient factor score as 10 out of 10, with 10 representing\nthe lowest risk of parole violation. See id. (Salient Factor\nScoring Manual). The parole guidelines for a prisoner with\na salient score of 10 and a Category Six offense severity\nrating indicate a term of incarceration of 40 to 52 months.\nSee 28 C.F.R. S 2.20(b). The Panel assessed an additional 8\nto 16 months for Gambino's attempted escape from secure\ncustody.4 The resulting aggregate guideline range was 48 to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The parole enabling statutes, 18 U.S.C. SS 4201 to 4218 (1997), were\nrepealed pursuant to Pub. L. 98-473, Title II, S 218(a)(5), Oct. 12, 1984,\n98 Stat. 2027. Nonetheless, these statutes remain in effect for ten years\nafter Nov. 1, 1987. Pub. L. 101-650, Title III,S 316, Dec. 1, 1990, 104\nStat. 5115. For the sake of brevity, the subsequent history of the parole\nstatutes will be hereafter omitted.\n\n2. To avoid later confusion when citing early cases regarding parole, we\nnote that the Parole Commission is the successor to the Parole Board.\nCampbell v. United States Parole Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416564\"><a href=\"/opinion/416564/willis-e-campbell-v-united-states-parole-commission-and-joseph-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111 (3d Cir.\n1983); Pub.

The district court\nrelied\non the 1995 edition, as do we.\n\n4. The Commission's Notices of Action do not indicate under which\nprovision this penalty was assessed. The district court stated that it was\nassessed pursuant to 28 C.F.R. S 2.36(a)(23)(1)(A). There is no such\nsection, but it appears that the district court intended to indicate 28\nC.F.R. S 2.36(a)(2)(i)(A). However, on its face, this section does not\napply\n\n                               3\n\f68 months.5 However, 18 U.S.C. S 4205(a) (1997) requires\nthat Gambino remain incarcerated for at least 10 years\nprior to being eligible for parole.6 At the time of the April 20,\n1994 hearing, Gambino had served approximately 119\nmonths. Nevertheless, the Panel recommended that he\nremain incarcerated until the expiration of his sentence,\nsolely because Gambino has been identified as a member of\nan organized crime family.\n\nThe Panel also recommended that the case be referred for\n\"original jurisdiction.\"7 Government's Supplemental\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nto Gambino's attempted escape because it only applies \"to the\nsanctioning of disciplinary infractions or new criminal behavior\ncommitted by a prisoner subsequent to the commencement of his\nsentence.\" Id. S 2.36(a). Gambino attempted to escape prior to the verdict\nand thus prior to the commencement of his sentence. Moreover, he was\ngiven a 30-day disciplinary segregation for this offense after he was\nfound guilty.\n\nBecause Gambino has not raised this issue and because his\nmandatory minimum sentence exceeds the guideline range with or\nwithout the additional 8 to 16 months, we need not decide if this\nincrease in the guideline range was proper.\n\n5. The district court stated that the guideline range was 48 to 78\nmonths. This is incorrect and appears to be a typographical error.\nBecause both figures are below the applicable statutory mandatory\nminimum sentence, the disparity has no effect on our analysis.\n\n6. 18 U.S.C. S 4205(a) (1997) provides that \"[w]henever confined and\nserving a definite term or terms of more than one year, a prisoner shall\nbe eligible for release on parole after serving one-third of such term or\nterms or after serving ten years of a life sentence or of a sentence of\nover\nthirty years, except to the extent otherwise provided by law.\"\n\n7. The district court stated that this case was referred for \"original\njurisdiction\" consideration pursuant to 28 C.F.R.S 2.17. Gambino v.\nMorris, slip op. at 4, No. 95-CV 4559 (D.N.J. Apr. 11, 1996). However,\nthe Regional Commissioner's May 13, 1994 Notice of Action indicates\nthat the case was referred for further review pursuant to 28 C.F.R.\nS 2.24(a). S.A. at 17. Subsection 2.24(a), entitled \"Review of Panel\nRecommendations by the Regional Commissioner,\" provides that\n\n       [a] Regional Commissioner may review the recommendation of any\n       examiner panel and refer this recommendation, prior to written\n       notification to the prisoner with his recommendation and vote to\nthe\n\n                               4\n\fAppendix (\"S.A.\") at 16. On June 27, 1994, the Commission\nrendered an \"original jurisdiction\" decision by Notice of\nAction, determining that Gambino would serve until the\nexpiration of his sentence. Id. at 18. The Commission\ninformed Gambino that a decision to go outside the\nguidelines was warranted because Gambino was\n\n       a more serious risk than indicated by [his] salient\n       factor score in that [he has] been identified by the\n       government as a member of an organized crime family\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       National Commissioners for consideration and any action deemed\n       appropriate . . . .

The section entitled \"Original Jurisdiction cases\"\nprovides that\n\n       [f]ollowing any hearing conducted pursuant to these rules, a\n       Regional Commissioner may designate certain cases for decision by\n       a quorum of Commissioners as described below, as original\n       jurisdiction cases . . . .

Not only is this inconsistent with the Regional\nCommissioner's Notice of Action, it is also facially incorrect. Subsection\n(b)(4) only applies to \"[p]risoners sentenced to a maximum term of forty\nfive years (or more) or prisoners serving life sentences.\" Because\nGambino is only serving a sentence of 34 years, this subsection does not\napply.\n\nSubsection (b)(2)(ii) would apply, however, if the case had been referred\npursuant to section 2.17. See 28 C.F.R. S 2.17(b)(2)(ii) (Regional\nCommissioner may designate a case as \"original jurisdiction\" when a\nprisoner's offense \"was part of a large-scale criminal conspiracy or a\ncontinuing criminal enterprise.\").\n\nNotwithstanding these procedural irregularities, we need not decide\nwhether Gambino was prejudiced by them because of the result we\nreach in this case. We note them only to ensure that they are not\nrepeated on remand.\n\n                               5\n\f       and as evidenced by the body of an execution murder\n       victim found in the trunk of [his] automobile on\n       November 15, 1982.\n\nId. The Notice of Action concluded that \"[a] decision above\nthe guidelines is mandated in that [Gambino has] a\nminimum sentence which exceeds the guideline range.\" Id.\nThe body referred to in the Notice of Action was that of\nPietro Inzerillo. Inzerillo was Gambino's cousin, and the two\nmen jointly owned a pizzeria. Gambino claims, and the\ngovernment does not dispute, that he was never a suspect\nin this slaying.\n\nGambino appealed to the Commission's National Appeals\nBoard, which affirmed the Commission's decision on\nDecember 7, 1994, by Notice of Action. Id. at 19. The\nAppeals Board stated that\n\n       [i]n response to [Gambino's] claim that the reasons\n       provided to exceed the guidelines are not a part of the\n       offense of conviction and therefore should not be relied\n       upon is without merit. The Commission may consider\n       available information to determine an appropriate\n       sanction for the total offense behavior. [His] claim that\n       the information used is flawed does not persuade the\n       Commission to change the decision.\n\nId.\n\nIn summary, the parole guidelines indicated that\nGambino should serve a term of 48 to 68 months. However,\nGambino was not eligible for parole until he served a\nminimum sentence of 120 months. He had a parole hearing\nafter serving approximately 120 months and was denied\nparole. The Commission requires that he serve until the\nexpiration of his 34-year sentence.\n\nIf Gambino remains a model prisoner, he will be released\nafter completing two-thirds of his sentence, a period of\napproximately 272 months. 18 U.S.C. S 4206(d) (1997).8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. 18 U.S.C.

But the Pennsylvania\nCrime Commission Report does not say what either the\ngovernment or the Commission suggest. The sole reference\nto Erasmo Gambino in the report states that he is married\nto the sister of Rosario Gambino (his cousin), who, the\nreport alleges, is a member of La Cosa Nostra.12 This\nattenuated familial tie does not, indeed cannot, in and of\nitself, provide a rational basis for finding that Gambino\nparticipated in organized crime. Thus, the Commission\nerred in concluding that this report stated that Gambino\nwas affiliated with La Cosa Nostra, and accordingly, it is an\ninvalid basis for the Commission's decision to deny parole.\nSee Campbell v.

Gambino argues that the Panel only considered the Pennsylvania\nCrime Commission Report and the fact that Inzerillo's body was found in\nhis car. The Initial Hearing Summary does, in fact, only rely on those\ntwo items. Plaintiff 's Appendix (\"P.A.\") at 7. The Pre-Hearing Assessment\nrelies on those two items and one other for its conclusion. P.A. at 5. The\nAssessment mentions that the New Jersey State Police had identified\nGambino as a member of the Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra.\nHowever, nowhere does this Assessment explicitly mention that it relied\non information provided by an informant.\n\nBecause we find that the information provided by that informant is\nunreliable, we need not decide whether Gambino was further prejudiced\nby the failure to mention the reliance on the informant before and during\nthe parole hearing. See Misasi v. United States Parole Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498775\"><a href=\"/opinion/498775/sam-s-misasi-v-united-states-parole-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1987) (only weighing evidence presented at initial\nparole hearing).\n\n12. The entire report is not part of the record before us, but the\ngovernment does not dispute this characterization of it.\n\n                               10\n\fthe Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra is, to say the least,\na troubling exercise in conjecture. To rely upon the fact\nthat Gambino is married to the sister of someone who is\nallegedly affiliated with the mafia as evidence that he, too,\nis a member of the mafia, is to adopt a rule of guilt by\nassociation. This would be impermissible even if Gambino\nwere the son, brother or father of a confirmed member of\nan organized crime family. But Gambino's wife is not even\nthat. The record in this case does not suggest that she is a\nmafiosa, only that she is related to mafiosos. We cannot\nunderstand how the fact that Gambino is related to\nsomeone who is related to a mafioso somehow makes him\none as well. Nor does the fact that he is a blood relative of\nthe Gambino family make him an ex officio member of the\nGambino \"family\" of La Cosa Nostra.\n\nThe discovery of Inzerillo's corpse in the trunk of\nGambino's car, also does not link Gambino to La Cosa\nNostra. At best, it suggests that Inzerillo, Gambino's cousin\nand business partner, was involved with, or perhaps the\nvictim of, organized crime. But the record indicates-- and\nthe government does not dispute -- that Gambino was\nnever a suspect in the homicide investigation, and fully\ncooperated with it. This is a very important point. The\ndiscovery of a body in the trunk of a car -- particularly a\nso-called \"execution murder victim,\" as the Commission\ndescribed Inzerillo -- carries with it an undeniable graphic\nimpact. It is almost natural to assume initially that the\ncar's owner was not only involved in the murder, but in\nother unsavory activity as well. While we in no way mean\nto diminish the magnitude of this crime, we cannot see\nhow, after investigators had determined that Gambino was\nnot involved with that killing, the Commission can consider\nhis proximity to it as a basis for the denial of parole. Under\nthe particular circumstances of this case, we cannot hold\nthat this evidence provides a \"rational basis . .. for the\nBoard's conclusion[ ] embodied in its statement of reasons.\"\nZannino, 531 F.2d at 690.\n\nWith regard to the New Jersey State Police Report, we\nbegin by noting that evidence of affiliation with a crime\nfamily may be particularly amorphous in a case like this, in\nwhich confusions caused by appellation and genealogy\n\n                               11\n\fmight interfere with the accurate assessment of Erasmo\nGambino's criminal history.\n\nThe New Jersey State Police report's conclusion that\nGambino is linked to organized crime is, to say the least,\nvague. Although the parties have not included a copy of the\nNew Jersey State Police report in the record, the\nCommission apparently relied upon a reference to this\nreport in the Government's Sentencing Memorandum.\nAppellee's Supplemental Appendix at 54. The Sentencing\nMemorandum indicates only that Gambino \"has been\nidentified by the New Jersey State Police . . . as a member\nof the Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra.\" Id. at 76.

We are similarly\nconcerned with the government's characterization of the\ninformant's allegation: we were not provided with the\nunderlying report from which the allegation is derived.\nMoreover, Gambino has not had the opportunity to\nchallenge the veracity of the informant.\n\nTo protect against arbitrary action, the government\nshould have good cause for the non-disclosure of an\nanonymous informant's identity, and sufficient\ncorroboration of the testimony.

Gambino also argues that affiliation with organized crime is an\ninadequate basis for denying parole, at least where an inmate's crime of\nconviction does not indicate organized criminal activity. We can envision\ncircumstances in which an inmate has participated in organized criminal\nactivity, yet that participation nonetheless does not indicate a\nlikelihood\nof future criminal activity (for instance, where a member of a crime\nfamily renounces his allegiance or becomes a government informant).\nThis argument, therefore, is not to be dismissed lightly. Because we have\ndetermined that Gambino is entitled to relief on other grounds, however,\nwe need not decide this issue.\n\n                               15\n\fFor instance, in Marshall v.

Notwithstanding the\ncourt order, the Commission reassigned the same offense\nseverity level without providing an adequate explanation. In\nlight of the protracted history of the case and the district\ncourt's impression that the Commission intentionally had\nevaded its mandate, the district court ordered the\nCommission to reassess the prisoner's parole status under\na specific offenses severity category. We affirmed this final\nrelief. We also have ordered the release of a prisoner who\nwas denied parole in part because of his race, where a\nremand would have consumed several months, by which\ntime his sentence would have expired. See Block v.

See\ne.g., Zannino v. Arnold, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"333898\"><a href=\"/opinion/333898/zannino-ilario-v-arnold-floyd-e-warden-us-penitentiary-and-sigler/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 692 (3d Cir. 1976);\nBilliteri, 541 F.2d at 938. In this case, although we have\ndetermined that the Commission's basis for exceeding the\nguideline lacks \"good cause,\" it is conceivable that \"good\ncause\" may be demonstrated at a new hearing. Because we\nfind no unusual circumstances, like those presented in\nBridge, Marshall and Block, we will remand for further\nproceedings.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, we reverse the\njudgment and remand the case to the district court with\ndirections that it vacate its judgment and order.\nFurthermore, the district court should remand the case to\nthe Parole Commission with directions that it conduct\nanother Panel hearing within 60 days, and in a manner\nconsistent with this opinion. Since Gambino has already\nserved many months more than prescribed by his guideline\nrange and his mandatory minimum sentence, additional\nadministrative proceedings should be conducted\nexpeditiously.\n\n                                16\n\fROTH, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\nThe Parole Commission denied parole to Erasmo\nGambino on the ground that he was identified as a member\nof an organized crime family. The majority found that in so\nholding, the Parole Commission abused its discretion. The\nmajority determined that the Commission's conclusion was\nnot supported by sufficient evidence, indeed that there was\nno rational basis to support the Commission's conclusion.\nI would, however, not reach the merits of the Parole\nCommission's decision, as the majority did, because I find\nthat two procedural errors occurred prior to any\nCommission decision which errors prejudiced Gambino's\nright to a fair parole hearing. For this reason, I concur in\nthe judgment of the Court as I, too, would reverse the\njudgment of the district court and remand for a new parole\nhearing.\n\nCongress has charged the Parole Commission with\nconducting parole hearings and thereafter determining\nwhether a given prisoner is eligible for parole. 18 U.S.C.\nS 4201 et seq. In order to ensure that a prisoner's due\nprocess rights are respected throughout the parole\ndetermination, Congress both (a) codified certain procedural\nstatutes to guide the Commission, e.g. 18 U.S.C. S 4206,\nand (b) authorized the Commission to promulgate rules and\nregulations to administer parole eligibility determinations in\na fair manner. 18 U.S.C. S 4203(a)(1). The Commission, in\nresponse, established 28 C.F.R. S 2 et seq. The Parole\nCommission's handling of the Gambino parole hearing\ndemonstrates a disregard of these rules and regulations,\nthe sum total of which is a denial of Gambino's due process\nrights.\n\nFirst, Gambino did not receive an opportunity at his\ninitial parole hearing to rebut allegations of organized crime\nuntil after the hearing examiner had ruled on Gambino's\nparole eligibility. This action on the part of the Parole\nCommission constituted a violation of 28 C.F.R. S 2.531 by\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1.     A prisoner . . . serving a term . . . of 5 years or longer shall be\n       released on parole after completion of two-thirds of each\n       consecutive term . . . unless pursuant to a hearing under this\n\n                               17\n\ffailing to provide a hearing complying with 28 C.F.R.\nS 2.19(c).2 Second, after the Hearing, the Commission may\ndeny parole but it must explain with particularity the\nreason for the denial and include a summary of the\ninformation relied on in making this determination.\nGambino was denied proper notice of the factual allegations\nsupporting the Parole Commission's determination that he\nwas a member of La Cosa Nostra. The Commission violated\n18 U.S.C. S 4206(c)3 when it did not inform Gambino of an\nessential piece of information upon which it relied when it\ndetermined that Gambino was a member of La Cosa Nostra.\n\nEither of the these two errors is serious enough to\nwarrant a reversal of the district court and a remand to the\nParole Commission for a new parole hearing.

The Parole Hearing\n\nThe Parole Commission held a parole hearing for Erasmo\nGambino on April 20, 1994. At this hearing the Hearing\nExaminer took into account information regarding\nGambino's alleged affiliation with La Cosa Nostra.4\nSpecifically the Examiner relied on a Pennsylvania Crime\nCommission Report and a Government Sentencing\nMemorandum for Gambino's co-defendant Rosario\nGambino, Gambino Pro Se Reply Br. at 11-13; Parole\nHearing Uncertified Transcript (\"Hearing Transcript\") at 13;\nPetitioner's Supplemental Appendix (\"PSA\") at 14.\n\nThere is no question that the Commission is entitled to\nconsider the contents of these documents, but the\nCommission must provide a prisoner with notice that the\ninformation will be used as evidence to deny him parole\nand the prisoner must have an opportunity to respond to\nthe evidence in the documents. S 2.19(c) (\"[t]he Commission\nmay take into account any substantial information\navailable to it . . . and any aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances, provided the prisoner is apprised of the\ninformation and afforded an opportunity to respond.\");\nPatterson v.

Section 2.19(c) explains that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Gambino with his pro se brief in this Court presented a copy of the\nuncertified transcript of the parole hearing. This record was not before\nthe district court. Thus, it is not properly part of the record before us.\nNevertheless, pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 10, I will consider it to\nsubstantiate factual allegations made by Gambino as to the events that\ntook place at the Hearing. This is appropriate particularly where the\nParole Commission has never challenged the accuracy of the transcript\nor of Gambino's version of what transpired at the parole hearing as\nargued in his pro se brief.\n\n                               19\n\fafter the prisoner has had an opportunity to respond to the\nevidence, if there exists a factual dispute, the Commission\nshall resolve it according to the preponderance of evidence.\nIt is inconceivable that Congress intended this fact-finding\nto take place after a Hearing Examiner had made his\ndetermination to grant or deny parole.\n\nThe Commission did not comply with S 2.19(c) here.5\nAfter an extensive discussion about Gambino's role in the\noffense of conviction and without mention of any of the\nevidence connecting Gambino to La Cosa Nostra, the\nultimate basis for the denial of parole, the Examiner\nadjourned the hearing. Gambino Pro Se Reply Br. at 12;\nHearing Transcript at 11; PSA at 12. When the Examiner\ncalled Gambino back into the room, the Examiner read his\nrecommendation that Gambino be denied parole. Id. The\nExaminer explained that the reason for the denial was that\nGambino had been \"identified by the government as being\na member of organized crime.\" Id. The Examiner further\nexplained that the bases for his conclusion were the\nPennsylvania Crime Commission Report and the\nGovernment's Sentencing Memorandum.\n\nThe explanation for the denial of parole (at the conclusion\nof the hearing) was the first mention to Gambino of this\nevidence. Gambino was not given notice that this evidence\nwould be used against him and he was not given an\nopportunity to respond prior to the Examiner's\nrecommendation. The fact that the issue was discussed\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Gambino described the procedure in the following manner:\n\n       Gambino and his attorney were instructed by the parole examiner to\n       leave the hearing room. After being called back by the parole\n       examiner, Gambino was informed of the parole examiner's\n       recommendation to serve to the expiration of his 34 year sentence.\n       The parole examiner then mentioned for the first time the\n       Pennsylvania Crime Commission report [linking him to La Cosa\n       Nostra]. A single question was posed to Gambino, and only after\n       counsel suggested to the parole examiner to ask Gambino if he was\n       a member of organized crime. The superficial organized crime\n       question came only after the parole examiner made his decision to\n       continue Gambino to expiration of his sentence.\n\nGambino Pro Se Reply Br., at 12-13.\n\n                                20\n\fafter the Examiner made his decision is not sufficient to\nprevent a violation of 28 U.S.C. S 2.19(c). As the\nCommissioner asserts, \"the record reveal[s] that appellant's\ncounsel spoke to [the issue of Gambino's organized crime\nties] in the hearing\" reiterating the district court holding.\nParole Comm'n Reply Br. at 5. The consideration of the\nevidence must, however, take place before the Hearing\nExaminer has decided what the outcome will be and has\nmade his recommendation. An opportunity to develop one's\nposition on the merits, i.e., deny one's involvement with\norganized crime, after the Examiner has made up his mind\nand stated his recommendation, is not sufficient\n\"opportunity to be heard.\"\n\nEven more troubling was the Examiner's apparent\nreliance on a New Jersey State Police Report conclusion\nthat Gambino was involved in organized crime. This report\nwas never mentioned at the hearing. There is passing\nreference to it in the Examiner's Initial Hearing Summary\nas evidence providing one of the bases for the conclusion\nthat Gambino was involved in organized crime. However,\nthe Examiner made no mention at all of the New Jersey\nreport during the hearing -- either before or after he had\nmade his decision.\n\nFollowing the hearing, Gambino appealed the denial of\nparole to the National Appeals Board. The fact that he may\nhave had an opportunity to challenge the evidence on\nappeal is not sufficient.6 The procedural posture on appeal\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. I recognize that Kell v. United States Parole Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672136\"><a href=\"/opinion/672136/sam-richard-kell-v-united-states-parole-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1016</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1022 (10th Cir. 1994), accepted the contrary proposition. There\nthe Tenth Circuit held that, in the context of a parole revocation\nhearing,\na prisoner was sufficiently \"apprised of the information and afforded an\nopportunity to respond\" within the meaning of 28 C.F.R. S 2.19(c), when\nhe, being denied information at the parole revocation hearing, was\nafforded an opportunity to respond via pursuit of the administrative\nreview process. Kell relied on Patterson v. Gunnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446939\"><a href=\"/opinion/446939/william-e-patterson-v-robert-a-gunnell-warden-federal-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">753</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255-56\n(2d. Cir. 1985), where the Second Circuit held that S 2.19(c) was not\nsatisfied where petitioner had no opportunity to respond when the\nNational Appeals Board relied on aggravating circumstances of which\npetitioner had not been informed. However, the Second Circuit never\npassed on the issue before us. Furthermore, the Tenth Circuit in Kell\nwas ruling in the context of a parole revocation hearing, not an initial\nparole hearing where the due process liberty interests at issue are\ndifferent.\n\n                                21\n\fof a denial of parole is completely different from that of the\ninitial hearing on the merits. First, at the hearing the\nprisoner can submit live testimony (his own or a witness's);\non appeal, the prisoner can only make written\npresentations. Compare 18 U.S.C. S 4208(e); 28 C.F.R.\nS 2.19(b)(4)7 with S 2.27(b).8 For example, if a prisoner had\nan alibi defense for prior uncharged criminal conduct that\nwas being used as the basis for denial of parole, the alibi\nwitness could testify before the Hearing Examiner; he could\nnot before the National Appeals Board. Second, the\nstandard of review of evidence submitted is different at the\nhearing than it is on appeal. At the hearing, the Examiner\nmakes factual findings on a \"preponderance of the\nevidence\" standard; on appeal, the National Appeals Board\nowes some deference to the findings of the Hearing\nExaminer. Compare S 2.19(c)9 with S 2.26(e).10Thus, a\nprisoner, who has an opportunity to be heard only on\nappeal, must prove not only that his version of the events\nis true by a preponderance of the evidence, as at a hearing,\nbut also that the hearing examiner, whose decision is owed\nsome deference, was wrong in his preponderance of the\nevidence determination. This is a higher standard of\npersuasion. Third, a prisoner has a statutory right to be\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. \"The Commission will normally consider only verbal and written\nevidence at hearings.\" 28 C.F.R. S 2.19(b)(4).\n\n8. \"Attorneys, relatives, and other interested parties who wish to\nsubmit written information concerning [a prisoner's appeal] should send\nsuch information to [the following address] . . . thirty days in advance.\"\n28 C.F.R. S 2.27(b).\n\n9. \"If the prisoner disputes the accuracy of the information presented,\nthe Commission shall resolve such dispute by the preponderance of the\nevidence standard.\" 28 C.F.R. S 2.19(c).\n\n10. Appeals . . . may be based on the following grounds:\n\n       (3) That especially mitigating circumstances (for example, facts\n       relating to the severity of the offense or the prisoner's\nprobability of\n       success on parole) justify a different decision;\n       (4) That a decision was based on erroneous information, and the\n       actual facts justify a different decision.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 2.26(e). It would appear that review of factual determinations\nby the National Appeals Board is for clear error.\n\n                               22\n\fpresent at his parole hearing; he does not at his appeal.\nSee 18 U.S.C.

A prisoner's\nopportunity at the hearing to rebut allegations of fact is a\nright protected by statute and regulations. His opportunity\non appeal to challenge the veracity of facts, already\nestablished, cannot make up for the loss of his earlier right\nto be heard.\n\nInferential support for this proposition is drawn from the\nfact that many circuits have held that the Commission may\nnot rely on information undisclosed to the prisoner in\ndetermining eligibility for parole even if the information is\nsubsequently made available to prisoners on administrative\nappeal.

Gambino argues for the first time on appeal to this Court that he\nwas not provided the requisite disclosure of documents prior to his\nparole hearing. Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations section\n2.55(a) instructs that the Parole Commission, at least 60 days prior to\nan initial parole hearing, must notify each prisoner of \"his right to\nrequest disclosure of the reports and other documents to be used by the\nCommission in making its [parole] determination.\" Gambino argues that\nhe was not provided such notice. Gambino Pro Se Reply Br. at 8. As a\nresult, Gambino did not exercise his right to request disclosure under\nS 2.55. He claims that as a consequence he was ill-prepared at his parole\nhearing to refute the evidence of his involvement with La Cosa Nostra.\nWe cannot determine from the record before us whether the Parole\nCommission violated S 2.55(a) as well.\n\n                               23\n\fIn response to Gambino's argument that the Commission\nhas violated S 2.19(c), the Commission has raised a\nprocedural default issue of waiver. The Commission asserts\nthat Gambino waived his right to appeal the S 2.19(c) issue\nbecause he neglected to assert this argument to this Court\nuntil his pro se reply brief.

The manifest injustice exception is somewhat similar to the \"plain\nerror\" rule, which is applied in the context of appeals from criminal\ntrials, and allows appellate courts to consider defects at the trial level\neven when the defendant has failed to lodge an appropriate objection.\nSee Fed.

First, the record clearly\ndemonstrates that the Parole Commission never gave\nGambino an opportunity to refute the evidence against him\nat his parole hearing. Were this a trial, this defect might\nvery well rise to the level of \"plain error.\" Manifest injustice\nwould result if we were to penalize Erasmo Gambino for the\nstrategic shortcomings of his attorney. Second, the\ngovernment was not prejudiced by Gambino's late\npresentation of the issue in the reply brief because we\npermitted the Commission to file a surreply brief in\nresponse to Gambino's pro se reply. Consequently, the\nissue was fully addressed by both sides and therefore was\nsubject to the intellectual rigors of the adversarial process.\nAs such, I find the Parole Commission's waiver argument\nnot to be persuasive.\n\nAs a remedy for the violation of S 2.19(c), it is clear that\n\"[a] court can set aside agency action that fails to comply\nwith the agency's own regulations at least where the\nregulations are designed to protect the individual grievant.\"\nMarshall v.

S 2.19(c) by not\nproviding Gambino with notice and an opportunity to\nrespond to the evidence against him, the Commission\nexacerbated matters by its subsequent failure to provide a\nsummary of the evidence used in determining to deny\nparole, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

Both federal\nlaw and Commission regulations require that the\nCommission explain the nature of the evidence relied on to\ndeny parole. Section 4206(c) requires that the prisoner be\n\"furnished [with] written notice stating with particularity\nthe reasons for its determination including a summary of\nthe information relied upon.\" Section 2.13(d) requires that\n\"the reasons . . . [shall include] the specific factors and\ninformation relied upon.\" In an effort to comply with these\nrequirements, the Commission, throughout the\nadministrative appeals process prepared four separate\ndocuments purporting to summarize the evidence linking\nGambino to La Cosa Nostra. All were inadequate. None of\nthe Pre-Hearing Assessment, Parole Commissioner's Initial\nHearing Summary, Regional Commissioner's decision, and\nNational Appeals Board Notice of Action refer to the reliable\ninformant, cited by the government in its sentencing\nmemorandum for co-defendant Rosario Gambino, who\nlinked Erasmo Gambino to La Cosa Nostra.17 Thus\nGambino was denied any notice of arguably the most\nforceful evidence linking him to La Cosa Nostra and so was\nill-prepared to contest this evidence on appeal. See Nunez-\nGuardado v. Hadden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"427756\"><a href=\"/opinion/427756/elias-nunez-guardado-v-john-t-hadden-and-the-united-states-parole/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 624 (10th Cir. 1983)\n(explaining that the purpose of requiring a summary of the\nevidence is so that prisoner can \"fully exercise his right of\nappeal\"). Furthermore, the combination of the failure to\nconfront Gambino with such evidence at the hearing-- the\nviolation of S 2.19(c), coupled with the failure to summarize\nthe evidence post-hearing -- placed Gambino in a\nparticularly difficult position.\n\nThe Commission's claim in its response to Gambino's Pro\nSe Reply Brief that we should reject Gambino's claim\nbecause Gambino had access to the government's\nsentencing memorandum, which was a part of his central\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17. In addition, the Parole Commissioner's Initial Hearing Summary\nfails to mention the discovery of Pietro Inzerillo's body in Gambino's\ncar.\nSee Petitioner's Appendix, at 6. However, the Parole Commission\narguably cured this deficiency after the case was referred for original\njurisdiction, since the Regional Commissioner's decision cites the\ndiscovery of the body in Gambino's trunk as support for its\ndetermination. See Petitioner's Appendix, at 9.\n\n                               27\n\ffile, see Parole Comm'n Reply Br., at 2, is weak. The mere\nfact that Gambino may have had access to the sentencing\nmemorandum (and the informant's statements contained\ntherein) is meaningless. Section 4206(c) requires the\nCommission to provide a summary of the information on\nwhich it has relied when it makes a \"good cause\"\ndetermination and denies parole. To construe the\nrequirements of S 4206(c) as anything less than to require\nthe Commission to identify the essential pieces of\ninformation that caused it to associate Gambino with\norganized crime, would be improper. Only with such\nidentification, can Gambino be in a position to challenge\nthis determination on appeal.\n\nIn addition, the government argues that Gambino waived\nthe S 4206(c)/S 2.13(d) claim, despite Gambino having\nraised the issue before the district court, see District Court\nOp., at 9-10, by not asserting it in his opening appellate\nbrief, i.e., he did not raise it on appeal until he submitted\nhis pro se reply brief. Despite the procedural default, I have\nconsidered this claim. I did so for the reasons stated in\nSection I: a) so as not to create manifest injustice to the\ndefendant and b) since the Commission will not be\nprejudiced because we permitted it to file a Surreply Brief.\n\nThe Commission's argument that Gambino failed to\nexhaust his administrative remedies by not making this\nargument before the Parole Commission stumbles at the\noutset. Gambino could hardly have complained about\ninadequate notice of inculpatory information before he\nknew he was being deprived of pertinent information in the\nfirst place.\n\nOrdinarily, federal prisoners are required to exhaust their\nadministrative remedies prior to seeking a writ of habeas\ncorpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

Throughout those appeals,\nGambino maintained that the Commission had incorrectly\nidentified him as a member of an organized crime family. At\nno point did the Commission indicate that it had relied on\nthe \"reliable government informant\" for its determination\nthat Gambino was a member of La Cosa Nostra. Since the\nadministrative process failed to reveal to Gambino the\nCommission's reliance on the government informant, that\nprocess has proved itself to be futile. As such, the\nCommission's exhaustion argument must fail.\n\nIt is clear that the Commission failed to comply with\nS 4206(c) or S 2.13(d) by failing to adequately summarize\nthe information it relied on in denying Gambino parole. It\nis also clear that the district court relied at least partially\non this information when it affirmed the Commission's\ndecision. See District Court Op. at 8-9. For these reasons, I\nwould reverse the district court's finding thatS 4206(c) was\nsatisfied and I would join with the majority in remanding\nfor another parole hearing, one which would comply with\nall applicable law, including SS 4206(c), 2.13(d) and 2.19(c).\nPatterson v.
