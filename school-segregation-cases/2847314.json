AINSWORTH, JR., Appellant\n\n                                           V.\n\n                                CACH, LLC, Appellee\n\n\n                   On Appeal from the County Court at Law No. 1\n                              Fort Bend County, Texas\n                       Trial Court Cause No. 09-CCV-040548\n\n\n                   MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n      In this credit card collection case, appellant James O. Ainsworth, Jr. challenges a\njudgment in favor of appellee CACH, LLC. Ainsworth contends that (a) the trial court\nerroneously admitted a business-records affidavit, (b) CACH lacked standing to sue,\n(c) the trial court abused its discretion by permitting Ainsworth to testify regarding\ndocuments not in evidence, (d) attorney’s fees were not proven by CACH, (e) the\nevidence is legally insufficient to support the verdict, and (f) the trial court erred by\ndenying Ainsworth’s counterclaims. We affirm.\n\f                                     BACKGROUND\n\n       In October 2009, CACH sued Ainsworth to recover a credit card debt attributed to\nAinsworth. CACH had acquired the debt from Chase Bank USA, N.A. In September\n2010, Ainsworth answered with a sworn denial, stating that CACH’s claims were not\ntrue, that he did not owe the amount CACH claimed he owed, and that he had never\napplied for, received, used, or authorized anyone to use the credit card at issue. He also\nasserted the affirmative defenses of statute of limitations, fraud, statute of frauds,\npayment, estoppel, failure of consideration, and usury. He further challenged CACH’s\nstanding to sue and averred that he had not received a pre-suit demand. Finally, he\ncounterclaimed under the DTPA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Texas\nFinance Code.\n\n       During discovery, CACH sought copies of Ainsworth’s personal Wells Fargo\nbank account statements for the period from April 1, 2007 through April 30, 2008 (the\n“Wells Fargo statements”). After being sanctioned for failing to produce these\ndocuments, Ainsworth produced them to CACH.\n\n       At the bench trial conducted on March 22, 2011, Ainsworth challenged CACH’s\nstanding to pursue collection of this account. In response, CACH asserted that it had\nstanding as an assignee of the original holder of the account. The trial court admitted,\nover a variety of Ainsworth’s objections, a business-records affidavit signed by CACH\nemployee Maria Hwang on November 9, 2010, with several attachments incorporated\ntherein (the “business-records affidavit”). In this affidavit, Hwang states:\n\n          1. I am the Authorized Agent and custodian of the records of Plaintiff\n             and am familiar with the Plaintiff’s business processes. Business\n             records are kept and maintained in the ordinary course of Plaintiff's\n             business (“Records”) concerning accounts like the account of the\n             Defendant. The Records are made and maintained by individuals\n             who have a business duty to make entries in the Records accurately\n             at or near the time of the event that they record, or reasonably soon\n             thereafter, by or from information transmitted by someone with\n             personal knowledge of the event or act.\n                                              2\n\f                        2. In addition, it is Plaintiff’s regular business practice to obtain,\n                           integrate, and rely upon documents prepared by the original creditor\n                           of the account at issue. In this particular action, Plaintiff has\n                           obtained and integrated documents received from the original\n                           creditor, CHASE BANK USA, N.A. successor in interest to\n                           WASH1NGTON MUTUAL/PROVIDIAN BANK. Plaintiff relies\n                           upon the accuracy of such documentation in its day to day business\n                           activities and such documents are considered Records of the\n                           Plaintiff. The records consist of both hard copy information and\n                           electronic information that is generated, stored and maintained by\n                           the original creditor in accordance with generally accepted standards\n                           in the retail and financial industries by individuals that possess the\n                           knowledge and training necessary to ensure the accuracy and\n                           reliability of the records. I know from my experience in reviewing\n                           such records that those records are made and maintained by\n                           individuals who have a business duty to make entries in the records\n                           accurately at or near the time of the event that they record. Plaintiff\n                           relies upon the accuracy and reliability of said records in its day to\n                           day business.\n\n                    Exhibit A to this affidavit is a “Bill of Sale” from Chase to CACH, purporting to\n          sell “all rights, title and interest” to certain receivables “described in Exhibit 1 attached\n          hereto and made part hereof for all purposes.” In turn, attached to this Bill of Sale is a\n          largely redacted spreadsheet, with a heading stating “Chase Bank USA to CACH, LLC.”\n          The spreadsheet contains the following information:\n                                                                                            Placement                Creditor\nAccount Number       Debtor Name   SSN    Client Acct No     DOB        Original Creditor                Placement              C/O Date\n                                                                                            Date                     Last Pay\n                                   XXX-\n                     AINSWORTH,                                         WAMU/PROVIDIAN\n15185179971295969                  XX-    4559962400404685   2/3/1952                       12/18/2008   4567.07     4/3/2008   11/28/2008\n                     JR, JAMES O                                        BANK\n                                   9743\n\n                    Another affidavit by Hwang, dated August 6, 2009, is attached to the business-\n          records affidavit. In this affidavit, Hwang states:\n\n                        1. I am an authorized agent for and a custodian of the records of\n                           CACH, LLC.\n                        2. As authorized agent and custodian of the business records for\n                           Plaintiff, I have personal knowledge based upon the review of the\n                           documentation provided by the original creditor (attached hereto)\n                           that, after all just and lawful offsets, payments, and credits have been\n\n\n                                                                    3\n\f             allowed, the total balance on the account of $4,567.07 is just and\n             true and is due and owing from Defendant to Plaintiff.\n          3. The total amount of $4,567.07 is based on the amount due at the\n             time of placement of the account with plaintiff of $4,567.07 and post\n             placement interest of $0 which accrues at an interest rate of 0%\n             based on the documentation provided by the original creditor and\n             attached hereto.\n          4. The records attached hereto are the original or exact duplicates of the\n             original.\n          5. Demand for payment of the just amount owing Plaintiff by\n             Defendant was made upon the Defendant more than thirty (30) days\n             prior to filing of plaintiff’s original petition, and payment for the just\n             amount owing has not been tendered.\n\n      Also attached to the business-records affidavit is an “Affidavit of Sale” signed by\nWendy Baldwin of Chase, in which she states:\n\n      I am authorized on behalf of Chase Bank USA, N .A. (“Chase”) to make\n      this affidavit.\n      JP Morgan Chase & Co. (“JP Morgan”) purchased certain credit card\n      receivables originated by Washington Mutual Bank through the FDIC,\n      which receivables were assigned to Chase.\n      JAMES O AINSWORTH JR had credit card account number\n      4559962400404685 with Washington Mutual Bank, and that Account was\n      one of the receivables transferred to Chase as described in paragraph 2.\n      Chase sold the Account to CACH, LLC. on or about 12/22/2008. At the\n      time of the sale to CACH, LLC., the amount due on the account pursuant to\n      the terms of the applicable cardholder agreement by JAMES O\n      AINSWORTH JR was $4,567.07.\n      Your deponent states that to the best of deponent’s knowledge, information\n      and belief that there was no unaccredited payment, just counterclaims or\n      offsets against the account when it was sold.\n      Chase has no further interest in said account for any purpose.\nSeveral copies of statements from Washington Mutual Card Services reflecting Providian\naccount number 4559-9624-0040-4685 and addressed to James O. Ainsworth Jr., 1613\nFrost St., Rosenberg, TX 77471-4214 are also attached to the business-records affidavit.\nThe first of these statements has a closing date of February 13, 2008 and reflects a\n\n                                              4\n\fbalance due of $3,487.01 and a payment received of $150.00. The second statement lists\nthe closing date as April 15, 2008, reflects various charges made and a payment of\n$150.00, and shows a closing balance of $3,607.08. The third statement shows the\nclosing date as November 13, 2008 and reflects a closing balance of $4,567.07. Finally,\ncopies of Providian Bank Visa and MasterCard account agreements are attached to the\nbusiness-records affidavit, although these copies are nearly illegible and unsigned by\nAinsworth.\n\n       After the business-records affidavit was admitted, CACH called Ainsworth, who\ntestified that he had never received, used or authorized the use of, or made payments on a\nWashington Mutual/Providian Bank credit card. He acknowledged that the credit card\nstatements admitted as part of the business-records affidavit were addressed to him at his\nresidence. He agreed that the Wells Fargo statements shown to him by CACH’s counsel\nwere the statements he had produced to CACH during discovery. He further\nacknowledged that the Wells Fargo bank statement dated March 6 through April 4, 2007\nreflected his name, his late wife’s name, and his mailing address, and that he had seen\nthese statements prior to trial.\n\n       When CACH asked him to acknowledge that on March 6, 2007, “a payment to\nWaMu PVN., WaMu Providian, payment on credit card” for $150.00 was shown on the\nWells Fargo statement, Ainsworth’s counsel objected that CACH was questioning\nAinsworth about documents not in evidence. The trial court overruled the objection.\nAinsworth then denied that he had made the payment reflected on his bank statement. He\ndid, however, agree that a payment attributed to his late wife, Gayle L. Ainsworth, was\nmade on the same day, which was reflected on the statement. He further acknowledged\nthat a direct deposit from his employer appeared on the statement.\n\n       CACH asked about another of Ainsworth’s bank statements, seeking\nacknowledgment from Ainsworth that he had made a payment on April 3, 2007, to\nWaMu Providian. Ainsworth’s counsel objected that CACH was asking Ainsworth again\nto testify from a document not in evidence. The trial court overruled the objection, stating\n\n                                             5\n\fthat the document was provided to CACH’s counsel. Ainsworth’s counsel obtained a\nrunning objection to “this document.” Ainsworth again denied making the payment\nshown on his bank statement, although he agreed that the statement reflected a payment\nto WaMu Providian for $125.00 made on April 3, 2007 with his name on it. He also\ndenied having seen or reviewed any of his bank statements from April 2007 to April\n2008. He further stated that he “had no idea” that, for seven years, statements were being\nsent to his house showing a debt on the credit card. He further denied having received\nseveral collection calls from various individuals regarding this credit card debt.\n\n       On cross-examination, Ainsworth testified that his late wife, Gayle, was\nresponsible for paying the bills. He again denied ever applying for, receiving, or using the\ncredit card at issue here. He further denied speaking with anyone from CACH regarding\nthe credit card account. He testified that he knew nothing about this credit card debt until\nhe received a letter from CACH’s counsel that he needed to appear for court regarding\nthe debt. He stated, “Well, it was really upsetting to me because I didn’t know anything\nabout it. Here I am being sued for a credit card I never used or knew about.”\n\n       CACH’s counsel, Richard Clark, testified, over Ainsworth’s objection, regarding\nhis fees. He stated that he billed his debt-collection clients, including CACH, on a\ntwenty-five percent contingency basis of the amount collected. Clark explained that his\ntwenty-five percent contingency fee on the principal amount owed is reasonable and\nnecessary given the amount of work he puts into a case. When cross-examined about his\ntime, Clark admitted that he did not keep time records because he worked on a\ncontingency basis. He further acknowledged that he did not segregate his time between\nCACH’s claims and the defenses and counterclaims of Ainsworth. He stated that his fee\nin this case was $1,507.13.1 Ainsworth’s counsel, Betsy Grubbs, testified regarding her\nhourly rates and that a reasonable and necessary fee for this case would be $5,120.00. She\nalso testified regarding appellate fees. The trial court took the matter under advisement.\n\n\n       1\n           This amount is greater than twenty-five percent of the principal amount owed in this debt case.\n\n                                                     6\n\f         On May 4, 2011, the trial court signed a judgment in favor of CACH, awarding\nCACH $4,567.07 in damages, $1,150.00 in attorney’s fees, five-percent post-judgment\ninterest, and court costs. It dismissed all of Ainsworth’s counterclaims with prejudice.\nAinsworth filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law, but our record does\nnot contain these findings. This appeal timely ensued.\n\n                                 The Business-Records Affidavit\n\n         Because Ainsworth’s first, second, and fifth issues relate to the trial court’s\nadmission of the business-records affidavit, we address these issues together. In issue\none, Ainsworth contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the\nbusiness-records affidavit. Next, Ainsworth asserts that the trial court erred in concluding\nthat CACH had standing to pursue this claim. Finally, in issue five, Ainsworth contends\nthat, excluding the inadmissible evidence, there is no evidence to support the judgment.\nOrdinarily, we would address the standing issue first, as it relates to the trial court’s\njurisdiction.2 But these issues all turn on the admissibility of the business-records\naffidavit because it establishes CACH’s standing and provides legally sufficient evidence\nto support the trial court’s verdict. Thus, we address the admissibility of this affidavit\nfirst.\n\n         A.     Admissibility of the Business-Records Affidavit\n\n         Ainsworth challenged the admission of the business-records affidavit and\nsupporting documentation on numerous grounds, including hearsay and that the\nsupporting documents were unreliable and not trustworthy. The admission and exclusion\nof evidence are within the sound discretion of the trial court. Bayer Corp. v. DX\nTerminals, Ltd., 214 S.W.3d 586, 609 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet.\n\n\n         2\n           A party seeking affirmative relief must have standing to invoke a court’s subject matter\njurisdiction. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Inman, 252 S.W.3d 299, 304 (Tex. 2008). Without breach of a\nlegal right belonging to the plaintiff, no cause of action can accrue to its benefit. See Nobles v. Marcus,\n533 S.W.2d 923, 927 (Tex. 1976). When a plaintiff lacks standing, the proper disposition is to dismiss the\nlawsuit. Inman, 252 S.W.3d at 304.\n\n                                                    7\n\fdenied) (citing City of Brownsville v. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1995)). The\ncomplaining party must show that the trial court erred and that such error probably\nresulted in an improper judgment, which usually requires a showing that the judgment\nturned on the challenged evidence. Id.; see also Tex. R. App. P. 44.1(a)(1) (requiring that\nbefore a judgment can be reversed on appeal it must be determined that the error\nprobably caused rendition of an improper judgment or prevented the appellant from\nproperly presenting the case on appeal).\n\n       A proponent of hearsay evidence bears the burden of showing that testimony fits\nwithin an exception to the general rule prohibiting admission of the hearsay evidence.\nVolkswagen of Am., Inc. v. Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d 897, 908 n. 5 (Tex. 2004); see also Tex.\nR. Evid. 802. Rule of Evidence 803(6) provides an exception to the hearsay rule for\nbusiness records if the offering party shows (1) the records were made and kept in the\nregular course of business; (2) the business kept the records as part of its regular practice;\n(3) the records were made at or near the time of the event they contain; and (4) the person\nmaking the records or submitting the information had personal knowledge of the events\nbeing recorded. See Tex. R. Evid. 803(6). Business records may also be “admissible in\nevidence in any court in this state upon the affidavit of [a] person” who can satisfy the\nrequirements of Rule 803(6). Tex. R. Evid. 902(10)(a). Finally, third-party documents\ncan become the business records of an organization and, consequently, admissible under\nrule 803(6), if the records are (1) incorporated and kept in the course of the testifying\nwitness’s business; (2) the business typically relies upon the accuracy of the contents of\nthe documents; and (3) the circumstances otherwise indicate the trustworthiness of the\ndocuments. Simien v. Unifund CCR Partners, 321 S.W.3d 235, 240–41 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.) (citing Bell v. State, 176 S.W.3d 90, 92 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. ref’d)).\n\n       The business-records affidavit, described above, meets these criteria. Hwang\nstated that she is the custodian of records for CACH and that it is CACH’s “regular\nbusiness practice to obtain, integrate and rely upon documents prepared by the original\n\n                                              8\n\fcreditor of the account at issue.” She further averred that CACH relies on the accuracy of\nthe documents in its day-to-day business activities and that the records are made and\nmaintained by individuals who have a duty to keep the record accurately at or near the\ntime of the event that they record. Finally, one of the documents attached to the business-\nrecords affidavit is the “affidavit of sale,” which is notarized. Such a notarized document\nis self-authenticating under the Texas Rules of Evidence. See Tex. R. Evid. 902(8). In\nthis document, described above, an authorized agent of Chase Bank, N.A., stated that\nChase had acquired Ainsworth’s account from Washington Mutual Bank, sold it to\nCACH in December 2008, and that the amount due on the account at the time of the sale\nwas $4,567.07. Chase’s failure to keep accurate records could result in criminal or civil\npenalties. See Tex. Fin. Code Ann. § 392.304(a)(8) (prohibiting misrepresentations of\namount of consumer debt); id. § 392.402 (providing for criminal penalties for violations\nof chapter 392 of Texas Finance Code); see also Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15\nU.S.C.A. § 1692e(2)(a) (prohibiting misrepresentation of amount of debt); id. § 1692l\n(providing for administrative enforcement of Administrative Debt Collection Practices\nAct). These circumstances otherwise indicate the trustworthiness of the Chase Bank\ndocuments.3 See Simien, 321 S.W.3d at 243–44. Accordingly, because the business-\nrecords affidavit at issue here meets the criteria for admission as business records under\n\n\n        3\n           Ainsworth mistakenly relies on Old Republic, a case from the First Court of Appeals, for the\nproposition that documents under the business records exception to the hearsay rule generally come in\nfully proven, unless contract execution is challenged by verified denial. Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Edwards,\nNo. 01-10-00150-CV, 2011 WL 2623994, at *11 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] June 30, 2011, no pet)\n(mem. op.). But Old Republic is not a case dealing with a credit card debt. See id. A credit or charge card\nagreement need not be in writing or signed. See Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code Ann. §26.02(a)(2)(A)\n(exempting credit or charge cards from the requirement that a loan agreement must be in writing); see\nalso Winchek v. Am. Express Travel Related Servs. Co., 232 S.W.3d 197, 204 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\nDist.] 2007, no pet.) (concluding that use of and payment on a credit card account is sufficient to establish\nthe card holder’s intent to be bound by the credit card agreement). Although Ainsworth denied applying\nfor, receiving, using, and making payments on the account at issue here, his credibility was an issue for\nthe trier of fact. See, e.g., Grounds v. Tolar Indep. Sch. Dist., 856 S.W.2d 417, 422 (Tex. 1993) (stating\nthat trial court is arbiter of both factual and legal issues in a non-jury trial); Cent. Forest S/C Partners,\nLtd. v. Mundo-Mundo, Inc., 184 S.W.3d 296, 302 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.) (“In a bench trial, it\nis the duty of the trial court to pass on the credibility of the witnesses and on the weight to be given their\ntestimony.”).\n\n                                                      9\n\fTexas Rule of Evidence 803(6), the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting\nthese records. See id. We overrule Ainsworth’s first issue.\n\n       B.      Standing\n\n       Here, CACH asserts standing as an assignee of the debt-holder. An assignee stands\nin the assignor’s shoes and may assert those rights that the assignor could assert,\nincluding bringing suit. See Gulf Ins. Co. v. Burns Motors, Inc., 22 S.W.3d 417, 420\n(Tex. 2000); see also Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. Marketing on Hold Inc., 308 S.W.3d 909, 916\n(Tex. 2010) (holding that because class action representative held contractually valid\nassignments, representative stepped “into the shoes of the claim-holders and is considered\nunder the law to have suffered the same injury as the assignors and have the same ability\nto pursue the claims”). As evidence of its status as an assignee, CACH provided the\nbusiness-records affidavit described above. These documents establish that CACH has\nstanding to sue because Chase assigned its ownership interest in Ainsworth’s debt to\nCACH. Further, Ainsworth has not challenged Chase’s right to sue for recovery of this\ndebt. As the assignee of Chase, CACH was entitled to assert any rights Chase could\nassert, including bringing suit. Thus, Ainsworth’s second issue is without merit, and we\noverrule it.\n\n       C.      Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       In conducting a legal-sufficiency review, we must consider all of the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the verdict and indulge every reasonable inference that would\nsupport it. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 822 (Tex.2005). In determining\nwhether legally sufficient evidence supports the finding under review, we must consider\nevidence favorable to the finding if a reasonable fact-finder could consider it, and\ndisregard evidence contrary to the finding unless a reasonable fact-finder could not\ndisregard it. Id. at 821.\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f         The business-records affidavit, described above, provides legally sufficient\nevidence to support the trial court’s verdict. It establishes that Ainsworth incurred a credit\ncard debt, that he failed to pay it, and that this debt was ultimately acquired by CACH.\nAlthough Ainsworth denied applying for, receiving, using, and making payments on the\naccount at issue here, his credibility was an issue for the trier of fact. See, e.g., Grounds v.\nTolar Indep. Sch. Dist., 856 S.W.2d 417, 422 (Tex. 1993) (stating that trial court is\narbiter of both factual and legal issues in a non-jury trial); Cent. Forest S/C Partners, Ltd.\nv. Mundo-Mundo, Inc., 184 S.W.3d 296, 302 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.) (“In a\nbench trial, it is the duty of the trial court to pass on the credibility of the witnesses and\non the weight to be given their testimony.”). Because the record contains legally\nsufficient evidence to support the trial court’s verdict, we overrule Ainsworth’s fifth\nissue.\n\n                    Ainsworth’s Testimony Regarding Bank Records\n\n         In his third issue, Ainsworth asserts that the trial court should have sustained his\nobjection to his testimony regarding documents—the Wells Fargo statements—that were\nneither offered nor admitted into evidence. As described above, these documents\nconsisted of copies of Ainsworth’s banking records that he produced to CACH during\ndiscovery. To reiterate, we review a trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence\nunder an abuse-of-discretion standard. Bayer Corp., 214 S.W.3d at 609.\n\n         Ainsworth testified, without objection, that the Wells Fargo statements shown to\nhim by CACH’s counsel were his bank statements. He further acknowledged that these\nstatements reflected his name, his late wife’s name, and his mailing address, and that he\nhad seen these statements prior to trial. In fact, Ainsworth answered nine questions about\nthese documents before his counsel objected that he was “testifying to documents not in\nevidence.” Thus, Ainsworth’s objection was not timely. See Tex R. Evid. 103 (requiring a\ntimely objection to admission of evidence); Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) (same).\n\n         Further, CACH responded that the records were offered to refresh Ainsworth’s\nrecollection and impeach his credibility because he denied knowing about the debt at\n\n                                              11\n\fissue. See Tex. R. Evid. 612 (providing that a witness may use a writing to refresh his\nmemory, but that if so used, the adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at\nthe hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce portions\nof the writing into evidence relating to the witness’s testimony). Neither CACH nor\nAinsworth attempted to have these records admitted. The credibility of a witness may be\nattacked by any party, including the party calling the witness. Tex. R. Evid. 607. Under\nthese circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting\nAinsworth’s testimony regarding these documents. We overrule appellant’s third issue.\n\n                                    CACH’s Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In issue four, Ainsworth contends the trial court erred by allowing the testimony of\nCACH’s attorney, Richard Clark, regarding his fees. Specifically, Ainsworth asserts that,\nbecause Clark claimed a privileged fee-agreement contract with CACH, Clark should not\nhave been permitted to testify. Ainsworth further contends that CACH’s counsel failed to\nestablish any of the Arthur Anderson4 factors regarding the reasonableness and necessity\nof attorney’s fees. Finally, Ainsworth asserts that CACH failed to segregate its attorney’s\nfees between recoverable and non-recoverable claims.\n\n      Texas law prohibits recovery of attorney’s fees unless authorized by statute or\ncontract. Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 310 (Tex. 2006).\n“Reasonable” attorney’s fees are available to a prevailing party on a breach of contract\nclaim. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001(8) (West 2008). We review an award\nof attorney’s fees on the basis of breach of contract for an abuse of discretion. E.g.,\nLlanes v. Davila, 133 S.W.3d 635, 640 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2003, pet. denied)\n(citing Ragsdale v. Progressive Voters League, 801 S.W.2d 880, 881 (Tex. 1990) (per\ncuriam)). The test for an abuse of discretion is whether the trial court’s decision is\narbitrary or unreasonable. Id. (citing Beaumont Bank, N.A. v. Buller, 806 S.W.2d 223,\n226 (Tex. 1991)). Finally, although the trial court has discretion to fix the amount of\n\n\n      4\n          See Arthur Anderson & Co. v. Perrry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997).\n\n                                                  12\n\fattorney’s fees, it does not have discretion to deny attorney’s fees entirely if they are\nproper. Hassell Constr. Co., Inc. v. Stature Comm. Co., Inc., 162 S.W.3d 664, 668 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.).\n\n       Regarding Clark’s testimony, Ainsworth’s attorney lodged the following\nobjection:\n\n       Judge, I have some objections as to his testimony on attorney’s fees.\n       Nowhere at any point have they told us how much. We asked them for\n       time records in our request for production. He said they didn’t exist. We\n       asked for a copy of the contract. They claimed privilege. . . .\n       I would object to him offering any testimony on attorney’s fees,\n       whatsoever.\nClark responded that he was statutorily entitled to attorney’s fees, that he does not keep\ntime records on debt cases, and that he has a contingency fee of twenty-five percent. He\nfurther asserted that the information Ainsworth had requested contained attorney/client\ninformation that was privileged. The trial court overruled Ainsworth’s objection and\npermitted Clark to testify. Ainsworth has not established that the contingency-fee\nagreement was not protected by the attorney/client privilege. Accordingly, we see no\nabuse of discretion in the trial court’s ruling, and overrule this portion of Ainsworth’s\nfourth issue.\n\n       Turning to the reasonableness of Clark’s fees, he testified as follows:\n\n             He has been a licensed attorney since May of 1993;\n             He has prosecuted debt collections for the past eighteen years and knows what\n             other attorneys charge as reasonable fees;\n             The twenty-five percent contingency fee on the principle amount owed is\n             reasonable and necessary given the amount of work he put into this case;\n             He has “probably put in three times the amount” of time he usually puts into\n             debt collection cases in this case;\n             He considered all the work he put into this case to be recoverable, i.e., he did\n             not need to segregate his fees between his work on CACH’s breach of contract\n             claim and his work defending against Ainsworth’s counterclaims;\n             He does not keep hours on debt collection cases; and\n                                              13\n\f          He was requesting $1,507.13 in attorney’s fees.\nClark’s testimony covers some of the Arthur Anderson factors. For example, Clark\nestablished his experience in working on this type of case and explained that he was\naware of the customary fees charged locally for similar services. See Arthur Anderson &\nCo. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997) (listing eight factors a\nfactfinder should consider when determining the reasonableness of attorney’s facts). He\nfurther testified that this case required about three times the usual amount of time it takes\nhim to prosecute similar cases. Id.\n\n       Although not all the Arthur Anderson factors are addressed by Clark’s testimony,\na litigant is not required to present evidence on each of these factors. Acad. Corp. v.\nInterior Buildout & Turnkey Constr., Inc., 21 S.W.3d 732, 742 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.). The trier of fact may also look at the entire record, the\nevidence presented on reasonableness, the amount in controversy, the common\nknowledge of the participants as lawyers and judges, and the relative success of the\nparties in determining the reasonableness of the attorney’s fees. Id. Here, the trial judge\ndid not award Clark the full amount he requested ($1,507.13), instead awarding him only\n$1,150.00. We further note that, as discussed above, Ainsworth requested a substantially\nlarger sum for attorney’s fees—$5,120.00. Considering the above described testimony, as\nwell as the additional factors set forth in Academy Corporation listed above, we conclude\nthat the trial judge was within his discretion to award CACH $1,150.00 in attorney’s fees.\nWe overrule this portion of Ainsworth’s fourth issue.\n\n       Ainsworth next asserts in this issue that CACH was required to segregate its fees\nbetween its recoverable breach of contract fees and its unrecoverable fees on his\ncounterclaims. If any attorney’s fees relate solely to claims for which fees are not\nrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees. Tony Gullo\nMotors I, 212 S.W.3d at 313. “Intertwined facts do not make all attorney’s fees\nrecoverable; it is only when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\funrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they need not be segregated.” Id. at\n313–14.\n\n       Here, all the claims at issue before the trial court involved CACH’s successful\nbreach-of-contract claim. CACH’s claim and Ainsworth’s counterclaims depended upon\nthe same essential facts, using the same documents and witnesses. See id. at 314. Hence,\nthe legal work performed by CACH’s attorney advanced both the prosecution of its\nbreach-of-contract claim and the defense of Ainsworth’s counterclaims. The legal work\nperformed by CACH’s attorney advanced both recoverable and nonrecoverable claims.\nSee id. at 313–14; cf. 7979 Airport Garage, L.L.C. v. Dollar Rent a Car Sys., Inc., 245\nS.W.3d 488, 507–09 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied) (concluding\nthat fees incurred in defending against counterclaims did not have to be segregated from\nthose incurred in prosecuting breach-of-contract claim because claims and counterclaims\ndepended on same essential facts, relied on same documents and witnesses, and appellee\nhad to defeat appellant’s claims before it could recover). Under these circumstances, we\nconclude that CACH was not required to segregate its attorney’s fees. We overrule\nAinsworth’s fourth issue in its entirety.\n\n                               Ainsworth’s Counterclaims\n\n       In his sixth and final issue, Ainsworth contends that the trial court erred by\ndenying his counterclaim. The totality of his argument on this issue is as follows:\n\n       As stated above, if the Court had properly excluded CACH’s evidence,\n       there would have been no evidence of CACH’s claim; therefore, the\n       Counterclaim, of which there was evidence of, would lie.\n       The Trial Court erred by denying the Counterclaim of Ainsworth.\n       The Court of Appeals, in reversing and rendering that CACH should take\n       nothing should therefore also render this issue of Ainsworth’s\n       Counterclaim.\n       No legal authority or record references are provided for this issue. Accordingly, it\nhas not been properly briefed, and it is waived. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i) (“The brief\nmust contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions made, with appropriate\n\n                                            15\n\fcitations to authorities and to the record.”); Priddy v. Rawson, 282 S.W.3d 588, 596, 601\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, pet. denied). Accordingly, this issue presents\nnothing for our review and is overruled.\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n\n      Having overruled each of Ainsworth’s issues, we affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                           /s/    Adele Hedges\n                                                  Chief Justice\n\n\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Hedges and Justices Jamison and McCally.\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f",

Ainsworth, Jr. challenges a\njudgment in favor of appellee CACH, LLC. Ainsworth contends that (a) the trial court\nerroneously admitted a business-records affidavit, (b) CACH lacked standing to sue,\n(c) the trial court abused its discretion by permitting Ainsworth to testify regarding\ndocuments not in evidence, (d) attorney’s fees were not proven by CACH, (e) the\nevidence is legally insufficient to support the verdict, and (f) the trial court erred by\ndenying Ainsworth’s counterclaims. We affirm.\n\f                                     BACKGROUND\n\n       In October 2009, CACH sued Ainsworth to recover a credit card debt attributed to\nAinsworth. CACH had acquired the debt from Chase Bank USA, N.A. In September\n2010, Ainsworth answered with a sworn denial, stating that CACH’s claims were not\ntrue, that he did not owe the amount CACH claimed he owed, and that he had never\napplied for, received, used, or authorized anyone to use the credit card at issue. He also\nasserted the affirmative defenses of statute of limitations, fraud, statute of frauds,\npayment, estoppel, failure of consideration, and usury. He further challenged CACH’s\nstanding to sue and averred that he had not received a pre-suit demand. Finally, he\ncounterclaimed under the DTPA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Texas\nFinance Code.\n\n       During discovery, CACH sought copies of Ainsworth’s personal Wells Fargo\nbank account statements for the period from April 1, 2007 through April 30, 2008 (the\n“Wells Fargo statements”). After being sanctioned for failing to produce these\ndocuments, Ainsworth produced them to CACH.\n\n       At the bench trial conducted on March 22, 2011, Ainsworth challenged CACH’s\nstanding to pursue collection of this account. In response, CACH asserted that it had\nstanding as an assignee of the original holder of the account. The trial court admitted,\nover a variety of Ainsworth’s objections, a business-records affidavit signed by CACH\nemployee Maria Hwang on November 9, 2010, with several attachments incorporated\ntherein (the “business-records affidavit”). In this affidavit, Hwang states:\n\n          1. I am the Authorized Agent and custodian of the records of Plaintiff\n             and am familiar with the Plaintiff’s business processes. Business\n             records are kept and maintained in the ordinary course of Plaintiff's\n             business (“Records”) concerning accounts like the account of the\n             Defendant. The Records are made and maintained by individuals\n             who have a business duty to make entries in the Records accurately\n             at or near the time of the event that they record, or reasonably soon\n             thereafter, by or from information transmitted by someone with\n             personal knowledge of the event or act.\n                                              2\n\f                        2. In addition, it is Plaintiff’s regular business practice to obtain,\n                           integrate, and rely upon documents prepared by the original creditor\n                           of the account at issue. In this particular action, Plaintiff has\n                           obtained and integrated documents received from the original\n                           creditor, CHASE BANK USA, N.A. successor in interest to\n                           WASH1NGTON MUTUAL/PROVIDIAN BANK. Plaintiff relies\n                           upon the accuracy of such documentation in its day to day business\n                           activities and such documents are considered Records of the\n                           Plaintiff. The records consist of both hard copy information and\n                           electronic information that is generated, stored and maintained by\n                           the original creditor in accordance with generally accepted standards\n                           in the retail and financial industries by individuals that possess the\n                           knowledge and training necessary to ensure the accuracy and\n                           reliability of the records.

In this affidavit, Hwang states:\n\n                        1. I am an authorized agent for and a custodian of the records of\n                           CACH, LLC.\n                        2. As authorized agent and custodian of the business records for\n                           Plaintiff, I have personal knowledge based upon the review of the\n                           documentation provided by the original creditor (attached hereto)\n                           that, after all just and lawful offsets, payments, and credits have been\n\n\n                                                                    3\n\f             allowed, the total balance on the account of $4,567.07 is just and\n             true and is due and owing from Defendant to Plaintiff.\n          3. The total amount of $4,567.07 is based on the amount due at the\n             time of placement of the account with plaintiff of $4,567.07 and post\n             placement interest of $0 which accrues at an interest rate of 0%\n             based on the documentation provided by the original creditor and\n             attached hereto.\n          4. The records attached hereto are the original or exact duplicates of the\n             original.\n          5. Demand for payment of the just amount owing Plaintiff by\n             Defendant was made upon the Defendant more than thirty (30) days\n             prior to filing of plaintiff’s original petition, and payment for the just\n             amount owing has not been tendered.\n\n      Also attached to the business-records affidavit is an “Affidavit of Sale” signed by\nWendy Baldwin of Chase, in which she states:\n\n      I am authorized on behalf of Chase Bank USA, N .A. (“Chase”) to make\n      this affidavit.\n      JP Morgan Chase & Co. (“JP Morgan”) purchased certain credit card\n      receivables originated by Washington Mutual Bank through the FDIC,\n      which receivables were assigned to Chase.\n      JAMES O AINSWORTH JR had credit card account number\n      4559962400404685 with Washington Mutual Bank, and that Account was\n      one of the receivables transferred to Chase as described in paragraph 2.\n      Chase sold the Account to CACH, LLC. on or about 12/22/2008. At the\n      time of the sale to CACH, LLC., the amount due on the account pursuant to\n      the terms of the applicable cardholder agreement by JAMES O\n      AINSWORTH JR was $4,567.07.\n      Your deponent states that to the best of deponent’s knowledge, information\n      and belief that there was no unaccredited payment, just counterclaims or\n      offsets against the account when it was sold.\n      Chase has no further interest in said account for any purpose.\nSeveral copies of statements from Washington Mutual Card Services reflecting Providian\naccount number 4559-9624-0040-4685 and addressed to James O. Ainsworth Jr., 1613\nFrost St., Rosenberg, TX 77471-4214 are also attached to the business-records affidavit.\nThe first of these statements has a closing date of February 13, 2008 and reflects a\n\n                                              4\n\fbalance due of $3,487.01 and a payment received of $150.00. The second statement lists\nthe closing date as April 15, 2008, reflects various charges made and a payment of\n$150.00, and shows a closing balance of $3,607.08. The third statement shows the\nclosing date as November 13, 2008 and reflects a closing balance of $4,567.07. Finally,\ncopies of Providian Bank Visa and MasterCard account agreements are attached to the\nbusiness-records affidavit, although these copies are nearly illegible and unsigned by\nAinsworth.\n\n       After the business-records affidavit was admitted, CACH called Ainsworth, who\ntestified that he had never received, used or authorized the use of, or made payments on a\nWashington Mutual/Providian Bank credit card. He acknowledged that the credit card\nstatements admitted as part of the business-records affidavit were addressed to him at his\nresidence. He agreed that the Wells Fargo statements shown to him by CACH’s counsel\nwere the statements he had produced to CACH during discovery. He further\nacknowledged that the Wells Fargo bank statement dated March 6 through April 4, 2007\nreflected his name, his late wife’s name, and his mailing address, and that he had seen\nthese statements prior to trial.\n\n       When CACH asked him to acknowledge that on March 6, 2007, “a payment to\nWaMu PVN., WaMu Providian, payment on credit card” for $150.00 was shown on the\nWells Fargo statement, Ainsworth’s counsel objected that CACH was questioning\nAinsworth about documents not in evidence. The trial court overruled the objection.\nAinsworth then denied that he had made the payment reflected on his bank statement. He\ndid, however, agree that a payment attributed to his late wife, Gayle L. Ainsworth, was\nmade on the same day, which was reflected on the statement. He further acknowledged\nthat a direct deposit from his employer appeared on the statement.\n\n       CACH asked about another of Ainsworth’s bank statements, seeking\nacknowledgment from Ainsworth that he had made a payment on April 3, 2007, to\nWaMu Providian. Ainsworth’s counsel objected that CACH was asking Ainsworth again\nto testify from a document not in evidence. The trial court overruled the objection, stating\n\n                                             5\n\fthat the document was provided to CACH’s counsel. Ainsworth’s counsel obtained a\nrunning objection to “this document.” Ainsworth again denied making the payment\nshown on his bank statement, although he agreed that the statement reflected a payment\nto WaMu Providian for $125.00 made on April 3, 2007 with his name on it. He also\ndenied having seen or reviewed any of his bank statements from April 2007 to April\n2008. He further stated that he “had no idea” that, for seven years, statements were being\nsent to his house showing a debt on the credit card. He further denied having received\nseveral collection calls from various individuals regarding this credit card debt.\n\n       On cross-examination, Ainsworth testified that his late wife, Gayle, was\nresponsible for paying the bills. He again denied ever applying for, receiving, or using the\ncredit card at issue here. He further denied speaking with anyone from CACH regarding\nthe credit card account. He testified that he knew nothing about this credit card debt until\nhe received a letter from CACH’s counsel that he needed to appear for court regarding\nthe debt. He stated, “Well, it was really upsetting to me because I didn’t know anything\nabout it. Here I am being sued for a credit card I never used or knew about.”\n\n       CACH’s counsel, Richard Clark, testified, over Ainsworth’s objection, regarding\nhis fees. He stated that he billed his debt-collection clients, including CACH, on a\ntwenty-five percent contingency basis of the amount collected. Clark explained that his\ntwenty-five percent contingency fee on the principal amount owed is reasonable and\nnecessary given the amount of work he puts into a case. When cross-examined about his\ntime, Clark admitted that he did not keep time records because he worked on a\ncontingency basis. He further acknowledged that he did not segregate his time between\nCACH’s claims and the defenses and counterclaims of Ainsworth. He stated that his fee\nin this case was $1,507.13.1 Ainsworth’s counsel, Betsy Grubbs, testified regarding her\nhourly rates and that a reasonable and necessary fee for this case would be $5,120.00. She\nalso testified regarding appellate fees. The trial court took the matter under advisement.\n\n\n       1\n           This amount is greater than twenty-five percent of the principal amount owed in this debt case.\n\n                                                     6\n\f         On May 4, 2011, the trial court signed a judgment in favor of CACH, awarding\nCACH $4,567.07 in damages, $1,150.00 in attorney’s fees, five-percent post-judgment\ninterest, and court costs. It dismissed all of Ainsworth’s counterclaims with prejudice.\nAinsworth filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law, but our record does\nnot contain these findings. This appeal timely ensued.\n\n                                 The Business-Records Affidavit\n\n         Because Ainsworth’s first, second, and fifth issues relate to the trial court’s\nadmission of the business-records affidavit, we address these issues together. In issue\none, Ainsworth contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the\nbusiness-records affidavit. Next, Ainsworth asserts that the trial court erred in concluding\nthat CACH had standing to pursue this claim. Finally, in issue five, Ainsworth contends\nthat, excluding the inadmissible evidence, there is no evidence to support the judgment.\nOrdinarily, we would address the standing issue first, as it relates to the trial court’s\njurisdiction.2 But these issues all turn on the admissibility of the business-records\naffidavit because it establishes CACH’s standing and provides legally sufficient evidence\nto support the trial court’s verdict. Thus, we address the admissibility of this affidavit\nfirst.\n\n         A.     Admissibility of the Business-Records Affidavit\n\n         Ainsworth challenged the admission of the business-records affidavit and\nsupporting documentation on numerous grounds, including hearsay and that the\nsupporting documents were unreliable and not trustworthy. The admission and exclusion\nof evidence are within the sound discretion of the trial court. Bayer Corp. v.

App.—\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. ref’d)).\n\n       The business-records affidavit, described above, meets these criteria. Hwang\nstated that she is the custodian of records for CACH and that it is CACH’s “regular\nbusiness practice to obtain, integrate and rely upon documents prepared by the original\n\n                                              8\n\fcreditor of the account at issue.” She further averred that CACH relies on the accuracy of\nthe documents in its day-to-day business activities and that the records are made and\nmaintained by individuals who have a duty to keep the record accurately at or near the\ntime of the event that they record. Finally, one of the documents attached to the business-\nrecords affidavit is the “affidavit of sale,” which is notarized. Such a notarized document\nis self-authenticating under the Texas Rules of Evidence. See Tex. R. Evid. 902(8). In\nthis document, described above, an authorized agent of Chase Bank, N.A., stated that\nChase had acquired Ainsworth’s account from Washington Mutual Bank, sold it to\nCACH in December 2008, and that the amount due on the account at the time of the sale\nwas $4,567.07. Chase’s failure to keep accurate records could result in criminal or civil\npenalties. See Tex. Fin. Code Ann. § 392.304(a)(8) (prohibiting misrepresentations of\namount of consumer debt); id. § 392.402 (providing for criminal penalties for violations\nof chapter 392 of Texas Finance Code); see also Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15\nU.S.C.A. § 1692e(2)(a) (prohibiting misrepresentation of amount of debt); id. § 1692l\n(providing for administrative enforcement of Administrative Debt Collection Practices\nAct). These circumstances otherwise indicate the trustworthiness of the Chase Bank\ndocuments.3 See Simien, 321 S.W.3d at 243–44. Accordingly, because the business-\nrecords affidavit at issue here meets the criteria for admission as business records under\n\n\n        3\n           Ainsworth mistakenly relies on Old Republic, a case from the First Court of Appeals, for the\nproposition that documents under the business records exception to the hearsay rule generally come in\nfully proven, unless contract execution is challenged by verified denial.

As evidence of its status as an assignee, CACH provided the\nbusiness-records affidavit described above. These documents establish that CACH has\nstanding to sue because Chase assigned its ownership interest in Ainsworth’s debt to\nCACH. Further, Ainsworth has not challenged Chase’s right to sue for recovery of this\ndebt. As the assignee of Chase, CACH was entitled to assert any rights Chase could\nassert, including bringing suit.

It establishes that Ainsworth incurred a credit\ncard debt, that he failed to pay it, and that this debt was ultimately acquired by CACH.\nAlthough Ainsworth denied applying for, receiving, using, and making payments on the\naccount at issue here, his credibility was an issue for the trier of fact.

Because the record contains legally\nsufficient evidence to support the trial court’s verdict, we overrule Ainsworth’s fifth\nissue.\n\n                    Ainsworth’s Testimony Regarding Bank Records\n\n         In his third issue, Ainsworth asserts that the trial court should have sustained his\nobjection to his testimony regarding documents—the Wells Fargo statements—that were\nneither offered nor admitted into evidence. As described above, these documents\nconsisted of copies of Ainsworth’s banking records that he produced to CACH during\ndiscovery. To reiterate, we review a trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence\nunder an abuse-of-discretion standard. Bayer Corp., 214 S.W.3d at 609.\n\n         Ainsworth testified, without objection, that the Wells Fargo statements shown to\nhim by CACH’s counsel were his bank statements. He further acknowledged that these\nstatements reflected his name, his late wife’s name, and his mailing address, and that he\nhad seen these statements prior to trial. In fact, Ainsworth answered nine questions about\nthese documents before his counsel objected that he was “testifying to documents not in\nevidence.” Thus, Ainsworth’s objection was not timely. See Tex R. Evid. 103 (requiring a\ntimely objection to admission of evidence); Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) (same).\n\n         Further, CACH responded that the records were offered to refresh Ainsworth’s\nrecollection and impeach his credibility because he denied knowing about the debt at\n\n                                              11\n\fissue. See Tex. R. Evid. 612 (providing that a witness may use a writing to refresh his\nmemory, but that if so used, the adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at\nthe hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce portions\nof the writing into evidence relating to the witness’s testimony). Neither CACH nor\nAinsworth attempted to have these records admitted. The credibility of a witness may be\nattacked by any party, including the party calling the witness. Tex. R. Evid. 607. Under\nthese circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting\nAinsworth’s testimony regarding these documents. We overrule appellant’s third issue.\n\n                                    CACH’s Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In issue four, Ainsworth contends the trial court erred by allowing the testimony of\nCACH’s attorney, Richard Clark, regarding his fees. Specifically, Ainsworth asserts that,\nbecause Clark claimed a privileged fee-agreement contract with CACH, Clark should not\nhave been permitted to testify. Ainsworth further contends that CACH’s counsel failed to\nestablish any of the Arthur Anderson4 factors regarding the reasonableness and necessity\nof attorney’s fees. Finally, Ainsworth asserts that CACH failed to segregate its attorney’s\nfees between recoverable and non-recoverable claims.\n\n      Texas law prohibits recovery of attorney’s fees unless authorized by statute or\ncontract.

We asked them for\n       time records in our request for production. He said they didn’t exist. We\n       asked for a copy of the contract. They claimed privilege. . . .\n       I would object to him offering any testimony on attorney’s fees,\n       whatsoever.\nClark responded that he was statutorily entitled to attorney’s fees, that he does not keep\ntime records on debt cases, and that he has a contingency fee of twenty-five percent. He\nfurther asserted that the information Ainsworth had requested contained attorney/client\ninformation that was privileged. The trial court overruled Ainsworth’s objection and\npermitted Clark to testify. Ainsworth has not established that the contingency-fee\nagreement was not protected by the attorney/client privilege. Accordingly, we see no\nabuse of discretion in the trial court’s ruling, and overrule this portion of Ainsworth’s\nfourth issue.\n\n       Turning to the reasonableness of Clark’s fees, he testified as follows:\n\n             He has been a licensed attorney since May of 1993;\n             He has prosecuted debt collections for the past eighteen years and knows what\n             other attorneys charge as reasonable fees;\n             The twenty-five percent contingency fee on the principle amount owed is\n             reasonable and necessary given the amount of work he put into this case;\n             He has “probably put in three times the amount” of time he usually puts into\n             debt collection cases in this case;\n             He considered all the work he put into this case to be recoverable, i.e., he did\n             not need to segregate his fees between his work on CACH’s breach of contract\n             claim and his work defending against Ainsworth’s counterclaims;\n             He does not keep hours on debt collection cases; and\n                                              13\n\f          He was requesting $1,507.13 in attorney’s fees.\nClark’s testimony covers some of the Arthur Anderson factors. For example, Clark\nestablished his experience in working on this type of case and explained that he was\naware of the customary fees charged locally for similar services. See Arthur Anderson &\nCo. v. Perry Equip. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427543\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427543/arthur-andersen-v-perry-equipment-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818 (Tex. 1997) (listing eight factors a\nfactfinder should consider when determining the reasonableness of attorney’s facts). He\nfurther testified that this case required about three times the usual amount of time it takes\nhim to prosecute similar cases. Id.\n\n       Although not all the Arthur Anderson factors are addressed by Clark’s testimony,\na litigant is not required to present evidence on each of these factors. Acad. Corp. v.\nInterior Buildout & Turnkey Constr., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1871140\"><a href=\"/opinion/1871140/academy-v-interior-buildout-turnkey/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">732</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 742 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.). The trier of fact may also look at the entire record, the\nevidence presented on reasonableness, the amount in controversy, the common\nknowledge of the participants as lawyers and judges, and the relative success of the\nparties in determining the reasonableness of the attorney’s fees. Id. Here, the trial judge\ndid not award Clark the full amount he requested ($1,507.13), instead awarding him only\n$1,150.00. We further note that, as discussed above, Ainsworth requested a substantially\nlarger sum for attorney’s fees—$5,120.00. Considering the above described testimony, as\nwell as the additional factors set forth in Academy Corporation listed above, we conclude\nthat the trial judge was within his discretion to award CACH $1,150.00 in attorney’s fees.\nWe overrule this portion of Ainsworth’s fourth issue.\n\n       Ainsworth next asserts in this issue that CACH was required to segregate its fees\nbetween its recoverable breach of contract fees and its unrecoverable fees on his\ncounterclaims. If any attorney’s fees relate solely to claims for which fees are not\nrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees. Tony Gullo\nMotors I, 212 S.W.3d at 313. “Intertwined facts do not make all attorney’s fees\nrecoverable; it is only when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\funrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they need not be segregated.” Id. at\n313–14.\n\n       Here, all the claims at issue before the trial court involved CACH’s successful\nbreach-of-contract claim. CACH’s claim and Ainsworth’s counterclaims depended upon\nthe same essential facts, using the same documents and witnesses. See id. at 314. Hence,\nthe legal work performed by CACH’s attorney advanced both the prosecution of its\nbreach-of-contract claim and the defense of Ainsworth’s counterclaims. The legal work\nperformed by CACH’s attorney advanced both recoverable and nonrecoverable claims.\nSee id. at 313–14; cf. 7979 Airport Garage, L.L.C. v.

Under these circumstances, we\nconclude that CACH was not required to segregate its attorney’s fees. We overrule\nAinsworth’s fourth issue in its entirety.\n\n                               Ainsworth’s Counterclaims\n\n       In his sixth and final issue, Ainsworth contends that the trial court erred by\ndenying his counterclaim. The totality of his argument on this issue is as follows:\n\n       As stated above, if the Court had properly excluded CACH’s evidence,\n       there would have been no evidence of CACH’s claim; therefore, the\n       Counterclaim, of which there was evidence of, would lie.\n       The Trial Court erred by denying the Counterclaim of Ainsworth.\n       The Court of Appeals, in reversing and rendering that CACH should take\n       nothing should therefore also render this issue of Ainsworth’s\n       Counterclaim.\n       No legal authority or record references are provided for this issue. Accordingly, it\nhas not been properly briefed, and it is waived. See Tex. R.
