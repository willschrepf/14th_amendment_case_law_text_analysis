I respectfully dissent. Until today, this court\nhas never held that an interlocutory order that requires\na determination of the best interests of the child was\nnot immediately appealable. In fact, ‘‘[t]his court has a\nlong history of concluding that, within the context of\nfamily matters, orders that would otherwise be consid-\nered interlocutory constitute appealable final judg-\nments.’’ Khan v. Hillyer, 306 Conn. 205, 213, 49 A.3d\n996 (2012). The statute governing the discretionary\ntransfer of cases from the juvenile matters docket to the\nregular criminal docket of the Superior Court, General\nStatutes (Supp. 2014) § 46b-127 (b) (1) (C),1 requires\nthe judge to consider, inter alia, whether ‘‘the best inter-\nests of the child and the public will not be served by\nmaintaining the case in the superior court for juvenile\nmatters.’’ I see no reason to abandon our long-standing\nprecedent of holding that an otherwise interlocutory\norder that involves a determination of the ‘‘best inter-\nests of the child’’ is immediately appealable where there\nis no clear legislative mandate to the contrary. There-\nfore, I respectfully dissent.\n   The majority holds that, in light of the genealogy of\n§ 46b-127, coupled with the relevant legislative history,\nit is clear that the legislature did not intend for the\ndiscretionary transfer of a juvenile from juvenile court\nto adult court based upon a C, D, E or unclassified\nfelony to be a final judgment. I disagree. The majority\nconcludes that ‘‘the clear intent of the legislature is to\nprohibit interlocutory appeals from discretionary trans-\nfer orders.’’ The majority continues: ‘‘We agree with the\nstate that the legislature expressed a clear intent to\nprohibit the immediate appeal of discretionary transfer\norders. As we explain herein, although the current statu-\ntory text of § 46b-127 does not resolve the question of\nwhether a discretionary transfer order constitutes a\nfinal judgment for purposes of appeal, we conclude, on\nthe basis of the genealogy of the transfer provisions,\nread together with this court’s interpretation of the\nlegislative intent evident from the prior amendments\nto those provisions, that under the current statutory\nlanguage a discretionary transfer order cannot be imme-\ndiately appealed. This interpretation of the discretion-\nary transfer provision results in a harmonious and\nconsistent body of law with respect to all of the transfer\nprovisions currently contained in § 46b-127.’’ I respect-\nfully disagree.\n  Furthermore, I disagree with the majority’s failure to\nanalyze the question of whether an order under § 46b-\n127 (b) (1) is immediately appealable under State v.\nCurcio, 191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). Despite\nacknowledging that the statute is silent as to whether\n\fthe transfer order is immediately appealable, and\nacknowledging that it is necessary to resort to legisla-\ntive history to interpret the statute, the majority fails\nto engage in the analysis required by Curcio.\n   In my view, statutory language currently set forth in\n§ 46b-127 is completely different from previous ver-\nsions, the legislative history is silent on the issue of\nthe finality of the judgment, our philosophy toward\njuveniles has changed in recent years, and United States\nSupreme Court case law has changed. Furthermore, this\ncourt has routinely held that, where the best interests of\nthe child are a consideration, an otherwise interlocutory\nruling must be considered a final judgment. I disagree\nwith the majority that reading § 46b-127 (b) (1) in con-\nnection with other transfer statutes mandates a conclu-\nsion that the legislature clearly intended that a transfer\norder under § 46b-127 (b) (1) is not immediately appeal-\nable. Rather, I would read § 46b-127 (b) (1) in a manner\nconsistent with other statutes under which this court\nhas considered the best interests of the child and uni-\nformly held that otherwise interlocutory orders were\nimmediately appealable under the second prong of Cur-\ncio. Therefore, I would conclude that since § 46b-127\n(b) (1) is silent as to whether a transfer is immediately\nappealable, and that, under the second prong of Curcio,\nthe discretionary transfer of a juvenile from the Supe-\nrior Court for juvenile matters to adult court is immedi-\nately appealable because such a transfer so concludes\nthe rights of the juveniles such that further proceedings\ncannot affect them. Accordingly, I would conclude that\na juvenile may immediately appeal from an order under\n§ 46b-127 (b) (1) and that the juvenile is entitled to a\nstay of that order pending appeal.\n   I agree with the factual and procedural history set\nforth by the majority in its opinion. I agree with the\nmajority that, in the first instance, ‘‘[w]hether the legis-\nlature intended discretionary transfer orders issued pur-\nsuant to § 46b-127 (b) (1) to be final judgments for\npurposes of appeal presents a question of statutory\ninterpretation over which we exercise plenary review.\nSee Ugrin v. Cheshire, 307 Conn. 364, 379, 54 A.3d 532\n(2012). When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental\nobjective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent\nintent of the legislature. . . . In other words, we seek\nto determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the\nstatutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case,\nincluding the question of whether the language actually\ndoes apply. . . . In seeking to determine that meaning,\nGeneral Statutes § 1-2z directs us first to consider the\ntext of the statute itself and its relationship to other\nstatutes. If, after examining such text and considering\nsuch relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and\nunambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable\nresults, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the\nstatute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is\nnot plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpre-\n\ftive guidance to the legislative history and circum-\nstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative\npolicy it was designed to implement, and to its relation-\nship to existing legislation and common law principles\ngoverning the same general subject matter . . . . Kas-\nica v. Columbia, 309 Conn. 85, 93, 70 A.3d 1 (2013).’’\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   I would add, however, the following regarding final\njudgments: ‘‘The jurisdiction of the appellate courts is\nrestricted to appeals from judgments that are final. Gen-\neral Statutes §§ 51-197a and 52-263; Practice Book § [61-\n1] . . . . The policy concerns underlying the final judg-\nment rule are to discourage piecemeal appeals and to\nfacilitate the speedy and orderly disposition of cases\nat the trial court level. . . . The appellate courts have\na duty to dismiss, even on [their] own initiative, any\nappeal that [they lack] jurisdiction to hear. . . . In\nsome instances, however, it is unclear whether an order\nis an appealable final judgment. In the gray area\nbetween judgments which are undoubtedly final and\nothers that are clearly interlocutory . . . this court has\nadopted the following test, applicable to both criminal\nand civil proceedings: An otherwise interlocutory order\nis appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order\nor action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding,\nor (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights\nof the parties that further proceedings cannot affect\nthem. State v. Curcio, [supra, 191 Conn. 31]. . . . Solo-\nmon v. Keiser, 212 Conn. 741, 745–46, 562 A.2d 524\n(1989).’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Canty v.\nOtto, 304 Conn. 546, 554–55, 41 A.3d 280 (2012).\n   With these principles in mind, and in accordance\nwith § 1-2z, I begin with the text of the statute. General\nStatutes (Supp. 2014) § 46b-127 (b) (1) provides as fol-\nlows: ‘‘Upon motion of a prosecutorial official, the supe-\nrior court for juvenile matters shall conduct a hearing\nto determine whether the case of any child charged\nwith the commission of a class C, D or E felony or an\nunclassified felony shall be transferred from the docket\nfor juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket of\nthe Superior Court. The court shall not order that the\ncase be transferred under this subdivision unless the\ncourt finds that (A) such offense was committed after\nsuch child attained the age of fourteen years, (B) there\nis probable cause to believe the child has committed\nthe act for which the child is charged, and (C) the best\ninterests of the child and the public will not be served\nby maintaining the case in the superior court for juvenile\nmatters. In making such findings, the court shall con-\nsider (i) any prior criminal or juvenile offenses commit-\nted by the child, (ii) the seriousness of such offenses,\n(iii) any evidence that the child has intellectual disabil-\nity or mental illness, and (iv) the availability of services\nin the docket for juvenile matters that can serve the\nchild’s needs. Any motion under this subdivision shall\nbe made, and any hearing under this subdivision shall\n\fbe held, not later than thirty days after the child is\narraigned in the superior court for juvenile matters.’’\nThe statute itself then is silent as to whether it is a final\njudgment for purposes of appeal.\n   Nevertheless, when considering § 46b-127 (b) (1) in\nrelation to the rest of that statute, I note that in General\nStatutes (Supp. 2014) § 46b-127 (f) the legislature did\nexplicitly provide that ‘‘[t]he decision of the court con-\ncerning the transfer of a youth’s case from the youthful\noffender docket, regular criminal docket of the Superior\nCourt or any docket for the presentment of defendants\nin motor vehicle matters shall not be a final judgment\nfor purposes of appeal.’’ I would conclude that the legis-\nlature’s decision to include language in § 46b-127 (f)\nexplicitly providing that a transfer under that subsec-\ntion is not a final judgment for purposes of appeal\nindicates that the legislature knows how to include such\nlanguage if it chooses to do so, and the fact that it did\nnot do so in § 46b-127 (b) (1) suggests that the legisla-\nture may have intended for the other transfers to be\nfinal judgments for purposes of an appeal. As we have\nfrequently stated, ‘‘it is a well settled principle of statu-\ntory construction that the legislature knows how to\nconvey its intent expressly; e.g., Dept. of Public Safety\nv. Freedom of Information Commission, 298 Conn.\n703, 729, 6 A.3d 763 (2010); or to use broader or limiting\nterms when it chooses to do so. See, e.g., Stitzer v.\nRinaldi’s Restaurant, 211 Conn. 116, 119, 557 A.2d 1256\n(1989).’’ Scholastic Book Clubs, Inc. v. Commissioner\nof Revenue Services, 304 Conn. 204, 219, 38 A.3d 1183,\ncert. denied,      U.S.      , 133 S. Ct. 425, 184 L. Ed. 2d\n255 (2012).\n   The state asserts, however, that the absence of any\nlanguage indicating that a transfer pursuant to § 46b-\n127 (b) (1) is a final judgment for purposes of appeal\nindicates that the legislature intended that it not be a\nfinal judgment for purposes of appeal. The state asserts\nthat an interlocutory order is only appealable if the\nlegislature chooses to make it so in the statutory lan-\nguage and we cannot read such language into a statute.\nBecause I find that § 46b-127 (b) (1) is subject to two\nreasonable interpretations regarding whether a transfer\npursuant to that section constitutes a final judgment\nfor purposes of appeal, I would conclude that § 46b-127\n(b) (1) is ambiguous, and, therefore, resort to legislative\nhistory and extratextual sources.\n   I begin with the history of § 46b-127 (b) (1). In In re\nJuvenile Appeal (85–AB), 195 Conn. 303, 306, 488 A.2d\n778 (1985), this court first considered whether an order\ntransferring a case from the juvenile docket to the regu-\nlar criminal docket was a final judgment for the pur-\nposes of appeal. In that case, this court held that such\nan order does not: (1) constitute a final judgment for\nthe purpose of appellate review; or (2) fall within the\nexceptions to the final judgment rule outlined in Curcio.\n\fId., 306–307. At that time, the statute governing the\ndiscretionary transfer of juvenile cases to the regular\ncriminal docket, General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) § 46b-\n126,2 required a judge to determine that the juvenile\nhad attained the age of fourteen, find probable cause,\nand determine that the nature of the charge qualified\nfor transfer. I note that the respondent in In re Juvenile\nAppeal (85–AB) did not argue that the transfer order\nwas a final judgment, only that one of the Curcio excep-\ntions applied. In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB), supra,\n307. It cannot be disputed that, since the date of that\ndecision, American jurisprudence regarding juveniles\nhas undergone tremendous change motivated by the\nprevailing scientific understanding of adolescents’ cog-\nnitive development. As a result of this new understand-\ning, Connecticut has now classified both sixteen year\nolds and seventeen year olds as juveniles. See Public\nActs, Spec. Sess., June, 2007, No. 07-4, § 73.\n  The statute considered in In re Juvenile Appeal (85–\nAB), General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) § 46b-126, like\nthe current version of § 46b-127 (b) (1), contained no\nlanguage indicating the legislature’s intent to either per-\nmit or forbid interlocutory appeals of transfers. Accord-\ningly, this court did not engage in any analysis of\nwhether the legislature intended to allow interlocutory\nappeals, instead concluding that the transfer was not\na final judgment and, therefore, should be analyzed\nunder the exceptions to the final judgment rule set forth\nin Curcio.\n   Since our decision in the case of In re Juvenile Appeal\n(85–AB), the legislature has made various changes to\nthe statutory language governing the discretionary\ntransfer of juvenile cases to the regular criminal docket.\nInitially, the legislature responded to this court’s deci-\nsion in In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB) by adding explicit\nstatutory language making such transfers immediately\nappealable. See Public Acts 1986, No. 86-185, § 1; see\nalso In re Michael S., 258 Conn. 621, 624 n.3, 784 A.2d\n317 (2001). Specifically, the amendment added language\nproviding that ‘‘[a]n order by the court under this sec-\ntion transferring a child from the docket for juvenile\nmatters to the regular criminal docket of the superior\ncourt shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.’’\nPublic Act 86-185, § 1.\n   In 1994, the legislature convened a special session to\naddress gun violence and, therein, undertook a revision\nof the statute governing mandatory transfers in relation\nto certain gun related offenses. See Public Acts, Spec.\nSess., July, 1994, No. 94-2, § 6. The revised statute did\nnot explicitly bar interlocutory appeals, but omitted the\nfinal judgment language that the legislature had added\nin 1986. Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-2, § 6. In 1995, the legislature\nmoved the statutory language governing discretionary\ntransfers from § 46b-126 (a) to § 46b-127 (b). See foot-\nnote 2 of this opinion. In the course of making this\n\famendment, the legislature again chose to omit the final\njudgment language that was added in 1986. Public Acts\n1995, No. 95-225, §§ 13 and 39. The majority suggests\nthat the removal of the final judgment language from\n§ 46b-127 indicates an intention by the legislature to\nabandon the final judgment rule it put into place in\n1986. In many instances, I would find this argument\npersuasive. See State v. Johnson, 227 Conn. 534, 543,\n630 A.2d 1059 (1993) (‘‘[w]hen the legislature amends\nthe language of a statute, it is presumed that it intended\nto change the meaning of the statute and to accomplish\nsome purpose’’). This court has recognized many times,\nhowever, that some statutory amendments may be\nstructural or linguistic and not substantive. See Gon-\nsalves v. West Haven, 232 Conn. 17, 24, 653 A.2d 156\n(1995) (listing cases in which general rule presuming\nthat legislature intended to change meaning of statute\nwas not applied).\n    The 1986 amendment that made transfers subject to\nan interlocutory appeal evinced the intention of the\nlegislature unequivocally; it added specific language to\nthe more general statute that this court interpreted in\nIn re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB) and, in so doing,\nreversed the effect of this court’s decision. See In re\nMichael S., supra, 258 Conn. 624 n.3. Had the legislature\nintended to reverse that clear policy, it could have\nreplaced the final judgment language with phrasing indi-\ncating that juvenile transfers are not final judgments\nfor purposes of appeal. See, e.g., General Statutes\n(Supp. 2014) § 46b-127 (f). As we have frequently stated,\n‘‘it is a well settled principle of statutory construction\nthat the legislature knows how to convey its intent\nexpressly . . . or to use broader or limiting terms\nwhen it chooses to do so.’’ (Citation omitted.) Scholastic\nBook Clubs, Inc. v. Commissioner of Revenue Services,\nsupra, 304 Conn. 219. Instead, the legislature simply\nreturned to the nonspecific language that gave rise to\nIn re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB). This omission does\nlittle to suggest a clear legislative intention to abandon\nthe prior rule. ‘‘In the interpretation of a statute, a radi-\ncal departure from an established policy cannot be\nimplied. It must be expressed in unequivocal language.’’\nJennings v. Connecticut Light & Power Co., 140 Conn.\n650, 667, 103 A.2d 535 (1954).\n  I recognize, however, that the legislative history of\nthe statutory language governing transfers may best\nbe described as equivocal, with supportive arguments\nbeing offered on both sides of the issue depending upon\nthe legislator whom one chooses as authority. For\ninstance, we stated in In re Michael S, supra, 258 Conn.\n630–31 n.11 as follows: ‘‘We note that the problem pre-\nsented by aging juveniles was recognized by the legisla-\nture when it enacted Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-2, § 6, deleting\nthe final judgment language from [the statute governing\nmandatory transfers]. During debate on the proposed\nlegislation, Senator George Jepsen stated that the ability\n\fto appeal from a transfer order ‘has been the focus of\nmuch of the problems associated with Juvenile Court\nactions because by the time an appeal is taken, the\njuvenile is no longer a juvenile.’ 37 S. Proc., Pt. 10, July\n13, 1994, Spec. Sess., p. 3630. Representative Edward\nC. Graziani stated that ‘when you take an appeal [from\na transfer order], you can extend the period of time\nbefore a resolution is done. The child is typically over\n[sixteen by the time the appeal is decided], so the whole\nissue is moot. Therefore, the state’s advocates do not\nproceed to try to even attempt under our existing law\nto get a transfer because the law is really defective.\n[Under this] new law . . . there is no appeal. You can-\nnot appeal, so you cannot stop the clock when the\nsystem goes forward, so the child doesn’t become [six-\nteen] before justice is followed through.’ 37 H.R. Proc.,\nPt. 27, July 13, 1994 Spec. Sess., p. 9955.’’ In contrast,\nwhen Representative Michael Lawlor, the cochairman\nof the Judiciary Committee, presented the bill to the\nHouse of Representatives, he said: ‘‘This bill does not in\nany significant way change the meaning of the juvenile\ntransfer language.’’ 37 H.R. Proc., supra, pp. 9786–87.\n   Further, when the legislature undertook a more com-\nprehensive reform of the statutes governing the juvenile\njustice system the following year, the removal of the\nprovision regarding interlocutory appeals from the stat-\nute governing discretionary transfers was never explic-\nitly discussed. See 38 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1995 Sess., pp.\n2933–42, remarks of Representative Lawlor. In fact, dur-\ning legislative debate on the 1995 reforms, Representa-\ntive Dale Radcliffe, a vocal opponent of the initial\nversion of the bill because it failed, in his view, to\ntransfer enough children to adult court, criticized the\namendment then under debate because the only thing\nit did to speed transfers was eliminate probable cause\nand competency hearings in juvenile court. Id., pp.\n2956–57. It is certainly arguable that the implication of\nRepresentative Radcliffe’s remarks was that he under-\nstood that the revisions being considered continued to\nallow interlocutory appeals. The fact that this under-\nstanding was shared by many of the other legislators\nis underscored by Representative Lawlor’s failure to\nmention the fact that the elimination of the final appeal\nlanguage from the provisions governing discretionary\ntransfers would change a substantive part of the law,\ndespite presenting the bill to the chamber and summa-\nrizing the provisions. Id., pp. 2933–42. Legislative debate\nsurrounding subsequent revisions of and amendments\nto the juvenile transfer statute, including adoption of\nthe iteration of the statute at issue in the present case,\nhas not touched upon the question of interlocutory\nappeals.\n  On the basis of this legislative history, I would con-\nclude that the intent of the legislature in removing the\nstatutory language indicating that a transfer repre-\nsented a final judgment for the purpose of an interlocu-\n\ftory appeal is far from definitive. In my view, it is so\nunclear that we must resort to a Curcio analysis in\norder to determine if an appeal should be allowed. As\nI stated previously in this opinion, ‘‘[i]n some instances,\nhowever, it is unclear whether an order is an appealable\nfinal judgment. In the gray area between judgments\nwhich are undoubtedly final and others that are clearly\ninterlocutory . . . this court has adopted the following\ntest, applicable to both criminal and civil proceedings:\nAn otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two\ncircumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates\na separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the\norder or action so concludes the rights of the parties\nthat further proceedings cannot affect them. State v.\nCurcio, [supra, 191 Conn. 31].’’ (Citation omitted; inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted.) Solomon v. Keiser, supra,\n212 Conn. 746.\n   I also would conclude that, in view of the many judi-\ncial opinions and scientific studies which have changed\nthe entire landscape of juvenile law, it is necessary to\nreevaluate our conclusions in In re Juvenile Appeal\n(85–AB), which concluded that discretionary transfers\npursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) § 46b-126\ndid not satisfy the second prong of Curcio, and In re\nDaniel H., 237 Conn. 364, 367, 678 A.2d 462 (1996),\nwhich concluded that the legislature’s decision to\nremove the final judgment language from the mandatory\ntransfer provision ‘‘eliminated the right to an immediate\nappeal from a court order transferring a juvenile matter\nto the regular criminal docket . . . .’’ I disagree with\nthe majority’s reliance on In re Daniel H., because that\ncase addressed the statute for the mandatory transfer\nof juveniles and not the discretionary transfer statute\ninvolved in this case. The mandatory transfer provision,\nit must be stated, contains no language regarding the\nbest interests of the child. My principal issue with the\nmajority is that, in my view, this is an entirely new\nstatute, with new findings to be made by the trial judge,\nwhich is different from statutes that this court has pre-\nviously considered. It is important, in my opinion, that\nwe examine this new statute through the current lens\nof evolving juvenile justice principles.\n   I would conclude that we must reexamine this court’s\nCurcio analysis in In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB)\nbecause, in the years since that opinion was issued,\nthere have been numerous substantial changes to our\nunderstanding of juvenile justice principles. For\ninstance, since that time, our nation has stopped execut-\ning people who were children when they committed\ntheir crimes. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 568–69,\n125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005). We have stopped\nimposing sentences of life in prison without the possibil-\nity of parole upon people who were children when they\ncommitted their crimes. Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S.\n48, 74, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L. Ed. 2d 825 (2010). We\nhave changed our state laws to recognize that sixteen\n\fand seventeen year olds are still children, and should\nremain, whenever possible, within the jurisdiction of\nthe juvenile court. See Spec. Sess. P.A. 07-4, § 73. All\nof these developments were erected on the foundation\nof a body of scientific knowledge not available to this\ncourt in 1985.\n   An examination of these seminal United States\nSupreme Court cases involving juvenile justice is\ninstructive to our understanding of the changing views\nof juvenile justice. In Roper v. Simmons, supra, 543\nU.S. 555–56, the United States Supreme Court reversed\nitself on a question, presented just sixteen years earlier\nin Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361, 109 S. Ct. 2969,\n106 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1989), of whether the eighth amend-\nment to the United States constitution permits imposing\nthe death penalty on a person convicted of a crime\ncommitted as a minor. In holding that the execution of\nsuch offenders was unconstitutional, the United States\nSupreme Court relied heavily on the large number of\nstates that had abolished the execution of juvenile\noffenders since the Stanford ruling. Roper v. Simmons,\nsupra, 568. In explaining this trend, the court cited three\nreasons: (1) ‘‘[A]s any parent knows and as the scientific\nand sociological studies . . . tend to confirm, [a] lack\nof maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibil-\nity are found in youth more often than in adults and\nare more understandable among the young’’; (2) ‘‘juve-\nniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative\ninfluences and outside pressures, including peer pres-\nsure’’; and (3) ‘‘the character of a juvenile is not as well\nformed as that of an adult. The personality traits of\njuveniles are more transitory, less fixed.’’ (Internal quo-\ntation marks omitted.) Id., 569–70.\n   Two years after Roper was decided, Connecticut\njoined the vast majority of sister states in extending\njuvenile court jurisdiction to sixteen and seventeen year\nolds. See Spec. Sess. P.A. 07-4, § 73. An examination of\nthe testimony considered by the legislature prior to\nenacting this change indicates that the legislature was\nattuned to the changing understanding of adolescence\nreflected in Roper and the nationwide trends noted\ntherein. It also shows how much of the current informa-\ntion about adolescents was unavailable to this court\nwhen it decided In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB). In my\nview, if this information were available to this court\nwhen it decided that case in 1985, a different result\nwould have been reached.\n   In In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB), supra, 195 Conn.\n312–13, this court considered whether the exceptions\nto the final judgment rule set forth in State v. Curcio,\nsupra, 191 Conn. 31–34, were applicable to juvenile\ntransfer orders. As I explained previously in this opin-\nion, Curcio establishes that ‘‘[a]n otherwise interlocu-\ntory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1)\nwhere the order or action terminates a separate and\n\fdistinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action\nso concludes the rights of the parties that further pro-\nceedings cannot affect them.’’ Id., 31.\n   Tyriq T., the respondent in this case, does not claim\nthat the first Curcio exception applies. The Court in In\nre Juvenile Appeal (85–AB) considered two arguments\nregarding the second prong of Curcio. First, it consid-\nered the loss of privacy because matters are held in\npublic in the adult court as opposed to the privacy of\nthe juvenile court. In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB),\nsupra, 195 Conn. 307–308. Second, there was concern\nabout the juveniles having direct contact with the adult\nprison population. Id., 310. The court held that the first\nground did not satisfy the second prong of Curcio and\nassumed that the Department of Correction would pro-\nvide children in its custody with age appropriate ser-\nvices or transfer them to any other appropriate state\ninstitution as their needs required. Id., 308 and 310 n.5.\n   In 2007, the legislature heard testimony from then\nCommissioner of Correction, Theresa Lantz, indicating\nthat sixteen and seventeen year old children in the\ncustody of the Department of Correction were not\nreceiving developmentally appropriate services in the\nway they would if they were in the juvenile system,\nnotwithstanding the creation of a special facility for\nthem. Commissioner Lantz testified as follows: ‘‘I took\nall the [sixteen] and [seventeen] year olds out of the\njails. . . . And we’ve tailored programs for that particu-\nlar population. . . . And so one of the things that we’ve\nreally tried to concentrate [on] is giving them specific\nprograms, but we don’t provide the same level of ser-\nvices that the juveniles get in the juvenile court system.’’\nConn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Executive\nand Legislative Nominations, Pt. 1, 2007 Sess., pp.\n229–30.\n   The admitted inadequacy of services provided to chil-\ndren held in the custody of the Department of Correc-\ntion—even when they are segregated from adult\nprisoners—presents a very real risk of irreparable harm\nwhen considered in the context of the current under-\nstanding of the importance of the adolescent years to\nhuman cognitive and emotional development. ‘‘Adoles-\ncence is a crucial and necessary period of plasticity\nwhen brain circuitry and behavior are beginning to be\nestablished. These changes in brain circuitry and func-\ntioning that occur during adolescence most significantly\nimpact brain regions associated with response inhibi-\ntion, planning, the calibration of risk and reward, and\nemotion regulation. Moreover, the opportunities and\nconstraints created by a child’s environment play an\nimportant role in this period of development.’’ (Foot-\nnotes omitted.) A. Giannetti, ‘‘The Solitary Confinement\nof Juveniles in Adult Jails and Prisons: A Cruel and\nUnusual Punishment,’’ 30 Buff. Pub. Int. L.J. 31, 45–46\n(2011–2012). ‘‘Once the developmental window passes\n\ffor a juvenile, the brain cannot go back and redevelop\nat some point in the future; the developmental effects\nare likely permanent.’’ Id., 46–47.\n   It is important to note the long-term effects of the\ninadequate provision of services to the children when\nthey are in adult detention. As Attorney Christina Ghio\nnoted when she testified in 2007 on behalf of the Office\nof the Child Advocate in favor of legislation to raise\nthe juvenile jurisdiction age: ‘‘The inadequacy of the\nadult criminal system to address the emotional and\ndevelopmental needs of teenagers is substantiated\nthrough research demonstrating that youth incarcer-\nated in adult facilities are more likely to reoffend and\ncommit more serious crimes than youth who are tried\nand treated in the juvenile system for the same crimes.’’\nConn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary,\nPt. 19, 2007 Sess., p. 6096. Research has shown that\neven facilities specifically designed for children tend to\nhave suboptimal educational outcomes, and to provide\ninadequate ancillary services such as special education,\nsocial work, and psychology. See K. Burdick et al., ‘‘Cre-\nating Positive Consequences: Improving Education Out-\ncomes for Youth Adjudicated Delinquent,’’ 3 Duke F.\nfor L. & Soc. Change 5, 10–12 (2011). The shortcomings\nof these resources often lead to greater high school\ndropout rates and greater subsequent involvement with\nthe adult criminal justice system. Id., 13 n.50.\n  Legal developments subsequent to the change in the\nage of juvenile jurisdiction in Connecticut indicate that\nthe evolution in legal understanding of the needs of\nadolescents has continued. First, in 2010, the United\nStates Supreme Court ruled that life imprisonment with-\nout parole for crimes committed by juveniles was also\nunconstitutional. See Graham v. Florida, supra, 560\nU.S. 74. In Graham, the United States Supreme Court\nrelied in a large part on the reasoning of Roper, conclud-\ning that ‘‘[n]o recent data provide reason to reconsider\nthe [c]ourt’s observations in Roper about the nature of\njuveniles. As the petitioner’s amici point out, develop-\nments in psychology and brain science continue to show\nfundamental differences between juvenile and adult\nminds.’’ Id., 68.\n  Then, in 2012, the Connecticut legislature provided\nthe detailed procedure, at issue in this case, for\ndetermining which juvenile cases are transferred to the\nadult criminal docket. See Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June\n2012, No. 12-1, § 280. This enactment made clear that\nhearings on discretionary transfers from juvenile court\nto adult court should occur, for the first time, in the\njuvenile court, rather than in the adult court as required\nby State v. Fernandes, 300 Conn. 104, 106, 12 A.3d 925,\ncert. denied,      U.S.     , 131 S. Ct. 2469, 179 L. Ed.\n2d 1213 (2011). See id., 129–30 (Eveleigh, J., dissenting).\nThe reason for this change was reflected in the testi-\nmony of Judge Christine Keller to the Judiciary Commit-\n\ftee in support of the bill: ‘‘We felt that, number one,\nthat due process hearing should take place before they\nget over to adult court. We know what services are\navailable in juvenile court. We know what we can apply\nto that child from the juvenile court array of services\nand diversions. We may know the child a lot better than\nthe adult court, because we may have had the child in\nfront of us previously. Probation, one of the differences\nbetween an adult court and a juvenile court is in juvenile\ncourt, a probation officer is assigned the minute the\nchild walks into the courthouse . . . we don’t wait\nuntil . . . the case is disposed of to assign a probation\nofficer. So the juvenile judge would waive the totality\nof circumstances, the seriousness of the offense, the\nchild’s history with the juvenile court, and what we\ncould do for the child in the juvenile court and then\ndetermine whether, okay, there’s not much more we\ncan do for this child, off they go to adult court or say,\nno, it’s going to stay here on the discretionary transfers,\nnot the most serious ones.’’ Conn. Joint Standing Com-\nmittee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 13, 2012 Sess., pp.\n4167–68.\n   As this testimony before the legislature demon-\nstrates, because of the unique nature of juvenile court\nand the unique services provided there, a juvenile who\nis transferred from juvenile court to adult court suffers\nan irreparable harm. The harm suffered by a wrongly\ntransferred juvenile is truly irreparable, for when ‘‘the\ndevelopmental window passes for a juvenile, the brain\ncannot go back and redevelop at some point in the\nfuture.’’ A. Giannetti, supra, 30 Buff. Pub. Int. L.J. 46–47.\nI would add that, in my view, the lack of privacy is\nirreparable. Once the juvenile has a public hearing he\ncannot go to a judge to retrieve his privacy. Further,\nwe should not, in my view, ignore the fact that once\nthe juvenile goes to adult court his conviction could\nresult in a criminal record, unless he is granted youthful\noffender status. Certainly, the imposition of a criminal\nrecord on an individual is irreparable and is something\nfor which the juvenile may suffer repercussions the rest\nof his life. A juvenile does not incur a criminal record\nin juvenile court. Once the transfer occurs the possibil-\nity of a criminal record exists. Further, the juvenile that\nis transferred to adult court may face the decision of\nhaving to post bond through a bail bondsman, which\nwould result in an irreparable loss of money that would\nnot be incurred in juvenile court. We have previously\nheld an immediate appeal was appropriate because the\norder required the aggrieved party to engage in some\ncoercive action, such as paying money that could not\nbe recovered on a subsequent appeal. Litvaitis v. Lit-\nvaitis, 162 Conn. 540, 548–49, 295 A.2d 519 (1972) (con-\ncluding pendente lite order for payment of support was\nfinal judgment); Hiss v. Hiss, 135 Conn. 333, 336–38,\n64 A.2d 173 (1949) (concluding pendente lite order for\ntemporary support was final judgment). Certainly, the\n\fjuvenile would never have the opportunity to recover\nthe funds needed to post bond. Further, if a juvenile\nin adult court cannot make bond, he will receive less\nfrequent reviews of his detention. See Practice Book\n§ 30-10 (requiring that juveniles receive detention\nreview hearing every fifteen days). Hearings in the juve-\nnile court also ensure that, to the court’s satisfaction,\nthe juvenile is receiving the proper services. The juve-\nnile loses the use of the juvenile probation officer if a\ntransfer is ordered.\n   As I explained previously in this opinion, General\nStatutes (Supp. 2014) § 46b-127 (b) (1) (C) requires that\nthe court find, inter alia, that ‘‘the best interests of the\nchild and the public will not be served by maintaining\nthe case in the superior court for juvenile matters.’’ It\nis this ‘‘best interests’’ finding that separates this statute\nfrom the youthful offender statute and makes any com-\nparison to other transfer statutes inapposite. The youth-\nful offender statute does not carry any ‘‘best interests\nof the child’’ language. In fact, it is difficult to conjure\nup a scenario when the best interests of the child would\never be served by a transfer to adult court given the\nabsence of privacy, inadequate services and the possi-\nbility of a public record.\n   Further, the very presence of the best interests test\nis an important new element in any consideration under\nthe second prong of Curcio. It is my position that this\nstatute has changed so substantively that any resort to\nan analysis based upon its genealogy is misplaced. A\nhearing regarding the best interests of the child was\nsimply not required in prior revisions of the statute.\nThe adequacy of that hearing and the court’s findings\nmust be subject to appellate review before the transfer\nis completed. If there is no review at that time, in my\nview, the purpose and meaning of Curcio has become\nmeaningless. In State v. Fernandes, supra, 300 Conn.\n127, this court held that ‘‘[t]herefore, when, as here,\ntreatment as a juvenile is the presumptive norm, and\ntreatment as an adult is the exception, the right to\njuvenile status vests in the juvenile, and the discretion-\nary transfer to criminal court, which is a revocation of\njuvenile status, constitutes a deprivation of a liberty\ninterest cognizable under the due process clause.’’ In\norder to protect these due process rights the legislature\nnow requires that the court consider, as one of the\nrequirements of transfer, that the best interests of the\nchild will not be served by maintaining him in the juve-\nnile system. This required finding represents a sea\nchange in the statute that did not exist when: (1) we\ndecided In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB); (2) the 1994\nor 1995 amendments were passed; or (3) we decided\nIn re Daniel H. Therefore, any reliance on those cases,\nor on the genealogy of § 46b-127 (b) (1), is misplaced\nand it is more appropriate to engage in an analysis\nunder Curcio.\n\f   We have previously determined that orders of tempo-\nrary custody under General Statutes § 46b-56, which\nrequire a finding on the best interests of the child, are\nimmediately appealable. Madigan v. Madigan, 224\nConn. 749, 750–51, 620 A.2d 1276 (1993). In considering\norders for temporary custody under § 46b-56, this court\nhas stated that ‘‘we consider orders of temporary cus-\ntody in light of these constitutional considerations and\nreaffirm our conclusion that an immediate appeal of [a\ncourt order of temporary custody] is the only reason-\nable method of ensuring that the important rights sur-\nrounding the parent-child relationship are adequately\nprotected.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re\nShamika F., 256 Conn. 383, 404, 773 A.2d 347 (2001).\nThis court continued: ‘‘[T]he best interest of the chil-\ndren, especially their interest in family stability, sup-\nports our analysis. . . . Therefore, we conclude that\ntemporary custody orders are immediately appealable\nnot only to protect a parent’s interests in their children,\nbut also to protect the individual interests of the chil-\ndren.’’ Id., 405–406. Likewise, in In re Jeisean M., 270\nConn. 382, 404–405, 852 A.2d 643 (2004), this court held\nthat an extension of commitment, which also requires\na factual finding regarding the child’s best interests, is\nan immediately appealable final judgment.\n   As the foregoing demonstrates, this court has rou-\ntinely determined that, where the individual best inter-\nests of a child are concerned, orders affecting those\ninterests are appealable final judgments. This is the\nharmonious body of law which, in my view, we should\nmaintain. In fact, my research has not revealed a case\ninvolving a statute that contained language regarding\nthe ‘‘best interests’’ of a child in which this court has\nnot allowed an immediate appeal from an interlocutory\norder of any kind. Certainly, the revocation of juvenile\nstatus, which we have held to be a liberty interest;\nsee State v. Fernandes, supra, 300 Conn. 111; must\nconstitute an appealable judgment under Curcio.\nIndeed, once the juvenile is transferred he loses valu-\nable services and his privacy. Further, he loses the right\nto have his detention reviewed every fifteen days. He\nmay lose the right to be released to his parents or\nguardian, or other suitable person or agency without\nthe possibility of having to incur the expense of posting\na bond, which may or may not become problematic. In\nthis case, the required finding regarding best interest\nwas recently added to the statute. When a court makes\na ruling that may affect those interests, it follows that\nCurcio requires that ruling to constitute an appealable\nfinal judgment.\n  The opinion of the majority, in my view, leads to the\nabsurd result that before a juvenile can challenge a\njudge’s decision to transfer the juvenile to adult court,\nthe juvenile must give up his or her right to privacy,\nbe hindered by a public criminal record, and give up\n\fvaluable services that may aid his or her development\nwhile an appeal is pending. The majority contends that\nthis result is mandated by the deletion of the final judg-\nment wording in the statute. As noted earlier, I respect-\nfully disagree with this conclusion because the wording\nof this statute is completely different from the earlier\nversions, and both our case law and our acceptance of\nscientific studies regarding juveniles mandate a differ-\nent result. There are specific findings which now must\nbe made by the trial court prior to ordering the transfer.\nWhat if, for instance, the judge failed to make the best\ninterest finding, yet ordered the transfer to adult court?\nIs the majority’s position such that a juvenile would\nhave to wait for a trial in adult court before the juvenile\ncould appeal the judge’s clear error committed in juve-\nnile court? The consequences of such a result are much\ntoo severe for the juvenile and, in my view, directly\ncontrary to the intent of Curcio.\n   During legislative debates in 1994, some of the legisla-\ntors remarked that the final judgment clause should be\nremoved from the mandatory transfer provision\nbecause the transfer appeals took too long. It is note-\nworthy that the appellate system of the Judicial Branch\nof this state has recognized this deficiency and insti-\ntuted a system in which all juvenile appeals are expe-\ndited and the number of extensions has been\nsignificantly reduced. Presently, the average case takes\na total of approximately six months from the time the\nappeal is filed until the appellate decision. In the Appel-\nlate Court the period is 185.94 days. In the Supreme\nCourt the period is 183.44 days. These statistics demon-\nstrate a vast improvement in the time period within\nwhich an appeal involving juvenile matters is presently\nheard.3 In the present case, the respondent was trans-\nferred to adult court on November 15, 2012. The order\nwas not stayed. At the time of oral argument on March\n20, 2014, his case still had not been heard in adult court.\nHe has lost sixteen months of services he could have\nhad in juvenile court. He has also lost the benefit of\nhaving sixteen months of supervision by a juvenile pro-\nbation officer. His hearings have been open to the pub-\nlic, and he now faces the possibility of having a criminal\nrecord. How could this transfer have possibly been in\nhis best interests? If indeed, the 1994 act omitted the\nprovision providing for an immediate appeal from man-\ndatory transfers was because those appeals took too\nlong, the pendulum has swung 180 degrees; in the\nabsence of a speedy trial motion, it takes far longer to\ntry the juvenile in adult court, compared to the time in\nwhich the juvenile could have an appeal heard in the\nappellate system.\n   I would, therefore, conclude that the discretionary\ntransfer order of a juvenile from the Superior Court for\njuvenile matters to the Superior Court for adult matters\nmeets the second prong of Curcio and, therefore, is an\nappealable interlocutory order. In view of the potential\n\firreparable harm to the juvenile, I would conclude that\na stay should be in place while the appeal is pending,\nand the juvenile should continue to receive juvenile\nservices during the course of the appeal. He should also\ncontinue to be supervised by his juvenile probation\nofficer. The effect on both the juvenile and his or her\nfamily is too devastating to allow a discretionary order\nto languish while the juvenile endures a criminal trial\nwithout the benefit of having the transfer order\nreviewed by an appellate court.\n   I would conclude both that the order was an appeal-\nable final judgment under Curcio and that the best\ninterests of the juvenile demanded that he stay within\nthe jurisdiction of the Superior Court for juvenile mat-\nters while the appeal was pending. Accordingly, I would\nreverse the judgment of the Appellate Court. Therefore,\nI respectfully dissent.\n   1\n     As the majority notes, § 46b-127 has recently been amended in a manner\nnot relevant to the present appeal. See footnote 1 of the majority opinion;\nsee also Public Acts 2013, No. 13-258, § 5. Hereinafter, unless otherwise\nnoted, all references to § 46b-127 are to the version appearing in the 2014\nsupplement to the General Statutes.\n   2\n     As noted by the majority, the legislature moved the statutory provision\ngoverning discretionary transfers from § 46b-126 (a) to § 46b-127 (b) in 1995.\nSee Public Acts 1995, No. 95-225, §§ 13 and 39.\n   3\n     Obviously, in the vast minority of juvenile cases in which certification\nis granted from the Appellate Court to the Supreme Court, which represents\na very small percentage of the overall statistics, the time period from filing\nto decision is longer.\n\f",

I respectfully dissent. Until today, this court\nhas never held that an interlocutory order that requires\na determination of the best interests of the child was\nnot immediately appealable. In fact, ‘‘[t]his court has a\nlong history of concluding that, within the context of\nfamily matters, orders that would otherwise be consid-\nered interlocutory constitute appealable final judg-\nments.’’ Khan v. Hillyer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">996</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012). The statute governing the discretionary\ntransfer of cases from the juvenile matters docket to the\nregular criminal docket of the Superior Court, General\nStatutes (Supp. 2014) § 46b-127 (b) (1) (C),1 requires\nthe judge to consider, inter alia, whether ‘‘the best inter-\nests of the child and the public will not be served by\nmaintaining the case in the superior court for juvenile\nmatters.’’ I see no reason to abandon our long-standing\nprecedent of holding that an otherwise interlocutory\norder that involves a determination of the ‘‘best inter-\nests of the child’’ is immediately appealable where there\nis no clear legislative mandate to the contrary. There-\nfore, I respectfully dissent.\n   The majority holds that, in light of the genealogy of\n§ 46b-127, coupled with the relevant legislative history,\nit is clear that the legislature did not intend for the\ndiscretionary transfer of a juvenile from juvenile court\nto adult court based upon a C, D, E or unclassified\nfelony to be a final judgment. I disagree. The majority\nconcludes that ‘‘the clear intent of the legislature is to\nprohibit interlocutory appeals from discretionary trans-\nfer orders.’’ The majority continues: ‘‘We agree with the\nstate that the legislature expressed a clear intent to\nprohibit the immediate appeal of discretionary transfer\norders. As we explain herein, although the current statu-\ntory text of § 46b-127 does not resolve the question of\nwhether a discretionary transfer order constitutes a\nfinal judgment for purposes of appeal, we conclude, on\nthe basis of the genealogy of the transfer provisions,\nread together with this court’s interpretation of the\nlegislative intent evident from the prior amendments\nto those provisions, that under the current statutory\nlanguage a discretionary transfer order cannot be imme-\ndiately appealed. This interpretation of the discretion-\nary transfer provision results in a harmonious and\nconsistent body of law with respect to all of the transfer\nprovisions currently contained in § 46b-127.’’ I respect-\nfully disagree.\n  Furthermore, I disagree with the majority’s failure to\nanalyze the question of whether an order under § 46b-\n127 (b) (1) is immediately appealable under State v.\nCurcio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2372201\"><a href=\"/opinion/2372201/state-v-curcio/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983). Despite\nacknowledging that the statute is silent as to whether\n\fthe transfer order is immediately appealable, and\nacknowledging that it is necessary to resort to legisla-\ntive history to interpret the statute, the majority fails\nto engage in the analysis required by Curcio.\n   In my view, statutory language currently set forth in\n§ 46b-127 is completely different from previous ver-\nsions, the legislative history is silent on the issue of\nthe finality of the judgment, our philosophy toward\njuveniles has changed in recent years, and United States\nSupreme Court case law has changed. Furthermore, this\ncourt has routinely held that, where the best interests of\nthe child are a consideration, an otherwise interlocutory\nruling must be considered a final judgment. I disagree\nwith the majority that reading § 46b-127 (b) (1) in con-\nnection with other transfer statutes mandates a conclu-\nsion that the legislature clearly intended that a transfer\norder under § 46b-127 (b) (1) is not immediately appeal-\nable. Rather, I would read § 46b-127 (b) (1) in a manner\nconsistent with other statutes under which this court\nhas considered the best interests of the child and uni-\nformly held that otherwise interlocutory orders were\nimmediately appealable under the second prong of Cur-\ncio. Therefore, I would conclude that since § 46b-127\n(b) (1) is silent as to whether a transfer is immediately\nappealable, and that, under the second prong of Curcio,\nthe discretionary transfer of a juvenile from the Supe-\nrior Court for juvenile matters to adult court is immedi-\nately appealable because such a transfer so concludes\nthe rights of the juveniles such that further proceedings\ncannot affect them. Accordingly, I would conclude that\na juvenile may immediately appeal from an order under\n§ 46b-127 (b) (1) and that the juvenile is entitled to a\nstay of that order pending appeal.\n   I agree with the factual and procedural history set\nforth by the majority in its opinion. I agree with the\nmajority that, in the first instance, ‘‘[w]hether the legis-\nlature intended discretionary transfer orders issued pur-\nsuant to § 46b-127 (b) (1) to be final judgments for\npurposes of appeal presents a question of statutory\ninterpretation over which we exercise plenary review.\nSee Ugrin v.

When a statute is\nnot plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpre-\n\ftive guidance to the legislative history and circum-\nstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative\npolicy it was designed to implement, and to its relation-\nship to existing legislation and common law principles\ngoverning the same general subject matter . . . .

General\nStatutes (Supp. 2014) § 46b-127 (b) (1) provides as fol-\nlows: ‘‘Upon motion of a prosecutorial official, the supe-\nrior court for juvenile matters shall conduct a hearing\nto determine whether the case of any child charged\nwith the commission of a class C, D or E felony or an\nunclassified felony shall be transferred from the docket\nfor juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket of\nthe Superior Court. The court shall not order that the\ncase be transferred under this subdivision unless the\ncourt finds that (A) such offense was committed after\nsuch child attained the age of fourteen years, (B) there\nis probable cause to believe the child has committed\nthe act for which the child is charged, and (C) the best\ninterests of the child and the public will not be served\nby maintaining the case in the superior court for juvenile\nmatters. In making such findings, the court shall con-\nsider (i) any prior criminal or juvenile offenses commit-\nted by the child, (ii) the seriousness of such offenses,\n(iii) any evidence that the child has intellectual disabil-\nity or mental illness, and (iv) the availability of services\nin the docket for juvenile matters that can serve the\nchild’s needs. Any motion under this subdivision shall\nbe made, and any hearing under this subdivision shall\n\fbe held, not later than thirty days after the child is\narraigned in the superior court for juvenile matters.’’\nThe statute itself then is silent as to whether it is a final\njudgment for purposes of appeal.\n   Nevertheless, when considering § 46b-127 (b) (1) in\nrelation to the rest of that statute, I note that in General\nStatutes (Supp. 2014) § 46b-127 (f) the legislature did\nexplicitly provide that ‘‘[t]he decision of the court con-\ncerning the transfer of a youth’s case from the youthful\noffender docket, regular criminal docket of the Superior\nCourt or any docket for the presentment of defendants\nin motor vehicle matters shall not be a final judgment\nfor purposes of appeal.’’ I would conclude that the legis-\nlature’s decision to include language in § 46b-127 (f)\nexplicitly providing that a transfer under that subsec-\ntion is not a final judgment for purposes of appeal\nindicates that the legislature knows how to include such\nlanguage if it chooses to do so, and the fact that it did\nnot do so in § 46b-127 (b) (1) suggests that the legisla-\nture may have intended for the other transfers to be\nfinal judgments for purposes of an appeal. As we have\nfrequently stated, ‘‘it is a well settled principle of statu-\ntory construction that the legislature knows how to\nconvey its intent expressly; e.g., Dept. of Public Safety\nv.

The state asserts\nthat an interlocutory order is only appealable if the\nlegislature chooses to make it so in the statutory lan-\nguage and we cannot read such language into a statute.\nBecause I find that § 46b-127 (b) (1) is subject to two\nreasonable interpretations regarding whether a transfer\npursuant to that section constitutes a final judgment\nfor purposes of appeal, I would conclude that § 46b-127\n(b) (1) is ambiguous, and, therefore, resort to legislative\nhistory and extratextual sources.\n   I begin with the history of § 46b-127 (b) (1). In In re\nJuvenile Appeal (85–AB), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">778</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), this court first considered whether an order\ntransferring a case from the juvenile docket to the regu-\nlar criminal docket was a final judgment for the pur-\nposes of appeal. In that case, this court held that such\nan order does not: (1) constitute a final judgment for\nthe purpose of appellate review; or (2) fall within the\nexceptions to the final judgment rule outlined in Curcio.\n\fId., 306–307. At that time, the statute governing the\ndiscretionary transfer of juvenile cases to the regular\ncriminal docket, General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) § 46b-\n126,2 required a judge to determine that the juvenile\nhad attained the age of fourteen, find probable cause,\nand determine that the nature of the charge qualified\nfor transfer. I note that the respondent in In re Juvenile\nAppeal (85–AB) did not argue that the transfer order\nwas a final judgment, only that one of the Curcio excep-\ntions applied. In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB), supra,\n307. It cannot be disputed that, since the date of that\ndecision, American jurisprudence regarding juveniles\nhas undergone tremendous change motivated by the\nprevailing scientific understanding of adolescents’ cog-\nnitive development. As a result of this new understand-\ning, Connecticut has now classified both sixteen year\nolds and seventeen year olds as juveniles. See Public\nActs, Spec. Sess., June, 2007, No. 07-4, § 73.\n  The statute considered in In re Juvenile Appeal (85–\nAB), General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) § 46b-126, like\nthe current version of § 46b-127 (b) (1), contained no\nlanguage indicating the legislature’s intent to either per-\nmit or forbid interlocutory appeals of transfers. Accord-\ningly, this court did not engage in any analysis of\nwhether the legislature intended to allow interlocutory\nappeals, instead concluding that the transfer was not\na final judgment and, therefore, should be analyzed\nunder the exceptions to the final judgment rule set forth\nin Curcio.\n   Since our decision in the case of In re Juvenile Appeal\n(85–AB), the legislature has made various changes to\nthe statutory language governing the discretionary\ntransfer of juvenile cases to the regular criminal docket.\nInitially, the legislature responded to this court’s deci-\nsion in In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB) by adding explicit\nstatutory language making such transfers immediately\nappealable. See Public Acts 1986, No. 86-185, § 1; see\nalso In re Michael S., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 624 n.3, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">317</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001). Specifically, the amendment added language\nproviding that ‘‘[a]n order by the court under this sec-\ntion transferring a child from the docket for juvenile\nmatters to the regular criminal docket of the superior\ncourt shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.’’\nPublic Act 86-185, § 1.\n   In 1994, the legislature convened a special session to\naddress gun violence and, therein, undertook a revision\nof the statute governing mandatory transfers in relation\nto certain gun related offenses. See Public Acts, Spec.\nSess., July, 1994, No. 94-2, § 6. The revised statute did\nnot explicitly bar interlocutory appeals, but omitted the\nfinal judgment language that the legislature had added\nin 1986. Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-2, § 6. In 1995, the legislature\nmoved the statutory language governing discretionary\ntransfers from § 46b-126 (a) to § 46b-127 (b). See foot-\nnote 2 of this opinion. In the course of making this\n\famendment, the legislature again chose to omit the final\njudgment language that was added in 1986. Public Acts\n1995, No. 95-225, §§ 13 and 39. The majority suggests\nthat the removal of the final judgment language from\n§ 46b-127 indicates an intention by the legislature to\nabandon the final judgment rule it put into place in\n1986. In many instances, I would find this argument\npersuasive. See State v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 543,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1059</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993) (‘‘[w]hen the legislature amends\nthe language of a statute, it is presumed that it intended\nto change the meaning of the statute and to accomplish\nsome purpose’’). This court has recognized many times,\nhowever, that some statutory amendments may be\nstructural or linguistic and not substantive. See Gon-\nsalves v. West Haven, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1995) (listing cases in which general rule presuming\nthat legislature intended to change meaning of statute\nwas not applied).\n    The 1986 amendment that made transfers subject to\nan interlocutory appeal evinced the intention of the\nlegislature unequivocally; it added specific language to\nthe more general statute that this court interpreted in\nIn re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB) and, in so doing,\nreversed the effect of this court’s decision. See In re\nMichael S., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> n.3. Had the legislature\nintended to reverse that clear policy, it could have\nreplaced the final judgment language with phrasing indi-\ncating that juvenile transfers are not final judgments\nfor purposes of appeal. See, e.g., General Statutes\n(Supp. 2014) § 46b-127 (f). As we have frequently stated,\n‘‘it is a well settled principle of statutory construction\nthat the legislature knows how to convey its intent\nexpressly . . . or to use broader or limiting terms\nwhen it chooses to do so.’’ (Citation omitted.)

Instead, the legislature simply\nreturned to the nonspecific language that gave rise to\nIn re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB). This omission does\nlittle to suggest a clear legislative intention to abandon\nthe prior rule. ‘‘In the interpretation of a statute, a radi-\ncal departure from an established policy cannot be\nimplied. It must be expressed in unequivocal language.’’\nJennings v. Connecticut Light & Power Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1909622\"><a href=\"/opinion/1909622/jennings-v-connecticut-light-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 667, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954).\n  I recognize, however, that the legislative history of\nthe statutory language governing transfers may best\nbe described as equivocal, with supportive arguments\nbeing offered on both sides of the issue depending upon\nthe legislator whom one chooses as authority. For\ninstance, we stated in In re Michael S, supra, 258 Conn.\n630–31 n.11 as follows: ‘‘We note that the problem pre-\nsented by aging juveniles was recognized by the legisla-\nture when it enacted Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-2, § 6, deleting\nthe final judgment language from [the statute governing\nmandatory transfers]. During debate on the proposed\nlegislation, Senator George Jepsen stated that the ability\n\fto appeal from a transfer order ‘has been the focus of\nmuch of the problems associated with Juvenile Court\nactions because by the time an appeal is taken, the\njuvenile is no longer a juvenile.’ 37 S. Proc., Pt. 10, July\n13, 1994, Spec. Sess., p. 3630. Representative Edward\nC. Graziani stated that ‘when you take an appeal [from\na transfer order], you can extend the period of time\nbefore a resolution is done. The child is typically over\n[sixteen by the time the appeal is decided], so the whole\nissue is moot. Therefore, the state’s advocates do not\nproceed to try to even attempt under our existing law\nto get a transfer because the law is really defective.\n[Under this] new law . . . there is no appeal. You can-\nnot appeal, so you cannot stop the clock when the\nsystem goes forward, so the child doesn’t become [six-\nteen] before justice is followed through.’ 37 H.R. Proc.,\nPt. 27, July 13, 1994 Spec. Sess., p. 9955.’’ In contrast,\nwhen Representative Michael Lawlor, the cochairman\nof the Judiciary Committee, presented the bill to the\nHouse of Representatives, he said: ‘‘This bill does not in\nany significant way change the meaning of the juvenile\ntransfer language.’’ 37 H.R. Proc., supra, pp. 9786–87.\n   Further, when the legislature undertook a more com-\nprehensive reform of the statutes governing the juvenile\njustice system the following year, the removal of the\nprovision regarding interlocutory appeals from the stat-\nute governing discretionary transfers was never explic-\nitly discussed. See 38 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1995 Sess., pp.\n2933–42, remarks of Representative Lawlor. In fact, dur-\ning legislative debate on the 1995 reforms, Representa-\ntive Dale Radcliffe, a vocal opponent of the initial\nversion of the bill because it failed, in his view, to\ntransfer enough children to adult court, criticized the\namendment then under debate because the only thing\nit did to speed transfers was eliminate probable cause\nand competency hearings in juvenile court. Id., pp.\n2956–57. It is certainly arguable that the implication of\nRepresentative Radcliffe’s remarks was that he under-\nstood that the revisions being considered continued to\nallow interlocutory appeals. The fact that this under-\nstanding was shared by many of the other legislators\nis underscored by Representative Lawlor’s failure to\nmention the fact that the elimination of the final appeal\nlanguage from the provisions governing discretionary\ntransfers would change a substantive part of the law,\ndespite presenting the bill to the chamber and summa-\nrizing the provisions. Id., pp. 2933–42. Legislative debate\nsurrounding subsequent revisions of and amendments\nto the juvenile transfer statute, including adoption of\nthe iteration of the statute at issue in the present case,\nhas not touched upon the question of interlocutory\nappeals.\n  On the basis of this legislative history, I would con-\nclude that the intent of the legislature in removing the\nstatutory language indicating that a transfer repre-\nsented a final judgment for the purpose of an interlocu-\n\ftory appeal is far from definitive. In my view, it is so\nunclear that we must resort to a Curcio analysis in\norder to determine if an appeal should be allowed. As\nI stated previously in this opinion, ‘‘[i]n some instances,\nhowever, it is unclear whether an order is an appealable\nfinal judgment. In the gray area between judgments\nwhich are undoubtedly final and others that are clearly\ninterlocutory . . . this court has adopted the following\ntest, applicable to both criminal and civil proceedings:\nAn otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two\ncircumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates\na separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the\norder or action so concludes the rights of the parties\nthat further proceedings cannot affect them.

The mandatory transfer provision,\nit must be stated, contains no language regarding the\nbest interests of the child. My principal issue with the\nmajority is that, in my view, this is an entirely new\nstatute, with new findings to be made by the trial judge,\nwhich is different from statutes that this court has pre-\nviously considered. It is important, in my opinion, that\nwe examine this new statute through the current lens\nof evolving juvenile justice principles.\n   I would conclude that we must reexamine this court’s\nCurcio analysis in In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB)\nbecause, in the years since that opinion was issued,\nthere have been numerous substantial changes to our\nunderstanding of juvenile justice principles. For\ninstance, since that time, our nation has stopped execut-\ning people who were children when they committed\ntheir crimes. Roper v.

All\nof these developments were erected on the foundation\nof a body of scientific knowledge not available to this\ncourt in 1985.\n   An examination of these seminal United States\nSupreme Court cases involving juvenile justice is\ninstructive to our understanding of the changing views\nof juvenile justice. In Roper v. Simmons, supra, 543\nU.S. 555–56, the United States Supreme Court reversed\nitself on a question, presented just sixteen years earlier\nin Stanford v.

In holding that the execution of\nsuch offenders was unconstitutional, the United States\nSupreme Court relied heavily on the large number of\nstates that had abolished the execution of juvenile\noffenders since the Stanford ruling. Roper v. Simmons,\nsupra, 568. In explaining this trend, the court cited three\nreasons: (1) ‘‘[A]s any parent knows and as the scientific\nand sociological studies . . . tend to confirm, [a] lack\nof maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibil-\nity are found in youth more often than in adults and\nare more understandable among the young’’; (2) ‘‘juve-\nniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative\ninfluences and outside pressures, including peer pres-\nsure’’; and (3) ‘‘the character of a juvenile is not as well\nformed as that of an adult. The personality traits of\njuveniles are more transitory, less fixed.’’ (Internal quo-\ntation marks omitted.) Id., 569–70.\n   Two years after Roper was decided, Connecticut\njoined the vast majority of sister states in extending\njuvenile court jurisdiction to sixteen and seventeen year\nolds. See Spec. Sess. P.A. 07-4, § 73. An examination of\nthe testimony considered by the legislature prior to\nenacting this change indicates that the legislature was\nattuned to the changing understanding of adolescence\nreflected in Roper and the nationwide trends noted\ntherein. It also shows how much of the current informa-\ntion about adolescents was unavailable to this court\nwhen it decided In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB). In my\nview, if this information were available to this court\nwhen it decided that case in 1985, a different result\nwould have been reached.\n   In In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB), supra, 195 Conn.\n312–13, this court considered whether the exceptions\nto the final judgment rule set forth in State v. Curcio,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">–34, were applicable to juvenile\ntransfer orders. As I explained previously in this opin-\nion, Curcio establishes that ‘‘[a]n otherwise interlocu-\ntory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1)\nwhere the order or action terminates a separate and\n\fdistinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action\nso concludes the rights of the parties that further pro-\nceedings cannot affect them.’’ Id., 31.\n   Tyriq T., the respondent in this case, does not claim\nthat the first Curcio exception applies. The Court in In\nre Juvenile Appeal (85–AB) considered two arguments\nregarding the second prong of Curcio. First, it consid-\nered the loss of privacy because matters are held in\npublic in the adult court as opposed to the privacy of\nthe juvenile court. In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB),\nsupra, 195 Conn. 307–308. Second, there was concern\nabout the juveniles having direct contact with the adult\nprison population. Id., 310. The court held that the first\nground did not satisfy the second prong of Curcio and\nassumed that the Department of Correction would pro-\nvide children in its custody with age appropriate ser-\nvices or transfer them to any other appropriate state\ninstitution as their needs required. Id., 308 and 310 n.5.\n   In 2007, the legislature heard testimony from then\nCommissioner of Correction, Theresa Lantz, indicating\nthat sixteen and seventeen year old children in the\ncustody of the Department of Correction were not\nreceiving developmentally appropriate services in the\nway they would if they were in the juvenile system,\nnotwithstanding the creation of a special facility for\nthem. Commissioner Lantz testified as follows: ‘‘I took\nall the [sixteen] and [seventeen] year olds out of the\njails. . . . And we’ve tailored programs for that particu-\nlar population. . . . And so one of the things that we’ve\nreally tried to concentrate [on] is giving them specific\nprograms, but we don’t provide the same level of ser-\nvices that the juveniles get in the juvenile court system.’’\nConn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Executive\nand Legislative Nominations, Pt. 1, 2007 Sess., pp.\n229–30.\n   The admitted inadequacy of services provided to chil-\ndren held in the custody of the Department of Correc-\ntion—even when they are segregated from adult\nprisoners—presents a very real risk of irreparable harm\nwhen considered in the context of the current under-\nstanding of the importance of the adolescent years to\nhuman cognitive and emotional development. ‘‘Adoles-\ncence is a crucial and necessary period of plasticity\nwhen brain circuitry and behavior are beginning to be\nestablished. These changes in brain circuitry and func-\ntioning that occur during adolescence most significantly\nimpact brain regions associated with response inhibi-\ntion, planning, the calibration of risk and reward, and\nemotion regulation. Moreover, the opportunities and\nconstraints created by a child’s environment play an\nimportant role in this period of development.’’ (Foot-\nnotes omitted.) A. Giannetti, ‘‘The Solitary Confinement\nof Juveniles in Adult Jails and Prisons: A Cruel and\nUnusual Punishment,’’ 30 Buff. Pub. Int. L.J. 31, 45–46\n(2011–2012). ‘‘Once the developmental window passes\n\ffor a juvenile, the brain cannot go back and redevelop\nat some point in the future; the developmental effects\nare likely permanent.’’ Id., 46–47.\n   It is important to note the long-term effects of the\ninadequate provision of services to the children when\nthey are in adult detention. As Attorney Christina Ghio\nnoted when she testified in 2007 on behalf of the Office\nof the Child Advocate in favor of legislation to raise\nthe juvenile jurisdiction age: ‘‘The inadequacy of the\nadult criminal system to address the emotional and\ndevelopmental needs of teenagers is substantiated\nthrough research demonstrating that youth incarcer-\nated in adult facilities are more likely to reoffend and\ncommit more serious crimes than youth who are tried\nand treated in the juvenile system for the same crimes.’’\nConn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary,\nPt. 19, 2007 Sess., p. 6096. Research has shown that\neven facilities specifically designed for children tend to\nhave suboptimal educational outcomes, and to provide\ninadequate ancillary services such as special education,\nsocial work, and psychology. See K. Burdick et al., ‘‘Cre-\nating Positive Consequences: Improving Education Out-\ncomes for Youth Adjudicated Delinquent,’’ 3 Duke F.\nfor L. & Soc. Change 5, 10–12 (2011). The shortcomings\nof these resources often lead to greater high school\ndropout rates and greater subsequent involvement with\nthe adult criminal justice system. Id., 13 n.50.\n  Legal developments subsequent to the change in the\nage of juvenile jurisdiction in Connecticut indicate that\nthe evolution in legal understanding of the needs of\nadolescents has continued. First, in 2010, the United\nStates Supreme Court ruled that life imprisonment with-\nout parole for crimes committed by juveniles was also\nunconstitutional. See Graham v. Florida, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In Graham, the United States Supreme Court\nrelied in a large part on the reasoning of Roper, conclud-\ning that ‘‘[n]o recent data provide reason to reconsider\nthe [c]ourt’s observations in Roper about the nature of\njuveniles. As the petitioner’s amici point out, develop-\nments in psychology and brain science continue to show\nfundamental differences between juvenile and adult\nminds.’’ Id., 68.\n  Then, in 2012, the Connecticut legislature provided\nthe detailed procedure, at issue in this case, for\ndetermining which juvenile cases are transferred to the\nadult criminal docket. See Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June\n2012, No. 12-1, § 280. This enactment made clear that\nhearings on discretionary transfers from juvenile court\nto adult court should occur, for the first time, in the\njuvenile court, rather than in the adult court as required\nby State v. Fernandes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2550226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2550226/state-v-fernandes/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2550226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2550226/state-v-fernandes/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\ncert. denied,      U.S.     , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 1213 (2011). See id., 129–30 (Eveleigh, J., dissenting).\nThe reason for this change was reflected in the testi-\nmony of Judge Christine Keller to the Judiciary Commit-\n\ftee in support of the bill: ‘‘We felt that, number one,\nthat due process hearing should take place before they\nget over to adult court. We know what services are\navailable in juvenile court. We know what we can apply\nto that child from the juvenile court array of services\nand diversions. We may know the child a lot better than\nthe adult court, because we may have had the child in\nfront of us previously. Probation, one of the differences\nbetween an adult court and a juvenile court is in juvenile\ncourt, a probation officer is assigned the minute the\nchild walks into the courthouse . . . we don’t wait\nuntil . . . the case is disposed of to assign a probation\nofficer. So the juvenile judge would waive the totality\nof circumstances, the seriousness of the offense, the\nchild’s history with the juvenile court, and what we\ncould do for the child in the juvenile court and then\ndetermine whether, okay, there’s not much more we\ncan do for this child, off they go to adult court or say,\nno, it’s going to stay here on the discretionary transfers,\nnot the most serious ones.’’ Conn. Joint Standing Com-\nmittee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 13, 2012 Sess., pp.\n4167–68.\n   As this testimony before the legislature demon-\nstrates, because of the unique nature of juvenile court\nand the unique services provided there, a juvenile who\nis transferred from juvenile court to adult court suffers\nan irreparable harm. The harm suffered by a wrongly\ntransferred juvenile is truly irreparable, for when ‘‘the\ndevelopmental window passes for a juvenile, the brain\ncannot go back and redevelop at some point in the\nfuture.’’ A. Giannetti, supra, 30 Buff. Pub. Int. L.J. 46–47.\nI would add that, in my view, the lack of privacy is\nirreparable. Once the juvenile has a public hearing he\ncannot go to a judge to retrieve his privacy. Further,\nwe should not, in my view, ignore the fact that once\nthe juvenile goes to adult court his conviction could\nresult in a criminal record, unless he is granted youthful\noffender status. Certainly, the imposition of a criminal\nrecord on an individual is irreparable and is something\nfor which the juvenile may suffer repercussions the rest\nof his life. A juvenile does not incur a criminal record\nin juvenile court. Once the transfer occurs the possibil-\nity of a criminal record exists. Further, the juvenile that\nis transferred to adult court may face the decision of\nhaving to post bond through a bail bondsman, which\nwould result in an irreparable loss of money that would\nnot be incurred in juvenile court. We have previously\nheld an immediate appeal was appropriate because the\norder required the aggrieved party to engage in some\ncoercive action, such as paying money that could not\nbe recovered on a subsequent appeal.

Lit-\nvaitis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2351485\"><a href=\"/opinion/2351485/litvaitis-v-litvaitis/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 548–49, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972) (con-\ncluding pendente lite order for payment of support was\nfinal judgment); Hiss v.

Certainly, the\n\fjuvenile would never have the opportunity to recover\nthe funds needed to post bond. Further, if a juvenile\nin adult court cannot make bond, he will receive less\nfrequent reviews of his detention. See Practice Book\n§ 30-10 (requiring that juveniles receive detention\nreview hearing every fifteen days). Hearings in the juve-\nnile court also ensure that, to the court’s satisfaction,\nthe juvenile is receiving the proper services. The juve-\nnile loses the use of the juvenile probation officer if a\ntransfer is ordered.\n   As I explained previously in this opinion, General\nStatutes (Supp. 2014) § 46b-127 (b) (1) (C) requires that\nthe court find, inter alia, that ‘‘the best interests of the\nchild and the public will not be served by maintaining\nthe case in the superior court for juvenile matters.’’ It\nis this ‘‘best interests’’ finding that separates this statute\nfrom the youthful offender statute and makes any com-\nparison to other transfer statutes inapposite. The youth-\nful offender statute does not carry any ‘‘best interests\nof the child’’ language. In fact, it is difficult to conjure\nup a scenario when the best interests of the child would\never be served by a transfer to adult court given the\nabsence of privacy, inadequate services and the possi-\nbility of a public record.\n   Further, the very presence of the best interests test\nis an important new element in any consideration under\nthe second prong of Curcio. It is my position that this\nstatute has changed so substantively that any resort to\nan analysis based upon its genealogy is misplaced. A\nhearing regarding the best interests of the child was\nsimply not required in prior revisions of the statute.\nThe adequacy of that hearing and the court’s findings\nmust be subject to appellate review before the transfer\nis completed. If there is no review at that time, in my\nview, the purpose and meaning of Curcio has become\nmeaningless. In State v. Fernandes, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">127</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, this court held that ‘‘[t]herefore, when, as here,\ntreatment as a juvenile is the presumptive norm, and\ntreatment as an adult is the exception, the right to\njuvenile status vests in the juvenile, and the discretion-\nary transfer to criminal court, which is a revocation of\njuvenile status, constitutes a deprivation of a liberty\ninterest cognizable under the due process clause.’’ In\norder to protect these due process rights the legislature\nnow requires that the court consider, as one of the\nrequirements of transfer, that the best interests of the\nchild will not be served by maintaining him in the juve-\nnile system. This required finding represents a sea\nchange in the statute that did not exist when: (1) we\ndecided In re Juvenile Appeal (85–AB); (2) the 1994\nor 1995 amendments were passed; or (3) we decided\nIn re Daniel H. Therefore, any reliance on those cases,\nor on the genealogy of § 46b-127 (b) (1), is misplaced\nand it is more appropriate to engage in an analysis\nunder Curcio.\n\f   We have previously determined that orders of tempo-\nrary custody under General Statutes § 46b-56, which\nrequire a finding on the best interests of the child, are\nimmediately appealable. Madigan v. Madigan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 750–51, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1276</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). In considering\norders for temporary custody under § 46b-56, this court\nhas stated that ‘‘we consider orders of temporary cus-\ntody in light of these constitutional considerations and\nreaffirm our conclusion that an immediate appeal of [a\ncourt order of temporary custody] is the only reason-\nable method of ensuring that the important rights sur-\nrounding the parent-child relationship are adequately\nprotected.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re\nShamika F., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">773</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001).\nThis court continued: ‘‘[T]he best interest of the chil-\ndren, especially their interest in family stability, sup-\nports our analysis. . . . Therefore, we conclude that\ntemporary custody orders are immediately appealable\nnot only to protect a parent’s interests in their children,\nbut also to protect the individual interests of the chil-\ndren.’’ Id., 405–406. Likewise, in In re Jeisean M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404–405, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004), this court held\nthat an extension of commitment, which also requires\na factual finding regarding the child’s best interests, is\nan immediately appealable final judgment.\n   As the foregoing demonstrates, this court has rou-\ntinely determined that, where the individual best inter-\nests of a child are concerned, orders affecting those\ninterests are appealable final judgments. This is the\nharmonious body of law which, in my view, we should\nmaintain. In fact, my research has not revealed a case\ninvolving a statute that contained language regarding\nthe ‘‘best interests’’ of a child in which this court has\nnot allowed an immediate appeal from an interlocutory\norder of any kind. Certainly, the revocation of juvenile\nstatus, which we have held to be a liberty interest;\nsee State v. Fernandes, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; must\nconstitute an appealable judgment under Curcio.\nIndeed, once the juvenile is transferred he loses valu-\nable services and his privacy. Further, he loses the right\nto have his detention reviewed every fifteen days. He\nmay lose the right to be released to his parents or\nguardian, or other suitable person or agency without\nthe possibility of having to incur the expense of posting\na bond, which may or may not become problematic. In\nthis case, the required finding regarding best interest\nwas recently added to the statute. When a court makes\na ruling that may affect those interests, it follows that\nCurcio requires that ruling to constitute an appealable\nfinal judgment.\n  The opinion of the majority, in my view, leads to the\nabsurd result that before a juvenile can challenge a\njudge’s decision to transfer the juvenile to adult court,\nthe juvenile must give up his or her right to privacy,\nbe hindered by a public criminal record, and give up\n\fvaluable services that may aid his or her development\nwhile an appeal is pending. The majority contends that\nthis result is mandated by the deletion of the final judg-\nment wording in the statute. As noted earlier, I respect-\nfully disagree with this conclusion because the wording\nof this statute is completely different from the earlier\nversions, and both our case law and our acceptance of\nscientific studies regarding juveniles mandate a differ-\nent result. There are specific findings which now must\nbe made by the trial court prior to ordering the transfer.\nWhat if, for instance, the judge failed to make the best\ninterest finding, yet ordered the transfer to adult court?\nIs the majority’s position such that a juvenile would\nhave to wait for a trial in adult court before the juvenile\ncould appeal the judge’s clear error committed in juve-\nnile court? The consequences of such a result are much\ntoo severe for the juvenile and, in my view, directly\ncontrary to the intent of Curcio.\n   During legislative debates in 1994, some of the legisla-\ntors remarked that the final judgment clause should be\nremoved from the mandatory transfer provision\nbecause the transfer appeals took too long. It is note-\nworthy that the appellate system of the Judicial Branch\nof this state has recognized this deficiency and insti-\ntuted a system in which all juvenile appeals are expe-\ndited and the number of extensions has been\nsignificantly reduced. Presently, the average case takes\na total of approximately six months from the time the\nappeal is filed until the appellate decision. In the Appel-\nlate Court the period is 185.94 days. In the Supreme\nCourt the period is 183.44 days. These statistics demon-\nstrate a vast improvement in the time period within\nwhich an appeal involving juvenile matters is presently\nheard.3 In the present case, the respondent was trans-\nferred to adult court on November 15, 2012. The order\nwas not stayed. At the time of oral argument on March\n20, 2014, his case still had not been heard in adult court.\nHe has lost sixteen months of services he could have\nhad in juvenile court. He has also lost the benefit of\nhaving sixteen months of supervision by a juvenile pro-\nbation officer. His hearings have been open to the pub-\nlic, and he now faces the possibility of having a criminal\nrecord. How could this transfer have possibly been in\nhis best interests? If indeed, the 1994 act omitted the\nprovision providing for an immediate appeal from man-\ndatory transfers was because those appeals took too\nlong, the pendulum has swung 180 degrees; in the\nabsence of a speedy trial motion, it takes far longer to\ntry the juvenile in adult court, compared to the time in\nwhich the juvenile could have an appeal heard in the\nappellate system.\n   I would, therefore, conclude that the discretionary\ntransfer order of a juvenile from the Superior Court for\njuvenile matters to the Superior Court for adult matters\nmeets the second prong of Curcio and, therefore, is an\nappealable interlocutory order. In view of the potential\n\firreparable harm to the juvenile, I would conclude that\na stay should be in place while the appeal is pending,\nand the juvenile should continue to receive juvenile\nservices during the course of the appeal. He should also\ncontinue to be supervised by his juvenile probation\nofficer. The effect on both the juvenile and his or her\nfamily is too devastating to allow a discretionary order\nto languish while the juvenile endures a criminal trial\nwithout the benefit of having the transfer order\nreviewed by an appellate court.\n   I would conclude both that the order was an appeal-\nable final judgment under Curcio and that the best\ninterests of the juvenile demanded that he stay within\nthe jurisdiction of the Superior Court for juvenile mat-\nters while the appeal was pending. Accordingly, I would\nreverse the judgment of the Appellate Court. Therefore,\nI respectfully dissent.\n   1\n     As the majority notes, § 46b-127 has recently been amended in a manner\nnot relevant to the present appeal. See footnote 1 of the majority opinion;\nsee also Public Acts 2013, No. 13-258, § 5. Hereinafter, unless otherwise\nnoted, all references to § 46b-127 are to the version appearing in the 2014\nsupplement to the General Statutes.\n   2\n     As noted by the majority, the legislature moved the statutory provision\ngoverning discretionary transfers from § 46b-126 (a) to § 46b-127 (b) in 1995.\nSee Public Acts 1995, No. 95-225, §§ 13 and 39.\n   3\n     Obviously, in the vast minority of juvenile cases in which certification\nis granted from the Appellate Court to the Supreme Court, which represents\na very small percentage of the overall statistics, the time period from filing\nto decision is longer.\n\f</pre>",
