The\ndistrict court granted Standridge and Phillips’s motion for partial summary judgment\non July 15, 2005, and entered final judgment in their favor on February 10, 2006.\nUnion Pacific appeals. For the reasons discussed below, we reverse.\n\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n\n       Union Pacific, a freight company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, provides\nhealth care benefits to those of its employees who are covered by collective bargaining\nagreements (“agreement employees”). These agreement employees receive benefits\nthrough one of five plans. While the plans provide benefits for services such as\nroutine physical exams, tetanus shots and drug and alcohol treatments, they exclude\ncoverage of allergy serum, immunization agents, biological sera and drugs that treat\ninfertility. They also exclude both male and female contraceptive methods,\nprescription and non-prescription, when used for the sole purpose of contraception.\nUnion Pacific only covers contraception when medically necessary for a non-\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fcontraceptive purpose such as regulating menstrual cycles, treating skin problems or\navoiding serious health risks associated with pregnancy.\n\n\n       Standridge and Phillips are two of the approximately 1,500 female agreement\nemployees of child-bearing age employed by Union Pacific during the time period\nrelevant to this litigation. Standridge and Phillips used prescription contraception for\ncontraceptive purposes, and the plans did not cover the costs of their contraception.\nThey, along with two other female employees, brought individual suits against Union\nPacific alleging that Union Pacific discriminated against its female employees by not\nproviding coverage of prescription contraception in violation of Title VII, as amended\nby the PDA. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the four\nsimilar actions against Union Pacific and transferred the consolidated action to the\nDistrict of Nebraska. The district court granted class certification, named Standridge\nand Phillips as class representatives, and certified the class as “[a]ll females employed\nby Union Pacific Railroad Company after February 9, 2001, enrolled in one of the\nAgreement Plans who used prescription contraception, at least in part for the purpose\nof preventing pregnancy, without insurance reimbursement from said Plan.”\n\n\n        The district court granted Standridge and Phillips’s motion for partial summary\njudgment, finding that Union Pacific’s failure to cover prescription contraception\nconstitutes a violation of Title VII, as amended by the PDA. In holding that the\ncoverage was discriminatory against women, the district court cited the language of\nthe PDA, the purpose of its enactment, the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission’s (“EEOC”) interpretation of the PDA’s application to prescription\ncontraception and reasoning from other district court decisions. The district court\nrejected Standridge and Phillips’s argument that unplanned pregnancies have a\nnegative social impact. It also rejected Union Pacific’s arguments that a requirement\nto cover prescription contraception would have a large financial impact; that the denial\nof all contraception results in equal treatment of men and women; that contraception\n\n                                          -4-\n\fdeals with fertility and is not a medical condition “related to” pregnancy; that Union\nPacific’s covered benefits are treatment-related, not preventive; and that there is no\nmedical necessity for contraception with respect to fertility because pregnancy is a\nnormal human condition. The district court held that Union Pacific violated Title VII,\nas amended by the PDA, because “it treats medical care women need to prevent\npregnancy less favorably than it treats medical care needed to prevent other medical\nconditions that are no greater threat to employees’ health than is pregnancy.” In re\nUnion Pac. R.R. Employment Practices Litig., 378 F. Supp. 2d 1139, 1149 (D. Neb.\n2005). After a stipulation by the parties regarding attorneys’ fees, the district court\nentered final judgment in favor of Standridge and Phillips, staying enforcement\npending Union Pacific’s appeal.\n\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n\n       Union Pacific argues that the PDA does not require contraception to be included\nin its health care coverage and that its health care coverage does not discriminate\nagainst women in violation of Title VII. We review de novo the district court’s grant\nof summary judgment, viewing all of the evidence “in the light most favorable to the\nnonmoving party.” Gilooly v. Mo. Dep’t of Health & Senior Servs., 421 F.3d 734, 738\n(8th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation omitted). We apply the same standard as the\ndistrict court, and we also review de novo the district court’s interpretation of statutes.\nFitzgerald v. Camdenton R-III Sch. Dist., 439 F.3d 773, 775 (8th Cir. 2006).\n\n\n      A.      PDA Analysis\n\n\n      As an initial matter, the district court incorrectly characterized Union Pacific’s\npolicy as the denial of prescription contraception coverage for women. Union Pacific\nexcludes all types of contraception, whether prescription, non-prescription or surgical\n\n                                           -5-\n\fand whether for men or women, unless an employee has a non-contraception medical\nnecessity for the contraception. While prescription contraception is currently only\navailable for women, non-prescription contraception is available for men and women.\nTherefore, the issue is whether Union Pacific’s policy of denying coverage for all\ncontraception violates Title VII, as amended by the PDA.\n\n\n      Union Pacific argues that the district court erred in holding that the PDA\nrequires coverage of contraception. It contends that the PDA only relates to\ndiscrimination against a woman for medical conditions that occur (or may occur) after\nshe becomes pregnant, while the use of contraception only relates to human fertility\nbefore pregnancy. Standridge and Phillips argue that contraception is covered by the\nPDA because it is “related to” the condition of pregnancy.\n\n\n       Title VII provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\nemployer . . . to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . . sex.”\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Congress created the PDA to amend this provision in\nresponse to the Supreme Court’s holding that the exclusion of pregnancy benefits did\nnot violate Title VII. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 145-46 (1976). The\nPDA provides:\n\n\n       The terms “because of sex” or “on the basis of sex” include, but are not\n       limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related\n       medical conditions; and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or\n       related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-\n       related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit\n       programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or\n       inability to work . . . . This subsection shall not require an employer to\n       pay for health insurance benefits for abortion, except where the life of\n       the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f          except where medical complications have arisen from an abortion.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k).\n\n\n     Neither the circuit courts nor the Supreme Court has considered whether the\nPDA applies to contraception.1 The Supreme Court, though, has discussed the scope\n\n      1\n        District court decisions are split as to whether the PDA requires companies to\nprovide coverage of contraception. In Stocking v. AT&T Corp., the district court\ninitially expressed skepticism about the proposition but ultimately held that the PDA\nrequires coverage. 436 F. Supp. 2d 1014, 1016-17 (W.D. Mo. 2006). In Cooley v.\nDaimlerChrysler Corp., the district court denied Chrysler’s motion to dismiss because\nit found that its exclusion of prescription contraceptives could constitute gender\ndiscrimination. 281 F. Supp. 2d 979, 984-85 (E.D. Mo. 2003). In Mauldin v. Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc., a district court certified a class of female employees alleging that\nWal-Mart’s lack of coverage for prescription contraception was a violation of Title\nVII, as amended by the PDA. No. 01-2755, 2002 WL 2022334 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 23,\n2002). In Erickson v. Bartell Drug Co., the district court held that a company’s\nexclusion of prescription contraceptive benefits was discriminatory under Title VII,\nas amended by the PDA, because Congress’ response to Gilbert required employers\nto provide women-only benefits and only women used prescription contraceptives.\n141 F. Supp. 2d 1266, 1270-71 (W.D. Wash. 2001).\n\n       Other district courts, though, have concluded that the exclusion of contraception\nfrom coverage is not a violation of the PDA. In Cummins v. Illinois, the district court\nheld that the exclusion of contraception was not a violation of the PDA. No. 02-4201\n(S.D. Ill. Aug. 30, 2005). It disagreed with the argument that the exclusion of\ncontraception coverage only affected the health of a woman and held that both men\nand women have active roles in contraception and are affected by the exclusion of\ncontraception coverage. Id., slip op. at 16. In Alexander v. American Airlines, Inc.,\nthe district court dismissed the case on standing grounds, saying also that “[b]y no\nstretch of the imagination does the prohibition against discrimination based on\n‘pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition[s]’ require the provision of\ncontraceptives as part of the treatment for infertility. Moreover, the plan does not\ncover provision of contraceptives to anyone, male or female.” No. 02-252, 2002 WL\n731815, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2002). In EEOC v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,\n\n                                          -7-\n\fof the PDA in Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U.S. 669\n(1983), and International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural\nImplement Workers of America, UAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187 (1991).\nIn Newport News, the Supreme Court held that a company’s health insurance plan that\nprovided greater pregnancy benefits to its female employees than to the female\nspouses of its male employees was a violation of Title VII, as amended by the PDA.\n462 U.S. at 685. In its opinion, the Court acknowledged that the enactment of the\nPDA overturned its Gilbert decision. Id. at 676. The Court further analyzed the PDA\nin Johnson Controls in the context of a bona fide occupational qualification defense.\nJohnson Controls would not allow a woman who had the potential to become pregnant\nto work in jobs with actual or potential lead exposure because of the associated fetal\nhealth risks. Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at 191. The Court held that an employer\ncould not prevent a woman from working in those positions when it did not also\nprevent men from working in those positions, “unless her reproductive potential\nprevent[ed] her from performing the duties of her job.” Id. at 206. Since reproductive\npotential did not prevent women from performing the duties of the positions in\nquestion, the Court held that discriminating against women on the basis of potential\npregnancy was a violation of Title VII, as amended by the PDA. Id.\n\n\n      In Krauel v. Iowa Methodist Medical Center, 95 F.3d 674, 679 (8th Cir. 1996),\nwe applied these Supreme Court precedents and held that the PDA does not extend to\n\nfemale employees alleged that a health plan’s exclusion of coverage of oral\ncontraception was sex discrimination under Title VII. 141 F. Supp. 2d 1216 (D.\nMinn. 2001). The district court denied the employer’s motion to dismiss because the\nfemale employees stated claims of disparate treatment and disparate impact, but it\nobserved that the female employees did not allege the plan violated the PDA. Id. at\n1218 n.1. The court then cited Krauel v. Iowa Methodist Medical Center, 95 F.3d 674\n(8th Cir. 1996), and offered that it had “serious doubts about the merits of a PDA\nclaim in this context. The Eighth Circuit has made clear that prevention of conception\nis outside the scope of the PDA.” Id.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\finfertility treatments. We concluded that the phrase “related medical conditions” in\nthe PDA refers only to medical conditions associated with “pregnancy” and\n“childbirth,” the specific terms that precede the general phrase. Id. (quoting Norfolk\n& W. Ry. Co. v. Am. Train Dispatchers Ass’n, 499 U.S. 117, 129 (1991), for the\nprinciple that “when a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be\nunderstood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration”).\nInfertility is “strikingly different” from pregnancy and childbirth because infertility\nprevents conception, while pregnancy, childbirth and medical conditions related to\nthem can occur only after conception. Id. Therefore, Krauel holds that infertility is\n“outside of the PDA’s protection because it is not pregnancy, childbirth, or a related\nmedical condition.” Id. at 679-80.\n\n\n       In concluding that the PDA does not extend to infertility, we also distinguished\nthe Supreme Court’s holding in Johnson Controls. While noting that the PDA does\ncover differential treatment of an employee based on health concerns that may arise\nduring her pregnancy, we held that Johnson Controls does not support an expansion\nof the PDA to cover fertility matters prior to conception because “[p]otential\npregnancy, unlike infertility, is a medical condition that is sex-related because only\nwomen can become pregnant . . . . [B]ecause the policy of denying insurance benefits\nfor treatment of fertility problems applies to both female and male workers . . . [it] is\ngender-neutral . . . .” Id. at 680.\n\n\n        With the guidance of these decisions, we now determine whether contraception\nis “related to” pregnancy for PDA purposes. While contraception may certainly affect\nthe causal chain that leads to pregnancy, we have specifically rejected the argument\nthat a causal connection, by itself, results in a medical condition being “related to”\npregnancy for PDA purposes. Id. at 679 (rejecting the argument that “infertility is\nrelated to pregnancy because there is a causal connection between such a condition\nand pregnancy”). Union Pacific argues that contraception, analogous to infertility, is\n\n                                          -9-\n\fgender-neutral. Standridge and Phillips argue that the district court correctly found\nthat contraception implicates potential pregnancy and that the PDA covers\ncontraception because it prevents a gender-specific condition.\n\n\n      Following Krauel, we hold that contraception is not “related to” pregnancy for\nPDA purposes because, like infertility treatments, contraception is a treatment that is\nonly indicated prior to pregnancy. Contraception is not a medical treatment that\noccurs when or if a woman becomes pregnant; instead, contraception prevents\npregnancy from even occurring. See Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 271\n(11th ed. 2005) (defining contraception as the “deliberate prevention of conception\nor impregnation”). As in Krauel, the result in Johnson Controls does not require\ncoverage of contraception because contraception is not a gender-specific term like\n“potential pregnancy,” but rather applies to both men and women like “infertility.”\nIn conclusion, the PDA does not require coverage of contraception because\ncontraception is not “related to” pregnancy for PDA purposes and is gender-neutral.2\n\n\n       We are not persuaded by the contention of Standridge and Phillips and the\namici members of Congress that Congress intended to address the coverage of\nprescription contraception in the PDA. In their views, the PDA was a “broad\nresponse” to the Gilbert decision, and Congress wanted to protect women in all areas\nconcerning pregnancy, including the prevention of it. However, the plain language\nof the PDA makes no reference to contraception. Additionally, the House and Senate\n\n\n      2\n        We note that as the phrase “relate to” does not broaden the scope of the PDA\nso that it extends to contraception, the PDA’s use of the phrase “include, but are not\nlimited to,” also does not expand the scope of the PDA. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k).\nInstead, when that phrase is read in conjunction with the preceding phrase, it becomes\nclear that it refers to Title VII in its entirety and emphasizes that Title VII’s\nprohibition on sex-based discrimination is not restricted solely to discrimination on\nthe basis of “pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.” Id.\n\n                                         -10-\n\flegislative histories do not mention contraception. See Erickson, 141 F. Supp. 2d at\n1274 (noting that Congress had “no specific intent regarding coverage for prescription\ncontraceptives” in 1978). This silence by Congress on the issue of contraception\ncannot be interpreted to expand the PDA to cover contraception. See Tafflin v. Levitt,\n493 U.S. 455, 462 (1990) (dismissing a party’s argument concerning jurisdiction\nbecause Congress’ silence indicated it “did not even consider the issue”); see also\nKrauel, 95 F.3d at 680.3\n\n\n       We also do not agree with Standridge and Phillips’s argument that the PDA’s\nexpress exclusion of coverage of abortion, without an accompanying express\nexclusion of coverage for contraception, implies an intent to include coverage of\ncontraception. Abortion is “the termination of a pregnancy,” Merriam-Webster’s\nCollegiate Dictionary 3, while contraception prevents pregnancy from even occurring.\nWhile we do not need to decide whether the PDA would cover abortion without this\nexclusion, abortion arguably would be “related to” pregnancy in a manner that\ncontraception is not because abortion can only occur when a woman is pregnant. In\ncontrast, there would be no reason for Congress to expressly exclude a treatment that\nis not “related to” pregnancy for PDA purposes, such as contraception.\n\n\n      Finally, we are not persuaded by the EEOC decision that interpreted the PDA\nas requiring employers to cover prescription contraception for women if they cover\n“other prescription drugs and devices, or other types of services, that are used to\n\n      3\n       Amici members of Congress emphasize their intent that the PDA cover\ncontraception. However, in our constrained role of interpreting a statute, we cannot\nassume that these amici members represent the viewpoints of a majority of both\nhouses of Congress in 1978. Absent a clear mandate of Congress, it is not our role to\ndetermine what medical services employers should provide to their employees. “If\nCongress enacted into law something different from what it intended, then it should\namend the statute to conform it to its intent.” Lamie v. U.S. Tr., 540 U.S. 526, 542\n(2004).\n\n                                        -11-\n\fprevent the occurrences of other medical conditions.” EEOC Commission Decision\non Coverage of Contraception (Dec. 14, 2000), available at\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/decision-contraception.html.              An agency’s\ninterpretation that is found in an opinion letter, policy statement, agency manual or\nenforcement guideline “lack[s] the force of law” and is not entitled to deference under\nChevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).\nChristensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000); see also EEOC v. Arabian\nAm. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 256-58 (1991), superceded by Pub. L. No. 102-166 §\n109(a) (1991) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f)). This EEOC decision\nis similar to a policy statement or enforcement guideline,4 and we respect such\ninterpretations “only to the extent that those interpretations have the ‘power to\npersuade.’” Christensen, 529 U.S. at 587 (quoting Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S.\n134, 140 (1944)). Since Congress did not give the EEOC rule-making authority, the\namount of deference we give to this decision “will depend upon the thoroughness\nevident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier\nand later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if\nlacking power to control.” Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. at 257 (internal quotation\nomitted).\n\n\n      We find the EEOC decision to be unpersuasive. The decision addressed a\npolicy that denied coverage of prescription contraception but included coverage of the\nsurgical contraceptive methods of vasectomies and tubal ligations. Union Pacific’s\ncoverage is different because it excludes coverage of all contraception for women and\nmen, both prescription and surgical. Additionally, the decision compares prescription\ncontraception to the broadest possible spectrum of other preventive treatments and\n\n\n      4\n      The decision’s opening paragraph identifies it is “a formal statement of\nCommission policy as applied to the facts at issue in these charges.” EEOC\nCommission Decision on Coverage of Contraception (Dec. 14, 2000) (emphasis\nadded).\n\n                                          -12-\n\fservices without citing a persuasive basis for doing so. Furthermore, the EEOC did\nnot issue any guidance on the issue of coverage of prescription contraception until 22\nyears after the enactment of the PDA. The delay brings into question the consistency\nand persuasiveness of the EEOC’s position. Therefore, we find this decision\nunpersuasive on the question before us.\n\n\n       In conclusion, based on the language of the PDA and our previous holding in\nKrauel, we hold that the PDA does not encompass contraception. Contraception, like\ninfertility treatments, is a treatment that is only indicated prior to pregnancy because\ncontraception actually prevents pregnancy from occurring. Furthermore, like\ninfertility, contraception is a gender-neutral term. Therefore, Union Pacific’s denial\nof coverage for contraception for both sexes did not discriminate against its female\nagreement employees in violation of Title VII, as amended by the PDA.\n\n\n      B.     Title VII Analysis\n\n\n        Along with its argument that the PDA does not require coverage of\ncontraception, Union Pacific argues that its exclusion of contraception coverage does\nnot discriminate against its female agreement employees under a general Title VII\nanalysis. Title VII prevents an employer from making employment decisions that are\nbased on an employee’s gender. See Kratzer v. Rockwell, 398 F.3d 1040, 1046 (8th\nCir. 2005). However, when an employer’s action is not based on a sex classification,\nit is not a sex-based violation of Title VII. See Piantanida v. Wyman Ctr., Inc., 116\nF.3d 340, 342 (8th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n      Standridge and Phillips brought a claim of disparate treatment based on gender\ndiscrimination. To establish this disparate treatment claim, Standridge and Phillips\nmust show, in part, that “other employees outside of the protected group were\n\n                                         -13-\n\fallegedly treated more favorably and were similarly situated in all relevant respects.”\nGilooly, 421 F.3d at 739 (internal quotation omitted). While an employer must treat\nits employees similarly, it does not have to treat employees in a protected class more\nfavorably than other employees. Texas Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S.\n248, 259 (1981) (holding that Title VII does not require an employer to give\npreferential treatment to minorities or women).\n\n\n       In determining whether Union Pacific treated the similarly situated male\nemployees more favorably than the protected female employees, we must compare the\nhealth benefits that Union Pacific’s plans provided for men and women. The district\ncourt compared the “medicines or medical services [that] prevent employees from\ndeveloping diseases or conditions that pose an equal or lesser threat to employees’\nhealth than does pregnancy.” Union Pacific, 378 F. Supp. 2d at 1148. It found that\nthe health plans treated men more favorably because the plans covered preventive\nmedicines and services such as medication for male-pattern baldness, routine physical\nexams, tetanus shots, and drug and alcohol treatments. Union Pacific argues that the\ndistrict court’s comparator was too broad because it treated pregnancy as a disease that\nneeded to be prevented instead of focusing on the narrow issue of contraception.\n\n\n      We decline to address whether pregnancy is a “disease.” Instead, we simply\nhold that the district court erred in using the comparator “medicines or medical\nservices [that] prevent employees from developing diseases or conditions that pose an\nequal or lesser threat to employees’ health than does pregnancy.”5 As previously\n\n\n      5\n       Even if we adopted the district court’s characterization that contraception\nprevents a “disease” only suffered by women, it is not clear Union Pacific’s exclusion\nof contraception coverage would be a violation of Title VII under the Newport News\nanalysis. In Newport News, the Supreme Court held that a policy violated Title VII,\nas amended by the PDA, because the female employees received better pregnancy\nbenefits than the female spouses of the male employees. Newport News, 462 U.S. at\n\n                                         -14-\n\fdiscussed, this case concerns Union Pacific’s coverage of contraception for men and\nwomen. The proper comparator is the provision of the medical benefit in question,\ncontraception. Union Pacific’s health plans do not cover any contraception used by\nwomen such as birth control, sponges, diaphragms, intrauterine devices or tubal\nligations or any contraception used by men such as condoms and vasectomies.\nTherefore, the coverage provided to women is not less favorable than that provided\nto men. Thus, there is no violation of Title VII.\n\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n\n       Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s judgment and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\nBYE, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n      The Court holds Union Pacific’s exclusion of prescription contraception\ncoverage does not violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e\n- 2000e-17 (Title VII ), as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978\n(PDA). Because I agree with how the district court framed the discrimination inquiry,\nand therefore agree with its conclusion that Union Pacific’s policy discriminates\nagainst women under Title VII, as amended by the PDA, I respectfully dissent.\n\n       The Court ends with the following pronouncement in footnote five: “Union\nPacific provides an equal policy for its female and male employees.” Ante at 15. This\n\n\n\n\n684. In this case, however, the female spouses of the male employees receive the\nsame benefits as the female employees. Therefore, Newport News suggests that Union\nPacific provides an equal policy for its female and male employees.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fis a good place to begin. When one looks at the medical effect6 of Union Pacific’s\nfailure to provide insurance coverage for prescription contraception, the inequality of\ncoverage is clear. This failure only medically affects females, as they bear all of the\nhealth consequences of unplanned pregnancies. An insurance policy providing\ncomprehensive coverage for preventative medical care, including coverage for\npreventative prescription drugs used exclusively by males, but fails to cover\nprescription contraception used exclusively by females, can hardly be called equal.\nIt just isn't so.\n\n       The Court begins its analysis by finding the district court erred in confining its\ninquiry to Union Pacific’s exclusion of coverage for prescription contraception used\nby women because its policy also excludes coverage for non-prescription\ncontraception coverage (condoms) and surgical procedures to prevent male fertility\n(vasectomies). The district court did not err in limiting its inquiry to prescription\ncontraception. That its policy does not provide coverage for condoms is\nunsurprising—Union Pacific has not identified any health insurance policy which\nwould provide coverage for non-prescription, contraceptive devices available in drug\nstores and gas stations nationwide. As for vasectomies, even if we were to look at its\nexclusion of coverage for vasectomies, the policy nonetheless discriminates against\nfemales. When a policy excludes coverage for vasectomies, the medical effect of this\nexclusion is born entirely by women, as the record demonstrates women are the only\ngender which can become pregnant.\n\n      The Court holds Union Pacific’s failure to cover prescription contraception is\nnot covered by the PDA because prescription contraception use occurs prior to\npregnancy. Because such reasoning is at odds with the Supreme Court’s construction\n\n      6\n        The logical focus here is on the medical effect of Union Pacific’s failure to\ncover prescription contraception. This case is about health insurance coverage and\ndetermining whether such coverage discriminates against women. There is no reason\nto stray from the bounds of a health paradigm when making this determination.\n\n                                          -16-\n\fof the PDA, I respectfully disagree. First, it must be noted Title VII is a remedial,\ncivil rights statute and, as such, it should be broadly construed. Allen v. Entergy\nCorp., Inc., 193 F.3d 1010, 1020 (8th Cir. 1999). Title VII provides in relevant part:\n\n      It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer--(1) . . . to\n      discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,\n      terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n      individual’s . . . sex . . . ; or (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\n      employees . . . in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n      individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his\n      status as an employee, because of such individual’s . . . sex . . ..\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). Congress enacted the PDA to amend the definition of sex in\nTitle VII. As such, the PDA provides in relevant part:\n\n      The terms “because of sex” or “on the basis of sex” include, but are not\n      limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related\n      medical conditions; and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or\n      related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all\n      employment-related purposes . . ..\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k).\n\n       While the plain language of the PDA does not specifically include pre-\npregnancy conditions, there is some indication Congress intended the act to cover pre-\npregnancy discrimination. Congress used the phrase “related medical conditions.”\nThe word “related” indicates the PDA covers more than mere pregnancy. In this case,\nthe district court relied on the second clause of the PDA which is drafted even more\nbroadly than the first, covering “women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related\nmedical conditions.” In re Union Pac. R.R. Employment Practices Litig., 378 F. Supp.\n2d 1139, 1143 (D. Neb. 2005) (emphasis added) (“Because the PDA plainly states that\nits protection from discrimination, including discrimination in ‘receipt of benefits\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\funder fringe benefit programs,’ applies to ‘women affected by pregnancy’ and not\nmerely to pregnant women, the clear language of the statute requires that [Union\nPacific’s] Plans treat the risk of pregnancy no less favorably than the Plans treat other\nsimilar health risks.”). Finally, as noted by certain members of Congress, writing as\namici on behalf of Standridge and Phillips, the first clause of the PDA specifically\nstates: “The terms ‘because of sex’ or ‘on the basis of sex’ include, but are not limited\nto, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.”\nBrief for Certain Members of the Congress as Amicus Curiae 4. The use of the phrase\n“include, but are not limited to” mandates a broad reading of the PDA because it\nsuggests Congress was being illustrative rather than exclusive with the list following\nthe phrase. See Fed. Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U.S. 95,\n100 (1941) (“[T]he term ‘including’ is not one of all-embracing definition, but\nconnotes simply an illustrative application of the general principle.”). The PDA’s\nlegislative history also promotes a broad construction of the act to include pre-\npregnancy. Representative Ronald Sarasin explained the PDA gives a woman “the\nright . . . to be financially and legally protected before, during, and after her\npregnancy.” 124 Cong. Rec. 38574 (daily ed. October 14, 1978) (statement of Rep.\nSarasin, a manager of the House version of the PDA) (emphasis added).\n\n       Even if Congress did not intend the PDA to cover pre-pregnancy\ndiscrimination, the Supreme Court ostensibly broadened the scope of the PDA to\ninclude pre-pregnancy discrimination in International Union, United Automobile,\nAerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers, UAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499\nU.S. 187 (1991). The Court found classifying employees on the basis of childbearing\ncapacity, whether or not they were already pregnant, “must be regarded, for Title VII\npurposes, in the same light as explicit sex discrimination.” Id. at 199. In Johnson\nControls, a battery manufacturer enforced a gender-based, fetal-protection policy\nexcluding fertile women (women who were pregnant or capable of becoming\npregnant) from working in jobs where they would be exposed to lead. The bias was\nclear, as the policy at issue excluded only women. Id. at 197. The Court used the\n\n                                          -18-\n\fPDA to bolster its holding the policy discriminated on its face as it “explicitly\nclassifies on the basis of potential for pregnancy.” The choice to treat all “female\nemployees as potentially pregnant” was discriminatory. Id. at 199.\n\n      This court addressed the scope of the first clause of the PDA in Krauel v. Iowa\nMethodist Medical Center, 95 F.3d 674, 679-80 (8th Cir. 1996). In Krauel, we held\nan insurance policy excluding coverage for infertility treatments did not violate the\nPDA, as treatment for infertility is not treatment of a medical condition related to\npregnancy or childbirth. Because “[p]regnancy and childbirth, which occur after\nconception, are strikingly different from infertility, which prevents conception,” we\nheld “the District Court properly concluded that infertility is outside of the PDA’s\nprotection because it is not pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.” Id.\nWe explicitly acknowledged however, under Johnson Controls, “[p]otential\npregnancy, unlike infertility, is a medical condition that is sex-related because only\nwomen can become pregnant.” Id. at 680. Because infertility, unlike potential\npregnancy, is gender-neutral, it could not form the basis of a PDA claim. Id.\n\n       Krauel undoubtedly limited the scope of the PDA. The Court suggests Krauel\ndrew the line at pregnancy, and held the PDA does not apply to infertility treatments\nbecause infertility, by its definition, occurs prior to pregnancy. In my assessment,\nKrauel cannot draw such a bright line because of Johnson Controls. This court has,\nafter Krauel, at least implicitly indicated it will not draw the line of PDA coverage at\npregnancy. See Walsh v. Nat’l Computer Sys., 332 F.3d 1150, 1160 (8th Cir. 2003)\n(“[Plaintiff] asserts that she was discriminated against . . . because she is a woman\nwho had been pregnant, had taken a maternity leave, and might become pregnant\nagain. ‘Potential pregnancy . . . is a medical condition that is sex-related because only\nwomen can become pregnant.’” (emphasis added) (quoting Krauel, 95 F.3d at 680)).\nOther circuits have followed suit. See Kocak v. Cmty. Health Partners of Ohio, Inc.,\n400 F.3d 466, 469-70 (6th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 338 (2005) (holding, in\nlight of Johnson Controls, the district court erred in concluding the plaintiff was not\n\n                                          -19-\n\fprotected by the PDA because she was not pregnant when the defendant refused to\nhire her).\n\n       Potential pregnancy, like infertility, by its definition occurs prior to conception.\nThe same can be said for the use of prescription contraception. The reason Krauel\ndetermined the PDA did not apply to an employer’s failure to cover infertility\ntreatments, even in light of Johnson Controls, was because infertility, unlike potential\npregnancy, is a gender-neutral affliction. After Krauel, denial of coverage for\ninfertility treatments does not implicate the PDA because infertility affects both men\nand women. The Court suggests infertility treatments and contraception are both pre-\npregnancy and this fact makes the difference. Although both are used prior to\nconception, when one looks at the medical effect of the denial of insurance coverage,\nprescription contraception is easily distinguishable from infertility treatments. As the\ndistrict court aptly notes: “Health plans that deny coverage for contraception, by\ndefinition, affect only the health of women.” In re Union Pac., 378 F. Supp. 2d at\n1145. With prescription contraception a woman controls her potential pregnancy.\nSuch contraception is necessarily gender-related because it prevents pregnancy only\nin women. Without contraception, a sexually active, fertile woman is almost certain\nto become pregnant.7 Once pregnant, only the woman’s health is affected. Infertility,\nby contrast, is a word used to describe a number of medical conditions affecting both\nmen and women. When a man or a woman is infertile, he or she is unable to\ncontribute to reproduction as his or her reproductive organs do not function properly.\nInfertility treatments may correct the medical condition of infertility in both men and\nwomen, allowing them to effectively make the necessary contribution to reproduction.\nThus, prescription contraception and infertility treatments are like apples and oranges.\nAlthough both relate to pregnancy in a general sense, prescription contraception is,\n\n      7\n       As Standridge and Phillips note, without contraception, a woman is likely to\nbecome pregnant twelve to fifteen times over the course of her reproductive life, and,\nin any given year, 85 out of 100 sexually active women of childbearing age will\nbecome pregnant.\n\n                                           -20-\n\funlike fertility treatments, at its very core gender-specific. As such, a PDA claim\nbased on a failure to provide prescription contraception coverage is not foreclosed by\nKrauel. More importantly, the Court’s holding here—“that contraception is not\n‘related to’ pregnancy for PDA purposes because, like infertility treatments,\ncontraception is a treatment that is only indicated prior to pregnancy,” ante at 10,—is\ninconsistent with Johnson Controls.\n\n        In addition to holding the PDA does not apply under Krauel, the Court also\nholds Union Pacific’s policy does not discriminate against women under Title VII,\nbecause the policy excludes contraception coverage for both men and women.\nBecause I agree with the district court’s comparison—between the insurance coverage\nprovided to men and woman for all types of preventative medicine—I also dissent\nwith regard to this holding. Whether something constitutes discrimination under Title\nVII, as amended by the PDA, is a matter of comparison. “The PDA does not create\nsubstantive rights to preferential treatment.” Deneen v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 132\nF.3d 431, 436 (8th Cir. 1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This\ncourt has noted quite the contrary: “[T]he PDA allows employers [to] treat pregnant\nwomen as badly as they treat similarly affected but nonpregnant employees. The\nopposite, however, is also true–employers must treat pregnant women as well as they\ntreat similarly affected employees.” Id. at 436-37 (internal citations omitted). “The\nPDA does not require an employer to overlook the work restrictions of pregnant\nwomen unless the employer overlooks the comparable work restrictions of other\nemployees.” Id. at 437. It would follow, in the instant case, the PDA does not require\nUnion Pacific to provide coverage for prescription contraception specifically to\nprevent pregnancy unless the employer provides comparable coverage to male\nemployees.\n\n      What is comparable coverage? The district court determined the proper\ncomparison is between prescription contraception coverage and other preventative\ncoverage. In contrast, the Court concludes the proper comparison is between coverage\n\n                                         -21-\n\ffor female contraception (prescription contraception) and male contraception\n(condoms and vasectomies). As noted above, I agree with the district court about\ncontraception being a gender-specific, female issue because of the adverse health\nconsequences of an unplanned pregnancy (or even the general health consequences\nof any pregnancy). As such, I agree the proper comparison is between the\npreventative health coverage provided to each gender.\n\n        The history of the PDA supports the district court’s choice of comparators. The\nPDA was enacted specifically to overrule the reasoning employed by the majority in\nGeneral Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976), and to adopt the reasoning of the\nGilbert dissenters. See Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462\nU.S. 669, 678-79 & n.17 (1983) (noting the legislative history of the PDA\ndemonstrates Congress viewed the Gilbert dissenters as expressing the true principle\nand meaning of Title VII when they explained it was facially discriminatory for an\nemployer to offer protection against all risks but for pregnancy and “the appropriate\nclassification was ‘between persons who face a risk of pregnancy and those who do\nnot.’”). In Gilbert, the Court refused to require employers to cover pregnancy in their\nshort-term disability plans, noting that without the pregnancy coverage, plans for men\nand women were equal and covered the same risks. Gilbert, 429 U.S. at 138-40. In\nhis dissent, Justice Stevens argued this was discriminatory because the employer\ntreated absenteeism based on pregnancy differently than all other types of\nabsenteeism. Id. at 161 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Likewise, Justice Brennan explained\nit was discriminatory for a company to devise “a policy that, but for pregnancy, offers\nprotection for all risks, even those that are ‘unique to’ men or heavily male\ndominated.” Id. at 160. (Brennan, J., dissenting). Put another way, the Gilbert\ndissenters recognized, to be equal, a plan would have to cover for the uniquely female\nrisk of pregnancy, although this required giving women additional benefits men would\nnot receive. Under this reasoning, as prescription contraception is a treatment for (or\na method to control the occurrence and timing of) the uniquely female condition of\npotential pregnancy, the exclusion of this coverage in a plan providing other\n\n                                         -22-\n\fpreventative coverage is discriminatory. Union Pacific provides coverage for a wide\nrange of preventative medicines and procedures, including coverage for prescription\ndrugs used exclusively by males to prevent benign prostatic hypertrophy. Union\nPacific specifically excludes coverage for prescription contraception when used for\na preventative purpose. Under the reasoning of the Gilbert dissenters, as adopted by\nCongress with the PDA, this is discriminatory.\n\n       Women are uniquely and specifically disadvantaged by Union Pacific’s failure\nto cover prescription contraception. Because I believe such a policy is violative of\nTitle VII, as amended by the PDA, I respectfully dissent. Although the district court’s\ndecision might appear to grant women benefits above and beyond those of men, the\nPDA requires such benefits be included in an otherwise comprehensive health care\nplan.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\f",

The\ndistrict court granted Standridge and Phillips’s motion for partial summary judgment\non July 15, 2005, and entered final judgment in their favor on February 10, 2006.\nUnion Pacific appeals. For the reasons discussed below, we reverse.\n\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n\n       Union Pacific, a freight company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, provides\nhealth care benefits to those of its employees who are covered by collective bargaining\nagreements (“agreement employees”). These agreement employees receive benefits\nthrough one of five plans. While the plans provide benefits for services such as\nroutine physical exams, tetanus shots and drug and alcohol treatments, they exclude\ncoverage of allergy serum, immunization agents, biological sera and drugs that treat\ninfertility. They also exclude both male and female contraceptive methods,\nprescription and non-prescription, when used for the sole purpose of contraception.\nUnion Pacific only covers contraception when medically necessary for a non-\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fcontraceptive purpose such as regulating menstrual cycles, treating skin problems or\navoiding serious health risks associated with pregnancy.\n\n\n       Standridge and Phillips are two of the approximately 1,500 female agreement\nemployees of child-bearing age employed by Union Pacific during the time period\nrelevant to this litigation. Standridge and Phillips used prescription contraception for\ncontraceptive purposes, and the plans did not cover the costs of their contraception.\nThey, along with two other female employees, brought individual suits against Union\nPacific alleging that Union Pacific discriminated against its female employees by not\nproviding coverage of prescription contraception in violation of Title VII, as amended\nby the PDA. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the four\nsimilar actions against Union Pacific and transferred the consolidated action to the\nDistrict of Nebraska. The district court granted class certification, named Standridge\nand Phillips as class representatives, and certified the class as “[a]ll females employed\nby Union Pacific Railroad Company after February 9, 2001, enrolled in one of the\nAgreement Plans who used prescription contraception, at least in part for the purpose\nof preventing pregnancy, without insurance reimbursement from said Plan.”\n\n\n        The district court granted Standridge and Phillips’s motion for partial summary\njudgment, finding that Union Pacific’s failure to cover prescription contraception\nconstitutes a violation of Title VII, as amended by the PDA. In holding that the\ncoverage was discriminatory against women, the district court cited the language of\nthe PDA, the purpose of its enactment, the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission’s (“EEOC”) interpretation of the PDA’s application to prescription\ncontraception and reasoning from other district court decisions. The district court\nrejected Standridge and Phillips’s argument that unplanned pregnancies have a\nnegative social impact. It also rejected Union Pacific’s arguments that a requirement\nto cover prescription contraception would have a large financial impact; that the denial\nof all contraception results in equal treatment of men and women; that contraception\n\n                                          -4-\n\fdeals with fertility and is not a medical condition “related to” pregnancy; that Union\nPacific’s covered benefits are treatment-related, not preventive; and that there is no\nmedical necessity for contraception with respect to fertility because pregnancy is a\nnormal human condition. The district court held that Union Pacific violated Title VII,\nas amended by the PDA, because “it treats medical care women need to prevent\npregnancy less favorably than it treats medical care needed to prevent other medical\nconditions that are no greater threat to employees’ health than is pregnancy.” In re\nUnion Pac.

After a stipulation by the parties regarding attorneys’ fees, the district court\nentered final judgment in favor of Standridge and Phillips, staying enforcement\npending Union Pacific’s appeal.\n\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n\n       Union Pacific argues that the PDA does not require contraception to be included\nin its health care coverage and that its health care coverage does not discriminate\nagainst women in violation of Title VII. We review de novo the district court’s grant\nof summary judgment, viewing all of the evidence “in the light most favorable to the\nnonmoving party.” Gilooly v. Mo.

We apply the same standard as the\ndistrict court, and we also review de novo the district court’s interpretation of statutes.\nFitzgerald v. Camdenton R-III Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793496\"><a href=\"/opinion/793496/ron-fitzgerald-on-his-own-behalf-and-as-next-friend-of-sf-a-minor-child/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 775 (8th Cir. 2006).\n\n\n      A.      PDA Analysis\n\n\n      As an initial matter, the district court incorrectly characterized Union Pacific’s\npolicy as the denial of prescription contraception coverage for women. Union Pacific\nexcludes all types of contraception, whether prescription, non-prescription or surgical\n\n                                           -5-\n\fand whether for men or women, unless an employee has a non-contraception medical\nnecessity for the contraception. While prescription contraception is currently only\navailable for women, non-prescription contraception is available for men and women.\nTherefore, the issue is whether Union Pacific’s policy of denying coverage for all\ncontraception violates Title VII, as amended by the PDA.\n\n\n      Union Pacific argues that the district court erred in holding that the PDA\nrequires coverage of contraception. It contends that the PDA only relates to\ndiscrimination against a woman for medical conditions that occur (or may occur) after\nshe becomes pregnant, while the use of contraception only relates to human fertility\nbefore pregnancy. Standridge and Phillips argue that contraception is covered by the\nPDA because it is “related to” the condition of pregnancy.\n\n\n       Title VII provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\nemployer . . . to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . . sex.”\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Congress created the PDA to amend this provision in\nresponse to the Supreme Court’s holding that the exclusion of pregnancy benefits did\nnot violate Title VII. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109565\"><a href=\"/opinion/109565/general-elec-co-v-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145-46 (1976). The\nPDA provides:\n\n\n       The terms “because of sex” or “on the basis of sex” include, but are not\n       limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related\n       medical conditions; and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or\n       related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-\n       related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit\n       programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or\n       inability to work . . . . This subsection shall not require an employer to\n       pay for health insurance benefits for abortion, except where the life of\n       the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f          except where medical complications have arisen from an abortion.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k).\n\n\n     Neither the circuit courts nor the Supreme Court has considered whether the\nPDA applies to contraception.1 The Supreme Court, though, has discussed the scope\n\n      1\n        District court decisions are split as to whether the PDA requires companies to\nprovide coverage of contraception. In Stocking v. AT&T Corp., the district court\ninitially expressed skepticism about the proposition but ultimately held that the PDA\nrequires coverage. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2441943\"><a href=\"/opinion/2441943/stocking-v-at-t-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Aug. 23,\n2002). In Erickson v. Bartell Drug Co., the district court held that a company’s\nexclusion of prescription contraceptive benefits was discriminatory under Title VII,\nas amended by the PDA, because Congress’ response to Gilbert required employers\nto provide women-only benefits and only women used prescription contraceptives.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2472544\"><a href=\"/opinion/2472544/erickson-v-bartell-drug-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Wash. 2001).\n\n       Other district courts, though, have concluded that the exclusion of contraception\nfrom coverage is not a violation of the PDA. In Cummins v. Illinois, the district court\nheld that the exclusion of contraception was not a violation of the PDA. No. 02-4201\n(S.D. Ill. Aug. 30, 2005). It disagreed with the argument that the exclusion of\ncontraception coverage only affected the health of a woman and held that both men\nand women have active roles in contraception and are affected by the exclusion of\ncontraception coverage. Id., slip op. at 16. In Alexander v. American Airlines, Inc.,\nthe district court dismissed the case on standing grounds, saying also that “[b]y no\nstretch of the imagination does the prohibition against discrimination based on\n‘pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition[s]’ require the provision of\ncontraceptives as part of the treatment for infertility. Moreover, the plan does not\ncover provision of contraceptives to anyone, male or female.” No. 02-252, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">731815</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (N.D.

In its opinion, the Court acknowledged that the enactment of the\nPDA overturned its Gilbert decision. Id. at 676. The Court further analyzed the PDA\nin Johnson Controls in the context of a bona fide occupational qualification defense.\nJohnson Controls would not allow a woman who had the potential to become pregnant\nto work in jobs with actual or potential lead exposure because of the associated fetal\nhealth risks. Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at 191. The Court held that an employer\ncould not prevent a woman from working in those positions when it did not also\nprevent men from working in those positions, “unless her reproductive potential\nprevent[ed] her from performing the duties of her job.” Id. at 206. Since reproductive\npotential did not prevent women from performing the duties of the positions in\nquestion, the Court held that discriminating against women on the basis of potential\npregnancy was a violation of Title VII, as amended by the PDA.

We concluded that the phrase “related medical conditions” in\nthe PDA refers only to medical conditions associated with “pregnancy” and\n“childbirth,” the specific terms that precede the general phrase. Id. (quoting Norfolk\n& W. Ry. Co. v. Am. Train Dispatchers Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112560\"><a href=\"/opinion/112560/norfolk-western-r-co-v-train-dispatchers/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129 (1991), for the\nprinciple that “when a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be\nunderstood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration”).\nInfertility is “strikingly different” from pregnancy and childbirth because infertility\nprevents conception, while pregnancy, childbirth and medical conditions related to\nthem can occur only after conception. Id. Therefore, Krauel holds that infertility is\n“outside of the PDA’s protection because it is not pregnancy, childbirth, or a related\nmedical condition.” Id. at 679-80.\n\n\n       In concluding that the PDA does not extend to infertility, we also distinguished\nthe Supreme Court’s holding in Johnson Controls. While noting that the PDA does\ncover differential treatment of an employee based on health concerns that may arise\nduring her pregnancy, we held that Johnson Controls does not support an expansion\nof the PDA to cover fertility matters prior to conception because “[p]otential\npregnancy, unlike infertility, is a medical condition that is sex-related because only\nwomen can become pregnant . . . . [B]ecause the policy of denying insurance benefits\nfor treatment of fertility problems applies to both female and male workers . . . [it] is\ngender-neutral . . . .” Id. at 680.\n\n\n        With the guidance of these decisions, we now determine whether contraception\nis “related to” pregnancy for PDA purposes. While contraception may certainly affect\nthe causal chain that leads to pregnancy, we have specifically rejected the argument\nthat a causal connection, by itself, results in a medical condition being “related to”\npregnancy for PDA purposes. Id. at 679 (rejecting the argument that “infertility is\nrelated to pregnancy because there is a causal connection between such a condition\nand pregnancy”). Union Pacific argues that contraception, analogous to infertility, is\n\n                                          -9-\n\fgender-neutral. Standridge and Phillips argue that the district court correctly found\nthat contraception implicates potential pregnancy and that the PDA covers\ncontraception because it prevents a gender-specific condition.\n\n\n      Following Krauel, we hold that contraception is not “related to” pregnancy for\nPDA purposes because, like infertility treatments, contraception is a treatment that is\nonly indicated prior to pregnancy. Contraception is not a medical treatment that\noccurs when or if a woman becomes pregnant; instead, contraception prevents\npregnancy from even occurring. See Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 271\n(11th ed. 2005) (defining contraception as the “deliberate prevention of conception\nor impregnation”). As in Krauel, the result in Johnson Controls does not require\ncoverage of contraception because contraception is not a gender-specific term like\n“potential pregnancy,” but rather applies to both men and women like “infertility.”\nIn conclusion, the PDA does not require coverage of contraception because\ncontraception is not “related to” pregnancy for PDA purposes and is gender-neutral.2\n\n\n       We are not persuaded by the contention of Standridge and Phillips and the\namici members of Congress that Congress intended to address the coverage of\nprescription contraception in the PDA. In their views, the PDA was a “broad\nresponse” to the Gilbert decision, and Congress wanted to protect women in all areas\nconcerning pregnancy, including the prevention of it.

This EEOC decision\nis similar to a policy statement or enforcement guideline,4 and we respect such\ninterpretations “only to the extent that those interpretations have the ‘power to\npersuade.’” Christensen, 529 U.S. at 587 (quoting Skidmore v.

Since Congress did not give the EEOC rule-making authority, the\namount of deference we give to this decision “will depend upon the thoroughness\nevident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier\nand later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if\nlacking power to control.” Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. at 257 (internal quotation\nomitted).\n\n\n      We find the EEOC decision to be unpersuasive. The decision addressed a\npolicy that denied coverage of prescription contraception but included coverage of the\nsurgical contraceptive methods of vasectomies and tubal ligations. Union Pacific’s\ncoverage is different because it excludes coverage of all contraception for women and\nmen, both prescription and surgical. Additionally, the decision compares prescription\ncontraception to the broadest possible spectrum of other preventive treatments and\n\n\n      4\n      The decision’s opening paragraph identifies it is “a formal statement of\nCommission policy as applied to the facts at issue in these charges.” EEOC\nCommission Decision on Coverage of Contraception (Dec. 14, 2000) (emphasis\nadded).\n\n                                          -12-\n\fservices without citing a persuasive basis for doing so. Furthermore, the EEOC did\nnot issue any guidance on the issue of coverage of prescription contraception until 22\nyears after the enactment of the PDA. The delay brings into question the consistency\nand persuasiveness of the EEOC’s position. Therefore, we find this decision\nunpersuasive on the question before us.\n\n\n       In conclusion, based on the language of the PDA and our previous holding in\nKrauel, we hold that the PDA does not encompass contraception. Contraception, like\ninfertility treatments, is a treatment that is only indicated prior to pregnancy because\ncontraception actually prevents pregnancy from occurring. Furthermore, like\ninfertility, contraception is a gender-neutral term. Therefore, Union Pacific’s denial\nof coverage for contraception for both sexes did not discriminate against its female\nagreement employees in violation of Title VII, as amended by the PDA.\n\n\n      B.     Title VII Analysis\n\n\n        Along with its argument that the PDA does not require coverage of\ncontraception, Union Pacific argues that its exclusion of contraception coverage does\nnot discriminate against its female agreement employees under a general Title VII\nanalysis. Title VII prevents an employer from making employment decisions that are\nbased on an employee’s gender. See Kratzer v. Rockwell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789331\"><a href=\"/opinion/789331/nancy-m-kratzer-v-rockwell-collins-inc-david-a-bellendier-and-eugene/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1046 (8th\nCir. 2005). However, when an employer’s action is not based on a sex classification,\nit is not a sex-based violation of Title VII. See Piantanida v.

To establish this disparate treatment claim, Standridge and Phillips\nmust show, in part, that “other employees outside of the protected group were\n\n                                         -13-\n\fallegedly treated more favorably and were similarly situated in all relevant respects.”\nGilooly, 421 F.3d at 739 (internal quotation omitted).

The district\ncourt compared the “medicines or medical services [that] prevent employees from\ndeveloping diseases or conditions that pose an equal or lesser threat to employees’\nhealth than does pregnancy.” Union Pacific, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2313236\"><a href=\"/opinion/2313236/in-re-union-pacific-rr-employment-practices-lit/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

It found that\nthe health plans treated men more favorably because the plans covered preventive\nmedicines and services such as medication for male-pattern baldness, routine physical\nexams, tetanus shots, and drug and alcohol treatments. Union Pacific argues that the\ndistrict court’s comparator was too broad because it treated pregnancy as a disease that\nneeded to be prevented instead of focusing on the narrow issue of contraception.\n\n\n      We decline to address whether pregnancy is a “disease.” Instead, we simply\nhold that the district court erred in using the comparator “medicines or medical\nservices [that] prevent employees from developing diseases or conditions that pose an\nequal or lesser threat to employees’ health than does pregnancy.”5 As previously\n\n\n      5\n       Even if we adopted the district court’s characterization that contraception\nprevents a “disease” only suffered by women, it is not clear Union Pacific’s exclusion\nof contraception coverage would be a violation of Title VII under the Newport News\nanalysis. In Newport News, the Supreme Court held that a policy violated Title VII,\nas amended by the PDA, because the female employees received better pregnancy\nbenefits than the female spouses of the male employees. Newport News, 462 U.S. at\n\n                                         -14-\n\fdiscussed, this case concerns Union Pacific’s coverage of contraception for men and\nwomen. The proper comparator is the provision of the medical benefit in question,\ncontraception. Union Pacific’s health plans do not cover any contraception used by\nwomen such as birth control, sponges, diaphragms, intrauterine devices or tubal\nligations or any contraception used by men such as condoms and vasectomies.\nTherefore, the coverage provided to women is not less favorable than that provided\nto men. Thus, there is no violation of Title VII.\n\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n\n       Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s judgment and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\nBYE, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n      The Court holds Union Pacific’s exclusion of prescription contraception\ncoverage does not violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e\n- 2000e-17 (Title VII ), as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978\n(PDA). Because I agree with how the district court framed the discrimination inquiry,\nand therefore agree with its conclusion that Union Pacific’s policy discriminates\nagainst women under Title VII, as amended by the PDA, I respectfully dissent.\n\n       The Court ends with the following pronouncement in footnote five: “Union\nPacific provides an equal policy for its female and male employees.” Ante at 15. This\n\n\n\n\n684. In this case, however, the female spouses of the male employees receive the\nsame benefits as the female employees. Therefore, Newport News suggests that Union\nPacific provides an equal policy for its female and male employees.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fis a good place to begin. When one looks at the medical effect6 of Union Pacific’s\nfailure to provide insurance coverage for prescription contraception, the inequality of\ncoverage is clear. This failure only medically affects females, as they bear all of the\nhealth consequences of unplanned pregnancies. An insurance policy providing\ncomprehensive coverage for preventative medical care, including coverage for\npreventative prescription drugs used exclusively by males, but fails to cover\nprescription contraception used exclusively by females, can hardly be called equal.\nIt just isn't so.\n\n       The Court begins its analysis by finding the district court erred in confining its\ninquiry to Union Pacific’s exclusion of coverage for prescription contraception used\nby women because its policy also excludes coverage for non-prescription\ncontraception coverage (condoms) and surgical procedures to prevent male fertility\n(vasectomies). The district court did not err in limiting its inquiry to prescription\ncontraception. That its policy does not provide coverage for condoms is\nunsurprising—Union Pacific has not identified any health insurance policy which\nwould provide coverage for non-prescription, contraceptive devices available in drug\nstores and gas stations nationwide. As for vasectomies, even if we were to look at its\nexclusion of coverage for vasectomies, the policy nonetheless discriminates against\nfemales. When a policy excludes coverage for vasectomies, the medical effect of this\nexclusion is born entirely by women, as the record demonstrates women are the only\ngender which can become pregnant.\n\n      The Court holds Union Pacific’s failure to cover prescription contraception is\nnot covered by the PDA because prescription contraception use occurs prior to\npregnancy. Because such reasoning is at odds with the Supreme Court’s construction\n\n      6\n        The logical focus here is on the medical effect of Union Pacific’s failure to\ncover prescription contraception. This case is about health insurance coverage and\ndetermining whether such coverage discriminates against women. There is no reason\nto stray from the bounds of a health paradigm when making this determination.\n\n                                          -16-\n\fof the PDA, I respectfully disagree.

Title VII provides in relevant part:\n\n      It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer--(1) . . . to\n      discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,\n      terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n      individual’s . . . sex . . . ; or (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\n      employees . . . in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n      individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his\n      status as an employee, because of such individual’s . . . sex . . ..\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). Congress enacted the PDA to amend the definition of sex in\nTitle VII. As such, the PDA provides in relevant part:\n\n      The terms “because of sex” or “on the basis of sex” include, but are not\n      limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related\n      medical conditions; and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or\n      related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all\n      employment-related purposes . . ..\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k).\n\n       While the plain language of the PDA does not specifically include pre-\npregnancy conditions, there is some indication Congress intended the act to cover pre-\npregnancy discrimination. Congress used the phrase “related medical conditions.”\nThe word “related” indicates the PDA covers more than mere pregnancy. In this case,\nthe district court relied on the second clause of the PDA which is drafted even more\nbroadly than the first, covering “women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related\nmedical conditions.” In re Union Pac.

Finally, as noted by certain members of Congress, writing as\namici on behalf of Standridge and Phillips, the first clause of the PDA specifically\nstates: “The terms ‘because of sex’ or ‘on the basis of sex’ include, but are not limited\nto, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.”\nBrief for Certain Members of the Congress as Amicus Curiae 4.

In Krauel, we held\nan insurance policy excluding coverage for infertility treatments did not violate the\nPDA, as treatment for infertility is not treatment of a medical condition related to\npregnancy or childbirth. Because “[p]regnancy and childbirth, which occur after\nconception, are strikingly different from infertility, which prevents conception,” we\nheld “the District Court properly concluded that infertility is outside of the PDA’s\nprotection because it is not pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.” Id.\nWe explicitly acknowledged however, under Johnson Controls, “[p]otential\npregnancy, unlike infertility, is a medical condition that is sex-related because only\nwomen can become pregnant.” Id. at 680. Because infertility, unlike potential\npregnancy, is gender-neutral, it could not form the basis of a PDA claim. Id.\n\n       Krauel undoubtedly limited the scope of the PDA. The Court suggests Krauel\ndrew the line at pregnancy, and held the PDA does not apply to infertility treatments\nbecause infertility, by its definition, occurs prior to pregnancy. In my assessment,\nKrauel cannot draw such a bright line because of Johnson Controls. This court has,\nafter Krauel, at least implicitly indicated it will not draw the line of PDA coverage at\npregnancy. See Walsh v.

The reason Krauel\ndetermined the PDA did not apply to an employer’s failure to cover infertility\ntreatments, even in light of Johnson Controls, was because infertility, unlike potential\npregnancy, is a gender-neutral affliction. After Krauel, denial of coverage for\ninfertility treatments does not implicate the PDA because infertility affects both men\nand women. The Court suggests infertility treatments and contraception are both pre-\npregnancy and this fact makes the difference. Although both are used prior to\nconception, when one looks at the medical effect of the denial of insurance coverage,\nprescription contraception is easily distinguishable from infertility treatments. As the\ndistrict court aptly notes: “Health plans that deny coverage for contraception, by\ndefinition, affect only the health of women.” In re Union Pac., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2313236\"><a href=\"/opinion/2313236/in-re-union-pacific-rr-employment-practices-lit/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

With prescription contraception a woman controls her potential pregnancy.\nSuch contraception is necessarily gender-related because it prevents pregnancy only\nin women. Without contraception, a sexually active, fertile woman is almost certain\nto become pregnant.7 Once pregnant, only the woman’s health is affected. Infertility,\nby contrast, is a word used to describe a number of medical conditions affecting both\nmen and women. When a man or a woman is infertile, he or she is unable to\ncontribute to reproduction as his or her reproductive organs do not function properly.\nInfertility treatments may correct the medical condition of infertility in both men and\nwomen, allowing them to effectively make the necessary contribution to reproduction.\nThus, prescription contraception and infertility treatments are like apples and oranges.\nAlthough both relate to pregnancy in a general sense, prescription contraception is,\n\n      7\n       As Standridge and Phillips note, without contraception, a woman is likely to\nbecome pregnant twelve to fifteen times over the course of her reproductive life, and,\nin any given year, 85 out of 100 sexually active women of childbearing age will\nbecome pregnant.\n\n                                           -20-\n\funlike fertility treatments, at its very core gender-specific. As such, a PDA claim\nbased on a failure to provide prescription contraception coverage is not foreclosed by\nKrauel. More importantly, the Court’s holding here—“that contraception is not\n‘related to’ pregnancy for PDA purposes because, like infertility treatments,\ncontraception is a treatment that is only indicated prior to pregnancy,” ante at 10,—is\ninconsistent with Johnson Controls.\n\n        In addition to holding the PDA does not apply under Krauel, the Court also\nholds Union Pacific’s policy does not discriminate against women under Title VII,\nbecause the policy excludes contraception coverage for both men and women.\nBecause I agree with the district court’s comparison—between the insurance coverage\nprovided to men and woman for all types of preventative medicine—I also dissent\nwith regard to this holding. Whether something constitutes discrimination under Title\nVII, as amended by the PDA, is a matter of comparison. “The PDA does not create\nsubstantive rights to preferential treatment.” Deneen v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749827\"><a href=\"/opinion/749827/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-397-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45108-ruth-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436 (8th Cir. 1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This\ncourt has noted quite the contrary: “[T]he PDA allows employers [to] treat pregnant\nwomen as badly as they treat similarly affected but nonpregnant employees. The\nopposite, however, is also true–employers must treat pregnant women as well as they\ntreat similarly affected employees.” Id. at 436-37 (internal citations omitted). “The\nPDA does not require an employer to overlook the work restrictions of pregnant\nwomen unless the employer overlooks the comparable work restrictions of other\nemployees.” Id. at 437. It would follow, in the instant case, the PDA does not require\nUnion Pacific to provide coverage for prescription contraception specifically to\nprevent pregnancy unless the employer provides comparable coverage to male\nemployees.\n\n      What is comparable coverage? The district court determined the proper\ncomparison is between prescription contraception coverage and other preventative\ncoverage. In contrast, the Court concludes the proper comparison is between coverage\n\n                                         -21-\n\ffor female contraception (prescription contraception) and male contraception\n(condoms and vasectomies). As noted above, I agree with the district court about\ncontraception being a gender-specific, female issue because of the adverse health\nconsequences of an unplanned pregnancy (or even the general health consequences\nof any pregnancy). As such, I agree the proper comparison is between the\npreventative health coverage provided to each gender.\n\n        The history of the PDA supports the district court’s choice of comparators. The\nPDA was enacted specifically to overrule the reasoning employed by the majority in\nGeneral Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109565\"><a href=\"/opinion/109565/general-elec-co-v-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), and to adopt the reasoning of the\nGilbert dissenters. See Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110978\"><a href=\"/opinion/110978/newport-news-shipbuilding-dry-dock-co-v-eeoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678-79 & n.17 (1983) (noting the legislative history of the PDA\ndemonstrates Congress viewed the Gilbert dissenters as expressing the true principle\nand meaning of Title VII when they explained it was facially discriminatory for an\nemployer to offer protection against all risks but for pregnancy and “the appropriate\nclassification was ‘between persons who face a risk of pregnancy and those who do\nnot.’”). In Gilbert, the Court refused to require employers to cover pregnancy in their\nshort-term disability plans, noting that without the pregnancy coverage, plans for men\nand women were equal and covered the same risks. Gilbert, 429 U.S. at 138-40. In\nhis dissent, Justice Stevens argued this was discriminatory because the employer\ntreated absenteeism based on pregnancy differently than all other types of\nabsenteeism. Id. at 161 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Likewise, Justice Brennan explained\nit was discriminatory for a company to devise “a policy that, but for pregnancy, offers\nprotection for all risks, even those that are ‘unique to’ men or heavily male\ndominated.” Id. at 160. (Brennan, J., dissenting). Put another way, the Gilbert\ndissenters recognized, to be equal, a plan would have to cover for the uniquely female\nrisk of pregnancy, although this required giving women additional benefits men would\nnot receive. Under this reasoning, as prescription contraception is a treatment for (or\na method to control the occurrence and timing of) the uniquely female condition of\npotential pregnancy, the exclusion of this coverage in a plan providing other\n\n                                         -22-\n\fpreventative coverage is discriminatory. Union Pacific provides coverage for a wide\nrange of preventative medicines and procedures, including coverage for prescription\ndrugs used exclusively by males to prevent benign prostatic hypertrophy. Union\nPacific specifically excludes coverage for prescription contraception when used for\na preventative purpose. Under the reasoning of the Gilbert dissenters, as adopted by\nCongress with the PDA, this is discriminatory.\n\n       Women are uniquely and specifically disadvantaged by Union Pacific’s failure\nto cover prescription contraception. Because I believe such a policy is violative of\nTitle VII, as amended by the PDA, I respectfully dissent. Although the district court’s\ndecision might appear to grant women benefits above and beyond those of men, the\nPDA requires such benefits be included in an otherwise comprehensive health care\nplan.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\f</pre>",
