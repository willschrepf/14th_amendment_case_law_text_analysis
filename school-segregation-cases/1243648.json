Because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, we will\n\nsummarily affirm the order of the District Court. See 3d Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P 10.6.\n\fI.     Background\n\n       In June 2010, while Ryan was incarcerated at FCI Fort Dix, Ryan was found in\n\npossession, among other things, of a cellular phone. A prison incident report was\n\nsubsequently issued, and Ryan was charged with possession of a hazardous tool, a tool\n\n“likely to be used in an escape or escape attempt, . . . or hazardous to institutional\n\nsecurity,” in violation of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Prohibited Acts Code\n\n(“PAC”) 108. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.13 tbl. 3 (2010).1 A disciplinary hearing was held.\n\nBased on the incident report, the disciplinary hearing officer (“DHO”) found Ryan guilty\n\nand imposed sanctions that consisted of the disallowance of 40 days of good conduct\n\ntime, forfeiture of 432 days of non-vested good conduct time, 60 days of disciplinary\n\nsegregation, and loss of phone privileges for 18 months.\n\n       In September 2010, Ryan filed in the District Court a habeas petition pursuant to\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2241, alleging that his constitutional rights were violated which resulted in\n\nthe loss of good conduct time. Ryan claimed that his right to due process was violated\n\nbecause BOP failed to provide him with notice that the punishment for possession of a\n\ncellular phone had been increased from a moderate disciplinary severity level to a\n\ngreatest disciplinary severity level violation and that PAC 108 is void for vagueness. He\n\nalso claimed that his right to equal protection was violated. Ryan noted that he had yet to\n\nexhaust all administrative remedies available, but stated that documents related to the\n\n\n       1\n       The current version of PAC 108 includes a portable telephone as an example of a\nhazardous tool. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.3 tbl. 1 (2011).\n                                            2\n\fincident were unavailable to him and that he was in transit during the DHO appeal time\n\nperiod. The District Court dismissed Ryan’s petition for failure to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies, and in the alternative, as meritless. Ryan timely appealed.\n\nII.    Jurisdiction\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Ryan properly brought his\n\nchallenge to the loss of good conduct time under § 2241, see Queen v. Miner, 530 F.3d\n\n253, 254 n.2 (3d Cir. 2008), and he need not obtain a certificate of appealability to\n\nproceed with this appeal, see United States v. Cepero, 224 F.3d 256, 264-65 (3d Cir.\n\n2000) (en banc). We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s legal conclusions\n\nand apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. Vega v. United States, 493\n\nF.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir. 2007). We may affirm the District Court for any reason supported\n\nby the record. United States v. Agnew, 407 F.3d 193, 196 (3d Cir. 2005).\n\nIII.   Discussion\n\n       In dismissing Ryan’s habeas petition, it appears that the District Court analyzed\n\nhis claims as a challenge to the procedures of his disciplinary proceedings. This analysis,\n\nhowever, was a misinterpretation of Ryan’s due process claims. Additionally, the\n\nDistrict Court failed to address Ryan’s equal protection claim. Nevertheless, we affirm\n\nthe District Court’s judgment because the claims raised in Ryan’s habeas petition lack\n\nmerit.2 See id.\n\n\n       2\n        We need not address the exhaustion issue, as we have determined that Ryan’s\nclaims lack merit.\n                                          3\n\f       A.     Due Process Claims\n\n       Ryan argued that his right to due process was violated because he did not receive\n\nnotice that the penalty for possession of a cellular phone increased from a moderate\n\ndisciplinary severity level violation under PAC 3053 to a greatest disciplinary severity\n\nlevel violation under PAC 108. Ryan noted that a proposal to amend PAC 108 to list\n\npossession of a cellular phone as a prohibited act under PAC 108 was not adopted. Thus,\n\nhe asserted that BOP’s charging him under PAC 108 for possession of a cellular phone\n\nwas invalid because the penalty increase was not completed through the Administrative\n\nProcedures Act (“APA”), and therefore, he did not receive notice of the penalty increase.\n\n       This claim lacks merit. The APA requires that general notice of the proposed\n\nregulation be published in the Federal Register and that interested persons be given an\n\nopportunity to comment on the proposed regulation. 5 U.S.C. § 553; Chao v. Rothermel,\n\n327 F.3d 223, 227 (3d Cir. 2003). The APA applies only to legislative rules, rules that\n\nimpose new duties upon the regulated party. See Chao, 327 F.3d at 227. PAC 108,\n\nhowever, is an interpretive rule, and therefore the APA does not apply. See id. (If the\n\nagency is not adding or amending language to the regulation, the rule is interpretive).\n\nBOP acted within its authority in interpreting PAC 108, and Ryan has not shown that\n\nBOP’s interpretation that the possession of cellular phone is a prohibited act under PAC\n\n\n\n       3\n         PAC 305 prohibits the “[p]ossession of anything not authorized for retention or\nreceipt by the inmate, and not issued to him through regular channels.” 28 C.F.R. §\n541.13 tbl. 3 (2010).\n                                             4\n\f108 is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. See Chong v. Dist. Dir.,\n\nImmigration & Naturalization Serv., 264 F.3d 378, 389 (3d Cir. 2001) (“An agency’s\n\ninterpretation of its own regulation is controlling . . . unless it is plainly erroneous or\n\ninconsistent with the regulation.”).\n\n       Ryan also argued that his right to due process was violated because PAC 108 is\n\nvoid for vagueness. A regulation is void for vagueness if it (1) “fails to provide people of\n\nordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits,”\n\nor (2) “authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Hill v.\n\nColorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000). We are not persuaded that PAC 108 is\n\nunconstitutionally vague. One can readily infer from the language of PAC 108 that a\n\ncellular phone would be among those tools hazardous to institutional security and likely\n\nto be used in an escape or escape attempt. Accordingly, Ryan’s void for vagueness claim\n\nlacks merit.\n\n               B.     Equal Protection Claim\n\n       Ryan argued that he had been treated differently from other inmates similarly\n\nsituated in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. He claimed that BOP arbitrarily\n\ncharged inmates for the possession of a cellular phone under different disciplinary\n\nseverity levels. For example, Ryan alleged that BOP downgraded the charges of inmates\n\nNeagle and Hudson for the possession of a cellular phone, from a greatest disciplinary\n\nseverity level violation under PAC 108 to a moderate disciplinary severity level violation\n\nunder PAC 305.\n                                               5\n\f       The Equal Protection Clause requires that all people similarly situated be treated\n\nalike. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). A\n\nclaimant alleging a violation of the right to equal protection has the burden to prove “the\n\nexistence of purposeful discrimination.” McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 292 (1987).\n\nThis requires that Ryan prove that he received different treatment from that received by\n\nother individuals similarly situated and that BOP acted with discriminatory purpose. Id.;\n\nChambers ex rel. Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of Phila. Bd. of Educ., 587 F.3d 176, 196 (3d\n\nCir. 2009). Although Ryan alleged that inmates Hudson and Neagle received a lesser\n\nsanction than he for the same prohibited act, he failed to offer evidence that Hudson and\n\nNeagle were similarly situated to him.4 Moreover, Ryan was sanctioned in conformity\n\nwith the regulation. Accordingly, his equal protection claim fails.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         In his opposition to summary action, Ryan explains that Hudson and Neagle are\nalso inmates at Fort Dix. He alleges that he was treated differently because Hudson and\nNeagle are Caucasian and he is African-American. These sparse and conclusory\nallegations, however, still fail to establish the purposeful discrimination necessary to\nmake out an equal protection claim.\n\n                                             6\n\f",

A regulation is void for vagueness if it (1) “fails to provide people of\n\nordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits,”\n\nor (2) “authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Hill v.\n\nColorado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732 (2000). We are not persuaded that PAC 108 is\n\nunconstitutionally vague. One can readily infer from the language of PAC 108 that a\n\ncellular phone would be among those tools hazardous to institutional security and likely\n\nto be used in an escape or escape attempt. Accordingly, Ryan’s void for vagueness claim\n\nlacks merit.\n\n               B.     Equal Protection Claim\n\n       Ryan argued that he had been treated differently from other inmates similarly\n\nsituated in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. He claimed that BOP arbitrarily\n\ncharged inmates for the possession of a cellular phone under different disciplinary\n\nseverity levels. For example, Ryan alleged that BOP downgraded the charges of inmates\n\nNeagle and Hudson for the possession of a cellular phone, from a greatest disciplinary\n\nseverity level violation under PAC 108 to a moderate disciplinary severity level violation\n\nunder PAC 305.\n                                               5\n\f       The Equal Protection Clause requires that all people similarly situated be treated\n\nalike. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439 (1985). A\n\nclaimant alleging a violation of the right to equal protection has the burden to prove “the\n\nexistence of purposeful discrimination.” McCleskey v. Kemp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111869\"><a href=\"/opinion/111869/mccleskey-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 292 (1987).\n\nThis requires that Ryan prove that he received different treatment from that received by\n\nother individuals similarly situated and that BOP acted with discriminatory purpose. Id.;\n\nChambers ex rel. Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of Phila. Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1345549\"><a href=\"/opinion/1345549/chambers-v-school-dist-philadelphia-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196 (3d\n\nCir. 2009). Although Ryan alleged that inmates Hudson and Neagle received a lesser\n\nsanction than he for the same prohibited act, he failed to offer evidence that Hudson and\n\nNeagle were similarly situated to him.4 Moreover, Ryan was sanctioned in conformity\n\nwith the regulation. Accordingly, his equal protection claim fails.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         In his opposition to summary action, Ryan explains that Hudson and Neagle are\nalso inmates at Fort Dix. He alleges that he was treated differently because Hudson and\nNeagle are Caucasian and he is African-American. These sparse and conclusory\nallegations, however, still fail to establish the purposeful discrimination necessary to\nmake out an equal protection claim.\n\n                                             6\n\f</pre>",
