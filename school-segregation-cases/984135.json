Christy (Christy), Thomas B. Guthrie (Guthrie), and Ira Perkins (Perkins) appeal from the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees Donald P. Hodel, Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) and the United States Department of Interior (Department).  The district court rejected plaintiffs' claim that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and certain regulations promulgated thereunder are unconstitutional as applied because they prevent plaintiffs from defending their sheep by killing grizzly bears.  The court also rejected plaintiffs' claims that the ESA unlawfully delegated legislative authority to the Secretary and that the Secretary exceeded his lawful authority in promulgating the regulations at issue.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Christy owned 1700 head of sheep.  On or about June 1, 1982, he began grazing the sheep on land he had leased from the Blackfeet Indian Tribe.  The land was located adjacent to Glacier National Park in Glacier County, Montana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning about July 1, 1982, bears attacked the herd on a nightly basis.  The herder employed by Christy frightened the bears away with limited success by building fires and shooting a gun into the air.  Christy sought assistance from Kenneth Wheeler, a trapper employed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.  Wheeler set snares in an attempt to capture the bears.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By July 9, 1982, the bears had killed approximately twenty sheep, worth at least $1200.  That evening, while Christy and Wheeler were on the leased land together, Christy observed two grizzly bears emerge from the forest.  One of the bears quickly retreated to the trees.  The other bear moved toward the herd.  When the animal was 60-100 yards away, Christy picked up his rifle and fired one shot, which hit the bear.  It ran a short distance, then fell to the ground.  Christy approached the bear and fired a second shot into its carcass to ensure that it was dead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wheeler's subsequent efforts to capture any bears were unsuccessful.  On July 22, 1982, the Tribe agreed to terminate the lease and to refund Christy's money.  On July 24, 1982, Christy removed his sheep from the leased land, having lost a total of 84 sheep to the bears during the lease term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to authority conferred by the ESA, the Secretary has listed the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) as a threatened species throughout the 48 contiguous states.  50 C.F.R. Sec. 17.11(h) (1987).  Regulations promulgated by the Department forbid the \"taking\" of grizzly bears, except in certain specified circumstances.  See id. Sec. 17.40(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department assessed a civil penalty of $3,000 against Christy for killing a grizzly bear in violation of the ESA and the regulations.  On August 13, 1984, at Christy's request, the Department held an administrative hearing.  At the hearing, Christy admitted that he had killed the bear knowing it to be a grizzly, but contended that he did so in the exercise of his right to defend his sheep.  The administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld the imposition of a penalty but lowered the amount to $2,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Christy filed an administrative appeal, arguing that the imposition of a penalty violated his alleged constitutional right to defend his sheep.  The appeal was denied on the ground that the Department had no jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of federal laws or regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 1986, Christy instituted the present action.  Also named as plaintiffs are Guthrie and Perkins, who have pastured flocks of sheep in Teton County, Montana.  Guthrie and Perkins allege that they, too, have lost sheep to grizzly bears.  They allege that they were informed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service that they would be fined if they harmed or killed a grizzly bear, even in defense of their sheep.  Guthrie alleges that, \"[a]s a result of his losses to the grizzly bears and the harassment of the flock by the bears in the years 1984 and 1985, Guthrie sold all the merchantable sheep from his flock in 1985.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction restraining defendants from enforcing the ESA and the grizzly bear regulations against them.  Christy seeks a declaration that the Department's application of the ESA and the regulations to him in the administrative proceeding deprived him of \"his fundamental right to possess and protect his property,\" deprived him of his property and liberty without just compensation or due process, and deprived him of equal protection of the laws.  Guthrie and Perkins seek a declaration that the promulgation of the regulations was unconstitutional on the same grounds asserted by Christy.  All plaintiffs seek a declaration that application of the ESA and the regulations to them in circumstances where they are defending their property is unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs also seek declarations that the ESA contained an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Secretary and that the Secretary exceeded his delegated authority in promulgating the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department filed a counterclaim against Christy seeking judgment in the amount of $2,500, plus interest, representing the unpaid penalty assessed against him by the ALJ.  The Department lodged the administrative record with the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 1986, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.  The defendants relied on the facts alleged in the complaint and on the administrative record.  In response, plaintiffs asserted that \"genuine issues of material fact exist as to allegations of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\"    Plaintiffs, however, submitted no affidavits or other evidence in opposition to the defendants' motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, 1987, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment.  The court found that \"[t]he material facts preceding and arising from this lawsuit are not in dispute.\"    The court ruled that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that there is a fundamental right to possess and protect property.  Accordingly, the court evaluated the ESA and the grizzly bear regulations under the \"rational basis\" test and found that they satisfied that test.  The court next rejected plaintiffs' contention that the loss of their sheep constituted a taking of their property by the federal government without just compensation.  The court held that damage to private property by protected wildlife does not constitute a taking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further concluded that \"the ESA is a valid delegation of legislative authority,\" and that \"the regulations at issue are a rational reflection of Congressional will, properly promulgated under the authority vested in the Secretary of the Interior.\"    Finally, the court affirmed the penalty assessed against Christy by the ALJ, finding that it was supported by substantial evidence contained in the administrative record.  Plaintiffs now appeal from the judgment entered against them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action arises under the United States Constitution and under the ESA, 16 U.S.C. Secs. 1533(d), 1540(g) (1982).  The district court had jurisdiction over the action pursuant to section 1540(g) and 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1331, 1346(a)(2) (1982).  We have jurisdiction over plaintiffs' appeal from the final judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 (1982).  The judgment was entered on May 4, 1987, and plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal on June 30, 1987.  Thus, the notice was timely filed.  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.   Coverdell v. Department of Social &amp; Health Services, 834 F.2d 758, 761 (9th Cir.1987).  We must determine, \"viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.\"   Id. at 761-62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that entry of summary judgment was improper because \"many genuine issues of material fact are unresolved.\"    In their motion for summary judgment, the defendants relied on facts set forth in plaintiffs' own complaint, together with the administrative record.  Plaintiffs submitted no evidence, by affidavit or otherwise, in opposition to the defendants' motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant's motion shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact, a plaintiff's unsupported assertion to the contrary is insufficient to forestall summary judgment.  \"Once the moving party shows the absence of evidence [to support the nonmoving party's case], the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to designate ' \"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" ' \"   Id. at 769 (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)).  Because plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the existence of any genuine issues of material fact,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> we need only determine whether the district court correctly applied the relevant law to the facts of record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Do the ESA and the Regulations, as Applied, Deprive Plaintiffs of Property Without Due Process?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that application of the ESA and the regulations so as to prevent them from defending their sheep against destruction by grizzly bears deprives them of property without due process, in violation of the fifth amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   The first step in our analysis is to determine the standard to be applied in reviewing the challenged legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strict judicial scrutiny of legislation that allegedly violates the due process clause is reserved for those enactments that \"impinge upon constitutionally protected rights.\"   San Antonio Indep. School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 40, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1300, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973).  When legislation impairs the exercise of a \"fundamental\" right, the government \"must prove to the Court that the law is necessary to promote a compelling or overriding interest.\"    2 Rotunda Sec. 15.4, at 59;  accord Beller v. Middendorf, 632 F.2d 788, 808 (9th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 905, 101 S.Ct. 3030, 69 L.Ed.2d 405, 454 U.S. 855, 102 S.Ct. 304, 70 L.Ed.2d 150 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, when the legislative enactment infringes on no fundamental right, \"the law need only rationally relate to any legitimate end of government.\"    2 Rotunda Sec. 15.4, at 59;  accord Beller, 632 F.2d at 808.  The law will be upheld if the court can hypothesize any possible basis on which the legislature might have acted.  See supra note 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right claimed by the plaintiffs in this action is the right \"to protect their property from immediate destruction from federally protected wildlife.\"    In their opening brief, plaintiffs characterize this as a \"natural and fundamental constitutional right.\"    In their reply brief, plaintiffs backtrack somewhat, arguing that the right \"should be deemed fundamental.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certain state courts have construed their own constitutions to protect the sort of right claimed by the plaintiffs in this case.   See, e.g., Cross v. State, 370 P.2d 371, 376, 377 (Wyo.1962) (due process clause in state constitution construed to guarantee \"the inherent and inalienable right to protect property\");  State v. Rathbone, 110 Mont. 225, ---, 100 P.2d 86, 90 (1940) (state constitution expressly guaranteed the right \"of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property\");  see generally Annotation, Right to Kill Game in Defense of Person or Property, 93 A.L.R.2d 1366 (1964).  No court, however, has construed the United States Constitution to protect such a right.   See Mountain States Legal Found v. Hodel, 799 F.2d 1423, 1428 n. 8 (10th Cir.1986) (en banc) (noting the absence of authority on the question), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 107 S.Ct. 1616, 94 L.Ed.2d 800 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ESA expressly provides that no civil penalty shall be imposed on a defendant who proves that, in killing a member of a threatened species, the defendant was acting in self-defense or in defense of others.  16 U.S.C. Sec. 1540(a)(3) (1982);  see 50 C.F.R. Sec. 17.40(b)(1)(i)(B) (1987) (\"Grizzly bears may be taken in self-defense, or in defense of others....\").  The defendant may raise the same defense in criminal prosecutions under the ESA.  16 U.S.C. Sec. 1540(b)(3) (1982).  The ESA makes no mention, however, of a right to kill a member of a threatened species in defense of property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>   One circuit court has opined that this omission evinces a congressional view that no such right exists under the United States Constitution.   See Mountain States, 799 F.2d at 1428 n. 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly recognize a right to kill federally protected wildlife in defense of property.  Plaintiffs, nevertheless, urge that we infer such a right, in much the same way that the Supreme Court has inferred a constitutional right to privacy despite the absence of language expressly recognizing such a right. See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 484-85, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 1681-82, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965) (state law forbidding married couples from using contraceptives violated constitutional right to privacy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has recently expressed reluctance \"to discover new fundamental rights imbedded in the Due Process Clause.\"   Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 194, 106 S.Ct. 2841, 2846, 92 L.Ed.2d 140 (1986).  The Court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>There should be ... great resistance to expand the substantive reach of [the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments], particularly if it requires redefining the category of rights deemed to be fundamental.  Otherwise, the Judiciary necessarily takes to itself further authority to govern the country without express constitutional authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 195, 106 S.Ct. at 2846.  The Court in Bowers refused to recognize a fundamental constitutional right of homosexuals to engage in sodomy, rejecting the argument that the constitutional right to privacy extended to protect such conduct.   Id. at 190-94, 106 S.Ct. at 2843-46.  The Court's reticence to \"redefin[e] the category of rights deemed to be fundamental\" is further manifested by the Court's refusal to find a fundamental right to such necessities as education, Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at 37, 93 S.Ct. at 1299, and adequate housing, Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 74, 92 S.Ct. 862, 874, 31 L.Ed.2d 36 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's teaching is clear and unmistakable--federal courts should refrain from divining new fundamental rights from the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments, at least when the claimed right is neither \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\" Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937), overruled on other grounds, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969), or \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,\" Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 1938, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (op. of Powell, J.).  Thus, we recently \"heed[ed] the Supreme Court's counsels of caution\" and refused to extend the right to privacy to include the right of a prison inmate to be free from a state official's unauthorized disclosure of intimate photographs of the inmate's wife.   Davis v. Bucher, 853 F.2d 718, 719, 721 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the Supreme Court's admonition that we exercise restraint in creating new definitions of substantive due process, we decline plaintiffs' invitation to construe the fifth amendment as guaranteeing the right to kill federally protected wildlife in defense of property.  In so doing, we do not minimize the seriousness of the problem faced by livestock owners such as plaintiffs nor do we suggest that defense of property is an unimportant value.  We simply hold that the right to kill federally protected wildlife in defense of property is not \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\" nor so \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition\" that it can be recognized by us as a fundamental right guaranteed by the fifth amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of our determination that the killing of grizzly bears to protect sheep is not a fundamental right enjoyed by the plaintiffs, we are not required to subject the ESA and the grizzly bear regulations to strict scrutiny.  Instead, we must determine whether those enactments rationally further a legitimate governmental objective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs do not argue that preservation of threatened species is an impermissible objective, or that Congress lacks authority to pursue that objective.  Plaintiffs contend, rather, that the ESA and the grizzly bear regulations do not rationally further that objective.  Plaintiffs' position appears to be that regulations preventing citizens from protecting their property against depredating bears will inevitably generate a backlash, including \"unlawful killings resulting from the gross unfairness of the existing system.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree that the ESA and the regulations have no rational basis.  Congress's intent in enacting the ESA was \"to halt and reverse the trend towards species extinction, whatever the cost.\"    Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 184, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2297, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978).  The regulations at issue plainly advance this goal by forbidding the killing of grizzly bears, except in certain limited circumstances.  See 50 C.F.R. Sec. 17.40(b)(1)(i) (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations recognize the concerns and accommodate the needs of owners of livestock and other property by authorizing the killing of \"nuisance bears\" by government officials when efforts to live-capture such bears have been unsuccessful.  See id. Sec. 17.40(b)(1)(i)(C).  The regulations are reasonable in requiring private citizens to seek the assistance of experienced government officials, who may be expected to protect the public interest, rather than leaving every individual free to kill a \"nuisance bear\" whenever he or she deems it necessary.   See State v.

This is certainly not a classification that appears on the face of the challenged enactments.  Nor have the plaintiffs proffered any evidence to suggest that the prohibition on the killing of grizzly bears is applied with greater severity against persons raising livestock near grizzly bear habitat.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>   Finally, plaintiffs do not contend that the enactments constitute a device for imposing excessive burdens on such persons.

Nor does this classification impair the exercise of any fundamental constitutional right.  See Part III(A) supra.    Accordingly, the classification should be upheld if it satisfies the \"rational basis\" test, i.e., if any state of facts can be conceived to justify it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that no rational basis supports the provision for sport hunting of grizzly bears:  \"Not only is the hunting of a threatened species unrelated to the goals of the Act, it is in complete derogation of its purposes, i.e. the preservation of threatened species....  Indeed, given the threatened nature of their existence, allowing hunters to take even one [grizzly bear] arguably would be in direct conflict with the Act.  Since this classification is in complete contradiction of the purposes of the Act, it can in no way have even a rational relationship to the purposes of the Act, as a matter of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' argument is premised on the unsupported assumption that a program of carefully controlled killings of bears in limited geographic regions cannot promote \"conservation\" and, therefore, necessarily conflicts with the purpose of the ESA.  On the contrary, Congress expressly contemplated that \"in the extraordinary case where population pressures within a given ecosystem cannot be otherwise relieved,\" conservation may require \"regulated taking.\"    16 U.S.C. Sec. 1532(3) (1982).  Further, although it expressly prohibited the killing of endangered species, Congress delegated to the Secretary the task of determining whether the killing of threatened species should also be prohibited.  Compare id. Sec. 1538(a)(1)(B) (imposing general prohibition on killing of endangered species) with id. Sec. 1533(d) (Secretary \"shall issue such regulations as he deems necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of\" threatened species).  Congress authorized, but did not require, the Secretary to forbid the killing of threatened species.  Id. Sec. 1533(d).  This legislative scheme reflects Congress's conclusion that certain killings of a threatened species could be consistent with the goal of conserving that species.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary had a rational basis for authorizing \"regulated taking\" of grizzly bears, by means of sport hunting, in those regions specified in the regulations.  The basis is set forth in Amendment Listing the Grizzly Bear of the 48 Coterminous States as a Threatened Species, 40 Fed.Reg. 31,734-35 (1975) [hereinafter Amendment].  Briefly, relying on investigations by Fish and Wildlife Service biologists, data submitted by the Governors of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Washington, and Wyoming, and comments filed by interested members of the public, the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, on behalf of the Secretary, determined that \"grizzly bear population pressures definitely exist in the Bob Marshall Ecosystem.\"    Id. at 31,735.  The Director considered easing such pressures through live-trapping and transplantation of the animals but rejected that approach as \"too dangerous and too expensive to be used with sufficient frequency to relieve the ... population pressures.\"    Id.  The Director concluded that \"[a] limited amount of regulated taking is necessary.\"    Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Director then considered whether such regulated \"taking\" should be accomplished through the isolated killing of nuisance bears or through seasonal sport hunting.  The Director concluded that isolated killings, while necessary, were \"not sufficient to prevent numerous depredations and threats to human safety.  This is because the occasional killing of one bear does not create a fear of man among the grizzly bear population in general.\"    Id.  A carefully controlled seasonal hunt, on the other hand, would both relieve the population pressures and condition the bears \"to avoid all areas where humans are encountered,\" thus minimizing human-bear contact and the resultant risks to both.  Id.  Accordingly, the Director ruled that the best system of relieving the population pressures in the Bob Marshall Ecosystem would be \"to combine limited taking of specific nuisance bears with a closely regulated sport hunt.\"    Id.  The promulgated regulations strictly controlled the total number of bears killed each year by mandating the cessation of hunting in any year \"where the total number of bears killed for whatever reason ... reaches 25 bears for that year.\"    Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the foregoing, the regulations authorizing a carefully controlled and limited sport hunt of grizzly bears in designated geographic regions had a rational basis.  Plaintiffs have proffered no evidence to suggest otherwise.  The classification employed by the regulations, therefore, does not deny plaintiffs equal protection of the laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

V.  This prohibition applies only to takings by the federal government.   See Twin Cities Chippewa Tribal Council v. Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, 370 F.2d 529, 533 (8th Cir.1967) (citing Koch v. Zuieback, 316 F.2d 1, 2 (9th Cir.1963)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>   Plaintiffs contend that by protecting grizzly bears, the Department has transformed the bears into \"governmental agents\" who have physically taken plaintiffs' property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants analyze this case under the principles applicable to regulatory takings.

The regulations themselves, however, do not purport to take, or even to regulate the use of, plaintiffs' property.  The regulations leave the plaintiffs in full possession of the complete \"bundle\" of property rights to their sheep.  Perhaps because plaintiffs recognize this fact, they choose to focus on the conduct of the bears.  Undoubtedly, the bears have physically taken plaintiffs' property, but plaintiffs err in attributing such takings to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Numerous cases have considered, and rejected, the argument that destruction of private property by protected wildlife constitutes a governmental taking.

The foregoing principle is inapplicable to the present case, because neither the ESA nor the grizzly bear regulations \"force\" plaintiffs to bear any burden.  The losses sustained by the plaintiffs are the incidental, and by no means inevitable, result of reasonable regulation in the public interest.  As one state court has aptly noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>Wherever protection is accorded [to wild animals] harm may be done to the individual.

In certain cases the Legislature may be mistaken in its belief that more good than harm is occasioned.  But this is clearly a matter which is confided to its discretion.  It exercises a governmental function for the benefit of the public at large, and no one can complain of the incidental injuries that may result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barrett v.

Sec. 1532(19) (1982).  This case concerns only the killing of grizzly bears in defense of sheep.  For the sake of precision, and to avoid confusion between plaintiffs' \"taking\" of grizzly bears and the government's alleged \"taking\" of plaintiffs' sheep without just compensation, our opinion shall refer to the \"killing,\" rather than the \"taking,\" of grizzly bears, except when quoting sources that use the latter term.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs assert that whether the ESA and the grizzly bear regulations rationally further Congress's goal of conserving threatened species is a genuine issue of material fact.  In assessing whether challenged legislation rationally furthers a legitimate governmental goal, the court will consider not only the basis on which the legislature actually acted, if ascertainable, but also any hypothetical basis on which it might have acted.  \"As long as there is any conceivable basis for finding such a rational relationship, the law will be upheld.\"    2 R.

Indeed, in the present case, Christy's herder enjoyed limited success in driving bears away by building fires and shooting a gun into the air.  Thus, it is inaccurate to say that the laws prevent an owner from defending his property against grizzly bears.  The laws merely operate to bar certain means of defending property from grizzly bears</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The Court applies a middle-level scrutiny to legislation that classifies individuals according to sex or legitimacy of birth.

Plaintiffs cite no authority for the proposition that a regulation that is evenhanded on its face and that is applied equally to all who violate its provisions nevertheless denies equal protection of the laws simply because it is likely to be applied more frequently against members of some identifiable, nonsuspect class of persons</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> On the basis of information collected subsequent to the promulgation of the initial regulations, the Secretary redesignated the geographic regions within which sport hunting would be permitted and lowered the number of bears that may be taken each year.

The Secretary specifically considered and rejected the argument \"that it was preposterous, illogical, and inconsistent to permit hunting of a threatened species.\"    Id. at 33,757.  The Secretary relied on studies and data suggesting that a carefully controlled sport hunt would eliminate unwary bears, thereby minimizing bear-human contact over the long-run and promoting conservation of the total bear population.

Christy (Christy), Thomas B. Guthrie (Guthrie), and Ira Perkins (Perkins) appeal from the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees Donald P. Hodel, Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) and the United States Department of Interior (Department).  The district court rejected plaintiffs' claim that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and certain regulations promulgated thereunder are unconstitutional as applied because they prevent plaintiffs from defending their sheep by killing grizzly bears.  The court also rejected plaintiffs' claims that the ESA unlawfully delegated legislative authority to the Secretary and that the Secretary exceeded his lawful authority in promulgating the regulations at issue.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Christy owned 1700 head of sheep.  On or about June 1, 1982, he began grazing the sheep on land he had leased from the Blackfeet Indian Tribe.  The land was located adjacent to Glacier National Park in Glacier County, Montana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning about July 1, 1982, bears attacked the herd on a nightly basis.  The herder employed by Christy frightened the bears away with limited success by building fires and shooting a gun into the air.  Christy sought assistance from Kenneth Wheeler, a trapper employed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.  Wheeler set snares in an attempt to capture the bears.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By July 9, 1982, the bears had killed approximately twenty sheep, worth at least $1200.  That evening, while Christy and Wheeler were on the leased land together, Christy observed two grizzly bears emerge from the forest.  One of the bears quickly retreated to the trees.  The other bear moved toward the herd.  When the animal was 60-100 yards away, Christy picked up his rifle and fired one shot, which hit the bear.  It ran a short distance, then fell to the ground.  Christy approached the bear and fired a second shot into its carcass to ensure that it was dead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wheeler's subsequent efforts to capture any bears were unsuccessful.  On July 22, 1982, the Tribe agreed to terminate the lease and to refund Christy's money.  On July 24, 1982, Christy removed his sheep from the leased land, having lost a total of 84 sheep to the bears during the lease term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to authority conferred by the ESA, the Secretary has listed the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) as a threatened species throughout the 48 contiguous states.  50 C.F.R. Sec. 17.11(h) (1987).  Regulations promulgated by the Department forbid the \"taking\" of grizzly bears, except in certain specified circumstances.  See id. Sec. 17.40(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department assessed a civil penalty of $3,000 against Christy for killing a grizzly bear in violation of the ESA and the regulations.  On August 13, 1984, at Christy's request, the Department held an administrative hearing.  At the hearing, Christy admitted that he had killed the bear knowing it to be a grizzly, but contended that he did so in the exercise of his right to defend his sheep.  The administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld the imposition of a penalty but lowered the amount to $2,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Christy filed an administrative appeal, arguing that the imposition of a penalty violated his alleged constitutional right to defend his sheep.  The appeal was denied on the ground that the Department had no jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of federal laws or regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 1986, Christy instituted the present action.  Also named as plaintiffs are Guthrie and Perkins, who have pastured flocks of sheep in Teton County, Montana.  Guthrie and Perkins allege that they, too, have lost sheep to grizzly bears.  They allege that they were informed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service that they would be fined if they harmed or killed a grizzly bear, even in defense of their sheep.  Guthrie alleges that, \"[a]s a result of his losses to the grizzly bears and the harassment of the flock by the bears in the years 1984 and 1985, Guthrie sold all the merchantable sheep from his flock in 1985.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction restraining defendants from enforcing the ESA and the grizzly bear regulations against them.  Christy seeks a declaration that the Department's application of the ESA and the regulations to him in the administrative proceeding deprived him of \"his fundamental right to possess and protect his property,\" deprived him of his property and liberty without just compensation or due process, and deprived him of equal protection of the laws.  Guthrie and Perkins seek a declaration that the promulgation of the regulations was unconstitutional on the same grounds asserted by Christy.  All plaintiffs seek a declaration that application of the ESA and the regulations to them in circumstances where they are defending their property is unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs also seek declarations that the ESA contained an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Secretary and that the Secretary exceeded his delegated authority in promulgating the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department filed a counterclaim against Christy seeking judgment in the amount of $2,500, plus interest, representing the unpaid penalty assessed against him by the ALJ.  The Department lodged the administrative record with the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 1986, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.  The defendants relied on the facts alleged in the complaint and on the administrative record.  In response, plaintiffs asserted that \"genuine issues of material fact exist as to allegations of Plaintiffs' Complaint.\"    Plaintiffs, however, submitted no affidavits or other evidence in opposition to the defendants' motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, 1987, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment.  The court found that \"[t]he material facts preceding and arising from this lawsuit are not in dispute.\"    The court ruled that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that there is a fundamental right to possess and protect property.  Accordingly, the court evaluated the ESA and the grizzly bear regulations under the \"rational basis\" test and found that they satisfied that test.  The court next rejected plaintiffs' contention that the loss of their sheep constituted a taking of their property by the federal government without just compensation.  The court held that damage to private property by protected wildlife does not constitute a taking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further concluded that \"the ESA is a valid delegation of legislative authority,\" and that \"the regulations at issue are a rational reflection of Congressional will, properly promulgated under the authority vested in the Secretary of the Interior.\"    Finally, the court affirmed the penalty assessed against Christy by the ALJ, finding that it was supported by substantial evidence contained in the administrative record.  Plaintiffs now appeal from the judgment entered against them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action arises under the United States Constitution and under the ESA, 16 U.S.C. Secs. 1533(d), 1540(g) (1982).  The district court had jurisdiction over the action pursuant to section 1540(g) and 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1331, 1346(a)(2) (1982).  We have jurisdiction over plaintiffs' appeal from the final judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 (1982).  The judgment was entered on May 4, 1987, and plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal on June 30, 1987.  Thus, the notice was timely filed.  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Further, although it expressly prohibited the killing of endangered species, Congress delegated to the Secretary the task of determining whether the killing of threatened species should also be prohibited.  Compare id. Sec. 1538(a)(1)(B) (imposing general prohibition on killing of endangered species) with id. Sec. 1533(d) (Secretary \"shall issue such regulations as he deems necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of\" threatened species).  Congress authorized, but did not require, the Secretary to forbid the killing of threatened species.  Id. Sec. 1533(d).  This legislative scheme reflects Congress's conclusion that certain killings of a threatened species could be consistent with the goal of conserving that species.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary had a rational basis for authorizing \"regulated taking\" of grizzly bears, by means of sport hunting, in those regions specified in the regulations.  The basis is set forth in Amendment Listing the Grizzly Bear of the 48 Coterminous States as a Threatened Species, 40 Fed.Reg. 31,734-35 (1975) [hereinafter Amendment].  Briefly, relying on investigations by Fish and Wildlife Service biologists, data submitted by the Governors of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Washington, and Wyoming, and comments filed by interested members of the public, the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, on behalf of the Secretary, determined that \"grizzly bear population pressures definitely exist in the Bob Marshall Ecosystem.\"    Id. at 31,735.  The Director considered easing such pressures through live-trapping and transplantation of the animals but rejected that approach as \"too dangerous and too expensive to be used with sufficient frequency to relieve the ... population pressures.\"    Id.  The Director concluded that \"[a] limited amount of regulated taking is necessary.\"    Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Director then considered whether such regulated \"taking\" should be accomplished through the isolated killing of nuisance bears or through seasonal sport hunting.  The Director concluded that isolated killings, while necessary, were \"not sufficient to prevent numerous depredations and threats to human safety.  This is because the occasional killing of one bear does not create a fear of man among the grizzly bear population in general.\"    Id.  A carefully controlled seasonal hunt, on the other hand, would both relieve the population pressures and condition the bears \"to avoid all areas where humans are encountered,\" thus minimizing human-bear contact and the resultant risks to both.  Id.  Accordingly, the Director ruled that the best system of relieving the population pressures in the Bob Marshall Ecosystem would be \"to combine limited taking of specific nuisance bears with a closely regulated sport hunt.\"    Id.  The promulgated regulations strictly controlled the total number of bears killed each year by mandating the cessation of hunting in any year \"where the total number of bears killed for whatever reason ... reaches 25 bears for that year.\"    Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the foregoing, the regulations authorizing a carefully controlled and limited sport hunt of grizzly bears in designated geographic regions had a rational basis.

Plaintiffs have proffered no evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact concerning the validity of the Secretary's stated reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, the Secretary did not exceed his delegated authority in promulgating regulations providing for limited and controlled sport hunting of grizzly bears in designated geographic regions of Montana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth herein, we AFFIRM the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Honorable Thelton E.

Sec. 1532(19) (1982).  This case concerns only the killing of grizzly bears in defense of sheep.  For the sake of precision, and to avoid confusion between plaintiffs' \"taking\" of grizzly bears and the government's alleged \"taking\" of plaintiffs' sheep without just compensation, our opinion shall refer to the \"killing,\" rather than the \"taking,\" of grizzly bears, except when quoting sources that use the latter term.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs assert that whether the ESA and the grizzly bear regulations rationally further Congress's goal of conserving threatened species is a genuine issue of material fact.  In assessing whether challenged legislation rationally furthers a legitimate governmental goal, the court will consider not only the basis on which the legislature actually acted, if ascertainable, but also any hypothetical basis on which it might have acted.  \"As long as there is any conceivable basis for finding such a rational relationship, the law will be upheld.\"    2 R. Rotunda, J. Nowak &amp; J. Young, Treatise on Constitutional Law:  Substance and Procedure Sec. 15.4, at 59 (1986) [hereinafter Rotunda];  id. at 60 (\"The law will be upheld so long as the justices can conceive of a basis for terming the classification rationally related to a legitimate end of government.\").  Since the court itself may postulate a basis for the legislation, satisfaction of the rationality test should be deemed a legal, rather than a factual, issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The fifth amendment provides, in pertinent part:  \"No person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law....\"  U.S. Const. amend.

Indeed, in the present case, Christy's herder enjoyed limited success in driving bears away by building fires and shooting a gun into the air.  Thus, it is inaccurate to say that the laws prevent an owner from defending his property against grizzly bears.  The laws merely operate to bar certain means of defending property from grizzly bears</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The Court applies a middle-level scrutiny to legislation that classifies individuals according to sex or legitimacy of birth.   Jeter, 108 S.Ct. at 1914;  2 Rotunda Sec. 18.3, at 326-27.  Classifications of this sort are not involved in the present case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Of course, persons raising livestock near grizzly bear habitat are more likely to find themselves restrained by the regulations than, for example, persons residing in large metropolitan areas far removed from bear country.  By the same token, persons who travel by automobile are more likely to find themselves restrained by speed limits than persons who travel by bicycle.  Plaintiffs cite no authority for the proposition that a regulation that is evenhanded on its face and that is applied equally to all who violate its provisions nevertheless denies equal protection of the laws simply because it is likely to be applied more frequently against members of some identifiable, nonsuspect class of persons</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> On the basis of information collected subsequent to the promulgation of the initial regulations, the Secretary redesignated the geographic regions within which sport hunting would be permitted and lowered the number of bears that may be taken each year.  See Revision of Special Regulations for the Grizzly Bear, 51 Fed. Reg. 33,753 (1986).  The Secretary specifically considered and rejected the argument \"that it was preposterous, illogical, and inconsistent to permit hunting of a threatened species.\"    Id. at 33,757.  The Secretary relied on studies and data suggesting that a carefully controlled sport hunt would eliminate unwary bears, thereby minimizing bear-human contact over the long-run and promoting conservation of the total bear population.
