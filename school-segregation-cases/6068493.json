On page 32, before the second full paragraph that begins \"The allegations in\n\nSDOG's lawsuit\" insert the following paragraphs:\n\n             Recently, in Park v. Board of Trustees of California State University\n             (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057 (Park), the California Supreme Court clarified\n             that \"[a] claim arises from protected activity when that activity\n             underlies or forms the basis for the claim.\" (Id. at p. 1062.) \"'[T]he\n\fdefendant's act underlying the plaintiff's cause of action must itself\nhave been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free\nspeech.'\" (Id. at p. 1063, italics omitted.) \"[T]he focus is on\ndetermining what 'the defendant's activity [is] that gives rise to his or\nher asserted liability—and whether that activity constitutes protected\nspeech or petitioning.'\" (Ibid.) Accordingly, \"'[t]he only means\nspecified in section 425.16 by which a moving defendant can satisfy\nthe [\"arising from\"] requirement is to demonstrate that the\ndefendant's conduct by which plaintiff claims to have been injured\nfalls within one of the four categories described in subdivision\n(e) . . . .'\" (Ibid., italics omitted.) \"[I]n ruling on an anti-SLAPP\nmotion, courts should consider the elements of the challenged claim\nand what actions by defendant supply those elements and\nconsequently form the basis for liability.\" (Ibid.)\n\nHere, SDOG's claim under Government Code section 1090 requires\nit to show Hearn was financially interested in a contract made by her\nin her official capacity as a state employee. (Gov. Code, § 1090,\nsubd. (a).) Moreover, in determining whether its claims are based on\nprotected activity, SDOG concedes its entire complaint is \"based on\"\nthe \"execution of agreements by Respondents.\" Thus, the specific\nelements of SDOG's claims depend on the existence of the 2012\nAgreement and 2015 lease. These contracts that SDOG challenges\nare not merely evidence of liability, nor are they merely a step\nleading to some different act for which liability is asserted. (See\nPark, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1060 [\"a claim may be struck only if the\nspeech or petitioning activity itself is the wrong complained of, and\nnot just evidence of liability or a step leading to some different act\nfor which liability is asserted\"].) Rather, SDOG's complaint alleges\nthese agreements are \"illegal[]\" and, therefore, asks the court to enter\njudgment declaring each of them to be \"void.\" SDOG could not\nhave omitted from its complaint allegations regarding the 2012\nAgreement and 2015 lease and still state the same claims.\n\nMoreover, SDOG's assertion that the challenged contracts are\nmerely a step leading to potential newsgathering and not in\nthemselves newsgathering is incorrect. The contracts dictate the\nway in which inewsource and KPBS gather and publish the news.\nThe contracts require inewsource to deliver to KPBS specific news\nstories and to make their reporters available to KPBS in exchange\nfor office space. Accordingly, because the protected activity—here,\ncontracts for newsgathering, news collaboration, and news reporting\nto the public—are in themselves elements of the challenged claims,\n\n                                   2\n\f          the trial court correctly determined SDOG's lawsuit arises from\n          defendants' protected activity. (See Park, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p.\n          1068.)\n\n       2. On page 32, at the start of the first sentence of the existing second full\n\nparagraph, insert the word \"Further,\" so the sentence now reads:\n\n          Further, the allegations in SDOG's lawsuit make clear the injury-\n          producing conduct underlying its claims consists of the contracts\n          between inewsource and KPBS that govern the process in which\n          these defendants jointly engage in newsgathering and reporting news\n          to the public.\n\n       3. On page 33, line 7, change the citation from \"section 426.16, subdivision (e)\" to\n\n\"section 425.16, subdivision (e).\"\n\n       4. On page 35, before the first full paragraph that begins \"In a related argument\"\n\ninsert the following new paragraphs:\n\n          Quoting Park, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1060, SDOG asserts \"'a claim\n          may be struck only if the speech or petitioning activity itself is the\n          wrong complained of, and not just evidence of liability or a step\n          leading to some different act for which liability is asserted.'\" SDOG\n          contends we must, therefore, \"segregate the negotiating and entering\n          into the Agreements from the subject of the Agreements.\" SDOG\n          argues the anti-SLAPP analysis would be the same regardless of the\n          content of the challenged contracts. SDOG asserts, \"As an example,\n          the Agreements at issue here would be equally outside the scope of\n          the anti-SLAPP statute if Ms. Hearn were a licensed building\n          contractor and had used her faculty position at SDSU to procure a\n          long-term construction contract between SDSU and her construction\n          company.\"\n\nSDOG's argument fails because in determining whether the challenged\ncontracts are protected under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(4), the fact these\ncontracts are for gathering and delivering news stories and not some other\npurpose matters. The Supreme Court's explanation in Park, supra, 2 Cal.5th\n1057 of the decision in Hunter, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th 1510 explains why. In\nHunter, the defendant television station argued that (1) the station itself\nengaged in speech on matters of public interest through its news and weather\n\n                                              3\n\fbroadcasts, and (2) the decision as to who should present that message was\nthus conduct in furtherance of the station's protected speech on matters of\npublic interest. (See discussion in Park, supra, at pp. 1071-1072 .) The instant\ncase is effectively indistinguishable: Inewsource is a news organization that\npublishes news stories of public interest, and its decision of whom to partner\nwith to deliver the news (i.e., KPBS, under the challenged contracts) is conduct\nin furtherance of its protected speech on matters of public interest. Under\nsection 425.16, subdivision (e)(4), protected activity includes \"any other\nconduct in furtherance of the exercise of the . . . constitutional right of free\nspeech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" SDOG\nis not seeking to void a contract to make widgets or to construct a building. It\nis seeking to void contracts that directly affect the content of news stories the\npublic receives. That protected content brings this case within section 425.16,\nsubdivision (e)(4).\n\nThe analysis might well be different if SDOG sought to void the hypothetical\nconstruction contract it posits, or any number of other hypothetical contracts\nthat do not involve newsgathering and reporting. However, this case, like\nHunter, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th 1510, involves protected newsgathering and\nnews reporting. Inewsource is not a construction company. It is in the news\nreporting business, and the contracts SDOG challenges shape the way\ninewsource and KPBS gather, produce, and report the news.\n\n       5. On page 36, footnote 17 is deleted and a new footnote 17 is inserted in its place\n\nso footnote 17 now reads:\n17\n   Under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(4), conduct in furtherance of the\nexercise of free speech rights is protected only where such conduct is \"in\nconnection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" In granting the\nmotions to strike, the trial court determined \"this action arises from protected\nactivity under [section] 425.16.\" On appeal, the trial court's order is presumed\ncorrect and \"'it is the appellant's burden to affirmatively demonstrate error.'\"\n(Ruelas v. Superior Court (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 374, 383.) \"'To demonstrate\nerror, [the] appellant must present meaningful legal analysis supported by\ncitations to authority and citations to facts in the record that support the claim\nof error.'\" (Multani v. Witkin & Neal (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1428, 1457.)\nHowever, as inewsource notes, SDOG does not address the public interest\nprong of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(4) in its opening brief discussion of\nwhether its claims arise from protected activity. Accordingly, the issue is\nforfeited. (H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation v. City of Escondido (2005)\n127 Cal.App.4th 1, 15.)\n\n\n                                             4\n\f      There is no change in the judgment.\n\n      Plaintiff's petition for rehearing is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      HUFFMAN, Acting P.

Alter\n\nfor Real Parties in Interest and Respondents.\n\n       A free press is a foundation of citizen participation in government because the\n\npress informs people about issues of public concern and provides a place for debate about\n\npublic issues. A lawsuit filed primarily to chill the valid exercise of free speech is called\n\na SLAPP suit and, if without merit, such an action may be dismissed early under Code of\n\nCivil Procedure1 section 425.16 in what is commonly known as an anti-SLAPP motion.2\n\n       In this anti-SLAPP case, investigative newsource (inewsource), an independent,\n\nnonprofit journalism organization, entered into contracts with KPBS, San Diego's public\n\nradio and television station, to gather and produce news stories with and for KPBS, in\n\nexchange for the right to use KPBS offices, media equipment, and related news facilities.\n\nKPBS is a department of San Diego State University (SDSU), and inewsource and KPBS\n\nhave jointly created hundreds of news stories.\n\n       In February 2015 inewsource began publishing articles critical of attorney Cory\n\nBriggs. For example, one was entitled \"Cory Briggs' Land Deals Raise Ethical Legal\n\nQuestions\" and another was called \"San Diego Attorney's Environmental Lawsuits Could\n\nBe Tainted by Conflict of Interest.\"\n\n\n\n\n1      All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n2      \"'SLAPP' is an acronym for 'strategic lawsuit against public participation.'\" (Baral\nv. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 381, fn. 1 (Baral).)\n                                              2\n\f       After inewsource published about a dozen more critical stories about Briggs, San\n\nDiegans for Open Government (SDOG)—an entity inewsource reported is controlled by\n\nBriggs—sued inewsource, along with its founder, Loretta Hearn, and also SDSU,\n\nCalifornia State University (CSU), and San Diego State University Research Foundation\n\n(SDSURF).\n\n       The gist of SDOG's complaint is the contracts between KPBS and inewsource\n\nviolate statutory prohibitions on self-dealing involving public funds because Hearn was\n\nallegedly influencing both sides of the transaction—for SDSU as a faculty member, and\n\nfor inewsource as its executive director. SDOG also alleges inewsource and Hearn\n\nmisappropriated the names KPBS and SDSU.\n\n       Asserting SDOG's lawsuit is based on the exercise of their constitutionally\n\nprotected speech rights and lacked merit, Defendants3 brought anti-SLAPP motions. The\n\ncourt granted the motions.\n\n       SDOG appeals, contending the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply because (1) its\n\nlawsuit is a public interest lawsuit, exempt from the anti-SLAPP law under section\n\n425.17, subdivision (b); and (2) the exception to that exemption for media defendants\n\nunder section 425.17, subdivision (d) is inapplicable because its lawsuit has \"nothing to\n\ndo with stopping news reporting\" but is instead directed to stopping \"self-dealing by a\n\npublic employee.\"\n\n\n\n3     \"Defendants\" refers to the entities and persons SDOG named as defendants and\nrespondents, together with those named as defendants and real parties in interest, in their\ncomplaint.\n                                             3\n\f       Alternatively, SDOG asserts that if the anti-SLAPP statute applies, the order\n\nshould be reversed because (1) its lawsuit is not directed at protected activity; and (2)\n\neven if it is, SDOG established a probability of prevailing.\n\n       We affirm. Reporting news is protected speech. (Hunter v. CBS Broadcasting,\n\nInc. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1521 (Hunter).) News stories addressing issues of\n\npublic interest do not arise out of thin air. They often require newsgathering using\n\noffices, internet access, studios, and production services. Providing office space and\n\nrelated newsgathering facilities in exchange for investigative news stories furthers\n\nprotected speech. SDOG's lawsuit is therefore squarely within the anti-SLAPP statute,\n\nwhich protects not only speech, but also \"conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the\n\nconstitutional right of . . . free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of\n\npublic interest.\" (§ 425.16, subd. (e), italics added.)\n\n       We reject SDOG's assertion that the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply because its\n\nlawsuit targets unlawful self-dealing, not protected speech. SDOG's argument\n\nimproperly conflates distinct issues of conduct and motive. In determining whether the\n\nanti-SLAPP statute applies, the appropriate focus is on the alleged injury-producing\n\nconduct (here, the KPBS-inewsource contracts), and not the defendant's alleged wrongful\n\nmotive for engaging in that conduct (here, alleged self-dealing). (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1521-1523.)\n\n       Moreover, SDOG's reliance on the public interest exemption to the anti-SLAPP\n\nstatute in section 425.17, subdivision (b) is unavailing. That exemption does not apply to\n\nactions such as this one against news media engaged in newsgathering conduct.\n\n                                               4\n\f(§ 425.17, subd. (d)(1); Major v. Silna (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1485, 1496-1497\n\n(Major).)\n\n       Last, SDOG's claims fail on the merits because SDOG offered no admissible\n\nevidence to support its claims. SDOG's attempt to fill the evidentiary void by relying on\n\nallegations in its verified complaint is insufficient as a matter of law. (Brodeur v. Atlas\n\nEntertainment, Inc. (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 665, 679 (Brodeur).)\n\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       A. The News Media Parties\n\n       Hearn has been a professional journalist since 1974. In 2009 she founded\n\ninewsource, which creates investigative news stories on public issues.\n\n       KPBS is a media entity operating as a public service of SDSU. KPBS, with\n\nbroadcast facilities on the SDSU campus, delivers news and entertainment programming\n\nthrough television, radio, and digital media.\n\n       SDSURF is a nonprofit corporation and a separate legal entity from SDSU. For\n\nover 34 years, SDSURF has provided KPBS with financial accounting, tax reporting, and\n\nadministrative support.\n\n       In 2010 KPBS began publishing inewsource news stories. Reporters for these two\n\norganizations also began working together on stories of public interest.\n\n       B. The 2012 Agreement for Collaboration Between Inewsource and KPBS\n\n       In the fall of 2011, KPBS remodeled its newsroom and began a nightly news\n\ntelevision show. Hearn asked KPBS's station manager, Deanna Mackey, about moving\n\ninewsource into the remodeled KPBS newsroom because inewsource was looking for a\n\n                                                5\n\freliable audience for its investigative news. Hearn's proposal interested KPBS, which\n\nwas looking for more investigative news content.\n\n       In 2012 KPBS and inewsource entered into a contract under which KPBS agreed\n\nto provide inewsource newsroom space to allow inewsource reporters to work closely\n\nwith KPBS editors, reporters, and producers on collaborative work (the 2012\n\nAgreement).4 In exchange, inewsource agreed to give KPBS all of its news content for\n\ndistribution on radio, television, and the Internet. KPBS characterizes this relationship\n\nwith inewsource as a \"partnership\" that contemplates \"joint story telling.\"\n\n       Under the 2012 Agreement, KPBS agreed to provide inewsource with offices,\n\nfurniture, studios and production areas, telephone and internet connections, and news\n\ngathering equipment. KPBS also agreed to invite inewsource employees to daily news\n\nmeetings.\n\n       In exchange, inewsource agreed to provide KPBS with 10 \"substantial data driven\n\nstories\" during the term and one \"Watchdog feature per month,\" plus a \"[w]eekly data\n\nbrief on a topic of interest to KPBS' audience.\" Inewsource also agreed to provide\n\nreporters to KPBS and to provide KPBS access to its databases.\n\n       KPBS did not competitively bid the 2012 Agreement. Mackey, KPBS's station\n\nmanager who participated in drafting the 2012 Agreement, stated such a contract would\n\n\"never be subject to open bidding\" because \"content is qualitative\" and \"[p]artnerships\n\nbetween news organizations require trust . . . .\" Mackey stated KPBS \"only partners with\n\n\n4      The 2012 Agreement also states SDSURF is a party to that agreement and the\n\"contracting and fiscal agent for KPBS.\"\n                                             6\n\fnews organizations whose accuracy and content have proven to be trustworthy, such as\n\ninewsource.\" Vince Petronzio, associate general manager for business and financial\n\naffairs at KPBS, similarly stated that \"KPBS does not solicit open bids for content-based\n\ncontracts.\" He explained, \"In fact, because content is unique and qualitative, it would\n\nnever be subject to open bidding. . . . KPBS receives significant value from its\n\npartnership with inewsource because inewsource stories enhance the coverage that KPBS\n\ncan provide to its audience.\" He added, \"The partnership between KPBS and inewsource\n\nis definitely a value-for-value partnership.\"\n\n       In a declaration, Hearn asserted she negotiated the 2012 Agreement only on behalf\n\nof inewsource. Mackey and Suzanne Marmion, director of news and editorial strategy\n\nfor KPBS, negotiated the 2012 Agreement for KPBS. Neither Mackey nor Marmion has\n\nany financial interest in inewsource. In 2012, although Hearn occasionally volunteered\n\nas a guest lecturer for SDSU's school of journalism, she was not employed by SDSU and\n\nheld no executive or managerial role at SDSU.\n\n       Hearn's declaration states she has never been a KPBS board member or KPBS\n\nemployee and has \"never been in a position to influence [the KPBS] decision-making\n\nprocess or outcome in any way.\" She has never been a tenured or tenured-track SDSU\n\nprofessor, nor a department head, advisory board member, committee member, director,\n\nofficer, or department chairperson. Hearn has never been employed by SDSURF.\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f      C. The 2015 Extension and Lease\n\n      In 2015 inewsource and KPBS extended the 2012 Agreement (the 2015\n\nextension).5 They also entered into a new lease (2015 lease) under which KPBS leased\n\noffice space, conference rooms, studios, and production areas to inewsource for its\n\nreporters to use \"for the benefit of securing investigative news content for KPBS.\" Rent\n\nunder the 2015 lease was only one dollar; however, KPBS's station manager stated KPBS\n\nreceived \"significant value\" from this agreement because \"inewsource stories enhance the\n\ncoverage that KPBS can provide to its audience.\"\n\n      Hearn states she negotiated the 2015 extension and 2015 lease only on behalf of\n\ninewsource. Mackey and Marmion negotiated on behalf of KPBS. In 2015 Hearn was an\n\nadjunct professor of journalism at SDSU, teaching a three-unit class. SDSU paid Hearn\n\nfor her teaching time at its standard rate, and she received no other benefits from SDSU.\n\nHearn's declaration states she did not occupy any position of control or decision-making\n\nauthority with SDSU, SDSURF, or KPBS.\n\n      D. Nature of KPBS and Inewsource Collaboration\n\n      Inewsource and KPBS have jointly created and distributed more than 285 stories.\n\nIn most, inewsource reports the news, with input from KPBS editors and using KPBS\n\nvideographers. In other cases, KPBS reporters do the reporting and inewsource reporters\n\nedit. Occasionally, KPBS and inewsource collaborate to jointly report stories. In all\n\n\n\n\n5     SDSURF is also a party to the 2015 extension and lease agreement.\n\n                                            8\n\fthese situations, inewsource reporters work closely with KPBS editors and producers on\n\ncontent for KPBS.\n\n         E. Inewsource Articles About Briggs\n\n         In February 2015 inewsource began publishing uncomplimentary stories about\n\nBriggs. For example, one was entitled, \"San Diego Attorney's Environmental Lawsuits\n\nCould Be Tainted by Conflict of Interest.\" There, inewsource reported that Briggs's wife,\n\nSarichia Cacciatore, was listed as a project manager on a contract her employer had with\n\na government entity at the same time Briggs was suing that entity over environmental\n\nmatters. Briggs responded by stating on his website, \"My wife has a job, and I have a\n\njob. We don't talk about or share client confidences, and we take measures to avoid\n\ncreating any conflicts. There isn't anything illegal, unethical, or even unusual about this\n\neither.\"\n\n         The next day, in an article entitled, \"Document Links Briggs' Wife to His Law\n\nBusiness,\" inewsource reported that Cacciatore was listed as vice president of Briggs's\n\nlaw firm at the same time she worked on projects for government agencies Briggs was\n\nsuing.\n\n         On February 25, 2015, inewsource reprinted a letter Briggs posted on his website,\n\ndefending his conduct and stating, \"My clients aren't wealthy corporations. There are\n\npeople who have to fight and need a lawyer to represent them but often can't pay right\n\naway. I still fight for them.\"\n\n         On March 3, 2015, inewsource published three more articles about Briggs. These\n\nwere entitled \"Behind the Briggs Investigation,\" \"Helix: Briggs' Wife Did Not Disclose\n\n                                               9\n\fVP Role in His Law Firm,\" and \"Contested Transcript of San Diego Attorney Cory\n\nBriggs' Wife Released.\"\n\n       In these articles, inewsource reported that Cacciatore was employed by an\n\nenvironmental company that has done work for the City of San Diego (the City)—and\n\nthat Briggs sued the City regarding one of these projects. Inewsource reported, \"Records\n\nreleased Monday confirm Cory Briggs' wife was vice president of the Briggs Law\n\nCorp[oration] for the past 'twenty years,' which means she was an officer of the law firm\n\nhe used to sue the [City] at the same time she worked for a company on contract with the\n\ncity.\" Briggs responded, stating Cacciatore was vice president of his law corporation \"for\n\nreasons having nothing to do with running the firm and everything to do with things like\n\nestate planning . . . .\"\n\n       On March 10, 2015, inewsource reported that Briggs had sued the City about at\n\nleast one project Cacciatore worked on \"directly.\"\n\n       On March 30, 2015, Cacciatore and Briggs wrote to KPBS \"to give you notice of\n\nour demand, and to make that demand, for correction and retraction of false, inaccurate,\n\nand/or misleading reporting that may have been disseminated by KPBS . . . .\"\n\nInewsource and KPBS responded, stating it was \"unaware of any false fact\" in its story.\n\n       On April 7, 2015, inewsource reported that the environmental firm employing\n\nCacciatore had agreed to pay the City $143,000 to resolve the potential conflict of\n\ninterest claim. Earlier, Briggs wrote, \"'There isn't anything illegal, unethical or even\n\nunusual'\" about Cacciatore's employment and relationship to Briggs.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       One day later, inewsource published another article about Briggs, reporting\n\nCacciatore played a \"key role\" in an environmental review of a project near the Mexican\n\nborder. The article states Briggs filed a lawsuit alleging inadequacies in that project's\n\nanalysis of biological impacts, and Cacciatore—vice president of Briggs's law firm—was\n\nthe project's biologist. Inewsource also reported that Briggs had sued \"at least 15\n\ngovernment agencies\" that had contracted with the environmental firm employing\n\nCacciatore. The article states Briggs operates through nonprofit corporations, including\n\nSDOG, which are actually run by Briggs's associates, including his cousin. The article\n\nstates, \"Experts in legal ethics have told inewsource the connection between Briggs and\n\n[his wife] is a 'horrible' and 'problematic' conflict of interest.\" The article explains:\n\n\"Briggs' lawsuits against the [City] have cost taxpayers a significant amount of\nmoney over the years. But there was an undisclosed conflict of interest behind\nat least two of them, posing ethical and legal issues that recently resulted in a\ntaxpayer settlement.\"\n\n       On April 9, 2015, inewsource published Cacciatore's demand for correction and\n\nretraction, along with inewsource's lawyer's point-by-point response, refuting Briggs's\n\nassertions. The same day, SDOG filed the instant action. However, SDOG did not serve\n\nHearn with the lawsuit until June 2015.\n\n       F. Inewsource Publishes Another Article About Briggs\n\n       In the meantime, in late May 2015, inewsource published another\n\nuncomplimentary article about Briggs entitled \"Briggs-Associated Nonprofits Flout State,\n\nFederal Laws.\" There, inewsource reported, \"Briggs and his law firm have sued on\n\nbehalf of more than 30 charitable nonprofits, almost all of which he and his family helped\n\n\n                                              11\n\fcreate.\" Inewsource also reported that SDOG's officers have \"stated under oath that\n\nBriggs Law Corp[oration] oversees and pays for nearly every aspect of the group's\n\noperation\" and that SDOG \"does not have a penny to its name\":\n\n\"According to depositions and other court filings, Briggs and his law firm hold\nand maintain all the group's [SDOG's] corporate records, file and pay for its\nlawsuits, its annual registration fees and filings with the state and federal\ngovernments, control its Facebook and Twitter accounts; and collect all\nsettlements and judgment when the group prevails in court.\n\n\"[SDOG] doesn't have a penny to its name—nor has it recorded any revenue or\nexpenses with the federal or state agencies, according to government records.\"\n\n       Responding, SDOG's corporate secretary explained SDOG has no checking or\n\nsavings account because it wants to operate \"as simply and cleanly as possible.\" He also\n\nexplained that when SDOG loses a case, Briggs does not get reimbursed for his time or\n\nexpenses, and he is willing to \"risk substantial loss to fight the well-funded groups he\n\ntakes on for us.\"\n\n       G. SDOG's Complaint\n\n       The crux of SDOG's lawsuit here is its assertion the 2012 Agreement and 2015\n\nlease violate prohibitions on self-dealing and use of public funds for private benefit, and\n\ntherefore are void. The first cause of action is entitled, \"Illegality of 2012 Agreement.\"\n\nSDOG alleges that agreement violated Government Code section 1090 because Hearn\n\nwas then employed by SDSU and therefore had a financial interest on both sides of the\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\ftransaction.6 SDOG also alleges the 2012 Agreement should have been subject to a\n\ncompetitive bid process just like a construction contract or other public works project.\n\n       SDOG's second cause of action alleges the 2015 lease (referred to in the complaint\n\nas the 2014 lease) was negotiated or executed by Hearn in her official capacity as a\n\nSDSU employee while she had a conflicting financial interest as inewsource's executive\n\ndirector. SDOG alleges Hearn used her position as a SDSU lecturer to \"secure approval\"\n\nof the 2012 Agreement and 2015 lease for the benefit of inewsource, in violation of\n\nGovernment Code section 8314.7 SDOG also alleges inewsource infringed KPBS's and\n\nSDSU's trademarks by using them without permission and without paying compensation.\n\n       H. Anti-SLAPP Motions\n\n       Inewsource and Hearn filed an anti-SLAPP motion, accompanied by a request for\n\njudicial notice, 81 documentary exhibits, and declarations of Hearn, Norma Clark\n\n(SDSURF's associate executive director of facilities planning and management), Mackey,\n\nand Brad Racino, an inewsource reporter.\n\n       Inewsource and Hearn asserted SDOG's complaint attacked protected activity\n\nunder the anti-SLAPP statute; namely, the partnership between KPBS and inewsource for\n\n\n\n6      Government Code section 1090, subdivision (a) provides in part: \"Members of the\nLegislature, state, county, district, judicial district, and city officers or employees shall\nnot be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity, or by\nany body or board of which they are members.\"\n\n7      Government Code section 8314, subdivision (a) provides: \"It is unlawful for any\nelected state or local officer, including any state or local appointee, employee, or\nconsultant, to use or permit others to use public resources for a campaign activity, or\npersonal or other purposes which are not authorized by law.\"\n                                             13\n\fgathering and reporting news. They also presented admissible evidence showing SDOG's\n\nclaims lacked merit. For example, Hearn's declaration states:\n\n\"[SDOG] alleges that the 2012 Agreement . . . 'was negotiated and/or executed\nby one or more CSU, SDSU, and/or SDSU[R]F officials or employees in their\nofficial capacities who, at the time of the contract's negotiating and/or\nexecution, had a financial interest in the contract in violation of Government\nCode section 1090 and other conflict-of-interest laws, including but not limited\nto [Hearn].' This statement is false. I negotiated the 2012 Agreement between\ninewsource and KPBS on behalf of inewsource. I did not negotiate on behalf\nof KPBS and had no role whatsoever—much less authority, decision-making\npower, or influence—on the KPBS side of the negotiations. Deanna Mackey,\nKPBS station manager, and Suzanne Marmion, director of news and editorial\nstrategy, negotiated on behalf of KPBS.\"\n\n       Hearn similarly refuted SDOG's allegations she received personal benefits from\n\nthe 2015 lease. Asserting \"Briggs controls SDOG as his alter ego,\" Hearn and\n\ninewsource sought an award of attorney fees \"jointly\" against SDOG and Briggs.8\n\n       The Trustees of the California State University (Trustees) and SDSURF\n\n(collectively University defendants) also filed an anti-SLAPP motion.9 The University\n\ndefendants accompanied their motion with documentary exhibits and declarations of Bob\n\nWolfson (SDSURF's executive director), Petronzio (KPBS associate general manager of\n\nbusiness and financial affairs), Mackey (KPBS station manager), and Hearn.\n\n\n\n8       SDOG has filed a request for judicial notice of a March 18, 2016 order, where the\ntrial court denied Defendants' request for an award of attorney fees jointly and severally\nagainst SDOG and Briggs. As explained post, it is unnecessary for us to decide the alter\nego issue on appeal, and we express no opinion on that issue. Accordingly, SDOG's\nrequest for judicial notice, filed June 1, 2016, is denied because the March 18, 2016 order\nis not relevant to any issue on appeal. (Scruby v. Vintage Grapevine, Inc. (1995) 37\nCal.App.4th 697, 701, fn.1 (Scruby).)\n\n9      The Trustees' motion states SDOG erroneously sued them as CSU and SDSU.\n                                            14\n\f       The University defendants asserted that SDOG's complaint was governed by the\n\nanti-SLAPP statute because the action is based on agreements for collaborative news\n\nreporting. They also asserted the public interest lawsuit exemption to the anti-SLAPP\n\nstatute in section 425.17, subdivision (b) did not apply because under section 426.17,\n\nsubdivision (d) and Ingels v. Westwood One Broadcasting Services, Inc. (2005) 129\n\nCal.App.4th 1050 (Ingels), news gathering and reporting are exceptions to the public\n\ninterest lawsuit exemption. On the merits, the University defendants asserted SDOG's\n\nclaims fail because Hearn did not make the 2012 Agreement or 2015 lease in her \"official\n\ncapacity\" as an SDSU adjunct professor, and she had no control or decision-making\n\nauthority for SDSU. They also asserted SDOG's trademark infringement claim failed on\n\nseveral alternative grounds.\n\n       SDOG filed opposition, primarily asserting its action was exempt from the anti-\n\nSLAPP statute under section 426.17, subdivision (b). SDOG also asserted its claims did\n\nnot arise from Defendants' protected activity, but rather Defendants' unlawful self-dealing\n\ncontracts.10\n\n       On the merits, relying on Hub City Solid Waste Services, Inc. v. City of Compton\n\n(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1114 (Hub City), SDOG asserted there was a triable issue\n\nwhether Hearn \"exerted a level of influence in a capacity that demands the public\n\n\n\n10      At the hearing, SDOG's attorney made the same point, asserting, \"The gravamen\nof this case in the complaint is we're claiming gift of public funds, breach of California\nstatute, violation of the conflict of interest law [Government Code section] 1090. That's\nthe gravamen. It has nothing to do whatsoever with their news gathering. That's the\nissue here.\"\n                                            15\n\ftrust . . . .\" Addressing the trademark claim, SDOG asserted Defendants had not\n\ndemonstrated SDSU received compensation from, or authorized, inewsource to use the\n\nSDSU trademark. SDOG supported its opposition with two declarations from its\n\nattorney, John McClendon. Those declarations contain no factual assertions other than an\n\nattempt to authenticate SDOG's verified complaint, the CSU Handbook on Contracts and\n\nProcurement, CSU's website section on CSU auxiliary organizations, a deposition\n\ntranscript in San Diegans for Open Government v. City of San Diego (Super. Ct. San\n\nDiego County, 2012, No. 37-2012-00088065), restated articles of incorporation for\n\nSDOG, and a statement attributed to Hearn in an Internet article about this case.\n\n       In reply, Defendants asserted SDOG failed to offer any admissible evidence to\n\nsupport its claims. At the hearing, inewsource's attorney made the same point, stating:\n\n\"[T]he evidence is undisputed from all the defendants and all the people\ninvolved in these transactions, Ms. Hearn had no position, power, decision-\nmaking ability or influence on the KPBS side of the coin. In fact, I think it\nreally borders on the ridiculous that a part-time professor of a . . . three-hour\nclass, up against huge corporations that have sophisticated boards of directors,\nofficers and attorneys have any real influence in this decision as a matter of\nlaw. The record is clear, there's no evidence of any influence or power-making\ndecision because none exists. She negotiates on behalf of inewsource[,] and\nthe university[] and KPBS had their team of people that negotiated for KPBS.\"\n\n       After taking the matter under submission, the court granted the anti-SLAPP\n\nmotions. The court determined SDOG's claims were \"based upon contracts to investigate\n\nand report on the news\" within the meaning of section 425.17, subdivision (d). The court\n\nalso determined the action \"arises from protected activity\" because \"the contracts at issue\n\nare inextricably related to news gathering and dissemination.\" Stating SDOG was\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\frequired to submit admissible evidence to establish it can prevail, the court ruled,\n\n\"Plaintiff did not meet its burden of showing by competent and admissible evidence that\n\nit has a probability of prevailing on the merits of its claim.\"\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n         I. THE COURT PROPERLY GRANTED THE ANTI-SLAPP MOTIONS\n\n       A. General Anti-SLAPP Principles\n\n       Section 425.16 provides in part, \"A cause of action against a person arising from\n\nany act of that person in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech under\n\nthe United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public\n\nissue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the\n\nplaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the\n\nclaim.\" (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)\n\n       \"'The purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute is to encourage participation in matters of\n\npublic significance and prevent meritless litigation designed to chill the exercise of First\n\nAmendment rights. [Citation.] The Legislature has declared that the statute must be\n\n\"construed broadly\" to that end.'\" (Hawran v. Hixson (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 256, 268;\n\n(§ 425.16, subd. (a).) \"The point of the anti-SLAPP statute is that you have a right not to\n\nbe dragged through the courts because you exercised your constitutional rights.\" (People\n\nex rel. Lockyer v. Brar (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1317.)\n\n       1. Threshold issue—is there an applicable exemption?\n\n       A threshold consideration in evaluating an anti-SLAPP motion is whether the\n\nplaintiff's lawsuit is exempt from the anti-SLAPP statute. (Navarro v. IHOP Properties,\n\n                                               17\n\fInc. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 834, 840; Save Westwood Village v. Luskin (2014) 233\n\nCal.App.4th 135, 143.) Relevant here, section 425.17, subdivision (b) provides the anti-\n\nSLAPP statute does not apply to \"any action brought solely in the public interest\" if (1)\n\n\"[t]he plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for\n\nthe general public\"; (2) the action, if successful, would \"enforce an important right\n\naffecting the public interest, and would confer a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or\n\nnonpecuniary, on the general public\"; and (3) \"[p]rivate enforcement is necessary and\n\nplaces a disproportionate financial burden on the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff's\n\nstake in the matter.\"\n\n       Section 425.17, subdivision (b) thus provides a \"safe harbor\" for a plaintiff from\n\nhaving to satisfy the anti-SLAPP statute. (See Holbrook v. City of Santa Monica (2006)\n\n144 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1249.) As an exception to the anti-SLAPP statute, it is to be\n\n\"narrowly interpreted.\" (Club Members for an Honest Election v. Sierra Club (2008) 45\n\nCal.4th 309, 319.)\n\n       Although section 425.17, subdivision (b) provides that certain public interest\n\nlawsuits are exempt from the anti-SLAPP statute, subdivisions (d)(1) and (d)(2) of that\n\nstatute provide exceptions to that exemption for the news media \"when the underlying act\n\nrelates to news gathering and reporting to the public . . . .\" (Major, supra, 134\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1496.) Thus, regardless of whether the plaintiff's action is a public\n\ninterest lawsuit under section 425.17, subdivision (b), if section 425.17, subdivision (d)\n\nalso applies, the defendant may bring an anti-SLAPP motion.\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\f       2. Protected activity\n\n       If the court determines the action is not exempt from the anti-SLAPP statute, it\n\nmust then address whether the complaint should be stricken under section 425.16.\n\nResolving that issue involves two steps. \"First, the defendant must establish that the\n\nchallenged claim arises from activity protected by section 425.16.\" (Baral, supra, 1\n\nCal.5th at p. 384.) The defendant meets this burden by showing the act underlying the\n\nplaintiff's cause of action fits one of the categories of protected speech enumerated in\n\nsection 425.16, subdivision (e). (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88\n\n(Navellier).)\n\n       Section 425.16, subdivision (e) sets forth four categories of protected activity.\n\nRelevant here, section 425.16, subdivision (e) defines protected activity to include\n\n\"any . . . conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of . . . free\n\nspeech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" This category\n\n\"extends the protection of the anti-SLAPP statute beyond actual instances of free speech\n\nto 'all conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the right of free speech in connection with\n\na public issue.'\" (Collier v. Harris (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 41, 51 (Collier), italics\n\nomitted.)\n\n       In determining whether a cause of action arises from protected activity, the court\n\ndisregards the label of the claim and instead examines the principal thrust or gravamen of\n\nthe plaintiff's cause of action. The court does this \"'\"by identifying '[t]he allegedly\n\nwrongful and injury-producing . . . conduct that provides the foundation for the claim.'\"'\"\n\n(Hunter, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1520.) \"In the anti-SLAPP context, the critical\n\n                                               19\n\fconsideration is whether the cause of action is based on the defendant's protected free\n\nspeech or petitioning activity.\" (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 89.) In making this\n\ndetermination, the court \"shall consider the pleadings, and supporting and opposing\n\naffidavits stating the facts upon which the liability . . . is based.\" (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(2).)\n\n          The anti-SLAPP statute's focus is not the form of the plaintiff's action, but rather\n\nthe defendant's activity that gives rise to his or her asserted liability, and whether that\n\nactivity constitutes protected speech. (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 92.) \"Nothing in\n\nthe statute . . . categorically excludes any particular type of action from its operation.\"\n\n(Ibid.)\n\n          Courts must be careful to distinguish allegations of conduct on which liability is\n\nbased from allegations of motives for such conduct. The court reviews the parties'\n\npleadings, declarations, and other supporting documents to determine what conduct is\n\nactually being challenged, not to determine whether the conduct is actionable. (Hunter,\n\nsupra, 221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1520.)\n\n          3. Prima facie case established by admissible evidence\n\n          \"If the defendant makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to\n\ndemonstrate the merit of the claim by establishing a probability of success.\" (Baral,\n\nsupra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 384.) The California Supreme Court has characterized this step as a\n\n\"'summary-judgment-like procedure.'\" (Ibid.) In analyzing whether the plaintiff has\n\ndemonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits, the court measures the plaintiff's\n\nshowing against a standard similar to that used in deciding a motion for nonsuit, directed\n\nverdict, or summary judgment. The court determines only whether the plaintiff has made\n\n                                                20\n\fa prima facie showing of facts that would support a judgment if proved at trial. The court\n\ndoes not weigh the plaintiff's evidence. However, the plaintiff may not rely solely on its\n\ncomplaint, even if verified; instead, its proof must be made upon competent admissible\n\nevidence. (Oviedo v. Windsor Twelve Properties, LLC (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 97, 109\n\n(Oviedo); Brodeur, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at p. 679.)\n\n       It is important to note the anti-SLAPP statute does not immunize or insulate\n\nDefendants from any liability for claims arising from protected activity. It only provides\n\na procedure for weeding out, at an early stage, such claims that are meritless. (Baral,\n\nsupra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 384; Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 89.)\n\n       B. The Standard of Review\n\n       We review an order granting or denying an anti-SLAPP motion de novo. (Oasis\n\nWest Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 820.)\n\n       C. The Media Exception to the Public Interest Exemption Applies Here\n\n       1. The parties' contentions\n\n       The threshold issue in this case is whether SDOG's complaint is exempt from the\n\nanti-SLAPP statute as a public interest lawsuit under section 425.17, subdivision (b).\n\n       SDOG asserts this exemption applies because (1) SDOG does not seek any direct\n\nrelief greater than or different from the relief sought by the general public, such as\n\nindividual money damages; (2) the action enforces an important public right prohibiting\n\nself-dealing; (3) private enforcement is necessary, with SDOG bearing a disproportionate\n\nburden because it has no possibility of recovering money in this case. Indeed,\n\nanticipating Defendants would bring anti-SLAPP motions, SDOG's complaint alleges,\n\n                                             21\n\f\"No matter how any portion of this pleading's allegations or prayer is construed, in no\n\nway does [SDOG] intend to assert a claim or seek relief that is inconsistent with\" the\n\npublic interest exemption in section 425.17, subdivision (b).11\n\n       Inewsource contends the public interest exemption in section 425.17, subdivision\n\n(b) does not apply, asserting, \"[I]t is clear this lawsuit is not brought in the public interest,\n\nbut rather to silence inewsource negative coverage of Briggs.\" Inewsource contends\n\n\"substantial evidence establishes\" SDOG is the \"alter ego\" of Briggs and his law firm.\n\nThe University defendants make the same arguments, asserting, \"[T]here is strong\n\nevidence that this lawsuit was brought to silence inewsource from publishing unflattering\n\nstores about attorney Cory Briggs.\"\n\n       The University defendants also contend that in determining whether SDOG's\n\ncomplaint is encompassed within section 425.17, subdivision (b), we should consider\n\nevidence on the merits, including declarations stating Hearn did not hold a\n\ndecisionmaking position at SDSU or with KPBS. The University defendants contend that\n\nif such evidence \"defeats\" the plaintiff's mere allegations in its complaint, \"the court\n\nshould find that the plaintiff has not met its burden\" to establish the public interest\n\nlawsuit exemption to the anti-SLAPP statute applies.\n\n       The University defendants acknowledge that in Tourgeman v. Nelson Kennard\n\n(2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1447, 1466 (Tourgeman), this court rejected a similar argument.\n\n\n\n11      We have no occasion in this case to consider or decide whether such an allegation\nis effective to bring a lawsuit within the public interest exemption in section 425.17,\nsubdivision (b), and we express no opinion on that issue.\n                                               22\n\fThere, we held the applicability of the public interest exemption is determined by\n\nexamining the allegations of the complaint alone. More recently, in San Diegans for\n\nOpen Government v. Har Construction, Inc. (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 611, 628 (Har\n\nConstruction), this court approvingly cited Tourgeman for the same rule, stating whether\n\nthe public interest exemption in section 425.17, subdivision (b) applies is based on the\n\nplaintiff's allegations and \"does not require the plaintiff to proffer affirmative evidence.\"\n\nAlthough the University defendants do not mention it, other courts have agreed with\n\nTourgeman on this point. (Cruz v. City of Culver City (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 239, 249;\n\nThe Inland Oversight Committee v. County of San Bernardino (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th\n\n671, 677.) Nevertheless, the University defendants ask us to overrule or distinguish this\n\nholding in Tourgeman.\n\n       In the reply brief, SDOG asserts \"there is absolutely no merit to [Defendants'] self-\n\nserving lie that [its] action was brought to retaliate against [inewsource] for writing\n\nstories about Mr. Briggs.\" SDOG states it would \"never retaliate against the media for\n\ncriticisms leveled against [itself] or its attorneys.\" SDOG denies it is Briggs's alter ego,\n\nstating there is \"no evidence\" to support it. SDOG also contends Tourgeman, supra, 222\n\nCal.App.4th 1447 was correctly decided and should be followed.\n\n\n\n       2. Issues unnecessary for decision\n\n       To resolve this appeal, it is unnecessary for us to consider many of the issues\n\nraised by the parties' contentions. If the media-defendant exception (§ 425.17, subd.\n\n(d)(1)) to the public interest exemption (§ 425.17, subd. (b)) applies, we need not\n\n                                              23\n\fdetermine whether SDOG's action is a public interest lawsuit under section 425.17,\n\nsubdivision (b) because, even if it were, defendants may still invoke the anti-SLAPP law.\n\n(Stutzman v. Armstrong (E.D.Cal. Sept. 10, 2013), No. 2:13-CV-00116-MCE-KJN) 2013\n\nU.S.Dist. Lexis 129204 at *39.)\n\n         Thus, we turn to section 425.17, subdivision (d) to determine if SDOG's action is\n\nexempt from the anti-SLAPP statute. As explained post, section 425.17, subdivision\n\n(d)(1) applies in this case and, therefore, we need not consider or decide whether (1)\n\nSDOG is Briggs's alter ego, (2) SDOG brought this lawsuit to retaliate, (3) Tourgeman\n\nshould be distinguished or overruled, and (4) any of the other issues the parties raise\n\nabout the applicability of the public interest exemption under section 425.17, subdivision\n\n(b).12\n\n         3. Analysis of the media-defendant exception in section 425.17, subdivision (d)\n\n         Under section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1), the exemption to the anti-SLAPP statute\n\nin subdivision (b) of that statute does not apply to the following:\n\n\"Any person enumerated in subdivision (b) of Section 2 of Article I of the\nCalifornia Constitution or Section 1070 of the Evidence Code, or any person\nengaged in the dissemination of ideas or expression in any book or academic\njournal, while engaged in the gathering, receiving, or processing of information\nfor communication to the public.\n\n\n\n\n12     Accordingly, we deny the request for judicial notice filed by inewsource on May\n13, 2016, requesting judicial notice of an e-mail purportedly sent from Briggs to Hearn,\nwhich inewsource asserted was relevant to show retaliation. Whether SDOG's action was\nbrought to retaliate is not relevant to any outcome determinative issue on appeal.\n(Scruby, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 701, fn.1.)\n                                             24\n\f       Persons \"enumerated\" in the cited portion of the California Constitution and\n\nEvidence Code are a \"publisher, editor, reporter, or other person connected with or\n\nemployed upon a newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, or by a press\n\nassociation or wire service, or any person who has been so connected or employed\" as\n\nwell as a \"radio or television news reporter or other person connected with or employed\n\nby a radio or television station, or any person who has been so connected or employed.\"\n\n(Cal. Const., art. I, § 2, subd. (b).)13\n\n       Section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) was intended to \"'exempt the news media and\n\nother media defendants . . . from [section 425.17, subdivision (b)] when the underlying\n\nact relates to news gathering and reporting to the public with respect to the news media or\n\nto activities involving the creation or dissemination of any work of a motion picture or\n\ntelevision studio.'\" (Major, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1496-1497.) In section 425.17,\n\nsubdivision (d), \"the Legislature checked the reach of the 'public interest'\" exemption by\n\npreserving the application of the anti-SLAPP law to actions that implicate important\n\nforms of protected speech. (Major, at p. 1497.)\n\n       The trial court determined section 425.17, subdivision (d) applies in this case to\n\nsubject SDOG's action to the anti-SLAPP statute. We agree. The Defendants, news\n\nmedia entities and Hearn, are persons enumerated in section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1).\n\nSDOG does not contend otherwise. Rather, SDOG asserts section 425.17, subdivision\n\n(d)(1) is inapplicable because Hearn's alleged \"illegal conduct did not occur 'while she\n\n\n13    Evidence Code section 1070, subdivisions (a) and (b) contain the same list of\npersons.\n                                            25\n\fwas engaged in' gathering, writing, or reporting the news\" as provided in the last clause\n\nof section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1).\n\n       The issue presented by SDOG's argument is whether the phrase \"engaged in the\n\ngathering, receiving, or processing of information for communication to the public\" in\n\nsection 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) includes noncommunicative conduct—i.e., the\n\nnegotiation and execution of the 2012 Agreement and 2015 lease—done in furtherance of\n\nthe news media's exercise of its free speech right to gather, receive, or process\n\ninformation for communication to the public.\n\n       \"'Our role in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as\n\nto effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citation.] Because the statutory language is\n\ngenerally the most reliable indicator of that intent, we look first at the words themselves,\n\ngiving them their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citation.] We do not, however, consider\n\nthe statutory language in isolation, but rather examine the entire substance of the statute\n\nin order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision, construing its words in\n\ncontext and harmonizing its various parts.\" (People v. Castillolopez (2016) 63 Cal.4th\n\n322, 329.)\n\n       \"Engaged in\" means \"to begin and carry on an enterprise or activity.\" (Merriam-\n\nWebster's Collegiate Dict. (11th ed. 2006) p. 413.) The contracts SDOG challenges\n\ndictate the process under which inewsource and KPBS jointly were to begin and carry on\n\nnewsgathering and reporting. For example, the 2012 Agreement requires inewsource to\n\ndeliver to KPBS 10 \"substantial data driven stories\" and to make its reporters \"available\n\nas reasonably requested\" by KPBS \"for broadcast coverage . . . .\" Similarly, the 2015\n\n                                              26\n\flease provides KPBS is leasing space to inewsource \"for the benefit of securing\n\ninvestigative news content for KPBS.\"\n\n       Therefore, SDOG's action here is encompassed within section 425.17, subdivision\n\n(d)(1) because it challenges \"any person enumerated in subdivision (b) of Section 2 of\n\nArticle I of the California Constitution . . . while engaged in the gathering, receiving, or\n\nprocessing of information or communication to the public.\"\n\n       This conclusion is not only compelled by the statute's text, but also finds\n\nadditional support in the statute's legislative history. The analysis for the senate bill\n\nenacted as section 425.17 states:\n\n\"Proposed subdivision (d) of newly added Section 425.17 would exempt the\nnews media and other media defendants (such as the motion picture industry)\nfrom the bill when the underlying act relates to news gathering and reporting\nto the public with respect to the news media . . . . For claims arising from these\nactivities, the current SLAPP motion would remain available to these\ndefendants.\" (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 515 (2003–\n2004 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 1, 2003, p. 14; Ingels, supra, 129\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1067-1068.) (Italics added.)\n\n       In the words of the senate bill analysis, the contracts SDOG challenges \"relate[]\"\n\nto news gathering and reporting. Indeed, news gathering and reporting is the\n\nfundamental essence of both contracts. For example, under the 2012 Agreement, KPBS\n\nexpressly agreed to provide inewsource with \"news gathering equipment\" and in\n\nexchange, inewsource agreed to provide, among other news reports, one \"Watchdog\n\nfeature per month\" and a \"[w]eekly data brief on a topic of interest to KPBS'[s]\n\naudience.\" Similarly, under the 2015 lease, KPBS leased space to inewsource \"for the\n\nbenefit of securing investigative news content for KPBS.\"\n\n\n                                              27\n\f       Nevertheless, SDOG asserts section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) does not apply\n\nbecause it is suing Hearn not for actually engaging in newsgathering, but instead for\n\nallegedly using her influence as an SDSU employee to negotiate a contract favorable for\n\ninewsource \"before any news-related function began.\" This argument fails, however,\n\nbecause it incorrectly analyzes the applicability of section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) by\n\nfocusing on Hearn's allegedly improper motive. Section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) is not\n\nconcerned with motive. There is nothing in the statute that conditions its application on\n\ngood or bad motive, or any motive at all. Rather, the statute is intended to protect news\n\nmedia engaged in newsgathering and reporting, conduct SDOG's lawsuit challenges by\n\nits attack on the inewsource-KPBS contracts.\n\n       In the reply brief, SDOG asserts that even if section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1)\n\notherwise would apply, we should \"reject its application because it exempts the press\n\nfrom being subject to laws of general applicability: the state's conflict-of-interest laws\n\nand prohibitions against the waste of public resources.\" In a related argument, SDOG\n\nasserts, \"to hold that the anti-SLAPP statute renders a public employee untouchable under\n\nconflict-of-interest laws just because she is also a member of the press\" violates \"equal\n\nprotection of the laws . . . .\" SDOG contends Defendants' interpretation of section\n\n425.17, subdivision (d) gives them \"immunity to violate\" conflict of interest laws while\n\nsubjecting nonmedia public employees to those same laws.\n\n       We reject these SDOG arguments because they betray a fundamental\n\nmisunderstanding of the anti-SLAPP statute. Determining the anti-SLAPP statute applies\n\nto a particular claim does not in any way exempt the defendant from being subject to laws\n\n                                             28\n\fof general applicability. The anti-SLAPP statute requires that in cases where the statute\n\napplies, the plaintiff is required to make a prima facie showing the claims alleged have\n\nminimal merit. If SDOG actually had evidence to support a prima facie against\n\ndefendants here, rather than just bare allegations in its complaint, the court would have\n\nbeen required to have denied the motions to strike. The anti-SLAPP statute \"poses no\n\nobstacle to suits that possess minimal merit.\" (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 93.)\n\nContrary to SDOG's assertions, determining section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) applies\n\ndoes not grant defendants any immunity whatsoever. (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p.\n\n93.) It simply means that SDOG is required to present admissible evidence to support its\n\nallegations, or have its case dismissed.\n\n       Because section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) excepts SDOG's lawsuit from the\n\nexemption to the anti-SLAPP statute provided in subdivision (b) of the same statute,\n\ndefendants were entitled to bring their anti-SLAPP motions. Accordingly, we now\n\nconsider whether the trial court correctly determined (1) the action is one arising from\n\nprotected activity under section 425.16; and (2) SDOG failed to sustain its burden of\n\nestablishing a prima facie case through admissible evidence.14\n\n       D. Protected Activity\n\n       In this step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, we determine whether SDOG's causes of\n\naction arise from the defendant's acts \"in furtherance of the person's right of . . . free\n\n\n14     The parties also dispute whether SDOG's action is governed by section 425.17,\nsubdivision (d)(2). However, having determined SDOG's action is within the ambit of\nsection 425.17, subdivision (d)(1), we need not determine whether it also falls within\nsubdivision (d)(2).\n                                              29\n\fspeech . . . in connection with a public issue.\" (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) Section 425.16,\n\nsubdivision (e) sets forth four categories of protected activity. Relevant here, subdivision\n\n(e)(4) of that statute defines protected activity to include not only speech itself, but also\n\n\"any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise\" of the constitutional right of free\n\nspeech \"in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" (§ 425.16, subd.\n\n(e).) This category is a \"'catch-all'\" that extends the anti-SLAPP statutes beyond actual\n\ninstances of free speech to \"'all conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the right of free\n\nspeech in connection with a public issue.'\" (Collier, supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 51,\n\nitalics omitted.) An act is in furtherance of the rights of free speech \"'\"if the act helps to\n\nadvance that right or assists in the exercise of that right.\"'\" (Ibid.)\n\n       There is a protected free speech right to report the news. (Lieberman v. KCOP\n\nTelevision, Inc. (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 156, 166 (Lieberman).) Reporting the news and\n\ncreating a television show both qualify as an exercise of free speech. (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1521.) Reporting the news requires the assistance of newsgathering\n\nand other related conduct and activity, which are acts undertaken in furtherance of the\n\nnews media's right to free speech. Such conduct is therefore is protected conduct under\n\nthe anti-SLAPP statute. (Lieberman, supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at p. 166.)\n\n       Moreover,\"'[a]n act is in furtherance of the right of free speech if the act helps to\n\nadvance that right or assists in the exercise of that right.'\" (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1521, quoting Tamkin v. CBS Broadcasting, Inc. (2011) 193\n\nCal.App.4th 133, 143 (Tamkin).) Accordingly, prepublication or preproduction acts such\n\nas investigating, newsgathering, and conducting interviews constitute conduct that\n\n                                               30\n\ffurthers the right of free speech and is protected activity. (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1521.)\n\n       For example, in Hunter, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th 1510, the appellate court found\n\nthe plaintiff's age and gender discrimination claims against a television station were\n\nbased on protected activity because the station's decision to hire younger and less\n\nqualified persons as weather anchors were acts in furtherance of the station's free speech\n\nrights. (Id. at p. 1521.) The news station's casting decision \"helped advance or assist\"\n\nfirst amendment expression, and therefore was a form of protected activity. (Ibid.;\n\nTamkin, supra, 193 Cal.App.4th at p. 143 [writer's use of plaintiffs' names in draft script\n\nof television show is protected activity because it helped to advance or assist in creating,\n\ncasting, and broadcasting a television show]; Lieberman, supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n164 [allegedly unlawful newsgathering technique was protected activity because it aided\n\nin the reporting of news].)15\n\n       Here, the trial court correctly determined SDOG's lawsuit arises from defendants'\n\nprotected activity. \"'In assessing whether a cause of action arises from protected activity,\n\n\"'we disregard the labeling of the claim [citation] and instead \"examine the principal\n\nthrust or gravamen of the plaintiff's cause of action . . .\" . . . We assess the principal thrust\n\n\n\n\n15     In a case none of the parties cite, Wilson v. Cable News Network, Inc. (2016) 6\nCal.App.5th 822, review granted March 1, 2017, S239686, in a 2-1 decision, the Second\nDistrict, Division One disagreed with Hunter, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th 1510 in the context\nof a case alleging employment discrimination and retaliation. By virtue of the grant of\nreview, Wilson has no precedential effect. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(e)(1).)\n                                               31\n\fby identifying \"[t]he allegedly wrongful and injury-producing conduct.\"'\"'\" (Collier,\n\nsupra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 50.)\n\n       The allegations in SDOG's lawsuit make clear the injury-producing conduct\n\nunderlying its claims consists of the contracts between inewsource and KPBS that govern\n\nthe process in which these defendants jointly engage in newsgathering and reporting\n\nnews to the public. For example, paragraph 5 of the complaint expressly states SDOG\n\n\"challenges two contracts,\" namely, the 2012 Agreement and the 2015 lease (which\n\nSDOG refers to as the \"2012 Agreement and the 2014 Lease.\" In the first cause of action,\n\nSDOG alleges the 2012 Agreement is \"void\" because, among other reasons, the\n\nUniversity defendants did not receive \"commensurate value\" under the 2012 Agreement.\n\nIn the second cause of action, SDOG alleges the subsequent lease \"is void and otherwise\n\nillegal,\" for similar reasons. The third cause of action, where SDOG realleges and\n\nincorporates by reference all of the allegations involving the 2012 Agreement and 2015\n\nlease is also based on that same contractual relationship among the defendants. In the\n\nfourth cause of action, SDOG again centers its allegations against the two contracts,\n\nasserting Hearn improperly \"used her position as a lecturer\" to secure approval of both\n\ncontracts. Thus, SDOG's lawsuit targets conduct (the KPBS-inewsource contracts) that\n\nadvances and assists the defendants in exercising their right to report the news, and\n\ntherefore is protected activity under section 426.16, subdivision (e). (Lieberman, supra,\n\n110 Cal.App.4th at p. 166.)\n\n       SDOG attempts to avoid the application of the anti-SLAPP statute by asserting the\n\n\"acts the [c]omplaint is [sic] based on\" are Defendants' negotiation and execution of\n\n                                            32\n\fagreements violating statutory and constitutional prohibitions against self-dealing and\n\ngifts of public funds. SDOG states, \"The offending action here is the procuring of a\n\ncontract by unlawful influence, and not any free-speech or petitioning activity.\" SDOG\n\nasserts, \"But for [Defendants'] contracting in violation [of law], this action would have\n\nnever been brought.\" SDOG repeats the same argument in its reply brief, asserting, \"The\n\n[c]omplaint is based on the following acts: the negotiation and execution of the\n\n[a]greements by [Defendants] in violation of [Government Code s]ections[] 1090 and\n\n8314 and the California Constitution.\"\n\n       SDOG's argument fails because it ignores California case law, which holds that in\n\ndetermining whether the defendant's acts are protected activity, the underlying conduct\n\nmust be separated from the defendant's purported unlawful motive. (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1520.) For example, in Hunter, plaintiff sued two Los Angeles\n\ntelevision stations, alleging they had committed gender discrimination against him in\n\ntheir hiring of a weather anchor position for the news program. (Id. at p. 1514.) On\n\nappeal, the court held the anti-SLAPP statute applied to plaintiff's claims because the\n\ninjury-producing conduct alleged in the complaint consisted of the defendant's decisions\n\nabout whom to hire as the on-air weather anchor for its newscasts, an act in furtherance\n\nof the right to free speech. (Hunter, at p. 1523.) The plaintiff in Hunter asserted the anti-\n\nSLAPP statute did not apply because \"the 'conduct' underlying his causes of action [was]\n\nnot [the defendant's] selection of its weather anchors, but rather [the] decision to utilize\n\ndiscriminatory criteria in making those selections.\" (Hunter, at pp. 1521-1522.) The\n\nHunter court rejected that argument because it \"confuses the conduct underlying Hunter's\n\n                                              33\n\fclaim—CBS's employment decisions—with the purportedly unlawful motive underlying\n\nthat conduct—employment discrimination.\" (Id. at p. 1522.) The Hunter court noted that\n\nthe California Supreme Court in Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at page 94 had \"clarified\n\nthat when assessing whether claims arise from protected activity, courts must distinguish\n\nbetween the acts underlying a plaintiff's causes of action and the '\"claimed illegitimacy of\n\n[those] acts[, which] is an issue . . . the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of\n\n[demonstrating] . . . a prima facie showing of the merits . . . .\"'\" (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1522.)\n\n       Applying Hunter, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th 1510 here, when determining whether\n\nSDOG's action arises from the Defendants' protected acts, we must separate the alleged\n\nunlawful motive (self-dealing) from the Defendants' conduct (entering into news\n\ngathering and news producing contracts). In Hunter, the court held the plaintiff's claims\n\nwere based on the defendant's decisions regarding its choice of a weather anchor, which\n\nwere acts in furtherance of its First Amendment rights, and not based on discrimination,\n\nwhich was the alleged motive for the conduct. (Hunter, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1523.) Likewise here, for purposes of applying the anti-SLAPP law, SDOG's claims are\n\nbased on Defendants' decisions in entering into contracts to partner news gathering, news\n\nreporting, and news production on television and other media—and not the alleged\n\nunlawful motive for such acts, self-dealing. Accordingly, SDOG's action is based on acts\n\n\n\n\n                                              34\n\fin furtherance of Defendants' free speech rights, and therefore protected activity under the\n\nanti-SLAPP statute.16 (§ 425.16, subd. (e).)\n\n       In a related argument, SDOG contends the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply\n\nbecause inewsource allegedly engaged in \"illegal activity\" in the subject contracts. In\n\nFlatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 317 (Flatley), the California Supreme Court held\n\nthat speech or petitioning activities that are illegal as a matter of law are not protected by\n\nthe anti-SLAPP statute.\n\n       SDOG's argument fails because conduct that would otherwise come within the\n\nscope of the anti-SLAPP statute does not lose its coverage simply because it is alleged to\n\nhave been unlawful or unethical. (Flatley, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 317.) The asserted\n\nprotected speech loses protection only if it is established through a defendant's\n\nconcession or by uncontroverted and conclusive evidence that the conduct is illegal as a\n\nmatter of law. (Collier, supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 55.) The mere fact the plaintiff\n\nalleges the defendant engaged in unlawful conduct does not cause the conduct to lose its\n\n\n\n\n16      SDOG contends Hunter, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th 1510 is distinguishable, asserting\nthe protected conduct there was \"not incidental, but is intrinsically tied to the delivery of\nmedia content\" whereas here, the contracts SDOG challenges were simply \"lease\nagreements, which are not likewise intrinsically tied to delivering the news, and only\nincidental to doing so.\" However, the record belies SDOG's argument. Under the 2012\nAgreement KPBS agreed to provide not just office space, but also news gathering\nequipment, studios and production areas, and also agreed to invite inewsource reporters\nto its weekly and daily news meeting and planning groups. In consideration, inewsource\nagreed to provide news stories and make its reporters available to KPBS \"for broadcast\ncoverage\" including feature stories and \"other programs.\"\n\n                                              35\n\fprotection under the anti-SLAPP statute. (Birkner v. Lam (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 275,\n\n285.) Here, the Defendants have not admitted the alleged conduct was illegal, and SDOG\n\npresented no evidence to establish that it was illegal as a matter of law. Accordingly, the\n\nillegal activity exception to the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply.17\n\n       E. Probable Merits Success\n\n       Having determined the allegations against Defendants arose from protected\n\nspeech, we next must determine whether SDOG demonstrated a probability of prevailing\n\non its claims. (Karnazes v. Ares (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 344, 354 (Karnazes).) To\n\ndefeat the anti-SLAPP motion, SDOG was required to submit \"competent and admissible\n\nevidence\" establishing a prima facie case. (Tuchscher Development Enterprises, Inc. v.\n\nSan Diego Unified Port Dist. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1219, 1236.)\n\n       Government Code section 1090 prohibits public officers from having a financial\n\ninterest in any contract \"made by them\" in their official capacity. (Har Construction,\n\nsupra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 616.) The Defendants submitted seven declarations from\n\nwitnesses having personal knowledge of relevant facts. For example, Hearn declared she\n\nhad \"no role whatsoever—much less authority, decision-making power, or influence on\n\nthe KPBS side of the negotiations.\" She was not \"paid at all\" by SDSU when the 2012\n\n\n\n17     Under section 425.16, subdivision (e), conduct in furtherance of the exercise of\nfree speech rights is protected under the anti-SLAPP statute only where it is \"in\nconnection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" As inewsource notes,\nSDOG does not address the public interest prong of section 425.16, subdivision (e) in its\nopening brief discussion of whether its claims arise out of protected activity.\nAccordingly, the issue is abandoned. (H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation v. City of\nEscondido (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1, 15.)\n                                            36\n\fAgreement was negotiated and signed. Hearn unequivocally stated the allegations of\n\nconflict of interest in SDOG's complaint were \"false\" as were SDOG's allegations she\n\nreceived personal benefits from the contracts. Hearn declared she has never been a\n\nuniversity department head, advisory board member, committee member, officer,\n\ndepartment chairperson, or a tenured or tenure-track professor. Wolfson declared Hearn\n\nhas never worked for or been employed by SDSURF, nor has she been on its\n\nmanagement team or its board of directors. He stated Hearn has never acted on behalf of\n\nSDSURF.\n\n      Citing Hub City, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th 1114, SDOG contends this evidence\n\nitself creates a triable issue that Defendants violated Government Code section 1090\n\nbecause even a person in an \"advisory position\" may potentially exert influence over\n\ncontracting decisions. We disagree because Hub City is factually distinguishable.\n\n      In Hub City, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th 1114, the City of Compton was awarded $22\n\nmillion against defendant Aloyan. Aloyan had been an independent contractor with the\n\ncity, in charge of its waste management. During his relationship with the city he\n\nnegotiated a contract with the city to privately provide waste management services.\n\nShortly after city council approval, he made campaign contributions to the city council\n\nmembers who voted to approve the contract. He additionally hired relatives of one of the\n\ncouncil members. Aloyan was the director of the city's in-house waste division, working\n\nalongside city employees, overseeing day-to-day operations of Compton's waste\n\nmanagement division, and taking responsibility for compliance with state-mandated\n\nrecycling and waste reduction efforts. (Id. at pp. 1118-1120.) Moreover, Aloyan\n\n                                           37\n\fsupervised city staff, negotiated contracts, and purchased equipment and real estate on\n\nbehalf of Compton. He was \"intricately involved in the city's waste management\n\ndecisions.\" (Id. at p. 1125.)\n\n       Unlike the facts in Hub City, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th 1114, here there was no\n\nadmissible evidence showing Hearn hired public employees, acted as director of any\n\npublic agency or department, or oversaw any public function. Unlike Hub City, there is\n\nno evidence in this record showing Hearn was involved in KPBS's decision to enter into\n\nthe 2012 Agreement and 2015 lease, much less \"intricately involved.\" (Id. at p. 1125.)\n\n       SDOG offered no admissible and competent evidence to support its allegations.\n\nThe only evidence SDOG offered was two declarations of its own attorney, John\n\nMcClendon. The first contains no factual assertions, other than an attempt to authenticate\n\n(1) SDOG's complaint, (2) the CSU Handbook on Contracts and Procurement, (3) CSU's\n\nwebsite section on the history of CSU auxiliary organizations, (4) a deposition transcript\n\nin another case involving SDOG, and (5) the restated articles of incorporation of SDOG.\n\n       Defendants objected to McClendon's declaration on numerous grounds, including\n\nlack of personal knowledge, lack of foundation, and hearsay.\n\n       The day before the hearing, McClendon filed a \"supplemental declaration\"\n\nattempting to authenticate one additional document—what purported to be an inewsource\n\narticle in which Hearn characterized SDOG's action as involving an \"office lease.\"\n\nMcClendon asserted Hearn had thus \"conced[ed]\" SDOG's action was unrelated to media\n\nnews gathering under section 425.17, subdivision (d).\n\n\n\n                                            38\n\f       McClendon's declarations do not establish a triable issue of fact on any material\n\nissue within the scope of SDOG's complaint. His declarations do not establish a\n\nfoundation based on personal knowledge for authenticating any of the documents\n\nattached, other than the complaint itself. (Tuchsher, supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1236;\n\nEvid. Code, § 702, subd. (a).)18 His declarations fail to establish a foundation for any\n\nexception to the hearsay rule. Even the complaint, albeit verified, avails SDOG nothing\n\non this issue. (Brodeur, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at p. 679.)19 This is because an\n\nassessment of the probability of prevailing looks to trial, and the evidence that would be\n\nadmissible to create triable factual issues at that time. (Evans v. Unkow (1995) 38\n\nCal.App.4th 1490, 1497.)\n\n       Because SDOG failed to offer any admissible evidence to establish a prima facie\n\ncase on any of its claims, the court correctly granted the anti-SLAPP motions. (See\n\nVergos v. McNeal (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1387, 1403 [anti-SLAPP granted where\n\nplaintiff \"failed to submit any admissible evidence\" that defendant did anything wrong];\n\n\n\n18     Evidence Code section 702, subdivision (a) provides in part: \"[T]he testimony of\na witness concerning a particular matter is inadmissible unless he has personal knowledge\nof the matter.\"\n\n19     Salma v. Capon (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1275, 1289-1290 states to the contrary.\nHowever, the First District's holding in Salma has not been followed by any other\npublished decision, and every other published case on this issue holds that the allegations\nof even a verified complaint cannot establish probability of success on the merits under\nthe anti-SLAPP statute. (See, e.g., Brodeur, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at p. 679; Oviedo,\nsupra, 212 Cal.App.4th at p. 109; Paiva v. Nichols (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1007, 1017;\nPaulus v. Bob Lynch Ford, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 659, 672-673.) For these reasons\nand those stated in the text, we disagree with Salma's holding on this point.\n\n                                            39\n\fKarnazes, supra, 244 Cal.App.4th at pp. 354-355 [anti-SLAPP granted where plaintiff\n\nfailed to offer any evidence and relied solely on her own complaint].) Having determined\n\nSDOG failed to sustain its burden of establishing a prima facie case, it is unnecessary to\n\nconsider any other reasons defendants assert for affirming the order.20\n\n                                       DISPOSITION\n\n       The order granting the anti-SLAPP motions is affirmed. Defendants and real\n\nparties in interest are entitled to costs incurred on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                NARES, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nHUFFMAN, Acting P.

On page 32, before the second full paragraph that begins \"The allegations in\n\nSDOG's lawsuit\" insert the following paragraphs:\n\n             Recently, in Park v. Board of Trustees of California State University\n             (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057 (Park), the California Supreme Court clarified\n             that \"[a] claim arises from protected activity when that activity\n             underlies or forms the basis for the claim.\" (Id. at p. 1062.) \"'[T]he\n\fdefendant's act underlying the plaintiff's cause of action must itself\nhave been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free\nspeech.'\" (Id. at p. 1063, italics omitted.) \"[T]he focus is on\ndetermining what 'the defendant's activity [is] that gives rise to his or\nher asserted liability—and whether that activity constitutes protected\nspeech or petitioning.'\" (Ibid.) Accordingly, \"'[t]he only means\nspecified in section 425.16 by which a moving defendant can satisfy\nthe [\"arising from\"] requirement is to demonstrate that the\ndefendant's conduct by which plaintiff claims to have been injured\nfalls within one of the four categories described in subdivision\n(e) . . . .'\" (Ibid., italics omitted.) \"[I]n ruling on an anti-SLAPP\nmotion, courts should consider the elements of the challenged claim\nand what actions by defendant supply those elements and\nconsequently form the basis for liability.\" (Ibid.)\n\nHere, SDOG's claim under Government Code section 1090 requires\nit to show Hearn was financially interested in a contract made by her\nin her official capacity as a state employee. (Gov. Code, § 1090,\nsubd. (a).) Moreover, in determining whether its claims are based on\nprotected activity, SDOG concedes its entire complaint is \"based on\"\nthe \"execution of agreements by Respondents.\" Thus, the specific\nelements of SDOG's claims depend on the existence of the 2012\nAgreement and 2015 lease. These contracts that SDOG challenges\nare not merely evidence of liability, nor are they merely a step\nleading to some different act for which liability is asserted. (See\nPark, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1060 [\"a claim may be struck only if the\nspeech or petitioning activity itself is the wrong complained of, and\nnot just evidence of liability or a step leading to some different act\nfor which liability is asserted\"].) Rather, SDOG's complaint alleges\nthese agreements are \"illegal[]\" and, therefore, asks the court to enter\njudgment declaring each of them to be \"void.\" SDOG could not\nhave omitted from its complaint allegations regarding the 2012\nAgreement and 2015 lease and still state the same claims.\n\nMoreover, SDOG's assertion that the challenged contracts are\nmerely a step leading to potential newsgathering and not in\nthemselves newsgathering is incorrect. The contracts dictate the\nway in which inewsource and KPBS gather and publish the news.\nThe contracts require inewsource to deliver to KPBS specific news\nstories and to make their reporters available to KPBS in exchange\nfor office space. Accordingly, because the protected activity—here,\ncontracts for newsgathering, news collaboration, and news reporting\nto the public—are in themselves elements of the challenged claims,\n\n                                   2\n\f          the trial court correctly determined SDOG's lawsuit arises from\n          defendants' protected activity. (See Park, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p.\n          1068.)\n\n       2. On page 32, at the start of the first sentence of the existing second full\n\nparagraph, insert the word \"Further,\" so the sentence now reads:\n\n          Further, the allegations in SDOG's lawsuit make clear the injury-\n          producing conduct underlying its claims consists of the contracts\n          between inewsource and KPBS that govern the process in which\n          these defendants jointly engage in newsgathering and reporting news\n          to the public.\n\n       3. On page 33, line 7, change the citation from \"section 426.16, subdivision (e)\" to\n\n\"section 425.16, subdivision (e).\"\n\n       4. On page 35, before the first full paragraph that begins \"In a related argument\"\n\ninsert the following new paragraphs:\n\n          Quoting Park, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1060, SDOG asserts \"'a claim\n          may be struck only if the speech or petitioning activity itself is the\n          wrong complained of, and not just evidence of liability or a step\n          leading to some different act for which liability is asserted.'\" SDOG\n          contends we must, therefore, \"segregate the negotiating and entering\n          into the Agreements from the subject of the Agreements.\" SDOG\n          argues the anti-SLAPP analysis would be the same regardless of the\n          content of the challenged contracts. SDOG asserts, \"As an example,\n          the Agreements at issue here would be equally outside the scope of\n          the anti-SLAPP statute if Ms. Hearn were a licensed building\n          contractor and had used her faculty position at SDSU to procure a\n          long-term construction contract between SDSU and her construction\n          company.\"\n\nSDOG's argument fails because in determining whether the challenged\ncontracts are protected under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(4), the fact these\ncontracts are for gathering and delivering news stories and not some other\npurpose matters. The Supreme Court's explanation in Park, supra, 2 Cal.5th\n1057 of the decision in Hunter, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> explains why. In\nHunter, the defendant television station argued that (1) the station itself\nengaged in speech on matters of public interest through its news and weather\n\n                                              3\n\fbroadcasts, and (2) the decision as to who should present that message was\nthus conduct in furtherance of the station's protected speech on matters of\npublic interest. (See discussion in Park, supra, at pp. 1071-1072 .) The instant\ncase is effectively indistinguishable: Inewsource is a news organization that\npublishes news stories of public interest, and its decision of whom to partner\nwith to deliver the news (i.e., KPBS, under the challenged contracts) is conduct\nin furtherance of its protected speech on matters of public interest. Under\nsection 425.16, subdivision (e)(4), protected activity includes \"any other\nconduct in furtherance of the exercise of the . . . constitutional right of free\nspeech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" SDOG\nis not seeking to void a contract to make widgets or to construct a building. It\nis seeking to void contracts that directly affect the content of news stories the\npublic receives. That protected content brings this case within section 425.16,\nsubdivision (e)(4).\n\nThe analysis might well be different if SDOG sought to void the hypothetical\nconstruction contract it posits, or any number of other hypothetical contracts\nthat do not involve newsgathering and reporting. However, this case, like\nHunter, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, involves protected newsgathering and\nnews reporting. Inewsource is not a construction company. It is in the news\nreporting business, and the contracts SDOG challenges shape the way\ninewsource and KPBS gather, produce, and report the news.\n\n       5. On page 36, footnote 17 is deleted and a new footnote 17 is inserted in its place\n\nso footnote 17 now reads:\n17\n   Under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(4), conduct in furtherance of the\nexercise of free speech rights is protected only where such conduct is \"in\nconnection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" In granting the\nmotions to strike, the trial court determined \"this action arises from protected\nactivity under [section] 425.16.\" On appeal, the trial court's order is presumed\ncorrect and \"'it is the appellant's burden to affirmatively demonstrate error.'\"\n(Ruelas v. Superior Court (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383.) \"'To demonstrate\nerror, [the] appellant must present meaningful legal analysis supported by\ncitations to authority and citations to facts in the record that support the claim\nof error.'\" (Multani v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1428</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1457.)\nHowever, as inewsource notes, SDOG does not address the public interest\nprong of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(4) in its opening brief discussion of\nwhether its claims arise from protected activity. Accordingly, the issue is\nforfeited. (H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation v.

A lawsuit filed primarily to chill the valid exercise of free speech is called\n\na SLAPP suit and, if without merit, such an action may be dismissed early under Code of\n\nCivil Procedure1 section 425.16 in what is commonly known as an anti-SLAPP motion.2\n\n       In this anti-SLAPP case, investigative newsource (inewsource), an independent,\n\nnonprofit journalism organization, entered into contracts with KPBS, San Diego's public\n\nradio and television station, to gather and produce news stories with and for KPBS, in\n\nexchange for the right to use KPBS offices, media equipment, and related news facilities.\n\nKPBS is a department of San Diego State University (SDSU), and inewsource and KPBS\n\nhave jointly created hundreds of news stories.\n\n       In February 2015 inewsource began publishing articles critical of attorney Cory\n\nBriggs. For example, one was entitled \"Cory Briggs' Land Deals Raise Ethical Legal\n\nQuestions\" and another was called \"San Diego Attorney's Environmental Lawsuits Could\n\nBe Tainted by Conflict of Interest.\"\n\n\n\n\n1      All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n2      \"'SLAPP' is an acronym for 'strategic lawsuit against public participation.'\" (Baral\nv. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 381, fn. 1 (Baral).)\n                                              2\n\f       After inewsource published about a dozen more critical stories about Briggs, San\n\nDiegans for Open Government (SDOG)—an entity inewsource reported is controlled by\n\nBriggs—sued inewsource, along with its founder, Loretta Hearn, and also SDSU,\n\nCalifornia State University (CSU), and San Diego State University Research Foundation\n\n(SDSURF).\n\n       The gist of SDOG's complaint is the contracts between KPBS and inewsource\n\nviolate statutory prohibitions on self-dealing involving public funds because Hearn was\n\nallegedly influencing both sides of the transaction—for SDSU as a faculty member, and\n\nfor inewsource as its executive director. SDOG also alleges inewsource and Hearn\n\nmisappropriated the names KPBS and SDSU.\n\n       Asserting SDOG's lawsuit is based on the exercise of their constitutionally\n\nprotected speech rights and lacked merit, Defendants3 brought anti-SLAPP motions. The\n\ncourt granted the motions.\n\n       SDOG appeals, contending the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply because (1) its\n\nlawsuit is a public interest lawsuit, exempt from the anti-SLAPP law under section\n\n425.17, subdivision (b); and (2) the exception to that exemption for media defendants\n\nunder section 425.17, subdivision (d) is inapplicable because its lawsuit has \"nothing to\n\ndo with stopping news reporting\" but is instead directed to stopping \"self-dealing by a\n\npublic employee.\"\n\n\n\n3     \"Defendants\" refers to the entities and persons SDOG named as defendants and\nrespondents, together with those named as defendants and real parties in interest, in their\ncomplaint.\n                                             3\n\f       Alternatively, SDOG asserts that if the anti-SLAPP statute applies, the order\n\nshould be reversed because (1) its lawsuit is not directed at protected activity; and (2)\n\neven if it is, SDOG established a probability of prevailing.\n\n       We affirm. Reporting news is protected speech. (Hunter v. CBS Broadcasting,\n\nInc. (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1521 (Hunter).) News stories addressing issues of\n\npublic interest do not arise out of thin air. They often require newsgathering using\n\noffices, internet access, studios, and production services. Providing office space and\n\nrelated newsgathering facilities in exchange for investigative news stories furthers\n\nprotected speech. SDOG's lawsuit is therefore squarely within the anti-SLAPP statute,\n\nwhich protects not only speech, but also \"conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the\n\nconstitutional right of . . . free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of\n\npublic interest.\" (§ 425.16, subd. (e), italics added.)\n\n       We reject SDOG's assertion that the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply because its\n\nlawsuit targets unlawful self-dealing, not protected speech. SDOG's argument\n\nimproperly conflates distinct issues of conduct and motive. In determining whether the\n\nanti-SLAPP statute applies, the appropriate focus is on the alleged injury-producing\n\nconduct (here, the KPBS-inewsource contracts), and not the defendant's alleged wrongful\n\nmotive for engaging in that conduct (here, alleged self-dealing). (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1521-1523.)\n\n       Moreover, SDOG's reliance on the public interest exemption to the anti-SLAPP\n\nstatute in section 425.17, subdivision (b) is unavailing. That exemption does not apply to\n\nactions such as this one against news media engaged in newsgathering conduct.\n\n                                               4\n\f(§ 425.17, subd.

SDOG's attempt to fill the evidentiary void by relying on\n\nallegations in its verified complaint is insufficient as a matter of law. (Brodeur v. Atlas\n\nEntertainment, Inc.

The News Media Parties\n\n       Hearn has been a professional journalist since 1974. In 2009 she founded\n\ninewsource, which creates investigative news stories on public issues.\n\n       KPBS is a media entity operating as a public service of SDSU. KPBS, with\n\nbroadcast facilities on the SDSU campus, delivers news and entertainment programming\n\nthrough television, radio, and digital media.\n\n       SDSURF is a nonprofit corporation and a separate legal entity from SDSU. For\n\nover 34 years, SDSURF has provided KPBS with financial accounting, tax reporting, and\n\nadministrative support.\n\n       In 2010 KPBS began publishing inewsource news stories. Reporters for these two\n\norganizations also began working together on stories of public interest.\n\n       B. The 2012 Agreement for Collaboration Between Inewsource and KPBS\n\n       In the fall of 2011, KPBS remodeled its newsroom and began a nightly news\n\ntelevision show. Hearn asked KPBS's station manager, Deanna Mackey, about moving\n\ninewsource into the remodeled KPBS newsroom because inewsource was looking for a\n\n                                                5\n\freliable audience for its investigative news. Hearn's proposal interested KPBS, which\n\nwas looking for more investigative news content.\n\n       In 2012 KPBS and inewsource entered into a contract under which KPBS agreed\n\nto provide inewsource newsroom space to allow inewsource reporters to work closely\n\nwith KPBS editors, reporters, and producers on collaborative work (the 2012\n\nAgreement).4 In exchange, inewsource agreed to give KPBS all of its news content for\n\ndistribution on radio, television, and the Internet. KPBS characterizes this relationship\n\nwith inewsource as a \"partnership\" that contemplates \"joint story telling.\"\n\n       Under the 2012 Agreement, KPBS agreed to provide inewsource with offices,\n\nfurniture, studios and production areas, telephone and internet connections, and news\n\ngathering equipment. KPBS also agreed to invite inewsource employees to daily news\n\nmeetings.\n\n       In exchange, inewsource agreed to provide KPBS with 10 \"substantial data driven\n\nstories\" during the term and one \"Watchdog feature per month,\" plus a \"[w]eekly data\n\nbrief on a topic of interest to KPBS' audience.\" Inewsource also agreed to provide\n\nreporters to KPBS and to provide KPBS access to its databases.\n\n       KPBS did not competitively bid the 2012 Agreement. Mackey, KPBS's station\n\nmanager who participated in drafting the 2012 Agreement, stated such a contract would\n\n\"never be subject to open bidding\" because \"content is qualitative\" and \"[p]artnerships\n\nbetween news organizations require trust . . . .\" Mackey stated KPBS \"only partners with\n\n\n4      The 2012 Agreement also states SDSURF is a party to that agreement and the\n\"contracting and fiscal agent for KPBS.\"\n                                             6\n\fnews organizations whose accuracy and content have proven to be trustworthy, such as\n\ninewsource.\" Vince Petronzio, associate general manager for business and financial\n\naffairs at KPBS, similarly stated that \"KPBS does not solicit open bids for content-based\n\ncontracts.\" He explained, \"In fact, because content is unique and qualitative, it would\n\nnever be subject to open bidding. . . . KPBS receives significant value from its\n\npartnership with inewsource because inewsource stories enhance the coverage that KPBS\n\ncan provide to its audience.\" He added, \"The partnership between KPBS and inewsource\n\nis definitely a value-for-value partnership.\"\n\n       In a declaration, Hearn asserted she negotiated the 2012 Agreement only on behalf\n\nof inewsource. Mackey and Suzanne Marmion, director of news and editorial strategy\n\nfor KPBS, negotiated the 2012 Agreement for KPBS. Neither Mackey nor Marmion has\n\nany financial interest in inewsource. In 2012, although Hearn occasionally volunteered\n\nas a guest lecturer for SDSU's school of journalism, she was not employed by SDSU and\n\nheld no executive or managerial role at SDSU.\n\n       Hearn's declaration states she has never been a KPBS board member or KPBS\n\nemployee and has \"never been in a position to influence [the KPBS] decision-making\n\nprocess or outcome in any way.\" She has never been a tenured or tenured-track SDSU\n\nprofessor, nor a department head, advisory board member, committee member, director,\n\nofficer, or department chairperson. Hearn has never been employed by SDSURF.\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f      C. The 2015 Extension and Lease\n\n      In 2015 inewsource and KPBS extended the 2012 Agreement (the 2015\n\nextension).5 They also entered into a new lease (2015 lease) under which KPBS leased\n\noffice space, conference rooms, studios, and production areas to inewsource for its\n\nreporters to use \"for the benefit of securing investigative news content for KPBS.\" Rent\n\nunder the 2015 lease was only one dollar; however, KPBS's station manager stated KPBS\n\nreceived \"significant value\" from this agreement because \"inewsource stories enhance the\n\ncoverage that KPBS can provide to its audience.\"\n\n      Hearn states she negotiated the 2015 extension and 2015 lease only on behalf of\n\ninewsource. Mackey and Marmion negotiated on behalf of KPBS. In 2015 Hearn was an\n\nadjunct professor of journalism at SDSU, teaching a three-unit class. SDSU paid Hearn\n\nfor her teaching time at its standard rate, and she received no other benefits from SDSU.\n\nHearn's declaration states she did not occupy any position of control or decision-making\n\nauthority with SDSU, SDSURF, or KPBS.\n\n      D. Nature of KPBS and Inewsource Collaboration\n\n      Inewsource and KPBS have jointly created and distributed more than 285 stories.\n\nIn most, inewsource reports the news, with input from KPBS editors and using KPBS\n\nvideographers. In other cases, KPBS reporters do the reporting and inewsource reporters\n\nedit. Occasionally, KPBS and inewsource collaborate to jointly report stories. In all\n\n\n\n\n5     SDSURF is also a party to the 2015 extension and lease agreement.\n\n                                            8\n\fthese situations, inewsource reporters work closely with KPBS editors and producers on\n\ncontent for KPBS.\n\n         E. Inewsource Articles About Briggs\n\n         In February 2015 inewsource began publishing uncomplimentary stories about\n\nBriggs. For example, one was entitled, \"San Diego Attorney's Environmental Lawsuits\n\nCould Be Tainted by Conflict of Interest.\" There, inewsource reported that Briggs's wife,\n\nSarichia Cacciatore, was listed as a project manager on a contract her employer had with\n\na government entity at the same time Briggs was suing that entity over environmental\n\nmatters. Briggs responded by stating on his website, \"My wife has a job, and I have a\n\njob. We don't talk about or share client confidences, and we take measures to avoid\n\ncreating any conflicts. There isn't anything illegal, unethical, or even unusual about this\n\neither.\"\n\n         The next day, in an article entitled, \"Document Links Briggs' Wife to His Law\n\nBusiness,\" inewsource reported that Cacciatore was listed as vice president of Briggs's\n\nlaw firm at the same time she worked on projects for government agencies Briggs was\n\nsuing.\n\n         On February 25, 2015, inewsource reprinted a letter Briggs posted on his website,\n\ndefending his conduct and stating, \"My clients aren't wealthy corporations. There are\n\npeople who have to fight and need a lawyer to represent them but often can't pay right\n\naway. I still fight for them.\"\n\n         On March 3, 2015, inewsource published three more articles about Briggs. These\n\nwere entitled \"Behind the Briggs Investigation,\" \"Helix: Briggs' Wife Did Not Disclose\n\n                                               9\n\fVP Role in His Law Firm,\" and \"Contested Transcript of San Diego Attorney Cory\n\nBriggs' Wife Released.\"\n\n       In these articles, inewsource reported that Cacciatore was employed by an\n\nenvironmental company that has done work for the City of San Diego (the City)—and\n\nthat Briggs sued the City regarding one of these projects. Inewsource reported, \"Records\n\nreleased Monday confirm Cory Briggs' wife was vice president of the Briggs Law\n\nCorp[oration] for the past 'twenty years,' which means she was an officer of the law firm\n\nhe used to sue the [City] at the same time she worked for a company on contract with the\n\ncity.\" Briggs responded, stating Cacciatore was vice president of his law corporation \"for\n\nreasons having nothing to do with running the firm and everything to do with things like\n\nestate planning . . . .\"\n\n       On March 10, 2015, inewsource reported that Briggs had sued the City about at\n\nleast one project Cacciatore worked on \"directly.\"\n\n       On March 30, 2015, Cacciatore and Briggs wrote to KPBS \"to give you notice of\n\nour demand, and to make that demand, for correction and retraction of false, inaccurate,\n\nand/or misleading reporting that may have been disseminated by KPBS . . . .\"\n\nInewsource and KPBS responded, stating it was \"unaware of any false fact\" in its story.\n\n       On April 7, 2015, inewsource reported that the environmental firm employing\n\nCacciatore had agreed to pay the City $143,000 to resolve the potential conflict of\n\ninterest claim. Earlier, Briggs wrote, \"'There isn't anything illegal, unethical or even\n\nunusual'\" about Cacciatore's employment and relationship to Briggs.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       One day later, inewsource published another article about Briggs, reporting\n\nCacciatore played a \"key role\" in an environmental review of a project near the Mexican\n\nborder. The article states Briggs filed a lawsuit alleging inadequacies in that project's\n\nanalysis of biological impacts, and Cacciatore—vice president of Briggs's law firm—was\n\nthe project's biologist. Inewsource also reported that Briggs had sued \"at least 15\n\ngovernment agencies\" that had contracted with the environmental firm employing\n\nCacciatore. The article states Briggs operates through nonprofit corporations, including\n\nSDOG, which are actually run by Briggs's associates, including his cousin. The article\n\nstates, \"Experts in legal ethics have told inewsource the connection between Briggs and\n\n[his wife] is a 'horrible' and 'problematic' conflict of interest.\" The article explains:\n\n\"Briggs' lawsuits against the [City] have cost taxpayers a significant amount of\nmoney over the years. But there was an undisclosed conflict of interest behind\nat least two of them, posing ethical and legal issues that recently resulted in a\ntaxpayer settlement.\"\n\n       On April 9, 2015, inewsource published Cacciatore's demand for correction and\n\nretraction, along with inewsource's lawyer's point-by-point response, refuting Briggs's\n\nassertions. The same day, SDOG filed the instant action. However, SDOG did not serve\n\nHearn with the lawsuit until June 2015.\n\n       F. Inewsource Publishes Another Article About Briggs\n\n       In the meantime, in late May 2015, inewsource published another\n\nuncomplimentary article about Briggs entitled \"Briggs-Associated Nonprofits Flout State,\n\nFederal Laws.\" There, inewsource reported, \"Briggs and his law firm have sued on\n\nbehalf of more than 30 charitable nonprofits, almost all of which he and his family helped\n\n\n                                              11\n\fcreate.\" Inewsource also reported that SDOG's officers have \"stated under oath that\n\nBriggs Law Corp[oration] oversees and pays for nearly every aspect of the group's\n\noperation\" and that SDOG \"does not have a penny to its name\":\n\n\"According to depositions and other court filings, Briggs and his law firm hold\nand maintain all the group's [SDOG's] corporate records, file and pay for its\nlawsuits, its annual registration fees and filings with the state and federal\ngovernments, control its Facebook and Twitter accounts; and collect all\nsettlements and judgment when the group prevails in court.\n\n\"[SDOG] doesn't have a penny to its name—nor has it recorded any revenue or\nexpenses with the federal or state agencies, according to government records.\"\n\n       Responding, SDOG's corporate secretary explained SDOG has no checking or\n\nsavings account because it wants to operate \"as simply and cleanly as possible.\" He also\n\nexplained that when SDOG loses a case, Briggs does not get reimbursed for his time or\n\nexpenses, and he is willing to \"risk substantial loss to fight the well-funded groups he\n\ntakes on for us.\"\n\n       G. SDOG's Complaint\n\n       The crux of SDOG's lawsuit here is its assertion the 2012 Agreement and 2015\n\nlease violate prohibitions on self-dealing and use of public funds for private benefit, and\n\ntherefore are void. The first cause of action is entitled, \"Illegality of 2012 Agreement.\"\n\nSDOG alleges that agreement violated Government Code section 1090 because Hearn\n\nwas then employed by SDSU and therefore had a financial interest on both sides of the\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\ftransaction.6 SDOG also alleges the 2012 Agreement should have been subject to a\n\ncompetitive bid process just like a construction contract or other public works project.\n\n       SDOG's second cause of action alleges the 2015 lease (referred to in the complaint\n\nas the 2014 lease) was negotiated or executed by Hearn in her official capacity as a\n\nSDSU employee while she had a conflicting financial interest as inewsource's executive\n\ndirector. SDOG alleges Hearn used her position as a SDSU lecturer to \"secure approval\"\n\nof the 2012 Agreement and 2015 lease for the benefit of inewsource, in violation of\n\nGovernment Code section 8314.7 SDOG also alleges inewsource infringed KPBS's and\n\nSDSU's trademarks by using them without permission and without paying compensation.\n\n       H. Anti-SLAPP Motions\n\n       Inewsource and Hearn filed an anti-SLAPP motion, accompanied by a request for\n\njudicial notice, 81 documentary exhibits, and declarations of Hearn, Norma Clark\n\n(SDSURF's associate executive director of facilities planning and management), Mackey,\n\nand Brad Racino, an inewsource reporter.\n\n       Inewsource and Hearn asserted SDOG's complaint attacked protected activity\n\nunder the anti-SLAPP statute; namely, the partnership between KPBS and inewsource for\n\n\n\n6      Government Code section 1090, subdivision (a) provides in part: \"Members of the\nLegislature, state, county, district, judicial district, and city officers or employees shall\nnot be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity, or by\nany body or board of which they are members.\"\n\n7      Government Code section 8314, subdivision (a) provides: \"It is unlawful for any\nelected state or local officer, including any state or local appointee, employee, or\nconsultant, to use or permit others to use public resources for a campaign activity, or\npersonal or other purposes which are not authorized by law.\"\n                                             13\n\fgathering and reporting news. They also presented admissible evidence showing SDOG's\n\nclaims lacked merit. For example, Hearn's declaration states:\n\n\"[SDOG] alleges that the 2012 Agreement . . . 'was negotiated and/or executed\nby one or more CSU, SDSU, and/or SDSU[R]F officials or employees in their\nofficial capacities who, at the time of the contract's negotiating and/or\nexecution, had a financial interest in the contract in violation of Government\nCode section 1090 and other conflict-of-interest laws, including but not limited\nto [Hearn].' This statement is false. I negotiated the 2012 Agreement between\ninewsource and KPBS on behalf of inewsource. I did not negotiate on behalf\nof KPBS and had no role whatsoever—much less authority, decision-making\npower, or influence—on the KPBS side of the negotiations. Deanna Mackey,\nKPBS station manager, and Suzanne Marmion, director of news and editorial\nstrategy, negotiated on behalf of KPBS.\"\n\n       Hearn similarly refuted SDOG's allegations she received personal benefits from\n\nthe 2015 lease. Asserting \"Briggs controls SDOG as his alter ego,\" Hearn and\n\ninewsource sought an award of attorney fees \"jointly\" against SDOG and Briggs.8\n\n       The Trustees of the California State University (Trustees) and SDSURF\n\n(collectively University defendants) also filed an anti-SLAPP motion.9 The University\n\ndefendants accompanied their motion with documentary exhibits and declarations of Bob\n\nWolfson (SDSURF's executive director), Petronzio (KPBS associate general manager of\n\nbusiness and financial affairs), Mackey (KPBS station manager), and Hearn.\n\n\n\n8       SDOG has filed a request for judicial notice of a March 18, 2016 order, where the\ntrial court denied Defendants' request for an award of attorney fees jointly and severally\nagainst SDOG and Briggs. As explained post, it is unnecessary for us to decide the alter\nego issue on appeal, and we express no opinion on that issue. Accordingly, SDOG's\nrequest for judicial notice, filed June 1, 2016, is denied because the March 18, 2016 order\nis not relevant to any issue on appeal. (Scruby v. Vintage Grapevine, Inc.

They also asserted SDOG's trademark infringement claim failed on\n\nseveral alternative grounds.\n\n       SDOG filed opposition, primarily asserting its action was exempt from the anti-\n\nSLAPP statute under section 426.17, subdivision (b).

Those declarations contain no factual assertions other than an\n\nattempt to authenticate SDOG's verified complaint, the CSU Handbook on Contracts and\n\nProcurement, CSU's website section on CSU auxiliary organizations, a deposition\n\ntranscript in San Diegans for Open Government v. City of San Diego (Super. Ct. San\n\nDiego County, 2012, No. 37-2012-00088065), restated articles of incorporation for\n\nSDOG, and a statement attributed to Hearn in an Internet article about this case.\n\n       In reply, Defendants asserted SDOG failed to offer any admissible evidence to\n\nsupport its claims. At the hearing, inewsource's attorney made the same point, stating:\n\n\"[T]he evidence is undisputed from all the defendants and all the people\ninvolved in these transactions, Ms. Hearn had no position, power, decision-\nmaking ability or influence on the KPBS side of the coin. In fact, I think it\nreally borders on the ridiculous that a part-time professor of a . . . three-hour\nclass, up against huge corporations that have sophisticated boards of directors,\nofficers and attorneys have any real influence in this decision as a matter of\nlaw. The record is clear, there's no evidence of any influence or power-making\ndecision because none exists. She negotiates on behalf of inewsource[,] and\nthe university[] and KPBS had their team of people that negotiated for KPBS.\"\n\n       After taking the matter under submission, the court granted the anti-SLAPP\n\nmotions. The court determined SDOG's claims were \"based upon contracts to investigate\n\nand report on the news\" within the meaning of section 425.17, subdivision (d). The court\n\nalso determined the action \"arises from protected activity\" because \"the contracts at issue\n\nare inextricably related to news gathering and dissemination.\" Stating SDOG was\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\frequired to submit admissible evidence to establish it can prevail, the court ruled,\n\n\"Plaintiff did not meet its burden of showing by competent and admissible evidence that\n\nit has a probability of prevailing on the merits of its claim.\"\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n         I.

Relevant here, section 425.17, subdivision (b) provides the anti-\n\nSLAPP statute does not apply to \"any action brought solely in the public interest\" if (1)\n\n\"[t]he plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for\n\nthe general public\"; (2) the action, if successful, would \"enforce an important right\n\naffecting the public interest, and would confer a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or\n\nnonpecuniary, on the general public\"; and (3) \"[p]rivate enforcement is necessary and\n\nplaces a disproportionate financial burden on the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff's\n\nstake in the matter.\"\n\n       Section 425.17, subdivision (b) thus provides a \"safe harbor\" for a plaintiff from\n\nhaving to satisfy the anti-SLAPP statute.

Thus, regardless of whether the plaintiff's action is a public\n\ninterest lawsuit under section 425.17, subdivision (b), if section 425.17, subdivision (d)\n\nalso applies, the defendant may bring an anti-SLAPP motion.\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\f       2. Protected activity\n\n       If the court determines the action is not exempt from the anti-SLAPP statute, it\n\nmust then address whether the complaint should be stricken under section 425.16.\n\nResolving that issue involves two steps. \"First, the defendant must establish that the\n\nchallenged claim arises from activity protected by section 425.16.\" (Baral, supra, 1\n\nCal.5th at p. 384.) The defendant meets this burden by showing the act underlying the\n\nplaintiff's cause of action fits one of the categories of protected speech enumerated in\n\nsection 425.16, subdivision (e).

The court does this \"'\"by identifying '[t]he allegedly\n\nwrongful and injury-producing . . . conduct that provides the foundation for the claim.'\"'\"\n\n(Hunter, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1520.) \"In the anti-SLAPP context, the critical\n\n                                               19\n\fconsideration is whether the cause of action is based on the defendant's protected free\n\nspeech or petitioning activity.\" (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 89.) In making this\n\ndetermination, the court \"shall consider the pleadings, and supporting and opposing\n\naffidavits stating the facts upon which the liability . . . is based.\" (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(2).)\n\n          The anti-SLAPP statute's focus is not the form of the plaintiff's action, but rather\n\nthe defendant's activity that gives rise to his or her asserted liability, and whether that\n\nactivity constitutes protected speech. (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 92.) \"Nothing in\n\nthe statute . . . categorically excludes any particular type of action from its operation.\"\n\n(Ibid.)\n\n          Courts must be careful to distinguish allegations of conduct on which liability is\n\nbased from allegations of motives for such conduct. The court reviews the parties'\n\npleadings, declarations, and other supporting documents to determine what conduct is\n\nactually being challenged, not to determine whether the conduct is actionable. (Hunter,\n\nsupra, 221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1520.)\n\n          3. Prima facie case established by admissible evidence\n\n          \"If the defendant makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to\n\ndemonstrate the merit of the claim by establishing a probability of success.\" (Baral,\n\nsupra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 384.) The California Supreme Court has characterized this step as a\n\n\"'summary-judgment-like procedure.'\" (Ibid.) In analyzing whether the plaintiff has\n\ndemonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits, the court measures the plaintiff's\n\nshowing against a standard similar to that used in deciding a motion for nonsuit, directed\n\nverdict, or summary judgment. The court determines only whether the plaintiff has made\n\n                                                20\n\fa prima facie showing of facts that would support a judgment if proved at trial. The court\n\ndoes not weigh the plaintiff's evidence. However, the plaintiff may not rely solely on its\n\ncomplaint, even if verified; instead, its proof must be made upon competent admissible\n\nevidence. (Oviedo v.

It only provides\n\na procedure for weeding out, at an early stage, such claims that are meritless. (Baral,\n\nsupra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 384; Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 89.)\n\n       B.

The Media Exception to the Public Interest Exemption Applies Here\n\n       1. The parties' contentions\n\n       The threshold issue in this case is whether SDOG's complaint is exempt from the\n\nanti-SLAPP statute as a public interest lawsuit under section 425.17, subdivision (b).\n\n       SDOG asserts this exemption applies because (1) SDOG does not seek any direct\n\nrelief greater than or different from the relief sought by the general public, such as\n\nindividual money damages; (2) the action enforces an important public right prohibiting\n\nself-dealing; (3) private enforcement is necessary, with SDOG bearing a disproportionate\n\nburden because it has no possibility of recovering money in this case. Indeed,\n\nanticipating Defendants would bring anti-SLAPP motions, SDOG's complaint alleges,\n\n                                             21\n\f\"No matter how any portion of this pleading's allegations or prayer is construed, in no\n\nway does [SDOG] intend to assert a claim or seek relief that is inconsistent with\" the\n\npublic interest exemption in section 425.17, subdivision (b).11\n\n       Inewsource contends the public interest exemption in section 425.17, subdivision\n\n(b) does not apply, asserting, \"[I]t is clear this lawsuit is not brought in the public interest,\n\nbut rather to silence inewsource negative coverage of Briggs.\" Inewsource contends\n\n\"substantial evidence establishes\" SDOG is the \"alter ego\" of Briggs and his law firm.\n\nThe University defendants make the same arguments, asserting, \"[T]here is strong\n\nevidence that this lawsuit was brought to silence inewsource from publishing unflattering\n\nstores about attorney Cory Briggs.\"\n\n       The University defendants also contend that in determining whether SDOG's\n\ncomplaint is encompassed within section 425.17, subdivision (b), we should consider\n\nevidence on the merits, including declarations stating Hearn did not hold a\n\ndecisionmaking position at SDSU or with KPBS. The University defendants contend that\n\nif such evidence \"defeats\" the plaintiff's mere allegations in its complaint, \"the court\n\nshould find that the plaintiff has not met its burden\" to establish the public interest\n\nlawsuit exemption to the anti-SLAPP statute applies.\n\n       The University defendants acknowledge that in Tourgeman v. Nelson Kennard\n\n(2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1447</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1466 (Tourgeman), this court rejected a similar argument.\n\n\n\n11      We have no occasion in this case to consider or decide whether such an allegation\nis effective to bring a lawsuit within the public interest exemption in section 425.17,\nsubdivision (b), and we express no opinion on that issue.\n                                               22\n\fThere, we held the applicability of the public interest exemption is determined by\n\nexamining the allegations of the complaint alone. More recently, in San Diegans for\n\nOpen Government v. Har Construction, Inc. (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 628 (Har\n\nConstruction), this court approvingly cited Tourgeman for the same rule, stating whether\n\nthe public interest exemption in section 425.17, subdivision (b) applies is based on the\n\nplaintiff's allegations and \"does not require the plaintiff to proffer affirmative evidence.\"\n\nAlthough the University defendants do not mention it, other courts have agreed with\n\nTourgeman on this point. (Cruz v. City of Culver City (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 239, 249;\n\nThe Inland Oversight Committee v.

Nevertheless, the University defendants ask us to overrule or distinguish this\n\nholding in Tourgeman.\n\n       In the reply brief, SDOG asserts \"there is absolutely no merit to [Defendants'] self-\n\nserving lie that [its] action was brought to retaliate against [inewsource] for writing\n\nstories about Mr. Briggs.\" SDOG states it would \"never retaliate against the media for\n\ncriticisms leveled against [itself] or its attorneys.\" SDOG denies it is Briggs's alter ego,\n\nstating there is \"no evidence\" to support it. SDOG also contends Tourgeman, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1447</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> was correctly decided and should be followed.\n\n\n\n       2. Issues unnecessary for decision\n\n       To resolve this appeal, it is unnecessary for us to consider many of the issues\n\nraised by the parties' contentions. If the media-defendant exception (§ 425.17, subd.\n\n(d)(1)) to the public interest exemption (§ 425.17, subd. (b)) applies, we need not\n\n                                              23\n\fdetermine whether SDOG's action is a public interest lawsuit under section 425.17,\n\nsubdivision (b) because, even if it were, defendants may still invoke the anti-SLAPP law.\n\n(Stutzman v. Armstrong (E.D.Cal. Sept. 10, 2013), No. 2:13-CV-00116-MCE-KJN) 2013\n\nU.S.Dist. Lexis 129204 at *39.)\n\n         Thus, we turn to section 425.17, subdivision (d) to determine if SDOG's action is\n\nexempt from the anti-SLAPP statute. As explained post, section 425.17, subdivision\n\n(d)(1) applies in this case and, therefore, we need not consider or decide whether (1)\n\nSDOG is Briggs's alter ego, (2) SDOG brought this lawsuit to retaliate, (3) Tourgeman\n\nshould be distinguished or overruled, and (4) any of the other issues the parties raise\n\nabout the applicability of the public interest exemption under section 425.17, subdivision\n\n(b).12\n\n         3. Analysis of the media-defendant exception in section 425.17, subdivision (d)\n\n         Under section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1), the exemption to the anti-SLAPP statute\n\nin subdivision (b) of that statute does not apply to the following:\n\n\"Any person enumerated in subdivision (b) of Section 2 of Article I of the\nCalifornia Constitution or Section 1070 of the Evidence Code, or any person\nengaged in the dissemination of ideas or expression in any book or academic\njournal, while engaged in the gathering, receiving, or processing of information\nfor communication to the public.\n\n\n\n\n12     Accordingly, we deny the request for judicial notice filed by inewsource on May\n13, 2016, requesting judicial notice of an e-mail purportedly sent from Briggs to Hearn,\nwhich inewsource asserted was relevant to show retaliation. Whether SDOG's action was\nbrought to retaliate is not relevant to any outcome determinative issue on appeal.\n(Scruby, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 701, fn.1.)\n                                             24\n\f       Persons \"enumerated\" in the cited portion of the California Constitution and\n\nEvidence Code are a \"publisher, editor, reporter, or other person connected with or\n\nemployed upon a newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, or by a press\n\nassociation or wire service, or any person who has been so connected or employed\" as\n\nwell as a \"radio or television news reporter or other person connected with or employed\n\nby a radio or television station, or any person who has been so connected or employed.\"\n\n(Cal. Const., art. I, § 2, subd. (b).)13\n\n       Section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) was intended to \"'exempt the news media and\n\nother media defendants . . . from [section 425.17, subdivision (b)] when the underlying\n\nact relates to news gathering and reporting to the public with respect to the news media or\n\nto activities involving the creation or dissemination of any work of a motion picture or\n\ntelevision studio.'\" (Major, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1496-1497.) In section 425.17,\n\nsubdivision (d), \"the Legislature checked the reach of the 'public interest'\" exemption by\n\npreserving the application of the anti-SLAPP law to actions that implicate important\n\nforms of protected speech. (Major, at p. 1497.)\n\n       The trial court determined section 425.17, subdivision (d) applies in this case to\n\nsubject SDOG's action to the anti-SLAPP statute. We agree. The Defendants, news\n\nmedia entities and Hearn, are persons enumerated in section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1).\n\nSDOG does not contend otherwise. Rather, SDOG asserts section 425.17, subdivision\n\n(d)(1) is inapplicable because Hearn's alleged \"illegal conduct did not occur 'while she\n\n\n13    Evidence Code section 1070, subdivisions (a) and (b) contain the same list of\npersons.\n                                            25\n\fwas engaged in' gathering, writing, or reporting the news\" as provided in the last clause\n\nof section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1).\n\n       The issue presented by SDOG's argument is whether the phrase \"engaged in the\n\ngathering, receiving, or processing of information for communication to the public\" in\n\nsection 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) includes noncommunicative conduct—i.e., the\n\nnegotiation and execution of the 2012 Agreement and 2015 lease—done in furtherance of\n\nthe news media's exercise of its free speech right to gather, receive, or process\n\ninformation for communication to the public.\n\n       \"'Our role in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as\n\nto effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citation.] Because the statutory language is\n\ngenerally the most reliable indicator of that intent, we look first at the words themselves,\n\ngiving them their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citation.] We do not, however, consider\n\nthe statutory language in isolation, but rather examine the entire substance of the statute\n\nin order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision, construing its words in\n\ncontext and harmonizing its various parts.\" (People v. Castillolopez (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">322</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 329.)\n\n       \"Engaged in\" means \"to begin and carry on an enterprise or activity.\" (Merriam-\n\nWebster's Collegiate Dict. (11th ed. 2006) p. 413.) The contracts SDOG challenges\n\ndictate the process under which inewsource and KPBS jointly were to begin and carry on\n\nnewsgathering and reporting. For example, the 2012 Agreement requires inewsource to\n\ndeliver to KPBS 10 \"substantial data driven stories\" and to make its reporters \"available\n\nas reasonably requested\" by KPBS \"for broadcast coverage . . . .\" Similarly, the 2015\n\n                                              26\n\flease provides KPBS is leasing space to inewsource \"for the benefit of securing\n\ninvestigative news content for KPBS.\"\n\n       Therefore, SDOG's action here is encompassed within section 425.17, subdivision\n\n(d)(1) because it challenges \"any person enumerated in subdivision (b) of Section 2 of\n\nArticle I of the California Constitution . . . while engaged in the gathering, receiving, or\n\nprocessing of information or communication to the public.\"\n\n       This conclusion is not only compelled by the statute's text, but also finds\n\nadditional support in the statute's legislative history. The analysis for the senate bill\n\nenacted as section 425.17 states:\n\n\"Proposed subdivision (d) of newly added Section 425.17 would exempt the\nnews media and other media defendants (such as the motion picture industry)\nfrom the bill when the underlying act relates to news gathering and reporting\nto the public with respect to the news media . . . . For claims arising from these\nactivities, the current SLAPP motion would remain available to these\ndefendants.\" (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 515 (2003–\n2004 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 1, 2003, p. 14; Ingels, supra, 129\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1067-1068.) (Italics added.)\n\n       In the words of the senate bill analysis, the contracts SDOG challenges \"relate[]\"\n\nto news gathering and reporting. Indeed, news gathering and reporting is the\n\nfundamental essence of both contracts. For example, under the 2012 Agreement, KPBS\n\nexpressly agreed to provide inewsource with \"news gathering equipment\" and in\n\nexchange, inewsource agreed to provide, among other news reports, one \"Watchdog\n\nfeature per month\" and a \"[w]eekly data brief on a topic of interest to KPBS'[s]\n\naudience.\" Similarly, under the 2015 lease, KPBS leased space to inewsource \"for the\n\nbenefit of securing investigative news content for KPBS.\"\n\n\n                                              27\n\f       Nevertheless, SDOG asserts section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) does not apply\n\nbecause it is suing Hearn not for actually engaging in newsgathering, but instead for\n\nallegedly using her influence as an SDSU employee to negotiate a contract favorable for\n\ninewsource \"before any news-related function began.\" This argument fails, however,\n\nbecause it incorrectly analyzes the applicability of section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) by\n\nfocusing on Hearn's allegedly improper motive. Section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) is not\n\nconcerned with motive. There is nothing in the statute that conditions its application on\n\ngood or bad motive, or any motive at all. Rather, the statute is intended to protect news\n\nmedia engaged in newsgathering and reporting, conduct SDOG's lawsuit challenges by\n\nits attack on the inewsource-KPBS contracts.\n\n       In the reply brief, SDOG asserts that even if section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1)\n\notherwise would apply, we should \"reject its application because it exempts the press\n\nfrom being subject to laws of general applicability: the state's conflict-of-interest laws\n\nand prohibitions against the waste of public resources.\" In a related argument, SDOG\n\nasserts, \"to hold that the anti-SLAPP statute renders a public employee untouchable under\n\nconflict-of-interest laws just because she is also a member of the press\" violates \"equal\n\nprotection of the laws . . . .\" SDOG contends Defendants' interpretation of section\n\n425.17, subdivision (d) gives them \"immunity to violate\" conflict of interest laws while\n\nsubjecting nonmedia public employees to those same laws.\n\n       We reject these SDOG arguments because they betray a fundamental\n\nmisunderstanding of the anti-SLAPP statute. Determining the anti-SLAPP statute applies\n\nto a particular claim does not in any way exempt the defendant from being subject to laws\n\n                                             28\n\fof general applicability. The anti-SLAPP statute requires that in cases where the statute\n\napplies, the plaintiff is required to make a prima facie showing the claims alleged have\n\nminimal merit. If SDOG actually had evidence to support a prima facie against\n\ndefendants here, rather than just bare allegations in its complaint, the court would have\n\nbeen required to have denied the motions to strike. The anti-SLAPP statute \"poses no\n\nobstacle to suits that possess minimal merit.\" (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 93.)\n\nContrary to SDOG's assertions, determining section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) applies\n\ndoes not grant defendants any immunity whatsoever. (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p.\n\n93.) It simply means that SDOG is required to present admissible evidence to support its\n\nallegations, or have its case dismissed.\n\n       Because section 425.17, subdivision (d)(1) excepts SDOG's lawsuit from the\n\nexemption to the anti-SLAPP statute provided in subdivision (b) of the same statute,\n\ndefendants were entitled to bring their anti-SLAPP motions. Accordingly, we now\n\nconsider whether the trial court correctly determined (1) the action is one arising from\n\nprotected activity under section 425.16; and (2) SDOG failed to sustain its burden of\n\nestablishing a prima facie case through admissible evidence.14\n\n       D. Protected Activity\n\n       In this step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, we determine whether SDOG's causes of\n\naction arise from the defendant's acts \"in furtherance of the person's right of . . . free\n\n\n14     The parties also dispute whether SDOG's action is governed by section 425.17,\nsubdivision (d)(2). However, having determined SDOG's action is within the ambit of\nsection 425.17, subdivision (d)(1), we need not determine whether it also falls within\nsubdivision (d)(2).\n                                              29\n\fspeech . . . in connection with a public issue.\" (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) Section 425.16,\n\nsubdivision (e) sets forth four categories of protected activity. Relevant here, subdivision\n\n(e)(4) of that statute defines protected activity to include not only speech itself, but also\n\n\"any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise\" of the constitutional right of free\n\nspeech \"in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" (§ 425.16, subd.\n\n(e).) This category is a \"'catch-all'\" that extends the anti-SLAPP statutes beyond actual\n\ninstances of free speech to \"'all conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the right of free\n\nspeech in connection with a public issue.'\" (Collier, supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 51,\n\nitalics omitted.) An act is in furtherance of the rights of free speech \"'\"if the act helps to\n\nadvance that right or assists in the exercise of that right.\"'\" (Ibid.)\n\n       There is a protected free speech right to report the news. (Lieberman v. KCOP\n\nTelevision, Inc. (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166 (Lieberman).) Reporting the news and\n\ncreating a television show both qualify as an exercise of free speech. (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1521.) Reporting the news requires the assistance of newsgathering\n\nand other related conduct and activity, which are acts undertaken in furtherance of the\n\nnews media's right to free speech. Such conduct is therefore is protected conduct under\n\nthe anti-SLAPP statute. (Lieberman, supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at p. 166.)\n\n       Moreover,\"'[a]n act is in furtherance of the right of free speech if the act helps to\n\nadvance that right or assists in the exercise of that right.'\" (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1521, quoting Tamkin v. CBS Broadcasting, Inc. (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143 (Tamkin).) Accordingly, prepublication or preproduction acts such\n\nas investigating, newsgathering, and conducting interviews constitute conduct that\n\n                                               30\n\ffurthers the right of free speech and is protected activity. (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1521.)\n\n       For example, in Hunter, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the appellate court found\n\nthe plaintiff's age and gender discrimination claims against a television station were\n\nbased on protected activity because the station's decision to hire younger and less\n\nqualified persons as weather anchors were acts in furtherance of the station's free speech\n\nrights. (Id. at p. 1521.) The news station's casting decision \"helped advance or assist\"\n\nfirst amendment expression, and therefore was a form of protected activity. (Ibid.;\n\nTamkin, supra, 193 Cal.App.4th at p. 143 [writer's use of plaintiffs' names in draft script\n\nof television show is protected activity because it helped to advance or assist in creating,\n\ncasting, and broadcasting a television show]; Lieberman, supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n164 [allegedly unlawful newsgathering technique was protected activity because it aided\n\nin the reporting of news].)15\n\n       Here, the trial court correctly determined SDOG's lawsuit arises from defendants'\n\nprotected activity. \"'In assessing whether a cause of action arises from protected activity,\n\n\"'we disregard the labeling of the claim [citation] and instead \"examine the principal\n\nthrust or gravamen of the plaintiff's cause of action . . .\" . . .

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> in the context\nof a case alleging employment discrimination and retaliation. By virtue of the grant of\nreview, Wilson has no precedential effect. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(e)(1).)\n                                               31\n\fby identifying \"[t]he allegedly wrongful and injury-producing conduct.\"'\"'\" (Collier,\n\nsupra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 50.)\n\n       The allegations in SDOG's lawsuit make clear the injury-producing conduct\n\nunderlying its claims consists of the contracts between inewsource and KPBS that govern\n\nthe process in which these defendants jointly engage in newsgathering and reporting\n\nnews to the public. For example, paragraph 5 of the complaint expressly states SDOG\n\n\"challenges two contracts,\" namely, the 2012 Agreement and the 2015 lease (which\n\nSDOG refers to as the \"2012 Agreement and the 2014 Lease.\" In the first cause of action,\n\nSDOG alleges the 2012 Agreement is \"void\" because, among other reasons, the\n\nUniversity defendants did not receive \"commensurate value\" under the 2012 Agreement.\n\nIn the second cause of action, SDOG alleges the subsequent lease \"is void and otherwise\n\nillegal,\" for similar reasons. The third cause of action, where SDOG realleges and\n\nincorporates by reference all of the allegations involving the 2012 Agreement and 2015\n\nlease is also based on that same contractual relationship among the defendants. In the\n\nfourth cause of action, SDOG again centers its allegations against the two contracts,\n\nasserting Hearn improperly \"used her position as a lecturer\" to secure approval of both\n\ncontracts. Thus, SDOG's lawsuit targets conduct (the KPBS-inewsource contracts) that\n\nadvances and assists the defendants in exercising their right to report the news, and\n\ntherefore is protected activity under section 426.16, subdivision (e). (Lieberman, supra,\n\n110 Cal.App.4th at p. 166.)\n\n       SDOG attempts to avoid the application of the anti-SLAPP statute by asserting the\n\n\"acts the [c]omplaint is [sic] based on\" are Defendants' negotiation and execution of\n\n                                            32\n\fagreements violating statutory and constitutional prohibitions against self-dealing and\n\ngifts of public funds. SDOG states, \"The offending action here is the procuring of a\n\ncontract by unlawful influence, and not any free-speech or petitioning activity.\" SDOG\n\nasserts, \"But for [Defendants'] contracting in violation [of law], this action would have\n\nnever been brought.\" SDOG repeats the same argument in its reply brief, asserting, \"The\n\n[c]omplaint is based on the following acts: the negotiation and execution of the\n\n[a]greements by [Defendants] in violation of [Government Code s]ections[] 1090 and\n\n8314 and the California Constitution.\"\n\n       SDOG's argument fails because it ignores California case law, which holds that in\n\ndetermining whether the defendant's acts are protected activity, the underlying conduct\n\nmust be separated from the defendant's purported unlawful motive. (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1520.) For example, in Hunter, plaintiff sued two Los Angeles\n\ntelevision stations, alleging they had committed gender discrimination against him in\n\ntheir hiring of a weather anchor position for the news program. (Id. at p. 1514.) On\n\nappeal, the court held the anti-SLAPP statute applied to plaintiff's claims because the\n\ninjury-producing conduct alleged in the complaint consisted of the defendant's decisions\n\nabout whom to hire as the on-air weather anchor for its newscasts, an act in furtherance\n\nof the right to free speech. (Hunter, at p. 1523.) The plaintiff in Hunter asserted the anti-\n\nSLAPP statute did not apply because \"the 'conduct' underlying his causes of action [was]\n\nnot [the defendant's] selection of its weather anchors, but rather [the] decision to utilize\n\ndiscriminatory criteria in making those selections.\" (Hunter, at pp. 1521-1522.) The\n\nHunter court rejected that argument because it \"confuses the conduct underlying Hunter's\n\n                                              33\n\fclaim—CBS's employment decisions—with the purportedly unlawful motive underlying\n\nthat conduct—employment discrimination.\" (Id. at p. 1522.) The Hunter court noted that\n\nthe California Supreme Court in Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at page 94 had \"clarified\n\nthat when assessing whether claims arise from protected activity, courts must distinguish\n\nbetween the acts underlying a plaintiff's causes of action and the '\"claimed illegitimacy of\n\n[those] acts[, which] is an issue . . . the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of\n\n[demonstrating] . . . a prima facie showing of the merits . . . .\"'\" (Hunter, supra, 221\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1522.)\n\n       Applying Hunter, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> here, when determining whether\n\nSDOG's action arises from the Defendants' protected acts, we must separate the alleged\n\nunlawful motive (self-dealing) from the Defendants' conduct (entering into news\n\ngathering and news producing contracts). In Hunter, the court held the plaintiff's claims\n\nwere based on the defendant's decisions regarding its choice of a weather anchor, which\n\nwere acts in furtherance of its First Amendment rights, and not based on discrimination,\n\nwhich was the alleged motive for the conduct. (Hunter, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1523.) Likewise here, for purposes of applying the anti-SLAPP law, SDOG's claims are\n\nbased on Defendants' decisions in entering into contracts to partner news gathering, news\n\nreporting, and news production on television and other media—and not the alleged\n\nunlawful motive for such acts, self-dealing. Accordingly, SDOG's action is based on acts\n\n\n\n\n                                              34\n\fin furtherance of Defendants' free speech rights, and therefore protected activity under the\n\nanti-SLAPP statute.16 (§ 425.16, subd. (e).)\n\n       In a related argument, SDOG contends the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply\n\nbecause inewsource allegedly engaged in \"illegal activity\" in the subject contracts. In\n\nFlatley v. Mauro (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600567\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600567/flatley-v-mauro/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 317 (Flatley), the California Supreme Court held\n\nthat speech or petitioning activities that are illegal as a matter of law are not protected by\n\nthe anti-SLAPP statute.\n\n       SDOG's argument fails because conduct that would otherwise come within the\n\nscope of the anti-SLAPP statute does not lose its coverage simply because it is alleged to\n\nhave been unlawful or unethical. (Flatley, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 317.) The asserted\n\nprotected speech loses protection only if it is established through a defendant's\n\nconcession or by uncontroverted and conclusive evidence that the conduct is illegal as a\n\nmatter of law. (Collier, supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 55.) The mere fact the plaintiff\n\nalleges the defendant engaged in unlawful conduct does not cause the conduct to lose its\n\n\n\n\n16      SDOG contends Hunter, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> is distinguishable, asserting\nthe protected conduct there was \"not incidental, but is intrinsically tied to the delivery of\nmedia content\" whereas here, the contracts SDOG challenges were simply \"lease\nagreements, which are not likewise intrinsically tied to delivering the news, and only\nincidental to doing so.\" However, the record belies SDOG's argument. Under the 2012\nAgreement KPBS agreed to provide not just office space, but also news gathering\nequipment, studios and production areas, and also agreed to invite inewsource reporters\nto its weekly and daily news meeting and planning groups. In consideration, inewsource\nagreed to provide news stories and make its reporters available to KPBS \"for broadcast\ncoverage\" including feature stories and \"other programs.\"\n\n                                              35\n\fprotection under the anti-SLAPP statute. (Birkner v. Lam (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n285.) Here, the Defendants have not admitted the alleged conduct was illegal, and SDOG\n\npresented no evidence to establish that it was illegal as a matter of law. Accordingly, the\n\nillegal activity exception to the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply.17\n\n       E. Probable Merits Success\n\n       Having determined the allegations against Defendants arose from protected\n\nspeech, we next must determine whether SDOG demonstrated a probability of prevailing\n\non its claims. (Karnazes v. Ares (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354 (Karnazes).) To\n\ndefeat the anti-SLAPP motion, SDOG was required to submit \"competent and admissible\n\nevidence\" establishing a prima facie case. (Tuchscher Development Enterprises, Inc. v.\n\nSan Diego Unified Port Dist. (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1219</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1236.)\n\n       Government Code section 1090 prohibits public officers from having a financial\n\ninterest in any contract \"made by them\" in their official capacity. (Har Construction,\n\nsupra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 616.) The Defendants submitted seven declarations from\n\nwitnesses having personal knowledge of relevant facts. For example, Hearn declared she\n\nhad \"no role whatsoever—much less authority, decision-making power, or influence on\n\nthe KPBS side of the negotiations.\" She was not \"paid at all\" by SDSU when the 2012\n\n\n\n17     Under section 425.16, subdivision (e), conduct in furtherance of the exercise of\nfree speech rights is protected under the anti-SLAPP statute only where it is \"in\nconnection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" As inewsource notes,\nSDOG does not address the public interest prong of section 425.16, subdivision (e) in its\nopening brief discussion of whether its claims arise out of protected activity.\nAccordingly, the issue is abandoned. (H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation v. City of\nEscondido (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Hearn unequivocally stated the allegations of\n\nconflict of interest in SDOG's complaint were \"false\" as were SDOG's allegations she\n\nreceived personal benefits from the contracts. Hearn declared she has never been a\n\nuniversity department head, advisory board member, committee member, officer,\n\ndepartment chairperson, or a tenured or tenure-track professor. Wolfson declared Hearn\n\nhas never worked for or been employed by SDSURF, nor has she been on its\n\nmanagement team or its board of directors. He stated Hearn has never acted on behalf of\n\nSDSURF.\n\n      Citing Hub City, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Aloyan had been an independent contractor with the\n\ncity, in charge of its waste management. During his relationship with the city he\n\nnegotiated a contract with the city to privately provide waste management services.\n\nShortly after city council approval, he made campaign contributions to the city council\n\nmembers who voted to approve the contract. He additionally hired relatives of one of the\n\ncouncil members. Aloyan was the director of the city's in-house waste division, working\n\nalongside city employees, overseeing day-to-day operations of Compton's waste\n\nmanagement division, and taking responsibility for compliance with state-mandated\n\nrecycling and waste reduction efforts. (Id. at pp. 1118-1120.) Moreover, Aloyan\n\n                                           37\n\fsupervised city staff, negotiated contracts, and purchased equipment and real estate on\n\nbehalf of Compton. He was \"intricately involved in the city's waste management\n\ndecisions.\" (Id. at p. 1125.)\n\n       Unlike the facts in Hub City, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Unlike Hub City, there is\n\nno evidence in this record showing Hearn was involved in KPBS's decision to enter into\n\nthe 2012 Agreement and 2015 lease, much less \"intricately involved.\" (Id. at p. 1125.)\n\n       SDOG offered no admissible and competent evidence to support its allegations.\n\nThe only evidence SDOG offered was two declarations of its own attorney, John\n\nMcClendon. The first contains no factual assertions, other than an attempt to authenticate\n\n(1) SDOG's complaint, (2) the CSU Handbook on Contracts and Procurement, (3) CSU's\n\nwebsite section on the history of CSU auxiliary organizations, (4) a deposition transcript\n\nin another case involving SDOG, and (5) the restated articles of incorporation of SDOG.\n\n       Defendants objected to McClendon's declaration on numerous grounds, including\n\nlack of personal knowledge, lack of foundation, and hearsay.\n\n       The day before the hearing, McClendon filed a \"supplemental declaration\"\n\nattempting to authenticate one additional document—what purported to be an inewsource\n\narticle in which Hearn characterized SDOG's action as involving an \"office lease.\"\n\nMcClendon asserted Hearn had thus \"conced[ed]\" SDOG's action was unrelated to media\n\nnews gathering under section 425.17, subdivision (d).\n\n\n\n                                            38\n\f       McClendon's declarations do not establish a triable issue of fact on any material\n\nissue within the scope of SDOG's complaint. His declarations do not establish a\n\nfoundation based on personal knowledge for authenticating any of the documents\n\nattached, other than the complaint itself. (Tuchsher, supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1236;\n\nEvid. Code, § 702, subd. (a).)18 His declarations fail to establish a foundation for any\n\nexception to the hearsay rule. Even the complaint, albeit verified, avails SDOG nothing\n\non this issue. (Brodeur, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at p. 679.)19 This is because an\n\nassessment of the probability of prevailing looks to trial, and the evidence that would be\n\nadmissible to create triable factual issues at that time.

For these reasons\nand those stated in the text, we disagree with Salma's holding on this point.\n\n                                            39\n\fKarnazes, supra, 244 Cal.App.4th at pp. 354-355 [anti-SLAPP granted where plaintiff\n\nfailed to offer any evidence and relied solely on her own complaint].) Having determined\n\nSDOG failed to sustain its burden of establishing a prima facie case, it is unnecessary to\n\nconsider any other reasons defendants assert for affirming the order.20\n\n                                       DISPOSITION\n\n       The order granting the anti-SLAPP motions is affirmed. Defendants and real\n\nparties in interest are entitled to costs incurred on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                NARES, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nHUFFMAN, Acting P. J.\n\n\n\nDATO, J.\n\n\n\n\n20     For example, inewsource contends SDOG lacks standing to assert certain claims.\nFor this reason, we deny SDOG's request for judicial notice filed February 23, 2016,\nrequesting this court to take judicial notice on the issue of standing.\n                                              40\n\f</pre>",
