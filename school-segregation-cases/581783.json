This appeal requires us to address\n\nthe constitutionality of several Maine election laws governing,\n\ninter    alia,     the    registration     of       political    action       committees\n\n(\"PACs\") and the disclosure and reporting of information about\n\nexpenditures       made    for    election-related          advocacy.1         Appellant\n\nNational Organization for Marriage (\"NOM\"), a New Jersey-based\n\nnonprofit    corporation         organized     for    the     purpose    of   providing\n\n\"organized opposition to same-sex marriage in state legislatures,\"\n\ncontends    that    Maine's       laws   are    unconstitutionally            vague   and\n\noverbroad.       Claiming a chill of its First Amendment-protected\n\nadvocacy efforts in Maine, NOM brought a facial and as-applied\n\nchallenge seeking an injunction against the laws' enforcement and\n\na declaration of their unconstitutionality.                    On summary judgment,\n\nthe district court largely rejected NOM's claims, agreeing only\n\nthat the phrase \"for the purpose of influencing,\" which the court\n\nsevered     from     the    provisions         in     which     it   appeared,        was\n\nunconstitutionally vague.2\n\n            NOM renews here its arguments challenging Maine's laws on\n\nvagueness and overbreadth grounds.                    NOM asks as well that we\n\nreverse a ruling by the district court unsealing the trial record.\n\n\n     1\n       In a companion opinion filed today, we consider appellant's\nchallenges to a related provision of Rhode Island's election laws.\nSee Nat'l Org. for Marriage v. Daluz, No. 10-2304 (1st Cir. 2011).\n     2\n       The court also held unconstitutional a regulation governing\nthe timing of disclosures. That holding is not at issue in this\nappeal.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fIn turn, the defendants (various Maine officials) contend that the\n\ndistrict court erred in finding vague, and severing from Maine's\n\nstatutes, the phrase \"for the purpose of influencing.\"\n\n            After careful consideration of the parties' arguments and\n\nkey precedents, we conclude that Maine's laws pass constitutional\n\nmuster.     Central to our holding is the nature of the laws NOM\n\nchallenges here.      These provisions neither erect a barrier to\n\npolitical speech nor limit its quantity.            Rather, they promote the\n\ndissemination of information about those who deliver and finance\n\npolitical speech, thereby encouraging efficient operation of the\n\nmarketplace of ideas. As the Supreme Court recently observed, such\n\ncompulsory \"transparency enables the electorate to make informed\n\ndecisions    and   give     proper   weight    to   different    speakers     and\n\nmessages.\"     Citizens United v. FEC, 130 S. Ct. 876, 916 (2010).\n\nWhile we acknowledge that disclosure can, in some cases, unduly\n\nburden or chill political speech, there is no evidence that the\n\nMaine laws at issue here have had such a deleterious effect on NOM\n\nor its constituents.\n\n            We agree with the appellees that the use of \"for the\n\npurpose of     influencing\"     in   the    statutes    at   issue,   given   the\n\nappropriately limited reading offered by Maine's Commission on\n\nGovernmental       Ethics      and    Election         Practices,      is     not\n\nunconstitutionally vague, and therefore we vacate the district\n\ncourt's holding as to that phrase and the consequent severance of\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fportions of Maine's statutes.        We otherwise affirm the district\n\ncourt's judgment in its entirety.\n\n                 I.   Statutory and Procedural Background\n\nA.   Maine's Election Laws\n\n            Maine has enacted a comprehensive set of election laws\n\nthat embraces, among other things, contribution limits, a public\n\nfinancing system for state-office candidates, and various reporting\n\nand disclosure requirements for those engaged in election-related\n\nadvocacy.    We have previously described the contribution limit and\n\npublic financing aspects of Maine's regulation of elections --\n\nwhich are not at issue here -- in some detail.                See Daggett v.\n\nComm'n on Governmental Ethics & Election Practices, 205 F.3d 445,\n\n450-52 (1st Cir. 2000).          The provisions challenged here, all\n\nrelating solely to reporting and disclosure, fall into three\n\ncategories: rules governing PACs, rules governing \"independent\n\nexpenditures,\" and general attribution and disclaimer requirements.\n\n            1.   PAC Provisions\n\n            Maine's    PAC   provisions   are,   as   the    appellees   aptly\n\ncharacterize them, \"pure disclosure laws.\"                  Maine imposes no\n\nlimitation on the amount of money PACs may raise, nor does it cap\n\nthe sum a PAC may spend independently of a candidate or candidate\n\ncommittee.    If they contribute money directly to a candidate, PACs\n\nare subject to the same per-candidate contribution limits -- $750\n\nper election for gubernatorial candidates and $350 per election for\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\flegislative candidates -- as any other donor.              See Me. Rev. Stat.\n\ntit. 21-A, § 1015(1), (2).               The only PAC-specific requirements\n\nrelate to registration, recordkeeping, and reporting.\n\n           An organization may qualify as a PAC under Maine law in\n\none of several ways, of which two are relevant here.                 The first\n\npertains to so-called \"major-purpose\" PACs.              An organization that\n\n\"has as its major purpose initiating, promoting, defeating or\n\ninfluencing a candidate election, campaign or ballot question\" must\n\nregister as a PAC in Maine if it receives contributions or makes\n\nexpenditures aggregating more than $1,500 in a given calendar year\n\nfor that purpose.      Id. §§ 1052(5)(A)(4), 1053.         The second relates\n\nto \"non-major-purpose PACs,\" which are subject to a significantly\n\nhigher   contribution/expenditure           threshold    for   registration.\n\nSpecifically, Maine law requires that an organization register as\n\na PAC if it \"does not have as its major purpose promoting,\n\ndefeating or influencing candidate elections but . . . receives\n\ncontributions or makes expenditures aggregating more than $5,000 in\n\na   calendar   year   for       the   purpose   of   promoting,   defeating   or\n\ninfluencing in any way the nomination or election of any candidate\n\nto political office.\"           Id. §§ 1052(5)(A)(5), 1053.\n\n           Within seven days of exceeding the relevant contribution\n\nor expenditure threshold, a PAC must register with the Maine\n\nCommission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices (the\n\n\"Commission\").        Id.   §    1053.     Registration requires      that the\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\forganization supply a name and address for the PAC; identify its\n\nform of organization and date of origin; name its treasurer,\n\nprincipal officers, and primary fundraisers and decisionmakers; and\n\nindicate which candidates, committees, referenda, or campaigns it\n\nsupports or opposes.          Id.   An organization need not make any formal\n\nchanges, such as forming a separate legal entity or creating a\n\nsegregated fund, to operate as a PAC in Maine.\n\n            Once      registered,      a    PAC    is    subject       to    two   ongoing\n\nobligations      under    Maine     law.      First,      the    PAC    treasurer      must\n\nmaintain records         of   certain      election-related        expenditures         and\n\ncontributions for four years following the election to which the\n\nrecords pertain.         Id. § 1057.       Second, the PAC must electronically\n\nfile campaign finance reports on a quarterly basis, with additional\n\nreports due eleven days before any primary or general election and\n\nforty-two days after.          Id. § 1059.        The contents of the report vary\n\nby type of PAC.        A major-purpose PAC must report any contribution\n\nto   the   PAC   of    more    than    $50    (including         the    name,      address,\n\noccupation, and place of business of the contributor), while a non-\n\nmajor-purpose PAC reports only those contributions made \"for the\n\npurpose of promoting, defeating or influencing a ballot question or\n\nthe nomination or election of a candidate to political office.\"\n\nId. § 1060(6).        The reporting of expenditures breaks down along\n\nsimilar    lines:      major-purpose         PACs       report    all       expenditures,\n\nincluding operational and administrative expenses, whereas non-\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fmajor-purpose PACs report \"only those expenditures made for the\n\npurpose of promoting, defeating or influencing a ballot question or\n\nthe nomination or election of a candidate to political office.\"\n\nId. § 1060(4), (5), (7).\n\n            Maine     law     also   explicitly            requires      PACs    that    are\n\norganized     in    another      state     to        comply     with     all    applicable\n\nregistration and reporting requirements.                    See id. § 1053-B.           There\n\nis, however, a narrow exemption: out-of-state PACs may contribute\n\nto   candidates,      party      committees,         and    PACs    in    Maine    without\n\nregistering        with    the    Commission,           provided       that     (1)     such\n\ncontributions are the out-of-state PAC's only financial activity\n\nwithin Maine and (2) the out-of-state PAC \"has not raised and\n\naccepted any contributions during the calendar year to influence an\n\nelection or campaign\" in Maine.             Id.\n\n            2.     \"Independent Expenditure\" Provision\n\n            In addition to its PAC-specific requirements, Maine's\n\nelection laws also require across-the-board reporting of certain\n\n\"independent expenditures.\"              At a general level, an \"independent\n\nexpenditure\" is any payment or obligation made \"for the purpose of\n\ninfluencing the nomination or election of any person to political\n\noffice\" other than a direct contribution to candidates and their\n\ncampaign committees.             Id. §§    1012(3),           1019-B(1).        Maine    law\n\nprovides    that     any    individual          or     entity      making      independent\n\nexpenditures aggregating more than $100 over the course of a\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fparticular candidacy must file a report with the Commission.                                    Id.\n\n§ 1019-B(3).         That report must simply identify the expenditures by\n\ndate, payee, and purpose, state whether the expenditures were made\n\nin support of or opposition to the relevant candidate, and state\n\nunder oath or affirmation whether the expenditures were coordinated\n\nwith a candidate or candidate committee.                        Id.\n\n                An       expenditure        may     qualify      as        an        \"independent\n\nexpenditure\" in one of two ways.                   First, an expenditure will fall\n\nwithin the independent expenditure reporting requirement where it\n\nis made to finance a communication that \"expressly advocates the\n\nelection or defeat of a clearly identified candidate\" and it is not\n\na direct contribution to a candidate or candidate's committee.3\n\nId.       §    1019-B(1)(A).            Second,        certain         expenditures             for\n\ncommunications made close to an election -- twenty-one days before\n\na primary and thirty-five days before the general election -- are\n\npresumed to be \"independent expenditures.\"                           Id.    The presumption\n\napplies       only       to   an   expenditure      \"made       to    design,         produce    or\n\ndisseminate          a   communication       that    names       or    depicts         a   clearly\n\nidentified candidate\" in a race where at least one candidate has\n\naccepted public financing.                   Id.     § 1019-B(1)(B).                  The person\n\nmaking        the    expenditure       is    afforded       a    chance         to    rebut     the\n\n\n\n      3\n       A candidate will be considered \"clearly identified\" where\nthe name or a depiction of the candidate appears, or where the\n\"identity of the candidate is apparent by unambiguous reference.\"\nMe. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1012(1).\n\n                                              -9-\n\fpresumption by filing a written statement with the Commission\n\nwithin forty-eight hours of the expenditure \"stating that the cost\n\nwas not incurred with the intent to influence the nomination,\n\nelection or defeat of a candidate.\"                 Id. § 1019-B(2).        Once a\n\nrebuttal statement is filed, the Commission will determine by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, after gathering relevant material,\n\nwhether the expenditure was incurred with such an intent.                    Id.\n\n          3.    Attribution and Disclaimer Requirements\n\n          Finally,      Maine      law    also      requires       that   political\n\nadvertisements    and     certain    other       political     messages    contain\n\nstatements of attribution and disclaimer.               The governing statute\n\nprovides that any \"communication expressly advocating the election\n\nor defeat of a clearly identified candidate . . . clearly and\n\nconspicuously    state\"    whether       it   has    been    authorized     by     the\n\ncandidate (the disclaimer) and state the name and address of the\n\nperson   who    financed     the     communication          (the    statement      of\n\nattribution). Id. § 1014(1)-(2). These disclaimer and attribution\n\nstatements must also be included in any communication shortly\n\nbefore an election4 that \"names or depicts a clearly identified\n\ncandidate,\" unless the communication \"was not made for the purpose\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       As with the independent expenditure reporting requirements,\nthe relevant period is twenty-one days before a primary and thirty-\nfive days before a general election. Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, §\n1014(2-A).\n\n                                     -10-\n\fof   influencing   the    candidate's    nomination   for   election   or\n\nelection.\"   Id. § 1014(2-A).\n\n           4.   Sanctions\n\n           The Commission may level a variety of sanctions --\n\nprimarily in the form of fines -- for violations of the provisions\n\ndiscussed above.    An entity that falls within the definition of a\n\nPAC but fails to register may be subject to a civil fine of $250,\n\nid. § 1062-A(1), and a PAC's failure to file reports within thirty\n\ndays of a reporting deadline can result in a fine of up to $10,000\n\nor a criminal misdemeanor charge.         Id. § 1062-A(8).     Likewise,\n\nviolations of the independent expenditure reporting requirement are\n\npunishable by a civil fine of up to $5,000. Id. § 1020-A(5-A)(A).\n\nFinally, violations of the attribution and disclosure requirements\n\nare subject to lesser fines (up to $200 if made within 20 days\n\nbefore an election, and no more than $100 at other times), but may\n\nbe punished by a special fine of up to $5,000 if the violation was\n\ncommitted with the intent to misrepresent the source or candidate\n\nauthorization of the advertisement.       Id. § 1014(4).\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n           NOM filed the initial complaint in this case in October\n\n2009, shortly before a referendum election in Maine on a raft of\n\nissues that included same-sex marriage.5      The complaint challenged\n\n\n     5\n       NOM was joined in its initial complaint by co-plaintiff\nAmerican Principles in Action. The specific claims at issue in\nthis appeal were only pursued by NOM, and, accordingly, American\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe constitutionality of a provision relating to ballot question\n\ncommittees,     Me.   Rev.   Stat.   tit.   21-A,    §     1056-B,6   and   was\n\naccompanied by motions for a temporary restraining order and a\n\npreliminary   injunction.       Following   an   expedited      hearing,    the\n\ndistrict court denied NOM's motion for a temporary restraining\n\norder. NOM subsequently amended its complaint to add the claims at\n\nissue here: those targeting the constitutionality of Maine's PAC\n\nregistration,     independent    expenditure,       and     attribution     and\n\ndisclaimer laws.\n\n          The district court held a hearing on NOM's motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction, consolidated with a bench trial on the\n\nmerits, on August 12, 2010.7         The parties stipulated to a joint\n\ntrial record, which was submitted under seal.             At the hearing, the\n\ndistrict court expressed doubt about the basis for sealing the\n\nrecord, and subsequently issued an order to show cause why the\n\ntrial record should be maintained under seal.\n\n          In a decision issued on August 19, 2010, the district\n\ncourt largely denied NOM's claims and upheld the constitutionality\n\nof the challenged statutes.      See Nat'l Org. for Marriage v. McKee,\n\n\n\nPrinciples in Action does not appear as an appellant.\n     6\n       The constitutionality of § 1056-B is not at issue in this\nappeal.\n     7\n        The hearing addressed solely the specific claims at issue\nin this appeal, leaving the challenges to § 1056-B for a later\nsummary judgment hearing.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f723 F. Supp. 2d 245 (D. Me. 2010).          Finding that NOM had adequately\n\ndemonstrated an interest in engaging in expressive activity that\n\nwas deterred by the prospect of regulation under Maine's laws, the\n\ncourt held that NOM had standing to challenge the statutes at\n\nissue.8   Id. at 256-58.     On the merits, the court found for NOM on\n\nonly two points.\n\n            First, the court held the phrase \"for the purpose of\n\ninfluencing\" to be unconstitutionally vague, citing the treatment\n\nof similar language in the Supreme Court's opinion in Buckley v.\n\nValeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976).      Nat'l Org. for Marriage, 723 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 261.     The phrase (and variants thereof) appears in several\n\nplaces    throughout   the   challenged      statutes,     including    in   the\n\ndefinition of a non-major-purpose PAC,9 the rebuttal provision for\n\npresumed independent expenditures (i.e., those made shortly prior\n\nto   an   election),10   and    in    the     provisions     defining    which\n\n\n     8\n       The court declined, however, to reach the constitutionality\nof the \"major-purpose\" PAC provision, § 1052(5)(A)(4), noting that\nthe record showed no basis for concluding that NOM would be subject\nto that regulation. See Nat'l Org. for Marriage, 723 F. Supp. 2d\nat 254.\n     9\n       See Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(5) (defining non-\nmajor-purpose PAC to include \"[a]ny organization that . . .\nreceives contributions or makes expenditures aggregating more than\n$5,000 . . . for the purpose of promoting, defeating or influencing\nin any way the nomination or election of any candidate to political\noffice\").\n     10\n        See Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1019-B(2) (\"A person\npresumed . . . to have made an independent expenditure may rebut\nthe presumption by filing a signed written statement . . . stating\nthat the cost was not incurred with the intent to influence the\n\n                                     -13-\n\fcommunications       are     subject        to   disclaimer       and     attribution\n\nrequirements.11      The court determined that the appropriate remedy\n\nwas to      sever   the    phrase    from    the statutes.          Id.     The most\n\nsignificant       impact     of    this    holding    was    on     the   independent\n\nexpenditure statute.         Because the rebuttal procedure for presumed\n\nindependent expenditures was dependent on the term \"influencing,\"12\n\nthe court's ruling severed the entire rebuttal procedure.                      Thus,\n\nthe independent       expenditure         presumption      became    conclusive    for\n\nexpenditures for communications clearly identifying a candidate\n\nmade    shortly     before    an    election.        The    court    held   that   the\n\nprovision, as altered, nonetheless passed constitutional muster, as\n\nrecent Supreme Court decisions \"have made the rebuttal exercise\n\npointless.\"       Id. at 265.13\n\n\nnomination, election or defeat of a candidate . . . .\").\n       11\n       See Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1014(2-A) (\"[D]isclosure is\nnot required if the communication was not made for the purpose of\ninfluencing the candidate's . . . election.\").\n       12\n        The other statutes contained additional advocacy-related\nterms that remained after \"influencing\" was stricken -- e.g.,\n\"promoting\"   and   \"defeating,\"  Me.   Rev.   Stat.  tit.   21-A,\n§ 1052(5)(A)(5) -- whereas the independent expenditure rebuttal\nprocedure turned solely on the word \"influence,\" see id. § 1019-\nB(2) (applying to expenditures made \"with the intent to influence\"\ncandidate elections).\n       13\n       The district court reached this conclusion primarily on the\nbasis of Citizens United, which upheld a similar federal-law\ndisclosure provision for advertisements made shortly before an\nelection. The Court ruled that the statute, which contained no\nrebuttal provision analogous to Maine's, passed First Amendment\nmuster in light of a general \"public . . . interest in knowing who\nis speaking about a candidate shortly before an election.\"\n\n                                          -14-\n\f          Second,      the   court     held    one   of   the    implementing\n\nregulations      for     the     independent         expenditure      statute\n\nunconstitutional, finding that it impermissibly burdened First\n\nAmendment speech.      Id. at 266.     The regulation was one of a pair\n\ngoverning the timing of reporting independent expenditures.               The\n\nfirst,   which   the    court    upheld,       required   that   independent\n\nexpenditures of over $100 made within two weeks of an election be\n\nreported to the Commission within twenty-four hours.              See 94-270-\n\n001 Me. Code R. § 10(3)(A).          The second required the reporting\n\nwithin   twenty-four     hours    of     any     independent     expenditures\n\naggregating over $250, regardless of when made.            Id. § 10(3)(B).\n\nFinding the short reporting time frame mandated by both regulations\n\nto be burdensome, the court held that the second regulation, unlike\n\nthe first, could not be justified by a close relationship to \"the\n\nstate's interest in providing information to voters at precisely\n\nthe time that such information can be of greatest use.\"            Nat'l Org.\n\nfor Marriage, 723 F. Supp. 2d at 266.                The defendants do not\n\nchallenge this holding on appeal.\n\n          In addition to its merits holdings, the district court\n\nalso ruled that the trial evidence must be unsealed.               Explaining\n\nthat it was \"not willing to make a First Amendment decision based\n\n\n\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 915.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fupon a sealed record,\" the court ordered the parties to refile the\n\nrecord in publicly available form.14       Id. at 249 n.4.\n\n            This timely appeal followed.\n\n                             II.   Standing\n\n            We begin, as we must, with the defendants' argument that\n\nNOM lacks standing to prosecute some of its constitutional claims.\n\nWe review a district court's ruling on the question of standing de\n\nnovo.     Sullivan v. City of Augusta, 511 F.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n            The   standing   requirement    --   or,   more   accurately,\n\nrequirements, as standing \"comprises a mix of constitutional and\n\nprudential criteria,\" Osediacz v. City of Cranston, 414 F.3d 136,\n\n139 (1st Cir. 2005) -- flows from the limited nature of federal\n\ncourt jurisdiction, and specifically from the grounding of the\n\nfederal judicial power in \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" U.S. Const.\n\nart. III, § 2; Ariz. Christian Sch. Tuition Org. v. Winn, 131 S.\n\nCt. 1436, 1441-42 (2011).      The constitutional aspect of standing\n\nembraces three core requirements:\n\n            \"First, the plaintiff must have suffered an\n            'injury in fact' —- an invasion of a legally\n            protected interest which is (a) concrete and\n            particularized, and (b) 'actual or imminent,\n            not \"conjectural\" or \"hypothetical.\"' Second,\n            there must be a causal connection between the\n            injury and the conduct complained of -— the\n            injury has to be 'fairly trace[able] to the\n\n\n     14\n        We subsequently stayed the unsealing order upon NOM's\nemergency motion for a stay pending appeal.\n\n                                   -16-\n\f              challenged action of the defendant, and not\n              . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action\n              of some third party not before the court.'\n              Third, it must be 'likely,' as opposed to\n              merely 'speculative,' that the injury will be\n              'redressed by a favorable decision.'\"\n\nAriz.      Christian    Sch.,   131   S.   Ct.   at   1442   (quoting      Lujan   v.\n\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)).                  The Supreme\n\nCourt has overlaid these constitutional dictates with several\n\nprudential      limitations     on    standing,       including    \"'the    general\n\nprohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights,\n\nthe   rule    barring    adjudication      of    generalized      grievances   more\n\nappropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the\n\nrequirement that a plaintiff's complaint fall within the zone of\n\ninterests protected by the law invoked.'\"                Osediacz, 414 F.3d at\n\n139 (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984)).                           In\n\ncertain facial First Amendment challenges to a statute, we may\n\nrelax these prudential limitations, Osediacz, 414 F.3d at 141, but\n\nthe constitutional requirements apply with equal force in every\n\ncase,      Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist., 584 F.3d 314, 326 n.6 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).\n\n              Defendants do not seek to dispose of the entire suit on\n\nstanding grounds, but instead surgically target NOM's standing to\n\nchallenge Maine's PAC-related election laws.15 They assert that NOM\n\n\n      15\n        Such a     targeted approach is consistent with the claim-\nspecific nature    of standing; \"standing is not dispensed in gross,\"\nLewis v. Casey,    518 U.S. 343, 358 n.6 (1996), and thus a plaintiff\nmust separately    prove standing \"for each claim he seeks to press.\"\n\n                                       -17-\n\flacks standing to bring the PAC claims because it failed to prove\n\nthat it came within the reach of Maine's PAC laws, i.e., that NOM's\n\nactivities would have qualified it as a PAC.            In light of the fact\n\nthat prudential limitations on standing may be relaxed in the\n\ncontext of First Amendment challenges -- and because defendants\n\ncite the constitutional standards for standing in making their\n\nargument -- we construe this argument as a challenge to the\n\nadequacy of NOM's Article III injury-in-fact showing.16\n\n              Preenforcement First Amendment challenges like this one\n\noccupy    a    somewhat    unique     place    in    Article       III   standing\n\njurisprudence.        By   definition,       such   cases   present      us    with\n\nsituations where the government has not yet applied the allegedly\n\nunconstitutional     law   to   the   plaintiff,     and    thus    there     is   no\n\ntangible injury. However, in these circumstances the Supreme Court\n\nhas recognized \"self-censorship\" as \"a harm that can be realized\n\neven without an actual prosecution.\"           Virginia v. Am. Booksellers\n\nAss'n, 484 U.S. 383, 393 (1988); see also N.H. Right to Life\n\nPolitical Action Comm. v. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n\n\nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006).\n     16\n          Defendants do not appear to contest that the second and\nthird prongs of the constitutional standing analysis would be met\nhere; to the extent that the plaintiff has suffered a cognizable\ninjury at all, the injury can \"be traced to the existence and\nthreatened enforcement of the challenged statutes,\" and is\nredressable in an action against the defendants here, who are\ncharged with enforcing Maine's election laws. N.H. Right to Life\nPolitical Action Comm. v. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n                                      -18-\n\f(\"[I]t is not necessary that a person expose herself to arrest or\n\nprosecution under a statute in order to challenge that statute in\n\na federal court.\").           The chilling of protected speech may thus\n\nalone qualify as a cognizable, Article III injury.\n\n            The mere allegation of a \"chill,\" however, will not\n\nsuffice to open the doors to federal court.                    See Laird v. Tatum,\n\n408 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1972) (\"Allegations of a subjective 'chill' are\n\nnot   an   adequate    substitute          for    a   claim   of   specific   present\n\nobjective harm or a threat of specific future harm . . . .\").\n\nWhere, as here, the plaintiff claims injury based on such a\n\nchilling of speech, the plaintiff must establish with specificity\n\nthat she is \"within the class of persons potentially chilled.\"\n\nOsediacz, 414 F.3d at 142.           This burden will be satisfied by record\n\nevidence supporting \"an objectively reasonable possibility that she\n\nwould be subject to the allegedly unconstitutional [law].\"                     Id. at\n\n143; see also N.H. Right to Life, 99 F.3d at 14 (\"A party's\n\nsubjective      fear   that    she    may    be       prosecuted   for   engaging   in\n\nexpressive activity will not be held to constitute an injury for\n\nstanding purposes unless that fear is objectively reasonable.\").\n\n            NOM challenges three separate provisions of Maine's PAC\n\nlaws: the major-purpose PAC definition, the non-major-purpose PAC\n\ndefinition, and the provision governing out-of-state PACs.                          We\n\nexamine    in   turn   whether       the    record      supports    an   \"objectively\n\nreasonable possibility\" that each provision would be applied to\n\n\n                                           -19-\n\fNOM, Osediacz, 414 F.3d at 143, and then turn briefly to a related\n\ninquiry specific to NOM's vagueness challenges to the PAC statutes.\n\nA.   Standing to Challenge Major-Purpose PAC Provision\n\n           It is plain that NOM has no objectively reasonable\n\napprehension of being regulated as a major-purpose PAC.           Among\n\nother things, a major-purpose PAC must have \"as its major purpose\n\ninitiating,   promoting,   defeating   or   influencing   a   candidate\n\nelection, campaign or ballot question\" in Maine.      Me. Rev. Stat.\n\ntit. 21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(4).    NOM identifies itself as a nonprofit\n\nadvocacy organization with a national scope, dedicated to providing\n\n\"organized opposition to same-sex marriage in state legislatures.\"\n\nNOM's advocacy efforts and expenditures have spanned the country,\n\nwith significant expenditures in California, Iowa, New York, and\n\nNew Hampshire, among others.    In 2009, the year of NOM's largest\n\nexpenditures in Maine (made to support repeal of Maine's same-sex\n\nmarriage law), NOM spent $1.8 million in Maine out of $8 million in\n\ntotal expenditures for the year. In light of this record, NOM does\n\nnot have as its \"major purpose\" election advocacy in Maine, and it\n\nis accordingly not subject to regulation as a major-purpose PAC.\n\nNOM therefore lacks standing to challenge § 1052(5)(a)(4).\n\nB.   Standing to Challenge Non-Major-Purpose PAC Provision\n\n           It is a closer question whether the record reveals an\n\nobjectively reasonable possibility that NOM would be regulated as\n\na non-major-purpose PAC under Maine law.     To so qualify, NOM would\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fhave to anticipate receiving contributions or making expenditures\n\nof more than $5,000 in a year \"for the purpose of promoting,\n\ndefeating or influencing in any way the nomination or election of\n\nany candidate to political office.\"         Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, §\n\n1052(5)(A)(5).       The evidence is inconclusive as to whether NOM\n\nactually crossed the $5,000 threshold during the 2010 election\n\ncycle.17    However, we need not determine whether NOM in fact became\n\nsubject to the provision during the relevant period, because NOM\n\nclaims injury based upon self-censorship in anticipation of the\n\nlaw's application to it, and not upon the actual burdens of the\n\nlaw.        NOM's   executive   director,   Brian   Brown,   testified   --\n\nconsistently with the allegations in NOM's complaint -- that NOM's\n\nfear of enforcement of Maine's election laws was curtailing NOM's\n\nspeech, and that \"[u]ntil Maine's law is changed,\" NOM was \"not\n\ngoing to expend precious resources\" becoming involved in campaigns\n\nin the state.       The appropriate inquiry, then, is whether it was\n\nobjectively reasonable for NOM to believe that the non-major-\n\npurpose PAC provision might apply to it and that it would have to\n\ncurtail its activities in Maine to avoid such a result.\n\n\n\n\n       17\n       At the time the district court issued its merits decision\nin August 2010, \"NOM ha[d] endorsed no one, d[id] not . . . plan to\nmake expenditures, and did not even budget for expenditures in [the\n2010] Maine election cycle.\" Nat'l Org. for Marriage, 723 F. Supp.\n2d at 258.\n\n                                    -21-\n\f             The    record   evidence     confirms   that   NOM's   fears    were\n\nobjectively reasonable and led NOM to engage in self-censorship.18\n\nThe complaint, which was verified by Brown, explained that NOM\n\nsought to engage in a variety of forms of election-related speech,\n\nincluding \"radio ads, direct mail, and publicly accessible Internet\n\npostings of its radio ads and direct mail.\"             NOM alleged that some\n\nportion of these advertisements would relate to \"clearly identified\n\ncandidates for state or local offices.\" To this end, NOM discussed\n\npotential advertisements with a marketing vendor, and went so far\n\nas   to    have    the   vendor    create   three    template   advertisements\n\n(specifically,       copy    for   two   broadcast   advertisements    and   one\n\nmailer) to be used in not-yet-identified candidate races. One such\n\ntemplate, titled \"Consequences,\" raised fears that legalizing same-\n\nsex marriage would lead to schools teaching children about same-sex\n\nrelationships, and concluded:\n\n\n\n      18\n        As defendants note, NOM did expend some resources in two\nlegislative races in September 2010 (after the district court\nissued its opinion). Specifically, NOM sent out postcards that\nread: \"In May 2009, the Maine Legislature approved homosexual\n'marriage.' Rep. Linda Valentino and Rep. Donald Pilon voted to\nsupport same-sex 'marriage.' Now it's time to let Don Pilon and\nLinda Valentino know we don't agree with their decision to back\nsame-sex 'marriage.' Email [them] . . . and tell them they stand\non the wrong side of House District[s] 133 and 134.\" The other\nside of the postcards contained pictures of the candidates'\nopponents, identified them as \"stand[ing] for marriage as between\none man and one woman,\" and urged voters to email them to \"thank\nthem for standing for traditional marriage.\"      However, because\nthese mailings took place after NOM had filed its notice of appeal,\nthey are not properly part of the record here and we do not\nconsider them in our standing analysis.\n\n                                         -22-\n\f            Legislator Z and some politicians in Maine\n            can't fix the real problems in these troubled\n            times, but they've got time to push gay\n            marriage on Maine families? Call Legislator Z\n            and tell him/her: \"Don't mess with marriage.\"\n\nWhile the record does not indicate how much the contemplated\n\nadvertisements would cost, NOM alleged generally that each of its\n\ncommunications costs more than $250. The advertisements were never\n\nused, in line with NOM's claim to have curtailed its planned\n\nspeech. The record also contained evidence that NOM had made\n\npolitical     expenditures          in    Maine      in   the    past,     including\n\ncontributions of $1.8 million in 2009 to a committee opposed to\n\nMaine's same-sex marriage law.\n\n            We agree with the district court that, although NOM's\n\n\"showing certainly could have been stronger,\" Nat'l Org. for\n\nMarriage, 723 F. Supp. 2d at 258, NOM has met its standing burden\n\nwith respect to its challenge to § 1052(5)(A)(5).                      The burden of\n\nproving that one's speech was chilled is a modest one.                             See\n\nOsediacz,    414    F.3d      at   143.        The   record   evidence    adequately\n\nestablishes both \"an objectively reasonable possibility\" that NOM\n\nwould be subject to Maine's requirements for non-major-purpose PACs\n\nif   it   engaged   in     its     intended     speech,   and   that     NOM   forwent\n\npolitical    speech      to   avoid      the    alleged   burdens   (and       possible\n\npenalties for non-compliance) attending the non-major-purpose PAC\n\nprovision. Id. Such self-censorship in the face of possible legal\n\nrepercussions suffices to show Article III injury.                  See N.H. Right\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\fto Life, 99 F.3d at 13 (\"[A]n actual injury can exist when the\n\nplaintiff is chilled from exercising her right to free expression\n\nor   forgoes         expression      in     order    to       avoid   enforcement\n\nconsequences.\").\n\nC.   Standing to Challenge Out-of-State PAC Provision\n\n             We next examine NOM's standing to challenge § 1053-B,\n\nwhich     provides    generally      that   a    \"political     action   committee\n\norganized outside of [Maine] shall register and file reports with\n\nthe [C]ommission\" in accordance with Maine's PAC laws.19                  Me. Rev.\n\nStat. tit. 21-A, § 1053-B.           The question of whether NOM might be\n\nconsidered a \"political action committee\" retreads ground we have\n\njust covered.        Maine law defines \"political action committee\" to\n\ninclude, among other things, a non-major-purpose PAC.                    Moreover,\n\nthe record shows that NOM, which operates from New Jersey, is\n\norganized as a Virginia nonprofit. Thus, there is no question that\n\nNOM is \"organized outside of [Maine],\" and there is a reasonable\n\npossibility    that     it   would    be    considered    a    \"political   action\n\ncommittee\" within the meaning of the statute.                  NOM therefore has\n\nstanding to challenge the out-of-state PAC provision.\n\n\n\n     19\n       As described above, the provision also establishes a narrow\nexemption from registration and reporting for an out-of-state PAC\nif its \"only financial activity within the State is to make\ncontributions to candidates, party committees, political action\ncommittees or ballot question committees.\" Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-\nA, § 1053-B. As NOM indicated that it intended to make independent\nexpenditures for political advertising, it would not fall within\nthis exemption.\n\n                                          -24-\n\fD.   Standing to Bring Vagueness Challenge\n\n           We last address a standing-related argument specific to\n\nNOM's vagueness claims.      Defendants argue that NOM cannot bring a\n\nvagueness challenge to the non-major-purpose PAC definition, as\n\nwell as to its corresponding definition of the term \"expenditure,\"20\n\nbecause   NOM's   advocacy   efforts   were   clearly   covered   by   the\n\nprovisions' terms.     In so arguing, defendants rely on the well-\n\nestablished proposition that a \"'plaintiff who engages in some\n\nconduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness\n\nof the law as applied to the conduct of others.'\"             Holder v.\n\nHumanitarian Law Project, 130 S. Ct. 2705, 2719 (2010) (quoting\n\nHoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489,\n\n495 (1982)).21    Defendants contend that certain postcards NOM sent\n\nin September 2010 targeting state legislative candidates were\n\n\n     20\n        \"Expenditure,\" which appears in the definition of a non-\nmajor-purpose PAC, is defined by another portion of the statute to\ninclude a \"purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit\nor gift of money or anything of value, made for the purpose of\ninfluencing the nomination or election of any person to political\noffice; or for the initiation, support or defeat of a campaign,\nreferendum or initiative, including the collection of signatures\nfor a direct initiative, in this State.\" Me. Rev. Stat. tit 21-A,\n§ 1052(4)(A)(1).\n     21\n         While Supreme Court precedent does not explicitly brand\nthis an issue of standing, see, e.g., Humanitarian Law Project, 130\nS. Ct. at 2719, it is conceptually related to standing doctrine and\nhas been so treated by a number of circuit courts.       See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Tyler, 281 F.3d 84, 91 n.6 (3d Cir. 2002); United\nStates v. Hill, 167 F.3d 1055, 1064 (6th Cir. 1999); see also Hunt\nv. City of Los Angeles, 638 F.3d 703, 710 (9th Cir. 2011)\n(referring to the bar on vagueness challenges by those whose\nconduct is clearly covered as a \"special standing principle[]\").\n\n                                  -25-\n\funambiguously covered by the non-major-purpose PAC statute and\n\nexpenditure definition, i.e., that they were \"for the purpose of\n\npromoting,    defeating    or   influencing    in    any   way\"   a    candidate\n\nelection, Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(5), and \"for the\n\npurpose of influencing the . . . election of any person to\n\npolitical office; or for the initiation, support or defeat of a\n\ncampaign,\" id. § 1052(4)(A)(1).\n\n            The defendants' argument is off-target for at least two\n\nreasons.    First, the question of whether the non-major-purpose PAC\n\nprovisions    clearly     applied   to     NOM's    September     mailings    is\n\nirrelevant to NOM's standing to bring its vagueness claims.\n\nBecause this is a preenforcement challenge based on conduct forgone\n\ndue to an alleged chill, the appropriate focus for the defendants'\n\narguments would be on whether \"the statutory terms are clear in\n\ntheir application to [NOM's] proposed conduct.\"             Humanitarian Law\n\nProject, 130 S. Ct. at 2720 (emphasis added).                   Moreover, the\n\njudgment in this case was entered and NOM's appeal was filed in\n\nAugust 2010, and thus evidence of NOM's September 2010 advocacy\n\nefforts is not properly part of the record on appeal.22               At the time\n\nof the hearing below, NOM had not yet engaged in any advocacy\n\nefforts in Maine in 2010.\n\n            Second, NOM's claim is not simply a challenge to the\n\nvagueness of the provisions as they would be applied to its actual\n\n\n     22\n          See supra note 18.\n\n                                    -26-\n\for intended advocacy efforts; NOM also brings a facial challenge to\n\nthe provisions under the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine. The\n\nbar against vagueness challenges by those whose conduct the law\n\nclearly proscribes is \"relaxed . . . in the First Amendment\n\ncontext, permitting plaintiffs to argue that a statute is overbroad\n\nbecause it is unclear whether it regulates a substantial amount of\n\nprotected speech.\"      United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304\n\n(2008).23     We thus see no bar to reaching the merits of NOM's\n\nvagueness challenge to the non-major-purpose PAC provisions.\n\n             III.   First Amendment Overbreadth Challenges\n\n             Turning to the merits of NOM's constitutional challenges,\n\nwe   first   address   its   First   Amendment   arguments   that   Maine's\n\nelection laws are unconstitutionally overbroad, reviewing those\n\nclaims de novo.     United States v. Morales-de Jesús, 372 F.3d 6, 8\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (constitutional challenges are reviewed de novo).\n\nThe First Amendment's guarantee of free speech applies with special\n\nvigor to discussion of public policy and the qualifications of\n\n\n\n\n      23\n        Humanitarian Law Project is not to the contrary.\nHumanitarian Law Project simply noted, in the context of an as-\napplied vagueness challenge to a federal criminal statute, that the\ngeneral rule prohibiting such challenges where the petitioner's\nspeech is clearly proscribed applies in the First Amendment arena.\nHumanitarian Law Project, 130 S. Ct. at 2719 (\"Th[e] rule makes no\nexception for conduct in the form of speech.\"). Consistent with\nWilliams, however, Humanitarian Law Project noted that the\npetitioner's vagueness arguments might make out a valid claim if\nframed as an \"overbreadth claim under the First Amendment.\" Id.\n\n                                     -27-\n\fpolitical candidates.24   Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14 (1976).\n\nIndeed, \"there is practically universal agreement that a major\n\npurpose of [the First] Amendment was to protect the free discussion\n\nof governmental affairs.\"     Mills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 218\n\n(1966).   Accordingly, \"[t]he First Amendment affords the broadest\n\nprotection to such political expression in order 'to ensure [the]\n\nunfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political\n\nand social changes desired by the people.'\"      Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n\n14 (alteration in original) (quoting Roth v. United States, 354\n\nU.S. 476, 484 (1957)).\n\n          NOM has framed its First Amendment challenges to Maine's\n\nelection laws as overbreadth claims, arguing that each law is\n\nunconstitutional on its face.   Under the overbreadth doctrine, \"a\n\nstatute is facially invalid if it prohibits a substantial amount of\n\nprotected speech.\"    Williams, 553 U.S. at 292.     The overbreadth\n\ndoctrine is \"'strong medicine'\" that should be \"employed . . . with\n\nhesitation, and then 'only as a last resort.'\"    New York v. Ferber,\n\n458 U.S. 747, 769 (1982) (quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S.\n\n601, 613 (1973)).    For that reason, courts \"vigorously enforce[]\n\nthe requirement that a statute's overbreadth be substantial, not\n\n\n\n\n     24\n       The First Amendment is incorporated through the Fourteenth\nAmendment and thus applies to Maine's laws. Vote Choice, Inc. v.\nDiStefano, 4 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing N.Y. Times Co. v.\nSullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 276-77 (1964)).\n\n                                -28-\n\fonly in an absolute sense, but also relative to the statute's\n\nplainly legitimate sweep.\"                Williams, 553 U.S. at 292.\n\nA.    Distinction Between Issue Discussion and Express Advocacy\n\n              We    first    address       NOM's     arguments     that    the   statutes\n\nchallenged here are overbroad because they may reach discussion of\n\nissues as well as express advocacy of a candidate's election or\n\ndefeat.     The division between pure \"issue discussion\" and \"express\n\nadvocacy\" of a candidate's election or defeat is a conceptual\n\ndistinction that has played an important, and at times confounding,\n\nrole   in    a     certain    set    of    modern     Supreme    Court     election    law\n\nprecedents.          Though     the       contours    (and    significance)       of    the\n\ndistinction have never been firmly fixed, the core premise is that\n\nregulation of speech expressly advocating a candidate's election or\n\ndefeat      may    more   easily         survive    constitutional        scrutiny     than\n\nregulation of speech discussing political issues more generally.\n\n              Because a number of NOM's arguments here raise, both\n\ndirectly and indirectly, this distinction between issue discussion\n\nand    express      advocacy,       we    pause     briefly   to   describe      how    the\n\ndistinction arose and developed.                  We ultimately conclude, however,\n\nthat the distinction is not important for the issues addressed in\n\nthis appeal.\n\n              1.    Issue/Express Advocacy Distinction Generally\n\n              The issue discussion/express advocacy distinction has its\n\nroots in the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo. Perhaps\n\n\n                                             -29-\n\fthe Court's seminal decision in the area of campaign finance\n\nregulation, Buckley resolved a wide-ranging series of challenges to\n\nprovisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (\"FECA\").\n\nOne of those challenged provisions, of relevance to our discussion\n\nhere, imposed an absolute cap on independent expenditures, stating\n\nthat \"'[n]o person may make any expenditure . . . relative to a\n\nclearly identified candidate during a calendar year which, when\n\nadded to all other expenditures made by such person during the year\n\nadvocating the election or defeat of such candidate, exceeds\n\n$1,000.'\"     Buckley, 424 U.S. at 39 (alterations in original)\n\n(quoting 18 U.S.C. § 608(e)).\n\n            Reviewing this language, the Court first noted that the\n\n\"use of so indefinite a phrase as 'relative to' a candidate\" raised\n\nserious vagueness concerns.     Id. at 41.    The Court construed the\n\nphrase (by reference to its surrounding terms) as limited to\n\nexpenditures \"advocating the election or defeat of\" a candidate.\n\nHowever, this construction, in the Court's estimation, merely\n\n\"refocus[ed] the vagueness question.\"        Id. at 42.   The Court's\n\nevident concern was that the statute, even as limited, failed to\n\ndraw a sharp enough line between advocacy of a candidate's election\n\nand discussion of issues, and that the resulting uncertainty over\n\nwhat the statute covered would \"'compel[] the speaker to hedge and\n\ntrim,'\"     id. at 43 (quoting Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 535\n\n(1945)):\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f             [T]he distinction between discussion of issues\n             and candidates and advocacy of election or\n             defeat of candidates may often dissolve in\n             practical application. Candidates, especially\n             incumbents, are intimately tied to public\n             issues involving legislative proposals and\n             governmental actions. Not only do candidates\n             campaign on the basis of their positions on\n             various    public   issues,    but   campaigns\n             themselves generate issues of public interest.\n\nId. at 42.    To avoid this uncertainty, the Court limited the scope\n\nof the statute to \"expenditures for communications that in express\n\nterms25 advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified\n\ncandidate for federal office.\"       Id. at 44.26\n\n             The   constitutional    basis   for    this   concern   with\n\ndistinguishing between laws that regulate advocacy of a candidate's\n\nelection and those that regulate pure issue discussion has never\n\nbeen entirely clear.     Buckley explicitly framed its discussion in\n\nterms of unconstitutional vagueness under the Due Process Clause,\n\nand there is, to be sure, a vagueness dimension to the analysis.\n\nSee, e.g., FEC v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 497\n\n(2007) (Scalia, J., concurring in part) (referring to the express\n\nadvocacy portion of Buckley as the decision's \"vagueness holding\").\n\n\n\n     25\n        The Court provided specific examples of such \"express\nterms,\" including \"'vote for,' 'elect,' 'support,' 'cast your\nballot for,' 'Smith for Congress,' 'vote against,' 'defeat,' [and]\n'reject.'\" Buckley, 424 U.S. at 44 n.52.\n     26\n       The Court grafted a similar limiting construction onto the\nlanguage of a disclosure statute, 2 U.S.C. § 434(e), to address\nperceived problems with its use of the phrase \"for the purpose of\ninfluencing [a candidate election].\" Buckley, 424 U.S. at 80.\n\n                                    -31-\n\fHowever, this interpretation has its limits; the mere fact that a\n\nstatute may cover issue discussion as well as candidate advocacy\n\ndoes not      alone   render    it   vague    under   due   process standards,\n\nprovided that the statute is reasonably clear in its coverage.\n\n              Perhaps for this reason, there are hints in Buckley that\n\nthe constitutional basis for the Court's concern lay more in\n\noverbreadth – i.e., that statutes that reached issue discussion\n\nmight be deemed to regulate impermissibly a substantial amount of\n\nspeech protected by the First Amendment -- than in vagueness. See,\n\ne.g.,   424    U.S.   at   80   (limiting     a   second,   disclosure-related\n\nprovision of FECA to communications that \"expressly advocate\" a\n\ncandidate's election to \"insure that the reach of [the provision]\n\nis not impermissibly broad\").            This reading finds considerable\n\nsupport in subsequent authority.              See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S.\n\n103, 120 n.14 (1990) (describing Buckley as a \"case where a law was\n\nconstrued to avoid potential overbreadth problems\"); FEC v. Mass.\n\nCitizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 248 (1986) (stating that\n\nBuckley's \"express advocacy\" limitation was imposed to \"avoid\n\nproblems of overbreadth\"); cf. McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 192\n\n(2003) (noting that Buckley \"narrowly read[] the FECA provisions\n\n. . . to avoid problems of vagueness and overbreadth\"), overruled\n\non other grounds by Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. 876. Regardless of\n\nits origins, the dividing line between issue discussion and express\n\nadvocacy, as it evolved, came to be associated more strongly with\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\fFirst     Amendment     overbreadth    analysis    than    with    due   process\n\nvagueness concerns.27        See, e.g., Wis. Right to Life, 551 U.S. at\n\n457 (noting that the \"law in this area requires us . . . to draw\n\nsuch a line, because we have recognized that the interests held to\n\njustify    the    regulation    of    campaign    speech   [under    the   First\n\nAmendment] . . . 'might not apply' to the regulation of issue\n\nadvocacy\" (quoting McConnell, 540 U.S. at 206 n.88)).\n\n             2.    Application to Maine's Election Statutes\n\n             Drawing on these cases, NOM argues that the statutes\n\nbefore us are unconstitutionally overbroad because they reach issue\n\nadvocacy as well as express advocacy of a candidate's election or\n\ndefeat. NOM's argument presumes that the distinction between issue\n\ndiscussion and express advocacy is relevant to the review of the\n\nstatutes here.         That is not the case for a couple of reasons.\n\n             First, the issue/express advocacy dichotomy has only\n\narisen in a narrow set of circumstances not present here. From the\n\nbeginning,       the   distinction's    primary    purview   has    been   cases\n\n\n\n\n     27\n        This is so to the extent that the line between issue\nadvocacy and candidate advocacy was considered a valid distinction\nat all. Indeed, the majority in McConnell indicated that it was\nnot \"persuaded, independent of our precedents, that the First\nAmendment erects a rigid barrier between express advocacy and\nso-called issue advocacy,\" noting that the \"notion cannot be\nsquared with our longstanding recognition that the presence or\nabsence   of   magic   words   cannot   meaningfully   distinguish\nelectioneering speech from a true issue ad.\" McConnell, 540 U.S.\nat 193.\n\n                                       -33-\n\fscrutinizing limits on independent expenditures.28 The statute that\n\nprompted the Buckley Court to introduce the \"express advocacy\"\n\nconstruction       was    a        blanket     $1,000   limit     on    independent\n\nexpenditures.      424 U.S. at 41-44.            The more recent Supreme Court\n\nprecedents to make use of the express/issue advocacy distinction\n\naddressed a narrower federal law prohibiting corporations and labor\n\nunions      from   employing         general    treasury      funds    to   pay   for\n\n\"electioneering\" communications targeting candidates for election.\n\nSee McConnell, 540 U.S. at 189-209; Wis. Right to Life, 551 U.S. at\n\n464-82.     This line of cases came to a definitive end with Citizens\n\nUnited, which held limitations on such expenditures by corporations\n\nand unions to be unconstitutional, and thus effectively prohibited\n\nany   law    limiting    independent          expenditures     regardless    of   the\n\nidentity of the regulated entity.               130 S. Ct. at 896-913.        As the\n\npresent case does not involve a limit on independent expenditures,\n\nthe relevance of these cases is limited at best.\n\n             Second, and more fundamentally, the Supreme Court has\n\nexplicitly     rejected       an    attempt    to   \"import    [the]   distinction\"\n\nbetween issue and express advocacy into the consideration of\n\ndisclosure requirements.             Id. at 915; see also id. (\"[W]e reject\n\nCitizens United's contention that the disclosure requirements must\n\n\n      28\n        In FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 27 (1998), the Court\nexplicitly entertained the possibility, but did not decide, that\nBuckley's \"express advocacy\" narrowing construction was limited to\naddressing \"the First Amendment problems presented by regulation of\n'independent expenditures.'\"\n\n                                         -34-\n\fbe limited to speech that is the functional equivalent of express\n\nadvocacy.\").     The   provisions   before   us   are   all   effectively\n\ndisclosure laws, in that they require the divulgence of information\n\nto the public or the Commission, but do not directly limit speech.29\n\nWe find it reasonably clear, in light of Citizens United, that the\n\ndistinction between issue discussion and express advocacy has no\n\nplace in First Amendment review of these sorts of disclosure-\n\noriented laws.   Accord Human Life of Wash. Inc. v. Brumsickle, 624\n\nF.3d 990, 1016 (9th Cir. 2010) (\"Given the Court's analysis in\n\nCitizens United, and its holding that the government may impose\n\ndisclosure requirements on speech, the position that disclosure\n\n\n\n\n     29\n       Of the provisions at issue here, Maine's requirement that\nnon-major-purpose PACs register with the Commission is, on its\nface, the furthest from a traditional disclosure law. In function,\nhowever, it too is first and foremost a disclosure provision. The\nregistration requirement does not obligate the PAC to form a\nseparate entity, create a segregated fund, or make any substantive\nchange to its operation or form; the law merely requires the\nreporting of certain information about the PAC after it crosses the\napplicable contribution/expenditure threshold (along with certain\nother de minimis requirements, such as ongoing maintenance of\nrecords). See Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1053.\n     Moreover, Citizens United may be read to suggest that the\nCourt views this type of information-gathering registration\nrequirement as akin to a disclosure requirement. In explaining why\nit was not importing the express advocacy limitation into its\nanalysis of the disclosure law before it, the Court cited a case\nupholding against First Amendment challenge a federal law that\nimposed both disclosure and registration requirements on lobbyists,\nnoting that such requirements were found permissible \"even though\nCongress has no power to ban lobbying itself.\" Citizens United,\n130 S. Ct. at 915 (citing United States v.

Standard of Scrutiny\n\n               Since Buckley, the Supreme Court has distinguished in its\n\nFirst Amendment jurisprudence between laws that restrict \"the\n\namount    of    money        a    person       or    group     can    spend        on    political\n\ncommunication\"         and        laws    that        simply    require       disclosure          of\n\ninformation by those engaging in political speech. 424 U.S. at 19,\n\n64.      The    Court      has     recognized          that    disclosure          laws,      unlike\n\ncontribution         and     expenditure            limits,     \"impose       no    ceiling       on\n\ncampaign-related activities,\" id. at 64, and thus are a \"less\n\nrestrictive         alternative          to    more    comprehensive          regulations         of\n\nspeech.\" Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 915; see also Buckley, 424\n\nU.S.     at    68     (\"[D]isclosure             requirements         certainly          in     most\n\napplications appear to be the least restrictive means of curbing\n\nthe evils of campaign ignorance and corruption that Congress found\n\nto exist.\").         For that reason, disclosure requirements have not\n\nbeen   subjected        to       strict       scrutiny,       but    rather    to       \"'exacting\n\nscrutiny,' which requires a 'substantial relation' between the\n\ndisclosure requirement and a 'sufficiently important' governmental\n\ninterest.\"       Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914 (quoting Buckley,\n\n\n                                                -36-\n\f424 U.S. at 64, 66); see also Doe v. Reed, 130 S. Ct. 2811, 2818\n\n(2010).30\n\n                While NOM concedes that exacting scrutiny applies to\n\nreview     of    Maine's      independent    expenditure   and   disclaimer    and\n\nattribution laws, it contends that Maine's PAC definitions are\n\nsubject to strict scrutiny.             In fact, NOM suggests that any law\n\ndefining an organization as a PAC is subject to strict scrutiny,\n\nbecause, \"[a]s a matter of law, not fact,\" PAC status is burdensome\n\nand subjects an entity to \"extensive regulations.\"                NOM's argument\n\nhere reflects two contradictory points. On the one hand, NOM seeks\n\nto justify the application of strict scrutiny by reference to some\n\nundefined set of \"full-fledged political committee burdens.\"                     On\n\nthe   other,       NOM    disclaims    any     challenge   to    the    disclosure\n\nrequirements attendant to PAC status under Maine law -- i.e., the\n\nactual burdens of registration and reporting imposed by the state's\n\nPAC   provisions         --   but   purports   to   challenge    only    the   \"PAC\n\ndefinition, through which Maine unconstitutionally imposes full-\n\nfledged political committee burdens.\"               NOM's point appears to be\n\nthat \"by giving government the power to license speech\" by defining\n\n\n\n      30\n        Additionally, the application of a disclosure requirement\nmay be held to violate the First Amendment where the challengers\ncan show \"'a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure\n[of personal information] will subject them to threats, harassment,\nor reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.'\"\nReed, 130 S. Ct. at 2820 (alteration in original) (quoting Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 74). NOM has not attempted to make such a showing here\nwith respect to the disclosures required by Maine law.\n\n                                        -37-\n\fan entity as a PAC, whatever obligations are imposed on PACs \"in\n\neffect are prior restraints.\"\n\n            NOM's attempt to ascribe a free-standing significance to\n\nthe PAC label is unpersuasive.           It is not the designation as a PAC\n\nbut rather the obligations that attend PAC designation that matter\n\nfor purposes of First Amendment review.                Those obligations -- as\n\nwell as the basic definition of a \"PAC\" -- vary across the\n\njurisdictions       that    regulate   PACs.     Maine's     requirements   are\n\nsubstantially different from those at issue in the cases NOM cites\n\nin   support   of    its    contention    that   PAC    status   is   inherently\n\nburdensome.    For example, in Citizens United, where, as NOM points\n\nout, the Supreme Court characterized federal-law PACs as \"expensive\n\nto administer and subject to extensive regulations,\"31 130 S. Ct.\n\nat   897,   the     Court    was   considering    a     regime   that   required\n\ncorporations to set up a separate legal entity and create a\n\nsegregated fund prior to engaging in any direct political speech.\n\nIn addition, these federal-law PACs were subject to numerous\n\nobligations and restrictions, among them a prohibition on an\n\norganization soliciting contributions for its segregated fund from\n\nanyone except its \"members,\" which excluded \"those persons who have\n\n\n\n      31\n       Partly for this reason, the Court refused to consider the\noption of financing speech through a PAC to be a factor mitigating\nthe corporate and union independent expenditure ban's burden on\nspeech. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897 (\"Section 441b is\na ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC\ncreated by a corporation can still speak.\").\n\n                                       -38-\n\fmerely contributed to or indicated support for the organization in\n\nthe past.\"    Mass. Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. at 253-54 (citing 2\n\nU.S.C. § 441b(b)(4)(A), (C)).                 In contrast, Maine's non-major-\n\npurpose PAC provision does not condition political speech on the\n\ncreation of a separate organization or fund, establishes no funding\n\nor independent expenditure restrictions,32 and imposes three simple\n\nobligations    on      an   entity    qualifying      as    a    PAC:       filing     of    a\n\nregistration form disclosing basic information, quarterly reporting\n\nof election-related contributions and expenditures, and simple\n\nrecordkeeping.\n\n            Because Maine's PAC laws do not prohibit, limit, or\n\nimpose any onerous burdens on speech, but merely require the\n\nmaintenance and disclosure of certain financial information, we\n\nreject    NOM's     argument      that   strict      scrutiny         should        apply.\n\nAccordingly,      we   review     each   of    the   laws       at    issue    under      the\n\n\"exacting scrutiny\" standard applicable to disclosure requirements.\n\nC.   Application of Exacting Scrutiny to Maine's Laws\n\n            As we have stated, we will consider a law constitutional\n\nunder exacting scrutiny standards where there is a \"substantial\n\nrelation\"     between       the   law    and    a    \"'sufficiently            important'\n\ngovernmental      interest.\"         Citizens    United,        130    S.     Ct.    at   914\n\n(quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 64, 66).                     In Buckley, the Court\n\n\n     32\n       The only restriction on a PAC's expenditures is for direct\ncontributions to candidates; PACs are subject to the same per-\ncandidate contribution limits as any other entity or individual.\n\n                                         -39-\n\frecognized the goal of \"provid[ing] the electorate with information\n\nas to where political campaign money comes from and how it is\n\nspent\" to be such a \"sufficiently important\" governmental interest\n\ncapable of supporting a disclosure law.             424 U.S. at 66 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).       The Court's more recent decisions have\n\ncontinued    to   recognize    the   importance      of   this   informational\n\ninterest.     See, e.g., Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914-15;\n\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 196.\n\n            Buckley     tied   the       government's     interest    in    the\n\ndissemination of information to the functioning of the electoral\n\nprocess,    noting    that   \"[i]n   a   republic    where   the   people   are\n\nsovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices\n\namong candidates for office is essential.\"           424 U.S. at 14-15.     The\n\nCourt observed that disclosure has several benefits in this regard:\n\n            It allows voters to place each candidate in\n            the political spectrum more precisely than is\n            often possible solely on the basis of party\n            labels and campaign speeches. The sources of\n            a candidate's financial support also alert the\n            voter to the interests to which a candidate is\n            most likely to be responsive and thus\n            facilitate predictions of future performance\n            in office.\n\nId. at 67.\n\n            However, the informational interest is not limited to\n\ninforming the choice between candidates for political office.                As\n\nCitizens United recognized, there is an equally compelling interest\n\nin identifying the speakers behind politically oriented messages.\n\n\n                                     -40-\n\fIn an age characterized by the rapid multiplication of media\n\noutlets and the rise of internet reporting, the \"marketplace of\n\nideas\" has become flooded with a profusion of information and\n\npolitical messages.      Citizens rely ever more on a message's source\n\nas a proxy for reliability and a barometer of political spin.\n\nDisclosing the identity and constituency of a speaker engaged in\n\npolitical speech thus \"enables the electorate to make informed\n\ndecisions   and   give   proper   weight   to   different   speakers   and\n\nmessages.\"33 Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 916; see also Cal. Pro-\n\nLife Council, Inc. v. Getman, 328 F.3d 1088, 1105 (9th Cir. 2003)\n\n(recognizing that, in the \"cacophony of political communications\n\nthrough which . . . voters must pick out meaningful and accurate\n\nmessages[,] . . . being able to evaluate who is doing the talking\n\nis of great importance\").      Additionally, in the case of corporate\n\nor organizational speakers, disclosure allows shareholders and\n\nmembers to \"hold [them] accountable for their positions.\" Citizens\n\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 916.         In short, \"[t]he First Amendment\n\nprotects political speech; and disclosure permits citizens and\n\nshareholders to react to [that] speech . . . in a proper way.\" Id.\n\n\n\n\n     33\n       As the Court observed in First National Bank v. Bellotti,\n435 U.S. 765 (1978), \"the people in our democracy are entrusted\nwith the responsibility for judging and evaluating the relative\nmerits of conflicting arguments.    They may consider, in making\ntheir judgment, the source and credibility of the advocate.\" Id.\nat 791-92 (footnote omitted).\n\n                                   -41-\n\f            In line with these precedents, defendants offer Maine's\n\ninterest in disseminating information about political funding to\n\nthe electorate in support of the laws challenged here.34      As the\n\ndistrict court found, the interest is plainly a motivating factor\n\nbehind Maine's laws, and \"Maine, through its Commission website and\n\notherwise, makes [the financial disclosure] information easily\n\navailable to the public.\" Nat'l Org. for Marriage, 723 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 263.   We thus proceed under the exacting scrutiny framework to\n\nexamine whether there is a \"substantial relation\" between Maine's\n\ninformational interest and each of the laws at issue.\n\n            1.    Non-Major-Purpose PAC Provisions\n\n            As we have described, Maine considers an entity to be a\n\nnon-major-purpose PAC when it receives contributions or makes\n\nexpenditures of more than $5,000 annually \"for the purpose of\n\npromoting, defeating or influencing in any way\" a candidate's\n\nelection.        Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(5).     Upon\n\ncrossing that threshold, the newly-deemed non-major-purpose PAC\n\nmust register with the Commission, maintain records of certain\n\nexpenditures as well as donor contributions aggregating more than\n\n$50, and file reports both on a quarterly basis and shortly before\n\n\n     34\n        Defendants also cite an interest in \"gathering data\nnecessary to enforce substantive election law restrictions.\"\nThough we note that Buckley recognized a similar interest in\n\"gathering the data necessary to detect violations of [FECA's]\ncontribution limitations,\" 424 U.S. at 68, we find the\ninformational interest sufficient to support Maine's laws and thus\ndo not reach this second class of interests.\n\n                                  -42-\n\fand after each election.            Id. §§ 1053, 1057, 1059-60.           The\n\nreporting requirements are well tailored to Maine's informational\n\ninterest, requiring disclosure only of the candidates or campaigns\n\nthe non-major-purpose PAC supports or opposes, its expenditures\n\nmade to support or oppose the same, and identifying information for\n\nany contributors who have given more than $50 to the PAC to support\n\nor oppose a candidate or campaign.           Id. § 1060.\n\n              NOM   does   not   challenge   the   substantive    obligations\n\nattendant to non-major-purpose PAC status, nor contest that the\n\nregistration, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements bear a\n\nsubstantial relation to Maine's informational interest.              Instead,\n\nNOM contends that Maine's definition of a non-major-purpose PAC,\n\nstanding alone, is unconstitutionally overbroad.                 In rejecting\n\nNOM's argument for strict scrutiny, we have already addressed the\n\nclaim that PAC status is somehow inherently burdensome apart from\n\nthe specific requirements it entails.           However, there is a second\n\naspect   to    NOM's   argument.      NOM    contends   that   Supreme   Court\n\nprecedent sharply limits regulation of PACs to those that are under\n\nthe control of a candidate or have as their \"major purpose\" the\n\nelection of a candidate.           By its very definition, Maine's non-\n\nmajor-purpose PAC provision covers entities that fall outside of\n\nthat allegedly limited zone of permissible regulation, and thus,\n\nNOM contends, the provision is fatally overbroad.              We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -43-\n\f            NOM extracts support for its argument from a dictum in\n\nBuckley, albeit a dictum that has had some reach.            In Buckley, the\n\nCourt    concluded    that    the   definition    of    expenditure    used    in\n\nconnection with FECA's disclosure provision -- and particularly the\n\nphrase \"for the purpose of influencing\" -- raised significant line-\n\ndrawing problems because it had the \"potential for encompassing\n\nboth issue discussion and advocacy of a political result.\"                    424\n\nU.S. at 79.    In the course of its discussion, the Court noted that\n\nFECA's   definition     of    \"political     committees,\"   which,    like    the\n\ndisclosure provision, was defined in terms of contributions and\n\nexpenditures, \"could raise similar vagueness problems.\"                Id.    The\n\nprovision escaped these concerns, the Court explained, because it\n\ncould be construed more narrowly:\n\n            To fulfill the purposes of [FECA, political\n            committees] need only encompass organizations\n            that are under the control of a candidate or\n            the major purpose of which is the nomination\n            or election of a candidate. Expenditures of\n            candidates and of \"political committees\" so\n            construed can be assumed to fall within the\n            core area sought to be addressed by Congress.\n            They are, by definition, campaign related.\n\nId.   Buckley's      narrow   reading   of     FECA's   political     committee\n\ndefinition, though dictum, appears to have been accepted by later\n\nopinions.     See McConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64; Mass. Citizens for\n\nLife, 479 U.S. at 252 n.6; cf. FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 26-27\n\n(1998) (noting dispute over extent of narrowing construction). NOM\n\ndraws from this the conclusion that the First Amendment permits an\n\n\n                                      -44-\n\fentity to be designated a \"PAC\" only where it (1) \"is under the\n\ncontrol of a candidate\" or (2) has as its major purpose \"the\n\nnomination or election of a candidate.\"\n\n            We find no reason to believe that this so-called \"major\n\npurpose\" test, like the other narrowing constructions adopted in\n\nBuckley,    is   anything     more     than    an    artifact    of     the    Court's\n\nconstruction of a federal statute. See McConnell, 540 U.S. at 191-\n\n92.   The Court has never applied a \"major purpose\" test to a\n\nstate's    regulation    of    PACs,    nor    have    we.      And,    as    we    have\n\ndiscussed, the line-drawing concerns that led the Court to read\n\nFECA's    definition    of    \"political       committee\"      narrowly       are   not\n\nrelevant to our First Amendment review of Maine's statutes.\n\nMoreover, as the district court aptly observed, application of\n\nNOM's \"major-purpose\" test would \"yield perverse results\" here:\n\n            Under NOM's interpretation, a small group with\n            the major purpose of re-electing a Maine state\n            representative that spends $1,500 for ads\n            could be required to register as a PAC. But a\n            mega-group that spends $1,500,000 to defeat\n            the same candidate would not have to register\n            because the defeat of that candidate could not\n            be considered the corporation's major purpose.\n\nNat'l Org. for Marriage, 723 F. Supp. 2d at 264.                       We, like the\n\ndistrict    court,     see    no   basis      to    conclude    \"that    the       First\n\nAmendment's protections should apply so unequally.\"                     Id.\n\n            We therefore reject NOM's argument that the non-major-\n\npurpose PAC definition is unconstitutionally overbroad. Because we\n\nfind a substantial relation between Maine's disclosure-oriented\n\n                                       -45-\n\fregulation of non-major-purpose PACs and its interest in the\n\ndissemination of information regarding the financing of political\n\nspeech, we conclude that the law does not, on its face, offend the\n\nFirst Amendment.\n\n           2.    Independent Expenditure Provision\n\n           We similarly find that Maine's independent expenditure\n\nreporting provision poses no First Amendment concerns.               The law\n\nprimarily obligates anyone spending more than an aggregate of $100\n\nfor communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of\n\na candidate to report the expenditure to the Commission.          Me. Rev.\n\nStat.   tit.    21-A,   §   1019-B(1)(A),   (3).     Reviewing   a    prior,\n\nsubstantially similar version of this provision in Daggett v.\n\nCommission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, 205 F.3d\n\n445, 466 (1st Cir. 2000), we held that \"the modest amount of\n\ninformation requested is not unduly burdensome and ties directly\n\nand closely to the relevant government interests.\"               We see no\n\nreason to depart from that conclusion here.\n\n           The    independent    expenditure   law   also   presumptively\n\nrequires a report of any expenditure over $100 for communications\n\nnaming or depicting a clearly identified candidate within a set\n\nperiod prior to any election.       Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1019-\n\nB(1)(B), (3).     Though we did not review this aspect of the law in\n\nDaggett, the Supreme Court upheld in Citizens United a similar\n\nprovision of federal election law that required disclosure in\n\n\n                                   -46-\n\fconnection with expenditures for electioneering communications\n\n(communications made shortly before an election that refer to a\n\nclearly identified candidate for federal office).              130 S. Ct. at\n\n913-16.     In so doing, the Court noted that \"the public has an\n\ninterest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate shortly\n\nbefore an election.\"      130 S. Ct. at 915-16.          The law here is\n\nperhaps more tailored than that at issue in Citizens United, as it\n\noffers an opportunity to rebut the presumption that a communication\n\nmade shortly before an election and identifying a candidate had the\n\n\"intent to influence the nomination, election or defeat of a\n\ncandidate.\" Me. Rev. Stat. tit 21-A, § 1019-B(2). Regardless, the\n\ninformation that must be reported under this subsection is, as\n\nDaggett    found,   \"modest,\"   205   F.3d   at   466,   and    it   bears   a\n\nsubstantial relation to the public's \"interest in knowing who is\n\nspeaking about a candidate shortly before an election.\"              Citizens\n\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 915-16.\n\n            NOM argues that Maine lacks a \"sufficiently important\"\n\ninterest in the $100 threshold at which the reporting requirement\n\nadheres,     and,   alternatively,    that    the   threshold        lacks   a\n\n\"substantial relation\" to a sufficiently important governmental\n\ninterest.    NOM's argument operates from a mistaken premise; we do\n\nnot review reporting thresholds under the \"exacting scrutiny\"\n\nframework.     In Buckley, facing a similar challenge to a $10\n\nthreshold for a recordkeeping provision and a $100 reporting\n\n\n                                  -47-\n\fthreshold, the Supreme Court noted that the choice of where to set\n\nsuch monetary thresholds \"is necessarily a judgmental decision,\n\nbest   left   in    the   context      of     this    complex     legislation    to\n\ncongressional discretion.\"           424 U.S. at 83.          The Court concluded\n\nthat, although there was no evidence in the record that Congress\n\nhad \"focused carefully on the appropriate level at which to require\n\nrecording and disclosure,\" and despite the fact that the low\n\nthresholds might \"discourage participation by some citizens in the\n\npolitical process,\" it could not say that \"the limits designated\n\nare wholly without rationality.\"            Id.; see also id. n.111 (\"[W]hen\n\nit is seen that a line or point there must be, and that there is no\n\nmathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of\n\nthe legislature must be accepted unless we can say that it is very\n\nwide of any reasonable mark.\" (quoting Louisville Gas Co. v.\n\nColeman, 277 U.S. 32, 41 (1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting))).                     The\n\nCourt thus upheld FECA's recordkeeping and reporting thresholds.\n\n          Following Buckley, we have granted \"judicial deference to\n\nplausible legislative judgments\" as to the appropriate location of\n\na   reporting      threshold,    and        have     upheld    such   legislative\n\ndeterminations unless they are \"'wholly without rationality.'\"\n\nVote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano, 4 F.3d 26, 32-33 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 83).                 In Daggett, for example, we\n\napplied these      standards    in    rejecting       a   challenge to   the    $50\n\nreporting threshold in the prior iteration of Maine's independent\n\n\n                                       -48-\n\fexpenditure law.       205 F.3d at 466 (\"We remain unconvinced . . .\n\nthat, if $100 was an appropriate threshold for requiring the\n\nreporting of independent expenditures in federal elections in\n\nBuckley, $50 is an illegitimate threshold for Maine elections.\").\n\n            Despite the fact that the threshold has been doubled\n\nsince     Daggett,   NOM   argues   that    we     should    find   the    line\n\nunconstitutional because it is not indexed to inflation.                  In so\n\narguing, it relies on an observation in Randall v. Sorrell, 548\n\nU.S. 230, 261 (2006), that \"[a] failure to index limits means that\n\nlimits which are already suspiciously low . . . will almost\n\ninevitably become too low over time.\"              The limits at issue in\n\nSorrell, however, were substantive contribution limits, the setting\n\nof which presents different considerations than the determination\n\nof the threshold for a reporting requirement,35 and which is subject\n\nto different standards of review. Neither we nor the Supreme Court\n\nhas ever second-guessed a legislative decision not to index a\n\nreporting requirement to inflation.        Indeed, in Buckley, the Court\n\nacknowledged    that   Congress,    in   setting    FECA's   $100   reporting\n\nthreshold, appeared to have simply adopted the threshold used in\n\nsimilar disclosure laws since 1910 -- i.e., over the course of more\n\nthan sixty years, without any adjustment for inflation.              424 U.S.\n\n\n\n     35\n       For instance, we have held that the First Amendment would\npermit, in some cases, a first-dollar reporting requirement, see\nVote Choice, 4 F.3d at 33, whereas the First Amendment clearly sets\na \"lower bound\" for contribution limits. Sorrell, 548 U.S. at 248.\n\n                                    -49-\n\fat 83.       We thus reject NOM's argument that the $100 threshold is\n\nunconstitutional simply because it is static. Moreover, we cannot\n\nconclude that Maine's choice of a $100 threshold, double the amount\n\nwe   upheld        just   a   decade    ago   in    Daggett,    is   wholly     without\n\nrationality.\n\n               3.    Disclaimer and Attribution Provisions\n\n               Finally, we agree with the district court that \"Citizens\n\nUnited       has    effectively        disposed     of   any   attack    on     Maine's\n\nattribution and disclaimer requirements.\" Nat'l Org. for Marriage,\n\n723 F. Supp. 2d at 267.           NOM argues that Maine's \"attribution and\n\ndisclaimer requirements are so great that the government's interest\n\ndoes not reflect the burden on speech,\" as the required disclosures\n\nwill \"distract readers and listeners from NOM's message.\"                           We\n\ndisagree.           The   requirements     are     minimal,    calling   only    for a\n\nstatement of whether the message was authorized by a candidate and\n\ndisclosure of the name and address of the person who made or\n\nfinanced the communication.              Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1014(1)-\n\n(2).        These are precisely the requirements approved in Citizens\n\nUnited,36 see 130 S. Ct. at 913-14 (citing 2 U.S.C. § 441d), and\n\nthey bear a close relation to Maine's interest in dissemination of\n\n\n\n       36\n        In fact, the statute at issue in Citizens United was\nslightly more prescriptive, specifying that, for video messages,\n\"[t]he required statement must be made in a 'clearly spoken\nmanner,' and displayed on the screen in a 'clearly readable manner'\nfor at least four seconds.\" 130 S. Ct. at 914 (quoting 2 U.S.C. §\n441d(d)(2)).\n\n                                           -50-\n\finformation regarding the financing of political messages.                The\n\ndisclaimer       and   attribution   requirements    are,   on   their   face,\n\nunquestionably constitutional.37\n\n                   IV.   Due Process Vagueness Challenges\n\n            Having found that each of the challenged statutes pass\n\nmuster under the First Amendment, we turn next to NOM's contention\n\nthat portions of the statutes are unconstitutionally vague.\n\n            The vagueness doctrine, a derivative of due process,\n\nprotects against the ills of laws whose \"prohibitions are not\n\nclearly defined.\"        Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108\n\n(1972); see also Williams, 553 U.S. at 304.          In prohibiting overly\n\nvague laws, the doctrine seeks to ensure that persons of ordinary\n\nintelligence have \"fair warning\" of what a law prohibits, prevent\n\n\"arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement\" of laws by requiring\n\nthat they \"provide explicit standards for those who apply them,\"\n\nand, in cases where the \"statute 'abut(s) upon sensitive areas of\n\nbasic First Amendment freedoms,'\" avoid chilling the exercise of\n\nFirst Amendment rights. Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09 (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372 (1964)).\n\nIn   view   of    this   last   interest,   the   Constitution    requires   a\n\n\n      37\n       NOM argues that, though Citizens United and other courts may\nhave approved disclaimer and attribution limitations in the precise\ncircumstances before them, such measures have never been approved\nper se. That may be so, but the mere fact that disclaimer and\nattribution requirements have not been considered in the\nenvironment in which we review them now does not weaken our\nconclusion that the requirements withstand exacting scrutiny.\n\n                                     -51-\n\f\"'greater   degree    of     specificity'\"       in       cases    involving   First\n\nAmendment rights.          Buckley, 424 U.S. at 77 (quoting Smith v.\n\nGoguen, 415 U.S. 566, 573 (1974)).\n\n            Even under the heightened standard for First Amendment\n\ncases,   though,     not    all     vagueness     rises       to    the   level   of\n\nconstitutional concern.           \"Many statutes will have some inherent\n\nvagueness, for '[i]n most English words and phrases there lurk\n\nuncertainties.'\" Rose v. Locke, 423 U.S. 48, 49-50 (1975) (per\n\ncuriam) (quoting Robinson v. United States, 324 U.S. 282, 286\n\n(1945)); see also     Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 794\n\n(1989) (\"[P]erfect clarity and precise guidance have never been\n\nrequired even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.\").\n\nMoreover,    \"[t]he    mere        fact   that        a     regulation     requires\n\ninterpretation does not make it vague.\"                     Ridley v. Mass. Bay\n\nTransp. Auth., 390 F.3d 65, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).                   We have thus said\n\nthat \"a statute is unconstitutionally vague only if it 'prohibits\n\n. . . an act in terms so uncertain that persons of average\n\nintelligence would have no choice but to guess at its meaning and\n\nmodes of application.'\"       United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67,\n\n84 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc) (quoting United States v. Hussein, 351\n\nF.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 2003)).\n\n            With these standards in mind, we review NOM's vagueness\n\nchallenges de novo.    Hussein, 351 F.3d at 14.              NOM poses challenges\n\nto three sets of terms, and variations thereof: (1) \"promoting,\"\n\n\n                                      -52-\n\f\"support,\"    and     \"opposition\";   (2)     \"influencing\";   and   (3)\n\n\"initiation.\"       In addition, NOM claims that the definition of\n\n\"expressly advocate\" is unconstitutionally vague because it invites\n\nthe use of context to determine the purpose of a communication.\n\nA.   \"Promoting,\" \"Support,\" and \"Opposition\"\n\n            We begin with NOM's vagueness challenge to variations of\n\nthe terms \"promoting,\" \"support,\" and \"opposition,\" which appear in\n\nthree separate provisions:38 the definition of a non-major-purpose\n\nPAC,39 the PAC statute's definition of an \"expenditure,\"40 and the\n\nindependent expenditure provision.41        The district court held each\n\nof these terms to be sufficiently clear to evade due process\n\nconcerns.    We agree.\n\n\n\n\n     38\n       The term \"promoting\" also appears in the definition of a\nmajor-purpose PAC, Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(4), which\nwe do not address here in light of our holding that NOM lacks\nstanding to challenge the major-purpose PAC provision.\n     39\n        The statute defines a non-major-purpose PAC to mean an\nentity that crosses the requisite threshold of contributions or\nexpenditures \"for the purpose of promoting, defeating or\ninfluencing in any way\" a candidate election. Me. Rev. Stat. tit\n21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(5) (emphasis added).\n     40\n        The statute defines \"expenditure\" to include giving\nsomething of value \"for the initiation, support, or defeat\" of a\ncampaign or initiative. Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1052(4)(A)(1)\n(emphasis added).\n     41\n       The independent expenditure statute instructs that reports\nsubmitted pursuant to the provision \"must state whether the\nexpenditure is in support of or in opposition to the candidate.\"\nMe. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1019-B(3)(B) (emphasis added).\n\n                                  -53-\n\f          The Supreme Court rejected a vagueness challenge to\n\nsubstantially similar statutory language in McConnell, 540 U.S. 93,\n\noverruled on other grounds by Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. 876. The\n\nlanguage at issue was a provision of federal election law defining\n\n\"Federal election activity\" to include \"a public communication that\n\nrefers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office . . .\n\nand that promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or\n\nattacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of\n\nwhether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against\n\na candidate).\"     2 U.S.C. § 431(20)(A)(iii).     Applying due process\n\nstandards,   the    Court   observed   that   \"[t]he   words   'promote,'\n\n'oppose,' 'attack,' and 'support' clearly set forth the confines\n\nwithin which potential party speakers must act in order to avoid\n\ntriggering the provision.\"     McConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64.       The\n\nCourt concluded that \"[t]hese words 'provide explicit standards for\n\nthose who apply them' and 'give the person of ordinary intelligence\n\na reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,'\" and thus\n\nheld that the provision was not unconstitutionally vague.            Id.\n\n(quoting Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09).\n\n          NOM acknowledges McConnell's relevance, but argues that\n\nthe opinion's holding is limited to the context of the federal law\n\nat issue there, citing several authorities that purportedly held\n\nsimilar statutory language to be \"vague and overbroad vis-à-vis\n\nother speech or other speakers.\" NOM's argument is misguided. The\n\n\n                                  -54-\n\fauthorities NOM cites -- circuit court opinions and a partial\n\nconcurrence to the Court's 2007 decision in Wisconsin Right to Life\n\n-- address the conceptually distinct question of whether terms such\n\nas   \"promote,\"   \"oppose,\"   \"attack,\"   and   \"support\"   maintain   an\n\nacceptably clear distinction between express campaign advocacy and\n\nissue advocacy.     See Wis. Right to Life, 551 U.S. at 492-93\n\n(Scalia, J., concurring); Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. Carmouche,\n\n449 F.3d 655, 662-66 (5th Cir. 2006); N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v.\n\nBartlett, 168 F.3d 705, 712-13 (4th Cir. 1999).         This is, as we\n\nhave discussed, primarily an overbreadth issue, and we have already\n\nrejected    NOM's    arguments     that   the    statutes    here      are\n\nunconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n           If, on the other hand, NOM offers these authorities\n\nsolely for the purpose of countering McConnell's vagueness holding\n\n-- which is the relevant point here -- they also fall short of the\n\nmark.   None of the cited cases is a majority Supreme Court opinion\n\nissued after McConnell, so McConnell remains the leading authority\n\nrelevant to interpretation of the terms before us.      Of course, the\n\nstatutes here are distinct from the provision that McConnell\n\nconstrued, and thus the Court's reading is not dispositive.\n\nHowever, contrary to NOM's assertion, the statutory context here is\n\nclose enough to McConnell to make the Court's conclusion that the\n\nterms are not vague particularly persuasive.           In each of the\n\nprovisions,   the   terms     \"promote\"/\"promoting,\"   \"support,\"      and\n\n\n                                  -55-\n\f\"oppose\"/\"opposition\" have an election-related object: \"candidate\"\n\nin the federal law, 2 U.S.C. § 431(20)(A)(iii), and \"candidate,\"\n\n\"nomination or election of any candidate\" and \"campaign, referendum\n\nor initiative\" in the Maine provisions, Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A,\n\n§§ 1019-B(3)(B), 1052(4)(A)(1), (5)(A)(5).          If anything, the terms\n\nof Maine's statutes provide slightly more clarity: for example,\n\n§ 1052(5)(A)(5)'s reference to \"promoting . . . the nomination or\n\nelection of any candidate\" is more precise than the federal law's\n\nreference   to   \"promot[ing]   .    .   .   a   candidate,\"   2   U.S.C.   §\n\n431(20)(A)(iii).     We thus find the use of \"promoting,\" \"support,\"\n\nand \"opposition\" in §§ 1019-B and 1052 clear enough to \"give the\n\nperson of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know\n\nwhat is prohibited.\"    Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108.\n\nB.   \"Influencing\"\n\n            The term \"influencing\" (appearing also as \"influence\")\n\npresents a closer question.42 The district court held \"influencing\"\n\n\n     42\n       \"Influencing\" appears in a number of places throughout the\nstatutes challenged by NOM. These include: the definition of a\nnon-major-purpose PAC, Me. Rev. Stat. 21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(5)\n(defining non-major-purpose PAC to mean an entity that crosses the\nrequisite threshold of contributions or expenditures \"for the\npurpose of promoting, defeating or influencing in any way\" a\ncandidate election (emphasis added)); the out-of-state PAC\nprovision, id. § 1053-B (providing that an out-of-state PAC need\nnot register if, among other things, it \"has not raised and\naccepted any contributions during the calendar year to influence an\nelection or campaign in [Maine]\" (emphasis added)); the attribution\nand disclaimer provision, id. § 1014(2-A) (clarifying that\ndisclaimer and attribution requirements do not apply to\ncommunications made shortly before an election that name or depict\na candidate \"if the communication was not made for the purpose of\n\n                                    -56-\n\fto be unconstitutionally vague and severed it from the various\n\nstatutes challenged here.       On appeal, defendants urge that we find\n\n\"influencing\" sufficiently clear to avoid due process concerns.\n\nNOM, in turn, contends that the district court erred in severing\n\n\"influencing,\"     suggesting    that    we   should    find    the   statutes\n\nunconstitutional    in   their    entirety.      Because       we   agree   with\n\ndefendants that the use of \"influencing\" in the statutes before us\n\nis, when given a properly limited meaning, not unconstitutionally\n\nvague, we need not reach the question of severance.\n\n          In   arguing   that    \"influencing\"     is    unconstitutionally\n\nvague, NOM relies on the Supreme Court's construction of similar\n\nlanguage in Buckley v. Valeo.           The relevant portion of Buckley\n\nconcerned a disclosure requirement applicable to anyone \"'who makes\n\ncontributions or expenditures' aggregating over $100 in a calendar\n\nyear.\"   Buckley, 424 U.S. at 74-75 (quoting 2 U.S.C. § 434(e)).\n\nThe statute defined \"expenditures\" to include \"the use of money or\n\nother valuable assets 'for the purpose of . . . influencing' the\n\n\n\ninfluencing the candidate's . . . election\" (emphasis added)); the\nindependent expenditure provision, id. § 1019-B(2) (providing that\na person presumed to have made an independent expenditure may rebut\nthe presumption by filing a statement that \"the cost was not\nincurred with the intent to influence the nomination, election or\ndefeat of a candidate\" (emphasis added)); and the definitions of\n\"expenditure\" used in connection with the attribution and\ndisclaimer, independent expenditure, and PAC provisions, id. §§\n1012(3) (defining \"expenditure\" to include giving something of\nvalue \"for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of\nany person to political office\" (emphasis added)), 1052(4)(A)(1)\n(same).\n\n                                   -57-\n\fnomination or election of candidates for federal office.\"                             Id. at\n\n77    (quoting     2    U.S.C.       §   431(f)).     The      Court     noted   that    the\n\n\"ambiguity\" of the phrase \"for the purpose of influencing\" \"poses\n\nconstitutional           problems\"        and    \"raises       serious        problems    of\n\nvagueness,\" id. at 76-77, in that it had the \"potential for\n\nencompassing both issue discussion and advocacy of a political\n\nresult,\" id. at 79.              This was, of course, the same concern the\n\nCourt raised with respect to the phrase \"relative to a candidate\"\n\nin    FECA's independent expenditures cap, and the Court reached an\n\nidentical solution.             The Court skirted its constitutional concerns\n\nby    imposing      a        limiting     construction      on     the    definition      of\n\nexpenditure \"to reach only funds used for communications that\n\nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified\n\ncandidate.\"        Id. at 80 (footnote omitted).\n\n             NOM's       argument        that   Buckley     dictates      a    finding    of\n\nvagueness here is flawed on several counts.                      First, as more recent\n\nSupreme Court precedents have made clear, Buckley's narrowing\n\ninterpretation of the phrase \"for the purpose of influencing\" \"was\n\nthe    product          of     statutory        interpretation          rather    than     a\n\nconstitutional command.\"                 McConnell, 540 U.S. at 192.             The Court\n\nnever squarely held in Buckley that the term \"influencing\" was\n\nunconstitutionally vague under due process standards, and the\n\nconstitutional concern that prompted the Court to narrow the term\n\n--    the   fear    that       the   statute     might    be     read    to   reach   issue\n\n\n                                             -58-\n\fdiscussion -- is, as we have said, not a relevant one for review of\n\ndisclosure laws.    Second, even if Buckley were to have found\n\n\"influencing\" unconstitutionally vague in FECA, it would not be\n\ndispositive of the question here.      Terms claimed to be vague must\n\nbe interpreted in light of their precise statutory context, see URI\n\nStudent Senate v. Town of Narragansett, 631 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2011); Welch v. United States, 750 F.2d 1101, 1112 (1st Cir. 1985),\n\nand thus a phrase deemed problematic in federal election statutes\n\nmight not run afoul of vagueness standards in Maine's statutes.\n\n          Nonetheless,    Buckley's     concerns   aside,   the   term\n\n\"influencing\" does present some vagueness problems.         The other\n\ncandidate-related terms employed by the statutes here -- such as\n\n\"promoting,\" \"opposition,\" \"defeat,\" and \"support,\" Me. Rev. Stat.\n\ntit. 21-A, §§ 1019-B(3)(B), 1052(4)(A)(1), (5)(A)(5) -- are more\n\nplainly result-oriented, focusing on advocacy for or against a\n\nparticular candidacy. Influence, on the other hand, covers a wider\n\nrange of objectives.     Conceivably falling within the meaning of\n\n\"influence\" are objectives as varied as advocacy for or against a\n\ncandidate's election; championing an issue for inclusion in a\n\ncandidate's platform; and encouraging all candidates to embrace\n\npublic funding.    Without more context, we believe the intended\n\nmeaning of \"influence\" to be uncertain enough that a person of\n\naverage intelligence would be forced to \"'guess at its meaning and\n\nmodes of application.'\"      Councilman, 418 F.3d at 84 (quoting\n\n\n                                -59-\n\fHussein, 351 F.3d at 14).\n\n          Arguing    that    the    statutes'       use   of   \"influencing\"     is\n\nadequately clear, defendants point us to the interpretive canon of\n\nnoscitur a sociis, which provides that an ambiguous statutory term\n\nmay be \"given more precise content by the neighboring words with\n\nwhich it is associated.\"         Williams, 553 U.S. at 294.           For example,\n\nin the non-major-purpose PAC definition, defendants suggest that\n\n\"influencing\" should be given a meaning similar to or consistent\n\nwith \"promoting\" and \"defeating.\"           See Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, §\n\n1052(5)(A)(5)    (\"for     the    purpose     of    promoting,       defeating   or\n\ninfluencing in any way\").         This argument fails for two reasons.\n\n          First, \"influencing\" appears on its own in some of the\n\nstatutes before us, thus defeating the noscitur a sociis exercise\n\nfor those provisions.       See, e.g., id. § 1014(2-A) (\"The disclosure\n\nis not required if the communication was not made for the purpose\n\nof   influencing    the    candidate's        nomination       for   election    or\n\nelection.\").    Second, in those statutes where \"influencing\" is\n\npaired with other terms, we find more persuasive the countervailing\n\ninterpretive    canon     counseling    that    a   statute     should    \"'be   so\n\nconstrued that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or\n\nword shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.'\"                  TRW Inc. v.\n\nAndrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001) (quoting Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S.\n\n167, 174 (2001)).       Our interpretation is guided by the fact that,\n\neven where it appears with other terms, \"influencing\" appears to\n\n\n                                       -60-\n\fhave been intentionally set apart.                      For example, the relevant\n\nlanguage of § 1052(5)(A)(5) reads \"for the purpose of promoting,\n\ndefeating or influencing in any way;\" the addition of \"in any way\"\n\nlogically gives \"influencing\" a broader sweep than the foregoing\n\nterms.    The differentiation is even more apparent in the PAC\n\nstatute's definition of expenditure, where the term \"influencing\"\n\nappears in a different clause and is given a different (though\n\nrelated) object from the other terms.                        See Me. Rev. Stat. tit.\n\n21-A, § 1052(4)(A)(1) (defining expenditure to cover the transfer\n\nof anything of value \"for the purpose of influencing the nomination\n\nor   election   of    any     person   to     political         office;      or    for    the\n\ninitiation,     support       or   defeat    of     a    campaign,     referendum          or\n\ninitiative.\").       The natural inference from this separation is that\n\nthe drafters intended \"influencing\" to carry a different meaning\n\nfrom the words with which it appears.\n\n            Despite     their      continued       insistence       that     the    use    of\n\n\"influencing\"    in     the    statutes      here       is    not   vague,    defendants\n\nrecognize     that     we,     like    the        district       court,      might       find\n\n\"influencing\" insufficiently clear on its face to satisfy due\n\nprocess standards.        Therefore, as a fallback position, defendants\n\noffer a     narrowing     construction        that      has    been   adopted       by    the\n\nCommission with respect to a separate statute regulating ballot\n\nquestion committees.           In written guidance, the Commission has\n\nclarified    that it      interprets        the    phrase \"for        the    purpose       of\n\n\n                                        -61-\n\finitiating, promoting, defeating or influencing in any way a\n\ncampaign,\" Me.

Comm'n on Governmental Ethics & Elections Practices,\n\nGuidance on Reporting as a Ballot Question Committee, available at\n\nhttp://www.maine.gov/ethics/bqcs/guidance.htm (last visited July\n\n25, 2011).         This narrowing construction was not offered to the\n\ndistrict court.43             However, there is no barrier to our considering\n\nit here -- and, indeed, we are required to do so.                             See Hoffman\n\nEstates, 455 U.S. at 494 n.5 (\"In evaluating a facial challenge to\n\na state law, a federal court must . . . consider any limiting\n\nconstruction           that    a   state   court     or    enforcement        agency   has\n\nproffered.\").\n\n                 As narrowed, the terms \"influencing\" and \"influence,\" as\n\nused        in   the    statutes     at     issue     here,      would    include      only\n\n\n       43\n       The Maine Attorney General had offered in prior litigation\nbefore the district court a narrowing construction limiting the\nterm \"influencing\" to express advocacy. See Volle v. Webster, 69\nF. Supp. 2d 171, 175 (D. Me. 1999). In light of the fact that\nSupreme Court precedent subsequent to that litigation \"made clear\nthat the state may regulate speech other than express advocacy,\"\nthe Attorney General believed that the narrowing construction was\n\"no longer required\" and therefore did not offer it in the\nproceedings below.\n\n                                            -62-\n\f\"communications and activities that expressly advocate for or\n\nagainst [a candidate] or that clearly identify a candidate by\n\napparent and unambiguous reference and are susceptible of no\n\nreasonable interpretation other than to promote or oppose the\n\ncandidate.\" This narrowed formulation is considerably more precise\n\nthan the original, and succeeds both in \"provid[ing] explicit\n\nstandards for those who apply\" the provisions at issue here and in\n\nensuring that persons of average intelligence will have reasonable\n\nnotice of the provisions' coverage.   Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108.   We\n\nthus conclude that the provisions' use of the terms \"influencing\"\n\nand \"influence,\" so limited, is not so vague as to offend due\n\nprocess.\n\nC.   \"Initiation\"\n\n           Among the statutes at issue in this appeal, the term\n\n\"initiation\" appears only in the PAC statute's definition of\n\n\"expenditure.\"44    NOM offers no support for its argument that\n\n\"initiation\" is vague, contending only that \"initiation\" \"fare[s]\n\nno better\" than the other terms challenged on vagueness grounds.\n\nWe find \"initiation\" to be adequately clear.       The context --\n\ndefining \"expenditure\" to include giving something of value \"for\n\n\n\n     44\n       The statute defines \"expenditure\" to include the transfer\nof something of value \"for the initiation, support or defeat of a\ncampaign, referendum or initiative.\"   Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, §\n1052(4)(A)(1) (emphasis added). NOM also challenges the use of\n\"initiating\" in the definition of a major-purpose PAC, but we have\nheld that it lacks standing to pursue that claim.\n\n                               -63-\n\fthe    initiation     .   .   .   of   a    campaign\"    --   makes   plain    that\n\n\"initiation\" is being used as the noun form of the verb \"initiate,\"\n\nthe primary definition of which is \"to begin, set going, or\n\noriginate.\"        The Random House Dictionary of the English Language\n\n982 (2d ed. unabr. 1987).              Used in this way, the language is\n\nunequivocal, and easily would put an individual of average aptitude\n\non notice that the act of incurring an expense for the purpose of\n\nbeginning an electoral campaign will constitute an \"expenditure\"\n\nwithin the meaning of § 1052(4)(A)(1).                 See Grayned, 408 U.S. at\n\n108.    NOM's argument that \"initiation\" is unconstitutionally vague\n\nthus fails.\n\nD.    Use of Context in Definition of \"Expressly Advocate\"\n\n             NOM's final vagueness argument is somewhat distinct from\n\nthe preceding ones.           While NOM's claim focuses on the phrase\n\n\"expressly advocate\" in the independent expenditure statute,45 NOM\n\ndoes not contend that the phrase itself is unconstitutionally\n\nvague.      Instead, NOM argues that Maine's definition of \"expressly\n\nadvocate,\" set forth in regulations promulgated by the Commission,\n\nrenders      the   term   vague    because        it   invites   reliance     on   a\n\ncommunication's context and employs a purportedly unconstitutional\n\n\n       45\n       The statute defines an \"independent expenditure\" to be one\n\"that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly\nidentified candidate.\" Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1019-B(1)(A).\nThough the attribution and disclaimer provisions also use the\nphrase \"expressly advocating,\" see id. § 1014(1), the regulations\nchallenged here relate solely to the definition of an \"independent\nexpenditure.\"\n\n                                           -64-\n\f\"appeal-to-vote\" formulation for determining what qualifies as\n\nexpress advocacy.     Specifically, the regulations provide that a\n\ncommunication will be considered to \"expressly advocate\" when it\n\nemploys phrases that \"in context can have no other reasonable\n\nmeaning than to urge the election or defeat of one or more clearly\n\nidentified    candidate(s),   such     as   posters,     bumper     stickers,\n\nadvertisements, etc. which say 'Pick Berry,' 'Harris in 2000,'\n\n'Murphy/Stevens'    or   'Canavan!'\"        94-270-001    Me.     Code   R.   §\n\n10(2)(B).46   As we explain, NOM's arguments read far too much into\n\na limited line of Supreme Court precedents, and provide no basis\n\nfor concluding that Maine's regulations are unconstitutionally\n\nvague.\n\n            NOM's arguments have their roots in the recent trio of\n\n\n\n     46\n          The full text of the definition is as follows:\n\n     \"Expressly advocate\" means any communication that uses\n     phrases such as \"vote for the Governor,\" \"reelect your\n     Representative,\" \"support the Democratic nominee,\" \"cast\n     your ballot for the Republican challenger for Senate\n     District 1,\" \"Jones for House of Representatives,\" \"Jean\n     Smith in 2002,\" \"vote Pro-Life\" or \"vote Pro-Choice\"\n     accompanied by a listing of clearly identified candidates\n     described as Pro-Life or Pro-Choice, \"vote against Old\n     Woody,\" \"defeat\" accompanied by a picture of one or more\n     candidate(s), \"reject the incumbent,\" or communications\n     of campaign slogan(s) or individual word(s), which in\n     context can have no other reasonable meaning than to urge\n     the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified\n     candidate(s),   such   as   posters,   bumper   stickers,\n     advertisements, etc. which say \"Pick Berry,\" \"Harris in\n     2000,\" \"Murphy/Stevens\" or \"Canavan!\".\n\n94-270-001 Me. Code R. § 10(2)(B).\n\n                                 -65-\n\fSupreme Court cases addressing the constitutionality of the federal\n\nprohibition of independent expenditures by corporations and unions\n\nfor \"electioneering\" communications -- those made shortly before a\n\nprimary or general election that clearly identify a candidate for\n\nfederal office.        The trio began with McConnell, in which the Court\n\nupheld the electioneering provision against a facial overbreadth\n\nchallenge.    In so doing, the Court found unavailing the contention\n\nthat the provision would regulate a substantial amount of issue\n\nadvocacy, noting that the argument \"fail[ed] to the extent that the\n\nissue ads broadcast during the [relevant period] are the functional\n\nequivalent of express advocacy.\"          McConnell, 540 U.S. at 206.\n\n            This conditional assertion was put to the test several\n\nyears     later   in    Wisconsin    Right   to    Life,    when   the    Court,\n\nentertaining      an    as-applied    challenge    to      the   electioneering\n\nprovision,    considered     whether     several   specific      advertisements\n\nqualified as the \"functional equivalent of express advocacy.\"                 The\n\nCourt concluded they did not, and accordingly held the provision\n\nunconstitutional in its application.          Along the way, the principal\n\nopinion made two points relevant to NOM's arguments here.                 First,\n\nit suggested that an advertisement would qualify as the \"functional\n\nequivalent of express advocacy,\" and thereby could be regulated\n\nwithout    triggering      overbreadth     concerns,    only     when    it   \"is\n\nsusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal\n\n\n\n\n                                      -66-\n\fto vote for or against a specific candidate.\"47 Wis. Right to Life,\n\n551 U.S. at 469-70. NOM refers to this formulation as the \"appeal-\n\nto-vote test.\"      Second, the Court criticized efforts to use the\n\nadvertisements' context to determine whether they qualified as the\n\n\"'functional      equivalent'    of    express       advocacy,\"   noting    that\n\n\"contextual factors of the sort invoked [there] should seldom play\n\na significant role in the inquiry.\"           Id. at 473-74.\n\n           Most recently, the Court concluded in Citizens United\n\nthat Congress could not limit the campaign-related speech of\n\ncorporations and unions and thus held the electioneering provision\n\nunconstitutional, overturning McConnell. Citizens United provides\n\nthe   launching    point   for   NOM's       first    argument    that    Maine's\n\ndefinition of \"expressly advocate\" is vague.               NOM contends that\n\nCitizens   United     eliminated      \"the     appeal-to-vote      test    as   a\n\nconstitutional limit on government power,\" and reads into this an\n\nimplicit holding that the test was unconstitutionally vague.\n\n           NOM's reading finds no support in the text of Citizens\n\nUnited, though we agree with NOM that, in striking down the federal\n\nelectioneering expenditure statute, Citizens United eliminated the\n\n\n\n\n      47\n        En route to this test, the principal opinion rejected\nproposed intent- and effect-based standards, i.e. frameworks that\nwould have required inquiry into the intent of the speaker to\naffect an election or an examination of the actual effect the\nspeech would have on an election or on its target audience. Wis.\nRight to Life, 551 U.S. at 467-69.\n\n                                      -67-\n\fcontext in which the appeal-to-vote test has had any significance.48\n\nIt is a large and unsubstantiated jump, however, to read Citizens\n\nUnited as casting doubt on the constitutionality of any statute or\n\nregulation using language similar to the appeal-to-vote test to\n\ndefine the scope of its coverage.      The basis for Citizens United's\n\nholding on the constitutionality of the electioneering expenditure\n\nstatute had nothing to do with the appeal-to-vote test or the\n\ndivide between express and issue advocacy.        Instead, the decision\n\nturned on a reconsideration of prior case law holding that a\n\ncorporation's   political   speech     may   be   subjected   to   greater\n\nregulation than an individual's.     See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat 886.   The opinion offered no view on the clarity of the appeal-\n\nto-vote test.   In fact, the Court itself relied on the appeal-to-\n\nvote test in disposing of a threshold argument that the appeal\n\nshould be resolved on narrower, as-applied grounds.           See id. at\n\n889-90    (applying   appeal-to-vote     test     in   determining   that\n\nadvertisements at issue were the functional equivalent of express\n\nadvocacy).\n\n\n\n     48\n       We do not agree, however, with NOM's characterization of the\nappeal-to-vote test, or any of the other tests proposed by the\nCourt for distinguishing between express and issue advocacy, as a\n\"constitutional limit on government power.\" Citizens United made\nclear that at least some forms of regulation may reach issue\nadvocacy, see 130 S. Ct. at 915, and there are substantial\nquestions as to whether the line between issue advocacy and express\nadvocacy is constitutionally rooted, see McConnell, 540 U.S. at 193\n(noting doubts that \"the First Amendment erects a rigid barrier\nbetween express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy\").\n\n                                -68-\n\f                We find similarly misguided NOM's argument that the\n\ndefinition of \"expressly advocate\" is vague due to the regulation's\n\nreference        to     consideration       of   an      advertisement's            words   \"in\n\ncontext.\"       NOM misinterprets Wisconsin Right to Life in suggesting\n\nthat the principal opinion barred all consideration of context to\n\ndetermine whether an advertisement was the functional equivalent of\n\nexpress        advocacy.        To    the   contrary,          the     opinion      explicitly\n\nacknowledges          that    \"[c]ourts     need    not    ignore         basic     background\n\ninformation that may be necessary to put an ad in context.\"                                 Wis.\n\nRight to Life, 551 U.S. at 474.49                It is apparent from the examples\n\nprovided by the regulation here -- \"'Pick Berry,' 'Harris in 2000,'\n\n'Murphy/Stevens' or 'Canavan!'\" -- that \"knowing that Berry is a\n\ncandidate to be picked on the ballot, that 2000 is an election\n\nwhere Harris should win, etc.,\" Nat'l Org. for Marriage, 723 F.\n\nSupp.     2d    at     266,   is    precisely      the    sort       of   basic     background\n\ninformation           that    may    be   consulted       in     the      express    advocacy\n\ndetermination.\n\n                In any event, we find the regulation's definition of\n\n\"expressly advocate,\" as a whole, to be sufficiently clear to\n\n\n\n     49\n        In Citizens United, the Court also relied on contextual\nfactors in determining that the communication at issue -- a ninety-\nminute documentary about Hillary Clinton -- constituted the\nfunctional equivalent of express advocacy. See 130 S. Ct. at 890\n(\"In light of historical footage, interviews with persons critical\nof her, and voiceover narration, the film would be understood by\nmost viewers as an extended criticism of Senator Clinton's\ncharacter and her fitness for the office of the Presidency.\").\n\n                                            -69-\n\fsatisfy due process.           The definition offers abundant examples\n\n(fourteen in all) of the sorts of language that will constitute\n\nexpress advocacy, and, as we have noted before, \"[t]he existence of\n\nclear examples of conduct covered by a law may . . . help to\n\ninsulate the law against an accusation of vagueness.\"                 URI Student\n\nSenate, 631 F.3d at 14; see also Hotel & Motel Ass'n v. City of\n\nOakland, 344 F.3d 959, 972–73 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding ordinance\n\nprovided sufficient notice where it listed \"no less than nineteen\n\nspecific examples of the types of conduct to which th[e] provision\n\napplie[d]\").      Moreover, the phrase set forth in the regulation --\n\n\"can have no other reasonable meaning than to urge the election or\n\ndefeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s)\" -- is\n\ncertainly as clear, if not more so, as words such as \"support\" and\n\n\"promote\"   that     the   Supreme      Court    has   held     non-vague.       See\n\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64; see also Wis. Right to Life, 551\n\nU.S. at 474 n.7 (explaining that the appeal-to-vote formulation\n\nmeets the \"imperative for clarity\" in regulation of political\n\nspeech). We therefore reject NOM's arguments that the regulation's\n\ndefinition of the phrase \"expressly advocate\" is unconstitutionally\n\nvague.\n\n      V.    Challenge to the District Court's Unsealing Order\n\n            The    remaining    issue    in     this   appeal    is   whether    the\n\ndistrict court erred in ruling that the trial record must be\n\nunsealed.         Reviewing    the   court's      unsealing      order   under     a\n\n\n                                        -70-\n\fdeferential standard, see Siedle v. Putnam Invs., Inc., 147 F.3d 7,\n\n10 (1st Cir. 1998) (unsealing orders are reviewed \"only for mistake\n\nof law or abuse of discretion\"), we find no abuse of discretion.\n\n          Decisions on the sealing of judicial documents require a\n\nbalancing of interests, although the scales tilt decidedly toward\n\ntransparency.    The starting point must always be the common-law\n\npresumption in favor of public access to judicial records.     See\n\nNixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978); Siedle,\n\n147 F.3d at 9.

That said, \"the\n\npresumption is nonetheless strong and sturdy,\" and thus \"'[o]nly\n\nthe most compelling reasons can justify non-disclosure of judicial\n\nrecords.'\"   Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d at 410 (alteration\n\nin original) (quoting In re Knoxville News-Sentinel Co., 723 F.2d\n\n\n                               -71-\n\f470, 476 (6th Cir. 1983)).\n\n           Portions of the trial record here were initially filed in\n\nsealed form, albeit by the parties' stipulation rather than court\n\norder.50   Following trial, the district court issued sua sponte an\n\norder to show cause why the entire record should not be filed in\n\npublicly accessible form.        NOM responded with a brief arguing,\n\ninter alia, that disclosure of certain of its strategic documents\n\nincluded in the record would severely burden NOM's ability to\n\neffectively engage in protected political activities, and would\n\ninvade the privacy of NOM's third-party service providers and\n\ncontractors identified in the record and risk subjecting them to\n\nharassment.     The district court found NOM's arguments unavailing\n\nand ordered the record unsealed such that it would be \"public in\n\nprecisely the way that it would have been had live witnesses been\n\ncalled to testify.\"       Nat'l Org. for Marriage, 723 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n249 n.4.    We granted an emergency motion to stay the unsealing\n\norder during the pendency of this appeal.\n\n           On   appeal,    NOM   fields   two   arguments   for   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.     It first argues that the district court erred in\n\n\n\n     50\n        In the course of discovery, the parties entered into a\nconfidentiality agreement, which was entered as a consent order by\nthe magistrate judge overseeing discovery matters. That consent\norder required, among other things, that any documents designated\nconfidential that were filed with the court be submitted under\nseal. In subsequently stipulating to a joint trial record, the\nparties included a number of documents that had previously been\nfiled under seal pursuant to the consent order.\n\n                                   -72-\n\funsealing the documents without a \"finding of true necessity.\"\n\nNOM's     argument   flips   the   proper    analysis   on    its   head.   The\n\npresumption here favors openness, and a court need make no finding,\n\nlet alone one of \"true necessity,\" in order to make the proceedings\n\nand documents in a civil trial public.            Instead, it is the party\n\nseeking to keep documents sealed who must make a showing sufficient\n\nto overcome the presumption of public access.                See Standard Fin.\n\nMgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d at 411.               Second, NOM suggests that the\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to consider a number of controlling\n\nlegal principles.      On examination, the authorities it cites are,\n\nwithout exception, inapposite.51\n\n\n     51\n        For example, NOM cites cases involving the validity of a\nfederal regulation that required release of materials compiled by\nthe FEC during investigations into alleged election law violations,\nsee Am. Fed'n of Labor & Cong. of Indus. Orgs. v. FEC, 333 F.3d 168\n(D.C. Cir. 2003), and a claim of First Amendment privilege against\nthe compelled disclosure of internal documents pursuant to a court\norder enforcing a discovery request, see Perry v. Schwarzenegger,\n591 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir. 2010). Those cases involved the possible\ncompelled disclosure of information to which there was no\npresumptive right of public access; here, in contrast, the\ndocuments at issue were voluntarily included in the record filed\nwith the district court, and thus subject to a presumption of\npublic access.\n     NOM also contends that the two-step inquiry set forth in\nPress-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1, 8 (1986), must\nbe applied to determine whether the documents here are within the\npublic's presumptive right of access. That inquiry relates to the\ncategorical determination of whether a particular type of\nproceeding or class of court documents falls within the public's\nright of access, see In re Bos. Herald, Inc., 321 F.3d 174, 182-83\n(1st Cir. 2003); it does not govern whether individual documents\nfiled with a court should be made public. NOM does not contest\nthat the right of public access extends to the trial record in a\ncivil matter, Siedle, 147 F.3d at 10, and thus Press-Enterprise's\ntwo-step inquiry is inapplicable.\n\n                                     -73-\n\f              On the record before us, we cannot conclude that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in ordering the trial record\n\nunsealed.       While       NOM claims    harm from      disclosure   of   certain\n\nstrategic documents, neither before the district court nor in this\n\nappeal has NOM identified any specific information that, if made\n\npublic, would damage or chill its political advocacy efforts.\n\nIndeed, the documents it identifies as particularly sensitive,\n\nincluding a strategic planning document it terms its \"playbook,\"\n\ndisclose primarily advocacy priorities and expenditures in past\n\nelection cycles, and we see little among them that could advantage\n\nNOM's opponents going forward.             NOM's claims that its contractors\n\nand service-providers could be subject to harassment also lack\n\nsupport, resting upon allegations of harassment against a vendor\n\nthat performed work for supporters of California's Proposition 8.\n\nWhile \"'privacy rights of participants and third parties[] are\n\namong those interests which, in appropriate cases, can limit the\n\npresumptive right of access to judicial records,'\" Standard Fin.\n\nMgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d at 411 (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(quoting In re Knoxville News-Sentinel Co., 723 F.2d at 478), NOM\n\nfailed   to    make     a    compelling    case   that   the   specific    vendors\n\nreferenced in the documents here have any reasonable privacy\n\nconcerns relating to the disclosure of their business relationship\n\nwith NOM.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -74-\n\f                         VI.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the portion of\n\nthe district court's judgment finding the terms \"influencing\" and\n\n\"influence\" unconstitutionally vague, remand for entry of judgment\n\nin defendants' favor in full on those claims, and affirm the\n\njudgment in all other respects.     We also vacate our stay of the\n\ndistrict court's unsealing order.     Costs shall be awarded to the\n\nappellees.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -75-\n\f",

This appeal requires us to address\n\nthe constitutionality of several Maine election laws governing,\n\ninter    alia,     the    registration     of       political    action       committees\n\n(\"PACs\") and the disclosure and reporting of information about\n\nexpenditures       made    for    election-related          advocacy.1         Appellant\n\nNational Organization for Marriage (\"NOM\"), a New Jersey-based\n\nnonprofit    corporation         organized     for    the     purpose    of   providing\n\n\"organized opposition to same-sex marriage in state legislatures,\"\n\ncontends    that    Maine's       laws   are    unconstitutionally            vague   and\n\noverbroad.       Claiming a chill of its First Amendment-protected\n\nadvocacy efforts in Maine, NOM brought a facial and as-applied\n\nchallenge seeking an injunction against the laws' enforcement and\n\na declaration of their unconstitutionality.                    On summary judgment,\n\nthe district court largely rejected NOM's claims, agreeing only\n\nthat the phrase \"for the purpose of influencing,\" which the court\n\nsevered     from     the    provisions         in     which     it   appeared,        was\n\nunconstitutionally vague.2\n\n            NOM renews here its arguments challenging Maine's laws on\n\nvagueness and overbreadth grounds.                    NOM asks as well that we\n\nreverse a ruling by the district court unsealing the trial record.\n\n\n     1\n       In a companion opinion filed today, we consider appellant's\nchallenges to a related provision of Rhode Island's election laws.\nSee Nat'l Org. for Marriage v. Daluz, No. 10-2304 (1st Cir. 2011).\n     2\n       The court also held unconstitutional a regulation governing\nthe timing of disclosures. That holding is not at issue in this\nappeal.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fIn turn, the defendants (various Maine officials) contend that the\n\ndistrict court erred in finding vague, and severing from Maine's\n\nstatutes, the phrase \"for the purpose of influencing.\"\n\n            After careful consideration of the parties' arguments and\n\nkey precedents, we conclude that Maine's laws pass constitutional\n\nmuster.     Central to our holding is the nature of the laws NOM\n\nchallenges here.      These provisions neither erect a barrier to\n\npolitical speech nor limit its quantity.            Rather, they promote the\n\ndissemination of information about those who deliver and finance\n\npolitical speech, thereby encouraging efficient operation of the\n\nmarketplace of ideas. As the Supreme Court recently observed, such\n\ncompulsory \"transparency enables the electorate to make informed\n\ndecisions    and   give     proper   weight    to   different    speakers     and\n\nmessages.\"     Citizens United v.

We otherwise affirm the district\n\ncourt's judgment in its entirety.\n\n                 I.   Statutory and Procedural Background\n\nA.   Maine's Election Laws\n\n            Maine has enacted a comprehensive set of election laws\n\nthat embraces, among other things, contribution limits, a public\n\nfinancing system for state-office candidates, and various reporting\n\nand disclosure requirements for those engaged in election-related\n\nadvocacy.    We have previously described the contribution limit and\n\npublic financing aspects of Maine's regulation of elections --\n\nwhich are not at issue here -- in some detail.                See Daggett v.\n\nComm'n on Governmental Ethics & Election Practices, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767873\"><a href=\"/opinion/767873/beverly-c-daggett-elaine-fuller-christopher-m-harte-mark-t-cenci/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n450-52 (1st Cir. 2000).          The provisions challenged here, all\n\nrelating solely to reporting and disclosure, fall into three\n\ncategories: rules governing PACs, rules governing \"independent\n\nexpenditures,\" and general attribution and disclaimer requirements.\n\n            1.   PAC Provisions\n\n            Maine's    PAC   provisions   are,   as   the    appellees   aptly\n\ncharacterize them, \"pure disclosure laws.\"                  Maine imposes no\n\nlimitation on the amount of money PACs may raise, nor does it cap\n\nthe sum a PAC may spend independently of a candidate or candidate\n\ncommittee.    If they contribute money directly to a candidate, PACs\n\nare subject to the same per-candidate contribution limits -- $750\n\nper election for gubernatorial candidates and $350 per election for\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\flegislative candidates -- as any other donor.              See Me. Rev. Stat.\n\ntit. 21-A, § 1015(1), (2).               The only PAC-specific requirements\n\nrelate to registration, recordkeeping, and reporting.\n\n           An organization may qualify as a PAC under Maine law in\n\none of several ways, of which two are relevant here.                 The first\n\npertains to so-called \"major-purpose\" PACs.              An organization that\n\n\"has as its major purpose initiating, promoting, defeating or\n\ninfluencing a candidate election, campaign or ballot question\" must\n\nregister as a PAC in Maine if it receives contributions or makes\n\nexpenditures aggregating more than $1,500 in a given calendar year\n\nfor that purpose.      Id. §§ 1052(5)(A)(4), 1053.         The second relates\n\nto \"non-major-purpose PACs,\" which are subject to a significantly\n\nhigher   contribution/expenditure           threshold    for   registration.\n\nSpecifically, Maine law requires that an organization register as\n\na PAC if it \"does not have as its major purpose promoting,\n\ndefeating or influencing candidate elections but . . . receives\n\ncontributions or makes expenditures aggregating more than $5,000 in\n\na   calendar   year   for       the   purpose   of   promoting,   defeating   or\n\ninfluencing in any way the nomination or election of any candidate\n\nto political office.\"           Id. §§ 1052(5)(A)(5), 1053.\n\n           Within seven days of exceeding the relevant contribution\n\nor expenditure threshold, a PAC must register with the Maine\n\nCommission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices (the\n\n\"Commission\").        Id.   §    1053.     Registration requires      that the\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\forganization supply a name and address for the PAC; identify its\n\nform of organization and date of origin; name its treasurer,\n\nprincipal officers, and primary fundraisers and decisionmakers; and\n\nindicate which candidates, committees, referenda, or campaigns it\n\nsupports or opposes.          Id.   An organization need not make any formal\n\nchanges, such as forming a separate legal entity or creating a\n\nsegregated fund, to operate as a PAC in Maine.\n\n            Once      registered,      a    PAC    is    subject       to    two   ongoing\n\nobligations      under    Maine     law.      First,      the    PAC    treasurer      must\n\nmaintain records         of   certain      election-related        expenditures         and\n\ncontributions for four years following the election to which the\n\nrecords pertain.         Id. § 1057.       Second, the PAC must electronically\n\nfile campaign finance reports on a quarterly basis, with additional\n\nreports due eleven days before any primary or general election and\n\nforty-two days after.          Id. § 1059.        The contents of the report vary\n\nby type of PAC.        A major-purpose PAC must report any contribution\n\nto   the   PAC   of    more    than    $50    (including         the    name,      address,\n\noccupation, and place of business of the contributor), while a non-\n\nmajor-purpose PAC reports only those contributions made \"for the\n\npurpose of promoting, defeating or influencing a ballot question or\n\nthe nomination or election of a candidate to political office.\"\n\nId. § 1060(6).        The reporting of expenditures breaks down along\n\nsimilar    lines:      major-purpose         PACs       report    all       expenditures,\n\nincluding operational and administrative expenses, whereas non-\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fmajor-purpose PACs report \"only those expenditures made for the\n\npurpose of promoting, defeating or influencing a ballot question or\n\nthe nomination or election of a candidate to political office.\"\n\nId. § 1060(4), (5), (7).\n\n            Maine     law     also   explicitly            requires      PACs    that    are\n\norganized     in    another      state     to        comply     with     all    applicable\n\nregistration and reporting requirements.                    See id. § 1053-B.           There\n\nis, however, a narrow exemption: out-of-state PACs may contribute\n\nto   candidates,      party      committees,         and    PACs    in    Maine    without\n\nregistering        with    the    Commission,           provided       that     (1)     such\n\ncontributions are the out-of-state PAC's only financial activity\n\nwithin Maine and (2) the out-of-state PAC \"has not raised and\n\naccepted any contributions during the calendar year to influence an\n\nelection or campaign\" in Maine.             Id.\n\n            2.     \"Independent Expenditure\" Provision\n\n            In addition to its PAC-specific requirements, Maine's\n\nelection laws also require across-the-board reporting of certain\n\n\"independent expenditures.\"              At a general level, an \"independent\n\nexpenditure\" is any payment or obligation made \"for the purpose of\n\ninfluencing the nomination or election of any person to political\n\noffice\" other than a direct contribution to candidates and their\n\ncampaign committees.             Id. §§    1012(3),           1019-B(1).        Maine    law\n\nprovides    that     any    individual          or     entity      making      independent\n\nexpenditures aggregating more than $100 over the course of a\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fparticular candidacy must file a report with the Commission.                                    Id.\n\n§ 1019-B(3).         That report must simply identify the expenditures by\n\ndate, payee, and purpose, state whether the expenditures were made\n\nin support of or opposition to the relevant candidate, and state\n\nunder oath or affirmation whether the expenditures were coordinated\n\nwith a candidate or candidate committee.                        Id.\n\n                An       expenditure        may     qualify      as        an        \"independent\n\nexpenditure\" in one of two ways.                   First, an expenditure will fall\n\nwithin the independent expenditure reporting requirement where it\n\nis made to finance a communication that \"expressly advocates the\n\nelection or defeat of a clearly identified candidate\" and it is not\n\na direct contribution to a candidate or candidate's committee.3\n\nId.       §    1019-B(1)(A).            Second,        certain         expenditures             for\n\ncommunications made close to an election -- twenty-one days before\n\na primary and thirty-five days before the general election -- are\n\npresumed to be \"independent expenditures.\"                           Id.    The presumption\n\napplies       only       to   an   expenditure      \"made       to    design,         produce    or\n\ndisseminate          a   communication       that    names       or    depicts         a   clearly\n\nidentified candidate\" in a race where at least one candidate has\n\naccepted public financing.                   Id.     § 1019-B(1)(B).                  The person\n\nmaking        the    expenditure       is    afforded       a    chance         to    rebut     the\n\n\n\n      3\n       A candidate will be considered \"clearly identified\" where\nthe name or a depiction of the candidate appears, or where the\n\"identity of the candidate is apparent by unambiguous reference.\"\nMe.

Attribution and Disclaimer Requirements\n\n          Finally,      Maine      law    also      requires       that   political\n\nadvertisements    and     certain    other       political     messages    contain\n\nstatements of attribution and disclaimer.               The governing statute\n\nprovides that any \"communication expressly advocating the election\n\nor defeat of a clearly identified candidate . . . clearly and\n\nconspicuously    state\"    whether       it   has    been    authorized     by     the\n\ncandidate (the disclaimer) and state the name and address of the\n\nperson   who    financed     the     communication          (the    statement      of\n\nattribution).

Sanctions\n\n           The Commission may level a variety of sanctions --\n\nprimarily in the form of fines -- for violations of the provisions\n\ndiscussed above.    An entity that falls within the definition of a\n\nPAC but fails to register may be subject to a civil fine of $250,\n\nid. § 1062-A(1), and a PAC's failure to file reports within thirty\n\ndays of a reporting deadline can result in a fine of up to $10,000\n\nor a criminal misdemeanor charge.         Id. § 1062-A(8).     Likewise,\n\nviolations of the independent expenditure reporting requirement are\n\npunishable by a civil fine of up to $5,000. Id. § 1020-A(5-A)(A).\n\nFinally, violations of the attribution and disclosure requirements\n\nare subject to lesser fines (up to $200 if made within 20 days\n\nbefore an election, and no more than $100 at other times), but may\n\nbe punished by a special fine of up to $5,000 if the violation was\n\ncommitted with the intent to misrepresent the source or candidate\n\nauthorization of the advertisement.       Id. § 1014(4).\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n           NOM filed the initial complaint in this case in October\n\n2009, shortly before a referendum election in Maine on a raft of\n\nissues that included same-sex marriage.5      The complaint challenged\n\n\n     5\n       NOM was joined in its initial complaint by co-plaintiff\nAmerican Principles in Action. The specific claims at issue in\nthis appeal were only pursued by NOM, and, accordingly, American\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe constitutionality of a provision relating to ballot question\n\ncommittees,     Me.   Rev.   Stat.   tit.   21-A,    §     1056-B,6   and   was\n\naccompanied by motions for a temporary restraining order and a\n\npreliminary   injunction.       Following   an   expedited      hearing,    the\n\ndistrict court denied NOM's motion for a temporary restraining\n\norder. NOM subsequently amended its complaint to add the claims at\n\nissue here: those targeting the constitutionality of Maine's PAC\n\nregistration,     independent    expenditure,       and     attribution     and\n\ndisclaimer laws.\n\n          The district court held a hearing on NOM's motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction, consolidated with a bench trial on the\n\nmerits, on August 12, 2010.7         The parties stipulated to a joint\n\ntrial record, which was submitted under seal.             At the hearing, the\n\ndistrict court expressed doubt about the basis for sealing the\n\nrecord, and subsequently issued an order to show cause why the\n\ntrial record should be maintained under seal.\n\n          In a decision issued on August 19, 2010, the district\n\ncourt largely denied NOM's claims and upheld the constitutionality\n\nof the challenged statutes.

Finding that NOM had adequately\n\ndemonstrated an interest in engaging in expressive activity that\n\nwas deterred by the prospect of regulation under Maine's laws, the\n\ncourt held that NOM had standing to challenge the statutes at\n\nissue.8   Id. at 256-58.     On the merits, the court found for NOM on\n\nonly two points.\n\n            First, the court held the phrase \"for the purpose of\n\ninfluencing\" to be unconstitutionally vague, citing the treatment\n\nof similar language in the Supreme Court's opinion in Buckley v.\n\nValeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976).

Id.     The most\n\nsignificant       impact     of    this    holding    was    on     the   independent\n\nexpenditure statute.         Because the rebuttal procedure for presumed\n\nindependent expenditures was dependent on the term \"influencing,\"12\n\nthe court's ruling severed the entire rebuttal procedure.                      Thus,\n\nthe independent       expenditure         presumption      became    conclusive    for\n\nexpenditures for communications clearly identifying a candidate\n\nmade    shortly     before    an    election.        The    court    held   that   the\n\nprovision, as altered, nonetheless passed constitutional muster, as\n\nrecent Supreme Court decisions \"have made the rebuttal exercise\n\npointless.\"       Id. at 265.13\n\n\nnomination, election or defeat of a candidate . . . .\").\n       11\n       See Me.

Rev.   Stat.  tit.   21-A,\n§ 1052(5)(A)(5) -- whereas the independent expenditure rebuttal\nprocedure turned solely on the word \"influence,\" see id. § 1019-\nB(2) (applying to expenditures made \"with the intent to influence\"\ncandidate elections).\n       13\n       The district court reached this conclusion primarily on the\nbasis of Citizens United, which upheld a similar federal-law\ndisclosure provision for advertisements made shortly before an\nelection. The Court ruled that the statute, which contained no\nrebuttal provision analogous to Maine's, passed First Amendment\nmuster in light of a general \"public . . . interest in knowing who\nis speaking about a candidate shortly before an election.\"\n\n                                          -14-\n\f          Second,      the   court     held    one   of   the    implementing\n\nregulations      for     the     independent         expenditure      statute\n\nunconstitutional, finding that it impermissibly burdened First\n\nAmendment speech.      Id. at 266.     The regulation was one of a pair\n\ngoverning the timing of reporting independent expenditures.               The\n\nfirst,   which   the    court    upheld,       required   that   independent\n\nexpenditures of over $100 made within two weeks of an election be\n\nreported to the Commission within twenty-four hours.              See 94-270-\n\n001 Me. Code R. § 10(3)(A).          The second required the reporting\n\nwithin   twenty-four     hours    of     any     independent     expenditures\n\naggregating over $250, regardless of when made.            Id. § 10(3)(B).\n\nFinding the short reporting time frame mandated by both regulations\n\nto be burdensome, the court held that the second regulation, unlike\n\nthe first, could not be justified by a close relationship to \"the\n\nstate's interest in providing information to voters at precisely\n\nthe time that such information can be of greatest use.\"            Nat'l Org.\n\nfor Marriage, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Standing to Challenge Major-Purpose PAC Provision\n\n           It is plain that NOM has no objectively reasonable\n\napprehension of being regulated as a major-purpose PAC.           Among\n\nother things, a major-purpose PAC must have \"as its major purpose\n\ninitiating,   promoting,   defeating   or   influencing   a   candidate\n\nelection, campaign or ballot question\" in Maine.      Me. Rev. Stat.\n\ntit. 21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(4).    NOM identifies itself as a nonprofit\n\nadvocacy organization with a national scope, dedicated to providing\n\n\"organized opposition to same-sex marriage in state legislatures.\"\n\nNOM's advocacy efforts and expenditures have spanned the country,\n\nwith significant expenditures in California, Iowa, New York, and\n\nNew Hampshire, among others.    In 2009, the year of NOM's largest\n\nexpenditures in Maine (made to support repeal of Maine's same-sex\n\nmarriage law), NOM spent $1.8 million in Maine out of $8 million in\n\ntotal expenditures for the year. In light of this record, NOM does\n\nnot have as its \"major purpose\" election advocacy in Maine, and it\n\nis accordingly not subject to regulation as a major-purpose PAC.\n\nNOM therefore lacks standing to challenge § 1052(5)(a)(4).\n\nB.   Standing to Challenge Non-Major-Purpose PAC Provision\n\n           It is a closer question whether the record reveals an\n\nobjectively reasonable possibility that NOM would be regulated as\n\na non-major-purpose PAC under Maine law.     To so qualify, NOM would\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fhave to anticipate receiving contributions or making expenditures\n\nof more than $5,000 in a year \"for the purpose of promoting,\n\ndefeating or influencing in any way the nomination or election of\n\nany candidate to political office.\"         Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, §\n\n1052(5)(A)(5).       The evidence is inconclusive as to whether NOM\n\nactually crossed the $5,000 threshold during the 2010 election\n\ncycle.17    However, we need not determine whether NOM in fact became\n\nsubject to the provision during the relevant period, because NOM\n\nclaims injury based upon self-censorship in anticipation of the\n\nlaw's application to it, and not upon the actual burdens of the\n\nlaw.        NOM's   executive   director,   Brian   Brown,   testified   --\n\nconsistently with the allegations in NOM's complaint -- that NOM's\n\nfear of enforcement of Maine's election laws was curtailing NOM's\n\nspeech, and that \"[u]ntil Maine's law is changed,\" NOM was \"not\n\ngoing to expend precious resources\" becoming involved in campaigns\n\nin the state.       The appropriate inquiry, then, is whether it was\n\nobjectively reasonable for NOM to believe that the non-major-\n\npurpose PAC provision might apply to it and that it would have to\n\ncurtail its activities in Maine to avoid such a result.\n\n\n\n\n       17\n       At the time the district court issued its merits decision\nin August 2010, \"NOM ha[d] endorsed no one, d[id] not . . . plan to\nmake expenditures, and did not even budget for expenditures in [the\n2010] Maine election cycle.\" Nat'l Org. for Marriage, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

One such\n\ntemplate, titled \"Consequences,\" raised fears that legalizing same-\n\nsex marriage would lead to schools teaching children about same-sex\n\nrelationships, and concluded:\n\n\n\n      18\n        As defendants note, NOM did expend some resources in two\nlegislative races in September 2010 (after the district court\nissued its opinion). Specifically, NOM sent out postcards that\nread: \"In May 2009, the Maine Legislature approved homosexual\n'marriage.' Rep. Linda Valentino and Rep. Donald Pilon voted to\nsupport same-sex 'marriage.' Now it's time to let Don Pilon and\nLinda Valentino know we don't agree with their decision to back\nsame-sex 'marriage.' Email [them] . . . and tell them they stand\non the wrong side of House District[s] 133 and 134.\" The other\nside of the postcards contained pictures of the candidates'\nopponents, identified them as \"stand[ing] for marriage as between\none man and one woman,\" and urged voters to email them to \"thank\nthem for standing for traditional marriage.\"      However, because\nthese mailings took place after NOM had filed its notice of appeal,\nthey are not properly part of the record here and we do not\nconsider them in our standing analysis.\n\n                                         -22-\n\f            Legislator Z and some politicians in Maine\n            can't fix the real problems in these troubled\n            times, but they've got time to push gay\n            marriage on Maine families? Call Legislator Z\n            and tell him/her: \"Don't mess with marriage.\"\n\nWhile the record does not indicate how much the contemplated\n\nadvertisements would cost, NOM alleged generally that each of its\n\ncommunications costs more than $250. The advertisements were never\n\nused, in line with NOM's claim to have curtailed its planned\n\nspeech. The record also contained evidence that NOM had made\n\npolitical     expenditures          in    Maine      in   the    past,     including\n\ncontributions of $1.8 million in 2009 to a committee opposed to\n\nMaine's same-sex marriage law.\n\n            We agree with the district court that, although NOM's\n\n\"showing certainly could have been stronger,\" Nat'l Org. for\n\nMarriage, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The burden of\n\nproving that one's speech was chilled is a modest one.                             See\n\nOsediacz,    414    F.3d      at   143.        The   record   evidence    adequately\n\nestablishes both \"an objectively reasonable possibility\" that NOM\n\nwould be subject to Maine's requirements for non-major-purpose PACs\n\nif   it   engaged   in     its     intended     speech,   and   that     NOM   forwent\n\npolitical    speech      to   avoid      the    alleged   burdens   (and       possible\n\npenalties for non-compliance) attending the non-major-purpose PAC\n\nprovision.

Standing to Challenge Out-of-State PAC Provision\n\n             We next examine NOM's standing to challenge § 1053-B,\n\nwhich     provides    generally      that   a    \"political     action   committee\n\norganized outside of [Maine] shall register and file reports with\n\nthe [C]ommission\" in accordance with Maine's PAC laws.19                  Me. Rev.\n\nStat. tit. 21-A, § 1053-B.           The question of whether NOM might be\n\nconsidered a \"political action committee\" retreads ground we have\n\njust covered.        Maine law defines \"political action committee\" to\n\ninclude, among other things, a non-major-purpose PAC.                    Moreover,\n\nthe record shows that NOM, which operates from New Jersey, is\n\norganized as a Virginia nonprofit. Thus, there is no question that\n\nNOM is \"organized outside of [Maine],\" and there is a reasonable\n\npossibility    that     it   would    be    considered    a    \"political   action\n\ncommittee\" within the meaning of the statute.                  NOM therefore has\n\nstanding to challenge the out-of-state PAC provision.\n\n\n\n     19\n       As described above, the provision also establishes a narrow\nexemption from registration and reporting for an out-of-state PAC\nif its \"only financial activity within the State is to make\ncontributions to candidates, party committees, political action\ncommittees or ballot question committees.\" Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-\nA, § 1053-B. As NOM indicated that it intended to make independent\nexpenditures for political advertising, it would not fall within\nthis exemption.\n\n                                          -24-\n\fD.   Standing to Bring Vagueness Challenge\n\n           We last address a standing-related argument specific to\n\nNOM's vagueness claims.      Defendants argue that NOM cannot bring a\n\nvagueness challenge to the non-major-purpose PAC definition, as\n\nwell as to its corresponding definition of the term \"expenditure,\"20\n\nbecause   NOM's   advocacy   efforts   were   clearly   covered   by   the\n\nprovisions' terms.     In so arguing, defendants rely on the well-\n\nestablished proposition that a \"'plaintiff who engages in some\n\nconduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness\n\nof the law as applied to the conduct of others.'\"             Holder v.\n\nHumanitarian Law Project, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149008\"><a href=\"/opinion/149008/holder-v-humanitarian-law-project/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, the question of whether the non-major-purpose PAC\n\nprovisions    clearly     applied   to     NOM's    September     mailings    is\n\nirrelevant to NOM's standing to bring its vagueness claims.\n\nBecause this is a preenforcement challenge based on conduct forgone\n\ndue to an alleged chill, the appropriate focus for the defendants'\n\narguments would be on whether \"the statutory terms are clear in\n\ntheir application to [NOM's] proposed conduct.\"             Humanitarian Law\n\nProject, 130 S. Ct. at 2720 (emphasis added).                   Moreover, the\n\njudgment in this case was entered and NOM's appeal was filed in\n\nAugust 2010, and thus evidence of NOM's September 2010 advocacy\n\nefforts is not properly part of the record on appeal.22               At the time\n\nof the hearing below, NOM had not yet engaged in any advocacy\n\nefforts in Maine in 2010.\n\n            Second, NOM's claim is not simply a challenge to the\n\nvagueness of the provisions as they would be applied to its actual\n\n\n     22\n          See supra note 18.\n\n                                    -26-\n\for intended advocacy efforts; NOM also brings a facial challenge to\n\nthe provisions under the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine. The\n\nbar against vagueness challenges by those whose conduct the law\n\nclearly proscribes is \"relaxed . . . in the First Amendment\n\ncontext, permitting plaintiffs to argue that a statute is overbroad\n\nbecause it is unclear whether it regulates a substantial amount of\n\nprotected speech.\"      United States v.

First Amendment Overbreadth Challenges\n\n             Turning to the merits of NOM's constitutional challenges,\n\nwe   first   address   its   First   Amendment   arguments   that   Maine's\n\nelection laws are unconstitutionally overbroad, reviewing those\n\nclaims de novo.

Distinction Between Issue Discussion and Express Advocacy\n\n              We    first    address       NOM's     arguments     that    the   statutes\n\nchallenged here are overbroad because they may reach discussion of\n\nissues as well as express advocacy of a candidate's election or\n\ndefeat.     The division between pure \"issue discussion\" and \"express\n\nadvocacy\" of a candidate's election or defeat is a conceptual\n\ndistinction that has played an important, and at times confounding,\n\nrole   in    a     certain    set    of    modern     Supreme    Court     election    law\n\nprecedents.          Though     the       contours    (and    significance)       of    the\n\ndistinction have never been firmly fixed, the core premise is that\n\nregulation of speech expressly advocating a candidate's election or\n\ndefeat      may    more   easily         survive    constitutional        scrutiny     than\n\nregulation of speech discussing political issues more generally.\n\n              Because a number of NOM's arguments here raise, both\n\ndirectly and indirectly, this distinction between issue discussion\n\nand    express      advocacy,       we    pause     briefly   to   describe      how    the\n\ndistinction arose and developed.                  We ultimately conclude, however,\n\nthat the distinction is not important for the issues addressed in\n\nthis appeal.\n\n              1.    Issue/Express Advocacy Distinction Generally\n\n              The issue discussion/express advocacy distinction has its\n\nroots in the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo. Perhaps\n\n\n                                             -29-\n\fthe Court's seminal decision in the area of campaign finance\n\nregulation, Buckley resolved a wide-ranging series of challenges to\n\nprovisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (\"FECA\").\n\nOne of those challenged provisions, of relevance to our discussion\n\nhere, imposed an absolute cap on independent expenditures, stating\n\nthat \"'[n]o person may make any expenditure . . . relative to a\n\nclearly identified candidate during a calendar year which, when\n\nadded to all other expenditures made by such person during the year\n\nadvocating the election or defeat of such candidate, exceeds\n\n$1,000.'\"     Buckley, 424 U.S. at 39 (alterations in original)\n\n(quoting 18 U.S.C. § 608(e)).\n\n            Reviewing this language, the Court first noted that the\n\n\"use of so indefinite a phrase as 'relative to' a candidate\" raised\n\nserious vagueness concerns.     Id. at 41.    The Court construed the\n\nphrase (by reference to its surrounding terms) as limited to\n\nexpenditures \"advocating the election or defeat of\" a candidate.\n\nHowever, this construction, in the Court's estimation, merely\n\n\"refocus[ed] the vagueness question.\"        Id. at 42.   The Court's\n\nevident concern was that the statute, even as limited, failed to\n\ndraw a sharp enough line between advocacy of a candidate's election\n\nand discussion of issues, and that the resulting uncertainty over\n\nwhat the statute covered would \"'compel[] the speaker to hedge and\n\ntrim,'\"     id. at 43 (quoting Thomas v.

Candidates, especially\n             incumbents, are intimately tied to public\n             issues involving legislative proposals and\n             governmental actions. Not only do candidates\n             campaign on the basis of their positions on\n             various    public   issues,    but   campaigns\n             themselves generate issues of public interest.\n\nId. at 42.    To avoid this uncertainty, the Court limited the scope\n\nof the statute to \"expenditures for communications that in express\n\nterms25 advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified\n\ncandidate for federal office.\"       Id. at 44.26\n\n             The   constitutional    basis   for    this   concern   with\n\ndistinguishing between laws that regulate advocacy of a candidate's\n\nelection and those that regulate pure issue discussion has never\n\nbeen entirely clear.     Buckley explicitly framed its discussion in\n\nterms of unconstitutional vagueness under the Due Process Clause,\n\nand there is, to be sure, a vagueness dimension to the analysis.\n\nSee, e.g., FEC v.

Regardless of\n\nits origins, the dividing line between issue discussion and express\n\nadvocacy, as it evolved, came to be associated more strongly with\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\fFirst     Amendment     overbreadth    analysis    than    with    due   process\n\nvagueness concerns.27        See, e.g., Wis. Right to Life, 551 U.S. at\n\n457 (noting that the \"law in this area requires us . . . to draw\n\nsuch a line, because we have recognized that the interests held to\n\njustify    the    regulation    of    campaign    speech   [under    the   First\n\nAmendment] . . . 'might not apply' to the regulation of issue\n\nadvocacy\" (quoting McConnell, 540 U.S. at 206 n.88)).\n\n             2.    Application to Maine's Election Statutes\n\n             Drawing on these cases, NOM argues that the statutes\n\nbefore us are unconstitutionally overbroad because they reach issue\n\nadvocacy as well as express advocacy of a candidate's election or\n\ndefeat. NOM's argument presumes that the distinction between issue\n\ndiscussion and express advocacy is relevant to the review of the\n\nstatutes here.         That is not the case for a couple of reasons.\n\n             First, the issue/express advocacy dichotomy has only\n\narisen in a narrow set of circumstances not present here. From the\n\nbeginning,       the   distinction's    primary    purview   has    been   cases\n\n\n\n\n     27\n        This is so to the extent that the line between issue\nadvocacy and candidate advocacy was considered a valid distinction\nat all. Indeed, the majority in McConnell indicated that it was\nnot \"persuaded, independent of our precedents, that the First\nAmendment erects a rigid barrier between express advocacy and\nso-called issue advocacy,\" noting that the \"notion cannot be\nsquared with our longstanding recognition that the presence or\nabsence   of   magic   words   cannot   meaningfully   distinguish\nelectioneering speech from a true issue ad.\" McConnell, 540 U.S.\nat 193.\n\n                                       -33-\n\fscrutinizing limits on independent expenditures.28 The statute that\n\nprompted the Buckley Court to introduce the \"express advocacy\"\n\nconstruction       was    a        blanket     $1,000   limit     on    independent\n\nexpenditures.      424 U.S. at 41-44.            The more recent Supreme Court\n\nprecedents to make use of the express/issue advocacy distinction\n\naddressed a narrower federal law prohibiting corporations and labor\n\nunions      from   employing         general    treasury      funds    to   pay   for\n\n\"electioneering\" communications targeting candidates for election.\n\nSee McConnell, 540 U.S. at 189-209; Wis. Right to Life, 551 U.S. at\n\n464-82.     This line of cases came to a definitive end with Citizens\n\nUnited, which held limitations on such expenditures by corporations\n\nand unions to be unconstitutional, and thus effectively prohibited\n\nany   law    limiting    independent          expenditures     regardless    of   the\n\nidentity of the regulated entity.               130 S. Ct. at 896-913.        As the\n\npresent case does not involve a limit on independent expenditures,\n\nthe relevance of these cases is limited at best.\n\n             Second, and more fundamentally, the Supreme Court has\n\nexplicitly     rejected       an    attempt    to   \"import    [the]   distinction\"\n\nbetween issue and express advocacy into the consideration of\n\ndisclosure requirements.

In function,\nhowever, it too is first and foremost a disclosure provision. The\nregistration requirement does not obligate the PAC to form a\nseparate entity, create a segregated fund, or make any substantive\nchange to its operation or form; the law merely requires the\nreporting of certain information about the PAC after it crosses the\napplicable contribution/expenditure threshold (along with certain\nother de minimis requirements, such as ongoing maintenance of\nrecords).

Standard of Scrutiny\n\n               Since Buckley, the Supreme Court has distinguished in its\n\nFirst Amendment jurisprudence between laws that restrict \"the\n\namount    of    money        a    person       or    group     can    spend        on    political\n\ncommunication\"         and        laws    that        simply    require       disclosure          of\n\ninformation by those engaging in political speech. 424 U.S. at 19,\n\n64.      The    Court      has     recognized          that    disclosure          laws,      unlike\n\ncontribution         and     expenditure            limits,     \"impose       no    ceiling       on\n\ncampaign-related activities,\" id. at 64, and thus are a \"less\n\nrestrictive         alternative          to    more    comprehensive          regulations         of\n\nspeech.\" Citizens United, 130 S.

For that reason, disclosure requirements have not\n\nbeen   subjected        to       strict       scrutiny,       but    rather    to       \"'exacting\n\nscrutiny,' which requires a 'substantial relation' between the\n\ndisclosure requirement and a 'sufficiently important' governmental\n\ninterest.\"       Citizens United, 130 S.

In fact, NOM suggests that any law\n\ndefining an organization as a PAC is subject to strict scrutiny,\n\nbecause, \"[a]s a matter of law, not fact,\" PAC status is burdensome\n\nand subjects an entity to \"extensive regulations.\"                NOM's argument\n\nhere reflects two contradictory points. On the one hand, NOM seeks\n\nto justify the application of strict scrutiny by reference to some\n\nundefined set of \"full-fledged political committee burdens.\"                     On\n\nthe   other,       NOM    disclaims    any     challenge   to    the    disclosure\n\nrequirements attendant to PAC status under Maine law -- i.e., the\n\nactual burdens of registration and reporting imposed by the state's\n\nPAC   provisions         --   but   purports   to   challenge    only    the   \"PAC\n\ndefinition, through which Maine unconstitutionally imposes full-\n\nfledged political committee burdens.\"               NOM's point appears to be\n\nthat \"by giving government the power to license speech\" by defining\n\n\n\n      30\n        Additionally, the application of a disclosure requirement\nmay be held to violate the First Amendment where the challengers\ncan show \"'a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure\n[of personal information] will subject them to threats, harassment,\nor reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.'\"\nReed, 130 S. Ct. at 2820 (alteration in original) (quoting Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 74). NOM has not attempted to make such a showing here\nwith respect to the disclosures required by Maine law.\n\n                                        -37-\n\fan entity as a PAC, whatever obligations are imposed on PACs \"in\n\neffect are prior restraints.\"\n\n            NOM's attempt to ascribe a free-standing significance to\n\nthe PAC label is unpersuasive.           It is not the designation as a PAC\n\nbut rather the obligations that attend PAC designation that matter\n\nfor purposes of First Amendment review.                Those obligations -- as\n\nwell as the basic definition of a \"PAC\" -- vary across the\n\njurisdictions       that    regulate   PACs.     Maine's     requirements   are\n\nsubstantially different from those at issue in the cases NOM cites\n\nin   support   of    its    contention    that   PAC    status   is   inherently\n\nburdensome.    For example, in Citizens United, where, as NOM points\n\nout, the Supreme Court characterized federal-law PACs as \"expensive\n\nto administer and subject to extensive regulations,\"31 130 S. Ct.\n\nat   897,   the     Court    was   considering    a     regime   that   required\n\ncorporations to set up a separate legal entity and create a\n\nsegregated fund prior to engaging in any direct political speech.\n\nIn addition, these federal-law PACs were subject to numerous\n\nobligations and restrictions, among them a prohibition on an\n\norganization soliciting contributions for its segregated fund from\n\nanyone except its \"members,\" which excluded \"those persons who have\n\n\n\n      31\n       Partly for this reason, the Court refused to consider the\noption of financing speech through a PAC to be a factor mitigating\nthe corporate and union independent expenditure ban's burden on\nspeech. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897 (\"Section 441b is\na ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC\ncreated by a corporation can still speak.\").\n\n                                       -38-\n\fmerely contributed to or indicated support for the organization in\n\nthe past.\"    Mass. Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. at 253-54 (citing 2\n\nU.S.C. § 441b(b)(4)(A), (C)).                 In contrast, Maine's non-major-\n\npurpose PAC provision does not condition political speech on the\n\ncreation of a separate organization or fund, establishes no funding\n\nor independent expenditure restrictions,32 and imposes three simple\n\nobligations    on      an   entity    qualifying      as    a    PAC:       filing     of    a\n\nregistration form disclosing basic information, quarterly reporting\n\nof election-related contributions and expenditures, and simple\n\nrecordkeeping.\n\n            Because Maine's PAC laws do not prohibit, limit, or\n\nimpose any onerous burdens on speech, but merely require the\n\nmaintenance and disclosure of certain financial information, we\n\nreject    NOM's     argument      that   strict      scrutiny         should        apply.\n\nAccordingly,      we   review     each   of    the   laws       at    issue    under      the\n\n\"exacting scrutiny\" standard applicable to disclosure requirements.\n\nC.   Application of Exacting Scrutiny to Maine's Laws\n\n            As we have stated, we will consider a law constitutional\n\nunder exacting scrutiny standards where there is a \"substantial\n\nrelation\"     between       the   law    and    a    \"'sufficiently            important'\n\ngovernmental      interest.\"         Citizens    United,        130    S.     Ct.    at   914\n\n(quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 64, 66).                     In Buckley, the Court\n\n\n     32\n       The only restriction on a PAC's expenditures is for direct\ncontributions to candidates; PACs are subject to the same per-\ncandidate contribution limits as any other entity or individual.\n\n                                         -39-\n\frecognized the goal of \"provid[ing] the electorate with information\n\nas to where political campaign money comes from and how it is\n\nspent\" to be such a \"sufficiently important\" governmental interest\n\ncapable of supporting a disclosure law.             424 U.S. at 66 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).       The Court's more recent decisions have\n\ncontinued    to   recognize    the   importance      of   this   informational\n\ninterest.     See, e.g., Citizens United, 130 S.

The\n\nCourt observed that disclosure has several benefits in this regard:\n\n            It allows voters to place each candidate in\n            the political spectrum more precisely than is\n            often possible solely on the basis of party\n            labels and campaign speeches. The sources of\n            a candidate's financial support also alert the\n            voter to the interests to which a candidate is\n            most likely to be responsive and thus\n            facilitate predictions of future performance\n            in office.\n\nId. at 67.\n\n            However, the informational interest is not limited to\n\ninforming the choice between candidates for political office.

We thus proceed under the exacting scrutiny framework to\n\nexamine whether there is a \"substantial relation\" between Maine's\n\ninformational interest and each of the laws at issue.\n\n            1.    Non-Major-Purpose PAC Provisions\n\n            As we have described, Maine considers an entity to be a\n\nnon-major-purpose PAC when it receives contributions or makes\n\nexpenditures of more than $5,000 annually \"for the purpose of\n\npromoting, defeating or influencing in any way\" a candidate's\n\nelection.        Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(5).     Upon\n\ncrossing that threshold, the newly-deemed non-major-purpose PAC\n\nmust register with the Commission, maintain records of certain\n\nexpenditures as well as donor contributions aggregating more than\n\n$50, and file reports both on a quarterly basis and shortly before\n\n\n     34\n        Defendants also cite an interest in \"gathering data\nnecessary to enforce substantive election law restrictions.\"\nThough we note that Buckley recognized a similar interest in\n\"gathering the data necessary to detect violations of [FECA's]\ncontribution limitations,\" 424 U.S. at 68, we find the\ninformational interest sufficient to support Maine's laws and thus\ndo not reach this second class of interests.\n\n                                  -42-\n\fand after each election.            Id. §§ 1053, 1057, 1059-60.           The\n\nreporting requirements are well tailored to Maine's informational\n\ninterest, requiring disclosure only of the candidates or campaigns\n\nthe non-major-purpose PAC supports or opposes, its expenditures\n\nmade to support or oppose the same, and identifying information for\n\nany contributors who have given more than $50 to the PAC to support\n\nor oppose a candidate or campaign.           Id. § 1060.\n\n              NOM   does   not   challenge   the   substantive    obligations\n\nattendant to non-major-purpose PAC status, nor contest that the\n\nregistration, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements bear a\n\nsubstantial relation to Maine's informational interest.              Instead,\n\nNOM contends that Maine's definition of a non-major-purpose PAC,\n\nstanding alone, is unconstitutionally overbroad.                 In rejecting\n\nNOM's argument for strict scrutiny, we have already addressed the\n\nclaim that PAC status is somehow inherently burdensome apart from\n\nthe specific requirements it entails.           However, there is a second\n\naspect   to    NOM's   argument.      NOM    contends   that   Supreme   Court\n\nprecedent sharply limits regulation of PACs to those that are under\n\nthe control of a candidate or have as their \"major purpose\" the\n\nelection of a candidate.           By its very definition, Maine's non-\n\nmajor-purpose PAC provision covers entities that fall outside of\n\nthat allegedly limited zone of permissible regulation, and thus,\n\nNOM contends, the provision is fatally overbroad.              We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -43-\n\f            NOM extracts support for its argument from a dictum in\n\nBuckley, albeit a dictum that has had some reach.            In Buckley, the\n\nCourt    concluded    that    the   definition    of    expenditure    used    in\n\nconnection with FECA's disclosure provision -- and particularly the\n\nphrase \"for the purpose of influencing\" -- raised significant line-\n\ndrawing problems because it had the \"potential for encompassing\n\nboth issue discussion and advocacy of a political result.\"                    424\n\nU.S. at 79.    In the course of its discussion, the Court noted that\n\nFECA's   definition     of    \"political     committees,\"   which,    like    the\n\ndisclosure provision, was defined in terms of contributions and\n\nexpenditures, \"could raise similar vagueness problems.\"                Id.    The\n\nprovision escaped these concerns, the Court explained, because it\n\ncould be construed more narrowly:\n\n            To fulfill the purposes of [FECA, political\n            committees] need only encompass organizations\n            that are under the control of a candidate or\n            the major purpose of which is the nomination\n            or election of a candidate. Expenditures of\n            candidates and of \"political committees\" so\n            construed can be assumed to fall within the\n            core area sought to be addressed by Congress.\n            They are, by definition, campaign related.\n\nId.   Buckley's      narrow   reading   of     FECA's   political     committee\n\ndefinition, though dictum, appears to have been accepted by later\n\nopinions.

See McConnell, 540 U.S. at 191-\n\n92.   The Court has never applied a \"major purpose\" test to a\n\nstate's    regulation    of    PACs,    nor    have    we.      And,    as    we    have\n\ndiscussed, the line-drawing concerns that led the Court to read\n\nFECA's    definition    of    \"political       committee\"      narrowly       are   not\n\nrelevant to our First Amendment review of Maine's statutes.\n\nMoreover, as the district court aptly observed, application of\n\nNOM's \"major-purpose\" test would \"yield perverse results\" here:\n\n            Under NOM's interpretation, a small group with\n            the major purpose of re-electing a Maine state\n            representative that spends $1,500 for ads\n            could be required to register as a PAC. But a\n            mega-group that spends $1,500,000 to defeat\n            the same candidate would not have to register\n            because the defeat of that candidate could not\n            be considered the corporation's major purpose.\n\nNat'l Org. for Marriage, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Independent Expenditure Provision\n\n           We similarly find that Maine's independent expenditure\n\nreporting provision poses no First Amendment concerns.               The law\n\nprimarily obligates anyone spending more than an aggregate of $100\n\nfor communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of\n\na candidate to report the expenditure to the Commission.

Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1019-\n\nB(1)(B), (3).     Though we did not review this aspect of the law in\n\nDaggett, the Supreme Court upheld in Citizens United a similar\n\nprovision of federal election law that required disclosure in\n\n\n                                   -46-\n\fconnection with expenditures for electioneering communications\n\n(communications made shortly before an election that refer to a\n\nclearly identified candidate for federal office).              130 S.

Ct. at 915-16.          The law here is\n\nperhaps more tailored than that at issue in Citizens United, as it\n\noffers an opportunity to rebut the presumption that a communication\n\nmade shortly before an election and identifying a candidate had the\n\n\"intent to influence the nomination, election or defeat of a\n\ncandidate.\" Me. Rev. Stat. tit 21-A, § 1019-B(2). Regardless, the\n\ninformation that must be reported under this subsection is, as\n\nDaggett    found,   \"modest,\"   205   F.3d   at   466,   and    it   bears   a\n\nsubstantial relation to the public's \"interest in knowing who is\n\nspeaking about a candidate shortly before an election.\"              Citizens\n\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 915-16.\n\n            NOM argues that Maine lacks a \"sufficiently important\"\n\ninterest in the $100 threshold at which the reporting requirement\n\nadheres,     and,   alternatively,    that    the   threshold        lacks   a\n\n\"substantial relation\" to a sufficiently important governmental\n\ninterest.    NOM's argument operates from a mistaken premise; we do\n\nnot review reporting thresholds under the \"exacting scrutiny\"\n\nframework.     In Buckley, facing a similar challenge to a $10\n\nthreshold for a recordkeeping provision and a $100 reporting\n\n\n                                  -47-\n\fthreshold, the Supreme Court noted that the choice of where to set\n\nsuch monetary thresholds \"is necessarily a judgmental decision,\n\nbest   left   in    the   context      of     this    complex     legislation    to\n\ncongressional discretion.\"           424 U.S. at 83.          The Court concluded\n\nthat, although there was no evidence in the record that Congress\n\nhad \"focused carefully on the appropriate level at which to require\n\nrecording and disclosure,\" and despite the fact that the low\n\nthresholds might \"discourage participation by some citizens in the\n\npolitical process,\" it could not say that \"the limits designated\n\nare wholly without rationality.\"            Id.; see also id. n.111 (\"[W]hen\n\nit is seen that a line or point there must be, and that there is no\n\nmathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of\n\nthe legislature must be accepted unless we can say that it is very\n\nwide of any reasonable mark.\" (quoting Louisville Gas Co. v.\n\nColeman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101281\"><a href=\"/opinion/101281/louisville-gas-elec-co-v-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting))).

Neither we nor the Supreme Court\n\nhas ever second-guessed a legislative decision not to index a\n\nreporting requirement to inflation.        Indeed, in Buckley, the Court\n\nacknowledged    that   Congress,    in   setting    FECA's   $100   reporting\n\nthreshold, appeared to have simply adopted the threshold used in\n\nsimilar disclosure laws since 1910 -- i.e., over the course of more\n\nthan sixty years, without any adjustment for inflation.              </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n\n\n     <span class=\"page\">35</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n       For instance, we have held that the First Amendment would\npermit, in some cases, a first-dollar reporting requirement, see\nVote Choice, 4 F.3d at 33, whereas the First Amendment clearly sets\na \"lower bound\" for contribution limits.

Hussein, 351 F.3d at 14.              NOM poses challenges\n\nto three sets of terms, and variations thereof: (1) \"promoting,\"\n\n\n                                      -52-\n\f\"support,\"    and     \"opposition\";   (2)     \"influencing\";   and   (3)\n\n\"initiation.\"       In addition, NOM claims that the definition of\n\n\"expressly advocate\" is unconstitutionally vague because it invites\n\nthe use of context to determine the purpose of a communication.\n\nA.   \"Promoting,\" \"Support,\" and \"Opposition\"\n\n            We begin with NOM's vagueness challenge to variations of\n\nthe terms \"promoting,\" \"support,\" and \"opposition,\" which appear in\n\nthree separate provisions:38 the definition of a non-major-purpose\n\nPAC,39 the PAC statute's definition of an \"expenditure,\"40 and the\n\nindependent expenditure provision.41        The district court held each\n\nof these terms to be sufficiently clear to evade due process\n\nconcerns.    We agree.\n\n\n\n\n     38\n       The term \"promoting\" also appears in the definition of a\nmajor-purpose PAC, Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(4), which\nwe do not address here in light of our holding that NOM lacks\nstanding to challenge the major-purpose PAC provision.\n     39\n        The statute defines a non-major-purpose PAC to mean an\nentity that crosses the requisite threshold of contributions or\nexpenditures \"for the purpose of promoting, defeating or\ninfluencing in any way\" a candidate election. Me. Rev. Stat. tit\n21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(5) (emphasis added).\n     40\n        The statute defines \"expenditure\" to include giving\nsomething of value \"for the initiation, support, or defeat\" of a\ncampaign or initiative. Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1052(4)(A)(1)\n(emphasis added).\n     41\n       The independent expenditure statute instructs that reports\nsubmitted pursuant to the provision \"must state whether the\nexpenditure is in support of or in opposition to the candidate.\"\nMe.

The\n\nlanguage at issue was a provision of federal election law defining\n\n\"Federal election activity\" to include \"a public communication that\n\nrefers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office . . .\n\nand that promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or\n\nattacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of\n\nwhether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against\n\na candidate).\"     2 U.S.C. § 431(20)(A)(iii).     Applying due process\n\nstandards,   the    Court   observed   that   \"[t]he   words   'promote,'\n\n'oppose,' 'attack,' and 'support' clearly set forth the confines\n\nwithin which potential party speakers must act in order to avoid\n\ntriggering the provision.\"     McConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64.       The\n\nCourt concluded that \"[t]hese words 'provide explicit standards for\n\nthose who apply them' and 'give the person of ordinary intelligence\n\na reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,'\" and thus\n\nheld that the provision was not unconstitutionally vague.            Id.\n\n(quoting Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09).\n\n          NOM acknowledges McConnell's relevance, but argues that\n\nthe opinion's holding is limited to the context of the federal law\n\nat issue there, citing several authorities that purportedly held\n\nsimilar statutory language to be \"vague and overbroad vis-à-vis\n\nother speech or other speakers.\" NOM's argument is misguided.

This is, as we\n\nhave discussed, primarily an overbreadth issue, and we have already\n\nrejected    NOM's    arguments     that   the    statutes    here      are\n\nunconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n           If, on the other hand, NOM offers these authorities\n\nsolely for the purpose of countering McConnell's vagueness holding\n\n-- which is the relevant point here -- they also fall short of the\n\nmark.   None of the cited cases is a majority Supreme Court opinion\n\nissued after McConnell, so McConnell remains the leading authority\n\nrelevant to interpretation of the terms before us.      Of course, the\n\nstatutes here are distinct from the provision that McConnell\n\nconstrued, and thus the Court's reading is not dispositive.\n\nHowever, contrary to NOM's assertion, the statutory context here is\n\nclose enough to McConnell to make the Court's conclusion that the\n\nterms are not vague particularly persuasive.           In each of the\n\nprovisions,   the   terms     \"promote\"/\"promoting,\"   \"support,\"      and\n\n\n                                  -55-\n\f\"oppose\"/\"opposition\" have an election-related object: \"candidate\"\n\nin the federal law, 2 U.S.C. § 431(20)(A)(iii), and \"candidate,\"\n\n\"nomination or election of any candidate\" and \"campaign, referendum\n\nor initiative\" in the Maine provisions, Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A,\n\n§§ 1019-B(3)(B), 1052(4)(A)(1), (5)(A)(5).          If anything, the terms\n\nof Maine's statutes provide slightly more clarity: for example,\n\n§ 1052(5)(A)(5)'s reference to \"promoting . . . the nomination or\n\nelection of any candidate\" is more precise than the federal law's\n\nreference   to   \"promot[ing]   .    .   .   a   candidate,\"   2   U.S.C.   §\n\n431(20)(A)(iii).     We thus find the use of \"promoting,\" \"support,\"\n\nand \"opposition\" in §§ 1019-B and 1052 clear enough to \"give the\n\nperson of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know\n\nwhat is prohibited.\"    Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108.\n\nB.   \"Influencing\"\n\n            The term \"influencing\" (appearing also as \"influence\")\n\npresents a closer question.42 The district court held \"influencing\"\n\n\n     42\n       \"Influencing\" appears in a number of places throughout the\nstatutes challenged by NOM. These include: the definition of a\nnon-major-purpose PAC, Me. Rev. Stat. 21-A, § 1052(5)(A)(5)\n(defining non-major-purpose PAC to mean an entity that crosses the\nrequisite threshold of contributions or expenditures \"for the\npurpose of promoting, defeating or influencing in any way\" a\ncandidate election (emphasis added)); the out-of-state PAC\nprovision, id. § 1053-B (providing that an out-of-state PAC need\nnot register if, among other things, it \"has not raised and\naccepted any contributions during the calendar year to influence an\nelection or campaign in [Maine]\" (emphasis added)); the attribution\nand disclaimer provision, id. § 1014(2-A) (clarifying that\ndisclaimer and attribution requirements do not apply to\ncommunications made shortly before an election that name or depict\na candidate \"if the communication was not made for the purpose of\n\n                                    -56-\n\fto be unconstitutionally vague and severed it from the various\n\nstatutes challenged here.       On appeal, defendants urge that we find\n\n\"influencing\" sufficiently clear to avoid due process concerns.\n\nNOM, in turn, contends that the district court erred in severing\n\n\"influencing,\"     suggesting    that    we   should    find    the   statutes\n\nunconstitutional    in   their    entirety.      Because       we   agree   with\n\ndefendants that the use of \"influencing\" in the statutes before us\n\nis, when given a properly limited meaning, not unconstitutionally\n\nvague, we need not reach the question of severance.\n\n          In   arguing   that    \"influencing\"     is    unconstitutionally\n\nvague, NOM relies on the Supreme Court's construction of similar\n\nlanguage in Buckley v. Valeo.           The relevant portion of Buckley\n\nconcerned a disclosure requirement applicable to anyone \"'who makes\n\ncontributions or expenditures' aggregating over $100 in a calendar\n\nyear.\"   Buckley, 424 U.S. at 74-75 (quoting 2 U.S.C. § 434(e)).\n\nThe statute defined \"expenditures\" to include \"the use of money or\n\nother valuable assets 'for the purpose of . . . influencing' the\n\n\n\ninfluencing the candidate's . . . election\" (emphasis added)); the\nindependent expenditure provision, id. § 1019-B(2) (providing that\na person presumed to have made an independent expenditure may rebut\nthe presumption by filing a statement that \"the cost was not\nincurred with the intent to influence the nomination, election or\ndefeat of a candidate\" (emphasis added)); and the definitions of\n\"expenditure\" used in connection with the attribution and\ndisclaimer, independent expenditure, and PAC provisions, id. §§\n1012(3) (defining \"expenditure\" to include giving something of\nvalue \"for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of\nany person to political office\" (emphasis added)), 1052(4)(A)(1)\n(same).\n\n                                   -57-\n\fnomination or election of candidates for federal office.\"                             Id. at\n\n77    (quoting     2    U.S.C.       §   431(f)).     The      Court     noted   that    the\n\n\"ambiguity\" of the phrase \"for the purpose of influencing\" \"poses\n\nconstitutional           problems\"        and    \"raises       serious        problems    of\n\nvagueness,\" id. at 76-77, in that it had the \"potential for\n\nencompassing both issue discussion and advocacy of a political\n\nresult,\" id. at 79.              This was, of course, the same concern the\n\nCourt raised with respect to the phrase \"relative to a candidate\"\n\nin    FECA's independent expenditures cap, and the Court reached an\n\nidentical solution.             The Court skirted its constitutional concerns\n\nby    imposing      a        limiting     construction      on     the    definition      of\n\nexpenditure \"to reach only funds used for communications that\n\nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified\n\ncandidate.\"        Id. at 80 (footnote omitted).\n\n             NOM's       argument        that   Buckley     dictates      a    finding    of\n\nvagueness here is flawed on several counts.                      First, as more recent\n\nSupreme Court precedents have made clear, Buckley's narrowing\n\ninterpretation of the phrase \"for the purpose of influencing\" \"was\n\nthe    product          of     statutory        interpretation          rather    than     a\n\nconstitutional command.\"                 McConnell, 540 U.S. at 192.             The Court\n\nnever squarely held in Buckley that the term \"influencing\" was\n\nunconstitutionally vague under due process standards, and the\n\nconstitutional concern that prompted the Court to narrow the term\n\n--    the   fear    that       the   statute     might    be     read    to   reach   issue\n\n\n                                             -58-\n\fdiscussion -- is, as we have said, not a relevant one for review of\n\ndisclosure laws.    Second, even if Buckley were to have found\n\n\"influencing\" unconstitutionally vague in FECA, it would not be\n\ndispositive of the question here.      Terms claimed to be vague must\n\nbe interpreted in light of their precise statutory context, see URI\n\nStudent Senate v. Town of Narragansett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182273\"><a href=\"/opinion/182273/uri-student-senate-v-town-of-narragansett/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2011); Welch v.

The other\n\ncandidate-related terms employed by the statutes here -- such as\n\n\"promoting,\" \"opposition,\" \"defeat,\" and \"support,\" Me. Rev. Stat.\n\ntit. 21-A, §§ 1019-B(3)(B), 1052(4)(A)(1), (5)(A)(5) -- are more\n\nplainly result-oriented, focusing on advocacy for or against a\n\nparticular candidacy. Influence, on the other hand, covers a wider\n\nrange of objectives.     Conceivably falling within the meaning of\n\n\"influence\" are objectives as varied as advocacy for or against a\n\ncandidate's election; championing an issue for inclusion in a\n\ncandidate's platform; and encouraging all candidates to embrace\n\npublic funding.    Without more context, we believe the intended\n\nmeaning of \"influence\" to be uncertain enough that a person of\n\naverage intelligence would be forced to \"'guess at its meaning and\n\nmodes of application.'\"      Councilman, 418 F.3d at 84 (quoting\n\n\n                                -59-\n\fHussein, 351 F.3d at 14).\n\n          Arguing    that    the    statutes'       use   of   \"influencing\"     is\n\nadequately clear, defendants point us to the interpretive canon of\n\nnoscitur a sociis, which provides that an ambiguous statutory term\n\nmay be \"given more precise content by the neighboring words with\n\nwhich it is associated.\"         Williams, 553 U.S. at 294.           For example,\n\nin the non-major-purpose PAC definition, defendants suggest that\n\n\"influencing\" should be given a meaning similar to or consistent\n\nwith \"promoting\" and \"defeating.\"           See Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, §\n\n1052(5)(A)(5)    (\"for     the    purpose     of    promoting,       defeating   or\n\ninfluencing in any way\").         This argument fails for two reasons.\n\n          First, \"influencing\" appears on its own in some of the\n\nstatutes before us, thus defeating the noscitur a sociis exercise\n\nfor those provisions.       See, e.g., id. § 1014(2-A) (\"The disclosure\n\nis not required if the communication was not made for the purpose\n\nof   influencing    the    candidate's        nomination       for   election    or\n\nelection.\").    Second, in those statutes where \"influencing\" is\n\npaired with other terms, we find more persuasive the countervailing\n\ninterpretive    canon     counseling    that    a   statute     should    \"'be   so\n\nconstrued that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or\n\nword shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.'\"                  TRW Inc. v.\n\nAndrews, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118465\"><a href=\"/opinion/118465/trw-inc-v-andrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31 (2001) (quoting Duncan v.

Our interpretation is guided by the fact that,\n\neven where it appears with other terms, \"influencing\" appears to\n\n\n                                       -60-\n\fhave been intentionally set apart.                      For example, the relevant\n\nlanguage of § 1052(5)(A)(5) reads \"for the purpose of promoting,\n\ndefeating or influencing in any way;\" the addition of \"in any way\"\n\nlogically gives \"influencing\" a broader sweep than the foregoing\n\nterms.    The differentiation is even more apparent in the PAC\n\nstatute's definition of expenditure, where the term \"influencing\"\n\nappears in a different clause and is given a different (though\n\nrelated) object from the other terms.                        See Me. Rev. Stat. tit.\n\n21-A, § 1052(4)(A)(1) (defining expenditure to cover the transfer\n\nof anything of value \"for the purpose of influencing the nomination\n\nor   election   of    any     person   to     political         office;      or    for    the\n\ninitiation,     support       or   defeat    of     a    campaign,     referendum          or\n\ninitiative.\").       The natural inference from this separation is that\n\nthe drafters intended \"influencing\" to carry a different meaning\n\nfrom the words with which it appears.\n\n            Despite     their      continued       insistence       that     the    use    of\n\n\"influencing\"    in     the    statutes      here       is    not   vague,    defendants\n\nrecognize     that     we,     like    the        district       court,      might       find\n\n\"influencing\" insufficiently clear on its face to satisfy due\n\nprocess standards.        Therefore, as a fallback position, defendants\n\noffer a     narrowing     construction        that      has    been   adopted       by    the\n\nCommission with respect to a separate statute regulating ballot\n\nquestion committees.           In written guidance, the Commission has\n\nclarified    that it      interprets        the    phrase \"for        the    purpose       of\n\n\n                                        -61-\n\finitiating, promoting, defeating or influencing in any way a\n\ncampaign,\" Me.

Comm'n on Governmental Ethics & Elections Practices,\n\nGuidance on Reporting as a Ballot Question Committee, available at\n\nhttp://www.maine.gov/ethics/bqcs/guidance.htm (last visited July\n\n25, 2011).         This narrowing construction was not offered to the\n\ndistrict court.43             However, there is no barrier to our considering\n\nit here -- and, indeed, we are required to do so.                             See Hoffman\n\nEstates, 455 U.S. at 494 n.5 (\"In evaluating a facial challenge to\n\na state law, a federal court must . . . consider any limiting\n\nconstruction           that    a   state   court     or    enforcement        agency   has\n\nproffered.\").\n\n                 As narrowed, the terms \"influencing\" and \"influence,\" as\n\nused        in   the    statutes     at     issue     here,      would    include      only\n\n\n       43\n       The Maine Attorney General had offered in prior litigation\nbefore the district court a narrowing construction limiting the\nterm \"influencing\" to express advocacy. See Volle v. Webster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2348951\"><a href=\"/opinion/2348951/volle-v-webster/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175 (D. Me. 1999). In light of the fact that\nSupreme Court precedent subsequent to that litigation \"made clear\nthat the state may regulate speech other than express advocacy,\"\nthe Attorney General believed that the narrowing construction was\n\"no longer required\" and therefore did not offer it in the\nproceedings below.\n\n                                            -62-\n\f\"communications and activities that expressly advocate for or\n\nagainst [a candidate] or that clearly identify a candidate by\n\napparent and unambiguous reference and are susceptible of no\n\nreasonable interpretation other than to promote or oppose the\n\ncandidate.\" This narrowed formulation is considerably more precise\n\nthan the original, and succeeds both in \"provid[ing] explicit\n\nstandards for those who apply\" the provisions at issue here and in\n\nensuring that persons of average intelligence will have reasonable\n\nnotice of the provisions' coverage.   Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108.   We\n\nthus conclude that the provisions' use of the terms \"influencing\"\n\nand \"influence,\" so limited, is not so vague as to offend due\n\nprocess.\n\nC.   \"Initiation\"\n\n           Among the statutes at issue in this appeal, the term\n\n\"initiation\" appears only in the PAC statute's definition of\n\n\"expenditure.\"44    NOM offers no support for its argument that\n\n\"initiation\" is vague, contending only that \"initiation\" \"fare[s]\n\nno better\" than the other terms challenged on vagueness grounds.\n\nWe find \"initiation\" to be adequately clear.       The context --\n\ndefining \"expenditure\" to include giving something of value \"for\n\n\n\n     44\n       The statute defines \"expenditure\" to include the transfer\nof something of value \"for the initiation, support or defeat of a\ncampaign, referendum or initiative.\"   Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, §\n1052(4)(A)(1) (emphasis added). NOM also challenges the use of\n\"initiating\" in the definition of a major-purpose PAC, but we have\nheld that it lacks standing to pursue that claim.\n\n                               -63-\n\fthe    initiation     .   .   .   of   a    campaign\"    --   makes   plain    that\n\n\"initiation\" is being used as the noun form of the verb \"initiate,\"\n\nthe primary definition of which is \"to begin, set going, or\n\noriginate.\"        The Random House Dictionary of the English Language\n\n982 (2d ed. unabr. 1987).              Used in this way, the language is\n\nunequivocal, and easily would put an individual of average aptitude\n\non notice that the act of incurring an expense for the purpose of\n\nbeginning an electoral campaign will constitute an \"expenditure\"\n\nwithin the meaning of § 1052(4)(A)(1).                 See Grayned, 408 U.S. at\n\n108.    NOM's argument that \"initiation\" is unconstitutionally vague\n\nthus fails.\n\nD.    Use of Context in Definition of \"Expressly Advocate\"\n\n             NOM's final vagueness argument is somewhat distinct from\n\nthe preceding ones.           While NOM's claim focuses on the phrase\n\n\"expressly advocate\" in the independent expenditure statute,45 NOM\n\ndoes not contend that the phrase itself is unconstitutionally\n\nvague.      Instead, NOM argues that Maine's definition of \"expressly\n\nadvocate,\" set forth in regulations promulgated by the Commission,\n\nrenders      the   term   vague    because        it   invites   reliance     on   a\n\ncommunication's context and employs a purportedly unconstitutional\n\n\n       45\n       The statute defines an \"independent expenditure\" to be one\n\"that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly\nidentified candidate.\" Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1019-B(1)(A).\nThough the attribution and disclaimer provisions also use the\nphrase \"expressly advocating,\" see id. § 1014(1), the regulations\nchallenged here relate solely to the definition of an \"independent\nexpenditure.\"\n\n                                           -64-\n\f\"appeal-to-vote\" formulation for determining what qualifies as\n\nexpress advocacy.     Specifically, the regulations provide that a\n\ncommunication will be considered to \"expressly advocate\" when it\n\nemploys phrases that \"in context can have no other reasonable\n\nmeaning than to urge the election or defeat of one or more clearly\n\nidentified    candidate(s),   such     as   posters,     bumper     stickers,\n\nadvertisements, etc. which say 'Pick Berry,' 'Harris in 2000,'\n\n'Murphy/Stevens'    or   'Canavan!'\"        94-270-001    Me.     Code   R.   §\n\n10(2)(B).46   As we explain, NOM's arguments read far too much into\n\na limited line of Supreme Court precedents, and provide no basis\n\nfor concluding that Maine's regulations are unconstitutionally\n\nvague.\n\n            NOM's arguments have their roots in the recent trio of\n\n\n\n     46\n          The full text of the definition is as follows:\n\n     \"Expressly advocate\" means any communication that uses\n     phrases such as \"vote for the Governor,\" \"reelect your\n     Representative,\" \"support the Democratic nominee,\" \"cast\n     your ballot for the Republican challenger for Senate\n     District 1,\" \"Jones for House of Representatives,\" \"Jean\n     Smith in 2002,\" \"vote Pro-Life\" or \"vote Pro-Choice\"\n     accompanied by a listing of clearly identified candidates\n     described as Pro-Life or Pro-Choice, \"vote against Old\n     Woody,\" \"defeat\" accompanied by a picture of one or more\n     candidate(s), \"reject the incumbent,\" or communications\n     of campaign slogan(s) or individual word(s), which in\n     context can have no other reasonable meaning than to urge\n     the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified\n     candidate(s),   such   as   posters,   bumper   stickers,\n     advertisements, etc. which say \"Pick Berry,\" \"Harris in\n     2000,\" \"Murphy/Stevens\" or \"Canavan!\".\n\n94-270-001 Me. Code R. § 10(2)(B).\n\n                                 -65-\n\fSupreme Court cases addressing the constitutionality of the federal\n\nprohibition of independent expenditures by corporations and unions\n\nfor \"electioneering\" communications -- those made shortly before a\n\nprimary or general election that clearly identify a candidate for\n\nfederal office.        The trio began with McConnell, in which the Court\n\nupheld the electioneering provision against a facial overbreadth\n\nchallenge.    In so doing, the Court found unavailing the contention\n\nthat the provision would regulate a substantial amount of issue\n\nadvocacy, noting that the argument \"fail[ed] to the extent that the\n\nissue ads broadcast during the [relevant period] are the functional\n\nequivalent of express advocacy.\"          McConnell, 540 U.S. at 206.\n\n            This conditional assertion was put to the test several\n\nyears     later   in    Wisconsin    Right   to    Life,    when   the    Court,\n\nentertaining      an    as-applied    challenge    to      the   electioneering\n\nprovision,    considered     whether     several   specific      advertisements\n\nqualified as the \"functional equivalent of express advocacy.\"                 The\n\nCourt concluded they did not, and accordingly held the provision\n\nunconstitutional in its application.          Along the way, the principal\n\nopinion made two points relevant to NOM's arguments here.                 First,\n\nit suggested that an advertisement would qualify as the \"functional\n\nequivalent of express advocacy,\" and thereby could be regulated\n\nwithout    triggering      overbreadth     concerns,    only     when    it   \"is\n\nsusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal\n\n\n\n\n                                      -66-\n\fto vote for or against a specific candidate.\"47 Wis. Right to Life,\n\n551 U.S. at 469-70. NOM refers to this formulation as the \"appeal-\n\nto-vote test.\"      Second, the Court criticized efforts to use the\n\nadvertisements' context to determine whether they qualified as the\n\n\"'functional      equivalent'    of    express       advocacy,\"   noting    that\n\n\"contextual factors of the sort invoked [there] should seldom play\n\na significant role in the inquiry.\"           Id. at 473-74.\n\n           Most recently, the Court concluded in Citizens United\n\nthat Congress could not limit the campaign-related speech of\n\ncorporations and unions and thus held the electioneering provision\n\nunconstitutional, overturning McConnell. Citizens United provides\n\nthe   launching    point   for   NOM's       first    argument    that    Maine's\n\ndefinition of \"expressly advocate\" is vague.               NOM contends that\n\nCitizens   United     eliminated      \"the     appeal-to-vote      test    as   a\n\nconstitutional limit on government power,\" and reads into this an\n\nimplicit holding that the test was unconstitutionally vague.\n\n           NOM's reading finds no support in the text of Citizens\n\nUnited, though we agree with NOM that, in striking down the federal\n\nelectioneering expenditure statute, Citizens United eliminated the\n\n\n\n\n      47\n        En route to this test, the principal opinion rejected\nproposed intent- and effect-based standards, i.e. frameworks that\nwould have required inquiry into the intent of the speaker to\naffect an election or an examination of the actual effect the\nspeech would have on an election or on its target audience. Wis.\nRight to Life, 551 U.S. at 467-69.\n\n                                      -67-\n\fcontext in which the appeal-to-vote test has had any significance.48\n\nIt is a large and unsubstantiated jump, however, to read Citizens\n\nUnited as casting doubt on the constitutionality of any statute or\n\nregulation using language similar to the appeal-to-vote test to\n\ndefine the scope of its coverage.      The basis for Citizens United's\n\nholding on the constitutionality of the electioneering expenditure\n\nstatute had nothing to do with the appeal-to-vote test or the\n\ndivide between express and issue advocacy.        Instead, the decision\n\nturned on a reconsideration of prior case law holding that a\n\ncorporation's   political   speech     may   be   subjected   to   greater\n\nregulation than an individual's.     See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat 886.   The opinion offered no view on the clarity of the appeal-\n\nto-vote test.   In fact, the Court itself relied on the appeal-to-\n\nvote test in disposing of a threshold argument that the appeal\n\nshould be resolved on narrower, as-applied grounds.           See id. at\n\n889-90    (applying   appeal-to-vote     test     in   determining   that\n\nadvertisements at issue were the functional equivalent of express\n\nadvocacy).\n\n\n\n     48\n       We do not agree, however, with NOM's characterization of the\nappeal-to-vote test, or any of the other tests proposed by the\nCourt for distinguishing between express and issue advocacy, as a\n\"constitutional limit on government power.\" Citizens United made\nclear that at least some forms of regulation may reach issue\nadvocacy, see 130 S. Ct. at 915, and there are substantial\nquestions as to whether the line between issue advocacy and express\nadvocacy is constitutionally rooted, see McConnell, 540 U.S. at 193\n(noting doubts that \"the First Amendment erects a rigid barrier\nbetween express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy\").\n\n                                -68-\n\f                We find similarly misguided NOM's argument that the\n\ndefinition of \"expressly advocate\" is vague due to the regulation's\n\nreference        to     consideration       of   an      advertisement's            words   \"in\n\ncontext.\"       NOM misinterprets Wisconsin Right to Life in suggesting\n\nthat the principal opinion barred all consideration of context to\n\ndetermine whether an advertisement was the functional equivalent of\n\nexpress        advocacy.        To    the   contrary,          the     opinion      explicitly\n\nacknowledges          that    \"[c]ourts     need    not    ignore         basic     background\n\ninformation that may be necessary to put an ad in context.\"                                 Wis.\n\nRight to Life, 551 U.S. at 474.49                It is apparent from the examples\n\nprovided by the regulation here -- \"'Pick Berry,' 'Harris in 2000,'\n\n'Murphy/Stevens' or 'Canavan!'\" -- that \"knowing that Berry is a\n\ncandidate to be picked on the ballot, that 2000 is an election\n\nwhere Harris should win, etc.,\" Nat'l Org. for Marriage, 723 F.\n\nSupp.     2d    at     266,   is    precisely      the    sort       of   basic     background\n\ninformation           that    may    be   consulted       in     the      express    advocacy\n\ndetermination.\n\n                In any event, we find the regulation's definition of\n\n\"expressly advocate,\" as a whole, to be sufficiently clear to\n\n\n\n     49\n        In Citizens United, the Court also relied on contextual\nfactors in determining that the communication at issue -- a ninety-\nminute documentary about Hillary Clinton -- constituted the\nfunctional equivalent of express advocacy. See 130 S. Ct. at 890\n(\"In light of historical footage, interviews with persons critical\nof her, and voiceover narration, the film would be understood by\nmost viewers as an extended criticism of Senator Clinton's\ncharacter and her fitness for the office of the Presidency.\").\n\n                                            -69-\n\fsatisfy due process.           The definition offers abundant examples\n\n(fourteen in all) of the sorts of language that will constitute\n\nexpress advocacy, and, as we have noted before, \"[t]he existence of\n\nclear examples of conduct covered by a law may . . . help to\n\ninsulate the law against an accusation of vagueness.\"                 URI Student\n\nSenate, 631 F.3d at 14; see also Hotel & Motel Ass'n v.

The district court found NOM's arguments unavailing\n\nand ordered the record unsealed such that it would be \"public in\n\nprecisely the way that it would have been had live witnesses been\n\ncalled to testify.\"       Nat'l Org. for Marriage, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n\n249 n.4.    We granted an emergency motion to stay the unsealing\n\norder during the pendency of this appeal.\n\n           On   appeal,    NOM   fields   two   arguments   for   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.     It first argues that the district court erred in\n\n\n\n     50\n        In the course of discovery, the parties entered into a\nconfidentiality agreement, which was entered as a consent order by\nthe magistrate judge overseeing discovery matters. That consent\norder required, among other things, that any documents designated\nconfidential that were filed with the court be submitted under\nseal. In subsequently stipulating to a joint trial record, the\nparties included a number of documents that had previously been\nfiled under seal pursuant to the consent order.\n\n                                   -72-\n\funsealing the documents without a \"finding of true necessity.\"\n\nNOM's     argument   flips   the   proper    analysis   on    its   head.   The\n\npresumption here favors openness, and a court need make no finding,\n\nlet alone one of \"true necessity,\" in order to make the proceedings\n\nand documents in a civil trial public.            Instead, it is the party\n\nseeking to keep documents sealed who must make a showing sufficient\n\nto overcome the presumption of public access.                See Standard Fin.\n\nMgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d at 411.               Second, NOM suggests that the\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to consider a number of controlling\n\nlegal principles.      On examination, the authorities it cites are,\n\nwithout exception, inapposite.51\n\n\n     51\n        For example, NOM cites cases involving the validity of a\nfederal regulation that required release of materials compiled by\nthe FEC during investigations into alleged election law violations,\nsee Am. Fed'n of Labor & Cong. of Indus. Orgs. v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185966\"><a href=\"/opinion/185966/amer-fed-labor-v-fec/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(D.C. Cir. 2003), and a claim of First Amendment privilege against\nthe compelled disclosure of internal documents pursuant to a court\norder enforcing a discovery request, see Perry v. Schwarzenegger,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1463828\"><a href=\"/opinion/1463828/perry-v-schwarzenegger/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2010). Those cases involved the possible\ncompelled disclosure of information to which there was no\npresumptive right of public access; here, in contrast, the\ndocuments at issue were voluntarily included in the record filed\nwith the district court, and thus subject to a presumption of\npublic access.\n     NOM also contends that the two-step inquiry set forth in\nPress-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111735\"><a href=\"/opinion/111735/press-enterprise-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-county-of-riverside/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1986), must\nbe applied to determine whether the documents here are within the\npublic's presumptive right of access. That inquiry relates to the\ncategorical determination of whether a particular type of\nproceeding or class of court documents falls within the public's\nright of access, see In re Bos. Herald, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200358\"><a href=\"/opinion/200358/in-re-boston-herald-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 182-83\n(1st Cir. 2003); it does not govern whether individual documents\nfiled with a court should be made public. NOM does not contest\nthat the right of public access extends to the trial record in a\ncivil matter, Siedle, 147 F.3d at 10, and thus Press-Enterprise's\ntwo-step inquiry is inapplicable.\n\n                                     -73-\n\f              On the record before us, we cannot conclude that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in ordering the trial record\n\nunsealed.       While       NOM claims    harm from      disclosure   of   certain\n\nstrategic documents, neither before the district court nor in this\n\nappeal has NOM identified any specific information that, if made\n\npublic, would damage or chill its political advocacy efforts.\n\nIndeed, the documents it identifies as particularly sensitive,\n\nincluding a strategic planning document it terms its \"playbook,\"\n\ndisclose primarily advocacy priorities and expenditures in past\n\nelection cycles, and we see little among them that could advantage\n\nNOM's opponents going forward.             NOM's claims that its contractors\n\nand service-providers could be subject to harassment also lack\n\nsupport, resting upon allegations of harassment against a vendor\n\nthat performed work for supporters of California's Proposition 8.\n\nWhile \"'privacy rights of participants and third parties[] are\n\namong those interests which, in appropriate cases, can limit the\n\npresumptive right of access to judicial records,'\" Standard Fin.\n\nMgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d at 411 (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(quoting In re Knoxville News-Sentinel Co., 723 F.2d at 478), NOM\n\nfailed   to    make     a    compelling    case   that   the   specific    vendors\n\nreferenced in the documents here have any reasonable privacy\n\nconcerns relating to the disclosure of their business relationship\n\nwith NOM.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -74-\n\f                         VI.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the portion of\n\nthe district court's judgment finding the terms \"influencing\" and\n\n\"influence\" unconstitutionally vague, remand for entry of judgment\n\nin defendants' favor in full on those claims, and affirm the\n\njudgment in all other respects.     We also vacate our stay of the\n\ndistrict court's unsealing order.     Costs shall be awarded to the\n\nappellees.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -75-\n\f</pre>",
