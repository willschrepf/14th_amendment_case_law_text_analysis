Soni appeal from a\n\njudgment entered after a bifurcated jury and bench trial on fraud and related equitable\n\nclaims of plaintiffs and respondents David Hackbart and Kihack Management LLC\n\n(collectively Hackbart) arising out of Hackbart's purchase of a gasoline station and\n\nrelated businesses from defendants. The trial court entered a judgment awarding\n\nHackbart $1,400,000 in fraud damages and $700,000 in punitive damages against Uppal,\n\nand $232,000 against Soni in the amount it found Soni had been unjustly enriched. It\n\nawarded $1,400,000 in breach of contract and fraud damages against suspended\n\ncorporation MTPA Ventures Limited, Inc. (MTPA), against which it had previously\n\nentered a default judgment. The court declined to hold any of the individual defendants\n\nliable for the acts of MTPA as alter egos.\n\n       Uppal contends: (1) there is no evidence to support the jury's finding that\n\nHackbart justifiably relied on any statement or concealment of fact; and (2) the court\n\nerred by permitting the jury to calculate fraud damages in a manner contrary to the Civil\n\nCode1 section 3343 out-of-pocket measure. Soni joins these arguments from Uppal's\n\nappellant's brief. Uppal separately contends the jury's punitive damage award is\n\nunsupported by a finding of actual damage, excessive and contrary to law. Soni\n\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Civil Code.\n\n                                             2\n\fseparately contends the trial court erred by finding he was unjustly enriched because\n\nHackbart had no legal basis on which to premise a claim for unjust enrichment, and even\n\nif there were such a basis, Hackbart failed to proffer evidence of the businesses' value at\n\nthe date of sale.\n\n        Hackbart cross-appeals, contending the restitutionary award against Soni was\n\nimproperly limited to the net cash proceeds Soni received, and should be increased to\n\n$560,000, which reflects Soni's proportionate share of the gross out-of-pocket damages\n\nawarded to Hackbart. Hackbart further contends the trial court erred by denying alter ego\n\nliability against Soni.\n\n       We conclude that to the extent the trial court erred by submitting the wrong\n\nmeasure of fraud damages to the jury or the jury calculated fraud damages in a manner\n\ncontrary to section 3343, the error was invited by Uppal's submission of the fraud\n\ndamages jury instruction. We reverse the restitution award against Soni as unsupported\n\nby an independent basis for liability, as well as the punitive damages award against Uppal\n\nas without support by meaningful evidence of his ability to pay. We reject the remaining\n\ncontentions and otherwise affirm the judgment.\n\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       In 2001, Uppal, a certified public accountant (CPA) with undergraduate and\n\nmaster's degrees from University of Southern California in business administration and\n\nbusiness taxation, purchased out of bankruptcy a Chevron gasoline station and related\n\nbusinesses located at 350 Encinitas Boulevard. The purchase price was $1.1 million.\n\nUppal signed the purchase agreement and promissory note, as well as the security\n\n                                             3\n\fagreement and a sublease. During the previous 13 years, he had invested in 12 to 15\n\nautomotive-related franchises and desired to get out of that business. At some point, he\n\nand Soni agreed to be financial partners in the transaction, and they formed and\n\nincorporated MTPA in September 2001, shortly before the purchase. Uppal and his wife\n\nBhavna Uppal owned a 60 percent interest in MTPA, and Soni owned a 40 percent\n\ninterest. Despite MTPA's creation, Uppal never attempted to assign to MTPA any assets\n\nor rights to the business he had individually acquired, assertedly because the bankruptcy\n\ncourt would not permit it. Soni accepted that all of the assets were in Uppal's name.2\n\n       MTPA never held any formal shareholder or board of director meetings. MTPA\n\ndid, however, obtain a seller's permit from the state Board of Equalization in order to\n\ncollect sales tax, and Uppal was responsible for doing the monthly reporting of sales and\n\nuse taxes due. From January 2004 to August 2004, Uppal understated transactions at the\n\nChevron station subject to gasoline sales taxes so he could save money, even though he\n\nknew doing so was dishonest.\n\n\n\n\n2      For clarity and not out of disrespect, we refer to Satinder Uppal as Uppal, and his\nwife Bhavna Uppal as Bhavna. Uppal listed his wife Bhavna as the president, secretary\nand treasurer of MTPA, and she and Soni were its sole directors. MTPA was\nincorporated as a domestic stock corporation on or about September 14, 2001. Its\ncorporate filings identified all of its officers as Bhavna Uppal in her maiden name. Uppal\nsigned his wife's name with her authorization on various documents, including the\nChevron station's state, local and district sales and use tax returns from January 2004\nthrough August 2004.\n\n                                             4\n\f       At some point in 2004, Uppal shared with Soni a monthly \"break-even\" analysis of\n\nthe station's profits and losses from 2003 that showed losses for 11 of the 12 months of\n\nthat year, a net loss of over $91,000.3 The men exchanged e-mails and discussed\n\nwhether it made sense to put more money into the business given that analysis. Soni told\n\nUppal that his numbers did not make sense to him, and he asked him to come up with a\n\n\"clean set of numbers\"; that they would discuss the sale \"once we clean the books.\" The\n\nmen decided they would sell the business and started marketing it by the spring of 2004.\n\n       In October 2004, Hackbart, a car wash owner with a college degree in accounting,\n\ncalled Uppal in response to an advertisement about the Chevron station. Uppal informed\n\nHackbart of the nature of the business including the volume of gas pumped per month\n\nand the profit per gallon, and the revenues from both the car wash and convenience store.\n\nUppal told him the average income from January 2004 to August 2004 was $33,000 to\n\n$34,000. A few days later, Hackbart made an e-mail offer to Uppal of $1.8 million for\n\nthe business, contingent on an inspection of its books and records. Uppal countered with\n\na higher offer that would permit Hackbart to inspect the books and records within the\n\nnext three days. They finally settled on a purchase price of $1.875 million for the\n\nChevron gas station, car wash, convenience store, automobile repair center and the rights\n\nto a sandwich franchise.\n\n\n3       The statement reported a $9,000 loss in January 2003 and other losses of $10,000\nor more for other months. The only positive month was July 2003, which showed a $31\nprofit. According to MTPA's income statement, the business had a $61,000 loss in the\nfirst six weeks of opening, $7,000 net income in 2002, and $46,000 net income in 2003.\nThe latter income statement was inconsistent with the break-even analysis reviewed by\nUppal and Soni, but neither Uppal nor Soni gave the break-even analysis to Hackbart.\n                                             5\n\f      In late October 2004, Uppal, Hackbart and other potential investors with Hackbart\n\nmet at a nearby restaurant and Hackbart was shown profit and loss statements as well as\n\n\"Excel\" spreadsheets for eight months ending in 2004, showing a net operating income of\n\nabout $33,000 to $34,000 per month. Uppal also showed Hackbart tax statements from\n\n2003 showing ordinary income of $46,632. Uppal did not show Hackbart the 2003\n\nbreak-even analysis showing $91,000 in losses. Uppal explained to Hackbart how the net\n\noperating income had continued to grow from the time Uppal had taken the business out\n\nof bankruptcy. That day, Uppal permitted Hackbart to take the profit and loss statement\n\nand spreadsheets, and though Hackbart was still interested in going forward, he sought\n\nmore documentation. Later, in response to Hackbart's e-mail request, Uppal additionally\n\nprovided, among other documents, an August 2004 invoice showing gas purchases.\n\nHackbart continued to ask Uppal for additional documents including financial statements\n\nhe had been shown but was not permitted to take as well as bank statements; Uppal told\n\nhim they were in numerous boxes with his CPA due to a recent move. In another\n\ntelephone call, Hackbart asked Uppal to break down the sales components of each part of\n\nthe business in detail, and Uppal did so over the phone while Hackbart took detailed\n\nnotes concerning the net revenues for an eight-month period ending August 31, 2004.\n\nHackbart did not see anything surprising in Uppal's numbers, and based on all of Uppal's\n\nstatements, he became convinced they were the actual numbers for the business. The\n\nnext day, while Hackbart and Uppal negotiated the purchase price and terms, Hackbart\n\nagain asked for documents to back up the numbers, but Uppal reiterated that they were\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fnot available. Uppal urged Hackbart to waive the contingency provision on reviewing\n\nbooks and records, and Hackbart did so.\n\n       In November 2004, Hackbart signed a purchase and asset sale agreement (the\n\npurchase agreement) with MTPA. He agreed to pay $1,875,000 for the gas station, car\n\nwash, convenience store, related office space, and the rights to the sandwich franchise in\n\nthe form of $1,075,000 in cash and Hackbart's assumption of an existing $800,000\n\npromissory note against the business. In the purchase agreement, Hackbart\n\nacknowledged he had \"reviewed the books and records prepared by Seller of Chevron in\n\nEncinitas,\" was \"satisfied with those records and hereby removes the contingency in\n\nparagraph 3 of the purchase and sales agreement . . . .\" When Hackbart received the\n\nescrow instructions, however, he took the time to alter or strike out several paragraphs in\n\nthem. First, because he had not received all of the books and records that he had\n\nrequested and had primarily relied on Uppal's representations as to the business's\n\nfinancial statements and revenues, he struck out and initialed a sentence stating he had\n\nnot relied upon seller representations but had conducted his own investigation. He also\n\nstruck out a paragraph entitled \"Purchase Agreement Governs,\" which indicated in part\n\nthat the parties had agreed the escrow instructions \"supersede and void\" any prior\n\nagreements. Hackbart felt that Uppal had in fact made representations to him.\n\n       In May 2005, Hackbart signed final escrow instructions containing a statement\n\nthat the parties agreed \"all warranties and representations of the parties shall survive the\n\nclosing of this escrow.\" The statement was important to Hackbart because his\n\nunderstanding of the businesses' numbers came from Uppal and he did not have the back-\n\n                                              7\n\fup documents he had asked for. During the entire transaction, Uppal did not tell\n\nHackbart about the underreporting of sales tax or that Uppal had underestimated the\n\nbusinesses' expenses, was behind on lease payments, had to borrow on personal credit\n\ncards to fund business expenses, or that the business required loans to meet expenses.\n\nSoni never told Hackbart that he suspected the books were inaccurate or otherwise tried\n\nto share any information concerning what he knew about the business. Escrow closed on\n\nor about May 3, 2005.\n\n       After Hackbart took over the businesses, he observed he was losing money;\n\nexpenses were much higher than expected. When he figured the profits and losses for the\n\nfirst 10 to 11 months of operation, he calculated a net loss of almost $24,000. In order to\n\nrun the businesses, Hackbart had to slash expenses, and had his wife work there five or\n\nsix days a week without pay. In the first few months, he paid sales taxes from his\n\npersonal funds. Hackbart eventually retained Brian Bergmark, a forensic accountant and\n\nCPA who had previously valued gas stations for various estate and litigation matters, to\n\nconduct an analysis of the businesses' financial performance.\n\n       In December 2006, Hackbart sued MTPA, Uppal, Bhavna, and Soni for rescission\n\nand restitution, fraud, breach of contract, \"unjust enrichment,\" an accounting and\n\nimposition of a constructive trust. He later filed a first amended complaint, which\n\ndefendants answered, generally denying the allegations and asserting various affirmative\n\ndefenses.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f       The case proceeded to a bifurcated jury trial on Hackbart's claims for intentional\n\nand negligent misrepresentation as well as fraud by concealment. MTPA had not\n\nappeared and, before trial, the trial court entered its default, striking its answer and\n\noperative cross-complaint. The trial court and Hackbart's counsel characterized the\n\nproceeding as to MTPA as a \"prove-up on damages.\" Hackbart dismissed without\n\nprejudice his first cause of action.4\n\n       At trial, Hackbart's expert, Bergmark, opined that Hackbart had suffered economic\n\ndamages in connection with his purchase of the businesses. He derived these damages by\n\ncalculating an \"indicated value\" using an adjusted earnings (earnings before interest)\n\nanalysis, and applying the multiple that Hackbart was willing to pay (based on the\n\n$1,875,000 purchase price relative to the earnings reported by Uppal), under two\n\ndifferent scenarios. In reaching his conclusions, Bergmark annualized Uppal's\n\nunderreported sales tax, explaining he considered these numbers because if business\n\nearnings were overstated, a person would overpay for what he or she received.\n\nAccording to Bergmark, accounting for Uppal's underpaid sales tax, Hackbart overpaid\n\n\n\n\n4       Before trial, Hackbart's counsel stated: \"We have and will be dismissing the first\ncause of action for rescission. We have sent someone downstairs to file that one\ndismissal, that one cause of action\" The court clerk responded that it had been done, and\nthe trial court acknowledged the cause of action was not reflected in the verdict form.\nHackbart's counsel reiterated that the \"first cause of action for rescission is being\ndismissed without prejudice.\" Hackbart later claimed, and the trial court agreed, he did\nnot dismiss his claim for restitution.\n                                               9\n\f$961,880 for the businesses; additionally factoring in concerns that Uppal had\n\nunderstated other expenses such as payroll, Hackbart overpaid by $1,408,571.5\n\nHackbart's counsel had earlier disclaimed any right to expenses or other consequential\n\ndamages, including lost profits, occurring after the sale.6\n\n       Uppal presented his own expert, Ann Wilson, who criticized Bergmark's valuation\n\napproaches, including his calculation of net operating income. Using Bergmark's\n\nnumbers as to Uppal's underpaid sales tax, Wilson obtained an adjusted net operating\n\nincome figure of $243,090 and applied various multiples to conclude that as of May 2,\n\n2005, the businesses were worth between $1,580,085 and $2,187,810. Wilson also\n\nlooked at a valuation based on the businesses' income stream, reaching a valuation of\n\n$2,131,972. According to Wilson, the best evidence of fair market value (the price a\n\nwilling buyer and seller would pay in an open market) was what actual price was paid,\n\n\n\n5      To get these numbers, Bergmark annualized existing information from January\n2004 to August 2004 and took out the interest component to reach a net income number\nof $306,680. He divided the $306,680 into Hackbart's $1,875,000 purchase price to\nreach a multiple of 6.11, which was what Hackbart was willing to pay as a multiple of\nearnings. Bergmark then factored in the $157,328 that Uppal had underreported in sales\ntaxes to ascertain the businesses' year-end earnings had the sales tax been included, and\nmade the same calculations using the same 6.11 multiplier, to reach an indicated value of\n$913,120. He further adjusted the same numbers by $73,062 to reflect a 17 percent gross\nprofit margin, which Bergmark estimated to be historically correct, and used the same\n6.11 multiplier to get an indicated value of $466,429. From the latter calculation,\nBergmark opined that Hackbart had overpaid $1,408,571 for the businesses ($1,875,000\nminus $466,429). The jury awarded Hackbart $1,400,000 in fraud damages.\n\n6       Section 3343 allows recovery of not only out-of-pocket losses but also \"additional\ndamage\" in the form of expenses or other consequential injury, including lost profits,\nresulting from the fraud. (§ 3343, subds. (1)-(4); Bagdasarian v. Gragnon (1948) 31\nCal.2d 744, 762-763.)\n                                             10\n\fand Bergmark's numbers did not pass a \"reality check\" given Uppal had purchased the\n\nshuttered businesses for $1.1 million in 2001 with bankruptcy court approval.\n\n       Following the presentation of evidence, Bhanva and Soni successfully moved for a\n\nnonsuit on Hackbart's fraud causes of action. With the parties' agreement, the court\n\nthereafter instructed the jury on fraud damages as follows: \"If you decide that the\n\n[plaintiffs] have proved their fraud claims—and that's what they are—against the\n\ndefendant, you must also decide how much money would reasonably compensate the\n\nplaintiffs for the harm. This is called damages. [¶] The amount of damages must\n\ninclude an award for each item of harm that was caused by defendant's wrongful conduct,\n\neven if the particular harm could not have been anticipated. [¶] Plaintiffs do not have to\n\nprove the exact amount of damages that will provide reasonable compensation for the\n\nharm. However, you must not speculate or guess in awarding damages. [¶] The\n\nfollowing are the specific items of damages claimed by the plaintiffs: [¶] One,\n\noverpayment for the business—or businesses; [¶] and prejudgment interest.\"7\n\n\n\n\n7      The trial court did not give CACI No. 1923 regarding out-of-pocket damages,\nwhich would have instructed the jury as to the measure of damages as follows: \"To\ndecide the amount of damages you must determine the [fair market] value of what [name\nof plaintiff] gave and subtract from that amount the [fair market] value of what [he/she/it]\nreceived. [¶] ['Fair market value' is the highest price that a willing buyer would have\npaid on the date of the transaction to a willing seller, assuming: [¶] 1. That there is no\npressure on either one to buy or sell; and [¶] 2. That the buyer and seller know all the\nuses and purposes for which the [insert item] is reasonably capable of being used.]\"\n(CACI No. 1923.) Uppal and Soni explain in their supplemental briefing that they did\nnot request this instruction because they had stipulated that Hackbart would not be\nseeking damages other than out-of-pocket damages permitted under section 3343, i.e.,\nmoneys spent in reliance on fraud or lost profits. (See fn. 6, ante.)\n                                             11\n\f       The jury returned special verdicts in Hackbart's favor against Uppal, awarding\n\nHackbart $1,400,000 in fraud damages, and, after considering additional evidence as to\n\nUppal's finances, $700,000 in punitive damages.\n\n       The trial court then conducted a bench trial on Hackbart's claims for damages\n\nagainst MTPA, as well as his request for a finding of alter ego liability and remaining\n\nequitable cause of action against Uppal, Bhavna and Soni styled \"unjust enrichment.\" It\n\nissued a proposed statement of decision, to which Hackbart and Soni objected and/or\n\nsought clarification. In its final statement of decision, the court (1) entered a default\n\njudgment against MTPA in the amount of $1,400,000; (2) found the evidence did not\n\nsupport a conclusion that recognition of the corporate form would work an injustice to\n\nHackbart; and (3) found both Uppal and Soni were unjustly enriched: Uppal in the\n\namount of the $155,000 bonus he had received at the close of the sale, and Soni in the\n\namount of the $232,000 distribution he received at the close of sale. The court found the\n\naward against Uppal duplicative of the jury's fraud damage award, and required Hackbart\n\nto make an election before entry of judgment. It declined to impose liability on Bhavna,\n\nfinding no evidence she participated in the business management or had awareness of its\n\noperations, but was merely a MTPA shareholder who relied upon her husband Uppal's\n\nconduct and direction. On the other hand, the court found Soni, a sophisticated\n\nbusinessman, was aware the business was being sold for more than it was worth and\n\nknew Hackbart was shown books and records that he considered to be unreliable,\n\nwarranting a conclusion that it was unjust for Soni to realize the $232,000 return on his\n\ninvestment in MTPA.\n\n                                              12\n\f       On March 2, 2011, the court entered judgment in Hackbart's favor awarding\n\n$1,400,000 fraud and breach of contract damages against MTPA; $1,400,000 in fraud\n\ndamages and $700,000 in punitive damages against Uppal; and $232,000 in unjust\n\nenrichment damages against Soni.\n\n       Uppal moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and for a new\n\ntrial. He argued a new trial was warranted in part due to an error of law in that Hackbart\n\nhad failed to establish a proper measure of damages, and also for excessive damages\n\nresulting from Hackbart's failure to present evidence of the businesses' actual value on the\n\ndate of sale. He argued JNOV was proper for the latter failure of proof, as well as\n\ninsufficient evidence of Hackbart's reasonable reliance. On April 15, 2011, the trial court\n\ndenied both motions, as well as Soni's requests to join them. Thereafter, Uppal and Soni\n\nseparately appealed from the March 2, 2011 judgment; Uppal identifying that portion of\n\nthe judgment following the jury trial, and Soni identifying that portion of the judgment\n\nfollowing the bench trial. Hackbart appeals the March 2, 2011 judgment both as to the\n\njury and bench trials.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n                            I. Uppal's and Soni's Contentions\n\nA. The Evidence is Sufficient To Support the Jury's Findings of Justifiable Reliance on\n\nUppal's Fraud\n\n       Uppal and Soni contend that based on the trial evidence, the jury could not\n\nreasonably have concluded that Hackbart acted with justifiable reliance on anything\n\nUppal did or did not say concerning the Chevron station. They characterize Hackbart as\n\n                                            13\n\fa \"sophisticated buyer\" with experience in the car wash industry, and point out, among\n\nother facts, Hackbart was never satisfied with the financial documents he had sought\n\nfrom Uppal and could not conduct an independent analysis to confirm the businesses'\n\nfinancials, but went ahead in any event with the purchase. Uppal and Soni argue that\n\nunder the circumstances, the trial court should have granted Uppal's JNOV motion on this\n\nground.\n\n       We asked the parties to brief Uppal and Soni's failure to identify the trial court's\n\nApril 18, 2011 amended minute order denying JNOV in their notices of appeal. Having\n\nconsidered the supplemental briefing, we conclude neither preserved an appeal from that\n\nseparately appealable order. (§ 904.1; In re Baycol Cases I & II (2011) 51 Cal.4th 751,\n\n761, fn. 8 [if order is appealable, an appeal must be taken or the right to appellate review\n\nis forfeited]; see Maughan v. Google Technology, Inc. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1242,\n\n1247; Sole Energy Co. v. Petrominerals Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 212, 239 [notice\n\nof appeal must identify the particular order being appealed].)\n\n       However, their contention on appeal as to the element of justifiable reliance is in\n\nsubstance a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, and because the jury resolved disputed\n\nfacts in reaching its finding, on Uppal's and Soni's appeals from the March 2, 2011\n\njudgment, we may review the record for substantial evidence. (Winograd v. American\n\nBroadcasting Co. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 624, 632; Donovan v. Poway Unified School\n\nDist. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 567, 581-582.) A challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support a judgment may be made for the first time on appeal. (See, e.g.,\n\nTahoe National Bank v. Phillips (1971) 4 Cal.3d 11, 21, fn. 17.) \" 'When a finding of fact\n\n                                             14\n\fis attacked on the ground that there is not any substantial evidence to sustain it, the power\n\nof an appellate court begins and ends with the determination as to whether there is any\n\nsubstantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will support the finding of\n\nfact.' [Citations] [¶] 'It is well established that a reviewing court starts with the\n\npresumption that the record contains evidence to sustain every finding of fact.' \"\n\n(Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 881.) The statement relied upon\n\nby Uppal and Soni in Sweatman v. Department of Veterans Affairs (2001) 25 Cal.4th 62,\n\n68—that a party moving for JNOV \"may appeal from the judgment or from the order\n\ndenying the motion for [JNOV], or both\"—recognizes that a sufficiency of the evidence\n\nchallenge may be asserted by either means.\n\n       1. Reasonable Reliance Element of Fraud\n\n       In establishing fraud, including fraud by omission, Hackbart was required to prove\n\nactual, justifiable, reliance Uppal's on misrepresentations or omissions. Importantly,\n\n\" ' \"[i]t is not . . . necessary that [a plaintiff's] reliance upon the truth of the fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation be the sole or even the predominant or decisive factor in influencing\n\nhis conduct. . . . It is enough that the representation has played a substantial part, and so\n\nhas been a substantial factor, in influencing his decision.\" ' [Citations.] Regarding\n\nconcealment claims, the plaintiff may establish this element by showing that 'had the\n\nomitted information been disclosed, [he or she] would have been aware of it and behaved\n\ndifferently.' \" (OCM Principal Opportunities Fund, L.P. v. CIBC World Markets Corp.\n\n(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 835, 864 (OCM).) Uppal and Soni do not challenge the evidence\n\nsupporting the element of actual reliance, and Hackbart's testimony alone constitutes\n\n                                                15\n\fsubstantial evidence he in fact relied on the financial information provided by Uppal, as\n\nwell as Soni's failure to disclose his suspicions about the soundness of the businesses'\n\nfinancial operations. (Major v. Western Home Ins. Co. (2009) 169 Cal.App.4th 1197,\n\n1208 [testimony of a single credible witness, even if a party, can be substantial evidence\n\nto support a judgment].)\n\n       To establish his reliance was justifiable, Hackbart must show the \" 'circumstances\n\nwere such to make it reasonable for [him] to accept [Uppal's] statements without an\n\nindependent inquiry or investigation.' [Citation.] The reasonableness of the plaintiff's\n\nreliance is judged by reference to the plaintiff's knowledge and experience. [Citation.]\n\n' \"Except in the rare case where the undisputed facts leave no room for a reasonable\n\ndifference of opinion, the question of whether a plaintiff's reliance is reasonable is a\n\nquestion of fact.\" ' \" (OCM, supra, 157 Cal.App.4th at pp. 864-865; see Alliance\n\nMortgage Co. v. Rothwell (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1226, 1239; Wilhelm v. Pray, Price,\n\nWilliams & Russell (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1324, 1332.) \"Generally, '[a] plaintiff will be\n\ndenied recovery only if his conduct is manifestly unreasonable in the light of his own\n\nintelligence or information. It must appear that he put faith in representations that were\n\n\"preposterous\" or \"shown by facts within his observation to be so patently and obviously\n\nfalse that he must have closed his eyes to avoid discovery of the truth.\" [Citation.] Even\n\nin case of a mere negligent misrepresentation, a plaintiff is not barred unless his conduct,\n\nin the light of his own information and intelligence, is preposterous and irrational.' \"\n\n(OCM, at p. 865; Beckwith v. Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1067.)\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       2. Analysis\n\n       We conclude the record contains substantial evidence to support the jury's finding\n\nthat Hackbart reasonably relied on Uppal's misrepresentations and omissions. Contrary\n\nto Uppal's characterization of Hackbart as a sophisticated buyer, the evidence was that\n\nHackbart, who had never been licensed as a CPA nor completed a master's degree in\n\ntaxation, worked for approximately two years as an accountant, became a resort manager,\n\ninstalled cable television, worked as an administrator, and became an investment\n\ncounselor with Bank of America. He purchased one business, a car wash, in 1998, with a\n\npartner. As Uppal acknowledges, Hackbart had never before purchased a business\n\ninvolving a gas station. The evidence does not support Uppal's characterization of\n\nHackbart as a sophisticated purchaser of businesses.\n\n       The evidence shows Uppal, himself a CPA who had bought and sold multiple\n\nautomotive oil change franchises, misrepresented to Hackbart the state of the station's\n\nfinancials, and concealed not only the 2003 break-even analysis reflecting significant\n\nlosses, but also his underpayment of sales taxes. The jury found Uppal's\n\nmisrepresentations were intentional. And, Hackbart made reasonable efforts to ascertain\n\nmaterial financial information. During face-to-face meetings, Uppal showed Hackbart\n\nvarious profit and loss statements and spreadsheets with financial information, and\n\nHackbart later pursued and carefully compiled net revenue numbers from information\n\nthat Uppal broke down to him over the telephone. When Hackbart asked for more\n\ndetailed back-up documentation, Uppal responded with a plausible excuse, telling\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fHackbart the papers were out of his reach due to his CPA's recent move. Hackbart\n\nultimately accepted Uppal's assurances that the numbers he provided were correct.\n\n       Uppal and Soni suggest that Hackbart's reliance was unjustified because Uppal\n\nwas a stranger, and Hackbart should have conducted background checks, independently\n\nverified Uppal's profit and loss numbers, contacted a gas supplier, or hired consultants to\n\nassist him in evaluating the information provided by Uppal. However, \"the law is clear\n\nthat ' \" '[n]o rogue should enjoy his ill-gotten plunder for the simple reason that his victim\n\nis by chance a fool.' \" ' [Citation.] ' \" 'Negligence on the part of the plaintiff in failing to\n\ndiscover the falsity of a statement is no defense when the misrepresentation was\n\nintentional rather than negligent.' [Citation.] 'Nor is a plaintiff held to the standard of\n\nprecaution or of minimum knowledge of a hypothetical, reasonable man.' \" ' \" (Beckwith\n\nv. Dahl, supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at p. 1067; see also Boeken v. Philip Morris, Inc. (2005)\n\n127 Cal.App.4th 1640, 1666-1667; Hartong v. Partake, Inc. (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 942,\n\n964-965.) And, any suspicions Hackbart may have had when Uppal denied his requests\n\nfor additional information were \"repeatedly deflected by plausible assertions of fact.\"\n\n(Hartong v. Partake, Inc., at pp. 965-966.) \"If the defendant makes a plausible\n\nexplanation of fact, the plaintiff is not required to further investigate.\" (Id. at p. 966.)\n\n       The circumstances here are akin to those in Hartong v. Partake, Inc., supra, 266\n\nCal.App.2d 942, in which plaintiffs without franchising experience sought help from\n\ndefendants who held themselves out as expert consultants to potential franchisees and\n\nwho used \"confidence-inspiring\" materials to induce trust. (Id. at pp. 949, 965.) The\n\nplaintiffs invested after being knowingly given false information by a supposed agent\n\n                                               18\n\fconcerning minimum net income based on past sales records, the nature and level of\n\nsupport they would receive, and information concerning the franchisor (id. at pp. 953-\n\n954, 957), but the performance was not as promised and the plaintiffs discovered that\n\nthey had no actual business relationship with the franchisor, contrary to representations\n\nmade to them. (Id. at pp. 953-954, 956.) The defendant argued the plaintiffs' reliance\n\nwas unreasonable because they were negligent in failing to ascertain the extent of the\n\nagent's true authority, and had made some independent investigation of the facts. (Id. at\n\np. 964.) The appellate court disagreed, pointing out the plaintiffs had no prior experience\n\nwith franchising or distributorships, the defendant held itself out as an expert consultant\n\nand provided materials that backed its statements, and plaintiff's suspicions were allayed\n\nby defendant's plausible assertions as to the franchisor's relationships. (Id. at pp. 965-\n\n966.) Under these circumstances, the court concluded there was no bar to the plaintiffs'\n\nrecovery by the fact some of them may have relied to some extent on independent advice\n\nor checked the company's Better Business Bureau rating. (Id. at p. 966.)\n\n       As in Hartong, the fact Hackbart conducted some investigation before the close of\n\nescrow does not preclude a finding of justifiable reliance. An independent investigation\n\ndoes not preclude reliance on representations where the falsity of statements is not\n\napparent from an inspection, or the person making the representations has superior\n\nknowledge, or the party relying thereon is not competent to judge the facts without expert\n\nassistance. (Bagdasarian v. Gragnon, supra, 31 Cal.2d at p. 748; Hartong v. Partake,\n\nInc., supra, 266 Cal.App.2d at p. 966.) In view of Uppal's assertions of fact to Hackbart\n\nregarding the backup financial numbers, Hackbart was not required to conduct an\n\n                                             19\n\findependent investigation. (See Linden Partners v. Wilshire Linden Associates (1998) 62\n\nCal.App.4th 508, 529.) Nor was Hackbart required to hire professionals to confirm the\n\ntruth of Uppal's alleged representations, given Uppal's superior knowledge about the\n\nbusinesses' financial condition. (See Furla v. Jon Douglas Co. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th\n\n1069, 1079 [buyer not required to hire a professional to discover falsity of seller's\n\nrepresentations concerning area of real property]; Hartong, at p. 966; Curran v. Heslop\n\n(1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 476, 481-482 [reasonable reliance supported by the evidence even\n\nwhere buyer conducted physical inspection of house, where inspection did not reveal\n\napparent building code violations].)\n\n       In sum, Hackbart made a reasonable effort to ascertain the financial information\n\nconcerning the Chevron station and related businesses, received plausible assertions as to\n\nwhy Uppal could not provide backup financial information in the face of his requests, and\n\nhe accepted at face value the balance sheets and spreadsheets given to him by Uppal, who\n\nhad superior knowledge of the facts. This is not a case in which Hackbart \"put faith in\n\nrepresentations that were 'preposterous' or 'shown by facts within his observation to be so\n\npatently and obviously false that he must have closed his eyes to avoid discovery of the\n\ntruth.' \" (OCM, supra, 157 Cal.App.4th at pp. 864-865; see also Cortez v. Weymouth\n\n(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d 140, 151-152.) His conduct, in the light of his own information\n\nand intelligence was not \"preposterous and irrational.\" (Hartong v. Partake, Inc., supra,\n\n266 Cal.App.2d at p. 965). Substantial evidence supports the jury's finding that Hackbart\n\njustifiably relied on Uppal's misrepresentations and omissions.\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\fB. Claim of Failure of Proof of Out-of-Pocket Measure of Damages\n\n       Uppal and Soni contend the trial court prejudicially abused its discretion by (1)\n\nallowing the jury to award damages contrary to the exclusive out-of-pocket measure of\n\ndamages set forth in section 3343 for fraud \"involving the 'purchase, sale or exchange of\n\nproperty'. . . .\" and (2) preventing Uppal from fully presenting his own expert testimony\n\non the businesses' actual value.8 They maintain Hackbart did not put on evidence of the\n\nactual value of the gas station and car wash on the date of purchase and that Hackbart's\n\nexpert Bergmark admitted as much when he testified that he based his damages\n\ncalculation on Hackbart's desired \"multiple of earnings.\" Uppal argues the failure of\n\nproof requires that judgment be entered in his favor on his JNOV motion. Soni argues\n\nthe failure of proof on damages means there is no evidence to support the trial court's\n\nfinding that Hackbart paid more for the businesses than what they were worth, and that he\n\n(Soni) was unjustly enriched.\n\n       Hackbart responds that the parties used the correct measure of damages at trial as\n\nevidenced in part by the jury instructions; that Uppal and Soni's challenge is merely to his\n\nexpert's methodology in calculating value, which is an issue of credibility that cannot be\n\n\n8       We reject the latter contention out of hand, because the record shows that while\nthe trial court initially sustained objections that would have limited Ann Wilson's opinion\ntestimony, counsel for Hackbart then withdrew his objections, telling counsel for Uppal\nto \"[a]sk [Wilson] whatever you want to ask.\" Though Uppal acknowledges counsel's\nwithdrawal of the objection, he maintains he was \"denied the opportunity to fully put on\nevidence of actual value for the gas station.\" Uppal does not, however, explain what\nadditional evidence Wilson would have presented. Further, to the extent Soni purports to\nchallenge the jury's fraud damage award as excessive, his failure to move for a new trial\non that point bars the claim on appeal. (Jamison v. Jamison (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 714,\n719.)\n                                            21\n\frelitigated in an appellate court. Hackbart asserts Bergmark's testimony showed the\n\nextent Hackbart overpaid for the businesses, satisfying section 3343, and it was countered\n\nby that of Uppal's expert, Wilson, who disagreed with Bergmark's conclusions and\n\nopined that a market-based approach was a more proper evaluation to determine the\n\nbusinesses' actual value. He points out it was the jury's task to weigh and evaluate the\n\nvarious expert approaches on how to best calculate the actual value of the gas station and\n\ncar wash (the value of what he received) so that it could be compared with what Hackbart\n\nactually paid.\n\n       1. Out-of-Pocket Measure of Damages\n\n       One who is defrauded in the purchase or sale of property is entitled to recover the\n\ndifference between the actual value of that with which the defrauded party parted and the\n\nactual value of that received. (§ 3343;9 Alliance Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell, supra, 10\n\nCal.4th at p. 1240; Bagdasarian v. Gragnon, supra, 31 Cal.2d 744, 762; Fragale v.\n\n\n\n9        Section 3343 provides in part: \"(a) One defrauded in the purchase, sale or\nexchange of property is entitled to recover the difference between the actual value of that\nwith which the defrauded person parted and the actual value of that which he received,\ntogether with any additional damage arising from the particular transaction, including any\nof the following: [¶] (1) Amounts actually and reasonably expended in reliance upon\nthe fraud. [¶] . . . [¶] (4) Where the defrauded party has been induced by reason of the\nfraud to purchase or otherwise acquire the property in question, an amount which will\ncompensate him for any loss of profits or other gains which were reasonably anticipated\nand would have been earned by him from the use or sale of the property had it possessed\nthe characteristics fraudulently attributed to it by the party committing the fraud . . . .\n[¶] . . . [¶] (b) Nothing in this section shall do either of the following: [¶] (1) Permit\nthe defrauded person to recover any amount measured by the difference between the\nvalue of property as represented and the actual value thereof. [¶] (2) Deny to any person\nhaving a cause of action for fraud or deceit any legal or equitable remedies to which such\nperson may be entitled.\"\n                                            22\n\fFaulkner (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 229, 236.) The term value ordinarily means market\n\nvalue. (Bagdasarian, at p. 753; Colgan v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. (2006) 135\n\nCal.App.4th 663, 675; Glendale Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Marina View Heights Dev.\n\nCo. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 101, 141.) \"The definition of market value and the principles\n\ngoverning its ascertainment are the same as those applicable to the valuation of property\n\nin eminent domain proceedings [citation] and in ad valorem taxation of property.\"\n\n(Glendale Fed., at p. 141.)\n\n        Market value \" 'is normally determined by the price at which [property] could be\n\nresold in an open market or by private sale if its quality or other characteristics which\n\naffect its value were known.' \" (Bagdasarian v. Gragnon, supra, 31 Cal.2d at p. 753,\n\nquoting Rest., Torts, § 549, com. c; see also In re Marriage of Hewitson (1983) 142\n\nCal.App.3d 874, 882 (Hewitson) [fair market value is \" 'the price at which the property\n\nwould change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any\n\ncompulsion to buy or sell' and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts\"].)\n\nDamages are to be calculated as of the date of the transaction. (Salahutdin v. Valley of\n\nCalifornia, Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 555, 568; McCue v. Bruce Enterprises, Inc.\n\n(1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 21, 31.) Hackbart had the burden to prove facts entitling him to\n\ndamages in accordance with that measure. (Nece v. Bennett (1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 494,\n\n497.)\n\n        The out-of-pocket measure is contrasted with the benefit-of-the-bargain rule,\n\nwhich is \" 'concerned with satisfying the expectancy interest of the defrauded plaintiff by\n\nputting him in the position he would have enjoyed if the false representation relied upon\n\n                                             23\n\fhad been true; it awards the difference in value between what the plaintiff actually\n\nreceived and what he was fraudulently led to believe he would receive.' \" (Alliance\n\nMortgage Co. v. Rothwell, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 1240; see 6 Witkin, Summary of Cal.\n\nLaw (10th ed. 2005) Torts, § 1710, p. 1238.) In the case of a party defrauded in the\n\npurchase or sale of property, section 3343 specifically excludes benefit-of-the-bargain\n\ndamages by prohibiting the defrauded person from recovering \"any amount measured by\n\nthe difference between the value of property as represented and the actual value thereof.\"\n\n(§ 3343, subd. (b)(1); Fragale v. Faulkner, supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at p. 236.)\n\n       2. Invited Error\n\n       Under the doctrine of invited error, if a party's conduct induces the commission of\n\nan error, the party is estopped from claiming on appeal that the judgment should be\n\nreversed because of that error. (Norgart v. Upjohn Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 403; Mary\n\nM. v. City of Los Angeles (1991) 54 Cal.3d 202, 212.) \"As a leading treatise puts it, an\n\nappellant 'cannot complain of error [it] personally \"invited.\" In other words, one whose\n\nconduct induces or invites the commission of error by the trial court is estopped from\n\nasserting it as a ground for reversal on appeal.' \" (Transport Ins. Co. v. TIG Ins. Co.\n\n(2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 984, 1000.) The invited error doctrine applies with particular\n\nforce in the area of jury instructions; a party that requests, or acquiesces in, a particular\n\njury instruction cannot appeal the giving of that instruction or the sufficiency of evidence\n\nof matters contrary to the instruction. (Ibid.; Nevis v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. (1954) 43\n\nCal.2d 626, 627-630 [defendant invited error in requesting jury instruction that a utilities\n\ncompany was permitted to maintain power lines a distance of 22 feet above the ground\n\n                                              24\n\fand failing to request an instruction that an 18-foot minimum clearance was permitted in\n\nthe subject accident area, which estopped defendant from arguing the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to support a finding on negligence in respect to violating a 22-foot rule, or\n\nthat the violation of that rule did not contribute to the plaintiff's injuries].)\n\n       Our request for supplemental briefing sought input from the parties as to whether\n\nUppal and Soni had invited error on the measure of damages, including by failing to\n\nobject to the trial court's fraud damages jury instruction or Bergmark's opinion testimony.\n\nBoth Uppal and Soni concede they jointly proposed the damages instruction, asserting it\n\n\"subsumed the requirements of Civil Code Section 3343\" when it stated damages as\n\n\"overpayment for the businesses.\" According to Uppal and Soni, they did not invite error\n\nby requesting the instruction because the reasonable and only construction of those terms\n\nmeans inclusion of the actual value (or fair market value) of the business on the date of\n\nsale. As for Bergmark's testimony, Uppal and Soni maintain they had no reason to object\n\nand they have not challenged its admission on appeal, because it was favorable to them in\n\nthat he had no opinion as to valuation, a necessary element of the section 3343 measure\n\nof damages.\n\n       \" ' \" 'In a civil case, each of the parties must propose complete and comprehensive\n\ninstructions in accordance with his theory of the litigation; if the parties do not do so, the\n\ncourt has no duty to instruct on its own motion.' [Citations.]\" [Citation.] Neither a trial\n\ncourt nor a reviewing court in a civil action is obligated to seek out theories plaintiff\n\nmight have advanced, or to articulate for him that which he has left unspoken.' \" (Metcalf\n\nv. County of San Joaquin (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1121, 1130-1131.) And, with regard to the\n\n                                                25\n\fmeasure of damages, \"It is well established that where a case is tried, without objection\n\non the part of the defendant, on the theory that a certain rule for the measure of damages\n\nis correct, the defendant cannot urge for the first time on appeal that the case was tried on\n\nan erroneous theory as to damages. [Citations.] Accordingly, the theory on which the\n\ncase is tried, that under the issues framed certain damages are recoverable, will be\n\nadhered to by the appellate court on appeal.\" (Evans v. Faught (1965) 231 Cal.App.2d\n\n698, 713-714.)\n\n       We conclude that under these principles, invited error bars Uppal's and Soni's\n\ncontention that the trial court erred when it \"allowed the jury to find damages . . .\n\ncontrary to the express provisions of Civil Code section 3343\" or \"fail[ed] to apply\" the\n\nproper measure of damages. (Emphasis and some capitalization omitted.) The record\n\ndoes not contain any motions in limine as to Bergmark's testimony and the parties do not\n\npoint to any argument on Uppal or Soni's behalf to the court that it was somehow\n\npermitting the jury to award a legally incorrect measure of damage. Rather, the trial\n\ncourt instructed the jury in accordance with the parties' agreed-upon jury instruction,\n\nwhich unspecifically told the jury that Hackbart was entitled to damages in the form of\n\nhis overpayment for the businesses. Each party presented experts who used different\n\ntheories and methods to explain why Hackbart paid, or did not pay, more than what the\n\nbusinesses were worth. Even if this instruction \"subsumed\" the notion that the\n\nbusinesses' worth is to be determined by fair market value, as Uppal and Soni maintain, it\n\nwas so general, lacking clarity, and incomplete that Uppal and Soni by offering it acceded\n\nto the jury's calculation of damages by any method the experts proposed to establish the\n\n                                             26\n\famount of Hackbart's overpayment. We cannot say the requested instruction was an\n\nincorrect statement of the law, but it was certainly vague and incomplete. Thus, Uppal\n\nand Soni should have sought additional or clarifying instructions in order to preserve a\n\nclaim that the court erred by submitting an erroneous measure of damages to the jury or\n\npermitting the jury to reach an erroneous measure. (See, e.g., Metcalf v. County of San\n\nJoaquin, supra, 42 Cal.4th at pp. 1130-1131.)\n\n       We acknowledge Uppal moved for a new trial on grounds of excessive damages,\n\nas well as on grounds the verdict was \"against law\" or the result of an error in law. But\n\nprinciples of invited error nevertheless apply where a trial court, as here, has denied a\n\nmotion for new trial. (Hand Electronics, Inc. v. Snowline Joint Unified School Dist.\n\n(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 862, 870-871 [distinguishing application of invited error\n\nprinciples in connection with an order granting a new trial from an order denying a new\n\ntrial; \" ' \". . . the rules applicable to . . . invited error or to estoppel[] have no application\n\nwhen an appellate court is considering the propriety of an order granting a new trial. If\n\nthe trial court had denied the new trial such error would be considered waived by failure\n\nto object\" ' \" (italics added)]; Neal v. Montgomery Elevator Co. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th\n\n1194, 1198; see McCarty v. Department of Transportation (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 955,\n\n984; contra, Roberson v. J.C. Penney Co. (1955) 136 Cal.App.2d 1, 4-5 [on appeal from\n\nan order granting a new trial, invited error by offering of jury instructions will not restrict\n\nappellate court from considering the issue].) And, to prevail on a motion for new trial on\n\ngrounds of error in law, Uppal was required to have excepted to the error in the measure\n\nof damages. (Code Civ. Proc., § 657(7).) Nor is Uppal's claim saved by the fact he\n\n                                                27\n\fmoved for a new trial attacking the damages as a result of passion or prejudice, because\n\nin his motion, he \"did not in so doing contend that the measure of damages upon which\n\nthe jury was instructed was improper.\" (See Easton v. Strassburger (1984) 152\n\nCal.App.3d 90, 108, [appellate court rejected appellant's claim that the jury used the\n\nwrong measure in awarding damages even when appellant had moved for a new trial on\n\ngrounds of damages being the result of passion or prejudice; the respondent and trial\n\ncourt relied in part on appellant's acquiescence in the use of the measure of damages,\n\nappellant did not object to the respondent's evidence regarding damages (cost of repair)\n\nand in fact offered its own evidence on this cost item, and in the absence of any objection\n\nby appellant to use of cost of repair as the proper measure, it would be unfair to allow the\n\nappellant to raise the issue].)\n\n       Based on these principles and the invited error doctrine, we conclude the trial\n\ncourt was not required to override the parties' choice of jury instructions and suggest a\n\ndifferent measure of damages to the jury. Nor will we disturb the jury's compensatory\n\nfraud damages verdict, which was reached after a weighing of both parties' expert\n\ntestimony and necessarily based on the measure of damages proposed by the parties.\n\n                     II. Uppal's Challenge to Punitive Damages Award\n\n       Uppal advances a two-pronged argument against the jury's $700,000 punitive\n\ndamages award. First, he maintains that because Hackbart failed to establish actual\n\ncompensatory damages, he cannot be held responsible for punitive damages. Because we\n\nhave not disturbed the jury's compensatory damages verdict, that contention fails. Uppal\n\nfurther contends the $700,000 award is contrary to law as it has no rational relationship to\n\n                                             28\n\fhis financial condition, namely the fact he is insolvent and there was no proof he had any\n\nnet worth. Uppal summarizes his testimony at the punitive damages phase as indicating\n\n(1) he had no regular employment but acted as a consultant for various businesses; (2) he\n\nearned between $60,000 and $96,000 in 2010; (3) he did not own a business; (4) he\n\nowned a vehicle worth $10,000 and a home with no equity; (5) his 2009 tax return\n\nshowed an adjusted gross income of $112,805.00; and (6) he had no real estate other than\n\nhis heavily-encumbered home, no stocks or bonds, and no cash savings. He asks us to\n\nstrike the punitive damages award.\n\n       Hackbart responds that Uppal's summary of the evidence is incomplete; that the\n\nrecord shows the jury relied on other financial condition information from expert\n\nBergmark and also evidence of Uppal's access to loans from his mother and other family\n\nmembers, Uppal's ability to practice as a CPA, the existence of $100,000 cash in an\n\nescrow account, Uppal's $93,000 average yearly earning capacity, the $1,075,000 in cash\n\nUppal received from the sale of the Chevron station, and Uppal's 200910 tax return,\n\nwhich reflected $266,800 in earnings.\n\nA. Legal Principles and Review Standards\n\n       This court set out a comprehensive overview of punitive damages law in Kelly v.\n\nHaag (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 910, 914-915: \"An award of punitive damages hinges on\n\nthree factors: the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct; the reasonableness of the\n\n\n10     Hackbart describes this return in his brief as being from 2011, but the tax return\nHackbart refers to is actually from 2009. Presumably Hackbart's reference to a 2011 tax\nreturn is a typographical error, as the punitive damages phase took place in December\n2010.\n                                             29\n\frelationship between the award and the plaintiff's harm; and, in view of the defendant's\n\nfinancial condition, the amount necessary to punish him or her and discourage future\n\nwrongful conduct.\" (Id. at pp. 914-915.) Under those standards, it was Hackbart's\n\nburden to present actual and meaningful evidence of Uppal's financial condition at the\n\ntime of trial, net worth was not the only permissible evidence of ability to pay, and the\n\nevidence must be such that would permit the \" 'jury and a reviewing court to determine\n\nwhether the amount of the award is appropriate and, in particular, whether it is excessive\n\nin light of the central goal of deterrence.' \" (Id. at pp. 915-916.) We are guided by the\n\n\" ' \"historically honored standard of reversing as excessive only those judgments which\n\nthe entire record . . . indicates were rendered as a result of passion and prejudice.\" ' \" (Id.\n\nat p. 916.) We review independently Uppal's challenge to the amount of the punitive\n\ndamages award. (Simon v. San Paolo U.S. Holding Co., Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1159,\n\n1172; Major v. Western Home Ins. Co. (2009) 169 Cal.App.4th 1197, 1222.)\n\nB. Analysis\n\n       Here, Hackbart called Uppal to testify concerning his financial condition, and also\n\npresented Bergmark to testify about Uppal's ability to pay certain sums of money, given\n\nhis income and ability to earn. The evidence showed Uppal's self-employment consulting\n\nincome was generally in the range of $60,000 to $72,000 per year, however, his self-\n\nemployment income reported to the IRS for 2009 was $266,800 (with $14,585 in\n\nexpenses against income). Uppal also received $12,000 per year in rental income and\n\nobtained loans from his mother and other family members to pay other debts. Without\n\nobjection, Bergmark testified that Uppal's yearly earnings given his education, age and\n\n                                              30\n\fexperience, and accounting for government and other benefits, were $93,632. Taking\n\ninto account his life expectancy (Uppal was 50 years old at the time), the present value of\n\nUppal's projected earnings was over $1.1 million. And, according to Bergmark, if Uppal\n\ncontinued to earn at the level his 2009 tax return indicated, he would be able to pay\n\n$3,152,261 in present value dollars. Bergmark did not look at Uppal's adjusted gross\n\nincome, which was $112,805, because Uppal had closed the businesses from which he\n\nreported net operating losses. Bergmark admitted on cross-examination that he did not\n\naccount for Uppal's expenses other than business expenses relating to his marketing or\n\nUppal's cost of living. Nor did Bergmark take into account Uppal's income tax\n\nobligations to the state or federal government; he explained he only performed an earning\n\ncapacity analysis.\n\n       On this record, we vacate the $700,000 punitive damages award in view of the\n\nabsence of meaningful evidence of Uppal's actual wealth or ability to pay such a damages\n\naward. In Kenly v. Ukegawa (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 49, this court expressly rejected the\n\nplaintiff's argument that the punitive damages award in that case could be based solely on\n\nthe defendant's alleged profit: \"An award based solely on the alleged 'profit' gained by\n\nthe defendant, in the absence of evidence of net worth, raises the potential of its crippling\n\nor destroying the defendant, focusing as it does solely on the assets side of the balance\n\nsheet without examining the liabilities side of the balance sheet. Without evidence of the\n\nentire financial picture, an award based on 'profit' could leave a defendant devoid of\n\nassets with which to pay his other liabilities.\" (Id. at p. 57.) We made it clear that our\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\fholding did not preclude such a showing in all cases, however, as long as there was some\n\nevidence to demonstrate that the defendant would not be crippled by the award. (Id. at\n\np. 57, fn. 7.) In Kelly v. Haag, we held a $75,000 punitive damages award lacked\n\nevidentiary support where the plaintiff only produced evidence of the defendant's\n\nstatements about certain properties and assets without evidence that he still owned them\n\nat the time of trial, and produced no evidence of the defendant's liabilities, requiring the\n\ntrial court to speculate as to any liabilities. (Kelly v. Haag, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at\n\np. 917.)\n\n       The evidence here fails for the same reasons we expressed in the above cases. As\n\nstated, Hackbart bore the burden of proving Uppal's financial condition or ability to pay\n\nfor purposes of the award (Adams v. Murakami (1991) 54 Cal.3d 105, 119; Baxter v.\n\nPeterson (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 673, 680; Kelly v. Haag, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at\n\np. 916), which was required to be based on \"some evidence of the defendant's actual\n\nwealth. Normally, evidence of liabilities should accompany evidence of assets, and\n\nevidence of expenses should accompany evidence of income.\" (Baxter v. Peterson, at\n\np. 680.)\n\n       While the jury had before it evidence of Uppal's income, his earning capacity and\n\nthe present value of his lifetime earnings, it had no meaningful evidence of Uppal's\n\nliabilities. Absent such evidence, the jury was unable to \"assure that the award punishes\n\nbut [would] not cripple or bankrupt [him].\" (Kenly v. Ukegawa, supra, 16 Cal.App.4th at\n\np. 57; see also Baxter v. Peterson, supra, 150 Cal.App.4th at p. 681 [though record\n\nshowed the defendant owned substantial assets, it was silent with regard to her liabilities,\n\n                                             32\n\fand thus insufficient for a reviewing court to evaluate her ability to pay $75,000 in\n\npunitive damages].) Bergmark's testimony was limited to the present value of Uppal's\n\nearning capacity.\n\n       Hackbart suggests Uppal failed to produce adequate and timely financial condition\n\nevidence for the jury's evaluation. However, the record indicates Uppal provided\n\nHackbart's counsel with documents for the purpose of showing his financial condition for\n\nthe punitive damages phase, and Hackbart does not demonstrate he was prevented from\n\nobtaining evidence of Uppal's net worth or that he lacked any meaningful resource to\n\nobtain evidence of Uppal's financial condition or net worth. There is no indication Uppal\n\nfailed to comply with court orders for such information, or that any void in financial\n\ncondition information was attributable solely to Uppal. (See Mike Davidov Co. v. Issod\n\n(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 597, 608-609 [defendant waived any challenge to complain about\n\nthe lack of evidence of net worth for purposes of punitive damages because he did not\n\ncomply with a court order to produce his financial records]; Caira v. Offner (2005) 126\n\nCal.App.4th 12, 40-41 [trial court ordered defendant to produce a current financial\n\nstatement; Court of Appeal held any insufficiency in the record as to his financial\n\ncondition was attributable solely to defendant's failure to comply with a court order].)\n\nBecause Hackbart had a full and fair opportunity to present his case for punitive\n\ndamages, we do not find any basis to remand the matter for retrial. (See Kelly v. Haag,\n\nsupra, 145 Cal.App.4th at p. 920.)\n\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\f                            III. Restitution Award Against Soni\n\n       Soni contends the trial court reversibly erred when it awarded Hackbart restitution\n\non a theory of unjust enrichment. Pointing out he obtained a nonsuit on Hackbart's fraud\n\ncauses of action, he maintains Hackbart's claims of unjust enrichment/restitution are not\n\nstand-alone causes of action but are merely duplicative of Hackbart's fraud claims as\n\nevidenced by the allegations of Hackbart's operative complaint, and thus there was no\n\nlegal basis on which Hackbart could premise a theory of unjust enrichment. He argues\n\nthat even if Hackbart could maintain a claim for unjust enrichment, there is no basis for a\n\nrestitution award against him without evidence to support a finding that Hackbart\n\nsuffered fraud damages from the sale.\n\n       Hackbart correctly concedes unjust enrichment is not an independent cause of\n\naction. (See Levine v. Blue Shield of California (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1117, 1138\n\n[\" ' \"[T]here is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment\" ' \"], quoting Durell\n\nv. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1370 (Durell), and see Melchior v.\n\nNew Line Productions, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793 (Melchior).) He argues the\n\nevidence showed Uppal was acting on Soni's behalf, and that the predicate liability\n\nfinding is the jury finding as to Uppal's fraudulent sale of the business, which, along with\n\nFirst Nationwide Savings v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, provides the basis for the\n\ntrial court's finding that Soni had been improperly benefitted and unjustly enriched. And,\n\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\faccording to Hackbart, section 2224,11 relating to constructive trusts, sets out general\n\nprinciples that permitted the trial court to enter a restitutionary award against Soni in\n\nview of evidence that Soni knew of the businesses' precarious financial condition, acted\n\n\"in close concert\" with Uppal in the management and financing of the busineses, and\n\nurged Uppal to \" 'do the minimum necessary' to market and sell them on his behalf, as\n\nquickly as possible.\"\n\n       Unjust enrichment is \" ' \"a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines\n\nand remedies,\" ' rather than a remedy itself.\" (Melchior, supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at\n\np. 793.) It \"is a common law obligation implied by law based on the equities of a\n\nparticular case and not on any contractual obligation. [Citation.] Whether termed unjust\n\nenrichment, quasi-contract, or quantum meruit, the equitable remedy of restitution when\n\nunjust enrichment has occurred 'is an obligation (not a true contract [citation]) created by\n\nthe law without regard to the intention of the parties, and is designed to restore the\n\naggrieved party to his or her former position by return of the thing or its equivalent in\n\nmoney.' \" (F.D.I.C. v. Dintino (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 333, 346.) Unjust enrichment is\n\nsynonymous with restitution, and has been characterized as describing the result of a\n\nfailure to make restitution. (Durell, supra, 183 Cal.App.4th at p. 1370; McBride v.\n\nBoughton (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 387.)\n\n\n\n\n11      Section 2224 provides: \"One who gains a thing by fraud, accident, mistake, undue\ninfluence, the violation of a trust, or other wrongful act, is, unless he has some other and\nbetter right thereto, an involuntary trustee of the thing gained, for the benefit of the\nperson who would otherwise have had it.\"\n                                             35\n\f       Likewise, restitution is itself not a cause of action, but a remedy. (Munoz v .\n\nMacMillan (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 648, 661; Nakash v. Sup. Ct. (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d\n\n59, 70.) \" 'There are several potential bases for a cause of action seeking restitution. For\n\nexample, restitution may be awarded in lieu of breach of contract damages when the\n\nparties had an express contract, but it was procured by fraud or is unenforceable or\n\nineffective for some reason. [Citations.] Alternatively, restitution may be awarded\n\nwhere the defendant obtained a benefit from the plaintiff by fraud, duress, conversion, or\n\nsimilar conduct. In such cases, the plaintiff may choose not to sue in tort, but instead to\n\nseek restitution on a quasi-contract theory. . . . [Citations.] In such cases, where\n\nappropriate, the law will imply a contract (or rather, a quasi-contract), without regard to\n\nthe parties' intent, in order to avoid unjust enrichment.' [¶] 'Under the law of restitution,\n\n\"[a]n individual is required to make restitution if he or she is unjustly enriched at the\n\nexpense of another. [Citations.] A person is enriched if the person receives a benefit at\n\nanother's expense. [Citation.]\" [Citation.] However, \"[t]he fact that one person benefits\n\nanother is not, by itself, sufficient to require restitution. The person receiving the benefit\n\nis required to make restitution only if the circumstances are such that, as between the two\n\nindividuals, it is unjust for the person to retain it.\" ' \" (Durell, supra, 183 Cal.App.4th at\n\np. 1371, quoting McBride v. Boughton, supra, 123 Cal.App.4th at pp. 388-389.)12\n\n\n\n\n12      We note too that \"[a] party seeking restitution 'must generally return any benefit'\nthat it has received.\" (California Federal Bank v. Matreyek (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 125,\n134, quoting Rest.2d, Contracts, § 376, com. a, § 384, com. a.)\n                                              36\n\f       Similarly, a constructive trust is an equitable remedy, not a substantive claim for\n\nrelief. (PCO, Inc. v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro, LLP\n\n(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 384, 398.) It \" 'is an involuntary equitable trust created by\n\noperation of law as a remedy to compel the transfer of property from the person\n\nwrongfully holding it to the rightful owner. [Citations.] The essence of the theory of\n\nconstructive trust is to prevent unjust enrichment and to prevent a person from taking\n\nadvantage of his or her own wrongdoing. [Citations.]' [Citations.] Before a constructive\n\ntrust can be imposed, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's acquisition of the\n\nproperty was wrongful.\" (Ibid.) A constructive trust may be imposed where the\n\nfollowing three conditions are satisfied: \" '(1) the existence of a res (property or some\n\ninterest in property); (2) the right of a complaining party to that res; and (3) some\n\nwrongful acquisition or detention of the res by another party who is not entitled to it.' \"\n\n(Campbell v. Superior Court (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 904, 920.)\n\n       Here, Hackbart elected not to rescind the purchase agreement; as stated, he\n\ndismissed his rescission cause of action. Instead, he proceeded in tort on various fraud\n\ntheories that permitted him to recover a tort measure of damages. Hackbart's operative\n\ncomplaint seeking unjust enrichment or restitution is based on allegations that Soni had\n\ndefrauded him. The nonsuit on those fraud causes of action, which Hackbart does not\n\nchallenge on appeal, constituted a judgment in Soni's favor on the merits (Code Civ.\n\nProc., § 581c, subd. (c); Fisch & Co. v. Superior Court (1935) 6 Cal.App.2d 21, 23), and\n\nSoni ceased to be a party to the action as to those causes of action. There is no indication\n\nthat Hackbart preserved his request for unjust enrichment against Soni by way of quasi-\n\n                                             37\n\fcontract cause of action or a common count to recover money or benefits obtained by\n\nfraud or other wrongdoing. (See, e.g., F.D.I.C. v. Dintino, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at pp.\n\n347-348 [holding three-year statute of limitations applies to unjust enrichment action \"in\n\nthe form of a common count to recover money or other benefit obtained by mistake\"].)\n\n       We reject the proposition that, following the judgment of nonsuit on the sole\n\ncauses of action asserted against him, any equitable obligation on Soni's part to return his\n\nshare of the sales proceeds could somehow be found based on the jury's finding of\n\nUppal's fraud. When it entered a nonsuit against Soni, the trial court necessarily found\n\nno evidence to support a finding that Soni committed or participated in Uppal's fraudulent\n\nrepresentations or concealments under any theory, even assuming the truth of all the facts\n\nproved by Hackbart. (Alpert v. Villa Romano Homeowners Assn. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th\n\n1320, 1328.) No trier of fact found that Soni was liable for any wrongdoing, either as a\n\nprincipal or agent.\n\n       Hackbart's reliance on First Nationwide Savings v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th\n\n1657 does not assist him. In that case, involving a demurrer, the court held that \"a\n\ntransferee with knowledge of the circumstances giving rise to an unjust enrichment claim\n\nmay be obligated to make restitution. For example, 'A person who has entered into a\n\ntransaction with another under such circumstances that, because of a mistake, he would\n\nbe entitled to restitution from the other, . . . [¶] . . . is entitled to restitution from a third\n\nperson who had notice of the circumstances before giving value or before receiving title\n\nor a legal interest in the subject matter.' \" (Id. at p. 1663, italics omitted.) In First\n\nNationwide, the defendant against whom restitution was sought was the nonassuming\n\n                                                38\n\fgrantee of a purchase money deed of trust who sold property after a mistaken\n\nreconveyance by a trustee sued by the plaintiff beneficiary in the form of claims for\n\n\"unjust enrichment\" and money had and received. (Id. at p. 1660.) The Court of Appeal\n\nheld the plaintiff should be permitted leave to amend to allege the defendant's knowledge\n\nof the trustee's mistaken reconveyance, and with such allegations could maintain a claim\n\nfor unjust enrichment. (Id. at pp. 1669-1670.) Unlike Perry, there were no viable causes\n\nof action remaining against Soni. And, to the extent Perry can be read as recognizing a\n\nstand-alone cause of action for unjust enrichment, we decline to follow it.\n\n       Without a finding that Soni committed fraud or some other wrongdoing that would\n\nrender it unjust for him to retain his benefit, it was not proper to enter a restitutionary\n\naward against him on the basis of theories of unjust enrichment or constructive trust.\n\n(Accord, Borton v. Joslin (1928) 88 Cal.App. 515, 522 [no constructive trust created\n\nwhere there is no evidence of facts (proof of fraud, accident, mistake, undue influence or\n\nany other wrongful act) that would justify a conclusion that a trust was created by\n\noperation of law].) We reverse the restitution award against Soni.\n\n                                IV. Hackbart's Cross-Appeal\n\nA. Adequacy of Restitution Award\n\n       Hackbart contends the trial court abused its discretion in its restitution award\n\nagainst Soni; that Soni received an actual benefit beyond the $232,000 in net cash\n\nproceeds from the sale of the business. According to Hackbart, the trial court should\n\nhave calculated the restitutionary award as $560,000 based on Soni's 40 percent\n\nproportionate share of the $1,400,000 gross out-of-pocket damages awarded.\n\n                                              39\n\f       We have already reversed the restitution award against Soni as unsupported by an\n\nappropriate finding of wrongdoing sufficient to render it unjust for him to retain the sales\n\nproceeds. But Hackbart's contention is unavailing for another reason, namely, there is no\n\nindication in the record that Hackbart moved for a new trial on the ground of inadequate\n\ndamages. \"[F]ailure to timely move for a new trial ordinarily precludes a party from\n\ncomplaining on appeal that the damages awarded were either excessive or inadequate,\n\nwhether the case was tried by a jury or by the court.\" (Jamison v. Jamison (2008) 164\n\nCal.App.4th 714, 719.)\n\nB. Alter Ego Liability\n\n       In its statement of decision, the trial court declined to impose alter ego liability on\n\neither Soni or Bhavna. Emphasizing the doctrine was limited and invoked only \"where\n\nrecognition of the corporate form would work an injustice to a third person,\" it ruled the\n\nevidence did not support its application, reasoning: \"Mr. Hackbart entered into the\n\ncontract with MTPA knowing it to be a corporation. He received and continues to\n\npossess all of MTPA's known assets, and he had no reason to believe that he could rely\n\non the financial responsibility of the individual shareholders.\" In a footnote, the court\n\nadded: \"Mr. Hackbart acknowledged that he did not rely on either Mrs. Uppal or\n\nMr. Soni's representations in determining to enter into Exhibit [No.] 186.\"] It continued:\n\n\"The individual conduct of Mr. Uppal and not the existence and/or continued\n\nmaintenance of the corporate entity is the source of any injustice suffered by\n\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\fMr. Hackbart. Mr. Uppal is not the subject of this analysis as the record is clear that he\n\nwas not a shareholder of MTPA.\"13\n\n       Hackbart contends the trial court committed an error of law by refusing to impose\n\nalter ego liability against Soni. Pointing to its focus on Hackbart's knowledge of MTPA's\n\ncorporate status and the reasonableness of looking to the individual shareholders'\n\nfinancial responsibility, he maintains the court applied improper legal criteria,\n\nparticularly in view of the evidence that MTPA was defunct as well as the court's\n\nfindings that Uppal acted at all times on the corporation's behalf, Soni had substantial\n\nparticipation in the business's operations and financing, and Soni was aware Uppal had\n\novervalued it for purposes of the sale. Hackbart argues this error \"led [the court] astray,\n\nallowing a shareholder who both actively encouraged and benefitted from a fraud\n\nperpetrated on his behalf to misuse the corporate form to escape individual liability.\"\n\n       1. Standard of Review\n\n       Hackbart's challenge to the court's alter ego analysis and his claim the court did\n\nnot apply correct legal criteria is assessed independently. (Enrique M. v. Angelina V.\n\n(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1371, 1378.) Even though our review is de novo, we\n\nnevertheless presume the judgment is correct and indulge all intendments and\n\npresumptions to support the ruling on matters as to which the record is silent. (Denham\n\nv. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564.) And, \"[t]he doctrine of implied findings\n\nrequires the appellate court to infer the trial court made all factual findings necessary to\n\n\n13    Hackbart did not challenge the court's alter ego findings in his objections to its\nstatement of decision.\n                                              41\n\fsupport the judgment.\" (Fladeboe v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2007) 150\n\nCal.App.4th 42, 58.) Hackbart's burden on appeal is not only to affirmatively\n\ndemonstrate error on an adequate record (Bianco v. California Highway Patrol (1994) 24\n\nCal.App.4th 1113, 1125), but to show that the error caused a miscarriage of justice.\n\n(Vaughn v. Jonas (1948) 31 Cal.2d 586, 601; In re Marriage of Dellaria (2009) 172\n\nCal.App.4th 196, 204-205; Cal. Const., art. VI, § 13.) We will not presume prejudice\n\nfrom an error.\n\n       2. Alter Ego Principles\n\n       \" '[A]lthough a corporation is usually regarded as an entity separate and distinct\n\nfrom its stockholders, both law and equity will, when necessary to circumvent fraud,\n\nprotect the rights of third persons and accomplish justice, disregard this distinct existence\n\nand treat them as identical.' The issue is not so much whether, for all purposes, the\n\ncorporation is the 'alter ego' of its stockholders or officers, nor whether the very purpose\n\nof the organization of the corporation was to defraud the individual who is now in court\n\ncomplaining, as it is an issue of whether in the particular case presented and for the\n\npurposes of such case justice and equity can best be accomplished and fraud and\n\nunfairness defeated by a disregard of the distinct entity of the corporate form.' \" (Kohn v.\n\nKohn (1950) 95 Cal.App.2d 708, 718; see Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39\n\nCal.3d 290, 300-301.) The doctrine is not itself a claim for substantive relief as a claim\n\nfor breach of contract, rather, it is a procedural device by which courts disregard the\n\ncorporate entity in order to hold the alter ego individual liable on the corporation's\n\nobligations. (Leek v. Cooper (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 399, 418-419.)\n\n                                             42\n\f       \"There is no litmus test to determine when the corporate veil will be pierced;\n\nrather the result will depend on the circumstances of each particular case. There are,\n\nnevertheless, two general requirements: '(1) that there be such unity of interest and\n\nownership that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual no longer\n\nexist and (2) that, if the acts are treated as those of the corporation alone, an inequitable\n\nresult will follow.' \" (Mesler v. Bragg Management Co., supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 300.)\n\n\"The essence of the . . . doctrine is that justice be done. 'What the formula comes down\n\nto, once shorn of verbiage about control, instrumentality, agency, and corporate entity, is\n\nthat liability is imposed to reach an equitable result.' [Citation.] Thus the corporate form\n\nwill be disregarded only in narrowly defined circumstances and only when the ends of\n\njustice so require.\" (Id. at p. 301; Greenspan v. LADT LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486,\n\n510-511.)\n\n       Because the alter ego doctrine is founded on equitable principles, a trial court must\n\nconsider the totality of the circumstances and has broad latitude in determining whether\n\nthe factual circumstances support the application of the doctrine. (See Troyk v. Farmers\n\nGroup, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1341-1342.) \" ' \"[T]he conditions under which\n\na corporate entity may be disregarded vary according to the circumstances of each\n\ncase.\" ' [Citations.] Whether the evidence has established that the corporate veil should\n\nbe ignored is primarily a question of fact which should not be disturbed when supported\n\nby substantial evidence.\" (Las Palmas Associates v. Las Palmas Center Associates\n\n(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1220, 1248.) No single factor is determinative. (Leek v. Cooper,\n\n\n\n                                              43\n\fsupra, 194 Cal.App.4th at p. 418; Zoran Corp. v. Chen (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 799, 812;\n\nTroyk, at p. 1342.)14\n\n       3. Analysis\n\n       The trial court began its alter ego analysis by quoting from Mesler v. Bragg\n\nManagement Co., supra, 39 Cal.3d 290 for the proposition that \" 'the essence of the alter\n\nego doctrine is that justice be done . . . [and] that liability is imposed to reach an equitable\n\nresult.' \" It cited to the appellate court's statement in Webber v. Inland Empire\n\nInvestments, Inc. (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 884 that the doctrine is limited and only invoked\n\n\" 'where recognition of the corporate form would work an injustice to a third person.' \"\n\n       Given these comments, it is evident the trial court rightly focused on the justice or\n\ninjustice flowing from recognition of MTPA's corporate form. Importantly, Soni\n\nobtained a nonsuit on Hackbart's fraud claims; indeed as part of its alter ego analysis the\n\ntrial court found Hackbart did not rely on any of Soni's statements in entering into the\n\n\n\n14      Because the doctrine is equitable, its application \" ' \"is not made to depend upon\nprior decisions involving factual situations which appear to be similar . . . .\" ' \"\n(Greenspan v. LADT, LLC, supra, 191 Cal.App.4th at p. 512.) Factors relevant to this\nanalysis include \"the disregard of legal formalities and the failure to maintain arm's\nlength relationships among related entities,\" \"the failure to maintain minutes or adequate\ncorporate records,\" \"the confusion of the records of the separate entities,\" the \"failure to\nsegregate funds of the separate entities,\" \"[c]ommingling of funds and other assets,\" \"the\ntotal absence of corporate assets and undercapitalization,\" the failure \"to issue stock,\"\n\"sole ownership of all of the stock in a corporation by one individual or the members of a\nfamily,\" overlapping officers and directors, \"the use of the same office or business\nlocation,\" \"the employment of the same employees and/or attorney,\" \"the unauthorized\ndiversion of corporate funds or assets to other than corporate uses,\" \"the use of a\ncorporation as a mere shell, instrumentality or conduit,\" and \"the diversion of assets from\na corporation by or to a stockholder.\" (Associated Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co.\n(1962) 210 Cal.App.2d 825, 838-840.)\n                                              44\n\ftransaction. This precluded a finding that Soni intended to defraud Hackbart or used the\n\ncorporate entity to perpetrate a fraud. Though the trial court did not make express\n\nfindings on all of the factors recited above (fn. 13, ante) it had wide latitude (see Troyk v.\n\nFarmers Group, Inc., supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1341-1342) to assess all of the\n\nfactual circumstances, not only those factors delineated by courts. As we have stated, the\n\ninquiry is fact-intenstive, and there is no single litmus test. (Mesler v. Bragg\n\nManagement Co., supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 300.) We cannot say, based on the trial court's\n\ncitation to relevant authorities and its focus on facts bearing on the equities of\n\ndisregarding the corporate existence, it used erroneous legal standards in reaching its\n\nconclusion. At bottom, the doctrine \"is an extreme remedy, sparingly used\" (Sonora\n\nDiamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 539) and \"sound public\n\npolicy dictates that imposition of alter ego liability be approached with caution.\" (Las\n\nPalmas Associates v. Las Palmas Center Associates, supra, 235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1249.)\n\nThe doctrine \"does not guard every unsatisfied creditor of a corporation but instead\n\naffords protection where some conduct amounting to bad faith makes it inequitable for\n\nthe corporate owner to hide behind the corporate form. Difficulty in enforcing a\n\njudgment or collecting a debt does not satisfy this standard.\" (Sonora Diamond Corp., at\n\np. 539.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              45\n\f       Hackbart criticizes the court for failing to recognize evidence that Soni admitted\n\nno shares of MTPA were distributed, MTPA never held shareholder or director meetings,\n\nand Uppal and Soni abided by few corporate formalities. Mere failure to follow\n\ncorporate formalities without inequity will not support application of the doctrine,\n\nhowever. Failure to issue stock is relevant, but not conclusive. (Automotriz Del Golfo\n\nDe California S.A. de C.V. v. Resnick (1957) 47 Cal.2d 792, 796.) And, there was trial\n\nevidence that there was not a unity of interest (Uppal's and Soni's 60/40 ownership).\n\nHackbart also argues his knowledge of MTPA's corporate status is not a reason to deny\n\nalter ego liability where \"assets that purportedly belonged to a corporation remained in\n\nthe name of individual shareholders while the corporation was in operation, and any\n\nassets actually held by the corporation were immediately stripped-out when the sale to\n\nHackbart was complete, with no formal wind-out of the corporate entity after its sale.\"\n\nHackbart provides no record citation that such evidence was presented in this case, and\n\nthe trial court found otherwise, stating Hackbart \"received and continues to possess all of\n\nMTPA's known assets . . . .\" In any event, Hackbart does not challenge the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence of the court's findings, and we conclude there is no reason to disturb its\n\nruling on Hackbart's claim of legal error.\n\n\n\n\n                                             46\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n\n       That portion of the judgment awarding David Hackbart and Kihack Management,\n\nLLC $232,000 in restitution against Suresh K. Soni is reversed, as is the jury's $700,000\n\npunitive damages award against Satinder M. Uppal.

The trial court entered a judgment awarding\n\nHackbart $1,400,000 in fraud damages and $700,000 in punitive damages against Uppal,\n\nand $232,000 against Soni in the amount it found Soni had been unjustly enriched. It\n\nawarded $1,400,000 in breach of contract and fraud damages against suspended\n\ncorporation MTPA Ventures Limited, Inc. (MTPA), against which it had previously\n\nentered a default judgment. The court declined to hold any of the individual defendants\n\nliable for the acts of MTPA as alter egos.\n\n       Uppal contends: (1) there is no evidence to support the jury's finding that\n\nHackbart justifiably relied on any statement or concealment of fact; and (2) the court\n\nerred by permitting the jury to calculate fraud damages in a manner contrary to the Civil\n\nCode1 section 3343 out-of-pocket measure. Soni joins these arguments from Uppal's\n\nappellant's brief. Uppal separately contends the jury's punitive damage award is\n\nunsupported by a finding of actual damage, excessive and contrary to law. Soni\n\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Civil Code.\n\n                                             2\n\fseparately contends the trial court erred by finding he was unjustly enriched because\n\nHackbart had no legal basis on which to premise a claim for unjust enrichment, and even\n\nif there were such a basis, Hackbart failed to proffer evidence of the businesses' value at\n\nthe date of sale.\n\n        Hackbart cross-appeals, contending the restitutionary award against Soni was\n\nimproperly limited to the net cash proceeds Soni received, and should be increased to\n\n$560,000, which reflects Soni's proportionate share of the gross out-of-pocket damages\n\nawarded to Hackbart. Hackbart further contends the trial court erred by denying alter ego\n\nliability against Soni.\n\n       We conclude that to the extent the trial court erred by submitting the wrong\n\nmeasure of fraud damages to the jury or the jury calculated fraud damages in a manner\n\ncontrary to section 3343, the error was invited by Uppal's submission of the fraud\n\ndamages jury instruction. We reverse the restitution award against Soni as unsupported\n\nby an independent basis for liability, as well as the punitive damages award against Uppal\n\nas without support by meaningful evidence of his ability to pay. We reject the remaining\n\ncontentions and otherwise affirm the judgment.\n\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       In 2001, Uppal, a certified public accountant (CPA) with undergraduate and\n\nmaster's degrees from University of Southern California in business administration and\n\nbusiness taxation, purchased out of bankruptcy a Chevron gasoline station and related\n\nbusinesses located at 350 Encinitas Boulevard. The purchase price was $1.1 million.\n\nUppal signed the purchase agreement and promissory note, as well as the security\n\n                                             3\n\fagreement and a sublease. During the previous 13 years, he had invested in 12 to 15\n\nautomotive-related franchises and desired to get out of that business. At some point, he\n\nand Soni agreed to be financial partners in the transaction, and they formed and\n\nincorporated MTPA in September 2001, shortly before the purchase. Uppal and his wife\n\nBhavna Uppal owned a 60 percent interest in MTPA, and Soni owned a 40 percent\n\ninterest. Despite MTPA's creation, Uppal never attempted to assign to MTPA any assets\n\nor rights to the business he had individually acquired, assertedly because the bankruptcy\n\ncourt would not permit it. Soni accepted that all of the assets were in Uppal's name.2\n\n       MTPA never held any formal shareholder or board of director meetings. MTPA\n\ndid, however, obtain a seller's permit from the state Board of Equalization in order to\n\ncollect sales tax, and Uppal was responsible for doing the monthly reporting of sales and\n\nuse taxes due. From January 2004 to August 2004, Uppal understated transactions at the\n\nChevron station subject to gasoline sales taxes so he could save money, even though he\n\nknew doing so was dishonest.\n\n\n\n\n2      For clarity and not out of disrespect, we refer to Satinder Uppal as Uppal, and his\nwife Bhavna Uppal as Bhavna. Uppal listed his wife Bhavna as the president, secretary\nand treasurer of MTPA, and she and Soni were its sole directors. MTPA was\nincorporated as a domestic stock corporation on or about September 14, 2001. Its\ncorporate filings identified all of its officers as Bhavna Uppal in her maiden name. Uppal\nsigned his wife's name with her authorization on various documents, including the\nChevron station's state, local and district sales and use tax returns from January 2004\nthrough August 2004.\n\n                                             4\n\f       At some point in 2004, Uppal shared with Soni a monthly \"break-even\" analysis of\n\nthe station's profits and losses from 2003 that showed losses for 11 of the 12 months of\n\nthat year, a net loss of over $91,000.3 The men exchanged e-mails and discussed\n\nwhether it made sense to put more money into the business given that analysis. Soni told\n\nUppal that his numbers did not make sense to him, and he asked him to come up with a\n\n\"clean set of numbers\"; that they would discuss the sale \"once we clean the books.\" The\n\nmen decided they would sell the business and started marketing it by the spring of 2004.\n\n       In October 2004, Hackbart, a car wash owner with a college degree in accounting,\n\ncalled Uppal in response to an advertisement about the Chevron station. Uppal informed\n\nHackbart of the nature of the business including the volume of gas pumped per month\n\nand the profit per gallon, and the revenues from both the car wash and convenience store.\n\nUppal told him the average income from January 2004 to August 2004 was $33,000 to\n\n$34,000. A few days later, Hackbart made an e-mail offer to Uppal of $1.8 million for\n\nthe business, contingent on an inspection of its books and records. Uppal countered with\n\na higher offer that would permit Hackbart to inspect the books and records within the\n\nnext three days. They finally settled on a purchase price of $1.875 million for the\n\nChevron gas station, car wash, convenience store, automobile repair center and the rights\n\nto a sandwich franchise.\n\n\n3       The statement reported a $9,000 loss in January 2003 and other losses of $10,000\nor more for other months. The only positive month was July 2003, which showed a $31\nprofit. According to MTPA's income statement, the business had a $61,000 loss in the\nfirst six weeks of opening, $7,000 net income in 2002, and $46,000 net income in 2003.\nThe latter income statement was inconsistent with the break-even analysis reviewed by\nUppal and Soni, but neither Uppal nor Soni gave the break-even analysis to Hackbart.\n                                             5\n\f      In late October 2004, Uppal, Hackbart and other potential investors with Hackbart\n\nmet at a nearby restaurant and Hackbart was shown profit and loss statements as well as\n\n\"Excel\" spreadsheets for eight months ending in 2004, showing a net operating income of\n\nabout $33,000 to $34,000 per month. Uppal also showed Hackbart tax statements from\n\n2003 showing ordinary income of $46,632. Uppal did not show Hackbart the 2003\n\nbreak-even analysis showing $91,000 in losses. Uppal explained to Hackbart how the net\n\noperating income had continued to grow from the time Uppal had taken the business out\n\nof bankruptcy. That day, Uppal permitted Hackbart to take the profit and loss statement\n\nand spreadsheets, and though Hackbart was still interested in going forward, he sought\n\nmore documentation. Later, in response to Hackbart's e-mail request, Uppal additionally\n\nprovided, among other documents, an August 2004 invoice showing gas purchases.\n\nHackbart continued to ask Uppal for additional documents including financial statements\n\nhe had been shown but was not permitted to take as well as bank statements; Uppal told\n\nhim they were in numerous boxes with his CPA due to a recent move. In another\n\ntelephone call, Hackbart asked Uppal to break down the sales components of each part of\n\nthe business in detail, and Uppal did so over the phone while Hackbart took detailed\n\nnotes concerning the net revenues for an eight-month period ending August 31, 2004.\n\nHackbart did not see anything surprising in Uppal's numbers, and based on all of Uppal's\n\nstatements, he became convinced they were the actual numbers for the business. The\n\nnext day, while Hackbart and Uppal negotiated the purchase price and terms, Hackbart\n\nagain asked for documents to back up the numbers, but Uppal reiterated that they were\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fnot available. Uppal urged Hackbart to waive the contingency provision on reviewing\n\nbooks and records, and Hackbart did so.\n\n       In November 2004, Hackbart signed a purchase and asset sale agreement (the\n\npurchase agreement) with MTPA. He agreed to pay $1,875,000 for the gas station, car\n\nwash, convenience store, related office space, and the rights to the sandwich franchise in\n\nthe form of $1,075,000 in cash and Hackbart's assumption of an existing $800,000\n\npromissory note against the business. In the purchase agreement, Hackbart\n\nacknowledged he had \"reviewed the books and records prepared by Seller of Chevron in\n\nEncinitas,\" was \"satisfied with those records and hereby removes the contingency in\n\nparagraph 3 of the purchase and sales agreement . . . .\" When Hackbart received the\n\nescrow instructions, however, he took the time to alter or strike out several paragraphs in\n\nthem. First, because he had not received all of the books and records that he had\n\nrequested and had primarily relied on Uppal's representations as to the business's\n\nfinancial statements and revenues, he struck out and initialed a sentence stating he had\n\nnot relied upon seller representations but had conducted his own investigation. He also\n\nstruck out a paragraph entitled \"Purchase Agreement Governs,\" which indicated in part\n\nthat the parties had agreed the escrow instructions \"supersede and void\" any prior\n\nagreements. Hackbart felt that Uppal had in fact made representations to him.\n\n       In May 2005, Hackbart signed final escrow instructions containing a statement\n\nthat the parties agreed \"all warranties and representations of the parties shall survive the\n\nclosing of this escrow.\" The statement was important to Hackbart because his\n\nunderstanding of the businesses' numbers came from Uppal and he did not have the back-\n\n                                              7\n\fup documents he had asked for. During the entire transaction, Uppal did not tell\n\nHackbart about the underreporting of sales tax or that Uppal had underestimated the\n\nbusinesses' expenses, was behind on lease payments, had to borrow on personal credit\n\ncards to fund business expenses, or that the business required loans to meet expenses.\n\nSoni never told Hackbart that he suspected the books were inaccurate or otherwise tried\n\nto share any information concerning what he knew about the business. Escrow closed on\n\nor about May 3, 2005.\n\n       After Hackbart took over the businesses, he observed he was losing money;\n\nexpenses were much higher than expected. When he figured the profits and losses for the\n\nfirst 10 to 11 months of operation, he calculated a net loss of almost $24,000. In order to\n\nrun the businesses, Hackbart had to slash expenses, and had his wife work there five or\n\nsix days a week without pay. In the first few months, he paid sales taxes from his\n\npersonal funds. Hackbart eventually retained Brian Bergmark, a forensic accountant and\n\nCPA who had previously valued gas stations for various estate and litigation matters, to\n\nconduct an analysis of the businesses' financial performance.\n\n       In December 2006, Hackbart sued MTPA, Uppal, Bhavna, and Soni for rescission\n\nand restitution, fraud, breach of contract, \"unjust enrichment,\" an accounting and\n\nimposition of a constructive trust. He later filed a first amended complaint, which\n\ndefendants answered, generally denying the allegations and asserting various affirmative\n\ndefenses.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f       The case proceeded to a bifurcated jury trial on Hackbart's claims for intentional\n\nand negligent misrepresentation as well as fraud by concealment. MTPA had not\n\nappeared and, before trial, the trial court entered its default, striking its answer and\n\noperative cross-complaint. The trial court and Hackbart's counsel characterized the\n\nproceeding as to MTPA as a \"prove-up on damages.\" Hackbart dismissed without\n\nprejudice his first cause of action.4\n\n       At trial, Hackbart's expert, Bergmark, opined that Hackbart had suffered economic\n\ndamages in connection with his purchase of the businesses. He derived these damages by\n\ncalculating an \"indicated value\" using an adjusted earnings (earnings before interest)\n\nanalysis, and applying the multiple that Hackbart was willing to pay (based on the\n\n$1,875,000 purchase price relative to the earnings reported by Uppal), under two\n\ndifferent scenarios. In reaching his conclusions, Bergmark annualized Uppal's\n\nunderreported sales tax, explaining he considered these numbers because if business\n\nearnings were overstated, a person would overpay for what he or she received.\n\nAccording to Bergmark, accounting for Uppal's underpaid sales tax, Hackbart overpaid\n\n\n\n\n4       Before trial, Hackbart's counsel stated: \"We have and will be dismissing the first\ncause of action for rescission. We have sent someone downstairs to file that one\ndismissal, that one cause of action\" The court clerk responded that it had been done, and\nthe trial court acknowledged the cause of action was not reflected in the verdict form.\nHackbart's counsel reiterated that the \"first cause of action for rescission is being\ndismissed without prejudice.\" Hackbart later claimed, and the trial court agreed, he did\nnot dismiss his claim for restitution.\n                                               9\n\f$961,880 for the businesses; additionally factoring in concerns that Uppal had\n\nunderstated other expenses such as payroll, Hackbart overpaid by $1,408,571.5\n\nHackbart's counsel had earlier disclaimed any right to expenses or other consequential\n\ndamages, including lost profits, occurring after the sale.6\n\n       Uppal presented his own expert, Ann Wilson, who criticized Bergmark's valuation\n\napproaches, including his calculation of net operating income. Using Bergmark's\n\nnumbers as to Uppal's underpaid sales tax, Wilson obtained an adjusted net operating\n\nincome figure of $243,090 and applied various multiples to conclude that as of May 2,\n\n2005, the businesses were worth between $1,580,085 and $2,187,810. Wilson also\n\nlooked at a valuation based on the businesses' income stream, reaching a valuation of\n\n$2,131,972. According to Wilson, the best evidence of fair market value (the price a\n\nwilling buyer and seller would pay in an open market) was what actual price was paid,\n\n\n\n5      To get these numbers, Bergmark annualized existing information from January\n2004 to August 2004 and took out the interest component to reach a net income number\nof $306,680. He divided the $306,680 into Hackbart's $1,875,000 purchase price to\nreach a multiple of 6.11, which was what Hackbart was willing to pay as a multiple of\nearnings. Bergmark then factored in the $157,328 that Uppal had underreported in sales\ntaxes to ascertain the businesses' year-end earnings had the sales tax been included, and\nmade the same calculations using the same 6.11 multiplier, to reach an indicated value of\n$913,120. He further adjusted the same numbers by $73,062 to reflect a 17 percent gross\nprofit margin, which Bergmark estimated to be historically correct, and used the same\n6.11 multiplier to get an indicated value of $466,429. From the latter calculation,\nBergmark opined that Hackbart had overpaid $1,408,571 for the businesses ($1,875,000\nminus $466,429). The jury awarded Hackbart $1,400,000 in fraud damages.\n\n6       Section 3343 allows recovery of not only out-of-pocket losses but also \"additional\ndamage\" in the form of expenses or other consequential injury, including lost profits,\nresulting from the fraud. (§ 3343, subds. (1)-(4); Bagdasarian v. Gragnon (1948) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2608197\"><a href=\"/opinion/2608197/bagdasarian-v-gragnon/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 762-763.)\n                                             10\n\fand Bergmark's numbers did not pass a \"reality check\" given Uppal had purchased the\n\nshuttered businesses for $1.1 million in 2001 with bankruptcy court approval.\n\n       Following the presentation of evidence, Bhanva and Soni successfully moved for a\n\nnonsuit on Hackbart's fraud causes of action. With the parties' agreement, the court\n\nthereafter instructed the jury on fraud damages as follows: \"If you decide that the\n\n[plaintiffs] have proved their fraud claims—and that's what they are—against the\n\ndefendant, you must also decide how much money would reasonably compensate the\n\nplaintiffs for the harm. This is called damages. [¶] The amount of damages must\n\ninclude an award for each item of harm that was caused by defendant's wrongful conduct,\n\neven if the particular harm could not have been anticipated. [¶] Plaintiffs do not have to\n\nprove the exact amount of damages that will provide reasonable compensation for the\n\nharm. However, you must not speculate or guess in awarding damages. [¶] The\n\nfollowing are the specific items of damages claimed by the plaintiffs: [¶] One,\n\noverpayment for the business—or businesses; [¶] and prejudgment interest.\"7\n\n\n\n\n7      The trial court did not give CACI No. 1923 regarding out-of-pocket damages,\nwhich would have instructed the jury as to the measure of damages as follows: \"To\ndecide the amount of damages you must determine the [fair market] value of what [name\nof plaintiff] gave and subtract from that amount the [fair market] value of what [he/she/it]\nreceived. [¶] ['Fair market value' is the highest price that a willing buyer would have\npaid on the date of the transaction to a willing seller, assuming: [¶] 1. That there is no\npressure on either one to buy or sell; and [¶] 2. That the buyer and seller know all the\nuses and purposes for which the [insert item] is reasonably capable of being used.]\"\n(CACI No. 1923.) Uppal and Soni explain in their supplemental briefing that they did\nnot request this instruction because they had stipulated that Hackbart would not be\nseeking damages other than out-of-pocket damages permitted under section 3343, i.e.,\nmoneys spent in reliance on fraud or lost profits. (See fn. 6, ante.)\n                                             11\n\f       The jury returned special verdicts in Hackbart's favor against Uppal, awarding\n\nHackbart $1,400,000 in fraud damages, and, after considering additional evidence as to\n\nUppal's finances, $700,000 in punitive damages.\n\n       The trial court then conducted a bench trial on Hackbart's claims for damages\n\nagainst MTPA, as well as his request for a finding of alter ego liability and remaining\n\nequitable cause of action against Uppal, Bhavna and Soni styled \"unjust enrichment.\" It\n\nissued a proposed statement of decision, to which Hackbart and Soni objected and/or\n\nsought clarification. In its final statement of decision, the court (1) entered a default\n\njudgment against MTPA in the amount of $1,400,000; (2) found the evidence did not\n\nsupport a conclusion that recognition of the corporate form would work an injustice to\n\nHackbart; and (3) found both Uppal and Soni were unjustly enriched: Uppal in the\n\namount of the $155,000 bonus he had received at the close of the sale, and Soni in the\n\namount of the $232,000 distribution he received at the close of sale. The court found the\n\naward against Uppal duplicative of the jury's fraud damage award, and required Hackbart\n\nto make an election before entry of judgment. It declined to impose liability on Bhavna,\n\nfinding no evidence she participated in the business management or had awareness of its\n\noperations, but was merely a MTPA shareholder who relied upon her husband Uppal's\n\nconduct and direction. On the other hand, the court found Soni, a sophisticated\n\nbusinessman, was aware the business was being sold for more than it was worth and\n\nknew Hackbart was shown books and records that he considered to be unreliable,\n\nwarranting a conclusion that it was unjust for Soni to realize the $232,000 return on his\n\ninvestment in MTPA.\n\n                                              12\n\f       On March 2, 2011, the court entered judgment in Hackbart's favor awarding\n\n$1,400,000 fraud and breach of contract damages against MTPA; $1,400,000 in fraud\n\ndamages and $700,000 in punitive damages against Uppal; and $232,000 in unjust\n\nenrichment damages against Soni.\n\n       Uppal moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and for a new\n\ntrial. He argued a new trial was warranted in part due to an error of law in that Hackbart\n\nhad failed to establish a proper measure of damages, and also for excessive damages\n\nresulting from Hackbart's failure to present evidence of the businesses' actual value on the\n\ndate of sale. He argued JNOV was proper for the latter failure of proof, as well as\n\ninsufficient evidence of Hackbart's reasonable reliance. On April 15, 2011, the trial court\n\ndenied both motions, as well as Soni's requests to join them. Thereafter, Uppal and Soni\n\nseparately appealed from the March 2, 2011 judgment; Uppal identifying that portion of\n\nthe judgment following the jury trial, and Soni identifying that portion of the judgment\n\nfollowing the bench trial. Hackbart appeals the March 2, 2011 judgment both as to the\n\njury and bench trials.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n                            I. Uppal's and Soni's Contentions\n\nA. The Evidence is Sufficient To Support the Jury's Findings of Justifiable Reliance on\n\nUppal's Fraud\n\n       Uppal and Soni contend that based on the trial evidence, the jury could not\n\nreasonably have concluded that Hackbart acted with justifiable reliance on anything\n\nUppal did or did not say concerning the Chevron station. They characterize Hackbart as\n\n                                            13\n\fa \"sophisticated buyer\" with experience in the car wash industry, and point out, among\n\nother facts, Hackbart was never satisfied with the financial documents he had sought\n\nfrom Uppal and could not conduct an independent analysis to confirm the businesses'\n\nfinancials, but went ahead in any event with the purchase. Uppal and Soni argue that\n\nunder the circumstances, the trial court should have granted Uppal's JNOV motion on this\n\nground.\n\n       We asked the parties to brief Uppal and Soni's failure to identify the trial court's\n\nApril 18, 2011 amended minute order denying JNOV in their notices of appeal. Having\n\nconsidered the supplemental briefing, we conclude neither preserved an appeal from that\n\nseparately appealable order.

Analysis\n\n       We conclude the record contains substantial evidence to support the jury's finding\n\nthat Hackbart reasonably relied on Uppal's misrepresentations and omissions. Contrary\n\nto Uppal's characterization of Hackbart as a sophisticated buyer, the evidence was that\n\nHackbart, who had never been licensed as a CPA nor completed a master's degree in\n\ntaxation, worked for approximately two years as an accountant, became a resort manager,\n\ninstalled cable television, worked as an administrator, and became an investment\n\ncounselor with Bank of America. He purchased one business, a car wash, in 1998, with a\n\npartner. As Uppal acknowledges, Hackbart had never before purchased a business\n\ninvolving a gas station. The evidence does not support Uppal's characterization of\n\nHackbart as a sophisticated purchaser of businesses.\n\n       The evidence shows Uppal, himself a CPA who had bought and sold multiple\n\nautomotive oil change franchises, misrepresented to Hackbart the state of the station's\n\nfinancials, and concealed not only the 2003 break-even analysis reflecting significant\n\nlosses, but also his underpayment of sales taxes. The jury found Uppal's\n\nmisrepresentations were intentional. And, Hackbart made reasonable efforts to ascertain\n\nmaterial financial information. During face-to-face meetings, Uppal showed Hackbart\n\nvarious profit and loss statements and spreadsheets with financial information, and\n\nHackbart later pursued and carefully compiled net revenue numbers from information\n\nthat Uppal broke down to him over the telephone. When Hackbart asked for more\n\ndetailed back-up documentation, Uppal responded with a plausible excuse, telling\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fHackbart the papers were out of his reach due to his CPA's recent move. Hackbart\n\nultimately accepted Uppal's assurances that the numbers he provided were correct.\n\n       Uppal and Soni suggest that Hackbart's reliance was unjustified because Uppal\n\nwas a stranger, and Hackbart should have conducted background checks, independently\n\nverified Uppal's profit and loss numbers, contacted a gas supplier, or hired consultants to\n\nassist him in evaluating the information provided by Uppal. However, \"the law is clear\n\nthat ' \" '[n]o rogue should enjoy his ill-gotten plunder for the simple reason that his victim\n\nis by chance a fool.' \" ' [Citation.] ' \" 'Negligence on the part of the plaintiff in failing to\n\ndiscover the falsity of a statement is no defense when the misrepresentation was\n\nintentional rather than negligent.'

The\n\nplaintiffs invested after being knowingly given false information by a supposed agent\n\n                                               18\n\fconcerning minimum net income based on past sales records, the nature and level of\n\nsupport they would receive, and information concerning the franchisor (id. at pp. 953-\n\n954, 957), but the performance was not as promised and the plaintiffs discovered that\n\nthey had no actual business relationship with the franchisor, contrary to representations\n\nmade to them. (Id. at pp. 953-954, 956.) The defendant argued the plaintiffs' reliance\n\nwas unreasonable because they were negligent in failing to ascertain the extent of the\n\nagent's true authority, and had made some independent investigation of the facts. (Id. at\n\np. 964.) The appellate court disagreed, pointing out the plaintiffs had no prior experience\n\nwith franchising or distributorships, the defendant held itself out as an expert consultant\n\nand provided materials that backed its statements, and plaintiff's suspicions were allayed\n\nby defendant's plausible assertions as to the franchisor's relationships.

Under these circumstances, the court concluded there was no bar to the plaintiffs'\n\nrecovery by the fact some of them may have relied to some extent on independent advice\n\nor checked the company's Better Business Bureau rating. (Id. at p. 966.)\n\n       As in Hartong, the fact Hackbart conducted some investigation before the close of\n\nescrow does not preclude a finding of justifiable reliance. An independent investigation\n\ndoes not preclude reliance on representations where the falsity of statements is not\n\napparent from an inspection, or the person making the representations has superior\n\nknowledge, or the party relying thereon is not competent to judge the facts without expert\n\nassistance.

Claim of Failure of Proof of Out-of-Pocket Measure of Damages\n\n       Uppal and Soni contend the trial court prejudicially abused its discretion by (1)\n\nallowing the jury to award damages contrary to the exclusive out-of-pocket measure of\n\ndamages set forth in section 3343 for fraud \"involving the 'purchase, sale or exchange of\n\nproperty'. . . .\" and (2) preventing Uppal from fully presenting his own expert testimony\n\non the businesses' actual value.8 They maintain Hackbart did not put on evidence of the\n\nactual value of the gas station and car wash on the date of purchase and that Hackbart's\n\nexpert Bergmark admitted as much when he testified that he based his damages\n\ncalculation on Hackbart's desired \"multiple of earnings.\" Uppal argues the failure of\n\nproof requires that judgment be entered in his favor on his JNOV motion. Soni argues\n\nthe failure of proof on damages means there is no evidence to support the trial court's\n\nfinding that Hackbart paid more for the businesses than what they were worth, and that he\n\n(Soni) was unjustly enriched.\n\n       Hackbart responds that the parties used the correct measure of damages at trial as\n\nevidenced in part by the jury instructions; that Uppal and Soni's challenge is merely to his\n\nexpert's methodology in calculating value, which is an issue of credibility that cannot be\n\n\n8       We reject the latter contention out of hand, because the record shows that while\nthe trial court initially sustained objections that would have limited Ann Wilson's opinion\ntestimony, counsel for Hackbart then withdrew his objections, telling counsel for Uppal\nto \"[a]sk [Wilson] whatever you want to ask.\" Though Uppal acknowledges counsel's\nwithdrawal of the objection, he maintains he was \"denied the opportunity to fully put on\nevidence of actual value for the gas station.\" Uppal does not, however, explain what\nadditional evidence Wilson would have presented. Further, to the extent Soni purports to\nchallenge the jury's fraud damage award as excessive, his failure to move for a new trial\non that point bars the claim on appeal. (Jamison v.

He points out it was the jury's task to weigh and evaluate the\n\nvarious expert approaches on how to best calculate the actual value of the gas station and\n\ncar wash (the value of what he received) so that it could be compared with what Hackbart\n\nactually paid.\n\n       1.

(Emphasis and some capitalization omitted.) The record\n\ndoes not contain any motions in limine as to Bergmark's testimony and the parties do not\n\npoint to any argument on Uppal or Soni's behalf to the court that it was somehow\n\npermitting the jury to award a legally incorrect measure of damage. Rather, the trial\n\ncourt instructed the jury in accordance with the parties' agreed-upon jury instruction,\n\nwhich unspecifically told the jury that Hackbart was entitled to damages in the form of\n\nhis overpayment for the businesses. Each party presented experts who used different\n\ntheories and methods to explain why Hackbart paid, or did not pay, more than what the\n\nbusinesses were worth. Even if this instruction \"subsumed\" the notion that the\n\nbusinesses' worth is to be determined by fair market value, as Uppal and Soni maintain, it\n\nwas so general, lacking clarity, and incomplete that Uppal and Soni by offering it acceded\n\nto the jury's calculation of damages by any method the experts proposed to establish the\n\n                                             26\n\famount of Hackbart's overpayment. We cannot say the requested instruction was an\n\nincorrect statement of the law, but it was certainly vague and incomplete. Thus, Uppal\n\nand Soni should have sought additional or clarifying instructions in order to preserve a\n\nclaim that the court erred by submitting an erroneous measure of damages to the jury or\n\npermitting the jury to reach an erroneous measure.

Nor will we disturb the jury's compensatory\n\nfraud damages verdict, which was reached after a weighing of both parties' expert\n\ntestimony and necessarily based on the measure of damages proposed by the parties.\n\n                     II. Uppal's Challenge to Punitive Damages Award\n\n       Uppal advances a two-pronged argument against the jury's $700,000 punitive\n\ndamages award. First, he maintains that because Hackbart failed to establish actual\n\ncompensatory damages, he cannot be held responsible for punitive damages. Because we\n\nhave not disturbed the jury's compensatory damages verdict, that contention fails. Uppal\n\nfurther contends the $700,000 award is contrary to law as it has no rational relationship to\n\n                                             28\n\fhis financial condition, namely the fact he is insolvent and there was no proof he had any\n\nnet worth. Uppal summarizes his testimony at the punitive damages phase as indicating\n\n(1) he had no regular employment but acted as a consultant for various businesses; (2) he\n\nearned between $60,000 and $96,000 in 2010; (3) he did not own a business; (4) he\n\nowned a vehicle worth $10,000 and a home with no equity; (5) his 2009 tax return\n\nshowed an adjusted gross income of $112,805.00; and (6) he had no real estate other than\n\nhis heavily-encumbered home, no stocks or bonds, and no cash savings. He asks us to\n\nstrike the punitive damages award.\n\n       Hackbart responds that Uppal's summary of the evidence is incomplete; that the\n\nrecord shows the jury relied on other financial condition information from expert\n\nBergmark and also evidence of Uppal's access to loans from his mother and other family\n\nmembers, Uppal's ability to practice as a CPA, the existence of $100,000 cash in an\n\nescrow account, Uppal's $93,000 average yearly earning capacity, the $1,075,000 in cash\n\nUppal received from the sale of the Chevron station, and Uppal's 200910 tax return,\n\nwhich reflected $266,800 in earnings.\n\nA.

Analysis\n\n       Here, Hackbart called Uppal to testify concerning his financial condition, and also\n\npresented Bergmark to testify about Uppal's ability to pay certain sums of money, given\n\nhis income and ability to earn. The evidence showed Uppal's self-employment consulting\n\nincome was generally in the range of $60,000 to $72,000 per year, however, his self-\n\nemployment income reported to the IRS for 2009 was $266,800 (with $14,585 in\n\nexpenses against income). Uppal also received $12,000 per year in rental income and\n\nobtained loans from his mother and other family members to pay other debts. Without\n\nobjection, Bergmark testified that Uppal's yearly earnings given his education, age and\n\n                                              30\n\fexperience, and accounting for government and other benefits, were $93,632. Taking\n\ninto account his life expectancy (Uppal was 50 years old at the time), the present value of\n\nUppal's projected earnings was over $1.1 million. And, according to Bergmark, if Uppal\n\ncontinued to earn at the level his 2009 tax return indicated, he would be able to pay\n\n$3,152,261 in present value dollars. Bergmark did not look at Uppal's adjusted gross\n\nincome, which was $112,805, because Uppal had closed the businesses from which he\n\nreported net operating losses. Bergmark admitted on cross-examination that he did not\n\naccount for Uppal's expenses other than business expenses relating to his marketing or\n\nUppal's cost of living. Nor did Bergmark take into account Uppal's income tax\n\nobligations to the state or federal government; he explained he only performed an earning\n\ncapacity analysis.\n\n       On this record, we vacate the $700,000 punitive damages award in view of the\n\nabsence of meaningful evidence of Uppal's actual wealth or ability to pay such a damages\n\naward. In Kenly v. Ukegawa (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2253467\"><a href=\"/opinion/2253467/kenly-v-ukegawa/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, this court expressly rejected the\n\nplaintiff's argument that the punitive damages award in that case could be based solely on\n\nthe defendant's alleged profit: \"An award based solely on the alleged 'profit' gained by\n\nthe defendant, in the absence of evidence of net worth, raises the potential of its crippling\n\nor destroying the defendant, focusing as it does solely on the assets side of the balance\n\nsheet without examining the liabilities side of the balance sheet. Without evidence of the\n\nentire financial picture, an award based on 'profit' could leave a defendant devoid of\n\nassets with which to pay his other liabilities.\" (Id. at p. 57.) We made it clear that our\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\fholding did not preclude such a showing in all cases, however, as long as there was some\n\nevidence to demonstrate that the defendant would not be crippled by the award. (Id. at\n\np. 57, fn. 7.) In Kelly v. Haag, we held a $75,000 punitive damages award lacked\n\nevidentiary support where the plaintiff only produced evidence of the defendant's\n\nstatements about certain properties and assets without evidence that he still owned them\n\nat the time of trial, and produced no evidence of the defendant's liabilities, requiring the\n\ntrial court to speculate as to any liabilities. (Kelly v. Haag, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at\n\np. 917.)\n\n       The evidence here fails for the same reasons we expressed in the above cases. As\n\nstated, Hackbart bore the burden of proving Uppal's financial condition or ability to pay\n\nfor purposes of the award (Adams v. Murakami (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 119; Baxter v.\n\nPeterson (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2254792\"><a href=\"/opinion/2254792/baxter-v-peterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Haag, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at\n\np. 916), which was required to be based on \"some evidence of the defendant's actual\n\nwealth. Normally, evidence of liabilities should accompany evidence of assets, and\n\nevidence of expenses should accompany evidence of income.\" (Baxter v. Peterson, at\n\np. 680.)\n\n       While the jury had before it evidence of Uppal's income, his earning capacity and\n\nthe present value of his lifetime earnings, it had no meaningful evidence of Uppal's\n\nliabilities. Absent such evidence, the jury was unable to \"assure that the award punishes\n\nbut [would] not cripple or bankrupt [him].\" (Kenly v. Ukegawa, supra, 16 Cal.App.4th at\n\np. 57; see also Baxter v. Peterson, supra, 150 Cal.App.4th at p. 681 [though record\n\nshowed the defendant owned substantial assets, it was silent with regard to her liabilities,\n\n                                             32\n\fand thus insufficient for a reviewing court to evaluate her ability to pay $75,000 in\n\npunitive damages].) Bergmark's testimony was limited to the present value of Uppal's\n\nearning capacity.\n\n       Hackbart suggests Uppal failed to produce adequate and timely financial condition\n\nevidence for the jury's evaluation. However, the record indicates Uppal provided\n\nHackbart's counsel with documents for the purpose of showing his financial condition for\n\nthe punitive damages phase, and Hackbart does not demonstrate he was prevented from\n\nobtaining evidence of Uppal's net worth or that he lacked any meaningful resource to\n\nobtain evidence of Uppal's financial condition or net worth. There is no indication Uppal\n\nfailed to comply with court orders for such information, or that any void in financial\n\ncondition information was attributable solely to Uppal.

Restitution Award Against Soni\n\n       Soni contends the trial court reversibly erred when it awarded Hackbart restitution\n\non a theory of unjust enrichment. Pointing out he obtained a nonsuit on Hackbart's fraud\n\ncauses of action, he maintains Hackbart's claims of unjust enrichment/restitution are not\n\nstand-alone causes of action but are merely duplicative of Hackbart's fraud claims as\n\nevidenced by the allegations of Hackbart's operative complaint, and thus there was no\n\nlegal basis on which Hackbart could premise a theory of unjust enrichment. He argues\n\nthat even if Hackbart could maintain a claim for unjust enrichment, there is no basis for a\n\nrestitution award against him without evidence to support a finding that Hackbart\n\nsuffered fraud damages from the sale.\n\n       Hackbart correctly concedes unjust enrichment is not an independent cause of\n\naction.

And,\n\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\faccording to Hackbart, section 2224,11 relating to constructive trusts, sets out general\n\nprinciples that permitted the trial court to enter a restitutionary award against Soni in\n\nview of evidence that Soni knew of the businesses' precarious financial condition, acted\n\n\"in close concert\" with Uppal in the management and financing of the busineses, and\n\nurged Uppal to \" 'do the minimum necessary' to market and sell them on his behalf, as\n\nquickly as possible.\"\n\n       Unjust enrichment is \" ' \"a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines\n\nand remedies,\" ' rather than a remedy itself.\" (Melchior, supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at\n\np. 793.) It \"is a common law obligation implied by law based on the equities of a\n\nparticular case and not on any contractual obligation. [Citation.] Whether termed unjust\n\nenrichment, quasi-contract, or quantum meruit, the equitable remedy of restitution when\n\nunjust enrichment has occurred 'is an obligation (not a true contract [citation]) created by\n\nthe law without regard to the intention of the parties, and is designed to restore the\n\naggrieved party to his or her former position by return of the thing or its equivalent in\n\nmoney.' \" (F.D.I.C. v.

Unjust enrichment is\n\nsynonymous with restitution, and has been characterized as describing the result of a\n\nfailure to make restitution.

In First\n\nNationwide, the defendant against whom restitution was sought was the nonassuming\n\n                                                38\n\fgrantee of a purchase money deed of trust who sold property after a mistaken\n\nreconveyance by a trustee sued by the plaintiff beneficiary in the form of claims for\n\n\"unjust enrichment\" and money had and received. (Id. at p. 1660.) The Court of Appeal\n\nheld the plaintiff should be permitted leave to amend to allege the defendant's knowledge\n\nof the trustee's mistaken reconveyance, and with such allegations could maintain a claim\n\nfor unjust enrichment. (Id. at pp. 1669-1670.) Unlike Perry, there were no viable causes\n\nof action remaining against Soni. And, to the extent Perry can be read as recognizing a\n\nstand-alone cause of action for unjust enrichment, we decline to follow it.\n\n       Without a finding that Soni committed fraud or some other wrongdoing that would\n\nrender it unjust for him to retain his benefit, it was not proper to enter a restitutionary\n\naward against him on the basis of theories of unjust enrichment or constructive trust.\n\n(Accord, Borton v. Joslin (1928) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3293459\"><a href=\"/opinion/3294773/borton-v-joslin/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

We reverse the restitution award against Soni.\n\n                                IV. Hackbart's Cross-Appeal\n\nA. Adequacy of Restitution Award\n\n       Hackbart contends the trial court abused its discretion in its restitution award\n\nagainst Soni; that Soni received an actual benefit beyond the $232,000 in net cash\n\nproceeds from the sale of the business. According to Hackbart, the trial court should\n\nhave calculated the restitutionary award as $560,000 based on Soni's 40 percent\n\nproportionate share of the $1,400,000 gross out-of-pocket damages awarded.\n\n                                              39\n\f       We have already reversed the restitution award against Soni as unsupported by an\n\nappropriate finding of wrongdoing sufficient to render it unjust for him to retain the sales\n\nproceeds. But Hackbart's contention is unavailing for another reason, namely, there is no\n\nindication in the record that Hackbart moved for a new trial on the ground of inadequate\n\ndamages. \"[F]ailure to timely move for a new trial ordinarily precludes a party from\n\ncomplaining on appeal that the damages awarded were either excessive or inadequate,\n\nwhether the case was tried by a jury or by the court.\" (Jamison v. Jamison (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252910\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252910/jamison-v-jamison/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719.)\n\nB. Alter Ego Liability\n\n       In its statement of decision, the trial court declined to impose alter ego liability on\n\neither Soni or Bhavna. Emphasizing the doctrine was limited and invoked only \"where\n\nrecognition of the corporate form would work an injustice to a third person,\" it ruled the\n\nevidence did not support its application, reasoning: \"Mr. Hackbart entered into the\n\ncontract with MTPA knowing it to be a corporation. He received and continues to\n\npossess all of MTPA's known assets, and he had no reason to believe that he could rely\n\non the financial responsibility of the individual shareholders.\" In a footnote, the court\n\nadded: \"Mr. Hackbart acknowledged that he did not rely on either Mrs. Uppal or\n\nMr. Soni's representations in determining to enter into Exhibit [No.] 186.\"] It continued:\n\n\"The individual conduct of Mr. Uppal and not the existence and/or continued\n\nmaintenance of the corporate entity is the source of any injustice suffered by\n\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\fMr. Hackbart. Mr. Uppal is not the subject of this analysis as the record is clear that he\n\nwas not a shareholder of MTPA.\"13\n\n       Hackbart contends the trial court committed an error of law by refusing to impose\n\nalter ego liability against Soni. Pointing to its focus on Hackbart's knowledge of MTPA's\n\ncorporate status and the reasonableness of looking to the individual shareholders'\n\nfinancial responsibility, he maintains the court applied improper legal criteria,\n\nparticularly in view of the evidence that MTPA was defunct as well as the court's\n\nfindings that Uppal acted at all times on the corporation's behalf, Soni had substantial\n\nparticipation in the business's operations and financing, and Soni was aware Uppal had\n\novervalued it for purposes of the sale. Hackbart argues this error \"led [the court] astray,\n\nallowing a shareholder who both actively encouraged and benefitted from a fraud\n\nperpetrated on his behalf to misuse the corporate form to escape individual liability.\"\n\n       1. Standard of Review\n\n       Hackbart's challenge to the court's alter ego analysis and his claim the court did\n\nnot apply correct legal criteria is assessed independently. (Enrique M. v.

The issue is not so much whether, for all purposes, the\n\ncorporation is the 'alter ego' of its stockholders or officers, nor whether the very purpose\n\nof the organization of the corporation was to defraud the individual who is now in court\n\ncomplaining, as it is an issue of whether in the particular case presented and for the\n\npurposes of such case justice and equity can best be accomplished and fraud and\n\nunfairness defeated by a disregard of the distinct entity of the corporate form.' \" (Kohn v.\n\nKohn (1950) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The doctrine is not itself a claim for substantive relief as a claim\n\nfor breach of contract, rather, it is a procedural device by which courts disregard the\n\ncorporate entity in order to hold the alter ego individual liable on the corporation's\n\nobligations. (Leek v. Cooper (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

There are,\n\nnevertheless, two general requirements: '(1) that there be such unity of interest and\n\nownership that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual no longer\n\nexist and (2) that, if the acts are treated as those of the corporation alone, an inequitable\n\nresult will follow.' \" (Mesler v.

[and] that liability is imposed to reach an equitable\n\nresult.' \" It cited to the appellate court's statement in Webber v. Inland Empire\n\nInvestments, Inc. (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248635\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248635/webber-v-inland-empire-investments/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> that the doctrine is limited and only invoked\n\n\" 'where recognition of the corporate form would work an injustice to a third person.' \"\n\n       Given these comments, it is evident the trial court rightly focused on the justice or\n\ninjustice flowing from recognition of MTPA's corporate form. Importantly, Soni\n\nobtained a nonsuit on Hackbart's fraud claims; indeed as part of its alter ego analysis the\n\ntrial court found Hackbart did not rely on any of Soni's statements in entering into the\n\n\n\n14      Because the doctrine is equitable, its application \" ' \"is not made to depend upon\nprior decisions involving factual situations which appear to be similar . . . .\" ' \"\n(Greenspan v. LADT, LLC, supra, 191 Cal.App.4th at p. 512.) Factors relevant to this\nanalysis include \"the disregard of legal formalities and the failure to maintain arm's\nlength relationships among related entities,\" \"the failure to maintain minutes or adequate\ncorporate records,\" \"the confusion of the records of the separate entities,\" the \"failure to\nsegregate funds of the separate entities,\" \"[c]ommingling of funds and other assets,\" \"the\ntotal absence of corporate assets and undercapitalization,\" the failure \"to issue stock,\"\n\"sole ownership of all of the stock in a corporation by one individual or the members of a\nfamily,\" overlapping officers and directors, \"the use of the same office or business\nlocation,\" \"the employment of the same employees and/or attorney,\" \"the unauthorized\ndiversion of corporate funds or assets to other than corporate uses,\" \"the use of a\ncorporation as a mere shell, instrumentality or conduit,\" and \"the diversion of assets from\na corporation by or to a stockholder.\" (Associated Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co.\n(1962) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2211258\"><a href=\"/opinion/2211258/associated-vendors-inc-v-oakland-meat-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

This precluded a finding that Soni intended to defraud Hackbart or used the\n\ncorporate entity to perpetrate a fraud. Though the trial court did not make express\n\nfindings on all of the factors recited above (fn. 13, ante) it had wide latitude (see Troyk v.\n\nFarmers Group, Inc., supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1341-1342) to assess all of the\n\nfactual circumstances, not only those factors delineated by courts. As we have stated, the\n\ninquiry is fact-intenstive, and there is no single litmus test. (Mesler v. Bragg\n\nManagement Co., supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 300.) We cannot say, based on the trial court's\n\ncitation to relevant authorities and its focus on facts bearing on the equities of\n\ndisregarding the corporate existence, it used erroneous legal standards in reaching its\n\nconclusion. At bottom, the doctrine \"is an extreme remedy, sparingly used\" (Sonora\n\nDiamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2250866\"><a href=\"/opinion/2250866/sonora-diamond-corp-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Las Palmas Center Associates, supra, 235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1249.)\n\nThe doctrine \"does not guard every unsatisfied creditor of a corporation but instead\n\naffords protection where some conduct amounting to bad faith makes it inequitable for\n\nthe corporate owner to hide behind the corporate form. Difficulty in enforcing a\n\njudgment or collecting a debt does not satisfy this standard.\" (Sonora Diamond Corp., at\n\np. 539.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              45\n\f       Hackbart criticizes the court for failing to recognize evidence that Soni admitted\n\nno shares of MTPA were distributed, MTPA never held shareholder or director meetings,\n\nand Uppal and Soni abided by few corporate formalities. Mere failure to follow\n\ncorporate formalities without inequity will not support application of the doctrine,\n\nhowever. Failure to issue stock is relevant, but not conclusive. (Automotriz Del Golfo\n\nDe California S.A. de C.V. v.

And, there was trial\n\nevidence that there was not a unity of interest (Uppal's and Soni's 60/40 ownership).\n\nHackbart also argues his knowledge of MTPA's corporate status is not a reason to deny\n\nalter ego liability where \"assets that purportedly belonged to a corporation remained in\n\nthe name of individual shareholders while the corporation was in operation, and any\n\nassets actually held by the corporation were immediately stripped-out when the sale to\n\nHackbart was complete, with no formal wind-out of the corporate entity after its sale.\"\n\nHackbart provides no record citation that such evidence was presented in this case, and\n\nthe trial court found otherwise, stating Hackbart \"received and continues to possess all of\n\nMTPA's known assets . . . .\" In any event, Hackbart does not challenge the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence of the court's findings, and we conclude there is no reason to disturb its\n\nruling on Hackbart's claim of legal error.\n\n\n\n\n                                             46\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n\n       That portion of the judgment awarding David Hackbart and Kihack Management,\n\nLLC $232,000 in restitution against Suresh K.
