Plaintiff-Appellant Lorraine\nMartin brought an action alleging libel and other publication-related claims\nagainst media outlets that published accounts of her 2010 arrest. She alleged that\nalthough the accounts were factually true when published, they became false and\ndefamatory when the charges against her were nolled because, under\nConnecticut’s Criminal Records Erasure Statute, when charges against an\nindividual are nolled or dismissed, that individual’s criminal records are erased\nand he is ‚deemed to have never been arrested.‛ The district court granted\nDefendants’ motions for summary judgment and dismissed each of Martin’s\nclaims.

Local media\n\noutlets published stories accurately reporting the arrest and that Martin was\n\ncharged with various drug-related offenses. Although she concedes that the\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\farticles were factually true at the time they were published, Martin sued the\n\npublishers for libel and related claims on the theory that it became false and\n\ndefamatory to report her arrest once the charges against her were nolled1 and the\n\nrecords of her arrest and prosecution erased pursuant to Connecticut’s Criminal\n\nRecords Erasure Statute, Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-142a (the ‚Erasure Statute‛). The\n\nErasure Statute requires that criminal records related to an arrest be destroyed if\n\nthe individual is subsequently found not guilty or pardoned or if the charges are\n\nnolled or dismissed. The statute further provides that ‚*a]ny person who shall\n\nhave been the subject of such an erasure shall be deemed to have never been\n\narrested within the meaning of the general statutes with respect to the\n\nproceedings so erased and may so swear under oath.‛ Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-\n\n142a(e)(3). This appeal requires us to determine whether, because the charges\n\nagainst her were nolled and she is now ‚deemed to have never been arrested,‛\n\nMartin is entitled to assert various publication-related claims against the\n\n\n1\n A nolle prosequi is a ‚unilateral act by a prosecutor, which ends the pending\nproceedings without an acquittal and without placing the defendant in jeopardy.‛ Cislo\nv. City of Shelton, 240 Conn. 590, 599 n.9 (1997) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted); see generally Bernard A. Kosicki, The Function of Nolle Prosequi and Motion to\nDismiss in Connecticut, 36 Conn. B.J. 159 (1962). Under Connecticut law, a nolle prosequi\nterminates the prosecution, but the prosecutor may initiate a new action against the\ndefendant within the statute of limitations. See State v. Smith, 289 Conn. 598, 611 (2008).\nA nolle prosequi may not be entered if the accused objects and demands either a trial or\ndismissal. Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-56b.\n\n                                            3\n\fpublishers of contemporaneous news accounts of her arrest on the ground that\n\nthose accounts are now false or misleading.\n\n      We conclude that the Erasure Statute does not render tortious historically\n\naccurate news accounts of an arrest and therefore affirm the district court’s grant\n\nof summary judgment for the Defendants.\n\n\n                                BACKGROUND\n\n      Martin and her two sons were arrested on August 20, 2010, after police,\n\nwho suspected a drug ring was operating out of her house, searched her home\n\nand found marijuana, scales, plastic bags, and drug paraphernalia. Martin and\n\nher sons were charged with various offenses related to the possession of\n\nnarcotics and drug paraphernalia.\n\n      Local newspapers reported Martin’s arrest. On August 26, 2010, the\n\nConnecticut Post, Stamford Advocate, and Greenwich Time, all owned by Defendant-\n\nAppellee Hearst Corporation, published articles online, stating that Martin had\n\nbeen ‚arrested and charged with numerous drug violations Aug. 20 after police\n\nreceived information that a pair of brothers were [sic+ selling marijuana in town.‛\n\nJ.A. 26, 28, 30. On August 27, 2010, Defendant-Appellee News 12 Interactive LLC\n\npublished an Internet article that reported that Martin was ‚arrested on Aug. 20\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fafter police say they confiscated 12 grams of marijuana, scales and traces of\n\ncocaine from *her+ house.‛ J.A. 32. Martin concedes that these reports were\n\naccurate at the time they were published. The articles remain available online.\n\n         More than a year after the Defendants published the reports of Martin’s\n\narrest, the State of Connecticut decided not to pursue its case against her, and a\n\nnolle prosequi was entered in January 2012. Because the criminal case against\n\nher was nolled, Martin’s arrest records were erased pursuant to the Erasure\n\nStatute.2\n\n         After the case against her was nolled, Martin asked each of the Defendants\n\nto remove the accounts of her arrest from their respective websites. In her view,\n\nonce erasure occurred in January, 2011, it became false and defamatory to report\n\n\n\n2   The operative sections of the statute provide as follows:\n\n         (c)(1) Whenever any charge in a criminal case has been nolled in the\n         Superior Court, or in the Court of Common Pleas, if at least thirteen\n         months have elapsed since such nolle, all police and court records and\n         records of the state’s or prosecuting attorney or the prosecuting grand\n         juror pertaining to such charge shall be erased . . . .\n         ...\n         (e)(3) Any person who shall have been the subject of such an erasure shall\n         be deemed to have never been arrested within the meaning of the general\n         statutes with respect to the proceedings so erased and may so swear\n         under oath.\n\nConn. Gen. Stat. § 54-142a(c)(1).\n\n\n                                               5\n\fof her arrest because, by operation of the Erasure Statute, she is ‚deemed to have\n\nnever been arrested within the meaning of the general statutes with respect to\n\nthe proceedings so erased.‛ Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-142a(e)(3).\n\n         When the Defendants refused to remove the stories from their websites,\n\nMartin filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nConnecticut, asserting causes of action for libel, placing another in a false light\n\nbefore the public, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of\n\nprivacy by appropriation. The district court (Shea, J.) awarded summary\n\njudgment to the Defendants on all claims. It reasoned that ‚the ‘deemer’\n\nprovision of Connecticut’s erasure laws does not alter the historical fact that Ms.\n\nMartin was arrested‛ and that all of Martin’s claims necessarily fail because\n\n‚there is no genuine dispute that the reports of her 2010 arrest in the articles at\n\nissue remain as true now as on the date they were first published.‛ Martin v.\n\nHearst Corp., No. 3:12cv1023 (MPS), 2013 WL 5310165, at *1 (D. Conn. Aug. 5,\n\n2013).\n\n         On appeal to this Court, Martin reiterates her argument that, even though\n\nshe was arrested, once erasure occurred in January 2011, it became false and\n\ndefamatory to publish statements regarding that arrest.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                    DISCUSSION3\n\n       The consequences of a criminal arrest are wide-ranging and long-lasting,\n\neven where an individual is subsequently found not guilty or the charges against\n\nhim are dismissed. Employers or landlords might, for example, discriminate\n\nagainst prospective employees or tenants who have arrest records without\n\ndistinguishing those merely arrested from those arrested and subsequently\n\nconvicted. To ‚protect individuals who are arrested but not convicted from the\n\nadverse effects of an arrest record,‛ State v. West, 192 Conn. 488, 493 (1984), the\n\nErasure Statute wipes the slate clean by ‚[p]rohibiting the subsequent use of\n\nrecords of [a] prior arrest and court proceedings,‛ State v. Morowitz, 200 Conn.\n\n440, 451 (1986), and requiring the state to erase official records of an arrest if the\n\nindividual is subsequently found not guilty or pardoned or if the charges against\n\nhim are nolled or dismissed.\n\n       The Erasure Statute further provides that ‚[a]ny person who shall have\n\nbeen the subject of such an erasure shall be deemed to have never been arrested\n\nwithin the meaning of the general statutes with respect to the proceedings so\n\n3\n A district court’s award of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. Nora Beverages\nInc. v. Perrier Grp. of Am., Inc., 164 F.3d 736, 742 (2d Cir. 1998). Summary judgment is\nappropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n                                            7\n\ferased and may so swear under oath.‛ Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-142a(e)(3). The\n\nstatute thus ‚insulat[es] the defendant from the consequences of the prior\n\nprosecution‛ by ensuring that ‚the defendant is no longer considered to have\n\nbeen arrested for the alleged crimes to which the records pertained‛ and\n\nallowing him to swear so under oath. State v. Apt, 146 Conn. App. 641, 649–50\n\n(Conn. App. Ct. 2013) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                     The Historical Truth of Martin’s Arrest\n\n      Although Martin concedes that she was, in fact, arrested on August 20,\n\n2010, she argues that it became false to publish statements regarding the arrest\n\nafter the charges against her were nolled. She reasons that the Erasure Statute\n\nrendered it factually false to continue to state that she was arrested and that the\n\nDefendants’ once-true reports have become defamatory.\n\n      Martin misunderstands the effect of the Erasure Statute. Subsection (e)(3)\n\ndeems a person to have never been arrested. Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-142a(e)(3)\n\n(emphasis added). That is to say, as a matter of legal fiction, the defendant is no\n\nlonger considered to have been arrested. Thus, the Erasure Statute bars the\n\ngovernment from relying on a defendant’s erased police, court, or prosecution\n\nrecords in a later trial, Morowitz, 200 Conn. at 447–48, prohibits courts from\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\frelying on the defendant’s historical status as an arrestee to enhance his sentence\n\nfor a later offense, Apt, 146 Conn. App. at 648–50, and entitles a defendant to\n\nswear under oath that he has never been arrested, Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-\n\n142a(e)(3). If the state decides to reverse course and charge a defendant whose\n\nrecords have been erased, it may not simply reactivate the nolled charges, but\n\nmust instead charge the defendant in a new information as if he had not\n\npreviously been arrested and charged. State v. Anonymous (1987–1), 11 Conn.\n\nApp. 224, 225 & n.1 (Conn. App. Ct. 1987) (per curiam).\n\n      ‚*W+e are bound to interpret Connecticut law according to Connecticut’s\n\nown interpretive rules.‛ Morenz v. Wilson-Coker, 415 F.3d 230, 236–37 (2d Cir.\n\n2005). Under those rules, ‚*t+he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance,\n\nbe ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other\n\nstatutes.‛ Conn. Gen. Stat. § 1-2z. It therefore matters that the statute appears in\n\nthe Criminal Procedure title of the Connecticut General Statutes (title 54), not the\n\ntitle dealing with Civil Actions (title 52). The legislature evidently did not intend\n\nto provide a basis for defamation suits.\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f       Accordingly, the statute only requires that certain official records be\n\nerased.4 The few enumerated exceptions to the erasure requirements and the\n\nstatute’s text confirm that the legislature contemplated erasure only in the\n\ncontext of the judicial and law enforcement systems.5 As the district court\n\nreasoned, ‚*n+othing in [§ 54-142a] suggests any intent to impose requirements\n\non persons who work outside courts or law enforcement agencies, and nothing\n\nsuggests any intent to mandate the erasure of records held by such persons.‛\n\nMartin, 2013 WL 5310165, at *3.\n\n\n\n4 See, e.g., West, 192 Conn. 496–97 (‚hold[ing] that the fingerprints, pictures and\ndescriptions and other identification data . . . are not among the records whose\ndisclosure is governed by § 54-142a‛) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. State v.\nWeber, 49 Conn. Supp. 530, 531–32 (Conn. Super. Ct. 2004) (‚The fundamental purpose\nof the statute is served by permitting limited disclosure of the records to counsel for the\nstate in order for it to take reasonable steps to defend itself against Weber’s threatened\naction while sealing and segregating the records to prevent disclosure to anyone else.‛).\n5 ‚*A+ record or transcript of the proceedings made or prepared by an official court\n\nreporter, assistant court reporter or monitor‛ does not have to be erased, Conn. Gen.\nStat. § 54-142a(h), and a court may order disclosure of ‚erased‛ records ‚to a defendant\nin an action for false arrest arising out of the proceedings so erased‛ or ‚to the\nprosecuting attorney and defense counsel in connection with any perjury charges which\nthe prosecutor alleges may have arisen from the testimony elicited during the trial,‛\n§ 54-142a(f). Subsections (b) and (c)(1) provide that, in certain kinds of cases, ‚the clerk\nor any person charged with the retention and control of‛ ‚police and court records and\nrecords of the state’s or prosecuting attorney . . . pertaining to *the+ charge*s+‛ ‚shall not\ndisclose to anyone their existence or any information pertaining to any charge so\nerased.‛ § 54-142a(b), (c)(1). And, subsection (e) is specifically addressed to ‚*t+he clerk\nof the court or any person charged with retention and control of such records in the\nrecords center of the Judicial Department or any law enforcement agency.‛ § 54-\n142a(e)(1).\n\n                                             10\n\f      In short, the Erasure Statute requires the state to erase certain official\n\nrecords of an arrest and grants the defendant the legal status of one who has not\n\nbeen arrested. But the Erasure Statute’s effects end there. The statute creates\n\nlegal fictions, but it does not and cannot undo historical facts or convert once-\n\ntrue facts into falsehoods. Just as the Erasure Statute does not prevent the\n\ngovernment from presenting witness testimony at a later trial that describes the\n\nconduct that underlies an erased arrest, Morowitz, 200 Conn. at 448–49, the\n\nstatute does not render historically accurate news accounts of an arrest tortious\n\nmerely because the defendant is later deemed as a matter of legal fiction never to\n\nhave been arrested.\n\n      Connecticut courts confirm our view. In Martin v. Griffin, a Connecticut\n\nSuperior Court rejected the notion that ‚the statement that the plaintiff was\n\narrested is false in its entirety because the arrest ‘was deemed never to have\n\noccurred pursuant to C.G.S. Section 54-142a(e),’‛ No. CV 990586133S, 2000 WL\n\n872464, at *12 (Conn. Super. Ct. June 13, 2000). The Superior Court explained\n\nthat the Erasure Statute ‚operates in the legal sphere, not the historical sphere,‛\n\nand it ‚does not, and could not, purport to wipe from the public record the fact\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\fthat certain historical events have taken place.‛ Id. Courts in other states with\n\nanalogous statutes are in accord.6\n\n      Here, the uncontroverted fact is that Martin was arrested on August 20,\n\n2010, and that the reports of her arrest were true at the time they were published.\n\nNeither the Erasure Statute nor any amount of wishing can undo that historical\n\ntruth. The Moving Finger has written and moved on.7 Because there is no\n\ndispute that the articles published by the Defendants accurately report Martin’s\n\narrest, her various publication-related tort claims necessarily fail. Martin’s\n\n\n6 See, e.g., G.D. v. Kenny, 15 A.3d 300, 315–16 (N.J. 2011) (‚*T+he expungement statute\ndoes not transmute a once-true fact into a falsehood. It does not require the excision of\nrecords from the historical archives of newspapers or bound volumes of reported\ndecisions or a personal diary. . . . It is not intended to create an Orwellian scheme\nwhereby previously public information—long maintained in official records—now\nbecomes beyond the reach of public discourse on penalty of a defamation action.\nAlthough our expungement statute generally permits a person whose record has been\nexpunged to misrepresent his past, it does not alter the metaphysical truth of his past,\nnor does it impose a regime of silence on those who know the truth.‛); Bahr v. Statesman\nJournal Co., 624 P.2d 664, 666 (Or. Ct. App. 1981) (‚The *expungement+ statute does not,\nhowever, impose any duty on members of the public who are aware of the conviction to\npretend that it does not exist. In other words, the statute authorizes certain persons to\nmisrepresent their own past. It does not make that representation true.‛); Rzeznik v.\nChief of Police of Southhampton, 373 N.E.2d 1128, 1133 (Mass. 1978) (‚There is nothing in\nthe statute or the legislative history to suggest that, once the fact of a conviction is\nsealed, it becomes nonexistent, and hence untrue for the purposes of the common law of\ndefamation.‛).\n7 ‚The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\n\nMoves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit\nShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\nNor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.‛ Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, stanza 71 (Edward\nFitzgerald trans., 4th ed. 1879).\n\n                                           12\n\fclaims for libel and placing another in a false light fail because the articles do not\n\ncontain falsehoods. Her claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress fails\n\nbecause there is nothing negligent about publishing a true and newsworthy\n\narticle. See Finnelli v. Tepfer, No. CV075011659S, 2009 WL 1424688, at *7 (Conn.\n\nSuper. Ct. Apr. 24, 2009). And her claim for invasion of privacy by appropriation\n\nfails because a newspaper does not improperly appropriate an individual’s name\n\nor likeness merely by publishing an article that brings the individual’s activities\n\nbefore the public. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652C cmt. d.\n\n                            Defamation by Implication\n\n      Martin next argues that even if the Erasure Statute does not make the\n\nstatements about her arrest technically false, the reports of her arrest are\n\nnonetheless defamatory because they only tell part of the story. The articles\n\nreport that she was arrested and charged without mentioning that the criminal\n\ncase against her was eventually nolled.\n\n      It is axiomatic, of course, that truth is an absolute defense to a defamation\n\nclaim. But in certain circumstances even a technically true statement can be so\n\nconstructed as to carry a false and defamatory meaning by implication or\n\ninnuendo. Where a publication implies something false and defamatory by\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fomitting or strategically juxtaposing key facts, the publication may be actionable\n\neven though all of the individual statements are literally true when considered in\n\nisolation. See Strada v. Conn. Newspapers, Inc., 193 Conn. 313, 322–23 (1984); see\n\nalso Robert D. Sack, Sack on Defamation § 3:8 (4th ed. 2010).\n\n       The classic example of defamation by implication is Memphis Publishing Co.\n\nv. Nichols, 569 S.W.2d 412 (Tenn. 1978), in which a newspaper reported that a\n\nwoman, upon arriving at the home of another woman and finding her own\n\nhusband there ‚first fired a shot at her husband and then at [the other woman],\n\nstriking her in the arm.‛ Id. at 414. The article neglected to mention, however,\n\nthe additional facts that several neighbors and the husband of the other woman\n\nwere also present, that all were sitting together in the living room talking, and\n\nthat the shooting was accidental. Even though the statements in the article were\n\nall technically true, the article falsely implied that the husband and the other\n\nwoman had been shot at because they were caught in an adulterous affair and\n\nhad become targets of an enraged wife—a meaning both false and defamatory.\n\nId. at 419.\n\n       The news reports at issue in this case, however, do not imply any fact\n\nabout Martin that is not true. They simply state that she was arrested and\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fcriminally charged, both of which Martin admits are true. Reasonable readers\n\nunderstand that some people who are arrested are guilty and that others are not.\n\nReasonable readers also know that in some cases individuals who are arrested\n\nwill eventually have charges against them dropped. Reporting Martin’s arrest\n\nwithout an update may not be as complete a story as Martin would like, but it\n\nimplies nothing false about her. Accordingly, we reject Martin’s contention that\n\nthe reports of her arrest are defamatory because they fail to mention that the case\n\nagainst her was eventually nolled.\n\n\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      We have considered all of Martin’s arguments on appeal and find them to\n\nbe without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court\n\ngranting summary judgment for the Defendants is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f",

Martin and\n\nher sons were charged with various offenses related to the possession of\n\nnarcotics and drug paraphernalia.\n\n      Local newspapers reported Martin’s arrest. On August 26, 2010, the\n\nConnecticut Post, Stamford Advocate, and Greenwich Time, all owned by Defendant-\n\nAppellee Hearst Corporation, published articles online, stating that Martin had\n\nbeen ‚arrested and charged with numerous drug violations Aug. 20 after police\n\nreceived information that a pair of brothers were [sic+ selling marijuana in town.‛\n\nJ.A. 26, 28, 30. On August 27, 2010, Defendant-Appellee News 12 Interactive LLC\n\npublished an Internet article that reported that Martin was ‚arrested on Aug. 20\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fafter police say they confiscated 12 grams of marijuana, scales and traces of\n\ncocaine from *her+ house.‛ J.A. 32. Martin concedes that these reports were\n\naccurate at the time they were published. The articles remain available online.\n\n         More than a year after the Defendants published the reports of Martin’s\n\narrest, the State of Connecticut decided not to pursue its case against her, and a\n\nnolle prosequi was entered in January 2012. Because the criminal case against\n\nher was nolled, Martin’s arrest records were erased pursuant to the Erasure\n\nStatute.2\n\n         After the case against her was nolled, Martin asked each of the Defendants\n\nto remove the accounts of her arrest from their respective websites. In her view,\n\nonce erasure occurred in January, 2011, it became false and defamatory to report\n\n\n\n2   The operative sections of the statute provide as follows:\n\n         (c)(1) Whenever any charge in a criminal case has been nolled in the\n         Superior Court, or in the Court of Common Pleas, if at least thirteen\n         months have elapsed since such nolle, all police and court records and\n         records of the state’s or prosecuting attorney or the prosecuting grand\n         juror pertaining to such charge shall be erased . . . .\n         ...\n         (e)(3) Any person who shall have been the subject of such an erasure shall\n         be deemed to have never been arrested within the meaning of the general\n         statutes with respect to the proceedings so erased and may so swear\n         under oath.\n\nConn. Gen. Stat. § 54-142a(c)(1).\n\n\n                                               5\n\fof her arrest because, by operation of the Erasure Statute, she is ‚deemed to have\n\nnever been arrested within the meaning of the general statutes with respect to\n\nthe proceedings so erased.‛ Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-142a(e)(3).\n\n         When the Defendants refused to remove the stories from their websites,\n\nMartin filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nConnecticut, asserting causes of action for libel, placing another in a false light\n\nbefore the public, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of\n\nprivacy by appropriation. The district court (Shea, J.) awarded summary\n\njudgment to the Defendants on all claims. It reasoned that ‚the ‘deemer’\n\nprovision of Connecticut’s erasure laws does not alter the historical fact that Ms.\n\nMartin was arrested‛ and that all of Martin’s claims necessarily fail because\n\n‚there is no genuine dispute that the reports of her 2010 arrest in the articles at\n\nissue remain as true now as on the date they were first published.‛ Martin v.\n\nHearst Corp., No. 3:12cv1023 (MPS), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5310165</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (D. Conn. Aug. 5,\n\n2013).\n\n         On appeal to this Court, Martin reiterates her argument that, even though\n\nshe was arrested, once erasure occurred in January 2011, it became false and\n\ndefamatory to publish statements regarding that arrest.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                    DISCUSSION3\n\n       The consequences of a criminal arrest are wide-ranging and long-lasting,\n\neven where an individual is subsequently found not guilty or the charges against\n\nhim are dismissed. Employers or landlords might, for example, discriminate\n\nagainst prospective employees or tenants who have arrest records without\n\ndistinguishing those merely arrested from those arrested and subsequently\n\nconvicted.

App. Ct. 2013) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                     The Historical Truth of Martin’s Arrest\n\n      Although Martin concedes that she was, in fact, arrested on August 20,\n\n2010, she argues that it became false to publish statements regarding the arrest\n\nafter the charges against her were nolled. She reasons that the Erasure Statute\n\nrendered it factually false to continue to state that she was arrested and that the\n\nDefendants’ once-true reports have become defamatory.\n\n      Martin misunderstands the effect of the Erasure Statute. Subsection (e)(3)\n\ndeems a person to have never been arrested. Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-142a(e)(3)\n\n(emphasis added). That is to say, as a matter of legal fiction, the defendant is no\n\nlonger considered to have been arrested. Thus, the Erasure Statute bars the\n\ngovernment from relying on a defendant’s erased police, court, or prosecution\n\nrecords in a later trial, Morowitz, 200 Conn. at 447–48, prohibits courts from\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\frelying on the defendant’s historical status as an arrestee to enhance his sentence\n\nfor a later offense, Apt, 146 Conn. App. at 648–50, and entitles a defendant to\n\nswear under oath that he has never been arrested, Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-\n\n142a(e)(3). If the state decides to reverse course and charge a defendant whose\n\nrecords have been erased, it may not simply reactivate the nolled charges, but\n\nmust instead charge the defendant in a new information as if he had not\n\npreviously been arrested and charged. State v. Anonymous (1987–1), 11 Conn.\n\nApp. 224, 225 & n.1 (Conn. App. Ct. 1987) (per curiam).\n\n      ‚*W+e are bound to interpret Connecticut law according to Connecticut’s\n\nown interpretive rules.‛ Morenz v.

Under those rules, ‚*t+he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance,\n\nbe ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other\n\nstatutes.‛ Conn. Gen. Stat. § 1-2z. It therefore matters that the statute appears in\n\nthe Criminal Procedure title of the Connecticut General Statutes (title 54), not the\n\ntitle dealing with Civil Actions (title 52). The legislature evidently did not intend\n\nto provide a basis for defamation suits.\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f       Accordingly, the statute only requires that certain official records be\n\nerased.4 The few enumerated exceptions to the erasure requirements and the\n\nstatute’s text confirm that the legislature contemplated erasure only in the\n\ncontext of the judicial and law enforcement systems.5 As the district court\n\nreasoned, ‚*n+othing in [§ 54-142a] suggests any intent to impose requirements\n\non persons who work outside courts or law enforcement agencies, and nothing\n\nsuggests any intent to mandate the erasure of records held by such persons.‛\n\nMartin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5310165</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3.\n\n\n\n4 See, e.g., West, 192 Conn. 496–97 (‚hold[ing] that the fingerprints, pictures and\ndescriptions and other identification data . . . are not among the records whose\ndisclosure is governed by § 54-142a‛) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf.

But the Erasure Statute’s effects end there. The statute creates\n\nlegal fictions, but it does not and cannot undo historical facts or convert once-\n\ntrue facts into falsehoods. Just as the Erasure Statute does not prevent the\n\ngovernment from presenting witness testimony at a later trial that describes the\n\nconduct that underlies an erased arrest, Morowitz, 200 Conn. at 448–49, the\n\nstatute does not render historically accurate news accounts of an arrest tortious\n\nmerely because the defendant is later deemed as a matter of legal fiction never to\n\nhave been arrested.\n\n      Connecticut courts confirm our view. In Martin v. Griffin, a Connecticut\n\nSuperior Court rejected the notion that ‚the statement that the plaintiff was\n\narrested is false in its entirety because the arrest ‘was deemed never to have\n\noccurred pursuant to C.G.S. Section 54-142a(e),’‛ No. CV 990586133S, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">872464</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *12 (Conn. Super. Ct. June 13, 2000). The Superior Court explained\n\nthat the Erasure Statute ‚operates in the legal sphere, not the historical sphere,‛\n\nand it ‚does not, and could not, purport to wipe from the public record the fact\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\fthat certain historical events have taken place.‛ Id. Courts in other states with\n\nanalogous statutes are in accord.6\n\n      Here, the uncontroverted fact is that Martin was arrested on August 20,\n\n2010, and that the reports of her arrest were true at the time they were published.\n\nNeither the Erasure Statute nor any amount of wishing can undo that historical\n\ntruth. The Moving Finger has written and moved on.7 Because there is no\n\ndispute that the articles published by the Defendants accurately report Martin’s\n\narrest, her various publication-related tort claims necessarily fail.

It does not make that representation true.‛); Rzeznik v.\nChief of Police of Southhampton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1128</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1133 (Mass. 1978) (‚There is nothing in\nthe statute or the legislative history to suggest that, once the fact of a conviction is\nsealed, it becomes nonexistent, and hence untrue for the purposes of the common law of\ndefamation.‛).\n7 ‚The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\n\nMoves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit\nShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\nNor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.‛ Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, stanza 71 (Edward\nFitzgerald trans., 4th ed. 1879).\n\n                                           12\n\fclaims for libel and placing another in a false light fail because the articles do not\n\ncontain falsehoods. Her claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress fails\n\nbecause there is nothing negligent about publishing a true and newsworthy\n\narticle. See Finnelli v. Tepfer, No. CV075011659S, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1424688</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (Conn.\n\nSuper. Ct. Apr. 24, 2009). And her claim for invasion of privacy by appropriation\n\nfails because a newspaper does not improperly appropriate an individual’s name\n\nor likeness merely by publishing an article that brings the individual’s activities\n\nbefore the public. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652C cmt. d.\n\n                            Defamation by Implication\n\n      Martin next argues that even if the Erasure Statute does not make the\n\nstatements about her arrest technically false, the reports of her arrest are\n\nnonetheless defamatory because they only tell part of the story. The articles\n\nreport that she was arrested and charged without mentioning that the criminal\n\ncase against her was eventually nolled.\n\n      It is axiomatic, of course, that truth is an absolute defense to a defamation\n\nclaim. But in certain circumstances even a technically true statement can be so\n\nconstructed as to carry a false and defamatory meaning by implication or\n\ninnuendo. Where a publication implies something false and defamatory by\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fomitting or strategically juxtaposing key facts, the publication may be actionable\n\neven though all of the individual statements are literally true when considered in\n\nisolation. See Strada v. Conn. Newspapers, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322–23 (1984); see\n\nalso Robert D. Sack, Sack on Defamation § 3:8 (4th ed. 2010).\n\n       The classic example of defamation by implication is Memphis Publishing Co.\n\nv. Nichols, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2450764\"><a href=\"/opinion/2450764/memphis-pub-co-v-nichols/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1978), in which a newspaper reported that a\n\nwoman, upon arriving at the home of another woman and finding her own\n\nhusband there ‚first fired a shot at her husband and then at [the other woman],\n\nstriking her in the arm.‛ Id. at 414. The article neglected to mention, however,\n\nthe additional facts that several neighbors and the husband of the other woman\n\nwere also present, that all were sitting together in the living room talking, and\n\nthat the shooting was accidental. Even though the statements in the article were\n\nall technically true, the article falsely implied that the husband and the other\n\nwoman had been shot at because they were caught in an adulterous affair and\n\nhad become targets of an enraged wife—a meaning both false and defamatory.\n\nId. at 419.\n\n       The news reports at issue in this case, however, do not imply any fact\n\nabout Martin that is not true. They simply state that she was arrested and\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fcriminally charged, both of which Martin admits are true. Reasonable readers\n\nunderstand that some people who are arrested are guilty and that others are not.\n\nReasonable readers also know that in some cases individuals who are arrested\n\nwill eventually have charges against them dropped. Reporting Martin’s arrest\n\nwithout an update may not be as complete a story as Martin would like, but it\n\nimplies nothing false about her. Accordingly, we reject Martin’s contention that\n\nthe reports of her arrest are defamatory because they fail to mention that the case\n\nagainst her was eventually nolled.\n\n\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      We have considered all of Martin’s arguments on appeal and find them to\n\nbe without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court\n\ngranting summary judgment for the Defendants is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f</pre>",
