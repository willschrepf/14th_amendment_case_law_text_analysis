Roughly one-half of\n\n    1\n       National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants\nfor Major Sources: Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers\nand Process Heaters (2011 Major Boilers Rule), 76 Fed.

Reg. 9,112 (Feb. 7,\n2013).\n\f                                2\n\nthe challenges are advanced by a group of municipal-electric\norganizations, industrial-trade associations, oil-and-gas\nindustry representatives, and other entities that own and\noperate boilers, process heaters, and incinerators (Industry\nPetitioners). The other one-half are pressed by organizations\ninterested in safeguarding the environment (Environmental\nPetitioners).\n\n                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n     The three rules at issue address a common phenomenon:\nwhen combustion occurs, emissions result. The emissions\ninclude numerous materials, some of which pose risks to the\nenvironment in general and to human health in particular.\nBecause combustion is an inevitable occurrence in the\nmachinery that helps to power modern society, the Congress\nhas authorized the EPA to provide for a regulatory framework\nthat minimizes the deleterious effects of the incineration\nindustry while simultaneously allowing it to operate.\n\n     In 2013, the EPA finalized its efforts to do so for discrete\ntypes of combustion machinery: boilers, process heaters, and\nincinerators. Two of the three rules at issue—the Major\nBoilers Rule and the Area Boilers Rule—govern boilers and\nprocess heaters. The former are enclosed devices that use a\ncontrolled flame to heat water and convert it into steam or hot\nwater. 40 C.F.R. § 63.11237. The latter are also enclosed\ndevices that use a controlled flame but, instead of generating\nsteam, they indirectly heat a “process material,” whether\nliquid, gas, or solid, or a “heat transfer material” like glycol or\na mixture of glycol and water. Id. For simplicity, our use of\n“boilers” covers both machinery types.\n\n    The two boiler-specific rules further divide the machinery\ninto three categories:        industrial, commercial, and\n\f                               3\n\ninstitutional. See 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,557. Industrial boilers are used for manufacturing,\nprocessing, mining, refining, and other similar operations.\nSee id. Commercial boilers are used by shopping malls,\nlaundromats, apartment complexes, restaurants, and hotels.\nSee id. And institutional boilers include those used by, e.g.,\nmedical centers, schools, churches, prisons, and courthouses.\nSee id. Collectively, over 200,000 boilers at over 100,000\nseparate facilities must comply with the standards set out in\nthe Major Boilers Rule or the Area Boilers Rule.\n\n     The third rule that we address—the CISWI Rule—\ngoverns combustion machinery known as “solid waste\nincineration unit[s].” 42 U.S.C. § 7429. The Act defines an\nincinerator as a “distinct operating unit of any facility” that\nburns solid waste from either commercial establishments,\nindustrial establishments, or the general public.            Id.\n§ 7429(g)(1). An incinerator subjects “waste material” to\n“high temperatures until it is reduced to ash.” Incinerator,\nNEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY 853 (2d ed. 2005).\nIncinerators fall into different subcategories and, in the past,\nthe EPA has issued rules governing many of them, including,\ne.g., municipal solid-waste incinerators, medical-waste\nincinerators, and sewage-sludge incinerators.4 At issue in the\nCISWI Rule are incinerators located in commercial or\nindustrial facilities that combust solid waste as defined in the\nResource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 6901 et seq. See 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,706.\n\n\n\n    4\n      See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. pt. 60, subpts. Cd, Ce, Eb, AAAA,\nBBBB, EEEE, FFFF, LLLL, MMMM.\n\f                              4\n\n    A. THE CLEAN AIR ACT, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7401 ET SEQ.\n\n     Enacted “to protect and enhance the quality of the\nNation’s air resources so as to promote the public health and\nwelfare and the productive capacity of its population,” 42\nU.S.C. § 7401(b)(1), the Act has been amended several times\nsince the Congress first attempted to control air pollution via\nlegislation in 1963. In 1970, the Congress required the EPA\nto identify and publish a list of HAPs, which the CAA defined\nas substances that increase “mortality,” “serious irreversible”\nillness, or “incapacitating reversible” illness. Clean Air\nAmendments of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-604, § 4(a), 84 Stat.\n1676, 1685 (1970). The EPA had to set emission limits for\nevery HAP based on the risk it posed to human health. See\nSierra Club v. EPA (Sierra Club I), 353 F.3d 976, 979 (D.C.\nCir. 2004). In other words, the EPA was to “consider[] levels\nof HAPs at which health effects are observed, factor[] in an\nample margin of safety to protect the public health, and set\nemission restrictions accordingly.” Id. (quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n     The risk-focused approach to capping HAP emissions left\nsomething to be desired. “In light of unrealistic time frames\nand scientific uncertain[t]y over which substances posed a\nthreat to public health,” the EPA “only listed eight pollutants\nas hazardous between 1970 and 1990,” Nat. Res. Def. Council\nv. EPA (NRDC II), 529 F.3d 1077, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 2008), and\nset “emission standards for [only] seven of them,” Sierra Club\nI, 353 F.3d at 979; see also S. REP. NO. 101-228, at 3 (1989)\n(“Very little has been done since the passage of the 1970 Act\nto identify and control hazardous air pollutants.”). After\ntwenty years of the risk-based approach, the Congress went\nback to the drawing board and, via the 1990 CAA\nAmendments, Pub. L. No. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399 (1990),\n\f                               5\n\nestablished the technology-based approach that governs\ntoday. See Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 979.\n\n    1. 42 U.S.C. § 7412—“Hazardous Air Pollutants”\n\n     The 1990 CAA Amendments overhauled the Act’s\n“Hazardous Air Pollutants” provision, codified at 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412. Although earlier iterations of the Act had assigned\nHAPs-identification responsibility to the EPA, the slow pace\nat which the EPA discharged its duty prompted the Congress\nto create a list of pollutants itself.5 See Sierra Club I, 353\nF.3d at 979-80 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 7412(b)). After identifying\nnearly two hundred HAPs that warranted emissions\nrestrictions, see 42 U.S.C. § 7412(b)(1), the Congress directed\nthe EPA, first, to identify the sources of each HAP, see id.\n§ 7412(c). The Agency then was to set emissions limits for\neach source that result in HAPs reduction to the greatest\nextent achievable by current technology. See generally Nat’l\nAss’n for Surface Finishing v. EPA, 795 F.3d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir.\n2015) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 7412(b)(1), (c), (d)).\n\n        a. Identifying and Categorizing HAP Sources\n\n     The EPA’s first task is to create HAP-source categories\nand subcategories. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(c). The Act\ndistinguishes “major” from “area” sources, defining the\nformer as “any stationary source or group of stationary\nsources” that neighbor each other, share common control, and\nemit (or have the potential to emit) either ten tons per year or\nmore of any single HAP or twenty-five tons per year or more\n\n\n    5\n       The EPA must keep the HAPs list current. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(b)(2), (3).\n\f                                 6\n\nof any HAP combination.6 Id. § 7412(a)(1). The latter are\nsources that do not emit enough HAPs to qualify as “major.”\nId. § 7412(a)(2). Although the EPA must set stringent\nrestrictions on major sources, it has discretion to set more\nlenient emissions caps on area sources. See id. § 7412(d)(5).\n\n     Apart from the statutory distinction between major and\narea sources, the EPA has discretion to differentiate “among\nclasses, types, and sizes of sources within a category or\nsubcategory.” Id. § 7412(d)(1). Once the EPA finalizes\nHAPs-source categories and subcategories, the CAA\nmandates that it draw one final dividing line—between “new”\nsources and “existing” sources. See id. § 7412(d)(3). “New”\nsources are those “on which construction begins after EPA\npublishes emission standards,” Cement Kiln Recycling Coal.\nv. EPA, 255 F.3d 855, 858 (D.C. Cir. 2001); most of the\nothers are “existing” sources, see 42 U.S.C. § 7412(a)(10).\nBut if an existing source experiences either a physical change\nor a change in operation method and the change increases\nHAP emissions by more than a de minimis amount, the Act\nmandates that the source meet the standards set for new\nsources. See id. § 7412(a)(5), (g).\n\n    b. Setting Emission Standards for Major Sources—the\n                     “MACT” Standard\n\n    After the EPA identifies HAP-source categories and\nsubcategories, it then sets emissions limits for each. See id.\n§ 7412(d)(2). “[W]henever . . . feasible,” the caps must use\nnumeric HAPs limits. Id. § 7412(h)(4). The size of the\n\n    6\n         The CAA defines “stationary source” as “any building,\nstructure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air\npollutant.” 42 U.S.C. § 7411(a)(3).\n\f                               7\n\nsource—either “major” or “area”—dictates whether the EPA\nmust set the numeric limit at the most stringent level that\ncurrent technology allows or at the level set by “generally\navailable control technologies.” Id. § 7412(d)(5). For major\nsources, the CAA directs the EPA to establish emissions caps\nthat result in the “the maximum degree of reduction in\nemissions” that the EPA determines is “achievable.” Id.\n§ 7412(d)(2). We refer to an emissions cap that reflects the\ncurrent “maximum achievable control technology” as a\n“MACT” standard. See NRDC II, 529 F.3d at 1079. Setting a\nMACT standard is a two-step process.\n\n     First, the EPA establishes a “MACT floor” for each\ncategory or subcategory. Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 980. The\nMACT floor ensures that all HAPs sources “at least clean up\ntheir emissions to the level that their best performing peers\nhave shown can be achieved.” Id. For new sources—those\nbuilt after promulgation of a HAPs limit, see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(a)(4)—the MACT floor cannot be less stringent than\nthe emissions levels achieved by the best performing similar\nsource. Id. § 7412(d)(3). For existing sources in categories or\nsubcategories that have thirty or more sources, the MACT\nfloor cannot be less stringent than the average emissions\nlimits achieved by the best performing 12 per cent of existing\nsources in that category or subcategory. Id. § 7412(d)(3)(A).\nAnd for existing sources in categories or subcategories with\nfewer than thirty sources, the MACT floor cannot be less\nstringent than the average emissions achieved by the best\nperforming five sources. Id. § 7412(d)(3)(B). When setting\nthe MACT floor, the EPA considers only the performance of\nthe cleanest sources in a category or subcategory; it does not\ntake into account other factors, including the cost of putting a\nsource in line with its better-performing counterparts. See\nCement Kiln, 255 F.3d at 857-58 (citing Nat’l Lime Ass’n v.\n\f                               8\n\nEPA, 233 F.3d 625, 629 (D.C. Cir. 2000), as amended on\ndenial of reh’g, No. 99-1325 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 14, 2001)).\n\n     Second, the EPA must determine whether current\ntechnology makes it possible for a source to perform even\nbetter than the best performing similar source or sources. In\nother words, the CAA directs the EPA to consider whether it\nshould set a “beyond-the-floor” MACT standard. Nat’l Lime\nAss’n, 233 F.3d at 629. In determining whether a beyond-the-\nfloor standard is “achievable,” the Agency must consider\nadditional factors like “the cost of achieving such emission\nreduction,” “any non-air quality health and environmental\nimpacts” and “energy requirements.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2).\nIt has broad discretion in its determination. See id.; cf. Nat’l\nAss’n of Clean Water Agencies v. EPA (NACWA), 734 F.3d\n1115, 1157 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (noting, in section 7429 case,\nthat “Congress gave EPA broad discretion in considering\nwhether to go beyond-the-floor”).\n\n    c. Setting Emission Standards for Area Sources—the\n                     “GACT” Standard\n\n     Although the EPA must cap HAP emissions from major\nsources at the “maximum degree of reduction,” see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(d)(2), it has discretion to set less stringent caps on\nemissions from area sources. Indeed, the EPA need not list\ncategories of area sources at all unless: (A) it finds that the\nsources in that category or subcategory “present[] a threat of\nadverse effects” to the environment or human health, see id.\n§ 7412(c)(1), (3); or (B) control of a particular area source\ncategory or subcategory is necessary to ensure that sources\naccounting for at least 90 per cent of the aggregate emissions\nof the thirty HAPs the EPA believes “present the greatest\nthreat to public health in the largest number of urban areas”\n\f                              9\n\nare subject to CAA control, id. § 7412(c)(3), (k)(3)(B). If it\nfinds that controlling emissions from a particular area source\nsubcategory is necessary to achieve a 90 per cent reduction in\nthe aggregate emissions of any of seven CAA-enumerated\nHAPs, section 7412(c)(6) requires the Agency to impose\nMACT caps on that subcategory. See id. § 7412(c)(6).\n\n     With the exception of section 7412(c)(6)’s MACT-\nstandard requirement, the EPA need not cap emissions from\narea sources at the MACT level. Instead, it may set more\nlenient emissions limits based on “generally available control\ntechnologies.” Id. § 7412(d)(5). We refer to these caps as\nGACT standards. The Act provides no guidance for setting\nGACT standards but the legislative history of the 1990 CAA\nAmendments describes GACT “as methods, practices and\ntechniques [that] are commercially available and appropriate\nfor application by the sources in the category considering\neconomic impacts and the technical capabilities of the firms\nto operate and maintain the emissions control systems.” S.\nREP. NO. 101-228, at 171 (1989). According to the EPA, it\ncan and will consider the following in setting a GACT\nstandard:\n\n        “costs and economic impacts . . . , which\n         [are] particularly important when developing\n         regulations for source categories that may\n         have many small businesses . . . ”;\n\n         “the control technologies and management\n         practices that are generally available to the\n         area sources in the source category”;\n\n        “the standards applicable to major sources in\n         the analogous source category to determine if\n\f                              10\n\n         the control technologies and management\n         practices are transferable and generally\n         available to area sources”; and\n\n        “technologies and practices at area and major\n         sources in similar categories to determine\n         whether such technologies and practices\n         could be considered generally available for\n         the area source categories at issue.”\n\n2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,556. And, unlike\nthe EPA’s duty to consider a beyond-the-floor MACT\nstandard, it need not consider a more stringent GACT\nstandard.\n\n   d. Work-Practice and Management-Practice Standards\n\n     Although the CAA requires numeric emission standards\nwhere possible, the EPA can “promulgate a design,\nequipment, work practice, or operational standard, or\ncombination thereof” if it determines that a numeric limit is\n“not feasible.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(h)(1). In other words, the\nEPA can require that all sources in a given category or\nsubcategory take a certain action (e.g., conduct a periodic\ntune-up) or install certain emissions-control technology (e.g.,\ninstall a fabric filter). Although the EPA has discretion to\nimpose a work-practice standard, the Act limits it by defining\nthe operative phrase “not feasible” narrowly to mean:\n\n   (A) a hazardous air pollutant or pollutants cannot\n       be emitted through a conveyance designed\n       and constructed to emit or capture such\n       pollutant, or that any requirement for, or use\n       of, such a conveyance would be inconsistent\n       with any Federal, State or local law, or\n\f                              11\n\n   (B) the application of measurement methodology\n       to a particular class of sources is not\n       practicable due to technological and\n       economic limitations.\n\nId. § 7412(h)(2).\n\n     Similarly, for area sources, the EPA can impose a\n“management-practice standard” in lieu of a numeric GACT\nstandard. See id. § 7412(d)(5). A management-practice\nGACT standard is like a work-practice MACT standard in all\nways but one—the EPA need not consider feasibility when\nsetting management-practice standards.       Compare id.\n§ 7412(d)(2), with id. § 7412(d)(5).\n\n     2. 42 U.S.C. § 7429—“Solid Waste Combustion”\n\n     In addition to amending the Act’s “Hazardous Air\nPollutants” provision, see id. § 7412, the 1990 CAA\nAmendments added to the U.S. Code section 7429, titled\n“Solid Waste Combustion.” Section 7429 regulates “solid\nwaste incineration units” generally, see id. § 7429(a)(1)(A),\nand CISWI specifically, see id. § 7429(a)(1)(D). Although\nsection 7412 requires the EPA to control emissions of nearly\ntwo hundred HAPs, see id. § 7412(d)(1), section 7429\nmandates that the EPA control emissions from only nine\nspecific pollutants (as well as opacity, where appropriate),\nnone of which the Congress included on its initial section\n7412 list, see id. § 7429(a)(4); see also Nat. Res. Def. Council\nv. EPA (NRDC I), 489 F.3d 1250, 1256 (D.C. Cir. 2007). We\nhave       held       that     this      difference      “makes\npromulgating . . . standards under [section 7412] and [section\n7429] mutually exclusive.” NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1119. In\nother words, if a source (or facility) is considered a CISWI\n\f                             12\n\nand, therefore, regulated under section 7429, it cannot be\nregulated under section 7412. See id.\n\n     Whether a source falls under section 7412 or section\n7429, “the statutory directive on setting MACT standards is\nvirtually identical.” Id.; see also Nat’l Lime Ass’n, 233 F.3d\nat 631. That said, regulation under one section instead of the\nother “has practical consequences.” NACWA, 734 F.3d at\n1120. For example, section 7412 allows the EPA to impose a\nGACT standard for area sources only but section 7429\nrequires the EPA to impose MACT standards for all covered\nunits, regardless of their size.         Compare 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(d)(1), (5), with id. § 7429(a)(1)(A); see also NRDC I,\n489 F.3d at 1256. Moreover, section 7412 mandates that the\nEPA control HAP emissions from “major source[s],” which\nthe Act defines broadly to include “group[s] of stationary\nsources located within a contiguous area and under common\ncontrol.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(a)(1) (emphasis added). Section\n7429, in contrast, mandates that the EPA control emissions\nfrom “solid waste incineration unit[s],” which the Act defines\nmore narrowly as “a distinct operating unit of any facility\nwhich combusts any solid waste material,” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7429(g)(1) (emphases added). And finally, section 7429\ndoes not provide for work-practice standards.\n\n      3. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7661 et seq.—“Title V Permits”\n\n     Finally, the 1990 CAA Amendments added a provision to\nTitle V of the Act that requires all owners and operators of\nHAP sources to obtain operating permits. See id. § 7661a.\nTitle V does no more than consolidate “existing air pollution\nrequirements into a single document, the Title V permit, to\nfacilitate compliance monitoring” without imposing any new\nsubstantive requirements. Sierra Club v. Leavitt, 368 F.3d\n\f                              13\n\n1300, 1302 (11th Cir. 2004). The legislative history of the\n1990 CAA Amendments indicates that the Congress required\nthe “Title V permits” so that the public might “better\ndetermine the requirements to which the source is subject, and\nwhether the source is meeting those requirements.” S. REP.\nNO. 101-228, at 347. Although owners and operators of all\nmajor HAP sources must obtain Title V permits, see generally\n42 U.S.C. § 7661a(a), the EPA has discretion to exempt\ncertain area source categories if it “finds that compliance with\nsuch requirements is impracticable, infeasible, or\nunnecessarily burdensome,” id.\n\n         B. THE MAJOR BOILERS, AREA BOILERS,\n                  AND CISWI RULES\n\n     On March 21, 2011, the EPA issued the first iteration of\nall three rules under review. That same day, however, the\nEPA announced that it intended to reconsider certain aspects\nof each rule. Not long after, multiple parties filed the\npetitions for review that we now address. Earlier, the EPA\nhad concluded its reconsideration and issued the most recent\niteration of the three rules. Because of this procedural quirk,\neach “rule” we address is in fact two separate rules—the\nEPA’s “final” 2011 version and its “final” 2013 version. The\nEPA’s analyses remained mostly consistent from 2011 to\n2013 and we indicate, where necessary, the instances in which\nthe EPA changed course in a significant way.\n\n                 1. The Major Boilers Rule\n\n     The Major Boilers Rule sets HAPs emission caps for all\nindustrial, commercial, and institutional boilers that emit a\nlarge volume of HAPs. See 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,611. The EPA further divided the major boiler\ncategories into subcategories based on the primary fuel\n\f                              14\n\ncombusted by the boilers in the subcategory (e.g., coal,\nbiomass, gas, etc.) and, for some subcategories, based on the\nmethod used to “feed” the fuel into the boiler. See 2013\nMajor Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,144. For most of the\nsubcategories, the EPA set a numeric MACT standard for four\ndifferent HAPs: particulate matter (PM); hydrogen chloride\n(HCl); mercury (Hg); and carbon monoxide (CO). See id. at\n7,142 tbl.3; No. 11-1108 EPA Br. 9. The EPA used some of\nthese HAPs—particularly CO—as a surrogate (or proxy) to\nset emissions limits for others on the section 7412(b) HAPs\nlist. See 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,144-45.\nFor the other major boiler subcategories, the EPA set a work-\npractice standard (specifically, a tune-up requirement) in lieu\nof numeric MACT standards. See 2011 Major Boilers Rule,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613.7 The EPA also established a tune-up\nwork-practice standard to control for dioxin/furan emissions\nacross all major boiler subcategories. 2013 Major Boilers\nRule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,138.\n\n     In addition to these emission standards, the Major Boilers\nRule includes several other provisions relevant to the current\npetitions for review.\n\n              a. The “Upper Prediction Limit”\n\n     Several factors complicate the process of setting MACT\nfloors. The first is the CAA itself, which mandates that all\nMACT floors (1) must be achievable, see 42 U.S.C.\n    7\n         The four major boiler subcategories for which the EPA\nestablished work-practice standards include “[n]ew and existing\nunits that have a designed heat input capacity of less than 10\nMMBtu/hr, and new and existing units in the Gas 1 (natural\ngas/refinery gas) subcategory and in the metal process furnaces\nsubcategory.” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613.\n\f                               15\n\n§ 7412(d)(2); (2) must ensure continuous regulation of the\ncovered sources, see id. § 7602(k); and (3) must be no less\nstringent than the emissions levels being achieved by the best-\ncontrolled sources, see id. § 7412(d)(3). The second is that no\nsource emits any HAP at a constant level; rather, HAP\nemissions fluctuate over time and for many reasons,\nincluding, e.g., “operation of control technologies, variation in\ncombustion materials and combustion conditions, variation in\noperation of the unit itself, and variation associated with the\nemission measurement techniques.” Memorandum from\nStephen D. Page, EPA Director of Air Quality Planning and\nStandards, EPA’s Response to Remand of the Record for\nCommercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units\n(Page Mem.) (July 14, 2014), at 3 (No. 11-1125 J.A. 1316).\nFinally, most sources do not measure their HAP emissions at\nall times and under all conditions.8 Id. at 6. Instead, data are\nusually gathered when a source conducts a “three-run stack\ntest.” Id. This test provides three “snapshots” of a source’s\nemissions in a limited set of conditions and, accordingly, it\nfails to demonstrate accurately a source’s emissions during all\ntimes and under all conditions. Id.\n\n     To compensate for the lack of adequate emissions data,\nthe EPA uses a statistical tool known as the “upper prediction\nlimit” (UPL) to account for the expected variability in\nemissions levels. See 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 15,630. The UPL, in turn, allows the Agency to set a\nMACT floor that is continuously achievable. Id. We discuss\nthe UPL mechanics at greater length below, see infra § IV.C,\nbut, in short, the EPA: (1) ranks all sources in a given\n\n    8\n      As discussed below, however, the EPA does allow sources\nto demonstrate MACT compliance by use of “continuous\nmonitors.” See infra § IV.I.\n\f                              16\n\ncategory based on their three-run stack-test data;\n(2) determines the HAP emissions level of the “best\ncontrolled similar source” to establish standards for new\nsources, 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(3), and determines the average\nHAP emissions levels of the best performing 12 per cent of\nsources to establish standards for existing sources, id.\n§ 7412(d)(3)(A); and then (3) applies the UPL methodology\nto provide the cushion necessary to account for the expected\npeaks and valleys in HAP emissions not reflected in the three-\nrun stack-test “snapshots.” See Page Mem. 4, 6.\n\n         b. The “Pollutant-By-Pollutant” Approach\n\n     In identifying the best performing sources in a given\ncategory, often the EPA could not identify a single source that\ncontrolled all HAPs better than all other sources. Instead, the\nEPA found that one source effectively controlled emissions\nfrom one HAP but was nonetheless one of the worst-\nperforming sources at controlling emissions from a different\nHAP. For this reason, the EPA adopted a “pollutant-by-\npollutant” approach in setting MACT floors for major boiler\nsubcategories. See 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,622-23. That is, instead of identifying the one source that,\non balance, best controlled all HAPs in the aggregate, the\nEPA used one source to set the MACT floor for, e.g., PM, and\nused a different source to set the MACT floor for, e.g., HCl.\nFor at least two subcategories of major boilers—new heavy\noil-fired units and existing stoker coal-fired units—the EPA’s\npollutant-by-pollutant approach resulted in MACT floors that\nno source had achieved in toto.\n\n          c. Startups, Shutdowns, and Malfunctions\n\n   The EPA found it difficult to account for HAP emissions\nwhen sources start up, shut down, and malfunction. All three\n\f                              17\n\noccurrences alter HAP emissions and, historically, the EPA\nexempted sources from normal numeric MACT-standard\ncompliance when these events occurred. See, e.g., Standards\nof Performance for New Stationary Sources, 42 Fed. Reg.\n57,125 (Nov. 1, 1977). Nevertheless, concluding that the Act\n“require[s] that there must be continuous section [7412]-\ncompliant standards” and observing that the exemption meant\nthat “no section [7412] standard governs these events,” in\n2008 we vacated the exemption for startups, shutdowns, and\nmalfunctions when the issue arose in a case challenging a\ndifferent rule. Sierra Club v. EPA (Sierra Club III), 551 F.3d\n1019, 1027-28 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (emphasis added).\n\n     In response to the Sierra Club III vacatur, the EPA\nestablished a work-practice standard in lieu of a numeric\nMACT standard during startup and shutdown periods (but not\nduring malfunctions) when it promulgated the Major Boilers\nRule. See 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613.9\nIt did so after determining that the “physical limitations and\nthe short duration of startup and shutdown periods” made it\ntechnologically infeasible to conduct the requisite testing for\nnumeric emissions limits. Id. A work-practice standard\nsufficed, in the EPA’s view, because “[p]eriods of startup,\nnormal operations, and shutdown are all predictable and\nroutine aspects of a source’s operations.” Id.\n    9\n        Specifically, the startup and shutdown work-practice\nstandard requires a source to follow “the manufacturer’s\nrecommended procedures for minimizing periods of startup and\nshutdown.” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613. “If\nmanufacturer’s recommended procedures are not available,” the\nMajor Boilers Rule provided that “sources must follow\nrecommended procedures for a unit of similar design for which\nmanufacturer’s recommended procedures are available.” Id. at\n15,642.\n\f                              18\n\n     But because a malfunction is “sudden, infrequent, and not\nreasonably preventable,” id. (quoting 40 C.F.R. § 63.2), the\nEPA declined to treat a malfunction as a “distinct operating\nmode,” id. As a result, the EPA did not account for\nmalfunctions when it set the MACT floors and it required\nsources to comply with all MACT floors even during periods\nof malfunction. Id. At the same time and recognizing that\neven the best equipment can fail and that such failure can\nspike emissions, the EPA added to the Major Boilers Rule “an\naffirmative defense to civil penalties for exceedances of\nnumerical emission limits that are caused by malfunctions.”\nId. In reviewing a challenge to a different EPA rule, however,\nwe vacated a materially identical affirmative-defense\nprovision and held that the EPA has no power under the CAA\nto create a defense to civil liability. See Natural Res. Def.\nCouncil v. EPA (NRDC III), 749 F.3d 1055, 1062-64 (D.C.\nCir. 2014). Here, the EPA defends its decision not to address\nmalfunctions by asserting that it will use its enforcement\ndiscretion regarding malfunctions on a case-by-case basis.\n\n            d. The One-Time Energy Assessment\n\n     The EPA also promulgated a “beyond-the-floor”\nrequirement for all facilities with existing major boilers. See\n2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613.\nSpecifically, the Major Boilers Rule mandates a “a one-time\nenergy assessment . . . on the affected boilers and facility to\nidentify any cost-effective energy conservation measures,”\nid., which assessment includes, inter alia, a review of fuel\nusage, energy management practices, and conservation\nmeasures, see 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at\n7,198-99. In some respects, the energy assessment is limited:\nit (1) need occur only one time, see 40 C.F.R pt. 63, subpt.\nDDDDD tbl.3; (2) is “based on energy use by discrete\n\f                               19\n\nsegments of a facility and not by a total aggregation of all\nindividual energy using elements of a facility,” 2013 Major\nBoilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,146; and (3) does not require\nan owner or operator to implement any of the energy-saving\nfindings the assessment makes. In one respect, however, it is\nexpansive—it requires owners and operators to assess not\nonly the boilers themselves but also other components\n“located on the site of the affected boiler that use energy\nprovided by the boiler,” including “compressed air systems”\nas well as “facility heating, ventilation, and air conditioning\nsystems.” 40 C.F.R. § 63.11237.\n\n       e. The Health-Based Emissions Limits for HCl\n\n     Although the EPA set numeric MACT standards to\ncontrol HCl emissions, see 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 7,193-98 tbls.1 & 2, in an earlier iteration of the Major\nBoilers Rule, the EPA did not set MACT standards for HCl.\nSee National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air\nPollutants for Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional\nBoilers and Process Heaters (2004 Boilers Rule), 69 Fed. Reg.\n55,218, 55,227 (Sept. 13, 2004). Instead, the Agency opted\nfor a less stringent health-based emissions limit under section\n7412(d)(4).      See id.    The EPA changed course after\nconcluding that HCl emissions posed health concerns the\nAgency had not previously considered—in particular, the\nEPA feared the “potential cumulative public health and\nenvironmental effects” of HCl emissions, 2011 Major Boilers\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,643-44 (emphasis added)—and after\nrecognizing that it did not have the requisite data to weigh\nadequately the newly identified health risks.\n\f                               20\n\n                  2. The Area Boilers Rule\n\n     In the Area Boilers Rule, the EPA set emissions limits for\nthe same three boiler categories it controlled in the Major\nBoilers Rule, see supra § I.B.1: industrial, commercial, and\ninstitutional boilers. See 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg.\nat 7,488.      It further split the categories into seven\nsubcategories, see id., and set emissions limits for three of\nthem, see id. at 7,517-18 tbls.1 & 2.10 These include:\n(1) coal-fired boilers (i.e., “any boiler that burns any solid\nfossil fuel and no more than 15 percent biomass,” 40 C.F.R.\n§ 63.11237); (2) oil-fired boilers (i.e., “any boiler that burns\nany liquid fuel and is not in either the biomass or coal\nsubcategories,” id.); and (3) biomass-fired boilers (i.e., “any\nboiler that burns any” “biomass-based solid fuel that is not a\nsolid waste” and “is not in the coal subcategory,” id.). See\n2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,517-18 tbls.1 & 2.\n\n     For these subcategories, the EPA set emissions limits for\nthree HAPs: Hg, PM, and CO, with PM functioning as a\nsurrogate for non-Hg urban metals and CO functioning as a\nsurrogate for polycyclic organic matter (POM). See 2011\nArea Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,586. Because Hg and\nPOM are both listed in section 7412(c)(6), the EPA had to set\nMACT standards for Hg and for CO (as surrogate for POM)\nfor any area source category that, in the EPA’s view, required\n    10\n         As noted above, see supra § I.A.1.a, the EPA has some\ndiscretion in promulgating emissions limits for area HAP sources.\nExercising its discretion, the EPA had previously determined that\nnatural gas-fired area boilers did not emit HAPs at a level\nnecessitating regulation. See National Emission Standards for\nHazardous Air Pollutants for Area Sources: Industrial, Commercial,\nand Institutional Boilers (2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule), 75\nFed. Reg. 31,896, 31,900 (June 4, 2010).\n\f                                21\n\nMACT control to assure a 90 per cent reduction in the\naggregate emissions of these two HAPs. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(c)(6). The Agency complied, setting numeric MACT\nstandards for Hg and CO emissions from large coal-fired\nboilers and a MACT work-practice standard (specifically, a\ntune-up requirement) for emissions from small coal-fired\nboilers. See 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,488,\n7,517-18.11 It did not, however, set MACT standards for Hg\nand POM emissions from biomass or oil-fired boilers, finding\nit unnecessary to assure a 90 per cent reduction in aggregate\nemissions of those two HAPs. See 2011 Area Boilers Rule,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 15,566.\n\n     Thus, with the exception of Hg and CO emissions from\ncoal-fired boilers, the EPA had discretion to promulgate\nGACT standards for all other HAPs in all other source\nsubcategories. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(5). Exercising this\ndiscretion resulted in the following standards:\n\n\n\n\n    11\n        As used in the Area Boilers Rule, the difference between\n“large” and “small” units depends on the heat-input capacity of the\nunit. See 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,488. It is not\nthe same as the difference between “major” and “area” sources,\nwhich is based on the volume of HAPs a source emits.

Reg. at 7,488-89, 7,517-19.\n\n     The Area Boilers Rule shares many of the same features\nas the Major Boilers Rule; for example, the Area Boilers Rule\ntreats startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions in the same\nfashion as the Major Boilers Rule, see supra § I.B.1.c—i.e.,\nthe Area Boilers Rule creates work-practice (or management-\npractice) standards for startup and shutdown periods but does\nnot account for malfunctions at all, save for the Agency’s\ncommitment to consider malfunctions on a case-by-case basis.\nSee 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,496; 2011 Area\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,560-61. Additionally, the\nArea Boilers Rule imposes the same one-time energy-\nassessment requirement for existing large area boilers that the\nMajor Boilers Rule imposes for existing major boilers. See\nsupra § I.B.1.d; see also 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 7,500; 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n\f                              24\n\n15,560, 15,567-68. There are, however, two unique features\nof the Area Boilers Rule that warrant brief discussion.\n\n            a. Exclusion of “Temporary Boilers”\n\n     After the EPA promulgated the 2011 Area Boilers Rule\nbut before it promulgated the 2013 version, it proposed an\namendment to 40 C.F.R. § 63.11195 that added temporary\nboilers to the list of those boilers not regulated by\nsection 7412.     See National Emission Standards for\nHazardous Air Pollutants for Area Sources: Industrial,\nCommercial, and Institutional Boilers (2011 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule on Reconsideration), 76 Fed. Reg. 80,532,\n80,535 (Dec. 23, 2011). The EPA created the exclusion\nbecause, in its view, temporary boilers are “insignificant\nsources[] and were not included in the EPA’s analysis of the\nsource category.” Id. The Agency eventually defined\n“temporary boiler” as “any gaseous or liquid fuel boiler that is\ndesigned to, and is capable of, being carried or moved from\none location to another by means of, for example, wheels,\nskids, carrying handles, dollies, trailers, or platforms.” See\n2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,491 (quoting 40\nC.F.R. § 63.11237).\n\n  b. Title V Permit Exemption for Synthetic Area Sources\n\n     As noted, see supra § I.A.3, Title V of the CAA imposes\na permit requirement on all owners and operators of major\nand area HAP sources. See 42 U.S.C. § 7661a. The EPA,\nhowever, can exempt an area source subcategory if it finds\n“that compliance with such requirements is impracticable,\ninfeasible, or unnecessarily burdensome on such categories.”\nId. § 7661a(a). When it proposed the Area Boilers Rule in\n2010, the EPA considered exempting some area sources\nbecause, in its view, the existing restrictions on those sources\n\f                               25\n\nmade Title V duplicative. See 2010 Proposed Area Boilers\nRule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,910-13. At the time, the EPA\nannounced that it did not intend to exempt “synthetic” area\nsources (i.e., area sources that, but for existing air-pollution\ncontrols, would be considered major sources). Id. at 31,913.\nIn so doing, the EPA reasoned that synthetic area sources:\n(1) more closely resemble major sources than area sources,\n(2) are often located in populous areas, and (3) have high\nHAP emissions potential when uncontrolled. Id.\n\n     But in the 2011 Area Boilers Rule, the EPA changed\ncourse and exempted synthetic area sources from the Title V\npermitting requirement. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,578. It\nreasoned that the “observations and data . . . relied upon in\nother rulemakings for distinguishing between sources that\nbecame synthetic area sources due to controls and other\nsynthetic and natural area sources did not necessarily apply to\nthis source category.” Id. In its view, it no longer had\n“sufficient information” to distinguish synthetic area sources\nfrom the others it exempted and, accordingly, “the rationale\nfor exempting most area sources subject to this rule . . . is also\nnow relevant for” synthetic area sources. Id.; see also 2013\nArea Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,497.\n\n                     3. The CISWI Rule\n\n      In the CISWI Rule, the EPA created four CISWI\nsubcategories: (1) incinerators (i.e., “units designed to burn\n[solid] waste materials for the purpose of disposal”);\n(2) small, remote incinerators (“SRIs”) (i.e., units that burn\nsmall waste batches); (3) energy recovery units (“ERUs”)\n(i.e., units that would be classified as boilers but for the fact\nthey combust solid waste); and (4) waste-burning kilns (i.e.,\nunits that would be classified as cement kilns if they did not\n\f                               26\n\nburn solid waste). 2013 CISWI Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 9,118.\nInitially, the EPA proposed a fifth subcategory—burn-off\novens—but eliminated burn-off ovens after comments\nrevealed that it had greatly underestimated the number of\nunits in that subcategory (36 versus 15,000) and that it lacked\nthe requisite data to set limits for the units. See 2011 CISWI\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,734.             Of the four CISWI\nsubcategories, the EPA further divided the ERU subcategory\n(for CO emissions only) into coal-fired, biomass-fired and\noil/gas-fired ERUs and it further divided the waste-burning\nkiln subcategory (again, for CO emissions only) into long and\npreheater/precalcinator kilns. See 2013 CISWI Rule, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 9,118 tbl.2.\n\n     The EPA then set numeric MACT limits for the section\n7429(a)(4) pollutants.12 See 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 15,709-10 tbl.1. Unlike the Major Boilers Rule and the\nArea Boilers Rule, the CISWI Rule contains no beyond-the-\nfloor MACT standards. The EPA also declined to promulgate\nwork-practice standards, concluding that it had no authority to\ndo so because section 7429 includes no work-practice\nstandard provision similar to that in section 7412. See id. at\n15,721.\n\n     The CISWI Rule shares several features with the Major\nBoilers Rule. In the CISWI Rule, for instance, the EPA also\nused the UPL, see id. at 15,722-27, as well as the pollutant-\nby-pollutant approach, see id. at 15,719-21, in setting MACT\nfloors. Based in part on the differences between section 7412\n\n    12\n         These pollutants are (1) PM, (2) sulfur dioxide (SO2),\n(3) HCl, (4) nitrogen oxide (NOx), (5) CO, (6) lead (Pb),\n(7) cadmium (Cd), (8) Hg, (9) dioxins and dibenzofurans, and (10)\nopacity (where appropriate). 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(4).\n\f                             27\n\nand section 7429, the CISWI rule has four unique\ncharacteristics we briefly describe.\n\n         a. Startups, Shutdowns, and Malfunctions\n\n     As discussed, see supra § II.B.1.c, the EPA imposed a\nwork-practice standard for major and area source boilers\nduring periods of startup and shutdown but declined to make\nany regulatory modification for malfunctions. See 2011\nMajor Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613; 2011 Area\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,560-61. The CISWI Rule,\nhowever, makes no modification for any of these periods,\nmandating instead that the numeric MACT standards “apply\nat all times,” even when CISWI units are starting up or\nshutting down. 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,711,\n15,737-38. The Agency concluded that it had no legal\nauthority under section 7429 to impose anything but a\nnumeric MACT standard on CISWI units. See id. at 15,709\ntbl.1; see also id. at 15,737-38.\n\n            b. The Record-Keeping Requirement\n\n     Whether the EPA considers a combustion unit to be a\nboiler (and thus subject to section 7412) or a CISWI (and thus\nsubject to section 7429) turns entirely on whether the unit\ncombusts “solid waste.” See id. at 15,709. The term “solid\nwaste” is defined in RCRA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6901 et seq., and\nclarified by EPA regulation, see Identification of Non-\nHazardous Secondary Materials that Are Solid Waste (NHSM\nRule), 76 Fed. Reg. 15,456, 15,457 (Mar. 21, 2011). See also\n2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,709. If the unit\ncombusts solid waste, it is a CISWI. Id.\n\n    The source owner or operator initially decides whether\nthe material its combustion unit burns meets the definition of\n\f                              28\n\nsolid waste. See id. at 15,740. For this reason, the CISWI\nrule requires that the owner or operator of a combustion unit\nthat burns materials “not clearly listed as traditional fuels”\nkeep records explaining how the materials meet the regulatory\ndefinition of “non-solid waste.” Id.; see also 40 C.F.R.\n§ 60.2175(v). Failure to do so means, for the purposes of the\nEPA, that “the operating unit is a CISWI unit.” 40 C.F.R.\n§ 60.2265; see also 2013 CISWI Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 9,188.\n\n                   c. Emissions Averaging\n\n     During the notice-and-comment period, certain industry\nentities urged the EPA to allow a facility containing more\nthan one CISWI unit to demonstrate compliance with the\nCISWI MACT standards by averaging the HAP emissions of\nall units in the facility. See Commercial and Industrial Solid\nWaste Incineration Units: Reconsideration and Proposed\nAmendments; Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials that Are\nSolid Waste (2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on\nReconsideration), 76 Fed. Reg. 80,452, 80,463 (Dec. 23,\n2011). Although it allowed facility-wide averaging in the\nMajor Boilers Rule, the Agency declined to allow it for\nfacilities with CISWI units. See id. The EPA explained, first,\nthat “[t]he applicability of CISWI is such that each unit is an\naffected facility.” Id. In response to further comments, the\nEPA subsequently explained that it did “not believe [it had]\nthe legal authority to allow emissions averaging in CISWI or\nunder section [7429] generally because each individual unit is\nan affected facility.” Summary of Public Comments and\nResponses for Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste\nIncineration Units (CISWI Rule—Responses to Comments),\nEPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0119-2638-A2 (Dec. 2012), at 195.\n\f                             29\n\n d. Treatment of Units that Begin Combusting Solid Waste\n\n     Finally, in the preamble to the 2011 CISWI Rule, the\nEPA stated broadly that “[u]nits that begin combusting solid\nwaste are considered existing sources under CISWI.” 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,714 (emphasis added).            This categorical\npronouncement drew objections from commentators who\ninsisted that, if such units experienced an increase in HAP\nemissions, the units would meet the statutory definition of\n“modified solid waste incineration unit[s],” see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7429(g)(3), and would, accordingly, be subject to the\nMACT standards for new units, see id. § 7429(g)(2). In the\nsubsequent proposed CISWI Rule, the EPA clarified that\n“[a]n existing source will not be considered a new source\nsolely due to a combustion material switch. Assuming new\nsource applicability is not triggered, existing sources that\nchange fuels or materials are considered existing\nsources . . . .”     2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on\nReconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,459.\n\n              II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     For each issue, the Petitioners argue that the EPA either\nmisinterpreted the CAA, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, or\nboth. We review the EPA’s construction of the statute under\nthe two-part framework established in Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). At\nChevron step 1, we ask whether the Congress “has directly\nspoken to the precise question at issue”; if it has, we “must\ngive effect to [its] unambiguously expressed intent.” Id. at\n842-43. In so doing, we examine the CAA’s text, structure,\npurpose, and legislative history to determine if the Congress\nhas expressed its intent unambiguously. See Bell Atl. Tel. Co.\nv. FCC, 131 F.3d 1044, 1047 (D.C. Cir. 1997). If the statute\n\f                              30\n\nis “silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,” we\nproceed to Chevron step 2 and defer to the EPA’s\ninterpretation so long as it is “based on a permissible\nconstruction of the statute.” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43.\n\n     The CAA authorizes the Court to “reverse any [EPA]\naction found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 42\nU.S.C. § 7607(d)(9)(A). Our review is “narrow” and we will\n“not . . . substitute [our] judgment for that of the\nagency.” Motor Veh. Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto.\nIns. Co. (State Farm), 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). We “must\nuphold an agency’s action where [the agency] ‘has considered\nthe relevant factors and articulated a rational connection\nbetween the facts found and the choice made,’ and has not\n‘relied on [improper] factors.’” Nat’l Ass’n of Clean Air\nAgencies v. EPA (NACAA), 489 F.3d 1221, 1228 (D.C. Cir.\n2007) (citations omitted) (quoting Allied Local & Reg’l Mfrs.\nCaucus v. EPA, 215 F.3d 61, 68 (D.C. Cir. 2000), and State\nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43). A rule is arbitrary and capricious if\nthe agency: (1) “has relied on factors which Congress has not\nintended it to consider,” (2) “entirely failed to consider an\nimportant aspect of the problem,” (3) “offered an explanation\nfor its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the\nagency,” or (4) “is so implausible that it could not be ascribed\nto a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”\nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.\n\n     We review the EPA’s factual determinations for\nsubstantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(E). We also “owe[]\nparticular deference to EPA when its rulemakings rest upon\nmatters of scientific and statistical judgment within [its]\nsphere of special competence and statutory jurisdiction.” Am.\nCoke & Coal Chems. Inst. v. EPA, 452 F.3d 930, 941 (D.C.\n\f                              31\n\nCir. 2006). But “[w]e are hesitant to rubber-stamp EPA’s\ninvocation of statistics without some explanation of the\nunderlying principles or reasons why its formulas would\nproduce an accurate result.” NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1145.\n\n    III. INDUSTRY PETITIONERS’ CHALLENGES\n\n     A. STARTUPS, SHUTDOWNS, AND MALFUNCTIONS\n\n     Industry Petitioners raise two sets of challenges to\nstartup, shutdown, and malfunction periods: (1) a challenge to\nthe EPA’s failure to take malfunctions into account in the\nMajor Boilers and Area Boilers Rules and (2) a challenge to\nEPA’s failure to take into account periods of startup,\nshutdown, and malfunction in the CISWI Rule. For the\nreasons that follow, we reject all of the Industry Petitioners’\nclaims related to startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions.\n\n 1. Periods of Malfunction in the Major Boilers and Area\n                      Boilers Rules\n\n     First, Industry Petitioners challenge the Major Boilers\nand Area Boilers Rules’ failure to take malfunctions into\naccount in setting MACT floors. See 2011 Major Boilers\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613; 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,560-61. The EPA defends its refusal to account for\nmalfunctions on the basis of (1) the impracticability of\naccounting for events that are necessarily unpredictable, and\n(2) the EPA’s assertion that it will use its prosecutorial\ndiscretion to determine on a case-by-case basis whether an\nexceedance of emission standards is attributable to an\nexcusable malfunction or whether applicable regulatory\npenalties should be imposed instead. See No. 11-1108 EPA\nBr. 38; No. 11-1141 EPA Br. 29.\n\f                              32\n\n     Both sides agree that malfunctions are inevitable in the\noperation of area and major boilers. According to the EPA,\n“even equipment that is properly designed and maintained can\nsometimes fail and . . . such failure can sometimes cause an\nexceedance of the relevant emission standard.” 2011 Major\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613; 2011 Area Boilers Rule,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 15,561. Thus, the EPA defined a malfunction\nas a “sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable\nfailure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment,\nprocess equipment or a process to operate in a normal or usual\nmanner.” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613\n(citing 40 C.F.R. § 63.2); 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,560 (same). In attempting to write rules to account\nfor emissions, however, the EPA faced an intractable\nproblem: how to account for a malfunction which is, by\ndefinition, unpredictable in terms of timing, duration,\nmagnitude, and effect. While the existence of malfunctions is\nentirely predictable, the nature of those malfunctions is not,\nand it is the malfunction’s nature that affects emissions and\nthus is relevant to the application of emission limits.\n\n     At first glance, the EPA’s chosen approach to\nmalfunctions may seem counterintuitive, as the Agency\nappears to have several reasonable alternatives: it could\nexempt periods of malfunction entirely from the application\nof the emission standards; or it could apply the standards to\nmalfunctions while giving boiler owners the opportunity to\ndefend against a penalty by demonstrating they were not at\nfault for the malfunction. But the EPA has previously been\nstymied in its attempts to implement either of these solutions,\nas this court has concluded neither approach is consistent with\nthe Agency’s enabling statutes. For instance, in Sierra Club\nIII, the EPA attempted to exempt major sources from\ncomplying with emission standards during start up, shut\n\f                               33\n\ndown, and malfunction. See 551 F.3d at 1027-28. This court\nrejected that approach because the Congress “required that\nthere must be continuous section 112-compliant standards”\nand so the EPA lacked discretion to exempt certain periods\nfrom compliance, regardless of their unpredictability. Id. at\n1027. In NRDC III, this court considered a challenge to the\naffirmative defense provision the EPA adopted for persons\ndefending against civil suits under 42 U.S.C. § 7604(a), which\nallows “any person” to “commence a civil action on his own\nbehalf” against any entity alleged to be in violation of an\nemission standard or limitation. The affirmative defense\nprovision was meant to shield alleged violators from liability\nfor certain emissions violations caused by “unavoidable”\nmalfunctions; under the provision, therefore, “the district\ncourt [could] assess penalties only if violators fail[ed] to meet\n[their] burden of proving all of the requirements in the\naffirmative defense.” NRDC III, 749 F.3d at 1062 (internal\nquotation omitted). The court rejected this provision as an\nimpermissible intrusion on the judiciary’s role. See id. at\n1063 (“[U]nder this statute, deciding whether penalties are\n‘appropriate’ in a given private civil suit is a job for the\ncourts, not for EPA.”).\n\n     Faced with an obvious dilemma, the EPA arrived at the\napproach it defends today. Malfunctions receive no special\ntreatment and the EPA instead exercises “its enforcement\ndiscretion to address exceedances of emission limits that may\nbe caused by such uncertain, unpredictable events, on a case-\nby-case basis.” No. 11-1108 EPA Br. 38; see also No. 11-\n1141 EPA Br. 29.          The EPA’s current treatment of\nmalfunctions thus differs from its invalid affirmative defense\nprovision because the Agency is exercising its own regulatory\nenforcement power on an ad hoc basis outside the context of\ncitizen suits.    When an exceedance occurs during a\n\f                              34\n\nmalfunction, the EPA determines what enforcement action—\nif any—it should take by considering “the good faith efforts\nof the source to minimize emissions during malfunction\nperiods, including preventative and corrective actions, as well\nas root cause analyses to ascertain and rectify excess\nemissions.” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613;\nsee also 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,561\n(same). The EPA also considers whether the exceedance was\nin fact “not reasonably preventable” or whether it was\n“caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation.”\n2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613 (citing 40\nC.F.R. § 63.2); see also 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 15,561 (same).\n\n     For our purposes, we need not (indeed, must not)\nevaluate the policy implications of the EPA’s regulatory\nchoice because our review is confined to determining whether\nthe EPA’s regulation reflects a permissible reading of the\napplicable statute under Chevron. Here, we conclude that it\ndoes. The relevant statute requires only that the EPA set\n“achievable” standards, 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2), and it defines\nachievability to be no less “than the emission control that is\nachieved in practice by the best controlled similar source,” 42\nU.S.C. § 7412(d)(3). The “best controlled similar source,”\nhowever, is unlikely to be a malfunctioning source, and the\nEPA is bound to enact a standard in keeping with emission\nlimits achieved by that “best controlled similar source.” If\nanything, then, the statutory language on its face prevents the\nEPA from taking into account the effect of potential\nmalfunctions when setting MACT emission standards. At the\nvery least, the language permits the EPA to ignore\nmalfunctions in its standard-setting and account for them\ninstead through its regulatory discretion. Our Sierra Club III\ndecision confirms this. See 551 F.3d at 1027-28. Because the\n\f                              35\n\nEPA had no option to exclude these unpredictable periods, its\napproach is reasonable.       We therefore reject Industry\nPetitioners’ argument that the EPA either misinterpreted the\nCAA or acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to account\nfor malfunctions when setting MACT floors in the Major and\nArea Boilers Rules.\n\n     Nor do we agree with the Industry Petitioners’ secondary\nargument that the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously by\nfailing to set a work-practice or a GACT management-\npractice standard for malfunction periods. First, the statute\nmakes clear that these kinds of standards are to be set at the\ndiscretion of the EPA, so it would be difficult to interpret the\nstatute consistently with its text while holding that the text’s\npermissive language in fact sets out a requirement that the\nAgency set work-practice or GACT management-practice\nstandards.       As to work-practice standards, “[t]he\nAdministrator may, in lieu [of a numeric standard],\npromulgate a design, equipment, work practice, or operational\nstandard, or combination thereof,” and any such standard set\nmust “in the Administrator’s judgment [be] consistent with\nthe provisions of subsection (d).” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(h)(1). As\nto GACT management-practice standards, “the Administrator\nmay . . . elect to promulgate” such standards with respect to\ncertain “categories and subcategories of area sources.” Id.\n§ 7412(d)(5). It should go without saying that “may means\nmay.” McCreary v. Offner, 172 F.3d 76, 83 (D.C. Cir. 1999)\n(internal quotations omitted).\n\n    Second, the Petitioners have not demonstrated and the\nEPA does not concede that setting work-practice or GACT\nmanagement-practice standards would even be feasible for\nperiods of malfunction. As for work-practice standards, the\nEPA would have to conceive of a standard that could apply\n\f                             36\n\nequally to the wide range of possible boiler malfunctions,\nranging from an explosion to minor mechanical defects. Any\npossible standard is likely to be hopelessly generic to govern\nsuch a wide array of circumstances. Similar problems exist\nfor setting GACT management practices. These management\npractices would also need to apply to the wide range of\npossible malfunctions, and the EPA would need to determine\nthat the standard would “reduce emissions of hazardous air\npollutants,” an evidence-based standard that is difficult\n(perhaps impossible) to apply to the unpredictable\ncircumstances       of      malfunctions.      42       U.S.C.\n§ 7412(d)(5). Thus, we reject the Industry Petitioners’\nargument that the EPA was required to set a work-practice or\nGACT management-practice standard for malfunction\nperiods.\n\n     In doing so, we are mindful that the EPA is not the only\nentity able to bring enforcement actions under the CAA, but\nthat private citizens are also empowered to enforce emission\nstandards by filing suit in district court. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7604(a). Assurances that the EPA will use its prosecutorial\ndiscretion to account for malfunctions would mean little if\nprivate citizens could seek strict enforcement of those same\nstandards. But as we stated in NRDC III, “the Judiciary, not\nany executive agency, determines ‘the scope’—including the\navailable remedies—‘of judicial power vested by’ statutes\nestablishing private rights of action.” 749 F.3d at 1063\n(quoting City of Arlington v. FCC, 133 S. Ct. 1863, 1871\n(2013)). Accordingly, in citizen suits under the CAA, “the\ncourts determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether civil\npenalties are ‘appropriate.’” Id. Boiler operators can argue\nthat penalties should not be assessed because of an\nunavoidable malfunction, and they can support that argument\nwith other relevant facts, “such as the defendant’s ‘full\n\f                               37\n\ncompliance history and good faith efforts to comply.’” Id.\n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 7413(e)(1)). The EPA can also provide\nsupporting argumentation as intervenor or amicus. Id. Courts\nshould not hesitate to exercise their judicial authority to craft\nappropriate civil remedies in the case of emissions\nexceedances caused by unavoidable malfunctions.\n\n 2. Periods of Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction in the\n                        CISWI Rule\n\n     In the CISWI Rule, the EPA made no modification for\nperiods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. The Industry\nPetitioners argue that failing to account for these periods\nviolated the EPA’s statutory instruction to set “achievable”\nstandards. Additionally, the Industry Petitioners claim it was\narbitrary and capricious for the EPA to set work-practice\nstandards for startup and shutdown periods under the Major\nBoilers Rule but not under the CISWI Rule. Both arguments\nare without merit.\n\n     First, the EPA’s emission standards for small incinerators\ndo take into account periods of shutdown and startup. The\nEPA based its standards for these machines on “short term\nstack tests for pollutants,” in which incinerators are monitored\nduring the course of normal operation, which includes daily\nstartup and shutdown periods. See 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,738. Thus, startup and shutdown times are already\nincorporated into the standards the EPA set, and what is more,\nnearly all pollutants are present in smaller numbers during\nstartup and shutdown anyway, when incinerators are burning\nfuels alone rather than fuels and solid waste. See Standards of\nPerformance for New Stationary Sources and Emission\nGuidelines for Existing Sources: Commercial and Industrial\nSolid Waste Incineration Units (2010 Proposed CISWI Rule),\n\f                               38\n\n75 Fed. Reg. 31,938, 31,964 (June 4, 2010). Given this\nreality, the CISWI Rule satisfies the statutory standard of\n“achievability” and is not arbitrary and capricious.\n\n     Second, as to periods of malfunctions, the same analysis\napplies to the CISWI Rule as applies to the Boilers\nRules. The EPA adopted a reasonable interpretation of the\nCAA when it excluded periods of malfunction from its\ncalculations of achievability given that malfunction periods\nare by their very nature unpredictable in terms of their effect\non emissions. The EPA’s decision to account for\nmalfunctions in its discretion is likewise a reasonable\ninterpretation of 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2) and (3).\n\n    For these reasons, we reject the Industry Petitioners’\nchallenges to the EPA’s regulatory choices with regard to\nperiods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction.\n\n      B. THE POLLUTANT-BY-POLLUTANT APPROACH\n\n     The EPA must look to the performance of the best major\nboilers and CISWI incinerators when setting MACT floors for\na pollutant. As described above, for new units, the EPA must\nset floors at the level achieved by the best similar unit in each\nsubcategory. For existing units, the Agency must set floors at\nthe level achieved by the best 12 per cent of similar units in\neach subcategory. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7412(d)(3)(A), 7429(a)(2).\nAs a result, the EPA had to identify the best performing units\nin each subcategory when setting the MACT floors for the\nMajor Boilers and CISWI Rules. But the EPA often could not\nidentify a single unit or set of units that controlled all HAPs\nbetter than the other units in the subcategory. Instead, the\nEPA sometimes found that a unit might rank among the best\n\f                              39\n\nin its subcategory at controlling emissions of one HAP, but\namong the worst at controlling emissions of a different HAP.\n\n     To address this problem, the EPA adopted a “pollutant-\nby-pollutant” approach in setting the MACT floors: instead of\nidentifying the unit or units that best controlled all HAPs in\nthe aggregate, the EPA used one unit or set of units to set the\nMACT floor for, e.g., PM, and used a different unit or set of\nunits to set the MACT floor for, e.g., HCl. See 2011 Major\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,621-23; 2011 CISWI Rule,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 15,720-21. For at least two subcategories of\nmajor boilers—new heavy oil-fired units and existing stoker\ncoal-fired units—the EPA’s pollutant-by-pollutant approach\nresulted in MACT floors that no unit in the subcategory had\nachieved in toto. Similarly, for small, remote incinerators\n(SRIs), the approach resulted in standards for existing units\nthat only two of the 28 SRI units had met in toto, and\nstandards for new units that no existing SRI had met in toto.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners challenge the EPA’s use of the\npollutant-by-pollutant approach. According to the Industry\nPetitioners, the CAA’s plain language requires the Agency to\nidentify the best overall unit or set of units—not the best unit\nor set of units for a particular pollutant—in each subcategory\nwhen setting MACT floors. They further claim the EPA’s\npollutant-by-pollutant approach was unreasonable with regard\nto SRIs because it resulted in a set of emission standards that\nno single unit in the subcategory had achieved in practice.\nWe disagree, and conclude that the EPA’s pollutant-by-\npollutant approach is a reasonable interpretation and\napplication of the statute.\n\n    For the purposes of this challenge, the MACT floor\nprovisions for major boilers and CISWI units are identical.\n\f                              40\n\nUnder both provisions, the EPA must set emission standards\nfor new units based on “the emissions control that is achieved\nin practice by the best controlled similar unit, as determined\nby the Administrator.” 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2) (CISWI); see\nalso id. § 7412(d)(3) (major boilers). For existing units, the\nMACT floor is based on “the average emissions limitation\nachieved by the best performing 12 percent of units in the\ncategory.”     Id. § 7429(a)(2) (CISWI); see also id.\n§ 7412(d)(3)(A) (major boilers).\n\n     The Industry Petitioners claim this language\nunambiguously forecloses the EPA’s pollutant-by-pollutant\napproach. For new units, they assert, the statute requires the\nEPA to find the single unit that performs best overall and use\nthis unit—and only this unit—to set standards for all\nregulated pollutants. For example, if Incinerator 3 were\ndeemed the best overall performer in a subcategory, then the\nEPA would use Incinerator 3’s emissions levels to set\nstandards for PM, CO, and each of the other regulated\npollutants. This would be true even if Incinerator 1 in the\nsame subcategory had lower CO emissions and Incinerator 2\nhad lower PM emissions. The Industry Petitioners also make\nthis argument for existing sources. For these units, under\ntheir interpretation, the mandate to identify the “best\nperforming 12 percent of units” required the EPA to use data\nfrom the 12 per cent of sources with the lowest overall\nemissions in the subcategory.         In short, the Industry\nPetitioners argue that the best “unit” referred to by the\nprovision cannot be a “hypothetical composite” of multiple\nunits that result in standards for new units that no actual unit\nhas met in practice with regard to every pollutant, or\nstandards for existing units that 12 per cent of actual units\nhave not met with regard to every pollutant.\n\f                              41\n\n     The Industry Petitioners read too much into the statutory\nlanguage. It is true that the statute requires the EPA to base\nMACT standards on what is “achieved” by the best “unit” or\n“12 percent of units.” But, as the EPA argues, the statute says\nnothing about how the Agency should determine which units\nare the best. Cf. Sierra Club v. EPA, 167 F.3d 658, 661 (D.C.\nCir. 1999) (noting that section 7429(a) “on its own says\nnothing about how the performance of the best units is to be\ncalculated”). Both the industry-favored method of choosing\nthe best overall unit and the EPA’s method of choosing the\nbest unit as to each particular pollutant facially comport with\nthe statute’s mandate to determine which units are best.\nBecause the statute is ambiguous as to how the EPA should\nidentify those units, we must defer to the Agency’s choice so\nlong as it is reasonable. See Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 990.\n\n     Here, the EPA’s choice is reasonable. The statute\nprovides that emission standards shall reflect “the maximum\ndegree of reduction in emissions of [regulated pollutants] that\nthe Administrator . . . determines is achievable for new or\nexisting units in each category.” 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2); see\nalso id. § 7412(d)(2). It then provides that the “degree of\nreduction in emissions that is deemed achievable for new\nunits in a category shall not be less stringent than the\nemissions control that is achieved in practice by the best\ncontrolled similar unit, as determined by the Administrator.”\nId. § 7429(a)(2); see also id. § 7412(d)(3). Reading these\nprovisions together, they support a pollutant-by-pollutant\napproach. The “best controlled similar unit” language does\nnot exist in a vacuum; rather, it exists to measure the “degree\nof reduction in emissions that is deemed achievable.” Id.\n§ 7429(a)(2); see also id. § 7412(d)(3). That “reduction in\nemissions” is the reduction in emissions of each pollutant\nlisted in sections 7429(a)(4) and 7412(b)(1). The EPA’s\n\f                              42\n\napproach to setting standards on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis\nthus comfortably fits within this statutory scheme.\n\n     Moreover, the Industry Petitioners have not explained\nhow their preferred approach would better comport with the\nstatute. Were the EPA required to determine which units\nperform best “overall,” we see at least two possibilities for\nhow it could do so: First, the EPA could calculate a unit’s\naverage emissions for each pollutant in consistent units of\nmeasurement, add these emissions together, and then choose\nthe unit with the smallest overall sum in each subcategory.\nBut this approach could produce arbitrary results, because the\n“best performing” overall unit might emit unusually low\nquantities of some pollutants and unusually high quantities of\nothers. This would mean the emission standards for some\npollutants would be lenient while others would be stringent,\nwith no principled reason for the difference. Alternatively,\nthe Agency could identify which source is best overall based\non which emits the lowest level of the riskiest pollutants. But\nthis approach would require the Agency to rank pollutants’\nrelative risks without any congressional guidance on how to\ndo so. This approach would also contravene our previous\nunderstanding of the congressional intent behind the MACT\nfloor provisions. As we have explained, the MACT floors\n“are to be based not on an assessment of the risks posed by\n[pollutants], but instead on the maximum achievable control\ntechnology (MACT) for sources in each category.” Sierra\nClub I, 353 F.3d at 980.\n\n    The Industry Petitioners nevertheless argue that the\nCAA’s legislative history supports their preferred approach.\nIn particular, they point to the floor comments of Senator\nDurenberger discussing the potential impact on MACT floors\nof mutually incompatible control technologies. 136 Cong.\n\f                              43\n\nRec. S17,238 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1990) (statement of Senator\nDurenberger). Mutually incompatible control technologies\ncannot be used at the same time and therefore present\nregulators with a dilemma. For example, say Technology 1\nand Technology 2 cannot be used together. If Technology 1\nis better at reducing PM than Technology 2, and Technology\n2 is better at reducing CO than Technology 1, the EPA would\nhave to choose which of the two technologies to factor into\nemission standards. In such situations, Senator Durenberger\nanticipated that the “EPA should judge MACT to be the\ntechnology which best benefits human health and the\nenvironment on the whole.” Id. The Industry Petitioners\nargue this statement demonstrates that Congress intended the\nEPA to make an overall determination of which units are the\nbest performing “on the whole.”\n\n     Senator Durenberger’s statement does not support this\nbroad principle. The statement merely explains that, where\ntwo technologies cannot be used together, the EPA should\nbase MACT standards on the technology it considers best\noverall. Here, the Industry Petitioners do not identify any\nrelevant control technologies that are mutually incompatible.\nIndeed, the EPA found in the CISWI Rule that “there is no\ntechnical reason why [the] air pollution control systems\ncannot be combined.” 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,721; see also 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,623 (“All available data for boilers and process heaters\nindicate that there is no technical problem achieving the floor\nlevels contained in this final rule for each HAP\nsimultaneously, using the MACT floor technology.”). There\nis thus no reason to believe that the EPA’s current MACT\nfloor standards cannot be achieved. Instead, the Industry\nPetitioners merely insist that no units currently meet the\nEPA’s new unit standards with regard to every regulated\n\f                              44\n\npollutant in certain subcategories, and only a few sources\nmeet all of the standards for existing units in the same\nsubcategories. But, if the statute permits the EPA to\ndetermine which units are best on a pollutant-by-pollutant\nbasis—and it does—then the EPA’s choice to adopt that\napproach does not become unlawful merely because few or no\nunits have achieved those standards for all pollutants.\n\n     Finally, the Industry Petitioners argue that even if the\npollutant-by-pollutant approach is reasonable in some\ncircumstances, it is arbitrary and capricious as applied to\ncertain SRIs because it exacerbates certain problems posed by\nthe “batch” nature of SRIs. As explained at infra § III.E,\nSRIs burn waste in small batches. According to the\nPetitioners, this means that the SRIs that the EPA identified as\nbest performing were, in reality, burning cleaner waste at the\ntime emissions testing was done; they were not actually better\nthan other units at removing or destroying waste. The\npollutant-by-pollutant approach, the Industry Petitioners\nargue, “simply captures the results from units that happened\nto be burning wastes with low levels of that particular\npollutant during testing,” and this reality makes it harder for\nSRI units to meet emission standards for all pollutants at the\nsame time. No. 11-1125 Indus. Pet’rs’ Reply Br. 8 (emphasis\nomitted).\n\n     This argument fails because the Industry Petitioners have\nnot demonstrated that the Agency considered impermissible\nfactors, failed “to consider important aspect[s] of the\nproblem,” or offered an unreasonable explanation for its\ndecision when setting the MACT floors for SRIs. See State\nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43. Rather, their argument is a back-door\nattempt to challenge the Agency’s alleged failure to consider\nwaste inputs, which we reject below at infra § III.E.\n\f                               45\n\nPetitioners have also not shown that it is infeasible for the SRI\nunits to meet the MACT floor standards or that any individual\npollutant standard was not achieved in practice by an existing\nSRI unit. They merely assert, without evidence, that no\nexisting unit burning high sulfur garbage can match the SO2\nperformance achieved by the unit the EPA used to set SO2\nstandards because that latter unit was burning low sulfur\nwaste at the time of the emissions testing. But MACT floors\nare not unreasonable simply because they are difficult to\nachieve in practice. As such, we find the EPA’s pollutant-by-\npollutant approach to be a reasonable interpretation and\napplication of the statute, and deny the Industry Petitioners’\nchallenge to the EPA’s use of this approach.\n\n       C. THE ENERGY-ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENT\n\n     The Major Boilers Rule and the Area Boilers Rule\ngenerally require sources with existing boilers to perform a\none-time energy assessment. In the assessment, facilities\nmust “identify energy conservation measures”—such as\n“process changes or other modifications to the facility”—\n“that can be implemented to reduce the facility energy\ndemand,” thereby “reduc[ing] fuel use.” 2011 Area Boilers\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573; see also 2011 Major Boilers\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,632. While facilities must conduct\nthe assessment, they need not implement its conclusions. See\n2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573; 2011 Major\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,632.\n\n     The logic behind the assessment is straightforward.\nBoilers produce HAP emissions when fuel is combusted.\nLess combustion means fewer emissions. The EPA primarily\njustified the assessment as a beyond-the-floor MACT\nrequirement under section 7412(d)(2). See 2011 Area Boilers\n\f                               46\n\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573; 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76\nFed. Reg. at 15,632. With respect to certain biomass and oil-\nfired boilers located at area sources, the assessment was\njustified as a GACT management practice under\nsection 7412(d)(5). See 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 15,567.\n\n     Industry Petitioners raise three principal challenges to the\nenergy-assessment requirement, none of which have purchase.\nThe first challenge claims that the energy assessment\nregulates aspects of facilities that are off limits to the EPA—\nnamely, the energy needs supplied by regulated boilers.\nPetitioners point to the language of the CAA, which requires\nthe EPA to “list . . . categories and subcategories of major\nsources and area sources” of enumerated air pollutants. 42\nU.S.C. § 7412(c)(1). “For the categories and subcategories\nthe Administrator lists, the Administrator” must set\n“emissions standards under” section 7412(d).                   Id.\n§ 7412(c)(2). As relevant here, the EPA defined the source\ncategories to include “industrial boilers and commercial and\ninstitutional boilers.” 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,557; 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,608. To\nthe extent the assessment concerns parts of the facility other\nthan the boiler itself, the Industry Petitioners claim it exceeds\nthe EPA’s authority.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners misapprehend both the scope of\nthe assessment and the CAA. The assessment requires\nfacilities to evaluate energy systems “located on the site of the\naffected boiler,” including “[p]rocess heating[,] compressed\nair systems[,] . . . facility heating, ventilation, and air\nconditioning systems,” and “[o]ther systems that use steam,\nhot water, process heat, or electricity, provided by the affected\nboiler.” 40 C.F.R. § 63.11237; see id. § 63.7575. Based on\n\f                              47\n\nthat evaluation, facilities must compile a “comprehensive\nreport detailing the ways to improve efficiency, the cost of\nspecific improvements, [anticipated] benefits, and the time\nframe for recouping those investments.” 40 C.F.R. pt. 63,\nsubpt. JJJJJJ tbl.2; id. pt. 63, subpt. DDDDD tbl.3.\n\n     Contrary to the Industry Petitioners’ argument, the EPA\nhas not “regulate[d] virtually every piece of equipment at all\naffected facilities.” No. 11-1141 Indus. Pet’rs’ Br. 19. Only\n“energy use systems” that “us[e] energy clearly produced by\naffected boilers” must be evaluated; facilities need not review\nthe “total aggregation of all individual energy using segments\nof a facility.” 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,493\n(emphasis added); see also 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 7,188. The assessment focuses on “discrete segments\nof a facility,” such as “production area[s] or building[s]”\nassociated with a particular boiler. 2013 Area Boilers Rule,\n78 Fed. Reg. at 7,493; see 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 7,188. Energy requirements satisfied by other\nsources—not by a HAP-emitting boiler—fall outside of that\nmandate. See 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573\n(limiting the assessment to “specific portions of the source\nthat directly affect emissions from the affected boiler”). And\nregulated facilities are under no obligation to implement the\nresults they reach. In essence, rather than setting inflexible\nand generally applicable beyond-the-floor numeric limits, the\nEPA required facilities to take stock of the actual energy\ndemands placed on their boilers. By reducing energy\ndemands and associated fuel consumption, facilities could\nreduce HAP emissions. That requirement is more measured\nthan the Industry Petitioners contend.\n\n     And that measured requirement falls within the EPA’s\nstatutory authority. The CAA authorizes the EPA to regulate\n\f                               48\n\n“major sources and area sources” of HAPs, and to subdivide\nthose sources into categories and subcategories. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(c)(1), (c)(2). To Industry Petitioners, the authority to\nsubdivide sources means the EPA may only regulate the\nnarrowest applicable categorization—in this instance,\ncommercial and industrial boilers. But the statute does not\nrequire so rigid a reading. While the EPA is permitted to\nsubdivide sources, each subdivision remains a component of\neither a major or area “source.” Dividing sources into\ncategories and subcategories does not make them any less of a\n“source” subject to the EPA’s regulation.\n\n     For that reason, the EPA explained that the Rules reach,\nrespectively, “[a]ny area source facility using a boiler,” 2011\nArea Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,555 (emphasis added),\nand “major source facilities having affected boilers or process\nheaters,” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613\n(emphasis added). Likewise, the regulations implementing\nthe energy assessment requirement apply to those who “own\nor operate an existing affected boiler,” not merely to the\nboiler itself. 40 C.F.R. § 63.11214(c); see id. § 63.7485.\nGoing further, the relevant part of the CFR applies, by its own\nterms, to the “owner or operator of any stationary source.” Id.\n§ 63.1(b)(1).\n\n     The Congress’s definition of the terms major and area\nsource supports this reading. At bottom, both terms refer to a\n“stationary source.” See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(a)(1), (a)(2).\nStationary source, in turn, means “any building, structure,\nfacility, or installation which emits or may emit any air\npollutant.” Id. § 7411(a)(3). Against that backdrop, the Rules\napply to any “building, structure, facility, or installation” that\ncontains a boiler emitting the specified HAPs. The EPA’s\n\f                               49\n\nregulatory authority reaches the relevant stationary source, of\nwhich the boiler is part.\n\n     That the EPA may regulate stationary sources does not\nmean it may regulate every nook and cranny of those sources.\nThe CAA directs its authority to the establishment of\nemission standards; it does not provide some general power to\nsuperintend the business processes of plants and\nmanufacturing facilities. In this case, however, we have no\noccasion to parse the precise parameters of the EPA’s\nauthority to regulate aspects of area sources. It is enough to\nconclude that the challenged energy assessment—which\napplies only to systems that “us[e] energy clearly produced by\naffected boilers”—falls within the EPA’s authority under the\nCAA. 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,493; 2013\nMajor Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,188.\n\n    In the remaining two challenges, the Industry Petitioners\ntake issue with the EPA’s justification of the energy\nassessment as a beyond-the-floor MACT standard and a\nGACT management-practice standard.         We reject both\nchallenges.\n\n     The assessment represents a valid beyond-the-floor\nMACT standard.13 As discussed, after the Agency sets the\nMACT floor, it must determine “whether stricter standards\nare ‘achievable,’” Nat’l Lime Ass’n, 233 F.3d at 629 (quoting\n42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2)), considering costs, “any non-air\n    13\n        In addition to challenging the assessment as a beyond-the-\nfloor measure, the Industry Petitioners claim the assessment\nrepresents an invalid work-practice standard. But “[t]he energy\nassessment is not . . . a work practice standard, and EPA makes no\nclaim that it is.” No. 11-1141 EPA Br. 47 n.9. Therefore, we\ndecline to address that contention.\n\f                              50\n\nquality health and environmental impacts and energy\nrequirements,” 42 US.C. § 7412(d)(2). These “measures,\nprocesses, methods, systems or techniques includ[e], but [are]\nnot limited to, measures which—\n\n   (A) reduce the volume of, or eliminate emissions\n       of, such pollutants through process changes,\n       substitution    of    materials   or   other\n       modifications, . . .\n\n   (D) are design, equipment, work practice, or\n       operational standards . . . or\n\n   (E) are a combination of the above.\n\nId. The EPA primarily justified the energy assessment as a\nbeyond-the-floor measure designed to identify “process\nchanges or other modifications to the facility” that would\nreduce fuel use and thereby reduce hazardous emissions.\n2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573; 2011 Major\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,632.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners argue that the EPA skipped a\nstep, imposing the energy assessment as a beyond-the-floor\nmeasure without first setting a relevant MACT floor. That is\nincorrect. The EPA first set a numeric MACT emissions limit\nfor the categories and subcategories of sources subject to the\nenergy assessment. See 40 C.F.R. pt. 63, subpt. JJJJJ tbl.1; id.\npt. 63, subpt. DDDDD tbl.2. The energy assessment\nrepresents a step beyond that—a measure designed to\ndiscover energy efficiencies that, once implemented, could\ndecrease emissions below the floor level.\n\n    Before setting a beyond-the-floor measure, the EPA must\nconsider whether it is “achievable” based on a number of\n\f                              51\n\nfactors, among them cost, “non-air quality health and\nenvironmental impacts and energy requirements.” 42 US.C.\n§ 7412(d)(2). The EPA did so here. To begin, the EPA\nadequately considered costs. In the EPA’s estimation, “[t]he\none-time cost of an energy assessment ranges from $2500 to\n$55,000 depending on the size of the facility.” 2010 Proposed\nArea Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,907; National Emission\nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources:\nIndustrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers and Process\nHeaters (2010 Proposed Major Boilers Rule), 75 Fed. Reg.\n32,006, 32,026 (June 4, 2010). Because saving fuel saves\nmoney, common sense suggested that sources would often\nfind the energy assessment “cost-effective” to implement.\n2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,568 (“By\ndefinition, any emission reduction [achieved as a result of the\nenergy assessment] would be cost effective or else it would\nnot be implemented.”); see also 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76\nFed. Reg. at 15,633.\n\n    In addition to costs, the EPA considered non-air quality\nhealth and environmental impacts in general terms,\nconcluding that “improving energy efficiency reduces\nnegative impacts on the environment.” 2010 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,907; 2010 Proposed Major\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,026. Given the nature of the\nassessment, the EPA’s somewhat terse analysis of health and\nenvironmental impacts suffices. Performing the assessment\ninvolves rudimentary tasks—examining the boiler and\nassociated energy systems and drafting a report—that do not\nimpose meaningful health or environmental impacts. The\nsame holds for the EPA’s consideration of energy use\nrequirements. Facilities would expend very little energy in\nconducting the one-time assessment, and could conserve\n\f                             52\n\nenergy by implementing the results. The assessment therefore\nrepresents a lawful beyond-the-floor measure.\n\n     We also find that the assessment is a valid GACT\nmanagement practice. With respect to area sources, the EPA\nhas discretion to require the use of “generally available\ncontrol technologies or management practices . . . to reduce\nemissions of hazardous air pollutants.”           42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(d)(5). The EPA justified the energy assessment as a\nGACT management practice for oil- and biomass-fired\nboilers. See 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,567.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners challenge that justification,\nclaiming the energy assessment—which does not require\nimplementation—cannot “reduce emissions of hazardous air\npollutants.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(5). We disagree. The EPA\ndid not need to make implementation mandatory to make the\nassessment lawful. Under the CAA, the EPA may sometimes\nact with a soft touch, rather than a firm hand. Here, the EPA\nselected a soft touch, requiring an assessment but not\nimplementation. It was not unreasonable for the EPA to\nconclude, “after considering the structure of the requirement,\nthe incentives it presents, and the likely behavior of\nsources, . . . that sources will find it cost-effective to\nimplement the conservation measures identified in the energy\nassessment.” 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573.\nIf the results were implemented, HAP emissions would be\nreduced. For present purposes, that is enough.\n\n    For those reasons, we reject the Industry Petitioners’\nchallenges to the energy-assessment requirement.\n\f                               53\n\n  D. RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENT FOR CISWI UNITS\n\n     Section 7429 regulates combustion units that burn solid\nwaste; units that do not burn solid waste will generally be\nregulated under section 7412. RCRA defines the term “solid\nwaste” to mean (in part) “discarded material . . . resulting\nfrom industrial [or] commercial . . . operations.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 6903(27); see id. § 7429(g)(6) (directing that “solid waste”\ncarry “the meanings established by the Administrator\npursuant to” RCRA). On the same day the EPA issued a rule\nsetting emission standards for CISWI, it issued a separate rule\nfleshing out the meaning of solid waste in the context of\ncombustion units. See NHSM Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,456.\n\n     The NHSM Rule generally provides that “non-hazardous\nsecondary materials that are combusted are solid wastes,”14\nsubject to several exceptions and exemptions. 40 C.F.R.\n§ 241.3(a). Among the exceptions, non-hazardous secondary\nmaterials that meet certain “legitimacy” criteria do not qualify\nas solid waste. See id. § 241.3(b), (d). Source owners and\noperators may also seek a finding from the EPA that\nparticular materials do not constitute solid waste when\ncombusted by a third party. Id. § 241.3(c). And the rule\nexempts altogether a variety of materials from the definition\nof solid waste, including “traditional fuels.” Id. § 241.2.\n\n    The NHSM Rule is self-implementing: each source\nowner or operator must determine whether combusted\nmaterials meet the definition of solid waste. See 2011 CISWI\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,740. To ensure that owners and\n\n    14\n         The NHSM Rule defines non-hazardous secondary material\nto “mean[] a secondary material that, when discarded, would not be\nidentified as a hazardous waste.” 40 C.F.R. § 241.2.\n\f                                  54\n\noperators “review and apply” the NHSM Rule and its\nexceptions, the EPA issued strict recordkeeping requirements.\nId. Owners and operators who determine the secondary\nmaterials they combust are not solid waste must “keep a\nrecord” justifying that decision. 40 C.F.R. § 60.2175(v).\nFailing to file records carries consequences. For units\ncombusting discarded material other than traditional fuels, the\nfailure to “keep and produce records” results in the\ndetermination that “the operating unit is a CISWI unit.” Id.\n§§ 60.2265, 60.2875 (containing an identical provision).\n\n     Industry Petitioners challenge this last provision of the\nCISWI Rule.15 They argue that the EPA cannot automatically\ntreat units that fail to keep certain paperwork as CISWI units.\nSection 7429 permits regulation of “solid waste incineration\nunits”—not units whose owners fail to file paperwork. As a\nresult, the Industry Petitioners ask this court to invalidate the\nregulatory provision as exceeding the EPA’s statutory\nauthority.16\n\n     We decline the invitation. At Chevron’s first step, we\nfind that “Congress did not speak directly, let alone clearly, to\n\n     15\n        In their reply brief, the Industry Petitioners clarify that they\ndo not challenge the EPA’s authority to require sources to keep\nrecords.\n     16\n         The Industry Petitioners also argue the EPA arbitrarily\nfailed to provide sufficient notice of the recordkeeping\npresumption. We disagree. The Industry Petitioners had sufficient\nnotice of the CISWI Rule, which was promulgated after notice and\ncomment and “give[s] fair warning of the conduct it prohibits.”\nGen. Elec. Co. v. EPA, 53 F.3d 1324, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1995)\n(quoting Gates & Fox Co. v. OSHRC, 790 F.2d 154, 156 (D.C. Cir.\n1986)).\n\f                               55\n\nthis issue.” Am. Chem. Council v. EPA, 337 F.3d 1060, 1064\n(D.C. Cir. 2003). Section 7429 regulates “solid waste\nincineration units,” a phrase that Congress defined “plainly\nand broadly to include ‘a distinct operating unit of any facility\nwhich combusts any solid waste material from commercial or\nindustrial establishments or the general public.’” NRDC I,\n489 F.3d at 1257 (emphasis omitted) (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7429(g)(1)). In NRDC I, we vacated an earlier iteration of\nthe CISWI Rule that narrowed the scope of that definition\nbeyond what its language would bear. See id. at 1257-58.\nWhen the Congress commanded the EPA to regulate units\nthat burn “any” solid waste, the Congress meant what it said.\nSee id.\n\n     In this case, the EPA included within the revised CISWI\nRule a presumption designed to enforce the Congress’s\ncommand. Section 7429 nowhere addresses whether the EPA\nmay establish presumptions to ensure its regulations reach all\nsources burning solid waste. At the same time, the Congress\nplainly intended the EPA to regulate sources burning “any”\nsolid waste, a goal presumably advanced by the\nrecordkeeping presumption. See id. Against that backdrop,\nwe cannot conclude that the presumption offends the text or\npurpose of section 7429.\n\n    Moving to Chevron’s second step, we conclude the\nrecordkeeping presumption is reasonable. In American\nChemistry Council, we upheld a regulation issued under\nRCRA defining hazardous waste to include any mixture or\nderivative of hazardous substances. See 337 F.3d at 1064-65.\n“[B]ecause many mixtures of and derivatives from hazardous\nwastes are themselves hazardous, it [was] reasonable for the\nEPA to assume that all such mixtures and derivatives are\nhazardous until shown otherwise.” Id. at 1065. In that\n\f                              56\n\ncontext, it made good sense for the EPA to “[p]lac[e] the\nburden upon the regulated entity” to show that a given\nsubstance lacked “hazardous characteristic[s].” Id.\n\n     Similar reasoning applies here. The EPA crafted the\npresumption to reach sources likely to be burning solid waste,\nnamely, those burning discarded materials other than\ntraditional fuels. See 42 U.S.C. § 6903(27) (defining “solid\nwaste” to include, among other things, “discarded material”);\n40 C.F.R. § 241.2 (exempting traditional fuels, defined as\n“materials that are produced as fuels . . . that have not been\ndiscarded,” from the definition of solid waste). Such sources\nare subject to strict recordkeeping requirements. See 40\nC.F.R. § 60.2175(v). Within those confines, placing the\nburden on unit operators who have the mandatory obligation\nand the information to establish their non-regulable status is\nreasonable. Cf. Am. Chem. Council, 337 F.3d at 1065.\n\n     There is, however, a difference between the presumption\nin this case and the one we upheld in American Chemistry\nCouncil. The CISWI recordkeeping presumption appears to\nturn on the failure to file paperwork, rather than the presence\nof a regulated substance. However broadly the Congress\ndefined “solid waste incineration unit” in section 7429, the\nCongress did not allow for the regulation of non-waste\nburning sources—even when those sources fail to file\npaperwork. Indeed, had the EPA attempted to regulate\nsources based purely on a failure to file paperwork, we may\nwell have reached a different conclusion.\n\n    But the CISWI presumption does not stretch so far. As\nexplained, the presumption depends on factors beyond the\nmere failure to keep records. Sources subject to the\npresumption burn materials likely to qualify as solid waste,\n\f                                57\n\nand must satisfy demanding recordkeeping requirements. The\nEPA acted reasonably when it presumed such sources were\nburning solid waste.\n\n     Despite the provision’s narrow reach, the Industry\nPetitioners fear it will sweep up sources not burning solid\nwaste.     To the extent that possibility exists, sources\nwrongfully regulated as CISWI have multiple forms of\nrecourse. Most obviously, sources can prepare and file the\nrecords they were already required to make under 40 C.F.R.\n§ 60.2175(v). They can also avail themselves of procedures\ndesigned to identify non-waste materials in 40 C.F.R. § 241.3.\nThe existence of these safety valves calms concerns that the\npresumption will regulate non-waste burning sources.\n\n      We therefore reject the Industry Petitioners’ challenges\nto the recordkeeping presumption.17\n\n         E. WASTE-STREAM VARIANCE FOR SRI UNITS\n\n     The EPA regulated SRIs as a subcategory in the CISWI\nRule. See Memorandum from Eastern Research Group, Inc.,\nto Toni Jones, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, CISWI\nEmission Limit Calculations for Existing and New Sources\nfor the Reconsideration Final Rule (Jones Mem.) (Nov. 16,\n2012) (No. 11-1125 J.A. 1159, 1162). There are 28 SRI units,\n\n    17\n        The Industry Petitioners also contend that the CISWI Rule\nfunctions as a form of injunctive relief in violation of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7413(a). That is incorrect. The provision is neither styled nor\noperated as a form of injunctive relief. Cf. 42 U.S.C. § 7413(a)\n(permitting the Administrator to issue, among other forms of relief,\n“an administrative penalty order” or “an order requiring [a person\nin violation of EPA regulations] to comply with such requirement\nor prohibition”).\n\f                              58\n\nall of which are located in Alaska, and the EPA had emissions\ndata for nine of them. Id. As explained supra § I.B.3, the\nEPA used the pollutant-by-pollutant approach to establish\nMACT emission standards for these units. For new-unit\nstandards, the EPA determined which of the nine units had the\nlowest emissions for a particular pollutant and set the MACT\nfloor for that pollutant at the level achieved by the identified\nunit. See 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2) (explaining that MACT\nfloors for new units must be set at “the emissions control that\nis achieved in practice by the best controlled similar unit”).\nWhen setting MACT floors for existing units, the EPA had to\ncalculate the average level of emissions achieved by the best\nperforming 12 per cent of units. See id. It therefore\ndetermined which four sources had the lowest emissions for a\ngiven pollutant and set the emissions standard for that\npollutant at the average level achieved by those four units.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners argue that the EPA’s approach\nwas unlawful because it failed to account for the unique role\nthat waste inputs play in emissions from SRIs. Unlike larger\nincinerators, SRIs burn small batches of waste at a time. Some\nbatches include cleaner waste, such as wood and cardboard,\nwhile others include waste, such as sewage, that generates\nlarge quantities of SO2 and other pollutants. Moreover,\nexisting SRIs cannot use certain “end-of-stack” control\ntechnologies like wet scrubbers due to the Alaskan climate.\nThe Industry Petitioners thus contend that emissions from\nSRIs are more closely tied to waste input than are emissions\nfrom other types of incinerators. This difference, they assert,\nrequired the EPA to take into account, when determining\nwhich SRI units were best performing for MACT floor\npurposes, the kind of waste an SRI unit was burning at the\ntime of testing. Because the Agency did not do so, the\n\f                              59\n\nIndustry Petitioners contend the MACT standards for SRIs are\narbitrary and capricious. We disagree.\n\n     To support their challenge, the Industry Petitioners\nadvance two arguments, neither of which has merit.\nPetitioners first point to section 7429(a)(3), which directs the\nEPA to base emission standards on “methods and\ntechnologies for removal or destruction of pollutants before,\nduring, or after combustion.” 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(3).\nAccording to the Industry Petitioners, this language requires\nthe EPA to identify best performing units for MACT purposes\nby considering which units are best at removing or destroying\npollutants. The Industry Petitioners assert that the Agency did\nnot do this. Instead, they contend, the EPA set standards\nwithout regard to whether that unit happened to be burning\ncleaner waste. And, according to the Industry Petitioners,\nremote incinerators in Alaska cannot control their waste\ninputs because the core purpose of SRIs is to burn waste that\nis impracticably far from municipal landfills. The fact that\nemissions levels varied dramatically during test runs for the\nSRI units, they claim, is thus the result of random variance in\nthe type of waste the unit was combusting, rather than any\n“method” or “technology” aimed at “removing” or\n“destroying” pollutants.\n\n     The EPA responds that the approach it adopted for SRIs\ncomplies with section 7429(a)(3) because “waste\nsegregation”—that is, diverting dirtier waste to landfills and\nburning only cleaner waste—is a “method . . . for removal . . .\nof pollutants before . . . combustion.”      See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7429(a)(3). In fact, during notice and comment, the EPA\nestimated that many SRIs would choose to comply with the\nMACT standards by segregating their waste instead of by\ninstalling expensive control technologies. See Jones Mem.\n\f                              60\n\nThe Agency also determined that waste segregation was\npossible for SRIs because their waste often contained\nmaterials that could be recycled. Id. Finally, the Agency\nfactored in any additional variance in emissions from these\nunits by calculating the MACT floors according to the UPL\nformula described at supra §§ I.B.1.a, IV.C. For these\nreasons, the Agency contends, it did not need to consider\nfurther any variation in emissions that might be caused by\ndifferences in waste inputs for SRIs.\n\n     The EPA has the better argument, based on both text and\nprecedent. Textually, waste segregation plainly can be a\n“method[]” for “removal” of pollutants “before” combustion.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(3). Accordingly, the EPA, when\nsetting MACT floors, could not have looked solely to\ntechnologies used to reduce emissions during combustion.\nAccord Sierra Club v. EPA (Sierra Club II), 479 F.3d 875,\n883 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (per curiam). Instead, the plain\nlanguage of section 7429(a)(3) requires the Agency to\nconsider whether emission reductions can be achieved by\nnon-combustion-related controls such as using cleaner fuels\nor waste inputs. Accord id. The statute supports the approach\nthat the Agency took here.\n\n    Our holding in Sierra Club II confirms that our\nconclusion is correct.      In that case, the EPA had\nacknowledged that kilns emitted lower levels of pollutants\nwhen burning cleaner clay but nevertheless based MACT\nstandards only on the emission reductions achieved by control\ntechnology during the combustion process. Id. at 882. The\nAgency explained that clean clay existed only in certain areas\nand that transportation of the clay over long distances was\nimpractical. Id. The EPA therefore considered only those\nemission reductions that were attributable to “deliberate steps\n\f                              61\n\nkiln operators [took] to reduce emissions rather than to the\n‘happenstance’ of being located near cleaner clay.” Id. at\n883. But we rejected that approach, finding that “the Clean\nAir Act requires neither an intentional action nor a deliberate\nstrategy to reduce emissions.” Id. Instead, where “non-\ntechnology factors” affect emission levels, we held the EPA\nmust consider those effects when setting MACT floors. Id.\n\n     Applying that same reasoning, the EPA acted reasonably\nwhen it decided to consider the emissions reduction that could\nbe achieved by waste segregation in SRI units before\ncombustion.      This is true even if an element of\n“happenstance” plays into an SRI unit’s ability to segregate\nits waste. And, had the EPA instead determined that the best\nperformers were those SRI units that most effectively reduced\npollutants only during combustion, as the Industry Petitioners\nsuggest, the resulting MACT standards may have run afoul of\nour holding in Sierra Club II. We cannot, as a result, find the\nAgency’s choice to avoid that outcome unreasonable.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners’ second argument also comes up\nshort. According to Petitioners, the EPA selected the best\nperformers for SRIs merely because those units happened to\nbe burning batches of cleaner waste at the time of the\nemissions test. They claim this happenstance resulted in test\ndata that did not reasonably estimate the typical performance\nof the units, and thus misidentified the best performers. See\nCement Kiln, 255 F.3d at 862 (finding that although the EPA\nhas authority to estimate which units perform best, its\nmethodology must “provide[] an accurate picture of the\nrelevant sources’ actual performance”). Petitioners further\nargue that the Agency’s use of the UPL method to account for\nvariability did not fix this problem because the EPA applies\nthat method only after identifying the best performers.\n\f                             62\n\n    If the record supported this argument, it might well be\npersuasive; in NACWA, we accepted a similar contention that\nthe EPA’s dataset for determining MACT floors must fairly\nrepresent a unit’s typical performance. See 734 F.3d at 1146.\nBut the record here does not support the Industry Petitioners’\nposition. None of the evidence on which Petitioners rely can\nbear the weight they would have us place on it.\n\n    First, Petitioners cite evidence indicating that XTO\nEnergy, which operates the incinerator that the EPA deemed\nthe best performer for SO2, was burning low-sulfur “waste\nwood, cardboard, and oily waste” during the relevant test\nruns. See ConocoPhillips Co., Comment on EPA’s Proposed\nNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants,\nEPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0119 (Feb. 12, 2012) (No. 11-1125 J.A.\n1036). But the record does not show that the resulting test\ndata were unrepresentative of XTO’s typical performance\nbecause the record says nothing about what XTO typically\nburns. Id.\n\n     Second, Petitioners note that Drift River, the unit the\nEPA deemed the worst performer for SO2, had emissions\nresults similar to XTO Energy’s when burning low-sulfur\nwaste, but results over 1,000 times higher when burning high-\nsulfur waste. See id. (No. 11-1125 J.A. 1032-33). But again,\nthe record does not say anything about the type of waste Drift\nRiver typically burns or its sulfur content; it merely\ndemonstrates that the unit’s test results varied greatly from\none run to the next. See id.\n\n    Third, Petitioners point to additional test data they\nprovided for the Kuparuk unit, a source that met the EPA’s\nMACT standards for NOx. See id. (No. 11-1125 J.A. 1017,\n1027-28). They claim this data shows that the Kuparuk unit\n\f                              63\n\n“consistently” emits NOx levels exceeding that standard when\nburning sewage sludge. Id. This claim is both factually\nuntrue—as the data reveals exceedances on only one day—\nand says nothing about whether the test data that the EPA\nused was representative of Kuparuk’s typical performance.\nId.\n\n     Instead, the record supports the EPA’s assertion that it\ngave Petitioners “multiple opportunities” to present data on\nthe variability of waste streams for SRIs, but Petitioners never\nprovided a reasonable empirical basis upon which the Agency\ncould adjust the MACT standards due to this variability. The\nIndustry Petitioners have thus not met their burden to show\nthat the EPA’s test data was unrepresentative of SRI units’\nactual or typical performance.\n\n     In sum, no record evidence suggests that the current SRI\nemission standards are not achievable.           The Industry\nPetitioners instead offer only general statements about the\n“small batch” nature of SRIs and the difficulty of using waste\nsegregation or other controls in remote locations. These\nfactors alone do not call into question the EPA’s assertion that\ncontrols such as waste segregation and technology upgrades\nare a feasible means of achieving compliance with the MACT\nfloors that it established. See 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 15,730 (explaining that the MACT floors will require SRIs\nto employ “the best demonstrated technologies that are\ntechnologically feasible at these facilities,” such as\nafterburners and waste segregation, and noting that such\ncontrols “are sufficient to meet the MACT floor limits”). As\na result, the EPA’s action here was reasonable; the Agency\ndid not need to account further for waste stream variance in\nsetting MACT floor standards for these SRI units.\n\f                              64\n\n          F. CARBON MONOXIDE AS A SURROGATE\n\n     In setting MACT standards for major boilers, the EPA\nused carbon monoxide (CO) as a surrogate for several of the\nHAPs that the Agency was required to regulate. A surrogate\nis another chemical that stands in as a proxy for the regulated\nHAP when the EPA sets numeric emission standards. The\nEPA regulates the surrogate in order to regulate the HAP,\nsometimes because the HAP itself is too difficult to measure.\n\n    We have previously approved the use of surrogates where\nthe EPA’s choice of a surrogate for the HAP is “reasonable.”\nSee, e.g., Nat’l Lime Ass’n, 233 F.3d at 637. Here, the\nIndustry Petitioners claim the EPA’s use of CO as a surrogate\nwas not reasonable for a particular type of emissions—\norganic HAP emissions from coal-fired boilers—for two\nreasons. First, the EPA based the MACT standards on\ndatasets that contained numerous “non-detects” for these\norganic HAPs. Second, the Agency failed to explain why it\nused CO as a surrogate for major boilers, but used work-\npractice standards to regulate similar emissions from other\ntypes of boilers in another rule. We find no merit in either\nargument and, accordingly, deny this challenge.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners base their first argument on a\ndeficiency in the EPA’s dataset for coal-fired boilers’\nemissions—i.e., the dataset contained numerous “non-detects”\nfor organic HAP emissions. A test result is considered a\n“non-detect” when emissions testing returns a value below\nthat which the test methods are capable of detecting.\nAccording to the Industry Petitioners, multiple non-detects in\na dataset demonstrate that it is “not feasible” to set a numeric\nemission standard for the affected HAP. As a result, they\nargue, the EPA should have set work-practice standards for\n\f                              65\n\nthese HAPs under section 7412(h)(2), which permits the EPA\nto set such standards when it is “not feasible” to set a numeric\nemission standard. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(h)(2).\n\n     This argument fails because Petitioners have not\nexplained how the non-detects here made setting numeric\nemissions “not feasible,” as that term is defined in the CAA.\nThe CAA expresses a clear preference for MACT emission\nstandards and limits the EPA’s ability to fashion more flexible\nwork-practice standards.        Compare id. § 7412(d)(3)\n(providing that emission standards “shall not be less\nstringent” than the MACT floor), with id. § 7412(h)(1)\n(permitting work-practice standards only if MACT standards\nare “not feasible”). To set a work-practice standard for these\nemissions, in fact, the EPA would need to find that it is\ninfeasible to set a numeric standard for a particular HAP. Id.\n§ 7412(h)(1). And, as relevant here, the statute defines setting\na numeric standard as “not feasible” where “the application of\nmeasurement methodology to a particular class of sources is\nnot practicable due to technological and economic\nlimitations.” Id. § 7412(h)(2)(B).\n\n     This is a high bar and Petitioners have not demonstrated\nthat the non-detects they have identified meet it. During\nnotice and comment, the Agency reasonably explained that\nnon-detects are present in many of its datasets because they\nare inherent to the imprecision associated with measuring\nboiler emissions. See, e.g., 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,623. The EPA’s scientific conclusion that its data\nwas nevertheless sufficient to set numeric standards receives\nan “extreme degree of deference.” Kennecott Greens Creek\nMining Co. v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 476 F.3d 946,\n954-55 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quotations omitted). And the\nIndustry Petitioners never explain here why the particular\n\f                               66\n\nlevel of non-detects found in this dataset nevertheless made a\nnumeric standard infeasible.           Although the Industry\nPetitioners point to several comments asserting that no coal-\nfired boiler could meet the current numeric standards in all\nHAP categories, these general comments say nothing about\nthe relevant question under the statute: whether it was feasible\nto establish numeric standards for organic HAP emissions in\nlight of the non-detects in the coal-fired boiler datasets.\n\n     We also reject the Industry Petitioners’ second argument\nthat the EPA needed to explain why it established work-\npractice standards for other types of boilers in the unrelated\n“Utility MATS” rule. We take an “every tub on its own\nbottom” approach to the EPA’s setting of emission standards\npursuant to the CAA. Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 986. The\nadequacy of the underlying justification offered by the\nAgency is what matters in an arbitrary-and-capricious\nreview—not what the Agency did on a different record\nconcerning a different industry. Id. As a result, we cannot\nfind that it was unreasonable for the EPA to use CO as a\nsurrogate in setting numeric standards for coal-fired boilers on\nthis basis. Nor can we find that the EPA was required on\nreconsideration to explain the discrepancy between its\napproach to organic HAP emissions in these two rules, as\nPetitioners assert. See id. at 987 (“EPA could have noted\nwhere the bases for its decision in this case differed from\nthose with respect to other decisions in other cases, as was\ndone in the EPA’s brief to this court . . . but such explanations\nare not required given the different contexts of the various\nrulemakings.”).\n\f                              67\n\n   G. HEALTH-BASED EMISSIONS LIMITATION FOR HCL\n\n     In the Major Boiler Rule, the EPA chose not to exercise\nits discretion to create more lenient emission standards for\nhydrogen chloride (HCl) based on health. The Industry\nPetitioners challenge this decision as arbitrary and capricious\nbecause, they claim, the Agency considered impermissible\nfactors in reaching the decision and departed from its previous\nposition without adequate justification. We disagree and hold\nthe EPA reasonably chose not to establish a health-based\nemissions limitation for HCl.\n\n      The EPA generally must establish emission standards for\nall listed pollutants emitted from a source category based on\nwhat the best performing similar sources have achieved, i.e.,\nthe MACT floor. The Agency, however, may consider\nadopting alternative health-based emission standards—which\nare more lenient—for pollutants with an established health\nthreshold. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(4). The statutory\nlanguage permitting these alternative standards is\ndiscretionary, providing that “[w]ith respect to pollutants for\nwhich a health threshold has been established, the\nAdministrator may consider such threshold level, with an\nample margin of safety, when establishing emission standards\nunder this subsection.” Id. (emphasis added). But, even if the\nEPA considers, in its discretion, a health-based emission\nstandard, the statutory text nowhere requires that the EPA\nadopt a more lenient standard than the MACT floor. This\nprovision thus allows, but does not require, the EPA to adopt\na standard more lenient than the MACT floor, subject to two\ncritical restrictions: the Agency must determine (1) that there\nis an established health threshold, and (2) that the established\nthreshold would provide “an ample margin of safety.”\n\f                              68\n\n     Using this authority, the EPA considered and adopted\nhealth-based emission standards for HCl in an earlier\nrulemaking for major boilers. See 2004 Boilers Rule, 69 Fed.\nReg. at 55,240-41. At the time, the Agency based its decision\non three key findings: a health threshold was established for\nHCl, adverse health effects were unlikely at emissions below\nthat level, and low HCl emissions from major source boilers\nmade HCl a “particularly well-suited” candidate for more\nlenient standards. Id. at 55,241. The EPA also said, however,\nthat it was not embracing a general policy for HCl, but would\ninstead “undertake in each individual rule to determine\nwhether it is appropriate to exercise [the Agency’s]\ndiscretion” to adopt such standards. Id. We later vacated that\nrule without considering the merits of the EPA’s HCl\ndecision. See NRDC I, 489 F.3d 1250.\n\n     The EPA again chose to consider a health-based standard\nfor HCl in the current rulemaking, but this time declined to set\nsuch a standard. 2010 Major Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at\n32,030. The EPA explained that it continued to interpret its\nauthority under section 7412(d)(4) to require that it find a\nhealth threshold exists, with an ample margin of safety, before\nusing its discretion to depart from an established MACT floor.\nId. The Agency reasoned further that, even if it made a\nfinding that a health threshold exists, the discretionary nature\nof the authority allowed it to weigh additional factors when\nchoosing whether to adopt the more lenient health-based\nstandard. Id. Those factors included: the potential for\ncumulative adverse health effects due to concurrent exposure\nto other HAPs or emissions from other nearby sources;\npotential impacts of increased emissions on ecosystems; and\nreductions in emissions of other pollutants, also known as\n“co-benefits,” achieved through enforcement of the HCl\nMACT floor. Id. at 32,030-31.\n\f                              69\n\n     Applying this interpretation, the EPA suggested in its\nproposed rule that a health-based standard for HCl might not\nbe appropriate because these additional health and\nenvironmental considerations cautioned against a more lenient\nemission standard. Id. at 32,031. The Agency acknowledged,\nin particular, that its decision in the 2004 rule was based on\ndata that considered only the chronic respiratory effects of\nHCl exposure. Id. While affirming the validity of those\nfindings, the EPA explained that those chronic impact studies\ndid not consider the additional variables it had now identified,\nnor did it consider the potential acute or carcinogenic effects\nthat might be caused by HCl exposure. Id. And, because of\nthese potential (though unproven) risks, the Agency resolved\nthat it currently lacked sufficient information to establish an\nHCl emission standard that would protect health with an\nample margin of safety. Id. It thus requested additional data\nfrom stakeholders and the regulated community to help\naddress its concerns, including information regarding the\npotential cumulative effects of HCl emissions from boilers\nand other nearby sources. Id.\n\n     After receiving numerous comments on the issue, the\nEPA declined to set a health-based standard in the final rule\nfor two primary reasons: (1) the comments had not provided\nsufficient data on potential cumulative health and\nenvironmental effects caused by HCl emissions from boilers\nand other nearby sources; and (2) the comments affirmed the\npotential co-benefits that limiting HCl emissions might have\nin lowering emissions of other HAP and non-HAP pollutants.\n2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,643-44.\nAccording to the EPA, its consideration of these co-benefits\nwas not a regulation of other pollutants; rather, it was simply\nchoosing not to ignore the purpose of the CAA—to reduce the\nnegative health and environmental effects of HAP\n\f                              70\n\nemissions—when exercising its discretionary authority under\nthe Act. Id. at 15,644.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners contend that the EPA’s\nconsideration of the broad potential health and environmental\nimpacts of HCl rendered the Agency’s decision arbitrary and\ncapricious. In particular, they argue that the Agency based its\ndecision on two impermissible factors that were not supported\nby the record: (1) the potential cumulative effects of\nemissions from boilers and other nearby sources, and (2) the\nco-benefits of setting a more stringent MACT floor standard\nfor HCl. We disagree on both counts.\n\n     The statutory text and purpose of section 7412(d)(4)\namply support the Agency’s decision to consider potential\ncumulative risks associated with emissions from boilers and\nother nearby sources. Although other CAA provisions require\nthe EPA to set emission standards based on the emissions\nfrom a particular source, section 7412(d)(4)’s plain language\nis not focused on emissions from any particular source.\nCompare 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(3) (instructing the EPA to set\nemission standards for sources at the level achieved in\npractice by the best controlled similar source), with id.\n§ 7412(d)(4) (containing no mention of emissions from a\nparticular source).      The EPA’s consideration of the\ncumulative impacts from these emissions is also relevant to\nthe Agency’s statutory mandate to ensure that a health\nthreshold would protect health with an “ample margin of\nsafety.” As such, the Agency had discretion to consider the\npotential risks associated with the cumulative emissions of\nboilers and other nearby sources under this provision.\n\n    The EPA was likewise free to consider potential co-\nbenefits that might be achieved from enforcing the HCl\n\f                             71\n\nMACT floor. Section 7412(d)(4)’s text does not foreclose the\nAgency from considering co-benefits and doing so is\nconsistent with the CAA’s purpose—to reduce the health and\nenvironmental impacts of hazardous air pollutants. The\nAgency was under no obligation to ignore the CAA’s purpose\nin making a final decision on whether to exercise a\ndiscretionary authority.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners attempt to refute this\nstraightforward conclusion by pointing to “restrictions” in\nanother provision, section 7412(d)(2). No. 11-1108 Indus.\nPet’rs’ Br. 55-56. This provision requires the EPA to\nconsider costs, non-air quality health and environmental\nimpacts, and energy requirements in setting maximum\nachievable emission standards. Petitioners contend that these\nsame “restrictions” must be read into section 7412(d)(4). But,\neven if we assume Petitioners are correct that these factors\nrestrict the Agency’s ability to consider other factors under\nsection 7412(d)(2), that provision furthers the statute’s\ncommand to set the strictest possible emission standards\nabove what has already been achieved (i.e., the MACT\nfloors). Section 7412(d)(4), by contrast, is a permissive\nauthority for the EPA to abandon already achieved emission\nstandards. We do not read limits on the EPA’s authority to\nset more stringent standards into a provision laying out the\nEPA’s authority to set more lenient standards. If anything,\nthe difference between the provisions cuts the other way.\nSection 7412(d)(4) does not specify the factors that\nPetitioners argue for, while section 7412(d)(2) does. This\ndifference shows that Congress knew how to provide such\nlimits where it found them necessary. We thus find no basis\nto conclude that the EPA could not consider potential\ncumulative effects or co-benefits in rejecting a more lenient\nhealth-based HCl standard.\n\f                              72\n\n     Finally, the Industry Petitioners claim that the EPA’s\ndecision was arbitrary because the Agency failed to support\nits reversal from the 2004 rule, in which it set health-based\nemission standards for HCl. Because the EPA changed its\nposition, the Petitioners contend that the Agency had to\npresent factual support for its decision to disregard the facts\nand circumstances that underlay its prior adoption of a health-\nbased HCl standard. See FCC v. Fox Television Stations,\nInc., 556 U.S. 502, 516 (2009). The Agency failed to do this,\nPetitioners say, because it relied on a data gap regarding the\npotential cumulative effects of HCl exposure. But this\nargument fares no better than Petitioners’ first.\n\n     At the outset, Petitioners misstate the EPA’s burden to\njustify its change in policy. Although an agency does not\ngenerally need to provide a more substantial explanation or\nreason for a policy change than for any other action, it must\ndo so where “its new policy rests upon factual findings that\ncontradict those which underlay its prior policy.” Id. at 515.\nIn that circumstance, “it is not that further justification is\ndemanded by the mere fact of policy change; but that a\nreasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and\ncircumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior\npolicy.” Id. at 515-16. The EPA, therefore, was not required\nto refute the factual underpinnings of its prior policy with new\nfactual data. The Agency only needed to provide a reasoned\nexplanation for discounting the importance of the facts that it\nhad previously relied upon. Id.\n\n    The EPA did so here by explaining that its prior decision\nfocused too narrowly on the chronic respiratory effects of HCl\nemissions without considering the broader implications of\nsuch emissions on health and environmental conditions. See\n2010 Proposed Major Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,030-\n\f                              73\n\n31. In so doing, the EPA neither contradicted nor abandoned\nthe factual findings it made in its earlier rulemaking. It\ninstead acknowledged that those findings were more limited\nthan what it now considered necessary to justify the exercise\nof its discretion to set a health-based standard. Id. For\nexample, the Agency noted that: (1) little research had been\ndone on HCl’s carcinogenicity or on the toxicity of mixtures\nof HCl and other respiratory irritants emitted from boilers;\nand (2) the Agency had no data about peak short-term\nemissions of HCl from major boilers that might create risks of\nacute exposure. Id.\n\n     These enumerated concerns were sufficient to support the\nAgency’s decision not to adopt a health-based standard.\nSection 7412(d)(4) does not require that the EPA present\naffirmative factual data to reject a health-based standard. The\nprovision requires just the opposite: in order to impose a\nhealth-based standard, the Agency must find that a health\nthreshold can be set that provides an ample margin of safety.\nThe EPA here determined that it could not do so, in part\nbecause it lacked relevant data like that discussed above.\n2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,643-44. In other\nwords, the EPA could not determine that any health threshold\nwould provide an ample margin of safety to protect health.\nWithout such a finding, the EPA could not invoke its\ndiscretionary authority under the statute. Id. There was thus\nnothing impermissible in the EPA’s reliance on a lack of data\nin rejecting a more lenient health-based standard. The EPA’s\ndecision not to adopt health-based emission standards for HCl\nwas not arbitrary and capricious.\n\f                               74\n\n  H. EMISSIONS AVERAGING OF MULTIPLE CISWI UNITS\n                  IN ONE FACILITY\n\n     Certain industry entities urged the EPA to allow facilities\nwith more than one CISWI unit to demonstrate MACT\ncompliance by showing that the average HAP emissions\nacross all units at that location fell under the relevant cap.\nThey pointed to the EPA’s allowance of emissions averaging\nin the Major Boilers Rule but the Agency defended its\ndisparate treatment because, in its view, “[t]he applicability of\nCISWI is such that each unit is an affected facility.” See 2011\nProposed CISWI Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n80,463. It subsequently elaborated that it did “not believe [it\nhas] the legal authority to allow emissions averaging in\nCISWI or under section [7429] generally because each\nindividual unit is an affected facility.” CISWI Rule—\nResponses to Comments, at 195-96. The Industry Petitioners\nchallenge the disallowance of facility-wide averaging for\nCISWIs, arguing that “unit” cannot mean “facility” because\nsection 7429(g)(1) defines “solid waste incineration unit” as\n“a distinct operating unit of any facility” and therefore the\nEPA’s rule fails Chevron step 1. They also argue the EPA’s\nconflation of “unit” and “facility” is unreasonable, and thus\nviolates Chevron step 2, because the EPA has allowed\nemissions averaging in a different section 7429 rule and in a\nnumber of section 7412 rules.\n\n     Although the Industry Petitioners’ point is well taken—\nthe plain terms of the CAA foreclose the EPA’s conflation of\na CISWI “unit” and “affected facility,” see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7429(g)(1) (“facility” is comprised of “units”)—we agree\nthat the EPA has no statutory authority to allow emissions\n\f                                 75\n\naveraging under section 7429.18 Section 7429 requires the\nEPA to regulate emissions from all “solid waste incineration\nunits,” 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2); see also id. § 7429(a)(4), and\nthe CAA defines a “solid waste incinerator unit” as “a distinct\noperating unit” of a “facility,” id. § 7429(g)(1) (emphasis\nadded). In other words, because the CAA mandates that the\nEPA regulate each “distinct” CISWI unit in a “facility,” the\nEPA cannot allow emissions averaging of all CISWI units in\na facility. See id.\n\n     For this reason, the Industry Petitioners’ Chevron\nchallenge fails, notwithstanding the EPA’s minimal\nexplanation set forth in its proposed CISWI Rule. It is\naxiomatic that an agency must “articulate[] an adequate\nexplanation for its action,” Int’l Fabricare Inst. v. EPA, 972\nF.2d 384, 389 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (emphasis added); see also\nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 48, but the EPA’s failure to do so\nhere cannot create statutory authority that does not exist. And\nbecause the EPA has no authority under section 7429 to allow\nemissions averaging of multiple CISWI units in one facility,\nthe Petitioners’ Chevron argument does not carry the day.19\n\n\n     18\n         The EPA does have statutory authority under section 7412\nto allow facility-wide emissions averaging in the Major Boilers\nRule. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(a)(1) (“major source[s]” defined as\n“any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within\na contiguous area and under common control” (emphasis added));\nsee also id. § 7411(a)(3) (“stationary source” defined as “any\nbuilding, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit\nany air pollutant”).\n     19\n       The EPA concedes that it once allowed, in a different rule,\nemissions averaging for units subject to section 7429 but has since\nconcluded that it does not have the statutory authority to do so.\nAlthough the Industry Petitioners argue that the Agency arbitrarily\n\f                                76\n\n        IV. ENVIRONMENTAL PETITIONERS’\n                  CHALLENGES\n\n          A. CARBON MONOXIDE AS A SURROGATE\n\n      As explained at supra §§ I.B.1 and III.F, the EPA used\ncarbon monoxide (CO) as a surrogate for several non-\ndioxin/furan organic HAPs when the Agency set the MACT\nfloors for major boilers. In support of this approach, the EPA\nfound that both CO and these HAPs were the products of\n“incomplete combustion.” 2010 Proposed Major Boilers\nRule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,018. The Agency concluded as a\nresult that CO was a reasonable surrogate because:\n(1) minimizing CO emissions would minimize these HAPs;\n(2) methods used for the control of these HAP emissions\nwould be the same methods used to control CO emissions\n(i.e., good combustion or using an oxidation catalyst);\n(3) standards limiting CO emissions would result in decreases\nin these HAP emissions; and (4) establishing emission limits\nfor individual organic HAPs would be impractical and costly.\nId. Although several commenters challenged aspects of this\nreasoning, the EPA ultimately stuck with its decision to use\nCO as a surrogate for non-dioxin/furan organic HAP\nemissions, without further explanation, in the final Major\nBoilers Rule. See 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at\n7,145 (explaining the EPA was denying Sierra Club’s petition\nto reconsider the suitability of CO as a surrogate for non-\norganic HAPs based on the reasoning provided by the Agency\nin the 2010 proposed rule).\n\n\nchanged its position, the fact that the EPA may have acted outside\nits authority in a rule is not at issue here. “[P]revious statutory\nviolations,” of course, “cannot excuse” new ones. New Jersey v.\nEPA, 517 F.3d 574, 583 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\f                              77\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners challenge this decision,\narguing that the EPA has not adequately explained how\nsetting emission standards for CO will accomplish what the\nstatute plainly requires: that the EPA set emission standards\nfor organic HAPs at the average level achieved by the best\nperformers with regard to those HAPs. We agree and remand\nto the EPA to adequately explain how CO acts as a reasonable\nsurrogate for non-dioxin/furan organic HAPs. We do not,\nhowever, vacate the current emission standards because we\nconclude that the Agency will likely be able to adequately\nexplain its decision on remand and that vacatur would prove\nsubstantially disruptive.\n\n     The EPA may use a surrogate to regulate HAPs under\nsection 7412 where “reasonable.” See, e.g., Nat’l Lime Ass’n,\n233 F.3d at 637. To be reasonable, the emission standard set\nfor the surrogate must reflect what the best source or best 12\nper cent of sources in the relevant subcategory achieved with\nregard to the HAP. See Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 984. This\nrequires the surrogate’s emissions to share a close relationship\nwith the emissions of the HAP. Id. One crucial factor we\nhave identified for determining whether that close relationship\nexists is the availability of alternative control technologies.\nSee id. at 985. These technologies regulate the HAP without\nimpacting a surrogate’s emissions, or regulate the surrogate\nwithout impacting the HAP. Id. As we have explained, the\nimportance of this factor to our reasonableness analysis “is\nclear: if EPA looks only to [the surrogate], but HAPs are\nreduced [in another] way that does not reduce [the surrogate],\nthe best achieving sources, and what they can achieve with\nrespect to HAPs, might not be properly identified.” Id.\n\n    In the Major Boilers Rule, the EPA proposed using CO as\na surrogate because, as relevant here: (1) the lowest possible\n\f                             78\n\nCO emissions resulted in the lowest possible HAP emissions,\nand (2) the same combustion and oxidation control methods\nreduce both types of emissions. See 2010 Proposed Major\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,018. But, during notice and\ncomment, the EPA failed to directly consider and respond to\nseveral comments that introduced evidence suggesting that\nother control technologies and methods could be effectively\nused to reduce HAP emissions without also impacting CO\nemissions, or vice versa. See, e.g., Inst. of Clean Air Cos.,\nComments on National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air\nPollutants for Major Sources, EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0058\n(Aug. 23, 2010), at 20-21 (No. 11-1108 J.A. 822-23);\nResponses to Public Comments on EPA’s National Emission\nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources,\nvol. 2, EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0058 (Feb. 2011) (No. 11-1108\nJ.A. 1033, 1035-36, 1049-52). The EPA ultimately decided to\nuse CO as a surrogate for all non-dioxin/furan organic HAPs\nin its final rule without ever addressing whether such\nalternative control technologies and methods might be used to\nlower organic HAP emissions further. See 2011 Major\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,654; 2013 Major Boilers\nRule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,138. Instead, the Agency responded\nby doubling down on its assertion that both CO and organic\nHAP emissions were the product of poor combustion and, as a\nresult, optimal combustion would minimize the emissions of\nboth CO and non-dioxin/furan organic HAPs. 2013 Major\nBoilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,145. But this response was no\nresponse at all to the substantial concerns raised in the\ncomments that other variables might also affect emissions.\n\n     Although we afford an agency’s scientific decision “an\nextreme degree of deference,” see Kennecott Greens, 476\nF.3d at 954-55 (quoting Hüls Am., Inc. v. Browner, 83 F.3d\n445, 452 (D.C. Cir. 1996)), we cannot uphold an agency\n\f                               79\n\ndecision that does not consider all relevant factors or fails to\nestablish a reasonable connection to the facts in the record.\nCf. Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 51 F.3d 1053, 1064 (D.C. Cir. 1995).\nThe EPA could not conclude that CO acts as a reasonable\nsurrogate in this statutory context without at least considering\na key factor: whether the best performing boilers might be\nusing alternative control technologies and methods that\nreduce organic HAP emissions beyond what they achieve by\nregulating CO alone. See Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 985. We\ntherefore reject the EPA’s contention that its reason for using\nCO as a surrogate—that good combustion would minimize\nboth CO and non-dioxin/furan organic HAP emissions—was\nalone sufficient to support its decision.\n\n     We recognize that there might be a context where a\nsurrogate’s use is reasonable despite the presence of\nalternative control methods or technologies, but the Agency\ndoes not explain why it did not need to even consider whether\nsuch methods might further reduce HAPs here. For example,\nif the EPA used a surrogate that was closely correlated to the\nHAP and set surrogacy emission standards at a level that\nwould eliminate HAP emissions altogether, the Agency might\nnot need to account for alternative control technologies in its\nfinal rule. In that case, the use of the surrogate would not call\ninto question whether the Agency had regulated the HAP as\nrequired by the statute because, after all, nothing is better than\neliminating HAP emissions entirely. But the Agency offers\nus no analogous explanation or supportive data here.\nAlthough it is possible that all of the challenged CO emission\nstandards are in fact set at such a level, the Agency has not\ndefended the rule on such reasoning. Indeed, the Agency\nfailed to consider or even comment directly on this issue,\nincluding whether certain post-combustion processes might\nincrease organic HAP emissions without a corresponding\n\f                             80\n\nincrease in CO emissions.      We cannot ignore such an\noversight in this context.\n\n     We reject, however, the Environmental Petitioners’ other\nargument that combustion-related issues preclude the EPA\nfrom using CO as a surrogate for non-dioxin/furan organic\nHAPs. The Petitioners contend that the EPA’s decision to use\nCO was arbitrary because record evidence demonstrated a\nbreakdown in the correlation between CO and organic HAP\nemissions at CO emission levels below 130 parts per million\n(ppm). But the EPA explained that this apparent breakdown\nwas most likely caused by the difficulty of measuring the\nregulated HAP at such extremely low emission levels, rather\nthan by a flaw in the correlation between CO and organic\nHAPs. 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,144-45;\nMemorandum from Eastern Research Group, Inc. to Jim\nEddinger, EPA, Revised MACT Floor Analysis for the\nIndustrial, Commerical, and Institutional Boilers and Process\nHeaters National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air\nPollutants—Major Source (2012 MACT Floor Memorandum)\n(Aug. 2012), at 11-12 (No. 11-1108 J.A. 1462-63). This is\nprecisely the sort of scientific judgment to which we must\ndefer and accordingly, we do so on this point. See Kennecott\nGreens, 476 F.3d at 954-55. The Environmental Petitioners\nfail to provide any reason to believe that organic HAP\nemissions can, in fact, be accurately measured at such low\nlevels. And the Agency’s explanation also addresses why the\nEPA discounted record evidence regarding extremely high\nburn temperatures that demonstrated a potential breakdown in\nthe CO and organic HAP relationship as HAP emissions\napproached zero.\n\n    Still, the EPA’s failure to address substantial record\nevidence on the potential availability of alternative control\n\f                               81\n\ntechnologies or methods rendered the Agency’s use of CO as\na surrogate for certain organic HAPs arbitrary and capricious.\nWe thus remand the portion of the Major Boilers Rule\nproviding for CO’s use as a surrogate for non-dioxin/furan\norganic HAPs to the Agency for further consideration. We do\nnot, however, vacate the current emission standards based on\nCO’s use as a surrogate. We may remand without vacatur\nwhere there is a likelihood of (1) cure on remand, and (2) a\nsubstantial disruptive effect that would result from vacatur.\nSee Heartland Reg’l Med. Ctr. v. Sebelius, 566 F.3d 193, 197-\n98 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Here, vacatur would cause substantial\ndisruptive effects by removing emission limits for the\nregulated HAPs. And it is likely that the EPA will be able to\nadequately explain its use of CO on remand after properly\nconsidering the matter. As a result, we decline to vacate the\ncurrent standards in the interim.\n\nB. EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN UNITS FROM MACT ANALYSIS\n\n     In the Major Boilers Rule, the EPA created subcategories\nbased primarily on the fuel combusted. See 2013 Major\nBoilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,142. To qualify for certain\nsubcategories, the EPA required that a source burn a fuel\nmixture comprised of only 10 per cent of the subcategory-\ndefining fuel. See, e.g., id. at 7,193 (“Unit designed to burn\nsolid fuel subcategory means any boiler . . . that burns . . . at\nleast 10 percent solid fuel . . . in combination with liquid fuels\nor gaseous fuels.” (emphasis added)). Notwithstanding the\nlow bar for inclusion, we conclude, and discuss at greater\nlength below, see infra § IV.J, that the EPA reasonably\nexercised its discretion when it subcategorized boilers this\nway.\n\f                             82\n\n     We cannot say the same about the EPA’s exclusion of\ncertain high-performing units from its MACT-floor\ncalculation. Although the EPA allowed sources that combust\nonly 10 per cent of a subcategory-defining fuel to join that\nsubcategory, it declined to consider emissions from any\nsource that burned less than 90 per cent of the subcategory-\ndefining fuel when determining the average emissions level of\nthe best performing sources in setting MACT floors for\nexisting sources. And when it set a subcategory’s MACT\nfloors for new sources, the Agency declined to consider the\nemissions levels from any source that did not burn 100\nper cent of the fuel. This disparate treatment makes a\ndifference; several sources excluded from the MACT-floor\ndetermination were among the best performing sources (or, in\nsome cases, the single best performing source) in that fuel-\nbased subcategory.\n\n     The CAA, however, demands that source subcategories\ntake the bitter with the sweet. Section 7412 mandates,\nwithout ambiguity, that the EPA set the MACT floor at the\nlevel achieved by the best performing source, or the average\nof the best performing sources, in a subcategory. See 42\nU.S.C. § 7412(d)(3)(A), (B). It thus follows that if the EPA\nincludes a source in a subcategory, it must take into account\nthat source’s emissions levels in setting the MACT floor.\n\n     The Agency, however, claims discretion to omit from\nMACT-floor computation sources it considers dissimilar. In\nsupport, it cites section 7412(d)(3), which provides that\nMACT standards must be no less stringent than “the best\ncontrolled similar source, as determined by the [EPA].” Id.\n§ 7412(d)(3) (emphases added). Our decision in Sierra Club\nII, 479 F.3d 875, however, forecloses this argument. In\nSierra Club II, the EPA set MACT standards for brick and\n\f                               83\n\nceramic kilns. Id. at 879. For some subcategories, the EPA\nbased its MACT-floor determination on “the pollution control\ndevices used by the second-best performers,” not the best\nperformers. Id. (emphasis added). Although the EPA argued\nthat it “reasonably construe[d] the term ‘best performing’ . . .\nto allow it to consider whether retrofitting kilns with a\nparticular pollution control technology is technically\nfeasible,” id. at 880 (alterations in original), we held that the\nEPA could not circumvent the requirement that it base the\nMACT floor “on the emission level actually achieved by the\nbest performers (those with the lowest emission levels).” Id.\nat 880-81 (citing Cement Kiln, 255 F.3d at 861) (emphasis in\noriginal). We reach the same conclusion here.\n\n     The EPA tries to distinguish Sierra Club II, arguing that\nthe issue in that case “was whether [the] EPA could exclude\nall units using the most-effective emission control technique\nbecause it might not be applicable to all existing units”;\nhowever, “[h]ere, [the] EPA is excluding a test result that is\nunrepresentative of typical operations of units in the\nsubcategory, and thus is inappropriate to use in establishing\nthe MACT floor.” No. 11-1108 EPA Br. 81. But it makes no\ndifference whether the EPA exempts from consideration units\nwith certain highly effective technology or units with\nimpressive test results driven by the fuel combination it\ncombusts. Either approach contravenes our holding in Sierra\nClub II that the EPA cannot ignore “the emission level\nactually achieved by the best performers (those with the\nlowest emission levels)” in the subcategory. 479 F.3d at 880\n(emphasis omitted). In any event, the EPA has not simply\nexcluded aberrant test results; it has excluded an entire class\nof units—those burning less than 90 per cent of the\nsubcategory’s fuel—even though every one of those units fits\n\f                                84\n\nthe subcategory’s parameters. This is no different from what\nwe rejected in Sierra Club II.\n\n     The EPA insists that if a source is “unrepresentative of\ntypical operations of units in the subcategory,” it is\n“inappropriate to use [it] in establishing the MACT floor.”\nNo. 11-1108 EPA Br. 81. Not so. “The idea is to set limits\nthat, as an initial matter, require all sources in a category to at\nleast clean up their emissions to the level that their best\nperforming peers have shown can be achieved.” Sierra Club\nI, 353 F.3d at 980 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(3)). For this\nreason, an unusually high-performing source should be\nconsidered; indeed its performance suggests that a more\nstringent MACT standard is appropriate. Accordingly, we\nvacate the MACT standards for all major boiler subcategories\nthat would have been affected had the EPA considered all\nsources included in the subcategories.20\n\n                 C. UPPER PREDICTION LIMIT\n\n     Sections 7412 and 7429 create MACT-floor criteria that,\nfor our purpose, are materially the same. Compare 42 U.S.C.\n\n    20\n          In its brief, the EPA argued that the Environmental\nPetitioners’ challenge was moot either because the challenged\nMACT standards had been remanded for other reasons or because\ninclusion of the allegedly dissimilar sources would not have\naffected the MACT standard. During oral argument, however, it\nconceded that it misunderstood the scope of the Petitioners’\nargument, which argument challenges unremanded MACT\nstandards that have in fact been affected by the EPA’s decision to\nomit certain high-performing sources from its MACT-floor\nanalysis. See Oral Arg. Recording pt. B at 48:28-49:22. We\nbelieve that the Environmental Petitioners’ challenge is not moot\nand has not been waived.\n\f                               85\n\n§ 7412(d), with id. § 7429(a)(2). In both provisions, the CAA\nmandates that MACT floors have maximum stringency but\nalso be continuously achievable. See id. § 7412(d)(2), (k); id.\n§ 7429(a)(2); id. § 7602(k). Satisfying the statutory criteria is\nno easy task, especially because no source emits any HAPs at\na constant level. See Page Mem. 6. Rather, emissions levels\nfluctuate over time and for many reasons. See id. at 3.21 We\nhave held, see Mossville Envtl. Action Now v. EPA, 370 F.3d\n1232, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 2004), and recently reaffirmed, see\nNACWA, 734 F.3d at 1133-34, that the EPA can consider this\nvariability when setting MACT floors.\n\n      Further complicating the task is the way in which sources\ntypically measure emissions. Virtually all of the data the EPA\ncollects to set MACT floors come from the three-run stack\ntest. Page Mem. 6. The three-run stack test, as the name\nsuggests, involves three measurements of the source’s\nemissions taken over a short time period (i.e., no more than a\nfew days) with each of the three test “runs” lasting from one\nhour to four hours. Id. at 3. Because the tests provide three\n“snapshots” of a source’s emissions performance, they cannot\naccurately represent the source’s full range of emissions over\nall times and under all conditions. Id. at 3-4. Because stack\ntesting typically involves “three separate runs,” however, it\n“will in most cases show some of a particular source’s\n\n\n\n\n    21\n        See also Page Mem. 2-3 (“This variability occurs due to a\nnumber of factors, including measurement variability (both\nsampling and analysis) and short term fluctuations in the emission\nlevels that result from short-term changes in fuels, processes,\ncombustion conditions, and controls.”).\n\f                                86\n\nvariability over the short period of time during which testing\nwas conducted.” Id. at 6 (emphasis added).22\n\n         1. NACWA, 734 F.3d 1115 (D.C. Cir. 2013)\n\n     Based on the limitations inherent in stack testing, the\nEPA concluded that it could not set MACT floors based on\nthat testing alone. It began using the UPL to account for the\nHAPs-emissions variety that stack-testing data do not reflect.\nSee NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1122. The Agency did so in several\nrules promulgated in 2011, including not only the Major\nBoilers Rule and the CISWI Rule but also the Sewage Sludge\nIncinerator Rule addressed in NACWA. See id. In that case,\nthe petitioners challenged the EPA’s UPL use, arguing that\nthe Agency failed to establish that the UPL fairly represented\nthe “average emissions limitation achieved” by the best\nperforming sources to set the Sewage Sludge Incinerator\nMACT floors and, accordingly, was “unlawful and arbitrary.”\nId. at 1130. We agreed in part. See id. at 1119.\n\n     Specifically, we struggled to pin down the EPA’s precise\ninterpretation of the phrase “average emissions limitation\nachieved by the best performing 12 percent of units.” Id. at\n1142-43 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2)).23 As best we\ncould tell, the EPA defended its use of the UPL as follows:\n“[b]ecause the [UPL] represents the value which [the EPA]\n\n    22\n        See also Page Mem. 5 (“[E]ven single three run tests, which\nare performed over a short period of time, typically show different\nemissions levels during each individual test run.”).\n    23\n         See also NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1142 (“[I]t seems EPA has\nadopted yet another interpretation of the phrase ‘average emissions\nlimitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of units.’”\n(emphasis added)).\n\f                                 87\n\ncan expect the mean (i.e., average) of three future\nobservations (3-run average) to fall below, based upon the\nresults of the independent sample size from the same\npopulation, the [UPL] reflects average emissions.” Id. at\n1142 (quoting Standards of Performance for New Stationary\nSources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources:\nSewage Sludge Incineration Units, 76 Fed. Reg. 15,372,\n15,389 (Mar. 21, 2011)) (emphasis added) (some alteration in\noriginal). In our view, however, “the word ‘average’ . . .\nseems to mean the average emissions limitation that the\nexisting population of the best-performing 12 percent of\nincinerators has achieved.” Id. (emphases added).\n\n     Despite these doubts, we reasoned that the EPA could\nhave “plausibl[y]” concluded that the UPL represents the\n“average emissions limitation achieved” by the best\nperforming sources. Id. at 1143. That said, we were not\nwilling to assume the EPA’s responsibility of “supply[ing] a\nreasoned basis” for its UPL use. Id. (quoting Bowman\nTransp., Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281\n(1974)). For that reason, we remanded—but did not vacate,\nsee id. at 1161—the UPL portion of the Sewage Sludge\nIncinerator Rule and ordered the EPA to “clarify how the\n[UPL] represents the average emissions limitation achieved\nby the best performing 12 percent.” Id. at 1143 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).24\n\n\n\n    24\n         See also NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1151 (“[W]hile we determine\nthat [the] EPA’s use of the [UPL] may be lawful, we are remanding\nthis portion of its rulemaking for further explanation on the issue[]\nof how the upper prediction limit represents the average emissions\nlimitation achieved . . . .” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f                                  88\n\n     Because the EPA also used the UPL in the Major Boilers\nRule and the CISWI Rule, the Agency moved for a limited\nremand of the current petitions so that it could include its\nrevised UPL explanation in the administrative records of these\ntwo regulations.25 See Page Mem. 2. On July 14, 2014, the\nEPA published a fifteen-page memorandum authored by\nStephen D. Page, the EPA Director of Air Quality Planning\nand Standards (Page Memorandum), in response to NACWA.\nSee id. at 1. The EPA’s current explication of the UPL is now\nbefore us.26\n\n\n     25\n         In NACWA, we had other problems with the EPA’s use of\nthe UPL. Specifically, the EPA had explained that “a smaller\ndataset may have greater variability, and thus a higher [UPL].”\nNACWA, 734 F.3d at 1144. We instructed the EPA not only to\nexplain its use of the UPL in general but also to “explain why the\n[UPL] could still be considered accurate given a small dataset” in\nparticular. Id. at 1144-45 (emphasis added). In its remand motion,\nthe EPA represented that it could “adequately explain why [its] use\nof the UPL in general is consistent with Clean Air Act requirements\nthrough a remand of the record for a limited time” but that “the\nquestion of whether the UPL is an appropriate statistical method for\nsmall data sets requires more analysis . . . [along with] additional\nnotice and comment rulemaking.” No. 11-1108 Mot. for Remand\n9, 13 (Feb. 28, 2014). We agreed and, for this reason, the only\nissue we decide today is whether the EPA carried its burden of\nestablishing, as a general matter, that the UPL reasonably estimates\nthe average emissions level achieved by the best performing source\nor sources to set MACT floors.\n     26\n         The Environmental Petitioners urge us to ignore the Page\nMemorandum, insisting that it “provide[s] a series of new\ninterpretations and assertions that, rather than ‘explaining’ the prior\nrecord, instead contradict and revise the agency’s earlier position,”\nin contravention of NACWA and the scope of the remand the\nAgency requested regarding the Major Boilers Rule and the CISWI\n\f                                 89\n\n                  2. The Page Memorandum\n\n     The Page Memorandum recognized our “concern about\nthe interpretation [we] believed [the] EPA was taking” of the\nword “average.” Page Mem. 3. It clarified that the Agency\n“does not interpret the term ‘average’” to mean “the average\nof a future 3-run compliance test.” Id. (emphasis added)\n(quoting NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1143). Rather, it explained that\nthe “EPA interprets the average to mean the average\nemissions over time,” based not only on the “average of all\nemissions test data from the best performing source or\nsources” but also on “information regarding the variability of\nemissions.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n    In the EPA’s judgment, “variability is a key factor in\nestablishing” MACT standards because “[e]ach MACT\nstandard is based on limited data from sources whose\nemissions are expected to vary over their long term\n\n\nRule. No. 11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 41. But our NACWA decision\ndid not, as the Petitioners would have it, require the EPA to adopt\nour belief that the Agency construed “average” to mean “the\naverage of a future 3-run compliance test.” See NACWA, 734 F.3d\nat 1143. Rather, we asked the EPA to clarify how, in its view, the\nUPL “represents the ‘average emissions limitation achieved by the\nbest performing 12 percent.’” Id. (emphasis added). Nor do we\nthink that the EPA altered its initial basis for using the UPL, which\nthe EPA has consistently held out as “a statistical formula designed\nto estimate a MACT floor level that is equivalent to the average of\nthe best performing sources based on future compliance tests.”\n2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,630 (emphasis added).\nWhat the EPA failed to do before NACWA was to explain how the\nUPL functions and why it is a reasonable way to calculate\n“average” emissions levels. The Page Memorandum does precisely\nthat.\n\f                                90\n\nperformance.” Id. Specifically, “[t]he available emissions\ndata are generally in the form of short term, three-run stack\ntests, with each test run lasting for between 1 and 4 hours.”\nId. For this reason, the EPA concluded that it did not have\ninformation “encompass[ing] the emissions performance of a\nsource over time.” Id. (emphasis added). And because the\n“EPA interprets ‘emissions performance’ . . . to mean the\nemissions of a source over the long term, rather than just\nduring a short-term stack test,” the EPA found it necessary to\n“appl[y] a methodology that predicts the actual emissions\nlevels the source is achieving at times other than when stack\ntesting was conducted.” Id. at 3-4 (emphases added).\n\n     The UPL is the methodology the EPA selected to account\nfor these limitations. Id. at 4. “[A] value derived from widely\naccepted and commonly used statistical principles,” the UPL\n“represents the upper end of a prediction interval.” Id. In\nlayman’s terms, the UPL uses an equation that considers\n(1) the average of the best performing source or sources’\nstack-test results (i.e., the mean); (2) the pattern the stack-test\nresults create (i.e., the distribution); (3) the variability in the\nbest performing source or sources’ stack-test results (i.e., the\nvariance); and (4) the total number of stack tests conducted\nfor the best performing source or sources (i.e., the sample\nsize). Id. at 4-5.\n\n     The UPL, however, cannot demonstrate with absolute\ncertainty the average emissions levels achieved by the best\nperforming sources at all times (indeed, certainty is\nimpossible without continuous monitoring). See id. Instead,\nthe UPL equation produces a range of values that is expected,\ngiven the variance in the relevant stack-test data, to\nencompass the average emissions levels achieved by the best\nperforming sources a specified percentage of the time. Id. at\n\f                                91\n\n4. To establish the MACT floor, the EPA calibrated the UPL\nequation to produce a range in which the average emissions\nlevels of the best performing source or sources would be\nexpected to fall 99 per cent of the time, which is referred to as\na 99 per cent confidence interval. Id. Once the EPA had this\nrange, it set the MACT floor at the top level of that range—\nhence, the “upper” in “upper prediction limit”—to arrive at a\nfigure that, 99 out of 100 times, it expected the average\nemissions levels of the best performing sources to “achieve.”\nId. Or, in the EPA’s words, “the 99 percent UPL is the level\nof emissions that” the EPA is “99 percent confident is\nachieved by the average source represented in a dataset over a\nlong-term period based on its previous, measured\nperformance history as reflected in short term stack-test data.”\nId.\n\n     One of the equations the EPA used to calculate the UPL\nis as follows:27\n\n\n\n\n    27\n         The EPA used “one of several equations” to calculate the\nUPL depending on “certain characteristics of [the] dataset,”\nincluding the distribution of data within the dataset. Page Mem. 4.\nHere, we set out the equation the EPA used for a dataset with a\n“normal distribution.” Id. at 10. For our review, we need not\nrecount the other, somewhat more complicated equations the EPA\nused in determining the UPL for datasets with, e.g., a “lognormal\ndistribution.” See id. (“Even though they differ due to separate\nmathematical properties associated with each distribution, the UPL\nequations share a common format . . . .”); see generally id. at 11\n(describing lognormal distribution equation).\n\f                                 92\n\n\n\n\nNACWA, 734 F.3d at 1139. In this equation:\n\n      “x̄ ” is the mean;\n\n      “t(0.99, n-1)” is a value called the “t-statistic,” the\n       statistical tool used to set the confidence interval\n       (here, 99 per cent);\n\n      “n” is the sample size;\n\n      “m” is the number of stack tests that were run to\n       calculate the mean (“x̄ ”); because most stack tests\n       involve 3 “runs,” m usually equals 3;\n\n      “s” represents the “standard deviation.”\n\nSee id.; see also Page Mem. 10-11.\n\n                3. Instant Challenges to UPL\n\n     After the EPA issued the Page Memorandum, the\nEnvironmental Petitioners renewed their argument that the\nUPL represents neither (1) the “average” emissions limit of\nthe best performing source or sources in a subcategory, nor\n(2) the emissions levels “achieved” by the best performing\nsources in a subcategory. We believe that the EPA has\ncarried its burden of demonstrating that the UPL “reflect[s] a\nreasonable estimate of the emissions achieved in practice by\n\f                               93\n\nthe best performing sources.” Cement Kiln, 255 F.3d at 871-\n72 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also NACWA, 734\nF.3d at 1148 (“[H]aving decided to account for variability,\nand having decided to estimate that variability, EPA bears the\nburden of demonstrating with substantial evidence that its\nestimate is reasonable.”).\n\n     Our conclusion is driven, in large part, by the deference\nwe owe the EPA when it determines how best to meet the\ntechnical challenges in its area of expertise. Indeed, the EPA\n“typically has wide latitude in determining the extent of data-\ngathering necessary to solve a problem” and, for that reason,\nwe have “accorded Chevron deference to [its] interpretation\nof [the CAA] as allowing it to estimate MACT floors.”\nNACWA, 734 F.3d at 1131. Moreover, “the requirement that\nthe existing unit floors not be less stringent than the average\nemissions limitation achieved by the best performing 12\npercent of units does not, on its own, dictate how the\nperformance of the best units is to be calculated,” id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted)—“[f]loors need not be perfect\nmirrors of the best-performers’ emissions,” Cement Kiln, 255\nF.3d at 871. So long as the EPA “demonstrate[s] with\nsubstantial evidence—not mere assertions”—that the UPL\n“allows a reasonable inference as to the performance of the\ntop 12 percent of units,” NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1131\n(quotations omitted) (emphasis added), the EPA has\nconducted reasoned decision making.\n\n    The Agency has done so here. The Page Memorandum\nexplains the limitations of stack-test data—i.e., the\n“snapshots” cannot reflect the best performing source’s or\nsources’ average emissions levels at all times and under all\noperating conditions. Page Mem. 6. The Page Memorandum\nalso explains that the Agency chose the UPL as a tool\n\f                                94\n\n“derived from widely accepted and commonly used statistical\nprinciples,” id. at 4, that “reasonably account[s] for variability\nin the emissions of . . . sources,” id. at 2. Finally, the Page\nMemorandum plugs the analytical gap we identified in\nNACWA—it thoroughly explains how and why the UPL\naccounts for the variance and therefore how and why it\nreasonably represents the emissions level “achieved by the\naverage source” or sources. Id. at 3-5. In so doing, the EPA\nhas “clarif[ied],” to our satisfaction, “how the upper\nprediction limit represents the average emissions limitation\nachieved.” NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1143 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners’ arguments to the contrary\nare unavailing. Their primary objection is that the UPL\ncannot reasonably estimate the “average” emissions level\nachieved by the best performing source or sources because the\nUPL represents “a level [the] EPA expects any future\ncompliance test by any [source] in the top 12 percent to fall\nbelow.” No. 11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 35 (emphases added)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).28        But the Page\nMemorandum counters the Environmental Petitioners’\nmistaken understanding of what the UPL represents.29\nAccording to the EPA, “the UPL does not represent the worst\nemissions performance of the best performing units at any\n\n    28\n        See also No. 11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Reply Br. 15 (“It is, as\nits name indicates, an upper limit—the emissions limitation that\nevery member of the best-performing 12 percent will fall\nbelow . . . .” (emphasis in original) (quotation marks omitted)).\n    29\n        The Environmental Petitioners’ argument rests, at least in\npart, on their contention that we should not consider the Page\nMemorandum at all. We decline their invitation to ignore the\nexplanation we ordered the EPA to provide.\n\f                                95\n\ntime.” Page Mem. 4 (emphasis in original).30 It is instead\n“the average level expected to have been achieved over time”\nby the best performing source or sources. Id. (emphasis in\noriginal). “In other words, the 99 percent UPL is the level of\nemissions that [the EPA is] 99 percent confident is achieved\nby the average source . . . over a long-term period based on\nits previous, measured performance history as reflected in\nshort term stack test data.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n     Next, the Environmental Petitioners criticize the Page\nMemorandum’s explanation that the UPL represents the long-\nterm average emissions levels achieved because “the first\nelement of the UPL equation is the average of the short-term\nemissions test data from the best-performing sources.” Id. In\ntheir view, the UPL is no different from “saying that, over\ntime, the average of 1, 2, and 3 = 2 + 500 because the first\nelement in the equation (2) is the average of 1, 2, and 3.” No.\n11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 48. But the UPL does not simply\ntack an arbitrary increase on top of the stack-test average of\nthe best performing sources. Rather, the UPL “allows [the]\nEPA to use emissions test data and the data characteristics,”\nwhich include “the distribution and sample size, along with\nthe intrinsic variability associated with those data,” to\nestimate “an emissions limit based on a specified level of\nconfidence such that an average best performing existing\n    30\n         See also Page Mem. 5 (It is “generally . . . reasonable to\nestablish a [MACT floor] standard that all the best performing 12\npercent of existing sources can meet without any modification\nbecause the statute requires the Agency to establish the standard at\nthe average level of performance of the best 12 percent of sources.”\n(emphasis in original)); id. at 14 (“[T]he MACT floor represents the\naverage emission level achieved by the best performing sources,\nnot the worst emission level achieved by those sources.” (emphases\nin original)).\n\f                                96\n\nsource would not be expected to exceed the limit a specified\nnumber of times.” Page Mem. 6 (emphases added). In other\nwords, the UPL does not simply add an arbitrarily chosen\nvalue but instead turns entirely on the features inherent in the\nstack-test data and how those features reflect the natural\nvariance in emissions experienced by the best performing\nsources over time. See id. at 4 (“[T]he MACT floor\ncalculation takes into account the inherent variability in\nemissions performance to more accurately reflect the range of\nthe best performing sources’ emissions over time.” (emphasis\nadded)).31     Thus, as the Page Memorandum amply\ndemonstrates, see id., the EPA’s use of the UPL is not\narbitrary.\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners also attack the results\nproduced by the UPL. They provide a series of charts that, in\ntheir view, demonstrate that the UPL sets MACT floors far\ntoo high to comport with the CAA’s mandate that floors\nrepresent “the maximum degree of reduction in emissions.”\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2). True, some of the charts show\nthat the EPA has set a MACT floor above the highest\nemissions level recorded by the best performing sources’\nstack testing. See No. 11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 14-15; No.\n11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Reply Br. 23. But this does not mean\nthat the UPL is an arbitrary “average” proxy—for at least two\nreasons.\n\n\n    31\n        See also Page Mem. 6-7 (“[T]he UPL equation that is used\nto account for variability and [to] calculate the MACT floor\nstandard depends on the distribution of the data.”); id. at 11 (“The\nUPL . . . is directly related to the confidence level and to the\nvariance, meaning that as either of these values go up or down, so\ndoes the UPL value.”).\n\f                               97\n\n     First, the charts selectively included are generated from\ndata sets with considerable variance between the highest\nrecorded stack test and the lowest. Unsurprisingly, if a\nhandful of “snapshots” in a data set demonstrate that\nemissions levels experience high spikes and low plummets at\ndiscrete times, it is more likely that the average emissions\nlevel achieved by the best performing sources at all times\nmight be high. This is because a data set with high variability\nwill produce a higher UPL than a data set with low variability,\neven if the two sets share the same average. In other words,\nthe UPL takes large variance into account and therefore\nnaturally goes higher to arrive at the 99 per cent certainty the\nEPA thinks is appropriate.32 Second, where the UPL\nsuggested a MACT floor higher than the results of the stack\ntests, it often did so by insubstantial amounts. Indeed, for at\nleast one chart, “the limit is a mere 4 millionths of a pound per\nmillion Btu above the emissions test results of best\nperformers, an unalarming amount given that the\nmethodology is supposed to account for variable results.”\nNo. 11-1108 Indus. Intervenors’ Br. 10 (emphases in\noriginal). For these reasons, the Environmental Petitioners\nhave not convinced us that the EPA failed to satisfy the\n\n\n\n    32\n        The EPA “selected the 99 percent level in order to provide\nreasonable assurance that the limit can be met at all times by a\nsource with emissions at the average level achieved by the best\nperforming source or sources.” Page Mem. 10. The Environmental\nPetitioners have not challenged the EPA’s choice of a 99 per cent\nconfidence level, as opposed to a lower level of certainty, and we\nexpress no opinion on that choice. And we reiterate that the more\nspecific concerns we had with the UPL when we decided\nNACWA—in particular, the UPL’s accuracy “given a small\ndataset”—are not before us. 734 F.3d at 1144-45.\n\f                                 98\n\n“minimal standard[] of rationality” that we require. Ethyl\nCorp. v. EPA, 541 F.2d 1, 36 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (en banc).\n\n     Finally, the Environmental Petitioners insist that “[t]he\nUPL predicts a level that hypothetical future tests will fall\nbelow, rather than estimating what boilers actually achieved,”\nin contravention of the requirement that MACT floors “reflect\nwhat the best-performing sources achieved.” No. 11-1108\nEnvtl. Pet’rs’ Reply Br. 24 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBut the Environmental Petitioners ignore the Page\nMemorandum’s explanation that, because the UPL is not\ntime-dependent, it “not only is a prediction of the emissions\nperformance of those sources in tests conducted in the future,\nbut is also an indication of the range of current average\nemissions performance of those units.” Page Mem. 3;33 see\nalso No. 11-1108 Indus. Intervenors’ Br. 9 (“Because this\nstatistical method is not time-dependent, it is equally valid for\npredicting past performance (i.e., the range of emissions\nlevels expected to have been experienced in the past by the\nbest performers during periods when actual emissions testing\nwas not underway) and future performance.”).\n\n     We believe that the UPL “reflect[s] a reasonable estimate\nof the emissions achieved in practice by the best-performing\nsources,” Cement Kiln, 255 F.3d at 871-72 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), and, accordingly, we reject the\nEnvironmental Petitioners’ challenge to it.\n     33\n          See also Page Mem. 4 (“[T]he 99 percent UPL is the\nemissions level that the source would be predicted to be below 99\nout of 100 performance tests, including emissions tests conducted\nin the past, present, and future.”); id. at 10 (“The confidence level,\nin this case 99 percent, is the percentage of measurements (past,\npresent, and future) that are predicted to fall at or below the UPL\nvalue.”).\n\f                                 99\n\n  D. BEYOND-THE-FLOOR STANDARDS FOR CISWI UNITS\n\n     The EPA declined to set beyond-the-floor standards for\nCISWI units. The Environmental Petitioners challenge that\ndetermination in three primary respects, each of which we\nreject.34\n\n     Section 7429 of the CAA directs the EPA to set MACT\nstandards in two steps. It first sets a floor level based on the\nbest performing sources. See 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2). Next, it\ndetermines “whether a more restrictive standard is\n‘achievable,’” NRDC III, 749 F.3d at 1057, “taking into\nconsideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction,\nand any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and\n\n    34\n          Although the EPA does not argue that the court lacks\njurisdiction to consider this argument, Environmental Petitioners\nraise the issue defensively, contending that they satisfied the CAA’s\nadministrative exhaustion provision. We agree. During the\nrulemaking process, the Petitioners comprehensively critiqued the\nEPA’s proposed rationale for rejecting beyond-the-floor standards.\nSee, e.g., Natural Resources Defense Council, Comments on\nStandards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and\nEmission Guidelines for Existing Sources, EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-\n0119 (Aug. 23, 2010), at 11-16 (No. 11-1125 J.A. 668-73). Many\nof those comments challenged the EPA’s consideration of costs and\nother factors—the same types of issues Petitioners now ask the\nPanel to resolve. Because the Environmental Petitioners raised the\nrelevant issues “with reasonable specificity” during the period for\npublic comment, our jurisdiction is not in question. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7607(d)(7)(B); see Portland Cement Ass’n v. EPA, 665 F.3d 177,\n186 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“While we certainly require some degree of\nforesight on the part of commenters, we do not require telepathy.\nWe should be especially reluctant to require advocates for affected\nindustries and groups to anticipate every contingency.”).\n\f                               100\n\nenergy requirements,”35 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2). The “EPA\ncalls these stricter requirements ‘beyond-the-floor’\nstandards.” NRDC III, 749 F.3d at 1057.\n\n     In section 7429, the “Congress gave EPA broad\ndiscretion in considering whether to go beyond-the-floor.”\nNACWA, 734 F.3d at 1157. The Congress required the EPA\nto consider a variety of factors without telling the EPA how to\nweigh them. That calculus belongs to the EPA’s discretion.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2) (delegating to the EPA\nAdministrator the responsibility to “tak[e] into consideration”\nthe statutory factors). Against that backdrop, challenges to\nthe EPA’s beyond-the-floor determinations “must clear a high\nbar, as we are at our most deferential when an agency is\n‘making predictions, within its area of special expertise, at the\nfrontiers of science.’” NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1156 (quoting\nHusqvarna, 254 F.3d at 199).\n\n    When establishing MACT standards for CISWI, the EPA\ndeclined to establish beyond-the-floor standards in the\nproposed rule, see 2010 Proposed CISWI Rule, 75 Fed. Reg.\nat 31,956-59, and the final rule, see 2011 CISWI Rule, 76\nFed. Reg. at 15,729-32. The EPA also declined requests to\nreconsider that decision. See Memorandum from Eastern\nResearch Group, Inc., to Amy Hambrick, U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency, Revised Draft CISWI Reconsideration\nIssues (Dec. 20, 2012), at 22-23 (No. 11-1125 J.A. 1219-20).\n\n    35\n         EPA interprets the statutory factor of “cost” to permit\nconsideration of cost-effectiveness, NRDC III, 749 F.3d at 1060-61,\nwhich is often calculated “on [a] per ton of emissions removed\nbasis,” Husqvarna AB v. EPA, 254 F.3d 195, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2001).\nWe have previously upheld that interpretation. See, e.g., NRDC III,\n749 F.3d at 1060-61.\n\f                             101\n\n\n\n     The first challenge targets several instances in which the\nEPA refused to require sources to adopt, as a beyond-the-floor\nmeasure, controls that most sources would employ to meet the\nMACT floor standard. In each instance, the EPA determined\nthat the relative costs outweighed the expected emissions\ngains. In the first such case, the EPA decided not to require\nliquid-fired energy recovery units to install dry sorbent\ninjection and fabric filters as a beyond-the-floor measure,\ndespite the fact that “four of the six” units would need to\ninstall those systems to meet the floor standard. 2011 CISWI\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,731. That decision satisfied the\nstatute. Had the EPA mandated the control measures, the\nremaining two units would have needed to expend “$1.1\nmillion per year” to achieve only a small emissions reduction,\n“which translates into an incremental cost-effectiveness of\nabout $230,000 per ton” of emission. Id. Nothing in section\n7429(a)(2) requires the Agency to impose a cost so\ndisproportionate to the expected emissions gains.\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners take issue with two other\ndecisions along these lines. In the first, the EPA declined to\nset beyond-the-floor mercury control measures for kilns,\nciting a cost-effectiveness of roughly $351 million per ton.\nSee Memorandum from Eastern Research Group, Inc., to Toni\nJones, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Final\nReconsideration Beyond-the-Floor Analysis for CISWI Units\n(Reconsideration Mem.) (Dec. 20, 2012), at ¶ 3.4.2 (No. 11-\n1125 J.A. 1232).        In the second, a $26,000 per-ton\nimplementation cost led the Agency not to establish stricter\ncarbon monoxide control measures for calciner kilns. See id.\n¶ 3.4.3.    Energy use—a factor mandated in section\n7429(a)(2)—also entered the equation. With respect to\ncalciner kilns, the technology used to reduce carbon\n\f                             102\n\nmonoxide would also increase energy requirements, and\ntherefore increase energy costs. See id. In each of these\ndecisions, the EPA reasonably applied the statutory factors.\nThat Petitioners would have weighed the costs differently\nprovides no grounds to displace the EPA’s otherwise\nreasonable determination.\n\n     In the second challenge to the decision not to set beyond-\nthe-floor standards, the Environmental Petitioners contend the\nAgency arbitrarily failed to set emission levels lower than the\nMACT floor for categories likely to adopt technology capable\nof meeting those lower levels. Specifically, according to the\nEnvironmental Petitioners, the EPA knew waste-burning kilns\nand energy recovery units would adopt fabric filters that\n“achieve particulate matter emissions levels dramatically\nlower than the floor, but refused to set the standard at that\nlower level.” See No. 11-1125 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 50.\n\n     That is incorrect. The Environmental Petitioners spin this\nyarn based on a line in the proposed rulemaking. There, the\nAgency speculated that kilns and energy recovery units would\nadopt fabric filters to comply with the MACT floor limit, and\nwould “likely achieve a level of performance” below the\nfloor. 2010 Proposed CISWI Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,958.\nThat statement represented a preliminary prediction, which\nwas subject to change during the notice-and-comment\nprocess. And change it did. In the final rulemaking, the EPA\nfurther subcategorized the energy recovery unit subcategory\nand revised the MACT floor for waste-burning kilns. See\n2013 CISWI Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 9,122 (explaining the\nchanges). New information received during the rulemaking\ninspired those changes, which the EPA made after\nconsidering the statutory factors. See id.; Reconsideration\nMem., ¶ 2.3-3.4.5. The evidence does not suggest that the\n\f                              103\n\nEPA refused to set beyond-the-floor emission levels it knew\nwere reasonably achievable.36\n\n     In the third challenge, the Environmental Petitioners take\nissue with three determinations that rested on factors other\nthan cost. First, the EPA declined to require coal-fired energy\nrecovery units to adopt linkageless boiler management\nsystems as a beyond-the-floor measure for carbon monoxide.\nSee Reconsideration Mem., ¶ 2.3.1.1. While acknowledging\nthat linkageless systems were available at “fairly low-cost,”\nthe EPA concluded it had insufficient data to determine the\n“actual reductions this control option would achieve” relative\nto an alternative control system. Id.\n\n     The EPA acted reasonably. The record suggests the EPA\nhad scant evidence on the efficacy of linkageless control\nmeasures applied to coal-fired energy recovery units. See id.\nHad the Agency imposed a stricter standard based on controls\nfor which it had precious little (if any) evidence, a reviewing\ncourt may well have concluded the decision lacked “a rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.”\nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Second, the EPA rejected regenerative thermal oxidizers\nas a beyond-the-floor control for carbon monoxide in solid\nwaste energy recovery units. See 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,732. Thermal oxidizers could do the job “but\nlikely at a far greater energy requirement (specifically natural\n\n    36\n          This argument suffers from an additional flaw: the\nEnvironmental Petitioners appear to treat as interchangeable\nproposed emissions rules for new units with the final rules\napplicable to existing ones. That apples-and-oranges comparison\nunderscores the weakness of the argument.\n\f                             104\n\ngas) [and] with comparable control efficiency” as carbon\nmonoxide catalysts, which “some units will need to install to\nmeet the MACT floor . . . limits.” Id. In other words, even\nthough oxidizers work as well as carbon catalysts, oxidizers\nwould be unsuitable because they use more energy. See id.\n(concluding that beyond-the-floor controls “would be\nunreasonable for this subcategory due to additional cost and\nenergy impacts”).\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners contend that the EPA\nfailed to “suggest that these natural gas requirements are high\nin an absolute sense or relevant to achievability.” No. 11-\n1125 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 51. We agree that the EPA’s analysis\nis less than fully satisfying. Among other reasons, nowhere\ndid the Agency estimate the per-ton cost of mandating\nthermal oxidizers, or compare the energy costs relative to\nother control measures.\n\n     Despite these imperfections, we reject the challenge. See\nDist. Hosp. Partners, L.P. v. Burwell, 786 F.3d 46, 61 (D.C.\nCir. 2015) (“[I]mperfection alone does not amount to arbitrary\ndecision-making.”). The EPA’s somewhat sparse analysis on\nthis issue reflects a somewhat sparse record. At bottom, the\nAgency rejected thermal oxidizers because it lacked sufficient\nevidence to support their utility, at least compared with\ncontrol measures whose efficacy and costs were better known.\n\n     The Agency’s determination should be read in context.\nElsewhere in the final rule, the EPA expanded on the energy\nand environmental impacts of thermal oxidizers, concluding\nthat “[t]he combustion of fuel needed to generate additional\nelectricity and to operate [thermal oxidizer] controls would\nyield slight increases in emissions, including NOX, CO, PM,\nand SO2 and an increase in CO2 emissions.” 2011 CISWI\n\f                              105\n\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,744. The EPA addressed another\nstatutory factor—cost—by reasonable implication. Energy—\nnatural gas, in this case—is not free. A technology that\ndemands “far greater energy requirement[s]” naturally comes\nat a cost. See id. at 15,732.\n\n     Though courts are powerless to “supply a reasoned basis\nfor the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given,”\n“[w]e will . . . uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if\nthe agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.” State Farm,\n463 U.S. at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the\nAgency’s path may reasonably be discerned: mandating\nthermal oxidizers was not achievable due to increased energy\ndemands and a corollary increase in cost, see 2011 CISWI\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,732 (declining to set a beyond-the-\nfloor limit “due to additional cost and energy impacts”). For\nthose reasons, EPA did not act unreasonably.\n\n     Third, and finally, the Environmental Petitioners\nchallenge the rejection of dry sorbent injection and wet\nscrubbers as beyond-the-floor measures for waste-burning\nkilns. The EPA determined those measures would be cost-\neffective (at only $5,000 per ton) but declined to require them\ndue to “uncertainty” surrounding “the appropriate control\nsystem that some existing kilns would need to employ to\nmeet” a stricter standard, “especially kilns that use ingredients\nwith a high sulfur content.” See Reconsideration Mem.,\n¶ 3.4.5. Adding to that uncertainty, the EPA could not\n“account for potential costs at existing sources for additional\nscrubber water and spent sorbent.” Id. As before, the EPA\nreached a reasonable conclusion in the face of imperfect\ninformation. Had the EPA set a beyond-the-floor standard\nbased on sorbent injection and wet scrubbers, the Agency\n\f                                106\n\nwould have been flying blind. In avoiding that course, we\nconclude the EPA acted reasonably.\n\n          E. REGULATION OF CERTAIN CISWI UNITS\n\n     The final CISWI Rule did not contain emission standards\nfor burn-off ovens, cyclonic burn barrels, foundry sand\nreclamation units, soil treatment units, and space heaters. The\nEnvironmental Petitioners claim that the EPA unlawfully\nexempted these units from regulation by creating\nsubcategories that capture only a subset of the units that the\nAgency is required to regulate as CISWI. The EPA, however,\nprotests that it did not exempt these five types of units from\nregulation. Rather, the Agency determined that it lacked\nsufficient data to regulate the units at this time, and, with\nrespect to some, it received comments suggesting the units\nwere not CISWI.37\n\n\n     37\n         The EPA asserts that it has not made a final decision with\nregard to the regulation of the five units at issue here—a claim that\ncalls into question our jurisdiction, which under the CAA is limited\nto “final” actions. See Portland Cement, 665 F.3d at 193 (citing 42\nU.S.C. § 7607(b)). We disagree with the Agency. Because the\nstatutory deadline for the EPA to establish emission standards for\nall CISWI has passed, see 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(1)(D), “the\npromulgated regulations must be deemed the [A]gency’s complete\nresponse in compliance with the statutory requirement[].” Hercules\nInc. v. EPA, 938 F.2d 276, 282 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Accordingly, “even if [the Agency] promulgates\nadditional . . . rules sometime in the future, petitioners’ claim that\nthe existing final regulations are unlawful remains reviewable by\nthis court.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the\nEPA did not signal in the administrative record that it was\n“continu[ing] the rulemaking process” as to these five units.\nPortland Cement, 665 F.3d at 194 (holding that the EPA’s action\n\f                              107\n\n     We agree with the Environmental Petitioners that the\nAgency has violated its nondiscretionary statutory duty (1) to\npromulgate standards with respect to cyclonic burn barrels,\nand (2) to determine whether the remaining four types of units\nfall within the statutory definition of CISWI. The CAA\nrequires the EPA to “establish performance standards . . . for\neach category of solid waste incineration units” no later than\nNovember 15, 1994. See 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(1)(A), (D).\nThe statute then defines “solid waste incineration unit” as a\n“distinct operating unit of any facility which combusts any\nsolid waste material from commercial or industrial\nestablishments or the general public.” Id. § 7429(g)(1)\n(emphasis added). That provision unambiguously requires the\nEPA to set emission standards for “any facility that combusts\nany commercial or industrial solid waste material at all,”\nsubject only to the listed statutory exceptions. NRDC I, 489\nF.3d at 1257-58. Because the statutory deadline to regulate\nthese units has long passed, the EPA has “breached a non-\ndiscretionary duty” if it has failed to promulgate standards for\nany facilities combusting solid waste from commercial or\nindustrial establishments that do not fit into the listed\nexceptions. Sierra Club v. EPA, 992 F.2d 337, 346 (D.C. Cir.\n1993); cf. id. (explaining that the “plain language” of a similar\nprovision in RCRA “obligates the Agency to issue, by the\ndeadline, revisions for all facilities” covered by the statute\nand therefore “does not contemplate partial compliance”).\n\n    The Agency makes no effort to claim that cyclonic burn\nbarrels fall outside the statutory definition for CISWI units.\n\nwas not “final” under 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b) because the Agency\nexpressly stated in its final rule that the rulemaking process\nremained underway). We therefore need not consider whether our\nconclusion regarding finality would change had it done so.\n\f                              108\n\nNor could it—both the administrative record and the EPA’s\nbrief make clear that cyclonic burn barrels “combust” solid\nwaste. See 2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on Reconsideration,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 80,460 (describing a cyclonic burn barrel as\n“a combustion device for waste materials”); No. 11-1125\nEPA Br. 68 (same); see also 42 U.S.C. § 7429(g)(1) (defining\n“solid waste incineration unit” as a “distinct operating unit of\nany facility which combusts any solid waste material from\ncommercial or industrial establishments or the general\npublic”). Because they combust solid waste, cyclonic burn\nbarrels clearly fall within the statutory definition of “solid\nwaste incineration unit” and, as established above, the EPA\nhad a nondiscretionary statutory duty to establish emission\nstandards for all these units by 1994. We therefore conclude\nthat the Agency violated that duty by failing to promulgate\nemission standards for cyclonic burn barrels.\n\n     The EPA protests that it reasonably chose not to regulate\ncyclonic burn barrels at this time, given how little information\nit had on them. According to the EPA, comments revealed\nthere were many more cyclonic burn barrels in use than\noriginally thought, the Agency lacked data on these units, and\nit was “difficult, if not impossible, to test such units for the\nsection 7429 pollutants.” No. 11-1125 EPA Br. 69. But this\nargument misses the point: in light of the unambiguous\nstatutory command to promulgate numeric standards for all\nsolid waste incineration units, the EPA had no discretion to\navoid regulating any such units—even if its choice to avoid\nregulating these units would have been otherwise reasonable.\nThe Agency was obligated to collect the data it needed, and\nCongress gave it the authority to do so. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7414(a) (explaining that for the purpose of regulating solid\nwaste combustion under section 7429, the EPA may, for\nexample, require owners and operators of those units to\n\f                              109\n\nsample emissions, keep records, and offer other information\nthat the Agency needs). Moreover, the Agency provides no\nevidence that it would be infeasible to set emission standards\nfor these units. Instead, the EPA merely states that it\n“received information” that measuring emissions is difficult,\n“if not impossible,” but points to no comments or evidence\nsupporting this assertion. 2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on\nReconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,460.\n\n     The EPA also had a duty to determine whether the other\nchallenged sources—burn-off ovens (including foundry sand\nreclamation units), soil treatment units, and space heaters—\nwere units that “combust” solid waste. Several commenters\ntold the Agency that these units fell within the statutory\ndefinition of CISWI, and the EPA itself initially viewed some\nof these units as combusting waste. See, e.g., CISWI Rule—\nResponses to Comments, at 74-76; 2010 Proposed CISWI\nRule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,941. Under these circumstances, the\nAgency was obligated to determine whether the units in fact\ncombust solid waste. Yet the EPA concedes it never made\nthat determination. As we have explained, the EPA had a\nnondiscretionary duty to promulgate standards for all solid\nwaste combustion units.        This obligation includes the\nsubsidiary duty to determine whether the units identified by\nthe commenters in fact combust solid waste. Any other\nconclusion would allow the Agency to ignore its statutory\nmandate altogether by not taking the initial step of identifying\nsuch units.\n\n     The CAA unambiguously requires that the Agency\nestablish standards for all CISWI units. As a result, we grant\nthe Environmental Petitioners’ petition for review on this\nissue and remand to the Agency to set emission standards for\ncyclonic burn barrels. The EPA must also determine whether\n\f                             110\n\nthe remaining four types of units are CISWI units and, if it\nfinds that they are, it must set standards for them as well.\n\n         F. DELISTING UNDER 42 U.S.C. § 7412(C)\n\n     In contrast to major source subcategories (all of which\nthe EPA must control), the CAA does not require the EPA to\ncontrol emissions in every area source subcategory. See 42\nU.S.C. § 7412(c)(1), (3). The Act does, however, mandate\nthat the EPA control area source emissions if the area source\nsubcategory meets certain criteria. Section 7412(c)(1), for\ninstance, requires the EPA to control any area source\nsubcategory upon the Agency’s finding that emissions from\nthe sources in the subcategory jeopardize either the\nenvironment or human health. See id. § 7412(c)(3). If so, the\nEPA can establish either a MACT or a GACT standard. See\nid. § 7412(d)(5). Similarly, if the EPA finds that capping\nemissions from an area source subcategory is necessary to\nachieve a 90 per cent reduction in the aggregate emissions of\none of seven CAA-enumerated HAPs, section 7412(c)(6)\nrequires the Agency to impose caps in that subcategory as\nwell. See id. § 7412(c)(6). Upon that finding, however, the\nEPA must impose a MACT standard. Id.\n\n     In addition to prescribing requirements for inclusion of\narea source subcategories, the CAA provides a mechanism for\nremoval of area source subcategories that, in the EPA’s view,\nno longer need to be controlled. Specifically, the EPA can\n“delete” any subcategory if it finds that no source or group of\nsources in it (1) emits cancer-causing HAPs at a volume\nsufficient to increase the lifetime risk of cancer in the\npopulation by more than one in one million and (2) emits non-\ncancer-causing HAPs at a level in excess of that which is\nadequate “to protect public health with an ample margin of\n\f                             111\n\nsafety” and to prevent against environmental harm. Id.\n§ 7412(c)(9)(B). The section 7412(c)(9) process is known as\n“delisting.”\n\n     In 1998, the EPA identified several area source boiler\nsubcategories—including       oil-fired,   industrial    wood,\ncommercial oil-fired and commercial wood-combustion\nboilers—as contributors to the “90 per centum of the\naggregate emissions” of Hg and POM under section\n7412(c)(6).     See Source Category Listing for Section\n112(d)(2) Rulemaking Pursuant to Section 112(c)(6)\nRequirements, 63 Fed. Reg. 17,838, 17,839 (Apr. 10, 1998).\nWhen it decided to “list” these sources, however, the EPA\nincluded a caveat. It explained that it used the best emissions\ninformation it had at the time to conclude that these boiler\nsubcategories produced enough Hg and POM emissions to\njustify section 7412(c)(6) control but it also admitted that it\ncould not “assure that this calculation of the 90 percent will\nremain constant.” Id. at 17,840.\n\n     The caveat proved prescient. When the EPA issued the\n2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, it decided it needed to\nregulate only coal-fired boilers at the MACT level to control\n90 per cent of Hg emissions. See 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,898.\nAnd when it finalized the 2011 Area Boilers Rule, the Agency\nsimilarly decided that it needed to regulate only coal-fired\nboilers at the MACT level to control 90 per cent of POM\nemissions. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,566.\n\n     For this reason, the EPA established GACT, rather than\nMACT, standards for the oil-fired and biomass-fired area\nsource subcategories regarding these two pollutants. See id.\nIt did not, however, make any of the “delisting” findings\nrequired by section 7412(c)(9) when it removed these area\n\f                               112\n\nsource subcategories from section 7412(c)(6)’s purview. See\n2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,566 (“[W]e have\nnot removed or ‘delisted’ oil-fired and biomass-fired area\nsource boilers by this action. We are not promulgating\nMACT-based regulations at this time because they are\nunnecessary to meet the requirements of CAA section\n112(c)(6).”). The Environmental Petitioners challenge the\nEPA’s imposition of GACT standards, arguing that, because\nonce the EPA “listed” these sources under section\n7412(c)(6)’s MACT requirement, the CAA mandates that the\nEPA “delist” them under section 7412(c)(9) before putting\nthem under the more lenient GACT standards. In their view,\nthe EPA’s contrary approach fails at Chevron step 1. The\nEPA responds that section 7412(c)(9) applies only if it\ndecides to “delist” a subcategory entirely from section 7412\nregulation, resulting in neither MACT nor GACT restrictions.\n\n      Because section 7412(c)(9) does not unambiguously\napply to section 7412(c)(6) and because the EPA’s\ninterpretation of section 7412(c)(9)’s delisting requirement is\nreasonable, we uphold the EPA’s decision as permissible\nunder Chevron step 2. Section 7412(c)(9) provides that the\nEPA “may delete any source category from the list under this\nsubsection” on its finding that the source category is not a\nthreat to human health or the environment. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(c)(9)(B). The inclusion of a singular “list” to govern\n“this subsection” seems, most naturally, to refer to the list\ncontemplated by section 7412(c)(1), which states that the\nEPA “shall publish, and shall from time to time . . . revise . . .\na list of all categories and subcategories of . . . area sources\n(listed under paragraph (3)).” Id. § 7412(c)(1) (emphasis\nadded). In other words, it appears that section 7412(c)(1)\ndirects the EPA to create one “list” of source categories and\nsubcategories to subject to emission controls and section\n\f                              113\n\n7412(c)(9) instructs how to remove source categories from\nthat list. This conclusion finds support in section 7412(c)(1)’s\ncross reference to “paragraph (3)” of section 7412(c), which\nlays out the circumstances under which the EPA “shall list”\narea source categories for emissions control. Id. § 7412(c)(3).\n\n     In the Environmental Petitioners’ view, section\n7412(c)(9) also applies to a second, subsidiary list—that\ncontemplated by section 7412(c)(6), requiring imposition of\nthe MACT standard. Granted, section 7412(c)(6) mandates\nthat the EPA “shall . . . list” source categories and\nsubcategories if doing so is necessary to control 90 per cent of\nthe aggregate emissions from seven enumerated pollutants.\nId. § 7412(c)(6) (emphasis added). But the use of the verb\n“list” in section 7412(c)(6) does not unambiguously establish\nthat 7412(c)(9), titled “[d]eletions from the list,” applies.\nBecause section 7412(c)(9) is ambiguous, we defer to the\nEPA so long as its interpretation is “based on a permissible\nconstruction.” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43. And the EPA’s\nreading of section 7412(c)(9)—that it applies only if the EPA\nwants to remove a category from all section 7412\nregulation—is reasonable.\n\n     First, the EPA’s approach harmonizes sections\n7412(c)(1), 7412(c)(3), and 7412(c)(9). Because the EPA\nmust find that an area source “presents a threat of adverse\neffects to human health or the environment” before it\nregulates the source category at all, id. § 7412(c)(3), it makes\nsense to require the EPA to find that “no source in the\ncategory or subcategory . . . exceed[s] a level which is\nadequate to protect public health . . . and no adverse\nenvironmental effect will result from emissions from any\nsource” before it completely deregulates that category, id.\n§ 7412(c)(9). It makes less sense to require the EPA to make\n\f                             114\n\nthe same findings before it opts for GACT instead of MACT\nstandards, which occurs when the EPA removes a source from\nsection 7412(c)(6)’s purview but continues to regulate it\nunder section 7412(c)(1).\n\n    Second, the EPA’s approach is consistent with our\ndecision in New Jersey, 517 F.3d 574. There, we held that\n“the only way EPA could remove [a source category] from\nthe section [7412(c)(1)] list was by satisfying section\n[7412(c)(9)’s] requirements.” Id. at 582. In other words, New\nJersey held that the EPA cannot remove a source category\nfrom all section 7412 regulation without delisting it; it said\nnothing about the process by which the EPA moves source\ncategories from section 7412(c)(6).\n\n     Finally, the Petitioners’ argument would freeze the\nEPA’s decision as to which sources need to be controlled to\nreach the requisite 90 per cent emissions reduction for the\nsection 7412(c)(6) pollutants until it determines that “no\nsource in the category or subcategory . . . exceed[s] a level\nwhich is adequate to protect public health . . . and no adverse\nenvironmental effect will result from emissions from any\nsource.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(c)(9). This, in turn, would hamper\nthe EPA’s ability to respond to updated data, thereby\nsubstantially complicating its attempts to control the\npollutants. Nothing in the CAA suggests that the Congress\nintended to so hamstring the Agency.\n\nG. TITLE V PERMIT EXEMPTION FOR SYNTHETIC BOILERS\n\n    The EPA has discretion to exempt one or more area\nsource categories from Title V permitting requirements upon\na finding “that compliance with such requirements is\nimpracticable, infeasible, or unnecessarily burdensome on\nsuch categories.” 42 U.S.C. § 7661a(a). The EPA originally\n\f                              115\n\nproposed exempting some area source categories because\nexisting “testing, monitoring, notification, and recordkeeping\nrequirements” rendered Title V permitting cumulative. 2010\nProposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,910. At the\ntime, however, the EPA elected not to exempt synthetic area\nsources as one of those categories. Id. at 31,913. Synthetic\narea sources are boilers that “naturally” emit pollutants at a\nmajor source level but which qualify as area sources due to\nthe voluntary adoption of air pollution control technologies.\nId. Despite its initial stance, the EPA ultimately decided to\nexempt all area sources—including synthetic area sources—\nfrom Title V’s permitting requirements. See 2011 Area\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,578.\n\n     Environmental Petitioners argue the EPA’s decision to\nexclude synthetic boilers from Title V licensing requirements\nis arbitrary and capricious for two reasons. First, they say, the\nEPA arbitrarily concluded synthetic area sources would bear\nthe same level of burden as other area sources in complying\nwith Title V permitting requirements, rather than a lesser one.\nSee No. 11-1141 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 39-43. And second, they\ncontend the EPA arbitrarily dismissed the additional\ncompliance benefits of Title V licensing for these synthetic\nsources. See id. at 43-47. Under State Farm, “an agency rule\n[is] arbitrary and capricious if the agency . . . offered an\nexplanation of its decision that runs counter to the evidence\nbefore the agency.” 463 U.S. at 43. A court may not accept\nan agency’s “post hoc rationalizations” for its\ndecisionmaking. Id. at 49.\n\n    The EPA has authority under the CAA to exempt sources\nfrom Title V permitting requirements if those requirements\nwould be “impracticable, infeasible, or unnecessarily\nburdensome” on the area source. 42 U.S.C. § 7661a(a). The\n\f                             116\n\nEPA previously developed a four-factor balancing test to\ndetermine whether Title V’s requirements are “unnecessarily\nburdensome.” See Exemption of Certain Area Sources from\nTitle V Operating Permit Programs, 70 Fed. Reg. 75,320,\n75,323 (Dec. 19, 2005). Under this test, the EPA considers\nwhether: (1) Title V permitting would result in significant\nimprovements in compliance with emission standards;\n(2) whether Title V permitting would impose significant\nburdens on the area source category; (3) whether the costs are\njustified, taking into account potential gains; and (4) whether\nthere are existing enforcement programs in place sufficient to\nensure compliance. See id. at 75,323-26. The EPA also must\nconsider, consistent with the legislative history of the CAA,\nwhether exemption would “adversely affect public health,\nwelfare, or the environment.” Id. at 75,333-34. These factors\nare considered in combination and not every factor must point\nin favor of exemption for the EPA to choose that course. See\nid. at 75,323.\n\n     In its 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, the EPA applied\nthis balancing test and excluded almost all area source boilers\nexcept synthetic boilers that achieved “area” status via\ninstallation of a control technology (although it exempted\nthose that achieved “area” status through operational\nchanges). The EPA provided an extensive rationale for its\ndecision to exclude these “natural” area sources from Title\nV’s permitting requirements. See 2010 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,910-13. With respect to\nfactor one, the EPA found its proposed rule already required\n“direct monitoring of emissions,” both continuously and\nperiodically, recordkeeping that would allow for additional\nmonitoring, and “semi-annual reporting to assure\ncompliance.” Id. at 31,911. Moreover, under the proposed\nrule, “records are required to be maintained in a form suitable\n\f                             117\n\nand readily available for expeditious review” for up to five\nyears. Id. The EPA acknowledged Title V permitting could\nprovide some additional compliance benefits; specifically,\nthat Title V has an every-six-month monitoring and reporting\nrequirement. See id. But the EPA ultimately concluded the\nmonitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of its\nproposed rule were sufficient to assure compliance: “Given\nthe nature of the operations at most area sources and the types\nof requirements in this rule, Title V would not significantly\nimprove those compliance requirements.” Id.\n\n     As to the second factor, the EPA noted that subjecting\nmost area sources to Title V would “impose[] certain burdens\nand costs that do not exist outside of the [t]itle V program.”\nId. at 31,912. One of the EPA’s major concerns was that\n“requiring permits for the large number of area sources could,\nat least in the first few years of implementation, potentially\nadversely affect public health, welfare, or the environment by\nshifting [s]tate agencies[’] resources away from assuring\ncompliance for major sources with existing permits to issuing\nnew permits for these area sources, potentially reducing\noverall air program effectiveness.” Id. at 31,913. For the\nthird factor, the EPA concluded the costs of compliance\nwould “impose a significant burden on many of the\napproximately 137,000 facilities affected by this proposed\nrule” with only “low” potential gains in compliance. Id. at\n31,912. Finally, for the fourth factor, the EPA determined\nthat “[s]tate delegated programs are sufficient to assure\ncompliance with this [rule],” and noted that the Agency\nretains authority to enforce this rule “anytime.” Id. The EPA\ntherefore proposed exempting these area sources from the\npermitting requirements. See id. Environmental Petitioners\nare not currently challenging the exemption for non-synthetic\narea boilers.\n\f                             118\n\n     However, in this 2010 rulemaking, the EPA also\nexplained precisely why it declined to exempt synthetic area\nsources that installed air pollution controls from Title V\nrequirements. First, the EPA noted these synthetic area\nsources “represent less than one percent of the total number of\nsources that will be subject to the final rule.” Id. at 31,913.\nThe EPA also characterized these sources as “much more like\nthe major sources” that are not exempt from Title V\npermitting requirements. Id. Further distinctions included\nthat “many of these sources are located in cities, and often in\nclose proximity to residential and commercial centers where\nlarge numbers of people live and work,” that they “have\nsignificantly higher emissions potential when uncontrolled”\n(even compared to synthetic boilers that adopted operational\nlimits to attain area source status), and that many of these\nsources “are large facilities with comprehensive compliance\nprograms in place” as opposed to small facilities, like schools\nor hospitals. Id. Given these distinctions, the EPA concluded\nadditional public involvement and compliance oversight\nthrough Title V was “important to ensure that these sources\nare maintaining their emissions at the area source level.” Id.\n\n     But the EPA shifted its position in the 2011 Area Boilers\nRule by deciding to exempt all area sources, including\nsynthetic sources. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,578. The EPA\nprovided only a cursory explanation for this shift, noting how\na further review of the record led it to conclude “observations\nand data we have relied upon in other rulemakings for\ndistinguishing between sources that became synthetic area\nsources due to controls and other synthetic and natural area\nsources [do] not necessarily apply to this source category.”\nId. (emphasis added). Because the EPA asserted it no longer\nhad “sufficient information” to identify control-technology-\ndependent synthetic sources, it decided to apply the same\n\f                               119\n\nrationale used to exempt “natural” sources to these synthetic\nsources. Id. (“[T]he rationale for exempting most area\nsources subject to this rule . . . is also now relevant for sources\nwhich we proposed to permit [under Title V].”). But—even if\nthe EPA truly cannot distinguish between synthetic sources\nrelying on control technologies and other sources—it does not\ninvariably follow that the justifications the Agency relied on\nfor exempting “natural” sources under the four-factor\nbalancing test can be transposed onto these synthetic sources.\nCf. Sierra Club II, 479 F.3d at 884 (“We agree with the Sierra\nClub that EPA’s use of work practice standards instead of\nemission floors violates section 7412(h). That provision\nallows EPA to substitute work practice standards for emission\nfloors only if measuring emissions levels is technologically or\neconomically impracticable. Here, EPA never determined\nthat measuring emissions from ceramic kilns was\nimpracticable; it determined only that it lacked emissions data\nfrom ceramics kilns. EPA thus had no basis under section\n7412(h) for using work practice standards.”).\n\n     In its next iteration of the rule, the EPA endeavored to\nfurther explain its exemption of synthetic sources. The EPA\nagain stated it “lacked sufficient information” to distinguish\nthese synthetic sources from other area sources. See 2011\nProposed Area Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 80,538. The Sierra Club challenged this exemption in a\ncomment, and the EPA responded with “additional analysis”\nof the synthetic exemption. Id. In this analysis, the EPA first\nreiterated the difference in number between the two types:\nestimating there to be at least 48 control-technology-\ndependent synthetic sources versus 137,000 other area\nsources, most of which are located at small facilities like\nschools, hospitals, and churches. See id. The EPA then\nprovided a new rationale for the exemption: that these\n\f                               120\n\nsynthetic facilities “may already have a Title V permit for\nother reasons.” Id. The EPA also found that “synthetic area\nsources would likely be subject to more stringent permit and\nmonitoring requirements than natural area sources” because\nthey have a “legal duty to use the control equipment” to keep\nthem at an “area” level. Id. (emphasis added). Finally, the\nEPA made several assertions about the similarities between\nsynthetic and natural sources. Specifically, that synthetic\nsources are “similar in size and sophistication to those that are\nnatural area sources,” that their “uncontrolled emissions are\ngenerally on the same order of magnitude as the emissions of\nnatural sources,” and that “the facilities and owners are\ncomparable in size.” Id. The EPA provided no data or\nexamples in support of these assertions, which appear to\ndirectly contradict the distinctions the EPA listed in its earlier\nversion of the rule. Compare id., with 2010 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,913. In its final rule, the\nEPA declined to make any changes to its Title V\nexemptions—exempting all area sources including synthetic\nsources using a control technology. See 2013 Area Boilers\nRule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,497.\n\n     Based on this record, the EPA’s reasoning has several\nfatal flaws that render its exemption decision arbitrary. The\nEPA put forward two primary justifications for exempting\nsynthetic sources: (1) that it could not necessarily rely on\nexisting data for distinguishing the different type of sources,\nand (2) that these facilities are “similar in size and\nsophistication” to natural area sources. See 2011 Proposed\nArea Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n80,538. The second justification flatly contradicts the EPA’s\nearlier, extensive discussion about how these synthetic\nsources have higher emissions potential and are often located\non large sites with existing compliance programs, in addition\n\f                               121\n\nto being uniquely few in number and generally found near\ncities. 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at\n31,912-13. These factors all undercut the EPA’s assertion\nthat synthetic sources are “similar”—in size, sophistication, or\notherwise—to natural sources. With respect to the lack of\ndata for distinguishing, the EPA was able to estimate in its\nproposed rule that 48 synthetic sources would have been\naffected by this rule—which suggests the EPA possesses\nsome mechanism for distinguishing the types. See 2011\nProposed Area Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 80,538. Moreover, the EPA does not explain why the data\nit used in prior rulemakings to distinguish these source types\nis not accurate in this context. Environmental Petitioners also\npoint out that, “to qualify for area-source status, synthetic area\nsources must notify the EPA or the state permitting authority\nof the limits on their emissions,” such that the EPA “need\nonly ask these authorities to identify the sources operating in\ntheir states.” No. 11-1141, Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 39-40. The EPA\nnever endeavors to explain why that mechanism (or any other\nexisting mechanism) is insufficient for identifying synthetic\narea sources.\n\n     Because its justifications for the final rule contradict\nearlier findings, the EPA must provide some reasoning to\nexplain why its final decision “runs counter to the evidence\nbefore the agency.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. The EPA’s\nproffered explanation fails. This court has “often declined to\naffirm an agency decision if there are unexplained\ninconsistencies in the final rule.” See Dist. Hosp. Partners,\n786 F.3d at 59; see also Gulf Power Co. v. FERC, 983 F.2d\n1095, 1101 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (“[W]hen an agency takes\ninconsistent positions . . . it must explain its reasoning.”);\nGen. Chem. Corp. v. United States, 817 F.2d 844, 846 (D.C.\nCir. 1987) (holding agency action to be arbitrary because its\n\f                              122\n\nanalysis was “internally inconsistent and inadequately\nexplained”). The EPA had a duty here to examine and justify\nthe “key assumptions” underlying its decision, and it failed to\ndo so. See Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 135 F.3d 791, 818\n(D.C. Cir. 1998) (“EPA retains a duty to examine key\nassumptions as part of its affirmative burden of promulgating\nand explaining a nonarbitrary, non-capricious rule.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n     The EPA’s major oversight was its failure to explain why\nthe rationale it used to exempt natural area sources from Title\nV could be identically applied to synthetic area sources. One\nof the Agency’s main justifications for exempting natural area\nsources was that their prolific numbers might overwhelm state\nand local regulatory agencies, diverting resources from other\nimportant environmental programs, thereby harming public\nhealth and welfare. The EPA never explained why requiring\n48 synthetic area sources to comply with Title V would strain\ngovernment resources to a comparable degree as would\nrequiring the 137,000 natural area sources to comply. As\ndiscussed above, the EPA also did not explain how it\nsuddenly determined these synthetic area sources were\n“similar in size and sophistication” to natural sources, when it\nhad previously articulated several key differences. It is\nparticularly unclear how these synthetic sources could have\n“uncontrolled emissions . . . generally on the same order of\nmagnitude as the emissions of natural area sources.” 2011\nProposed Area Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 80,538. Given that synthetic sources are defined as\n“major” sources that have artificially reduced their emissions\nto an “area” level, it is difficult to understand how the\nuncontrolled emissions of these sources would be similar to\nnatural area sources. Additionally, the EPA asserted that\nsynthetic source “facilities and owners are comparable in\n\f                              123\n\nsize” to natural sources. Id. This contradicts earlier findings\nthat synthetic sources tend to be large, located on sites with\nexisting compliance plans, and near population-dense areas.\nThe EPA provides no data or explanation to support this shift.\n\n     The EPA relies on another problematic premise when it\nclaims the potential benefits of subjecting synthetic area\nsources to Title V requirements are low. Both the EPA and\nIndustry Intervenors argue that the added benefits of Title V\nwould be minimal for these synthetic sources, relying solely\non the rationale given for natural sources. But the EPA\noriginally asserted “additional public involvement and\ncompliance assurance requirements through title V [are]\nimportant to ensure that these sources are maintaining their\nemissions at the area source level.” 2010 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,913 (emphasis added). The\nEPA never explains why these additional benefits were\nconsidered “important” before but are now “not important”\nsimply because it allegedly determined that synthetic sources\nmay be hard to distinguish from natural sources. The\ndifficulty in identifying synthetic sources says nothing about\nthe benefits that may be gained by requiring Title V permits,\nassuming the sources can be identified. Synthetic sources\nretain the attributes which first motivated the EPA to subject\nthem to Title V permitting: they tend to be near cities,\nspecifically near large residential populations, and they have\ngreater emission potential if their control technology is\nremoved, turned off, or not kept up to standards. The EPA\narguably finds Title V’s additional compliance benefits\nunnecessary because synthetic sources have “a legal duty to\nuse the control equipment” and that use is “not optional.”\n2011 Proposed Area Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 80,538. But that observation does not speak to the\nneed for public oversight; just because facilities are obligated\n\f                              124\n\nto use the control technology does not mean they will always\ndo so. Title V’s process requires facilities to submit\ncompliance documentation every six months—far more\nfrequently than under the EPA’s current rule—which expands\nthe opportunity for public oversight and compliance. Perhaps\nthis “legal duty” provides a stronger incentive for compliance\nthan public oversight but, if so, the EPA still fails to explain\nhow.\n\n     Similarly, for factor three’s balancing of costs and\nbenefits, the EPA never justifies applying to natural sources—\nwhich tend to be small sites like schools, hospitals, and\nchurches—the same rationale it applies to these larger\nsynthetic sources, which tend to be located at refineries,\nchemical plants, and factories. Given these distinctions, it is\nat least possible this balancing would lead to a different\noutcome for synthetic sources. Taken as a whole, the EPA’s\nanalysis fails to explain why several of the facts and\ncharacteristics it relied on for its initial assessment are no\nlonger relevant—creating several glaring inconsistencies in\nthe rulemaking record. The EPA offers no plausible reason\nfor applying the results of the four-factor test for natural\nsources wholesale to these control-technology-dependent\nsynthetic sources. We do not hold, however, that the EPA can\nnever remove synthetic area sources from the ambit of Title V\ncompliance. The outcome the EPA ultimately reached may\nbe reasonable; however, “[n]ot only must an agency’s decreed\nresult be within the scope of its lawful authority, but the\nprocess by which it reaches that result must be logical and\nrational.” Allentown Mack Sales & Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, 522\nU.S. 359, 374 (1998). The EPA should have applied its four-\nfactor balancing test directly to synthetic sources or, at a\nminimum, provided an explanation for adopting the natural\n\f                             125\n\nsource balancing test that is not premised on inconsistencies\nin the record.\n\n     With respect to remedy, there is a strong possibility that\nthe Agency can properly explain its decision to exclude\nsynthetic boilers from the Title V permitting requirement;\nmoreover, vacating the decision would be unnecessarily\ndisruptive for synthetic boiler operators who, in the interim,\nwould not know whether they needed to begin the expensive,\ntime-consuming process of obtaining a Title V permit. See\nAllied-Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 988\nF.2d 146, 150-51 (D.C. Cir. 1993). We therefore remand this\nissue (without vacating) for further explanation by the EPA.\n\n          H. GACT STANDARD DETERMINATIONS\n\n    With few exceptions, the EPA has broad discretion to\nchoose how to control area source emissions. For instance,\nthe EPA has discretion to choose between GACT and MACT\nstandards in the majority of cases.       See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(d)(5). Even if the EPA chooses a MACT standard, it\nhas discretion—although somewhat circumscribed—to set a\nwork-practice standard instead of a numeric standard. Id.\n§ 7412(h)(1). And the EPA has discretion when choosing\namong different GACT-standard options.           See id.\n§ 7412(d)(5).\n\n     Accordingly, we must uphold the EPA’s GACT-standard\ndeterminations so long as it “has considered the relevant\nfactors and articulated a rational connection between the facts\nfound and the choice made, and has not relied on [improper]\nfactors.” Nat’l Ass’n of Clean Air Agencies, 489 F.3d at 1228\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But for all\nof the discretion the EPA enjoys, it must nonetheless\ndemonstrate that it exercised its judgment in a reasoned way.\n\f                              126\n\nThe cases establishing this principle are legion. See, e.g.,\nTransactive Corp. v. United States, 91 F.3d 232, 236 (D.C.\nCir. 1996) (agency must “identif[y] and explain[] the\nreasoned basis for its decision”); Int’l Fabricare Inst., 972\nF.2d at 389 (agency must “examine[] the relevant data and\n. . . articulate[] an adequate explanation for its action”). The\nEPA need not go to great lengths to meet its burden; indeed,\nwe “uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity” so long as\n“the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.” State\nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43 (quoting Ark.-Best Freight Sys., Inc.,\n419 U.S. at 286).\n\n     With these principles in mind, we address the\nEnvironmental Petitioners’ two challenges to the EPA’s\ndiscretionary decisions regarding the Area Boilers Rule.\n\n          1. EPA’s Selection of GACT Standards\n                   for Non-Hg Metals\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners argue that the EPA failed\nto support its decision-making when it established MACT\nstandards for Hg and POM emissions from some coal-fired\nboilers but declined to regulate non-Hg emissions under the\nMACT standard from the same boilers. We agree. Although\nthe EPA thoroughly explained why it chose to impose one\nGACT standard instead of another, nothing in the record\nexplains why the EPA decided to impose GACT standards\ninstead of MACT standards in the first place. Despite the\nAgency’s broad discretion, we cannot sustain its action in the\nabsence of some explanation for why GACT standards are\nmore appropriate than MACT standards for these sources and\ntypes of pollutants. See Transactive Corp., 91 F.3d at 236.\nFor this reason, we remand (but do not vacate) the EPA’s\nchoice of GACT standards for non-Hg emissions from coal-\n\f                              127\n\nfired boilers. See Sierra Club, 167 F.3d at 664; Nat’l Lime\nAss’n, 233 F.3d at 634-35.\n\n     2. EPA’s Selection of Certain GACT Standards\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners also challenge several of\nthe EPA’s choices among different GACT standards. As\nnoted, see supra § I.A.1.c, the CAA provides virtually no\ninstruction regarding GACT standards but the standards\ngenerally take the form of “methods, practices and techniques\nwhich are commercially available and appropriate for\napplication by the sources in the category considering\neconomic impacts and the technical capabilities of the firms\nto operate and maintain the emissions control systems.” S.\nREP. NO. 101-228, at 171 (1989). Because the EPA has\nample discretion to choose the appropriate GACT standard,\nwe will affirm its choices so long as we can discern reasoned\ndecision-making from the record. State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.\nFor the reasons set forth below, we can do so here and,\naccordingly, we reject the Environmental Petitioners’ GACT-\nfocused challenges.\n\n      First, the Environmental Petitioners challenge the data set\nthe EPA used to arrive at the numeric GACT standards for\nnon-Hg-metal emissions from coal-fired boilers. Specifically,\nthey contend that the EPA set the GACT limit based on\nboilers with no control technology, which resulted in a\nnumeric standard of 0.42 lb/mmBtu. They insist that the EPA\nshould instead have examined boilers outfitted with fabric\nfilters, which would have resulted in a numeric standard of\n0.03 lb/mmBtu. The EPA, however, thoroughly explained\nwhy it considered the uncontrolled boiler data set.\nSpecifically, the controlled data set derives from the EPA’s\n“New Source Performance Standards” (NSPS) data, which, in\n\f                               128\n\nthe Agency’s view, could be used to set the non-Hg-metal\nGACT standard for boilers with a heat input capacity of 30\nmmBtu/hr or greater but did not suffice for boilers with a\nlower heat input capacity. For this reason, the EPA examined\nits original data set, found that none of the coal-fired boilers\nin that set used control technology and, accordingly, set the\nGACT numeric standard at the emissions level achieved by\nthe best performing uncontrolled source in that data set (i.e.,\n0.42 lb/mmBtu). We are satisfied that the EPA exercised its\ndiscretion in a reasoned manner and, accordingly, we do not\ndisturb it. See Transactive Corp., 91 F.3d at 236.\n\n     Next, the Environmental Petitioners challenge the EPA’s\ndecision to establish a tune-up requirement as a GACT\nmanagement-practice standard for Hg and POM emissions\nfrom large biomass-fired and oil-fired boilers. In their view,\nother, more restrictive control technologies, including\nmulticlones,38 are “generally available” and their availability\nmandates that the EPA set numeric standards based on boilers\nthat use those controls. But the EPA explained its approach:\n\n         A boiler tune-up requirement would potentially\n         result in the same non-mercury metallic HAP\n         reduction as a PM emission limit based on\n         performance of multiclones but would also\n         reduce emissions of organic HAP. In addition\n         the cost of a boiler tune-up appears minimal\n         compared to the cost for testing and\n\n\n    38\n         A multiclone is a PM “mechanical separator[].” See 2010\nProposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,908. It diverts\nparticles from the exhaust stream by creating a circular air flow.\nSee id.\n\f                             129\n\n       monitoring to demonstrate compliance with an\n       emission limit.\n\nSee 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,908.\nThe EPA also explained that multiclones were “minimally\neffective” for controlling non-Hg metals, ineffective for POM\nand Hg, and expensive. Id. Because the EPA’s decision to\nimpose a tune-up requirement fits within its “technical\nexpertise,” we owe the Agency an “extreme degree of\ndeference” so long as its explanation is rational. Catawba\nCty., N.C. v. EPA, 571 F.3d 20, 41 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting\nCity of Waukesha v. EPA, 320 F.3d 228, 247 (D.C. Cir.\n2003)). And because its explanation was rational, we reject\nthe Petitioners’ challenge thereto.\n\n     Finally, the Petitioners challenge the EPA’s decision to\nset a tune-up requirement as a management-practice standard\nfor small biomass-fired and oil-fired area boilers. The EPA\nadopted this approach because measuring PM emissions for\nsmaller boilers is “not feasible.” 2010 Proposed Area Boilers\nRule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,906. When the EPA explained its\ndecision regarding small biomass-fired and oil-fired area\nboilers, it provided the same reasons it gave for its use of a\ntune-up requirement for small coal-fired area boilers, which\nwe address (and uphold), infra, § IV.M. For those reasons,\nwe reject the challenge to the EPA’s tune-up requirement for\nsmall biomass-fired and oil-fired area boilers.\n\n               I. 30-DAY ROLLING AVERAGE\n\n     As discussed, see supra § I.B.1.a, when the EPA sets a\nMACT floor, it begins by examining data generated by stack\ntesting. Once the MACT standard is established, however, a\nsource may (and in some cases, must) demonstrate\ncompliance by implementing “continuous monitoring” instead\n\f                               130\n\nof conducting additional stack tests.39 See 2011 Proposed\nCISWI Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,464-65.\nFor a source using a continuous monitor, the EPA determines\nMACT-standard compliance based on the source’s thirty-day\n“rolling average.” Id. at 80,465.\n\n     The calculation of a thirty-day rolling average is\nstraightforward: the average of a source’s daily emissions for\nthe immediately preceding thirty days. Each day produces a\nnew rolling average and each “average is a separate\ncompliance determination.” No. 11-1125 EPA Br. 88 n.17.\nIn the EPA’s view, this “allow[s] operators sufficient\nflexibility for operational and control device adjustments\nshould they be needed for short term fuel or waste\ncharacteristics variability.” 2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on\nReconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,465. The EPA also\nconcluded that thirty-day rolling average violations will occur\nalmost as frequently as violations of shorter rolling-average\nperiods. Id.\n\n     The CAA vests the EPA with authority to “prescribe\nprocedures and methods for determining compliance and for\nmonitoring and analysis of pollutants.” 42 U.S.C. § 7661c(b).\nWe have emphasized that the EPA has “broad discretion in\nselecting a monitoring regime that ensures compliance, and as\nlong as it reasonably articulate[s] the basis for its decision,\n[we] will defer to the informed discretion of the Agency,\n\n    39\n         As the name suggests, a continuous monitoring system\nmeasures the source’s emissions at all times and generally takes one\nof two forms: (1) a continuous parameter monitor, which measures,\ne.g., a source’s temperature, pressure or oxygen content; or (2) a\ncontinuous emissions monitor, which measures the pollutant\nconcentration in the source’s emissions.\n\f                               131\n\nrecognizing that analysis of this issue requires a high level of\nexpertise.” White Stallion Energy Ctr., LLC v. EPA, 748 F.3d\n1222, 1255 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted), rev’d on other grounds by\nMichigan v. EPA, 135 S. Ct. 2699 (2015). Notwithstanding\nthis deference, the Environmental Petitioners argue that\nallowing a source to demonstrate compliance by way of a\nthirty-day rolling average not only fails Chevron review but is\nalso arbitrary. We disagree.\n\n     First, they argue that the thirty-day rolling average fails at\nChevron step 1 because it allows sources to emit HAPs\ncontinuously at the UPL-established MACT floor. Because\nthey do not believe that the UPL represents the average\nemissions level achieved by the best performing sources, they\nargue that, ipso facto, allowing sources to continuously emit\nHAPs at the UPL level means that sources are permitted to\nemit at levels higher than the average levels achieved by the\nbest performing sources. Because we have already concluded\nthat the UPL is in fact a reasonable proxy for the average\nemissions level achieved by the best performing sources, see\nsupra § IV.C, the Environmental Petitioners’ premise is\ninaccurate. And because the “total emissions from a unit\ncomplying with a rolling average must still be below the total\nemissions from a unit emitting continuously at the level of the\nstandard,” No. 11-1125 EPA Br. 90, the Environmental\nPetitioners’ Chevron step 1 argument fails.\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners’ Chevron step 2 argument\nfares no better. The EPA explained that (1) it expects to catch\nviolations using a thirty-day rolling average “almost as much\nas for a shorter term average” and (2) it believes the longer\naverage to be more effective in addressing “[c]oncerns of\nvariability outside the operators[’] control such as fuel\n\f                                132\n\ncontent, seasonal factors, load cycling, and infrequent hours\nof needed operation.” 2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on\nReconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,465. Because the EPA\n“reasonably articulate[d] the basis for its decision,” we uphold\nit. White Stallion, 748 F.3d at 1255 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n     Finally, we conclude that the EPA’s allowance of thirty-\nday rolling averaging does not reflect an arbitrary change in\nposition. Although the Petitioners cite other rules that, in\ntheir view, manifest that the EPA once believed that longer\naveraging periods resulted in less stringent enforcement, most\nof the rules they cite have nothing to do with MACT-setting\nor MACT compliance40 and none evidences an unexplained or\nunjustified deviation. Similarly, the Petitioners point to the\nEPA’s explanation in the 2011 CISWI Rule that “24-hour\nblock averages . . . would be inconsistent with the sampling\ntime for the stack test data” to indicate an arbitrary change in\nposition. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,728. But the EPA made this\nstatement while discussing why stack-test data and\ncontinuous-monitoring data could not be used in tandem to set\na MACT level, which says nothing about allowing emissions\n\n    40\n         The only exception is the EPA’s 1996 Medical-Waste\nIncinerators Rule, which provides that “[t]he period of time over\nwhich emissions are measured and then averaged to determine\ncompliance with the regulation . . . must correspond to the period of\ntime over which emission levels were measured and averaged in\ndetermining the emission limits included in the regulation.”\nStandards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and\nEmission Guidelines for Existing Sources: Medical Waste\nIncinerators, 61 Fed. Reg. 31,736, 31,748 (June 20, 1996). This\ntwenty-year-old statement, however, does not detract from the\nEPA’s well-reasoned defense of the thirty-day rolling average in\nthe CISWI Rule.\n\f                              133\n\naveraging—long-term or otherwise—to gauge MACT-floor\ncompliance. See id. And even if the Environmental\nPetitioners had directed us to a real about-face, the EPA’s\njustification for allowing the thirty-day rolling average\nconvinces us that any change was not arbitrary.\n\n       J. FUEL-COMBUSTION-BASED SUBCATEGORIES\n\n    Section 7412 provides that the EPA may distinguish\namong “classes, types, and sizes” of sources when\nestablishing emission standards. 42 U.S.C. § 7412(c), (d)(1).\nUnder this authority, the EPA created subcategories of major\nsource boilers based on the fuel the boiler was designed to\nburn. 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,144. The\nEnvironmental Petitioners challenge this decision on three\ngrounds: First, they claim that the text of the statute\nforecloses the EPA from creating such subcategories. Next,\nthey argue that the EPA’s subcategories are arbitrary because\nthey permit a boiler to switch subcategories from year to year.\nFinally, they contend that the EPA’s action was arbitrary\nbecause the Agency failed to demonstrate with substantial\nevidence that burning a different fuel alters the boiler’s class,\ntype, or size.\n\n     These arguments fail. Section 7412(d) gives the EPA\ndiscretion to create subcategories based on boiler type, and\nnothing in the statute forecloses the Agency from doing so\nbased on the type of fuel a boiler was designed to burn. Nor\nwas the EPA’s decision to create such subcategories arbitrary\nand capricious. The Agency considered the relevant factors in\ncoming to a reasoned decision that the type of fuel a boiler is\ndesigned to burn impacts the feasibility of emission standards.\nAnd, finally, the EPA based its technical judgment on\nsufficient record evidence. As a result, we deny the\n\f                              134\n\nEnvironmental Petitioners’ challenge to the EPA’s\nsubcategorization of major source boilers based on the type of\nfuel the boiler is designed to burn.\n\n      The Environmental Petitioners first claim that the text of\nthe CAA forecloses the EPA from creating subcategories of\n“types” of boilers based on the fuel a boiler burns because a\nsingle boiler may use different fuels over the course of its\nlifetime. This may be true, but the Petitioners never explain\nwhat it is about the word “type” that bars the EPA from\nregulating a boiler that burns “x” differently from a boiler that\nburns “y.” According to its ordinary meaning, “type” is easily\nbroad enough to accommodate changes in boiler\ncharacteristics from year to year. See OXFORD ENGLISH\nDICTIONARY (2013) (defining “type” as a “general form,\nstructure, or character distinguishing a particular kind, group,\nor class of beings or objects”). There is no textual reason then\nto assume that a boiler’s type must be written in stone.\n\n     Nor does our understanding of “type” write it out of the\nstatute, as the Petitioners contend. The EPA has done what\nthe term plainly encompasses: it has distinguished among\nboilers based on the kind of fuel the boiler burned over the\nlast year. It is thus not surprising that we have interpreted a\nsimilar provision to permit distinctions based on fuel inputs.\nSee Sierra Club v. Costle, 657 F.2d 298, 318-19 (D.C. Cir.\n1981) (holding that the text of 42 U.S.C. § 7411, which\nallows the EPA to “distinguish among classes, types and\nsizes,” permits distinctions based on variations in the sulfur\ncontent of coal used by utility plants). Likewise, we conclude\nthat section 7412’s undefined and unrestricted use of class,\ntype, or size does not foreclose the EPA’s interpretation.\n\f                             135\n\n     This court will, as a result, defer to the EPA’s\ninterpretation so long as it is reasonable. See, e.g., Sierra\nClub I, 353 F.3d at 990. And here, it is. The Agency\nexplained that boilers vary in their designs depending on the\ntype of fuel they burn. 2010 Proposed Major Boilers Rule, 75\nFed. Reg. at 32,016-17. These differences, according to the\nAgency, affect boiler emissions and the feasibility of emission\ncontrols. Id. And, because design constraints also restrict a\nboiler’s ability to switch fuels, the Agency concluded that it\ncould determine a boiler’s type by looking at the fuel it had\nburned over the previous 12-month period. Id. at 32,014.\nThe Environmental Petitioners point to nothing in the record\nthat calls into question either of these technical judgments,\nwhich receive great deference. See NRDC I, 489 F.3d at\n1375. Nor do the Petitioners offer any additional reasons in\nsupport of their argument that the Agency has ventured\nbeyond its authority under the statute. In fact, the EPA’s\nreasoning from the emissions data is consistent with the very\nexistence of a subcategorization authority because the grant of\nthis authority implicitly acknowledges that the EPA may need\nto set different emission standards within a category of major\nsources based on what is achievable for a subset of those\nsources. Because the statutory text readily encompasses the\nEPA’s interpretation for the reasons explained above, and\nbecause the Environmental Petitioners offer no additional\nargument as to why the EPA’s interpretation was\nunreasonable, we reject the Petitioners’ Chevron challenge to\nthe EPA’s interpretation of its subcategorization authority.\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners nevertheless claim that the\nEPA’s subcategories are arbitrary because a boiler is not of a\ndifferent type when it can be a boiler “designed to burn coal”\none year, and a boiler “designed to burn biomass” the next.\nBut this argument fails for the same reasons as the Chevron\n\f                              136\n\nargument we just rejected. The fact that boilers may switch\nfrom one type to another over time does not, alone, render a\nsubcategorization arbitrary. With no discernable basis to find\nthe EPA’s choice here questionable, much less arbitrary, we\nreject this argument too.\n\n     Finally, the Environmental Petitioners contend that the\nAgency failed to demonstrate with sufficient evidence, rather\nthan mere assertions, that burning a different fuel makes the\nboiler a different class, type, or size. The Petitioners largely\nfail to develop this argument and, regardless, the EPA easily\nmet its burden. The EPA based its decision on documented\nemissions data, several reports provided by the National\nEnergy Technology Laboratory on boiler operations, and\noperating manuals provided by boiler manufacturers. See,\ne.g., Summary of Public Comments and Responses for\nNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for\nMajor Sources: Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional\nBoilers and Process Heaters, EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0058-\n3511-A1 (Dec. 2012), at 558-63. These sources support the\nEPA’s decision to distinguish boilers based on the type of fuel\nthey are designed to burn and the Agency’s conclusion that\nboilers designed for one fuel type are unlikely to use another\nfuel type. Id. The Petitioners present no contrary evidence,\nnor do they attack the validity or accuracy of the data that the\nEPA relied upon. We thus find no merit in the Petitioners’\nvarious challenges to the EPA’s decision to subcategorize\nmajor boilers based on the fuel the boiler is designed to burn.\n\n   K. “UNITS THAT BEGIN COMBUSTING SOLID WASTE”\n               AS “EXISTING” SOURCES\n\n    Section 7429(a)(2) distinguishes between “existing” and\n“new” CISWI units. The former must comply with floors set\n\f                              137\n\nat the “average emissions limitation achieved by the best\nperforming 12 percent of units” and the latter must comply\nwith stricter floors set at the level achieved by “the best\ncontrolled similar unit.” 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2). “Modified”\nunits, defined as units “at which modifications have occurred”\nthat either experience changes that cost more than 50 per cent\nof the original construction price or result in increased\nemissions, see id. § 7429(g)(3), must be treated as “new,” see\nid. § 7429(g)(2).\n\n     The preamble to the 2011 CISWI Rule states, “[u]nits\nthat begin combusting solid waste are considered existing\nsources.”       76 Fed. Reg. at 15,714 (emphasis added).\nCommentators objected that this blanket statement\ncontravened the Act’s plain terms, which mandate that the\nEPA treat such sources as “new,” not “existing,” if they meet\nthe section 7429(g)(3) requirements. In its subsequent 2011\nProposed CISWI Rule on Reconsideration, the EPA refined\nits position: “An existing source will not be considered a new\nsource solely due to a combustion material switch. Assuming\nnew source applicability is not triggered, existing sources that\nchange fuels or materials are considered existing\nsources . . . .” 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,459.\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners argue that the EPA’s\nbroad statement in the 2011 CISWI Rule indicates that it\nimpermissibly changed its treatment of “modified sources” in\ncontravention of the CAA. The EPA, however, agrees that\nany CISWI unit fitting the statutory criteria for a modified\nsource must comply with new-unit MACT levels, not\nexisting-unit MACT levels. See 42 U.S.C § 7429(g)(2). It\nalso recognizes that its categorical statement in the 2011\nCISWI Rule “may have been imprecise” and, in any event, it\n\f                              138\n\nargues that the Environmental Petitioners have taken its\nstatement out of context. See No. 11-1125 EPA Br. 73.\n\n     We agree with the Agency. The EPA’s later statement\nmade clear that it intended to treat “sources that change fuels\nor materials” as “existing sources” unless “new source\napplicability,” as mandated by the Act, is “triggered.” See\n2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 80,459. Moreover, the Agency provided its more precise\nstatement while discussing specifically what constitutes a\n“modification” for the CISWI Rule. See id. (“An existing\nsource will not be considered a new source solely due to a\ncombustion material switch.”).          It made its earlier,\n“imprecise” comment, in contrast, while describing when a\nfuel change could mean the difference between regulation\nunder section 7412 or section 7429. See 2011 CISWI Rule,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 15,714. Convinced that the EPA has not\nimpermissibly changed the statutory definition of “modified”\nCISWI, we reject the Petitioners’ challenge.\n\n  L. EXCLUSION OF “TEMPORARY” BOILERS FROM AREA\n                   BOILERS RULE\n\n     In the final 2013 Area Boilers Rule, the EPA excluded\n“temporary boilers” from regulation under section 7412. See\n78 Fed. Reg. at 7,491. The Rule defined “temporary boilers”\nas “any gaseous or liquid fuel boiler that is designed to, and is\ncapable of, being carried or moved from one location to\nanother by means of, for example, wheels, skids, carrying\nhandles, dollies, trailers, or platforms.” Id. Moreover, a\nboiler is not a temporary boiler if any of the following apply:\n\f                              139\n\n   (1)   The equipment is attached to a foundation.\n\n   (2)   The boiler or a replacement remains at a\n         location within the facility and performs the\n         same or similar function for more than 12\n         consecutive months, unless the regulatory\n         agency approves an extension. An extension\n         may be granted by the regulatory agency\n         upon petition by the owner or operator of a\n         unit specifying the basis for such a request.\n         Any temporary boiler that replaces a\n         temporary boiler at a location within the\n         facility and performs the same or similar\n         function will be included in calculating the\n         consecutive time period unless there is a gap\n         in operation of 12 months or more.\n\n   (3)   The equipment is located at a seasonal\n         facility and operates during the full annual\n         operating period of the seasonal facility,\n         remains at the facility for at least 2 years, and\n         operates at that facility for at least 3 months\n         of each year.\n\n   (4)   The equipment is moved from one location\n         to another within the facility but continues to\n         perform the same or similar function and\n         serve the same electricity, steam, and/or hot\n         water system in an attempt to circumvent the\n         residence time requirements of this\n         definition.\n\n2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,491-92.\n\f                              140\n\n    Environmental Petitioners challenge this exclusion as a\nviolation of the EPA’s obligations under the CAA to regulate\nall boilers listed under section 7412. By its own terms, the\n2011 Area Boilers Rule “applies to all existing and new\nindustrial boilers, institutional boilers, and commercial boilers\nlocated at area sources. Boiler means an enclosed combustion\ndevice having the primary purpose of recovering thermal\nenergy in the form of steam or hot water.” 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,557; see also 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,554 (“EPA is\npromulgating national emission standards for control of\nhazardous air pollutants from two area source categories:\nIndustrial boilers and commercial and institutional boilers.”).\nEnvironmental Petitioners claim the general term “boiler”\nnecessarily encompasses temporary boilers: “[T]he category\nof ‘boilers’ plainly includes temporary boilers, just as the\ncategory of ‘courts’ includes federal courts, or the category of\n‘dogs’ includes brown dogs.” No. 11-1141, Envtl. Pet’rs’\nReply Br. 7. According to Petitioners, then, sections 7412(c)\nand 7412(d) of the CAA require the EPA to issue emission\nstandards for temporary boilers as well as “permanent”\nboilers. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(c)(2) (“For the categories and\nsubcategories            the          Administrator         lists,\nthe Administrator shall establish emission standards . . . .”);\nid. § 7412(d)(1) (“The Administrator shall promulgate\nregulations establishing emission standards for each category\nor subcategory of major sources and area sources of\nhazardous air pollutants listed for regulation . . . .”).\n\n    To the extent Environmental Petitioners challenge as\nunreasonable the EPA’s justifications for declining to set\nemission standards for temporary boilers, they cannot prevail.\n“Under       arbitrary-and-capricious     review,      EPA’s\ndeterminations are presumptively valid provided [they] meet[]\na minimum rationality standard.” Nat’l Ass’n for Surface\n\f                              141\n\nFinishing, 795 F.3d at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSo the question is whether the EPA offered a sufficiently\nrational explanation for its exclusion of temporary boilers.\nThe EPA has done so here. First, contrary to Petitioners’\nclaims, temporary boilers were never considered an\ninexorable part of the “industrial boiler” category section\n7412 requires the EPA to regulate. While the EPA only\nlisted generic area source categories—“industrial boilers” and\n“institutional/commercial boilers”—in its 1999 rulemaking, it\nhas since refined these broad categories pursuant to its\nstatutory authority. See National Air Toxics Program: The\nIntegrated Urban Strategy, 64 Fed. Reg. 38,706, 38,721 tbl.2\n(July 19, 1999). In doing so, the EPA excluded several other\nsubgroups of boilers that might otherwise be read as falling\nunder one of the general boiler categories. See, e.g., 2013\nArea Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,492 (excluding boilers\nalready regulated by other MACT standards); 2011 Proposed\nArea Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,539\n(excluding electric and residential boilers as not part of either\nsource category). The EPA’s clarification that temporary\nboilers were never considered part of the “industrial boilers”\ncategory was simply another refinement, as contemplated by\nthe statute. See 42 U.S.C § 7412(e)(4) (precluding judicial\nreview until the EPA has issued its final emission standards\nfor a category or subcategory).\n\n     Second, as both the EPA and Industry Intervenors note,\nthe parallel rule for major source boilers has always explicitly\nexcluded temporary boilers from its “industrial boiler”\ncategorization. See 40 C.F.R. § 63.7491(j). The EPA thus\nconsidered commenters’ requests to add a similar clarification\nto the 2013 Area Boilers Rule and reasonably decided to do\nso.    See, e.g., American Forest & Paper Association,\nComments on Proposed Area Source Rule (AF&PA\n\f                              142\n\nComments), EPA-HQ-OAR-2006-0790-1939 (Aug. 23,\n2010), at 58 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 389). EPA explained this\nchoice in its proposed rule:\n\n       Owners and operators of regulated sources\n       have pointed out that temporary boilers are\n       small (less than 10 MMBtu/hr heat input) and\n       are generally owned and operated by\n       contractors, rather than the facility. As a\n       result, they are not included in the facility’s\n       operating permits because state and federal\n       CAA operating permit programs have\n       historically   classified    such      units    as\n       insignificant sources.      The owners and\n       operators also noted that compliance with the\n       work practice requirements applicable to these\n       small boilers would be complicated because\n       they are typically located on site for less than a\n       year, but would be subject to biennial\n       management practice requirements. We agree\n       that the source category identified in subpart\n       JJJJJJ should specifically exclude these\n       temporary boilers because they have been\n       considered insignificant sources, and were not\n       included in the EPA’s analysis of the source\n       category.\n\n2011 Proposed Area Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 80,535.\n\n    The unique nature of temporary boilers favors their\nexclusion. These boilers tend to be rented for use on a\ntemporary basis and come in “shop-fabricated package\ndesigns.” AF&PA Comments, at 58 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 389).\n\f                               143\n\nTemporary boilers also “typically only fire gas or liquid fossil\nfuels (natural gas or distillate oil) which may be cleaner than\nthe boiler(s) they are temporarily replacing. In addition, these\nunits often do not have exhaust stacks that meet EPA Method\n1 requirements for application of test methods.”               Id.\nRegardless, during the rulemaking, Environmental Petitioners\nargued the EPA had “not explained why this is a distinction\nthat justifies differential treatment, let alone an exemption.”\nSee Area Boilers Rule—Responses to Comments, at 65. The\nEPA responded by explaining that rather than having “created\na category or subcategory of ‘temporary boilers’ and then\nexempted them from the standards,” the Agency never\n“intend[ed] to regulate temporary boilers under the area\nsource standards” in the first place. See id. The EPA further\nnoted that, “[b]y their nature of being temporary, these boilers\noperate in place of another non-temporary boiler while that\nboiler is being constructed, replaced or repaired, in which\ncase we counted the non-temporary boiler as the one being\nregulated.” Id. Finally, the Agency concluded regulation of\ntemporary boilers was not necessary to meet its statutory\nemission requirements under sections 7412(c)(6) and\n7412(c)(3) of the CAA. Id. In its final rule, the EPA\nreiterated this explanation: “Similar to residential boilers, we\ndid not intend to regulate temporary boilers under the area\nsource standards because they are not part of either the\nindustrial      boiler      source      category      or      the\ncommercial/institutional boiler source category.” 2013 Area\nBoilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,491. The final regulation also\nincluded a detailed explanation of how EPA decided on its\nlimited definition of “temporary boilers.” See id. at 7,499.\n\n   The evidence before the Agency supported its decision to\nexclude temporary boilers. Indeed, the EPA “cogently\nexplain[ed]” why it exercised its discretion in this manner,\n\f                               144\n\nsuch that this court concludes the Agency’s choice “was the\nproduct of reasoned decision making.” U.S. Telecom Ass’n v.\nFCC, 227 F.3d 450, 460 (D.C. Cir. 2000). We therefore\nuphold the EPA’s exclusion of temporary boilers from\nregulation of area source boilers.\n\n    M. WORK-PRACTICE STANDARDS FOR COAL-FIRED\n                    BOILERS\n\n     When setting emission limits for area sources, the EPA\nenjoys greater discretion than when setting limits for major\nsources. With respect to major sources, the EPA has to\npromulgate MACT standards, see 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2),\nwhereas for area sources the EPA can generally promulgate\nmore lenient GACT standards, see id. § 7412(d)(5). The\nCAA, however, singles out seven particularly hazardous\npollutants that require stricter regulatory standards, even for\narea sources.41 Under section 7412(c)(6), the EPA must “list\ncategories and subcategories of sources assuring that sources\naccounting for not less than 90 per centum of the aggregate\nemissions of each such pollutant” are regulated. The EPA\nlisted a variety of area sources under section 7412(c)(6) in its\n1998 rulemaking based on their Hg and POM emissions. See\nProposed 2010 Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,898;\nSource Category Listing for Section 112(d)(2) Rulemaking\nPursuant to Section 112(c)(6) Requirements, 63 Fed. Reg.\n17,838, 17,849-50 (Apr. 10, 1998).            But the Agency\nsubsequently refined that list and ultimately concluded only\n\n    41\n         These seven pollutants are: (i) alkylated lead compounds,\n(ii) polycyclic organic matter (POM), (iii) hexachlorobenzene, (iv)\nmercury (Hg), (v) polychlorinated biphenyls, (vi) 2,3,7,8-\ntetrachlorodibenzofurans, and (vii) 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-\ndioxin. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(c)(6).\n\f                               145\n\ncoal-fired area boilers needed to be listed to meet the statute’s\n90 per cent emissions threshold. See 2010 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,898; see also No. 11-1141\nEPA Br. 14 (“[T]he coal-fired subcategory is responsible for\nover 82 percent of the mercury emissions from the [area\nsource] category in the inventory, even though it represents\nonly 2 percent of the boilers in the category.”).\n\n     Under section 7412(c)(6), the EPA was therefore\nrequired to set either a MACT limit under section 7412(d)(2),\na health threshold under section 7412(d)(4), or a work-\npractice standard under section 7412(h) for all coal-fired\nboilers. The Agency chose to set MACT numerical emission\nlimits for Hg and CO42 at new and existing large coal-fired\nboilers. 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,488.\nHowever, the EPA found it “technologically and\neconomically impracticable to apply [its] measurement\nmethodology to . . . small sources,” and so it chose to institute\na work-practice standard43 for all new and existing small coal-\nfired boilers. Id. at 7,488-89. This work-practice standard\nrequires small coal-fired units to be periodically tuned up but\ndoes not impose any numeric emission limit. See id. The\nEPA similarly decided that, for large coal-fired boilers\nundergoing a startup or a shutdown, a work-practice\nstandard—rather than a numeric emission standard—was\n\n    42\n          Because the EPA chose to regulate POM emissions\nindirectly—by using CO emissions as a surrogate—the standards it\nset under section 7412(c)(6) are for CO rather than POM. See 2013\nArea Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,488, 7,503.\n    43\n        In their brief, Environmental Petitioners alternate between\nthe terms “operational standards” and “work-practice standards,”\nboth of which fall under section 7412(d)(2)(D). This opinion will\nuse “work-practice standards” for simplicity.\n\f                             146\n\nmost practicable. See id. at 7,518 tbl.2 (requiring owners of\nlarge “[e]xisting or new coal-fired” boilers to “[m]inimize the\nboiler’s startup and shutdown periods and conduct startups\nand shutdowns according to the manufacturer’s recommended\nprocedures”).\n\n      Environmental Petitioners challenge the EPA’s decision\nto employ work-practice standards as a violation of\n7412(d)(2)’s mandate to achieve the “maximum degree of\nreduction in emissions.” We examine Petitioner’s statutory\nargument step-by-step, as it hinges on the interplay between\nseveral statutory provisions. First, section 7412(c)(6)—which\ngoverns regulation of Hg and POM emissions—requires the\nAdministrator to regulate sources of these pollutants under\neither section 7412(d)(2) or (d)(4). Section 7412(d)(4) allows\nthe Administrator to establish health-based emission\nstandards; it is not implicated here. Instead, the EPA decided\nto regulate coal-fired boilers under section 7412(d)(2).\nSection 7412(d)(2) instructs the Administrator to achieve “the\nmaximum degree of reduction in emissions of the hazardous\nair pollutants . . . that the Administrator, taking into\nconsideration the cost of achieving such emissions reduction,\nand any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and\nenergy requirements, determines is achievable for new or\nexisting sources.” The Administrator is authorized to use\nseveral means to achieve this reduction including\nimplementing “design, equipment, work practice, or\noperational standards . . . as provided in [section 7412(h)].”\n42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2)(D). Section 7412(h)(1) states: “[I]f it\nis not feasible in the judgment of the Administrator to\nprescribe or enforce an emission standard for control of a\n[pollutant], the Administrator may, in lieu thereof, promulgate\na . . . work-practice    standard . . . ,   which      in   the\nAdministrator’s judgment is consistent with the provisions of\n\f                              147\n\nsubsection (d) or (f) of this section.” Petitioners do not\ndispute the EPA’s ability to set work-practice standards here;\nthey instead focus on section 7412(h)’s requirement that any\nsuch standards be “consistent with” subsection (d)—which\nrequires the “maximum degree of reduction in emissions.”\nAccording to Petitioners, the EPA’s decision to set these\nparticular work-practice standards fails at both Chevron steps.\n\n     With respect to Chevron step 1, Petitioners argue the\n“EPA does not claim the operational standards [for coal-fired\nboilers] are ‘consistent with the provisions of subsection (d)\nor (f)’ of § 7412.” No. 11-1141 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 33. In other\nwords, because these work-practice standards “do not even\npurport” to be consistent with section 7412(d)’s mandate to\nmaximize reduction of emissions, “they are unlawful under\nChevron step one.” Id. Petitioners point to the EPA’s\nspecific findings to support this claim: for large coal-fired\nboilers, the EPA found that mercury emissions could be\nreduced by 75 to 82 per cent through the use of a fabric filter.\nId. But, according to Petitioners, the “EPA admits the tune-\nup program [for small coal-fired boilers] will reduce\nemissions by only one percent.” Id. And, with respect to\nlarge coal-fired boilers undergoing startup or shutdown,\nPetitioners argue the “EPA does not claim that ‘following the\nmanufacturer’s recommended procedures’ during startup and\nshutdown will reduce emissions at all.” Id.\n\n     At the familiar Chevron step 1, the court must “first\nexamine the statute de novo, employing traditional tools of\nstatutory construction.” Nat’l Ass’n of Clean Air Agencies,\n489 F.3d at 1228 (internal quotation marks omitted). If the\nCongress’s intent is clear, then the Agency’s interpretation is\nafforded no deference, and the court “must give effect to the\nunambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Id.\n\f                              148\n\n     In this case, Environmental Petitioners place too much\nemphasis on certain snippets of the statute without examining\nthe larger context. For one, Petitioners seem to argue that the\nEPA must adopt work-practice standards that result in the\nmaximum possible reduction of emissions, without taking into\naccount any other considerations. But section 7412(d)(2)\nitself belies this claim: it says the EPA must promulgate\nstandards that require “the maximum degree of reduction in\nemissions . . . that the Administrator, taking into\nconsideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction,\nand any non-air quality health and environmental impacts\nand energy requirements, determines is achievable.” 42\nU.S.C. § 7412(d)(2) (emphasis added). This portion of the\nstatute explicitly defers to the Administrator’s judgment\nregarding a standard’s “achievability,” even though it directs\nhim to consider particular factors in making that assessment.\nSection 7412(h) similarly requires the Administrator to adopt\na work-practice standard that in his judgment is consistent\nwith section 7412(d)(2)’s mandate. We therefore cannot\naccept Petitioners’ suggestion that Congress unambiguously\nrequired the EPA to adopt standards that result in the\nmaximum reduction of emissions that is technologically\nfeasible.\n\n     Environmental Petitioners’ challenge to these work-\npractice standards as unreasonable under Chevron step 2 and\narbitrary under State Farm presents a closer call. With\nrespect to Chevron step 2, the court must “uphold an agency’s\ninterpretation if it is reasonable.” Ariz. Pub. Serv. Co. v. EPA,\n211 F.3d 1280, 1287 (D.C. Cir. 2000). And, “even where\nEPA’s construction satisfies Chevron, [the court] still must\nensure that its action is not otherwise arbitrary and capricious.\nThe arbitrary and capricious standard is ‘[h]ighly deferential,’\nand it ‘presumes the validity of agency action.’” Nat’l Ass’n\n\f                             149\n\nof Clean Air Agencies, 489 F.3d at 1228 (citations omitted).\nAs long as an agency has “considered the relevant factors and\narticulated ‘a rational connection between the facts found and\nthe choice made,’” then its decision must be upheld. Allied\nLocal & Reg’l Mfrs. Caucus, 215 F.3d at 68.\n\n     Petitioners mount both a “facial” and a substantive\nchallenge to the EPA’s rationale for adopting work-practice\nstandards. First, Petitioners claim the EPA’s decision is\narbitrary because it fails “to reconcile its approach with the\nstatutory requirement [of section 7412(d)(2)].” No. 11-1141\nEnvtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 34. Specifically, Petitioners insist the EPA\nmust explicitly state somewhere that these particular work-\npractice standards are “consistent” with section 7412(d)(2).\nSee id. at 33-34. Otherwise, Petitioners contend, the Court\nmust simply “assume that the Agency heeded § 7412(h)’s\n‘consistent with’ requirement, notwithstanding the EPA’s\nfailure to acknowledge and apply that requirement in the\nrecord.” No. 11-1141 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Reply Br. 10.\n\n      The Agency responds that, “by identifying the tune-up\nand startup/shutdown requirements as ‘work practices,’ [it] is\nstating that those standards are issued under section 7412(h)\nand are consistent with the requirements of section 7412(d)\n(i.e., MACT).” No. 11-1141, EPA Br. 71. The EPA did\nacknowledge it has an obligation to maximize emission\nreductions under section 7412(d)(2) when promulgating\nwork-practice standards. See 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,568 (“CAA section 112(h) authorizes the\nAdministrator to promulgate [a work-practice standard]\nconsistent with the provisions of CAA sections 112(d) or\n(f) . . . .”). However, Petitioners are correct that the Agency\ndid not make a finding on the record that these work-practice\n\f                             150\n\nstandards would achieve the highest emissions reduction\npossible.\n\n     But the lack of an explicit statement does not\nautomatically condemn this portion of the rule. See Bowman,\n419 U.S. at 286 (“[W]e will uphold a decision of less than\nideal clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be\ndiscerned.”). The Petitioners offer no support for their\ncontention that the EPA must make an express finding that its\nstandards are “consistent” with section 7412(d)(2). Nor does\nour conclusion requires us to merely “assume” that the\nAgency’s actions comport with section 7412(d)(2). Instead,\nas we usually do when presented with such arguments, we\nreview the rulemaking record to determine whether the\njustifications the EPA offered for adopting these work\npractices standards were permissible.\n\n                1. Small Coal-Fired Boilers\n\n     First, with respect to small coal-fired boilers, the EPA\ndetermined that a biennial tune-up requirement would best\ncomply with section 7412(h)’s requirements. As a starting\npoint, the EPA surveyed a sample of state regulations\nmandating various work-practice standards for small coal-\nfired boilers; the Agency found that ten states required tune-\nups, two required periodic inspections, one required operator\ntraining, and one required operation in accordance with\nmanufacturer specifications. 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,573-74. The EPA thus concluded that tune-ups\nwere the most typical work-practice standard employed for\nthis type of boiler. Id. The Agency also found that regular\ntune-ups could lower HAP emissions by increasing the\nefficiency of small coal-fired boilers. See id. at 15,575 (“A\ntune-up performed to the manufacturer’s specifications would\n\f                              151\n\nensure the highest energy efficiency and reduce fuel usage,\nwhich will ultimately reduce HAP emissions.”); see also 2010\nProposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,908 (“A\nboiler tune-up provides potential savings from energy\nefficiency improvements and pollution prevention. . . . In\naddition, the cost of a boiler tune-up appears minimal\ncompared to the cost for testing and monitoring to\ndemonstrate compliance with an emission limit.”).44\n\n     The EPA elected to implement a work-practice standard\nbecause the typical method used to measure emissions of Hg\nand CO could not be used to sample emissions from stacks\nwith small diameters (less than 12 inches). See 2011 Area\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,568. Because many small\ncoal-fired boilers have stacks with diameters below 12\ninches—and because many of these boilers “do not currently\nhave sampling ports or a platform for accessing the exhaust\nstack”—the Agency concluded the cost of testing and\nmonitoring these small boilers would “present an excessive\nburden for smaller sources.” Id. The Agency’s consideration\nof cost effectiveness is particularly appropriate in this context\nbecause the “vast majority” of area source boilers are\n“generally owned and operated by small entities,” which\nwould be disproportionately burdened by a numeric emissions\nlimit. See Fact Sheet: Final Adjustments to the Air Toxics\nStandards for Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional\nBoilers at Area Source Facilities, 1, 2 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 684-\n\n    44\n        The EPA’s discussion of boiler tune-up advantages occurs\nmainly in the context of its decision to select a GACT standard\nrather than any numeric emission standards for certain boilers.\nEnvironmental Petitioners challenge this decision on similar\ngrounds, see supra § IV.H. But the benefits of periodic tune-ups\nalso apply to the coal-fired boilers at issue here.\n\f                               152\n\n85); see also 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg.\nat 31,906 (“The results of the analysis indicate that total\ncompliance costs exceed 3 percent (and can reach as high as\n19 percent) of the average firm revenues for 79 percent of the\nfacilities.”).\n\n      Environmental Petitioners counter that while tune-ups\nmay minimally reduce HAP emissions, they do not maximize\nthis reduction per section 7412(d)(2)’s mandate.45 But\nPetitioners view section 7412(d) too myopically; under that\nsection, the Administrator is empowered to adopt standards\nthat “tak[e] into consideration the cost of achieving such\nemission reduction.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2). The EPA here\nexamined the costs of imposing a numeric emission standard\non small coal-fired boilers and found that option “not\nfeasible” due to high costs and monitoring difficulties,\nconsiderations equally permissible under section 7412(d)(2).\nPetitioners argue that requiring the use of a fabric filter would\nhave resulted in greater reductions, but they are unable to\npoint to any small coal-fired boiler that currently uses such a\nfilter. See 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at\n31,906 (“For existing [small] area source boilers, the only\nwork practice being used that potentially controls mercury\n\n    45\n        Petitioners also point to a comment they made in the record\narguing that a tune-up standard “would not achieve emission\nreductions that are consistent with the definition of MACT,” and\nurge that the EPA never addressed these concerns. See National\nAssociation of Clean Air Agencies, Comments on EPA Proposals\nfor Regulation of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPS), EPA-HQ-\nOAR-2006-0790, EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0058, EPA-HQ-OAR-\n2003-0119 (Aug. 23, 2010), at 21-22 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 417-18).\nBut this comment was specifically addressed to gas-fired boilers,\nand it is inapposite to the EPA’s consideration of standards for\ncoal-fired boilers.\n\f                             153\n\nand POM emissions is a boiler tune-up.”). Evidence before\nthe agency in fact indicated that the best performing small\ncoal boilers for POM emission use no add-on controls. See\nMemorandum from Amanda Singleton & Brandon Long,\nEastern Research Group, to Jim Eddinger, EPA\n(MACT/GACT Mem.), App. E-2a (No. 11-1141 J.A. 540). It\nwas therefore reasonable for the EPA, when considering\ncosts, to conclude that biennial tune-ups would allow for the\nmaximum “achievable” reduction in emissions.\n\n     Petitioners’ most compelling argument involves the\nEPA’s lack of data on small coal-fired boilers. As they point\nout, the EPA’s summary of its 2008 combustion survey makes\nno mention of any small coal-fired boilers.                 See\nMACT/GACT Mem., App. D-3, tbl.1 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 523).\nAnd the EPA never directly addressed whether control\ntechnologies, such as fabric filters, were useable by small\nboilers; “[t]he only claim EPA made in the record is that tune-\nups are the most effective option that [small] coal-fired\nboilers . . . are currently using, not that tune-ups yield the\nmaximum reduction ‘achievable.’” No. 11-1141 Envtl.\nPet’rs’ Reply Br. 11. In Sierra Club II, this court agreed with\nSierra Club’s challenge to the EPA’s use of a work-practice\nstandard instead of an emission floor because the “EPA never\ndetermined that measuring emissions from ceramics kilns was\nimpracticable; it determined only that it lacked emissions data\nfrom ceramics kilns. EPA thus had no basis under section\n7412(h) for using work practice standards.” 479 F.3d at 884.\nThat context is somewhat distinguishable, given that the\nstatute there explicitly required the EPA to make a\n“feasibility” finding (as discussed above), but it could be\nargued that the EPA here lacked the data to determine\nwhether tune-ups were “consistent with” section 7412(d)(2).\n\f                              154\n\n    Ultimately, though, the high level of deference afforded\nthe EPA counsels in favor of upholding this work-practice\nstandard. Although the EPA did not explicitly state that tune-\nups were the best option to reduce emissions while still\n“considering costs,” this finding can be inferred from the\nrecord as a whole. For instance, the EPA found that “[n]one\nof the States for which we have an inventory have an\napplicable emissions limit” for small coal-fired boilers, except\nNew Jersey, which actually has tune-ups as its work-practice\nstandard. 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at\n31,909. Based on these findings, it can reasonably be inferred\nthat—given the prevalence of these small boilers—at least a\nfew would be using a control technology if that were\ntechnologically or economically feasible. Because numeric\nemissions cannot easily be measured from these smaller\nsources and the costs of outfitting them with such technology\nwould be cost prohibitive, the EPA’s choice of tune-ups as the\nwork-practice standard is sufficiently reasonable to uphold\nunder both Chevron step 2 and State Farm. The Agency’s\nchoice is consistent with section 7412(h)’s “feasibility”\nrequirement and with section 7412(d)(2)’s instruction to\nmaximize emission reductions while also considering costs.\n\n   2. Large Coal-Fired Boilers Undergoing Startup or\n                      Shutdown\n\n    The record for large coal-fired boilers undergoing startup\nor shutdown is less extensive but again the EPA’s\ndetermination is reasonable. While large coal-fired boilers\nare required to meet numeric emission standards during\n“normal” operations, the EPA adopted a work-practice\nstandard for the temporary periods of startup and shutdown.\nSee 40 C.F.R. § 63.11214 (“[M]inimize the boiler’s startup\nand shutdown periods following the manufacturer’s\n\f                             155\n\nrecommended procedures, if available. If manufacturer’s\nrecommended procedures are not available, you must follow\nrecommended procedures for a unit of similar design for\nwhich manufacturer’s recommended procedures are\navailable.”). Environmental Petitioners contend that the EPA\nnever stated this practice would reduce emissions at all, and\ntherefore it has not met its burden under section 7412(d)(2).\nBut we have already explained that no express finding of\nconsistency with section 7412(d)(2) need be made. Here, the\nrecord suggests that the work-practice standard the Agency\nchose would reduce emissions, and we therefore can\n“reasonably [] discern[]” the Agency’s path. Bowman, 419\nU.S. at 286. Specifically, the EPA explained that requiring\nboilers to operate in startup and shutdown mode for\n“sufficient time to conduct the required test runs [to impose\nnumeric standards] could result in higher emissions than\nwould otherwise occur.” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,642. Industry stakeholders also pointed out that “it\nis very common . . . for certain control devices to be out of\noperation during periods of start-up due to the nature of the\nequipment.” See American Chemistry Council, Comments\non EPA’s Proposed Rule for National Emission Standards for\nHazardous Air Pollutants for Area Sources, EPA-HQ-OAR-\n2006-0790 (Aug. 23, 2010), at 31 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 386).\nBecause the control technology is temporarily offline, “it is\nlikely that emissions will exceed the standards proposed\n[during that time period].” Id. A work-practice standard that\nrequires facilities to minimize the time their boilers spend in\nstartup or shutdown thus seems calculated to maximally\nreduce emissions during those periods—and Petitioners fail to\nprovide any viable alternative. We therefore conclude the\nEPA’s decision to adopt these work-practice standards for\nlarge coal-fired boilers during startup and shutdown was\nreasonable.\n\f                             156\n\n                     V. CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we grant the petitions in part\nand deny them in part. Specifically, we vacate the MACT\nstandards for all major boiler subcategories that would have\nbeen affected had the EPA considered all sources included in\nthe subcategories, as explained at supra § IV.B.          We\nalso remand, without vacatur, to the EPA to: (1) adequately\nexplain how CO acts as a reasonable surrogate for non-\ndioxin/furan organic HAPs; (2) set emission standards for\ncyclonic burn barrels; (3) determine whether burn-off ovens,\nsoil treatment units, and space heaters are CISWI units and, if\nso, to set standards for those types of units; (4) adequately\nexplain the exclusion of synthetic boilers from Title V’s\npermitting requirements; and (5) adequately explain the\nchoice of GACT standards over MACT standards for non-Hg\nmetals.\n\n                                                   So ordered.\n\f",

The emissions\ninclude numerous materials, some of which pose risks to the\nenvironment in general and to human health in particular.\nBecause combustion is an inevitable occurrence in the\nmachinery that helps to power modern society, the Congress\nhas authorized the EPA to provide for a regulatory framework\nthat minimizes the deleterious effects of the incineration\nindustry while simultaneously allowing it to operate.\n\n     In 2013, the EPA finalized its efforts to do so for discrete\ntypes of combustion machinery: boilers, process heaters, and\nincinerators. Two of the three rules at issue—the Major\nBoilers Rule and the Area Boilers Rule—govern boilers and\nprocess heaters. The former are enclosed devices that use a\ncontrolled flame to heat water and convert it into steam or hot\nwater. 40 C.F.R. § 63.11237. The latter are also enclosed\ndevices that use a controlled flame but, instead of generating\nsteam, they indirectly heat a “process material,” whether\nliquid, gas, or solid, or a “heat transfer material” like glycol or\na mixture of glycol and water. Id. For simplicity, our use of\n“boilers” covers both machinery types.\n\n    The two boiler-specific rules further divide the machinery\ninto three categories:        industrial, commercial, and\n\f                               3\n\ninstitutional. See 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,557. Industrial boilers are used for manufacturing,\nprocessing, mining, refining, and other similar operations.\nSee id. Commercial boilers are used by shopping malls,\nlaundromats, apartment complexes, restaurants, and hotels.\nSee id. And institutional boilers include those used by, e.g.,\nmedical centers, schools, churches, prisons, and courthouses.\nSee id. Collectively, over 200,000 boilers at over 100,000\nseparate facilities must comply with the standards set out in\nthe Major Boilers Rule or the Area Boilers Rule.\n\n     The third rule that we address—the CISWI Rule—\ngoverns combustion machinery known as “solid waste\nincineration unit[s].” 42 U.S.C. § 7429. The Act defines an\nincinerator as a “distinct operating unit of any facility” that\nburns solid waste from either commercial establishments,\nindustrial establishments, or the general public.            Id.\n§ 7429(g)(1). An incinerator subjects “waste material” to\n“high temperatures until it is reduced to ash.” Incinerator,\nNEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY 853 (2d ed. 2005).\nIncinerators fall into different subcategories and, in the past,\nthe EPA has issued rules governing many of them, including,\ne.g., municipal solid-waste incinerators, medical-waste\nincinerators, and sewage-sludge incinerators.4 At issue in the\nCISWI Rule are incinerators located in commercial or\nindustrial facilities that combust solid waste as defined in the\nResource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 6901 et seq. See 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,706.\n\n\n\n    4\n      See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. pt. 60, subpts. Cd, Ce, Eb, AAAA,\nBBBB, EEEE, FFFF, LLLL, MMMM.\n\f                              4\n\n    A. THE CLEAN AIR ACT, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7401 ET SEQ.\n\n     Enacted “to protect and enhance the quality of the\nNation’s air resources so as to promote the public health and\nwelfare and the productive capacity of its population,” 42\nU.S.C. § 7401(b)(1), the Act has been amended several times\nsince the Congress first attempted to control air pollution via\nlegislation in 1963. In 1970, the Congress required the EPA\nto identify and publish a list of HAPs, which the CAA defined\nas substances that increase “mortality,” “serious irreversible”\nillness, or “incapacitating reversible” illness. Clean Air\nAmendments of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-604, § 4(a), 84 Stat.\n1676, 1685 (1970). The EPA had to set emission limits for\nevery HAP based on the risk it posed to human health.

See Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 979.\n\n    1. 42 U.S.C. § 7412—“Hazardous Air Pollutants”\n\n     The 1990 CAA Amendments overhauled the Act’s\n“Hazardous Air Pollutants” provision, codified at 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412. Although earlier iterations of the Act had assigned\nHAPs-identification responsibility to the EPA, the slow pace\nat which the EPA discharged its duty prompted the Congress\nto create a list of pollutants itself.5 See Sierra Club I, 353\nF.3d at 979-80 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 7412(b)). After identifying\nnearly two hundred HAPs that warranted emissions\nrestrictions, see 42 U.S.C. § 7412(b)(1), the Congress directed\nthe EPA, first, to identify the sources of each HAP, see id.\n§ 7412(c). The Agency then was to set emissions limits for\neach source that result in HAPs reduction to the greatest\nextent achievable by current technology. See generally Nat’l\nAss’n for Surface Finishing v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (D.C. Cir.\n2015) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 7412(b)(1), (c), (d)).\n\n        a. Identifying and Categorizing HAP Sources\n\n     The EPA’s first task is to create HAP-source categories\nand subcategories. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(c). The Act\ndistinguishes “major” from “area” sources, defining the\nformer as “any stationary source or group of stationary\nsources” that neighbor each other, share common control, and\nemit (or have the potential to emit) either ten tons per year or\nmore of any single HAP or twenty-five tons per year or more\n\n\n    5\n       The EPA must keep the HAPs list current. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(b)(2), (3).\n\f                                 6\n\nof any HAP combination.6 Id. § 7412(a)(1). The latter are\nsources that do not emit enough HAPs to qualify as “major.”\nId. § 7412(a)(2). Although the EPA must set stringent\nrestrictions on major sources, it has discretion to set more\nlenient emissions caps on area sources. See id. § 7412(d)(5).\n\n     Apart from the statutory distinction between major and\narea sources, the EPA has discretion to differentiate “among\nclasses, types, and sizes of sources within a category or\nsubcategory.” Id. § 7412(d)(1). Once the EPA finalizes\nHAPs-source categories and subcategories, the CAA\nmandates that it draw one final dividing line—between “new”\nsources and “existing” sources. See id. § 7412(d)(3). “New”\nsources are those “on which construction begins after EPA\npublishes emission standards,” Cement Kiln Recycling Coal.\nv. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185467\"><a href=\"/opinion/185467/cement-kiln-recycl-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 858 (D.C. Cir. 2001); most of the\nothers are “existing” sources, see 42 U.S.C. § 7412(a)(10).\nBut if an existing source experiences either a physical change\nor a change in operation method and the change increases\nHAP emissions by more than a de minimis amount, the Act\nmandates that the source meet the standards set for new\nsources. See id. § 7412(a)(5), (g).\n\n    b. Setting Emission Standards for Major Sources—the\n                     “MACT” Standard\n\n    After the EPA identifies HAP-source categories and\nsubcategories, it then sets emissions limits for each. See id.\n§ 7412(d)(2). “[W]henever . . . feasible,” the caps must use\nnumeric HAPs limits. Id. § 7412(h)(4). The size of the\n\n    6\n         The CAA defines “stationary source” as “any building,\nstructure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air\npollutant.” 42 U.S.C. § 7411(a)(3).\n\f                               7\n\nsource—either “major” or “area”—dictates whether the EPA\nmust set the numeric limit at the most stringent level that\ncurrent technology allows or at the level set by “generally\navailable control technologies.” Id. § 7412(d)(5). For major\nsources, the CAA directs the EPA to establish emissions caps\nthat result in the “the maximum degree of reduction in\nemissions” that the EPA determines is “achievable.” Id.\n§ 7412(d)(2). We refer to an emissions cap that reflects the\ncurrent “maximum achievable control technology” as a\n“MACT” standard. See NRDC II, 529 F.3d at 1079. Setting a\nMACT standard is a two-step process.\n\n     First, the EPA establishes a “MACT floor” for each\ncategory or subcategory. Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 980. The\nMACT floor ensures that all HAPs sources “at least clean up\ntheir emissions to the level that their best performing peers\nhave shown can be achieved.” Id. For new sources—those\nbuilt after promulgation of a HAPs limit, see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(a)(4)—the MACT floor cannot be less stringent than\nthe emissions levels achieved by the best performing similar\nsource. Id. § 7412(d)(3). For existing sources in categories or\nsubcategories that have thirty or more sources, the MACT\nfloor cannot be less stringent than the average emissions\nlimits achieved by the best performing 12 per cent of existing\nsources in that category or subcategory. Id. § 7412(d)(3)(A).\nAnd for existing sources in categories or subcategories with\nfewer than thirty sources, the MACT floor cannot be less\nstringent than the average emissions achieved by the best\nperforming five sources. Id. § 7412(d)(3)(B). When setting\nthe MACT floor, the EPA considers only the performance of\nthe cleanest sources in a category or subcategory; it does not\ntake into account other factors, including the cost of putting a\nsource in line with its better-performing counterparts. See\nCement Kiln, 255 F.3d at 857-58 (citing Nat’l Lime Ass’n v.\n\f                               8\n\nEPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185308\"><a href=\"/opinion/185308/natl-lime-assn-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 629 (D.C. Cir. 2000), as amended on\ndenial of reh’g, No. 99-1325 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 14, 2001)).\n\n     Second, the EPA must determine whether current\ntechnology makes it possible for a source to perform even\nbetter than the best performing similar source or sources. In\nother words, the CAA directs the EPA to consider whether it\nshould set a “beyond-the-floor” MACT standard. Nat’l Lime\nAss’n, 233 F.3d at 629. In determining whether a beyond-the-\nfloor standard is “achievable,” the Agency must consider\nadditional factors like “the cost of achieving such emission\nreduction,” “any non-air quality health and environmental\nimpacts” and “energy requirements.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2).\nIt has broad discretion in its determination. See id.; cf. Nat’l\nAss’n of Clean Water Agencies v. EPA (NACWA), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">734</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1115</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1157 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (noting, in section 7429 case,\nthat “Congress gave EPA broad discretion in considering\nwhether to go beyond-the-floor”).\n\n    c. Setting Emission Standards for Area Sources—the\n                     “GACT” Standard\n\n     Although the EPA must cap HAP emissions from major\nsources at the “maximum degree of reduction,” see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(d)(2), it has discretion to set less stringent caps on\nemissions from area sources. Indeed, the EPA need not list\ncategories of area sources at all unless: (A) it finds that the\nsources in that category or subcategory “present[] a threat of\nadverse effects” to the environment or human health, see id.\n§ 7412(c)(1), (3); or (B) control of a particular area source\ncategory or subcategory is necessary to ensure that sources\naccounting for at least 90 per cent of the aggregate emissions\nof the thirty HAPs the EPA believes “present the greatest\nthreat to public health in the largest number of urban areas”\n\f                              9\n\nare subject to CAA control, id. § 7412(c)(3), (k)(3)(B). If it\nfinds that controlling emissions from a particular area source\nsubcategory is necessary to achieve a 90 per cent reduction in\nthe aggregate emissions of any of seven CAA-enumerated\nHAPs, section 7412(c)(6) requires the Agency to impose\nMACT caps on that subcategory. See id. § 7412(c)(6).\n\n     With the exception of section 7412(c)(6)’s MACT-\nstandard requirement, the EPA need not cap emissions from\narea sources at the MACT level. Instead, it may set more\nlenient emissions limits based on “generally available control\ntechnologies.” Id. § 7412(d)(5). We refer to these caps as\nGACT standards. The Act provides no guidance for setting\nGACT standards but the legislative history of the 1990 CAA\nAmendments describes GACT “as methods, practices and\ntechniques [that] are commercially available and appropriate\nfor application by the sources in the category considering\neconomic impacts and the technical capabilities of the firms\nto operate and maintain the emissions control systems.” S.\nREP. NO. 101-228, at 171 (1989). According to the EPA, it\ncan and will consider the following in setting a GACT\nstandard:\n\n        “costs and economic impacts . . . , which\n         [are] particularly important when developing\n         regulations for source categories that may\n         have many small businesses . . . ”;\n\n         “the control technologies and management\n         practices that are generally available to the\n         area sources in the source category”;\n\n        “the standards applicable to major sources in\n         the analogous source category to determine if\n\f                              10\n\n         the control technologies and management\n         practices are transferable and generally\n         available to area sources”; and\n\n        “technologies and practices at area and major\n         sources in similar categories to determine\n         whether such technologies and practices\n         could be considered generally available for\n         the area source categories at issue.”\n\n2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,556. And, unlike\nthe EPA’s duty to consider a beyond-the-floor MACT\nstandard, it need not consider a more stringent GACT\nstandard.\n\n   d. Work-Practice and Management-Practice Standards\n\n     Although the CAA requires numeric emission standards\nwhere possible, the EPA can “promulgate a design,\nequipment, work practice, or operational standard, or\ncombination thereof” if it determines that a numeric limit is\n“not feasible.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(h)(1). In other words, the\nEPA can require that all sources in a given category or\nsubcategory take a certain action (e.g., conduct a periodic\ntune-up) or install certain emissions-control technology (e.g.,\ninstall a fabric filter). Although the EPA has discretion to\nimpose a work-practice standard, the Act limits it by defining\nthe operative phrase “not feasible” narrowly to mean:\n\n   (A) a hazardous air pollutant or pollutants cannot\n       be emitted through a conveyance designed\n       and constructed to emit or capture such\n       pollutant, or that any requirement for, or use\n       of, such a conveyance would be inconsistent\n       with any Federal, State or local law, or\n\f                              11\n\n   (B) the application of measurement methodology\n       to a particular class of sources is not\n       practicable due to technological and\n       economic limitations.\n\nId. § 7412(h)(2).\n\n     Similarly, for area sources, the EPA can impose a\n“management-practice standard” in lieu of a numeric GACT\nstandard. See id. § 7412(d)(5). A management-practice\nGACT standard is like a work-practice MACT standard in all\nways but one—the EPA need not consider feasibility when\nsetting management-practice standards.       Compare id.\n§ 7412(d)(2), with id. § 7412(d)(5).\n\n     2. 42 U.S.C. § 7429—“Solid Waste Combustion”\n\n     In addition to amending the Act’s “Hazardous Air\nPollutants” provision, see id. § 7412, the 1990 CAA\nAmendments added to the U.S. Code section 7429, titled\n“Solid Waste Combustion.” Section 7429 regulates “solid\nwaste incineration units” generally, see id. § 7429(a)(1)(A),\nand CISWI specifically, see id. § 7429(a)(1)(D). Although\nsection 7412 requires the EPA to control emissions of nearly\ntwo hundred HAPs, see id. § 7412(d)(1), section 7429\nmandates that the EPA control emissions from only nine\nspecific pollutants (as well as opacity, where appropriate),\nnone of which the Congress included on its initial section\n7412 list, see id. § 7429(a)(4); see also Nat. Res. Def. Council\nv. EPA (NRDC I), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"798072\"><a href=\"/opinion/798072/natural-resources-defense-council-sierra-club-environmental-integrity/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1256 (D.C. Cir. 2007). We\nhave       held       that     this      difference      “makes\npromulgating . . . standards under [section 7412] and [section\n7429] mutually exclusive.” NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1119. In\nother words, if a source (or facility) is considered a CISWI\n\f                             12\n\nand, therefore, regulated under section 7429, it cannot be\nregulated under section 7412. See id.\n\n     Whether a source falls under section 7412 or section\n7429, “the statutory directive on setting MACT standards is\nvirtually identical.” Id.; see also Nat’l Lime Ass’n, 233 F.3d\nat 631. That said, regulation under one section instead of the\nother “has practical consequences.” NACWA, 734 F.3d at\n1120. For example, section 7412 allows the EPA to impose a\nGACT standard for area sources only but section 7429\nrequires the EPA to impose MACT standards for all covered\nunits, regardless of their size.         Compare 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(d)(1), (5), with id. § 7429(a)(1)(A); see also NRDC I,\n489 F.3d at 1256. Moreover, section 7412 mandates that the\nEPA control HAP emissions from “major source[s],” which\nthe Act defines broadly to include “group[s] of stationary\nsources located within a contiguous area and under common\ncontrol.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(a)(1) (emphasis added). Section\n7429, in contrast, mandates that the EPA control emissions\nfrom “solid waste incineration unit[s],” which the Act defines\nmore narrowly as “a distinct operating unit of any facility\nwhich combusts any solid waste material,” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7429(g)(1) (emphases added). And finally, section 7429\ndoes not provide for work-practice standards.\n\n      3. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7661 et seq.—“Title V Permits”\n\n     Finally, the 1990 CAA Amendments added a provision to\nTitle V of the Act that requires all owners and operators of\nHAP sources to obtain operating permits. See id. § 7661a.\nTitle V does no more than consolidate “existing air pollution\nrequirements into a single document, the Title V permit, to\nfacilitate compliance monitoring” without imposing any new\nsubstantive requirements. Sierra Club v.

REP.\nNO. 101-228, at 347. Although owners and operators of all\nmajor HAP sources must obtain Title V permits, see generally\n42 U.S.C. § 7661a(a), the EPA has discretion to exempt\ncertain area source categories if it “finds that compliance with\nsuch requirements is impracticable, infeasible, or\nunnecessarily burdensome,” id.\n\n         B. THE MAJOR BOILERS, AREA BOILERS,\n                  AND CISWI RULES\n\n     On March 21, 2011, the EPA issued the first iteration of\nall three rules under review. That same day, however, the\nEPA announced that it intended to reconsider certain aspects\nof each rule. Not long after, multiple parties filed the\npetitions for review that we now address. Earlier, the EPA\nhad concluded its reconsideration and issued the most recent\niteration of the three rules. Because of this procedural quirk,\neach “rule” we address is in fact two separate rules—the\nEPA’s “final” 2011 version and its “final” 2013 version. The\nEPA’s analyses remained mostly consistent from 2011 to\n2013 and we indicate, where necessary, the instances in which\nthe EPA changed course in a significant way.\n\n                 1. The Major Boilers Rule\n\n     The Major Boilers Rule sets HAPs emission caps for all\nindustrial, commercial, and institutional boilers that emit a\nlarge volume of HAPs. See 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,611. The EPA further divided the major boiler\ncategories into subcategories based on the primary fuel\n\f                              14\n\ncombusted by the boilers in the subcategory (e.g., coal,\nbiomass, gas, etc.) and, for some subcategories, based on the\nmethod used to “feed” the fuel into the boiler. See 2013\nMajor Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,144. For most of the\nsubcategories, the EPA set a numeric MACT standard for four\ndifferent HAPs: particulate matter (PM); hydrogen chloride\n(HCl); mercury (Hg); and carbon monoxide (CO). See id. at\n7,142 tbl.3; No. 11-1108 EPA Br. 9. The EPA used some of\nthese HAPs—particularly CO—as a surrogate (or proxy) to\nset emissions limits for others on the section 7412(b) HAPs\nlist. See 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,144-45.\nFor the other major boiler subcategories, the EPA set a work-\npractice standard (specifically, a tune-up requirement) in lieu\nof numeric MACT standards. See 2011 Major Boilers Rule,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613.7 The EPA also established a tune-up\nwork-practice standard to control for dioxin/furan emissions\nacross all major boiler subcategories. 2013 Major Boilers\nRule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,138.\n\n     In addition to these emission standards, the Major Boilers\nRule includes several other provisions relevant to the current\npetitions for review.\n\n              a. The “Upper Prediction Limit”\n\n     Several factors complicate the process of setting MACT\nfloors. The first is the CAA itself, which mandates that all\nMACT floors (1) must be achievable, see 42 U.S.C.\n    7\n         The four major boiler subcategories for which the EPA\nestablished work-practice standards include “[n]ew and existing\nunits that have a designed heat input capacity of less than 10\nMMBtu/hr, and new and existing units in the Gas 1 (natural\ngas/refinery gas) subcategory and in the metal process furnaces\nsubcategory.” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613.\n\f                               15\n\n§ 7412(d)(2); (2) must ensure continuous regulation of the\ncovered sources, see id. § 7602(k); and (3) must be no less\nstringent than the emissions levels being achieved by the best-\ncontrolled sources, see id. § 7412(d)(3). The second is that no\nsource emits any HAP at a constant level; rather, HAP\nemissions fluctuate over time and for many reasons,\nincluding, e.g., “operation of control technologies, variation in\ncombustion materials and combustion conditions, variation in\noperation of the unit itself, and variation associated with the\nemission measurement techniques.” Memorandum from\nStephen D. Page, EPA Director of Air Quality Planning and\nStandards, EPA’s Response to Remand of the Record for\nCommercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units\n(Page Mem.) (July 14, 2014), at 3 (No. 11-1125 J.A. 1316).\nFinally, most sources do not measure their HAP emissions at\nall times and under all conditions.8 Id. at 6. Instead, data are\nusually gathered when a source conducts a “three-run stack\ntest.” Id. This test provides three “snapshots” of a source’s\nemissions in a limited set of conditions and, accordingly, it\nfails to demonstrate accurately a source’s emissions during all\ntimes and under all conditions. Id.\n\n     To compensate for the lack of adequate emissions data,\nthe EPA uses a statistical tool known as the “upper prediction\nlimit” (UPL) to account for the expected variability in\nemissions levels. See 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 15,630. The UPL, in turn, allows the Agency to set a\nMACT floor that is continuously achievable. Id. We discuss\nthe UPL mechanics at greater length below, see infra § IV.C,\nbut, in short, the EPA: (1) ranks all sources in a given\n\n    8\n      As discussed below, however, the EPA does allow sources\nto demonstrate MACT compliance by use of “continuous\nmonitors.” See infra § IV.I.\n\f                              16\n\ncategory based on their three-run stack-test data;\n(2) determines the HAP emissions level of the “best\ncontrolled similar source” to establish standards for new\nsources, 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(3), and determines the average\nHAP emissions levels of the best performing 12 per cent of\nsources to establish standards for existing sources, id.\n§ 7412(d)(3)(A); and then (3) applies the UPL methodology\nto provide the cushion necessary to account for the expected\npeaks and valleys in HAP emissions not reflected in the three-\nrun stack-test “snapshots.” See Page Mem. 4, 6.\n\n         b. The “Pollutant-By-Pollutant” Approach\n\n     In identifying the best performing sources in a given\ncategory, often the EPA could not identify a single source that\ncontrolled all HAPs better than all other sources. Instead, the\nEPA found that one source effectively controlled emissions\nfrom one HAP but was nonetheless one of the worst-\nperforming sources at controlling emissions from a different\nHAP. For this reason, the EPA adopted a “pollutant-by-\npollutant” approach in setting MACT floors for major boiler\nsubcategories. See 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,622-23. That is, instead of identifying the one source that,\non balance, best controlled all HAPs in the aggregate, the\nEPA used one source to set the MACT floor for, e.g., PM, and\nused a different source to set the MACT floor for, e.g., HCl.\nFor at least two subcategories of major boilers—new heavy\noil-fired units and existing stoker coal-fired units—the EPA’s\npollutant-by-pollutant approach resulted in MACT floors that\nno source had achieved in toto.\n\n          c. Startups, Shutdowns, and Malfunctions\n\n   The EPA found it difficult to account for HAP emissions\nwhen sources start up, shut down, and malfunction. All three\n\f                              17\n\noccurrences alter HAP emissions and, historically, the EPA\nexempted sources from normal numeric MACT-standard\ncompliance when these events occurred. See, e.g., Standards\nof Performance for New Stationary Sources, 42 Fed. Reg.\n57,125 (Nov. 1, 1977). Nevertheless, concluding that the Act\n“require[s] that there must be continuous section [7412]-\ncompliant standards” and observing that the exemption meant\nthat “no section [7412] standard governs these events,” in\n2008 we vacated the exemption for startups, shutdowns, and\nmalfunctions when the issue arose in a case challenging a\ndifferent rule. Sierra Club v. EPA (Sierra Club III), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187271\"><a href=\"/opinion/187271/sierra-club-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1027-28 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (emphasis added).\n\n     In response to the Sierra Club III vacatur, the EPA\nestablished a work-practice standard in lieu of a numeric\nMACT standard during startup and shutdown periods (but not\nduring malfunctions) when it promulgated the Major Boilers\nRule. See 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613.9\nIt did so after determining that the “physical limitations and\nthe short duration of startup and shutdown periods” made it\ntechnologically infeasible to conduct the requisite testing for\nnumeric emissions limits. Id. A work-practice standard\nsufficed, in the EPA’s view, because “[p]eriods of startup,\nnormal operations, and shutdown are all predictable and\nroutine aspects of a source’s operations.” Id.\n    9\n        Specifically, the startup and shutdown work-practice\nstandard requires a source to follow “the manufacturer’s\nrecommended procedures for minimizing periods of startup and\nshutdown.” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613. “If\nmanufacturer’s recommended procedures are not available,” the\nMajor Boilers Rule provided that “sources must follow\nrecommended procedures for a unit of similar design for which\nmanufacturer’s recommended procedures are available.” Id. at\n15,642.\n\f                              18\n\n     But because a malfunction is “sudden, infrequent, and not\nreasonably preventable,” id. (quoting 40 C.F.R. § 63.2), the\nEPA declined to treat a malfunction as a “distinct operating\nmode,” id. As a result, the EPA did not account for\nmalfunctions when it set the MACT floors and it required\nsources to comply with all MACT floors even during periods\nof malfunction. Id. At the same time and recognizing that\neven the best equipment can fail and that such failure can\nspike emissions, the EPA added to the Major Boilers Rule “an\naffirmative defense to civil penalties for exceedances of\nnumerical emission limits that are caused by malfunctions.”\nId. In reviewing a challenge to a different EPA rule, however,\nwe vacated a materially identical affirmative-defense\nprovision and held that the EPA has no power under the CAA\nto create a defense to civil liability. See Natural Res. Def.\nCouncil v. EPA (NRDC III), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1055</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1062-64 (D.C.\nCir. 2014). Here, the EPA defends its decision not to address\nmalfunctions by asserting that it will use its enforcement\ndiscretion regarding malfunctions on a case-by-case basis.\n\n            d. The One-Time Energy Assessment\n\n     The EPA also promulgated a “beyond-the-floor”\nrequirement for all facilities with existing major boilers. See\n2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613.\nSpecifically, the Major Boilers Rule mandates a “a one-time\nenergy assessment . . . on the affected boilers and facility to\nidentify any cost-effective energy conservation measures,”\nid., which assessment includes, inter alia, a review of fuel\nusage, energy management practices, and conservation\nmeasures, see 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at\n7,198-99. In some respects, the energy assessment is limited:\nit (1) need occur only one time, see 40 C.F.R pt. 63, subpt.\nDDDDD tbl.3; (2) is “based on energy use by discrete\n\f                               19\n\nsegments of a facility and not by a total aggregation of all\nindividual energy using elements of a facility,” 2013 Major\nBoilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,146; and (3) does not require\nan owner or operator to implement any of the energy-saving\nfindings the assessment makes. In one respect, however, it is\nexpansive—it requires owners and operators to assess not\nonly the boilers themselves but also other components\n“located on the site of the affected boiler that use energy\nprovided by the boiler,” including “compressed air systems”\nas well as “facility heating, ventilation, and air conditioning\nsystems.” 40 C.F.R. § 63.11237.\n\n       e. The Health-Based Emissions Limits for HCl\n\n     Although the EPA set numeric MACT standards to\ncontrol HCl emissions, see 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 7,193-98 tbls.1 & 2, in an earlier iteration of the Major\nBoilers Rule, the EPA did not set MACT standards for HCl.\nSee National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air\nPollutants for Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional\nBoilers and Process Heaters (2004 Boilers Rule), 69 Fed. Reg.\n55,218, 55,227 (Sept. 13, 2004). Instead, the Agency opted\nfor a less stringent health-based emissions limit under section\n7412(d)(4).      See id.    The EPA changed course after\nconcluding that HCl emissions posed health concerns the\nAgency had not previously considered—in particular, the\nEPA feared the “potential cumulative public health and\nenvironmental effects” of HCl emissions, 2011 Major Boilers\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,643-44 (emphasis added)—and after\nrecognizing that it did not have the requisite data to weigh\nadequately the newly identified health risks.\n\f                               20\n\n                  2. The Area Boilers Rule\n\n     In the Area Boilers Rule, the EPA set emissions limits for\nthe same three boiler categories it controlled in the Major\nBoilers Rule, see supra § I.B.1: industrial, commercial, and\ninstitutional boilers. See 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg.\nat 7,488.      It further split the categories into seven\nsubcategories, see id., and set emissions limits for three of\nthem, see id. at 7,517-18 tbls.1 & 2.10 These include:\n(1) coal-fired boilers (i.e., “any boiler that burns any solid\nfossil fuel and no more than 15 percent biomass,” 40 C.F.R.\n§ 63.11237); (2) oil-fired boilers (i.e., “any boiler that burns\nany liquid fuel and is not in either the biomass or coal\nsubcategories,” id.); and (3) biomass-fired boilers (i.e., “any\nboiler that burns any” “biomass-based solid fuel that is not a\nsolid waste” and “is not in the coal subcategory,” id.). See\n2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,517-18 tbls.1 & 2.\n\n     For these subcategories, the EPA set emissions limits for\nthree HAPs: Hg, PM, and CO, with PM functioning as a\nsurrogate for non-Hg urban metals and CO functioning as a\nsurrogate for polycyclic organic matter (POM). See 2011\nArea Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,586. Because Hg and\nPOM are both listed in section 7412(c)(6), the EPA had to set\nMACT standards for Hg and for CO (as surrogate for POM)\nfor any area source category that, in the EPA’s view, required\n    10\n         As noted above, see supra § I.A.1.a, the EPA has some\ndiscretion in promulgating emissions limits for area HAP sources.\nExercising its discretion, the EPA had previously determined that\nnatural gas-fired area boilers did not emit HAPs at a level\nnecessitating regulation. See National Emission Standards for\nHazardous Air Pollutants for Area Sources: Industrial, Commercial,\nand Institutional Boilers (2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule), 75\nFed. Reg. 31,896, 31,900 (June 4, 2010).\n\f                                21\n\nMACT control to assure a 90 per cent reduction in the\naggregate emissions of these two HAPs. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(c)(6). The Agency complied, setting numeric MACT\nstandards for Hg and CO emissions from large coal-fired\nboilers and a MACT work-practice standard (specifically, a\ntune-up requirement) for emissions from small coal-fired\nboilers. See 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,488,\n7,517-18.11 It did not, however, set MACT standards for Hg\nand POM emissions from biomass or oil-fired boilers, finding\nit unnecessary to assure a 90 per cent reduction in aggregate\nemissions of those two HAPs. See 2011 Area Boilers Rule,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 15,566.\n\n     Thus, with the exception of Hg and CO emissions from\ncoal-fired boilers, the EPA had discretion to promulgate\nGACT standards for all other HAPs in all other source\nsubcategories. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(5). Exercising this\ndiscretion resulted in the following standards:\n\n\n\n\n    11\n        As used in the Area Boilers Rule, the difference between\n“large” and “small” units depends on the heat-input capacity of the\nunit. See 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,488. It is not\nthe same as the difference between “major” and “area” sources,\nwhich is based on the volume of HAPs a source emits. See 42\nU.S.C. § 7412(a).\n\f                       22\n\n\n\n\n  Boiler                           Hg       Hg\n              Size      Age\nSubcategory                       Limit    Type\n                       New       Numeric   MACT\n              Large\n                      Existing   Numeric   MACT\n                       New        Tune-    MACT\n   Coal\n                                   Up\n              Small\n                      Existing    Tune-    MACT\n                                   Up\n                     New           ---      ---\n              Large\n                    Existing       ---      ---\n Biomass\n                     New           ---      ---\n              Small\n                    Existing       ---      ---\n                     New           ---      ---\n              Large\n                    Existing       ---      ---\n    Oil\n                     New           ---      ---\n              Small\n                    Existing       ---      ---\n\n  Boiler                           CO       CO\n              Size      Age\nSubcategory                       Limit    Type\n                       New       Numeric   MACT\n              Large\n                      Existing   Numeric   MACT\n   Coal\n                       New       Tune-up   MACT\n              Small\n                      Existing   Tune-up   MACT\n                       New       Tune-up   GACT\n              Large\n                      Existing   Tune-up   GACT\n Biomass\n                       New       Tune-up   GACT\n              Small\n                      Existing   Tune-up   GACT\n                       New       Tune-up   GACT\n              Large\n                      Existing   Tune-up   GACT\n    Oil\n                       New       Tune-up   GACT\n              Small\n                      Existing   Tune-up   GACT\n\f                              23\n\n\n\n\n       Boiler                            PM        PM\n                     Size     Age\n     Subcategory                        Limit     Type\n                             New       Numeric    GACT\n                    Large\n                            Existing   Tune-up    GACT\n         Coal\n                             New       Tune-up    GACT\n                    Small\n                            Existing   Tune-up    GACT\n                             New       Numeric    GACT\n                    Large\n                            Existing   Tune-up    GACT\n       Biomass\n                             New       Tune-up    GACT\n                    Small\n                            Existing   Tune-up    GACT\n                             New       Numeric    GACT\n                    Large\n                            Existing   Tune-up    GACT\n          Oil\n                             New       Tune-up    GACT\n                    Small\n                            Existing   Tune-up    GACT\n\n2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,488-89, 7,517-19.\n\n     The Area Boilers Rule shares many of the same features\nas the Major Boilers Rule; for example, the Area Boilers Rule\ntreats startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions in the same\nfashion as the Major Boilers Rule, see supra § I.B.1.c—i.e.,\nthe Area Boilers Rule creates work-practice (or management-\npractice) standards for startup and shutdown periods but does\nnot account for malfunctions at all, save for the Agency’s\ncommitment to consider malfunctions on a case-by-case basis.\nSee 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,496; 2011 Area\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,560-61. Additionally, the\nArea Boilers Rule imposes the same one-time energy-\nassessment requirement for existing large area boilers that the\nMajor Boilers Rule imposes for existing major boilers. See\nsupra § I.B.1.d; see also 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 7,500; 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n\f                              24\n\n15,560, 15,567-68. There are, however, two unique features\nof the Area Boilers Rule that warrant brief discussion.\n\n            a. Exclusion of “Temporary Boilers”\n\n     After the EPA promulgated the 2011 Area Boilers Rule\nbut before it promulgated the 2013 version, it proposed an\namendment to 40 C.F.R. § 63.11195 that added temporary\nboilers to the list of those boilers not regulated by\nsection 7412.     See National Emission Standards for\nHazardous Air Pollutants for Area Sources: Industrial,\nCommercial, and Institutional Boilers (2011 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule on Reconsideration), 76 Fed. Reg. 80,532,\n80,535 (Dec. 23, 2011). The EPA created the exclusion\nbecause, in its view, temporary boilers are “insignificant\nsources[] and were not included in the EPA’s analysis of the\nsource category.” Id. The Agency eventually defined\n“temporary boiler” as “any gaseous or liquid fuel boiler that is\ndesigned to, and is capable of, being carried or moved from\none location to another by means of, for example, wheels,\nskids, carrying handles, dollies, trailers, or platforms.” See\n2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,491 (quoting 40\nC.F.R. § 63.11237).\n\n  b. Title V Permit Exemption for Synthetic Area Sources\n\n     As noted, see supra § I.A.3, Title V of the CAA imposes\na permit requirement on all owners and operators of major\nand area HAP sources. See 42 U.S.C. § 7661a. The EPA,\nhowever, can exempt an area source subcategory if it finds\n“that compliance with such requirements is impracticable,\ninfeasible, or unnecessarily burdensome on such categories.”\nId. § 7661a(a). When it proposed the Area Boilers Rule in\n2010, the EPA considered exempting some area sources\nbecause, in its view, the existing restrictions on those sources\n\f                               25\n\nmade Title V duplicative. See 2010 Proposed Area Boilers\nRule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,910-13. At the time, the EPA\nannounced that it did not intend to exempt “synthetic” area\nsources (i.e., area sources that, but for existing air-pollution\ncontrols, would be considered major sources). Id. at 31,913.\nIn so doing, the EPA reasoned that synthetic area sources:\n(1) more closely resemble major sources than area sources,\n(2) are often located in populous areas, and (3) have high\nHAP emissions potential when uncontrolled. Id.\n\n     But in the 2011 Area Boilers Rule, the EPA changed\ncourse and exempted synthetic area sources from the Title V\npermitting requirement. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,578. It\nreasoned that the “observations and data . . . relied upon in\nother rulemakings for distinguishing between sources that\nbecame synthetic area sources due to controls and other\nsynthetic and natural area sources did not necessarily apply to\nthis source category.” Id. In its view, it no longer had\n“sufficient information” to distinguish synthetic area sources\nfrom the others it exempted and, accordingly, “the rationale\nfor exempting most area sources subject to this rule . . . is also\nnow relevant for” synthetic area sources. Id.; see also 2013\nArea Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,497.\n\n                     3. The CISWI Rule\n\n      In the CISWI Rule, the EPA created four CISWI\nsubcategories: (1) incinerators (i.e., “units designed to burn\n[solid] waste materials for the purpose of disposal”);\n(2) small, remote incinerators (“SRIs”) (i.e., units that burn\nsmall waste batches); (3) energy recovery units (“ERUs”)\n(i.e., units that would be classified as boilers but for the fact\nthey combust solid waste); and (4) waste-burning kilns (i.e.,\nunits that would be classified as cement kilns if they did not\n\f                               26\n\nburn solid waste). 2013 CISWI Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 9,118.\nInitially, the EPA proposed a fifth subcategory—burn-off\novens—but eliminated burn-off ovens after comments\nrevealed that it had greatly underestimated the number of\nunits in that subcategory (36 versus 15,000) and that it lacked\nthe requisite data to set limits for the units. See 2011 CISWI\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,734.             Of the four CISWI\nsubcategories, the EPA further divided the ERU subcategory\n(for CO emissions only) into coal-fired, biomass-fired and\noil/gas-fired ERUs and it further divided the waste-burning\nkiln subcategory (again, for CO emissions only) into long and\npreheater/precalcinator kilns. See 2013 CISWI Rule, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 9,118 tbl.2.\n\n     The EPA then set numeric MACT limits for the section\n7429(a)(4) pollutants.12 See 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 15,709-10 tbl.1. Unlike the Major Boilers Rule and the\nArea Boilers Rule, the CISWI Rule contains no beyond-the-\nfloor MACT standards. The EPA also declined to promulgate\nwork-practice standards, concluding that it had no authority to\ndo so because section 7429 includes no work-practice\nstandard provision similar to that in section 7412. See id. at\n15,721.\n\n     The CISWI Rule shares several features with the Major\nBoilers Rule. In the CISWI Rule, for instance, the EPA also\nused the UPL, see id. at 15,722-27, as well as the pollutant-\nby-pollutant approach, see id. at 15,719-21, in setting MACT\nfloors. Based in part on the differences between section 7412\n\n    12\n         These pollutants are (1) PM, (2) sulfur dioxide (SO2),\n(3) HCl, (4) nitrogen oxide (NOx), (5) CO, (6) lead (Pb),\n(7) cadmium (Cd), (8) Hg, (9) dioxins and dibenzofurans, and (10)\nopacity (where appropriate). 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(4).\n\f                             27\n\nand section 7429, the CISWI rule has four unique\ncharacteristics we briefly describe.\n\n         a. Startups, Shutdowns, and Malfunctions\n\n     As discussed, see supra § II.B.1.c, the EPA imposed a\nwork-practice standard for major and area source boilers\nduring periods of startup and shutdown but declined to make\nany regulatory modification for malfunctions. See 2011\nMajor Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613; 2011 Area\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,560-61. The CISWI Rule,\nhowever, makes no modification for any of these periods,\nmandating instead that the numeric MACT standards “apply\nat all times,” even when CISWI units are starting up or\nshutting down. 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,711,\n15,737-38. The Agency concluded that it had no legal\nauthority under section 7429 to impose anything but a\nnumeric MACT standard on CISWI units. See id. at 15,709\ntbl.1; see also id. at 15,737-38.\n\n            b. The Record-Keeping Requirement\n\n     Whether the EPA considers a combustion unit to be a\nboiler (and thus subject to section 7412) or a CISWI (and thus\nsubject to section 7429) turns entirely on whether the unit\ncombusts “solid waste.” See id. at 15,709. The term “solid\nwaste” is defined in RCRA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6901 et seq., and\nclarified by EPA regulation, see Identification of Non-\nHazardous Secondary Materials that Are Solid Waste (NHSM\nRule), 76 Fed. Reg. 15,456, 15,457 (Mar. 21, 2011). See also\n2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,709. If the unit\ncombusts solid waste, it is a CISWI. Id.\n\n    The source owner or operator initially decides whether\nthe material its combustion unit burns meets the definition of\n\f                              28\n\nsolid waste. See id. at 15,740. For this reason, the CISWI\nrule requires that the owner or operator of a combustion unit\nthat burns materials “not clearly listed as traditional fuels”\nkeep records explaining how the materials meet the regulatory\ndefinition of “non-solid waste.” Id.; see also 40 C.F.R.\n§ 60.2175(v). Failure to do so means, for the purposes of the\nEPA, that “the operating unit is a CISWI unit.” 40 C.F.R.\n§ 60.2265; see also 2013 CISWI Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 9,188.\n\n                   c. Emissions Averaging\n\n     During the notice-and-comment period, certain industry\nentities urged the EPA to allow a facility containing more\nthan one CISWI unit to demonstrate compliance with the\nCISWI MACT standards by averaging the HAP emissions of\nall units in the facility. See Commercial and Industrial Solid\nWaste Incineration Units: Reconsideration and Proposed\nAmendments; Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials that Are\nSolid Waste (2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on\nReconsideration), 76 Fed. Reg. 80,452, 80,463 (Dec. 23,\n2011). Although it allowed facility-wide averaging in the\nMajor Boilers Rule, the Agency declined to allow it for\nfacilities with CISWI units. See id. The EPA explained, first,\nthat “[t]he applicability of CISWI is such that each unit is an\naffected facility.” Id. In response to further comments, the\nEPA subsequently explained that it did “not believe [it had]\nthe legal authority to allow emissions averaging in CISWI or\nunder section [7429] generally because each individual unit is\nan affected facility.” Summary of Public Comments and\nResponses for Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste\nIncineration Units (CISWI Rule—Responses to Comments),\nEPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0119-2638-A2 (Dec. 2012), at 195.\n\f                             29\n\n d. Treatment of Units that Begin Combusting Solid Waste\n\n     Finally, in the preamble to the 2011 CISWI Rule, the\nEPA stated broadly that “[u]nits that begin combusting solid\nwaste are considered existing sources under CISWI.” 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,714 (emphasis added).            This categorical\npronouncement drew objections from commentators who\ninsisted that, if such units experienced an increase in HAP\nemissions, the units would meet the statutory definition of\n“modified solid waste incineration unit[s],” see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7429(g)(3), and would, accordingly, be subject to the\nMACT standards for new units, see id. § 7429(g)(2). In the\nsubsequent proposed CISWI Rule, the EPA clarified that\n“[a]n existing source will not be considered a new source\nsolely due to a combustion material switch. Assuming new\nsource applicability is not triggered, existing sources that\nchange fuels or materials are considered existing\nsources . . . .”     2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on\nReconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,459.\n\n              II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     For each issue, the Petitioners argue that the EPA either\nmisinterpreted the CAA, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, or\nboth.

INDUSTRY PETITIONERS’ CHALLENGES\n\n     A. STARTUPS, SHUTDOWNS, AND MALFUNCTIONS\n\n     Industry Petitioners raise two sets of challenges to\nstartup, shutdown, and malfunction periods: (1) a challenge to\nthe EPA’s failure to take malfunctions into account in the\nMajor Boilers and Area Boilers Rules and (2) a challenge to\nEPA’s failure to take into account periods of startup,\nshutdown, and malfunction in the CISWI Rule. For the\nreasons that follow, we reject all of the Industry Petitioners’\nclaims related to startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions.\n\n 1. Periods of Malfunction in the Major Boilers and Area\n                      Boilers Rules\n\n     First, Industry Petitioners challenge the Major Boilers\nand Area Boilers Rules’ failure to take malfunctions into\naccount in setting MACT floors. See 2011 Major Boilers\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613; 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,560-61. The EPA defends its refusal to account for\nmalfunctions on the basis of (1) the impracticability of\naccounting for events that are necessarily unpredictable, and\n(2) the EPA’s assertion that it will use its prosecutorial\ndiscretion to determine on a case-by-case basis whether an\nexceedance of emission standards is attributable to an\nexcusable malfunction or whether applicable regulatory\npenalties should be imposed instead. See No. 11-1108 EPA\nBr. 38; No. 11-1141 EPA Br. 29.\n\f                              32\n\n     Both sides agree that malfunctions are inevitable in the\noperation of area and major boilers. According to the EPA,\n“even equipment that is properly designed and maintained can\nsometimes fail and . . . such failure can sometimes cause an\nexceedance of the relevant emission standard.” 2011 Major\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613; 2011 Area Boilers Rule,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 15,561. Thus, the EPA defined a malfunction\nas a “sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable\nfailure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment,\nprocess equipment or a process to operate in a normal or usual\nmanner.” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613\n(citing 40 C.F.R. § 63.2); 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,560 (same). In attempting to write rules to account\nfor emissions, however, the EPA faced an intractable\nproblem: how to account for a malfunction which is, by\ndefinition, unpredictable in terms of timing, duration,\nmagnitude, and effect. While the existence of malfunctions is\nentirely predictable, the nature of those malfunctions is not,\nand it is the malfunction’s nature that affects emissions and\nthus is relevant to the application of emission limits.\n\n     At first glance, the EPA’s chosen approach to\nmalfunctions may seem counterintuitive, as the Agency\nappears to have several reasonable alternatives: it could\nexempt periods of malfunction entirely from the application\nof the emission standards; or it could apply the standards to\nmalfunctions while giving boiler owners the opportunity to\ndefend against a penalty by demonstrating they were not at\nfault for the malfunction. But the EPA has previously been\nstymied in its attempts to implement either of these solutions,\nas this court has concluded neither approach is consistent with\nthe Agency’s enabling statutes. For instance, in Sierra Club\nIII, the EPA attempted to exempt major sources from\ncomplying with emission standards during start up, shut\n\f                               33\n\ndown, and malfunction. See 551 F.3d at 1027-28. This court\nrejected that approach because the Congress “required that\nthere must be continuous section 112-compliant standards”\nand so the EPA lacked discretion to exempt certain periods\nfrom compliance, regardless of their unpredictability. Id. at\n1027. In NRDC III, this court considered a challenge to the\naffirmative defense provision the EPA adopted for persons\ndefending against civil suits under 42 U.S.C. § 7604(a), which\nallows “any person” to “commence a civil action on his own\nbehalf” against any entity alleged to be in violation of an\nemission standard or limitation. The affirmative defense\nprovision was meant to shield alleged violators from liability\nfor certain emissions violations caused by “unavoidable”\nmalfunctions; under the provision, therefore, “the district\ncourt [could] assess penalties only if violators fail[ed] to meet\n[their] burden of proving all of the requirements in the\naffirmative defense.” NRDC III, 749 F.3d at 1062 (internal\nquotation omitted). The court rejected this provision as an\nimpermissible intrusion on the judiciary’s role. See id. at\n1063 (“[U]nder this statute, deciding whether penalties are\n‘appropriate’ in a given private civil suit is a job for the\ncourts, not for EPA.”).\n\n     Faced with an obvious dilemma, the EPA arrived at the\napproach it defends today. Malfunctions receive no special\ntreatment and the EPA instead exercises “its enforcement\ndiscretion to address exceedances of emission limits that may\nbe caused by such uncertain, unpredictable events, on a case-\nby-case basis.” No. 11-1108 EPA Br. 38; see also No. 11-\n1141 EPA Br. 29.          The EPA’s current treatment of\nmalfunctions thus differs from its invalid affirmative defense\nprovision because the Agency is exercising its own regulatory\nenforcement power on an ad hoc basis outside the context of\ncitizen suits.    When an exceedance occurs during a\n\f                              34\n\nmalfunction, the EPA determines what enforcement action—\nif any—it should take by considering “the good faith efforts\nof the source to minimize emissions during malfunction\nperiods, including preventative and corrective actions, as well\nas root cause analyses to ascertain and rectify excess\nemissions.” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613;\nsee also 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,561\n(same). The EPA also considers whether the exceedance was\nin fact “not reasonably preventable” or whether it was\n“caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation.”\n2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613 (citing 40\nC.F.R. § 63.2); see also 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 15,561 (same).\n\n     For our purposes, we need not (indeed, must not)\nevaluate the policy implications of the EPA’s regulatory\nchoice because our review is confined to determining whether\nthe EPA’s regulation reflects a permissible reading of the\napplicable statute under Chevron. Here, we conclude that it\ndoes. The relevant statute requires only that the EPA set\n“achievable” standards, 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2), and it defines\nachievability to be no less “than the emission control that is\nachieved in practice by the best controlled similar source,” 42\nU.S.C. § 7412(d)(3). The “best controlled similar source,”\nhowever, is unlikely to be a malfunctioning source, and the\nEPA is bound to enact a standard in keeping with emission\nlimits achieved by that “best controlled similar source.” If\nanything, then, the statutory language on its face prevents the\nEPA from taking into account the effect of potential\nmalfunctions when setting MACT emission standards. At the\nvery least, the language permits the EPA to ignore\nmalfunctions in its standard-setting and account for them\ninstead through its regulatory discretion. Our Sierra Club III\ndecision confirms this. See 551 F.3d at 1027-28. Because the\n\f                              35\n\nEPA had no option to exclude these unpredictable periods, its\napproach is reasonable.       We therefore reject Industry\nPetitioners’ argument that the EPA either misinterpreted the\nCAA or acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to account\nfor malfunctions when setting MACT floors in the Major and\nArea Boilers Rules.\n\n     Nor do we agree with the Industry Petitioners’ secondary\nargument that the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously by\nfailing to set a work-practice or a GACT management-\npractice standard for malfunction periods. First, the statute\nmakes clear that these kinds of standards are to be set at the\ndiscretion of the EPA, so it would be difficult to interpret the\nstatute consistently with its text while holding that the text’s\npermissive language in fact sets out a requirement that the\nAgency set work-practice or GACT management-practice\nstandards.       As to work-practice standards, “[t]he\nAdministrator may, in lieu [of a numeric standard],\npromulgate a design, equipment, work practice, or operational\nstandard, or combination thereof,” and any such standard set\nmust “in the Administrator’s judgment [be] consistent with\nthe provisions of subsection (d).” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(h)(1). As\nto GACT management-practice standards, “the Administrator\nmay . . . elect to promulgate” such standards with respect to\ncertain “categories and subcategories of area sources.” Id.\n§ 7412(d)(5). It should go without saying that “may means\nmay.” McCreary v. Offner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184836\"><a href=\"/opinion/184836/mccreary-maurice-v-offner-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 83 (D.C. Cir. 1999)\n(internal quotations omitted).\n\n    Second, the Petitioners have not demonstrated and the\nEPA does not concede that setting work-practice or GACT\nmanagement-practice standards would even be feasible for\nperiods of malfunction. As for work-practice standards, the\nEPA would have to conceive of a standard that could apply\n\f                             36\n\nequally to the wide range of possible boiler malfunctions,\nranging from an explosion to minor mechanical defects. Any\npossible standard is likely to be hopelessly generic to govern\nsuch a wide array of circumstances. Similar problems exist\nfor setting GACT management practices. These management\npractices would also need to apply to the wide range of\npossible malfunctions, and the EPA would need to determine\nthat the standard would “reduce emissions of hazardous air\npollutants,” an evidence-based standard that is difficult\n(perhaps impossible) to apply to the unpredictable\ncircumstances       of      malfunctions.      42       U.S.C.\n§ 7412(d)(5). Thus, we reject the Industry Petitioners’\nargument that the EPA was required to set a work-practice or\nGACT management-practice standard for malfunction\nperiods.\n\n     In doing so, we are mindful that the EPA is not the only\nentity able to bring enforcement actions under the CAA, but\nthat private citizens are also empowered to enforce emission\nstandards by filing suit in district court. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7604(a). Assurances that the EPA will use its prosecutorial\ndiscretion to account for malfunctions would mean little if\nprivate citizens could seek strict enforcement of those same\nstandards. But as we stated in NRDC III, “the Judiciary, not\nany executive agency, determines ‘the scope’—including the\navailable remedies—‘of judicial power vested by’ statutes\nestablishing private rights of action.” 749 F.3d at 1063\n(quoting City of Arlington v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"868384\"><a href=\"/opinion/868384/arlington-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1863</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1871\n(2013)). Accordingly, in citizen suits under the CAA, “the\ncourts determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether civil\npenalties are ‘appropriate.’” Id. Boiler operators can argue\nthat penalties should not be assessed because of an\nunavoidable malfunction, and they can support that argument\nwith other relevant facts, “such as the defendant’s ‘full\n\f                               37\n\ncompliance history and good faith efforts to comply.’” Id.\n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 7413(e)(1)). The EPA can also provide\nsupporting argumentation as intervenor or amicus. Id. Courts\nshould not hesitate to exercise their judicial authority to craft\nappropriate civil remedies in the case of emissions\nexceedances caused by unavoidable malfunctions.\n\n 2. Periods of Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction in the\n                        CISWI Rule\n\n     In the CISWI Rule, the EPA made no modification for\nperiods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. The Industry\nPetitioners argue that failing to account for these periods\nviolated the EPA’s statutory instruction to set “achievable”\nstandards. Additionally, the Industry Petitioners claim it was\narbitrary and capricious for the EPA to set work-practice\nstandards for startup and shutdown periods under the Major\nBoilers Rule but not under the CISWI Rule. Both arguments\nare without merit.\n\n     First, the EPA’s emission standards for small incinerators\ndo take into account periods of shutdown and startup. The\nEPA based its standards for these machines on “short term\nstack tests for pollutants,” in which incinerators are monitored\nduring the course of normal operation, which includes daily\nstartup and shutdown periods. See 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,738. Thus, startup and shutdown times are already\nincorporated into the standards the EPA set, and what is more,\nnearly all pollutants are present in smaller numbers during\nstartup and shutdown anyway, when incinerators are burning\nfuels alone rather than fuels and solid waste. See Standards of\nPerformance for New Stationary Sources and Emission\nGuidelines for Existing Sources: Commercial and Industrial\nSolid Waste Incineration Units (2010 Proposed CISWI Rule),\n\f                               38\n\n75 Fed. Reg. 31,938, 31,964 (June 4, 2010). Given this\nreality, the CISWI Rule satisfies the statutory standard of\n“achievability” and is not arbitrary and capricious.\n\n     Second, as to periods of malfunctions, the same analysis\napplies to the CISWI Rule as applies to the Boilers\nRules. The EPA adopted a reasonable interpretation of the\nCAA when it excluded periods of malfunction from its\ncalculations of achievability given that malfunction periods\nare by their very nature unpredictable in terms of their effect\non emissions. The EPA’s decision to account for\nmalfunctions in its discretion is likewise a reasonable\ninterpretation of 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2) and (3).\n\n    For these reasons, we reject the Industry Petitioners’\nchallenges to the EPA’s regulatory choices with regard to\nperiods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction.\n\n      B. THE POLLUTANT-BY-POLLUTANT APPROACH\n\n     The EPA must look to the performance of the best major\nboilers and CISWI incinerators when setting MACT floors for\na pollutant. As described above, for new units, the EPA must\nset floors at the level achieved by the best similar unit in each\nsubcategory. For existing units, the Agency must set floors at\nthe level achieved by the best 12 per cent of similar units in\neach subcategory. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7412(d)(3)(A), 7429(a)(2).\nAs a result, the EPA had to identify the best performing units\nin each subcategory when setting the MACT floors for the\nMajor Boilers and CISWI Rules. But the EPA often could not\nidentify a single unit or set of units that controlled all HAPs\nbetter than the other units in the subcategory. Instead, the\nEPA sometimes found that a unit might rank among the best\n\f                              39\n\nin its subcategory at controlling emissions of one HAP, but\namong the worst at controlling emissions of a different HAP.\n\n     To address this problem, the EPA adopted a “pollutant-\nby-pollutant” approach in setting the MACT floors: instead of\nidentifying the unit or units that best controlled all HAPs in\nthe aggregate, the EPA used one unit or set of units to set the\nMACT floor for, e.g., PM, and used a different unit or set of\nunits to set the MACT floor for, e.g., HCl. See 2011 Major\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,621-23; 2011 CISWI Rule,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 15,720-21. For at least two subcategories of\nmajor boilers—new heavy oil-fired units and existing stoker\ncoal-fired units—the EPA’s pollutant-by-pollutant approach\nresulted in MACT floors that no unit in the subcategory had\nachieved in toto. Similarly, for small, remote incinerators\n(SRIs), the approach resulted in standards for existing units\nthat only two of the 28 SRI units had met in toto, and\nstandards for new units that no existing SRI had met in toto.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners challenge the EPA’s use of the\npollutant-by-pollutant approach. According to the Industry\nPetitioners, the CAA’s plain language requires the Agency to\nidentify the best overall unit or set of units—not the best unit\nor set of units for a particular pollutant—in each subcategory\nwhen setting MACT floors. They further claim the EPA’s\npollutant-by-pollutant approach was unreasonable with regard\nto SRIs because it resulted in a set of emission standards that\nno single unit in the subcategory had achieved in practice.\nWe disagree, and conclude that the EPA’s pollutant-by-\npollutant approach is a reasonable interpretation and\napplication of the statute.\n\n    For the purposes of this challenge, the MACT floor\nprovisions for major boilers and CISWI units are identical.\n\f                              40\n\nUnder both provisions, the EPA must set emission standards\nfor new units based on “the emissions control that is achieved\nin practice by the best controlled similar unit, as determined\nby the Administrator.” 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2) (CISWI); see\nalso id. § 7412(d)(3) (major boilers). For existing units, the\nMACT floor is based on “the average emissions limitation\nachieved by the best performing 12 percent of units in the\ncategory.”     Id. § 7429(a)(2) (CISWI); see also id.\n§ 7412(d)(3)(A) (major boilers).\n\n     The Industry Petitioners claim this language\nunambiguously forecloses the EPA’s pollutant-by-pollutant\napproach. For new units, they assert, the statute requires the\nEPA to find the single unit that performs best overall and use\nthis unit—and only this unit—to set standards for all\nregulated pollutants. For example, if Incinerator 3 were\ndeemed the best overall performer in a subcategory, then the\nEPA would use Incinerator 3’s emissions levels to set\nstandards for PM, CO, and each of the other regulated\npollutants. This would be true even if Incinerator 1 in the\nsame subcategory had lower CO emissions and Incinerator 2\nhad lower PM emissions. The Industry Petitioners also make\nthis argument for existing sources. For these units, under\ntheir interpretation, the mandate to identify the “best\nperforming 12 percent of units” required the EPA to use data\nfrom the 12 per cent of sources with the lowest overall\nemissions in the subcategory.         In short, the Industry\nPetitioners argue that the best “unit” referred to by the\nprovision cannot be a “hypothetical composite” of multiple\nunits that result in standards for new units that no actual unit\nhas met in practice with regard to every pollutant, or\nstandards for existing units that 12 per cent of actual units\nhave not met with regard to every pollutant.\n\f                              41\n\n     The Industry Petitioners read too much into the statutory\nlanguage. It is true that the statute requires the EPA to base\nMACT standards on what is “achieved” by the best “unit” or\n“12 percent of units.” But, as the EPA argues, the statute says\nnothing about how the Agency should determine which units\nare the best. Cf. Sierra Club v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184823\"><a href=\"/opinion/184823/sierra-club-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 661 (D.C.\nCir. 1999) (noting that section 7429(a) “on its own says\nnothing about how the performance of the best units is to be\ncalculated”). Both the industry-favored method of choosing\nthe best overall unit and the EPA’s method of choosing the\nbest unit as to each particular pollutant facially comport with\nthe statute’s mandate to determine which units are best.\nBecause the statute is ambiguous as to how the EPA should\nidentify those units, we must defer to the Agency’s choice so\nlong as it is reasonable. See Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 990.\n\n     Here, the EPA’s choice is reasonable. The statute\nprovides that emission standards shall reflect “the maximum\ndegree of reduction in emissions of [regulated pollutants] that\nthe Administrator . . . determines is achievable for new or\nexisting units in each category.” 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2); see\nalso id. § 7412(d)(2). It then provides that the “degree of\nreduction in emissions that is deemed achievable for new\nunits in a category shall not be less stringent than the\nemissions control that is achieved in practice by the best\ncontrolled similar unit, as determined by the Administrator.”\nId. § 7429(a)(2); see also id. § 7412(d)(3). Reading these\nprovisions together, they support a pollutant-by-pollutant\napproach. The “best controlled similar unit” language does\nnot exist in a vacuum; rather, it exists to measure the “degree\nof reduction in emissions that is deemed achievable.” Id.\n§ 7429(a)(2); see also id. § 7412(d)(3). That “reduction in\nemissions” is the reduction in emissions of each pollutant\nlisted in sections 7429(a)(4) and 7412(b)(1). The EPA’s\n\f                              42\n\napproach to setting standards on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis\nthus comfortably fits within this statutory scheme.\n\n     Moreover, the Industry Petitioners have not explained\nhow their preferred approach would better comport with the\nstatute. Were the EPA required to determine which units\nperform best “overall,” we see at least two possibilities for\nhow it could do so: First, the EPA could calculate a unit’s\naverage emissions for each pollutant in consistent units of\nmeasurement, add these emissions together, and then choose\nthe unit with the smallest overall sum in each subcategory.\nBut this approach could produce arbitrary results, because the\n“best performing” overall unit might emit unusually low\nquantities of some pollutants and unusually high quantities of\nothers. This would mean the emission standards for some\npollutants would be lenient while others would be stringent,\nwith no principled reason for the difference. Alternatively,\nthe Agency could identify which source is best overall based\non which emits the lowest level of the riskiest pollutants. But\nthis approach would require the Agency to rank pollutants’\nrelative risks without any congressional guidance on how to\ndo so. This approach would also contravene our previous\nunderstanding of the congressional intent behind the MACT\nfloor provisions. As we have explained, the MACT floors\n“are to be based not on an assessment of the risks posed by\n[pollutants], but instead on the maximum achievable control\ntechnology (MACT) for sources in each category.” Sierra\nClub I, 353 F.3d at 980.\n\n    The Industry Petitioners nevertheless argue that the\nCAA’s legislative history supports their preferred approach.\nIn particular, they point to the floor comments of Senator\nDurenberger discussing the potential impact on MACT floors\nof mutually incompatible control technologies. 136 Cong.\n\f                              43\n\nRec. S17,238 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1990) (statement of Senator\nDurenberger). Mutually incompatible control technologies\ncannot be used at the same time and therefore present\nregulators with a dilemma. For example, say Technology 1\nand Technology 2 cannot be used together. If Technology 1\nis better at reducing PM than Technology 2, and Technology\n2 is better at reducing CO than Technology 1, the EPA would\nhave to choose which of the two technologies to factor into\nemission standards. In such situations, Senator Durenberger\nanticipated that the “EPA should judge MACT to be the\ntechnology which best benefits human health and the\nenvironment on the whole.” Id. The Industry Petitioners\nargue this statement demonstrates that Congress intended the\nEPA to make an overall determination of which units are the\nbest performing “on the whole.”\n\n     Senator Durenberger’s statement does not support this\nbroad principle. The statement merely explains that, where\ntwo technologies cannot be used together, the EPA should\nbase MACT standards on the technology it considers best\noverall. Here, the Industry Petitioners do not identify any\nrelevant control technologies that are mutually incompatible.\nIndeed, the EPA found in the CISWI Rule that “there is no\ntechnical reason why [the] air pollution control systems\ncannot be combined.” 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,721; see also 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,623 (“All available data for boilers and process heaters\nindicate that there is no technical problem achieving the floor\nlevels contained in this final rule for each HAP\nsimultaneously, using the MACT floor technology.”). There\nis thus no reason to believe that the EPA’s current MACT\nfloor standards cannot be achieved. Instead, the Industry\nPetitioners merely insist that no units currently meet the\nEPA’s new unit standards with regard to every regulated\n\f                              44\n\npollutant in certain subcategories, and only a few sources\nmeet all of the standards for existing units in the same\nsubcategories. But, if the statute permits the EPA to\ndetermine which units are best on a pollutant-by-pollutant\nbasis—and it does—then the EPA’s choice to adopt that\napproach does not become unlawful merely because few or no\nunits have achieved those standards for all pollutants.\n\n     Finally, the Industry Petitioners argue that even if the\npollutant-by-pollutant approach is reasonable in some\ncircumstances, it is arbitrary and capricious as applied to\ncertain SRIs because it exacerbates certain problems posed by\nthe “batch” nature of SRIs. As explained at infra § III.E,\nSRIs burn waste in small batches. According to the\nPetitioners, this means that the SRIs that the EPA identified as\nbest performing were, in reality, burning cleaner waste at the\ntime emissions testing was done; they were not actually better\nthan other units at removing or destroying waste. The\npollutant-by-pollutant approach, the Industry Petitioners\nargue, “simply captures the results from units that happened\nto be burning wastes with low levels of that particular\npollutant during testing,” and this reality makes it harder for\nSRI units to meet emission standards for all pollutants at the\nsame time. No. 11-1125 Indus. Pet’rs’ Reply Br. 8 (emphasis\nomitted).\n\n     This argument fails because the Industry Petitioners have\nnot demonstrated that the Agency considered impermissible\nfactors, failed “to consider important aspect[s] of the\nproblem,” or offered an unreasonable explanation for its\ndecision when setting the MACT floors for SRIs. See State\nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43. Rather, their argument is a back-door\nattempt to challenge the Agency’s alleged failure to consider\nwaste inputs, which we reject below at infra § III.E.\n\f                               45\n\nPetitioners have also not shown that it is infeasible for the SRI\nunits to meet the MACT floor standards or that any individual\npollutant standard was not achieved in practice by an existing\nSRI unit. They merely assert, without evidence, that no\nexisting unit burning high sulfur garbage can match the SO2\nperformance achieved by the unit the EPA used to set SO2\nstandards because that latter unit was burning low sulfur\nwaste at the time of the emissions testing. But MACT floors\nare not unreasonable simply because they are difficult to\nachieve in practice. As such, we find the EPA’s pollutant-by-\npollutant approach to be a reasonable interpretation and\napplication of the statute, and deny the Industry Petitioners’\nchallenge to the EPA’s use of this approach.\n\n       C. THE ENERGY-ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENT\n\n     The Major Boilers Rule and the Area Boilers Rule\ngenerally require sources with existing boilers to perform a\none-time energy assessment. In the assessment, facilities\nmust “identify energy conservation measures”—such as\n“process changes or other modifications to the facility”—\n“that can be implemented to reduce the facility energy\ndemand,” thereby “reduc[ing] fuel use.” 2011 Area Boilers\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573; see also 2011 Major Boilers\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,632. While facilities must conduct\nthe assessment, they need not implement its conclusions. See\n2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573; 2011 Major\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,632.\n\n     The logic behind the assessment is straightforward.\nBoilers produce HAP emissions when fuel is combusted.\nLess combustion means fewer emissions. The EPA primarily\njustified the assessment as a beyond-the-floor MACT\nrequirement under section 7412(d)(2). See 2011 Area Boilers\n\f                               46\n\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573; 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76\nFed. Reg. at 15,632. With respect to certain biomass and oil-\nfired boilers located at area sources, the assessment was\njustified as a GACT management practice under\nsection 7412(d)(5). See 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 15,567.\n\n     Industry Petitioners raise three principal challenges to the\nenergy-assessment requirement, none of which have purchase.\nThe first challenge claims that the energy assessment\nregulates aspects of facilities that are off limits to the EPA—\nnamely, the energy needs supplied by regulated boilers.\nPetitioners point to the language of the CAA, which requires\nthe EPA to “list . . . categories and subcategories of major\nsources and area sources” of enumerated air pollutants. 42\nU.S.C. § 7412(c)(1). “For the categories and subcategories\nthe Administrator lists, the Administrator” must set\n“emissions standards under” section 7412(d).                   Id.\n§ 7412(c)(2). As relevant here, the EPA defined the source\ncategories to include “industrial boilers and commercial and\ninstitutional boilers.” 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,557; 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,608. To\nthe extent the assessment concerns parts of the facility other\nthan the boiler itself, the Industry Petitioners claim it exceeds\nthe EPA’s authority.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners misapprehend both the scope of\nthe assessment and the CAA. The assessment requires\nfacilities to evaluate energy systems “located on the site of the\naffected boiler,” including “[p]rocess heating[,] compressed\nair systems[,] . . . facility heating, ventilation, and air\nconditioning systems,” and “[o]ther systems that use steam,\nhot water, process heat, or electricity, provided by the affected\nboiler.” 40 C.F.R. § 63.11237; see id. § 63.7575. Based on\n\f                              47\n\nthat evaluation, facilities must compile a “comprehensive\nreport detailing the ways to improve efficiency, the cost of\nspecific improvements, [anticipated] benefits, and the time\nframe for recouping those investments.” 40 C.F.R. pt. 63,\nsubpt. JJJJJJ tbl.2; id. pt. 63, subpt. DDDDD tbl.3.\n\n     Contrary to the Industry Petitioners’ argument, the EPA\nhas not “regulate[d] virtually every piece of equipment at all\naffected facilities.” No. 11-1141 Indus. Pet’rs’ Br. 19. Only\n“energy use systems” that “us[e] energy clearly produced by\naffected boilers” must be evaluated; facilities need not review\nthe “total aggregation of all individual energy using segments\nof a facility.” 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,493\n(emphasis added); see also 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 7,188. The assessment focuses on “discrete segments\nof a facility,” such as “production area[s] or building[s]”\nassociated with a particular boiler. 2013 Area Boilers Rule,\n78 Fed. Reg. at 7,493; see 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed.\nReg. at 7,188. Energy requirements satisfied by other\nsources—not by a HAP-emitting boiler—fall outside of that\nmandate. See 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573\n(limiting the assessment to “specific portions of the source\nthat directly affect emissions from the affected boiler”). And\nregulated facilities are under no obligation to implement the\nresults they reach. In essence, rather than setting inflexible\nand generally applicable beyond-the-floor numeric limits, the\nEPA required facilities to take stock of the actual energy\ndemands placed on their boilers. By reducing energy\ndemands and associated fuel consumption, facilities could\nreduce HAP emissions. That requirement is more measured\nthan the Industry Petitioners contend.\n\n     And that measured requirement falls within the EPA’s\nstatutory authority. The CAA authorizes the EPA to regulate\n\f                               48\n\n“major sources and area sources” of HAPs, and to subdivide\nthose sources into categories and subcategories. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(c)(1), (c)(2). To Industry Petitioners, the authority to\nsubdivide sources means the EPA may only regulate the\nnarrowest applicable categorization—in this instance,\ncommercial and industrial boilers. But the statute does not\nrequire so rigid a reading. While the EPA is permitted to\nsubdivide sources, each subdivision remains a component of\neither a major or area “source.” Dividing sources into\ncategories and subcategories does not make them any less of a\n“source” subject to the EPA’s regulation.\n\n     For that reason, the EPA explained that the Rules reach,\nrespectively, “[a]ny area source facility using a boiler,” 2011\nArea Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,555 (emphasis added),\nand “major source facilities having affected boilers or process\nheaters,” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,613\n(emphasis added). Likewise, the regulations implementing\nthe energy assessment requirement apply to those who “own\nor operate an existing affected boiler,” not merely to the\nboiler itself. 40 C.F.R. § 63.11214(c); see id. § 63.7485.\nGoing further, the relevant part of the CFR applies, by its own\nterms, to the “owner or operator of any stationary source.” Id.\n§ 63.1(b)(1).\n\n     The Congress’s definition of the terms major and area\nsource supports this reading. At bottom, both terms refer to a\n“stationary source.” See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(a)(1), (a)(2).\nStationary source, in turn, means “any building, structure,\nfacility, or installation which emits or may emit any air\npollutant.” Id. § 7411(a)(3). Against that backdrop, the Rules\napply to any “building, structure, facility, or installation” that\ncontains a boiler emitting the specified HAPs. The EPA’s\n\f                               49\n\nregulatory authority reaches the relevant stationary source, of\nwhich the boiler is part.\n\n     That the EPA may regulate stationary sources does not\nmean it may regulate every nook and cranny of those sources.\nThe CAA directs its authority to the establishment of\nemission standards; it does not provide some general power to\nsuperintend the business processes of plants and\nmanufacturing facilities. In this case, however, we have no\noccasion to parse the precise parameters of the EPA’s\nauthority to regulate aspects of area sources. It is enough to\nconclude that the challenged energy assessment—which\napplies only to systems that “us[e] energy clearly produced by\naffected boilers”—falls within the EPA’s authority under the\nCAA. 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,493; 2013\nMajor Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,188.\n\n    In the remaining two challenges, the Industry Petitioners\ntake issue with the EPA’s justification of the energy\nassessment as a beyond-the-floor MACT standard and a\nGACT management-practice standard.         We reject both\nchallenges.\n\n     The assessment represents a valid beyond-the-floor\nMACT standard.13 As discussed, after the Agency sets the\nMACT floor, it must determine “whether stricter standards\nare ‘achievable,’” Nat’l Lime Ass’n, 233 F.3d at 629 (quoting\n42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2)), considering costs, “any non-air\n    13\n        In addition to challenging the assessment as a beyond-the-\nfloor measure, the Industry Petitioners claim the assessment\nrepresents an invalid work-practice standard. But “[t]he energy\nassessment is not . . . a work practice standard, and EPA makes no\nclaim that it is.” No. 11-1141 EPA Br. 47 n.9. Therefore, we\ndecline to address that contention.\n\f                              50\n\nquality health and environmental impacts and energy\nrequirements,” 42 US.C. § 7412(d)(2). These “measures,\nprocesses, methods, systems or techniques includ[e], but [are]\nnot limited to, measures which—\n\n   (A) reduce the volume of, or eliminate emissions\n       of, such pollutants through process changes,\n       substitution    of    materials   or   other\n       modifications, . . .\n\n   (D) are design, equipment, work practice, or\n       operational standards . . . or\n\n   (E) are a combination of the above.\n\nId. The EPA primarily justified the energy assessment as a\nbeyond-the-floor measure designed to identify “process\nchanges or other modifications to the facility” that would\nreduce fuel use and thereby reduce hazardous emissions.\n2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573; 2011 Major\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,632.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners argue that the EPA skipped a\nstep, imposing the energy assessment as a beyond-the-floor\nmeasure without first setting a relevant MACT floor. That is\nincorrect. The EPA first set a numeric MACT emissions limit\nfor the categories and subcategories of sources subject to the\nenergy assessment. See 40 C.F.R. pt. 63, subpt. JJJJJ tbl.1; id.\npt. 63, subpt. DDDDD tbl.2. The energy assessment\nrepresents a step beyond that—a measure designed to\ndiscover energy efficiencies that, once implemented, could\ndecrease emissions below the floor level.\n\n    Before setting a beyond-the-floor measure, the EPA must\nconsider whether it is “achievable” based on a number of\n\f                              51\n\nfactors, among them cost, “non-air quality health and\nenvironmental impacts and energy requirements.” 42 US.C.\n§ 7412(d)(2). The EPA did so here. To begin, the EPA\nadequately considered costs. In the EPA’s estimation, “[t]he\none-time cost of an energy assessment ranges from $2500 to\n$55,000 depending on the size of the facility.” 2010 Proposed\nArea Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,907; National Emission\nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources:\nIndustrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers and Process\nHeaters (2010 Proposed Major Boilers Rule), 75 Fed. Reg.\n32,006, 32,026 (June 4, 2010). Because saving fuel saves\nmoney, common sense suggested that sources would often\nfind the energy assessment “cost-effective” to implement.\n2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,568 (“By\ndefinition, any emission reduction [achieved as a result of the\nenergy assessment] would be cost effective or else it would\nnot be implemented.”); see also 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76\nFed. Reg. at 15,633.\n\n    In addition to costs, the EPA considered non-air quality\nhealth and environmental impacts in general terms,\nconcluding that “improving energy efficiency reduces\nnegative impacts on the environment.” 2010 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,907; 2010 Proposed Major\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,026. Given the nature of the\nassessment, the EPA’s somewhat terse analysis of health and\nenvironmental impacts suffices. Performing the assessment\ninvolves rudimentary tasks—examining the boiler and\nassociated energy systems and drafting a report—that do not\nimpose meaningful health or environmental impacts. The\nsame holds for the EPA’s consideration of energy use\nrequirements. Facilities would expend very little energy in\nconducting the one-time assessment, and could conserve\n\f                             52\n\nenergy by implementing the results. The assessment therefore\nrepresents a lawful beyond-the-floor measure.\n\n     We also find that the assessment is a valid GACT\nmanagement practice. With respect to area sources, the EPA\nhas discretion to require the use of “generally available\ncontrol technologies or management practices . . . to reduce\nemissions of hazardous air pollutants.”           42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(d)(5). The EPA justified the energy assessment as a\nGACT management practice for oil- and biomass-fired\nboilers. See 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,567.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners challenge that justification,\nclaiming the energy assessment—which does not require\nimplementation—cannot “reduce emissions of hazardous air\npollutants.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(5). We disagree. The EPA\ndid not need to make implementation mandatory to make the\nassessment lawful. Under the CAA, the EPA may sometimes\nact with a soft touch, rather than a firm hand. Here, the EPA\nselected a soft touch, requiring an assessment but not\nimplementation. It was not unreasonable for the EPA to\nconclude, “after considering the structure of the requirement,\nthe incentives it presents, and the likely behavior of\nsources, . . . that sources will find it cost-effective to\nimplement the conservation measures identified in the energy\nassessment.” 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,573.\nIf the results were implemented, HAP emissions would be\nreduced. For present purposes, that is enough.\n\n    For those reasons, we reject the Industry Petitioners’\nchallenges to the energy-assessment requirement.\n\f                               53\n\n  D. RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENT FOR CISWI UNITS\n\n     Section 7429 regulates combustion units that burn solid\nwaste; units that do not burn solid waste will generally be\nregulated under section 7412. RCRA defines the term “solid\nwaste” to mean (in part) “discarded material . . . resulting\nfrom industrial [or] commercial . . . operations.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 6903(27); see id. § 7429(g)(6) (directing that “solid waste”\ncarry “the meanings established by the Administrator\npursuant to” RCRA). On the same day the EPA issued a rule\nsetting emission standards for CISWI, it issued a separate rule\nfleshing out the meaning of solid waste in the context of\ncombustion units. See NHSM Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,456.\n\n     The NHSM Rule generally provides that “non-hazardous\nsecondary materials that are combusted are solid wastes,”14\nsubject to several exceptions and exemptions. 40 C.F.R.\n§ 241.3(a). Among the exceptions, non-hazardous secondary\nmaterials that meet certain “legitimacy” criteria do not qualify\nas solid waste. See id. § 241.3(b), (d). Source owners and\noperators may also seek a finding from the EPA that\nparticular materials do not constitute solid waste when\ncombusted by a third party. Id. § 241.3(c). And the rule\nexempts altogether a variety of materials from the definition\nof solid waste, including “traditional fuels.” Id. § 241.2.\n\n    The NHSM Rule is self-implementing: each source\nowner or operator must determine whether combusted\nmaterials meet the definition of solid waste. See 2011 CISWI\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,740. To ensure that owners and\n\n    14\n         The NHSM Rule defines non-hazardous secondary material\nto “mean[] a secondary material that, when discarded, would not be\nidentified as a hazardous waste.” 40 C.F.R. § 241.2.\n\f                                  54\n\noperators “review and apply” the NHSM Rule and its\nexceptions, the EPA issued strict recordkeeping requirements.\nId. Owners and operators who determine the secondary\nmaterials they combust are not solid waste must “keep a\nrecord” justifying that decision. 40 C.F.R. § 60.2175(v).\nFailing to file records carries consequences. For units\ncombusting discarded material other than traditional fuels, the\nfailure to “keep and produce records” results in the\ndetermination that “the operating unit is a CISWI unit.” Id.\n§§ 60.2265, 60.2875 (containing an identical provision).\n\n     Industry Petitioners challenge this last provision of the\nCISWI Rule.15 They argue that the EPA cannot automatically\ntreat units that fail to keep certain paperwork as CISWI units.\nSection 7429 permits regulation of “solid waste incineration\nunits”—not units whose owners fail to file paperwork. As a\nresult, the Industry Petitioners ask this court to invalidate the\nregulatory provision as exceeding the EPA’s statutory\nauthority.16\n\n     We decline the invitation. At Chevron’s first step, we\nfind that “Congress did not speak directly, let alone clearly, to\n\n     15\n        In their reply brief, the Industry Petitioners clarify that they\ndo not challenge the EPA’s authority to require sources to keep\nrecords.\n     16\n         The Industry Petitioners also argue the EPA arbitrarily\nfailed to provide sufficient notice of the recordkeeping\npresumption. We disagree. The Industry Petitioners had sufficient\nnotice of the CISWI Rule, which was promulgated after notice and\ncomment and “give[s] fair warning of the conduct it prohibits.”\nGen. Elec.

Cir. 2003). Section 7429 regulates “solid waste\nincineration units,” a phrase that Congress defined “plainly\nand broadly to include ‘a distinct operating unit of any facility\nwhich combusts any solid waste material from commercial or\nindustrial establishments or the general public.’” NRDC I,\n489 F.3d at 1257 (emphasis omitted) (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7429(g)(1)). In NRDC I, we vacated an earlier iteration of\nthe CISWI Rule that narrowed the scope of that definition\nbeyond what its language would bear. See id. at 1257-58.\nWhen the Congress commanded the EPA to regulate units\nthat burn “any” solid waste, the Congress meant what it said.\nSee id.\n\n     In this case, the EPA included within the revised CISWI\nRule a presumption designed to enforce the Congress’s\ncommand. Section 7429 nowhere addresses whether the EPA\nmay establish presumptions to ensure its regulations reach all\nsources burning solid waste. At the same time, the Congress\nplainly intended the EPA to regulate sources burning “any”\nsolid waste, a goal presumably advanced by the\nrecordkeeping presumption. See id. Against that backdrop,\nwe cannot conclude that the presumption offends the text or\npurpose of section 7429.\n\n    Moving to Chevron’s second step, we conclude the\nrecordkeeping presumption is reasonable. In American\nChemistry Council, we upheld a regulation issued under\nRCRA defining hazardous waste to include any mixture or\nderivative of hazardous substances. See 337 F.3d at 1064-65.\n“[B]ecause many mixtures of and derivatives from hazardous\nwastes are themselves hazardous, it [was] reasonable for the\nEPA to assume that all such mixtures and derivatives are\nhazardous until shown otherwise.” Id. at 1065. In that\n\f                              56\n\ncontext, it made good sense for the EPA to “[p]lac[e] the\nburden upon the regulated entity” to show that a given\nsubstance lacked “hazardous characteristic[s].” Id.\n\n     Similar reasoning applies here. The EPA crafted the\npresumption to reach sources likely to be burning solid waste,\nnamely, those burning discarded materials other than\ntraditional fuels. See 42 U.S.C. § 6903(27) (defining “solid\nwaste” to include, among other things, “discarded material”);\n40 C.F.R. § 241.2 (exempting traditional fuels, defined as\n“materials that are produced as fuels . . . that have not been\ndiscarded,” from the definition of solid waste). Such sources\nare subject to strict recordkeeping requirements. See 40\nC.F.R. § 60.2175(v). Within those confines, placing the\nburden on unit operators who have the mandatory obligation\nand the information to establish their non-regulable status is\nreasonable. Cf. Am. Chem. Council, 337 F.3d at 1065.\n\n     There is, however, a difference between the presumption\nin this case and the one we upheld in American Chemistry\nCouncil. The CISWI recordkeeping presumption appears to\nturn on the failure to file paperwork, rather than the presence\nof a regulated substance. However broadly the Congress\ndefined “solid waste incineration unit” in section 7429, the\nCongress did not allow for the regulation of non-waste\nburning sources—even when those sources fail to file\npaperwork. Indeed, had the EPA attempted to regulate\nsources based purely on a failure to file paperwork, we may\nwell have reached a different conclusion.\n\n    But the CISWI presumption does not stretch so far. As\nexplained, the presumption depends on factors beyond the\nmere failure to keep records. Sources subject to the\npresumption burn materials likely to qualify as solid waste,\n\f                                57\n\nand must satisfy demanding recordkeeping requirements. The\nEPA acted reasonably when it presumed such sources were\nburning solid waste.\n\n     Despite the provision’s narrow reach, the Industry\nPetitioners fear it will sweep up sources not burning solid\nwaste.     To the extent that possibility exists, sources\nwrongfully regulated as CISWI have multiple forms of\nrecourse. Most obviously, sources can prepare and file the\nrecords they were already required to make under 40 C.F.R.\n§ 60.2175(v). They can also avail themselves of procedures\ndesigned to identify non-waste materials in 40 C.F.R. § 241.3.\nThe existence of these safety valves calms concerns that the\npresumption will regulate non-waste burning sources.\n\n      We therefore reject the Industry Petitioners’ challenges\nto the recordkeeping presumption.17\n\n         E. WASTE-STREAM VARIANCE FOR SRI UNITS\n\n     The EPA regulated SRIs as a subcategory in the CISWI\nRule. See Memorandum from Eastern Research Group, Inc.,\nto Toni Jones, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, CISWI\nEmission Limit Calculations for Existing and New Sources\nfor the Reconsideration Final Rule (Jones Mem.) (Nov. 16,\n2012) (No. 11-1125 J.A. 1159, 1162). There are 28 SRI units,\n\n    17\n        The Industry Petitioners also contend that the CISWI Rule\nfunctions as a form of injunctive relief in violation of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7413(a). That is incorrect. The provision is neither styled nor\noperated as a form of injunctive relief. Cf. 42 U.S.C. § 7413(a)\n(permitting the Administrator to issue, among other forms of relief,\n“an administrative penalty order” or “an order requiring [a person\nin violation of EPA regulations] to comply with such requirement\nor prohibition”).\n\f                              58\n\nall of which are located in Alaska, and the EPA had emissions\ndata for nine of them. Id. As explained supra § I.B.3, the\nEPA used the pollutant-by-pollutant approach to establish\nMACT emission standards for these units. For new-unit\nstandards, the EPA determined which of the nine units had the\nlowest emissions for a particular pollutant and set the MACT\nfloor for that pollutant at the level achieved by the identified\nunit. See 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2) (explaining that MACT\nfloors for new units must be set at “the emissions control that\nis achieved in practice by the best controlled similar unit”).\nWhen setting MACT floors for existing units, the EPA had to\ncalculate the average level of emissions achieved by the best\nperforming 12 per cent of units. See id. It therefore\ndetermined which four sources had the lowest emissions for a\ngiven pollutant and set the emissions standard for that\npollutant at the average level achieved by those four units.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners argue that the EPA’s approach\nwas unlawful because it failed to account for the unique role\nthat waste inputs play in emissions from SRIs. Unlike larger\nincinerators, SRIs burn small batches of waste at a time. Some\nbatches include cleaner waste, such as wood and cardboard,\nwhile others include waste, such as sewage, that generates\nlarge quantities of SO2 and other pollutants. Moreover,\nexisting SRIs cannot use certain “end-of-stack” control\ntechnologies like wet scrubbers due to the Alaskan climate.\nThe Industry Petitioners thus contend that emissions from\nSRIs are more closely tied to waste input than are emissions\nfrom other types of incinerators. This difference, they assert,\nrequired the EPA to take into account, when determining\nwhich SRI units were best performing for MACT floor\npurposes, the kind of waste an SRI unit was burning at the\ntime of testing. Because the Agency did not do so, the\n\f                              59\n\nIndustry Petitioners contend the MACT standards for SRIs are\narbitrary and capricious. We disagree.\n\n     To support their challenge, the Industry Petitioners\nadvance two arguments, neither of which has merit.\nPetitioners first point to section 7429(a)(3), which directs the\nEPA to base emission standards on “methods and\ntechnologies for removal or destruction of pollutants before,\nduring, or after combustion.” 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(3).\nAccording to the Industry Petitioners, this language requires\nthe EPA to identify best performing units for MACT purposes\nby considering which units are best at removing or destroying\npollutants. The Industry Petitioners assert that the Agency did\nnot do this. Instead, they contend, the EPA set standards\nwithout regard to whether that unit happened to be burning\ncleaner waste. And, according to the Industry Petitioners,\nremote incinerators in Alaska cannot control their waste\ninputs because the core purpose of SRIs is to burn waste that\nis impracticably far from municipal landfills. The fact that\nemissions levels varied dramatically during test runs for the\nSRI units, they claim, is thus the result of random variance in\nthe type of waste the unit was combusting, rather than any\n“method” or “technology” aimed at “removing” or\n“destroying” pollutants.\n\n     The EPA responds that the approach it adopted for SRIs\ncomplies with section 7429(a)(3) because “waste\nsegregation”—that is, diverting dirtier waste to landfills and\nburning only cleaner waste—is a “method . . . for removal . . .\nof pollutants before . . . combustion.”      See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7429(a)(3). In fact, during notice and comment, the EPA\nestimated that many SRIs would choose to comply with the\nMACT standards by segregating their waste instead of by\ninstalling expensive control technologies. See Jones Mem.\n\f                              60\n\nThe Agency also determined that waste segregation was\npossible for SRIs because their waste often contained\nmaterials that could be recycled. Id. Finally, the Agency\nfactored in any additional variance in emissions from these\nunits by calculating the MACT floors according to the UPL\nformula described at supra §§ I.B.1.a, IV.C. For these\nreasons, the Agency contends, it did not need to consider\nfurther any variation in emissions that might be caused by\ndifferences in waste inputs for SRIs.\n\n     The EPA has the better argument, based on both text and\nprecedent. Textually, waste segregation plainly can be a\n“method[]” for “removal” of pollutants “before” combustion.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(3). Accordingly, the EPA, when\nsetting MACT floors, could not have looked solely to\ntechnologies used to reduce emissions during combustion.\nAccord Sierra Club v. EPA (Sierra Club II), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186882\"><a href=\"/opinion/186882/sierra-club-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n883 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (per curiam). Instead, the plain\nlanguage of section 7429(a)(3) requires the Agency to\nconsider whether emission reductions can be achieved by\nnon-combustion-related controls such as using cleaner fuels\nor waste inputs. Accord id. The statute supports the approach\nthat the Agency took here.\n\n    Our holding in Sierra Club II confirms that our\nconclusion is correct.      In that case, the EPA had\nacknowledged that kilns emitted lower levels of pollutants\nwhen burning cleaner clay but nevertheless based MACT\nstandards only on the emission reductions achieved by control\ntechnology during the combustion process. Id. at 882. The\nAgency explained that clean clay existed only in certain areas\nand that transportation of the clay over long distances was\nimpractical. Id. The EPA therefore considered only those\nemission reductions that were attributable to “deliberate steps\n\f                              61\n\nkiln operators [took] to reduce emissions rather than to the\n‘happenstance’ of being located near cleaner clay.” Id. at\n883. But we rejected that approach, finding that “the Clean\nAir Act requires neither an intentional action nor a deliberate\nstrategy to reduce emissions.” Id. Instead, where “non-\ntechnology factors” affect emission levels, we held the EPA\nmust consider those effects when setting MACT floors. Id.\n\n     Applying that same reasoning, the EPA acted reasonably\nwhen it decided to consider the emissions reduction that could\nbe achieved by waste segregation in SRI units before\ncombustion.      This is true even if an element of\n“happenstance” plays into an SRI unit’s ability to segregate\nits waste. And, had the EPA instead determined that the best\nperformers were those SRI units that most effectively reduced\npollutants only during combustion, as the Industry Petitioners\nsuggest, the resulting MACT standards may have run afoul of\nour holding in Sierra Club II. We cannot, as a result, find the\nAgency’s choice to avoid that outcome unreasonable.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners’ second argument also comes up\nshort. According to Petitioners, the EPA selected the best\nperformers for SRIs merely because those units happened to\nbe burning batches of cleaner waste at the time of the\nemissions test. They claim this happenstance resulted in test\ndata that did not reasonably estimate the typical performance\nof the units, and thus misidentified the best performers. See\nCement Kiln, 255 F.3d at 862 (finding that although the EPA\nhas authority to estimate which units perform best, its\nmethodology must “provide[] an accurate picture of the\nrelevant sources’ actual performance”). Petitioners further\nargue that the Agency’s use of the UPL method to account for\nvariability did not fix this problem because the EPA applies\nthat method only after identifying the best performers.\n\f                             62\n\n    If the record supported this argument, it might well be\npersuasive; in NACWA, we accepted a similar contention that\nthe EPA’s dataset for determining MACT floors must fairly\nrepresent a unit’s typical performance. See 734 F.3d at 1146.\nBut the record here does not support the Industry Petitioners’\nposition. None of the evidence on which Petitioners rely can\nbear the weight they would have us place on it.\n\n    First, Petitioners cite evidence indicating that XTO\nEnergy, which operates the incinerator that the EPA deemed\nthe best performer for SO2, was burning low-sulfur “waste\nwood, cardboard, and oily waste” during the relevant test\nruns. See ConocoPhillips Co., Comment on EPA’s Proposed\nNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants,\nEPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0119 (Feb. 12, 2012) (No. 11-1125 J.A.\n1036). But the record does not show that the resulting test\ndata were unrepresentative of XTO’s typical performance\nbecause the record says nothing about what XTO typically\nburns. Id.\n\n     Second, Petitioners note that Drift River, the unit the\nEPA deemed the worst performer for SO2, had emissions\nresults similar to XTO Energy’s when burning low-sulfur\nwaste, but results over 1,000 times higher when burning high-\nsulfur waste. See id. (No. 11-1125 J.A. 1032-33). But again,\nthe record does not say anything about the type of waste Drift\nRiver typically burns or its sulfur content; it merely\ndemonstrates that the unit’s test results varied greatly from\none run to the next. See id.\n\n    Third, Petitioners point to additional test data they\nprovided for the Kuparuk unit, a source that met the EPA’s\nMACT standards for NOx. See id. (No. 11-1125 J.A. 1017,\n1027-28). They claim this data shows that the Kuparuk unit\n\f                              63\n\n“consistently” emits NOx levels exceeding that standard when\nburning sewage sludge. Id. This claim is both factually\nuntrue—as the data reveals exceedances on only one day—\nand says nothing about whether the test data that the EPA\nused was representative of Kuparuk’s typical performance.\nId.\n\n     Instead, the record supports the EPA’s assertion that it\ngave Petitioners “multiple opportunities” to present data on\nthe variability of waste streams for SRIs, but Petitioners never\nprovided a reasonable empirical basis upon which the Agency\ncould adjust the MACT standards due to this variability. The\nIndustry Petitioners have thus not met their burden to show\nthat the EPA’s test data was unrepresentative of SRI units’\nactual or typical performance.\n\n     In sum, no record evidence suggests that the current SRI\nemission standards are not achievable.           The Industry\nPetitioners instead offer only general statements about the\n“small batch” nature of SRIs and the difficulty of using waste\nsegregation or other controls in remote locations. These\nfactors alone do not call into question the EPA’s assertion that\ncontrols such as waste segregation and technology upgrades\nare a feasible means of achieving compliance with the MACT\nfloors that it established. See 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 15,730 (explaining that the MACT floors will require SRIs\nto employ “the best demonstrated technologies that are\ntechnologically feasible at these facilities,” such as\nafterburners and waste segregation, and noting that such\ncontrols “are sufficient to meet the MACT floor limits”). As\na result, the EPA’s action here was reasonable; the Agency\ndid not need to account further for waste stream variance in\nsetting MACT floor standards for these SRI units.\n\f                              64\n\n          F. CARBON MONOXIDE AS A SURROGATE\n\n     In setting MACT standards for major boilers, the EPA\nused carbon monoxide (CO) as a surrogate for several of the\nHAPs that the Agency was required to regulate. A surrogate\nis another chemical that stands in as a proxy for the regulated\nHAP when the EPA sets numeric emission standards. The\nEPA regulates the surrogate in order to regulate the HAP,\nsometimes because the HAP itself is too difficult to measure.\n\n    We have previously approved the use of surrogates where\nthe EPA’s choice of a surrogate for the HAP is “reasonable.”\nSee, e.g., Nat’l Lime Ass’n, 233 F.3d at 637. Here, the\nIndustry Petitioners claim the EPA’s use of CO as a surrogate\nwas not reasonable for a particular type of emissions—\norganic HAP emissions from coal-fired boilers—for two\nreasons. First, the EPA based the MACT standards on\ndatasets that contained numerous “non-detects” for these\norganic HAPs. Second, the Agency failed to explain why it\nused CO as a surrogate for major boilers, but used work-\npractice standards to regulate similar emissions from other\ntypes of boilers in another rule. We find no merit in either\nargument and, accordingly, deny this challenge.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners base their first argument on a\ndeficiency in the EPA’s dataset for coal-fired boilers’\nemissions—i.e., the dataset contained numerous “non-detects”\nfor organic HAP emissions. A test result is considered a\n“non-detect” when emissions testing returns a value below\nthat which the test methods are capable of detecting.\nAccording to the Industry Petitioners, multiple non-detects in\na dataset demonstrate that it is “not feasible” to set a numeric\nemission standard for the affected HAP. As a result, they\nargue, the EPA should have set work-practice standards for\n\f                              65\n\nthese HAPs under section 7412(h)(2), which permits the EPA\nto set such standards when it is “not feasible” to set a numeric\nemission standard. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(h)(2).\n\n     This argument fails because Petitioners have not\nexplained how the non-detects here made setting numeric\nemissions “not feasible,” as that term is defined in the CAA.\nThe CAA expresses a clear preference for MACT emission\nstandards and limits the EPA’s ability to fashion more flexible\nwork-practice standards.        Compare id. § 7412(d)(3)\n(providing that emission standards “shall not be less\nstringent” than the MACT floor), with id. § 7412(h)(1)\n(permitting work-practice standards only if MACT standards\nare “not feasible”). To set a work-practice standard for these\nemissions, in fact, the EPA would need to find that it is\ninfeasible to set a numeric standard for a particular HAP. Id.\n§ 7412(h)(1). And, as relevant here, the statute defines setting\na numeric standard as “not feasible” where “the application of\nmeasurement methodology to a particular class of sources is\nnot practicable due to technological and economic\nlimitations.” Id. § 7412(h)(2)(B).\n\n     This is a high bar and Petitioners have not demonstrated\nthat the non-detects they have identified meet it. During\nnotice and comment, the Agency reasonably explained that\nnon-detects are present in many of its datasets because they\nare inherent to the imprecision associated with measuring\nboiler emissions. See, e.g., 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,623. The EPA’s scientific conclusion that its data\nwas nevertheless sufficient to set numeric standards receives\nan “extreme degree of deference.” Kennecott Greens Creek\nMining Co. v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186855\"><a href=\"/opinion/186855/kennecott-greens-v-msha/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n954-55 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quotations omitted). And the\nIndustry Petitioners never explain here why the particular\n\f                               66\n\nlevel of non-detects found in this dataset nevertheless made a\nnumeric standard infeasible.           Although the Industry\nPetitioners point to several comments asserting that no coal-\nfired boiler could meet the current numeric standards in all\nHAP categories, these general comments say nothing about\nthe relevant question under the statute: whether it was feasible\nto establish numeric standards for organic HAP emissions in\nlight of the non-detects in the coal-fired boiler datasets.\n\n     We also reject the Industry Petitioners’ second argument\nthat the EPA needed to explain why it established work-\npractice standards for other types of boilers in the unrelated\n“Utility MATS” rule. We take an “every tub on its own\nbottom” approach to the EPA’s setting of emission standards\npursuant to the CAA. Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 986. The\nadequacy of the underlying justification offered by the\nAgency is what matters in an arbitrary-and-capricious\nreview—not what the Agency did on a different record\nconcerning a different industry. Id. As a result, we cannot\nfind that it was unreasonable for the EPA to use CO as a\nsurrogate in setting numeric standards for coal-fired boilers on\nthis basis. Nor can we find that the EPA was required on\nreconsideration to explain the discrepancy between its\napproach to organic HAP emissions in these two rules, as\nPetitioners assert. See id. at 987 (“EPA could have noted\nwhere the bases for its decision in this case differed from\nthose with respect to other decisions in other cases, as was\ndone in the EPA’s brief to this court . . . but such explanations\nare not required given the different contexts of the various\nrulemakings.”).\n\f                              67\n\n   G. HEALTH-BASED EMISSIONS LIMITATION FOR HCL\n\n     In the Major Boiler Rule, the EPA chose not to exercise\nits discretion to create more lenient emission standards for\nhydrogen chloride (HCl) based on health. The Industry\nPetitioners challenge this decision as arbitrary and capricious\nbecause, they claim, the Agency considered impermissible\nfactors in reaching the decision and departed from its previous\nposition without adequate justification. We disagree and hold\nthe EPA reasonably chose not to establish a health-based\nemissions limitation for HCl.\n\n      The EPA generally must establish emission standards for\nall listed pollutants emitted from a source category based on\nwhat the best performing similar sources have achieved, i.e.,\nthe MACT floor. The Agency, however, may consider\nadopting alternative health-based emission standards—which\nare more lenient—for pollutants with an established health\nthreshold. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(4). The statutory\nlanguage permitting these alternative standards is\ndiscretionary, providing that “[w]ith respect to pollutants for\nwhich a health threshold has been established, the\nAdministrator may consider such threshold level, with an\nample margin of safety, when establishing emission standards\nunder this subsection.” Id. (emphasis added). But, even if the\nEPA considers, in its discretion, a health-based emission\nstandard, the statutory text nowhere requires that the EPA\nadopt a more lenient standard than the MACT floor. This\nprovision thus allows, but does not require, the EPA to adopt\na standard more lenient than the MACT floor, subject to two\ncritical restrictions: the Agency must determine (1) that there\nis an established health threshold, and (2) that the established\nthreshold would provide “an ample margin of safety.”\n\f                              68\n\n     Using this authority, the EPA considered and adopted\nhealth-based emission standards for HCl in an earlier\nrulemaking for major boilers. See 2004 Boilers Rule, 69 Fed.\nReg. at 55,240-41. At the time, the Agency based its decision\non three key findings: a health threshold was established for\nHCl, adverse health effects were unlikely at emissions below\nthat level, and low HCl emissions from major source boilers\nmade HCl a “particularly well-suited” candidate for more\nlenient standards. Id. at 55,241. The EPA also said, however,\nthat it was not embracing a general policy for HCl, but would\ninstead “undertake in each individual rule to determine\nwhether it is appropriate to exercise [the Agency’s]\ndiscretion” to adopt such standards. Id. We later vacated that\nrule without considering the merits of the EPA’s HCl\ndecision. See NRDC I, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"798072\"><a href=\"/opinion/798072/natural-resources-defense-council-sierra-club-environmental-integrity/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n     The EPA again chose to consider a health-based standard\nfor HCl in the current rulemaking, but this time declined to set\nsuch a standard. 2010 Major Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at\n32,030. The EPA explained that it continued to interpret its\nauthority under section 7412(d)(4) to require that it find a\nhealth threshold exists, with an ample margin of safety, before\nusing its discretion to depart from an established MACT floor.\nId. The Agency reasoned further that, even if it made a\nfinding that a health threshold exists, the discretionary nature\nof the authority allowed it to weigh additional factors when\nchoosing whether to adopt the more lenient health-based\nstandard. Id. Those factors included: the potential for\ncumulative adverse health effects due to concurrent exposure\nto other HAPs or emissions from other nearby sources;\npotential impacts of increased emissions on ecosystems; and\nreductions in emissions of other pollutants, also known as\n“co-benefits,” achieved through enforcement of the HCl\nMACT floor. Id. at 32,030-31.\n\f                              69\n\n     Applying this interpretation, the EPA suggested in its\nproposed rule that a health-based standard for HCl might not\nbe appropriate because these additional health and\nenvironmental considerations cautioned against a more lenient\nemission standard. Id. at 32,031. The Agency acknowledged,\nin particular, that its decision in the 2004 rule was based on\ndata that considered only the chronic respiratory effects of\nHCl exposure. Id. While affirming the validity of those\nfindings, the EPA explained that those chronic impact studies\ndid not consider the additional variables it had now identified,\nnor did it consider the potential acute or carcinogenic effects\nthat might be caused by HCl exposure. Id. And, because of\nthese potential (though unproven) risks, the Agency resolved\nthat it currently lacked sufficient information to establish an\nHCl emission standard that would protect health with an\nample margin of safety. Id. It thus requested additional data\nfrom stakeholders and the regulated community to help\naddress its concerns, including information regarding the\npotential cumulative effects of HCl emissions from boilers\nand other nearby sources. Id.\n\n     After receiving numerous comments on the issue, the\nEPA declined to set a health-based standard in the final rule\nfor two primary reasons: (1) the comments had not provided\nsufficient data on potential cumulative health and\nenvironmental effects caused by HCl emissions from boilers\nand other nearby sources; and (2) the comments affirmed the\npotential co-benefits that limiting HCl emissions might have\nin lowering emissions of other HAP and non-HAP pollutants.\n2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,643-44.\nAccording to the EPA, its consideration of these co-benefits\nwas not a regulation of other pollutants; rather, it was simply\nchoosing not to ignore the purpose of the CAA—to reduce the\nnegative health and environmental effects of HAP\n\f                              70\n\nemissions—when exercising its discretionary authority under\nthe Act. Id. at 15,644.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners contend that the EPA’s\nconsideration of the broad potential health and environmental\nimpacts of HCl rendered the Agency’s decision arbitrary and\ncapricious. In particular, they argue that the Agency based its\ndecision on two impermissible factors that were not supported\nby the record: (1) the potential cumulative effects of\nemissions from boilers and other nearby sources, and (2) the\nco-benefits of setting a more stringent MACT floor standard\nfor HCl. We disagree on both counts.\n\n     The statutory text and purpose of section 7412(d)(4)\namply support the Agency’s decision to consider potential\ncumulative risks associated with emissions from boilers and\nother nearby sources. Although other CAA provisions require\nthe EPA to set emission standards based on the emissions\nfrom a particular source, section 7412(d)(4)’s plain language\nis not focused on emissions from any particular source.\nCompare 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(3) (instructing the EPA to set\nemission standards for sources at the level achieved in\npractice by the best controlled similar source), with id.\n§ 7412(d)(4) (containing no mention of emissions from a\nparticular source).      The EPA’s consideration of the\ncumulative impacts from these emissions is also relevant to\nthe Agency’s statutory mandate to ensure that a health\nthreshold would protect health with an “ample margin of\nsafety.” As such, the Agency had discretion to consider the\npotential risks associated with the cumulative emissions of\nboilers and other nearby sources under this provision.\n\n    The EPA was likewise free to consider potential co-\nbenefits that might be achieved from enforcing the HCl\n\f                             71\n\nMACT floor. Section 7412(d)(4)’s text does not foreclose the\nAgency from considering co-benefits and doing so is\nconsistent with the CAA’s purpose—to reduce the health and\nenvironmental impacts of hazardous air pollutants. The\nAgency was under no obligation to ignore the CAA’s purpose\nin making a final decision on whether to exercise a\ndiscretionary authority.\n\n     The Industry Petitioners attempt to refute this\nstraightforward conclusion by pointing to “restrictions” in\nanother provision, section 7412(d)(2). No. 11-1108 Indus.\nPet’rs’ Br. 55-56. This provision requires the EPA to\nconsider costs, non-air quality health and environmental\nimpacts, and energy requirements in setting maximum\nachievable emission standards. Petitioners contend that these\nsame “restrictions” must be read into section 7412(d)(4). But,\neven if we assume Petitioners are correct that these factors\nrestrict the Agency’s ability to consider other factors under\nsection 7412(d)(2), that provision furthers the statute’s\ncommand to set the strictest possible emission standards\nabove what has already been achieved (i.e., the MACT\nfloors). Section 7412(d)(4), by contrast, is a permissive\nauthority for the EPA to abandon already achieved emission\nstandards. We do not read limits on the EPA’s authority to\nset more stringent standards into a provision laying out the\nEPA’s authority to set more lenient standards. If anything,\nthe difference between the provisions cuts the other way.\nSection 7412(d)(4) does not specify the factors that\nPetitioners argue for, while section 7412(d)(2) does. This\ndifference shows that Congress knew how to provide such\nlimits where it found them necessary. We thus find no basis\nto conclude that the EPA could not consider potential\ncumulative effects or co-benefits in rejecting a more lenient\nhealth-based HCl standard.\n\f                              72\n\n     Finally, the Industry Petitioners claim that the EPA’s\ndecision was arbitrary because the Agency failed to support\nits reversal from the 2004 rule, in which it set health-based\nemission standards for HCl. Because the EPA changed its\nposition, the Petitioners contend that the Agency had to\npresent factual support for its decision to disregard the facts\nand circumstances that underlay its prior adoption of a health-\nbased HCl standard. See FCC v. Fox Television Stations,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145882\"><a href=\"/opinion/145882/fcc-v-fox-television-stations-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516 (2009). The Agency failed to do this,\nPetitioners say, because it relied on a data gap regarding the\npotential cumulative effects of HCl exposure. But this\nargument fares no better than Petitioners’ first.\n\n     At the outset, Petitioners misstate the EPA’s burden to\njustify its change in policy. Although an agency does not\ngenerally need to provide a more substantial explanation or\nreason for a policy change than for any other action, it must\ndo so where “its new policy rests upon factual findings that\ncontradict those which underlay its prior policy.” Id. at 515.\nIn that circumstance, “it is not that further justification is\ndemanded by the mere fact of policy change; but that a\nreasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and\ncircumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior\npolicy.” Id. at 515-16. The EPA, therefore, was not required\nto refute the factual underpinnings of its prior policy with new\nfactual data. The Agency only needed to provide a reasoned\nexplanation for discounting the importance of the facts that it\nhad previously relied upon. Id.\n\n    The EPA did so here by explaining that its prior decision\nfocused too narrowly on the chronic respiratory effects of HCl\nemissions without considering the broader implications of\nsuch emissions on health and environmental conditions. See\n2010 Proposed Major Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,030-\n\f                              73\n\n31. In so doing, the EPA neither contradicted nor abandoned\nthe factual findings it made in its earlier rulemaking. It\ninstead acknowledged that those findings were more limited\nthan what it now considered necessary to justify the exercise\nof its discretion to set a health-based standard. Id. For\nexample, the Agency noted that: (1) little research had been\ndone on HCl’s carcinogenicity or on the toxicity of mixtures\nof HCl and other respiratory irritants emitted from boilers;\nand (2) the Agency had no data about peak short-term\nemissions of HCl from major boilers that might create risks of\nacute exposure. Id.\n\n     These enumerated concerns were sufficient to support the\nAgency’s decision not to adopt a health-based standard.\nSection 7412(d)(4) does not require that the EPA present\naffirmative factual data to reject a health-based standard. The\nprovision requires just the opposite: in order to impose a\nhealth-based standard, the Agency must find that a health\nthreshold can be set that provides an ample margin of safety.\nThe EPA here determined that it could not do so, in part\nbecause it lacked relevant data like that discussed above.\n2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,643-44. In other\nwords, the EPA could not determine that any health threshold\nwould provide an ample margin of safety to protect health.\nWithout such a finding, the EPA could not invoke its\ndiscretionary authority under the statute. Id. There was thus\nnothing impermissible in the EPA’s reliance on a lack of data\nin rejecting a more lenient health-based standard. The EPA’s\ndecision not to adopt health-based emission standards for HCl\nwas not arbitrary and capricious.\n\f                               74\n\n  H. EMISSIONS AVERAGING OF MULTIPLE CISWI UNITS\n                  IN ONE FACILITY\n\n     Certain industry entities urged the EPA to allow facilities\nwith more than one CISWI unit to demonstrate MACT\ncompliance by showing that the average HAP emissions\nacross all units at that location fell under the relevant cap.\nThey pointed to the EPA’s allowance of emissions averaging\nin the Major Boilers Rule but the Agency defended its\ndisparate treatment because, in its view, “[t]he applicability of\nCISWI is such that each unit is an affected facility.” See 2011\nProposed CISWI Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n80,463. It subsequently elaborated that it did “not believe [it\nhas] the legal authority to allow emissions averaging in\nCISWI or under section [7429] generally because each\nindividual unit is an affected facility.” CISWI Rule—\nResponses to Comments, at 195-96. The Industry Petitioners\nchallenge the disallowance of facility-wide averaging for\nCISWIs, arguing that “unit” cannot mean “facility” because\nsection 7429(g)(1) defines “solid waste incineration unit” as\n“a distinct operating unit of any facility” and therefore the\nEPA’s rule fails Chevron step 1. They also argue the EPA’s\nconflation of “unit” and “facility” is unreasonable, and thus\nviolates Chevron step 2, because the EPA has allowed\nemissions averaging in a different section 7429 rule and in a\nnumber of section 7412 rules.\n\n     Although the Industry Petitioners’ point is well taken—\nthe plain terms of the CAA foreclose the EPA’s conflation of\na CISWI “unit” and “affected facility,” see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7429(g)(1) (“facility” is comprised of “units”)—we agree\nthat the EPA has no statutory authority to allow emissions\n\f                                 75\n\naveraging under section 7429.18 Section 7429 requires the\nEPA to regulate emissions from all “solid waste incineration\nunits,” 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2); see also id. § 7429(a)(4), and\nthe CAA defines a “solid waste incinerator unit” as “a distinct\noperating unit” of a “facility,” id. § 7429(g)(1) (emphasis\nadded). In other words, because the CAA mandates that the\nEPA regulate each “distinct” CISWI unit in a “facility,” the\nEPA cannot allow emissions averaging of all CISWI units in\na facility. See id.\n\n     For this reason, the Industry Petitioners’ Chevron\nchallenge fails, notwithstanding the EPA’s minimal\nexplanation set forth in its proposed CISWI Rule. It is\naxiomatic that an agency must “articulate[] an adequate\nexplanation for its action,” Int’l Fabricare Inst. v.

And\nbecause the EPA has no authority under section 7429 to allow\nemissions averaging of multiple CISWI units in one facility,\nthe Petitioners’ Chevron argument does not carry the day.19\n\n\n     18\n         The EPA does have statutory authority under section 7412\nto allow facility-wide emissions averaging in the Major Boilers\nRule. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(a)(1) (“major source[s]” defined as\n“any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within\na contiguous area and under common control” (emphasis added));\nsee also id. § 7411(a)(3) (“stationary source” defined as “any\nbuilding, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit\nany air pollutant”).\n     19\n       The EPA concedes that it once allowed, in a different rule,\nemissions averaging for units subject to section 7429 but has since\nconcluded that it does not have the statutory authority to do so.\nAlthough the Industry Petitioners argue that the Agency arbitrarily\n\f                                76\n\n        IV. ENVIRONMENTAL PETITIONERS’\n                  CHALLENGES\n\n          A. CARBON MONOXIDE AS A SURROGATE\n\n      As explained at supra §§ I.B.1 and III.F, the EPA used\ncarbon monoxide (CO) as a surrogate for several non-\ndioxin/furan organic HAPs when the Agency set the MACT\nfloors for major boilers. In support of this approach, the EPA\nfound that both CO and these HAPs were the products of\n“incomplete combustion.” 2010 Proposed Major Boilers\nRule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,018. The Agency concluded as a\nresult that CO was a reasonable surrogate because:\n(1) minimizing CO emissions would minimize these HAPs;\n(2) methods used for the control of these HAP emissions\nwould be the same methods used to control CO emissions\n(i.e., good combustion or using an oxidation catalyst);\n(3) standards limiting CO emissions would result in decreases\nin these HAP emissions; and (4) establishing emission limits\nfor individual organic HAPs would be impractical and costly.\nId. Although several commenters challenged aspects of this\nreasoning, the EPA ultimately stuck with its decision to use\nCO as a surrogate for non-dioxin/furan organic HAP\nemissions, without further explanation, in the final Major\nBoilers Rule. See 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at\n7,145 (explaining the EPA was denying Sierra Club’s petition\nto reconsider the suitability of CO as a surrogate for non-\norganic HAPs based on the reasoning provided by the Agency\nin the 2010 proposed rule).\n\n\nchanged its position, the fact that the EPA may have acted outside\nits authority in a rule is not at issue here. “[P]revious statutory\nviolations,” of course, “cannot excuse” new ones. New Jersey v.\nEPA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\f                              77\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners challenge this decision,\narguing that the EPA has not adequately explained how\nsetting emission standards for CO will accomplish what the\nstatute plainly requires: that the EPA set emission standards\nfor organic HAPs at the average level achieved by the best\nperformers with regard to those HAPs. We agree and remand\nto the EPA to adequately explain how CO acts as a reasonable\nsurrogate for non-dioxin/furan organic HAPs. We do not,\nhowever, vacate the current emission standards because we\nconclude that the Agency will likely be able to adequately\nexplain its decision on remand and that vacatur would prove\nsubstantially disruptive.\n\n     The EPA may use a surrogate to regulate HAPs under\nsection 7412 where “reasonable.” See, e.g., Nat’l Lime Ass’n,\n233 F.3d at 637. To be reasonable, the emission standard set\nfor the surrogate must reflect what the best source or best 12\nper cent of sources in the relevant subcategory achieved with\nregard to the HAP. See Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 984. This\nrequires the surrogate’s emissions to share a close relationship\nwith the emissions of the HAP. Id. One crucial factor we\nhave identified for determining whether that close relationship\nexists is the availability of alternative control technologies.\nSee id. at 985. These technologies regulate the HAP without\nimpacting a surrogate’s emissions, or regulate the surrogate\nwithout impacting the HAP. Id. As we have explained, the\nimportance of this factor to our reasonableness analysis “is\nclear: if EPA looks only to [the surrogate], but HAPs are\nreduced [in another] way that does not reduce [the surrogate],\nthe best achieving sources, and what they can achieve with\nrespect to HAPs, might not be properly identified.” Id.\n\n    In the Major Boilers Rule, the EPA proposed using CO as\na surrogate because, as relevant here: (1) the lowest possible\n\f                             78\n\nCO emissions resulted in the lowest possible HAP emissions,\nand (2) the same combustion and oxidation control methods\nreduce both types of emissions. See 2010 Proposed Major\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,018. But, during notice and\ncomment, the EPA failed to directly consider and respond to\nseveral comments that introduced evidence suggesting that\nother control technologies and methods could be effectively\nused to reduce HAP emissions without also impacting CO\nemissions, or vice versa. See, e.g., Inst. of Clean Air Cos.,\nComments on National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air\nPollutants for Major Sources, EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0058\n(Aug. 23, 2010), at 20-21 (No. 11-1108 J.A. 822-23);\nResponses to Public Comments on EPA’s National Emission\nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources,\nvol. 2, EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0058 (Feb. 2011) (No. 11-1108\nJ.A. 1033, 1035-36, 1049-52). The EPA ultimately decided to\nuse CO as a surrogate for all non-dioxin/furan organic HAPs\nin its final rule without ever addressing whether such\nalternative control technologies and methods might be used to\nlower organic HAP emissions further. See 2011 Major\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,654; 2013 Major Boilers\nRule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,138. Instead, the Agency responded\nby doubling down on its assertion that both CO and organic\nHAP emissions were the product of poor combustion and, as a\nresult, optimal combustion would minimize the emissions of\nboth CO and non-dioxin/furan organic HAPs. 2013 Major\nBoilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,145. But this response was no\nresponse at all to the substantial concerns raised in the\ncomments that other variables might also affect emissions.\n\n     Although we afford an agency’s scientific decision “an\nextreme degree of deference,” see Kennecott Greens, 476\nF.3d at 954-55 (quoting Hüls Am., Inc. v. Browner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718186\"><a href=\"/opinion/718186/huls-america-inc-v-carol-m-browner-administrator-and-the-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 452 (D.C.

Cir. 1995).\nThe EPA could not conclude that CO acts as a reasonable\nsurrogate in this statutory context without at least considering\na key factor: whether the best performing boilers might be\nusing alternative control technologies and methods that\nreduce organic HAP emissions beyond what they achieve by\nregulating CO alone. See Sierra Club I, 353 F.3d at 985. We\ntherefore reject the EPA’s contention that its reason for using\nCO as a surrogate—that good combustion would minimize\nboth CO and non-dioxin/furan organic HAP emissions—was\nalone sufficient to support its decision.\n\n     We recognize that there might be a context where a\nsurrogate’s use is reasonable despite the presence of\nalternative control methods or technologies, but the Agency\ndoes not explain why it did not need to even consider whether\nsuch methods might further reduce HAPs here. For example,\nif the EPA used a surrogate that was closely correlated to the\nHAP and set surrogacy emission standards at a level that\nwould eliminate HAP emissions altogether, the Agency might\nnot need to account for alternative control technologies in its\nfinal rule. In that case, the use of the surrogate would not call\ninto question whether the Agency had regulated the HAP as\nrequired by the statute because, after all, nothing is better than\neliminating HAP emissions entirely. But the Agency offers\nus no analogous explanation or supportive data here.\nAlthough it is possible that all of the challenged CO emission\nstandards are in fact set at such a level, the Agency has not\ndefended the rule on such reasoning. Indeed, the Agency\nfailed to consider or even comment directly on this issue,\nincluding whether certain post-combustion processes might\nincrease organic HAP emissions without a corresponding\n\f                             80\n\nincrease in CO emissions.      We cannot ignore such an\noversight in this context.\n\n     We reject, however, the Environmental Petitioners’ other\nargument that combustion-related issues preclude the EPA\nfrom using CO as a surrogate for non-dioxin/furan organic\nHAPs. The Petitioners contend that the EPA’s decision to use\nCO was arbitrary because record evidence demonstrated a\nbreakdown in the correlation between CO and organic HAP\nemissions at CO emission levels below 130 parts per million\n(ppm). But the EPA explained that this apparent breakdown\nwas most likely caused by the difficulty of measuring the\nregulated HAP at such extremely low emission levels, rather\nthan by a flaw in the correlation between CO and organic\nHAPs. 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,144-45;\nMemorandum from Eastern Research Group, Inc. to Jim\nEddinger, EPA, Revised MACT Floor Analysis for the\nIndustrial, Commerical, and Institutional Boilers and Process\nHeaters National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air\nPollutants—Major Source (2012 MACT Floor Memorandum)\n(Aug. 2012), at 11-12 (No. 11-1108 J.A. 1462-63). This is\nprecisely the sort of scientific judgment to which we must\ndefer and accordingly, we do so on this point. See Kennecott\nGreens, 476 F.3d at 954-55. The Environmental Petitioners\nfail to provide any reason to believe that organic HAP\nemissions can, in fact, be accurately measured at such low\nlevels. And the Agency’s explanation also addresses why the\nEPA discounted record evidence regarding extremely high\nburn temperatures that demonstrated a potential breakdown in\nthe CO and organic HAP relationship as HAP emissions\napproached zero.\n\n    Still, the EPA’s failure to address substantial record\nevidence on the potential availability of alternative control\n\f                               81\n\ntechnologies or methods rendered the Agency’s use of CO as\na surrogate for certain organic HAPs arbitrary and capricious.\nWe thus remand the portion of the Major Boilers Rule\nproviding for CO’s use as a surrogate for non-dioxin/furan\norganic HAPs to the Agency for further consideration. We do\nnot, however, vacate the current emission standards based on\nCO’s use as a surrogate. We may remand without vacatur\nwhere there is a likelihood of (1) cure on remand, and (2) a\nsubstantial disruptive effect that would result from vacatur.\nSee Heartland Reg’l Med. Ctr. v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187369\"><a href=\"/opinion/187369/heartland-regional-medical-center-v-sebelius/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197-\n98 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Here, vacatur would cause substantial\ndisruptive effects by removing emission limits for the\nregulated HAPs. And it is likely that the EPA will be able to\nadequately explain its use of CO on remand after properly\nconsidering the matter. As a result, we decline to vacate the\ncurrent standards in the interim.\n\nB. EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN UNITS FROM MACT ANALYSIS\n\n     In the Major Boilers Rule, the EPA created subcategories\nbased primarily on the fuel combusted. See 2013 Major\nBoilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,142. To qualify for certain\nsubcategories, the EPA required that a source burn a fuel\nmixture comprised of only 10 per cent of the subcategory-\ndefining fuel. See, e.g., id. at 7,193 (“Unit designed to burn\nsolid fuel subcategory means any boiler . . . that burns . . . at\nleast 10 percent solid fuel . . . in combination with liquid fuels\nor gaseous fuels.” (emphasis added)). Notwithstanding the\nlow bar for inclusion, we conclude, and discuss at greater\nlength below, see infra § IV.J, that the EPA reasonably\nexercised its discretion when it subcategorized boilers this\nway.\n\f                             82\n\n     We cannot say the same about the EPA’s exclusion of\ncertain high-performing units from its MACT-floor\ncalculation. Although the EPA allowed sources that combust\nonly 10 per cent of a subcategory-defining fuel to join that\nsubcategory, it declined to consider emissions from any\nsource that burned less than 90 per cent of the subcategory-\ndefining fuel when determining the average emissions level of\nthe best performing sources in setting MACT floors for\nexisting sources. And when it set a subcategory’s MACT\nfloors for new sources, the Agency declined to consider the\nemissions levels from any source that did not burn 100\nper cent of the fuel. This disparate treatment makes a\ndifference; several sources excluded from the MACT-floor\ndetermination were among the best performing sources (or, in\nsome cases, the single best performing source) in that fuel-\nbased subcategory.\n\n     The CAA, however, demands that source subcategories\ntake the bitter with the sweet. Section 7412 mandates,\nwithout ambiguity, that the EPA set the MACT floor at the\nlevel achieved by the best performing source, or the average\nof the best performing sources, in a subcategory. See 42\nU.S.C. § 7412(d)(3)(A), (B). It thus follows that if the EPA\nincludes a source in a subcategory, it must take into account\nthat source’s emissions levels in setting the MACT floor.\n\n     The Agency, however, claims discretion to omit from\nMACT-floor computation sources it considers dissimilar. In\nsupport, it cites section 7412(d)(3), which provides that\nMACT standards must be no less stringent than “the best\ncontrolled similar source, as determined by the [EPA].” Id.\n§ 7412(d)(3) (emphases added). Our decision in Sierra Club\nII, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186882\"><a href=\"/opinion/186882/sierra-club-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, however, forecloses this argument. In\nSierra Club II, the EPA set MACT standards for brick and\n\f                               83\n\nceramic kilns. Id. at 879. For some subcategories, the EPA\nbased its MACT-floor determination on “the pollution control\ndevices used by the second-best performers,” not the best\nperformers. Id. (emphasis added). Although the EPA argued\nthat it “reasonably construe[d] the term ‘best performing’ . . .\nto allow it to consider whether retrofitting kilns with a\nparticular pollution control technology is technically\nfeasible,” id. at 880 (alterations in original), we held that the\nEPA could not circumvent the requirement that it base the\nMACT floor “on the emission level actually achieved by the\nbest performers (those with the lowest emission levels).” Id.\nat 880-81 (citing Cement Kiln, 255 F.3d at 861) (emphasis in\noriginal). We reach the same conclusion here.\n\n     The EPA tries to distinguish Sierra Club II, arguing that\nthe issue in that case “was whether [the] EPA could exclude\nall units using the most-effective emission control technique\nbecause it might not be applicable to all existing units”;\nhowever, “[h]ere, [the] EPA is excluding a test result that is\nunrepresentative of typical operations of units in the\nsubcategory, and thus is inappropriate to use in establishing\nthe MACT floor.” No. 11-1108 EPA Br. 81. But it makes no\ndifference whether the EPA exempts from consideration units\nwith certain highly effective technology or units with\nimpressive test results driven by the fuel combination it\ncombusts. Either approach contravenes our holding in Sierra\nClub II that the EPA cannot ignore “the emission level\nactually achieved by the best performers (those with the\nlowest emission levels)” in the subcategory. 479 F.3d at 880\n(emphasis omitted). In any event, the EPA has not simply\nexcluded aberrant test results; it has excluded an entire class\nof units—those burning less than 90 per cent of the\nsubcategory’s fuel—even though every one of those units fits\n\f                                84\n\nthe subcategory’s parameters. This is no different from what\nwe rejected in Sierra Club II.\n\n     The EPA insists that if a source is “unrepresentative of\ntypical operations of units in the subcategory,” it is\n“inappropriate to use [it] in establishing the MACT floor.”\nNo. 11-1108 EPA Br. 81. Not so. “The idea is to set limits\nthat, as an initial matter, require all sources in a category to at\nleast clean up their emissions to the level that their best\nperforming peers have shown can be achieved.” Sierra Club\nI, 353 F.3d at 980 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(3)). For this\nreason, an unusually high-performing source should be\nconsidered; indeed its performance suggests that a more\nstringent MACT standard is appropriate. Accordingly, we\nvacate the MACT standards for all major boiler subcategories\nthat would have been affected had the EPA considered all\nsources included in the subcategories.20\n\n                 C. UPPER PREDICTION LIMIT\n\n     Sections 7412 and 7429 create MACT-floor criteria that,\nfor our purpose, are materially the same. Compare 42 U.S.C.\n\n    20\n          In its brief, the EPA argued that the Environmental\nPetitioners’ challenge was moot either because the challenged\nMACT standards had been remanded for other reasons or because\ninclusion of the allegedly dissimilar sources would not have\naffected the MACT standard. During oral argument, however, it\nconceded that it misunderstood the scope of the Petitioners’\nargument, which argument challenges unremanded MACT\nstandards that have in fact been affected by the EPA’s decision to\nomit certain high-performing sources from its MACT-floor\nanalysis. See Oral Arg. Recording pt. B at 48:28-49:22. We\nbelieve that the Environmental Petitioners’ challenge is not moot\nand has not been waived.\n\f                               85\n\n§ 7412(d), with id. § 7429(a)(2). In both provisions, the CAA\nmandates that MACT floors have maximum stringency but\nalso be continuously achievable. See id. § 7412(d)(2), (k); id.\n§ 7429(a)(2); id. § 7602(k). Satisfying the statutory criteria is\nno easy task, especially because no source emits any HAPs at\na constant level. See Page Mem. 6. Rather, emissions levels\nfluctuate over time and for many reasons. See id. at 3.21 We\nhave held, see Mossville Envtl. Action Now v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186224\"><a href=\"/opinion/186224/mossville-env-actn-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1242 (D.C.

Virtually all of the data the EPA\ncollects to set MACT floors come from the three-run stack\ntest. Page Mem. 6. The three-run stack test, as the name\nsuggests, involves three measurements of the source’s\nemissions taken over a short time period (i.e., no more than a\nfew days) with each of the three test “runs” lasting from one\nhour to four hours. Id. at 3. Because the tests provide three\n“snapshots” of a source’s emissions performance, they cannot\naccurately represent the source’s full range of emissions over\nall times and under all conditions.

NACWA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">734</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2013)\n\n     Based on the limitations inherent in stack testing, the\nEPA concluded that it could not set MACT floors based on\nthat testing alone. It began using the UPL to account for the\nHAPs-emissions variety that stack-testing data do not reflect.\nSee NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1122. The Agency did so in several\nrules promulgated in 2011, including not only the Major\nBoilers Rule and the CISWI Rule but also the Sewage Sludge\nIncinerator Rule addressed in NACWA. See id. In that case,\nthe petitioners challenged the EPA’s UPL use, arguing that\nthe Agency failed to establish that the UPL fairly represented\nthe “average emissions limitation achieved” by the best\nperforming sources to set the Sewage Sludge Incinerator\nMACT floors and, accordingly, was “unlawful and arbitrary.”\nId. at 1130. We agreed in part. See id. at 1119.\n\n     Specifically, we struggled to pin down the EPA’s precise\ninterpretation of the phrase “average emissions limitation\nachieved by the best performing 12 percent of units.” Id. at\n1142-43 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2)).23 As best we\ncould tell, the EPA defended its use of the UPL as follows:\n“[b]ecause the [UPL] represents the value which [the EPA]\n\n    22\n        See also Page Mem. 5 (“[E]ven single three run tests, which\nare performed over a short period of time, typically show different\nemissions levels during each individual test run.”).\n    23\n         See also NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1142 (“[I]t seems EPA has\nadopted yet another interpretation of the phrase ‘average emissions\nlimitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of units.’”\n(emphasis added)).\n\f                                 87\n\ncan expect the mean (i.e., average) of three future\nobservations (3-run average) to fall below, based upon the\nresults of the independent sample size from the same\npopulation, the [UPL] reflects average emissions.” Id. at\n1142 (quoting Standards of Performance for New Stationary\nSources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources:\nSewage Sludge Incineration Units, 76 Fed. Reg. 15,372,\n15,389 (Mar. 21, 2011)) (emphasis added) (some alteration in\noriginal). In our view, however, “the word ‘average’ . . .\nseems to mean the average emissions limitation that the\nexisting population of the best-performing 12 percent of\nincinerators has achieved.” Id. (emphases added).\n\n     Despite these doubts, we reasoned that the EPA could\nhave “plausibl[y]” concluded that the UPL represents the\n“average emissions limitation achieved” by the best\nperforming sources. Id. at 1143. That said, we were not\nwilling to assume the EPA’s responsibility of “supply[ing] a\nreasoned basis” for its UPL use. Id. (quoting Bowman\nTransp., Inc. v.

For that reason, we remanded—but did not vacate,\nsee id. at 1161—the UPL portion of the Sewage Sludge\nIncinerator Rule and ordered the EPA to “clarify how the\n[UPL] represents the average emissions limitation achieved\nby the best performing 12 percent.” Id. at 1143 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).24\n\n\n\n    24\n         See also NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1151 (“[W]hile we determine\nthat [the] EPA’s use of the [UPL] may be lawful, we are remanding\nthis portion of its rulemaking for further explanation on the issue[]\nof how the upper prediction limit represents the average emissions\nlimitation achieved . . . .” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f                                  88\n\n     Because the EPA also used the UPL in the Major Boilers\nRule and the CISWI Rule, the Agency moved for a limited\nremand of the current petitions so that it could include its\nrevised UPL explanation in the administrative records of these\ntwo regulations.25 See Page Mem. 2. On July 14, 2014, the\nEPA published a fifteen-page memorandum authored by\nStephen D. Page, the EPA Director of Air Quality Planning\nand Standards (Page Memorandum), in response to NACWA.\nSee id. at 1. The EPA’s current explication of the UPL is now\nbefore us.26\n\n\n     25\n         In NACWA, we had other problems with the EPA’s use of\nthe UPL. Specifically, the EPA had explained that “a smaller\ndataset may have greater variability, and thus a higher [UPL].”\nNACWA, 734 F.3d at 1144. We instructed the EPA not only to\nexplain its use of the UPL in general but also to “explain why the\n[UPL] could still be considered accurate given a small dataset” in\nparticular. Id. at 1144-45 (emphasis added). In its remand motion,\nthe EPA represented that it could “adequately explain why [its] use\nof the UPL in general is consistent with Clean Air Act requirements\nthrough a remand of the record for a limited time” but that “the\nquestion of whether the UPL is an appropriate statistical method for\nsmall data sets requires more analysis . . . [along with] additional\nnotice and comment rulemaking.” No. 11-1108 Mot. for Remand\n9, 13 (Feb. 28, 2014). We agreed and, for this reason, the only\nissue we decide today is whether the EPA carried its burden of\nestablishing, as a general matter, that the UPL reasonably estimates\nthe average emissions level achieved by the best performing source\nor sources to set MACT floors.\n     26\n         The Environmental Petitioners urge us to ignore the Page\nMemorandum, insisting that it “provide[s] a series of new\ninterpretations and assertions that, rather than ‘explaining’ the prior\nrecord, instead contradict and revise the agency’s earlier position,”\nin contravention of NACWA and the scope of the remand the\nAgency requested regarding the Major Boilers Rule and the CISWI\n\f                                 89\n\n                  2. The Page Memorandum\n\n     The Page Memorandum recognized our “concern about\nthe interpretation [we] believed [the] EPA was taking” of the\nword “average.” Page Mem. 3. It clarified that the Agency\n“does not interpret the term ‘average’” to mean “the average\nof a future 3-run compliance test.” Id. (emphasis added)\n(quoting NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1143). Rather, it explained that\nthe “EPA interprets the average to mean the average\nemissions over time,” based not only on the “average of all\nemissions test data from the best performing source or\nsources” but also on “information regarding the variability of\nemissions.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n    In the EPA’s judgment, “variability is a key factor in\nestablishing” MACT standards because “[e]ach MACT\nstandard is based on limited data from sources whose\nemissions are expected to vary over their long term\n\n\nRule. No. 11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 41. But our NACWA decision\ndid not, as the Petitioners would have it, require the EPA to adopt\nour belief that the Agency construed “average” to mean “the\naverage of a future 3-run compliance test.” See NACWA, 734 F.3d\nat 1143. Rather, we asked the EPA to clarify how, in its view, the\nUPL “represents the ‘average emissions limitation achieved by the\nbest performing 12 percent.’” Id. (emphasis added). Nor do we\nthink that the EPA altered its initial basis for using the UPL, which\nthe EPA has consistently held out as “a statistical formula designed\nto estimate a MACT floor level that is equivalent to the average of\nthe best performing sources based on future compliance tests.”\n2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,630 (emphasis added).\nWhat the EPA failed to do before NACWA was to explain how the\nUPL functions and why it is a reasonable way to calculate\n“average” emissions levels. The Page Memorandum does precisely\nthat.\n\f                                90\n\nperformance.” Id. Specifically, “[t]he available emissions\ndata are generally in the form of short term, three-run stack\ntests, with each test run lasting for between 1 and 4 hours.”\nId. For this reason, the EPA concluded that it did not have\ninformation “encompass[ing] the emissions performance of a\nsource over time.” Id. (emphasis added). And because the\n“EPA interprets ‘emissions performance’ . . . to mean the\nemissions of a source over the long term, rather than just\nduring a short-term stack test,” the EPA found it necessary to\n“appl[y] a methodology that predicts the actual emissions\nlevels the source is achieving at times other than when stack\ntesting was conducted.” Id. at 3-4 (emphases added).\n\n     The UPL is the methodology the EPA selected to account\nfor these limitations. Id. at 4. “[A] value derived from widely\naccepted and commonly used statistical principles,” the UPL\n“represents the upper end of a prediction interval.” Id. In\nlayman’s terms, the UPL uses an equation that considers\n(1) the average of the best performing source or sources’\nstack-test results (i.e., the mean); (2) the pattern the stack-test\nresults create (i.e., the distribution); (3) the variability in the\nbest performing source or sources’ stack-test results (i.e., the\nvariance); and (4) the total number of stack tests conducted\nfor the best performing source or sources (i.e., the sample\nsize). Id. at 4-5.\n\n     The UPL, however, cannot demonstrate with absolute\ncertainty the average emissions levels achieved by the best\nperforming sources at all times (indeed, certainty is\nimpossible without continuous monitoring). See id. Instead,\nthe UPL equation produces a range of values that is expected,\ngiven the variance in the relevant stack-test data, to\nencompass the average emissions levels achieved by the best\nperforming sources a specified percentage of the time. Id. at\n\f                                91\n\n4. To establish the MACT floor, the EPA calibrated the UPL\nequation to produce a range in which the average emissions\nlevels of the best performing source or sources would be\nexpected to fall 99 per cent of the time, which is referred to as\na 99 per cent confidence interval. Id. Once the EPA had this\nrange, it set the MACT floor at the top level of that range—\nhence, the “upper” in “upper prediction limit”—to arrive at a\nfigure that, 99 out of 100 times, it expected the average\nemissions levels of the best performing sources to “achieve.”\nId. Or, in the EPA’s words, “the 99 percent UPL is the level\nof emissions that” the EPA is “99 percent confident is\nachieved by the average source represented in a dataset over a\nlong-term period based on its previous, measured\nperformance history as reflected in short term stack-test data.”\nId.\n\n     One of the equations the EPA used to calculate the UPL\nis as follows:27\n\n\n\n\n    27\n         The EPA used “one of several equations” to calculate the\nUPL depending on “certain characteristics of [the] dataset,”\nincluding the distribution of data within the dataset. Page Mem. 4.\nHere, we set out the equation the EPA used for a dataset with a\n“normal distribution.” Id. at 10. For our review, we need not\nrecount the other, somewhat more complicated equations the EPA\nused in determining the UPL for datasets with, e.g., a “lognormal\ndistribution.” See id. (“Even though they differ due to separate\nmathematical properties associated with each distribution, the UPL\nequations share a common format . . . .”); see generally id. at 11\n(describing lognormal distribution equation).\n\f                                 92\n\n\n\n\nNACWA, 734 F.3d at 1139. In this equation:\n\n      “x̄ ” is the mean;\n\n      “t(0.99, n-1)” is a value called the “t-statistic,” the\n       statistical tool used to set the confidence interval\n       (here, 99 per cent);\n\n      “n” is the sample size;\n\n      “m” is the number of stack tests that were run to\n       calculate the mean (“x̄ ”); because most stack tests\n       involve 3 “runs,” m usually equals 3;\n\n      “s” represents the “standard deviation.”\n\nSee id.; see also Page Mem. 10-11.\n\n                3. Instant Challenges to UPL\n\n     After the EPA issued the Page Memorandum, the\nEnvironmental Petitioners renewed their argument that the\nUPL represents neither (1) the “average” emissions limit of\nthe best performing source or sources in a subcategory, nor\n(2) the emissions levels “achieved” by the best performing\nsources in a subcategory. We believe that the EPA has\ncarried its burden of demonstrating that the UPL “reflect[s] a\nreasonable estimate of the emissions achieved in practice by\n\f                               93\n\nthe best performing sources.” Cement Kiln, 255 F.3d at 871-\n72 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also NACWA, 734\nF.3d at 1148 (“[H]aving decided to account for variability,\nand having decided to estimate that variability, EPA bears the\nburden of demonstrating with substantial evidence that its\nestimate is reasonable.”).\n\n     Our conclusion is driven, in large part, by the deference\nwe owe the EPA when it determines how best to meet the\ntechnical challenges in its area of expertise. Indeed, the EPA\n“typically has wide latitude in determining the extent of data-\ngathering necessary to solve a problem” and, for that reason,\nwe have “accorded Chevron deference to [its] interpretation\nof [the CAA] as allowing it to estimate MACT floors.”\nNACWA, 734 F.3d at 1131. Moreover, “the requirement that\nthe existing unit floors not be less stringent than the average\nemissions limitation achieved by the best performing 12\npercent of units does not, on its own, dictate how the\nperformance of the best units is to be calculated,” id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted)—“[f]loors need not be perfect\nmirrors of the best-performers’ emissions,” Cement Kiln, 255\nF.3d at 871. So long as the EPA “demonstrate[s] with\nsubstantial evidence—not mere assertions”—that the UPL\n“allows a reasonable inference as to the performance of the\ntop 12 percent of units,” NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1131\n(quotations omitted) (emphasis added), the EPA has\nconducted reasoned decision making.\n\n    The Agency has done so here. The Page Memorandum\nexplains the limitations of stack-test data—i.e., the\n“snapshots” cannot reflect the best performing source’s or\nsources’ average emissions levels at all times and under all\noperating conditions. Page Mem. 6. The Page Memorandum\nalso explains that the Agency chose the UPL as a tool\n\f                                94\n\n“derived from widely accepted and commonly used statistical\nprinciples,” id. at 4, that “reasonably account[s] for variability\nin the emissions of . . . sources,” id. at 2. Finally, the Page\nMemorandum plugs the analytical gap we identified in\nNACWA—it thoroughly explains how and why the UPL\naccounts for the variance and therefore how and why it\nreasonably represents the emissions level “achieved by the\naverage source” or sources. Id. at 3-5. In so doing, the EPA\nhas “clarif[ied],” to our satisfaction, “how the upper\nprediction limit represents the average emissions limitation\nachieved.” NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1143 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners’ arguments to the contrary\nare unavailing. Their primary objection is that the UPL\ncannot reasonably estimate the “average” emissions level\nachieved by the best performing source or sources because the\nUPL represents “a level [the] EPA expects any future\ncompliance test by any [source] in the top 12 percent to fall\nbelow.” No. 11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 35 (emphases added)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).28        But the Page\nMemorandum counters the Environmental Petitioners’\nmistaken understanding of what the UPL represents.29\nAccording to the EPA, “the UPL does not represent the worst\nemissions performance of the best performing units at any\n\n    28\n        See also No. 11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Reply Br. 15 (“It is, as\nits name indicates, an upper limit—the emissions limitation that\nevery member of the best-performing 12 percent will fall\nbelow . . . .” (emphasis in original) (quotation marks omitted)).\n    29\n        The Environmental Petitioners’ argument rests, at least in\npart, on their contention that we should not consider the Page\nMemorandum at all. We decline their invitation to ignore the\nexplanation we ordered the EPA to provide.\n\f                                95\n\ntime.” Page Mem. 4 (emphasis in original).30 It is instead\n“the average level expected to have been achieved over time”\nby the best performing source or sources. Id. (emphasis in\noriginal). “In other words, the 99 percent UPL is the level of\nemissions that [the EPA is] 99 percent confident is achieved\nby the average source . . . over a long-term period based on\nits previous, measured performance history as reflected in\nshort term stack test data.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n     Next, the Environmental Petitioners criticize the Page\nMemorandum’s explanation that the UPL represents the long-\nterm average emissions levels achieved because “the first\nelement of the UPL equation is the average of the short-term\nemissions test data from the best-performing sources.” Id. In\ntheir view, the UPL is no different from “saying that, over\ntime, the average of 1, 2, and 3 = 2 + 500 because the first\nelement in the equation (2) is the average of 1, 2, and 3.” No.\n11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 48. But the UPL does not simply\ntack an arbitrary increase on top of the stack-test average of\nthe best performing sources. Rather, the UPL “allows [the]\nEPA to use emissions test data and the data characteristics,”\nwhich include “the distribution and sample size, along with\nthe intrinsic variability associated with those data,” to\nestimate “an emissions limit based on a specified level of\nconfidence such that an average best performing existing\n    30\n         See also Page Mem. 5 (It is “generally . . . reasonable to\nestablish a [MACT floor] standard that all the best performing 12\npercent of existing sources can meet without any modification\nbecause the statute requires the Agency to establish the standard at\nthe average level of performance of the best 12 percent of sources.”\n(emphasis in original)); id. at 14 (“[T]he MACT floor represents the\naverage emission level achieved by the best performing sources,\nnot the worst emission level achieved by those sources.” (emphases\nin original)).\n\f                                96\n\nsource would not be expected to exceed the limit a specified\nnumber of times.” Page Mem. 6 (emphases added). In other\nwords, the UPL does not simply add an arbitrarily chosen\nvalue but instead turns entirely on the features inherent in the\nstack-test data and how those features reflect the natural\nvariance in emissions experienced by the best performing\nsources over time. See id. at 4 (“[T]he MACT floor\ncalculation takes into account the inherent variability in\nemissions performance to more accurately reflect the range of\nthe best performing sources’ emissions over time.” (emphasis\nadded)).31     Thus, as the Page Memorandum amply\ndemonstrates, see id., the EPA’s use of the UPL is not\narbitrary.\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners also attack the results\nproduced by the UPL. They provide a series of charts that, in\ntheir view, demonstrate that the UPL sets MACT floors far\ntoo high to comport with the CAA’s mandate that floors\nrepresent “the maximum degree of reduction in emissions.”\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2). True, some of the charts show\nthat the EPA has set a MACT floor above the highest\nemissions level recorded by the best performing sources’\nstack testing. See No. 11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 14-15; No.\n11-1108 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Reply Br. 23. But this does not mean\nthat the UPL is an arbitrary “average” proxy—for at least two\nreasons.\n\n\n    31\n        See also Page Mem. 6-7 (“[T]he UPL equation that is used\nto account for variability and [to] calculate the MACT floor\nstandard depends on the distribution of the data.”); id. at 11 (“The\nUPL . . . is directly related to the confidence level and to the\nvariance, meaning that as either of these values go up or down, so\ndoes the UPL value.”).\n\f                               97\n\n     First, the charts selectively included are generated from\ndata sets with considerable variance between the highest\nrecorded stack test and the lowest. Unsurprisingly, if a\nhandful of “snapshots” in a data set demonstrate that\nemissions levels experience high spikes and low plummets at\ndiscrete times, it is more likely that the average emissions\nlevel achieved by the best performing sources at all times\nmight be high. This is because a data set with high variability\nwill produce a higher UPL than a data set with low variability,\neven if the two sets share the same average. In other words,\nthe UPL takes large variance into account and therefore\nnaturally goes higher to arrive at the 99 per cent certainty the\nEPA thinks is appropriate.32 Second, where the UPL\nsuggested a MACT floor higher than the results of the stack\ntests, it often did so by insubstantial amounts. Indeed, for at\nleast one chart, “the limit is a mere 4 millionths of a pound per\nmillion Btu above the emissions test results of best\nperformers, an unalarming amount given that the\nmethodology is supposed to account for variable results.”\nNo. 11-1108 Indus.

The Environmental\nPetitioners have not challenged the EPA’s choice of a 99 per cent\nconfidence level, as opposed to a lower level of certainty, and we\nexpress no opinion on that choice. And we reiterate that the more\nspecific concerns we had with the UPL when we decided\nNACWA—in particular, the UPL’s accuracy “given a small\ndataset”—are not before us. 734 F.3d at 1144-45.\n\f                                 98\n\n“minimal standard[] of rationality” that we require.

Pet’rs’ Reply Br. 24 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBut the Environmental Petitioners ignore the Page\nMemorandum’s explanation that, because the UPL is not\ntime-dependent, it “not only is a prediction of the emissions\nperformance of those sources in tests conducted in the future,\nbut is also an indication of the range of current average\nemissions performance of those units.” Page Mem. 3;33 see\nalso No. 11-1108 Indus.

BEYOND-THE-FLOOR STANDARDS FOR CISWI UNITS\n\n     The EPA declined to set beyond-the-floor standards for\nCISWI units. The Environmental Petitioners challenge that\ndetermination in three primary respects, each of which we\nreject.34\n\n     Section 7429 of the CAA directs the EPA to set MACT\nstandards in two steps. It first sets a floor level based on the\nbest performing sources. See 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2). Next, it\ndetermines “whether a more restrictive standard is\n‘achievable,’” NRDC III, 749 F.3d at 1057, “taking into\nconsideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction,\nand any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and\n\n    34\n          Although the EPA does not argue that the court lacks\njurisdiction to consider this argument, Environmental Petitioners\nraise the issue defensively, contending that they satisfied the CAA’s\nadministrative exhaustion provision. We agree. During the\nrulemaking process, the Petitioners comprehensively critiqued the\nEPA’s proposed rationale for rejecting beyond-the-floor standards.\nSee, e.g., Natural Resources Defense Council, Comments on\nStandards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and\nEmission Guidelines for Existing Sources, EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-\n0119 (Aug. 23, 2010), at 11-16 (No. 11-1125 J.A. 668-73). Many\nof those comments challenged the EPA’s consideration of costs and\nother factors—the same types of issues Petitioners now ask the\nPanel to resolve. Because the Environmental Petitioners raised the\nrelevant issues “with reasonable specificity” during the period for\npublic comment, our jurisdiction is not in question. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7607(d)(7)(B); see Portland Cement Ass’n v.

The “EPA\ncalls these stricter requirements ‘beyond-the-floor’\nstandards.” NRDC III, 749 F.3d at 1057.\n\n     In section 7429, the “Congress gave EPA broad\ndiscretion in considering whether to go beyond-the-floor.”\nNACWA, 734 F.3d at 1157. The Congress required the EPA\nto consider a variety of factors without telling the EPA how to\nweigh them. That calculus belongs to the EPA’s discretion.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2) (delegating to the EPA\nAdministrator the responsibility to “tak[e] into consideration”\nthe statutory factors). Against that backdrop, challenges to\nthe EPA’s beyond-the-floor determinations “must clear a high\nbar, as we are at our most deferential when an agency is\n‘making predictions, within its area of special expertise, at the\nfrontiers of science.’” NACWA, 734 F.3d at 1156 (quoting\nHusqvarna, 254 F.3d at 199).\n\n    When establishing MACT standards for CISWI, the EPA\ndeclined to establish beyond-the-floor standards in the\nproposed rule, see 2010 Proposed CISWI Rule, 75 Fed. Reg.\nat 31,956-59, and the final rule, see 2011 CISWI Rule, 76\nFed. Reg. at 15,729-32. The EPA also declined requests to\nreconsider that decision. See Memorandum from Eastern\nResearch Group, Inc., to Amy Hambrick, U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency, Revised Draft CISWI Reconsideration\nIssues (Dec. 20, 2012), at 22-23 (No. 11-1125 J.A. 1219-20).\n\n    35\n         EPA interprets the statutory factor of “cost” to permit\nconsideration of cost-effectiveness, NRDC III, 749 F.3d at 1060-61,\nwhich is often calculated “on [a] per ton of emissions removed\nbasis,” Husqvarna AB v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185414\"><a href=\"/opinion/185414/husqvarna-ab-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2001).\nWe have previously upheld that interpretation. See, e.g., NRDC III,\n749 F.3d at 1060-61.\n\f                             101\n\n\n\n     The first challenge targets several instances in which the\nEPA refused to require sources to adopt, as a beyond-the-floor\nmeasure, controls that most sources would employ to meet the\nMACT floor standard. In each instance, the EPA determined\nthat the relative costs outweighed the expected emissions\ngains. In the first such case, the EPA decided not to require\nliquid-fired energy recovery units to install dry sorbent\ninjection and fabric filters as a beyond-the-floor measure,\ndespite the fact that “four of the six” units would need to\ninstall those systems to meet the floor standard. 2011 CISWI\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,731. That decision satisfied the\nstatute. Had the EPA mandated the control measures, the\nremaining two units would have needed to expend “$1.1\nmillion per year” to achieve only a small emissions reduction,\n“which translates into an incremental cost-effectiveness of\nabout $230,000 per ton” of emission. Id. Nothing in section\n7429(a)(2) requires the Agency to impose a cost so\ndisproportionate to the expected emissions gains.\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners take issue with two other\ndecisions along these lines. In the first, the EPA declined to\nset beyond-the-floor mercury control measures for kilns,\nciting a cost-effectiveness of roughly $351 million per ton.\nSee Memorandum from Eastern Research Group, Inc., to Toni\nJones, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Final\nReconsideration Beyond-the-Floor Analysis for CISWI Units\n(Reconsideration Mem.) (Dec. 20, 2012), at ¶ 3.4.2 (No. 11-\n1125 J.A. 1232).        In the second, a $26,000 per-ton\nimplementation cost led the Agency not to establish stricter\ncarbon monoxide control measures for calciner kilns. See id.\n¶ 3.4.3.    Energy use—a factor mandated in section\n7429(a)(2)—also entered the equation. With respect to\ncalciner kilns, the technology used to reduce carbon\n\f                             102\n\nmonoxide would also increase energy requirements, and\ntherefore increase energy costs. See id. In each of these\ndecisions, the EPA reasonably applied the statutory factors.\nThat Petitioners would have weighed the costs differently\nprovides no grounds to displace the EPA’s otherwise\nreasonable determination.\n\n     In the second challenge to the decision not to set beyond-\nthe-floor standards, the Environmental Petitioners contend the\nAgency arbitrarily failed to set emission levels lower than the\nMACT floor for categories likely to adopt technology capable\nof meeting those lower levels. Specifically, according to the\nEnvironmental Petitioners, the EPA knew waste-burning kilns\nand energy recovery units would adopt fabric filters that\n“achieve particulate matter emissions levels dramatically\nlower than the floor, but refused to set the standard at that\nlower level.” See No. 11-1125 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 50.\n\n     That is incorrect. The Environmental Petitioners spin this\nyarn based on a line in the proposed rulemaking. There, the\nAgency speculated that kilns and energy recovery units would\nadopt fabric filters to comply with the MACT floor limit, and\nwould “likely achieve a level of performance” below the\nfloor. 2010 Proposed CISWI Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,958.\nThat statement represented a preliminary prediction, which\nwas subject to change during the notice-and-comment\nprocess. And change it did. In the final rulemaking, the EPA\nfurther subcategorized the energy recovery unit subcategory\nand revised the MACT floor for waste-burning kilns. See\n2013 CISWI Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 9,122 (explaining the\nchanges). New information received during the rulemaking\ninspired those changes, which the EPA made after\nconsidering the statutory factors. See id.; Reconsideration\nMem., ¶ 2.3-3.4.5. The evidence does not suggest that the\n\f                              103\n\nEPA refused to set beyond-the-floor emission levels it knew\nwere reasonably achievable.36\n\n     In the third challenge, the Environmental Petitioners take\nissue with three determinations that rested on factors other\nthan cost. First, the EPA declined to require coal-fired energy\nrecovery units to adopt linkageless boiler management\nsystems as a beyond-the-floor measure for carbon monoxide.\nSee Reconsideration Mem., ¶ 2.3.1.1. While acknowledging\nthat linkageless systems were available at “fairly low-cost,”\nthe EPA concluded it had insufficient data to determine the\n“actual reductions this control option would achieve” relative\nto an alternative control system. Id.\n\n     The EPA acted reasonably. The record suggests the EPA\nhad scant evidence on the efficacy of linkageless control\nmeasures applied to coal-fired energy recovery units. See id.\nHad the Agency imposed a stricter standard based on controls\nfor which it had precious little (if any) evidence, a reviewing\ncourt may well have concluded the decision lacked “a rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.”\nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Second, the EPA rejected regenerative thermal oxidizers\nas a beyond-the-floor control for carbon monoxide in solid\nwaste energy recovery units. See 2011 CISWI Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,732. Thermal oxidizers could do the job “but\nlikely at a far greater energy requirement (specifically natural\n\n    36\n          This argument suffers from an additional flaw: the\nEnvironmental Petitioners appear to treat as interchangeable\nproposed emissions rules for new units with the final rules\napplicable to existing ones. That apples-and-oranges comparison\nunderscores the weakness of the argument.\n\f                             104\n\ngas) [and] with comparable control efficiency” as carbon\nmonoxide catalysts, which “some units will need to install to\nmeet the MACT floor . . . limits.” Id. In other words, even\nthough oxidizers work as well as carbon catalysts, oxidizers\nwould be unsuitable because they use more energy. See id.\n(concluding that beyond-the-floor controls “would be\nunreasonable for this subcategory due to additional cost and\nenergy impacts”).\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners contend that the EPA\nfailed to “suggest that these natural gas requirements are high\nin an absolute sense or relevant to achievability.” No. 11-\n1125 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 51. We agree that the EPA’s analysis\nis less than fully satisfying. Among other reasons, nowhere\ndid the Agency estimate the per-ton cost of mandating\nthermal oxidizers, or compare the energy costs relative to\nother control measures.\n\n     Despite these imperfections, we reject the challenge. See\nDist. Hosp. Partners, L.P. v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">786</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61 (D.C.\nCir. 2015) (“[I]mperfection alone does not amount to arbitrary\ndecision-making.”). The EPA’s somewhat sparse analysis on\nthis issue reflects a somewhat sparse record. At bottom, the\nAgency rejected thermal oxidizers because it lacked sufficient\nevidence to support their utility, at least compared with\ncontrol measures whose efficacy and costs were better known.\n\n     The Agency’s determination should be read in context.\nElsewhere in the final rule, the EPA expanded on the energy\nand environmental impacts of thermal oxidizers, concluding\nthat “[t]he combustion of fuel needed to generate additional\nelectricity and to operate [thermal oxidizer] controls would\nyield slight increases in emissions, including NOX, CO, PM,\nand SO2 and an increase in CO2 emissions.” 2011 CISWI\n\f                              105\n\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,744. The EPA addressed another\nstatutory factor—cost—by reasonable implication. Energy—\nnatural gas, in this case—is not free. A technology that\ndemands “far greater energy requirement[s]” naturally comes\nat a cost. See id. at 15,732.\n\n     Though courts are powerless to “supply a reasoned basis\nfor the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given,”\n“[w]e will . . . uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if\nthe agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.” State Farm,\n463 U.S. at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the\nAgency’s path may reasonably be discerned: mandating\nthermal oxidizers was not achievable due to increased energy\ndemands and a corollary increase in cost, see 2011 CISWI\nRule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,732 (declining to set a beyond-the-\nfloor limit “due to additional cost and energy impacts”). For\nthose reasons, EPA did not act unreasonably.\n\n     Third, and finally, the Environmental Petitioners\nchallenge the rejection of dry sorbent injection and wet\nscrubbers as beyond-the-floor measures for waste-burning\nkilns. The EPA determined those measures would be cost-\neffective (at only $5,000 per ton) but declined to require them\ndue to “uncertainty” surrounding “the appropriate control\nsystem that some existing kilns would need to employ to\nmeet” a stricter standard, “especially kilns that use ingredients\nwith a high sulfur content.” See Reconsideration Mem.,\n¶ 3.4.5. Adding to that uncertainty, the EPA could not\n“account for potential costs at existing sources for additional\nscrubber water and spent sorbent.” Id. As before, the EPA\nreached a reasonable conclusion in the face of imperfect\ninformation. Had the EPA set a beyond-the-floor standard\nbased on sorbent injection and wet scrubbers, the Agency\n\f                                106\n\nwould have been flying blind. In avoiding that course, we\nconclude the EPA acted reasonably.\n\n          E. REGULATION OF CERTAIN CISWI UNITS\n\n     The final CISWI Rule did not contain emission standards\nfor burn-off ovens, cyclonic burn barrels, foundry sand\nreclamation units, soil treatment units, and space heaters. The\nEnvironmental Petitioners claim that the EPA unlawfully\nexempted these units from regulation by creating\nsubcategories that capture only a subset of the units that the\nAgency is required to regulate as CISWI. The EPA, however,\nprotests that it did not exempt these five types of units from\nregulation. Rather, the Agency determined that it lacked\nsufficient data to regulate the units at this time, and, with\nrespect to some, it received comments suggesting the units\nwere not CISWI.37\n\n\n     37\n         The EPA asserts that it has not made a final decision with\nregard to the regulation of the five units at issue here—a claim that\ncalls into question our jurisdiction, which under the CAA is limited\nto “final” actions. See Portland Cement, 665 F.3d at 193 (citing 42\nU.S.C. § 7607(b)). We disagree with the Agency. Because the\nstatutory deadline for the EPA to establish emission standards for\nall CISWI has passed, see 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(1)(D), “the\npromulgated regulations must be deemed the [A]gency’s complete\nresponse in compliance with the statutory requirement[].” Hercules\nInc. v.

Moreover, the\nEPA did not signal in the administrative record that it was\n“continu[ing] the rulemaking process” as to these five units.\nPortland Cement, 665 F.3d at 194 (holding that the EPA’s action\n\f                              107\n\n     We agree with the Environmental Petitioners that the\nAgency has violated its nondiscretionary statutory duty (1) to\npromulgate standards with respect to cyclonic burn barrels,\nand (2) to determine whether the remaining four types of units\nfall within the statutory definition of CISWI. The CAA\nrequires the EPA to “establish performance standards . . . for\neach category of solid waste incineration units” no later than\nNovember 15, 1994. See 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(1)(A), (D).\nThe statute then defines “solid waste incineration unit” as a\n“distinct operating unit of any facility which combusts any\nsolid waste material from commercial or industrial\nestablishments or the general public.” Id. § 7429(g)(1)\n(emphasis added). That provision unambiguously requires the\nEPA to set emission standards for “any facility that combusts\nany commercial or industrial solid waste material at all,”\nsubject only to the listed statutory exceptions. NRDC I, 489\nF.3d at 1257-58. Because the statutory deadline to regulate\nthese units has long passed, the EPA has “breached a non-\ndiscretionary duty” if it has failed to promulgate standards for\nany facilities combusting solid waste from commercial or\nindustrial establishments that do not fit into the listed\nexceptions.

(explaining that the “plain language” of a similar\nprovision in RCRA “obligates the Agency to issue, by the\ndeadline, revisions for all facilities” covered by the statute\nand therefore “does not contemplate partial compliance”).\n\n    The Agency makes no effort to claim that cyclonic burn\nbarrels fall outside the statutory definition for CISWI units.\n\nwas not “final” under 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b) because the Agency\nexpressly stated in its final rule that the rulemaking process\nremained underway). We therefore need not consider whether our\nconclusion regarding finality would change had it done so.\n\f                              108\n\nNor could it—both the administrative record and the EPA’s\nbrief make clear that cyclonic burn barrels “combust” solid\nwaste. See 2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on Reconsideration,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 80,460 (describing a cyclonic burn barrel as\n“a combustion device for waste materials”); No. 11-1125\nEPA Br. 68 (same); see also 42 U.S.C. § 7429(g)(1) (defining\n“solid waste incineration unit” as a “distinct operating unit of\nany facility which combusts any solid waste material from\ncommercial or industrial establishments or the general\npublic”). Because they combust solid waste, cyclonic burn\nbarrels clearly fall within the statutory definition of “solid\nwaste incineration unit” and, as established above, the EPA\nhad a nondiscretionary statutory duty to establish emission\nstandards for all these units by 1994. We therefore conclude\nthat the Agency violated that duty by failing to promulgate\nemission standards for cyclonic burn barrels.\n\n     The EPA protests that it reasonably chose not to regulate\ncyclonic burn barrels at this time, given how little information\nit had on them. According to the EPA, comments revealed\nthere were many more cyclonic burn barrels in use than\noriginally thought, the Agency lacked data on these units, and\nit was “difficult, if not impossible, to test such units for the\nsection 7429 pollutants.” No. 11-1125 EPA Br. 69. But this\nargument misses the point: in light of the unambiguous\nstatutory command to promulgate numeric standards for all\nsolid waste incineration units, the EPA had no discretion to\navoid regulating any such units—even if its choice to avoid\nregulating these units would have been otherwise reasonable.\nThe Agency was obligated to collect the data it needed, and\nCongress gave it the authority to do so. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7414(a) (explaining that for the purpose of regulating solid\nwaste combustion under section 7429, the EPA may, for\nexample, require owners and operators of those units to\n\f                              109\n\nsample emissions, keep records, and offer other information\nthat the Agency needs). Moreover, the Agency provides no\nevidence that it would be infeasible to set emission standards\nfor these units. Instead, the EPA merely states that it\n“received information” that measuring emissions is difficult,\n“if not impossible,” but points to no comments or evidence\nsupporting this assertion. 2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on\nReconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,460.\n\n     The EPA also had a duty to determine whether the other\nchallenged sources—burn-off ovens (including foundry sand\nreclamation units), soil treatment units, and space heaters—\nwere units that “combust” solid waste. Several commenters\ntold the Agency that these units fell within the statutory\ndefinition of CISWI, and the EPA itself initially viewed some\nof these units as combusting waste. See, e.g., CISWI Rule—\nResponses to Comments, at 74-76; 2010 Proposed CISWI\nRule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,941. Under these circumstances, the\nAgency was obligated to determine whether the units in fact\ncombust solid waste. Yet the EPA concedes it never made\nthat determination. As we have explained, the EPA had a\nnondiscretionary duty to promulgate standards for all solid\nwaste combustion units.        This obligation includes the\nsubsidiary duty to determine whether the units identified by\nthe commenters in fact combust solid waste. Any other\nconclusion would allow the Agency to ignore its statutory\nmandate altogether by not taking the initial step of identifying\nsuch units.\n\n     The CAA unambiguously requires that the Agency\nestablish standards for all CISWI units. As a result, we grant\nthe Environmental Petitioners’ petition for review on this\nissue and remand to the Agency to set emission standards for\ncyclonic burn barrels. The EPA must also determine whether\n\f                             110\n\nthe remaining four types of units are CISWI units and, if it\nfinds that they are, it must set standards for them as well.\n\n         F. DELISTING UNDER 42 U.S.C. § 7412(C)\n\n     In contrast to major source subcategories (all of which\nthe EPA must control), the CAA does not require the EPA to\ncontrol emissions in every area source subcategory. See 42\nU.S.C. § 7412(c)(1), (3). The Act does, however, mandate\nthat the EPA control area source emissions if the area source\nsubcategory meets certain criteria. Section 7412(c)(1), for\ninstance, requires the EPA to control any area source\nsubcategory upon the Agency’s finding that emissions from\nthe sources in the subcategory jeopardize either the\nenvironment or human health. See id. § 7412(c)(3). If so, the\nEPA can establish either a MACT or a GACT standard. See\nid. § 7412(d)(5). Similarly, if the EPA finds that capping\nemissions from an area source subcategory is necessary to\nachieve a 90 per cent reduction in the aggregate emissions of\none of seven CAA-enumerated HAPs, section 7412(c)(6)\nrequires the Agency to impose caps in that subcategory as\nwell. See id. § 7412(c)(6). Upon that finding, however, the\nEPA must impose a MACT standard. Id.\n\n     In addition to prescribing requirements for inclusion of\narea source subcategories, the CAA provides a mechanism for\nremoval of area source subcategories that, in the EPA’s view,\nno longer need to be controlled. Specifically, the EPA can\n“delete” any subcategory if it finds that no source or group of\nsources in it (1) emits cancer-causing HAPs at a volume\nsufficient to increase the lifetime risk of cancer in the\npopulation by more than one in one million and (2) emits non-\ncancer-causing HAPs at a level in excess of that which is\nadequate “to protect public health with an ample margin of\n\f                             111\n\nsafety” and to prevent against environmental harm. Id.\n§ 7412(c)(9)(B). The section 7412(c)(9) process is known as\n“delisting.”\n\n     In 1998, the EPA identified several area source boiler\nsubcategories—including       oil-fired,   industrial    wood,\ncommercial oil-fired and commercial wood-combustion\nboilers—as contributors to the “90 per centum of the\naggregate emissions” of Hg and POM under section\n7412(c)(6).     See Source Category Listing for Section\n112(d)(2) Rulemaking Pursuant to Section 112(c)(6)\nRequirements, 63 Fed. Reg. 17,838, 17,839 (Apr. 10, 1998).\nWhen it decided to “list” these sources, however, the EPA\nincluded a caveat. It explained that it used the best emissions\ninformation it had at the time to conclude that these boiler\nsubcategories produced enough Hg and POM emissions to\njustify section 7412(c)(6) control but it also admitted that it\ncould not “assure that this calculation of the 90 percent will\nremain constant.” Id. at 17,840.\n\n     The caveat proved prescient. When the EPA issued the\n2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, it decided it needed to\nregulate only coal-fired boilers at the MACT level to control\n90 per cent of Hg emissions. See 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,898.\nAnd when it finalized the 2011 Area Boilers Rule, the Agency\nsimilarly decided that it needed to regulate only coal-fired\nboilers at the MACT level to control 90 per cent of POM\nemissions. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,566.\n\n     For this reason, the EPA established GACT, rather than\nMACT, standards for the oil-fired and biomass-fired area\nsource subcategories regarding these two pollutants. See id.\nIt did not, however, make any of the “delisting” findings\nrequired by section 7412(c)(9) when it removed these area\n\f                               112\n\nsource subcategories from section 7412(c)(6)’s purview. See\n2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,566 (“[W]e have\nnot removed or ‘delisted’ oil-fired and biomass-fired area\nsource boilers by this action. We are not promulgating\nMACT-based regulations at this time because they are\nunnecessary to meet the requirements of CAA section\n112(c)(6).”). The Environmental Petitioners challenge the\nEPA’s imposition of GACT standards, arguing that, because\nonce the EPA “listed” these sources under section\n7412(c)(6)’s MACT requirement, the CAA mandates that the\nEPA “delist” them under section 7412(c)(9) before putting\nthem under the more lenient GACT standards. In their view,\nthe EPA’s contrary approach fails at Chevron step 1. The\nEPA responds that section 7412(c)(9) applies only if it\ndecides to “delist” a subcategory entirely from section 7412\nregulation, resulting in neither MACT nor GACT restrictions.\n\n      Because section 7412(c)(9) does not unambiguously\napply to section 7412(c)(6) and because the EPA’s\ninterpretation of section 7412(c)(9)’s delisting requirement is\nreasonable, we uphold the EPA’s decision as permissible\nunder Chevron step 2. Section 7412(c)(9) provides that the\nEPA “may delete any source category from the list under this\nsubsection” on its finding that the source category is not a\nthreat to human health or the environment. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(c)(9)(B). The inclusion of a singular “list” to govern\n“this subsection” seems, most naturally, to refer to the list\ncontemplated by section 7412(c)(1), which states that the\nEPA “shall publish, and shall from time to time . . . revise . . .\na list of all categories and subcategories of . . . area sources\n(listed under paragraph (3)).” Id. § 7412(c)(1) (emphasis\nadded). In other words, it appears that section 7412(c)(1)\ndirects the EPA to create one “list” of source categories and\nsubcategories to subject to emission controls and section\n\f                              113\n\n7412(c)(9) instructs how to remove source categories from\nthat list. This conclusion finds support in section 7412(c)(1)’s\ncross reference to “paragraph (3)” of section 7412(c), which\nlays out the circumstances under which the EPA “shall list”\narea source categories for emissions control. Id. § 7412(c)(3).\n\n     In the Environmental Petitioners’ view, section\n7412(c)(9) also applies to a second, subsidiary list—that\ncontemplated by section 7412(c)(6), requiring imposition of\nthe MACT standard. Granted, section 7412(c)(6) mandates\nthat the EPA “shall . . . list” source categories and\nsubcategories if doing so is necessary to control 90 per cent of\nthe aggregate emissions from seven enumerated pollutants.\nId. § 7412(c)(6) (emphasis added). But the use of the verb\n“list” in section 7412(c)(6) does not unambiguously establish\nthat 7412(c)(9), titled “[d]eletions from the list,” applies.\nBecause section 7412(c)(9) is ambiguous, we defer to the\nEPA so long as its interpretation is “based on a permissible\nconstruction.” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43. And the EPA’s\nreading of section 7412(c)(9)—that it applies only if the EPA\nwants to remove a category from all section 7412\nregulation—is reasonable.\n\n     First, the EPA’s approach harmonizes sections\n7412(c)(1), 7412(c)(3), and 7412(c)(9). Because the EPA\nmust find that an area source “presents a threat of adverse\neffects to human health or the environment” before it\nregulates the source category at all, id. § 7412(c)(3), it makes\nsense to require the EPA to find that “no source in the\ncategory or subcategory . . . exceed[s] a level which is\nadequate to protect public health . . . and no adverse\nenvironmental effect will result from emissions from any\nsource” before it completely deregulates that category, id.\n§ 7412(c)(9). It makes less sense to require the EPA to make\n\f                             114\n\nthe same findings before it opts for GACT instead of MACT\nstandards, which occurs when the EPA removes a source from\nsection 7412(c)(6)’s purview but continues to regulate it\nunder section 7412(c)(1).\n\n    Second, the EPA’s approach is consistent with our\ndecision in New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. There, we held that\n“the only way EPA could remove [a source category] from\nthe section [7412(c)(1)] list was by satisfying section\n[7412(c)(9)’s] requirements.” Id. at 582. In other words, New\nJersey held that the EPA cannot remove a source category\nfrom all section 7412 regulation without delisting it; it said\nnothing about the process by which the EPA moves source\ncategories from section 7412(c)(6).\n\n     Finally, the Petitioners’ argument would freeze the\nEPA’s decision as to which sources need to be controlled to\nreach the requisite 90 per cent emissions reduction for the\nsection 7412(c)(6) pollutants until it determines that “no\nsource in the category or subcategory . . . exceed[s] a level\nwhich is adequate to protect public health . . . and no adverse\nenvironmental effect will result from emissions from any\nsource.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(c)(9). This, in turn, would hamper\nthe EPA’s ability to respond to updated data, thereby\nsubstantially complicating its attempts to control the\npollutants. Nothing in the CAA suggests that the Congress\nintended to so hamstring the Agency.\n\nG. TITLE V PERMIT EXEMPTION FOR SYNTHETIC BOILERS\n\n    The EPA has discretion to exempt one or more area\nsource categories from Title V permitting requirements upon\na finding “that compliance with such requirements is\nimpracticable, infeasible, or unnecessarily burdensome on\nsuch categories.” 42 U.S.C. § 7661a(a). The EPA originally\n\f                              115\n\nproposed exempting some area source categories because\nexisting “testing, monitoring, notification, and recordkeeping\nrequirements” rendered Title V permitting cumulative. 2010\nProposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,910. At the\ntime, however, the EPA elected not to exempt synthetic area\nsources as one of those categories. Id. at 31,913. Synthetic\narea sources are boilers that “naturally” emit pollutants at a\nmajor source level but which qualify as area sources due to\nthe voluntary adoption of air pollution control technologies.\nId. Despite its initial stance, the EPA ultimately decided to\nexempt all area sources—including synthetic area sources—\nfrom Title V’s permitting requirements. See 2011 Area\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,578.\n\n     Environmental Petitioners argue the EPA’s decision to\nexclude synthetic boilers from Title V licensing requirements\nis arbitrary and capricious for two reasons. First, they say, the\nEPA arbitrarily concluded synthetic area sources would bear\nthe same level of burden as other area sources in complying\nwith Title V permitting requirements, rather than a lesser one.\nSee No. 11-1141 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 39-43. And second, they\ncontend the EPA arbitrarily dismissed the additional\ncompliance benefits of Title V licensing for these synthetic\nsources. See id. at 43-47. Under State Farm, “an agency rule\n[is] arbitrary and capricious if the agency . . . offered an\nexplanation of its decision that runs counter to the evidence\nbefore the agency.” 463 U.S. at 43. A court may not accept\nan agency’s “post hoc rationalizations” for its\ndecisionmaking. Id. at 49.\n\n    The EPA has authority under the CAA to exempt sources\nfrom Title V permitting requirements if those requirements\nwould be “impracticable, infeasible, or unnecessarily\nburdensome” on the area source. 42 U.S.C. § 7661a(a). The\n\f                             116\n\nEPA previously developed a four-factor balancing test to\ndetermine whether Title V’s requirements are “unnecessarily\nburdensome.” See Exemption of Certain Area Sources from\nTitle V Operating Permit Programs, 70 Fed. Reg. 75,320,\n75,323 (Dec. 19, 2005). Under this test, the EPA considers\nwhether: (1) Title V permitting would result in significant\nimprovements in compliance with emission standards;\n(2) whether Title V permitting would impose significant\nburdens on the area source category; (3) whether the costs are\njustified, taking into account potential gains; and (4) whether\nthere are existing enforcement programs in place sufficient to\nensure compliance. See id. at 75,323-26. The EPA also must\nconsider, consistent with the legislative history of the CAA,\nwhether exemption would “adversely affect public health,\nwelfare, or the environment.” Id. at 75,333-34. These factors\nare considered in combination and not every factor must point\nin favor of exemption for the EPA to choose that course. See\nid. at 75,323.\n\n     In its 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, the EPA applied\nthis balancing test and excluded almost all area source boilers\nexcept synthetic boilers that achieved “area” status via\ninstallation of a control technology (although it exempted\nthose that achieved “area” status through operational\nchanges). The EPA provided an extensive rationale for its\ndecision to exclude these “natural” area sources from Title\nV’s permitting requirements. See 2010 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,910-13. With respect to\nfactor one, the EPA found its proposed rule already required\n“direct monitoring of emissions,” both continuously and\nperiodically, recordkeeping that would allow for additional\nmonitoring, and “semi-annual reporting to assure\ncompliance.” Id. at 31,911. Moreover, under the proposed\nrule, “records are required to be maintained in a form suitable\n\f                             117\n\nand readily available for expeditious review” for up to five\nyears. Id. The EPA acknowledged Title V permitting could\nprovide some additional compliance benefits; specifically,\nthat Title V has an every-six-month monitoring and reporting\nrequirement. See id. But the EPA ultimately concluded the\nmonitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of its\nproposed rule were sufficient to assure compliance: “Given\nthe nature of the operations at most area sources and the types\nof requirements in this rule, Title V would not significantly\nimprove those compliance requirements.” Id.\n\n     As to the second factor, the EPA noted that subjecting\nmost area sources to Title V would “impose[] certain burdens\nand costs that do not exist outside of the [t]itle V program.”\nId. at 31,912. One of the EPA’s major concerns was that\n“requiring permits for the large number of area sources could,\nat least in the first few years of implementation, potentially\nadversely affect public health, welfare, or the environment by\nshifting [s]tate agencies[’] resources away from assuring\ncompliance for major sources with existing permits to issuing\nnew permits for these area sources, potentially reducing\noverall air program effectiveness.” Id. at 31,913. For the\nthird factor, the EPA concluded the costs of compliance\nwould “impose a significant burden on many of the\napproximately 137,000 facilities affected by this proposed\nrule” with only “low” potential gains in compliance. Id. at\n31,912. Finally, for the fourth factor, the EPA determined\nthat “[s]tate delegated programs are sufficient to assure\ncompliance with this [rule],” and noted that the Agency\nretains authority to enforce this rule “anytime.” Id. The EPA\ntherefore proposed exempting these area sources from the\npermitting requirements. See id. Environmental Petitioners\nare not currently challenging the exemption for non-synthetic\narea boilers.\n\f                             118\n\n     However, in this 2010 rulemaking, the EPA also\nexplained precisely why it declined to exempt synthetic area\nsources that installed air pollution controls from Title V\nrequirements. First, the EPA noted these synthetic area\nsources “represent less than one percent of the total number of\nsources that will be subject to the final rule.” Id. at 31,913.\nThe EPA also characterized these sources as “much more like\nthe major sources” that are not exempt from Title V\npermitting requirements. Id. Further distinctions included\nthat “many of these sources are located in cities, and often in\nclose proximity to residential and commercial centers where\nlarge numbers of people live and work,” that they “have\nsignificantly higher emissions potential when uncontrolled”\n(even compared to synthetic boilers that adopted operational\nlimits to attain area source status), and that many of these\nsources “are large facilities with comprehensive compliance\nprograms in place” as opposed to small facilities, like schools\nor hospitals. Id. Given these distinctions, the EPA concluded\nadditional public involvement and compliance oversight\nthrough Title V was “important to ensure that these sources\nare maintaining their emissions at the area source level.” Id.\n\n     But the EPA shifted its position in the 2011 Area Boilers\nRule by deciding to exempt all area sources, including\nsynthetic sources. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,578. The EPA\nprovided only a cursory explanation for this shift, noting how\na further review of the record led it to conclude “observations\nand data we have relied upon in other rulemakings for\ndistinguishing between sources that became synthetic area\nsources due to controls and other synthetic and natural area\nsources [do] not necessarily apply to this source category.”\nId. (emphasis added). Because the EPA asserted it no longer\nhad “sufficient information” to identify control-technology-\ndependent synthetic sources, it decided to apply the same\n\f                               119\n\nrationale used to exempt “natural” sources to these synthetic\nsources. Id. (“[T]he rationale for exempting most area\nsources subject to this rule . . . is also now relevant for sources\nwhich we proposed to permit [under Title V].”). But—even if\nthe EPA truly cannot distinguish between synthetic sources\nrelying on control technologies and other sources—it does not\ninvariably follow that the justifications the Agency relied on\nfor exempting “natural” sources under the four-factor\nbalancing test can be transposed onto these synthetic sources.\nCf. Sierra Club II, 479 F.3d at 884 (“We agree with the Sierra\nClub that EPA’s use of work practice standards instead of\nemission floors violates section 7412(h). That provision\nallows EPA to substitute work practice standards for emission\nfloors only if measuring emissions levels is technologically or\neconomically impracticable. Here, EPA never determined\nthat measuring emissions from ceramic kilns was\nimpracticable; it determined only that it lacked emissions data\nfrom ceramics kilns. EPA thus had no basis under section\n7412(h) for using work practice standards.”).\n\n     In its next iteration of the rule, the EPA endeavored to\nfurther explain its exemption of synthetic sources. The EPA\nagain stated it “lacked sufficient information” to distinguish\nthese synthetic sources from other area sources. See 2011\nProposed Area Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 80,538. The Sierra Club challenged this exemption in a\ncomment, and the EPA responded with “additional analysis”\nof the synthetic exemption. Id. In this analysis, the EPA first\nreiterated the difference in number between the two types:\nestimating there to be at least 48 control-technology-\ndependent synthetic sources versus 137,000 other area\nsources, most of which are located at small facilities like\nschools, hospitals, and churches. See id. The EPA then\nprovided a new rationale for the exemption: that these\n\f                               120\n\nsynthetic facilities “may already have a Title V permit for\nother reasons.” Id. The EPA also found that “synthetic area\nsources would likely be subject to more stringent permit and\nmonitoring requirements than natural area sources” because\nthey have a “legal duty to use the control equipment” to keep\nthem at an “area” level. Id. (emphasis added). Finally, the\nEPA made several assertions about the similarities between\nsynthetic and natural sources. Specifically, that synthetic\nsources are “similar in size and sophistication to those that are\nnatural area sources,” that their “uncontrolled emissions are\ngenerally on the same order of magnitude as the emissions of\nnatural sources,” and that “the facilities and owners are\ncomparable in size.” Id. The EPA provided no data or\nexamples in support of these assertions, which appear to\ndirectly contradict the distinctions the EPA listed in its earlier\nversion of the rule. Compare id., with 2010 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,913. In its final rule, the\nEPA declined to make any changes to its Title V\nexemptions—exempting all area sources including synthetic\nsources using a control technology. See 2013 Area Boilers\nRule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,497.\n\n     Based on this record, the EPA’s reasoning has several\nfatal flaws that render its exemption decision arbitrary. The\nEPA put forward two primary justifications for exempting\nsynthetic sources: (1) that it could not necessarily rely on\nexisting data for distinguishing the different type of sources,\nand (2) that these facilities are “similar in size and\nsophistication” to natural area sources. See 2011 Proposed\nArea Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n80,538. The second justification flatly contradicts the EPA’s\nearlier, extensive discussion about how these synthetic\nsources have higher emissions potential and are often located\non large sites with existing compliance programs, in addition\n\f                               121\n\nto being uniquely few in number and generally found near\ncities. 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at\n31,912-13. These factors all undercut the EPA’s assertion\nthat synthetic sources are “similar”—in size, sophistication, or\notherwise—to natural sources. With respect to the lack of\ndata for distinguishing, the EPA was able to estimate in its\nproposed rule that 48 synthetic sources would have been\naffected by this rule—which suggests the EPA possesses\nsome mechanism for distinguishing the types. See 2011\nProposed Area Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 80,538. Moreover, the EPA does not explain why the data\nit used in prior rulemakings to distinguish these source types\nis not accurate in this context. Environmental Petitioners also\npoint out that, “to qualify for area-source status, synthetic area\nsources must notify the EPA or the state permitting authority\nof the limits on their emissions,” such that the EPA “need\nonly ask these authorities to identify the sources operating in\ntheir states.” No. 11-1141, Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 39-40. The EPA\nnever endeavors to explain why that mechanism (or any other\nexisting mechanism) is insufficient for identifying synthetic\narea sources.\n\n     Because its justifications for the final rule contradict\nearlier findings, the EPA must provide some reasoning to\nexplain why its final decision “runs counter to the evidence\nbefore the agency.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.

Cir. 1998) (“EPA retains a duty to examine key\nassumptions as part of its affirmative burden of promulgating\nand explaining a nonarbitrary, non-capricious rule.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n     The EPA’s major oversight was its failure to explain why\nthe rationale it used to exempt natural area sources from Title\nV could be identically applied to synthetic area sources. One\nof the Agency’s main justifications for exempting natural area\nsources was that their prolific numbers might overwhelm state\nand local regulatory agencies, diverting resources from other\nimportant environmental programs, thereby harming public\nhealth and welfare. The EPA never explained why requiring\n48 synthetic area sources to comply with Title V would strain\ngovernment resources to a comparable degree as would\nrequiring the 137,000 natural area sources to comply. As\ndiscussed above, the EPA also did not explain how it\nsuddenly determined these synthetic area sources were\n“similar in size and sophistication” to natural sources, when it\nhad previously articulated several key differences. It is\nparticularly unclear how these synthetic sources could have\n“uncontrolled emissions . . . generally on the same order of\nmagnitude as the emissions of natural area sources.” 2011\nProposed Area Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 80,538. Given that synthetic sources are defined as\n“major” sources that have artificially reduced their emissions\nto an “area” level, it is difficult to understand how the\nuncontrolled emissions of these sources would be similar to\nnatural area sources. Additionally, the EPA asserted that\nsynthetic source “facilities and owners are comparable in\n\f                              123\n\nsize” to natural sources. Id. This contradicts earlier findings\nthat synthetic sources tend to be large, located on sites with\nexisting compliance plans, and near population-dense areas.\nThe EPA provides no data or explanation to support this shift.\n\n     The EPA relies on another problematic premise when it\nclaims the potential benefits of subjecting synthetic area\nsources to Title V requirements are low. Both the EPA and\nIndustry Intervenors argue that the added benefits of Title V\nwould be minimal for these synthetic sources, relying solely\non the rationale given for natural sources. But the EPA\noriginally asserted “additional public involvement and\ncompliance assurance requirements through title V [are]\nimportant to ensure that these sources are maintaining their\nemissions at the area source level.” 2010 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,913 (emphasis added). The\nEPA never explains why these additional benefits were\nconsidered “important” before but are now “not important”\nsimply because it allegedly determined that synthetic sources\nmay be hard to distinguish from natural sources. The\ndifficulty in identifying synthetic sources says nothing about\nthe benefits that may be gained by requiring Title V permits,\nassuming the sources can be identified. Synthetic sources\nretain the attributes which first motivated the EPA to subject\nthem to Title V permitting: they tend to be near cities,\nspecifically near large residential populations, and they have\ngreater emission potential if their control technology is\nremoved, turned off, or not kept up to standards. The EPA\narguably finds Title V’s additional compliance benefits\nunnecessary because synthetic sources have “a legal duty to\nuse the control equipment” and that use is “not optional.”\n2011 Proposed Area Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 80,538. But that observation does not speak to the\nneed for public oversight; just because facilities are obligated\n\f                              124\n\nto use the control technology does not mean they will always\ndo so. Title V’s process requires facilities to submit\ncompliance documentation every six months—far more\nfrequently than under the EPA’s current rule—which expands\nthe opportunity for public oversight and compliance. Perhaps\nthis “legal duty” provides a stronger incentive for compliance\nthan public oversight but, if so, the EPA still fails to explain\nhow.\n\n     Similarly, for factor three’s balancing of costs and\nbenefits, the EPA never justifies applying to natural sources—\nwhich tend to be small sites like schools, hospitals, and\nchurches—the same rationale it applies to these larger\nsynthetic sources, which tend to be located at refineries,\nchemical plants, and factories. Given these distinctions, it is\nat least possible this balancing would lead to a different\noutcome for synthetic sources. Taken as a whole, the EPA’s\nanalysis fails to explain why several of the facts and\ncharacteristics it relied on for its initial assessment are no\nlonger relevant—creating several glaring inconsistencies in\nthe rulemaking record. The EPA offers no plausible reason\nfor applying the results of the four-factor test for natural\nsources wholesale to these control-technology-dependent\nsynthetic sources. We do not hold, however, that the EPA can\nnever remove synthetic area sources from the ambit of Title V\ncompliance. The outcome the EPA ultimately reached may\nbe reasonable; however, “[n]ot only must an agency’s decreed\nresult be within the scope of its lawful authority, but the\nprocess by which it reaches that result must be logical and\nrational.” Allentown Mack Sales & Serv., Inc. v.

The EPA should have applied its four-\nfactor balancing test directly to synthetic sources or, at a\nminimum, provided an explanation for adopting the natural\n\f                             125\n\nsource balancing test that is not premised on inconsistencies\nin the record.\n\n     With respect to remedy, there is a strong possibility that\nthe Agency can properly explain its decision to exclude\nsynthetic boilers from the Title V permitting requirement;\nmoreover, vacating the decision would be unnecessarily\ndisruptive for synthetic boiler operators who, in the interim,\nwould not know whether they needed to begin the expensive,\ntime-consuming process of obtaining a Title V permit.

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602333\"><a href=\"/opinion/602333/allied-signal-inc-v-us-nuclear-regulatory-commission-and-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150-51 (D.C.

GACT STANDARD DETERMINATIONS\n\n    With few exceptions, the EPA has broad discretion to\nchoose how to control area source emissions. For instance,\nthe EPA has discretion to choose between GACT and MACT\nstandards in the majority of cases.       See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 7412(d)(5). Even if the EPA chooses a MACT standard, it\nhas discretion—although somewhat circumscribed—to set a\nwork-practice standard instead of a numeric standard. Id.\n§ 7412(h)(1). And the EPA has discretion when choosing\namong different GACT-standard options.           See id.\n§ 7412(d)(5).\n\n     Accordingly, we must uphold the EPA’s GACT-standard\ndeterminations so long as it “has considered the relevant\nfactors and articulated a rational connection between the facts\nfound and the choice made, and has not relied on [improper]\nfactors.” Nat’l Ass’n of Clean Air Agencies, 489 F.3d at 1228\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But for all\nof the discretion the EPA enjoys, it must nonetheless\ndemonstrate that it exercised its judgment in a reasoned way.\n\f                              126\n\nThe cases establishing this principle are legion. See, e.g.,\nTransactive Corp. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723739\"><a href=\"/opinion/723739/transactive-corporation-v-united-states-of-america-and-robert-e-rubin/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236 (D.C.\nCir. 1996) (agency must “identif[y] and explain[] the\nreasoned basis for its decision”); Int’l Fabricare Inst., 972\nF.2d at 389 (agency must “examine[] the relevant data and\n. . . articulate[] an adequate explanation for its action”). The\nEPA need not go to great lengths to meet its burden; indeed,\nwe “uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity” so long as\n“the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.” State\nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43 (quoting Ark.-Best Freight Sys., Inc.,\n419 U.S. at 286).\n\n     With these principles in mind, we address the\nEnvironmental Petitioners’ two challenges to the EPA’s\ndiscretionary decisions regarding the Area Boilers Rule.\n\n          1. EPA’s Selection of GACT Standards\n                   for Non-Hg Metals\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners argue that the EPA failed\nto support its decision-making when it established MACT\nstandards for Hg and POM emissions from some coal-fired\nboilers but declined to regulate non-Hg emissions under the\nMACT standard from the same boilers. We agree. Although\nthe EPA thoroughly explained why it chose to impose one\nGACT standard instead of another, nothing in the record\nexplains why the EPA decided to impose GACT standards\ninstead of MACT standards in the first place. Despite the\nAgency’s broad discretion, we cannot sustain its action in the\nabsence of some explanation for why GACT standards are\nmore appropriate than MACT standards for these sources and\ntypes of pollutants. See Transactive Corp., 91 F.3d at 236.\nFor this reason, we remand (but do not vacate) the EPA’s\nchoice of GACT standards for non-Hg emissions from coal-\n\f                              127\n\nfired boilers. See Sierra Club, 167 F.3d at 664; Nat’l Lime\nAss’n, 233 F.3d at 634-35.\n\n     2. EPA’s Selection of Certain GACT Standards\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners also challenge several of\nthe EPA’s choices among different GACT standards. As\nnoted, see supra § I.A.1.c, the CAA provides virtually no\ninstruction regarding GACT standards but the standards\ngenerally take the form of “methods, practices and techniques\nwhich are commercially available and appropriate for\napplication by the sources in the category considering\neconomic impacts and the technical capabilities of the firms\nto operate and maintain the emissions control systems.” S.\nREP. NO. 101-228, at 171 (1989). Because the EPA has\nample discretion to choose the appropriate GACT standard,\nwe will affirm its choices so long as we can discern reasoned\ndecision-making from the record. State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.\nFor the reasons set forth below, we can do so here and,\naccordingly, we reject the Environmental Petitioners’ GACT-\nfocused challenges.\n\n      First, the Environmental Petitioners challenge the data set\nthe EPA used to arrive at the numeric GACT standards for\nnon-Hg-metal emissions from coal-fired boilers. Specifically,\nthey contend that the EPA set the GACT limit based on\nboilers with no control technology, which resulted in a\nnumeric standard of 0.42 lb/mmBtu. They insist that the EPA\nshould instead have examined boilers outfitted with fabric\nfilters, which would have resulted in a numeric standard of\n0.03 lb/mmBtu. The EPA, however, thoroughly explained\nwhy it considered the uncontrolled boiler data set.\nSpecifically, the controlled data set derives from the EPA’s\n“New Source Performance Standards” (NSPS) data, which, in\n\f                               128\n\nthe Agency’s view, could be used to set the non-Hg-metal\nGACT standard for boilers with a heat input capacity of 30\nmmBtu/hr or greater but did not suffice for boilers with a\nlower heat input capacity. For this reason, the EPA examined\nits original data set, found that none of the coal-fired boilers\nin that set used control technology and, accordingly, set the\nGACT numeric standard at the emissions level achieved by\nthe best performing uncontrolled source in that data set (i.e.,\n0.42 lb/mmBtu). We are satisfied that the EPA exercised its\ndiscretion in a reasoned manner and, accordingly, we do not\ndisturb it. See Transactive Corp., 91 F.3d at 236.\n\n     Next, the Environmental Petitioners challenge the EPA’s\ndecision to establish a tune-up requirement as a GACT\nmanagement-practice standard for Hg and POM emissions\nfrom large biomass-fired and oil-fired boilers. In their view,\nother, more restrictive control technologies, including\nmulticlones,38 are “generally available” and their availability\nmandates that the EPA set numeric standards based on boilers\nthat use those controls. But the EPA explained its approach:\n\n         A boiler tune-up requirement would potentially\n         result in the same non-mercury metallic HAP\n         reduction as a PM emission limit based on\n         performance of multiclones but would also\n         reduce emissions of organic HAP. In addition\n         the cost of a boiler tune-up appears minimal\n         compared to the cost for testing and\n\n\n    38\n         A multiclone is a PM “mechanical separator[].” See 2010\nProposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,908. It diverts\nparticles from the exhaust stream by creating a circular air flow.\nSee id.\n\f                             129\n\n       monitoring to demonstrate compliance with an\n       emission limit.\n\nSee 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,908.\nThe EPA also explained that multiclones were “minimally\neffective” for controlling non-Hg metals, ineffective for POM\nand Hg, and expensive. Id. Because the EPA’s decision to\nimpose a tune-up requirement fits within its “technical\nexpertise,” we owe the Agency an “extreme degree of\ndeference” so long as its explanation is rational.

EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187435\"><a href=\"/opinion/187435/catawba-county-nc-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (D.C.

Cir.\n2003)). And because its explanation was rational, we reject\nthe Petitioners’ challenge thereto.\n\n     Finally, the Petitioners challenge the EPA’s decision to\nset a tune-up requirement as a management-practice standard\nfor small biomass-fired and oil-fired area boilers. The EPA\nadopted this approach because measuring PM emissions for\nsmaller boilers is “not feasible.” 2010 Proposed Area Boilers\nRule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,906. When the EPA explained its\ndecision regarding small biomass-fired and oil-fired area\nboilers, it provided the same reasons it gave for its use of a\ntune-up requirement for small coal-fired area boilers, which\nwe address (and uphold), infra, § IV.M. For those reasons,\nwe reject the challenge to the EPA’s tune-up requirement for\nsmall biomass-fired and oil-fired area boilers.\n\n               I. 30-DAY ROLLING AVERAGE\n\n     As discussed, see supra § I.B.1.a, when the EPA sets a\nMACT floor, it begins by examining data generated by stack\ntesting. Once the MACT standard is established, however, a\nsource may (and in some cases, must) demonstrate\ncompliance by implementing “continuous monitoring” instead\n\f                               130\n\nof conducting additional stack tests.39 See 2011 Proposed\nCISWI Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,464-65.\nFor a source using a continuous monitor, the EPA determines\nMACT-standard compliance based on the source’s thirty-day\n“rolling average.” Id. at 80,465.\n\n     The calculation of a thirty-day rolling average is\nstraightforward: the average of a source’s daily emissions for\nthe immediately preceding thirty days. Each day produces a\nnew rolling average and each “average is a separate\ncompliance determination.” No. 11-1125 EPA Br. 88 n.17.\nIn the EPA’s view, this “allow[s] operators sufficient\nflexibility for operational and control device adjustments\nshould they be needed for short term fuel or waste\ncharacteristics variability.” 2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on\nReconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,465. The EPA also\nconcluded that thirty-day rolling average violations will occur\nalmost as frequently as violations of shorter rolling-average\nperiods. Id.\n\n     The CAA vests the EPA with authority to “prescribe\nprocedures and methods for determining compliance and for\nmonitoring and analysis of pollutants.” 42 U.S.C. § 7661c(b).\nWe have emphasized that the EPA has “broad discretion in\nselecting a monitoring regime that ensures compliance, and as\nlong as it reasonably articulate[s] the basis for its decision,\n[we] will defer to the informed discretion of the Agency,\n\n    39\n         As the name suggests, a continuous monitoring system\nmeasures the source’s emissions at all times and generally takes one\nof two forms: (1) a continuous parameter monitor, which measures,\ne.g., a source’s temperature, pressure or oxygen content; or (2) a\ncontinuous emissions monitor, which measures the pollutant\nconcentration in the source’s emissions.\n\f                               131\n\nrecognizing that analysis of this issue requires a high level of\nexpertise.” White Stallion Energy Ctr., LLC v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2699</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015). Notwithstanding\nthis deference, the Environmental Petitioners argue that\nallowing a source to demonstrate compliance by way of a\nthirty-day rolling average not only fails Chevron review but is\nalso arbitrary. We disagree.\n\n     First, they argue that the thirty-day rolling average fails at\nChevron step 1 because it allows sources to emit HAPs\ncontinuously at the UPL-established MACT floor. Because\nthey do not believe that the UPL represents the average\nemissions level achieved by the best performing sources, they\nargue that, ipso facto, allowing sources to continuously emit\nHAPs at the UPL level means that sources are permitted to\nemit at levels higher than the average levels achieved by the\nbest performing sources. Because we have already concluded\nthat the UPL is in fact a reasonable proxy for the average\nemissions level achieved by the best performing sources, see\nsupra § IV.C, the Environmental Petitioners’ premise is\ninaccurate. And because the “total emissions from a unit\ncomplying with a rolling average must still be below the total\nemissions from a unit emitting continuously at the level of the\nstandard,” No. 11-1125 EPA Br. 90, the Environmental\nPetitioners’ Chevron step 1 argument fails.\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners’ Chevron step 2 argument\nfares no better. The EPA explained that (1) it expects to catch\nviolations using a thirty-day rolling average “almost as much\nas for a shorter term average” and (2) it believes the longer\naverage to be more effective in addressing “[c]oncerns of\nvariability outside the operators[’] control such as fuel\n\f                                132\n\ncontent, seasonal factors, load cycling, and infrequent hours\nof needed operation.” 2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on\nReconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,465. Because the EPA\n“reasonably articulate[d] the basis for its decision,” we uphold\nit. White Stallion, 748 F.3d at 1255 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n     Finally, we conclude that the EPA’s allowance of thirty-\nday rolling averaging does not reflect an arbitrary change in\nposition. Although the Petitioners cite other rules that, in\ntheir view, manifest that the EPA once believed that longer\naveraging periods resulted in less stringent enforcement, most\nof the rules they cite have nothing to do with MACT-setting\nor MACT compliance40 and none evidences an unexplained or\nunjustified deviation. Similarly, the Petitioners point to the\nEPA’s explanation in the 2011 CISWI Rule that “24-hour\nblock averages . . . would be inconsistent with the sampling\ntime for the stack test data” to indicate an arbitrary change in\nposition. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,728. But the EPA made this\nstatement while discussing why stack-test data and\ncontinuous-monitoring data could not be used in tandem to set\na MACT level, which says nothing about allowing emissions\n\n    40\n         The only exception is the EPA’s 1996 Medical-Waste\nIncinerators Rule, which provides that “[t]he period of time over\nwhich emissions are measured and then averaged to determine\ncompliance with the regulation . . . must correspond to the period of\ntime over which emission levels were measured and averaged in\ndetermining the emission limits included in the regulation.”\nStandards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and\nEmission Guidelines for Existing Sources: Medical Waste\nIncinerators, 61 Fed. Reg. 31,736, 31,748 (June 20, 1996). This\ntwenty-year-old statement, however, does not detract from the\nEPA’s well-reasoned defense of the thirty-day rolling average in\nthe CISWI Rule.\n\f                              133\n\naveraging—long-term or otherwise—to gauge MACT-floor\ncompliance. See id. And even if the Environmental\nPetitioners had directed us to a real about-face, the EPA’s\njustification for allowing the thirty-day rolling average\nconvinces us that any change was not arbitrary.\n\n       J. FUEL-COMBUSTION-BASED SUBCATEGORIES\n\n    Section 7412 provides that the EPA may distinguish\namong “classes, types, and sizes” of sources when\nestablishing emission standards. 42 U.S.C. § 7412(c), (d)(1).\nUnder this authority, the EPA created subcategories of major\nsource boilers based on the fuel the boiler was designed to\nburn. 2013 Major Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,144. The\nEnvironmental Petitioners challenge this decision on three\ngrounds: First, they claim that the text of the statute\nforecloses the EPA from creating such subcategories. Next,\nthey argue that the EPA’s subcategories are arbitrary because\nthey permit a boiler to switch subcategories from year to year.\nFinally, they contend that the EPA’s action was arbitrary\nbecause the Agency failed to demonstrate with substantial\nevidence that burning a different fuel alters the boiler’s class,\ntype, or size.\n\n     These arguments fail. Section 7412(d) gives the EPA\ndiscretion to create subcategories based on boiler type, and\nnothing in the statute forecloses the Agency from doing so\nbased on the type of fuel a boiler was designed to burn. Nor\nwas the EPA’s decision to create such subcategories arbitrary\nand capricious. The Agency considered the relevant factors in\ncoming to a reasoned decision that the type of fuel a boiler is\ndesigned to burn impacts the feasibility of emission standards.\nAnd, finally, the EPA based its technical judgment on\nsufficient record evidence. As a result, we deny the\n\f                              134\n\nEnvironmental Petitioners’ challenge to the EPA’s\nsubcategorization of major source boilers based on the type of\nfuel the boiler is designed to burn.\n\n      The Environmental Petitioners first claim that the text of\nthe CAA forecloses the EPA from creating subcategories of\n“types” of boilers based on the fuel a boiler burns because a\nsingle boiler may use different fuels over the course of its\nlifetime. This may be true, but the Petitioners never explain\nwhat it is about the word “type” that bars the EPA from\nregulating a boiler that burns “x” differently from a boiler that\nburns “y.” According to its ordinary meaning, “type” is easily\nbroad enough to accommodate changes in boiler\ncharacteristics from year to year. See OXFORD ENGLISH\nDICTIONARY (2013) (defining “type” as a “general form,\nstructure, or character distinguishing a particular kind, group,\nor class of beings or objects”). There is no textual reason then\nto assume that a boiler’s type must be written in stone.\n\n     Nor does our understanding of “type” write it out of the\nstatute, as the Petitioners contend. The EPA has done what\nthe term plainly encompasses: it has distinguished among\nboilers based on the kind of fuel the boiler burned over the\nlast year. It is thus not surprising that we have interpreted a\nsimilar provision to permit distinctions based on fuel inputs.\nSee Sierra Club v. Costle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393674\"><a href=\"/opinion/393674/sierra-club-v-douglas-m-costle-administrator-of-the-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318-19 (D.C.

Likewise, we conclude\nthat section 7412’s undefined and unrestricted use of class,\ntype, or size does not foreclose the EPA’s interpretation.\n\f                             135\n\n     This court will, as a result, defer to the EPA’s\ninterpretation so long as it is reasonable.

The Agency\nexplained that boilers vary in their designs depending on the\ntype of fuel they burn. 2010 Proposed Major Boilers Rule, 75\nFed. Reg. at 32,016-17. These differences, according to the\nAgency, affect boiler emissions and the feasibility of emission\ncontrols. Id. And, because design constraints also restrict a\nboiler’s ability to switch fuels, the Agency concluded that it\ncould determine a boiler’s type by looking at the fuel it had\nburned over the previous 12-month period. Id. at 32,014.\nThe Environmental Petitioners point to nothing in the record\nthat calls into question either of these technical judgments,\nwhich receive great deference. See NRDC I, 489 F.3d at\n1375. Nor do the Petitioners offer any additional reasons in\nsupport of their argument that the Agency has ventured\nbeyond its authority under the statute. In fact, the EPA’s\nreasoning from the emissions data is consistent with the very\nexistence of a subcategorization authority because the grant of\nthis authority implicitly acknowledges that the EPA may need\nto set different emission standards within a category of major\nsources based on what is achievable for a subset of those\nsources. Because the statutory text readily encompasses the\nEPA’s interpretation for the reasons explained above, and\nbecause the Environmental Petitioners offer no additional\nargument as to why the EPA’s interpretation was\nunreasonable, we reject the Petitioners’ Chevron challenge to\nthe EPA’s interpretation of its subcategorization authority.\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners nevertheless claim that the\nEPA’s subcategories are arbitrary because a boiler is not of a\ndifferent type when it can be a boiler “designed to burn coal”\none year, and a boiler “designed to burn biomass” the next.\nBut this argument fails for the same reasons as the Chevron\n\f                              136\n\nargument we just rejected. The fact that boilers may switch\nfrom one type to another over time does not, alone, render a\nsubcategorization arbitrary. With no discernable basis to find\nthe EPA’s choice here questionable, much less arbitrary, we\nreject this argument too.\n\n     Finally, the Environmental Petitioners contend that the\nAgency failed to demonstrate with sufficient evidence, rather\nthan mere assertions, that burning a different fuel makes the\nboiler a different class, type, or size. The Petitioners largely\nfail to develop this argument and, regardless, the EPA easily\nmet its burden. The EPA based its decision on documented\nemissions data, several reports provided by the National\nEnergy Technology Laboratory on boiler operations, and\noperating manuals provided by boiler manufacturers. See,\ne.g., Summary of Public Comments and Responses for\nNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for\nMajor Sources: Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional\nBoilers and Process Heaters, EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0058-\n3511-A1 (Dec. 2012), at 558-63. These sources support the\nEPA’s decision to distinguish boilers based on the type of fuel\nthey are designed to burn and the Agency’s conclusion that\nboilers designed for one fuel type are unlikely to use another\nfuel type. Id. The Petitioners present no contrary evidence,\nnor do they attack the validity or accuracy of the data that the\nEPA relied upon. We thus find no merit in the Petitioners’\nvarious challenges to the EPA’s decision to subcategorize\nmajor boilers based on the fuel the boiler is designed to burn.\n\n   K. “UNITS THAT BEGIN COMBUSTING SOLID WASTE”\n               AS “EXISTING” SOURCES\n\n    Section 7429(a)(2) distinguishes between “existing” and\n“new” CISWI units. The former must comply with floors set\n\f                              137\n\nat the “average emissions limitation achieved by the best\nperforming 12 percent of units” and the latter must comply\nwith stricter floors set at the level achieved by “the best\ncontrolled similar unit.” 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2). “Modified”\nunits, defined as units “at which modifications have occurred”\nthat either experience changes that cost more than 50 per cent\nof the original construction price or result in increased\nemissions, see id. § 7429(g)(3), must be treated as “new,” see\nid. § 7429(g)(2).\n\n     The preamble to the 2011 CISWI Rule states, “[u]nits\nthat begin combusting solid waste are considered existing\nsources.”       76 Fed. Reg. at 15,714 (emphasis added).\nCommentators objected that this blanket statement\ncontravened the Act’s plain terms, which mandate that the\nEPA treat such sources as “new,” not “existing,” if they meet\nthe section 7429(g)(3) requirements. In its subsequent 2011\nProposed CISWI Rule on Reconsideration, the EPA refined\nits position: “An existing source will not be considered a new\nsource solely due to a combustion material switch. Assuming\nnew source applicability is not triggered, existing sources that\nchange fuels or materials are considered existing\nsources . . . .” 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,459.\n\n     The Environmental Petitioners argue that the EPA’s\nbroad statement in the 2011 CISWI Rule indicates that it\nimpermissibly changed its treatment of “modified sources” in\ncontravention of the CAA. The EPA, however, agrees that\nany CISWI unit fitting the statutory criteria for a modified\nsource must comply with new-unit MACT levels, not\nexisting-unit MACT levels. See 42 U.S.C § 7429(g)(2). It\nalso recognizes that its categorical statement in the 2011\nCISWI Rule “may have been imprecise” and, in any event, it\n\f                              138\n\nargues that the Environmental Petitioners have taken its\nstatement out of context. See No. 11-1125 EPA Br. 73.\n\n     We agree with the Agency. The EPA’s later statement\nmade clear that it intended to treat “sources that change fuels\nor materials” as “existing sources” unless “new source\napplicability,” as mandated by the Act, is “triggered.” See\n2011 Proposed CISWI Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 80,459. Moreover, the Agency provided its more precise\nstatement while discussing specifically what constitutes a\n“modification” for the CISWI Rule. See id. (“An existing\nsource will not be considered a new source solely due to a\ncombustion material switch.”).          It made its earlier,\n“imprecise” comment, in contrast, while describing when a\nfuel change could mean the difference between regulation\nunder section 7412 or section 7429. See 2011 CISWI Rule,\n76 Fed. Reg. at 15,714. Convinced that the EPA has not\nimpermissibly changed the statutory definition of “modified”\nCISWI, we reject the Petitioners’ challenge.\n\n  L. EXCLUSION OF “TEMPORARY” BOILERS FROM AREA\n                   BOILERS RULE\n\n     In the final 2013 Area Boilers Rule, the EPA excluded\n“temporary boilers” from regulation under section 7412. See\n78 Fed. Reg. at 7,491. The Rule defined “temporary boilers”\nas “any gaseous or liquid fuel boiler that is designed to, and is\ncapable of, being carried or moved from one location to\nanother by means of, for example, wheels, skids, carrying\nhandles, dollies, trailers, or platforms.” Id. Moreover, a\nboiler is not a temporary boiler if any of the following apply:\n\f                              139\n\n   (1)   The equipment is attached to a foundation.\n\n   (2)   The boiler or a replacement remains at a\n         location within the facility and performs the\n         same or similar function for more than 12\n         consecutive months, unless the regulatory\n         agency approves an extension. An extension\n         may be granted by the regulatory agency\n         upon petition by the owner or operator of a\n         unit specifying the basis for such a request.\n         Any temporary boiler that replaces a\n         temporary boiler at a location within the\n         facility and performs the same or similar\n         function will be included in calculating the\n         consecutive time period unless there is a gap\n         in operation of 12 months or more.\n\n   (3)   The equipment is located at a seasonal\n         facility and operates during the full annual\n         operating period of the seasonal facility,\n         remains at the facility for at least 2 years, and\n         operates at that facility for at least 3 months\n         of each year.\n\n   (4)   The equipment is moved from one location\n         to another within the facility but continues to\n         perform the same or similar function and\n         serve the same electricity, steam, and/or hot\n         water system in an attempt to circumvent the\n         residence time requirements of this\n         definition.\n\n2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,491-92.\n\f                              140\n\n    Environmental Petitioners challenge this exclusion as a\nviolation of the EPA’s obligations under the CAA to regulate\nall boilers listed under section 7412. By its own terms, the\n2011 Area Boilers Rule “applies to all existing and new\nindustrial boilers, institutional boilers, and commercial boilers\nlocated at area sources. Boiler means an enclosed combustion\ndevice having the primary purpose of recovering thermal\nenergy in the form of steam or hot water.” 76 Fed. Reg. at\n15,557; see also 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,554 (“EPA is\npromulgating national emission standards for control of\nhazardous air pollutants from two area source categories:\nIndustrial boilers and commercial and institutional boilers.”).\nEnvironmental Petitioners claim the general term “boiler”\nnecessarily encompasses temporary boilers: “[T]he category\nof ‘boilers’ plainly includes temporary boilers, just as the\ncategory of ‘courts’ includes federal courts, or the category of\n‘dogs’ includes brown dogs.” No. 11-1141, Envtl. Pet’rs’\nReply Br. 7. According to Petitioners, then, sections 7412(c)\nand 7412(d) of the CAA require the EPA to issue emission\nstandards for temporary boilers as well as “permanent”\nboilers. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(c)(2) (“For the categories and\nsubcategories            the          Administrator         lists,\nthe Administrator shall establish emission standards . . . .”);\nid. § 7412(d)(1) (“The Administrator shall promulgate\nregulations establishing emission standards for each category\nor subcategory of major sources and area sources of\nhazardous air pollutants listed for regulation . . . .”).\n\n    To the extent Environmental Petitioners challenge as\nunreasonable the EPA’s justifications for declining to set\nemission standards for temporary boilers, they cannot prevail.\n“Under       arbitrary-and-capricious     review,      EPA’s\ndeterminations are presumptively valid provided [they] meet[]\na minimum rationality standard.” Nat’l Ass’n for Surface\n\f                              141\n\nFinishing, 795 F.3d at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSo the question is whether the EPA offered a sufficiently\nrational explanation for its exclusion of temporary boilers.\nThe EPA has done so here. First, contrary to Petitioners’\nclaims, temporary boilers were never considered an\ninexorable part of the “industrial boiler” category section\n7412 requires the EPA to regulate. While the EPA only\nlisted generic area source categories—“industrial boilers” and\n“institutional/commercial boilers”—in its 1999 rulemaking, it\nhas since refined these broad categories pursuant to its\nstatutory authority. See National Air Toxics Program: The\nIntegrated Urban Strategy, 64 Fed. Reg. 38,706, 38,721 tbl.2\n(July 19, 1999). In doing so, the EPA excluded several other\nsubgroups of boilers that might otherwise be read as falling\nunder one of the general boiler categories. See, e.g., 2013\nArea Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,492 (excluding boilers\nalready regulated by other MACT standards); 2011 Proposed\nArea Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed. Reg. at 80,539\n(excluding electric and residential boilers as not part of either\nsource category). The EPA’s clarification that temporary\nboilers were never considered part of the “industrial boilers”\ncategory was simply another refinement, as contemplated by\nthe statute. See 42 U.S.C § 7412(e)(4) (precluding judicial\nreview until the EPA has issued its final emission standards\nfor a category or subcategory).\n\n     Second, as both the EPA and Industry Intervenors note,\nthe parallel rule for major source boilers has always explicitly\nexcluded temporary boilers from its “industrial boiler”\ncategorization. See 40 C.F.R. § 63.7491(j). The EPA thus\nconsidered commenters’ requests to add a similar clarification\nto the 2013 Area Boilers Rule and reasonably decided to do\nso.    See, e.g., American Forest & Paper Association,\nComments on Proposed Area Source Rule (AF&PA\n\f                              142\n\nComments), EPA-HQ-OAR-2006-0790-1939 (Aug. 23,\n2010), at 58 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 389). EPA explained this\nchoice in its proposed rule:\n\n       Owners and operators of regulated sources\n       have pointed out that temporary boilers are\n       small (less than 10 MMBtu/hr heat input) and\n       are generally owned and operated by\n       contractors, rather than the facility. As a\n       result, they are not included in the facility’s\n       operating permits because state and federal\n       CAA operating permit programs have\n       historically   classified    such      units    as\n       insignificant sources.      The owners and\n       operators also noted that compliance with the\n       work practice requirements applicable to these\n       small boilers would be complicated because\n       they are typically located on site for less than a\n       year, but would be subject to biennial\n       management practice requirements. We agree\n       that the source category identified in subpart\n       JJJJJJ should specifically exclude these\n       temporary boilers because they have been\n       considered insignificant sources, and were not\n       included in the EPA’s analysis of the source\n       category.\n\n2011 Proposed Area Boilers Rule on Reconsideration, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 80,535.\n\n    The unique nature of temporary boilers favors their\nexclusion. These boilers tend to be rented for use on a\ntemporary basis and come in “shop-fabricated package\ndesigns.” AF&PA Comments, at 58 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 389).\n\f                               143\n\nTemporary boilers also “typically only fire gas or liquid fossil\nfuels (natural gas or distillate oil) which may be cleaner than\nthe boiler(s) they are temporarily replacing. In addition, these\nunits often do not have exhaust stacks that meet EPA Method\n1 requirements for application of test methods.”               Id.\nRegardless, during the rulemaking, Environmental Petitioners\nargued the EPA had “not explained why this is a distinction\nthat justifies differential treatment, let alone an exemption.”\nSee Area Boilers Rule—Responses to Comments, at 65. The\nEPA responded by explaining that rather than having “created\na category or subcategory of ‘temporary boilers’ and then\nexempted them from the standards,” the Agency never\n“intend[ed] to regulate temporary boilers under the area\nsource standards” in the first place. See id. The EPA further\nnoted that, “[b]y their nature of being temporary, these boilers\noperate in place of another non-temporary boiler while that\nboiler is being constructed, replaced or repaired, in which\ncase we counted the non-temporary boiler as the one being\nregulated.” Id. Finally, the Agency concluded regulation of\ntemporary boilers was not necessary to meet its statutory\nemission requirements under sections 7412(c)(6) and\n7412(c)(3) of the CAA. Id. In its final rule, the EPA\nreiterated this explanation: “Similar to residential boilers, we\ndid not intend to regulate temporary boilers under the area\nsource standards because they are not part of either the\nindustrial      boiler      source      category      or      the\ncommercial/institutional boiler source category.” 2013 Area\nBoilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,491. The final regulation also\nincluded a detailed explanation of how EPA decided on its\nlimited definition of “temporary boilers.” See id. at 7,499.\n\n   The evidence before the Agency supported its decision to\nexclude temporary boilers. Indeed, the EPA “cogently\nexplain[ed]” why it exercised its discretion in this manner,\n\f                               144\n\nsuch that this court concludes the Agency’s choice “was the\nproduct of reasoned decision making.” U.S. Telecom Ass’n v.\nFCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770512\"><a href=\"/opinion/770512/united-states-telecom-associationpetitioners-v-federal-communications/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (D.C. Cir. 2000). We therefore\nuphold the EPA’s exclusion of temporary boilers from\nregulation of area source boilers.\n\n    M. WORK-PRACTICE STANDARDS FOR COAL-FIRED\n                    BOILERS\n\n     When setting emission limits for area sources, the EPA\nenjoys greater discretion than when setting limits for major\nsources. With respect to major sources, the EPA has to\npromulgate MACT standards, see 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2),\nwhereas for area sources the EPA can generally promulgate\nmore lenient GACT standards, see id. § 7412(d)(5). The\nCAA, however, singles out seven particularly hazardous\npollutants that require stricter regulatory standards, even for\narea sources.41 Under section 7412(c)(6), the EPA must “list\ncategories and subcategories of sources assuring that sources\naccounting for not less than 90 per centum of the aggregate\nemissions of each such pollutant” are regulated. The EPA\nlisted a variety of area sources under section 7412(c)(6) in its\n1998 rulemaking based on their Hg and POM emissions. See\nProposed 2010 Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,898;\nSource Category Listing for Section 112(d)(2) Rulemaking\nPursuant to Section 112(c)(6) Requirements, 63 Fed. Reg.\n17,838, 17,849-50 (Apr. 10, 1998).            But the Agency\nsubsequently refined that list and ultimately concluded only\n\n    41\n         These seven pollutants are: (i) alkylated lead compounds,\n(ii) polycyclic organic matter (POM), (iii) hexachlorobenzene, (iv)\nmercury (Hg), (v) polychlorinated biphenyls, (vi) 2,3,7,8-\ntetrachlorodibenzofurans, and (vii) 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-\ndioxin. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(c)(6).\n\f                               145\n\ncoal-fired area boilers needed to be listed to meet the statute’s\n90 per cent emissions threshold. See 2010 Proposed Area\nBoilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,898; see also No. 11-1141\nEPA Br. 14 (“[T]he coal-fired subcategory is responsible for\nover 82 percent of the mercury emissions from the [area\nsource] category in the inventory, even though it represents\nonly 2 percent of the boilers in the category.”).\n\n     Under section 7412(c)(6), the EPA was therefore\nrequired to set either a MACT limit under section 7412(d)(2),\na health threshold under section 7412(d)(4), or a work-\npractice standard under section 7412(h) for all coal-fired\nboilers. The Agency chose to set MACT numerical emission\nlimits for Hg and CO42 at new and existing large coal-fired\nboilers. 2013 Area Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,488.\nHowever, the EPA found it “technologically and\neconomically impracticable to apply [its] measurement\nmethodology to . . . small sources,” and so it chose to institute\na work-practice standard43 for all new and existing small coal-\nfired boilers. Id. at 7,488-89. This work-practice standard\nrequires small coal-fired units to be periodically tuned up but\ndoes not impose any numeric emission limit. See id. The\nEPA similarly decided that, for large coal-fired boilers\nundergoing a startup or a shutdown, a work-practice\nstandard—rather than a numeric emission standard—was\n\n    42\n          Because the EPA chose to regulate POM emissions\nindirectly—by using CO emissions as a surrogate—the standards it\nset under section 7412(c)(6) are for CO rather than POM. See 2013\nArea Boilers Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 7,488, 7,503.\n    43\n        In their brief, Environmental Petitioners alternate between\nthe terms “operational standards” and “work-practice standards,”\nboth of which fall under section 7412(d)(2)(D). This opinion will\nuse “work-practice standards” for simplicity.\n\f                             146\n\nmost practicable. See id. at 7,518 tbl.2 (requiring owners of\nlarge “[e]xisting or new coal-fired” boilers to “[m]inimize the\nboiler’s startup and shutdown periods and conduct startups\nand shutdowns according to the manufacturer’s recommended\nprocedures”).\n\n      Environmental Petitioners challenge the EPA’s decision\nto employ work-practice standards as a violation of\n7412(d)(2)’s mandate to achieve the “maximum degree of\nreduction in emissions.” We examine Petitioner’s statutory\nargument step-by-step, as it hinges on the interplay between\nseveral statutory provisions. First, section 7412(c)(6)—which\ngoverns regulation of Hg and POM emissions—requires the\nAdministrator to regulate sources of these pollutants under\neither section 7412(d)(2) or (d)(4). Section 7412(d)(4) allows\nthe Administrator to establish health-based emission\nstandards; it is not implicated here. Instead, the EPA decided\nto regulate coal-fired boilers under section 7412(d)(2).\nSection 7412(d)(2) instructs the Administrator to achieve “the\nmaximum degree of reduction in emissions of the hazardous\nair pollutants . . . that the Administrator, taking into\nconsideration the cost of achieving such emissions reduction,\nand any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and\nenergy requirements, determines is achievable for new or\nexisting sources.” The Administrator is authorized to use\nseveral means to achieve this reduction including\nimplementing “design, equipment, work practice, or\noperational standards . . . as provided in [section 7412(h)].”\n42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2)(D). Section 7412(h)(1) states: “[I]f it\nis not feasible in the judgment of the Administrator to\nprescribe or enforce an emission standard for control of a\n[pollutant], the Administrator may, in lieu thereof, promulgate\na . . . work-practice    standard . . . ,   which      in   the\nAdministrator’s judgment is consistent with the provisions of\n\f                              147\n\nsubsection (d) or (f) of this section.” Petitioners do not\ndispute the EPA’s ability to set work-practice standards here;\nthey instead focus on section 7412(h)’s requirement that any\nsuch standards be “consistent with” subsection (d)—which\nrequires the “maximum degree of reduction in emissions.”\nAccording to Petitioners, the EPA’s decision to set these\nparticular work-practice standards fails at both Chevron steps.\n\n     With respect to Chevron step 1, Petitioners argue the\n“EPA does not claim the operational standards [for coal-fired\nboilers] are ‘consistent with the provisions of subsection (d)\nor (f)’ of § 7412.” No. 11-1141 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 33. In other\nwords, because these work-practice standards “do not even\npurport” to be consistent with section 7412(d)’s mandate to\nmaximize reduction of emissions, “they are unlawful under\nChevron step one.” Id. Petitioners point to the EPA’s\nspecific findings to support this claim: for large coal-fired\nboilers, the EPA found that mercury emissions could be\nreduced by 75 to 82 per cent through the use of a fabric filter.\nId. But, according to Petitioners, the “EPA admits the tune-\nup program [for small coal-fired boilers] will reduce\nemissions by only one percent.” Id. And, with respect to\nlarge coal-fired boilers undergoing startup or shutdown,\nPetitioners argue the “EPA does not claim that ‘following the\nmanufacturer’s recommended procedures’ during startup and\nshutdown will reduce emissions at all.” Id.\n\n     At the familiar Chevron step 1, the court must “first\nexamine the statute de novo, employing traditional tools of\nstatutory construction.” Nat’l Ass’n of Clean Air Agencies,\n489 F.3d at 1228 (internal quotation marks omitted). If the\nCongress’s intent is clear, then the Agency’s interpretation is\nafforded no deference, and the court “must give effect to the\nunambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Id.\n\f                              148\n\n     In this case, Environmental Petitioners place too much\nemphasis on certain snippets of the statute without examining\nthe larger context. For one, Petitioners seem to argue that the\nEPA must adopt work-practice standards that result in the\nmaximum possible reduction of emissions, without taking into\naccount any other considerations. But section 7412(d)(2)\nitself belies this claim: it says the EPA must promulgate\nstandards that require “the maximum degree of reduction in\nemissions . . . that the Administrator, taking into\nconsideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction,\nand any non-air quality health and environmental impacts\nand energy requirements, determines is achievable.” 42\nU.S.C. § 7412(d)(2) (emphasis added). This portion of the\nstatute explicitly defers to the Administrator’s judgment\nregarding a standard’s “achievability,” even though it directs\nhim to consider particular factors in making that assessment.\nSection 7412(h) similarly requires the Administrator to adopt\na work-practice standard that in his judgment is consistent\nwith section 7412(d)(2)’s mandate. We therefore cannot\naccept Petitioners’ suggestion that Congress unambiguously\nrequired the EPA to adopt standards that result in the\nmaximum reduction of emissions that is technologically\nfeasible.\n\n     Environmental Petitioners’ challenge to these work-\npractice standards as unreasonable under Chevron step 2 and\narbitrary under State Farm presents a closer call. With\nrespect to Chevron step 2, the court must “uphold an agency’s\ninterpretation if it is reasonable.” Ariz. Pub. Serv. Co. v.

And, “even where\nEPA’s construction satisfies Chevron, [the court] still must\nensure that its action is not otherwise arbitrary and capricious.\nThe arbitrary and capricious standard is ‘[h]ighly deferential,’\nand it ‘presumes the validity of agency action.’” Nat’l Ass’n\n\f                             149\n\nof Clean Air Agencies, 489 F.3d at 1228 (citations omitted).\nAs long as an agency has “considered the relevant factors and\narticulated ‘a rational connection between the facts found and\nthe choice made,’” then its decision must be upheld. Allied\nLocal & Reg’l Mfrs. Caucus, 215 F.3d at 68.\n\n     Petitioners mount both a “facial” and a substantive\nchallenge to the EPA’s rationale for adopting work-practice\nstandards. First, Petitioners claim the EPA’s decision is\narbitrary because it fails “to reconcile its approach with the\nstatutory requirement [of section 7412(d)(2)].” No. 11-1141\nEnvtl. Pet’rs’ Br. 34. Specifically, Petitioners insist the EPA\nmust explicitly state somewhere that these particular work-\npractice standards are “consistent” with section 7412(d)(2).\nSee id. at 33-34. Otherwise, Petitioners contend, the Court\nmust simply “assume that the Agency heeded § 7412(h)’s\n‘consistent with’ requirement, notwithstanding the EPA’s\nfailure to acknowledge and apply that requirement in the\nrecord.” No. 11-1141 Envtl. Pet’rs’ Reply Br. 10.\n\n      The Agency responds that, “by identifying the tune-up\nand startup/shutdown requirements as ‘work practices,’ [it] is\nstating that those standards are issued under section 7412(h)\nand are consistent with the requirements of section 7412(d)\n(i.e., MACT).” No. 11-1141, EPA Br. 71. The EPA did\nacknowledge it has an obligation to maximize emission\nreductions under section 7412(d)(2) when promulgating\nwork-practice standards. See 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,568 (“CAA section 112(h) authorizes the\nAdministrator to promulgate [a work-practice standard]\nconsistent with the provisions of CAA sections 112(d) or\n(f) . . . .”). However, Petitioners are correct that the Agency\ndid not make a finding on the record that these work-practice\n\f                             150\n\nstandards would achieve the highest emissions reduction\npossible.\n\n     But the lack of an explicit statement does not\nautomatically condemn this portion of the rule. See Bowman,\n419 U.S. at 286 (“[W]e will uphold a decision of less than\nideal clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be\ndiscerned.”). The Petitioners offer no support for their\ncontention that the EPA must make an express finding that its\nstandards are “consistent” with section 7412(d)(2). Nor does\nour conclusion requires us to merely “assume” that the\nAgency’s actions comport with section 7412(d)(2). Instead,\nas we usually do when presented with such arguments, we\nreview the rulemaking record to determine whether the\njustifications the EPA offered for adopting these work\npractices standards were permissible.\n\n                1. Small Coal-Fired Boilers\n\n     First, with respect to small coal-fired boilers, the EPA\ndetermined that a biennial tune-up requirement would best\ncomply with section 7412(h)’s requirements. As a starting\npoint, the EPA surveyed a sample of state regulations\nmandating various work-practice standards for small coal-\nfired boilers; the Agency found that ten states required tune-\nups, two required periodic inspections, one required operator\ntraining, and one required operation in accordance with\nmanufacturer specifications. 2011 Area Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,573-74. The EPA thus concluded that tune-ups\nwere the most typical work-practice standard employed for\nthis type of boiler. Id. The Agency also found that regular\ntune-ups could lower HAP emissions by increasing the\nefficiency of small coal-fired boilers. See id. at 15,575 (“A\ntune-up performed to the manufacturer’s specifications would\n\f                              151\n\nensure the highest energy efficiency and reduce fuel usage,\nwhich will ultimately reduce HAP emissions.”); see also 2010\nProposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,908 (“A\nboiler tune-up provides potential savings from energy\nefficiency improvements and pollution prevention. . . . In\naddition, the cost of a boiler tune-up appears minimal\ncompared to the cost for testing and monitoring to\ndemonstrate compliance with an emission limit.”).44\n\n     The EPA elected to implement a work-practice standard\nbecause the typical method used to measure emissions of Hg\nand CO could not be used to sample emissions from stacks\nwith small diameters (less than 12 inches). See 2011 Area\nBoilers Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. at 15,568. Because many small\ncoal-fired boilers have stacks with diameters below 12\ninches—and because many of these boilers “do not currently\nhave sampling ports or a platform for accessing the exhaust\nstack”—the Agency concluded the cost of testing and\nmonitoring these small boilers would “present an excessive\nburden for smaller sources.” Id. The Agency’s consideration\nof cost effectiveness is particularly appropriate in this context\nbecause the “vast majority” of area source boilers are\n“generally owned and operated by small entities,” which\nwould be disproportionately burdened by a numeric emissions\nlimit. See Fact Sheet: Final Adjustments to the Air Toxics\nStandards for Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional\nBoilers at Area Source Facilities, 1, 2 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 684-\n\n    44\n        The EPA’s discussion of boiler tune-up advantages occurs\nmainly in the context of its decision to select a GACT standard\nrather than any numeric emission standards for certain boilers.\nEnvironmental Petitioners challenge this decision on similar\ngrounds, see supra § IV.H. But the benefits of periodic tune-ups\nalso apply to the coal-fired boilers at issue here.\n\f                               152\n\n85); see also 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg.\nat 31,906 (“The results of the analysis indicate that total\ncompliance costs exceed 3 percent (and can reach as high as\n19 percent) of the average firm revenues for 79 percent of the\nfacilities.”).\n\n      Environmental Petitioners counter that while tune-ups\nmay minimally reduce HAP emissions, they do not maximize\nthis reduction per section 7412(d)(2)’s mandate.45 But\nPetitioners view section 7412(d) too myopically; under that\nsection, the Administrator is empowered to adopt standards\nthat “tak[e] into consideration the cost of achieving such\nemission reduction.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2). The EPA here\nexamined the costs of imposing a numeric emission standard\non small coal-fired boilers and found that option “not\nfeasible” due to high costs and monitoring difficulties,\nconsiderations equally permissible under section 7412(d)(2).\nPetitioners argue that requiring the use of a fabric filter would\nhave resulted in greater reductions, but they are unable to\npoint to any small coal-fired boiler that currently uses such a\nfilter. See 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at\n31,906 (“For existing [small] area source boilers, the only\nwork practice being used that potentially controls mercury\n\n    45\n        Petitioners also point to a comment they made in the record\narguing that a tune-up standard “would not achieve emission\nreductions that are consistent with the definition of MACT,” and\nurge that the EPA never addressed these concerns. See National\nAssociation of Clean Air Agencies, Comments on EPA Proposals\nfor Regulation of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPS), EPA-HQ-\nOAR-2006-0790, EPA-HQ-OAR-2002-0058, EPA-HQ-OAR-\n2003-0119 (Aug. 23, 2010), at 21-22 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 417-18).\nBut this comment was specifically addressed to gas-fired boilers,\nand it is inapposite to the EPA’s consideration of standards for\ncoal-fired boilers.\n\f                             153\n\nand POM emissions is a boiler tune-up.”). Evidence before\nthe agency in fact indicated that the best performing small\ncoal boilers for POM emission use no add-on controls. See\nMemorandum from Amanda Singleton & Brandon Long,\nEastern Research Group, to Jim Eddinger, EPA\n(MACT/GACT Mem.), App. E-2a (No. 11-1141 J.A. 540). It\nwas therefore reasonable for the EPA, when considering\ncosts, to conclude that biennial tune-ups would allow for the\nmaximum “achievable” reduction in emissions.\n\n     Petitioners’ most compelling argument involves the\nEPA’s lack of data on small coal-fired boilers. As they point\nout, the EPA’s summary of its 2008 combustion survey makes\nno mention of any small coal-fired boilers.                 See\nMACT/GACT Mem., App. D-3, tbl.1 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 523).\nAnd the EPA never directly addressed whether control\ntechnologies, such as fabric filters, were useable by small\nboilers; “[t]he only claim EPA made in the record is that tune-\nups are the most effective option that [small] coal-fired\nboilers . . . are currently using, not that tune-ups yield the\nmaximum reduction ‘achievable.’” No. 11-1141 Envtl.\nPet’rs’ Reply Br. 11. In Sierra Club II, this court agreed with\nSierra Club’s challenge to the EPA’s use of a work-practice\nstandard instead of an emission floor because the “EPA never\ndetermined that measuring emissions from ceramics kilns was\nimpracticable; it determined only that it lacked emissions data\nfrom ceramics kilns. EPA thus had no basis under section\n7412(h) for using work practice standards.” 479 F.3d at 884.\nThat context is somewhat distinguishable, given that the\nstatute there explicitly required the EPA to make a\n“feasibility” finding (as discussed above), but it could be\nargued that the EPA here lacked the data to determine\nwhether tune-ups were “consistent with” section 7412(d)(2).\n\f                              154\n\n    Ultimately, though, the high level of deference afforded\nthe EPA counsels in favor of upholding this work-practice\nstandard. Although the EPA did not explicitly state that tune-\nups were the best option to reduce emissions while still\n“considering costs,” this finding can be inferred from the\nrecord as a whole. For instance, the EPA found that “[n]one\nof the States for which we have an inventory have an\napplicable emissions limit” for small coal-fired boilers, except\nNew Jersey, which actually has tune-ups as its work-practice\nstandard. 2010 Proposed Area Boilers Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at\n31,909. Based on these findings, it can reasonably be inferred\nthat—given the prevalence of these small boilers—at least a\nfew would be using a control technology if that were\ntechnologically or economically feasible. Because numeric\nemissions cannot easily be measured from these smaller\nsources and the costs of outfitting them with such technology\nwould be cost prohibitive, the EPA’s choice of tune-ups as the\nwork-practice standard is sufficiently reasonable to uphold\nunder both Chevron step 2 and State Farm. The Agency’s\nchoice is consistent with section 7412(h)’s “feasibility”\nrequirement and with section 7412(d)(2)’s instruction to\nmaximize emission reductions while also considering costs.\n\n   2. Large Coal-Fired Boilers Undergoing Startup or\n                      Shutdown\n\n    The record for large coal-fired boilers undergoing startup\nor shutdown is less extensive but again the EPA’s\ndetermination is reasonable. While large coal-fired boilers\nare required to meet numeric emission standards during\n“normal” operations, the EPA adopted a work-practice\nstandard for the temporary periods of startup and shutdown.\nSee 40 C.F.R. § 63.11214 (“[M]inimize the boiler’s startup\nand shutdown periods following the manufacturer’s\n\f                             155\n\nrecommended procedures, if available. If manufacturer’s\nrecommended procedures are not available, you must follow\nrecommended procedures for a unit of similar design for\nwhich manufacturer’s recommended procedures are\navailable.”). Environmental Petitioners contend that the EPA\nnever stated this practice would reduce emissions at all, and\ntherefore it has not met its burden under section 7412(d)(2).\nBut we have already explained that no express finding of\nconsistency with section 7412(d)(2) need be made. Here, the\nrecord suggests that the work-practice standard the Agency\nchose would reduce emissions, and we therefore can\n“reasonably [] discern[]” the Agency’s path. Bowman, 419\nU.S. at 286. Specifically, the EPA explained that requiring\nboilers to operate in startup and shutdown mode for\n“sufficient time to conduct the required test runs [to impose\nnumeric standards] could result in higher emissions than\nwould otherwise occur.” 2011 Major Boilers Rule, 76 Fed.\nReg. at 15,642. Industry stakeholders also pointed out that “it\nis very common . . . for certain control devices to be out of\noperation during periods of start-up due to the nature of the\nequipment.” See American Chemistry Council, Comments\non EPA’s Proposed Rule for National Emission Standards for\nHazardous Air Pollutants for Area Sources, EPA-HQ-OAR-\n2006-0790 (Aug. 23, 2010), at 31 (No. 11-1141 J.A. 386).\nBecause the control technology is temporarily offline, “it is\nlikely that emissions will exceed the standards proposed\n[during that time period].” Id. A work-practice standard that\nrequires facilities to minimize the time their boilers spend in\nstartup or shutdown thus seems calculated to maximally\nreduce emissions during those periods—and Petitioners fail to\nprovide any viable alternative. We therefore conclude the\nEPA’s decision to adopt these work-practice standards for\nlarge coal-fired boilers during startup and shutdown was\nreasonable.\n\f                             156\n\n                     V. CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we grant the petitions in part\nand deny them in part. Specifically, we vacate the MACT\nstandards for all major boiler subcategories that would have\nbeen affected had the EPA considered all sources included in\nthe subcategories, as explained at supra § IV.B.          We\nalso remand, without vacatur, to the EPA to: (1) adequately\nexplain how CO acts as a reasonable surrogate for non-\ndioxin/furan organic HAPs; (2) set emission standards for\ncyclonic burn barrels; (3) determine whether burn-off ovens,\nsoil treatment units, and space heaters are CISWI units and, if\nso, to set standards for those types of units; (4) adequately\nexplain the exclusion of synthetic boilers from Title V’s\npermitting requirements; and (5) adequately explain the\nchoice of GACT standards over MACT standards for non-Hg\nmetals.\n\n                                                   So ordered.\n\f</pre>",
