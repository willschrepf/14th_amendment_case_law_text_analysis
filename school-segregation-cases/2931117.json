This case arises out of Pruco’s non-payment of life insurance proceeds based on a\n\nrejected change of beneficiary form by the insured. Pruco brings six issues: (1) Sagarnaga\n\nlacked standing to sue Pruco for breach of the insurance policy and common-law and statutory bad\n\nfaith; (2) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the finding Pruco breached the\n\ninsurance policy; (3) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the finding that\n\nPruco breached common-law and statutory duties of good faith and fair dealing, specifically\n\nChapters 541 and 542 of the Texas Insurance Code; (4) the trial court erred in admitting expert\n\ntestimony over Pruco’s objection; (5) the trial court erred by awarding Sagarnaga 18 percent\n\fstatutory penalty interest on the claim amount of $375,000; and lastly (6) the trial court erred by\n\nawarding Sagarnaga attorney’s fees. Sagarnaga cross-appealed, asserting in a single issue the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by failing to award her post-trial and appellate attorney’s fees. We\n\naffirm in part, reform the judgment, and remand in part.\n\n                                               BACKGROUND\n\n         Dr. Arturo Garcia Fernandez was married to Margarita Henric Chavez, with whom he had\n\nthree children: Eloisa, Cecilia, and Arturo Garcia Henric, Jr. In July 2002, Dr. Garcia purchased\n\na Pruco life insurance policy (the “Policy”) for a death benefit of $750,000. In the application,\n\nDr. Garcia designated his wife, Margarita, as the primary beneficiary and contingent beneficiaries\n\nwere their three children. After Margarita’s death in 2005, Dr. Garcia married Irasema Sagarnaga\n\nDurante in 2007.\n\n         In February 2008, Dr. Garcia called Pruco regarding the Policy.                        In that recorded\n\nconversation, Dr. Garcia requested a change of beneficiary form (“COB”) for the Policy. Pruco\n\ninstructed Dr. Garcia that they would complete the COB form and send it to him for his approval\n\nand signature. The Pruco representative asked Dr. Garcia for the names of the beneficiaries and\n\nthe percentages each would be assigned.1 Dr. Garcia replied that he wanted to designate his wife,\n\nSagarnaga as a 50 percent beneficiary and his adult children as the remaining 50 percent\n\nbeneficiaries. Pruco sent the COB form to Dr. Garcia, but the requested beneficiary designations\n\nwere not included on the COB form.\n\n         On April 3, 2008, Dr. Garcia and Sagarnaga went to the El Paso Prudential office.\n\nDr. Garcia spoke with Solis, a Pruco associate, and Schmid, a Pruco insurance agent. Sagarnaga,\n\n1\n  Because the Pruco representative, Ortega, was not trained in “fractionalized” beneficiary designations (where the\nproceeds are split between various individuals), he was supposed to have forwarded Dr. Garcia’s call to a specialized\nunit within Pruco which is familiar with fractionalized beneficiaries, however Ortega did not do this.\n                                                         2\n\fwho speaks some English, was able to understand some of the discussion between her husband,\n\nSolis, and Schmid. Dr. Garcia explained to Sagarnaga the changes he was making to the Policy.\n\nSagarnaga understood, during this meeting, Dr. Garcia executed the COB form making her a 50\n\npercent beneficiary and the children the remaining 50 percent beneficiaries of the Policy.\n\n       Dr. Garcia’s COB form, dated April 3, 2008, listed the beneficiaries as follows: the\n\nprimary beneficiary designation stated Sagarnaga was to receive 50 percent of the Policy\n\nproceeds, 12 percent to Arturo Garcia, Jr., 13 percent to Eloisa, and 25 percent to Cecilia. The\n\ncontingent beneficiary, however, in the section titled “Additional/Special Beneficiary Requests”\n\n[Emphasis added] on the COB form, read as follows:\n\n       Pay 50% to Irasema Sagarnaga Durante, wife, if living otherwise same proportion\n       of this to my two daughters and son, Arturo Garcia, Cecilia Garcia, Eloisa Garcia, if\n       living, otherwise pay balance if any to Irasema Sagarnaga Durante, wife.\n\n       Pursuant to Pruco’s contract, a policy owner could change, inter alia, the beneficiary, by\n\nsending to Pruco a request “in a form that meets our needs.” According to the terms of the Policy,\n\nif Pruco received a COB request, Pruco would record the change and file it. The change of\n\nbeneficiary would be effective as of the date the request was signed. Pruco’s internal procedures\n\nwere clear that in order for a COB to be accepted in its entirety, it “must clearly specify the\n\nsettlement to be in effect at the death of the Insured.”\n\n       The signed COB form by Dr. Garcia was received by Pruco on April 10, 2008. The COB\n\nform was routed to the “settlement options” department where it was reviewed by Mehrotra, a\n\nPruco associate. While the primary beneficiary designation was satisfactory, Mehrotra found\n\nDr. Garcia’s changes for the contingent beneficiary or “additional/special beneficiary\n\ndesignation” to be “ambiguous.” Based on the ambiguity regarding the contingent beneficiaries,\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fMehrotra initiated a “turndown procedure,” in which Pruco did not accept or record, in its entirety,\n\nDr. Garcia’s COB form. Pruco then prepared a new COB form. The new COB form did not change\n\nthe primary beneficiary designation, it only modified the language for the additional/special\n\nbeneficiary section, based on what Mehrotra believed Dr. Garcia was attempting to do. The\n\nbeneficiary provision proposed by Mehrotra was as follows:\n\n        50% of the proceeds . . . to Irasema Sagarnaga Durante, Beneficiary, wife of the\n        Insured, if living, otherwise as follows:\n\n                 50% of such fund to Celcilia M. Garcia Henric . . .\n                 26% of such fund to Eloisa Garcia Henric . . .\n                 24% of such fund to Arturo Garcia Hendric . . .\n\n                 25% of proceeds to said Cecilia M. Garcia Henric . . .\n                 13% of proceeds to said Eloisa Garcia Henric . . .\n                 12% of proceeds to said Arturo Garcia Henric . . .\n\n        Mehrotra sent the new COB form to Dr. Garcia on April 14, 2008, and requested he review\n\nit. If after the review, the COB form stated what Dr. Garcia intended for the additional/special\n\nbeneficiary section, he was to sign and return it to Pruco. If not, Dr. Garcia should contact Pruco\n\nto obtain a corrected COB form. Dr. Garcia received this correspondence, but there is no\n\nevidence the letter was opened or read by Dr. Garcia before he died.2\n\n        Dr. Garcia died in Brazil on September 22, 2009. Dr. Garcia’s daughter, Eloisa, advised\n\nPruco of his death two days later. The children each filed a claim for benefits under the Policy in\n\nOctober 2009.\n\n        On October 21, 2009, Sagarnaga met with Schmid in El Paso.                         She asserted that\n\nDr. Garcia had changed the beneficiary designation to include her under the Policy. Pruco\n\ninformed Schmid about the issue of Dr. Garcia’s COB form. Schmid suggested Sagarnaga contact\n\n2\n Prior to his death, Dr. Garcia had been sick several times and much of his mail went unopened. Sagarnaga found a\nbox of unopened mail from various companies after Dr. Garcia’s death, including mail from Pruco.\n                                                       4\n\fPruco directly. Sagarnaga then called Pruco and was advised Dr. Garcia’s COB form naming her\n\nas a 50 percent beneficiary had not been accepted or recorded. Pruco stated Sagarnaga was not a\n\nbeneficiary under the Policy. Pruco instructed Sagarnaga to submit a written statement regarding\n\nher claim including any additional supporting information within fifteen days.3\n\n          That same day, October 21, after her telephone call to Pruco, Sagarnaga sent a letter stating\n\nshe was a beneficiary and made a claim for benefits. Pruco referred Sagarnaga’s statement to its\n\nclaims department to handle as an adverse claims case on October 27.4 On November 3, Pruco\n\nresponded in writing to Sagarnaga, and explained that Dr. Garcia’s COB form was unacceptable.\n\nPruco stated that due to the lack of response by Dr. Garcia to their “turndown” letter, their position\n\nwas that their liability was to the contingent beneficiaries, the three children. On November 13,\n\nPruco sent a second letter reiterating their position and stated that if Sagarnaga had documentation\n\nto support her claim to submit it within ten days. On November 18, the claims of all parties were\n\nformally referred to Pruco’s legal department. According to Pruco, the claim was referred after\n\nPruco performed an internal investigation and they determined Sagarnaga’s claim had merit.\n\n          On December 17, 2009, the children filed suit against Pruco, seeking payment of the entire\n\ndeath benefit, plus statutory penalties. On January 8, 2010, Pruco answered, counterclaimed and\n\nincluded a third party complaint interpleader action naming Sagarnaga. On March 9, 2010,\n\nSagarnaga filed a counterclaim against Pruco, seeking 50 percent of the disputed death benefit and\n\n\n3\n    Pruco’s internal notes from October 21, 2009 reflect the following:\n\n          *** wife is saying that their rep was there when she and the insured requested to set up bene to be\n          split 50% to her and the children ***\n          >> sent ref for possible adverse claim, wife stated that if she will not get any response from pru she\n          will seek the assistance of her atty.\n4\n  During this time Pruco investigated Dr. Garcia’s death, pursuant to its internal policies, including obtaining official\ndeath certificates, to verify Dr. Garcia’s death. Pruco also advised the children that Sagarnaga had made a claim.\n                                                            5\n\fdamages for:         (1) breach of contract; (2) violation of the Prompt Payment Statute; 5 (3)\n\ncommon-law bad faith; and (4) statutory bad faith claims. Sagarnaga also filed a third-party\n\nclaim against Schmid and Prudential, seeking the same damages based on Schmid’s purported\n\nnegligence and Texas Insurance Code violations.\n\n           On March 9, 2010, Pruco filed a motion asking the court to interplead the death benefit\n\npursuant to TEX.R.CIV.P. 43, find they had completely discharged all their liabilities to the\n\nclaimants and dismiss with prejudice the lawsuits against them. On March 29, Sagarnaga filed\n\nher response arguing Pruco had not met the elements for relief under a Rule 43 interpleader action.\n\nAt a hearing on March 25, 2010, the court granted Pruco’s request to deposit 50 percent of the\n\ndeath benefit ($375,000) into the registry of the court, but denied Pruco’s motion to dismiss. At\n\nthat time, the children and Sagarnaga agreed 50 percent of the Policy benefit was to be paid\n\ndirectly to the children. On June 3, 2010, Pruco deposited $382,483.50 into the court’s registry.\n\nPrior to trial, the children and Sagarnaga entered into another settlement agreement for an\n\nadditional $90,000 from the remaining registry funds to be paid to the children. The children did\n\nnot participate in the trial and the court later dismissed their claims.\n\n           The trial court conducted a two day trial in August 2011.6 At trial, a Pruco employee\n\nacknowledged the primary beneficiary designation was “quite clear,” but that Pruco failed to\n\nrecord Dr. Garcia’s COB in its entirety due to Pruco finding the “additional/special beneficiary\n\ndesignation” to be ambiguous. 7              Additionally, without objection from Pruco, Sagarnaga’s\n\n\n\n5\n    TEX.INS.CODE ANN. §§ 542.051 to 542.061 (West 2009 and Supp. 2014).\n6\n    Sagarnaga’s claims against Schmid were dismissed with prejudice before trial.\n7\n  One of the findings of fact challenged by Pruco is finding #99: “The Company admits that Garcia’s primary\ndesignation on the COB is clear.”\n                                                          6\n\fattorney David Pierce testified regarding her attorney’s fees.\n\n         The trial court made 168 findings of fact and 32 conclusions of law, many of which Pruco\n\nobjected to. The court found Sagarnaga was a beneficiary under the Policy; Pruco had breached\n\nthe Policy; and violated Chapters 541 and 542 of the Texas Insurance Code. The trial court found\n\nPruco breached the insurance contract when it: (1) “failed to file and record the primary\n\nbeneficiary designation” and “give it effect” from the date it was signed; and (2) failed to distribute\n\n50 percent of the death benefit to Sagarnaga. The court entered an amended judgment in January\n\n2012 awarding Sagarnaga: (1) $90,000 as damages for breach of contract; (2) statutory penalty\n\ninterest of 18 percent on $375,000 from November 3, 2009 through the date judgment was\n\nrendered; (3) 5 percent post-judgment interest until paid in full; and (4) $200,000 in attorney’s fees\n\nthrough trial. Both parties appealed.\n\n                                                     Standard of review\n\n         Findings of fact in a bench trial have the same force and dignity as a jury’s verdict upon\n\nquestions and are reviewed for legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence by the same standards.\n\nOrtiz v. Jones, 917 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex. 1996); Stanley Works v. Wichita Falls Independent\n\nSchool District, 366 S.W.3d 816, 824 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2012, pet. denied). Where, as here, the\n\nappellate record contains a reporter’s record, findings of fact are not conclusive on appeal if the\n\ncontrary is established as a matter of law or if there is no evidence to support the findings.8\n\nVernon v. Perrien, 390 S.W.3d 47, 57 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2012, pet. denied).\n\n         In a factual sufficiency review, we consider all of the evidence, both the evidence which\n\n\n8\n  In a civil case, if the trial court’s factual findings are unchallenged, as some are in this case, they are binding on the\nappellate court unless the contrary is established as a “matter of law,” or there is “no evidence” to support the finding.\nMcGalliard v. Kuhlmann, 722 S.W.2d 694, 696 (Tex. 1986). In other words, our review of unchallenged findings is\nrestricted to whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support them.\n                                                             7\n\ftends to prove the existence of a vital fact, as well as evidence which tends to disprove its\n\nexistence.

After considering and weighing all the evidence, we set\n\naside the fact-finding only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be\n\nclearly wrong and unjust. Rusty’s Weigh Scales and Service, Inc. v. North Texas Scales, Inc., 314\n\nS.W.3d 105, 110 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2010, no pet.).

Pascouet, 61 S.W.3d 599, 615-16 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet.\n\ndenied). We will not substitute our own judgment for that of the trier of fact, even if we would\n\nreach a different answer on the evidence. Maritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 407\n\n(Tex. 1998).\n\n        A legal sufficiency or “no evidence” challenge will be sustained if the party suffering the\n\nadverse decision at trial shows: (1) the complete absence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by\n\nrules of law or evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3)\n\nthe evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla; or (4) the evidences establishes\n\nconclusively the opposite of the vital fact. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 810 (Tex.\n\n2005); Stanley Works, 366 S.W.3d at 828. When conducting a legal sufficiency review, we must\n\nview the evidence in the light favorable to the verdict, crediting favorable evidence if a reasonable\n\nfact finder could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless a reasonable fact finder could not.\n\nCity of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 830; Stanley Works, 366 S.W.3d at 828. The final test for legal\n\nsufficiency must always be whether the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded\n\npeople to reach the verdict under review.

These\n\nissues are interrelated, and we will address them accordingly.9\n\n                                                       Standing\n\n           Pruco contends the trial court erroneously found Sagarnaga had standing. An insurance\n\npolicy is a contract between the insurer and the insured/owner of the policy. Hernandez v. Gulf\n\nGroup Lloyds, 875 S.W.2d 691, 692 (Tex. 1994). A beneficiary named under a life-insurance\n\npolicy has no standing to recover under the policy unless his interest has vested. Rotating\n\nServices Industries, Inc. v. Harris, 245 S.W.3d 476, 481 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet.\n\ndenied), citing Cates v. Cincinnati Life Ins. Co., 947 S.W.2d 608, 614 (Tex.App.--Texarkana\n\n1997, no writ), op. on remand from 927 S.W.2d 623 (Tex. 1996). Texas law holds that a named\n\nbeneficiary has no vested interest in the policy proceeds unless one of the following conditions\n9\n    Unless otherwise specified, section citations, are to the Texas Insurance Code.\n                                                            9\n\foccurs: (1) a contract—separate from the policy itself—proscribes any change in the designation\n\nof the beneficiary; (2) the policy itself does not authorize the owner of the policy to change the\n\nbeneficiary; or (3) the insured dies.     Harris, 245 S.W.3d at 481.       Until any one of these\n\nconditions occur and the beneficiary right’s become vested, an insurer may not prevent the policy\n\nowner from exercising his right to change the beneficiary. Id. at 481, citing State Farm Life Ins.\n\nCo. v. Martinez, 174 S.W.3d 772, 781 (Tex.App.--Waco 2005), rev’d on other grounds, 216\n\nS.W.3d 799 (Tex. 2007).\n\n       The policy terms define the right of the owner to change beneficiaries. See Martinez, 216\n\nS.W.3d at 802-3 (citing Acts of 1953, 53rd Leg., R.S., ch. 113, 1953 Tex. Gen. Laws 400 (current\n\nversion at TEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 1103.055 (West 2009))(subchapter B of chapter 1103, governing\n\ndesignation of beneficiary of life policy). On “substantial compliance” with the requirements\n\nstated in the policy for beneficiary changes, the insurer must honor the request and effect the\n\nchange. See Stewart v. Mut. Ben. Life Ins. Co., 522 S.W.2d 257, 260 (Tex.Civ.App.--Amarillo\n\n1975, writ ref’d n.r.e.)(rejecting contention that a “satisfactory” request created express condition\n\nthat insurer must consent to request). In determining the question of substantial compliance there\n\ncan be no hard and fast rule, but each case must be decided on its own set of facts as to what was\n\ndone or caused to be done by the insured.               Porter v. Garner, 386 S.W.2d 618, 620\n\n(Tex.Civ.App.--El Paso 1965, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n       Pruco’s argument is similar to the argument raised in Todd v. Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co.,\n\n483 S.W.2d 889 (Tex.Civ.App.--Waco 1972, writ ref’d n.r.e.). In Todd, the insured had a life\n\npolicy naming his wife as a beneficiary. The insured changed his beneficiary designation and\n\nsent the completed form (on the insurer’s required form) to the insurer. Id. at 890. The insurer\n\n\n                                                   10\n\freceived the form the day before the insured died, but rejected the form as “unacceptable” because\n\nthe form failed to indicate who might receive the share of a predeceased beneficiary. At the time\n\nthe insured died, all the primary beneficiaries named on his COB form were living. Todd, 483\n\nS.W.2d at 890. The court of appeals rejected the insurer’s argument the failure to designate a\n\ncontingent beneficiary allowed them to reject the COB, noting “[t]he rejection of the form was\n\nsimply based on some company policy or rule which was moot and had no application to the\n\ninsured Mr. Todd’s case.” Id. at 892. The insurer’s argument was deemed “groundless” because\n\nwhen the insured died, both of the primary beneficiaries indicated on the COB request were alive\n\nand survived him. Id.\n\n       In Martinez, much like the case at hand, the court was presented with competing claims to\n\nthe proceeds of a life insurance policy, the terms of which required that a COB request be written\n\n“in a form acceptable” to the insurer. Martinez, 216 S.W.3d at 802-03. The insured executed a\n\nCOB request from his ex-wife to his current wife twenty-four days before he died. He also used\n\nthe insurer’s “own printed form” to make the change. After the COB was received by the insurer,\n\nthey had “concerns” that it would violate the insured’s divorce decree. So, as a result, the insurer\n\ndid not accept the COB request. The Texas Supreme Court found that the COB request, even if it\n\nmight violate the divorce decree, did not render the request “unacceptable.” See id.\n\n       Pruco seeks to distinguish Martinez arguing the use of its form was not at issue, however,\n\nneither was it in Martinez. Dr. Garcia, like the insured in Martinez, used the COB form provided\n\nby his insurer. The Martinez insurer rejected the COB form based on the possibility the insured’s\n\nrequest violated his divorce decree. Here, Pruco failed to record the COB based on the content of\n\nthe request, that is, Dr. Garcia’s contingent beneficiary designation in the additional/special\n\n\n                                                11\n\fbeneficiary section. Pruco argues the COB was unacceptable to them because Mehrotra found the\n\ncontingent beneficiaries percentages as designated by Dr. Garcia ambiguous. However, it is\n\nundisputed, Sagarnaga survived her husband, thereby rendering the question of ambiguity of the\n\nadditional/special beneficiary designation moot.\n\n       Pruco argues the Policy requires a COB form must be “in a form that meets our needs,” and\n\nthat one of Pruco’s “needs” is the beneficiary designation be clear as to who the beneficiaries are.\n\nAt trial, Pruco acknowledged the primary beneficiary designation was “quite clear,” but Pruco\n\nrefused to record the COB in its entirety. Even in its brief, Pruco acknowledges that “no one\n\ndisputed that” Dr. Garcia’s primary beneficiary designation “was clear.”\n\n       Pruco asserts that “in a form that meets our needs” authorizes an insurer to substantively\n\nreview the contents of the COB form. According to Pruco, after their review, they may reject the\n\nCOB form in its entirety, even if only a part of it is objectionable, as it was here. This argument\n\nprecipitously leaves the definition of “meets our needs” completely in Pruco’s discretion, and\n\nbelies their assurance to the policy owners that beneficiary changes will be recorded, filed and\n\ngiven effect the date they are executed. Pruco’s concern about the additional/special beneficiary\n\ndesignation as a basis for their failure to record Dr. Garcia’s COB request, especially in light of the\n\nclarity of the primary beneficiary designation is without merit.\n\n       The Court in Martinez notes that even if the insurer is correct regarding concerns that a\n\nCOB request may violate a divorce decree, “the policy still said that a change would take effect\n\nwhen a request was signed, not when it was accepted.” [Emphasis in original]. Id. at 803.\n\nPruco’s Policy with Dr. Garcia provided, “[i]f we receive your request . . . we will file and record\n\nthe change and it will take effect as of the date you signed the request.” Pruco’s Policy language\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fis essentially equivalent to the Martinez policy language,10 and we find no reason not to adopt the\n\nsame rationale as the Martinez Court.\n\n           Like Pruco, the insurer in Martinez, also raised the issue of standing of the designee of the\n\ninsured’s rejected COB request. Pruco argues Sagarnaga has no standing because they rejected\n\nthe COB request of Dr. Garcia. However, like Martinez, if the COB request is valid and the\n\ninsured substantially complied, Sagarnaga is a beneficiary whose right’s vested when her husband\n\ndied.\n\n           Pruco contends that Harris serves to resolve the standing argument. The policy at issue in\n\nHarris contained a similar provision to that construed in Martinez and required that “any change\n\n[of beneficiary] must be in a written form satisfactory to [Nationwide].” See Harris, 245 S.W.3d\n\nat 483; Martinez, 216 S.W.3d at 801. However, in contrast to the policy in Martinez, the Harris\n\npolicy required that any change be “recorded” at the insurer’s home office. More importantly, the\n\noriginal beneficiary in Harris was designated an “irrevocable” beneficiary. Harris, 245 S.W.3d\n\nat 483. The insurer in Harris rejected an initial COB request of the “irrevocable” beneficiary, but\n\nlater accepted the COB where the sole “irrevocable beneficiary” signed the COB form, thereby\n\nconsenting to the change. Id. at 485. We find the facts in Harris distinguishable from the facts\n\nin this case.\n\n           Dr. Garcia contacted Pruco and advised them he wished to change his beneficiary\n\ndesignations. Pruco sent him a partially completed COB form. Dr. Garcia completed the\n\n10\n     The policy stated:\n\n           Change of Beneficiary Designation: You may make a change while the Insured is alive by sending\n           us a request. The change will take effect the date the request is signed, but the change will not\n           affect any action we have taken before we receive the request. We have the right to request your\n           policy to make the change on it.\n\nMartinez, 216 S.W.3d at 802, n.11.\n                                                          13\n\fremaining information and returned the COB request to Pruco. It is undisputed Dr. Garcia’s\n\nprimary beneficiary designation was clear and unambiguous. Pruco’s argument that the failure to\n\nrecord the COB request in its’ entirety is justifiable because they found the contingency\n\ndesignation unclear is without merit.              This is particularly true, in light of the fact that at\n\nDr. Garcia’s death, all the primary beneficiaries listed were living, rendering the\n\n“additional/special beneficiary” language inapplicable.                    We find that Dr. Garcia met the\n\nsubstantial compliance test and had “done all that he could reasonably have done” to effect the\n\nchange.” Tips v. Security Life & Accident Company, 144 Tex. 461, 464, 191 S.W.2d 470, 471\n\n(1945). Therefore, the COB became effective as of the date Dr. Garcia signed the COB form,\n\nApril 3, 2008, and Sagarnaga became an intended beneficiary of the policy. On Dr. Garcia’s\n\ndeath, Sagarnaga’s interest in the Policy vested, and she obtained standing to proceed against\n\nPruco for a breach of contract. Harris, 245 S.W.3d at 481. Pruco’s first issue is overruled.\n\n                                               Breach of Contract\n\n         Pruco contends the trial court erroneously found it breached the contract of insurance.11\n\nThe construction of a contract is a question of law for the court. Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391,\n\n393 (Tex. 1983); Edwards v. Lone Star Gas Co., a Div. of Enserch Corp., 782 S.W.2d 840, 841\n\n(Tex. 1990). The general rules of contract construction govern insurance policy interpretation.\n\nTex. Farmers Ins. Co. v. Murphy, 996 S.W.2d 873, 879 (Tex. 1999); State Farm Life Ins. Co. v.\n\n\n11\n   Pruco also argues that because it timely interpleaded the disputed Policy funds into the court’s registry, no cause of\naction for breach of contract exists, contending that interpleader is meant to take the place of payment when an insurer\nis presented with competing claims, and citing TEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 542.058(c) in support. However, this argument\nfails to take into account Section 542.061: “[t]he remedies provided by this subchapter are in addition to any other\nremedy or procedure provided by law or at common law.” Sagarnaga’s claims, separate from the alleged violation of\nthe Prompt Payment Statute, are not affected by Pruco’s interpleader under the statute. See Clayton v. MONY Life\nInsurance Company of America, 284 S.W.3d 398, 404-05 (Tex.App.--Beaumont 2009, no pet.)(noting that\n“interpleader tender did not serve to discharge all liability claims which arose prior to the interpleader . . . [t]hose\ndisputed independent claims must be adjudicated by summary judgment motion or trial.”).\n                                                          14\n\fBeaston, 907 S.W.2d 430, 433 (Tex. 1995); Barnett v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 723 S.W.2d 663, 665\n\n(Tex. 1987); see also Markel Ins. Co. v. Muzyka, 293 S.W.3d 380, 385–86 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth\n\n2009, no pet.)(describing various principles of contract interpretation that apply to insurance\n\npolicies).\n\n        “The elements of a breach of contract claim are (1) the existence of a valid contract, (2)\n\nperformance or tendered performance by the plaintiff, (3) breach of the contract by the defendant,\n\nand (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff.” Fieldtech Avionics & Instruments, Inc. v. Component\n\nControl.Com, Inc., 262 S.W.3d 813, 825 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth 2008, no pet.), citing Harris v.\n\nAm. Prot. Ins. Co., 158 S.W.3d 614, 622–23 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth 2005, no pet.).\n\n        The facts regarding the breach are straightforward. The Policy is a contract. Dr. Garcia\n\nsubstantially complied with the COB requirements, Sagarnaga became vested on Dr. Garcia’s\n\ndeath, and 50 percent of the Policy proceeds were to be paid to Sagarnaga. Pruco failed to tender\n\nthe 50 percent policy death benefit to Sagarnaga. The trial court found Sagarnaga incurred\n\ndamages as a result of Pruco’s failure to pay the Policy benefits, specifically, having to pay the\n\nchildren $90,000 from Sagarnaga’s 50 percent of the Policy death benefits that had been deposited\n\nin the court’s registry. The elements of a breach of contract are met in the instant case and we\n\noverrule Pruco’s second issue.\n\n                                      Texas’ Prompt Pay Statute\n\n        Pruco’s fifth issue and part of their third complaint both involve Chapter 542 of the Texas\n\nInsurance Code, known as the Prompt Pay Statute. Pruco asserts the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the finding that Pruco violated the TEX.INS.CODE ANN. §§ 542.051\n\n– 542.061. In addition, the court erred in awarding Sagarnaga statutory penalty interest pursuant\n\n\n                                                15\n\fto TEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 542.060 (West 2009). We disagree.\n\n       Section 542.055 provides than an insurer, within 15 days of receipt of a claim, is to\n\nacknowledge receipt, commence investigation and request “all items, statements, and forms that\n\nthe insurer reasonably believes, at that time, will be required from the claimant.” TEX.INS.CODE\n\nANN. § 542.055(a). The statute provides that a “notice of claim” is defined as any written\n\nnotification by a claimant to an insurer. TEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 542.051(4). If the insurer denies\n\nthe claim, such denial must be “not later than the 15th business day after the date the insurer\n\nreceives all items, statements, and forms required by the insurer . . . .” TEX.INS.CODE ANN.\n\n§ 542.056(a). Subsection (a) of Section 542.058 states if an insurer “after receiving all items,\n\nstatements, and forms reasonably requested” under Section 542.055 delays payment of the claim\n\nfor more than 60 days (or that period another applicable statute specifies), the insurer shall pay\n\n“damages and other items” in accordance with Section 542.060.                   TEX.INS.CODE ANN.\n\n§ 542.058(a).\n\n       If an insurer is liable for a claim that is not in compliance with the Prompt Payment\n\nsubchapter, the insurer is liable for interest on the claim of 18 percent a year as damages, and\n\nreasonable attorney fees. TEX.INS.CODE ANN. §542.060(a). In June of 2009, the following\n\nprovision was added to Section 542.058:\n\n       (c) A life insurer that receives notice of an adverse, bona fide claim to all or part of\n       the proceeds of the policy before the applicable payment deadline under Subsection\n       (a) shall pay the claim or properly file an interpleader action and tender the benefits\n       into the registry of the court not later than the 90th day after the date the insurer\n       receives all items, statements, and forms reasonably requested and required under\n       Section 542.055. A life insurer that delays payment of the claim or the filing of an\n       interpleader and tender of policy proceeds for more than 90 days shall pay damages\n       and other items as provided by Section 542.060 until the claim is paid or an\n       interpleader is properly filed.\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fTEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 542.058(c).12\n\n        Additionally, Section 542.061 provides: “[t]he remedies provided by this subchapter are\n\nin addition to any other remedy or procedure provided by law or at common law.”\n\n        Dr. Garcia died on September 22, 2009. The children each filed a claim for benefits under\n\nthe Policy by October 15, 2009. On October 21, 2009, Sagarnaga called Pruco to assert her claim\n\nto the death benefit. She also sent a letter that day reiterating her position that Dr. Garcia signed a\n\nCOB making her a 50 percent beneficiary. Subsequently, Pruco receives Sagarnaga’s letter\n\nregarding her claim. Pruco referred the file to its claims department for handling as an adverse\n\nclaims case on October 27. On November 3, Pruco sends a letter to Sagarnaga rejecting her\n\nclaim, stating the children are the only beneficiaries. On November 13, Pruco sent a letter to\n\nSagarnaga requesting her to submit documents verifying Dr. Garcia’s intent regarding the change\n\nof beneficiary.\n\n        On December 17, the children filed their original petition against Pruco for the entire\n\nbenefit under the Policy.            On January 8, 2010, Pruco answered the children’s suit,\n\ncounterclaimed, and included “a third party action in interpleader against Sagarnaga seeking to\n\ndeposit the Death Benefit” with the court. On March 9, Pruco filed a “Motion to Interplead Funds\n\nand Dismiss,” arguing that Pruco is “ready, willing and able to pay the Death Benefit” and was\n\nrequesting the “Court’s permission to deposit the Death Benefit with the Court.” Pruco was also\n\nseeking, after the death benefit was paid, that Pruco “shall be fully and completely discharged of\n\nany and all liabilities to the claimants . . . .” On May 7, the court signed an order in which Pruco’s\n\nmotion to dismiss was denied, but ordered the $375,000, plus interest payable pursuant to the\n\n\n12\n  Amended by Acts 2009, 81st Leg., ch. 833, § 1, eff. June 19, 2009. This subsection was in effect prior to\nDr. Garcia’s death in September of 2009.\n                                                        17\n\fPolicy, to be deposited immediately into the registry of the court. On August 3, the court signed\n\nan agreed order which reflected that Pruco had deposited $382,483.50 into the court’s registry on\n\nJune 3.\n\n          The trial court, in her conclusions of law, held Sagarnaga was entitled to $135,000 of\n\nstatutory interest for the violation of Chapter 542, commencing on November 3, 2009, and “[t]he\n\nCompany is liable to Sagarnaga for wrongfully delaying payment to Sagarnaga for more than 60\n\ndays after receiving notice of the Sagarnaga claim.” On January 25, 2012, the court signed an\n\namended judgment awarding Sagarnaga “statutory interest damages . . . on the Claim Amount as\n\ncalculated at the rate of 18% per year commencing on November 3, 2009, and ending on the day\n\npreceding the date of judgment was rendered.”\n\n          Notice of claim is written notification by the claimant to the insurer, and it is undisputed\n\nPruco received written notice from Sagarnaga.             TEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 542.051(4).         On\n\nNovember 3, Pruco sent written notice to Sagarnaga rejecting her claim, which complied with\n\nTEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 542.056(a). The interpleader was filed on January 8, but the tender of the\n\ndeath benefits into the registry of the court was not accomplished until June 3, 2010.\n\n          Pruco argues that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the court’s\n\nfinding that Pruco violated the Section 542.058. First, Pruco agues they required additional time\n\nto conduct an investigation into Dr. Garcia’s death, thus the Section 542.058 deadlines were not\n\ntriggered until after November 2009. Second, Pruco was presented with “adverse, bonafide”\n\nclaims, so Section 542.058(c) ninety-day deadline applies. Finally, Pruco’s interpleader was filed\n\nprior to the expiration of ninety days, so therefore, they did not violate the Prompt Pay statute. In\n\nsupport of their claim the interpleader was filed timely, Pruco points to the express language of\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fSection 542.058(c) and the holding in Martinez.\n\n       In Martinez, the trial court assessed the statutory penalty interest after the interpleader was\n\nfiled and until the final judgment was signed, some nine months later. Martinez, 216 S.W.3d at\n\n805. The Texas Supreme Court held, “only the absence of rival claims” would justify continuing\n\nthe statutory penalty of Section 542.060(a) after interpleader occurs. Id. at 807. Pruco urges this\n\nCourt to construe Martinez for the proposition that “interpleader sufficed in place of payment.”\n\nId. at 806. However, in Martinez, the policy proceeds were deposited into the trial court’s registry\n\non the same day the interpleader was filed. Id. at 801. In fact, the interpleader was filed and the\n\npolicy proceeds were deposited seventy-two days from the prompt payment sixty-day deadline,\n\nthereby exceeding it only by twelve days. Id. at 807. The court held the insurer owed the\n\nstatutory penalties only for the twelve days it had missed the Section 542.058 deadline. Id. at\n\n807-08.\n\n       The Martinez court repeatedly emphasized the payment of the proceeds into the court’s\n\nregistry tolls the statute’s interest penalties. A careful reading of Martinez reveals the Court used\n\n“interpleader” and “deposit of the proceeds” interchangeably, and understood those actions would\n\noccur nearly simultaneously. Id. at 806, 807. The court stated, “the statute seeks to get policies\n\npaid as quickly as possible, it is not advanced by paying the wrong party, a consequence that\n\ninterpleader avoids.” Id. at 806. Further, “an insurer that tenders part of the policy proceeds\n\nmust pay penalties only on the remainder . . . .” Id. at 807. The court reasoned that “an insurer\n\nthat interpleads the entire policy proceeds owes nothing more, and should not have to pay penalties\n\non the presumption that it does.” Martinez, 216 S.W.3d at 807.\n\n       Pruco correctly points out Martinez was decided in 2007, prior to the enactment of Section\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f542.058(c). Turning to the express language of the statute, firstly, we note that it states “file an\n\ninterpleader action and tender the benefits into the registry of the court . . . .” Secondly, it also\n\nstates, that “[a] life insurer that delays payment of the claim or the filing of an interpleader and\n\ntender of policy proceeds,” if greater than ninety days, is subject to the statutory interest penalty of\n\nSection 542.060(a). It is clear to us that the Legislature has intentionally coupled the filing of the\n\ninterpleader action and the deposit of the policy proceeds into the court’s registry in order to toll\n\nthe assessment of the statutory interest under Section 542.060(a).\n\n        Therefore, we hold that the statutory interest, pursuant to Section 542.060(a), shall begin\n\nthe day after the deadline ends under Section 542.058(a) or (c), that being either day sixty-one or\n\nday ninety-one. The interest penalty, in accordance with Martinez, shall accrue until the day\n\nbefore the policy proceeds have been deposited into the court’s registry. In the case at hand, the\n\ntender of the Policy proceeds into the court’s registry occurred on June 3, 2010. Therefore, the\n\ncourt erred in assessing the statutory interest until January 24, 2012.\n\n        Next, we turn to the sufficiency of the court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law that\n\n(1) Pruco had an obligation to pay Sagarnaga within sixty days under Section 542.058(a); and (2)\n\nthat obligation began on November 3, 2009. The court found Sagarnaga was a beneficiary and it\n\nis incontrovertible that Sagarnaga was not paid the Policy benefits within sixty days of her claim.\n\nPruco asserts they may delay payment up to ninety days under Section 542.058(c) if they have\n\nreceived “notice of an adverse, bona fide claim . . . .” However, in order to avail themselves of the\n\npayment delay of ninety days, Pruco shoulders the burden of proof in showing that Sagarnaga and\n\nthe children had adverse, bona fide claims to the Policy. However, here the record is woefully\n\ndevoid of evidence that Sagarnaga and the children were bona-fide adverse claimants. Pruco has\n\n\n                                                  20\n\ffailed to show they are entitled to the extra thirty days Section 542.058(c) affords them, and the\n\nevidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the court’s finding Pruco violated Section\n\n542.058(a).\n\n       On October 21, Pruco first became aware of Sagarnaga’s claim. Pruco then received\n\nwritten notice of her claim. On November 3, 2009, Pruco rejected Sagarnaga’s claim asserting\n\nthe sole beneficiaries to the Policy were the children.      Then in a seeming about-face, on\n\nNovember 13, Pruco requests Sagarnaga provide further documentation to support her claim.\n\nPruco points to their November 13 letter to show that they were continuing to evaluate Sagarnaga’s\n\nclaim through November 2009 and therefore is not liable to pay the death benefit on November 3,\n\n2009. As Pruco was able to deny Sagarnaga’s claim on November 3, ostensibly, they had\n\nconcluded their investigation as to whether benefits were payable and to whom. We find that the\n\nevidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the court’s conclusion that Pruco delayed\n\npayment for over sixty days beginning on November 3, 2009.\n\n       The interpleader and the deposit of policy proceeds should have occurred by January 2,\n\n2010, under Section 542.058(a) in order to avoid the statutory penalties. The death benefits owed\n\nto Sagarnaga were deposited into the court’s registry by Pruco on June 3, 2010. The imposition of\n\nthe statutory interest in accordance with Section 542.060(a) should begin the sixty-first day after\n\nNovember 3, 2009 and end the day before June 3, 2010. In accordance with our opinion, the\n\nstatutory interest would commence on January 3, 2010 and end on June 2, 2010. Under our\n\nholding and these facts, Pruco violated both Section 542.058(a), in that their tender of the policy\n\nproceeds into the court’s registry exceeded the sixty days deadline.\n\n       We overrule Pruco’s fifth issue and part of their third issue as to Chapter 542 and the\n\n\n                                                21\n\fimposition of the 18 percent statutory interest under Section 542.060(a).\n\n                                         Attorney’s fees\n\n       In its sixth issue, Pruco contends the evidence supporting the award of Sagarnaga’s\n\nattorney’s fees is legally and factually insufficient. Pruco points to the failure of the testifying\n\nattorney to segregate the attorneys’ fees accrued under the breach of contract claim and of those\n\nfees that accrued under Sagarnaga’s other claims.\n\n       Whether segregation is necessary is a question of law, subject to de novo review.\n\nPenhollow Custom Homes, LLC v. Kim, 320 S.W.3d 366, 374 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2010, no pet.).\n\nTexas law prohibits recovery of attorneys’ fees unless authorized by statute or contract. Tony\n\nGullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 310 (Tex. 2006). A negligence cause of action\n\ndoes not support a claim of attorney’s fees, whereas a claim for breach of contract does. See\n\nTEX.CIV.PRAC.&REM.CODE ANN. §§ 38.001–.006 (West 2008).\n\n       If any attorney’s fees relate solely to claims for which fees are not recoverable, a claimant\n\nmust segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees. Tony Gullo Motors, 212 S.W.3d at 313.\n\nIntertwined facts do not make tort fees recoverable. Id. at 313. It is only when legal services\n\nadvance both recoverable and unrecoverable claims and the services are so intertwined that the\n\nassociated fees need not be segregated. A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. v. Beyer, 235 S.W.3d 704,\n\n710 (Tex. 2007), citing Tony Gullo Motors, 212 S.W.3d at 313–14. Unsegregated fees are some\n\nevidence of what the segregated amount should be, therefore, remand for segregation of fees may\n\nbe required when at least some of the fees at issue are attributable to claims for which attorney’s\n\nfees are recoverable. Id.\n\n       In the instant case, Sagarnaga’s claims and counterclaims involved breach of contract,\n\n\n                                                22\n\fviolation of the Prompt Payment Statute, common-law and statutory bad faith, negligence and\n\nTexas Insurance Code violations. The judgment awarded Sagarnaga $200,000 in attorney’s fees.\n\n        When Sagarnaga’s counsel, Pierce, testified to his attorney’s fees, he stated:\n\n                The only other point I wish to make is that I have not attempted to segregate\n        fees in this case, because there are essentially to some degree three lawsuits that\n        were being litigated: Ms. Sagarnaga versus the children, Ms. Sagarnaga versus\n        Mr. Schmid and Ms. Sagarnaga versus Prudential. However, the facts of one and\n        the facts of all are the same.\n\nPierce further testified:\n\n        It is my opinion that it’s not really possible to tease out any particular part of any\n        claim or cause of action, because the facts of the three cases are so interrelated that\n        it was all going to be generated whether or not there was a claim against\n        Mr. Schmid directly or it was just against Prudential.\n\nWhile Pierce referred to an “affidavit” relating to his fees, the exhibit introduced at trial was the\n\nbilling records. Even a cursory review of the billing records indicates billing entries relating to\n\nSchmid – who Sagarnaga raised negligence allegations against in her claims. Pierce made no\n\neffort to estimate a possible segregation of fees in his testimony. While the standard does not\n\nmandate the maintenance of separate time records when drafting the different claims, an opinion\n\nwould be sufficient as to the percentages of segregation as to the claims. See Tony Gullo Motors,\n\n212 S.W.3d at 314 n.83.\n\n        In Allan v. Nersesova, Allan pleaded thirteen claims against five defendants. 307 S.W.3d\n\n564, 573 (Tex.App.--Dallas 2010, no pet.). At trial, Allan asserted only one cause of action\n\nagainst one defendant for which attorney’s fees could be awarded. Id. Allan argued that she had\n\nno burden to segregate her fees because the tort and contract claims required proof of the same set\n\nof facts and circumstances and were intertwined to the point of being inseparable. The court of\n\nappeals noted that Allan failed to show that all her attorney’s fees were incurred for legal services\n\n                                                  23\n\finvolving the breach of contract action. Allan, 307 S.W.3d at 573. “For example, the fees\n\nincurred in drafting the original and amended petitions and the jury charge relating to the tort\n\nclaims were not recoverable, while the portion of the fees relating to the contract claim was\n\nrecoverable.” Id. Based on these findings, the court of appeals reversed the attorney’s fee award\n\nand remanded the case for a new trial on the issue of attorney’s fees. Id. at 573–74.\n\n       We find the reasoning of Tony Gullo Motors and Allan appropriate in the instant case,\n\nparticularly with the lack of opinion regarding segregation of fees and the evidence presented\n\nwhich included fees for claims where attorney’s fees would have been unrecoverable.\n\n       We sustain Pruco’s sixth issue.

Perez, 120 S.W.3d 463, 469 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2003, no pet.). Sagarnaga presented uncontested testimony that $30,000 is a reasonable fee for an\n\nappeal to this Court, with additional fees for a motion to reconsider, and $5,000 for an appeal to the\n\nTexas Supreme Court, increasing if the Supreme Court required briefing and granted oral\n\nargument. “While the trial court had discretion to award a smaller or larger fee, it did not have\n\ndiscretion to award nothing.” Id. Sagarnaga was entitled to an award of appellate attorney’s\n\nfees. See id. at 469-70. However, because Pruco has partially succeeded in this appeal, and as\n\nthe matter is being remanded based on the failure to segregate the attorney’s fees, we have no\n\nchoice but to reverse and remand the award of attorney’s fees to the trial court for a determination\n\nof the reasonable attorney fees to be awarded Sagarnaga in view of the fact that Pruco was partially\n\nsuccessful in this appeal, and to make a determination of an appellate attorney fee should the\n\nmatter be appealed to the Texas Supreme Court.

This case arises out of Pruco’s non-payment of life insurance proceeds based on a\n\nrejected change of beneficiary form by the insured. Pruco brings six issues: (1) Sagarnaga\n\nlacked standing to sue Pruco for breach of the insurance policy and common-law and statutory bad\n\nfaith; (2) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the finding Pruco breached the\n\ninsurance policy; (3) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the finding that\n\nPruco breached common-law and statutory duties of good faith and fair dealing, specifically\n\nChapters 541 and 542 of the Texas Insurance Code; (4) the trial court erred in admitting expert\n\ntestimony over Pruco’s objection; (5) the trial court erred by awarding Sagarnaga 18 percent\n\fstatutory penalty interest on the claim amount of $375,000; and lastly (6) the trial court erred by\n\nawarding Sagarnaga attorney’s fees. Sagarnaga cross-appealed, asserting in a single issue the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by failing to award her post-trial and appellate attorney’s fees. We\n\naffirm in part, reform the judgment, and remand in part.\n\n                                               BACKGROUND\n\n         Dr. Arturo Garcia Fernandez was married to Margarita Henric Chavez, with whom he had\n\nthree children: Eloisa, Cecilia, and Arturo Garcia Henric, Jr. In July 2002, Dr. Garcia purchased\n\na Pruco life insurance policy (the “Policy”) for a death benefit of $750,000. In the application,\n\nDr. Garcia designated his wife, Margarita, as the primary beneficiary and contingent beneficiaries\n\nwere their three children. After Margarita’s death in 2005, Dr. Garcia married Irasema Sagarnaga\n\nDurante in 2007.\n\n         In February 2008, Dr. Garcia called Pruco regarding the Policy.                        In that recorded\n\nconversation, Dr. Garcia requested a change of beneficiary form (“COB”) for the Policy. Pruco\n\ninstructed Dr. Garcia that they would complete the COB form and send it to him for his approval\n\nand signature. The Pruco representative asked Dr. Garcia for the names of the beneficiaries and\n\nthe percentages each would be assigned.1 Dr. Garcia replied that he wanted to designate his wife,\n\nSagarnaga as a 50 percent beneficiary and his adult children as the remaining 50 percent\n\nbeneficiaries. Pruco sent the COB form to Dr. Garcia, but the requested beneficiary designations\n\nwere not included on the COB form.\n\n         On April 3, 2008, Dr. Garcia and Sagarnaga went to the El Paso Prudential office.\n\nDr. Garcia spoke with Solis, a Pruco associate, and Schmid, a Pruco insurance agent. Sagarnaga,\n\n1\n  Because the Pruco representative, Ortega, was not trained in “fractionalized” beneficiary designations (where the\nproceeds are split between various individuals), he was supposed to have forwarded Dr. Garcia’s call to a specialized\nunit within Pruco which is familiar with fractionalized beneficiaries, however Ortega did not do this.\n                                                         2\n\fwho speaks some English, was able to understand some of the discussion between her husband,\n\nSolis, and Schmid. Dr. Garcia explained to Sagarnaga the changes he was making to the Policy.\n\nSagarnaga understood, during this meeting, Dr. Garcia executed the COB form making her a 50\n\npercent beneficiary and the children the remaining 50 percent beneficiaries of the Policy.\n\n       Dr. Garcia’s COB form, dated April 3, 2008, listed the beneficiaries as follows: the\n\nprimary beneficiary designation stated Sagarnaga was to receive 50 percent of the Policy\n\nproceeds, 12 percent to Arturo Garcia, Jr., 13 percent to Eloisa, and 25 percent to Cecilia. The\n\ncontingent beneficiary, however, in the section titled “Additional/Special Beneficiary Requests”\n\n[Emphasis added] on the COB form, read as follows:\n\n       Pay 50% to Irasema Sagarnaga Durante, wife, if living otherwise same proportion\n       of this to my two daughters and son, Arturo Garcia, Cecilia Garcia, Eloisa Garcia, if\n       living, otherwise pay balance if any to Irasema Sagarnaga Durante, wife.\n\n       Pursuant to Pruco’s contract, a policy owner could change, inter alia, the beneficiary, by\n\nsending to Pruco a request “in a form that meets our needs.” According to the terms of the Policy,\n\nif Pruco received a COB request, Pruco would record the change and file it. The change of\n\nbeneficiary would be effective as of the date the request was signed. Pruco’s internal procedures\n\nwere clear that in order for a COB to be accepted in its entirety, it “must clearly specify the\n\nsettlement to be in effect at the death of the Insured.”\n\n       The signed COB form by Dr. Garcia was received by Pruco on April 10, 2008. The COB\n\nform was routed to the “settlement options” department where it was reviewed by Mehrotra, a\n\nPruco associate. While the primary beneficiary designation was satisfactory, Mehrotra found\n\nDr. Garcia’s changes for the contingent beneficiary or “additional/special beneficiary\n\ndesignation” to be “ambiguous.” Based on the ambiguity regarding the contingent beneficiaries,\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fMehrotra initiated a “turndown procedure,” in which Pruco did not accept or record, in its entirety,\n\nDr. Garcia’s COB form. Pruco then prepared a new COB form. The new COB form did not change\n\nthe primary beneficiary designation, it only modified the language for the additional/special\n\nbeneficiary section, based on what Mehrotra believed Dr. Garcia was attempting to do. The\n\nbeneficiary provision proposed by Mehrotra was as follows:\n\n        50% of the proceeds . . . to Irasema Sagarnaga Durante, Beneficiary, wife of the\n        Insured, if living, otherwise as follows:\n\n                 50% of such fund to Celcilia M. Garcia Henric . . .\n                 26% of such fund to Eloisa Garcia Henric . . .\n                 24% of such fund to Arturo Garcia Hendric . . .\n\n                 25% of proceeds to said Cecilia M. Garcia Henric . . .\n                 13% of proceeds to said Eloisa Garcia Henric . . .\n                 12% of proceeds to said Arturo Garcia Henric . . .\n\n        Mehrotra sent the new COB form to Dr. Garcia on April 14, 2008, and requested he review\n\nit. If after the review, the COB form stated what Dr. Garcia intended for the additional/special\n\nbeneficiary section, he was to sign and return it to Pruco. If not, Dr. Garcia should contact Pruco\n\nto obtain a corrected COB form. Dr. Garcia received this correspondence, but there is no\n\nevidence the letter was opened or read by Dr. Garcia before he died.2\n\n        Dr. Garcia died in Brazil on September 22, 2009. Dr. Garcia’s daughter, Eloisa, advised\n\nPruco of his death two days later. The children each filed a claim for benefits under the Policy in\n\nOctober 2009.\n\n        On October 21, 2009, Sagarnaga met with Schmid in El Paso.                         She asserted that\n\nDr. Garcia had changed the beneficiary designation to include her under the Policy. Pruco\n\ninformed Schmid about the issue of Dr. Garcia’s COB form. Schmid suggested Sagarnaga contact\n\n2\n Prior to his death, Dr. Garcia had been sick several times and much of his mail went unopened. Sagarnaga found a\nbox of unopened mail from various companies after Dr. Garcia’s death, including mail from Pruco.\n                                                       4\n\fPruco directly. Sagarnaga then called Pruco and was advised Dr. Garcia’s COB form naming her\n\nas a 50 percent beneficiary had not been accepted or recorded. Pruco stated Sagarnaga was not a\n\nbeneficiary under the Policy. Pruco instructed Sagarnaga to submit a written statement regarding\n\nher claim including any additional supporting information within fifteen days.3\n\n          That same day, October 21, after her telephone call to Pruco, Sagarnaga sent a letter stating\n\nshe was a beneficiary and made a claim for benefits. Pruco referred Sagarnaga’s statement to its\n\nclaims department to handle as an adverse claims case on October 27.4 On November 3, Pruco\n\nresponded in writing to Sagarnaga, and explained that Dr. Garcia’s COB form was unacceptable.\n\nPruco stated that due to the lack of response by Dr. Garcia to their “turndown” letter, their position\n\nwas that their liability was to the contingent beneficiaries, the three children. On November 13,\n\nPruco sent a second letter reiterating their position and stated that if Sagarnaga had documentation\n\nto support her claim to submit it within ten days. On November 18, the claims of all parties were\n\nformally referred to Pruco’s legal department. According to Pruco, the claim was referred after\n\nPruco performed an internal investigation and they determined Sagarnaga’s claim had merit.\n\n          On December 17, 2009, the children filed suit against Pruco, seeking payment of the entire\n\ndeath benefit, plus statutory penalties. On January 8, 2010, Pruco answered, counterclaimed and\n\nincluded a third party complaint interpleader action naming Sagarnaga. On March 9, 2010,\n\nSagarnaga filed a counterclaim against Pruco, seeking 50 percent of the disputed death benefit and\n\n\n3\n    Pruco’s internal notes from October 21, 2009 reflect the following:\n\n          *** wife is saying that their rep was there when she and the insured requested to set up bene to be\n          split 50% to her and the children ***\n          >> sent ref for possible adverse claim, wife stated that if she will not get any response from pru she\n          will seek the assistance of her atty.\n4\n  During this time Pruco investigated Dr. Garcia’s death, pursuant to its internal policies, including obtaining official\ndeath certificates, to verify Dr. Garcia’s death. Pruco also advised the children that Sagarnaga had made a claim.\n                                                            5\n\fdamages for:         (1) breach of contract; (2) violation of the Prompt Payment Statute; 5 (3)\n\ncommon-law bad faith; and (4) statutory bad faith claims. Sagarnaga also filed a third-party\n\nclaim against Schmid and Prudential, seeking the same damages based on Schmid’s purported\n\nnegligence and Texas Insurance Code violations.\n\n           On March 9, 2010, Pruco filed a motion asking the court to interplead the death benefit\n\npursuant to TEX.R.CIV.P. 43, find they had completely discharged all their liabilities to the\n\nclaimants and dismiss with prejudice the lawsuits against them. On March 29, Sagarnaga filed\n\nher response arguing Pruco had not met the elements for relief under a Rule 43 interpleader action.\n\nAt a hearing on March 25, 2010, the court granted Pruco’s request to deposit 50 percent of the\n\ndeath benefit ($375,000) into the registry of the court, but denied Pruco’s motion to dismiss. At\n\nthat time, the children and Sagarnaga agreed 50 percent of the Policy benefit was to be paid\n\ndirectly to the children. On June 3, 2010, Pruco deposited $382,483.50 into the court’s registry.\n\nPrior to trial, the children and Sagarnaga entered into another settlement agreement for an\n\nadditional $90,000 from the remaining registry funds to be paid to the children. The children did\n\nnot participate in the trial and the court later dismissed their claims.\n\n           The trial court conducted a two day trial in August 2011.6 At trial, a Pruco employee\n\nacknowledged the primary beneficiary designation was “quite clear,” but that Pruco failed to\n\nrecord Dr. Garcia’s COB in its entirety due to Pruco finding the “additional/special beneficiary\n\ndesignation” to be ambiguous. 7              Additionally, without objection from Pruco, Sagarnaga’s\n\n\n\n5\n    TEX.INS.CODE ANN. §§ 542.051 to 542.061 (West 2009 and Supp. 2014).\n6\n    Sagarnaga’s claims against Schmid were dismissed with prejudice before trial.\n7\n  One of the findings of fact challenged by Pruco is finding #99: “The Company admits that Garcia’s primary\ndesignation on the COB is clear.”\n                                                          6\n\fattorney David Pierce testified regarding her attorney’s fees.\n\n         The trial court made 168 findings of fact and 32 conclusions of law, many of which Pruco\n\nobjected to. The court found Sagarnaga was a beneficiary under the Policy; Pruco had breached\n\nthe Policy; and violated Chapters 541 and 542 of the Texas Insurance Code. The trial court found\n\nPruco breached the insurance contract when it: (1) “failed to file and record the primary\n\nbeneficiary designation” and “give it effect” from the date it was signed; and (2) failed to distribute\n\n50 percent of the death benefit to Sagarnaga. The court entered an amended judgment in January\n\n2012 awarding Sagarnaga: (1) $90,000 as damages for breach of contract; (2) statutory penalty\n\ninterest of 18 percent on $375,000 from November 3, 2009 through the date judgment was\n\nrendered; (3) 5 percent post-judgment interest until paid in full; and (4) $200,000 in attorney’s fees\n\nthrough trial.

In Todd, the insured had a life\n\npolicy naming his wife as a beneficiary. The insured changed his beneficiary designation and\n\nsent the completed form (on the insurer’s required form) to the insurer. Id. at 890. The insurer\n\n\n                                                   10\n\freceived the form the day before the insured died, but rejected the form as “unacceptable” because\n\nthe form failed to indicate who might receive the share of a predeceased beneficiary. At the time\n\nthe insured died, all the primary beneficiaries named on his COB form were living. Todd, 483\n\nS.W.2d at 890. The court of appeals rejected the insurer’s argument the failure to designate a\n\ncontingent beneficiary allowed them to reject the COB, noting “[t]he rejection of the form was\n\nsimply based on some company policy or rule which was moot and had no application to the\n\ninsured Mr. Todd’s case.” Id. at 892. The insurer’s argument was deemed “groundless” because\n\nwhen the insured died, both of the primary beneficiaries indicated on the COB request were alive\n\nand survived him. Id.\n\n       In Martinez, much like the case at hand, the court was presented with competing claims to\n\nthe proceeds of a life insurance policy, the terms of which required that a COB request be written\n\n“in a form acceptable” to the insurer. Martinez, 216 S.W.3d at 802-03. The insured executed a\n\nCOB request from his ex-wife to his current wife twenty-four days before he died. He also used\n\nthe insurer’s “own printed form” to make the change. After the COB was received by the insurer,\n\nthey had “concerns” that it would violate the insured’s divorce decree. So, as a result, the insurer\n\ndid not accept the COB request. The Texas Supreme Court found that the COB request, even if it\n\nmight violate the divorce decree, did not render the request “unacceptable.” See id.\n\n       Pruco seeks to distinguish Martinez arguing the use of its form was not at issue, however,\n\nneither was it in Martinez. Dr. Garcia, like the insured in Martinez, used the COB form provided\n\nby his insurer. The Martinez insurer rejected the COB form based on the possibility the insured’s\n\nrequest violated his divorce decree. Here, Pruco failed to record the COB based on the content of\n\nthe request, that is, Dr. Garcia’s contingent beneficiary designation in the additional/special\n\n\n                                                11\n\fbeneficiary section. Pruco argues the COB was unacceptable to them because Mehrotra found the\n\ncontingent beneficiaries percentages as designated by Dr. Garcia ambiguous. However, it is\n\nundisputed, Sagarnaga survived her husband, thereby rendering the question of ambiguity of the\n\nadditional/special beneficiary designation moot.\n\n       Pruco argues the Policy requires a COB form must be “in a form that meets our needs,” and\n\nthat one of Pruco’s “needs” is the beneficiary designation be clear as to who the beneficiaries are.\n\nAt trial, Pruco acknowledged the primary beneficiary designation was “quite clear,” but Pruco\n\nrefused to record the COB in its entirety. Even in its brief, Pruco acknowledges that “no one\n\ndisputed that” Dr. Garcia’s primary beneficiary designation “was clear.”\n\n       Pruco asserts that “in a form that meets our needs” authorizes an insurer to substantively\n\nreview the contents of the COB form. According to Pruco, after their review, they may reject the\n\nCOB form in its entirety, even if only a part of it is objectionable, as it was here. This argument\n\nprecipitously leaves the definition of “meets our needs” completely in Pruco’s discretion, and\n\nbelies their assurance to the policy owners that beneficiary changes will be recorded, filed and\n\ngiven effect the date they are executed. Pruco’s concern about the additional/special beneficiary\n\ndesignation as a basis for their failure to record Dr. Garcia’s COB request, especially in light of the\n\nclarity of the primary beneficiary designation is without merit.\n\n       The Court in Martinez notes that even if the insurer is correct regarding concerns that a\n\nCOB request may violate a divorce decree, “the policy still said that a change would take effect\n\nwhen a request was signed, not when it was accepted.” [Emphasis in original]. Id. at 803.\n\nPruco’s Policy with Dr. Garcia provided, “[i]f we receive your request . . . we will file and record\n\nthe change and it will take effect as of the date you signed the request.” Pruco’s Policy language\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fis essentially equivalent to the Martinez policy language,10 and we find no reason not to adopt the\n\nsame rationale as the Martinez Court.\n\n           Like Pruco, the insurer in Martinez, also raised the issue of standing of the designee of the\n\ninsured’s rejected COB request. Pruco argues Sagarnaga has no standing because they rejected\n\nthe COB request of Dr. Garcia. However, like Martinez, if the COB request is valid and the\n\ninsured substantially complied, Sagarnaga is a beneficiary whose right’s vested when her husband\n\ndied.\n\n           Pruco contends that Harris serves to resolve the standing argument. The policy at issue in\n\nHarris contained a similar provision to that construed in Martinez and required that “any change\n\n[of beneficiary] must be in a written form satisfactory to [Nationwide].” See Harris, 245 S.W.3d\n\nat 483; Martinez, 216 S.W.3d at 801. However, in contrast to the policy in Martinez, the Harris\n\npolicy required that any change be “recorded” at the insurer’s home office. More importantly, the\n\noriginal beneficiary in Harris was designated an “irrevocable” beneficiary. Harris, 245 S.W.3d\n\nat 483. The insurer in Harris rejected an initial COB request of the “irrevocable” beneficiary, but\n\nlater accepted the COB where the sole “irrevocable beneficiary” signed the COB form, thereby\n\nconsenting to the change. Id. at 485. We find the facts in Harris distinguishable from the facts\n\nin this case.\n\n           Dr. Garcia contacted Pruco and advised them he wished to change his beneficiary\n\ndesignations. Pruco sent him a partially completed COB form. Dr. Garcia completed the\n\n10\n     The policy stated:\n\n           Change of Beneficiary Designation: You may make a change while the Insured is alive by sending\n           us a request. The change will take effect the date the request is signed, but the change will not\n           affect any action we have taken before we receive the request. We have the right to request your\n           policy to make the change on it.\n\nMartinez, 216 S.W.3d at 802, n.11.\n                                                          13\n\fremaining information and returned the COB request to Pruco. It is undisputed Dr. Garcia’s\n\nprimary beneficiary designation was clear and unambiguous. Pruco’s argument that the failure to\n\nrecord the COB request in its’ entirety is justifiable because they found the contingency\n\ndesignation unclear is without merit.              This is particularly true, in light of the fact that at\n\nDr. Garcia’s death, all the primary beneficiaries listed were living, rendering the\n\n“additional/special beneficiary” language inapplicable.                    We find that Dr. Garcia met the\n\nsubstantial compliance test and had “done all that he could reasonably have done” to effect the\n\nchange.” Tips v.

The Policy is a contract. Dr. Garcia\n\nsubstantially complied with the COB requirements, Sagarnaga became vested on Dr. Garcia’s\n\ndeath, and 50 percent of the Policy proceeds were to be paid to Sagarnaga. Pruco failed to tender\n\nthe 50 percent policy death benefit to Sagarnaga. The trial court found Sagarnaga incurred\n\ndamages as a result of Pruco’s failure to pay the Policy benefits, specifically, having to pay the\n\nchildren $90,000 from Sagarnaga’s 50 percent of the Policy death benefits that had been deposited\n\nin the court’s registry. The elements of a breach of contract are met in the instant case and we\n\noverrule Pruco’s second issue.\n\n                                      Texas’ Prompt Pay Statute\n\n        Pruco’s fifth issue and part of their third complaint both involve Chapter 542 of the Texas\n\nInsurance Code, known as the Prompt Pay Statute. Pruco asserts the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the finding that Pruco violated the TEX.INS.CODE ANN. §§ 542.051\n\n– 542.061. In addition, the court erred in awarding Sagarnaga statutory penalty interest pursuant\n\n\n                                                15\n\fto TEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 542.060 (West 2009). We disagree.\n\n       Section 542.055 provides than an insurer, within 15 days of receipt of a claim, is to\n\nacknowledge receipt, commence investigation and request “all items, statements, and forms that\n\nthe insurer reasonably believes, at that time, will be required from the claimant.” TEX.INS.CODE\n\nANN. § 542.055(a). The statute provides that a “notice of claim” is defined as any written\n\nnotification by a claimant to an insurer. TEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 542.051(4). If the insurer denies\n\nthe claim, such denial must be “not later than the 15th business day after the date the insurer\n\nreceives all items, statements, and forms required by the insurer . . . .” TEX.INS.CODE ANN.\n\n§ 542.056(a). Subsection (a) of Section 542.058 states if an insurer “after receiving all items,\n\nstatements, and forms reasonably requested” under Section 542.055 delays payment of the claim\n\nfor more than 60 days (or that period another applicable statute specifies), the insurer shall pay\n\n“damages and other items” in accordance with Section 542.060.                   TEX.INS.CODE ANN.\n\n§ 542.058(a).\n\n       If an insurer is liable for a claim that is not in compliance with the Prompt Payment\n\nsubchapter, the insurer is liable for interest on the claim of 18 percent a year as damages, and\n\nreasonable attorney fees. TEX.INS.CODE ANN. §542.060(a). In June of 2009, the following\n\nprovision was added to Section 542.058:\n\n       (c) A life insurer that receives notice of an adverse, bona fide claim to all or part of\n       the proceeds of the policy before the applicable payment deadline under Subsection\n       (a) shall pay the claim or properly file an interpleader action and tender the benefits\n       into the registry of the court not later than the 90th day after the date the insurer\n       receives all items, statements, and forms reasonably requested and required under\n       Section 542.055. A life insurer that delays payment of the claim or the filing of an\n       interpleader and tender of policy proceeds for more than 90 days shall pay damages\n       and other items as provided by Section 542.060 until the claim is paid or an\n       interpleader is properly filed.\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fTEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 542.058(c).12\n\n        Additionally, Section 542.061 provides: “[t]he remedies provided by this subchapter are\n\nin addition to any other remedy or procedure provided by law or at common law.”\n\n        Dr. Garcia died on September 22, 2009. The children each filed a claim for benefits under\n\nthe Policy by October 15, 2009. On October 21, 2009, Sagarnaga called Pruco to assert her claim\n\nto the death benefit. She also sent a letter that day reiterating her position that Dr. Garcia signed a\n\nCOB making her a 50 percent beneficiary. Subsequently, Pruco receives Sagarnaga’s letter\n\nregarding her claim. Pruco referred the file to its claims department for handling as an adverse\n\nclaims case on October 27. On November 3, Pruco sends a letter to Sagarnaga rejecting her\n\nclaim, stating the children are the only beneficiaries. On November 13, Pruco sent a letter to\n\nSagarnaga requesting her to submit documents verifying Dr. Garcia’s intent regarding the change\n\nof beneficiary.\n\n        On December 17, the children filed their original petition against Pruco for the entire\n\nbenefit under the Policy.            On January 8, 2010, Pruco answered the children’s suit,\n\ncounterclaimed, and included “a third party action in interpleader against Sagarnaga seeking to\n\ndeposit the Death Benefit” with the court. On March 9, Pruco filed a “Motion to Interplead Funds\n\nand Dismiss,” arguing that Pruco is “ready, willing and able to pay the Death Benefit” and was\n\nrequesting the “Court’s permission to deposit the Death Benefit with the Court.” Pruco was also\n\nseeking, after the death benefit was paid, that Pruco “shall be fully and completely discharged of\n\nany and all liabilities to the claimants . . . .” On May 7, the court signed an order in which Pruco’s\n\nmotion to dismiss was denied, but ordered the $375,000, plus interest payable pursuant to the\n\n\n12\n  Amended by Acts 2009, 81st Leg., ch. 833, § 1, eff. June 19, 2009. This subsection was in effect prior to\nDr. Garcia’s death in September of 2009.\n                                                        17\n\fPolicy, to be deposited immediately into the registry of the court. On August 3, the court signed\n\nan agreed order which reflected that Pruco had deposited $382,483.50 into the court’s registry on\n\nJune 3.\n\n          The trial court, in her conclusions of law, held Sagarnaga was entitled to $135,000 of\n\nstatutory interest for the violation of Chapter 542, commencing on November 3, 2009, and “[t]he\n\nCompany is liable to Sagarnaga for wrongfully delaying payment to Sagarnaga for more than 60\n\ndays after receiving notice of the Sagarnaga claim.” On January 25, 2012, the court signed an\n\namended judgment awarding Sagarnaga “statutory interest damages . . . on the Claim Amount as\n\ncalculated at the rate of 18% per year commencing on November 3, 2009, and ending on the day\n\npreceding the date of judgment was rendered.”\n\n          Notice of claim is written notification by the claimant to the insurer, and it is undisputed\n\nPruco received written notice from Sagarnaga.             TEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 542.051(4).         On\n\nNovember 3, Pruco sent written notice to Sagarnaga rejecting her claim, which complied with\n\nTEX.INS.CODE ANN. § 542.056(a). The interpleader was filed on January 8, but the tender of the\n\ndeath benefits into the registry of the court was not accomplished until June 3, 2010.\n\n          Pruco argues that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the court’s\n\nfinding that Pruco violated the Section 542.058. First, Pruco agues they required additional time\n\nto conduct an investigation into Dr. Garcia’s death, thus the Section 542.058 deadlines were not\n\ntriggered until after November 2009. Second, Pruco was presented with “adverse, bonafide”\n\nclaims, so Section 542.058(c) ninety-day deadline applies. Finally, Pruco’s interpleader was filed\n\nprior to the expiration of ninety days, so therefore, they did not violate the Prompt Pay statute. In\n\nsupport of their claim the interpleader was filed timely, Pruco points to the express language of\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fSection 542.058(c) and the holding in Martinez.\n\n       In Martinez, the trial court assessed the statutory penalty interest after the interpleader was\n\nfiled and until the final judgment was signed, some nine months later. Martinez, 216 S.W.3d at\n\n805. The Texas Supreme Court held, “only the absence of rival claims” would justify continuing\n\nthe statutory penalty of Section 542.060(a) after interpleader occurs. Id. at 807. Pruco urges this\n\nCourt to construe Martinez for the proposition that “interpleader sufficed in place of payment.”\n\nId. at 806. However, in Martinez, the policy proceeds were deposited into the trial court’s registry\n\non the same day the interpleader was filed. Id. at 801. In fact, the interpleader was filed and the\n\npolicy proceeds were deposited seventy-two days from the prompt payment sixty-day deadline,\n\nthereby exceeding it only by twelve days. Id. at 807. The court held the insurer owed the\n\nstatutory penalties only for the twelve days it had missed the Section 542.058 deadline. Id. at\n\n807-08.\n\n       The Martinez court repeatedly emphasized the payment of the proceeds into the court’s\n\nregistry tolls the statute’s interest penalties. A careful reading of Martinez reveals the Court used\n\n“interpleader” and “deposit of the proceeds” interchangeably, and understood those actions would\n\noccur nearly simultaneously. Id. at 806, 807. The court stated, “the statute seeks to get policies\n\npaid as quickly as possible, it is not advanced by paying the wrong party, a consequence that\n\ninterpleader avoids.” Id. at 806. Further, “an insurer that tenders part of the policy proceeds\n\nmust pay penalties only on the remainder . . . .” Id. at 807. The court reasoned that “an insurer\n\nthat interpleads the entire policy proceeds owes nothing more, and should not have to pay penalties\n\non the presumption that it does.” Martinez, 216 S.W.3d at 807.\n\n       Pruco correctly points out Martinez was decided in 2007, prior to the enactment of Section\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f542.058(c). Turning to the express language of the statute, firstly, we note that it states “file an\n\ninterpleader action and tender the benefits into the registry of the court . . . .” Secondly, it also\n\nstates, that “[a] life insurer that delays payment of the claim or the filing of an interpleader and\n\ntender of policy proceeds,” if greater than ninety days, is subject to the statutory interest penalty of\n\nSection 542.060(a). It is clear to us that the Legislature has intentionally coupled the filing of the\n\ninterpleader action and the deposit of the policy proceeds into the court’s registry in order to toll\n\nthe assessment of the statutory interest under Section 542.060(a).\n\n        Therefore, we hold that the statutory interest, pursuant to Section 542.060(a), shall begin\n\nthe day after the deadline ends under Section 542.058(a) or (c), that being either day sixty-one or\n\nday ninety-one. The interest penalty, in accordance with Martinez, shall accrue until the day\n\nbefore the policy proceeds have been deposited into the court’s registry. In the case at hand, the\n\ntender of the Policy proceeds into the court’s registry occurred on June 3, 2010. Therefore, the\n\ncourt erred in assessing the statutory interest until January 24, 2012.\n\n        Next, we turn to the sufficiency of the court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law that\n\n(1) Pruco had an obligation to pay Sagarnaga within sixty days under Section 542.058(a); and (2)\n\nthat obligation began on November 3, 2009. The court found Sagarnaga was a beneficiary and it\n\nis incontrovertible that Sagarnaga was not paid the Policy benefits within sixty days of her claim.\n\nPruco asserts they may delay payment up to ninety days under Section 542.058(c) if they have\n\nreceived “notice of an adverse, bona fide claim . . . .” However, in order to avail themselves of the\n\npayment delay of ninety days, Pruco shoulders the burden of proof in showing that Sagarnaga and\n\nthe children had adverse, bona fide claims to the Policy. However, here the record is woefully\n\ndevoid of evidence that Sagarnaga and the children were bona-fide adverse claimants. Pruco has\n\n\n                                                  20\n\ffailed to show they are entitled to the extra thirty days Section 542.058(c) affords them, and the\n\nevidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the court’s finding Pruco violated Section\n\n542.058(a).\n\n       On October 21, Pruco first became aware of Sagarnaga’s claim. Pruco then received\n\nwritten notice of her claim. On November 3, 2009, Pruco rejected Sagarnaga’s claim asserting\n\nthe sole beneficiaries to the Policy were the children.      Then in a seeming about-face, on\n\nNovember 13, Pruco requests Sagarnaga provide further documentation to support her claim.\n\nPruco points to their November 13 letter to show that they were continuing to evaluate Sagarnaga’s\n\nclaim through November 2009 and therefore is not liable to pay the death benefit on November 3,\n\n2009. As Pruco was able to deny Sagarnaga’s claim on November 3, ostensibly, they had\n\nconcluded their investigation as to whether benefits were payable and to whom. We find that the\n\nevidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the court’s conclusion that Pruco delayed\n\npayment for over sixty days beginning on November 3, 2009.\n\n       The interpleader and the deposit of policy proceeds should have occurred by January 2,\n\n2010, under Section 542.058(a) in order to avoid the statutory penalties. The death benefits owed\n\nto Sagarnaga were deposited into the court’s registry by Pruco on June 3, 2010. The imposition of\n\nthe statutory interest in accordance with Section 542.060(a) should begin the sixty-first day after\n\nNovember 3, 2009 and end the day before June 3, 2010. In accordance with our opinion, the\n\nstatutory interest would commence on January 3, 2010 and end on June 2, 2010. Under our\n\nholding and these facts, Pruco violated both Section 542.058(a), in that their tender of the policy\n\nproceeds into the court’s registry exceeded the sixty days deadline.\n\n       We overrule Pruco’s fifth issue and part of their third issue as to Chapter 542 and the\n\n\n                                                21\n\fimposition of the 18 percent statutory interest under Section 542.060(a).\n\n                                         Attorney’s fees\n\n       In its sixth issue, Pruco contends the evidence supporting the award of Sagarnaga’s\n\nattorney’s fees is legally and factually insufficient. Pruco points to the failure of the testifying\n\nattorney to segregate the attorneys’ fees accrued under the breach of contract claim and of those\n\nfees that accrued under Sagarnaga’s other claims.\n\n       Whether segregation is necessary is a question of law, subject to de novo review.\n\nPenhollow Custom Homes, LLC v.

Unsegregated fees are some\n\nevidence of what the segregated amount should be, therefore, remand for segregation of fees may\n\nbe required when at least some of the fees at issue are attributable to claims for which attorney’s\n\nfees are recoverable. Id.\n\n       In the instant case, Sagarnaga’s claims and counterclaims involved breach of contract,\n\n\n                                                22\n\fviolation of the Prompt Payment Statute, common-law and statutory bad faith, negligence and\n\nTexas Insurance Code violations. The judgment awarded Sagarnaga $200,000 in attorney’s fees.\n\n        When Sagarnaga’s counsel, Pierce, testified to his attorney’s fees, he stated:\n\n                The only other point I wish to make is that I have not attempted to segregate\n        fees in this case, because there are essentially to some degree three lawsuits that\n        were being litigated: Ms. Sagarnaga versus the children, Ms. Sagarnaga versus\n        Mr. Schmid and Ms. Sagarnaga versus Prudential. However, the facts of one and\n        the facts of all are the same.\n\nPierce further testified:\n\n        It is my opinion that it’s not really possible to tease out any particular part of any\n        claim or cause of action, because the facts of the three cases are so interrelated that\n        it was all going to be generated whether or not there was a claim against\n        Mr. Schmid directly or it was just against Prudential.\n\nWhile Pierce referred to an “affidavit” relating to his fees, the exhibit introduced at trial was the\n\nbilling records. Even a cursory review of the billing records indicates billing entries relating to\n\nSchmid – who Sagarnaga raised negligence allegations against in her claims. Pierce made no\n\neffort to estimate a possible segregation of fees in his testimony. While the standard does not\n\nmandate the maintenance of separate time records when drafting the different claims, an opinion\n\nwould be sufficient as to the percentages of segregation as to the claims.

Id. at 573–74.\n\n       We find the reasoning of Tony Gullo Motors and Allan appropriate in the instant case,\n\nparticularly with the lack of opinion regarding segregation of fees and the evidence presented\n\nwhich included fees for claims where attorney’s fees would have been unrecoverable.\n\n       We sustain Pruco’s sixth issue.
