Smith\n(argued); Major Zaven T. Saroyan.\n\n\nFor Appellee and Cross-Appellant: Major Daniel J. Breen\n(argued); Lieutenant Colonel C. Taylor Smith and Gerald R.\nBruce, Esq. (on brief).\n\n\nMilitary Judge:    W. Shane Cohen\n\n\n\n\n            THIS OPINION IS SUBJECT TO REVISION BEFORE FINAL PUBLICATION.\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     Judge STUCKY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n     Article 12 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)\n\nprovides that:    “No member of the armed forces may be placed in\n\nconfinement in immediate association with enemy prisoners or\n\nother foreign nationals not members of the armed forces.”\n\n10 U.S.C. § 812 (2012).   The Judge Advocate General of the Air\n\nForce certified to this Court the question of whether Article\n\n12, UCMJ, applies to members of the armed forces confined in a\n\nstate or federal facility within the continental limits of the\n\nUnited States.1   We also granted Senior Airman (SrA) McPherson’s\n\npetition asking whether a confinee must exhaust administrative\n\nremedies before being entitled to relief under Article 12.\n\nBecause Article 12 is clear on its face, we hold that it applies\n\nto military members confined in civilian state or federal\n\nfacilities in the United States.       We further hold that under\n\nArticle 12, a confinee must exhaust his administrative remedies\n\nprior to judicial intervention.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  The certified issue is the same as the issue we specified for\nthe United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals to\nconsider on remand in United States v. Wilson, 72 M.J. 447\n(C.A.A.F. 2013) (summary disposition). In that case, the lower\ncourt held that Article 12, UCMJ, does apply in such\ncircumstances. United States v. Wilson, 73 M.J. 529, 531, 533\n(A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2014). The Air Force Judge Advocate\nGeneral certified the same issue to this Court in both cases,\nand we considered them together.\n\n                                   2\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n                              I.    Posture\n\n     A military judge sitting as a special court-martial\n\nconvicted SrA McPherson, pursuant to his pleas, of being absent\n\nwithout leave and distributing drugs.         Articles 86 and 112a,\n\nUCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §§ 886, 912a (2012).        The military judge also\n\nconvicted him, contrary to his pleas, of fraudulent enlistment;\n\nanother specification of being absent without leave; making a\n\nfalse official statement; wrongfully possessing and using drugs;\n\nand incapacitating himself for the performance of duties.\n\nArticles 83, 86, 107, 112a, and 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §§ 883,\n\n886, 907, 912a, 934 (2012).    The convening authority approved\n\nthe sentence that the military judge adjudged:        a bad-conduct\n\ndischarge, confinement for eight months, reduction to the lowest\n\nenlisted grade, and a reprimand.         The United States Air Force\n\nCourt of Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed.        United States v.\n\nMcPherson, 72 M.J. 862 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2013)\n\n(reconsideration and reconsideration en banc denied on Jan. 6,\n\n2014).\n\n                         II.       Background\n\n     After his conviction and sentence, SrA McPherson was\n\ninitially confined for fifteen days at the Elmore County\n\nDetention Facility in Idaho.       Id. at 869.    SrA McPherson alleged\n\nto the CCA and before this Court that “for eight of those days,\n\nhe was housed in an open bay with a foreign national known only\n\n\n                                     3\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\nas ‘The Mexican,’ who was awaiting deportation hearings.”    Id.\n\nSrA McPherson and “The Mexican” played card games together every\n\nnight while in confinement.   Id.\n\n     SrA McPherson did not seek clemency from the convening\n\nauthority for being confined in immediate association with an\n\nalleged foreign national, nor did he notify anyone at the\n\nconfinement facility or in his chain of command, even after he\n\nwas transferred to the Naval Consolidated Brig Miramar.    Id.     He\n\nfirst raised the issue in his appeal to the CCA.    Id.\n\n     In its decision, the CCA did not specifically address\n\nwhether Article 12, UCMJ, applies to military members confined\n\nin a state or federal facility within the United States.\n\nRather, it evaluated whether relief for an alleged Article 12\n\nviolation is available where a confinee did not exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies.    Id. at 867-70.   The CCA found “no\n\n‘unusual or egregious circumstance’ to excuse [SrA McPherson’s]\n\nfailure to pursue available administrative remedies,” and\n\ndeclined to grant relief.   Id.\n\n     On December 9, 2013, the Government filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration and reconsideration en banc, alleging that, by\n\nemploying an exhaustion of remedies analysis, the CCA had\n\n“implicitly establishe[d] as a matter of law in the Air Force\n\nthat Article 12 applies to civilian confinement facilities.”\n\nThe CCA summarily denied the motion on January 6, 2014.    The\n\n\n                                    4\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\ncase is now before us on the Judge Advocate General’s\n\ncertification.\n\n                      III.   Certified Issue\n\n     “Interpreting Article 12, UCMJ, is an issue of statutory\n\ninterpretation, which we review de novo.”   United States v.\n\nWise, 64 M.J. 468, 473 (C.A.A.F. 2007).\n\n     As in all statutory construction cases, we begin with\n     the language of the statute. The first step is to\n     determine whether the language at issue has a plain\n     and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular\n     dispute in the case. The inquiry ceases if the\n     statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory\n     scheme is coherent and consistent.\n\nBarnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., Inc., 534 U.S. 438, 450 (2002)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).   Whether the\n\nstatutory language is ambiguous is determined “by reference to\n\nthe language itself, the specific context in which that language\n\nis used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.”\n\nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997).\n\n     Here, the text of Article 12 is plain on its face:      “No\n\nmember of the armed forces may be placed in confinement in\n\nimmediate association with enemy prisoners or other foreign\n\nnationals not members of the armed forces.”    There is no\n\ngeographic limitation by its terms, so this Court will not read\n\nany such limitation into the plain language of the statute.\n\nRather, we “must presume that a legislature says in a statute\n\nwhat it means and means in a statute what it says there.”\n\n\n                                 5\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\nConnecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253–54 (1992).\n\nArticle 12 applies to military members in state or federal\n\nconfinement facilities without geographic limitation.    “When the\n\nwords of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is\n\nalso the last:    judicial inquiry is complete.”   Id. at 254\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     The Government claims that Article 12 conflicts with\n\nArticle 58, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 858 (2012), necessitating\n\nadditional statutory interpretation.   Article 58 provides:\n\n     [A] sentence of confinement adjudged by a court-\n     martial . . . may be carried into execution by\n     confinement in any place of confinement under the\n     control of any of the armed forces or in any penal or\n     correctional institution under the control of the\n     United States, or which the United States may be\n     allowed to use. Persons so confined in a penal or\n     correctional institution not under the control of one\n     of the armed forces are subject to the same discipline\n     and treatment as persons confined or committed by the\n     courts of the United States . . . .\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n     “‘When a statute is a part of a larger Act . . . the\n\nstarting point for ascertaining legislative intent is to look to\n\nother sections of the Act in pari materia with the statute under\n\nreview.’”   United States v. Diaz, 69 M.J. 127, 133 (C.A.A.F.\n\n2010) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v.\n\nMcGuinness, 35 M.J. 149, 153 (C.M.A. 1992)); see also United\n\nSav. Ass’n v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Assoc., Ltd., 484 U.S.\n\n365, 371 (1988) (stating that statutory construction is a\n\n\n                                  6\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n“holistic endeavor”).   Both Article 12 and Article 58 address\n\ntreatment of military members in confinement:   Article 58\n\nrequires all confinees to be treated the same, and Article 12\n\nrequires that no military member may be confined in immediate\n\nassociation with a foreign national.   Arguing that Article 58’s\n\n“same treatment” provision is more specific than Article 12, the\n\nGovernment asks us to apply the rule of statutory interpretation\n\nthat, “[w]here Congress includes particular language in one\n\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the same\n\nAct,” Congress “intentionally and purposely” intended “the\n\ndisparate inclusion or exclusion.”   Bates v. United States, 522\n\nU.S. 23, 29–30 (1997) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464\n\nU.S. 16, 23 (1983)) (internal quotation marks omitted).    The\n\nGovernment argues this rule means that the specificity of\n\nArticle 58 must apply to Article 12 too.\n\n     But Article 58 is not more specific than Article 12, nor\n\nare the two statutes in conflict.    Military confinees can -- and\n\nmust -- receive treatment equal to civilians confined in the\n\nsame institution, while being confined separately from foreign\n\nnationals.   This Court has no license to generate a statutory\n\nconflict where none exists or to construe statutes in a way that\n\n“undercut[s] the clearly expressed intent of Congress.”    United\n\nStates v. Bartlett, 66 M.J. 426, 428 (C.A.A.F. 2008).     Article\n\n12 and Article 58 were passed at the same time, and read in pari\n\n\n                                 7\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\nmateria, they both apply without conflict to military members\n\nconfined in state or federal institutions in the United States.2\n\n     The Government responds that this holding generates “absurd\n\nresults” for confinement conditions.      See, e.g., Wilson, 73 M.J.\n\nat 534 (noting that the appellant was placed in solitary\n\nconfinement to avoid a violation of Article 12 because the\n\ncounty jail where he was confined “ha[d] no system of\n\nidentifying foreign nationals”).       A confinee subject to solitary\n\nconfinement in these circumstances might then raise a claim of a\n\nviolation of Article 55, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 855 (2012)\n\n(prohibiting cruel or unusual punishment).\n\n     The methods by which civilian facilities may enforce\n\nArticle 12 are matters of policy and are not before this Court.\n\nSince solitary confinement is certainly not the sole method for\n\nimplementing the requirements of the statute, the plain language\n\nof Article 12 does not dictate absurd results.      Any such\n\ndecisions come from fiscal decisions made by the military\n\ndepartments, not from the operation of the statute.\n\n\n\n2\n  We therefore disagree with the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit, which held that “Article\n58 trumps Article 12.” Webber v. Bureau of Prisons, No. 02-\n5113, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 18796, at *2, 2002 WL 31045957, at *1\n(D.C. Cir. Sept. 12, 2002) (per curiam). The D.C. Circuit found\nno precedential value in this opinion, however, and it has no\nprecedential authority for this Court either. See Circuit Rules\nof the United States Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia, Circuit Rule 36(e)(2).\n\n                                   8\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n                         IV.   Granted Issue\n\n     In his petition, SrA McPherson argues that the CCA erred in\n\nholding that a confinee must exhaust administrative remedies\n\nbefore receiving any relief for a violation of Article 12, UCMJ.3\n\nWe disagree and affirm the holding of the court below.\n\n     The CCA relied on Wise, 64 M.J. at 471, to hold that\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies is a prerequisite to\n\nrelief under Article 12.   McPherson, 72 M.J. at 869.    In Wise,\n\nthis Court addressed an appellant’s claim of being confined with\n\nenemy prisoners of war in Iraq in violation of both Article 12\n\nand Article 55, UCMJ.   64 M.J. at 470.   The Court observed that\n\na prisoner must exhaust administrative remedies in his detention\n\nfacility before he can “invok[e] judicial intervention to\n\nredress concerns regarding post-trial confinement conditions,”\n\nabsent “some unusual or egregious circumstance.”   Id. at 469,\n\n471 (citing United States v. White, 54 M.J. 469, 472 (C.A.A.F.\n\n2001); United States v. Miller, 46 M.J. 248, 250 (C.A.A.F.\n\n1997)).    The Court’s analysis, though, was in an Article 55\n\ncontext.   Both White and Miller are Article 55 cases; neither\n\nmentions Article 12.    While the Wise Court did mention and\n\nanalyze Article 12 elsewhere in the opinion, we did not clarify\n\n\n3\n  SrA McPherson asserts that there is a split among service\ncourts on this issue. However, he cites no cases from the other\nservices in support of this point and it appears that none of\nthe other service courts has even addressed it.\n\n                                  9\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\nwhether the exhaustion-of-administrative-remedies analysis\n\nsprang from Article 12 or solely from Article 55.    We now hold\n\nthat a confinee must exhaust administrative remedies before\n\njudicial intervention for an Article 12 violation claim.\n\n     Article 12 regulates confinement conditions in a manner\n\nsimilar to Article 55’s limitations on permissible confinement\n\nconditions.   See United States v. Pena, 64 M.J. 259, 265\n\n(C.A.A.F. 2007) (taking note of Article 12’s requirements in the\n\ncontext of discussing Article 55’s prohibition of “cruel or\n\nunusual punishment”); United States v. Ellsey, 16 C.M.A. 455,\n\n458, 37 C.M.R. 75, 78 (1966) (listing Article 12’s provisions\n\namong the requirements for confinement conditions); cf. United\n\nStates v. Palmiter, 20 M.J. 90, 96 (C.M.A. 1985) (indicating\n\nthat Article 12 is applicable to pretrial confinement, and\n\n“commingling” under Article 12 is not punishment in and of\n\nitself).\n\n     Article 55 requires exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n\nUnited States v. Coffey, 38 M.J. 290, 291 (C.M.A. 1993) (“While\n\nArticle 55 . . . prohibits [cruel or unusual] punishment, and\n\nunder appropriate conditions we might exercise our power to\n\nissue an extraordinary writ, a prisoner must seek administrative\n\nrelief prior to invoking judicial intervention.”).   Consistent\n\nwith Wise, we find that this exhaustion-of-remedies requirement\n\nis applicable under Article 12 as well.\n\n\n                                10\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n     There are practical and policy reasons to apply this\n\nrequirement to Article 12 relief.      This administrative\n\nexhaustion requirement furthers two related goals:     (1) the\n\n“resolution of grievances at the lowest possible level” with\n\n“prompt amelioration” of the complaint while the prisoner\n\nsuffers the condition, and (2) the development of an adequate\n\nrecord to aid appellate review.    Wise, 64 M.J. at 471 (citing\n\nMiller, 46 M.J. at 250).\n\n     This case demonstrates why these goals are so important.\n\nSrA McPherson did not raise this issue to local confinement\n\nofficials or to anyone in his chain of command.     See id. at 472.\n\nDuring this time, though, he did learn of a process for filing\n\ncomplaints and also complained to his first sergeant that he was\n\nnot receiving his prescription medications.     SrA McPherson did\n\nnot raise the Article 12 issue in his clemency submissions to\n\nthe convening authority, nor did he file a grievance with the\n\nconfinement facility or make an Article 138, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §\n\n938 (2012), complaint.   Since SrA McPherson did not complain of\n\nthis condition until appeal, there are no details of his\n\nconfinement conditions for an appellate court to review:     we\n\nknow only that he alleges he was confined with a man he calls\n\n“The Mexican” who said he was awaiting deportation proceedings.\n\n“[T]he Air Force was unable to investigate the claims, make a\n\nrecord of it for review, or have the opportunity to immediately\n\n\n                                  11\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\ncorrect the situation, as warranted.”       McPherson, 72 M.J. at\n\n869.\n\n       Wise is still good law.   To obtain relief for an Article 12\n\nviolation, a confinee must exhaust available administrative\n\nremedies absent unusual or egregious circumstances.      In this\n\ncase, SrA McPherson concededly did not exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies.   The CCA did not err in finding no\n\n“unusual or egregious circumstance” to excuse his failure to\n\nexhaust remedies.   Thus, SrA McPherson is not entitled to relief\n\nunder Article 12.\n\n                            V.   Decision\n\n       The judgment of the United States Air Force Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  12\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     BAKER, Chief Judge (concurring in part and dissenting in\n\npart):\n\n     I concur with the majority’s judgment that to obtain relief\n\nfor an Article 12, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10\n\nU.S.C. § 812 (2012), violation, a confinee must exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies absent unusual or egregious\n\ncircumstances.   As the Court in Wise stated, “[a] prisoner must\n\nseek administrative relief prior to invoking judicial\n\nintervention to redress concerns regarding post-trial\n\nconfinement conditions.”   United States v. Wise, 64 M.J. 468,\n\n469 (C.A.A.F. 2007).   Exhaustion serves two purposes.    First, it\n\nis intended to effect “prompt amelioration of a prisoner’s\n\nconditions of confinement.”   Id. at 471.   Second, it allows\n\ndevelopment of an adequate record for appellate review where the\n\nconfinement conditions are not redressed or the prisoner seeks\n\nadditional redress.    See United States v. Miller, 46 M.J. 248,\n\n250 (C.A.A.F. 1997).\n\n     I disagree, however, with the majority’s conclusion\n\nregarding Article 12, UCMJ.   Read literally, Article 12, UCMJ,\n\nconflicts with Article 58, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 858 (2012).\n\nTherefore, one must look beyond the text of Article 12, UCMJ, to\n\ndetermine congressional intent.   That intent is clear:   on the\n\none hand, to prevent the confinement of servicemembers in\n\nimmediate association with enemy combatants and foreign\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\nnationals in military detention, and, on the other hand, to\n\npermit the transfer of servicemembers to federal prisons in\n\norder to facilitate their rehabilitation and promote discipline\n\nin military confinement facilities.    As a result, the majority’s\n\nliteral application of the statutory text of Article 12, UCMJ,\n\nproduces a result demonstrably at odds with the intent of its\n\ndrafters and with Article 58, UCMJ.\n\n     This case provides an opportunity to invoke almost every\n\ncanon of statutory construction known to Sutherland.    2A N.\n\nSinger & S. Singer, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory\n\nConstruction (7th rev. ed. 2014).     Three principles should\n\ndecide this case.    First, where congressional intent is not\n\nclear, look to legislative history.    Second, read the statutory\n\nscheme as a whole.    Third, do not reach an absurd result.\n\nApplying these principles, I would hold that the plain language\n\nof Article 12, UCMJ, compels an absurd result when read in\n\nconjunction with equally clear language of Article 58, UCMJ.\n\nWhile Article 12, UCMJ, prohibits confinement of a servicemember\n\nin immediate association with a foreign national, Article 58,\n\nUCMJ, requires that a servicemember in civilian confinement\n\nreceive the same treatment as his or her civilian counterpart.\n\nIt also expressly -- by design and with intent -- enables the\n\nmilitary to transfer servicemembers to federal facilities to\n\nserve their prison sentences.    The majority’s interpretation of\n\n\n                                  2\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\nthe law defeats this purpose in light of the number of foreign\n\nnationals in the general U.S. prison population both at the time\n\nof the passage of the UCMJ and today.\n\n     The majority pretends otherwise.   Yet to comply with\n\nArticle 12, UCMJ, servicemembers are assigned to solitary\n\nconfinement in civilian confinement facilities, despite\n\notherwise complying with prison rules and regulations, because\n\nthe armed forces frequently use such facilities.   See, e.g.,\n\nJoshua R. Traeger, The Confinement of Military Members in\n\nCivilian Facilities, 39.1 A.F. Rep. 31, 33 (2012) (“[T]he use of\n\nlocal confinement facilities (vice facilities on base) is\n\nprevalent across the Air Force and, more specifically, Air\n\nCombat Command (ACC).   An informal poll of ACC military justice\n\nsections revealed that about fifty percent of ACC wings utilize\n\ncivilian confinement facilities for at least portions of their\n\nconfinement operations.”).   Given the approximately 350,000\n\nforeign nationals incarcerated in local jails and state and\n\nfederal prisons, the majority, in neglecting to read the\n\nstatutory language in its proper context, now makes it virtually\n\nimpossible for the armed forces to make use of civilian\n\nconfinement facilities, thus “undercut[ting] the clearly\n\nexpressed intent of Congress in enacting” Article 58, UCMJ.\n\nUnited States v. Bartlett, 66 M.J. 426, 428 (C.A.A.F. 2008).     By\n\nin effect requiring servicemembers to be in solitary\n\n\n                                 3\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\nconfinement, the decision also directly undermines the\n\n“rehabilitative” purpose of Article 58, UCMJ.\n\n                           Discussion\n\n     “In ascertaining the plain meaning of [a] statute, the\n\ncourt must look to the particular statutory language at issue,\n\nas well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.”\n\nMcCarthy v. Bronson, 500 U.S. 136, 139 (1991) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted); see also Crandon v.\n\nUnited States, 494 U.S. 152, 158 (1990) (“In determining the\n\nmeaning of the statute, we look not only to the particular\n\nstatutory language, but to the design of the statute as a whole\n\nand to its object and policy.”).       The Supreme Court has further\n\nstated:\n\n     In determining whether Congress has specifically\n     addressed the question at issue, a reviewing court\n     should not confine itself to examining a particular\n     statutory provision in isolation. The meaning -- or\n     ambiguity -- of certain words or phrases may only\n     become evident when placed in context. It is a\n     “fundamental canon of statutory construction that the\n     words of a statute must be read in their context and\n     with a view to their place in the overall statutory\n     scheme.” A court must therefore interpret the statute\n     “as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,” and\n     “fit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious\n     whole.”\n\nFood and Drug Admin. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529\n\nU.S. 120, 132-33 (2000) (citations omitted).      Supreme Court case\n\nlaw makes clear that a court should resort to legislative\n\nhistory if a literal reading of the statute would “impute[] to\n\n\n                                   4\n\fUnited States v.

The D.C. Circuit had no\n\ndifficulty applying the rules of statutory construction,\n\nsummarily declining to review a lower court’s dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint similar to the present action.   Requiring only three\n\nsentences, the court held:\n\n     Article 58 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice\n     states categorically that military prisoners housed in\n     Bureau of Prisons facilities shall be subject to the\n     same treatment as their civilian counterparts. It\n     does not create an exception concerning confinement\n     with foreign nationals, nor does Article 12 of the\n     Code provide that its prohibition against such\n     confinement survives Article 58’s same-treatment rule.\n     Thus, by its terms, Article 58 trumps Article 12, and\n\n\n                                5\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     the district court properly dismissed the complaint\n     for failure to state a claim.\n\nWebber v. Bureau of Prisons, No. 02-5113, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS\n\n18796, at *2, 2002 WL 31045957, at *1 (D.C. Cir. 2002)\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n     The legislative histories of Articles 12 and 58, UCMJ, make\n\nobvious that the drafters, informed by the experience of the\n\nSecond World War, intended for Article 12, UCMJ, to shield\n\nservicemembers from confinement with enemy prisoners of war and\n\nfor Article 58, UCMJ, to allow confinement of servicemembers in\n\nfederal prisons given their belief at the time in the civilian\n\ncriminal justice system’s superior expertise in providing\n\nrehabilitative services.   There was no suggestion by Congress\n\npreceding the passage of Article 58, UCMJ, that it would be\n\ncircumscribed by Article 12, UCMJ, surely a possibility likely\n\nto have been discussed given the confinement at the time of\n\nseveral thousand foreign nationals in U.S. civilian jails and\n\nprisons.   See Dep’t of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,\n\nNCJ-102529, Historical Corrections Statistics in the United\n\nStates 1850-1984 tbl.3-31 (1986).    The result of the majority’s\n\ninterpretation of Article 12, UCMJ -- namely, that\n\nservicemembers will continue to be placed in solitary\n\nconfinement in certain civilian facilities regardless of their\n\nbehavior -- is not the absurd result the drafters anticipated or\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\fUnited States v.

McPherson, __ M.J. __, __ (8)\n\n(C.A.A.F. 2014).    However, this conclusion is not supported\n\nunless one assumes the armed forces will build more prisons.\n\nNever mind that Article 58, UCMJ, was intended to avoid that\n\nnecessity by permitting transfer of military prisoners to the\n\ncivilian criminal justice system.     Nor does the majority explain\n\nhow the same-treatment language and rehabilitative intent of\n\nArticle 58, UCMJ, can be accomplished through the placement of\n\nmilitary prisoners in solitary confinement as is clearly\n\nrequired in many, if not all, facilities, given the number of\n\nforeign nationals -- 350,000 -- currently confined in U.S.\n\nprisons.   U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, GAO-11-187, Criminal\n\nAlien Statistics:    Information on Incarceration, Arrests, and\n\nCosts (2011).

McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\nall civilian facilities. 1   The majority has not demonstrated\n\notherwise.\n\n     To be sure, Article 12, UCMJ, expressly prohibits\n\nservicemembers from being “placed in confinement in immediate\n\nassociation with enemy prisoners or other foreign nationals not\n\nmembers of the armed forces.”    A literal reading of the article\n\nhas thus led a lower court to grant confinement credit to a\n\nservicemember for several days’ detention in a cell next to that\n\nof a Spanish-speaking inmate in North Dakota.    United States v.\n\nTowhill, No. ACM 37695, 2012 CCA LEXIS 94, at *7-*8, 2003 WL\n\n1059015, at *3 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. Mar. 16, 2012)\n\n(unpublished).   Such a result is entirely at odds with\n\nCongress’s intent in enacting Article 12, UCMJ.    The legislative\n\nhistory demonstrates the overriding purpose of Article 12, UCMJ,\n\nwas to prohibit confinement of a servicemember in the same cell\n\nwith a foreign national, particularly one engaged in military\n\nservice, in times of war.\n\n\n\n1\n  See Traeger, supra p. __ (3), at 33 (describing how the\nadmission of a single migrant worker to Cook County Jail,\nGeorgia, which is “approximately 2000 square feet in size, with\na bay-style general population area, a seventy-square-foot\nsegregation cell, a small gym, administrative offices and\nminimal outdoor space,” requires that servicemembers be “moved\nto the seventy-square-foot segregation cell” and “sometimes . .\n. [when the] general population is filled with three to four\nmigrant workers . . . the tiny segregation cell houses one, two\nor even three military members at a time (the third sleeping on\nthe floor)”).\n\n                                  8\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     The precursor to Article 12, UCMJ, Article of War 16,\n\nstated:\n\n     No person subject to military law shall be confined\n     with enemy prisoners or any other foreign nationals\n     outside of the continental limits of the United States,\n     nor shall any defendant awaiting trial be made subject\n     to punishment or penalties other than confinement prior\n     to sentence on charges against him.\n\nManual for Courts-Martial, U.S. Army app. 1 (1949 ed.) (MCM).\n\n     By the time Congress voted to pass the Uniform Code of\n\nMilitary Justice, in 1950, the text now codified as Article 12,\n\nUCMJ, provided:   “No member of the armed forces of the United\n\nStates shall be placed in confinement in immediate association\n\nwith enemy prisoners or other foreign nationals not members of\n\nthe armed forces of the United States.”   Uniform Code of\n\nMilitary Justice, ch. 169, art. 12, 64 Stat. 107, 112 (1950)\n\n(current version at 10 U.S.C. § 812 (2012)).   The language\n\nchanged only insofar as “confined with” was replaced by “in\n\nimmediate association with” and “outside the continental limits\n\nof the United States” was removed.   The commentary to Article\n\n12, UCMJ, described the first revision as necessary to allow\n\nconfinement of prisoners of war in a brig on an American naval\n\nvessel:\n\n     A[rticle] [of] W[ar] 16 could be interpreted to\n     prohibit the confinement of members of the armed\n     forces in a brig or building which contains prisoners\n     of war. Such construction would prohibit putting\n     naval personnel in the brig of a ship if the brig\n     contained prisoners from an enemy vessel. This\n\n\n                                 9\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     Article is intended to permit confinement in the same\n     guardhouse or brig, but would require segregation.\n\nSee Uniform Code of Military Justice:    Hearings on H.R. 2498\n\nBefore a Subcomm. of the H. Comm. on Armed Servs., 81st Cong.\n\n914 (1949), reprinted in Index and Legislative History, Uniform\n\nCode of Military Justice (1950) (not separately paginated)\n\n[hereinafter Legislative History].\n\n     Thus the emphasis was entirely on avoiding confinement of\n\nservicemembers with “enemy” prisoners.    The prominence of this\n\nfeature of the legislation was borne out in remarks by\n\nlegislators and staff members during a hearing before a\n\nsubcommittee of the House Committee on Armed Services.    A\n\nprofessional staff member, Robert W. Smart, described that the\n\npurpose of Article 12, UCMJ, was “to be sure that American boys\n\nwere not confined with prisoners of war or other enemy\n\nnationals,” to which the vice chairman of the subcommittee,\n\nRepresentative L. Mendel Rivers, replied, “[l]ike happened [sic]\n\nduring the war.”   Id.   Later Felix E. Larkin, an assistant\n\ngeneral counsel in the Department of Defense, elaborated on the\n\nreason for the change:\n\n          Now we have changed the wording and said --\n     “No member shall be placed in confinement in immediate\n     association --”\n\n     because as it read it conceivably could cause a number\n     of confinement difficulties.\n\n\n\n                                 10\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     . . . The service might have a difficult time overseas\n     if they could not confine a person with enemy prisoners\n     in that they could not even keep them in the same jail.\n\n          There may not be more than one jail or place of\n     confinement within the area. Then they just could not\n     restrain them or confine them at all.\n\n          We thought we kept the sense of the present law\n     but made it a little more flexible by saying “in\n     immediate association” which in effect would mean you\n     could keep them in the same jail by at least\n     segregating them in different cells. It further was\n     proposed for the Army, with no thought of the Navy --\n     the Navy you can visualize might have a great\n     difficulty aboard the ship when they captured an enemy\n     vessel and took foreign nationals.\n\n          Then they could not keep any offender of their own\n     in the same brig on ship board. We have changed that.\n\nId. at 914-15.   The second revision striking the geographical\n\nlimitation was explained only to this extent, and not entirely\n\nlucidly, also by Mr. Larkin:\n\n     We have deleted, if you will notice, “outside the\n     continental limits” and made it apply everyplace\n     [sic], but prohibit incarceration in close association\n     but not with [sic] because “with” has the connotation\n     that you could not keep them in the same prison and\n     there may be only one. They are the only differences\n     between what is in the law now and this article.\n\nId. at 915.\n\n     No one offered further justification for the modification.\n\nNo one posited or discussed the article’s application to\n\nconfinement of servicemembers in civilian facilities in the\n\nUnited States.\n\n\n\n\n                                11\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     So too the legislative history of Article 58, UCMJ, which\n\nwas passed in conjunction with Article 12, UCMJ, suggests\n\nCongress neither intended nor desired for servicemembers in\n\ncivilian confinement to be separated from foreign-born residents\n\nof the United States, such as migrant workers, who are not\n\nenemies of or hostile to the government.   Article 58(a), UCMJ,\n\nprovides:\n\n     [A] sentence of confinement . . . may be carried into\n     execution by confinement in any place of confinement\n     under the control of any of the armed forces or in any\n     penal or correctional institution under the control of\n     any of the armed forces or in any penal or correctional\n     institution under the control of the United States . .\n     . . Persons so confined in a penal or correctional\n     institution not under the control of one of the armed\n     forces are subject to the same discipline and treatment\n     as persons confined or committed by the courts of the\n     United States or of the State, District of Columbia, or\n     place in which the institution is situated.\n\n     Article 58, UCMJ, derives from Article of War 42 and\n\nArticle for the Government of the Navy (A.G.N.) 7.   Article 58,\n\nUCMJ, is broader than those articles in that it provides\n\nauthority for all branches of the armed forces to transfer a\n\nservicemember to civilian confinement for any offense.   The\n\ncommentary described the reason for the modification:\n\n     Subdivision (a) is derived from A.G.N. article 7 which\n     permits the Navy to transfer court-martial prisoners\n     to institutions under the control of the Department of\n     Justice. The Navy has found this practice to be\n     beneficial both to the service and to the prisoner.\n     Both the Army and Navy officers in charge of\n     correctional policies recommend the adoption of\n     subdivision (a). It is the policy of the armed forces\n\n\n                               12\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     to segregate youthful and rehabilitable prisoners from\n     the hardened criminals and incorrigibles and to\n     provide for the maximum rehabilitation of prisoners\n     for the purpose of restoration to duty or successful\n     adjustment in civil life. However, due to lack of\n     facilities and personnel with long and continuous\n     experience in the highly technical and specialized\n     phases of penology, the armed forces have serious\n     handicaps in dealing with prisoners with long civilian\n     criminal records, criminal psychopaths, sex deviates,\n     violent incorrigibles and other prisoners requiring\n     special treatment. The Army in operating under A.W.\n     42 has met with great difficulty in segregating the\n     varied types of prisoners and in giving them\n     specialized treatment. It is felt that the\n     rehabilitation of prisoners who create special\n     problems could be expedited by transferring them to\n     the highly specialized institutions under control of\n     the Department of Justice, which range from training\n     schools and reformatories to major penitentiaries and\n     provide for the treatment of prisoners according to\n     their needs.\n\n          From past experience, the services have found\n     that the type of treatment suited for individuals does\n     not depend on the type of offense or on the length of\n     the sentence. Many of the prisoners who cause special\n     problems in disciplinary barracks are those convicted\n     of military offenses, such as a.w.o.l. or desertion.\n\nLegislative History, supra pp. __ (9-10), at 1093-94.     The\n\nlegislative history also contains testimony by military\n\nofficials stating that a primary goal of Article 58, UCMJ, was\n\nto facilitate the reentry of recalcitrant servicemembers into\n\nthe armed forces by providing them access to the rehabilitative\n\nservices of the civilian prison system.    According to the\n\nstatement of Colonel Lloyd R. Garrison, Chief of the Correction\n\nBranch of the Adjutant General’s Office:\n\n\n\n\n                               13\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     We feel that rehabilitation in prisons, to get people\n     back in civil life, able [sic] to make their own\n     living, is extremely important.\n\n          The populations of Army disciplinary barracks\n     include prisoners of all types, ranging from youthful,\n     impressionable first offenders to men with long\n     civilian criminal records, criminal psychopaths, sex\n     deviates, and violent incorrigibles. Adequate\n     segregation for purposes of protecting young,\n     impressionable offenders from detrimental influences\n     and unwholesome contacts with the criminal types\n     mentioned, and the operation of suitable\n     rehabilitation programs to fit the varying needs of\n     the individuals concerned cannot be accomplished in an\n     institution in which all types are confined together.\n     It is, therefore, considered desirable to provide for\n     the confinement of different types of general\n     prisoners in separate institutions having adequate\n     facilities, trained personnel, and rehabilitation\n     programs designed to meet the needs of the particular\n     groups.\n\n          The Department of the Army does not have the\n     number and diversified types of confinement facilities\n     under its jurisdiction to provide for completely\n     adequate segregation, control, and rehabilitative\n     treatment of general prisoners by type. Further,\n     military personnel assigned to duty at Army\n     disciplinary barracks are subject to frequent\n     rotation, and do not have the opportunity to gain the\n     maturity of experience and training in the highly\n     specialized professional and technical work involved\n     in the administration of major correctional\n     institutions, and in the control and treatment of the\n     types of offenders involved. It would not be\n     economical or in keeping with the primary mission for\n     the Department of the Army to operate the number and\n     types of institutions and provide the trained\n     personnel required to meet these needs.\n\n          . . . .\n\n          In addition, it is considered desirable that the\n     Department of the Army have access to the specialized\n     facilities of the Federal Prison System for the\n     rehabilitative treatment of individual offenders where\n\n\n                               14\n\fUnited States v.

We further hold that under\n\nArticle 12, a confinee must exhaust his administrative remedies\n\nprior to judicial intervention.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  The certified issue is the same as the issue we specified for\nthe United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals to\nconsider on remand in United States v.

Posture\n\n     A military judge sitting as a special court-martial\n\nconvicted SrA McPherson, pursuant to his pleas, of being absent\n\nwithout leave and distributing drugs.         Articles 86 and 112a,\n\nUCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §§ 886, 912a (2012).        The military judge also\n\nconvicted him, contrary to his pleas, of fraudulent enlistment;\n\nanother specification of being absent without leave; making a\n\nfalse official statement; wrongfully possessing and using drugs;\n\nand incapacitating himself for the performance of duties.\n\nArticles 83, 86, 107, 112a, and 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §§ 883,\n\n886, 907, 912a, 934 (2012).

Background\n\n     After his conviction and sentence, SrA McPherson was\n\ninitially confined for fifteen days at the Elmore County\n\nDetention Facility in Idaho.       Id. at 869.

McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\nas ‘The Mexican,’ who was awaiting deportation hearings.”    Id.\n\nSrA McPherson and “The Mexican” played card games together every\n\nnight while in confinement.   Id.\n\n     SrA McPherson did not seek clemency from the convening\n\nauthority for being confined in immediate association with an\n\nalleged foreign national, nor did he notify anyone at the\n\nconfinement facility or in his chain of command, even after he\n\nwas transferred to the Naval Consolidated Brig Miramar.    Id.     He\n\nfirst raised the issue in his appeal to the CCA.    Id.\n\n     In its decision, the CCA did not specifically address\n\nwhether Article 12, UCMJ, applies to military members confined\n\nin a state or federal facility within the United States.\n\nRather, it evaluated whether relief for an alleged Article 12\n\nviolation is available where a confinee did not exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies.    Id. at 867-70.   The CCA found “no\n\n‘unusual or egregious circumstance’ to excuse [SrA McPherson’s]\n\nfailure to pursue available administrative remedies,” and\n\ndeclined to grant relief.   Id.\n\n     On December 9, 2013, the Government filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration and reconsideration en banc, alleging that, by\n\nemploying an exhaustion of remedies analysis, the CCA had\n\n“implicitly establishe[d] as a matter of law in the Air Force\n\nthat Article 12 applies to civilian confinement facilities.”\n\nThe CCA summarily denied the motion on January 6, 2014.

Both Article 12 and Article 58 address\n\ntreatment of military members in confinement:   Article 58\n\nrequires all confinees to be treated the same, and Article 12\n\nrequires that no military member may be confined in immediate\n\nassociation with a foreign national.   Arguing that Article 58’s\n\n“same treatment” provision is more specific than Article 12, the\n\nGovernment asks us to apply the rule of statutory interpretation\n\nthat, “[w]here Congress includes particular language in one\n\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the same\n\nAct,” Congress “intentionally and purposely” intended “the\n\ndisparate inclusion or exclusion.”   Bates v.

The\n\nGovernment argues this rule means that the specificity of\n\nArticle 58 must apply to Article 12 too.\n\n     But Article 58 is not more specific than Article 12, nor\n\nare the two statutes in conflict.    Military confinees can -- and\n\nmust -- receive treatment equal to civilians confined in the\n\nsame institution, while being confined separately from foreign\n\nnationals.   This Court has no license to generate a statutory\n\nconflict where none exists or to construe statutes in a way that\n\n“undercut[s] the clearly expressed intent of Congress.”    United\n\nStates v. Bartlett, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 428 (C.A.A.F. 2008).     Article\n\n12 and Article 58 were passed at the same time, and read in pari\n\n\n                                 7\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\nmateria, they both apply without conflict to military members\n\nconfined in state or federal institutions in the United States.2\n\n     The Government responds that this holding generates “absurd\n\nresults” for confinement conditions.      See, e.g., Wilson, 73 M.J.\n\nat 534 (noting that the appellant was placed in solitary\n\nconfinement to avoid a violation of Article 12 because the\n\ncounty jail where he was confined “ha[d] no system of\n\nidentifying foreign nationals”).       A confinee subject to solitary\n\nconfinement in these circumstances might then raise a claim of a\n\nviolation of Article 55, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 855 (2012)\n\n(prohibiting cruel or unusual punishment).\n\n     The methods by which civilian facilities may enforce\n\nArticle 12 are matters of policy and are not before this Court.\n\nSince solitary confinement is certainly not the sole method for\n\nimplementing the requirements of the statute, the plain language\n\nof Article 12 does not dictate absurd results.      Any such\n\ndecisions come from fiscal decisions made by the military\n\ndepartments, not from the operation of the statute.\n\n\n\n2\n  We therefore disagree with the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit, which held that “Article\n58 trumps Article 12.” Webber v.

Granted Issue\n\n     In his petition, SrA McPherson argues that the CCA erred in\n\nholding that a confinee must exhaust administrative remedies\n\nbefore receiving any relief for a violation of Article 12, UCMJ.3\n\nWe disagree and affirm the holding of the court below.\n\n     The CCA relied on Wise, 64 M.J. at 471, to hold that\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies is a prerequisite to\n\nrelief under Article 12.   McPherson, 72 M.J. at 869.    In Wise,\n\nthis Court addressed an appellant’s claim of being confined with\n\nenemy prisoners of war in Iraq in violation of both Article 12\n\nand Article 55, UCMJ.   64 M.J. at 470.   The Court observed that\n\na prisoner must exhaust administrative remedies in his detention\n\nfacility before he can “invok[e] judicial intervention to\n\nredress concerns regarding post-trial confinement conditions,”\n\nabsent “some unusual or egregious circumstance.”   Id. at 469,\n\n471 (citing United States v. White, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 (C.A.A.F.\n\n2001); United States v.

The Court’s analysis, though, was in an Article 55\n\ncontext.   Both White and Miller are Article 55 cases; neither\n\nmentions Article 12.    While the Wise Court did mention and\n\nanalyze Article 12 elsewhere in the opinion, we did not clarify\n\n\n3\n  SrA McPherson asserts that there is a split among service\ncourts on this issue. However, he cites no cases from the other\nservices in support of this point and it appears that none of\nthe other service courts has even addressed it.\n\n                                  9\n\fUnited States v.

We now hold\n\nthat a confinee must exhaust administrative remedies before\n\njudicial intervention for an Article 12 violation claim.\n\n     Article 12 regulates confinement conditions in a manner\n\nsimilar to Article 55’s limitations on permissible confinement\n\nconditions.

Consistent\n\nwith Wise, we find that this exhaustion-of-remedies requirement\n\nis applicable under Article 12 as well.\n\n\n                                10\n\fUnited States v.

This administrative\n\nexhaustion requirement furthers two related goals:     (1) the\n\n“resolution of grievances at the lowest possible level” with\n\n“prompt amelioration” of the complaint while the prisoner\n\nsuffers the condition, and (2) the development of an adequate\n\nrecord to aid appellate review.    Wise, 64 M.J. at 471 (citing\n\nMiller, 46 M.J. at 250).\n\n     This case demonstrates why these goals are so important.\n\nSrA McPherson did not raise this issue to local confinement\n\nofficials or to anyone in his chain of command.

SrA McPherson did\n\nnot raise the Article 12 issue in his clemency submissions to\n\nthe convening authority, nor did he file a grievance with the\n\nconfinement facility or make an Article 138, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §\n\n938 (2012), complaint.   Since SrA McPherson did not complain of\n\nthis condition until appeal, there are no details of his\n\nconfinement conditions for an appellate court to review:     we\n\nknow only that he alleges he was confined with a man he calls\n\n“The Mexican” who said he was awaiting deportation proceedings.\n\n“[T]he Air Force was unable to investigate the claims, make a\n\nrecord of it for review, or have the opportunity to immediately\n\n\n                                  11\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\ncorrect the situation, as warranted.”       McPherson, 72 M.J. at\n\n869.\n\n       Wise is still good law.   To obtain relief for an Article 12\n\nviolation, a confinee must exhaust available administrative\n\nremedies absent unusual or egregious circumstances.      In this\n\ncase, SrA McPherson concededly did not exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies.   The CCA did not err in finding no\n\n“unusual or egregious circumstance” to excuse his failure to\n\nexhaust remedies.   Thus, SrA McPherson is not entitled to relief\n\nunder Article 12.\n\n                            V.   Decision\n\n       The judgment of the United States Air Force Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  12\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     BAKER, Chief Judge (concurring in part and dissenting in\n\npart):\n\n     I concur with the majority’s judgment that to obtain relief\n\nfor an Article 12, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10\n\nU.S.C. § 812 (2012), violation, a confinee must exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies absent unusual or egregious\n\ncircumstances.   As the Court in Wise stated, “[a] prisoner must\n\nseek administrative relief prior to invoking judicial\n\nintervention to redress concerns regarding post-trial\n\nconfinement conditions.”   United States v. Wise, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n469 (C.A.A.F. 2007).   Exhaustion serves two purposes.    First, it\n\nis intended to effect “prompt amelioration of a prisoner’s\n\nconditions of confinement.”   Id. at 471.   Second, it allows\n\ndevelopment of an adequate record for appellate review where the\n\nconfinement conditions are not redressed or the prisoner seeks\n\nadditional redress.    See United States v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n250 (C.A.A.F. 1997).\n\n     I disagree, however, with the majority’s conclusion\n\nregarding Article 12, UCMJ.   Read literally, Article 12, UCMJ,\n\nconflicts with Article 58, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 858 (2012).\n\nTherefore, one must look beyond the text of Article 12, UCMJ, to\n\ndetermine congressional intent.   That intent is clear:   on the\n\none hand, to prevent the confinement of servicemembers in\n\nimmediate association with enemy combatants and foreign\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\nnationals in military detention, and, on the other hand, to\n\npermit the transfer of servicemembers to federal prisons in\n\norder to facilitate their rehabilitation and promote discipline\n\nin military confinement facilities.    As a result, the majority’s\n\nliteral application of the statutory text of Article 12, UCMJ,\n\nproduces a result demonstrably at odds with the intent of its\n\ndrafters and with Article 58, UCMJ.\n\n     This case provides an opportunity to invoke almost every\n\ncanon of statutory construction known to Sutherland.    2A N.\n\nSinger & S. Singer, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory\n\nConstruction (7th rev. ed. 2014).     Three principles should\n\ndecide this case.    First, where congressional intent is not\n\nclear, look to legislative history.    Second, read the statutory\n\nscheme as a whole.    Third, do not reach an absurd result.\n\nApplying these principles, I would hold that the plain language\n\nof Article 12, UCMJ, compels an absurd result when read in\n\nconjunction with equally clear language of Article 58, UCMJ.\n\nWhile Article 12, UCMJ, prohibits confinement of a servicemember\n\nin immediate association with a foreign national, Article 58,\n\nUCMJ, requires that a servicemember in civilian confinement\n\nreceive the same treatment as his or her civilian counterpart.\n\nIt also expressly -- by design and with intent -- enables the\n\nmilitary to transfer servicemembers to federal facilities to\n\nserve their prison sentences.    The majority’s interpretation of\n\n\n                                  2\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\nthe law defeats this purpose in light of the number of foreign\n\nnationals in the general U.S. prison population both at the time\n\nof the passage of the UCMJ and today.\n\n     The majority pretends otherwise.   Yet to comply with\n\nArticle 12, UCMJ, servicemembers are assigned to solitary\n\nconfinement in civilian confinement facilities, despite\n\notherwise complying with prison rules and regulations, because\n\nthe armed forces frequently use such facilities.   See, e.g.,\n\nJoshua R. Traeger, The Confinement of Military Members in\n\nCivilian Facilities, 39.1 A.F. Rep. 31, 33 (2012) (“[T]he use of\n\nlocal confinement facilities (vice facilities on base) is\n\nprevalent across the Air Force and, more specifically, Air\n\nCombat Command (ACC).   An informal poll of ACC military justice\n\nsections revealed that about fifty percent of ACC wings utilize\n\ncivilian confinement facilities for at least portions of their\n\nconfinement operations.”).   Given the approximately 350,000\n\nforeign nationals incarcerated in local jails and state and\n\nfederal prisons, the majority, in neglecting to read the\n\nstatutory language in its proper context, now makes it virtually\n\nimpossible for the armed forces to make use of civilian\n\nconfinement facilities, thus “undercut[ting] the clearly\n\nexpressed intent of Congress in enacting” Article 58, UCMJ.\n\nUnited States v.

The D.C. Circuit had no\n\ndifficulty applying the rules of statutory construction,\n\nsummarily declining to review a lower court’s dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint similar to the present action.

There was no suggestion by Congress\n\npreceding the passage of Article 58, UCMJ, that it would be\n\ncircumscribed by Article 12, UCMJ, surely a possibility likely\n\nto have been discussed given the confinement at the time of\n\nseveral thousand foreign nationals in U.S. civilian jails and\n\nprisons.   See Dep’t of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,\n\nNCJ-102529, Historical Corrections Statistics in the United\n\nStates 1850-1984 tbl.3-31 (1986).    The result of the majority’s\n\ninterpretation of Article 12, UCMJ -- namely, that\n\nservicemembers will continue to be placed in solitary\n\nconfinement in certain civilian facilities regardless of their\n\nbehavior -- is not the absurd result the drafters anticipated or\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\fUnited States v.

McPherson, __ M.J. __, __ (8)\n\n(C.A.A.F. 2014).    However, this conclusion is not supported\n\nunless one assumes the armed forces will build more prisons.\n\nNever mind that Article 58, UCMJ, was intended to avoid that\n\nnecessity by permitting transfer of military prisoners to the\n\ncivilian criminal justice system.     Nor does the majority explain\n\nhow the same-treatment language and rehabilitative intent of\n\nArticle 58, UCMJ, can be accomplished through the placement of\n\nmilitary prisoners in solitary confinement as is clearly\n\nrequired in many, if not all, facilities, given the number of\n\nforeign nationals -- 350,000 -- currently confined in U.S.\n\nprisons.

The legislative\n\nhistory demonstrates the overriding purpose of Article 12, UCMJ,\n\nwas to prohibit confinement of a servicemember in the same cell\n\nwith a foreign national, particularly one engaged in military\n\nservice, in times of war.\n\n\n\n1\n  See Traeger, supra p. __ (3), at 33 (describing how the\nadmission of a single migrant worker to Cook County Jail,\nGeorgia, which is “approximately 2000 square feet in size, with\na bay-style general population area, a seventy-square-foot\nsegregation cell, a small gym, administrative offices and\nminimal outdoor space,” requires that servicemembers be “moved\nto the seventy-square-foot segregation cell” and “sometimes . .\n.

McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     The precursor to Article 12, UCMJ, Article of War 16,\n\nstated:\n\n     No person subject to military law shall be confined\n     with enemy prisoners or any other foreign nationals\n     outside of the continental limits of the United States,\n     nor shall any defendant awaiting trial be made subject\n     to punishment or penalties other than confinement prior\n     to sentence on charges against him.\n\nManual for Courts-Martial, U.S. Army app. 1 (1949 ed.) (MCM).\n\n     By the time Congress voted to pass the Uniform Code of\n\nMilitary Justice, in 1950, the text now codified as Article 12,\n\nUCMJ, provided:   “No member of the armed forces of the United\n\nStates shall be placed in confinement in immediate association\n\nwith enemy prisoners or other foreign nationals not members of\n\nthe armed forces of the United States.”   Uniform Code of\n\nMilitary Justice, ch. 169, art. 12, 64 Stat. 107, 112 (1950)\n\n(current version at 10 U.S.C. § 812 (2012)).   The language\n\nchanged only insofar as “confined with” was replaced by “in\n\nimmediate association with” and “outside the continental limits\n\nof the United States” was removed.   The commentary to Article\n\n12, UCMJ, described the first revision as necessary to allow\n\nconfinement of prisoners of war in a brig on an American naval\n\nvessel:\n\n     A[rticle] [of] W[ar] 16 could be interpreted to\n     prohibit the confinement of members of the armed\n     forces in a brig or building which contains prisoners\n     of war. Such construction would prohibit putting\n     naval personnel in the brig of a ship if the brig\n     contained prisoners from an enemy vessel.

McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     Article is intended to permit confinement in the same\n     guardhouse or brig, but would require segregation.\n\nSee Uniform Code of Military Justice:    Hearings on H.R. 2498\n\nBefore a Subcomm. of the H.

The prominence of this\n\nfeature of the legislation was borne out in remarks by\n\nlegislators and staff members during a hearing before a\n\nsubcommittee of the House Committee on Armed Services.    A\n\nprofessional staff member, Robert W. Smart, described that the\n\npurpose of Article 12, UCMJ, was “to be sure that American boys\n\nwere not confined with prisoners of war or other enemy\n\nnationals,” to which the vice chairman of the subcommittee,\n\nRepresentative L. Mendel Rivers, replied, “[l]ike happened [sic]\n\nduring the war.”   Id.   Later Felix E. Larkin, an assistant\n\ngeneral counsel in the Department of Defense, elaborated on the\n\nreason for the change:\n\n          Now we have changed the wording and said --\n     “No member shall be placed in confinement in immediate\n     association --”\n\n     because as it read it conceivably could cause a number\n     of confinement difficulties.\n\n\n\n                                 10\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     . . . The service might have a difficult time overseas\n     if they could not confine a person with enemy prisoners\n     in that they could not even keep them in the same jail.\n\n          There may not be more than one jail or place of\n     confinement within the area. Then they just could not\n     restrain them or confine them at all.\n\n          We thought we kept the sense of the present law\n     but made it a little more flexible by saying “in\n     immediate association” which in effect would mean you\n     could keep them in the same jail by at least\n     segregating them in different cells. It further was\n     proposed for the Army, with no thought of the Navy --\n     the Navy you can visualize might have a great\n     difficulty aboard the ship when they captured an enemy\n     vessel and took foreign nationals.\n\n          Then they could not keep any offender of their own\n     in the same brig on ship board. We have changed that.\n\nId. at 914-15.   The second revision striking the geographical\n\nlimitation was explained only to this extent, and not entirely\n\nlucidly, also by Mr. Larkin:\n\n     We have deleted, if you will notice, “outside the\n     continental limits” and made it apply everyplace\n     [sic], but prohibit incarceration in close association\n     but not with [sic] because “with” has the connotation\n     that you could not keep them in the same prison and\n     there may be only one. They are the only differences\n     between what is in the law now and this article.\n\nId. at 915.\n\n     No one offered further justification for the modification.\n\nNo one posited or discussed the article’s application to\n\nconfinement of servicemembers in civilian facilities in the\n\nUnited States.\n\n\n\n\n                                11\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     So too the legislative history of Article 58, UCMJ, which\n\nwas passed in conjunction with Article 12, UCMJ, suggests\n\nCongress neither intended nor desired for servicemembers in\n\ncivilian confinement to be separated from foreign-born residents\n\nof the United States, such as migrant workers, who are not\n\nenemies of or hostile to the government.   Article 58(a), UCMJ,\n\nprovides:\n\n     [A] sentence of confinement . . . may be carried into\n     execution by confinement in any place of confinement\n     under the control of any of the armed forces or in any\n     penal or correctional institution under the control of\n     any of the armed forces or in any penal or correctional\n     institution under the control of the United States . .\n     . . Persons so confined in a penal or correctional\n     institution not under the control of one of the armed\n     forces are subject to the same discipline and treatment\n     as persons confined or committed by the courts of the\n     United States or of the State, District of Columbia, or\n     place in which the institution is situated.\n\n     Article 58, UCMJ, derives from Article of War 42 and\n\nArticle for the Government of the Navy (A.G.N.) 7.   Article 58,\n\nUCMJ, is broader than those articles in that it provides\n\nauthority for all branches of the armed forces to transfer a\n\nservicemember to civilian confinement for any offense.   The\n\ncommentary described the reason for the modification:\n\n     Subdivision (a) is derived from A.G.N. article 7 which\n     permits the Navy to transfer court-martial prisoners\n     to institutions under the control of the Department of\n     Justice. The Navy has found this practice to be\n     beneficial both to the service and to the prisoner.\n     Both the Army and Navy officers in charge of\n     correctional policies recommend the adoption of\n     subdivision (a). It is the policy of the armed forces\n\n\n                               12\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     to segregate youthful and rehabilitable prisoners from\n     the hardened criminals and incorrigibles and to\n     provide for the maximum rehabilitation of prisoners\n     for the purpose of restoration to duty or successful\n     adjustment in civil life. However, due to lack of\n     facilities and personnel with long and continuous\n     experience in the highly technical and specialized\n     phases of penology, the armed forces have serious\n     handicaps in dealing with prisoners with long civilian\n     criminal records, criminal psychopaths, sex deviates,\n     violent incorrigibles and other prisoners requiring\n     special treatment. The Army in operating under A.W.\n     42 has met with great difficulty in segregating the\n     varied types of prisoners and in giving them\n     specialized treatment. It is felt that the\n     rehabilitation of prisoners who create special\n     problems could be expedited by transferring them to\n     the highly specialized institutions under control of\n     the Department of Justice, which range from training\n     schools and reformatories to major penitentiaries and\n     provide for the treatment of prisoners according to\n     their needs.\n\n          From past experience, the services have found\n     that the type of treatment suited for individuals does\n     not depend on the type of offense or on the length of\n     the sentence. Many of the prisoners who cause special\n     problems in disciplinary barracks are those convicted\n     of military offenses, such as a.w.o.l. or desertion.\n\nLegislative History, supra pp. __ (9-10), at 1093-94.     The\n\nlegislative history also contains testimony by military\n\nofficials stating that a primary goal of Article 58, UCMJ, was\n\nto facilitate the reentry of recalcitrant servicemembers into\n\nthe armed forces by providing them access to the rehabilitative\n\nservices of the civilian prison system.    According to the\n\nstatement of Colonel Lloyd R. Garrison, Chief of the Correction\n\nBranch of the Adjutant General’s Office:\n\n\n\n\n                               13\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     We feel that rehabilitation in prisons, to get people\n     back in civil life, able [sic] to make their own\n     living, is extremely important.\n\n          The populations of Army disciplinary barracks\n     include prisoners of all types, ranging from youthful,\n     impressionable first offenders to men with long\n     civilian criminal records, criminal psychopaths, sex\n     deviates, and violent incorrigibles. Adequate\n     segregation for purposes of protecting young,\n     impressionable offenders from detrimental influences\n     and unwholesome contacts with the criminal types\n     mentioned, and the operation of suitable\n     rehabilitation programs to fit the varying needs of\n     the individuals concerned cannot be accomplished in an\n     institution in which all types are confined together.\n     It is, therefore, considered desirable to provide for\n     the confinement of different types of general\n     prisoners in separate institutions having adequate\n     facilities, trained personnel, and rehabilitation\n     programs designed to meet the needs of the particular\n     groups.\n\n          The Department of the Army does not have the\n     number and diversified types of confinement facilities\n     under its jurisdiction to provide for completely\n     adequate segregation, control, and rehabilitative\n     treatment of general prisoners by type. Further,\n     military personnel assigned to duty at Army\n     disciplinary barracks are subject to frequent\n     rotation, and do not have the opportunity to gain the\n     maturity of experience and training in the highly\n     specialized professional and technical work involved\n     in the administration of major correctional\n     institutions, and in the control and treatment of the\n     types of offenders involved. It would not be\n     economical or in keeping with the primary mission for\n     the Department of the Army to operate the number and\n     types of institutions and provide the trained\n     personnel required to meet these needs.\n\n          . . . .\n\n          In addition, it is considered desirable that the\n     Department of the Army have access to the specialized\n     facilities of the Federal Prison System for the\n     rehabilitative treatment of individual offenders where\n\n\n                               14\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\n     transfer to such Federal institutions would result in\n     benefit to the prisoner, such as transfer of medical\n     and mental patients to the Medical Center for Federal\n     prisoners, and transfer of some youthful offenders to\n     the National Training School and Federal\n     reformatories.\n\nId. at 1095.\n\n     Similarly, Captain Maginnis, the counterpart to Colonel\n\nGarrison in the Department of the Navy, testified:\n\n          All that [Colonel Garrison] said about the\n     facilities in Federal institutions for the treatment\n     of these individuals who have committed felonies and\n     who remain for long terms is true.\n\n          In the naval service our personnel manning these\n     institutions are men who enlisted in either the Navy\n     or the Marine Corps as a career and to whom custodial\n     work is not a chosen vocation. They do the best that\n     they can, but we feel that the treatment the\n     individual would obtain under Federal jurisdiction is\n     much better when they are guided by those people who\n     have that as their vocation and their life work.\n\nId. at 1106.   None of the debate surrounding Article 58, UCMJ,\n\ncontemplated that the “same discipline and treatment”\n\nrequirement would or should be curtailed by Article 12, UCMJ.\n\nIt does, however, make overwhelmingly clear that Congress sought\n\nto provide to the armed forces an avenue for confining\n\nservicemembers in civilian facilities and that that option was\n\nnot to be limited.   In ignoring this legislative history and the\n\nmodern context, the majority defeats the purpose of Article 58,\n\nUCMJ, by preventing the armed forces from making use of civilian\n\n\n\n\n                                15\n\fUnited States v. McPherson, Nos. 14-0348/AF & 14-5002/AF\n\n\nconfinement facilities as the drafters so clearly intended.   For\n\nthese reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\f</pre>",
