Box 90\n       Leonardo, NJ 07737\n       Counsel for Appellee\n\nOPINION OF THE COURT\n\nROSENN, Circuit Judge.\n\nThis appeal presents this Court with an important\nquestion of first impression pertaining to federal subject-\nmatter jurisdiction over a complaint by an insured\npredicated on the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968\n(\"NFIA\") but actually sounding in tort. The plaintiffs'\ncomplaint alleges that Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance\nCompany (\"Liberty Mutual\"), a private insurer, violated New\nJersey state law during its investigation and adjustment of\na claim under a policy issued by it pursuant to the NFIA.\nThe plaintiffs do not allege diversity of citizenship but\nassert exclusive federal jurisdiction under the NFIA.\nAlthough the parties and the United States District Court\nfor the District of New Jersey did not address this issue, we\nhave an independent duty to determine whether the district\ncourt had subject-matter jurisdiction. We vacate the district\ncourt's judgment in favor of Liberty Mutual and remand the\ncase with instructions to dismiss the complaint.*\n\nI.\n\nThe plaintiffs, Re and Jo Van Holt, own a home in Sea\nBright, New Jersey. The town of Sea Bright is located on a\nnarrow strip of land bounded by the Shrewsbury River on\none side and the Atlantic Ocean on the other. The Van\nHolts' home is located in an area that floods frequently. In\nOctober 1991, Sea Bright was flooded, resulting in damage\nto the Van Holts' home and personal property. In\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n* Although Judge Lewis heard argument in this case, he has been\nunable, however, to clear this written opinion because of illness.\n\n                               2\n\fconnection with this flood, the Van Holts filed two claims\nwith their insurer, the defendant, Liberty Mutual. Liberty\nMutual paid the claims by check in the Summer of 1992.\nThe Van Holts received and cashed Liberty Mutual's checks\nwithout objection. On December 11, 1992, the Van Holts'\nhome and personal property were again damaged by\nflooding which resulted from high winds and rain. The\npresent dispute between the Van Holts and Liberty Mutual\nprimarily centers on the damage caused by the December\n11 flood.\n\nThe Van Holts held two insurance policies issued by\nLiberty Mutual, the first was a homeowner's policy, the\nother was a flood insurance policy issued pursuant to the\nNational Flood Insurance Program (\"NFIP\"). See 42 U.S.C.\nSS 4001-129 (codification of the NFIA). The Van Holts made\nclaims on both policies for the damages resulting from the\nDecember 11 flood.1 They hired their own claims adjuster,\nRobert C. Ascher. Following an inspection of the Van Holts'\nhome and property, Ascher submitted a list of damaged\nproperty to Kevin Grelle, Liberty Mutual's claims adjuster.\nOn behalf of Liberty Mutual, Grelle refused to pay the\nclaimed damages because the list was incomplete.\nAccording to a letter from Grelle to Ascher dated June 7,\n1993, Grelle rejected Ascher's list because it did not set\nforth the values of the items claimed and the Van Holts had\nnot signed each page as required by the insurance policies.\n\nWhen six months passed without payment of their\nclaims, in June of 1993, the Van Holts, through Ascher,\nfiled a complaint against Liberty Mutual with the New\nJersey Department of Insurance. The department forwarded\nthe complaint to Liberty Mutual and requested that the\ncompany provide the reasons why the claim was taking so\nlong to evaluate. In response, Grelle stated that he believed\nthat the Van Holts had attempted to defraud Liberty\nMutual by inflating the extent of their damages and\nclaiming damage to property that had been destroyed or\ndamaged, not in the December 11 flood, but in the earlier\nOctober 1991 flood. In his investigation report, Grelle\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Because the claims made under the homeowner's policy do not affect\nthe result in this case, we do not discuss them.\n\n                                3\n\fstated that, among other things, the Van Holts made claims\nfor damage to property stored in the basement of their\nhome which was caused by the October 1991 flood. Liberty\nMutual had denied coverage for this damage when it\npartially paid the October 1991 claim because theflood\ninsurance policy excluded coverage for damage to property\nstored in the insured's basement. After additional\ninvestigation, including an under-oath examination of the\nVan Holts by Liberty Mutual's attorneys, on June 16, 1995,\nLiberty Mutual formally denied the Van Holts' claims on the\nground that they were fraudulent.\n\nOn December 15, 1995, the Van Holts sued Liberty\nMutual in the United States District Court for the District\nof New Jersey. In their complaint, the Van Holts alleged\nthat Liberty Mutual committed two state-law torts and\nasserted that subject-matter jurisdiction was proper\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 4053, a provision of the NFIA.2\nThey cited no other statutory provision. Specifically, the\nplaintiffs averred that Liberty Mutual's failure to pay their\nclaims and the company's allegation that the claims were\nfraudulent violated the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act,\nN.J.S.A. SS 56:8-1 to 56:8-48, and New Jersey common law\nrequiring parties to an insurance contract to act in good\nfaith. See Pickett v. Lloyd's, 621 A.2d 445, 451-52 (N.J.\n1993); see also Sons of Thunder, Inc. v. Borden, Inc., 690\nA.2d 575, 587 (N.J. 1997) (discussing duty of good faith in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. 42 U.S.C. S 4053 provides:\n\n       The insurance companies and other insurers which form, associate,\n       or otherwise join together in the pool under this part may adjust\n       and pay all claims for proved and approved losses covered by flood\n       insurance in accordance with provisions of this chapter and, upon\n       disallowance by any such company or other insurer of any such\n       claim, or upon the refusal of the claimant to accept the amount\n       allowed upon any such claim, the claimant, within one year after\n       the date of mailing of notice of disallowance or partial\ndisallowance\n       of the claim, may institute an action on such claim against such\n       company or other insurer in the United States district court for\nthe\n       district in which the insured property or major part thereof shall\n       have been situated, and original exclusive jurisdiction is hereby\n       conferred upon such court to hear and determine such action\n       without regard to the amount in controversy.\n\n                                4\n\fother contractual contexts). Following discovery, the district\ncourt entered summary judgment for Liberty Mutual. The\nVan Holts filed a timely notice of appeal. We vacate the\ndistrict court's December 2, 1996 judgment and remand\nthis case with instructions to dismiss for lack of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction.\n\nII.\n\nIt is undisputed that Liberty Mutual issued theflood\ninsurance policy to the Van Holts pursuant to the NFIP.\nThe NFIP is a federally supervised and guaranteed\ninsurance program presently administered by the Federal\nEmergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\") pursuant to the\nNFIA and its corresponding regulations. See 44 C.F.R.\nSS 59.1-77.2. Congress created the program to, among\nother things, limit the damage caused by flood disasters\nthrough prevention and protective measures, spread the\nrisk of flood damage among many private insurers and the\nfederal government, and make flood insurance \"available on\nreasonable terms and conditions\" to those in need of it. See\n42 U.S.C. S 4001(a)(1)-(4).\n\nInitially, under what is referred to as Part A of the NFIA,\na pool of private insurance companies issued flood\ninsurance policies and administered the NFIP pursuant to\na contract with the United States Department of Housing\nand Urban Development. See 42 U.S.C. SS 4051-53; see\ngenerally Spence v. Omaha Indem. Ins. Co., 996 F.2d 793,\n794 n.1 (5th Cir. 1993) (discussing the initial workings and\norganization of the program under the Act); Berger v. Pierce,\n933 F.2d 393, 394-96 (6th Cir. 1991) (same). Under Part A,\nif a pool company refused to pay a claim under aflood\ninsurance policy, the insured was permitted to sue the pool\ninsurance company \"on ... [the] claim\" in federal district\ncourt regardless of the amount in controversy. See 42\nU.S.C. S 4053.\n\nOn January 1, 1978, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 4071, HUD\nended its contractual relationship with the association and\nassumed greater responsibility for operating the NFIP,\nalthough still maintaining the assistance of the private\ninsurance industry. See generally In re Estate of Lee, 812\n\n                               5\n\fF.2d 253, 256 (5th Cir. 1987) (discussing HUD takeover of\nNFIP); National Flood Insurers Ass'n v. Harris, 444 F. Supp.\n969 (D.C. 1977) (same). This arrangement, which is\npresently in force, is called Part B. FEMA began\nadministering the NFIP through the Flood Insurance\nAdministration.\n\nIn 1983, pursuant to regulatory authority granted by\nCongress in 42 U.S.C. S 4081(a), FEMA created the \"Write\nYour Own\" program. See 44 C.F.R. 62.23-24. Under this\nprogram, private insurance companies like Liberty Mutual\nwrite their own insurance policies, issue them to those in\nneed of flood insurance, hold premiums from those policies\nin accounts separate from their other business, and pay\nnecessary claims and refunds out of the segregated\naccounts. See 44 C.F.R. S 62.23(a); 44 C.F.R. Pt. 62, App.\nA, Arts. II(E), (D); see also Spence, 996 F.2d at 794 n.1.\nFEMA guarantees payment of claims through letters of\ncredit issued on behalf of the private insurance companies\nwhich may be tapped in the event that the claims against\npolicies exceed a company's net premium income. See 44\nC.F.R. Pt. 62, App. A, Art. IV. FEMA also provides\nreinsurance. The private insurance companies must use\nthe Standard Flood Insurance Policy (\"SFIP\"), which is\ncontained in the regulations. See 44 C.F.R. Pt. 61, App.\nA(1). Under Part B, an insured may sue FEMA if it adjusts\na claim and improperly refuses to pay benefits. See 42\nU.S.C. S 4072.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Section 4072 provides:\n\n        In the event the program is carried out as provided in section 4071\n        of this title, the Director shall be authorized to adjust and make\n        payment of any claims for proved and approved losses covered by\n        flood insurance, and upon the disallowance by the Director of any\n        such claim, or upon the refusal of the claimant to accept the\n        amount allowed upon any such claim, the claimant, within one year\n        after the date of mailing of notice of disallowance or partial\n        disallowance by the Director, may institute an action against the\n        Director on such claim in the United States district court for the\n        district in which the insured property or the major part thereof\nshall\n        have been situated, and original exclusive jurisdiction is hereby\n        conferred upon such court to hear and determine such action\n        without regard to the amount in controversy.\n\n                                6\n\fThe parties have not raised any question whether the\ndistrict court had subject-matter jurisdiction of the Van\nHolts' complaint and the district court did not consider the\nmatter. It is central to our federal system that, unlike the\nstate courts, the federal courts are courts of limited\njurisdiction. \"[T]hey have only the power that is authorized\nby Article III of the Constitution and the statutes enacted\nby Congress pursuant thereto.\" Bender v. Williamsport Area\nSch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986) (citation omitted).\nAccordingly, a federal court of appeals has a special\nobligation to satisfy itself of the district court's basis for\nsubject-matter jurisdiction even if the parties are prepared\nto concede it. Id.; Pennsylvania Nurses Ass'n v.\nPennsylvania State Educ. Ass'n, 90 F.3d 797, 800 (3d Cir.\n1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 947 (1997); Lyon v. Whisam,\n45 F.3d 758, 759 (3d Cir. 1995). Generally, the federal\ncourts have subject-matter jurisdiction of a complaint when\nit asserts a cause of action arising under some provision of\nfederal law, see 28 U.S.C. S 1331, such as when Congress\ncreates a cause of action within the bounds of Article III of\nthe United States Constitution, or when the parties are of\ndiverse citizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds\nthe jurisdictional minimum, which at the time this case\nwas filed was $50,000. See 28 U.S.C. S 1332 (1995).\n\nIn accordance with our duty to raise subject-matter\njurisdiction, on March 28, 1998, we requested counsel for\nthe parties to submit supplement briefs on the issue of\njurisdiction. In their supplemental brief, the Van Holts\nargued that subject-matter jurisdiction was proper in the\nfederal court because they sought damages \"under\" the\nflood insurance policy and that, in 42 U.S.C. S 4053,\nCongress granted to the federal courts \"exclusive\njurisdiction ... over disputes involving flood insurance\npolicies.\" Liberty Mutual also believes that the district court\nhad subject-matter jurisdiction because the gravamen of\nthe claims related to \"the processing and denial of the flood\nclaim.\" It conceded, however, that \"the complaint is\nproblematic as the only counts of the complaint read as\nconsumer fraud and bad faith claims\" and acknowledged\nthat the Van Holts' complaint does not contain a claim for\n\"benefits under the flood policy.\"\n\n                               7\n\fIn their complaint, the plaintiffs assert that federal\nsubject-matter jurisdiction is proper pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\nS 4053 and a provision in the Standard Flood Insurance\nPolicy governing the relationship between Liberty Mutual\nand the Van Holts, which provides:\n\n       You may not sue us to recover money under this policy\n       unless you have complied with all of the requirements\n       of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit\n       within 12 months from the date we mailed you notice\n       that we have denied your claim, or part of your claim,\n       and you must file the suit in the United States District\n       Court of the district in which the insured property was\n       located at the time of the loss.\n\n44 C.F.R. Pt. 61, App. A(1), Art. 9(R) (italics in original).\n\nWe first consider the statutory basis for jurisdiction. It is\naxiomatic that when a court interprets a statute, its sole\ntask is to ascertain the statute's meaning and enforce it\naccording to its terms. United States v. Ron Pair Enter., Inc.,\n489 U.S. 235, 241 (1989) (quoting Caminetti v. United\nStates, 242 U.S. 470, 485 (1917)). When considering such\na question, the inquiry must begin with the plain language\nof the statute itself. Id. at 241; United States v. Schneider,\n14 F.3d 876, 879 (3d Cir. 1994). That is because the best\nevidence of congressional intent is the text of the statute.\nSee West Virginia Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83,\n98 (1990); Schneider, 14 F.3d at 879. The court, however,\nmust look not only to the particular statutory language, but\nto the design of the statute as a whole and its objectives\nand policies. See Crandon v. United States, 494 U.S. 152,\n158 (1990); Schneider, 14 F.3d at 879.\n\nIt is apparent from the plain language of S 4053, that it\nprovides subject-matter jurisdiction only for a coverage, or\nbreach of contract, cause of action based on a denial of an\ninsurance claim and not for state-law torts which arise out\nof the claims investigation and adjustment procedure\nexecuted by the insurance company. Section 4053 provides\nthat an insured may institute a lawsuit on a \"claim\" on the\npolicy when the claim has been \"disallow[ed].\" We interpret\nthis language to refer only to suits challenging the failure to\npay the insurance \"claim.\" The language makes no explicit\n\n                               8\n\for implicit reference to other causes of action that may\narise during a claims investigation. Indeed, if claims like\nthe Van Holts' were allowed in federal court it would not be\nnecessary for the insurance company to first deny coverage.\nConceivably, the insurance company could commit state-\nlaw torts even when it pays the claim, by delaying payment\nor engaging in other misconduct in the adjustment process.\nCongress could have chosen to use broader language, such\nas \"relating to the insurance policy\" or \"relating to the\nclaim's investigation or adjustment.\" It chose not to do so.\nThus, we must respect Congress' choice and cannot add\nlanguage to the statute where none exists.\n\nIn their complaint, the Van Holts do not assert a cause\nof action \"on ... [their] claim\" under the Liberty Mutual\nflood insurance policy. As the defendant acknowledges, the\nVan Holts do not assert that Liberty Mutual's failure to pay\nthe claim was a breach of the flood insurance policy or\nrequest that the district court order that Liberty Mutual\ncover their losses. Instead, the plaintiffs, citing New Jersey\nstate law, claim that Liberty Mutual committed two torts in\nthe course of the investigation and adjustment of their\ninsurance claims and request damages to compensate them\nfor their losses suffered as a result of these torts and to\npunish Liberty Mutual for committing the torts.4\n\nNeither the plain language nor the object and policies of\nthe NFIA and its regulations tend to show that Congress\nintended to provide for subject-matter jurisdiction for state-\nlaw torts arising out of flood insurance polices. See Spence,\n996 F.2d at 796. Indeed, the legislative history of S 4053\nspecifically states that, even though claimants may sue for\ncoverage in federal court, they maintain the right to pursue\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Liberty Mutual contends that there is federal subject-matter\njurisdiction for a claim under state bad-faith law because such a claim\nis a contract claim. See Pickett, 621 A.2d at 452 (refusing to\ncharacterize\nbad faith claim as having basis in tort or contract law). This argument\nis unpersuasive because federal law, namely the language of S 4053,\ndetermines what claims are permitted in federal court and there is no\nevidence that Congress intended to incorporate state bad-faith law into\nS 4053. Cf. Spence, 996 F.2d at 796 (in statute of limitations issues,\nfederal interests in regulation of flood insurance do not require that\nstate\nlaw be disregarded when insured asserts state-law torts against insurer).\n\n                               9\n\fother \"legal remedies in State courts.\" H.R. Rep. No. 1585,\nreprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2873, 3022; see also\nPossessky v. National Flood Insurers Ass'n, 507 F. Supp.\n913, 915 (D. N.J. 1981) (quoting House of Representatives\nreport). Also, the present regulations provide for substantial\nindependence of the private Write-Your-Own companies in\nthe adjustment and investigation of claims, see 44 C.F.R.\nS 62.23(e), do not permit the companies to draw down on\nthe letters of credit for claims of fraud, and that the\ninsurance companies are not agents of the federal\ngovernment. Spence, 996 F.2d at 796 & ns.15-17.5\n\nAllowing jurisdiction over claims such as the Van Holts'\nwould have far reaching implications for the federal courts\nand insurance law, implications not intended by Congress.\nIf we found subject-matter jurisdiction, we would have to\nconclude either that Congress intended federal courts to\nenforce state-law imposed duties in all flood insurance\ncases or that Congress intended to create a federal common\nlaw regulating insurance company practices when there is\nno indication that state courts and state legislatures are\nincapable of carrying out this function. There is no evidence\neither in the NFIA or the legislative history that Congress\nintended such a result.\n\nAlthough it addressed a slightly different issue, we find\nthe reasoning in Spence instructive. In Spence, the\nplaintiffs brought suit in federal district court alleging that\nthe defendant, an insurance company, breached the flood\ninsurance policy issued to them when it refused to cover\ntheir losses and committed torts under Texas state law\nduring the claims adjustment and investigation procedure.\nThe defendant argued that all the claims, including the\nstate-law claims, were barred by the one-year suit\nlimitations period contained in the SFIP. See 44 C.F.R. Pt.\n61, App. A(1), Art. VIII(Q). The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the defendant's\nargument, holding that Texas state law, and not the NFIA,\nprovided the limitations period for the state law torts. The\nSpence court held that the independence granted insurance\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Section 4072 does not permit jurisdiction because it allows suit only\nagainst FEMA which is not a party to this action.\n\n                               10\n\fcompanies in claims adjustment, the fact that the\ncompanies are not government agents, and that companies\nmay not draw down on letters of credit for fraud claims\nevidenced that Congress did not intend to federalize state-\nlaw claims in the flood-insurance context. That same\nreasoning applies here. There is simply no indication that\nCongress intended to create jurisdiction for any claims\nother than coverage claims.\n\nAs with S 4053, the provision in the insurance policy\nissued to the Van Holts--the identical one construed by the\nSpence court--provides only for a coverage claim. The\nclause narrowly provides that suit must be in federal court\nif the suit seeks to recover money \"under this policy\" and\nmakes no mention of other causes of action or implies that\nthey would be covered. (Emphasis added). Regardless, even\nif the provision allowed for a right to sue in federal court for\ncauses of actions other than coverage claims, it is\ninsufficient, on its own, to confer federal subject-matter\njurisdiction over a complaint. It is well settled that parties\ncannot confer subject-matter jurisdiction either by\nagreement or by waiver. See, e.g., Brown v. Francis, 75 F.3d\n860, 866 (3d Cir. 1996); United Indus. Workers v.\nGovernment of Virgin Islands, 987 F.2d 162, 168 (3d Cir.\n1993) (collecting cases).\n\nFinally, diversity of citizenship does not provide a basis of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction here. The plaintiffs do not allege\nthat the parties are diverse and we have searched the\ncomplaint in vain for any allegation of the parties'\ncitizenship or a reference to the diversity statute. The Van\nHolts contend only that subject-matter jurisdiction is\npremised on S 4053. It is the plaintiffs' burden to allege a\nbasis for subject-matter jurisdiction. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n8(a)(1). They have failed to do so. Hence, the complaint\nmust be dismissed.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court's December\n2, 1996 judgment is vacated. This case will be remanded to\nthe district court with instructions to dismiss for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.

The plaintiffs'\ncomplaint alleges that Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance\nCompany (\"Liberty Mutual\"), a private insurer, violated New\nJersey state law during its investigation and adjustment of\na claim under a policy issued by it pursuant to the NFIA.\nThe plaintiffs do not allege diversity of citizenship but\nassert exclusive federal jurisdiction under the NFIA.\nAlthough the parties and the United States District Court\nfor the District of New Jersey did not address this issue, we\nhave an independent duty to determine whether the district\ncourt had subject-matter jurisdiction. We vacate the district\ncourt's judgment in favor of Liberty Mutual and remand the\ncase with instructions to dismiss the complaint.*\n\nI.\n\nThe plaintiffs, Re and Jo Van Holt, own a home in Sea\nBright, New Jersey. The town of Sea Bright is located on a\nnarrow strip of land bounded by the Shrewsbury River on\none side and the Atlantic Ocean on the other. The Van\nHolts' home is located in an area that floods frequently. In\nOctober 1991, Sea Bright was flooded, resulting in damage\nto the Van Holts' home and personal property. In\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n* Although Judge Lewis heard argument in this case, he has been\nunable, however, to clear this written opinion because of illness.\n\n                               2\n\fconnection with this flood, the Van Holts filed two claims\nwith their insurer, the defendant, Liberty Mutual. Liberty\nMutual paid the claims by check in the Summer of 1992.\nThe Van Holts received and cashed Liberty Mutual's checks\nwithout objection. On December 11, 1992, the Van Holts'\nhome and personal property were again damaged by\nflooding which resulted from high winds and rain. The\npresent dispute between the Van Holts and Liberty Mutual\nprimarily centers on the damage caused by the December\n11 flood.\n\nThe Van Holts held two insurance policies issued by\nLiberty Mutual, the first was a homeowner's policy, the\nother was a flood insurance policy issued pursuant to the\nNational Flood Insurance Program (\"NFIP\"). See 42 U.S.C.\nSS 4001-129 (codification of the NFIA). The Van Holts made\nclaims on both policies for the damages resulting from the\nDecember 11 flood.1 They hired their own claims adjuster,\nRobert C. Ascher. Following an inspection of the Van Holts'\nhome and property, Ascher submitted a list of damaged\nproperty to Kevin Grelle, Liberty Mutual's claims adjuster.\nOn behalf of Liberty Mutual, Grelle refused to pay the\nclaimed damages because the list was incomplete.\nAccording to a letter from Grelle to Ascher dated June 7,\n1993, Grelle rejected Ascher's list because it did not set\nforth the values of the items claimed and the Van Holts had\nnot signed each page as required by the insurance policies.\n\nWhen six months passed without payment of their\nclaims, in June of 1993, the Van Holts, through Ascher,\nfiled a complaint against Liberty Mutual with the New\nJersey Department of Insurance. The department forwarded\nthe complaint to Liberty Mutual and requested that the\ncompany provide the reasons why the claim was taking so\nlong to evaluate. In response, Grelle stated that he believed\nthat the Van Holts had attempted to defraud Liberty\nMutual by inflating the extent of their damages and\nclaiming damage to property that had been destroyed or\ndamaged, not in the December 11 flood, but in the earlier\nOctober 1991 flood. In his investigation report, Grelle\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Because the claims made under the homeowner's policy do not affect\nthe result in this case, we do not discuss them.\n\n                                3\n\fstated that, among other things, the Van Holts made claims\nfor damage to property stored in the basement of their\nhome which was caused by the October 1991 flood. Liberty\nMutual had denied coverage for this damage when it\npartially paid the October 1991 claim because theflood\ninsurance policy excluded coverage for damage to property\nstored in the insured's basement. After additional\ninvestigation, including an under-oath examination of the\nVan Holts by Liberty Mutual's attorneys, on June 16, 1995,\nLiberty Mutual formally denied the Van Holts' claims on the\nground that they were fraudulent.\n\nOn December 15, 1995, the Van Holts sued Liberty\nMutual in the United States District Court for the District\nof New Jersey. In their complaint, the Van Holts alleged\nthat Liberty Mutual committed two state-law torts and\nasserted that subject-matter jurisdiction was proper\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 4053, a provision of the NFIA.2\nThey cited no other statutory provision. Specifically, the\nplaintiffs averred that Liberty Mutual's failure to pay their\nclaims and the company's allegation that the claims were\nfraudulent violated the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act,\nN.J.S.A. SS 56:8-1 to 56:8-48, and New Jersey common law\nrequiring parties to an insurance contract to act in good\nfaith. See Pickett v.

See 44 C.F.R.\nSS 59.1-77.2. Congress created the program to, among\nother things, limit the damage caused by flood disasters\nthrough prevention and protective measures, spread the\nrisk of flood damage among many private insurers and the\nfederal government, and make flood insurance \"available on\nreasonable terms and conditions\" to those in need of it. See\n42 U.S.C. S 4001(a)(1)-(4).\n\nInitially, under what is referred to as Part A of the NFIA,\na pool of private insurance companies issued flood\ninsurance policies and administered the NFIP pursuant to\na contract with the United States Department of Housing\nand Urban Development.

FEMA began\nadministering the NFIP through the Flood Insurance\nAdministration.\n\nIn 1983, pursuant to regulatory authority granted by\nCongress in 42 U.S.C. S 4081(a), FEMA created the \"Write\nYour Own\" program. See 44 C.F.R. 62.23-24. Under this\nprogram, private insurance companies like Liberty Mutual\nwrite their own insurance policies, issue them to those in\nneed of flood insurance, hold premiums from those policies\nin accounts separate from their other business, and pay\nnecessary claims and refunds out of the segregated\naccounts. See 44 C.F.R. S 62.23(a); 44 C.F.R. Pt. 62, App.\nA, Arts. II(E), (D); see also Spence, 996 F.2d at 794 n.1.\nFEMA guarantees payment of claims through letters of\ncredit issued on behalf of the private insurance companies\nwhich may be tapped in the event that the claims against\npolicies exceed a company's net premium income. See 44\nC.F.R. Pt. 62, App. A, Art. IV. FEMA also provides\nreinsurance. The private insurance companies must use\nthe Standard Flood Insurance Policy (\"SFIP\"), which is\ncontained in the regulations. See 44 C.F.R. Pt. 61, App.\nA(1). Under Part B, an insured may sue FEMA if it adjusts\na claim and improperly refuses to pay benefits. See 42\nU.S.C. S 4072.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Section 4072 provides:\n\n        In the event the program is carried out as provided in section 4071\n        of this title, the Director shall be authorized to adjust and make\n        payment of any claims for proved and approved losses covered by\n        flood insurance, and upon the disallowance by the Director of any\n        such claim, or upon the refusal of the claimant to accept the\n        amount allowed upon any such claim, the claimant, within one year\n        after the date of mailing of notice of disallowance or partial\n        disallowance by the Director, may institute an action against the\n        Director on such claim in the United States district court for the\n        district in which the insured property or the major part thereof\nshall\n        have been situated, and original exclusive jurisdiction is hereby\n        conferred upon such court to hear and determine such action\n        without regard to the amount in controversy.\n\n                                6\n\fThe parties have not raised any question whether the\ndistrict court had subject-matter jurisdiction of the Van\nHolts' complaint and the district court did not consider the\nmatter. It is central to our federal system that, unlike the\nstate courts, the federal courts are courts of limited\njurisdiction. \"[T]hey have only the power that is authorized\nby Article III of the Constitution and the statutes enacted\nby Congress pursuant thereto.\" Bender v.

Generally, the federal\ncourts have subject-matter jurisdiction of a complaint when\nit asserts a cause of action arising under some provision of\nfederal law, see 28 U.S.C. S 1331, such as when Congress\ncreates a cause of action within the bounds of Article III of\nthe United States Constitution, or when the parties are of\ndiverse citizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds\nthe jurisdictional minimum, which at the time this case\nwas filed was $50,000. See 28 U.S.C. S 1332 (1995).\n\nIn accordance with our duty to raise subject-matter\njurisdiction, on March 28, 1998, we requested counsel for\nthe parties to submit supplement briefs on the issue of\njurisdiction. In their supplemental brief, the Van Holts\nargued that subject-matter jurisdiction was proper in the\nfederal court because they sought damages \"under\" the\nflood insurance policy and that, in 42 U.S.C. S 4053,\nCongress granted to the federal courts \"exclusive\njurisdiction ... over disputes involving flood insurance\npolicies.\" Liberty Mutual also believes that the district court\nhad subject-matter jurisdiction because the gravamen of\nthe claims related to \"the processing and denial of the flood\nclaim.\" It conceded, however, that \"the complaint is\nproblematic as the only counts of the complaint read as\nconsumer fraud and bad faith claims\" and acknowledged\nthat the Van Holts' complaint does not contain a claim for\n\"benefits under the flood policy.\"\n\n                               7\n\fIn their complaint, the plaintiffs assert that federal\nsubject-matter jurisdiction is proper pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\nS 4053 and a provision in the Standard Flood Insurance\nPolicy governing the relationship between Liberty Mutual\nand the Van Holts, which provides:\n\n       You may not sue us to recover money under this policy\n       unless you have complied with all of the requirements\n       of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit\n       within 12 months from the date we mailed you notice\n       that we have denied your claim, or part of your claim,\n       and you must file the suit in the United States District\n       Court of the district in which the insured property was\n       located at the time of the loss.\n\n44 C.F.R. Pt. 61, App. A(1), Art. 9(R) (italics in original).\n\nWe first consider the statutory basis for jurisdiction.

That is because the best\nevidence of congressional intent is the text of the statute.\nSee West Virginia Univ. Hosps., Inc. v.

The court, however,\nmust look not only to the particular statutory language, but\nto the design of the statute as a whole and its objectives\nand policies. See Crandon v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112379\"><a href=\"/opinion/112379/crandon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n158 (1990); Schneider, 14 F.3d at 879.\n\nIt is apparent from the plain language of S 4053, that it\nprovides subject-matter jurisdiction only for a coverage, or\nbreach of contract, cause of action based on a denial of an\ninsurance claim and not for state-law torts which arise out\nof the claims investigation and adjustment procedure\nexecuted by the insurance company. Section 4053 provides\nthat an insured may institute a lawsuit on a \"claim\" on the\npolicy when the claim has been \"disallow[ed].\" We interpret\nthis language to refer only to suits challenging the failure to\npay the insurance \"claim.\" The language makes no explicit\n\n                               8\n\for implicit reference to other causes of action that may\narise during a claims investigation. Indeed, if claims like\nthe Van Holts' were allowed in federal court it would not be\nnecessary for the insurance company to first deny coverage.\nConceivably, the insurance company could commit state-\nlaw torts even when it pays the claim, by delaying payment\nor engaging in other misconduct in the adjustment process.\nCongress could have chosen to use broader language, such\nas \"relating to the insurance policy\" or \"relating to the\nclaim's investigation or adjustment.\" It chose not to do so.\nThus, we must respect Congress' choice and cannot add\nlanguage to the statute where none exists.\n\nIn their complaint, the Van Holts do not assert a cause\nof action \"on ... [their] claim\" under the Liberty Mutual\nflood insurance policy. As the defendant acknowledges, the\nVan Holts do not assert that Liberty Mutual's failure to pay\nthe claim was a breach of the flood insurance policy or\nrequest that the district court order that Liberty Mutual\ncover their losses. Instead, the plaintiffs, citing New Jersey\nstate law, claim that Liberty Mutual committed two torts in\nthe course of the investigation and adjustment of their\ninsurance claims and request damages to compensate them\nfor their losses suffered as a result of these torts and to\npunish Liberty Mutual for committing the torts.4\n\nNeither the plain language nor the object and policies of\nthe NFIA and its regulations tend to show that Congress\nintended to provide for subject-matter jurisdiction for state-\nlaw torts arising out of flood insurance polices. See Spence,\n996 F.2d at 796. Indeed, the legislative history of S 4053\nspecifically states that, even though claimants may sue for\ncoverage in federal court, they maintain the right to pursue\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Liberty Mutual contends that there is federal subject-matter\njurisdiction for a claim under state bad-faith law because such a claim\nis a contract claim. See Pickett, 621 A.2d at 452 (refusing to\ncharacterize\nbad faith claim as having basis in tort or contract law). This argument\nis unpersuasive because federal law, namely the language of S 4053,\ndetermines what claims are permitted in federal court and there is no\nevidence that Congress intended to incorporate state bad-faith law into\nS 4053. Cf. Spence, 996 F.2d at 796 (in statute of limitations issues,\nfederal interests in regulation of flood insurance do not require that\nstate\nlaw be disregarded when insured asserts state-law torts against insurer).\n\n                               9\n\fother \"legal remedies in State courts.\" H.R.

Also, the present regulations provide for substantial\nindependence of the private Write-Your-Own companies in\nthe adjustment and investigation of claims, see 44 C.F.R.\nS 62.23(e), do not permit the companies to draw down on\nthe letters of credit for claims of fraud, and that the\ninsurance companies are not agents of the federal\ngovernment. Spence, 996 F.2d at 796 & ns.15-17.5\n\nAllowing jurisdiction over claims such as the Van Holts'\nwould have far reaching implications for the federal courts\nand insurance law, implications not intended by Congress.\nIf we found subject-matter jurisdiction, we would have to\nconclude either that Congress intended federal courts to\nenforce state-law imposed duties in all flood insurance\ncases or that Congress intended to create a federal common\nlaw regulating insurance company practices when there is\nno indication that state courts and state legislatures are\nincapable of carrying out this function. There is no evidence\neither in the NFIA or the legislative history that Congress\nintended such a result.\n\nAlthough it addressed a slightly different issue, we find\nthe reasoning in Spence instructive. In Spence, the\nplaintiffs brought suit in federal district court alleging that\nthe defendant, an insurance company, breached the flood\ninsurance policy issued to them when it refused to cover\ntheir losses and committed torts under Texas state law\nduring the claims adjustment and investigation procedure.\nThe defendant argued that all the claims, including the\nstate-law claims, were barred by the one-year suit\nlimitations period contained in the SFIP. See 44 C.F.R. Pt.\n61, App. A(1), Art. VIII(Q). The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the defendant's\nargument, holding that Texas state law, and not the NFIA,\nprovided the limitations period for the state law torts. The\nSpence court held that the independence granted insurance\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Section 4072 does not permit jurisdiction because it allows suit only\nagainst FEMA which is not a party to this action.\n\n                               10\n\fcompanies in claims adjustment, the fact that the\ncompanies are not government agents, and that companies\nmay not draw down on letters of credit for fraud claims\nevidenced that Congress did not intend to federalize state-\nlaw claims in the flood-insurance context. That same\nreasoning applies here. There is simply no indication that\nCongress intended to create jurisdiction for any claims\nother than coverage claims.\n\nAs with S 4053, the provision in the insurance policy\nissued to the Van Holts--the identical one construed by the\nSpence court--provides only for a coverage claim. The\nclause narrowly provides that suit must be in federal court\nif the suit seeks to recover money \"under this policy\" and\nmakes no mention of other causes of action or implies that\nthey would be covered. (Emphasis added). Regardless, even\nif the provision allowed for a right to sue in federal court for\ncauses of actions other than coverage claims, it is\ninsufficient, on its own, to confer federal subject-matter\njurisdiction over a complaint. It is well settled that parties\ncannot confer subject-matter jurisdiction either by\nagreement or by waiver. See, e.g., Brown v. Francis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712184\"><a href=\"/opinion/712184/barry-brown-jolie-stahl-as-they-are-trustees-of-the-long-bay-trust-v-leo/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 866 (3d Cir. 1996); United Indus. Workers v.\nGovernment of Virgin Islands, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168 (3d Cir.\n1993) (collecting cases).\n\nFinally, diversity of citizenship does not provide a basis of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction here. The plaintiffs do not allege\nthat the parties are diverse and we have searched the\ncomplaint in vain for any allegation of the parties'\ncitizenship or a reference to the diversity statute. The Van\nHolts contend only that subject-matter jurisdiction is\npremised on S 4053. It is the plaintiffs' burden to allege a\nbasis for subject-matter jurisdiction. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n8(a)(1). They have failed to do so. Hence, the complaint\nmust be dismissed.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court's December\n2, 1996 judgment is vacated. This case will be remanded to\nthe district court with instructions to dismiss for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction. Costs taxed against appellants.\n\n                               11\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               12\n\f</pre>",
