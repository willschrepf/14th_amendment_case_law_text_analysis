RAICH ET\r\n                    AL.\r\n\r\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\r\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\r\n\r\n   No. 03–1454. Argued November 29, 2004—Decided June 6, 2005\r\nCalifornia’s Compassionate Use Act authorizes limited marijuana use\r\n  for medicinal purposes. Respondents Raich and Monson are Califor-\r\n  nia residents who both use doctor-recommended marijuana for seri-\r\n  ous medical conditions. After federal Drug Enforcement Administra-\r\n  tion (DEA) agents seized and destroyed all six of Monson’s cannabis\r\n  plants, respondents brought this action seeking injunctive and de-\r\n  claratory relief prohibiting the enforcement of the federal Controlled\r\n  Substances Act (CSA) to the extent it prevents them from possessing,\r\n  obtaining, or manufacturing cannabis for their personal medical use.\r\n  Respondents claim that enforcing the CSA against them would vio-\r\n  late the Commerce Clause and other constitutional provisions. The\r\n  District Court denied respondents’ motion for a preliminary injunc-\r\n  tion, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that they had demon-\r\n  strated a strong likelihood of success on the claim that the CSA is an\r\n  unconstitutional exercise of Congress’ Commerce Clause authority as\r\n  applied to the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of\r\n  cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by a patient’s\r\n  physician pursuant to valid California state law. The court relied\r\n  heavily on United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, and United States v.\r\n  Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, to hold that this separate class of purely lo-\r\n  cal activities was beyond the reach of federal power.\r\nHeld: Congress’ Commerce Clause authority includes the power to pro-\r\n hibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana in compliance with\r\n California law. Pp. 6–31.\r\n    (a) For the purposes of consolidating various drug laws into a com-\r\n prehensive statute, providing meaningful regulation over legitimate\r\n sources of drugs to prevent diversion into illegal channels, and\r\n\f2                          GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                                   Syllabus\r\n\r\n    strengthening law enforcement tools against international and inter-\r\n    state drug trafficking, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Drug\r\n    Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Title II of which is the\r\n    CSA. To effectuate the statutory goals, Congress devised a closed\r\n    regulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture, distribute,\r\n    dispense, or possess any controlled substance except as authorized by\r\n    the CSA. 21 U. S. C. §§841(a)(1), 844(a). All controlled substances\r\n    are classified into five schedules, §812, based on their accepted medi-\r\n    cal uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological and physi-\r\n    cal effects on the body, §§811, 812. Marijuana is classified as a\r\n    Schedule I substance, §812(c), based on its high potential for abuse,\r\n    no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically\r\n    supervised treatment, §812(b)(1). This classification renders the\r\n    manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana a criminal of-\r\n    fense. §§841(a)(1), 844(a). Pp. 6–11.\r\n       (b) Congress’ power to regulate purely local activities that are part\r\n    of an economic “class of activities” that have a substantial effect on\r\n    interstate commerce is firmly established. See, e.g., Perez v. United\r\n    States, 402 U. S. 146, 151. If Congress decides that the “ ‘total inci-\r\n    dence’ ” of a practice poses a threat to a national market, it may regu-\r\n    late the entire class. See, e.g., id., at 154–155. Of particular rele-\r\n    vance here is Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 127–128, where, in\r\n    rejecting the appellee farmer’s contention that Congress’ admitted\r\n    power to regulate the production of wheat for commerce did not au-\r\n    thorize federal regulation of wheat production intended wholly for the\r\n    appellee’s own consumption, the Court established that Congress can\r\n    regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself “commercial,” i.e.,\r\n    not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate that class\r\n    of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in\r\n    that commodity. The similarities between this case and Wickard\r\n    are striking. In both cases, the regulation is squarely within Con-\r\n    gress’ commerce power because production of the commodity meant\r\n    for home consumption, be it wheat or marijuana, has a substantial ef-\r\n    fect on supply and demand in the national market for that commod-\r\n    ity. In assessing the scope of Congress’ Commerce Clause authority,\r\n    the Court need not determine whether respondents’ activities, taken\r\n    in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but\r\n    only whether a “rational basis” exists for so concluding. E.g., Lopez,\r\n    514 U. S., at 557. Given the enforcement difficulties that attend dis-\r\n    tinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana\r\n    grown elsewhere, 21 U. S. C. §801(5), and concerns about diversion\r\n    into illicit channels, the Court has no difficulty concluding that Con-\r\n    gress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the in-\r\n    trastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gap-\r\n\f                      Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                       3\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\n  ing hole in the CSA. Pp. 12–20.\r\n    (c) Respondents’ heavy reliance on Lopez and Morrison overlooks\r\n  the larger context of modern-era Commerce Clause jurisprudence\r\n  preserved by those cases, while also reading those cases far too\r\n  broadly. The statutory challenges at issue there were markedly dif-\r\n  ferent from the challenge here. Respondents ask the Court to excise\r\n  individual applications of a concededly valid comprehensive statutory\r\n  scheme. In contrast, in both Lopez and Morrison, the parties as-\r\n  serted that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress’\r\n  commerce power in its entirety. This distinction is pivotal for the\r\n  Court has often reiterated that “[w]here the class of activities is regu-\r\n  lated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts\r\n  have no power ‘to excise, as trivial, individual instances’ of the class.”\r\n  Perez, 402 U. S., at 154. Moreover, the Court emphasized that the\r\n  laws at issue in Lopez and Morrison had nothing to do with “com-\r\n  merce” or any sort of economic enterprise. See Lopez, 514 U. S., at\r\n  561; Morrison, 529 U. S., at 610. In contrast, the CSA regulates\r\n  quintessentially economic activities: the production, distribution, and\r\n  consumption of commodities for which there is an established, and\r\n  lucrative, interstate market. Prohibiting the intrastate possession or\r\n  manufacture of an article of commerce is a rational means of regulat-\r\n  ing commerce in that product. The Ninth Circuit cast doubt on the\r\n  CSA’s constitutionality by isolating a distinct class of activities that it\r\n  held to be beyond the reach of federal power: the intrastate, non-\r\n  commercial cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for personal\r\n  medical purposes on the advice of a physician and in accordance with\r\n  state law. However, Congress clearly acted rationally in determining\r\n  that this subdivided class of activities is an essential part of the lar-\r\n  ger regulatory scheme. The case comes down to the claim that a locally\r\n  cultivated product that is used domestically rather than sold on the\r\n  open market is not subject to federal regulation. Given the CSA’s find-\r\n  ings and the undisputed magnitude of the commercial market for mari-\r\n  juana, Wickard and its progeny foreclose that claim.

RAICH\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n                              I\r\n   California has been a pioneer in the regulation of mari-\r\njuana. In 1913, California was one of the first States to\r\nprohibit the sale and possession of marijuana,2 and at the\r\nend of the century, California became the first State to\r\nauthorize limited use of the drug for medicinal purposes.\r\nIn 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, now\r\ncodified as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.3 The propo-\r\nsition was designed to ensure that “seriously ill” residents of\r\nthe State have access to marijuana for medical purposes,\r\nand to encourage Federal and State Governments to take\r\nsteps towards ensuring the safe and affordable distribution\r\nof the drug to patients in need.4 The Act creates an exemp-\r\ntion from criminal prosecution for physicians,5 as well as for\r\n——————\r\n    2 1913Cal. Stats. ch. 324, §8a; see also Gieringer, The Origins of\r\nCannabis Prohibition in California, Contemporary Drug Problems, 21–\r\n23 (rev. 2005).\r\n  3 Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann. §11362.5 (West Supp. 2005). The\r\n\r\nCalifornia Legislature recently enacted additional legislation supple-\r\nmenting the Compassionate Use Act. §§11362.7–11362.9 (West Supp.\r\n2005).\r\n  4 “The people of the State of California hereby find and declare that\r\n\r\nthe purposes of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as follows:\r\n  “(A) To ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain\r\nand use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is\r\ndeemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician who\r\nhas determined that the person’s health would benefit from the use of\r\nmarijuana in the treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain,\r\nspasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which\r\nmarijuana provides relief.\r\n  “(B) To ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain\r\nand use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a\r\nphysician are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction.\r\n  “(C) To encourage the federal and state governments to implement a\r\nplan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to\r\nall patients in medical need of marijuana.” §11362.5(b)(1) (West Supp.\r\n2005).\r\n  5 “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no physician in this\r\n\r\nstate shall be punished, or denied any right or privilege, for having\r\n\f                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                    3\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npatients and primary caregivers who possess or cultivate\r\nmarijuana for medicinal purposes with the recommendation\r\nor approval of a physician.6 A “primary caregiver” is a\r\nperson who has consistently assumed responsibility for the\r\nhousing, health, or safety of the patient.7\r\n   Respondents Angel Raich and Diane Monson are Cali-\r\nfornia residents who suffer from a variety of serious medi-\r\ncal conditions and have sought to avail themselves of\r\nmedical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the Compas-\r\nsionate Use Act. They are being treated by licensed,\r\nboard-certified family practitioners, who have concluded,\r\nafter prescribing a host of conventional medicines to treat\r\nrespondents’ conditions and to alleviate their associated\r\nsymptoms, that marijuana is the only drug available that\r\nprovides effective treatment. Both women have been\r\nusing marijuana as a medication for several years pursu-\r\nant to their doctors’ recommendation, and both rely heav-\r\nily on cannabis to function on a daily basis. Indeed,\r\nRaich’s physician believes that forgoing cannabis treat-\r\nments would certainly cause Raich excruciating pain and\r\ncould very well prove fatal.\r\n   Respondent Monson cultivates her own marijuana, and\r\ningests the drug in a variety of ways including smoking\r\nand using a vaporizer. Respondent Raich, by contrast, is\r\nunable to cultivate her own, and thus relies on two care-\r\ngivers, litigating as “John Does,” to provide her with lo-\r\ncally grown marijuana at no charge. These caregivers also\r\n\r\n——————\r\nrecommended marijuana to a patient for medical purposes.”\r\n§11362.5(c) (West Supp. 2005).\r\n  6 “Section 11357, relating to the possession of marijuana, and Section\r\n\r\n11358, relating to the cultivation of marijuana, shall not apply to a\r\npatient, or to a patient’s primary caregiver, who possesses or cultivates\r\nmarijuana for the personal medical purposes of the patient upon the\r\nwritten or oral recommendation or approval of a physician.” §11362.5(d)\r\n(West Supp. 2005).\r\n  7 §11362.5(e) (West Supp. 2005).\r\n\f4                   GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nprocess the cannabis into hashish or keif, and Raich her-\r\nself processes some of the marijuana into oils, balms, and\r\nfoods for consumption.\r\n   On August 15, 2002, county deputy sheriffs and agents\r\nfrom the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\r\ncame to Monson’s home. After a thorough investigation,\r\nthe county officials concluded that her use of marijuana\r\nwas entirely lawful as a matter of California law. Never-\r\ntheless, after a 3-hour standoff, the federal agents seized\r\nand destroyed all six of her cannabis plants.\r\n   Respondents thereafter brought this action against the\r\nAttorney General of the United States and the head of the\r\nDEA seeking injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting\r\nthe enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act\r\n(CSA), 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. §801 et seq., to the extent\r\nit prevents them from possessing, obtaining, or manufac-\r\nturing cannabis for their personal medical use. In their\r\ncomplaint and supporting affidavits, Raich and Monson\r\ndescribed the severity of their afflictions, their repeatedly\r\nfutile attempts to obtain relief with conventional medica-\r\ntions, and the opinions of their doctors concerning their\r\nneed to use marijuana. Respondents claimed that enforc-\r\ning the CSA against them would violate the Commerce\r\nClause, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,\r\nthe Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution,\r\nand the doctrine of medical necessity.\r\n   The District Court denied respondents’ motion for a\r\npreliminary injunction. Raich v. Ashcroft, 248 F. Supp. 2d\r\n918 (ND Cal. 2003). Although the court found that the\r\nfederal enforcement interests “wane[d]” when compared to\r\nthe harm that California residents would suffer if denied\r\naccess to medically necessary marijuana, it concluded that\r\nrespondents could not demonstrate a likelihood of success\r\non the merits of their legal claims. Id., at 931.\r\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\r\nCircuit reversed and ordered the District Court to enter a\r\n\f                    Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                   5\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npreliminary injunction.8 Raich v. Ashcroft, 352 F. 3d 1222\r\n(2003). The court found that respondents had “demon-\r\nstrated a strong likelihood of success on their claim that,\r\nas applied to them, the CSA is an unconstitutional exer-\r\ncise of Congress’ Commerce Clause authority.” Id., at\r\n1227. The Court of Appeals distinguished prior Circuit\r\ncases upholding the CSA in the face of Commerce Clause\r\nchallenges by focusing on what it deemed to be the “sepa-\r\nrate and distinct class of activities” at issue in this case:\r\n“the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of\r\ncannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by\r\na patient’s physician pursuant to valid California state law.”\r\nId., at 1228. The court found the latter class of activities\r\n“different in kind from drug trafficking” because interposing\r\na physician’s recommendation raises different health and\r\nsafety concerns, and because “this limited use is clearly\r\ndistinct from the broader illicit drug market—as well as\r\nany broader commercial market for medicinal mari-\r\njuana—insofar as the medicinal marijuana at issue in this\r\ncase is not intended for, nor does it enter, the stream of\r\ncommerce.” Ibid.\r\n   The majority placed heavy reliance on our decisions in\r\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and United\r\nStates v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000), as interpreted by\r\nrecent Circuit precedent, to hold that this separate class of\r\npurely local activities was beyond the reach of federal\r\npower. In contrast, the dissenting judge concluded that\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   8 On remand, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction\r\n\r\nenjoining petitioners “ ‘from arresting or prosecuting Plaintiffs Angel\r\nMcClary Raich and Diane Monson, seizing their medical cannabis,\r\nforfeiting their property, or seeking civil or administrative sanctions\r\nagainst them with respect to the intrastate, non-commercial cultiva-\r\ntion, possession, use, and obtaining without charge of cannabis for\r\npersonal medical purposes on the advice of a physician and in accor-\r\ndance with state law, and which is not used for distribution, sale, or\r\nexchange.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 9.\r\n\f6                        GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthe CSA, as applied to respondents, was clearly valid\r\nunder Lopez and Morrison; moreover, he thought it “sim-\r\nply impossible to distinguish the relevant conduct sur-\r\nrounding the cultivation and use of the marijuana crop at\r\nissue in this case from the cultivation and use of the wheat\r\ncrop that affected interstate commerce in Wickard v.\r\nFilburn.” 352 F. 3d, at 1235 (Beam, J., dissenting) (cita-\r\ntion omitted).\r\n   The obvious importance of the case prompted our grant\r\nof certiorari. 542 U. S. 936 (2004). The case is made\r\ndifficult by respondents’ strong arguments that they will\r\nsuffer irreparable harm because, despite a congressional\r\nfinding to the contrary, marijuana does have valid thera-\r\npeutic purposes. The question before us, however, is not\r\nwhether it is wise to enforce the statute in these circum-\r\nstances; rather, it is whether Congress’ power to regulate\r\ninterstate markets for medicinal substances encompasses\r\nthe portions of those markets that are supplied with drugs\r\nproduced and consumed locally. Well-settled law controls\r\nour answer. The CSA is a valid exercise of federal power,\r\neven as applied to the troubling facts of this case. We\r\naccordingly vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\r\n                                II\r\n   Shortly after taking office in 1969, President Nixon\r\ndeclared a national “war on drugs.”9 As the first campaign\r\nof that war, Congress set out to enact legislation that\r\nwould consolidate various drug laws on the books into a\r\ncomprehensive statute, provide meaningful regulation\r\nover legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversion into\r\nillegal channels, and strengthen law enforcement tools\r\nagainst the traffic in illicit drugs.10 That effort culminated\r\n——————\r\n    9 See\r\n        D.

Rather, as early as\r\n1906 Congress enacted federal legislation imposing label-\r\ning regulations on medications and prohibiting the manu-\r\nfacture or shipment of any adulterated or misbranded\r\ndrug traveling in interstate commerce.11 Aside from these\r\nlabeling restrictions, most domestic drug regulations prior\r\nto 1970 generally came in the guise of revenue laws, with\r\nthe Department of the Treasury serving as the Federal\r\nGovernment’s primary enforcer.12 For example, the pri-\r\nmary drug control law, before being repealed by the pas-\r\nsage of the CSA, was the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914,\r\n38 Stat. 785 (repealed 1970). The Harrison Act sought to\r\nexert control over the possession and sale of narcotics,\r\nspecifically cocaine and opiates, by requiring producers,\r\ndistributors, and purchasers to register with the Federal\r\nGovernment, by assessing taxes against parties so regis-\r\ntered, and by regulating the issuance of prescriptions.13\r\n   Marijuana itself was not significantly regulated by the\r\nFederal Government until 1937 when accounts of mari-\r\njuana’s addictive qualities and physiological effects, paired\r\nwith dissatisfaction with enforcement efforts at state and\r\nlocal levels, prompted Congress to pass the Marihuana\r\nTax Act, Pub.

RAICH\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nLike the Harrison Act, the Marihuana Tax Act did not\r\noutlaw the possession or sale of marijuana outright.\r\nRather, it imposed registration and reporting require-\r\nments for all individuals importing, producing, selling, or\r\ndealing in marijuana, and required the payment of annual\r\ntaxes in addition to transfer taxes whenever the drug\r\nchanged hands.15 Moreover, doctors wishing to prescribe\r\nmarijuana for medical purposes were required to comply\r\nwith rather burdensome administrative requirements.16\r\nNoncompliance exposed traffickers to severe federal penal-\r\nties, whereas compliance would often subject them to\r\nprosecution under state law.17 Thus, while the Marihuana\r\nTax Act did not declare the drug illegal per se, the onerous\r\nadministrative requirements, the prohibitively expensive\r\ntaxes, and the risks attendant on compliance practically\r\ncurtailed the marijuana trade.\r\n   Then in 1970, after declaration of the national “war on\r\ndrugs,” federal drug policy underwent a significant trans-\r\nformation. A number of noteworthy events precipitated\r\nthis policy shift. First, in Leary v. United States, 395 U. S.\r\n6 (1969), this Court held certain provisions of the Marihu-\r\nana Tax Act and other narcotics legislation unconstitu-\r\ntional. Second, at the end of his term, President Johnson\r\nfundamentally reorganized the federal drug control agen-\r\ncies. The Bureau of Narcotics, then housed in the De-\r\npartment of Treasury, merged with the Bureau of Drug\r\nAbuse Control, then housed in the Department of Health,\r\nEducation, and Welfare (HEW), to create the Bureau of\r\nNarcotics and Dangerous Drugs, currently housed in the\r\nDepartment of Justice.18 Finally, prompted by a perceived\r\n——————\r\nregulating the sale, use, or possession of marijuana.

See Reorg. Plan No. 2 of 1973, §1, 28 CFR\r\n§0.100 (1973).\r\n   19 The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of\r\n\r\n1970 consists of three titles. Title I relates to the prevention and\r\ntreatment of narcotic addicts through HEW (now the Department of\r\nHealth and Human Services). 84 Stat. 1238. Title II, as discussed in\r\nmore detail above, addresses drug control and enforcement as adminis-\r\ntered by the Attorney General and the DEA. Id., at 1242. Title III\r\nconcerns the import and export of controlled substances. Id., at 1285.\r\n   20 In particular, Congress made the following findings:\r\n\r\n   “(1) Many of the drugs included within this subchapter have a useful\r\nand legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the\r\nhealth and general welfare of the American people.\r\n   “(2) The illegal importation, manufacture, distribution, and posses-\r\nsion and improper use of controlled substances have a substantial and\r\ndetrimental effect on the health and general welfare of the American\r\npeople.\r\n   “(3) A major portion of the traffic in controlled substances flows\r\nthrough interstate and foreign commerce. Incidents of the traffic which\r\nare not an integral part of the interstate or foreign flow, such as manu-\r\nfacture, local distribution, and possession, nonetheless have a substan-\r\ntial and direct effect upon interstate commerce because—\r\n      “(A) after manufacture, many controlled substances are trans-\r\nported in interstate commerce,\r\n      “(B) controlled substances distributed locally usually have been\r\ntransported in interstate commerce immediately before their distribu-\r\ntion, and\r\n      “(C) controlled substances possessed commonly flow through\r\ninterstate commerce immediately prior to such possession.\r\n\f10                        GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                           Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nconcerned with the need to prevent the diversion of drugs\r\nfrom legitimate to illicit channels.21\r\n  To effectuate these goals, Congress devised a closed\r\nregulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture,\r\ndistribute, dispense, or possess any controlled substance\r\nexcept in a manner authorized by the CSA. 21 U. S. C.\r\n§§841(a)(1), 844(a). The CSA categorizes all controlled\r\nsubstances into five schedules. §812. The drugs are\r\ngrouped together based on their accepted medical uses,\r\nthe potential for abuse, and their psychological and physi-\r\ncal effects on the body. §§811, 812. Each schedule is\r\nassociated with a distinct set of controls regarding the\r\nmanufacture, distribution, and use of the substances listed\r\ntherein. §§821–830. The CSA and its implementing\r\nregulations set forth strict requirements regarding regis-\r\ntration, labeling and packaging, production quotas, drug\r\nsecurity, and recordkeeping. Ibid. 21 CFR §1301 et seq.\r\n(2004).\r\n  In enacting the CSA, Congress classified marijuana as a\r\nSchedule I drug. 21 U. S. C. §812(c). This preliminary\r\nclassification was based, in part, on the recommendation\r\nof the Assistant Secretary of HEW “that marihuana be\r\nretained within schedule I at least until the completion of\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   “(4) Local distribution and possession of controlled substances con-\r\ntribute to swelling the interstate traffic in such substances.\r\n   “(5) Controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate\r\ncannot be differentiated from controlled substances manufactured and\r\ndistributed interstate. Thus, it is not feasible to distinguish, in terms of\r\ncontrols, between controlled substances manufactured and distributed\r\ninterstate and controlled substances manufactured and distributed\r\nintrastate.\r\n   “(6) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in con-\r\ntrolled substances is essential to the effective control of the interstate\r\nincidents of such traffic.” 21 U. S. C. §§801(1)–(6).\r\n   21 See United States v. Moore, 423 U. S. 122, 135 (1975); see also H. R.\r\n\r\nRep., at 22.\r\n\f                     Cite as: 545 U.

These three factors, in varying grada-\r\ntions, are also used to categorize drugs in the other four\r\nschedules. For example, Schedule II substances also have\r\na high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psy-\r\nchological or physical dependence, but unlike Schedule I\r\ndrugs, they have a currently accepted medical use.\r\n§812(b)(2). By classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug,\r\nas opposed to listing it on a lesser schedule, the manufac-\r\nture, distribution, or possession of marijuana became a\r\ncriminal offense, with the sole exception being use of the\r\ndrug as part of a Food and Drug Administration pre-\r\napproved research study. §§823(f), 841(a)(1), 844(a); see\r\nalso United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coopera-\r\ntive, 532 U. S. 483, 490 (2001).\r\n   The CSA provides for the periodic updating of schedules\r\nand delegates authority to the Attorney General, after\r\nconsultation with the Secretary of Health and Human\r\nServices, to add, remove, or transfer substances to, from,\r\nor between schedules. §811. Despite considerable efforts\r\nto reschedule marijuana, it remains a Schedule I drug.23\r\n——————\r\n  22 H. R. Rep., at 61 (quoting letter from Roger E. Egeberg, M. D. to\r\n\r\nHon. Harley O.

Brief for Respondents 22, 38. Nor do they\r\ncontend that any provision or section of the CSA amounts\r\nto an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority.\r\nRather, respondents’ challenge is actually quite limited;\r\nthey argue that the CSA’s categorical prohibition of the\r\nmanufacture and possession of marijuana as applied to\r\nthe intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana\r\nfor medical purposes pursuant to California law exceeds\r\nCongress’ authority under the Commerce Clause.\r\n   In assessing the validity of congressional regulation,\r\nnone of our Commerce Clause cases can be viewed in\r\nisolation. As charted in considerable detail in United\r\nStates v. Lopez, our understanding of the reach of the\r\nCommerce Clause, as well as Congress’ assertion of au-\r\nthority thereunder, has evolved over time.24 The Com-\r\nmerce Clause emerged as the Framers’ response to the\r\ncentral problem giving rise to the Constitution itself: the\r\nabsence of any federal commerce power under the Articles\r\nof Confederation.25 For the first century of our history, the\r\nprimary use of the Clause was to preclude the kind of\r\ndiscriminatory state legislation that had once been per-\r\n\r\n——————\r\n2001. 66 Fed.

S. C. §2 et seq.27\r\n   Cases decided during that “new era,” which now spans\r\nmore than a century, have identified three general catego-\r\nries of regulation in which Congress is authorized to en-\r\ngage under its commerce power. First, Congress can\r\nregulate the channels of interstate commerce. Perez v.\r\nUnited States, 402 U. S. 146, 150 (1971). Second, Congress\r\nhas authority to regulate and protect the instrumentalities\r\nof interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate\r\ncommerce. Ibid. Third, Congress has the power to regu-\r\nlate activities that substantially affect interstate com-\r\nmerce. Ibid.; NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301\r\nU. S. 1, 37 (1937). Only the third category is implicated in\r\nthe case at hand.\r\n   Our case law firmly establishes Congress’ power to\r\nregulate purely local activities that are part of an eco-\r\nnomic “class of activities” that have a substantial effect on\r\ninterstate commerce. See, e.g., Perez, 402 U. S., at 151;\r\n——————\r\n  26 See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 553–554; id., at 568–569 (KENNEDY, J.,\r\n\r\nconcurring); see also Granholm v. Heald, 544 U.

S.\r\n\r\n111, 121 (1942) (“It was not until 1887, with the enactment of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Act, that the interstate commerce power began\r\nto exert positive influence in American law and life. This first impor-\r\ntant federal resort to the commerce power was followed in 1890 by the\r\nSherman Anti-Trust Act and, thereafter, mainly after 1903, by many\r\nothers. These statutes ushered in new phases of adjudication, which\r\nrequired the Court to approach the interpretation of the Commerce\r\nClause in the light of an actual exercise by Congress of its power\r\nthereunder” (footnotes omitted)).\r\n\f14                   GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nWickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 128–129 (1942). As we\r\nstated in Wickard, “even if appellee’s activity be local and\r\nthough it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still,\r\nwhatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a\r\nsubstantial economic effect on interstate commerce.” Id.,\r\nat 125. We have never required Congress to legislate with\r\nscientific exactitude. When Congress decides that the\r\n“ ‘total incidence’ ” of a practice poses a threat to a national\r\nmarket, it may regulate the entire class. See Perez, 402\r\nU. S., at 154–155 (quoting Westfall v. United States, 274\r\nU. S. 256, 259 (1927) (“[W]hen it is necessary in order to\r\nprevent an evil to make the law embrace more than the\r\nprecise thing to be prevented it may do so”)). In this vein,\r\nwe have reiterated that when “‘a general regulatory statute\r\nbears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis\r\ncharacter of individual instances arising under that statute\r\nis of no consequence.’” E.g., Lopez, 514 U. S., at 558 (em-\r\nphasis deleted) (quoting Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183,\r\n196, n. 27 (1968)).\r\n    Our decision in Wickard, 317 U. S. 111, is of particular\r\nrelevance. In Wickard, we upheld the application of regu-\r\nlations promulgated under the Agricultural Adjustment\r\nAct of 1938, 52 Stat. 31, which were designed to control\r\nthe volume of wheat moving in interstate and foreign\r\ncommerce in order to avoid surpluses and consequent\r\nabnormally low prices. The regulations established an\r\nallotment of 11.1 acres for Filburn’s 1941 wheat crop, but\r\nhe sowed 23 acres, intending to use the excess by consum-\r\ning it on his own farm. Filburn argued that even though\r\nwe had sustained Congress’ power to regulate the produc-\r\ntion of goods for commerce, that power did not authorize\r\n“federal regulation [of] production not intended in any\r\npart for commerce but wholly for consumption on the\r\nfarm.” Wickard, 317 U. S., at 118. Justice Jackson’s\r\nopinion for a unanimous Court rejected this submission.\r\nHe wrote:\r\n\f                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                   15\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n     “The effect of the statute before us is to restrict the\r\n     amount which may be produced for market and the\r\n     extent as well to which one may forestall resort to the\r\n     market by producing to meet his own needs. That ap-\r\n     pellee’s own contribution to the demand for wheat\r\n     may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him\r\n     from the scope of federal regulation where, as here,\r\n     his contribution, taken together with that of many\r\n     others similarly situated, is far from trivial.” Id., at\r\n     127–128.\r\nWickard thus establishes that Congress can regulate\r\npurely intrastate activity that is not itself “commercial,” in\r\nthat it is not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure\r\nto regulate that class of activity would undercut the regu-\r\nlation of the interstate market in that commodity.\r\n  The similarities between this case and Wickard are\r\nstriking. Like the farmer in Wickard, respondents are\r\ncultivating, for home consumption, a fungible commodity\r\nfor which there is an established, albeit illegal, interstate\r\nmarket.28 Just as the Agricultural Adjustment Act was\r\ndesigned “to control the volume [of wheat] moving in\r\ninterstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid sur-\r\npluses . . .” and consequently control the market price,\r\nid., at 115, a primary purpose of the CSA is to control the\r\nsupply and demand of controlled substances in both\r\nlawful and unlawful drug markets. See nn. 20–21, supra.\r\n——————\r\n  28 Even respondents acknowledge the existence of an illicit market in\r\n\r\nmarijuana; indeed, Raich has personally participated in that market,\r\nand Monson expresses a willingness to do so in the future.

RAICH\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nIn Wickard, we had no difficulty concluding that Con-\r\ngress had a rational basis for believing that, when viewed\r\nin the aggregate, leaving home-consumed wheat outside\r\nthe regulatory scheme would have a substantial influence\r\non price and market conditions. Here too, Congress had\r\na rational basis for concluding that leaving home-\r\nconsumed marijuana outside federal control would simi-\r\nlarly affect price and market conditions.\r\n   More concretely, one concern prompting inclusion of\r\nwheat grown for home consumption in the 1938 Act was\r\nthat rising market prices could draw such wheat into the\r\ninterstate market, resulting in lower market prices.\r\nWickard, 317 U. S., at 128. The parallel concern making it\r\nappropriate to include marijuana grown for home con-\r\nsumption in the CSA is the likelihood that the high de-\r\nmand in the interstate market will draw such marijuana\r\ninto that market. While the diversion of homegrown\r\nwheat tended to frustrate the federal interest in stabiliz-\r\ning prices by regulating the volume of commercial transac-\r\ntions in the interstate market, the diversion of homegrown\r\nmarijuana tends to frustrate the federal interest in elimi-\r\nnating commercial transactions in the interstate market\r\nin their entirety. In both cases, the regulation is squarely\r\nwithin Congress’ commerce power because production of\r\nthe commodity meant for home consumption, be it wheat\r\nor marijuana, has a substantial effect on supply and de-\r\nmand in the national market for that commodity.29\r\n——————\r\n   29 To be sure, the wheat market is a lawful market that Congress\r\n\r\nsought to protect and stabilize, whereas the marijuana market is an\r\nunlawful market that Congress sought to eradicate. This difference,\r\nhowever, is of no constitutional import. It has long been settled that\r\nCongress’ power to regulate commerce includes the power to prohibit\r\ncommerce in a particular commodity. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 571 (KENNEDY,\r\nJ., concurring) (“In the Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321 (1903), the Court\r\nrejected the argument that Congress lacked [the] power to prohibit the\r\ninterstate movement of lottery tickets because it had power only to\r\nregulate, not to prohibit”); see also Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128 (“The\r\n\f                     Cite as: 545 U.

S., at\r\n127. That the Secretary of Agriculture elected to exempt\r\neven smaller farms from regulation does not speak to his\r\npower to regulate all those whose aggregated production\r\nwas significant, nor did that fact play any role in the\r\nCourt’s analysis. Moreover, even though Wickard was\r\nindeed a commercial farmer, the activity he was engaged\r\nin—the cultivation of wheat for home consumption—was\r\nnot treated by the Court as part of his commercial farming\r\noperation.30 And while it is true that the record in the\r\nWickard case itself established the causal connection\r\nbetween the production for local use and the national\r\nmarket, we have before us findings by Congress to the\r\nsame effect.\r\n  Findings in the introductory sections of the CSA explain\r\nwhy Congress deemed it appropriate to encompass local\r\nactivities within the scope of the CSA. See n. 20, supra.\r\nThe submissions of the parties and the numerous amici all\r\nseem to agree that the national, and international, market\r\n\r\n——————\r\nstimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as\r\ndefinitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon”).\r\n  30 See Wickard, 317 U. S., at 125 (recognizing that Wickard’s activity\r\n\r\n“may not be regarded as commerce”).\r\n\f18                        GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                           Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nfor marijuana has dimensions that are fully comparable to\r\nthose defining the class of activities regulated by the\r\nSecretary pursuant to the 1938 statute.31 Respondents\r\nnonetheless insist that the CSA cannot be constitutionally\r\napplied to their activities because Congress did not make a\r\nspecific finding that the intrastate cultivation and posses-\r\nsion of marijuana for medical purposes based on the rec-\r\nommendation of a physician would substantially affect the\r\nlarger interstate marijuana market. Be that as it may, we\r\nhave never required Congress to make particularized\r\nfindings in order to legislate, see Lopez, 514 U. S., at 562;\r\nPerez, 402 U. S., at 156, absent a special concern such as\r\nthe protection of free speech, see, e.g., Turner Broadcast-\r\ning System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 664–668 (1994)\r\n(plurality opinion).     While congressional findings are\r\ncertainly helpful in reviewing the substance of a congres-\r\nsional statutory scheme, particularly when the connection\r\nto commerce is not self-evident, and while we will consider\r\ncongressional findings in our analysis when they are\r\navailable, the absence of particularized findings does not\r\ncall into question Congress’ authority to legislate.32\r\n——————\r\n   31 The Executive Office of the President has estimated that in 2000\r\n\r\nAmerican users spent $10.5 billion on the purchase of marijuana.

We need not determine whether respondents’\r\nactivities, taken in the aggregate, substantially affect\r\ninterstate commerce in fact, but only whether a “rational\r\nbasis” exists for so concluding. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 557;\r\nsee also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation\r\nAssn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276–280 (1981); Perez, 402 U. S.,\r\nat 155–156; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.

Given the enforcement\r\ndifficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana\r\ncultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, 21\r\nU. S. C. §801(5), and concerns about diversion into illicit\r\nchannels,33 we have no difficulty concluding that Congress\r\nhad a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate\r\nthe intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana\r\nwould leave a gaping hole in the CSA. Thus, as in\r\nWickard, when it enacted comprehensive legislation to\r\nregulate the interstate market in a fungible commodity,\r\nCongress was acting well within its authority to “make all\r\nLaws which shall be necessary and proper” to “regulate\r\nCommerce . . . among the several States.” U. S. Const.,\r\nArt. I, §8. That the regulation ensnares some purely\r\nintrastate activity is of no moment. As we have done\r\nmany times before, we refuse to excise individual compo-\r\n——————\r\nexacting requirement is not only unprecedented, it is also impractical.\r\nIndeed, the principal dissent’s critique of Congress for “not even”\r\nincluding “declarations” specific to marijuana is particularly unpersua-\r\nsive given that the CSA initially identified 80 other substances subject\r\nto regulation as Schedule I drugs, not to mention those categorized in\r\nSchedules II–V. Post, at 14 (O’CONNOR, J., dissenting). Surely, Con-\r\ngress cannot be expected (and certainly should not be required) to\r\ninclude specific findings on each and every substance contained therein\r\nin order to satisfy the dissenters’ unfounded skepticism.\r\n  33 See n. 21, supra (citing sources that evince Congress’ particular\r\n\r\nconcern with the diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit channels).\r\n\f20                  GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nnents of that larger scheme.\r\n                              IV\r\n  To support their contrary submission, respondents rely\r\nheavily on two of our more recent Commerce Clause cases.\r\nIn their myopic focus, they overlook the larger context of\r\nmodern-era Commerce Clause jurisprudence preserved by\r\nthose cases. Moreover, even in the narrow prism of re-\r\nspondents’ creation, they read those cases far too broadly.\r\n  Those two cases, of course, are Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, and\r\nMorrison, 529 U. S. 598. As an initial matter, the statu-\r\ntory challenges at issue in those cases were markedly\r\ndifferent from the challenge respondents pursue in the\r\ncase at hand. Here, respondents ask us to excise individ-\r\nual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.\r\nIn contrast, in both Lopez and Morrison, the parties as-\r\nserted that a particular statute or provision fell outside\r\nCongress’ commerce power in its entirety. This distinction\r\nis pivotal for we have often reiterated that “[w]here the\r\nclass of activities is regulated and that class is within the\r\nreach of federal power, the courts have no power ‘to excise,\r\nas trivial, individual instances’ of the class.” Perez, 402\r\nU. S., at 154 (emphasis deleted) (quoting Wirtz, 392 U. S.,\r\nat 193); see also Hodel, 452 U. S., at 308.\r\n  At issue in Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, was the validity of the\r\nGun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which was a brief,\r\nsingle-subject statute making it a crime for an individual to\r\npossess a gun in a school zone. 104 Stat. 4844–4845, 18\r\nU. S. C. §922(q)(1)(A). The Act did not regulate any eco-\r\nnomic activity and did not contain any requirement that\r\nthe possession of a gun have any connection to past inter-\r\nstate activity or a predictable impact on future commercial\r\nactivity. Distinguishing our earlier cases holding that\r\ncomprehensive regulatory statutes may be validly applied\r\nto local conduct that does not, when viewed in isolation,\r\nhave a significant impact on interstate commerce, we held\r\n\f                  Cite as: 545 U.

We explained:\r\n    “Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms\r\n    has nothing to do with ‘commerce’ or any sort of eco-\r\n    nomic enterprise, however broadly one might define\r\n    those terms. Section 922(q) is not an essential part of\r\n    a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the\r\n    regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intra-\r\n    state activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be\r\n    sustained under our cases upholding regulations of\r\n    activities that arise out of or are connected with a\r\n    commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggre-\r\n    gate, substantially affects interstate commerce.” 514\r\n    U. S., at 561.\r\n   The statutory scheme that the Government is defending\r\nin this litigation is at the opposite end of the regulatory\r\nspectrum. As explained above, the CSA, enacted in 1970\r\nas part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and\r\nControl Act, 84 Stat. 1242–1284, was a lengthy and de-\r\ntailed statute creating a comprehensive framework for\r\nregulating the production, distribution, and possession of\r\nfive classes of “controlled substances.” Most of those\r\nsubstances—those listed in Schedules II through V—“have\r\na useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary\r\nto maintain the health and general welfare of the Ameri-\r\ncan people.” 21 U. S. C. §801(1). The regulatory scheme\r\nis designed to foster the beneficial use of those medica-\r\ntions, to prevent their misuse, and to prohibit entirely the\r\npossession or use of substances listed in Schedule I, except\r\nas a part of a strictly controlled research project.\r\n   While the statute provided for the periodic updating of\r\nthe five schedules, Congress itself made the initial classifi-\r\ncations. It identified 42 opiates, 22 opium derivatives, and\r\n17 hallucinogenic substances as Schedule I drugs. 84 Stat.\r\n1248. Marijuana was listed as the 10th item in the third\r\nsubcategory. That classification, unlike the discrete pro-\r\n\f22                       GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nhibition established by the Gun-Free School Zones Act of\r\n1990, was merely one of many “essential part[s] of a larger\r\nregulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory\r\nscheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity\r\nwere regulated.” Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561.34 Our opinion\r\nin Lopez casts no doubt on the validity of such a program.\r\n   Nor does this Court’s holding in Morrison, 529 U. S. 598.\r\nThe Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 1902,\r\ncreated a federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-\r\nmotivated crimes of violence. 42 U. S. C. §13981. The\r\nremedy was enforceable in both state and federal courts,\r\nand generally depended on proof of the violation of a state\r\nlaw. Despite congressional findings that such crimes had\r\nan adverse impact on interstate commerce, we held the\r\nstatute unconstitutional because, like the statute in Lopez,\r\nit did not regulate economic activity. We concluded that\r\n“the noneconomic, criminal nature of the conduct at issue\r\nwas central to our decision” in Lopez, and that our prior\r\ncases had identified a clear pattern of analysis: “ ‘Where\r\neconomic activity substantially affects interstate com-\r\nmerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sus-\r\ntained.’ ”35 Morrison, 529 U. S., at 610.\r\n   Unlike those at issue in Lopez and Morrison, the activi-\r\n——————\r\n  34 The principal dissent asserts that by “[s]eizing upon our language\r\nin Lopez,” post, at 5 (opinion of O’CONNOR, J.), i.e., giving effect to our\r\nwell-established case law, Congress will now have an incentive to\r\nlegislate broadly. Even putting aside the political checks that would\r\ngenerally curb Congress’ power to enact a broad and comprehensive\r\nscheme for the purpose of targeting purely local activity, there is no\r\nsuggestion that the CSA constitutes the type of “evasive” legislation the\r\ndissent fears, nor could such an argument plausibly be made. Post, at 6\r\n(O’CONNOR, J., dissenting).\r\n  35 Lopez, 514 U. S., at 560; see also id., at 573–574 (KENNEDY, J., con-\r\n\r\ncurring) (stating that Lopez did not alter our “practical conception of\r\ncommercial regulation” and that Congress may “regulate in the com-\r\nmercial sphere on the assumption that we have a single market and a\r\nunified purpose to build a stable national economy”).\r\n\f                     Cite as: 545 U.

The CSA is a statute\r\nthat regulates the production, distribution, and consump-\r\ntion of commodities for which there is an established, and\r\nlucrative, interstate market. Prohibiting the intrastate\r\npossession or manufacture of an article of commerce is a\r\nrational (and commonly utilized) means of regulating\r\ncommerce in that product.36 Such prohibitions include\r\nspecific decisions requiring that a drug be withdrawn from\r\nthe market as a result of the failure to comply with regula-\r\ntory requirements as well as decisions excluding Schedule\r\nI drugs entirely from the market. Because the CSA is a\r\nstatute that directly regulates economic, commercial\r\nactivity, our opinion in Morrison casts no doubt on its\r\nconstitutionality.\r\n   The Court of Appeals was able to conclude otherwise\r\nonly by isolating a “separate and distinct” class of activi-\r\nties that it held to be beyond the reach of federal power,\r\ndefined as “the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation,\r\npossession and use of marijuana for personal medical\r\npurposes on the advice of a physician and in accordance\r\nwith state law.” 352 F. 3d, at 1229. The court character-\r\nized this class as “different in kind from drug trafficking.”\r\nId., at 1228. The differences between the members of a\r\nclass so defined and the principal traffickers in Schedule I\r\nsubstances might be sufficient to justify a policy decision\r\nexempting the narrower class from the coverage of the\r\nCSA. The question, however, is whether Congress’ con-\r\ntrary policy judgment, i.e., its decision to include this\r\nnarrower “class of activities” within the larger regulatory\r\n——————\r\n  36 See 16 U. S. C. §668(a) (bald and golden eagles); 18 U. S. C. §175(a)\r\n\r\n(biological weapons); §831(a) (nuclear material); §842(n)(1) (certain\r\nplastic explosives); §2342(a) (contraband cigarettes).\r\n\f24                       GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nscheme, was constitutionally deficient. We have no diffi-\r\nculty concluding that Congress acted rationally in deter-\r\nmining that none of the characteristics making up the\r\npurported class, whether viewed individually or in the\r\naggregate, compelled an exemption from the CSA; rather,\r\nthe subdivided class of activities defined by the Court of\r\nAppeals was an essential part of the larger regulatory\r\nscheme.\r\n   First, the fact that marijuana is used “for personal\r\nmedical purposes on the advice of a physician” cannot\r\nitself serve as a distinguishing factor. 352 F. 3d, at 1229.\r\nThe CSA designates marijuana as contraband for any\r\npurpose; in fact, by characterizing marijuana as a Sched-\r\nule I drug, Congress expressly found that the drug has no\r\nacceptable medical uses. Moreover, the CSA is a compre-\r\nhensive regulatory regime specifically designed to regulate\r\nwhich controlled substances can be utilized for medicinal\r\npurposes, and in what manner. Indeed, most of the sub-\r\nstances classified in the CSA “have a useful and legitimate\r\nmedical purpose.” 21 U. S. C. §801(1). Thus, even if\r\nrespondents are correct that marijuana does have ac-\r\ncepted medical uses and thus should be redesignated as a\r\nlesser schedule drug,37 the CSA would still impose controls\r\n——————\r\n  37 We  acknowledge that evidence proffered by respondents in this case\r\nregarding the effective medical uses for marijuana, if found credible\r\nafter trial, would cast serious doubt on the accuracy of the findings that\r\nrequire marijuana to be listed in Schedule I. See, e.g., Institute of\r\nMedicine, Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base 179 (J.\r\nJoy, S. Watson, & J. Benson eds. 1999) (recognizing that “[s]cientific\r\ndata indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs,\r\nprimarily THC [Tetrahydrocannabinol] for pain relief, control of nausea\r\nand vomiting, and appetite stimulation”); see also Conant v. Walters,\r\n309 F. 3d 629, 640–643 (CA9 2002) (Kozinski, J., concurring) (chroni-\r\ncling medical studies recognizing valid medical uses for marijuana and\r\nits derivatives). But the possibility that the drug may be reclassified in\r\nthe future has no relevance to the question whether Congress now has\r\nthe power to regulate its production and distribution.

The CSA\r\nrequires manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, and\r\nother handlers of controlled substances to comply with\r\nstatutory and regulatory provisions mandating registra-\r\ntion with the DEA, compliance with specific production\r\nquotas, security controls to guard against diversion, re-\r\ncordkeeping and reporting obligations, and prescription\r\nrequirements. See 21 U. S. C. §§821–830; 21 CFR §1301 et\r\nseq. (2004). Furthermore, the dispensing of new drugs,\r\neven when doctors approve their use, must await federal\r\napproval. United States v. Rutherford, 442 U. S. 544\r\n(1979). Accordingly, the mere fact that marijuana—like\r\nvirtually every other controlled substance regulated by the\r\nCSA—is used for medicinal purposes cannot possibly serve\r\nto distinguish it from the core activities regulated by the\r\nCSA.\r\n   Nor can it serve as an “objective marke[r]” or “objective\r\nfacto[r]” to arbitrarily narrow the relevant class as the\r\ndissenters suggest, post, at 6 (O’CONNOR, J., dissenting);\r\npost, at 12 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). More fundamentally,\r\nif, as the principal dissent contends, the personal cultiva-\r\ntion, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal pur-\r\nposes is beyond the “ ‘outer limits’ of Congress’ Commerce\r\nClause authority,” post, at 1 (O’CONNOR, J., dissenting), it\r\nmust also be true that such personal use of marijuana (or\r\nany other homegrown drug) for recreational purposes is\r\nalso beyond those “ ‘outer limits,’ ” whether or not a State\r\nelects to authorize or even regulate such use. JUSTICE\r\nTHOMAS’ separate dissent suffers from the same sweeping\r\nimplications. That is, the dissenters’ rationale logically\r\nextends to place any federal regulation (including quality,\r\nprescription, or quantity controls) of any locally cultivated\r\nand possessed controlled substance for any purpose be-\r\n—————— \r\n\r\nsubmission, if accepted, would place all homegrown medical substances\r\n\r\nbeyond the reach of Congress’ regulatory jurisdiction. \r\n\r\n\f26                  GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nyond the “ ‘outer limits’ ” of Congress’ Commerce Clause\r\nauthority. One need not have a degree in economics to\r\nunderstand why a nationwide exemption for the vast\r\nquantity of marijuana (or other drugs) locally cultivated\r\nfor personal use (which presumably would include use by\r\nfriends, neighbors, and family members) may have a\r\nsubstantial impact on the interstate market for this ex-\r\ntraordinarily popular substance. The congressional judg-\r\nment that an exemption for such a significant segment of\r\nthe total market would undermine the orderly enforce-\r\nment of the entire regulatory scheme is entitled to a\r\nstrong presumption of validity. Indeed, that judgment is\r\nnot only rational, but “visible to the naked eye,” Lopez, 514\r\nU. S., at 563, under any commonsense appraisal of the\r\nprobable consequences of such an open-ended exemption.\r\n   Second, limiting the activity to marijuana possession\r\nand cultivation “in accordance with state law” cannot\r\nserve to place respondents’ activities beyond congressional\r\nreach. The Supremacy Clause unambiguously provides\r\nthat if there is any conflict between federal and state law,\r\nfederal law shall prevail. It is beyond peradventure that\r\nfederal power over commerce is “ ‘superior to that of the\r\nStates to provide for the welfare or necessities of their\r\ninhabitants,’ ” however legitimate or dire those necessities\r\nmay be. Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 196 (quoting Sanitary Dist. of\r\nChicago v. United States, 266 U. S. 405, 426 (1925)). See\r\nalso 392 U. S., at 195–196; Wickard, 317 U. S., at 124\r\n(“ ‘[N]o form of state activity can constitutionally thwart\r\nthe regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to\r\nCongress’ ”). Just as state acquiescence to federal regula-\r\ntion cannot expand the bounds of the Commerce Clause,\r\nsee, e.g., Morrison, 529 U. S., at 661–662 (BREYER, J.,\r\ndissenting) (noting that 38 States requested federal inter-\r\nvention), so too state action cannot circumscribe Congress’\r\nplenary commerce power. See United States v. Darby, 312\r\nU. S. 100, 114 (1941) (“That power can neither be enlarged\r\n\f                      Cite as: 545 U.

California’s decision\r\n(made 34 years after the CSA was enacted) to impose “stric[t] controls”\r\non the “cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes,”\r\npost, at 6 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), cannot retroactively divest Congress\r\nof its authority under the Commerce Clause. Indeed, JUSTICE THOMAS’\r\nurgings to the contrary would turn the Supremacy Clause on its head,\r\nand would resurrect limits on congressional power that have long since\r\nbeen rejected. See post, at 8 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)\r\n(quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 424 (1819)) (“ ‘To impose\r\non [Congress] the necessity of resorting to means which it cannot control,\r\nwhich another government may furnish or withhold, would render its\r\ncourse precarious, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a\r\ndependence on other governments, which might disappoint its most\r\nimportant designs, and is incompatible with the language of the constitu-\r\ntion’ ”).\r\n   Moreover, in addition to casting aside more than a century of this\r\nCourt’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence, it is noteworthy that JUSTICE\r\nTHOMAS’ suggestion that States possess the power to dictate the extent of\r\nCongress’ commerce power would have far-reaching implications beyond\r\nthe facts of this case. For example, under his reasoning, Congress would\r\nbe equally powerless to regulate, let alone prohibit, the intrastate\r\npossession, cultivation, and use of marijuana for recreational purposes,\r\nan activity which all States “strictly contro[l].” Indeed, his rationale\r\nseemingly would require Congress to cede its constitutional power to\r\nregulate commerce whenever a State opts to exercise its “traditional\r\npolice powers to define the criminal law and to protect the health,\r\nsafety, and welfare of their citizens.” Post, at 9–10 (dissenting opinion).\r\n\f28                        GONZALES v.

The exemption for\r\nphysicians provides them with an economic incentive to\r\ngrant their patients permission to use the drug. In contrast\r\nto most prescriptions for legal drugs, which limit the dosage\r\nand duration of the usage, under California law the doctor’s\r\npermission to recommend marijuana use is open-ended.\r\nThe authority to grant permission whenever the doctor\r\ndetermines that a patient is afflicted with “any other illness\r\nfor which marijuana provides relief,” Cal.

Indeed, several\r\ncities and counties have done just that.

I write separately\r\nbecause my understanding of the doctrinal foundation on\r\nwhich that holding rests is, if not inconsistent with that of\r\nthe Court, at least more nuanced.\r\n   Since Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971), our\r\ncases have mechanically recited that the Commerce\r\nClause permits congressional regulation of three catego-\r\nries: (1) the channels of interstate commerce; (2) the in-\r\nstrumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or\r\nthings in interstate commerce; and (3) activities that\r\n“substantially affect” interstate commerce. Id., at 150; see\r\nUnited States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 608–609 (2000);\r\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 558–559 (1995); Hodel\r\nv. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452\r\nU. S. 264, 276–277 (1981). The first two categories are self-\r\nevident, since they are the ingredients of interstate com-\r\nmerce itself. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189–190\r\n(1824). The third category, however, is different in kind,\r\nand its recitation without explanation is misleading and\r\nincomplete.\r\n   It is misleading because, unlike the channels, instru-\r\n\f2                        GONZALES v.

Rather, as this Court has acknowledged\r\nsince at least United States v. Coombs, 12 Pet. 72 (1838),\r\nCongress’s regulatory authority over intrastate activities\r\nthat are not themselves part of interstate commerce (in-\r\ncluding activities that have a substantial effect on inter-\r\nstate commerce) derives from the Necessary and Proper\r\nClause. Id., at 78; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294,\r\n301–302 (1964); United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315\r\nU. S. 110, 119 (1942); Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U.

S. 1,\r\n39–40 (1895) (Harlan, J., dissenting).1 And the category of\r\n“activities that substantially affect interstate commerce,”\r\nLopez, supra, at 559, is incomplete because the authority to\r\nenact laws necessary and proper for the regulation of\r\ninterstate commerce is not limited to laws governing\r\nintrastate activities that substantially affect interstate\r\ncommerce. Where necessary to make a regulation of\r\ninterstate commerce effective, Congress may regulate even\r\nthose intrastate activities that do not themselves substan-\r\ntially affect interstate commerce.\r\n                            I\r\n   Our cases show that the regulation of intrastate activi-\r\nties may be necessary to and proper for the regulation of\r\ninterstate commerce in two general circumstances.

See NLRB v. Jones & Laugh-\r\nlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 36–37 (1937). That is why the\r\nCourt has repeatedly sustained congressional legislation\r\non the ground that the regulated activities had a substan-\r\ntial effect on interstate commerce. See, e.g., Hodel, supra,\r\nat 281 (surface coal mining); Katzenbach, supra, at 300\r\n(discrimination by restaurants); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.\r\nv. United States, 379 U.

Olsen, 262 U. S. 1, 40\r\n(1923) (activities of a local grain exchange); Stafford v.\r\nWallace, 258 U. S. 495, 517, 524–525 (1922) (intrastate\r\ntransactions at stockyard). Lopez and Morrison recognized\r\nthe expansive scope of Congress’s authority in this regard:\r\n“[T]he pattern is clear. Where economic activity substan-\r\ntially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating\r\nthat activity will be sustained.” Lopez, supra, at 560;\r\nMorrison, supra, at 610 (same).\r\n   This principle is not without limitation. In Lopez and\r\nMorrison, the Court—conscious of the potential of the\r\n“substantially affects” test to “ ‘obliterate the distinction\r\nbetween what is national and what is local,’ ” Lopez, supra,\r\nat 566–567 (quoting A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.\r\nUnited States, 295 U. S. 495, 554 (1935)); see also Morrison,\r\nsupra, at 615–616—rejected the argument that Congress\r\nmay regulate noneconomic activity based solely on the\r\neffect that it may have on interstate commerce through a\r\nremote chain of inferences. Lopez, supra, at 564–566;\r\nMorrison, supra, at 617–618. “[I]f we were to accept [such]\r\narguments,” the Court reasoned in Lopez, “we are hard\r\npressed to posit any activity by an individual that Con-\r\ngress is without power to regulate.” Lopez, supra, at 564;\r\nsee also Morrison, supra, at 615–616. Thus, although\r\n\f4                       GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nCongress’s authority to regulate intrastate activity that\r\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce is broad, it does\r\nnot permit the Court to “pile inference upon inference,”\r\nLopez, supra, at 567, in order to establish that none-\r\nconomic activity has a substantial effect on interstate\r\ncommerce.\r\n  As we implicitly acknowledged in Lopez, however, Con-\r\ngress’s authority to enact laws necessary and proper for\r\nthe regulation of interstate commerce is not limited to\r\nlaws directed against economic activities that have a\r\nsubstantial effect on interstate commerce. Though the\r\nconduct in Lopez was not economic, the Court nevertheless\r\nrecognized that it could be regulated as “an essential part\r\nof a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the\r\nregulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate\r\nactivity were regulated.” 514 U. S., at 561. This state-\r\nment referred to those cases permitting the regulation of\r\nintrastate activities “which in a substantial way interfere\r\nwith or obstruct the exercise of the granted power.”\r\nWrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U. S., at 119; see also United\r\nStates v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 118–119 (1941); Shreveport\r\nRate Cases, 234 U. S., at 353. As the Court put it in\r\nWrightwood Dairy, where Congress has the authority to\r\nenact a regulation of interstate commerce, “it possesses\r\nevery power needed to make that regulation effective.”\r\n315 U. S., at 118–119.\r\n  Although this power “to make . . . regulation effective”\r\ncommonly overlaps with the authority to regulate eco-\r\nnomic activities that substantially affect interstate com-\r\nmerce,2 and may in some cases have been confused with\r\n——————\r\n  2 Wickard v.

The regulation of an\r\nintrastate activity may be essential to a comprehensive\r\nregulation of interstate commerce even though the intra-\r\nstate activity does not itself “substantially affect” inter-\r\nstate commerce. Moreover, as the passage from Lopez\r\nquoted above suggests, Congress may regulate even none-\r\nconomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part\r\nof a more general regulation of interstate commerce. See\r\nLopez, supra, at 561. The relevant question is simply\r\nwhether the means chosen are “reasonably adapted” to the\r\nattainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power.\r\nSee Darby, supra, at 121.\r\n  In Darby, for instance, the Court explained that “Con-\r\ngress, having . . . adopted the policy of excluding from\r\ninterstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce\r\nwhich do not conform to the specified labor standards,”\r\n312 U. S., at 121, could not only require employers en-\r\ngaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce\r\nto conform to wage and hour standards, id., at 119–121,\r\nbut could also require those employers to keep employ-\r\nment records in order to demonstrate compliance with the\r\nregulatory scheme, id., at 125. While the Court sustained\r\nthe former regulation on the alternative ground that the\r\nactivity it regulated could have a “great effect” on inter-\r\nstate commerce, id., at 122–123, it affirmed the latter on\r\nthe sole ground that “[t]he requirement for records even of\r\nthe intrastate transaction is an appropriate means to a\r\nlegitimate end,” id., at 125.\r\n  As the Court said in the Shreveport Rate Cases, the\r\nNecessary and Proper Clause does not give “Congress . . .\r\nthe authority to regulate the internal commerce of a State,\r\nas such,” but it does allow Congress “to take all measures\r\nnecessary or appropriate to” the effective regulation of the\r\n——————\r\nthat personal consumption of wheat had on interstate commerce,\r\njustified Congress’s regulation of that conduct. Id., at 128–129.\r\n\f6                    GONZALES v.

S., at 353; see also\r\nJones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S., at 38 (the logic of\r\nthe Shreveport Rate Cases is not limited to instrumentali-\r\nties of commerce).\r\n                              II\r\n   Today’s principal dissent objects that, by permitting\r\nCongress to regulate activities necessary to effective inter-\r\nstate regulation, the Court reduces Lopez and Morrison to\r\n“little more than a drafting guide.” Post, at 5 (opinion of\r\nO’CONNOR, J.). I think that criticism unjustified. Unlike\r\nthe power to regulate activities that have a substantial\r\neffect on interstate commerce, the power to enact laws\r\nenabling effective regulation of interstate commerce can\r\nonly be exercised in conjunction with congressional regula-\r\ntion of an interstate market, and it extends only to those\r\nmeasures necessary to make the interstate regulation\r\neffective. As Lopez itself states, and the Court affirms\r\ntoday, Congress may regulate noneconomic intrastate\r\nactivities only where the failure to do so “could . . . under-\r\ncut” its regulation of interstate commerce. See Lopez,\r\nsupra, at 561; ante, at 15, 21, 22. This is not a power that\r\nthreatens to obliterate the line between “what is truly\r\nnational and what is truly local.” Lopez, supra, at 567–\r\n568.\r\n   Lopez and Morrison affirm that Congress may not regu-\r\nlate certain “purely local” activity within the States based\r\nsolely on the attenuated effect that such activity may have\r\nin the interstate market. But those decisions do not de-\r\nclare noneconomic intrastate activities to be categorically\r\nbeyond the reach of the Federal Government. Neither\r\ncase involved the power of Congress to exert control over\r\nintrastate activities in connection with a more comprehen-\r\nsive scheme of regulation; Lopez expressly disclaimed that\r\nit was such a case, 514 U. S., at 561, and Morrison did not\r\n\f                  Cite as: 545 U.

See\r\nBrzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Inst., 169 F. 3d 820,\r\n834–835 (CA4 1999) (en banc).) To dismiss this distinction\r\nas “superficial and formalistic,” see post, at 6 (O’CONNOR,\r\nJ., dissenting), is to misunderstand the nature of the\r\nNecessary and Proper Clause, which empowers Congress\r\nto enact laws in effectuation of its enumerated powers that\r\nare not within its authority to enact in isolation. See\r\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421–422 (1819).\r\n   And there are other restraints upon the Necessary and\r\nProper Clause authority. As Chief Justice Marshall wrote\r\nin McCulloch v. Maryland, even when the end is constitu-\r\ntional and legitimate, the means must be “appropriate”\r\nand “plainly adapted” to that end. Id., at 421. Moreover,\r\nthey may not be otherwise “prohibited” and must be “con-\r\nsistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution.” Ibid.\r\nThese phrases are not merely hortatory. For example,\r\ncases such as Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898 (1997),\r\nand New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992),\r\naffirm that a law is not “ ‘proper for carrying into Execu-\r\ntion the Commerce Clause’ ” “[w]hen [it] violates [a consti-\r\ntutional] principle of state sovereignty.” Printz, supra, at\r\n923–924; see also New York, supra, at 166.\r\n                             III\r\n   The application of these principles to the case before us\r\nis straightforward. In the CSA, Congress has undertaken\r\nto extinguish the interstate market in Schedule I con-\r\ntrolled substances, including marijuana. The Commerce\r\nClause unquestionably permits this. The power to regu-\r\nlate interstate commerce “extends not only to those regu-\r\nlations which aid, foster and protect the commerce, but\r\nembraces those which prohibit it.” Darby, 312 U. S., at\r\n113. See also Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, 220 U. S.\r\n45, 58 (1911); Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 354 (1903). To\r\n\f8                        GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\neffectuate its objective, Congress has prohibited almost all\r\nintrastate activities related to Schedule I substances—\r\nboth economic activities (manufacture, distribution, pos-\r\nsession with the intent to distribute) and noneconomic\r\nactivities (simple possession). See 21 U. S. C. §§841(a),\r\n844(a). That simple possession is a noneconomic activity\r\nis immaterial to whether it can be prohibited as a neces-\r\nsary part of a larger regulation. Rather, Congress’s au-\r\nthority to enact all of these prohibitions of intrastate\r\ncontrolled-substance activities depends only upon whether\r\nthey are appropriate means of achieving the legitimate\r\nend of eradicating Schedule I substances from interstate\r\ncommerce.\r\n   By this measure, I think the regulation must be sus-\r\ntained. Not only is it impossible to distinguish “controlled\r\nsubstances manufactured and distributed intrastate” from\r\n“controlled substances manufactured and distributed\r\ninterstate,” but it hardly makes sense to speak in such\r\nterms. Drugs like marijuana are fungible commodities.\r\nAs the Court explains, marijuana that is grown at home\r\nand possessed for personal use is never more than an\r\ninstant from the interstate market—and this is so\r\nwhether or not the possession is for medicinal use or law-\r\nful use under the laws of a particular State.3 See ante, at\r\n——————\r\n  3 The principal dissent claims that, if this is sufficient to sustain the\r\n\r\nregulation at issue in this case, then it should also have been sufficient\r\nto sustain the regulation at issue in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.\r\n549 (1995). See post, at 11–12 (arguing that “we could have surmised\r\nin Lopez that guns in school zones are ‘never more than an instant from\r\nthe interstate market’ in guns already subject to federal regulation,\r\nrecast Lopez as a Necessary and Proper Clause case, and thereby\r\nupheld the Gun-Free School Zones Act”). This claim founders upon the\r\nshoals of Lopez itself, which made clear that the statute there at issue\r\nwas “not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity.”\r\nLopez, supra, at 561 (emphasis added). On the dissent’s view of things,\r\nthat statement is inexplicable. Of course it is in addition difficult to\r\nimagine what intelligible scheme of regulation of the interstate market\r\n\f                     Cite as: 545 U.

Congress need not accept on faith that state law\r\nwill be effective in maintaining a strict division between a\r\nlawful market for “medical” marijuana and the more\r\ngeneral marijuana market. See id., at 26–27, and n. 38.\r\n“To impose on [Congress] the necessity of resorting to\r\nmeans which it cannot control, which another government\r\nmay furnish or withhold, would render its course precari-\r\nous, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a\r\ndependence on other governments, which might disap-\r\npoint its most important designs, and is incompatible with\r\nthe language of the constitution.” McCulloch, supra, at\r\n424.\r\n   Finally, neither respondents nor the dissenters suggest\r\nany violation of state sovereignty of the sort that would\r\nrender this regulation “inappropriate,” id., at 421—except\r\nto argue that the CSA regulates an area typically left to\r\nstate regulation.     See post, at 6–7, 11 (opinion of\r\nO’CONNOR, J.); post, at 8–9 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); Brief\r\nfor Respondents 39–42. That is not enough to render\r\nfederal regulation an inappropriate means. The Court has\r\nrepeatedly recognized that, if authorized by the commerce\r\npower, Congress may regulate private endeavors “even\r\nwhen [that regulation] may pre-empt express state-law\r\ndeterminations contrary to the result which has com-\r\nmended itself to the collective wisdom of Congress.” Na-\r\ntional League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833, 840 (1976);\r\nsee Cleveland v. United States, 329 U. S. 14, 19 (1946);\r\n\r\n——————\r\nin guns could have as an appropriate means of effectuation the prohibi-\r\ntion of guns within 1000 feet of schools (and nowhere else). The dissent\r\npoints to a federal law, 18 U. S. C. §922(b)(1), barring licensed dealers\r\nfrom selling guns to minors, see post, at 12, but the relationship be-\r\ntween the regulatory scheme of which §922(b)(1) is a part (requiring all\r\ndealers in firearms that have traveled in interstate commerce to be\r\nlicensed, see §922(a)) and the statute at issue in Lopez approaches the\r\nnonexistent—which is doubtless why the Government did not attempt\r\nto justify the statute on the basis of that relationship.\r\n\f10                  GONZALES v.

At bottom, respondents’ state-\r\nsovereignty argument reduces to the contention that\r\nfederal regulation of the activities permitted by Califor-\r\nnia’s Compassionate Use Act is not sufficiently necessary\r\nto be “necessary and proper” to Congress’s regulation of\r\nthe interstate market. For the reasons given above and in\r\nthe Court’s opinion, I cannot agree.\r\n                        *     *     *\r\n  I thus agree with the Court that, however the class of\r\nregulated activities is subdivided, Congress could rea-\r\nsonably conclude that its objective of prohibiting mari-\r\njuana from the interstate market “could be undercut” if\r\nthose activities were excepted from its general scheme of\r\nregulation. See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561. That is sufficient\r\nto authorize the application of the CSA to respondents.\r\n\f                 Cite as: 545 U.

One of federalism’s chief virtues, of course, is that\r\nit promotes innovation by allowing for the possibility that\r\n“a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve\r\nas a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experi-\r\nments without risk to the rest of the country.” New State\r\nIce Co. v.

Today the Court\r\nsanctions an application of the federal Controlled Sub-\r\nstances Act that extinguishes that experiment, without\r\nany proof that the personal cultivation, possession, and\r\nuse of marijuana for medicinal purposes, if economic\r\nactivity in the first place, has a substantial effect on inter-\r\nstate commerce and is therefore an appropriate subject of\r\nfederal regulation. In so doing, the Court announces a\r\nrule that gives Congress a perverse incentive to legislate\r\nbroadly pursuant to the Commerce Clause—nestling\r\nquestionable assertions of its authority into comprehen-\r\nsive regulatory schemes—rather than with precision.\r\nThat rule and the result it produces in this case are irrec-\r\noncilable with our decisions in Lopez, supra, and United\r\nStates v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000). Accordingly I\r\ndissent.\r\n                              I\r\n    In Lopez, we considered the constitutionality of the Gun-\r\nFree School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a federal\r\noffense “for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm\r\n. . . at a place the individual knows, or has reasonable\r\ncause to believe, is a school zone,” 18 U. S. C.\r\n§922(q)(2)(A). We explained that “Congress’ commerce\r\nauthority includes the power to regulate those activities\r\nhaving a substantial relation to interstate commerce . . . ,\r\ni.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate\r\ncommerce.” 514 U. S., at 558–559 (citation omitted). This\r\npower derives from the conjunction of the Commerce\r\nClause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.

We held in\r\nLopez that the Gun-Free School Zones Act could not be\r\nsustained as an exercise of that power.\r\n   Our decision about whether gun possession in school\r\nzones substantially affected interstate commerce turned\r\non four considerations. Lopez, supra, at 559–567; see also\r\nMorrison, supra, at 609–613. First, we observed that our\r\n“substantial effects” cases generally have upheld federal\r\nregulation of economic activity that affected interstate\r\ncommerce, but that §922(q) was a criminal statute having\r\n“nothing to do with ‘commerce’ or any sort of economic\r\nenterprise.” Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561. In this regard, we\r\nalso noted that “[s]ection 922(q) is not an essential part of\r\na larger regulation of economic activity, in which the\r\nregulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate\r\nactivity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained\r\nunder our cases upholding regulations of activities that\r\narise out of or are connected with a commercial transac-\r\ntion, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects\r\ninterstate commerce.” Ibid. Second, we noted that the\r\nstatute contained no express jurisdictional requirement\r\nestablishing its connection to interstate commerce. Ibid.\r\n   Third, we found telling the absence of legislative find-\r\nings about the regulated conduct’s impact on interstate\r\ncommerce. We explained that while express legislative\r\nfindings are neither required nor, when provided, disposi-\r\ntive, findings “enable us to evaluate the legislative judg-\r\nment that the activity in question substantially affect[s]\r\ninterstate commerce, even though no such substantial\r\neffect [is] visible to the naked eye.” Id., at 563. Finally,\r\nwe rejected as too attenuated the Government’s argument\r\nthat firearm possession in school zones could result in\r\nviolent crime which in turn could adversely affect the\r\n\f4                  GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                   O’CONNOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nnational economy. Id., at 563–567. The Constitution, we\r\nsaid, does not tolerate reasoning that would “convert\r\ncongressional authority under the Commerce Clause to a\r\ngeneral police power of the sort retained by the States.”\r\nId., at 567. Later in Morrison, supra, we relied on the\r\nsame four considerations to hold that §40302 of the Vio-\r\nlence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U. S. C. §13981,\r\nexceeded Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause.\r\n  In my view, the case before us is materially indistin-\r\nguishable from Lopez and Morrison when the same con-\r\nsiderations are taken into account.\r\n                             II\r\n                             A\r\n  What is the relevant conduct subject to Commerce\r\nClause analysis in this case? The Court takes its cues\r\nfrom Congress, applying the above considerations to the\r\nactivity regulated by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)\r\nin general. The Court’s decision rests on two facts about\r\nthe CSA: (1) Congress chose to enact a single statute\r\nproviding a comprehensive prohibition on the production,\r\ndistribution, and possession of all controlled substances,\r\nand (2) Congress did not distinguish between various\r\nforms of intrastate noncommercial cultivation, possession,\r\nand use of marijuana. See 21 U. S. C. §§841(a)(1), 844(a).\r\nToday’s decision suggests that the federal regulation of\r\nlocal activity is immune to Commerce Clause challenge\r\nbecause Congress chose to act with an ambitious, all-\r\nencompassing statute, rather than piecemeal. In my view,\r\nallowing Congress to set the terms of the constitutional\r\ndebate in this way, i.e., by packaging regulation of local\r\nactivity in broader schemes, is tantamount to removing\r\nmeaningful limits on the Commerce Clause.\r\n  The Court’s principal means of distinguishing Lopez\r\nfrom this case is to observe that the Gun-Free School\r\nZones Act of 1990 was a “brief, single-subject statute,”\r\n\f                  Cite as: 545 U.

Seizing\r\nupon our language in Lopez that the statute prohibiting\r\ngun possession in school zones was “not an essential part\r\nof a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the\r\nregulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate\r\nactivity were regulated,” 514 U. S., at 561, the Court\r\nappears to reason that the placement of local activity in a\r\ncomprehensive scheme confirms that it is essential to that\r\nscheme. Ante, at 21–22. If the Court is right, then Lopez\r\nstands for nothing more than a drafting guide: Congress\r\nshould have described the relevant crime as “transfer or\r\npossession of a firearm anywhere in the nation”—thus\r\nincluding commercial and noncommercial activity, and\r\nclearly encompassing some activity with assuredly sub-\r\nstantial effect on interstate commerce. Had it done so, the\r\nmajority hints, we would have sustained its authority to\r\nregulate possession of firearms in school zones. Further-\r\nmore, today’s decision suggests we would readily sustain a\r\ncongressional decision to attach the regulation of intra-\r\nstate activity to a pre-existing comprehensive (or even not-\r\nso-comprehensive) scheme. If so, the Court invites in-\r\n\f6                    GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                    O’CONNOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncreased federal regulation of local activity even if, as it\r\nsuggests, Congress would not enact a new interstate\r\nscheme exclusively for the sake of reaching intrastate\r\nactivity, see ante, at 22, n. 33; ante, at 6 (SCALIA, J., con-\r\ncurring in judgment).\r\n   I cannot agree that our decision in Lopez contemplated\r\nsuch evasive or overbroad legislative strategies with ap-\r\nproval. Until today, such arguments have been made only\r\nin dissent. See Morrison, 529 U. S., at 657 (BREYER, J.,\r\ndissenting) (given that Congress can regulate “ ‘an essen-\r\ntial part of a larger regulation of economic activity,’ ” “can\r\nCongress save the present law by including it, or much of\r\nit, in a broader ‘Safe Transport’ or ‘Worker Safety’ act?”).\r\nLopez and Morrison did not indicate that the constitution-\r\nality of federal regulation depends on superficial and\r\nformalistic distinctions. Likewise I did not understand\r\nour discussion of the role of courts in enforcing outer limits\r\nof the Commerce Clause for the sake of maintaining the\r\nfederalist balance our Constitution requires, see Lopez,\r\n514 U. S., at 557; id., at 578 (KENNEDY, J., concurring), as\r\na signal to Congress to enact legislation that is more\r\nextensive and more intrusive into the domain of state\r\npower. If the Court always defers to Congress as it does\r\ntoday, little may be left to the notion of enumerated\r\npowers.\r\n   The hard work for courts, then, is to identify objective\r\nmarkers for confining the analysis in Commerce Clause\r\ncases. Here, respondents challenge the constitutionality of\r\nthe CSA as applied to them and those similarly situated. I\r\nagree with the Court that we must look beyond respon-\r\ndents’ own activities. Otherwise, individual litigants could\r\nalways exempt themselves from Commerce Clause regula-\r\ntion merely by pointing to the obvious—that their personal\r\nactivities do not have a substantial effect on interstate\r\ncommerce. See Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 193\r\n(1968); Wickard, 317 U. S., at 127–128. The task is to\r\n\f                 Cite as: 545 U.

The analysis may not\r\nbe the same in every case, for it depends on the regulatory\r\nscheme at issue and the federalism concerns implicated.\r\nSee generally Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567; id., at 579\r\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring).\r\n   A number of objective markers are available to confine\r\nthe scope of constitutional review here. Both federal and\r\nstate legislation—including the CSA itself, the California\r\nCompassionate Use Act, and other state medical mari-\r\njuana legislation—recognize that medical and nonmedical\r\n(i.e., recreational) uses of drugs are realistically distinct\r\nand can be segregated, and regulate them differently. See\r\n21 U. S. C. §812; Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann. §11362.5\r\n(West Supp. 2005); ante, at 1 (opinion of the Court). Re-\r\nspondents challenge only the application of the CSA to\r\nmedicinal use of marijuana. Cf. United States v. Raines,\r\n362 U. S. 17, 20–22 (1960) (describing our preference for\r\nas-applied rather than facial challenges). Moreover, be-\r\ncause fundamental structural concerns about dual sover-\r\neignty animate our Commerce Clause cases, it is relevant\r\nthat this case involves the interplay of federal and state\r\nregulation in areas of criminal law and social policy, where\r\n“States lay claim by right of history and expertise.” Lopez,\r\nsupra, at 583 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also Morri-\r\nson, supra, at 617–619; Lopez, supra, at 580 (KENNEDY, J.,\r\nconcurring) (“The statute before us upsets the federal\r\nbalance to a degree that renders it an unconstitutional\r\nassertion of the commerce power, and our intervention is\r\nrequired”); cf. Garcia, 469 U. S., at 586 (O’CONNOR, J.,\r\ndissenting) (“[S]tate autonomy is a relevant factor in\r\nassessing the means by which Congress exercises its\r\npowers” under the Commerce Clause). California, like\r\nother States, has drawn on its reserved powers to distin-\r\n\f8                    GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                    O’CONNOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nguish the regulation of medicinal marijuana. To ascertain\r\nwhether Congress’ encroachment is constitutionally justi-\r\nfied in this case, then, I would focus here on the personal\r\ncultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal\r\npurposes.\r\n                              B\r\n  Having thus defined the relevant conduct, we must\r\ndetermine whether, under our precedents, the conduct is\r\neconomic and, in the aggregate, substantially affects\r\ninterstate commerce. Even if intrastate cultivation and\r\npossession of marijuana for one’s own medicinal use can\r\nproperly be characterized as economic, and I question\r\nwhether it can, it has not been shown that such activity\r\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce. Similarly, it is\r\nneither self-evident nor demonstrated that regulating\r\nsuch activity is necessary to the interstate drug control\r\nscheme.\r\n  The Court’s definition of economic activity is breathtak-\r\ning. It defines as economic any activity involving the\r\nproduction, distribution, and consumption of commodities.\r\nAnd it appears to reason that when an interstate market\r\nfor a commodity exists, regulating the intrastate manufac-\r\nture or possession of that commodity is constitutional\r\neither because that intrastate activity is itself economic, or\r\nbecause regulating it is a rational part of regulating its\r\nmarket. Putting to one side the problem endemic to the\r\nCourt’s opinion—the shift in focus from the activity at\r\nissue in this case to the entirety of what the CSA regu-\r\nlates, see Lopez, supra, at 565 (“depending on the level of\r\ngenerality, any activity can be looked upon as commer-\r\ncial”)—the Court’s definition of economic activity for pur-\r\nposes of Commerce Clause jurisprudence threatens to\r\nsweep all of productive human activity into federal regula-\r\ntory reach.\r\n  The Court uses a dictionary definition of economics to\r\n\f                 Cite as: 545 U.

S., at 37. It will not do to say that\r\nCongress may regulate noncommercial activity simply\r\nbecause it may have an effect on the demand for commer-\r\ncial goods, or because the noncommercial endeavor can, in\r\nsome sense, substitute for commercial activity. Most\r\ncommercial goods or services have some sort of privately\r\nproducible analogue. Home care substitutes for daycare.\r\nCharades games substitute for movie tickets. Backyard or\r\nwindowsill gardening substitutes for going to the super-\r\nmarket. To draw the line wherever private activity affects\r\nthe demand for market goods is to draw no line at all, and\r\nto declare everything economic. We have already rejected\r\nthe result that would follow—a federal police power.\r\nLopez, supra, at 564.\r\n   In Lopez and Morrison, we suggested that economic\r\nactivity usually relates directly to commercial activity.\r\nSee Morrison, 529 U. S., at 611, n. 4 (intrastate activities\r\nthat have been within Congress’ power to regulate have\r\nbeen “of an apparent commercial character”); Lopez, 514\r\nU. S., at 561 (distinguishing the Gun-Free School Zones\r\nAct of 1990 from “activities that arise out of or are con-\r\nnected with a commercial transaction”). The homegrown\r\ncultivation and personal possession and use of marijuana\r\nfor medicinal purposes has no apparent commercial char-\r\nacter. Everyone agrees that the marijuana at issue in this\r\ncase was never in the stream of commerce, and neither\r\nwere the supplies for growing it. (Marijuana is highly\r\nunusual among the substances subject to the CSA in that\r\nit can be cultivated without any materials that have trav-\r\neled in interstate commerce.)

RAICH\r\n\r\n                   O’CONNOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nacquiring, buying, selling, or bartering a thing of value.\r\nCf. id., at 583 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (“The statute now\r\nbefore us forecloses the States from experimenting . . . and\r\nit does so by regulating an activity beyond the realm of\r\ncommerce in the ordinary and usual sense of that term”).\r\n   The Court suggests that Wickard, which we have identi-\r\nfied as “perhaps the most far reaching example of Com-\r\nmerce Clause authority over intrastate activity,” Lopez,\r\nsupra, at 560, established federal regulatory power over\r\nany home consumption of a commodity for which a na-\r\ntional market exists. I disagree. Wickard involved a\r\nchallenge to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938\r\n(AAA), which directed the Secretary of Agriculture to set\r\nnational quotas on wheat production, and penalties for\r\nexcess production. 317 U. S., at 115–116. The AAA itself\r\nconfirmed that Congress made an explicit choice not to\r\nreach—and thus the Court could not possibly have ap-\r\nproved of federal control over—small-scale, noncommercial\r\nwheat farming. In contrast to the CSA’s limitless asser-\r\ntion of power, Congress provided an exemption within the\r\nAAA for small producers. When Filburn planted the\r\nwheat at issue in Wickard, the statute exempted plantings\r\nless than 200 bushels (about six tons), and when he har-\r\nvested his wheat it exempted plantings less than six acres.\r\nId., at 130, n. 30. Wickard, then, did not extend Com-\r\nmerce Clause authority to something as modest as the\r\nhome cook’s herb garden. This is not to say that Congress\r\nmay never regulate small quantities of commodities pos-\r\nsessed or produced for personal use, or to deny that it\r\nsometimes needs to enact a zero tolerance regime for such\r\ncommodities. It is merely to say that Wickard did not hold\r\nor imply that small-scale production of commodities is\r\nalways economic, and automatically within Congress’\r\nreach.\r\n   Even assuming that economic activity is at issue in this\r\ncase, the Government has made no showing in fact that\r\n\f                 Cite as: 545 U.

Similarly, the Government\r\nhas not shown that regulating such activity is necessary to\r\nan interstate regulatory scheme. Whatever the specific\r\ntheory of “substantial effects” at issue (i.e., whether the\r\nactivity substantially affects interstate commerce,\r\nwhether its regulation is necessary to an interstate regu-\r\nlatory scheme, or both), a concern for dual sovereignty\r\nrequires that Congress’ excursion into the traditional\r\ndomain of States be justified.\r\n   That is why characterizing this as a case about the\r\nNecessary and Proper Clause does not change the analysis\r\nsignificantly. Congress must exercise its authority under\r\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause in a manner consistent\r\nwith basic constitutional principles. Garcia, 469 U. S., at\r\n585 (O’CONNOR, J., dissenting) (“It is not enough that the\r\n‘end be legitimate’; the means to that end chosen by Con-\r\ngress must not contravene the spirit of the Constitution”).\r\nAs JUSTICE SCALIA recognizes, see ante, at 7 (opinion\r\nconcurring in judgment), Congress cannot use its author-\r\nity under the Clause to contravene the principle of state\r\nsovereignty embodied in the Tenth Amendment. Ibid.\r\nLikewise, that authority must be used in a manner consis-\r\ntent with the notion of enumerated powers—a structural\r\nprinciple that is as much part of the Constitution as the\r\nTenth Amendment’s explicit textual command. Accord-\r\ningly, something more than mere assertion is required\r\nwhen Congress purports to have power over local activity\r\nwhose connection to an intrastate market is not self-\r\nevident. Otherwise, the Necessary and Proper Clause will\r\nalways be a back door for unconstitutional federal regula-\r\ntion. Cf. Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 923 (1997)\r\n(the Necessary and Proper Clause is “the last, best hope of\r\nthose who defend ultra vires congressional action”). In-\r\ndeed, if it were enough in “substantial effects” cases for\r\n\f12                   GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                    O’CONNOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe Court to supply conceivable justifications for intra-\r\nstate regulation related to an interstate market, then we\r\ncould have surmised in Lopez that guns in school zones\r\nare “never more than an instant from the interstate mar-\r\nket” in guns already subject to extensive federal regula-\r\ntion, ante, at 8 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), recast\r\nLopez as a Necessary and Proper Clause case, and thereby\r\nupheld the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. (According\r\nto the Court’s and the concurrence’s logic, for example, the\r\nLopez court should have reasoned that the prohibition on\r\ngun possession in school zones could be an appropriate\r\nmeans of effectuating a related prohibition on “sell[ing]” or\r\n“deliver[ing]” firearms or ammunition to “any individual\r\nwho the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe\r\nis less than eighteen years of age.” 18 U. S. C. §922(b)(1)\r\n(1988 ed., Supp. II).)\r\n   There is simply no evidence that homegrown medicinal\r\nmarijuana users constitute, in the aggregate, a sizable\r\nenough class to have a discernable, let alone substantial,\r\nimpact on the national illicit drug market—or otherwise to\r\nthreaten the CSA regime. Explicit evidence is helpful\r\nwhen substantial effect is not “visible to the naked eye.”\r\nSee Lopez, 514 U. S., at 563. And here, in part because\r\ncommon sense suggests that medical marijuana users may\r\nbe limited in number and that California’s Compassionate\r\nUse Act and similar state legislation may well isolate\r\nactivities relating to medicinal marijuana from the illicit\r\nmarket, the effect of those activities on interstate drug\r\ntraffic is not self-evidently substantial.\r\n   In this regard, again, this case is readily distinguishable\r\nfrom Wickard. To decide whether the Secretary could\r\nregulate local wheat farming, the Court looked to “the\r\nactual effects of the activity in question upon interstate\r\ncommerce.” 317 U. S., at 120. Critically, the Court was\r\nable to consider “actual effects” because the parties had\r\n“stipulated a summary of the economics of the wheat\r\n\f                 Cite as: 545 U.

After reviewing in detail the pic-\r\nture of the industry provided in that summary, the Court\r\nexplained that consumption of homegrown wheat was the\r\nmost variable factor in the size of the national wheat crop,\r\nand that on-site consumption could have the effect of\r\nvarying the amount of wheat sent to market by as much as\r\n20 percent. Id., at 127. With real numbers at hand, the\r\nWickard Court could easily conclude that “a factor of such\r\nvolume and variability as home-consumed wheat would\r\nhave a substantial influence on price and market condi-\r\ntions” nationwide. Id., at 128; see also id., at 128–129\r\n(“This record leaves us in no doubt” about substantial\r\neffects).\r\n   The Court recognizes that “the record in the Wickard\r\ncase itself established the causal connection between the\r\nproduction for local use and the national market” and\r\nargues that “we have before us findings by Congress to the\r\nsame effect.” Ante, at 17 (emphasis added). The Court\r\nrefers to a series of declarations in the introduction to the\r\nCSA saying that (1) local distribution and possession of\r\ncontrolled substances causes “swelling” in interstate traf-\r\nfic; (2) local production and distribution cannot be distin-\r\nguished from interstate production and distribution; (3)\r\nfederal control over intrastate incidents “is essential to\r\neffective control” over interstate drug trafficking. 21\r\nU. S. C. §§801(1)–(6). These bare declarations cannot be\r\ncompared to the record before the Court in Wickard.\r\n   They amount to nothing more than a legislative insis-\r\ntence that the regulation of controlled substances must be\r\nabsolute. They are asserted without any supporting evi-\r\ndence—descriptive, statistical, or otherwise. “[S]imply\r\nbecause Congress may conclude a particular activity sub-\r\nstantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily\r\nmake it so.” Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclama-\r\ntion Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 311 (1981) (REHNQUIST, J.,\r\nconcurring in judgment). Indeed, if declarations like these\r\n\f14                  GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                    O’CONNOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nsuffice to justify federal regulation, and if the Court today\r\nis right about what passes rationality review before us,\r\nthen our decision in Morrison should have come out the\r\nother way. In that case, Congress had supplied numerous\r\nfindings regarding the impact gender-motivated violence\r\nhad on the national economy. 529 U. S., at 614; id., at\r\n628–636 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (chronicling findings).\r\nBut, recognizing that “ ‘ “[w]hether particular operations\r\naffect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the\r\nconstitutional power of Congress to regulate them is ulti-\r\nmately a judicial rather than a legislative question,” ’ ” we\r\nfound Congress’ detailed findings inadequate. Id., at 614\r\n(quoting Lopez, supra, at 557, n. 2, in turn quoting Heart\r\nof Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 273\r\n(1964) (Black, J., concurring)). If, as the Court claims,\r\ntoday’s decision does not break with precedent, how can it\r\nbe that voluminous findings, documenting extensive hear-\r\nings about the specific topic of violence against women, did\r\nnot pass constitutional muster in Morrison, while the\r\nCSA’s abstract, unsubstantiated, generalized findings\r\nabout controlled substances do?\r\n   In particular, the CSA’s introductory declarations are\r\ntoo vague and unspecific to demonstrate that the federal\r\nstatutory scheme will be undermined if Congress cannot\r\nexert power over individuals like respondents. The decla-\r\nrations are not even specific to marijuana. (Facts about\r\nsubstantial effects may be developed in litigation to com-\r\npensate for the inadequacy of Congress’ findings; in part\r\nbecause this case comes to us from the grant of a prelimi-\r\nnary injunction, there has been no such development.)\r\nBecause here California, like other States, has carved out\r\na limited class of activity for distinct regulation, the in-\r\nadequacy of the CSA’s findings is especially glaring. The\r\nCalifornia Compassionate Use Act exempts from other\r\nstate drug laws patients and their caregivers “who pos-\r\nses[s] or cultivat[e] marijuana for the personal medical\r\n\f                 Cite as: 545 U.

Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§11362.5(d),\r\n11362.7(h) (West Supp. 2005) (emphasis added). Compare\r\nibid. with, e.g., §11357(b) (West 1991) (criminalizing mari-\r\njuana possession in excess of 28.5 grams); §11358 (crimi-\r\nnalizing marijuana cultivation). The Act specifies that it\r\nshould not be construed to supersede legislation prohibit-\r\ning persons from engaging in acts dangerous to others, or\r\nto condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical\r\npurposes. §11362.5(b)(2) (West Supp. 2005). To promote\r\nthe Act’s operation and to facilitate law enforcement,\r\nCalifornia recently enacted an identification card system\r\nfor qualified patients. §§11362.7–11362.83. We generally\r\nassume States enforce their laws, see Riley v. National\r\nFederation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 795\r\n(1988), and have no reason to think otherwise here.\r\n   The Government has not overcome empirical doubt that\r\nthe number of Californians engaged in personal cultiva-\r\ntion, possession, and use of medical marijuana, or the\r\namount of marijuana they produce, is enough to threaten\r\nthe federal regime. Nor has it shown that Compassionate\r\nUse Act marijuana users have been or are realistically\r\nlikely to be responsible for the drug’s seeping into the\r\nmarket in a significant way. The Government does cite\r\none estimate that there were over 100,000 Compassionate\r\nUse Act users in California in 2004, Reply Brief for Peti-\r\ntioners 16, but does not explain, in terms of proportions,\r\nwhat their presence means for the national illicit drug\r\nmarket. See generally Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 196, n. 27\r\n(Congress cannot use “a relatively trivial impact on com-\r\nmerce as an excuse for broad general regulation of state or\r\nprivate activities”); cf.

It also provides anecdotal\r\nevidence about the CSA’s enforcement. See Reply Brief for\r\nPetitioners 17–18. The Court also offers some arguments\r\nabout the effect of the Compassionate Use Act on the\r\nnational market. It says that the California statute might\r\nbe vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous physicians,\r\nthat Compassionate Use Act patients may overproduce,\r\nand that the history of the narcotics trade shows the diffi-\r\nculty of cordoning off any drug use from the rest of the\r\nmarket. These arguments are plausible; if borne out in\r\nfact they could justify prosecuting Compassionate Use Act\r\npatients under the federal CSA. But, without substantia-\r\ntion, they add little to the CSA’s conclusory statements\r\nabout diversion, essentiality, and market effect. Piling\r\nassertion upon assertion does not, in my view, satisfy the\r\nsubstantiality test of Lopez and Morrison.\r\n                             III\r\n  We would do well to recall how James Madison, the\r\nfather of the Constitution, described our system of joint\r\nsovereignty to the people of New York: “The powers dele-\r\ngated by the proposed constitution to the federal govern-\r\nment are few and defined.

If Congress\r\ncan regulate this under the Commerce Clause, then it can\r\nregulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government\r\nis no longer one of limited and enumerated powers.\r\n                               I\r\n   Respondents’ local cultivation and consumption of mari-\r\njuana is not “Commerce . . . among the several States.”\r\nU. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 3. By holding that Congress\r\nmay regulate activity that is neither interstate nor com-\r\nmerce under the Interstate Commerce Clause, the Court\r\nabandons any attempt to enforce the Constitution’s limits\r\non federal power. The majority supports this conclusion\r\nby invoking, without explanation, the Necessary and\r\nProper Clause. Regulating respondents’ conduct, however,\r\nis not “necessary and proper for carrying into Execution”\r\nCongress’ restrictions on the interstate drug trade. Art. I,\r\n§8, cl. 18. Thus, neither the Commerce Clause nor the\r\nNecessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power\r\nto regulate respondents’ conduct.\r\n\f2                   GONZALES v.

S. 549 (1995), the Commerce Clause empowers Con-\r\ngress to regulate the buying and selling of goods and\r\nservices trafficked across state lines. Id., at 586–589\r\n(concurring opinion). The Clause’s text, structure, and\r\nhistory all indicate that, at the time of the founding, the\r\nterm “ ‘commerce’ consisted of selling, buying, and barter-\r\ning, as well as transporting for these purposes.” Id., at\r\n585 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Commerce, or trade, stood\r\nin contrast to productive activities like manufacturing and\r\nagriculture. Id., at 586–587 (THOMAS, J., concurring).\r\nThroughout founding-era dictionaries, Madison’s notes\r\nfrom the Constitutional Convention, The Federalist Pa-\r\npers, and the ratification debates, the term “commerce” is\r\nconsistently used to mean trade or exchange—not all\r\neconomic or gainful activity that has some attenuated\r\nconnection to trade or exchange. Ibid. (THOMAS, J., con-\r\ncurring); Barnett, The Original Meaning of the Commerce\r\nClause, 68 U. Chi. L. Rev. 101, 112–125 (2001). The term\r\n“commerce” commonly meant trade or exchange (and\r\nshipping for these purposes) not simply to those involved\r\nin the drafting and ratification processes, but also to the\r\ngeneral public. Barnett, New Evidence of the Original\r\nMeaning of the Commerce Clause, 55 Ark. L. Rev. 847,\r\n857–862 (2003).\r\n  Even the majority does not argue that respondents’ con-\r\nduct is itself “Commerce among the several States.” Art. I,\r\n§8, cl. 3. Ante, at 19. Monson and Raich neither buy nor\r\nsell the marijuana that they consume. They cultivate\r\ntheir cannabis entirely in the State of California—it never\r\ncrosses state lines, much less as part of a commercial\r\ntransaction. Certainly no evidence from the founding\r\nsuggests that “commerce” included the mere possession of\r\na good or some purely personal activity that did not in-\r\nvolve trade or exchange for value.

S. C. §801 et seq.,\r\nregulates a great deal of marijuana trafficking that is\r\ninterstate and commercial in character. The CSA does\r\nnot, however, criminalize only the interstate buying and\r\nselling of marijuana. Instead, it bans the entire market—\r\nintrastate or interstate, noncommercial or commercial—\r\nfor marijuana. Respondents are correct that the CSA\r\nexceeds Congress’ commerce power as applied to their\r\nconduct, which is purely intrastate and noncommercial.\r\n                              B\r\n  More difficult, however, is whether the CSA is a valid\r\nexercise of Congress’ power to enact laws that are “neces-\r\nsary and proper for carrying into Execution” its power to\r\nregulate interstate commerce. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. The Neces-\r\nsary and Proper Clause is not a warrant to Congress to\r\nenact any law that bears some conceivable connection to the\r\nexercise of an enumerated power.1 Nor is it, however, a\r\ncommand to Congress to enact only laws that are absolutely\r\nindispensable to the exercise of an enumerated power.2\r\n  In McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), this\r\nCourt, speaking through Chief Justice Marshall, set forth\r\na test for determining when an Act of Congress is permis-\r\nsible under the Necessary and Proper Clause:\r\n——————\r\n   1 McCulloch v.

It must be “plainly\r\nadapted” to regulating interstate marijuana trafficking—\r\nin other words, there must be an “obvious, simple, and\r\ndirect relation” between the intrastate ban and the regula-\r\ntion of interstate commerce.

Unregulated\r\nlocal growers and users could swell both the supply and\r\nthe demand sides of the interstate marijuana market,\r\nmaking the market more difficult to regulate. Ante, at 9–\r\n10, 19 (majority opinion). But respondents do not chal-\r\nlenge the CSA on its face. Instead, they challenge it as\r\napplied to their conduct. The question is thus whether the\r\nintrastate ban is “necessary and proper” as applied to\r\nmedical marijuana users like respondents.3\r\n    Respondents are not regulable simply because they\r\nbelong to a large class (local growers and users of mari-\r\njuana) that Congress might need to reach, if they also\r\nbelong to a distinct and separable subclass (local growers\r\nand users of state-authorized, medical marijuana) that\r\ndoes not undermine the CSA’s interstate ban. Ante, at 6–7\r\n(O’CONNOR, J., dissenting). The Court of Appeals found\r\nthat respondents’ “limited use is distinct from the broader\r\nillicit drug market,” because “th[eir] medicinal marijuana\r\n. . . is not intended for, nor does it enter, the stream of\r\ncommerce.” Raich v. Ashcroft, 352 F. 3d 1222, 1228 (CA9\r\n2003). If that is generally true of individuals who grow\r\nand use marijuana for medical purposes under state law,\r\nthen even assuming Congress has “obvious” and “plain”\r\nreasons why regulating intrastate cultivation and posses-\r\nsion is necessary to regulating the interstate drug trade,\r\nnone of those reasons applies to medical marijuana pa-\r\ntients like Monson and Raich.\r\n——————\r\n  3 Because respondents do not challenge on its face the CSA’s ban on\r\n\r\nmarijuana, 21 U. S. C. §§841(a)(1), 844(a), our adjudication of their as-\r\napplied challenge casts no doubt on this Court’s practice in United\r\nStates v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and United States v. Morrison, 529\r\nU. S. 598 (2000). In those cases, we held that Congress, in enacting the\r\nstatutes at issue, had exceeded its Article I powers.\r\n\f6                       GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   California’s Compassionate Use Act sets respondents’\r\nconduct apart from other intrastate producers and users of\r\nmarijuana. The Act channels marijuana use to “seriously\r\nill Californians,” Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann.\r\n§11362.5(b)(1)(A) (West Supp. 2005), and prohibits “the\r\ndiversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes,”\r\n§11362.5(b)(2).4 California strictly controls the cultivation\r\nand possession of marijuana for medical purposes. To be\r\neligible for its program, California requires that a patient\r\nhave an illness that cannabis can relieve, such as cancer,\r\nAIDS, or arthritis, §11362.5(b)(1)(A), and that he obtain a\r\nphysician’s recommendation or approval, §11362.5(d).\r\nQualified patients must provide personal and medical\r\ninformation to obtain medical identification cards, and\r\nthere is a statewide registry of cardholders. §§11362.715–\r\n.76. Moreover, the Medical Board of California has issued\r\nguidelines for physicians’ cannabis recommendations, and\r\nit sanctions physicians who do not comply with the guide-\r\nlines. See, e.g., People v. Spark, 121 Cal. App. 4th 259,\r\n263, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 840, 843 (2004).\r\n   This class of intrastate users is therefore distinguish-\r\nable from others. We normally presume that States en-\r\nforce their own laws, Riley v. National Federation of Blind\r\nof N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 795 (1988), and there is no\r\nreason to depart from that presumption here: Nothing\r\nsuggests that California’s controls are ineffective. The scant\r\nevidence that exists suggests that few people—the vast\r\nmajority of whom are aged 40 or older—register to use\r\nmedical marijuana.

In part because of the low\r\nincidence of medical marijuana use, many law enforce-\r\nment officials report that the introduction of medical\r\nmarijuana laws has not affected their law enforcement\r\nefforts. Id., at 32.\r\n   These controls belie the Government’s assertion that\r\nplacing medical marijuana outside the CSA’s reach “would\r\nprevent effective enforcement of the interstate ban on\r\ndrug trafficking.” Brief for Petitioners 33. Enforcement of\r\nthe CSA can continue as it did prior to the Compassionate\r\nUse Act. Only now, a qualified patient could avoid arrest\r\nor prosecution by presenting his identification card to law\r\nenforcement officers. In the event that a qualified patient\r\nis arrested for possession or his cannabis is seized, he\r\ncould seek to prove as an affirmative defense that, in\r\nconformity with state law, he possessed or cultivated small\r\nquantities of marijuana intrastate solely for personal\r\nmedical use. People v. Mower, 28 Cal. 4th 457, 469–470,\r\n49 P. 3d 1067, 1073–1075 (2002); People v. Trippet, 56 Cal.\r\nApp. 4th 1532, 1549 (1997). Moreover, under the CSA,\r\ncertain drugs that present a high risk of abuse and addic-\r\ntion but that nevertheless have an accepted medical use—\r\ndrugs like morphine and amphetamines—are available by\r\nprescription.     21 U. S. C. §§812(b)(2)(A)–(B); 21 CFR\r\n§1308.12 (2004). No one argues that permitting use of\r\nthese drugs under medical supervision has undermined\r\nthe CSA’s restrictions.\r\n   But even assuming that States’ controls allow some\r\nseepage of medical marijuana into the illicit drug market,\r\nthere is a multibillion-dollar interstate market for mari-\r\njuana.

It believed the across-\r\nthe-board ban essential to policing interstate drug traffick-\r\ning. 21 U. S. C. §801(6). But as JUSTICE O’CONNOR points\r\nout, Congress presented no evidence in support of its\r\nconclusions, which are not so much findings of fact as\r\nassertions of power. Ante, at 13–14 (dissenting opinion).\r\nCongress cannot define the scope of its own power merely\r\nby declaring the necessity of its enactments.\r\n  In sum, neither in enacting the CSA nor in defending its\r\napplication to respondents has the Government offered\r\nany obvious reason why banning medical marijuana use is\r\nnecessary to stem the tide of interstate drug trafficking.\r\nCongress’ goal of curtailing the interstate drug trade\r\nwould not plainly be thwarted if it could not apply the\r\nCSA to patients like Monson and Raich. That is, unless\r\nCongress’ aim is really to exercise police power of the sort\r\nreserved to the States in order to eliminate even the intra-\r\nstate possession and use of marijuana.\r\n                               2\r\n   Even assuming the CSA’s ban on locally cultivated and\r\nconsumed marijuana is “necessary,” that does not mean it\r\nis also “proper.” The means selected by Congress to regu-\r\nlate interstate commerce cannot be “prohibited” by, or\r\ninconsistent with the “letter and spirit” of, the Constitution.\r\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421.\r\n   In Lopez, I argued that allowing Congress to regulate\r\nintrastate, noncommercial activity under the Commerce\r\nClause would confer on Congress a general “police power”\r\nover the Nation. 514 U.

If the Federal Government can regulate\r\ngrowing a half-dozen cannabis plants for personal con-\r\nsumption (not because it is interstate commerce, but\r\nbecause it is inextricably bound up with interstate com-\r\nmerce), then Congress’ Article I powers—as expanded by\r\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause—have no meaningful\r\nlimits.

Further, the Government’s rationale—that\r\nit may regulate the production or possession of any commod-\r\nity for which there is an interstate market—threatens to\r\nremove the remaining vestiges of States’ traditional police\r\npowers. See Brief for Petitioners 21–22; cf. Ehrlich, The\r\nIncreasing Federalization of Crime, 32 Ariz. St. L.

According to Hamilton, the Clause was needed only “to guard\r\nagainst cavilling refinements” by those seeking to cripple federal power.\r\nThe Federalist No. 33, at 205; id., No. 44, at 303–304 (J.

JUSTICE O’CONNOR ex-\r\nplains why the majority’s reasons cannot be reconciled\r\nwith our recent Commerce Clause jurisprudence. The\r\nmajority’s justifications, however, suffer from even more\r\nfundamental flaws.\r\n                               A\r\n  The majority holds that Congress may regulate intra-\r\nstate cultivation and possession of medical marijuana\r\nunder the Commerce Clause, because such conduct argua-\r\nbly has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The\r\nmajority’s decision is further proof that the “substantial\r\neffects” test is a “rootless and malleable standard” at odds\r\nwith the constitutional design. Morrison, supra, at 627\r\n(THOMAS, J., concurring).\r\n  The majority’s treatment of the substantial effects test\r\nis rootless, because it is not tethered to either the Com-\r\nmerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause. Under\r\nthe Commerce Clause, Congress may regulate interstate\r\ncommerce, not activities that substantially affect inter-\r\nstate commerce—any more than Congress may regulate\r\nactivities that do not fall within, but that affect, the sub-\r\njects of its other Article I powers. Lopez, supra, at 589\r\n(THOMAS, J., concurring). Whatever additional latitude\r\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause affords, supra, at 9–10,\r\nthe question is whether Congress’ legislation is essential\r\nto the regulation of interstate commerce itself—not\r\nwhether the legislation extends only to economic activities\r\nthat substantially affect interstate commerce. Supra, at 4;\r\nante, at 5 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).\r\n  The majority’s treatment of the substantial effects test\r\nis malleable, because the majority expands the relevant\r\nconduct. By defining the class at a high level of generality\r\n(as the intrastate manufacture and possession of mari-\r\njuana), the majority overlooks that individuals authorized\r\n\f12                       GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nby state law to manufacture and possess medical mari-\r\njuana exert no demonstrable effect on the interstate drug\r\nmarket. Supra, at 7–8. The majority ignores that\r\nwhether a particular activity substantially affects inter-\r\nstate commerce—and thus comes within Congress’ reach\r\non the majority’s approach—can turn on a number of\r\nobjective factors, like state action or features of the regu-\r\nlated activity itself. Ante, at 6–7 (O’CONNOR, J., dissent-\r\ning). For instance, here, if California and other States are\r\neffectively regulating medical marijuana users, then these\r\nusers have little effect on the interstate drug trade.6\r\n   The substantial effects test is easily manipulated for\r\nanother reason. This Court has never held that Congress\r\ncan regulate noneconomic activity that substantially\r\naffects interstate commerce. Morrison, 529 U. S., at 613\r\n(“[T]hus far in our Nation’s history our cases have upheld\r\nCommerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only\r\nwhere that activity is economic in nature” (emphasis\r\nadded)); Lopez, supra, at 560. To evade even that modest\r\n——————\r\n   6 Remarkably, the majority goes so far as to declare this question\r\n\r\nirrelevant. It asserts that the CSA is constitutional even if California’s\r\ncurrent controls are effective, because state action can neither expand\r\nnor contract Congress’ powers. Ante, at 27, n. 38. The majority’s\r\nassertion is misleading. Regardless of state action, Congress has the\r\npower to regulate intrastate economic activities that substantially\r\naffect interstate commerce (on the majority’s view) or activities that are\r\nnecessary and proper to effectuating its commerce power (on my view).\r\nBut on either approach, whether an intrastate activity falls within the\r\nscope of Congress’ powers turns on factors that the majority is unwill-\r\ning to confront. The majority apparently believes that even if States\r\nprevented any medical marijuana from entering the illicit drug market,\r\nand thus even if there were no need for the CSA to govern medical\r\nmarijuana users, we should uphold the CSA under the Commerce\r\nClause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Finally, to invoke the\r\nSupremacy Clause, as the majority does, ibid., is to beg the question.\r\nThe CSA displaces California’s Compassionate Use Act if the CSA is\r\nconstitutional as applied to respondents’ conduct, but that is the very\r\nquestion at issue.\r\n\f                       Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                       13\r\n\r\n                           THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nrestriction on federal power, the majority defines economic\r\nactivity in the broadest possible terms as the “ ‘the produc-\r\ntion, distribution, and consumption of commodities.’ ”7\r\nAnte, at 23 (quoting Webster’s Third New International\r\nDictionary 720 (1966) (hereinafter Webster’s 3d). This\r\ncarves out a vast swath of activities that are subject to\r\nfederal regulation. See ante, at 8–9 (O’CONNOR, J., dis-\r\nsenting). If the majority is to be taken seriously, the\r\nFederal Government may now regulate quilting bees,\r\nclothes drives, and potluck suppers throughout the 50\r\nStates. This makes a mockery of Madison’s assurance to\r\nthe people of New York that the “powers delegated” to the\r\nFederal Government are “few and defined,” while those of\r\nthe States are “numerous and indefinite.” The Federalist\r\nNo. 45, at 313 (J. Madison).\r\n   Moreover, even a Court interested more in the modern\r\nthan the original understanding of the Constitution ought\r\nto resolve cases based on the meaning of words that are\r\nactually in the document. Congress is authorized to regu-\r\nlate “Commerce,” and respondents’ conduct does not qual-\r\nify under any definition of that term.8 The majority’s\r\nopinion only illustrates the steady drift away from the text\r\nof the Commerce Clause. There is an inexorable expan-\r\n——————\r\n  7 Other    dictionaries do not define the term “economic” as broadly as\r\nthe majority does. See, e.g., The American Heritage Dictionary of the\r\nEnglish Language 583 (3d ed. 1992) (defining “economic” as “[o]f or\r\nrelating to the production, development, and management of material\r\nwealth, as of a country, household, or business enterprise” (emphasis\r\nadded)). The majority does not explain why it selects a remarkably\r\nexpansive 40-year-old definition.\r\n    8 See, e.g., id., at 380 (“[t]he buying and selling of goods, especially on\r\n\r\na large scale, as between cities or nations”); The Random House Dic-\r\ntionary of the English Language 411 (2d ed. 1987) (“an interchange of\r\ngoods or commodities, esp. on a large scale between different countries\r\n. . . or between different parts of the same country”); Webster’s 3d 456\r\n(“the exchange or buying and selling of commodities esp. on a large\r\nscale and involving transportation from place to place”).\r\n\f14                  GONZALES v.

Federal power expands, but never contracts,\r\nwith each new locution. The majority is not interpreting\r\nthe Commerce Clause, but rewriting it.\r\n   The majority’s rewriting of the Commerce Clause seems\r\nto be rooted in the belief that, unless the Commerce\r\nClause covers the entire web of human activity, Congress\r\nwill be left powerless to regulate the national economy\r\neffectively. Ante, at 15–16; Lopez, 514 U. S., at 573–574\r\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). The interconnectedness of\r\neconomic activity is not a modern phenomenon unfamiliar\r\nto the Framers. Id., at 590–593 (THOMAS, J., concurring);\r\nLetter from J. Madison to S. Roane (Sept. 2, 1819), in 3\r\nThe Founders’ Constitution 259–260 (P. Kurland & R.\r\nLerner eds. 1987). Moreover, the Framers understood\r\nwhat the majority does not appear to fully appreciate:\r\nThere is a danger to concentrating too much, as well as too\r\nlittle, power in the Federal Government. This Court has\r\ncarefully avoided stripping Congress of its ability to regu-\r\nlate interstate commerce, but it has casually allowed the\r\nFederal Government to strip States of their ability to\r\nregulate intrastate commerce—not to mention a host of\r\nlocal activities, like mere drug possession, that are not\r\ncommercial.\r\n   One searches the Court’s opinion in vain for any hint of\r\nwhat aspect of American life is reserved to the States. Yet\r\nthis Court knows that “ ‘[t]he Constitution created a Fed-\r\neral Government of limited powers.’ ” New York v. United\r\nStates, 505 U. S. 144, 155 (1992) (quoting Gregory v.\r\nAshcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457 (1991)).

If stability is possible, it is only\r\nby discarding the stand-alone substantial effects test and\r\nrevisiting our definition of “Commerce among the several\r\nStates.” Congress may regulate interstate commerce—not\r\nthings that affect it, even when summed together, unless\r\ntruly “necessary and proper” to regulating interstate\r\ncommerce.\r\n                              B\r\n  The majority also inconsistently contends that regulat-\r\ning respondents’ conduct is both incidental and essential\r\nto a comprehensive legislative scheme. Ante, at 19–20,\r\n21–22. I have already explained why the CSA’s ban on\r\nlocal activity is not essential. Supra, at 7–8. However,\r\nthe majority further claims that, because the CSA covers a\r\ngreat deal of interstate commerce, it “is of no moment” if it\r\nalso “ensnares some purely intrastate activity.” Ante, at\r\n19. So long as Congress casts its net broadly over an\r\ninterstate market, according to the majority, it is free to\r\nregulate interstate and intrastate activity alike. This\r\ncannot be justified under either the Commerce Clause or\r\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause. If the activity is purely\r\nintrastate, then it may not be regulated under the Com-\r\nmerce Clause. And if the regulation of the intrastate\r\nactivity is purely incidental, then it may not be regulated\r\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause.\r\n  Nevertheless, the majority terms this the “pivotal”\r\ndistinction between the present case and Lopez and Morri-\r\nson. Ante, at 20. In Lopez and Morrison, the parties\r\nasserted facial challenges, claiming “that a particular\r\nstatute or provision fell outside Congress’ commerce power\r\nin its entirety.” Ante, at 20. Here, by contrast, respon-\r\ndents claim only that the CSA falls outside Congress’\r\ncommerce power as applied to their individual conduct.\r\nAccording to the majority, while courts may set aside\r\nwhole statutes or provisions, they may not “excise individ-\r\n\f16                    GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.”\r\nAnte, at 20–21; see also Perez v. United States, 402 U. S.\r\n146, 154 (1971); Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 192–193\r\n(1968).\r\n   It is true that if respondents’ conduct is part of a “class of\r\nactivities . . . and that class is within the reach of federal\r\npower,” Perez, supra, at 154 (emphases deleted), then\r\nrespondents may not point to the de minimis effect of their\r\nown personal conduct on the interstate drug market,\r\nWirtz, supra, at 196, n. 27. Ante, at 6 (O’CONNOR, J.,\r\ndissenting). But that begs the question at issue: whether\r\nrespondents’ “class of activities” is “within the reach of\r\nfederal power,” which depends in turn on whether the\r\nclass is defined at a low or a high level of generality.\r\nSupra, at 5. If medical marijuana patients like Monson\r\nand Raich largely stand outside the interstate drug mar-\r\nket, then courts must excise them from the CSA’s cover-\r\nage. Congress expressly provided that if “a provision [of\r\nthe CSA] is held invalid in one of more of its applications,\r\nthe provision shall remain in effect in all its valid applica-\r\ntions that are severable.” 21 U. S. C. §901 (emphasis\r\nadded); see also United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. ___, ___\r\n(2005) (slip op., at 9, and n. 9) (THOMAS, J., dissenting in\r\npart).\r\n   Even in the absence of an express severability provision,\r\nit is implausible that this Court could set aside entire\r\nportions of the United States Code as outside Congress’\r\npower in Lopez and Morrison, but it cannot engage in the\r\nmore restrained practice of invalidating particular appli-\r\ncations of the CSA that are beyond Congress’ power. This\r\nCourt has regularly entertained as-applied challenges\r\nunder constitutional provisions, see United States v.\r\nRaines, 362 U. S. 17, 20–21 (1960), including the Commerce\r\nClause, see Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 295\r\n(1964); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379\r\nU. S. 241, 249 (1964); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111,\r\n\f                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           17\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n113–114 (1942). There is no reason why, when Congress\r\nexceeds the scope of its commerce power, courts may not\r\ninvalidate Congress’ overreaching on a case-by-case basis.\r\nThe CSA undoubtedly regulates a great deal of interstate\r\ncommerce, but that is no license to regulate conduct that\r\nis neither interstate nor commercial, however minor or\r\nincidental.\r\n   If the majority is correct that Lopez and Morrison are\r\ndistinct because they were facial challenges to “particular\r\nstatute[s] or provision[s],” ante, at 20, then congressional\r\npower turns on the manner in which Congress packages\r\nlegislation. Under the majority’s reasoning, Congress could\r\nnot enact—either as a single-subject statute or as a separate\r\nprovision in the CSA—a prohibition on the intrastate pos-\r\nsession or cultivation of marijuana. Nor could it enact an\r\nintrastate ban simply to supplement existing drug regula-\r\ntions. However, that same prohibition is perfectly constitu-\r\ntional when integrated into a piece of legislation that\r\nreaches other regulable conduct. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 600–\r\n601 (THOMAS, J., concurring).\r\n   Finally, the majority’s view—that because some of the\r\nCSA’s applications are constitutional, they must all be\r\nconstitutional—undermines its reliance on the substantial\r\neffects test. The intrastate conduct swept within a general\r\nregulatory scheme may or may not have a substantial\r\neffect on the relevant interstate market. “[O]ne always\r\ncan draw the circle broadly enough to cover an activity\r\nthat, when taken in isolation, would not have substantial\r\neffects on commerce.” Id., at 600 (THOMAS, J., concurring).\r\nThe breadth of legislation that Congress enacts says noth-\r\ning about whether the intrastate activity substantially\r\naffects interstate commerce, let alone whether it is neces-\r\nsary to the scheme. Because medical marijuana users in\r\nCalifornia and elsewhere are not placing substantial\r\namounts of cannabis into the stream of interstate com-\r\nmerce, Congress may not regulate them under the sub-\r\n\f18                  GONZALES v. RAICH\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nstantial effects test, no matter how broadly it drafts the\r\nCSA.\r\n                        *     *     *\r\n  The majority prevents States like California from devis-\r\ning drug policies that they have concluded provide much-\r\nneeded respite to the seriously ill. It does so without any\r\nserious inquiry into the necessity for federal regulation or\r\nthe propriety of “displac[ing] state regulation in areas of\r\ntraditional state concern,” id., at 583 (KENNEDY, J., con-\r\ncurring). The majority’s rush to embrace federal power “is\r\nespecially unfortunate given the importance of showing\r\nrespect for the sovereign States that comprise our Federal\r\nUnion.” United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop-\r\nerative, 532 U. S. 483, 502 (2001) (STEVENS, J., concurring\r\nin judgment). Our federalist system, properly understood,\r\nallows California and a growing number of other States to\r\ndecide for themselves how to safeguard the health and\r\nwelfare of their citizens. I would affirm the judgment of\r\nthe Court of Appeals. I respectfully dissent.\r\n\f",

Michael.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>California is one of at least nine States that authorize the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.<sup>[1]</sup> The question presented in this case is whether the power vested in Congress by Article I, § 8, of the Constitution \"[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\" its authority to \"regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States\" includes the power to prohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana in compliance with California law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>California has been a pioneer in the regulation of marijuana. In 1913, California was one of the first States to prohibit the sale and possession of marijuana,<sup>[2]</sup> and at the end of the century, California became the first State to authorize limited use of the drug for medicinal purposes. In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, now codified as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.<sup>[3]</sup> The proposition was designed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> to ensure that \"seriously ill\" residents of the State have access to marijuana for medical purposes, and to encourage Federal and State Governments to take steps toward ensuring the safe and affordable distribution of the drug to patients in need.<sup>[4]</sup> The Act creates an exemption from criminal prosecution for physicians,<sup>[5]</sup> as well as for patients and primary caregivers who possess or cultivate marijuana for medicinal purposes with the recommendation or approval of a physician.<sup>[6]</sup> A \"primary caregiver\" is a person who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of the patient.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Respondents Angel Raich and Diane Monson are California residents who suffer from a variety of serious medical conditions and have sought to avail themselves of medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the Compassionate Use <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> Act. They are being treated by licensed, board-certified family practitioners, who have concluded, after prescribing a host of conventional medicines to treat respondents' conditions and to alleviate their associated symptoms, that marijuana is the only drug available that provides effective treatment. Both women have been using marijuana as a medication for several years pursuant to their doctors' recommendation, and both rely heavily on cannabis to function on a daily basis. Indeed, Raich's physician believes that forgoing cannabis treatments would certainly cause Raich excruciating pain and could very well prove fatal.</p>\n<p>Respondent Monson cultivates her own marijuana, and ingests the drug in a variety of ways including smoking and using a vaporizer. Respondent Raich, by contrast, is unable to cultivate her own, and thus relies on two caregivers, litigating as \"John Does,\" to provide her with locally grown marijuana at no charge. These caregivers also process the cannabis into hashish or keif, and Raich herself processes some of the marijuana into oils, balms, and foods for consumption.</p>\n<p>On August 15, 2002, county deputy sheriffs and agents from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) came to Monson's home. After a thorough investigation, the county officials concluded that her use of marijuana was entirely lawful as a matter of California law. Nevertheless, after a 3-hour standoff, the federal agents seized and destroyed all six of her cannabis plants.</p>\n<p>Respondents thereafter brought this action against the Attorney General of the United States and the head of the DEA seeking injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. § 801 <i>et seq.,</i> to the extent it prevents them from possessing, obtaining, or manufacturing cannabis for their personal medical use. In their complaint and supporting affidavits, Raich and Monson described the severity of their afflictions, their repeatedly futile attempts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> to obtain relief with conventional medications, and the opinions of their doctors concerning their need to use marijuana. Respondents claimed that enforcing the CSA against them would violate the Commerce Clause, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution, and the doctrine of medical necessity.</p>\n<p>The District Court denied respondents' motion for a preliminary injunction. <i>Raich</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 248 F. Supp. 2d 918 (ND Cal. 2003). Although the court found that the federal enforcement interests \"wane[d]\" when compared to the harm that California residents would suffer if denied access to medically necessary marijuana, it concluded that respondents could not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their legal claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 931.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and ordered the District Court to enter a preliminary injunction.<sup>[8]</sup><i>Raich</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 352 F.3d 1222 (2003). The court found that respondents had \"demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on their claim that, as applied to them, the CSA is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause authority.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1227. The Court of Appeals distinguished prior Circuit cases upholding the CSA in the face of Commerce Clause challenges by focusing on what it deemed to be the <i>\"separate and distinct class of activities\"</i> at issue in this case: \"the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by a patient's physician pursuant to valid California state law.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1228. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> court found the latter class of activities \"different in kind from drug trafficking\" because interposing a physician's recommendation raises different health and safety concerns, and because \"this limited use is clearly distinct from the broader illicit drug marketas well as any broader commercial market for medicinal marijuanainsofar as the medicinal marijuana at issue in this case is not intended for, nor does it enter, the stream of commerce.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The majority placed heavy reliance on our decisions in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S. 598 (2000), as interpreted by recent Circuit precedent, to hold that this separate class of purely local activities was beyond the reach of federal power. In contrast, the dissenting judge concluded that the CSA, as applied to respondents, was clearly valid under <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison;</i> moreover, he thought it \"simply impossible to distinguish the relevant conduct surrounding the cultivation and use of the marijuana crop at issue in this case from the cultivation and use of the wheat crop that affected interstate commerce in <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn.</i>\" 352 F. 3d, at 1235 (opinion of Beam, J.) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The obvious importance of the case prompted our grant of certiorari. 542 U. S. 936 (2004). The case is made difficult by respondents' strong arguments that they will suffer irreparable harm because, despite a congressional finding to the contrary, marijuana does have valid therapeutic purposes. The question before us, however, is not whether it is wise to enforce the statute in these circumstances; rather, it is whether Congress' power to regulate interstate markets for medicinal substances encompasses the portions of those markets that are supplied with drugs produced and consumed locally. Well-settled law controls our answer. The CSA is a valid exercise of federal power, even as applied to the troubling facts of this case. We accordingly vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> II</h2>\n<p>Shortly after taking office in 1969, President Nixon declared a national \"war on drugs.\"<sup>[9]</sup> As the first campaign of that war, Congress set out to enact legislation that would consolidate various drug laws on the books into a comprehensive statute, provide meaningful regulation over legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversion into illegal channels, and strengthen law enforcement tools against the traffic in illicit drugs.<sup>[10]</sup> That effort culminated in the passage of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1236.</p>\n<p>This was not, however, Congress' first attempt to regulate the national market in drugs. Rather, as early as 1906 Congress enacted federal legislation imposing labeling regulations on medications and prohibiting the manufacture or shipment of any adulterated or misbranded drug traveling in interstate commerce.<sup>[11]</sup> Aside from these labeling restrictions, most domestic drug regulations prior to 1970 generally came in the guise of revenue laws, with the Department of the Treasury serving as the Federal Government's primary enforcer.<sup>[12]</sup> For example, the primary drug control law, before being repealed by the passage of the CSA, was the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, 38 Stat. 785 (repealed 1970). The Harrison Act sought to exert control over the possession and sale of narcotics, specifically cocaine and opiates, by requiring producers, distributors, and purchasers to register with the Federal Government, by assessing taxes against <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> parties so registered, and by regulating the issuance of prescriptions.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>Marijuana itself was not significantly regulated by the Federal Government until 1937 when accounts of marijuana's addictive qualities and physiological effects, paired with dissatisfaction with enforcement efforts at state and local levels, prompted Congress to pass the Marihuana Tax Act, 50 Stat. 551 (repealed 1970).<sup>[14]</sup> Like the Harrison Act, the Marihuana Tax Act did not outlaw the possession or sale of marijuana outright. Rather, it imposed registration and reporting requirements for all individuals importing, producing, selling, or dealing in marijuana, and required the payment of annual taxes in addition to transfer taxes whenever the drug changed hands.<sup>[15]</sup> Moreover, doctors wishing to prescribe marijuana for medical purposes were required to comply with rather burdensome administrative requirements.<sup>[16]</sup> Noncompliance exposed traffickers to severe federal penalties, whereas compliance would often subject them to prosecution under state law.<sup>[17]</sup> Thus, while the Marihuana Tax Act did not declare the drug illegal <i>per se,</i> the onerous administrative requirements, the prohibitively expensive taxes, and the risks attendant on compliance practically curtailed the marijuana trade.</p>\n<p>Then in 1970, after declaration of the national \"war on drugs,\" federal drug policy underwent a significant transformation. A number of noteworthy events precipitated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> this policy shift. First, in <i>Leary</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 395 U. S. 6 (1969), this Court held certain provisions of the Marihuana Tax Act and other narcotics legislation unconstitutional. Second, at the end of his term, President Johnson fundamentally reorganized the federal drug control agencies. The Bureau of Narcotics, then housed in the Department of Treasury, merged with the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control, then housed in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), to create the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, currently housed in the Department of Justice.<sup>[18]</sup> Finally, prompted by a perceived need to consolidate the growing number of piecemeal drug laws and to enhance federal drug enforcement powers, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>Title II of that Act, the CSA, repealed most of the earlier antidrug laws in favor of a comprehensive regime to combat the international and interstate traffic in illicit drugs. The main objectives of the CSA were to conquer drug abuse and to control the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances.<sup>[20]</sup> Congress was particularly concerned with the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> need to prevent the diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit channels.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>To effectuate these goals, Congress devised a closed regulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess any controlled substance except in a manner authorized by the CSA. 21 U. S. C. §§ 841(a)(1), 844(a). The CSA categorizes all controlled substances into five schedules. § 812. The drugs are grouped together based on their accepted medical uses, the potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> §§ 811, 812. Each schedule is associated with a distinct set of controls regarding the manufacture, distribution, and use of the substances listed therein. §§ 821-830. The CSA and its implementing regulations set forth strict requirements regarding registration, labeling and packaging, production quotas, drug security, and recordkeeping. <i>Ibid.;</i> 21 CFR § 1301 <i>et seq.</i> (2004).</p>\n<p>In enacting the CSA, Congress classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug. 21 U. S. C. § 812(c). This preliminary classification was based, in part, on the recommendation of the Assistant Secretary of HEW \"that marihuana be retained within schedule I at least until the completion of certain studies now underway.\"<sup>[22]</sup> Schedule I drugs are categorized as such because of their high potential for abuse, lack of any accepted medical use, and absence of any accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment. § 812(b)(1). These three factors, in varying gradations, are also used to categorize drugs in the other four schedules. For example, Schedule II substances also have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence, but unlike Schedule I drugs, they have a currently accepted medical use. § 812(b)(2). By classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug, as opposed to listing it on a lesser schedule, the manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana became a criminal offense, with the sole exception being use of the drug as part of a Food and Drug Administration pre-approved research study. §§ 823(f), 841(a)(1), 844(a); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative,</i> 532 U. S. 483, 490 (2001).</p>\n<p>The CSA provides for the periodic updating of schedules and delegates authority to the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to add, remove, or transfer substances to, from, or between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> schedules. § 811. Despite considerable efforts to reschedule marijuana, it remains a Schedule I drug.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Respondents in this case do not dispute that passage of the CSA, as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, was well within Congress' commerce power. Brief for Respondents 22, 38. Nor do they contend that any provision or section of the CSA amounts to an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority. Rather, respondents' challenge is actually quite limited; they argue that the CSA's categorical prohibition of the manufacture and possession of marijuana as applied to the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana for medical purposes pursuant to California law exceeds Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>In assessing the validity of congressional regulation, none of our Commerce Clause cases can be viewed in isolation. As charted in considerable detail in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez</i><i>,</i> our understanding of the reach of the Commerce Clause, as well as Congress' assertion of authority thereunder has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> evolved over time.<sup>[24]</sup> The Commerce Clause emerged as the Framers' response to the central problem giving rise to the Constitution itself: the absence of any federal commerce power under the Articles of Confederation.<sup>[25]</sup> For the first century of our history, the primary use of the Clause was to preclude the kind of discriminatory state legislation that had once been permissible.<sup>[26]</sup> Then, in response to rapid industrial development and an increasingly interdependent national economy, Congress \"ushered in a new era of federal regulation under the commerce power,\" beginning with the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, 24 Stat. 379, and the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 2 <i>et seq.</i><sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p>Cases decided during that \"new era,\" which now spans more than a century, have identified three general categories of regulation in which Congress is authorized to engage under its commerce power. First, Congress can regulate the channels of interstate commerce. <i>Perez</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 402 U. S. 146, 150 (1971). Second, Congress has authority to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> commerce. <i>Ibid.</i> Third, Congress has the power to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. <i>Ibid.; </i><i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.,</i> 301 U. S. 1, 37 (1937). Only the third category is implicated in the case at hand.</p>\n<p>Our case law firmly establishes Congress' power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic \"class of activities\" that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Perez,</i> 402 U. S., at 151; <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn,</i> 317 U. S. 111, 128-129 (1942). As we stated in <i>Wickard,</i> \"even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 125. We have never required Congress to legislate with scientific exactitude. When Congress decides that the \"`total incidence'\" of a practice poses a threat to a national market, it may regulate the entire class. See <i>Perez,</i> 402 U. S., at 154-155 (quoting <i>Westfall</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 274 U. S. 256, 259 (1927) (\"`[W]hen it is necessary in order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace more than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so'\")). In this vein, we have reiterated that when \"`a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the <i>de minimis</i> character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.'\" <i>E. g., </i><i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 558 (emphasis deleted) (quoting <i>Maryland</i> v. <i>Wirtz,</i> 392 U. S. 183, 196, n. 27 (1968)).</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Wickard,</i> 317 U. S. 111, is of particular relevance. In <i>Wickard,</i> we upheld the application of regulations promulgated under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 31, which were designed to control the volume of wheat moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and consequent abnormally low prices. The regulations established an allotment of 11.1 acres for Filburn's 1941 wheat crop, but he sowed 23 acres, intending to use the excess by consuming it on his own farm. Filburn <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> argued that even though we had sustained Congress' power to regulate the production of goods for commerce, that power did not authorize \"federal regulation [of] production not intended in any part for commerce but wholly for consumption on the farm.\" <i>Wickard,</i> 317 U. S., at 118. Justice Jackson's opinion for a unanimous Court rejected this submission. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The effect of the statute before us is to restrict the amount which may be produced for market and the extent as well to which one may forestall resort to the market by producing to meet his own needs. That appellee's own contribution to the demand for wheat may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from the scope of federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 127-128.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Wickard</i> thus establishes that Congress can regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself \"commercial,\" in that it is not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.</p>\n<p>The similarities between this case and <i>Wickard</i> are striking. Like the farmer in <i>Wickard,</i> respondents are cultivating, for home consumption, a fungible commodity for which there is an established, albeit illegal, interstate market.<sup>[28]</sup> Just as the Agricultural Adjustment Act was designed \"to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> control the volume [of wheat] moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses ...\" and consequently control the market price, <i>id.,</i> at 115, a primary purpose of the CSA is to control the supply and demand of controlled substances in both lawful and unlawful drug markets. See nn. 20-21, <i>supra.</i> In <i>Wickard,</i> we had no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that, when viewed in the aggregate, leaving home-consumed wheat outside the regulatory scheme would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions. Here too, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that leaving home-consumed marijuana outside federal control would similarly affect price and market conditions.</p>\n<p>More concretely, one concern prompting inclusion of wheat grown for home consumption in the 1938 Act was that rising market prices could draw such wheat into the interstate market, resulting in lower market prices. <i>Wickard,</i> 317 U. S., at 128. The parallel concern making it appropriate to include marijuana grown for home consumption in the CSA is the likelihood that the high demand in the interstate market will draw such marijuana into that market. While the diversion of homegrown wheat tended to frustrate the federal interest in stabilizing prices by regulating the volume of commercial transactions in the interstate market, the diversion of homegrown marijuana tends to frustrate the federal interest in eliminating commercial transactions in the interstate market in their entirety. In both cases, the regulation is squarely within Congress' commerce power because production of the commodity meant for home consumption, be it wheat or marijuana, has a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market for that commodity.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> Nonetheless, respondents suggest that <i>Wickard</i> differs from this case in three respects: (1) the Agricultural Adjustment Act, unlike the CSA, exempted small farming operations; (2) <i>Wickard</i> involved a \"quintessential economic activity\"a commercial farmwhereas respondents do not sell marijuana; and (3) the <i>Wickard</i> record made it clear that the aggregate production of wheat for use on farms had a significant impact on market prices. Those differences, though factually accurate, do not diminish the precedential force of this Court's reasoning.</p>\n<p>The fact that Filburn's own impact on the market was \"trivial by itself\" was not a sufficient reason for removing him from the scope of federal regulation. 317 U. S., at 127. That the Secretary of Agriculture elected to exempt even smaller farms from regulation does not speak to his power to regulate all those whose aggregated production was significant, nor did that fact play any role in the Court's analysis. Moreover, even though Filburn was indeed a commercial farmer, the activity he was engaged inthe cultivation of wheat for home consumptionwas not treated by the Court as part of his commercial farming operation.<sup>[30]</sup> And while it is true that the record in the <i>Wickard</i> case itself established the causal connection between the production for local use and the national market, we have before us findings by Congress to the same effect.</p>\n<p>Findings in the introductory sections of the CSA explain why Congress deemed it appropriate to encompass local activities within the scope of the CSA. See n. 20, <i>supra.</i> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> submissions of the parties and the numerous <i>amici</i> all seem to agree that the national, and international, market for marijuana has dimensions that are fully comparable to those defining the class of activities regulated by the Secretary pursuant to the 1938 statute.<sup>[31]</sup> Respondents nonetheless insist that the CSA cannot be constitutionally applied to their activities because Congress did not make a specific finding that the intrastate cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes based on the recommendation of a physician would substantially affect the larger interstate marijuana market. Be that as it may, we have never required Congress to make particularized findings in order to legislate, see <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 562; <i>Perez,</i> 402 U. S., at 156, absent a special concern such as the protection of free speech, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</i> v. <i>FCC,</i> 512 U. S. 622, 664-668 (1994) (plurality opinion). While congressional findings are certainly helpful in reviewing the substance of a congressional statutory scheme, particularly when the connection to commerce is not self-evident, and while we will consider congressional findings in our analysis when they are available, the absence of particularized findings does not call into question Congress' authority to legislate.<sup>[32]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> In assessing the scope of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause, we stress that the task before us is a modest one. We need not determine whether respondents' activities, taken in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a \"rational basis\" exists for so concluding. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 557; see also <i>Hodel</i> v. <i>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,</i> 452 U. S. 264, 276-280 (1981); <i>Perez,</i> 402 U. S., at 155-156; <i>Katzenbach</i> v. <i>McClung,</i> 379 U. S. 294, 299-301 (1964); <i>Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 379 U. S. 241, 252-253 (1964). Given the enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, 21 U. S. C. § 801(5), and concerns about diversion into illicit channels,<sup>[33]</sup> we have no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the CSA. Thus, as in <i>Wickard,</i> when it enacted comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market in a fungible commodity, Congress was acting well within its authority to \"make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper\" to \"regulate Commerce ... among the several States.\" U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8. That the regulation ensnares some purely intrastate activity is of no moment. As we have done many times before, we refuse to excise individual components of that larger scheme.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> IV</h2>\n<p>To support their contrary submission, respondents rely heavily on two of our more recent Commerce Clause cases. In their myopic focus, they overlook the larger context of modern-era Commerce Clause jurisprudence preserved by those cases. Moreover, even in the narrow prism of respondents' creation, they read those cases far too broadly.</p>\n<p>Those two cases, of course, are <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S. 549, and <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S. 598. As an initial matter, the statutory challenges at issue in those cases were markedly different from the challenge respondents pursue in the case at hand. Here, respondents ask us to excise individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme. In contrast, in both <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the parties asserted that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress' commerce power in its entirety. This distinction is pivotal for we have often reiterated that \"[w]here the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power `to excise, as trivial, individual instances' of the class.\" <i>Perez,</i> 402 U. S., at 154 (emphasis deleted) (quoting <i>Wirtz,</i> 392 U. S., at 193); see also <i>Hodel,</i> 452 U. S., at 308.</p>\n<p>At issue in <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S. 549, was the validity of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which was a brief, single-subject statute making it a crime for an individual to possess a gun in a school zone. 104 Stat. 4844-4845, 18 U. S. C. § 922(q)(1)(A). The Act did not regulate any economic activity and did not contain any requirement that the possession of a gun have any connection to past interstate activity or a predictable impact on future commercial activity. Distinguishing our earlier cases holding that comprehensive regulatory statutes may be validly applied to local conduct that does not, when viewed in isolation, have a significant impact on interstate commerce, we held the statute invalid. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> \"Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms. Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.\" 514 U. S., at 561.</blockquote>\n<p>The statutory scheme that the Government is defending in this litigation is at the opposite end of the regulatory spectrum. As explained above, the CSA, enacted in 1970 as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, 84 Stat. 1242-1284, was a lengthy and detailed statute creating a comprehensive framework for regulating the production, distribution, and possession of five classes of \"controlled substances.\" Most of those substancesthose listed in Schedules II through V\"have a useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the American people.\" 21 U. S. C. § 801(1). The regulatory scheme is designed to foster the beneficial use of those medications, to prevent their misuse, and to prohibit entirely the possession or use of substances listed in Schedule I, except as a part of a strictly controlled research project.</p>\n<p>While the statute provided for the periodic updating of the five schedules, Congress itself made the initial classifications. It identified 42 opiates, 22 opium derivatives, and 17 hallucinogenic substances as Schedule I drugs. 84 Stat. 1248. Marijuana was listed as the 10th item in the 3d subcategory. That classification, unlike the discrete prohibition established by the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, was merely one of many \"essential part[s] of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 561.<sup>[34]</sup> Our opinion in <i>Lopez</i> casts no doubt on the validity of such a program.</p>\n<p>Nor does this Court's holding in <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S. 598. The Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 1902, created a federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated crimes of violence. 42 U. S. C. § 13981. The remedy was enforceable in both state and federal courts, and generally depended on proof of the violation of a state law. Despite congressional findings that such crimes had an adverse impact on interstate commerce, we held the statute unconstitutional because, like the statute in <i>Lopez,</i> it did not regulate economic activity. We concluded that \"the non-economic, criminal nature of the conduct at issue was central to our decision\" in <i>Lopez,</i> and that our prior cases had identified a clear pattern of analysis: \"`Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained.'\"<sup>[35]</sup><i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S., at 610.</p>\n<p>Unlike those at issue in <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the activities regulated by the CSA are quintessentially economic. \"Economics\" refers to \"the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities.\" Webster's Third New International <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> Dictionary 720 (1966). The CSA is a statute that regulates the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities for which there is an established, and lucrative, interstate market. Prohibiting the intrastate possession or manufacture of an article of commerce is a rational (and commonly utilized) means of regulating commerce in that product.<sup>[36]</sup> Such prohibitions include specific decisions requiring that a drug be withdrawn from the market as a result of the failure to comply with regulatory requirements as well as decisions excluding Schedule I drugs entirely from the market. Because the CSA is a statute that directly regulates economic, commercial activity, our opinion in <i>Morrison</i> casts no doubt on its constitutionality.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals was able to conclude otherwise only by isolating a \"separate and distinct\" class of activities that it held to be beyond the reach of federal power, defined as \"the intrastate, non-commercial cultivation, possession and use of marijuana for personal medical purposes on the advice of a physician and in accordance with state law.\" 352 F. 3d, at 1229. The court characterized this class as \"different in kind from drug trafficking.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1228. The differences between the members of a class so defined and the principal traffickers in Schedule I substances might be sufficient to justify a policy decision exempting the narrower class from the coverage of the CSA. The question, however, is whether Congress' contrary policy judgment, <i>i. e.,</i> its decision to include this narrower \"class of activities\" within the larger regulatory scheme, was constitutionally deficient. We have no difficulty concluding that Congress acted rationally in determining that none of the characteristics making up the purported class, whether viewed individually or in the aggregate, compelled an exemption from the CSA; rather, the subdivided class of activities defined by the Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> of Appeals was an essential part of the larger regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p>First, the fact that marijuana is used \"for personal medical purposes on the advice of a physician\" cannot itself serve as a distinguishing factor. <i>Id.,</i> at 1229. The CSA designates marijuana as contraband for <i>any</i> purpose; in fact, by characterizing marijuana as a Schedule I drug, Congress expressly found that the drug has no acceptable medical uses. Moreover, the CSA is a comprehensive regulatory regime specifically designed to regulate which controlled substances can be utilized for medicinal purposes, and in what manner. Indeed, most of the substances classified in the CSA \"have a useful and legitimate medical purpose.\" 21 U. S. C. § 801(1). Thus, even if respondents are correct that marijuana does have accepted medical uses and thus should be redesignated as a lesser schedule drug,<sup>[37]</sup> the CSA would still impose controls beyond what is required by California law. The CSA requires manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, and other handlers of controlled substances to comply with statutory and regulatory provisions mandating registration with the DEA, compliance with specific production quotas, security controls to guard against diversion, recordkeeping and reporting obligations, and prescription requirements. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> §§ 821-830; 21 CFR § 1301 <i>et seq.</i> (2004). Furthermore, the dispensing of new drugs, even when doctors approve their use, must await federal approval. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rutherford,</i> 442 U. S. 544 (1979). Accordingly, the mere fact that marijuanalike virtually every other controlled substance regulated by the CSAis used for medicinal purposes cannot possibly serve to distinguish it from the core activities regulated by the CSA.</p>\n<p>Nor can it serve as an \"objective marke[r]\" or \"objective facto[r]\" to arbitrarily narrow the relevant class as the dissenters suggest, <i>post,</i> at 47 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); <i>post,</i> at 68 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). More fundamentally, if, as the principal dissent contends, the personal cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes is beyond the \"`outer limits' of Congress' Commerce Clause authority,\" <i>post,</i> at 42 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.), it must also be true that such personal use of marijuana (or any other homegrown drug) for recreational purposes is also beyond those \"`outer limits,'\" whether or not a State elects to authorize or even regulate such use. JUSTICE THOMAS' separate dissent suffers from the same sweeping implications. That is, the dissenters' rationale logically extends to place <i>any</i> federal regulation (including quality, prescription, or quantity controls) of <i>any</i> locally cultivated and possessed controlled substance for <i>any</i> purpose beyond the \"`outer limits'\" of Congress' Commerce Clause authority. One need not have a degree in economics to understand why a nationwide exemption for the vast quantity of marijuana (or other drugs) locally cultivated for personal use (which presumably would include use by friends, neighbors, and family members) may have a substantial impact on the interstate market for this extraordinarily popular substance. The congressional judgment that an exemption for such a significant segment of the total market would undermine the orderly enforcement of the entire regulatory scheme is entitled to a strong presumption of validity. Indeed, that judgment is not only rational, but \"visible to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> naked eye,\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 563, under any commonsense appraisal of the probable consequences of such an open-ended exemption.</p>\n<p>Second, limiting the activity to marijuana possession and cultivation \"in accordance with state law\" cannot serve to place respondents' activities beyond congressional reach. The Supremacy Clause unambiguously provides that if there is any conflict between federal and state law, federal law shall prevail. It is beyond peradventure that federal power over commerce is \"`superior to that of the States to provide for the welfare or necessities of their inhabitants,'\" however legitimate or dire those necessities may be. <i>Wirtz,</i> 392 U. S., at 196 (quoting <i>Sanitary Dist. of Chicago</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 266 U. S. 405, 426 (1925)). See also 392 U. S., at 195-196; <i>Wickard,</i> 317 U. S., at 124 (\"`[N]o form of state activity can constitutionally thwart the regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to Congress'\"). Just as state acquiescence to federal regulation cannot expand the bounds of the Commerce Clause, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S., at 661-662 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (noting that 38 States requested federal intervention), so too state action cannot circumscribe Congress' plenary commerce power. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Darby,</i> 312 U. S. 100, 114 (1941) (\"That power can neither be enlarged nor diminished by the exercise or non-exercise of state power\").<sup>[38]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> Respondents acknowledge this proposition, but nonetheless contend that their activities were not \"an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme\" because they had been \"isolated by the State of California, and [are] policed by the State of California,\" and thus remain \"entirely separated from the market.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. The dissenters fall prey to similar reasoning. See n. 38, <i>supra,</i> at 26 and this page. The notion that California law has surgically excised a discrete activity that is hermetically sealed off from the larger interstate marijuana market is a dubious proposition, and, more importantly, one that Congress could have rationally rejected.</p>\n<p>Indeed, that the California exemptions will have a significant impact on both the supply and demand sides of the market for marijuana is not just \"plausible\" as the principal dissent concedes, <i>post,</i> at 56 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.), it is readily apparent. The exemption for physicians provides them with an economic incentive to grant their patients permission to use the drug. In contrast to most prescriptions for legal drugs, which limit the dosage and duration of the usage, under California law the doctor's permission to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> recommend marijuana use is open-ended. The authority to grant permission whenever the doctor determines that a patient is afflicted with \"any other illness for which marijuana provides relief,\" Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 11362.5(b)(1)(A) (West Supp. 2005), is broad enough to allow even the most scrupulous doctor to conclude that some recreational uses would be therapeutic.<sup>[39]</sup> And our cases have taught us that there are some unscrupulous physicians who overprescribe when it is sufficiently profitable to do so.<sup>[40]</sup></p>\n<p>The exemption for cultivation by patients and caregivers can only increase the supply of marijuana in the California market.<sup>[41]</sup> The likelihood that all such production will <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> promptly terminate when patients recover or will precisely match the patients' medical needs during their convalescence seems remote; whereas the danger that excesses will satisfy some of the admittedly enormous demand for recreational use seems obvious.<sup>[42]</sup> Moreover, that the national and international narcotics trade has thrived in the face of vigorous criminal enforcement efforts suggests that no small number of unscrupulous people will make use of the California exemptions to serve their commercial ends whenever it is feasible to do so.<sup>[43]</sup> Taking into account the fact that California is only one of at least nine States to have authorized the medical use of marijuana, a fact JUSTICE O'CONNOR's dissent conveniently disregards in arguing that the demonstrated effect on commerce while admittedly \"plausible\" is ultimately \"unsubstantiated,\" <i>post,</i> at 56, 55, Congress could have rationally concluded that the aggregate impact on the national market of all the transactions exempted from federal supervision is unquestionably substantial.</p>\n<p>So, from the \"separate and distinct\" class of activities identified by the Court of Appeals (and adopted by the dissenters), we are left with \"the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation, possession and use of marijuana.\" 352 F. 3d, at 1229. Thus the case for the exemption comes down to the claim that a locally cultivated product that is used domestically <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> rather than sold on the open market is not subject to federal regulation. Given the findings in the CSA and the undisputed magnitude of the commercial market for marijuana, our decisions in <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn</i> and the later cases endorsing its reasoning foreclose that claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Respondents also raise a substantive due process claim and seek to avail themselves of the medical necessity defense. These theories of relief were set forth in their complaint but were not reached by the Court of Appeals. We therefore do not address the question whether judicial relief is available to respondents on these alternative bases. We do note, however, the presence of another avenue of relief. As the Solicitor General confirmed during oral argument, the statute authorizes procedures for the reclassification of Schedule I drugs. But perhaps even more important than these legal avenues is the democratic process, in which the voices of voters allied with these respondents may one day be heard in the halls of Congress. Under the present state of the law, however, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be vacated. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court's holding that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) may validly be applied to respondents' cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana for personal, medicinal use. I write separately because my understanding of the doctrinal foundation on which that holding rests is, if not inconsistent with that of the Court, at least more nuanced.</p>\n<p>Since <i>Perez</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 402 U. S. 146 (1971), our cases have mechanically recited that the Commerce Clause permits congressional regulation of three categories: (1) the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> channels of interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate commerce; and (3) activities that \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce. <i>Id.,</i> at 150; see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S. 598, 608-609 (2000); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S. 549, 558-559 (1995); <i>Hodel</i> v. <i>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,</i> 452 U. S. 264, 276-277 (1981). The first two categories are self-evident, since they are the ingredients of interstate commerce itself. See <i>Gibbons</i> v. <i>Ogden,</i> 9 Wheat. 1, 189-190 (1824). The third category, however, is different in kind, and its recitation without explanation is misleading and incomplete.</p>\n<p>It is <i>misleading</i> because, unlike the channels, instrumentalities, and agents of interstate commerce, activities that substantially affect interstate commerce are not themselves part of interstate commerce, and thus the power to regulate them cannot come from the Commerce Clause alone. Rather, as this Court has acknowledged since at least <i>United States</i> v. <i>Coombs,</i> 12 Pet. 72 (1838), Congress's regulatory authority over intrastate activities that are not themselves part of interstate commerce (including activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce) derives from the Necessary and Proper Clause. <i>Id.,</i> at 78; <i>Katzenbach</i> v. <i>McClung,</i> 379 U. S. 294, 301-302 (1964); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wrightwood Dairy Co.,</i> 315 U. S. 110, 119 (1942); <i>Shreveport Rate Cases,</i> 234 U. S. 342, 353 (1914); <i>United States</i> v. <i>E. C. Knight Co.,</i> 156 U. S. 1, 39-40 (1895) (Harlan, J., dissenting).<sup>[1]</sup> And the category of \"activities that substantially affect interstate commerce,\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 559, is <i>incomplete</i> because the authority to enact laws necessary and proper for the regulation of interstate commerce is not limited to laws <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> governing intrastate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. Where necessary to make a regulation of interstate commerce effective, Congress may regulate even those intrastate activities that do not themselves substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Our cases show that the regulation of intrastate activities may be necessary to and proper for the regulation of interstate commerce in two general circumstances. Most directly, the commerce power permits Congress not only to devise rules for the governance of commerce between States but also to facilitate interstate commerce by eliminating potential obstructions, and to restrict it by eliminating potential stimulants. See <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.,</i> 301 U. S. 1, 36-37 (1937). That is why the Court has repeatedly sustained congressional legislation on the ground that the regulated activities had a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Hodel, supra,</i> at 281 (surface coal mining); <i>Katzenbach, supra,</i> at 300 (discrimination by restaurants); <i>Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 379 U. S. 241, 258 (1964) (discrimination by hotels); <i>Mandeville Island Farms, Inc.</i> v. <i>American Crystal Sugar Co.,</i> 334 U. S. 219, 237 (1948) (intrastate price fixing); <i>Board of Trade of Chicago</i> v. <i>Olsen,</i> 262 U. S. 1, 40 (1923) (activities of a local grain exchange); <i>Stafford</i> v. <i>Wallace,</i> 258 U. S. 495, 517, 524-525 (1922) (intrastate transactions at stockyard). <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> recognized the expansive scope of Congress's authority in this regard: \"[T]he pattern is clear. Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained.\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 560; <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 610 (same).</p>\n<p>This principle is not without limitation. In <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the Court  conscious of the potential of the \"substantially affects\" test to \"`obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local,'\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 566-567 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> (quoting <i>A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 295 U. S. 495, 554 (1935)); see also <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 615-616  rejected the argument that Congress may regulate <i>noneconomic</i> activity based solely on the effect that it may have on interstate commerce through a remote chain of inferences. <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 564-566; <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 617-618. \"[I]f we were to accept [such] arguments,\" the Court reasoned in <i>Lopez,</i> \"we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate.\" 514 U. S., at 564; see also <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 615-616. Thus, although Congress's authority to regulate intrastate activity that substantially affects interstate commerce is broad, it does not permit the Court to \"pile inference upon inference,\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 567, in order to establish that noneconomic activity has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>As we implicitly acknowledged in <i>Lopez,</i> however, Congress's authority to enact laws necessary and proper for the regulation of interstate commerce is not limited to laws directed against economic activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Though the conduct in <i>Lopez</i> was not economic, the Court nevertheless recognized that it could be regulated as \"an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\" 514 U. S., at 561. This statement referred to those cases permitting the regulation of intrastate activities \"which in a substantial way interfere with or obstruct the exercise of the granted power.\" <i>Wrightwood Dairy Co., supra,</i> at 119; see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Darby,</i> 312 U. S. 100, 118-119 (1941); <i>Shreveport Rate Cases, supra,</i> at 353. As the Court put it in <i>Wrightwood Dairy,</i> where Congress has the authority to enact a regulation of interstate commerce, \"it possesses every power needed to make that regulation effective.\" 315 U. S., at 118-119.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> Although this power \"to make ... regulation effective\" commonly overlaps with the authority to regulate economic activities that substantially affect interstate commerce,<sup>[2]</sup> and may in some cases have been confused with that authority, the two are distinct. The regulation of an intrastate activity may be essential to a comprehensive regulation of interstate commerce even though the intrastate activity does not itself \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce. Moreover, as the passage from <i>Lopez</i> quoted above suggests, Congress may regulate even noneconomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce. See <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 561. The relevant question is simply whether the means chosen are \"reasonably adapted\" to the attainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power. See <i>Darby, supra,</i> at 121.</p>\n<p>In <i>Darby,</i> for instance, the Court explained that \"Congress, having ... adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards,\" 312 U. S., at 121, could not only require employers engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce to conform to wage and hour standards, <i>id.,</i> at 119-121, but could also require those employers to keep employment records in order to demonstrate compliance with the regulatory scheme, <i>id.,</i> at 125. While the Court sustained the former regulation on the alternative ground that the activity it regulated could have a \"great effect\" on interstate commerce, <i>id.,</i> at 122-123, it affirmed the latter on the sole ground that \"[t]he requirement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> for records even of the intrastate transaction is an appropriate means to the legitimate end,\" <i>id.,</i> at 125.</p>\n<p>As the Court said in the <i>Shreveport Rate Cases,</i> the Necessary and Proper Clause does not give \"Congress ... the authority to regulate the internal commerce of a State, as such,\" but it does allow Congress \"to take all measures necessary or appropriate to\" the effective regulation of the interstate market, \"although intrastate transactions ... may thereby be controlled.\" 234 U. S., at 353; see also <i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., supra,</i> at 38 (the logic of the <i>Shreveport Rate Cases</i> is not limited to instrumentalities of commerce).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Today's principal dissent objects that, by permitting Congress to regulate activities necessary to effective interstate regulation, the Court reduces <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> to little \"more than a drafting guide.\" <i>Post,</i> at 46 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). I think that criticism unjustified. Unlike the power to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, the power to enact laws enabling effective regulation of interstate commerce can only be exercised in conjunction with congressional regulation of an interstate market, and it extends only to those measures necessary to make the interstate regulation effective. As <i>Lopez</i> itself states, and the Court affirms today, Congress may regulate noneconomic intrastate activities only where the failure to do so \"could ... undercut\" its regulation of interstate commerce. See <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 561; <i>ante,</i> at 18, 24-25. This is not a power that threatens to obliterate the line between \"what is truly national and what is truly local.\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 567-568.</p>\n<p><i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> affirm that Congress may not regulate certain \"purely local\" activity within the States based solely on the attenuated effect that such activity may have in the interstate market. But those decisions do not declare noneconomic intrastate activities to be categorically beyond <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> the reach of the Federal Government. Neither case involved the power of Congress to exert control over intrastate activities in connection with a more comprehensive scheme of regulation; <i>Lopez</i> expressly disclaimed that it was such a case, 514 U. S., at 561, and <i>Morrison</i> did not even discuss the possibility that it was. (The Court of Appeals in <i>Morrison</i> made clear that it was not. See <i>Brzonkala</i> v. <i>Virginia Polytechnic Inst.,</i> 169 F. 3d 820, 834-835 (CA4 1999) (en banc).) To dismiss this distinction as \"superficial and formalistic,\" see <i>post,</i> at 47 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), is to misunderstand the nature of the Necessary and Proper Clause, which empowers Congress to enact laws in effectuation of its enumerated powers that are not within its authority to enact in isolation. See <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 4 Wheat. 316, 421-422 (1819).</p>\n<p>And there are other restraints upon the Necessary and Proper Clause authority. As Chief Justice Marshall wrote in <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i><i>,</i> even when the end is constitutional and legitimate, the means must be \"appropriate\" and \"plainly adapted\" to that end. <i>Id.,</i> at 421. Moreover, they may not be otherwise \"prohibited\" and must be \"consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution.\" <i>Ibid.</i> These phrases are not merely hortatory. For example, cases such as <i>Printz</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 521 U. S. 898 (1997), and <i>New York</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 505 U. S. 144 (1992), affirm that a law is not \"`<i>proper</i> for carrying into Execution the Commerce Clause'\" \"[w]hen [it] violates [a constitutional] principle of state sovereignty.\" <i>Printz, supra,</i> at 923-924; see also <i>New York, supra,</i> at 166.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The application of these principles to the case before us is straightforward. In the CSA, Congress has undertaken to extinguish the interstate market in Schedule I controlled substances, including marijuana. The Commerce Clause unquestionably permits this. The power to regulate interstate commerce \"extends not only to those regulations which aid, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> foster and protect the commerce, but embraces those which prohibit it.\" <i>Darby, supra,</i> at 113. See also <i>Hipolite Egg Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 220 U. S. 45, 58 (1911); <i>Lottery Case,</i> 188 U. S. 321, 354 (1903). To effectuate its objective, Congress has prohibited almost all intrastate activities related to Schedule I substances  both economic activities (manufacture, distribution, possession with the intent to distribute) and noneconomic activities (simple possession). See 21 U. S. C. §§ 841(a), 844(a). That simple possession is a noneconomic activity is immaterial to whether it can be prohibited as a necessary part of a larger regulation. Rather, Congress's authority to enact all of these prohibitions of intrastate controlled-substance activities depends only upon whether they are appropriate means of achieving the legitimate end of eradicating Schedule I substances from interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>By this measure, I think the regulation must be sustained. Not only is it impossible to distinguish \"controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate\" from \"controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate,\" but it hardly makes sense to speak in such terms. Drugs like marijuana are fungible commodities. As the Court explains, marijuana that is grown at home and possessed for personal use is never more than an instant from the interstate market  and this is so whether or not the possession is for medicinal use or lawful use under the laws of a particular State.<sup>[3]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> See <i>ante,</i> at 25-33. Congress need not accept on faith that state law will be effective in maintaining a strict division between a lawful market for \"medical\" marijuana and the more general marijuana market. See <i>ante,</i> at 30, and n. 38. \"To impose on [Congress] the necessity of resorting to means which it cannot control, which another government may furnish or withhold, would render its course precarious, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a dependence on other governments, which might disappoint its most important designs, and is incompatible with the language of the constitution.\" <i>McCulloch,</i> 4 Wheat., at 424.</p>\n<p>Finally, neither respondents nor the dissenters suggest any violation of state sovereignty of the sort that would render this regulation \"inappropriate,\" <i>id.,</i> at 421  except to argue that the CSA regulates an area typically left to state regulation. See <i>post,</i> at 48, 51 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); <i>post,</i> at 66 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); Brief for Respondents 39-42. That is not enough to render federal regulation an inappropriate means. The Court has repeatedly recognized that, if authorized by the commerce power, Congress may regulate private endeavors \"even when [that regulation] may pre-empt express state-law determinations contrary to the result which has commended itself to the collective wisdom of Congress.\" <i>National League of Cities</i> v. <i>Usery,</i> 426 U. S. 833, 840 (1976); see <i>Cleveland</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 329 U. S. 14, 19 (1946); <i>McCulloch, supra,</i> at 424. At bottom, respondents' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> state-sovereignty argument reduces to the contention that federal regulation of the activities permitted by California's Compassionate Use Act is not sufficiently necessary to be \"necessary and proper\" to Congress's regulation of the interstate market. For the reasons given above and in the Court's opinion, I cannot agree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>I thus agree with the Court that, however the class of regulated activities is subdivided, Congress could reasonably conclude that its objective of prohibiting marijuana from the interstate market \"could be undercut\" if those activities were excepted from its general scheme of regulation. See <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 561. That is sufficient to authorize the application of the CSA to respondents.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE THOMAS join as to all but Part III, dissenting.</p>\n<p>We enforce the \"outer limits\" of Congress' Commerce Clause authority not for their own sake, but to protect historic spheres of state sovereignty from excessive federal encroachment and thereby to maintain the distribution of power fundamental to our federalist system of government. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S. 549, 557 (1995); <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.,</i> 301 U. S. 1, 37 (1937). One of federalism's chief virtues, of course, is that it promotes innovation by allowing for the possibility that \"a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\" <i>New State Ice Co.</i> v. <i>Liebmann,</i> 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>This case exemplifies the role of States as laboratories. The States' core police powers have always included authority to define criminal law and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens. <i>Brecht</i> v. <i>Abrahamson,</i> 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993); <i>Whalen</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 429 U. S. 589, 603, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> n. 30 (1977). Exercising those powers, California (by ballot initiative and then by legislative codification) has come to its own conclusion about the difficult and sensitive question of whether marijuana should be available to relieve severe pain and suffering. Today the Court sanctions an application of the federal Controlled Substances Act that extinguishes that experiment, without any proof that the personal cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, if economic activity in the first place, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce and is therefore an appropriate subject of federal regulation. In so doing, the Court announces a rule that gives Congress a perverse incentive to legislate broadly pursuant to the Commerce Clause  nestling questionable assertions of its authority into comprehensive regulatory schemes  rather than with precision. That rule and the result it produces in this case are irreconcilable with our decisions in <i>Lopez, supra,</i> and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S. 598 (2000). Accordingly I dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Lopez,</i> we considered the constitutionality of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a federal offense \"for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm ... at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone,\" 18 U. S. C. § 922(q)(2)(A). We explained that \"Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce ..., <i>i. e.,</i> those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\" 514 U. S., at 558-559 (citation omitted). This power derives from the conjunction of the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</i> 469 U. S. 528, 585-586 (1985) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (explaining that <i>United States</i> v. <i>Darby,</i> 312 U. S. 100 (1941), <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wrightwood Dairy Co.,</i> 315 U. S. 110 (1942), and <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn,</i> 317 U. S. 111 (1942), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> based their expansion of the commerce power on the Necessary and Proper Clause, and that \"the reasoning of these cases underlies every recent decision concerning the reach of Congress to activities affecting interstate commerce\"); <i>ante,</i> at 34 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). We held in <i>Lopez</i> that the Gun-Free School Zones Act could not be sustained as an exercise of that power.</p>\n<p>Our decision about whether gun possession in school zones substantially affected interstate commerce turned on four considerations. <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 559-567; see also <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 609-613. First, we observed that our \"substantial effects\" cases generally have upheld federal regulation of economic activity that affected interstate commerce, but that § 922(q) was a criminal statute having \"nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise.\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 561. In this regard, we also noted that \"[s]ection 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Second, we noted that the statute contained no express jurisdictional requirement establishing its connection to interstate commerce. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Third, we found telling the absence of legislative findings about the regulated conduct's impact on interstate commerce. We explained that while express legislative findings are neither required nor, when provided, dispositive, findings \"enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affect[s] interstate commerce, even though no such substantial effect [is] visible to the naked eye.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 563. Finally, we rejected as too attenuated the Government's argument that firearm possession in school zones could result in violent crime which in turn could <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> adversely affect the national economy. <i>Id.,</i> at 563-567. The Constitution, we said, does not tolerate reasoning that would \"convert congressional authority under the Commerce Clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 567. Later in <i>Morrison, supra,</i> we relied on the same four considerations to hold that § 40302 of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 1941, 42 U. S. C. § 13981, exceeded Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>In my view, the case before us is materially indistinguishable from <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> when the same considerations are taken into account.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>What is the relevant conduct subject to Commerce Clause analysis in this case? The Court takes its cues from Congress, applying the above considerations to the activity regulated by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in general. The Court's decision rests on two facts about the CSA: (1) Congress chose to enact a single statute providing a comprehensive prohibition on the production, distribution, and possession of all controlled substances, and (2) Congress did not distinguish between various forms of intrastate noncommercial cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana. See 21 U. S. C. §§ 841(a)(1), 844(a). Today's decision suggests that the federal regulation of local activity is immune to Commerce Clause challenge because Congress chose to act with an ambitious, all-encompassing statute, rather than piecemeal. In my view, allowing Congress to set the terms of the constitutional debate in this way, <i>i. e.,</i> by packaging regulation of local activity in broader schemes, is tantamount to removing meaningful limits on the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>The Court's principal means of distinguishing <i>Lopez</i> from this case is to observe that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was a \"brief, single-subject statute,\" <i>ante,</i> at 23, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> whereas the CSA is \"a lengthy and detailed statute creating a comprehensive framework for regulating the production, distribution, and possession of five classes of `controlled substances,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 24. Thus, according to the Court, it was possible in <i>Lopez</i> to evaluate in isolation the constitutionality of criminalizing local activity (there gun possession in school zones), whereas the local activity that the CSA targets (in this case cultivation and possession of marijuana for personal medicinal use) cannot be separated from the general drug control scheme of which it is a part.</p>\n<p>Today's decision allows Congress to regulate intrastate activity without check, so long as there is some implication by legislative design that regulating intrastate activity is essential (and the Court appears to equate \"essential\" with \"necessary\") to the interstate regulatory scheme. Seizing upon our language in <i>Lopez</i> that the statute prohibiting gun possession in school zones was \"not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated,\" 514 U. S., at 561, the Court appears to reason that the placement of local activity in a comprehensive scheme confirms that it is essential to that scheme. <i>Ante,</i> at 24-25. If the Court is right, then <i>Lopez</i> stands for nothing more than a drafting guide: Congress should have described the relevant crime as \"transfer or possession of a firearm anywhere in the nation\"  thus including commercial and noncommercial activity, and clearly encompassing some activity with assuredly substantial effect on interstate commerce. Had it done so, the majority hints, we would have sustained its authority to regulate possession of firearms in school zones. Furthermore, today's decision suggests we would readily sustain a congressional decision to attach the regulation of intrastate activity to a pre-existing comprehensive (or even not-so-comprehensive) scheme. If so, the Court invites increased federal regulation of local activity even if, as it suggests, Congress would not enact a <i>new</i> interstate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> scheme exclusively for the sake of reaching intrastate activity, see <i>ante,</i> at 25, n. 34; <i>ante,</i> at 38-39 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>I cannot agree that our decision in <i>Lopez</i> contemplated such evasive or overbroad legislative strategies with approval. Until today, such arguments have been made only in dissent. See <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S., at 657 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (given that Congress can regulate \"`an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity,'\" \"can Congress save the present law by including it, or much of it, in a broader `Safe Transport' or `Worker Safety' act?\"). <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> did not indicate that the constitutionality of federal regulation depends on superficial and formalistic distinctions. Likewise I did not understand our discussion of the role of courts in enforcing outer limits of the Commerce Clause for the sake of maintaining the federalist balance our Constitution requires, see <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 557; <i>id.,</i> at 578 (KENNEDY, J., concurring), as a signal to Congress to enact legislation that is more extensive and more intrusive into the domain of state power. If the Court always defers to Congress as it does today, little may be left to the notion of enumerated powers.</p>\n<p>The hard work for courts, then, is to identify objective markers for confining the analysis in Commerce Clause cases. Here, respondents challenge the constitutionality of the CSA as applied to them and those similarly situated. I agree with the Court that we must look beyond respondents' own activities. Otherwise, individual litigants could always exempt themselves from Commerce Clause regulation merely by pointing to the obvious  that their personal activities do not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See <i>Maryland</i> v. <i>Wirtz,</i> 392 U. S. 183, 193 (1968); <i>Wickard,</i> 317 U. S., at 127-128. The task is to identify a mode of analysis that allows Congress to regulate more than nothing (by declining to reduce each case to its litigants) and less than everything (by declining to let Congress set the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> terms of analysis). The analysis may not be the same in every case, for it depends on the regulatory scheme at issue and the federalism concerns implicated. See generally <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 567; <i>id.,</i> at 579 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>A number of objective markers are available to confine the scope of constitutional review here. Both federal and state legislation  including the CSA itself, the California Compassionate Use Act, and other state medical marijuana legislation  recognize that medical and nonmedical (<i>i. e.,</i> recreational) uses of drugs are realistically distinct and can be segregated, and regulate them differently. See 21 U. S. C. § 812; Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 11362.5 (West Supp. 2005); <i>ante,</i> at 5 (opinion of the Court). Respondents challenge only the application of the CSA to medicinal use of marijuana. Cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Raines,</i> 362 U. S. 17, 20-22 (1960) (describing our preference for as-applied rather than facial challenges). Moreover, because fundamental structural concerns about dual sovereignty animate our Commerce Clause cases, it is relevant that this case involves the interplay of federal and state regulation in areas of criminal law and social policy, where \"States lay claim by right of history and expertise.\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 583 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 617-619; <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 580 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\"The statute before us upsets the federal balance to a degree that renders it an unconstitutional assertion of the commerce power, and our intervention is required\"); cf. <i>Garcia,</i> 469 U. S., at 586 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (\"[S]tate autonomy is a relevant factor in assessing the means by which Congress exercises its powers\" under the Commerce Clause). California, like other States, has drawn on its reserved powers to distinguish the regulation of medicinal marijuana. To ascertain whether Congress' encroachment is constitutionally justified in this case, then, I would focus here on the personal cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> B</h2>\n<p>Having thus defined the relevant conduct, we must determine whether, under our precedents, the conduct is economic and, in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. Even if intrastate cultivation and possession of marijuana for one's own medicinal use can properly be characterized as economic, and I question whether it can, it has not been shown that such activity substantially affects interstate commerce. Similarly, it is neither self-evident nor demonstrated that regulating such activity is necessary to the interstate drug control scheme.</p>\n<p>The Court's definition of economic activity is breathtaking. It defines as economic any activity involving the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities. And it appears to reason that when an interstate market for a commodity exists, regulating the intrastate manufacture or possession of that commodity is constitutional either because that intrastate activity is itself economic, or because regulating it is a rational part of regulating its market. Putting to one side the problem endemic to the Court's opinion  the shift in focus from the activity at issue in this case to the entirety of what the CSA regulates, see <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 565 (\"depending on the level of generality, any activity can be looked upon as commercial\")  the Court's definition of economic activity for purposes of Commerce Clause jurisprudence threatens to sweep all of productive human activity into federal regulatory reach.</p>\n<p>The Court uses a dictionary definition of economics to skirt the real problem of drawing a meaningful line between \"what is national and what is local,\" <i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel,</i> 301 U. S., at 37. It will not do to say that Congress may regulate noncommercial activity simply because it may have an effect on the demand for commercial goods, or because the noncommercial endeavor can, in some sense, substitute for commercial activity. Most commercial goods or services have some sort of privately producible analogue. Home care <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> substitutes for daycare. Charades games substitute for movie tickets. Backyard or windowsill gardening substitutes for going to the supermarket. To draw the line wherever private activity affects the demand for market goods is to draw no line at all, and to declare everything economic. We have already rejected the result that would follow  a federal police power. <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 564.</p>\n<p>In <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> we suggested that economic activity usually relates directly to commercial activity. See <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S., at 611, n. 4 (intrastate activities that have been within Congress' power to regulate have been \"of an apparent commercial character\"); <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 561 (distinguishing the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 from \"activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction\"). The homegrown cultivation and personal possession and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes has no apparent commercial character. Everyone agrees that the marijuana at issue in this case was never in the stream of commerce, and neither were the supplies for growing it. (Marijuana is highly unusual among the substances subject to the CSA in that it can be cultivated without any materials that have traveled in interstate commerce.) <i>Lopez</i> makes clear that possession is not itself commercial activity. <i>Ibid.</i> And respondents have not come into possession by means of any commercial transaction; they have simply grown, in their own homes, marijuana for their own use, without acquiring, buying, selling, or bartering a thing of value. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 583 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\"The statute now before us forecloses the States from experimenting ... and it does so by regulating an activity beyond the realm of commerce in the ordinary and usual sense of that term\").</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that <i>Wickard,</i> which we have identified as \"perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity,\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 560, established federal regulatory power over any home consumption of a commodity for which a national market exists. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> I disagree. <i>Wickard</i> involved a challenge to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (AAA), which directed the Secretary of Agriculture to set national quotas on wheat production, and penalties for excess production. 317 U. S., at 115-116. The AAA itself confirmed that Congress made an explicit choice not to reach  and thus the Court could not possibly have approved of federal control over  small-scale, noncommercial wheat farming. In contrast to the CSA's limitless assertion of power, Congress provided an exemption within the AAA for small producers. When Filburn planted the wheat at issue in <i>Wickard,</i> the statute exempted plantings less than 200 bushels (about six tons), and when he harvested his wheat it exempted plantings less than six acres. <i>Id.,</i> at 130, n. 30. <i>Wickard,</i> then, did not extend Commerce Clause authority to something as modest as the home cook's herb garden. This is not to say that Congress may never regulate small quantities of commodities possessed or produced for personal use, or to deny that it sometimes needs to enact a zero tolerance regime for such commodities. It is merely to say that <i>Wickard</i> did not hold or imply that small-scale production of commodities is always economic, and automatically within Congress' reach.</p>\n<p>Even assuming that economic activity is at issue in this case, the Government has made no showing in fact that the possession and use of homegrown marijuana for medical purposes, in California or elsewhere, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Similarly, the Government has not shown that regulating such activity is necessary to an interstate regulatory scheme. Whatever the specific theory of \"substantial effects\" at issue (<i>i. e.,</i> whether the activity substantially affects interstate commerce, whether its regulation is necessary to an interstate regulatory scheme, or both), a concern for dual sovereignty requires that Congress' excursion into the traditional domain of States be justified.</p>\n<p>That is why characterizing this as a case about the Necessary and Proper Clause does not change the analysis significantly. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> Congress must exercise its authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause in a manner consistent with basic constitutional principles. <i>Garcia,</i> 469 U. S., at 585 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (\"It is not enough that the `end be legitimate'; the means to that end chosen by Congress must not contravene the spirit of the Constitution\"). As JUSTICE SCALIA recognizes, see <i>ante,</i> at 39 (opinion concurring in judgment), Congress cannot use its authority under the Clause to contravene the principle of state sovereignty embodied in the Tenth Amendment. Likewise, that authority must be used in a manner consistent with the notion of enumerated powers  a structural principle that is as much part of the Constitution as the Tenth Amendment's explicit textual command. Accordingly, something more than mere assertion is required when Congress purports to have power over local activity whose connection to an interstate market is not self-evident. Otherwise, the Necessary and Proper Clause will always be a back door for unconstitutional federal regulation. Cf. <i>Printz</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 521 U. S. 898, 923 (1997) (the Necessary and Proper Clause is \"the last, best hope of those who defend ultra vires congressional action\"). Indeed, if it were enough in \"substantial effects\" cases for the Court to supply conceivable justifications for intrastate regulation related to an interstate market, then we could have surmised in <i>Lopez</i> that guns in school zones are \"never more than an instant from the interstate market\" in guns already subject to extensive federal regulation, <i>ante,</i> at 40 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), recast <i>Lopez</i> as a Necessary and Proper Clause case, and thereby upheld the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. (According to the Court's and the concurrence's logic, for example, the <i>Lopez</i> court should have reasoned that the prohibition on gun possession in school zones could be an appropriate means of effectuating a related prohibition on \"sell[ing]\" or \"deliver[ing]\" firearms or ammunition to \"any individual who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe is less than <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> eighteen years of age.\" 18 U. S. C. § 922(b)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. II).)</p>\n<p>There is simply no evidence that homegrown medicinal marijuana users constitute, in the aggregate, a sizable enough class to have a discernable, let alone substantial, impact on the national illicit drug market  or otherwise to threaten the CSA regime. Explicit evidence is helpful when substantial effect is not \"visible to the naked eye.\" See <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 563. And here, in part because common sense suggests that medical marijuana users may be limited in number and that California's Compassionate Use Act and similar state legislation may well isolate activities relating to medicinal marijuana from the illicit market, the effect of those activities on interstate drug traffic is not self-evidently substantial.</p>\n<p>In this regard, again, this case is readily distinguishable from <i>Wickard.</i> To decide whether the Secretary could regulate local wheat farming, the Court looked to \"the actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate commerce.\" 317 U. S., at 120. Critically, the Court was able to consider \"actual effects\" because the parties had \"stipulated a summary of the economics of the wheat industry.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 125. After reviewing in detail the picture of the industry provided in that summary, the Court explained that consumption of homegrown wheat was the most variable factor in the size of the national wheat crop, and that on-site consumption could have the effect of varying the amount of wheat sent to market by as much as 20 percent. <i>Id.,</i> at 127. With real numbers at hand, the <i>Wickard</i> Court could easily conclude that \"a factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions\" nationwide. <i>Id.,</i> at 128; see also <i>id.,</i> at 128-129 (\"This record leaves us in no doubt\" about substantial effects).</p>\n<p>The Court recognizes that \"the record in the <i>Wickard</i> case itself established the causal connection between the production <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> for local use and the national market\" and argues that \"we have before us findings by Congress <i>to the same effect.</i>\" <i>Ante,</i> at 20 (emphasis added). The Court refers to a series of declarations in the introduction to the CSA saying that (1) local distribution and possession of controlled substances causes \"swelling\" in interstate traffic; (2) local production and distribution cannot be distinguished from interstate production and distribution; (3) federal control over intrastate incidents \"is essential to the effective control\" over interstate drug trafficking. 21 U. S. C. §§ 801(1)-(6). These bare declarations cannot be compared to the record before the Court in <i>Wickard.</i></p>\n<p>They amount to nothing more than a legislative insistence that the regulation of controlled substances must be absolute. They are asserted without any supporting evidence  descriptive, statistical, or otherwise. \"[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so.\" <i>Hodel</i> v. <i>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,</i> 452 U. S. 264, 311 (1981) (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in judgment). Indeed, if declarations like these suffice to justify federal regulation, and if the Court today is right about what passes rationality review before us, then our decision in <i>Morrison</i> should have come out the other way. In that case, Congress had supplied numerous findings regarding the impact gender-motivated violence had on the national economy. 529 U. S., at 614; <i>id.,</i> at 628-636 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (chronicling findings). But, recognizing that \"`\"[w]hether particular operations affect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the constitutional power of Congress to regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question,\"'\" we found Congress' detailed findings inadequate. <i>Id.,</i> at 614 (quoting <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 557, n. 2, in turn quoting <i>Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 379 U. S. 241, 273 (1964) (Black, J., concurring)). If, as the Court claims, today's decision does not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> break with precedent, how can it be that voluminous findings, documenting extensive hearings about the specific topic of violence against women, did not pass constitutional muster in <i>Morrison,</i> while the CSA's abstract, unsubstantiated, generalized findings about controlled substances do?</p>\n<p>In particular, the CSA's introductory declarations are too vague and unspecific to demonstrate that the federal statutory scheme will be undermined if Congress cannot exert power over individuals like respondents. The declarations are not even specific to marijuana. (Facts about substantial effects may be developed in litigation to compensate for the inadequacy of Congress' findings; in part because this case comes to us from the grant of a preliminary injunction, there has been no such development.) Because here California, like other States, has carved out a limited class of activity for distinct regulation, the inadequacy of the CSA's findings is especially glaring. The California Compassionate Use Act exempts from other state drug laws patients and their caregivers \"who posses[s] or cultivat[e] marijuana for the <i>personal</i> medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician\" to treat a list of serious medical conditions. Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §§ 11362.5(d), 11362.7(h) (West Supp. 2005) (emphasis added). Compare <i>ibid.</i> with, <i>e. g.,</i> § 11357(b) (West 1991) (criminalizing marijuana possession in excess of 28.5 grams); § 11358 (criminalizing marijuana cultivation). The Act specifies that it should not be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in acts dangerous to others, or to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes. § 11362.5(b)(2) (West Supp. 2005). To promote the Act's operation and to facilitate law enforcement, California recently enacted an identification card system for qualified patients. §§ 11362.7-11362.83. We generally assume States enforce their laws, see <i>Riley</i> v. <i>National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc.,</i> 487 U. S. 781, 795 (1988), and have no reason to think otherwise here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> The Government has not overcome empirical doubt that the number of Californians engaged in personal cultivation, possession, and use of medical marijuana, or the amount of marijuana they produce, is enough to threaten the federal regime. Nor has it shown that Compassionate Use Act marijuana users have been or are realistically likely to be responsible for the drug's seeping into the market in a significant way. The Government does cite one estimate that there were over 100,000 Compassionate Use Act users in California in 2004, Reply Brief for Petitioners 16, but does not explain, in terms of proportions, what their presence means for the national illicit drug market. See generally <i>Wirtz,</i> 392 U. S., at 196, n. 27 (Congress cannot use \"a relatively trivial impact on commerce as an excuse for broad general regulation of state or private activities\"); cf. General Accounting Office, Marijuana: Early Experiences with Four States' Laws That Allow Use for Medical Purposes 21-23 (Rep. No. 03-189, Nov. 2002), http://www.gao.gov/new.items/ d03189.pdf (as visited June 3, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (in four California counties before the identification card system was enacted, voluntarily registered medical marijuana patients were less than 0.5 percent of the population; in Alaska, Hawaii, and Oregon, statewide medical marijuana registrants represented less than 0.05 percent of the States' populations). It also provides anecdotal evidence about the CSA's enforcement. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 17-18. The Court also offers some arguments about the effect of the Compassionate Use Act on the national market. It says that the California statute might be vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous physicians, that Compassionate Use Act patients may overproduce, and that the history of the narcotics trade shows the difficulty of cordoning off any drug use from the rest of the market. These arguments are plausible; if borne out in fact they could justify prosecuting Compassionate Use Act patients under the federal CSA. But, without substantiation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> they add little to the CSA's conclusory statements about diversion, essentiality, and market effect. Piling assertion upon assertion does not, in my view, satisfy the substantiality test of <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We would do well to recall how James Madison, the father of the Constitution, described our system of joint sovereignty to the people of New York: \"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.... The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.\" The Federalist No. 45, pp. 292-293 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).</p>\n<p>Relying on Congress' abstract assertions, the Court has endorsed making it a federal crime to grow small amounts of marijuana in one's own home for one's own medicinal use. This overreaching stifles an express choice by some States, concerned for the lives and liberties of their people, to regulate medical marijuana differently. If I were a California citizen, I would not have voted for the medical marijuana ballot initiative; if I were a California legislator I would not have supported the Compassionate Use Act. But whatever the wisdom of California's experiment with medical marijuana, the federalism principles that have driven our Commerce Clause cases require that room for experiment be protected in this case. For these reasons I dissent.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Respondents Diane Monson and Angel Raich use marijuana that has never been bought or sold, that has never crossed state lines, and that has had no demonstrable effect on the national market for marijuana. If Congress can regulate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> this under the Commerce Clause, then it can regulate virtually anything  and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Respondents' local cultivation and consumption of marijuana is not \"Commerce ... among the several States.\" U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. By holding that Congress may regulate activity that is neither interstate nor commerce under the Interstate Commerce Clause, the Court abandons any attempt to enforce the Constitution's limits on federal power. The majority supports this conclusion by invoking, without explanation, the Necessary and Proper Clause. Regulating respondents' conduct, however, is not \"necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\" Congress' restrictions on the interstate drug trade. Art. I, § 8, cl. 18. Thus, neither the Commerce Clause nor the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to regulate respondents' conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As I explained at length in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S. 549 (1995), the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate the buying and selling of goods and services trafficked across state lines. <i>Id.,</i> at 586-589 (concurring opinion). The Clause's text, structure, and history all indicate that, at the time of the founding, the term \"`commerce' consisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these purposes.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 585 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Commerce, or trade, stood in contrast to productive activities like manufacturing and agriculture. <i>Id.,</i> at 586-587 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Throughout founding-era dictionaries, Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention, The Federalist Papers, and the ratification debates, the term \"commerce\" is consistently used to mean trade or exchange  not all economic or gainful activity that has some attenuated connection to trade or exchange. <i>Ibid.</i> (THOMAS, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> J., concurring); Barnett, The Original Meaning of the Commerce Clause, 68 U. Chi. L. Rev. 101, 112-125 (2001). The term \"commerce\" commonly meant trade or exchange (and shipping for these purposes) not simply to those involved in the drafting and ratification processes, but also to the general public. Barnett, New Evidence of the Original Meaning of the Commerce Clause, 55 Ark. L. Rev. 847, 857-862 (2003).</p>\n<p>Even the majority does not argue that respondents' conduct is itself \"Commerce among the several States,\" Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. <i>Ante,</i> at 22. Monson and Raich neither buy nor sell the marijuana that they consume. They cultivate their cannabis entirely in the State of California  it never crosses state lines, much less as part of a commercial transaction. Certainly no evidence from the founding suggests that \"commerce\" included the mere possession of a good or some purely personal activity that did not involve trade or exchange for value. In the early days of the Republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, possession, and consumption of marijuana.</p>\n<p>On this traditional understanding of \"commerce,\" the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U. S. C. § 801 <i>et seq.,</i> regulates a great deal of marijuana trafficking that is interstate and commercial in character. The CSA does not, however, criminalize only the interstate buying and selling of marijuana. Instead, it bans the entire market  intrastate or interstate, noncommercial or commercial  for marijuana. Respondents are correct that the CSA exceeds Congress' commerce power as applied to their conduct, which is purely intrastate and noncommercial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>More difficult, however, is whether the CSA is a valid exercise of Congress' power to enact laws that are \"necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\" its power to regulate interstate commerce. Art. I, § 8, cl. 18. The Necessary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> and Proper Clause is not a warrant to Congress to enact any law that bears some conceivable connection to the exercise of an enumerated power.<sup>[1]</sup> Nor is it, however, a command to Congress to enact only laws that are absolutely indispensable to the exercise of an enumerated power.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), this Court, speaking through Chief Justice Marshall, set forth a test for determining when an Act of Congress is permissible under the Necessary and Proper Clause:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 421.</blockquote>\n<p>To act under the Necessary and Proper Clause, then, Congress must select a means that is \"appropriate\" and \"plainly adapted\" to executing an enumerated power; the means cannot be otherwise \"prohibited\" by the Constitution; and the means cannot be inconsistent with \"the letter and spirit of the [C]onstitution.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The First Hundred Years 1789-1888, pp. 163-164 (1985). The CSA, as applied to respondents' conduct, is not a valid exercise of Congress' power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Congress has exercised its power over interstate commerce to criminalize trafficking in marijuana across state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> lines. The Government contends that banning Monson and Raich's intrastate drug activity is \"necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\" its regulation of interstate drug trafficking. Art. I, § 8, cl. 18. See 21 U. S. C. § 801(6). However, in order to be \"necessary,\" the intrastate ban must be more than \"a reasonable means [of] effectuat[ing] the regulation of interstate commerce.\" Brief for Petitioners 14; see <i>ante,</i> at 22 (majority opinion) (employing rational-basis review). It must be \"plainly adapted\" to regulating interstate marijuana trafficking  in other words, there must be an \"obvious, simple, and direct relation\" between the intrastate ban and the regulation of interstate commerce. <i>Sabri</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 541 U. S. 600, 613 (2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Dewitt,</i> 9 Wall. 41, 44 (1870) (finding ban on intrastate sale of lighting oils not \"appropriate and plainly adapted means for carrying into execution\" Congress' taxing power).</p>\n<p>On its face, a ban on the intrastate cultivation, possession, and distribution of marijuana may be plainly adapted to stopping the interstate flow of marijuana. Unregulated local growers and users could swell both the supply and the demand sides of the interstate marijuana market, making the market more difficult to regulate. <i>Ante,</i> at 12-13, 22 (majority opinion). But respondents do not challenge the CSA on its face. Instead, they challenge it as applied to their conduct. The question is thus whether the intrastate ban is \"necessary and proper\" as applied to medical marijuana users like respondents.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Respondents are not regulable simply because they belong to a large class (local growers and users of marijuana) that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> Congress might need to reach, if they also belong to a distinct and separable subclass (local growers and users of state-authorized, medical marijuana) that does not undermine the CSA's interstate ban. <i>Ante,</i> at 47-48 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). The Court of Appeals found that respondents' \"limited use is clearly distinct from the broader illicit drug market,\" because \"th[eir] medicinal marijuana . . . is not intended for, nor does it enter, the stream of commerce.\" <i>Raich</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 352 F. 3d 1222, 1228 (CA9 2003). If that is generally true of individuals who grow and use marijuana for medical purposes under state law, then even assuming Congress has \"obvious\" and \"plain\" reasons why regulating intrastate cultivation and possession is necessary to regulating the interstate drug trade, none of those reasons applies to medical marijuana patients like Monson and Raich.</p>\n<p>California's Compassionate Use Act sets respondents' conduct apart from other intrastate producers and users of marijuana. The Act channels marijuana use to \"seriously ill Californians,\" Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 11362.5(b)(1)(A) (West Supp. 2005), and prohibits \"the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes,\" § 11362.5(b)(2).<sup>[4]</sup> California strictly controls the cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes. To be eligible for its program, California requires that a patient have an illness that cannabis can relieve, such as cancer, AIDS, or arthritis, § 11362.5(b)(1)(A), and that he obtain a physician's recommendation or approval, § 11362.5(d). Qualified patients must provide personal and medical information to obtain medical identification cards, and there is a statewide registry of cardholders. §§ 11362.XXX-XXXXX.76. Moreover, the Medical Board of California has issued guidelines for physicians' cannabis recommendations, and it sanctions physicians who do not comply with the guidelines. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> See, <i>e. g., </i><i>People</i> v. <i>Spark,</i> 121 Cal. App. 4th 259, 263, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 840, 843 (2004).</p>\n<p>This class of intrastate users is therefore distinguishable from others. We normally presume that States enforce their own laws, <i>Riley</i> v. <i>National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc.,</i> 487 U.S. 781, 795 (1988), and there is no reason to depart from that presumption here: Nothing suggests that California's controls are ineffective. The scant evidence that exists suggests that few people  the vast majority of whom are aged 40 or older  register to use medical marijuana. General Accounting Office, Marijuana: Early Experiences with Four States' Laws That Allow Use for Medical Purposes 22-23 (Rep. No. 03-189, Nov. 2002), http://www. gao.gov/new.items/d03189.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 3, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). In part because of the low incidence of medical marijuana use, many law enforcement officials report that the introduction of medical marijuana laws has not affected their law enforcement efforts. <i>Id.,</i> at 32.</p>\n<p>These controls belie the Government's assertion that placing medical marijuana outside the CSA's reach \"would prevent effective enforcement of the interstate ban on drug trafficking.\" Brief for Petitioners 33. Enforcement of the CSA can continue as it did prior to the Compassionate Use Act. Only now, a qualified patient could avoid arrest or prosecution by presenting his identification card to law enforcement officers. In the event that a qualified patient is arrested for possession or his cannabis is seized, he could seek to prove as an affirmative defense that, in conformity with state law, he possessed or cultivated small quantities of marijuana intrastate solely for personal medical use. <i>People</i> v. <i>Mower,</i> 28 Cal. 4th 457, 469-470, 49 P. 3d 1067, 1073-1075 (2002); <i>People</i> v. <i>Trippet,</i> 56 Cal. App. 4th 1532, 1549, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 559, 560 (1997). Moreover, under the CSA, certain drugs that present a high risk of abuse and addiction but that nevertheless have an accepted medical use  drugs like morphine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> and amphetamines  are available by prescription. 21 U. S. C. §§ 812(b)(2)(A)-(B); 21 CFR § 1308.12 (2004). No one argues that permitting use of these drugs under medical supervision has undermined the CSA's restrictions.</p>\n<p>But even assuming that States' controls allow some seepage of medical marijuana into the illicit drug market, there is a multibillion-dollar interstate market for marijuana. Executive Office of the President, Office of Nat. Drug Control Policy, Marijuana Fact Sheet 5 (Feb. 2004), http://www. whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/marijuana/ index.html. It is difficult to see how this vast market could be affected by diverted medical cannabis, let alone in a way that makes regulating intrastate medical marijuana obviously essential to controlling the interstate drug market.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Congress declared that state policy would disrupt federal law enforcement. It believed the across-the-board ban essential to policing interstate drug trafficking. 21 U.S.C. § 801(6). But as JUSTICE O'CONNOR points out, Congress presented no evidence in support of its conclusions, which are not so much findings of fact as assertions of power. <i>Ante,</i> at 53-55 (dissenting opinion). Congress cannot define the scope of its own power merely by declaring the necessity of its enactments.</p>\n<p>In sum, neither in enacting the CSA nor in defending its application to respondents has the Government offered any obvious reason why banning medical marijuana use is necessary to stem the tide of interstate drug trafficking. Congress' goal of curtailing the interstate drug trade would not plainly be thwarted if it could not apply the CSA to patients like Monson and Raich. That is, unless Congress' aim is really to exercise police power of the sort reserved to the States in order to eliminate even the intrastate possession and use of marijuana.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Even assuming the CSA's ban on locally cultivated and consumed marijuana is \"necessary,\" that does not mean it is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> also \"proper.\" The means selected by Congress to regulate interstate commerce cannot be \"prohibited\" by, or inconsistent with the \"letter and spirit\" of, the Constitution. <i>McCulloch,</i> 4 Wheat., at 421.</p>\n<p>In <i>Lopez,</i> I argued that allowing Congress to regulate intrastate, noncommercial activity under the Commerce Clause would confer on Congress a general \"police power\" over the Nation. 514 U.S., at 584, 600 (concurring opinion). This is no less the case if Congress ties its power to the Necessary and Proper Clause rather than the Commerce Clause. When agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration raided Monson's home, they seized six cannabis plants. If the Federal Government can regulate growing a half-dozen cannabis plants for personal consumption (not because it is interstate commerce, but because it is inextricably bound up with interstate commerce), then Congress' Article I powers  as expanded by the Necessary and Proper Clause  have no meaningful limits. Whether Congress aims at the possession of drugs, guns, or any number of other items, it may continue to \"appropriat[e] state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S. 598, 627 (2000) (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Even if Congress may regulate purely intrastate activity when essential to exercising some enumerated power, see <i>Dewitt,</i> 9 Wall., at 44; but see Barnett, The Original Meaning of the Necessary and Proper Clause, 6 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 183, 186 (2003) (detailing statements by Founders that the Necessary and Proper Clause was not intended to expand the scope of Congress' enumerated powers), Congress may not use its incidental authority to subvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty. <i>Printz</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 521 U. S. 898, 923-924 (1997); <i>Alden</i> v. <i>Maine,</i> 527 U. S. 706, 732-733 (1999); <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</i> 469 U. S. 528, 585 (1985) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); The Federalist No. 33, pp. 204-205 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (hereinafter The Federalist).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> Here, Congress has encroached on States' traditional police powers to define the criminal law and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Brecht</i> v. <i>Abrahamson,</i> 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993); <i>Hillsborough County</i> v. <i>Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 471 U. S. 707, 719 (1985). Further, the Government's rationale  that it may regulate the production or possession of any commodity for which there is an interstate market  threatens to remove the remaining vestiges of States' traditional police powers. See Brief for Petitioners 21-22; cf. Ehrlich, The Increasing Federalization of Crime, 32 Ariz. St. L. J. 825, 826, 841 (2000) (describing both the relative recency of a large percentage of federal crimes and the lack of a relationship between some of these crimes and interstate commerce). This would convert the Necessary and Proper Clause into precisely what Chief Justice Marshall did not envision, a \"pretext . . . for the accomplishment of objects not intrusted to the government.\" <i>McCulloch, supra,</i> at 423.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> II</h2>\n<p>The majority advances three reasons why the CSA is a legitimate exercise of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause: First, respondents' conduct, taken in the aggregate, may substantially affect interstate commerce, <i>ante,</i> at 22; second, regulation of respondents' conduct is essential to regulating the interstate marijuana market, <i>ante,</i> at 24-25; and, third, regulation of respondents' conduct is incidental to regulating the interstate marijuana market, <i>ante,</i> at 22. JUSTICE O'CONNOR explains why the majority's reasons cannot be reconciled with our recent Commerce Clause jurisprudence. The majority's justifications, however, suffer from even more fundamental flaws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The majority holds that Congress may regulate intrastate cultivation and possession of medical marijuana under the Commerce Clause, because such conduct arguably has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The majority's decision is further proof that the \"substantial effects\" test is a \"rootless and malleable standard\" at odds with the constitutional design. <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 627 (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>The majority's treatment of the substantial effects test is rootless, because it is not tethered to either the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause. Under the Commerce Clause, Congress may regulate interstate commerce, not activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, any more than activities that do not fall within, but that affect, the subjects of its other Article I powers. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 589 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Whatever additional latitude the Necessary and Proper Clause affords, <i>supra,</i> at 65-66, the question is whether Congress' legislation is essential to the regulation of interstate commerce itself  not whether the legislation extends only to economic <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. <i>Supra,</i> at 60-61; <i>ante,</i> at 37 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>The majority's treatment of the substantial effects test is malleable, because the majority expands the relevant conduct. By defining the class at a high level of generality (as the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana), the majority overlooks that individuals authorized by state law to manufacture and possess medical marijuana exert no demonstrable effect on the interstate drug market. <i>Supra,</i> at 64. The majority ignores that whether a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce  and thus comes within Congress' reach on the majority's approach  can turn on a number of objective factors, like state action or features of the regulated activity itself. <i>Ante,</i> at 47-48 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). For instance, here, if California and other States are effectively regulating medical marijuana users, then these users have little effect on the interstate drug trade.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The substantial effects test is easily manipulated for another reason. This Court has never held that Congress can <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> regulate noneconomic activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S., at 613 (\"[T]hus far in our Nation's history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is <i>economic</i> in nature\" (emphasis added)); <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 560. To evade even that modest restriction on federal power, the majority defines economic activity in the broadest possible terms as the \"`the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities.'\"<sup>[7]</sup><i>Ante,</i> at 25 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 720 (1966) (hereinafter Webster's 3d)). This carves out a vast swath of activities that are subject to federal regulation. See <i>ante,</i> at 49-50 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). If the majority is to be taken seriously, the Federal Government may now regulate quilting bees, clothes drives, and potluck suppers throughout the 50 States. This makes a mockery of Madison's assurance to the people of New York that the \"powers delegated\" to the Federal Government are \"few and defined,\" while those of the States are \"numerous and indefinite.\" The Federalist No. 45, at 313 (J. Madison).</p>\n<p>Moreover, even a Court interested more in the modern than the original understanding of the Constitution ought to resolve cases based on the meaning of words that are actually in the document. Congress is authorized to regulate \"Commerce,\" and respondents' conduct does not qualify under any definition of that term.<sup>[8]</sup> The majority's opinion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> only illustrates the steady drift away from the text of the Commerce Clause. There is an inexorable expansion from \"`[c]ommerce,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 5, to \"commercial\" and \"economic\" activity, <i>ante,</i> at 23, and finally to all \"production, distribution, and consumption\" of goods or services for which there is an \"established . . . interstate market,\" <i>ante,</i> at 26. Federal power expands, but never contracts, with each new locution. The majority is not interpreting the Commerce Clause, but rewriting it.</p>\n<p>The majority's rewriting of the Commerce Clause seems to be rooted in the belief that, unless the Commerce Clause covers the entire web of human activity, Congress will be left powerless to regulate the national economy effectively. <i>Ante,</i> at 18-19; <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 573-574 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). The interconnectedness of economic activity is not a modern phenomenon unfamiliar to the Framers. <i>Id.,</i> at 590-593 (THOMAS, J., concurring); Letter from J. Madison to S. Roane (Sept. 2, 1819), in 3 The Founders' Constitution 259-260 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987). Moreover, the Framers understood what the majority does not appear to fully appreciate: There is a danger to concentrating too much, as well as too little, power in the Federal Government. This Court has carefully avoided stripping Congress of its ability to regulate <i>inter</i>state commerce, but it has casually allowed the Federal Government to strip States of their ability to regulate <i>intra</i>state commerce  not to mention a host of local activities, like mere drug possession, that are not commercial.</p>\n<p>One searches the Court's opinion in vain for any hint of what aspect of American life is reserved to the States. Yet this Court knows that \"`[t]he Constitution created a Federal Government of limited powers.'\" <i>New York</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 505 U. S. 144, 155 (1992) (quoting <i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> 501 U. S. 452, 457 (1991)). That is why today's decision will add no measure of stability to our Commerce Clause jurisprudence: This Court is willing neither to enforce limits on federal power, nor to declare the Tenth Amendment a dead letter. If stability is possible, it is only by discarding the stand-alone substantial effects test and revisiting our definition of \"Commerce . . . among the several States.\" Congress may regulate interstate commerce  not things that affect it, even when summed together, unless truly \"necessary and proper\" to regulating interstate commerce.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The majority also inconsistently contends that regulating respondents' conduct is both incidental and essential to a comprehensive legislative scheme. <i>Ante,</i> at 22, 24-25. I have already explained why the CSA's ban on local activity is not essential. <i>Supra,</i> at 64. However, the majority further claims that, because the CSA covers a great deal of interstate commerce, it \"is of no moment\" if it also \"ensnares some purely intrastate activity.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 22. So long as Congress casts its net broadly over an interstate market, according to the majority, it is free to regulate interstate and intrastate activity alike. This cannot be justified under either the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause. If the activity is purely intrastate, then it may not be regulated under the Commerce Clause. And if the regulation of the intrastate activity is purely incidental, then it may not be regulated under the Necessary and Proper Clause.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the majority terms this the \"pivotal' distinction between the present case and <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison. Ante,</i> at 23. In <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the parties asserted facial challenges, claiming \"that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress' commerce power in its entirety.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 23. Here, by contrast, respondents claim only that the CSA falls outside Congress' commerce power as applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> to their individual conduct. According to the majority, while courts may set aside whole statutes or provisions, they may not \"excise individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 23; see also <i>Perez</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 402 U. S. 146, 154 (1971); <i>Maryland</i> v. <i>Wirtz,</i> 392 U. S. 183, 192-193 (1968).</p>\n<p>It is true that if respondents' conduct is part of a \"class of activities . . . and that class is within the reach of federal power,\" <i>Perez, supra,</i> at 154 (emphases deleted), then respondents may not point to the <i>de minimis</i> effect of their own personal conduct on the interstate drug market, <i>Wirtz, supra,</i> at 196, n. 27. <i>Ante,</i> at 47 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). But that begs the question at issue: whether respondents' \"class of activities\" is \"within the reach of federal power,\" which depends in turn on whether the class is defined at a low or a high level of generality. <i>Supra,</i> at 61-62. If medical marijuana patients like Monson and Raich largely stand outside the interstate drug market, then courts must excise them from the CSA's coverage. Congress expressly provided that if \"a provision [of the CSA] is held invalid in one of more of its <i>applications,</i> the provision shall remain in effect in all its valid applications that are severable.\" 21 U. S. C. § 901 (emphasis added); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U. S. 220, 320-321, and n. 9 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Even in the absence of an express severability provision, it is implausible that this Court could set aside entire portions of the United States Code as outside Congress' power in <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> but it cannot engage in the more restrained practice of invalidating particular applications of the CSA that are beyond Congress' power. This Court has regularly entertained as-applied challenges under constitutional provisions, see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Raines,</i> 362 U. S. 17, 20-21 (1960), including the Commerce Clause, see <i>Katzenbach</i> v. <i>McClung,</i> 379 U. S. 294, 295 (1964); <i>Heart of Atlanta</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> <i>Motel, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 379 U. S. 241, 249 (1964); <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn,</i> 317 U. S. 111, 113-114 (1942). There is no reason why, when Congress exceeds the scope of its commerce power, courts may not invalidate Congress' overreaching on a case-by-case basis. The CSA undoubtedly regulates a great deal of interstate commerce, but that is no license to regulate conduct that is neither interstate nor commercial, however minor or incidental.</p>\n<p>If the majority is correct that <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> are distinct because they were facial challenges to \"particular statute[s] or provision[s],\" <i>ante,</i> at 23, then congressional power turns on the manner in which Congress packages legislation. Under the majority's reasoning, Congress could not enact  either as a single-subject statute or as a separate provision in the CSA  a prohibition on the intrastate possession or cultivation of marijuana. Nor could it enact an intrastate ban simply to supplement existing drug regulations. However, that same prohibition is perfectly constitutional when integrated into a piece of legislation that reaches other regulable conduct. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 600-601 (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Finally, the majority's view  that because <i>some</i> of the CSA's applications are constitutional, they must <i>all</i> be constitutional  undermines its reliance on the substantial effects test. The intrastate conduct swept within a general regulatory scheme may or may not have a substantial effect on the relevant interstate market. \"[O]ne <i>always</i> can draw the circle broadly enough to cover an activity that, when taken in isolation, would not have substantial effects on commerce.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 600 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The breadth of legislation that Congress enacts says nothing about whether the intrastate activity substantially affects interstate commerce, let alone whether it is necessary to the scheme. Because medical marijuana users in California and elsewhere are not placing substantial amounts of cannabis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> into the stream of interstate commerce, Congress may not regulate them under the substantial effects test, no matter how broadly it drafts the CSA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The majority prevents States like California from devising drug policies that they have concluded provide much-needed respite to the seriously ill. It does so without any serious inquiry into the necessity for federal regulation or the propriety of \"displac[ing] state regulation in areas of traditional state concern,\" <i>id.,</i> at 583 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). The majority's rush to embrace federal power \"is especially unfortunate given the importance of showing respect for the sovereign States that comprise our Federal Union.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative,</i> 532 U. S. 483, 502 (2001) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Our federalist system, properly understood, allows California and a growing number of other States to decide for themselves how to safeguard the health and welfare of their citizens. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

After some fleeting success in 1988 when an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) declared that the DEA would be acting in an \"unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious\" manner if it continued to deny marijuana access to seriously ill patients, and concluded that it should be reclassified as a Schedule III substance, <i>Grinspoon</i> v. <i>DEA,</i> 828 F.2d 881, 883-884 (CA1 1987), the campaign has proved unsuccessful. The DEA Administrator did not endorse the ALJ's findings, 54 Fed. Reg. 53767 (1989), and since that time has routinely denied petitions to reschedule the drug, most recently in 2001. 66 Fed.

This first important federal resort to the commerce power was followed in 1890 by the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and, thereafter, mainly after 1903, by many others. These statutes ushered in new phases of adjudication, which required the Court to approach the interpretation of the Commerce Clause in the light of an actual exercise by Congress of its power thereunder\" (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p>[28]  Even respondents acknowledge the existence of an illicit market in marijuana; indeed, Raich has personally participated in that market, and Monson expresses a willingness to do so in the future. App. 59, 74, 87. See also <i>Department of Revenue of Mont.</i> v. <i>Kurth Ranch,</i> 511 U.

This difference, however, is of no constitutional import. It has long been settled that Congress' power to regulate commerce includes the power to prohibit commerce in a particular commodity. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 571 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\"In the <i>Lottery Case,</i> 188 U.

Office of Nat. Drug Control Policy, Marijuana Fact Sheet 5 (Feb. 2004), http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/marijuana/index.html.</p>\n<p>[32]  Moreover, as discussed in more detail above, Congress did make findings regarding the effects of intrastate drug activity on interstate commerce. See n. 20, <i>supra.</i> Indeed, even the Court of Appeals found that those findings \"weigh[ed] in favor\" of upholding the constitutionality of the CSA. 352 F.3d 1222, 1232 (CA9 2003) (case below). The dissenters, however, would impose a new and heightened burden on Congress (unless the litigants can garner evidence sufficient to cure Congress' perceived \"inadequa[cies]\")that legislation must contain detailed findings proving that each activity regulated within a comprehensive statute is essential to the statutory scheme. <i>Post,</i> at 53-55 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); <i>post,</i> at 64 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Such an exacting requirement is not only unprecedented, it is also impractical. Indeed, the principal dissent's critique of Congress for \"not even\" including \"declarations\" specific to marijuana is particularly unpersuasive given that the CSA initially identified 80 other substances subject to regulation as Schedule I drugs, not to mention those categorized in Schedules II-V. <i>Post,</i> at 55 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). Surely, Congress cannot be expected (and certainly should not be required) to include specific findings on each and every substance contained therein in order to satisfy the dissenters' unfounded skepticism.</p>\n<p>[33]  See n. 21, <i>supra</i> (citing sources that evince Congress' particular concern with the diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit channels).</p>\n<p>[34]  The principal dissent asserts that by \"[s]eizing upon our language in <i>Lopez,</i>\" <i>post,</i> at 46 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.), <i>i. e.,</i> giving effect to our well-established case law, Congress will now have an incentive to legislate broadly. Even putting aside the political checks that would generally curb Congress' power to enact a broad and comprehensive scheme for the purpose of targeting purely local activity, there is no suggestion that the CSA constitutes the type of \"evasive\" legislation the dissent fears, nor could such an argument plausibly be made. <i>Post,</i> at 47 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[35]  <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 560; see also <i>id.,</i> at 573-574 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (stating that <i>Lopez</i> did not alter our \"practical conception of commercial regulation\" and that Congress may \"regulate in the commercial sphere on the assumption that we have a single market and a unified purpose to build a stable national economy\").</p>\n<p>[36]  See 16 U. S. C. § 668(a) (bald and golden eagles); 18 U. S. C. § 175(a) (biological weapons); § 831(a) (nuclear material); § 842(n)(1) (certain plastic explosives); § 2342(a) (contraband cigarettes).</p>\n<p>[37]  We acknowledge that evidence proffered by respondents in this case regarding the effective medical uses for marijuana, if found credible after trial, would cast serious doubt on the accuracy of the findings that require marijuana to be listed in Schedule I. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Institute of Medicine, Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base 179 (J. Joy, S. Watson, &amp; J. Benson eds. 1999) (recognizing that \"[s]cientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs, primarily THC [Tetrahydrocannabinol] for pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation\"); see also <i>Conant</i> v. <i>Walters,</i> 309 F. 3d 629, 640-643 (CA9 2002) (Kozinski, J., concurring) (chronicling medical studies recognizing valid medical uses for marijuana and its derivatives). But the possibility that the drug may be reclassified in the future has no relevance to the question whether Congress now has the power to regulate its production and distribution. Respondents' submission, if accepted, would place all homegrown medical substances beyond the reach of Congress' regulatory jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>[38]  That is so even if California's current controls (enacted eight years after the Compassionate Use Act was passed) are \"effective,\" as the dissenters would have us blindly presume, <i>post,</i> at 53-54 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); <i>post,</i> at 63, 68 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). California's decision (made 34 years after the CSA was enacted) to impose \"stric[t] controls\" on the \"cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes,\" <i>post,</i> at 62 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), cannot retroactively divest Congress of its authority under the Commerce Clause. Indeed, JUSTICE THOMAS' urgings to the contrary would turn the Supremacy Clause on its head, and would resurrect limits on congressional power that have long since been rejected. See <i>post,</i> at 41 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting <i>Mc-Culloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 4 Wheat. 316, 424 (1819)) (\"`To impose on [Congress] the necessity of resorting to means which it cannot control, which another government may furnish or withhold, would render its course precarious, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a dependence on other governments, which might disappoint its most important designs, and is incompatible with the language of the constitution'\").\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, in addition to casting aside more than a century of this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence, it is noteworthy that JUSTICE THOMAS' suggestion that States possess the power to dictate the extent of Congress' commerce power would have far-reaching implications beyond the facts of this case. For example, under his reasoning, Congress would be equally powerless to regulate, let alone prohibit, the intrastate possession, cultivation, and use of marijuana for <i>recreational</i> purposes, an activity which all States \"strictly contro[l].\" Indeed, his rationale seemingly would require Congress to cede its constitutional power to regulate commerce whenever a State opts to exercise its \"traditional police powers to define the criminal law and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens.\" <i>Post,</i> at 66 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>[39]  California's Compassionate Use Act has since been amended, limiting the catchall category to \"[a]ny other chronic or persistent medical symptom that either: ... [s]ubstantially limits the ability of the person to conduct one or more major life activities as defined\" in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or \"[i]f not alleviated, may cause serious harm to the patient's safety or physical or mental health.\" Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §§ 11362.7(h)(12)(A)-(B) (West Supp. 2005).</p>\n<p>[40]  See, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Moore,</i> 423 U. S. 122 (1975); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Doremus,</i> 249 U. S. 86 (1919).</p>\n<p>[41]  The state policy allows patients to possess up to eight ounces of dried marijuana, and to cultivate up to 6 mature or 12 immature plants. Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 11362.77(a) (West Supp. 2005). However, the quantity limitations serve only as a floor. Based on a doctor's recommendation, a patient can possess whatever quantity is necessary to satisfy his medical needs, and cities and counties are given <i>carte blanche</i> to establish more generous limits. Indeed, several cities and counties have done just that. For example, patients residing in the cities of Oakland and Santa Cruz and in the counties of Sonoma and Tehama are permitted to possess up to 3 pounds of processed marijuana. Reply Brief for Petitioners 18-19 (citing Proposition 215 Enforcement Guidelines). Putting that quantity in perspective, 3 pounds of marijuana yields roughly 3,000 joints or cigarettes.

Yet as a resident of Oakland, she is entitled to possess up to 3 pounds of processed marijuana at any given time, nearly 20 times more than she uses on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>[43]  See, <i>e. g., </i><i>People ex rel.

S. 528, 584-585 (1985) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (explaining that it is through the Necessary and Proper Clause that \"an intrastate activity `affecting' interstate commerce can be reached through the commerce power\").</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn,</i> 317 U. S. 111 (1942), presented such a case. Because the unregulated production of wheat for personal consumption diminished demand in the regulated wheat market, the Court said, it carried with it the potential to disrupt Congress's price regulation by driving down prices in the market. <i>Id.,</i> at 127-129. This potential disruption of Congress's interstate regulation, and not only the effect that personal consumption of wheat had on interstate commerce, justified Congress's regulation of that conduct. <i>Id.,</i> at 128-129.</p>\n<p>[3]  The principal dissent claims that, if this is sufficient to sustain the regulation at issue in this case, then it should also have been sufficient to sustain the regulation at issue in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S. 549 (1995). See <i>post,</i> at 52 (arguing that \"we could have surmised in <i>Lopez</i> that guns in school zones are `never more than an instant from the interstate market' in guns already subject to extensive federal regulation, recast <i>Lopez</i> as a Necessary and Proper Clause case, and thereby upheld the Gun-Free School Zones Act\" (citation omitted)). This claim founders upon the shoals of <i>Lopez</i> itself, which made clear that the statute there at issue was \"<i>not</i> an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity.\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 561 (emphasis added). On the dissent's view of things, that statement is inexplicable. Of course it is in addition difficult to imagine what intelligible scheme of regulation of the interstate market in guns could have as an appropriate means of effectuation the prohibition of guns within 1,000 feet of schools (and nowhere else). The dissent points to a federal law, 18 U. S. C. § 922(b)(1), barring licensed dealers from selling guns to minors, see <i>post,</i> at 52-53, but the relationship between the regulatory scheme of which § 922(b)(1) is a part (requiring all dealers in firearms that have traveled in interstate commerce to be licensed, see § 922(a)) and the statute at issue in <i>Lopez</i> approaches the nonexistent  which is doubtless why the Government did not attempt to justify the statute on the basis of that relationship.</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 4 Wheat. 316, 419-421 (1819); Madison, The Bank Bill, House of Representatives (Feb. 2, 1791), in 3 The Founders' Constitution 244 (P.

C. §§ 841(a)(1), 844(a), our adjudication of their as-applied challenge casts no doubt on this Court's practice in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U S. 598 (2000).

Stat. §§ 475.316(1)(c)-(d) (2003).</p>\n<p>[5]  In fact, the Anti-Federalists objected that the Necessary and Proper Clause would allow Congress, <i>inter alia,</i> to \"<i>constitute new Crimes,</i> . . . and extend [its] Power as far as [it] shall think proper; so that the State Legislatures have no Security for the Powers now presumed to remain to them; or the People for their Rights.\" Mason, Objections to the Constitution Formed by the Convention (1787), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 11, 12-13 (H. Storing ed. 1981) (emphasis added). Hamilton responded that these objections were gross \"misrepresentation[s].\" The Federalist No. 33, at 204. He termed the Clause \"perfectly harmless,\" for it merely confirmed Congress' implied authority to enact laws in exercising its enumerated powers. <i>Id.,</i> at 205; see also <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 597, n. 6 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (discussing Congress' limited ability to establish nationwide criminal prohibitions); <i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 6 Wheat. 264, 426-428 (1821) (finding it \"clear, that Congress cannot punish felonies generally,\" except in areas over which it possesses plenary power). According to Hamilton, the Clause was needed only \"to guard against cavilling refinements\" by those seeking to cripple federal power. The Federalist No. 33, at 205; <i>id.,</i> No. 44, at 303-304 (J. Madison).</p>\n<p>[6]  Remarkably, the majority goes so far as to declare this question irrelevant. It asserts that the CSA is constitutional even if California's current controls are effective, because state action can neither expand nor contract Congress' powers. <i>Ante,</i> at 29-30, n. 38. The majority's assertion is misleading. Regardless of state action, Congress has the power to regulate intrastate economic activities that substantially affect interstate commerce (on the majority's view) or activities that are necessary and proper to effectuating its commerce power (on my view). But on either approach, whether an intrastate activity falls within the scope of Congress' powers turns on factors that the majority is unwilling to confront. The majority apparently believes that even if States prevented any medical marijuana from entering the illicit drug market, and thus even if there were no need for the CSA to govern medical marijuana users, we should uphold the CSA under the <i>Commerce</i> Clause and the <i>Necessary</i> and Proper Clause. Finally, to invoke the Supremacy Clause, as the majority does, <i>ante,</i> at 29, n. 38, is to beg the question. The CSA displaces California's Compassionate Use Act if the CSA is constitutional as applied to respondents' conduct, but that is the very question at issue.</p>\n<p>[7]  Other dictionaries do not define the term \"economic\" as broadly as the majority does. See, <i>e. g.,</i> The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 583 (3d ed. 1992) (defining \"economic\" as \"[o]f or relating to the production, development, and management of <i>material wealth,</i> as of a country, household, or business enterprise\" (emphasis added)).

Michael.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>California is one of at least nine States that authorize the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.<sup>[1]</sup> The question presented in this case is whether the power vested in Congress by Article I, § 8, of the Constitution \"[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\" its authority to \"regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States\" includes the power to prohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana in compliance with California law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>California has been a pioneer in the regulation of marijuana. In 1913, California was one of the first States to prohibit the sale and possession of marijuana,<sup>[2]</sup> and at the end of the century, California became the first State to authorize limited use of the drug for medicinal purposes. In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, now codified as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.<sup>[3]</sup> The proposition was designed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> to ensure that \"seriously ill\" residents of the State have access to marijuana for medical purposes, and to encourage Federal and State Governments to take steps toward ensuring the safe and affordable distribution of the drug to patients in need.<sup>[4]</sup> The Act creates an exemption from criminal prosecution for physicians,<sup>[5]</sup> as well as for patients and primary caregivers who possess or cultivate marijuana for medicinal purposes with the recommendation or approval of a physician.<sup>[6]</sup> A \"primary caregiver\" is a person who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of the patient.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Respondents Angel Raich and Diane Monson are California residents who suffer from a variety of serious medical conditions and have sought to avail themselves of medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the Compassionate Use <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> Act. They are being treated by licensed, board-certified family practitioners, who have concluded, after prescribing a host of conventional medicines to treat respondents' conditions and to alleviate their associated symptoms, that marijuana is the only drug available that provides effective treatment. Both women have been using marijuana as a medication for several years pursuant to their doctors' recommendation, and both rely heavily on cannabis to function on a daily basis. Indeed, Raich's physician believes that forgoing cannabis treatments would certainly cause Raich excruciating pain and could very well prove fatal.</p>\n<p>Respondent Monson cultivates her own marijuana, and ingests the drug in a variety of ways including smoking and using a vaporizer. Respondent Raich, by contrast, is unable to cultivate her own, and thus relies on two caregivers, litigating as \"John Does,\" to provide her with locally grown marijuana at no charge. These caregivers also process the cannabis into hashish or keif, and Raich herself processes some of the marijuana into oils, balms, and foods for consumption.</p>\n<p>On August 15, 2002, county deputy sheriffs and agents from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) came to Monson's home. After a thorough investigation, the county officials concluded that her use of marijuana was entirely lawful as a matter of California law. Nevertheless, after a 3-hour standoff, the federal agents seized and destroyed all six of her cannabis plants.</p>\n<p>Respondents thereafter brought this action against the Attorney General of the United States and the head of the DEA seeking injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 84 Stat. 1242, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 801 <i>et seq.,</i> to the extent it prevents them from possessing, obtaining, or manufacturing cannabis for their personal medical use. In their complaint and supporting affidavits, Raich and Monson described the severity of their afflictions, their repeatedly futile attempts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> to obtain relief with conventional medications, and the opinions of their doctors concerning their need to use marijuana. Respondents claimed that enforcing the CSA against them would violate the Commerce Clause, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution, and the doctrine of medical necessity.</p>\n<p>The District Court denied respondents' motion for a preliminary injunction. <i>Raich</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2422308\"><a href=\"/opinion/2422308/raich-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span> (ND Cal. 2003). Although the court found that the federal enforcement interests \"wane[d]\" when compared to the harm that California residents would suffer if denied access to medically necessary marijuana, it concluded that respondents could not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their legal claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 931.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and ordered the District Court to enter a preliminary injunction.<sup>[8]</sup><i>Raich</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784532\"><a href=\"/opinion/784532/raich-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1222</span></a></span> (2003). The court found that respondents had \"demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on their claim that, as applied to them, the CSA is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause authority.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1227. The Court of Appeals distinguished prior Circuit cases upholding the CSA in the face of Commerce Clause challenges by focusing on what it deemed to be the <i>\"separate and distinct class of activities\"</i> at issue in this case: \"the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by a patient's physician pursuant to valid California state law.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1228. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> court found the latter class of activities \"different in kind from drug trafficking\" because interposing a physician's recommendation raises different health and safety concerns, and because \"this limited use is clearly distinct from the broader illicit drug marketas well as any broader commercial market for medicinal marijuanainsofar as the medicinal marijuana at issue in this case is not intended for, nor does it enter, the stream of commerce.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The majority placed heavy reliance on our decisions in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span> (1995), and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span> (2000), as interpreted by recent Circuit precedent, to hold that this separate class of purely local activities was beyond the reach of federal power. In contrast, the dissenting judge concluded that the CSA, as applied to respondents, was clearly valid under <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison;</i> moreover, he thought it \"simply impossible to distinguish the relevant conduct surrounding the cultivation and use of the marijuana crop at issue in this case from the cultivation and use of the wheat crop that affected interstate commerce in <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn.</i>\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 1235 (opinion of Beam, J.) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The obvious importance of the case prompted our grant of certiorari. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></span> (2004). The case is made difficult by respondents' strong arguments that they will suffer irreparable harm because, despite a congressional finding to the contrary, marijuana does have valid therapeutic purposes. The question before us, however, is not whether it is wise to enforce the statute in these circumstances; rather, it is whether Congress' power to regulate interstate markets for medicinal substances encompasses the portions of those markets that are supplied with drugs produced and consumed locally. Well-settled law controls our answer. The CSA is a valid exercise of federal power, even as applied to the troubling facts of this case. We accordingly vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> II</h2>\n<p>Shortly after taking office in 1969, President Nixon declared a national \"war on drugs.\"<sup>[9]</sup> As the first campaign of that war, Congress set out to enact legislation that would consolidate various drug laws on the books into a comprehensive statute, provide meaningful regulation over legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversion into illegal channels, and strengthen law enforcement tools against the traffic in illicit drugs.<sup>[10]</sup> That effort culminated in the passage of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1236.</p>\n<p>This was not, however, Congress' first attempt to regulate the national market in drugs. Rather, as early as 1906 Congress enacted federal legislation imposing labeling regulations on medications and prohibiting the manufacture or shipment of any adulterated or misbranded drug traveling in interstate commerce.<sup>[11]</sup> Aside from these labeling restrictions, most domestic drug regulations prior to 1970 generally came in the guise of revenue laws, with the Department of the Treasury serving as the Federal Government's primary enforcer.<sup>[12]</sup> For example, the primary drug control law, before being repealed by the passage of the CSA, was the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, 38 Stat. 785 (repealed 1970). The Harrison Act sought to exert control over the possession and sale of narcotics, specifically cocaine and opiates, by requiring producers, distributors, and purchasers to register with the Federal Government, by assessing taxes against <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> parties so registered, and by regulating the issuance of prescriptions.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>Marijuana itself was not significantly regulated by the Federal Government until 1937 when accounts of marijuana's addictive qualities and physiological effects, paired with dissatisfaction with enforcement efforts at state and local levels, prompted Congress to pass the Marihuana Tax Act, 50 Stat. 551 (repealed 1970).<sup>[14]</sup> Like the Harrison Act, the Marihuana Tax Act did not outlaw the possession or sale of marijuana outright. Rather, it imposed registration and reporting requirements for all individuals importing, producing, selling, or dealing in marijuana, and required the payment of annual taxes in addition to transfer taxes whenever the drug changed hands.<sup>[15]</sup> Moreover, doctors wishing to prescribe marijuana for medical purposes were required to comply with rather burdensome administrative requirements.<sup>[16]</sup> Noncompliance exposed traffickers to severe federal penalties, whereas compliance would often subject them to prosecution under state law.<sup>[17]</sup> Thus, while the Marihuana Tax Act did not declare the drug illegal <i>per se,</i> the onerous administrative requirements, the prohibitively expensive taxes, and the risks attendant on compliance practically curtailed the marijuana trade.</p>\n<p>Then in 1970, after declaration of the national \"war on drugs,\" federal drug policy underwent a significant transformation. A number of noteworthy events precipitated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> this policy shift. First, in <i>Leary</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107934\"><a href=\"/opinion/107934/leary-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span> (1969), this Court held certain provisions of the Marihuana Tax Act and other narcotics legislation unconstitutional. Second, at the end of his term, President Johnson fundamentally reorganized the federal drug control agencies. The Bureau of Narcotics, then housed in the Department of Treasury, merged with the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control, then housed in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), to create the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, currently housed in the Department of Justice.<sup>[18]</sup> Finally, prompted by a perceived need to consolidate the growing number of piecemeal drug laws and to enhance federal drug enforcement powers, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>Title II of that Act, the CSA, repealed most of the earlier antidrug laws in favor of a comprehensive regime to combat the international and interstate traffic in illicit drugs. The main objectives of the CSA were to conquer drug abuse and to control the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances.<sup>[20]</sup> Congress was particularly concerned with the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> need to prevent the diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit channels.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>To effectuate these goals, Congress devised a closed regulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess any controlled substance except in a manner authorized by the CSA. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. §§ 841(a)(1), 844(a). The CSA categorizes all controlled substances into five schedules. § 812. The drugs are grouped together based on their accepted medical uses, the potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> §§ 811, 812. Each schedule is associated with a distinct set of controls regarding the manufacture, distribution, and use of the substances listed therein. §§ 821-830. The CSA and its implementing regulations set forth strict requirements regarding registration, labeling and packaging, production quotas, drug security, and recordkeeping. <i>Ibid.;</i> 21 CFR § 1301 <i>et seq.</i> (2004).</p>\n<p>In enacting the CSA, Congress classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 812(c). This preliminary classification was based, in part, on the recommendation of the Assistant Secretary of HEW \"that marihuana be retained within schedule I at least until the completion of certain studies now underway.\"<sup>[22]</sup> Schedule I drugs are categorized as such because of their high potential for abuse, lack of any accepted medical use, and absence of any accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment. § 812(b)(1). These three factors, in varying gradations, are also used to categorize drugs in the other four schedules. For example, Schedule II substances also have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence, but unlike Schedule I drugs, they have a currently accepted medical use. § 812(b)(2). By classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug, as opposed to listing it on a lesser schedule, the manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana became a criminal offense, with the sole exception being use of the drug as part of a Food and Drug Administration pre-approved research study. §§ 823(f), 841(a)(1), 844(a); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118426\"><a href=\"/opinion/118426/united-states-v-oakland-cannabis-buyerscooperative/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 490 (2001).</p>\n<p>The CSA provides for the periodic updating of schedules and delegates authority to the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to add, remove, or transfer substances to, from, or between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> schedules. § 811. Despite considerable efforts to reschedule marijuana, it remains a Schedule I drug.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Respondents in this case do not dispute that passage of the CSA, as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, was well within Congress' commerce power. Brief for Respondents 22, 38. Nor do they contend that any provision or section of the CSA amounts to an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority. Rather, respondents' challenge is actually quite limited; they argue that the CSA's categorical prohibition of the manufacture and possession of marijuana as applied to the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana for medical purposes pursuant to California law exceeds Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>In assessing the validity of congressional regulation, none of our Commerce Clause cases can be viewed in isolation. As charted in considerable detail in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez</i><i>,</i> our understanding of the reach of the Commerce Clause, as well as Congress' assertion of authority thereunder has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> evolved over time.<sup>[24]</sup> The Commerce Clause emerged as the Framers' response to the central problem giving rise to the Constitution itself: the absence of any federal commerce power under the Articles of Confederation.<sup>[25]</sup> For the first century of our history, the primary use of the Clause was to preclude the kind of discriminatory state legislation that had once been permissible.<sup>[26]</sup> Then, in response to rapid industrial development and an increasingly interdependent national economy, Congress \"ushered in a new era of federal regulation under the commerce power,\" beginning with the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, 24 Stat. 379, and the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 2 <i>et seq.</i><sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p>Cases decided during that \"new era,\" which now spans more than a century, have identified three general categories of regulation in which Congress is authorized to engage under its commerce power. First, Congress can regulate the channels of interstate commerce. <i>Perez</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108326\"><a href=\"/opinion/108326/perez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 150 (1971). Second, Congress has authority to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> commerce. <i>Ibid.</i> Third, Congress has the power to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. <i>Ibid.; </i><i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102804\"><a href=\"/opinion/102804/nlrb-v-jones-laughlin-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 37 (1937). Only the third category is implicated in the case at hand.</p>\n<p>Our case law firmly establishes Congress' power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic \"class of activities\" that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Perez,</i> 402 U. S., at 151; <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103716\"><a href=\"/opinion/103716/wickard-v-filburn/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 128-129 (1942). As we stated in <i>Wickard,</i> \"even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 125. We have never required Congress to legislate with scientific exactitude. When Congress decides that the \"`total incidence'\" of a practice poses a threat to a national market, it may regulate the entire class. See <i>Perez,</i> 402 U. S., at 154-155 (quoting <i>Westfall</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101082\"><a href=\"/opinion/101082/westfall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>, 259 (1927) (\"`[W]hen it is necessary in order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace more than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so'\")). In this vein, we have reiterated that when \"`a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the <i>de minimis</i> character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.'\" <i>E. g., </i><i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 558 (emphasis deleted) (quoting <i>Maryland</i> v. <i>Wirtz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107734\"><a href=\"/opinion/107734/maryland-v-wirtz/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 196, n. 27 (1968)).</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Wickard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103716\"><a href=\"/opinion/103716/wickard-v-filburn/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, is of particular relevance. In <i>Wickard,</i> we upheld the application of regulations promulgated under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 31, which were designed to control the volume of wheat moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and consequent abnormally low prices. The regulations established an allotment of 11.1 acres for Filburn's 1941 wheat crop, but he sowed 23 acres, intending to use the excess by consuming it on his own farm. Filburn <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> argued that even though we had sustained Congress' power to regulate the production of goods for commerce, that power did not authorize \"federal regulation [of] production not intended in any part for commerce but wholly for consumption on the farm.\" <i>Wickard,</i> 317 U. S., at 118. Justice Jackson's opinion for a unanimous Court rejected this submission. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The effect of the statute before us is to restrict the amount which may be produced for market and the extent as well to which one may forestall resort to the market by producing to meet his own needs. That appellee's own contribution to the demand for wheat may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from the scope of federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 127-128.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Wickard</i> thus establishes that Congress can regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself \"commercial,\" in that it is not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.</p>\n<p>The similarities between this case and <i>Wickard</i> are striking. Like the farmer in <i>Wickard,</i> respondents are cultivating, for home consumption, a fungible commodity for which there is an established, albeit illegal, interstate market.<sup>[28]</sup> Just as the Agricultural Adjustment Act was designed \"to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> control the volume [of wheat] moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses ...\" and consequently control the market price, <i>id.,</i> at 115, a primary purpose of the CSA is to control the supply and demand of controlled substances in both lawful and unlawful drug markets. See nn. 20-21, <i>supra.</i> In <i>Wickard,</i> we had no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that, when viewed in the aggregate, leaving home-consumed wheat outside the regulatory scheme would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions. Here too, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that leaving home-consumed marijuana outside federal control would similarly affect price and market conditions.</p>\n<p>More concretely, one concern prompting inclusion of wheat grown for home consumption in the 1938 Act was that rising market prices could draw such wheat into the interstate market, resulting in lower market prices. <i>Wickard,</i> 317 U. S., at 128. The parallel concern making it appropriate to include marijuana grown for home consumption in the CSA is the likelihood that the high demand in the interstate market will draw such marijuana into that market. While the diversion of homegrown wheat tended to frustrate the federal interest in stabilizing prices by regulating the volume of commercial transactions in the interstate market, the diversion of homegrown marijuana tends to frustrate the federal interest in eliminating commercial transactions in the interstate market in their entirety. In both cases, the regulation is squarely within Congress' commerce power because production of the commodity meant for home consumption, be it wheat or marijuana, has a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market for that commodity.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> Nonetheless, respondents suggest that <i>Wickard</i> differs from this case in three respects: (1) the Agricultural Adjustment Act, unlike the CSA, exempted small farming operations; (2) <i>Wickard</i> involved a \"quintessential economic activity\"a commercial farmwhereas respondents do not sell marijuana; and (3) the <i>Wickard</i> record made it clear that the aggregate production of wheat for use on farms had a significant impact on market prices. Those differences, though factually accurate, do not diminish the precedential force of this Court's reasoning.</p>\n<p>The fact that Filburn's own impact on the market was \"trivial by itself\" was not a sufficient reason for removing him from the scope of federal regulation. 317 U. S., at 127. That the Secretary of Agriculture elected to exempt even smaller farms from regulation does not speak to his power to regulate all those whose aggregated production was significant, nor did that fact play any role in the Court's analysis. Moreover, even though Filburn was indeed a commercial farmer, the activity he was engaged inthe cultivation of wheat for home consumptionwas not treated by the Court as part of his commercial farming operation.<sup>[30]</sup> And while it is true that the record in the <i>Wickard</i> case itself established the causal connection between the production for local use and the national market, we have before us findings by Congress to the same effect.</p>\n<p>Findings in the introductory sections of the CSA explain why Congress deemed it appropriate to encompass local activities within the scope of the CSA. See n. 20, <i>supra.</i> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> submissions of the parties and the numerous <i>amici</i> all seem to agree that the national, and international, market for marijuana has dimensions that are fully comparable to those defining the class of activities regulated by the Secretary pursuant to the 1938 statute.<sup>[31]</sup> Respondents nonetheless insist that the CSA cannot be constitutionally applied to their activities because Congress did not make a specific finding that the intrastate cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes based on the recommendation of a physician would substantially affect the larger interstate marijuana market. Be that as it may, we have never required Congress to make particularized findings in order to legislate, see <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 562; <i>Perez,</i> 402 U. S., at 156, absent a special concern such as the protection of free speech, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</i> v. <i>FCC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117869\"><a href=\"/opinion/117869/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 664-668 (1994) (plurality opinion). While congressional findings are certainly helpful in reviewing the substance of a congressional statutory scheme, particularly when the connection to commerce is not self-evident, and while we will consider congressional findings in our analysis when they are available, the absence of particularized findings does not call into question Congress' authority to legislate.<sup>[32]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> In assessing the scope of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause, we stress that the task before us is a modest one. We need not determine whether respondents' activities, taken in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a \"rational basis\" exists for so concluding. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 557; see also <i>Hodel</i> v. <i>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110516\"><a href=\"/opinion/110516/hodel-v-virginia-surface-mining-reclamation-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span>, 276-280 (1981); <i>Perez,</i> 402 U.

Given the enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 801(5), and concerns about diversion into illicit channels,<sup>[33]</sup> we have no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the CSA. Thus, as in <i>Wickard,</i> when it enacted comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market in a fungible commodity, Congress was acting well within its authority to \"make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper\" to \"regulate Commerce ... among the several States.\" U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8. That the regulation ensnares some purely intrastate activity is of no moment. As we have done many times before, we refuse to excise individual components of that larger scheme.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> IV</h2>\n<p>To support their contrary submission, respondents rely heavily on two of our more recent Commerce Clause cases. In their myopic focus, they overlook the larger context of modern-era Commerce Clause jurisprudence preserved by those cases. Moreover, even in the narrow prism of respondents' creation, they read those cases far too broadly.</p>\n<p>Those two cases, of course, are <i>Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, and <i>Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>. As an initial matter, the statutory challenges at issue in those cases were markedly different from the challenge respondents pursue in the case at hand. Here, respondents ask us to excise individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme. In contrast, in both <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the parties asserted that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress' commerce power in its entirety. This distinction is pivotal for we have often reiterated that \"[w]here the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power `to excise, as trivial, individual instances' of the class.\" <i>Perez,</i> 402 U. S., at 154 (emphasis deleted) (quoting <i>Wirtz,</i> 392 U. S., at 193); see also <i>Hodel,</i> 452 U. S., at 308.</p>\n<p>At issue in <i>Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, was the validity of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which was a brief, single-subject statute making it a crime for an individual to possess a gun in a school zone. 104 Stat. 4844-4845, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 922(q)(1)(A). The Act did not regulate any economic activity and did not contain any requirement that the possession of a gun have any connection to past interstate activity or a predictable impact on future commercial activity. Distinguishing our earlier cases holding that comprehensive regulatory statutes may be validly applied to local conduct that does not, when viewed in isolation, have a significant impact on interstate commerce, we held the statute invalid. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> \"Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms. Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.\" 514 U. S., at 561.</blockquote>\n<p>The statutory scheme that the Government is defending in this litigation is at the opposite end of the regulatory spectrum. As explained above, the CSA, enacted in 1970 as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, 84 Stat. 1242-1284, was a lengthy and detailed statute creating a comprehensive framework for regulating the production, distribution, and possession of five classes of \"controlled substances.\" Most of those substancesthose listed in Schedules II through V\"have a useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the American people.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 801(1). The regulatory scheme is designed to foster the beneficial use of those medications, to prevent their misuse, and to prohibit entirely the possession or use of substances listed in Schedule I, except as a part of a strictly controlled research project.</p>\n<p>While the statute provided for the periodic updating of the five schedules, Congress itself made the initial classifications. It identified 42 opiates, 22 opium derivatives, and 17 hallucinogenic substances as Schedule I drugs. 84 Stat. 1248. Marijuana was listed as the 10th item in the 3d subcategory. That classification, unlike the discrete prohibition established by the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, was merely one of many \"essential part[s] of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 561.<sup>[34]</sup> Our opinion in <i>Lopez</i> casts no doubt on the validity of such a program.</p>\n<p>Nor does this Court's holding in <i>Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>. The Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 1902, created a federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated crimes of violence. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 13981. The remedy was enforceable in both state and federal courts, and generally depended on proof of the violation of a state law. Despite congressional findings that such crimes had an adverse impact on interstate commerce, we held the statute unconstitutional because, like the statute in <i>Lopez,</i> it did not regulate economic activity. We concluded that \"the non-economic, criminal nature of the conduct at issue was central to our decision\" in <i>Lopez,</i> and that our prior cases had identified a clear pattern of analysis: \"`Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained.'\"<sup>[35]</sup><i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S., at 610.</p>\n<p>Unlike those at issue in <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the activities regulated by the CSA are quintessentially economic. \"Economics\" refers to \"the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities.\" Webster's Third New International <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> Dictionary 720 (1966). The CSA is a statute that regulates the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities for which there is an established, and lucrative, interstate market. Prohibiting the intrastate possession or manufacture of an article of commerce is a rational (and commonly utilized) means of regulating commerce in that product.<sup>[36]</sup> Such prohibitions include specific decisions requiring that a drug be withdrawn from the market as a result of the failure to comply with regulatory requirements as well as decisions excluding Schedule I drugs entirely from the market. Because the CSA is a statute that directly regulates economic, commercial activity, our opinion in <i>Morrison</i> casts no doubt on its constitutionality.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals was able to conclude otherwise only by isolating a \"separate and distinct\" class of activities that it held to be beyond the reach of federal power, defined as \"the intrastate, non-commercial cultivation, possession and use of marijuana for personal medical purposes on the advice of a physician and in accordance with state law.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 1229. The court characterized this class as \"different in kind from drug trafficking.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1228. The differences between the members of a class so defined and the principal traffickers in Schedule I substances might be sufficient to justify a policy decision exempting the narrower class from the coverage of the CSA. The question, however, is whether Congress' contrary policy judgment, <i>i. e.,</i> its decision to include this narrower \"class of activities\" within the larger regulatory scheme, was constitutionally deficient. We have no difficulty concluding that Congress acted rationally in determining that none of the characteristics making up the purported class, whether viewed individually or in the aggregate, compelled an exemption from the CSA; rather, the subdivided class of activities defined by the Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> of Appeals was an essential part of the larger regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p>First, the fact that marijuana is used \"for personal medical purposes on the advice of a physician\" cannot itself serve as a distinguishing factor. <i>Id.,</i> at 1229. The CSA designates marijuana as contraband for <i>any</i> purpose; in fact, by characterizing marijuana as a Schedule I drug, Congress expressly found that the drug has no acceptable medical uses. Moreover, the CSA is a comprehensive regulatory regime specifically designed to regulate which controlled substances can be utilized for medicinal purposes, and in what manner. Indeed, most of the substances classified in the CSA \"have a useful and legitimate medical purpose.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 801(1). Thus, even if respondents are correct that marijuana does have accepted medical uses and thus should be redesignated as a lesser schedule drug,<sup>[37]</sup> the CSA would still impose controls beyond what is required by California law. The CSA requires manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, and other handlers of controlled substances to comply with statutory and regulatory provisions mandating registration with the DEA, compliance with specific production quotas, security controls to guard against diversion, recordkeeping and reporting obligations, and prescription requirements. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> §§ 821-830; 21 CFR § 1301 <i>et seq.</i> (2004). Furthermore, the dispensing of new drugs, even when doctors approve their use, must await federal approval. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rutherford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110111\"><a href=\"/opinion/110111/united-states-v-rutherford/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span> (1979). Accordingly, the mere fact that marijuanalike virtually every other controlled substance regulated by the CSAis used for medicinal purposes cannot possibly serve to distinguish it from the core activities regulated by the CSA.</p>\n<p>Nor can it serve as an \"objective marke[r]\" or \"objective facto[r]\" to arbitrarily narrow the relevant class as the dissenters suggest, <i>post,</i> at 47 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); <i>post,</i> at 68 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). More fundamentally, if, as the principal dissent contends, the personal cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes is beyond the \"`outer limits' of Congress' Commerce Clause authority,\" <i>post,</i> at 42 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.), it must also be true that such personal use of marijuana (or any other homegrown drug) for recreational purposes is also beyond those \"`outer limits,'\" whether or not a State elects to authorize or even regulate such use. JUSTICE THOMAS' separate dissent suffers from the same sweeping implications. That is, the dissenters' rationale logically extends to place <i>any</i> federal regulation (including quality, prescription, or quantity controls) of <i>any</i> locally cultivated and possessed controlled substance for <i>any</i> purpose beyond the \"`outer limits'\" of Congress' Commerce Clause authority. One need not have a degree in economics to understand why a nationwide exemption for the vast quantity of marijuana (or other drugs) locally cultivated for personal use (which presumably would include use by friends, neighbors, and family members) may have a substantial impact on the interstate market for this extraordinarily popular substance. The congressional judgment that an exemption for such a significant segment of the total market would undermine the orderly enforcement of the entire regulatory scheme is entitled to a strong presumption of validity. Indeed, that judgment is not only rational, but \"visible to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> naked eye,\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 563, under any commonsense appraisal of the probable consequences of such an open-ended exemption.</p>\n<p>Second, limiting the activity to marijuana possession and cultivation \"in accordance with state law\" cannot serve to place respondents' activities beyond congressional reach. The Supremacy Clause unambiguously provides that if there is any conflict between federal and state law, federal law shall prevail. It is beyond peradventure that federal power over commerce is \"`superior to that of the States to provide for the welfare or necessities of their inhabitants,'\" however legitimate or dire those necessities may be. <i>Wirtz,</i> 392 U. S., at 196 (quoting <i>Sanitary Dist. of Chicago</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100528\"><a href=\"/opinion/100528/sanitary-dist-of-chicago-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span>, 426 (1925)). See also 392 U. S., at 195-196; <i>Wickard,</i> 317 U. S., at 124 (\"`[N]o form of state activity can constitutionally thwart the regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to Congress'\"). Just as state acquiescence to federal regulation cannot expand the bounds of the Commerce Clause, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S., at 661-662 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (noting that 38 States requested federal intervention), so too state action cannot circumscribe Congress' plenary commerce power. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Darby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103442\"><a href=\"/opinion/103442/united-states-v-darby/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 114 (1941) (\"That power can neither be enlarged nor diminished by the exercise or non-exercise of state power\").<sup>[38]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> Respondents acknowledge this proposition, but nonetheless contend that their activities were not \"an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme\" because they had been \"isolated by the State of California, and [are] policed by the State of California,\" and thus remain \"entirely separated from the market.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. The dissenters fall prey to similar reasoning. See n. 38, <i>supra,</i> at 26 and this page. The notion that California law has surgically excised a discrete activity that is hermetically sealed off from the larger interstate marijuana market is a dubious proposition, and, more importantly, one that Congress could have rationally rejected.</p>\n<p>Indeed, that the California exemptions will have a significant impact on both the supply and demand sides of the market for marijuana is not just \"plausible\" as the principal dissent concedes, <i>post,</i> at 56 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.), it is readily apparent. The exemption for physicians provides them with an economic incentive to grant their patients permission to use the drug. In contrast to most prescriptions for legal drugs, which limit the dosage and duration of the usage, under California law the doctor's permission to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> recommend marijuana use is open-ended. The authority to grant permission whenever the doctor determines that a patient is afflicted with \"any other illness for which marijuana provides relief,\" Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 11362.5(b)(1)(A) (West Supp. 2005), is broad enough to allow even the most scrupulous doctor to conclude that some recreational uses would be therapeutic.<sup>[39]</sup> And our cases have taught us that there are some unscrupulous physicians who overprescribe when it is sufficiently profitable to do so.<sup>[40]</sup></p>\n<p>The exemption for cultivation by patients and caregivers can only increase the supply of marijuana in the California market.<sup>[41]</sup> The likelihood that all such production will <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> promptly terminate when patients recover or will precisely match the patients' medical needs during their convalescence seems remote; whereas the danger that excesses will satisfy some of the admittedly enormous demand for recreational use seems obvious.<sup>[42]</sup> Moreover, that the national and international narcotics trade has thrived in the face of vigorous criminal enforcement efforts suggests that no small number of unscrupulous people will make use of the California exemptions to serve their commercial ends whenever it is feasible to do so.<sup>[43]</sup> Taking into account the fact that California is only one of at least nine States to have authorized the medical use of marijuana, a fact JUSTICE O'CONNOR's dissent conveniently disregards in arguing that the demonstrated effect on commerce while admittedly \"plausible\" is ultimately \"unsubstantiated,\" <i>post,</i> at 56, 55, Congress could have rationally concluded that the aggregate impact on the national market of all the transactions exempted from federal supervision is unquestionably substantial.</p>\n<p>So, from the \"separate and distinct\" class of activities identified by the Court of Appeals (and adopted by the dissenters), we are left with \"the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation, possession and use of marijuana.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 1229. Thus the case for the exemption comes down to the claim that a locally cultivated product that is used domestically <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> rather than sold on the open market is not subject to federal regulation. Given the findings in the CSA and the undisputed magnitude of the commercial market for marijuana, our decisions in <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn</i> and the later cases endorsing its reasoning foreclose that claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Respondents also raise a substantive due process claim and seek to avail themselves of the medical necessity defense. These theories of relief were set forth in their complaint but were not reached by the Court of Appeals. We therefore do not address the question whether judicial relief is available to respondents on these alternative bases. We do note, however, the presence of another avenue of relief. As the Solicitor General confirmed during oral argument, the statute authorizes procedures for the reclassification of Schedule I drugs. But perhaps even more important than these legal avenues is the democratic process, in which the voices of voters allied with these respondents may one day be heard in the halls of Congress. Under the present state of the law, however, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be vacated. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court's holding that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) may validly be applied to respondents' cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana for personal, medicinal use. I write separately because my understanding of the doctrinal foundation on which that holding rests is, if not inconsistent with that of the Court, at least more nuanced.</p>\n<p>Since <i>Perez</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108326\"><a href=\"/opinion/108326/perez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span> (1971), our cases have mechanically recited that the Commerce Clause permits congressional regulation of three categories: (1) the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> channels of interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate commerce; and (3) activities that \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce. <i>Id.,</i> at 150; see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 608-609 (2000); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 558-559 (1995); <i>Hodel</i> v. <i>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110516\"><a href=\"/opinion/110516/hodel-v-virginia-surface-mining-reclamation-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span>, 276-277 (1981). The first two categories are self-evident, since they are the ingredients of interstate commerce itself. See <i>Gibbons</i> v. <i>Ogden,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85412\"><a href=\"/opinion/85412/gibbons-v-ogden/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 189-190 (1824). The third category, however, is different in kind, and its recitation without explanation is misleading and incomplete.</p>\n<p>It is <i>misleading</i> because, unlike the channels, instrumentalities, and agents of interstate commerce, activities that substantially affect interstate commerce are not themselves part of interstate commerce, and thus the power to regulate them cannot come from the Commerce Clause alone. Rather, as this Court has acknowledged since at least <i>United States</i> v. <i>Coombs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86031\"><a href=\"/opinion/86031/united-states-v-coombs/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span> (1838), Congress's regulatory authority over intrastate activities that are not themselves part of interstate commerce (including activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce) derives from the Necessary and Proper Clause. <i>Id.,</i> at 78; <i>Katzenbach</i> v. <i>McClung,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106951\"><a href=\"/opinion/106951/katzenbach-v-mcclung/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 301-302 (1964); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wrightwood Dairy Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103600\"><a href=\"/opinion/103600/united-states-v-wrightwood-dairy-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 119 (1942); <i>Shreveport Rate Cases,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98232\"><a href=\"/opinion/98232/houston-texas-ry-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, 353 (1914); <i>United States</i> v. <i>E.

Where necessary to make a regulation of interstate commerce effective, Congress may regulate even those intrastate activities that do not themselves substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Our cases show that the regulation of intrastate activities may be necessary to and proper for the regulation of interstate commerce in two general circumstances. Most directly, the commerce power permits Congress not only to devise rules for the governance of commerce between States but also to facilitate interstate commerce by eliminating potential obstructions, and to restrict it by eliminating potential stimulants. See <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102804\"><a href=\"/opinion/102804/nlrb-v-jones-laughlin-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 36-37 (1937). That is why the Court has repeatedly sustained congressional legislation on the ground that the regulated activities had a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Hodel, supra,</i> at 281 (surface coal mining); <i>Katzenbach, supra,</i> at 300 (discrimination by restaurants); <i>Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></span>, 258 (1964) (discrimination by hotels); <i>Mandeville Island Farms, Inc.</i> v. <i>American Crystal Sugar Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104554\"><a href=\"/opinion/104554/mandeville-island-farms-inc-v-american-crystal-sugar-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span>, 237 (1948) (intrastate price fixing); <i>Board of Trade of Chicago</i> v. <i>Olsen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100188\"><a href=\"/opinion/100188/board-of-trade-of-chicago-v-olsen/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 40 (1923) (activities of a local grain exchange); <i>Stafford</i> v. <i>Wallace,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99977\"><a href=\"/opinion/99977/stafford-v-wallace/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span>, 517, 524-525 (1922) (intrastate transactions at stockyard). <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> recognized the expansive scope of Congress's authority in this regard: \"[T]he pattern is clear. Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained.\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 560; <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 610 (same).</p>\n<p>This principle is not without limitation. In <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the Court  conscious of the potential of the \"substantially affects\" test to \"`obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local,'\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 566-567 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> (quoting <i>A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102474\"><a href=\"/opinion/102474/ala-schechter-poultry-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span>, 554 (1935)); see also <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 615-616  rejected the argument that Congress may regulate <i>noneconomic</i> activity based solely on the effect that it may have on interstate commerce through a remote chain of inferences. <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 564-566; <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 617-618. \"[I]f we were to accept [such] arguments,\" the Court reasoned in <i>Lopez,</i> \"we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate.\" 514 U. S., at 564; see also <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 615-616. Thus, although Congress's authority to regulate intrastate activity that substantially affects interstate commerce is broad, it does not permit the Court to \"pile inference upon inference,\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 567, in order to establish that noneconomic activity has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>As we implicitly acknowledged in <i>Lopez,</i> however, Congress's authority to enact laws necessary and proper for the regulation of interstate commerce is not limited to laws directed against economic activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Though the conduct in <i>Lopez</i> was not economic, the Court nevertheless recognized that it could be regulated as \"an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\" 514 U. S., at 561. This statement referred to those cases permitting the regulation of intrastate activities \"which in a substantial way interfere with or obstruct the exercise of the granted power.\" <i>Wrightwood Dairy Co., supra,</i> at 119; see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Darby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103442\"><a href=\"/opinion/103442/united-states-v-darby/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 118-119 (1941); <i>Shreveport Rate Cases, supra,</i> at 353. As the Court put it in <i>Wrightwood Dairy,</i> where Congress has the authority to enact a regulation of interstate commerce, \"it possesses every power needed to make that regulation effective.\" 315 U. S., at 118-119.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> Although this power \"to make ... regulation effective\" commonly overlaps with the authority to regulate economic activities that substantially affect interstate commerce,<sup>[2]</sup> and may in some cases have been confused with that authority, the two are distinct. The regulation of an intrastate activity may be essential to a comprehensive regulation of interstate commerce even though the intrastate activity does not itself \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce. Moreover, as the passage from <i>Lopez</i> quoted above suggests, Congress may regulate even noneconomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce. See <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 561. The relevant question is simply whether the means chosen are \"reasonably adapted\" to the attainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power. See <i>Darby, supra,</i> at 121.</p>\n<p>In <i>Darby,</i> for instance, the Court explained that \"Congress, having ... adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards,\" 312 U. S., at 121, could not only require employers engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce to conform to wage and hour standards, <i>id.,</i> at 119-121, but could also require those employers to keep employment records in order to demonstrate compliance with the regulatory scheme, <i>id.,</i> at 125. While the Court sustained the former regulation on the alternative ground that the activity it regulated could have a \"great effect\" on interstate commerce, <i>id.,</i> at 122-123, it affirmed the latter on the sole ground that \"[t]he requirement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> for records even of the intrastate transaction is an appropriate means to the legitimate end,\" <i>id.,</i> at 125.</p>\n<p>As the Court said in the <i>Shreveport Rate Cases,</i> the Necessary and Proper Clause does not give \"Congress ... the authority to regulate the internal commerce of a State, as such,\" but it does allow Congress \"to take all measures necessary or appropriate to\" the effective regulation of the interstate market, \"although intrastate transactions ... may thereby be controlled.\" 234 U. S., at 353; see also <i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., supra,</i> at 38 (the logic of the <i>Shreveport Rate Cases</i> is not limited to instrumentalities of commerce).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Today's principal dissent objects that, by permitting Congress to regulate activities necessary to effective interstate regulation, the Court reduces <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> to little \"more than a drafting guide.\" <i>Post,</i> at 46 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). I think that criticism unjustified. Unlike the power to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, the power to enact laws enabling effective regulation of interstate commerce can only be exercised in conjunction with congressional regulation of an interstate market, and it extends only to those measures necessary to make the interstate regulation effective. As <i>Lopez</i> itself states, and the Court affirms today, Congress may regulate noneconomic intrastate activities only where the failure to do so \"could ... undercut\" its regulation of interstate commerce. See <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 561; <i>ante,</i> at 18, 24-25. This is not a power that threatens to obliterate the line between \"what is truly national and what is truly local.\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 567-568.</p>\n<p><i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> affirm that Congress may not regulate certain \"purely local\" activity within the States based solely on the attenuated effect that such activity may have in the interstate market. But those decisions do not declare noneconomic intrastate activities to be categorically beyond <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> the reach of the Federal Government. Neither case involved the power of Congress to exert control over intrastate activities in connection with a more comprehensive scheme of regulation; <i>Lopez</i> expressly disclaimed that it was such a case, 514 U. S., at 561, and <i>Morrison</i> did not even discuss the possibility that it was. (The Court of Appeals in <i>Morrison</i> made clear that it was not. See <i>Brzonkala</i> v. <i>Virginia Polytechnic Inst.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762203\"><a href=\"/opinion/762203/christy-brzonkala-v-virginia-polytechnic-institute-and-state-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span>, 834-835 (CA4 1999) (en banc).) To dismiss this distinction as \"superficial and formalistic,\" see <i>post,</i> at 47 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), is to misunderstand the nature of the Necessary and Proper Clause, which empowers Congress to enact laws in effectuation of its enumerated powers that are not within its authority to enact in isolation. See <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85272\"><a href=\"/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>, 421-422 (1819).</p>\n<p>And there are other restraints upon the Necessary and Proper Clause authority. As Chief Justice Marshall wrote in <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i><i>,</i> even when the end is constitutional and legitimate, the means must be \"appropriate\" and \"plainly adapted\" to that end. <i>Id.,</i> at 421. Moreover, they may not be otherwise \"prohibited\" and must be \"consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution.\" <i>Ibid.</i> These phrases are not merely hortatory. For example, cases such as <i>Printz</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118148\"><a href=\"/opinion/118148/printz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span> (1997), and <i>New York</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112768\"><a href=\"/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span> (1992), affirm that a law is not \"`<i>proper</i> for carrying into Execution the Commerce Clause'\" \"[w]hen [it] violates [a constitutional] principle of state sovereignty.\" <i>Printz, supra,</i> at 923-924; see also <i>New York, supra,</i> at 166.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The application of these principles to the case before us is straightforward. In the CSA, Congress has undertaken to extinguish the interstate market in Schedule I controlled substances, including marijuana. The Commerce Clause unquestionably permits this. The power to regulate interstate commerce \"extends not only to those regulations which aid, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> foster and protect the commerce, but embraces those which prohibit it.\" <i>Darby, supra,</i> at 113. See also <i>Hipolite Egg Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97373\"><a href=\"/opinion/97373/hipolite-egg-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 58 (1911); <i>Lottery Case,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2421240\"><a href=\"/opinion/2421240/lottery-case/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 354 (1903). To effectuate its objective, Congress has prohibited almost all intrastate activities related to Schedule I substances  both economic activities (manufacture, distribution, possession with the intent to distribute) and noneconomic activities (simple possession). See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. §§ 841(a), 844(a). That simple possession is a noneconomic activity is immaterial to whether it can be prohibited as a necessary part of a larger regulation. Rather, Congress's authority to enact all of these prohibitions of intrastate controlled-substance activities depends only upon whether they are appropriate means of achieving the legitimate end of eradicating Schedule I substances from interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>By this measure, I think the regulation must be sustained. Not only is it impossible to distinguish \"controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate\" from \"controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate,\" but it hardly makes sense to speak in such terms. Drugs like marijuana are fungible commodities. As the Court explains, marijuana that is grown at home and possessed for personal use is never more than an instant from the interstate market  and this is so whether or not the possession is for medicinal use or lawful use under the laws of a particular State.<sup>[3]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> See <i>ante,</i> at 25-33. Congress need not accept on faith that state law will be effective in maintaining a strict division between a lawful market for \"medical\" marijuana and the more general marijuana market. See <i>ante,</i> at 30, and n. 38. \"To impose on [Congress] the necessity of resorting to means which it cannot control, which another government may furnish or withhold, would render its course precarious, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a dependence on other governments, which might disappoint its most important designs, and is incompatible with the language of the constitution.\" <i>McCulloch,</i> 4 Wheat., at 424.</p>\n<p>Finally, neither respondents nor the dissenters suggest any violation of state sovereignty of the sort that would render this regulation \"inappropriate,\" <i>id.,</i> at 421  except to argue that the CSA regulates an area typically left to state regulation. See <i>post,</i> at 48, 51 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); <i>post,</i> at 66 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); Brief for Respondents 39-42. That is not enough to render federal regulation an inappropriate means. The Court has repeatedly recognized that, if authorized by the commerce power, Congress may regulate private endeavors \"even when [that regulation] may pre-empt express state-law determinations contrary to the result which has commended itself to the collective wisdom of Congress.\" <i>National League of Cities</i> v. <i>Usery,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109499\"><a href=\"/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 840 (1976); see <i>Cleveland</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104324\"><a href=\"/opinion/104324/cleveland-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 19 (1946); <i>McCulloch, supra,</i> at 424. At bottom, respondents' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> state-sovereignty argument reduces to the contention that federal regulation of the activities permitted by California's Compassionate Use Act is not sufficiently necessary to be \"necessary and proper\" to Congress's regulation of the interstate market. For the reasons given above and in the Court's opinion, I cannot agree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>I thus agree with the Court that, however the class of regulated activities is subdivided, Congress could reasonably conclude that its objective of prohibiting marijuana from the interstate market \"could be undercut\" if those activities were excepted from its general scheme of regulation. See <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 561. That is sufficient to authorize the application of the CSA to respondents.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE THOMAS join as to all but Part III, dissenting.</p>\n<p>We enforce the \"outer limits\" of Congress' Commerce Clause authority not for their own sake, but to protect historic spheres of state sovereignty from excessive federal encroachment and thereby to maintain the distribution of power fundamental to our federalist system of government. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 557 (1995); <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102804\"><a href=\"/opinion/102804/nlrb-v-jones-laughlin-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 37 (1937). One of federalism's chief virtues, of course, is that it promotes innovation by allowing for the possibility that \"a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\" <i>New State Ice Co.</i> v. <i>Liebmann,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101887\"><a href=\"/opinion/101887/new-state-ice-co-v-liebmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>This case exemplifies the role of States as laboratories. The States' core police powers have always included authority to define criminal law and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens. <i>Brecht</i> v. <i>Abrahamson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>, 635 (1993); <i>Whalen</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109592\"><a href=\"/opinion/109592/whalen-v-roe/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span>, 603, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> n. 30 (1977). Exercising those powers, California (by ballot initiative and then by legislative codification) has come to its own conclusion about the difficult and sensitive question of whether marijuana should be available to relieve severe pain and suffering. Today the Court sanctions an application of the federal Controlled Substances Act that extinguishes that experiment, without any proof that the personal cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, if economic activity in the first place, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce and is therefore an appropriate subject of federal regulation. In so doing, the Court announces a rule that gives Congress a perverse incentive to legislate broadly pursuant to the Commerce Clause  nestling questionable assertions of its authority into comprehensive regulatory schemes  rather than with precision. That rule and the result it produces in this case are irreconcilable with our decisions in <i>Lopez, supra,</i> and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span> (2000). Accordingly I dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Lopez,</i> we considered the constitutionality of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a federal offense \"for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm ... at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 922(q)(2)(A). We explained that \"Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce ..., <i>i. e.,</i> those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\" 514 U. S., at 558-559 (citation omitted). This power derives from the conjunction of the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111308\"><a href=\"/opinion/111308/garcia-v-san-antonio-metropolitan-transit-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, 585-586 (1985) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (explaining that <i>United States</i> v. <i>Darby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103442\"><a href=\"/opinion/103442/united-states-v-darby/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span> (1941), <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wrightwood Dairy Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103600\"><a href=\"/opinion/103600/united-states-v-wrightwood-dairy-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span> (1942), and <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103716\"><a href=\"/opinion/103716/wickard-v-filburn/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span> (1942), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> based their expansion of the commerce power on the Necessary and Proper Clause, and that \"the reasoning of these cases underlies every recent decision concerning the reach of Congress to activities affecting interstate commerce\"); <i>ante,</i> at 34 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). We held in <i>Lopez</i> that the Gun-Free School Zones Act could not be sustained as an exercise of that power.</p>\n<p>Our decision about whether gun possession in school zones substantially affected interstate commerce turned on four considerations. <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 559-567; see also <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 609-613. First, we observed that our \"substantial effects\" cases generally have upheld federal regulation of economic activity that affected interstate commerce, but that § 922(q) was a criminal statute having \"nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise.\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 561. In this regard, we also noted that \"[s]ection 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Second, we noted that the statute contained no express jurisdictional requirement establishing its connection to interstate commerce. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Third, we found telling the absence of legislative findings about the regulated conduct's impact on interstate commerce. We explained that while express legislative findings are neither required nor, when provided, dispositive, findings \"enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affect[s] interstate commerce, even though no such substantial effect [is] visible to the naked eye.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 563. Finally, we rejected as too attenuated the Government's argument that firearm possession in school zones could result in violent crime which in turn could <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> adversely affect the national economy. <i>Id.,</i> at 563-567. The Constitution, we said, does not tolerate reasoning that would \"convert congressional authority under the Commerce Clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 567. Later in <i>Morrison, supra,</i> we relied on the same four considerations to hold that § 40302 of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 1941, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 13981, exceeded Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>In my view, the case before us is materially indistinguishable from <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> when the same considerations are taken into account.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>What is the relevant conduct subject to Commerce Clause analysis in this case? The Court takes its cues from Congress, applying the above considerations to the activity regulated by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in general. The Court's decision rests on two facts about the CSA: (1) Congress chose to enact a single statute providing a comprehensive prohibition on the production, distribution, and possession of all controlled substances, and (2) Congress did not distinguish between various forms of intrastate noncommercial cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. §§ 841(a)(1), 844(a). Today's decision suggests that the federal regulation of local activity is immune to Commerce Clause challenge because Congress chose to act with an ambitious, all-encompassing statute, rather than piecemeal. In my view, allowing Congress to set the terms of the constitutional debate in this way, <i>i. e.,</i> by packaging regulation of local activity in broader schemes, is tantamount to removing meaningful limits on the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>The Court's principal means of distinguishing <i>Lopez</i> from this case is to observe that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was a \"brief, single-subject statute,\" <i>ante,</i> at 23, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> whereas the CSA is \"a lengthy and detailed statute creating a comprehensive framework for regulating the production, distribution, and possession of five classes of `controlled substances,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 24. Thus, according to the Court, it was possible in <i>Lopez</i> to evaluate in isolation the constitutionality of criminalizing local activity (there gun possession in school zones), whereas the local activity that the CSA targets (in this case cultivation and possession of marijuana for personal medicinal use) cannot be separated from the general drug control scheme of which it is a part.</p>\n<p>Today's decision allows Congress to regulate intrastate activity without check, so long as there is some implication by legislative design that regulating intrastate activity is essential (and the Court appears to equate \"essential\" with \"necessary\") to the interstate regulatory scheme. Seizing upon our language in <i>Lopez</i> that the statute prohibiting gun possession in school zones was \"not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated,\" 514 U. S., at 561, the Court appears to reason that the placement of local activity in a comprehensive scheme confirms that it is essential to that scheme. <i>Ante,</i> at 24-25. If the Court is right, then <i>Lopez</i> stands for nothing more than a drafting guide: Congress should have described the relevant crime as \"transfer or possession of a firearm anywhere in the nation\"  thus including commercial and noncommercial activity, and clearly encompassing some activity with assuredly substantial effect on interstate commerce. Had it done so, the majority hints, we would have sustained its authority to regulate possession of firearms in school zones. Furthermore, today's decision suggests we would readily sustain a congressional decision to attach the regulation of intrastate activity to a pre-existing comprehensive (or even not-so-comprehensive) scheme. If so, the Court invites increased federal regulation of local activity even if, as it suggests, Congress would not enact a <i>new</i> interstate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> scheme exclusively for the sake of reaching intrastate activity, see <i>ante,</i> at 25, n. 34; <i>ante,</i> at 38-39 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>I cannot agree that our decision in <i>Lopez</i> contemplated such evasive or overbroad legislative strategies with approval. Until today, such arguments have been made only in dissent. See <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S., at 657 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (given that Congress can regulate \"`an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity,'\" \"can Congress save the present law by including it, or much of it, in a broader `Safe Transport' or `Worker Safety' act?\"). <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> did not indicate that the constitutionality of federal regulation depends on superficial and formalistic distinctions. Likewise I did not understand our discussion of the role of courts in enforcing outer limits of the Commerce Clause for the sake of maintaining the federalist balance our Constitution requires, see <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 557; <i>id.,</i> at 578 (KENNEDY, J., concurring), as a signal to Congress to enact legislation that is more extensive and more intrusive into the domain of state power. If the Court always defers to Congress as it does today, little may be left to the notion of enumerated powers.</p>\n<p>The hard work for courts, then, is to identify objective markers for confining the analysis in Commerce Clause cases. Here, respondents challenge the constitutionality of the CSA as applied to them and those similarly situated. I agree with the Court that we must look beyond respondents' own activities. Otherwise, individual litigants could always exempt themselves from Commerce Clause regulation merely by pointing to the obvious  that their personal activities do not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See <i>Maryland</i> v. <i>Wirtz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107734\"><a href=\"/opinion/107734/maryland-v-wirtz/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 193 (1968); <i>Wickard,</i> 317 U. S., at 127-128. The task is to identify a mode of analysis that allows Congress to regulate more than nothing (by declining to reduce each case to its litigants) and less than everything (by declining to let Congress set the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> terms of analysis). The analysis may not be the same in every case, for it depends on the regulatory scheme at issue and the federalism concerns implicated. See generally <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 567; <i>id.,</i> at 579 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>A number of objective markers are available to confine the scope of constitutional review here. Both federal and state legislation  including the CSA itself, the California Compassionate Use Act, and other state medical marijuana legislation  recognize that medical and nonmedical (<i>i. e.,</i> recreational) uses of drugs are realistically distinct and can be segregated, and regulate them differently. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 812; Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 11362.5 (West Supp. 2005); <i>ante,</i> at 5 (opinion of the Court). Respondents challenge only the application of the CSA to medicinal use of marijuana. Cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Raines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106008\"><a href=\"/opinion/106008/united-states-v-james-griggs-raines/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 20-22 (1960) (describing our preference for as-applied rather than facial challenges). Moreover, because fundamental structural concerns about dual sovereignty animate our Commerce Clause cases, it is relevant that this case involves the interplay of federal and state regulation in areas of criminal law and social policy, where \"States lay claim by right of history and expertise.\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 583 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 617-619; <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 580 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\"The statute before us upsets the federal balance to a degree that renders it an unconstitutional assertion of the commerce power, and our intervention is required\"); cf. <i>Garcia,</i> 469 U. S., at 586 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (\"[S]tate autonomy is a relevant factor in assessing the means by which Congress exercises its powers\" under the Commerce Clause). California, like other States, has drawn on its reserved powers to distinguish the regulation of medicinal marijuana. To ascertain whether Congress' encroachment is constitutionally justified in this case, then, I would focus here on the personal cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> B</h2>\n<p>Having thus defined the relevant conduct, we must determine whether, under our precedents, the conduct is economic and, in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. Even if intrastate cultivation and possession of marijuana for one's own medicinal use can properly be characterized as economic, and I question whether it can, it has not been shown that such activity substantially affects interstate commerce. Similarly, it is neither self-evident nor demonstrated that regulating such activity is necessary to the interstate drug control scheme.</p>\n<p>The Court's definition of economic activity is breathtaking. It defines as economic any activity involving the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities. And it appears to reason that when an interstate market for a commodity exists, regulating the intrastate manufacture or possession of that commodity is constitutional either because that intrastate activity is itself economic, or because regulating it is a rational part of regulating its market. Putting to one side the problem endemic to the Court's opinion  the shift in focus from the activity at issue in this case to the entirety of what the CSA regulates, see <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 565 (\"depending on the level of generality, any activity can be looked upon as commercial\")  the Court's definition of economic activity for purposes of Commerce Clause jurisprudence threatens to sweep all of productive human activity into federal regulatory reach.</p>\n<p>The Court uses a dictionary definition of economics to skirt the real problem of drawing a meaningful line between \"what is national and what is local,\" <i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel,</i> 301 U. S., at 37. It will not do to say that Congress may regulate noncommercial activity simply because it may have an effect on the demand for commercial goods, or because the noncommercial endeavor can, in some sense, substitute for commercial activity. Most commercial goods or services have some sort of privately producible analogue. Home care <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> substitutes for daycare. Charades games substitute for movie tickets. Backyard or windowsill gardening substitutes for going to the supermarket. To draw the line wherever private activity affects the demand for market goods is to draw no line at all, and to declare everything economic. We have already rejected the result that would follow  a federal police power. <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 564.</p>\n<p>In <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> we suggested that economic activity usually relates directly to commercial activity. See <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S., at 611, n. 4 (intrastate activities that have been within Congress' power to regulate have been \"of an apparent commercial character\"); <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 561 (distinguishing the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 from \"activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction\"). The homegrown cultivation and personal possession and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes has no apparent commercial character. Everyone agrees that the marijuana at issue in this case was never in the stream of commerce, and neither were the supplies for growing it. (Marijuana is highly unusual among the substances subject to the CSA in that it can be cultivated without any materials that have traveled in interstate commerce.) <i>Lopez</i> makes clear that possession is not itself commercial activity. <i>Ibid.</i> And respondents have not come into possession by means of any commercial transaction; they have simply grown, in their own homes, marijuana for their own use, without acquiring, buying, selling, or bartering a thing of value. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 583 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\"The statute now before us forecloses the States from experimenting ... and it does so by regulating an activity beyond the realm of commerce in the ordinary and usual sense of that term\").</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that <i>Wickard,</i> which we have identified as \"perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity,\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 560, established federal regulatory power over any home consumption of a commodity for which a national market exists. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> I disagree. <i>Wickard</i> involved a challenge to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (AAA), which directed the Secretary of Agriculture to set national quotas on wheat production, and penalties for excess production. 317 U. S., at 115-116. The AAA itself confirmed that Congress made an explicit choice not to reach  and thus the Court could not possibly have approved of federal control over  small-scale, noncommercial wheat farming. In contrast to the CSA's limitless assertion of power, Congress provided an exemption within the AAA for small producers. When Filburn planted the wheat at issue in <i>Wickard,</i> the statute exempted plantings less than 200 bushels (about six tons), and when he harvested his wheat it exempted plantings less than six acres. <i>Id.,</i> at 130, n. 30. <i>Wickard,</i> then, did not extend Commerce Clause authority to something as modest as the home cook's herb garden. This is not to say that Congress may never regulate small quantities of commodities possessed or produced for personal use, or to deny that it sometimes needs to enact a zero tolerance regime for such commodities. It is merely to say that <i>Wickard</i> did not hold or imply that small-scale production of commodities is always economic, and automatically within Congress' reach.</p>\n<p>Even assuming that economic activity is at issue in this case, the Government has made no showing in fact that the possession and use of homegrown marijuana for medical purposes, in California or elsewhere, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Similarly, the Government has not shown that regulating such activity is necessary to an interstate regulatory scheme. Whatever the specific theory of \"substantial effects\" at issue (<i>i. e.,</i> whether the activity substantially affects interstate commerce, whether its regulation is necessary to an interstate regulatory scheme, or both), a concern for dual sovereignty requires that Congress' excursion into the traditional domain of States be justified.</p>\n<p>That is why characterizing this as a case about the Necessary and Proper Clause does not change the analysis significantly. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> Congress must exercise its authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause in a manner consistent with basic constitutional principles. <i>Garcia,</i> 469 U. S., at 585 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (\"It is not enough that the `end be legitimate'; the means to that end chosen by Congress must not contravene the spirit of the Constitution\"). As JUSTICE SCALIA recognizes, see <i>ante,</i> at 39 (opinion concurring in judgment), Congress cannot use its authority under the Clause to contravene the principle of state sovereignty embodied in the Tenth Amendment. Likewise, that authority must be used in a manner consistent with the notion of enumerated powers  a structural principle that is as much part of the Constitution as the Tenth Amendment's explicit textual command. Accordingly, something more than mere assertion is required when Congress purports to have power over local activity whose connection to an interstate market is not self-evident. Otherwise, the Necessary and Proper Clause will always be a back door for unconstitutional federal regulation. Cf. <i>Printz</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118148\"><a href=\"/opinion/118148/printz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span>, 923 (1997) (the Necessary and Proper Clause is \"the last, best hope of those who defend ultra vires congressional action\"). Indeed, if it were enough in \"substantial effects\" cases for the Court to supply conceivable justifications for intrastate regulation related to an interstate market, then we could have surmised in <i>Lopez</i> that guns in school zones are \"never more than an instant from the interstate market\" in guns already subject to extensive federal regulation, <i>ante,</i> at 40 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), recast <i>Lopez</i> as a Necessary and Proper Clause case, and thereby upheld the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. (According to the Court's and the concurrence's logic, for example, the <i>Lopez</i> court should have reasoned that the prohibition on gun possession in school zones could be an appropriate means of effectuating a related prohibition on \"sell[ing]\" or \"deliver[ing]\" firearms or ammunition to \"any individual who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe is less than <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> eighteen years of age.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 922(b)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. II).)</p>\n<p>There is simply no evidence that homegrown medicinal marijuana users constitute, in the aggregate, a sizable enough class to have a discernable, let alone substantial, impact on the national illicit drug market  or otherwise to threaten the CSA regime. Explicit evidence is helpful when substantial effect is not \"visible to the naked eye.\" See <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 563. And here, in part because common sense suggests that medical marijuana users may be limited in number and that California's Compassionate Use Act and similar state legislation may well isolate activities relating to medicinal marijuana from the illicit market, the effect of those activities on interstate drug traffic is not self-evidently substantial.</p>\n<p>In this regard, again, this case is readily distinguishable from <i>Wickard.</i> To decide whether the Secretary could regulate local wheat farming, the Court looked to \"the actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate commerce.\" 317 U. S., at 120. Critically, the Court was able to consider \"actual effects\" because the parties had \"stipulated a summary of the economics of the wheat industry.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 125. After reviewing in detail the picture of the industry provided in that summary, the Court explained that consumption of homegrown wheat was the most variable factor in the size of the national wheat crop, and that on-site consumption could have the effect of varying the amount of wheat sent to market by as much as 20 percent. <i>Id.,</i> at 127. With real numbers at hand, the <i>Wickard</i> Court could easily conclude that \"a factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions\" nationwide. <i>Id.,</i> at 128; see also <i>id.,</i> at 128-129 (\"This record leaves us in no doubt\" about substantial effects).</p>\n<p>The Court recognizes that \"the record in the <i>Wickard</i> case itself established the causal connection between the production <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> for local use and the national market\" and argues that \"we have before us findings by Congress <i>to the same effect.</i>\" <i>Ante,</i> at 20 (emphasis added). The Court refers to a series of declarations in the introduction to the CSA saying that (1) local distribution and possession of controlled substances causes \"swelling\" in interstate traffic; (2) local production and distribution cannot be distinguished from interstate production and distribution; (3) federal control over intrastate incidents \"is essential to the effective control\" over interstate drug trafficking. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. §§ 801(1)-(6). These bare declarations cannot be compared to the record before the Court in <i>Wickard.</i></p>\n<p>They amount to nothing more than a legislative insistence that the regulation of controlled substances must be absolute. They are asserted without any supporting evidence  descriptive, statistical, or otherwise. \"[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so.\" <i>Hodel</i> v. <i>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110516\"><a href=\"/opinion/110516/hodel-v-virginia-surface-mining-reclamation-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span>, 311 (1981) (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in judgment). Indeed, if declarations like these suffice to justify federal regulation, and if the Court today is right about what passes rationality review before us, then our decision in <i>Morrison</i> should have come out the other way. In that case, Congress had supplied numerous findings regarding the impact gender-motivated violence had on the national economy. 529 U. S., at 614; <i>id.,</i> at 628-636 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (chronicling findings). But, recognizing that \"`\"[w]hether particular operations affect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the constitutional power of Congress to regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question,\"'\" we found Congress' detailed findings inadequate. <i>Id.,</i> at 614 (quoting <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 557, n. 2, in turn quoting <i>Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></span>, 273 (1964) (Black, J., concurring)). If, as the Court claims, today's decision does not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> break with precedent, how can it be that voluminous findings, documenting extensive hearings about the specific topic of violence against women, did not pass constitutional muster in <i>Morrison,</i> while the CSA's abstract, unsubstantiated, generalized findings about controlled substances do?</p>\n<p>In particular, the CSA's introductory declarations are too vague and unspecific to demonstrate that the federal statutory scheme will be undermined if Congress cannot exert power over individuals like respondents. The declarations are not even specific to marijuana. (Facts about substantial effects may be developed in litigation to compensate for the inadequacy of Congress' findings; in part because this case comes to us from the grant of a preliminary injunction, there has been no such development.) Because here California, like other States, has carved out a limited class of activity for distinct regulation, the inadequacy of the CSA's findings is especially glaring. The California Compassionate Use Act exempts from other state drug laws patients and their caregivers \"who posses[s] or cultivat[e] marijuana for the <i>personal</i> medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician\" to treat a list of serious medical conditions. Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §§ 11362.5(d), 11362.7(h) (West Supp. 2005) (emphasis added). Compare <i>ibid.</i> with, <i>e. g.,</i> § 11357(b) (West 1991) (criminalizing marijuana possession in excess of 28.5 grams); § 11358 (criminalizing marijuana cultivation). The Act specifies that it should not be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in acts dangerous to others, or to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes. § 11362.5(b)(2) (West Supp. 2005). To promote the Act's operation and to facilitate law enforcement, California recently enacted an identification card system for qualified patients. §§ 11362.7-11362.83. We generally assume States enforce their laws, see <i>Riley</i> v. <i>National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112141\"><a href=\"/opinion/112141/riley-v-national-federation-of-blind-of-nc-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span>, 795 (1988), and have no reason to think otherwise here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> The Government has not overcome empirical doubt that the number of Californians engaged in personal cultivation, possession, and use of medical marijuana, or the amount of marijuana they produce, is enough to threaten the federal regime. Nor has it shown that Compassionate Use Act marijuana users have been or are realistically likely to be responsible for the drug's seeping into the market in a significant way. The Government does cite one estimate that there were over 100,000 Compassionate Use Act users in California in 2004, Reply Brief for Petitioners 16, but does not explain, in terms of proportions, what their presence means for the national illicit drug market. See generally <i>Wirtz,</i> 392 U. S., at 196, n. 27 (Congress cannot use \"a relatively trivial impact on commerce as an excuse for broad general regulation of state or private activities\"); cf. General Accounting Office, Marijuana: Early Experiences with Four States' Laws That Allow Use for Medical Purposes 21-23 (Rep. No. 03-189, Nov. 2002), http://www.gao.gov/new.items/ d03189.pdf (as visited June 3, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (in four California counties before the identification card system was enacted, voluntarily registered medical marijuana patients were less than 0.5 percent of the population; in Alaska, Hawaii, and Oregon, statewide medical marijuana registrants represented less than 0.05 percent of the States' populations). It also provides anecdotal evidence about the CSA's enforcement. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 17-18. The Court also offers some arguments about the effect of the Compassionate Use Act on the national market. It says that the California statute might be vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous physicians, that Compassionate Use Act patients may overproduce, and that the history of the narcotics trade shows the difficulty of cordoning off any drug use from the rest of the market. These arguments are plausible; if borne out in fact they could justify prosecuting Compassionate Use Act patients under the federal CSA. But, without substantiation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> they add little to the CSA's conclusory statements about diversion, essentiality, and market effect. Piling assertion upon assertion does not, in my view, satisfy the substantiality test of <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We would do well to recall how James Madison, the father of the Constitution, described our system of joint sovereignty to the people of New York: \"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.... The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.\" The Federalist No. 45, pp. 292-293 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).</p>\n<p>Relying on Congress' abstract assertions, the Court has endorsed making it a federal crime to grow small amounts of marijuana in one's own home for one's own medicinal use. This overreaching stifles an express choice by some States, concerned for the lives and liberties of their people, to regulate medical marijuana differently. If I were a California citizen, I would not have voted for the medical marijuana ballot initiative; if I were a California legislator I would not have supported the Compassionate Use Act. But whatever the wisdom of California's experiment with medical marijuana, the federalism principles that have driven our Commerce Clause cases require that room for experiment be protected in this case. For these reasons I dissent.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Respondents Diane Monson and Angel Raich use marijuana that has never been bought or sold, that has never crossed state lines, and that has had no demonstrable effect on the national market for marijuana. If Congress can regulate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> this under the Commerce Clause, then it can regulate virtually anything  and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Respondents' local cultivation and consumption of marijuana is not \"Commerce ... among the several States.\" U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. By holding that Congress may regulate activity that is neither interstate nor commerce under the Interstate Commerce Clause, the Court abandons any attempt to enforce the Constitution's limits on federal power. The majority supports this conclusion by invoking, without explanation, the Necessary and Proper Clause. Regulating respondents' conduct, however, is not \"necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\" Congress' restrictions on the interstate drug trade. Art. I, § 8, cl. 18. Thus, neither the Commerce Clause nor the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to regulate respondents' conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As I explained at length in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span> (1995), the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate the buying and selling of goods and services trafficked across state lines. <i>Id.,</i> at 586-589 (concurring opinion). The Clause's text, structure, and history all indicate that, at the time of the founding, the term \"`commerce' consisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these purposes.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 585 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Commerce, or trade, stood in contrast to productive activities like manufacturing and agriculture. <i>Id.,</i> at 586-587 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Throughout founding-era dictionaries, Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention, The Federalist Papers, and the ratification debates, the term \"commerce\" is consistently used to mean trade or exchange  not all economic or gainful activity that has some attenuated connection to trade or exchange. <i>Ibid.</i> (THOMAS, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> J., concurring); Barnett, The Original Meaning of the Commerce Clause, 68 U. Chi. L. Rev. 101, 112-125 (2001). The term \"commerce\" commonly meant trade or exchange (and shipping for these purposes) not simply to those involved in the drafting and ratification processes, but also to the general public. Barnett, New Evidence of the Original Meaning of the Commerce Clause, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span>. Rev. 847, 857-862 (2003).</p>\n<p>Even the majority does not argue that respondents' conduct is itself \"Commerce among the several States,\" Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. <i>Ante,</i> at 22. Monson and Raich neither buy nor sell the marijuana that they consume. They cultivate their cannabis entirely in the State of California  it never crosses state lines, much less as part of a commercial transaction. Certainly no evidence from the founding suggests that \"commerce\" included the mere possession of a good or some purely personal activity that did not involve trade or exchange for value. In the early days of the Republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, possession, and consumption of marijuana.</p>\n<p>On this traditional understanding of \"commerce,\" the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 801 <i>et seq.,</i> regulates a great deal of marijuana trafficking that is interstate and commercial in character. The CSA does not, however, criminalize only the interstate buying and selling of marijuana. Instead, it bans the entire market  intrastate or interstate, noncommercial or commercial  for marijuana. Respondents are correct that the CSA exceeds Congress' commerce power as applied to their conduct, which is purely intrastate and noncommercial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>More difficult, however, is whether the CSA is a valid exercise of Congress' power to enact laws that are \"necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\" its power to regulate interstate commerce. Art. I, § 8, cl. 18. The Necessary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> and Proper Clause is not a warrant to Congress to enact any law that bears some conceivable connection to the exercise of an enumerated power.<sup>[1]</sup> Nor is it, however, a command to Congress to enact only laws that are absolutely indispensable to the exercise of an enumerated power.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85272\"><a href=\"/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span> (1819), this Court, speaking through Chief Justice Marshall, set forth a test for determining when an Act of Congress is permissible under the Necessary and Proper Clause:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 421.</blockquote>\n<p>To act under the Necessary and Proper Clause, then, Congress must select a means that is \"appropriate\" and \"plainly adapted\" to executing an enumerated power; the means cannot be otherwise \"prohibited\" by the Constitution; and the means cannot be inconsistent with \"the letter and spirit of the [C]onstitution.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The First Hundred Years 1789-1888, pp. 163-164 (1985). The CSA, as applied to respondents' conduct, is not a valid exercise of Congress' power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Congress has exercised its power over interstate commerce to criminalize trafficking in marijuana across state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> lines. The Government contends that banning Monson and Raich's intrastate drug activity is \"necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\" its regulation of interstate drug trafficking. Art. I, § 8, cl. 18. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 801(6). However, in order to be \"necessary,\" the intrastate ban must be more than \"a reasonable means [of] effectuat[ing] the regulation of interstate commerce.\" Brief for Petitioners 14; see <i>ante,</i> at 22 (majority opinion) (employing rational-basis review). It must be \"plainly adapted\" to regulating interstate marijuana trafficking  in other words, there must be an \"obvious, simple, and direct relation\" between the intrastate ban and the regulation of interstate commerce. <i>Sabri</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134745\"><a href=\"/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 613 (2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Dewitt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88133\"><a href=\"/opinion/88133/united-states-v-dewitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 44 (1870) (finding ban on intrastate sale of lighting oils not \"appropriate and plainly adapted means for carrying into execution\" Congress' taxing power).</p>\n<p>On its face, a ban on the intrastate cultivation, possession, and distribution of marijuana may be plainly adapted to stopping the interstate flow of marijuana. Unregulated local growers and users could swell both the supply and the demand sides of the interstate marijuana market, making the market more difficult to regulate. <i>Ante,</i> at 12-13, 22 (majority opinion). But respondents do not challenge the CSA on its face. Instead, they challenge it as applied to their conduct. The question is thus whether the intrastate ban is \"necessary and proper\" as applied to medical marijuana users like respondents.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Respondents are not regulable simply because they belong to a large class (local growers and users of marijuana) that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> Congress might need to reach, if they also belong to a distinct and separable subclass (local growers and users of state-authorized, medical marijuana) that does not undermine the CSA's interstate ban. <i>Ante,</i> at 47-48 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). The Court of Appeals found that respondents' \"limited use is clearly distinct from the broader illicit drug market,\" because \"th[eir] medicinal marijuana . . . is not intended for, nor does it enter, the stream of commerce.\" <i>Raich</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span> 1222, 1228 (CA9 2003). If that is generally true of individuals who grow and use marijuana for medical purposes under state law, then even assuming Congress has \"obvious\" and \"plain\" reasons why regulating intrastate cultivation and possession is necessary to regulating the interstate drug trade, none of those reasons applies to medical marijuana patients like Monson and Raich.</p>\n<p>California's Compassionate Use Act sets respondents' conduct apart from other intrastate producers and users of marijuana. The Act channels marijuana use to \"seriously ill Californians,\" Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 11362.5(b)(1)(A) (West Supp. 2005), and prohibits \"the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes,\" § 11362.5(b)(2).<sup>[4]</sup> California strictly controls the cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes. To be eligible for its program, California requires that a patient have an illness that cannabis can relieve, such as cancer, AIDS, or arthritis, § 11362.5(b)(1)(A), and that he obtain a physician's recommendation or approval, § 11362.5(d). Qualified patients must provide personal and medical information to obtain medical identification cards, and there is a statewide registry of cardholders. §§ 11362.XXX-XXXXX.76. Moreover, the Medical Board of California has issued guidelines for physicians' cannabis recommendations, and it sanctions physicians who do not comply with the guidelines. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> See, <i>e. g., </i><i>People</i> v. <i>Spark,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

We normally presume that States enforce their own laws, <i>Riley</i> v. <i>National Federation of Blind of N.

The scant evidence that exists suggests that few people  the vast majority of whom are aged 40 or older  register to use medical marijuana. General Accounting Office, Marijuana: Early Experiences with Four States' Laws That Allow Use for Medical Purposes 22-23 (Rep. No. 03-189, Nov. 2002), http://www. gao.gov/new.items/d03189.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 3, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). In part because of the low incidence of medical marijuana use, many law enforcement officials report that the introduction of medical marijuana laws has not affected their law enforcement efforts. <i>Id.,</i> at 32.</p>\n<p>These controls belie the Government's assertion that placing medical marijuana outside the CSA's reach \"would prevent effective enforcement of the interstate ban on drug trafficking.\" Brief for Petitioners 33. Enforcement of the CSA can continue as it did prior to the Compassionate Use Act. Only now, a qualified patient could avoid arrest or prosecution by presenting his identification card to law enforcement officers. In the event that a qualified patient is arrested for possession or his cannabis is seized, he could seek to prove as an affirmative defense that, in conformity with state law, he possessed or cultivated small quantities of marijuana intrastate solely for personal medical use. <i>People</i> v. <i>Mower,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2632333\"><a href=\"/opinion/2632333/people-v-mower/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 469-470, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2632333\"><a href=\"/opinion/2632333/people-v-mower/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1067</span></a></span>, 1073-1075 (2002); <i>People</i> v. <i>Trippet,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Moreover, under the CSA, certain drugs that present a high risk of abuse and addiction but that nevertheless have an accepted medical use  drugs like morphine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> and amphetamines  are available by prescription. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. §§ 812(b)(2)(A)-(B); 21 CFR § 1308.12 (2004). No one argues that permitting use of these drugs under medical supervision has undermined the CSA's restrictions.</p>\n<p>But even assuming that States' controls allow some seepage of medical marijuana into the illicit drug market, there is a multibillion-dollar interstate market for marijuana. Executive Office of the President, Office of Nat. Drug Control Policy, Marijuana Fact Sheet 5 (Feb. 2004), http://www. whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/marijuana/ index.html. It is difficult to see how this vast market could be affected by diverted medical cannabis, let alone in a way that makes regulating intrastate medical marijuana obviously essential to controlling the interstate drug market.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Congress declared that state policy would disrupt federal law enforcement. It believed the across-the-board ban essential to policing interstate drug trafficking. 21 U.S.C. § 801(6). But as JUSTICE O'CONNOR points out, Congress presented no evidence in support of its conclusions, which are not so much findings of fact as assertions of power. <i>Ante,</i> at 53-55 (dissenting opinion). Congress cannot define the scope of its own power merely by declaring the necessity of its enactments.</p>\n<p>In sum, neither in enacting the CSA nor in defending its application to respondents has the Government offered any obvious reason why banning medical marijuana use is necessary to stem the tide of interstate drug trafficking. Congress' goal of curtailing the interstate drug trade would not plainly be thwarted if it could not apply the CSA to patients like Monson and Raich. That is, unless Congress' aim is really to exercise police power of the sort reserved to the States in order to eliminate even the intrastate possession and use of marijuana.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Even assuming the CSA's ban on locally cultivated and consumed marijuana is \"necessary,\" that does not mean it is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> also \"proper.\" The means selected by Congress to regulate interstate commerce cannot be \"prohibited\" by, or inconsistent with the \"letter and spirit\" of, the Constitution. <i>McCulloch,</i> 4 Wheat., at 421.</p>\n<p>In <i>Lopez,</i> I argued that allowing Congress to regulate intrastate, noncommercial activity under the Commerce Clause would confer on Congress a general \"police power\" over the Nation. 514 U.S., at 584, 600 (concurring opinion). This is no less the case if Congress ties its power to the Necessary and Proper Clause rather than the Commerce Clause. When agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration raided Monson's home, they seized six cannabis plants. If the Federal Government can regulate growing a half-dozen cannabis plants for personal consumption (not because it is interstate commerce, but because it is inextricably bound up with interstate commerce), then Congress' Article I powers  as expanded by the Necessary and Proper Clause  have no meaningful limits. Whether Congress aims at the possession of drugs, guns, or any number of other items, it may continue to \"appropriat[e] state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 627 (2000) (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Even if Congress may regulate purely intrastate activity when essential to exercising some enumerated power, see <i>Dewitt,</i> 9 Wall., at 44; but see Barnett, The Original Meaning of the Necessary and Proper Clause, 6 U. Pa. J. Const.

Hamilton) (hereinafter The Federalist).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> Here, Congress has encroached on States' traditional police powers to define the criminal law and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Brecht</i> v. <i>Abrahamson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>, 635 (1993); <i>Hillsborough County</i> v. <i>Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111437\"><a href=\"/opinion/111437/hillsborough-county-v-automated-medical-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 719 (1985). Further, the Government's rationale  that it may regulate the production or possession of any commodity for which there is an interstate market  threatens to remove the remaining vestiges of States' traditional police powers. See Brief for Petitioners 21-22; cf. Ehrlich, The Increasing Federalization of Crime, 32 Ariz. St. L. J. 825, 826, 841 (2000) (describing both the relative recency of a large percentage of federal crimes and the lack of a relationship between some of these crimes and interstate commerce). This would convert the Necessary and Proper Clause into precisely what Chief Justice Marshall did not envision, a \"pretext . . . for the accomplishment of objects not intrusted to the government.\" <i>McCulloch, supra,</i> at 423.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> II</h2>\n<p>The majority advances three reasons why the CSA is a legitimate exercise of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause: First, respondents' conduct, taken in the aggregate, may substantially affect interstate commerce, <i>ante,</i> at 22; second, regulation of respondents' conduct is essential to regulating the interstate marijuana market, <i>ante,</i> at 24-25; and, third, regulation of respondents' conduct is incidental to regulating the interstate marijuana market, <i>ante,</i> at 22. JUSTICE O'CONNOR explains why the majority's reasons cannot be reconciled with our recent Commerce Clause jurisprudence. The majority's justifications, however, suffer from even more fundamental flaws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The majority holds that Congress may regulate intrastate cultivation and possession of medical marijuana under the Commerce Clause, because such conduct arguably has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The majority's decision is further proof that the \"substantial effects\" test is a \"rootless and malleable standard\" at odds with the constitutional design. <i>Morrison, supra,</i> at 627 (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>The majority's treatment of the substantial effects test is rootless, because it is not tethered to either the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause. Under the Commerce Clause, Congress may regulate interstate commerce, not activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, any more than activities that do not fall within, but that affect, the subjects of its other Article I powers. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 589 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Whatever additional latitude the Necessary and Proper Clause affords, <i>supra,</i> at 65-66, the question is whether Congress' legislation is essential to the regulation of interstate commerce itself  not whether the legislation extends only to economic <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. <i>Supra,</i> at 60-61; <i>ante,</i> at 37 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>The majority's treatment of the substantial effects test is malleable, because the majority expands the relevant conduct. By defining the class at a high level of generality (as the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana), the majority overlooks that individuals authorized by state law to manufacture and possess medical marijuana exert no demonstrable effect on the interstate drug market. <i>Supra,</i> at 64. The majority ignores that whether a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce  and thus comes within Congress' reach on the majority's approach  can turn on a number of objective factors, like state action or features of the regulated activity itself. <i>Ante,</i> at 47-48 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). For instance, here, if California and other States are effectively regulating medical marijuana users, then these users have little effect on the interstate drug trade.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The substantial effects test is easily manipulated for another reason. This Court has never held that Congress can <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> regulate noneconomic activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U. S., at 613 (\"[T]hus far in our Nation's history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is <i>economic</i> in nature\" (emphasis added)); <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 560. To evade even that modest restriction on federal power, the majority defines economic activity in the broadest possible terms as the \"`the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities.'\"<sup>[7]</sup><i>Ante,</i> at 25 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 720 (1966) (hereinafter Webster's 3d)). This carves out a vast swath of activities that are subject to federal regulation. See <i>ante,</i> at 49-50 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). If the majority is to be taken seriously, the Federal Government may now regulate quilting bees, clothes drives, and potluck suppers throughout the 50 States. This makes a mockery of Madison's assurance to the people of New York that the \"powers delegated\" to the Federal Government are \"few and defined,\" while those of the States are \"numerous and indefinite.\" The Federalist No. 45, at 313 (J. Madison).</p>\n<p>Moreover, even a Court interested more in the modern than the original understanding of the Constitution ought to resolve cases based on the meaning of words that are actually in the document. Congress is authorized to regulate \"Commerce,\" and respondents' conduct does not qualify under any definition of that term.<sup>[8]</sup> The majority's opinion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> only illustrates the steady drift away from the text of the Commerce Clause. There is an inexorable expansion from \"`[c]ommerce,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 5, to \"commercial\" and \"economic\" activity, <i>ante,</i> at 23, and finally to all \"production, distribution, and consumption\" of goods or services for which there is an \"established . . . interstate market,\" <i>ante,</i> at 26. Federal power expands, but never contracts, with each new locution. The majority is not interpreting the Commerce Clause, but rewriting it.</p>\n<p>The majority's rewriting of the Commerce Clause seems to be rooted in the belief that, unless the Commerce Clause covers the entire web of human activity, Congress will be left powerless to regulate the national economy effectively. <i>Ante,</i> at 18-19; <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 573-574 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). The interconnectedness of economic activity is not a modern phenomenon unfamiliar to the Framers. <i>Id.,</i> at 590-593 (THOMAS, J., concurring); Letter from J. Madison to S. Roane (Sept. 2, 1819), in 3 The Founders' Constitution 259-260 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987). Moreover, the Framers understood what the majority does not appear to fully appreciate: There is a danger to concentrating too much, as well as too little, power in the Federal Government. This Court has carefully avoided stripping Congress of its ability to regulate <i>inter</i>state commerce, but it has casually allowed the Federal Government to strip States of their ability to regulate <i>intra</i>state commerce  not to mention a host of local activities, like mere drug possession, that are not commercial.</p>\n<p>One searches the Court's opinion in vain for any hint of what aspect of American life is reserved to the States. Yet this Court knows that \"`[t]he Constitution created a Federal Government of limited powers.'\" <i>New York</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112768\"><a href=\"/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 155 (1992) (quoting <i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112632\"><a href=\"/opinion/112632/gregory-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 457 (1991)). That is why today's decision will add no measure of stability to our Commerce Clause jurisprudence: This Court is willing neither to enforce limits on federal power, nor to declare the Tenth Amendment a dead letter. If stability is possible, it is only by discarding the stand-alone substantial effects test and revisiting our definition of \"Commerce . . . among the several States.\" Congress may regulate interstate commerce  not things that affect it, even when summed together, unless truly \"necessary and proper\" to regulating interstate commerce.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The majority also inconsistently contends that regulating respondents' conduct is both incidental and essential to a comprehensive legislative scheme. <i>Ante,</i> at 22, 24-25. I have already explained why the CSA's ban on local activity is not essential. <i>Supra,</i> at 64. However, the majority further claims that, because the CSA covers a great deal of interstate commerce, it \"is of no moment\" if it also \"ensnares some purely intrastate activity.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 22. So long as Congress casts its net broadly over an interstate market, according to the majority, it is free to regulate interstate and intrastate activity alike. This cannot be justified under either the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause. If the activity is purely intrastate, then it may not be regulated under the Commerce Clause. And if the regulation of the intrastate activity is purely incidental, then it may not be regulated under the Necessary and Proper Clause.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the majority terms this the \"pivotal' distinction between the present case and <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison. Ante,</i> at 23. In <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the parties asserted facial challenges, claiming \"that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress' commerce power in its entirety.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 23. Here, by contrast, respondents claim only that the CSA falls outside Congress' commerce power as applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> to their individual conduct. According to the majority, while courts may set aside whole statutes or provisions, they may not \"excise individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 23; see also <i>Perez</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108326\"><a href=\"/opinion/108326/perez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 154 (1971); <i>Maryland</i> v. <i>Wirtz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107734\"><a href=\"/opinion/107734/maryland-v-wirtz/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 192-193 (1968).</p>\n<p>It is true that if respondents' conduct is part of a \"class of activities . . . and that class is within the reach of federal power,\" <i>Perez, supra,</i> at 154 (emphases deleted), then respondents may not point to the <i>de minimis</i> effect of their own personal conduct on the interstate drug market, <i>Wirtz, supra,</i> at 196, n. 27. <i>Ante,</i> at 47 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). But that begs the question at issue: whether respondents' \"class of activities\" is \"within the reach of federal power,\" which depends in turn on whether the class is defined at a low or a high level of generality. <i>Supra,</i> at 61-62. If medical marijuana patients like Monson and Raich largely stand outside the interstate drug market, then courts must excise them from the CSA's coverage. Congress expressly provided that if \"a provision [of the CSA] is held invalid in one of more of its <i>applications,</i> the provision shall remain in effect in all its valid applications that are severable.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 901 (emphasis added); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 320-321, and n. 9 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Even in the absence of an express severability provision, it is implausible that this Court could set aside entire portions of the United States Code as outside Congress' power in <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> but it cannot engage in the more restrained practice of invalidating particular applications of the CSA that are beyond Congress' power. This Court has regularly entertained as-applied challenges under constitutional provisions, see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Raines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106008\"><a href=\"/opinion/106008/united-states-v-james-griggs-raines/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 20-21 (1960), including the Commerce Clause, see <i>Katzenbach</i> v. <i>McClung,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106951\"><a href=\"/opinion/106951/katzenbach-v-mcclung/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 295 (1964); <i>Heart of Atlanta</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> <i>Motel, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></span>, 249 (1964); <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103716\"><a href=\"/opinion/103716/wickard-v-filburn/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 113-114 (1942). There is no reason why, when Congress exceeds the scope of its commerce power, courts may not invalidate Congress' overreaching on a case-by-case basis. The CSA undoubtedly regulates a great deal of interstate commerce, but that is no license to regulate conduct that is neither interstate nor commercial, however minor or incidental.</p>\n<p>If the majority is correct that <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> are distinct because they were facial challenges to \"particular statute[s] or provision[s],\" <i>ante,</i> at 23, then congressional power turns on the manner in which Congress packages legislation. Under the majority's reasoning, Congress could not enact  either as a single-subject statute or as a separate provision in the CSA  a prohibition on the intrastate possession or cultivation of marijuana. Nor could it enact an intrastate ban simply to supplement existing drug regulations. However, that same prohibition is perfectly constitutional when integrated into a piece of legislation that reaches other regulable conduct. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 600-601 (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Finally, the majority's view  that because <i>some</i> of the CSA's applications are constitutional, they must <i>all</i> be constitutional  undermines its reliance on the substantial effects test. The intrastate conduct swept within a general regulatory scheme may or may not have a substantial effect on the relevant interstate market. \"[O]ne <i>always</i> can draw the circle broadly enough to cover an activity that, when taken in isolation, would not have substantial effects on commerce.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 600 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The breadth of legislation that Congress enacts says nothing about whether the intrastate activity substantially affects interstate commerce, let alone whether it is necessary to the scheme. Because medical marijuana users in California and elsewhere are not placing substantial amounts of cannabis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> into the stream of interstate commerce, Congress may not regulate them under the substantial effects test, no matter how broadly it drafts the CSA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The majority prevents States like California from devising drug policies that they have concluded provide much-needed respite to the seriously ill. It does so without any serious inquiry into the necessity for federal regulation or the propriety of \"displac[ing] state regulation in areas of traditional state concern,\" <i>id.,</i> at 583 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). The majority's rush to embrace federal power \"is especially unfortunate given the importance of showing respect for the sovereign States that comprise our Federal Union.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118426\"><a href=\"/opinion/118426/united-states-v-oakland-cannabis-buyerscooperative/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 502 (2001) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Our federalist system, properly understood, allows California and a growing number of other States to decide for themselves how to safeguard the health and welfare of their citizens.

See n. 20, <i>supra.</i> Indeed, even the Court of Appeals found that those findings \"weigh[ed] in favor\" of upholding the constitutionality of the CSA. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784532\"><a href=\"/opinion/784532/raich-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1222</span></a></span>, 1232 (CA9 2003) (case below). The dissenters, however, would impose a new and heightened burden on Congress (unless the litigants can garner evidence sufficient to cure Congress' perceived \"inadequa[cies]\")that legislation must contain detailed findings proving that each activity regulated within a comprehensive statute is essential to the statutory scheme. <i>Post,</i> at 53-55 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); <i>post,</i> at 64 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Such an exacting requirement is not only unprecedented, it is also impractical. Indeed, the principal dissent's critique of Congress for \"not even\" including \"declarations\" specific to marijuana is particularly unpersuasive given that the CSA initially identified 80 other substances subject to regulation as Schedule I drugs, not to mention those categorized in Schedules II-V. <i>Post,</i> at 55 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). Surely, Congress cannot be expected (and certainly should not be required) to include specific findings on each and every substance contained therein in order to satisfy the dissenters' unfounded skepticism.</p>\n<p>[33]  See n. 21, <i>supra</i> (citing sources that evince Congress' particular concern with the diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit channels).</p>\n<p>[34]  The principal dissent asserts that by \"[s]eizing upon our language in <i>Lopez,</i>\" <i>post,</i> at 46 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.), <i>i. e.,</i> giving effect to our well-established case law, Congress will now have an incentive to legislate broadly. Even putting aside the political checks that would generally curb Congress' power to enact a broad and comprehensive scheme for the purpose of targeting purely local activity, there is no suggestion that the CSA constitutes the type of \"evasive\" legislation the dissent fears, nor could such an argument plausibly be made. <i>Post,</i> at 47 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[35]  <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.

But the possibility that the drug may be reclassified in the future has no relevance to the question whether Congress now has the power to regulate its production and distribution. Respondents' submission, if accepted, would place all homegrown medical substances beyond the reach of Congress' regulatory jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>[38]  That is so even if California's current controls (enacted eight years after the Compassionate Use Act was passed) are \"effective,\" as the dissenters would have us blindly presume, <i>post,</i> at 53-54 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); <i>post,</i> at 63, 68 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). California's decision (made 34 years after the CSA was enacted) to impose \"stric[t] controls\" on the \"cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes,\" <i>post,</i> at 62 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), cannot retroactively divest Congress of its authority under the Commerce Clause. Indeed, JUSTICE THOMAS' urgings to the contrary would turn the Supremacy Clause on its head, and would resurrect limits on congressional power that have long since been rejected. See <i>post,</i> at 41 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting <i>Mc-Culloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85272\"><a href=\"/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>, 424 (1819)) (\"`To impose on [Congress] the necessity of resorting to means which it cannot control, which another government may furnish or withhold, would render its course precarious, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a dependence on other governments, which might disappoint its most important designs, and is incompatible with the language of the constitution'\").\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, in addition to casting aside more than a century of this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence, it is noteworthy that JUSTICE THOMAS' suggestion that States possess the power to dictate the extent of Congress' commerce power would have far-reaching implications beyond the facts of this case. For example, under his reasoning, Congress would be equally powerless to regulate, let alone prohibit, the intrastate possession, cultivation, and use of marijuana for <i>recreational</i> purposes, an activity which all States \"strictly contro[l].\" Indeed, his rationale seemingly would require Congress to cede its constitutional power to regulate commerce whenever a State opts to exercise its \"traditional police powers to define the criminal law and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens.\" <i>Post,</i> at 66 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>[39]  California's Compassionate Use Act has since been amended, limiting the catchall category to \"[a]ny other chronic or persistent medical symptom that either: ... [s]ubstantially limits the ability of the person to conduct one or more major life activities as defined\" in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or \"[i]f not alleviated, may cause serious harm to the patient's safety or physical or mental health.\" Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §§ 11362.7(h)(12)(A)-(B) (West Supp. 2005).</p>\n<p>[40]  See, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109337\"><a href=\"/opinion/109337/united-states-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span> (1975); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Doremus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99302\"><a href=\"/opinion/99302/united-states-v-doremus/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span> (1919).</p>\n<p>[41]  The state policy allows patients to possess up to eight ounces of dried marijuana, and to cultivate up to 6 mature or 12 immature plants. Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. § 11362.77(a) (West Supp. 2005). However, the quantity limitations serve only as a floor. Based on a doctor's recommendation, a patient can possess whatever quantity is necessary to satisfy his medical needs, and cities and counties are given <i>carte blanche</i> to establish more generous limits. Indeed, several cities and counties have done just that. For example, patients residing in the cities of Oakland and Santa Cruz and in the counties of Sonoma and Tehama are permitted to possess up to 3 pounds of processed marijuana. Reply Brief for Petitioners 18-19 (citing Proposition 215 Enforcement Guidelines). Putting that quantity in perspective, 3 pounds of marijuana yields roughly 3,000 joints or cigarettes. Executive Office of the President, Office of National Drug Control Policy, What America's Users Spend on Illegal Drugs 24 (Dec. 2001), http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/pdf/american_ users_spend_2002.pdf. And the street price for that amount can range anywhere from $900 to $24,000. DEA, Illegal Drug Price and Purity Report (Apr. 2003) (DEA-02058).</p>\n<p>[42]  For example, respondent Raich attests that she uses 2.5 ounces of cannabis a week. App. 82. Yet as a resident of Oakland, she is entitled to possess up to 3 pounds of processed marijuana at any given time, nearly 20 times more than she uses on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>[43]  See, <i>e. g., </i><i>People ex rel.

Because the unregulated production of wheat for personal consumption diminished demand in the regulated wheat market, the Court said, it carried with it the potential to disrupt Congress's price regulation by driving down prices in the market. <i>Id.,</i> at 127-129. This potential disruption of Congress's interstate regulation, and not only the effect that personal consumption of wheat had on interstate commerce, justified Congress's regulation of that conduct. <i>Id.,</i> at 128-129.</p>\n<p>[3]  The principal dissent claims that, if this is sufficient to sustain the regulation at issue in this case, then it should also have been sufficient to sustain the regulation at issue in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span> (1995). See <i>post,</i> at 52 (arguing that \"we could have surmised in <i>Lopez</i> that guns in school zones are `never more than an instant from the interstate market' in guns already subject to extensive federal regulation, recast <i>Lopez</i> as a Necessary and Proper Clause case, and thereby upheld the Gun-Free School Zones Act\" (citation omitted)). This claim founders upon the shoals of <i>Lopez</i> itself, which made clear that the statute there at issue was \"<i>not</i> an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity.\" <i>Lopez, supra,</i> at 561 (emphasis added). On the dissent's view of things, that statement is inexplicable. Of course it is in addition difficult to imagine what intelligible scheme of regulation of the interstate market in guns could have as an appropriate means of effectuation the prohibition of guns within 1,000 feet of schools (and nowhere else). The dissent points to a federal law, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. § 922(b)(1), barring licensed dealers from selling guns to minors, see <i>post,</i> at 52-53, but the relationship between the regulatory scheme of which § 922(b)(1) is a part (requiring all dealers in firearms that have traveled in interstate commerce to be licensed, see § 922(a)) and the statute at issue in <i>Lopez</i> approaches the nonexistent  which is doubtless why the Government did not attempt to justify the statute on the basis of that relationship.</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85272\"><a href=\"/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>, 419-421 (1819); Madison, The Bank Bill, House of Representatives (Feb. 2, 1791), in 3 The Founders' Constitution 244 (P. Kurland &amp; R.

In those cases, we held that Congress, in enacting the statutes at issue, had exceeded its Article I powers.</p>\n<p>[4]  Other States likewise prohibit diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Colo. Const., Art. XVIII, § 14(2)(d); Nev. Rev. Stat. §§ 453A.300(1)(e)-(f) (2003); Ore. Rev. Stat. §§ 475.316(1)(c)-(d) (2003).</p>\n<p>[5]  In fact, the Anti-Federalists objected that the Necessary and Proper Clause would allow Congress, <i>inter alia,</i> to \"<i>constitute new Crimes,</i> . . . and extend [its] Power as far as [it] shall think proper; so that the State Legislatures have no Security for the Powers now presumed to remain to them; or the People for their Rights.\" Mason, Objections to the Constitution Formed by the Convention (1787), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 11, 12-13 (H. Storing ed. 1981) (emphasis added). Hamilton responded that these objections were gross \"misrepresentation[s].\" The Federalist No. 33, at 204. He termed the Clause \"perfectly harmless,\" for it merely confirmed Congress' implied authority to enact laws in exercising its enumerated powers. <i>Id.,</i> at 205; see also <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S., at 597, n. 6 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (discussing Congress' limited ability to establish nationwide criminal prohibitions); <i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85330\"><a href=\"/opinion/85330/cohens-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span>, 426-428 (1821) (finding it \"clear, that Congress cannot punish felonies generally,\" except in areas over which it possesses plenary power). According to Hamilton, the Clause was needed only \"to guard against cavilling refinements\" by those seeking to cripple federal power. The Federalist No. 33, at 205; <i>id.,</i> No. 44, at 303-304 (J. Madison).</p>\n<p>[6]  Remarkably, the majority goes so far as to declare this question irrelevant. It asserts that the CSA is constitutional even if California's current controls are effective, because state action can neither expand nor contract Congress' powers. <i>Ante,</i> at 29-30, n. 38. The majority's assertion is misleading. Regardless of state action, Congress has the power to regulate intrastate economic activities that substantially affect interstate commerce (on the majority's view) or activities that are necessary and proper to effectuating its commerce power (on my view). But on either approach, whether an intrastate activity falls within the scope of Congress' powers turns on factors that the majority is unwilling to confront. The majority apparently believes that even if States prevented any medical marijuana from entering the illicit drug market, and thus even if there were no need for the CSA to govern medical marijuana users, we should uphold the CSA under the <i>Commerce</i> Clause and the <i>Necessary</i> and Proper Clause. Finally, to invoke the Supremacy Clause, as the majority does, <i>ante,</i> at 29, n. 38, is to beg the question. The CSA displaces California's Compassionate Use Act if the CSA is constitutional as applied to respondents' conduct, but that is the very question at issue.</p>\n<p>[7]  Other dictionaries do not define the term \"economic\" as broadly as the majority does. See, <i>e. g.,</i> The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 583 (3d ed. 1992) (defining \"economic\" as \"[o]f or relating to the production, development, and management of <i>material wealth,</i> as of a country, household, or business enterprise\" (emphasis added)). The majority does not explain why it selects a remarkably expansive 40-year-old definition.</p>\n<p>[8]  See, <i>e. g., id.,</i> at 380 (\"[t]he buying and selling of goods, especially on a large scale, as between cities or nations\"); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 411 (2d ed. 1987) (\"an interchange of goods or commodities, esp. on a large scale between different countries . . . or between different parts of the same country\"); Webster's 3d 456 (\"the exchange or buying and selling of commodities esp. on a large scale and involving transportation from place to place\").</p>\n\n</div>",
